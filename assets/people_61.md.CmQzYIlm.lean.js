The \\"Parson's Cause\\" was a legal and political dispute in the Colony of Virginia often viewed as an important event leading up to the American Revolution. Colonel John Henry, father of Patrick Henry, was the judge who presided over the court case and jury that decided the issue. The relatively unknown Patrick Henry advocated in favor of colonial rights in the case. In 1758, the Virginia colonial legislature passed the Two Penny Act. According to legislation passed in 1748, Virginia's Anglican clergy were to be paid 16,000 pounds of tobacco per year, one of the colony's major commodity crops. Following a poor harvest in 1758, the price of tobacco rose from two to six pennies per pound, effectively inflating clerical salaries. The House of Burgesses responded by passing legislation allowing debts in tobacco to be paid in currency at a rate of two pennies per pound. King George III of Great Britain vetoed the law on the British Board of Trade's recommendation, causing an uproar in the colony. Many Virginia legislators saw the king's veto as a breach of their legislative authority. The Reverend James Maury had sued in Hanover County Court (April 1, 1762) for back wages on behalf of all the ministers involved, and he effectively became a representative of the British cause. The court ruled (Nov. 5, 1763) that Maury's claim was valid, but that the amount of damages had to be determined by a jury, which was called for in December 1763. Patrick Henry, then relatively unknown, rose to prominence by defending Hanover County against Maury's claims. Henry argued in favor of the Two Penny Act. As reported by the plaintiff Maury in a letter (Dec. 12, 1763) to fellow Anglican minister John Camm shortly after the trial, Henry argued in substance \\"that a King, by disallowing Acts of this salutary nature, from being the father of his people, degenerated into a Tyrant and forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience.\\"Ann Maury, Memoirs of a Huguenot Family, G.P. Putnam & Sons, 1872, letter at pages 418-424, quote at page 421 The jury awarded Maury one penny in damages. The award essentially nullified the Crown veto, and no other clergy sued. The Hanover County Courthouse is still operating; historic U.S. Route 301 passes by it. The courthouse is adjacent to the Hanover Tavern, where Patrick Henry lodged while arguing the Parson's Cause, and is the third oldest courthouse still in use in the United States. The state historic office dates the building's construction between 1737 and 1742.Discover Richmond See also * History of Virginia  References  * Scott, Arthur P. \\"The Constitutional Aspects of the 'Parson's Cause, Political Science Quarterly, 31:4 (Dec. 1916): 558‚Äì577. . . * \\"Episode 017: Parsons Cause, Bishops, and Trade\\", American Revolution Podcast, November 5, 2017  External links  * Category:Colonial Virginia Category:1763 in the Thirteen Colonies Category:History of tobacco Category:Patrick Henry Category:1763 in Virginia ","title":"Parson's Cause"},{"id":"3015860","text":"Monteviot House William Kerr, 6th Marquess of Lothian, (4 October 1763 ‚Äì 27 April 1824) was the son of William Kerr, 5th Marquess of Lothian.

It was once a popular vacation destination spot before ever-increasing salinity and pollution of the Salton Sea shut the tourist trade down. The population was 3,477 at the 2010 census. The town traces its beginnings to 1958 when developers Ray Ryan and Trav Rogers purchased the land on which the town would sit and began to sell individual parcels in 1960. North Shore is notable as the home of the Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. Established in 1930 by presidential proclamation and with an original area of over , only about remain due to flooding caused by the Salton Sea. A proposed system of dikes that will help control the increasing salinity of the Salton Sea will also serve to stop further encroachment on the refuge. One building is particularly noteworthy. The North Shore Beach and Yacht Club, an Albert Frey design, opened in 1962 and was in active use until 1984; rising water levels destroyed the jetty in 1981, thereby making it impossible for boats to dock there. As recently as the early 2000s, it was possible to enter the lobby prior to its being boarded up, although stairs leading to the second floor had been removed prior to its abandonment. The lobby was once littered with hotel receipts from the neighboring North Shore Motel (razed in 2008) dating back to the club's last days. The yacht club has been restored under a $3.35 million grant and since 2011 is open to the public as a Community Center and historical landmark. The Salton Sea History Museum was relocated to Mecca, California in February 2012. North Shore is accessible via State Route 111 at the Imperial County line. The wildlife refuge and campground is a short distance south of the town. The ZIP Code is 92254, and the community is inside area codes 442 and 760. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 11.2 square miles (28.9 km), all of it land. Demographics The 2010 United States Census reported that North Shore had a population of 3,477. The population density was 311.1 people per square mile (120.1/km). The racial makeup of North Shore was 1,394 (40.1%) White, 33 (0.9%) African American, 26 (0.7%) Native American, 18 (0.5%) Asian, 5 (0.1%) Pacific Islander, 1,884 (54.2%) from other races, and 117 (3.4%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3,313 persons (95.3%). The Census reported that 3,477 people (100% of the population) lived in households, 0 (0%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized. There were 750 households, out of which 542 (72.3%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 550 (73.3%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 83 (11.1%) had a female householder with no husband present, 52 (6.9%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 47 (6.3%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 10 (1.3%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 47 households (6.3%) were made up of individuals, and 13 (1.7%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.64. There were 685 families (91.3% of all households); the average family size was 4.83. The population was spread out, with 1,388 people (39.9%) under the age of 18, 418 people (12.0%) aged 18 to 24, 918 people (26.4%) aged 25 to 44, 621 people (17.9%) aged 45 to 64, and 132 people (3.8%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 23.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 110.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 109.9 males. There were 854 housing units at an average density of 76.4 per square mile (29.5/km), of which 606 (80.8%) were owner-occupied, and 144 (19.2%) were occupied by renters.

They are mentioned briefly in Ptolemy's Geography (written c. 150), and there is no other historical record of them. Excavations at Rispain Camp, near Whithorn, show that it was a large fortified farmstead occupied between 100 BC and 200 AD, indicating that the people living in the area at that time were engaged in agriculture. Their ethnic and cultural affinity is uncertain, with various authorities positing different links, beginning with Bede, who referred to the Novantae as the Niduarian Picts, and including the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (11th ed.), which described them as \\"a tribe of Celtic Gaels called Novantae or Atecott Picts.\\" Scottish author Edward Grant Ries has identified the Novantae (along with other early tribes of southern Scotland) as a Brythonic-speaking culture. However, the region has a history that includes the culture of the Gaels, Picts, and Brythonic speakers at various times, alone and in combination, and there is not enough information to make conclusions about the ethnicity of the Novantae. Ptolemy 150px The only reliable historical reference to the Novantae is from the Geography of Ptolemy in c. 150, where he gives their homeland and primary towns., Geographia 2.2, Albion Island of Britannia. They are found in no other source. They are unique among the peoples that Ptolemy names in that their location is reliably known due to the way he named several readily identifiable physical features. His Novantarum Cheronesus is the Rhins of Galloway, and his Novantarum promontory is Corsewall Point or the Mull of Galloway. This pins the Novantae to that area. Ptolemy says that their towns were Locopibium and Rerigonium. As there were no towns as such in the area at that time, he was likely referring to native strong points such as duns or royal courts. Roman era 240px The earliest reliable information on the region of Galloway and Carrick when it was inhabited by the Novantae comes from archaeological discoveries. They lived in small enclosed settlements, most of them less than a single hectare in area and inhabited from the 1st millennium BC through to the Roman era. They also constructed hillforts and a small number of crannogs and brochs. Stone-walled huts appear during the Roman era and the Novantae are thought to have had a centre of some kind at Clatteringshaws near Kirkcudbright, which started out as a palisaded enclosure before being expanded into a set of timber and then stone-faced ramparts. This had been abandoned by the Roman period but there is evidence that the Romans used it as the target of a military exercise, erecting two practice camps nearby and subjecting it to a mock siege. The only Roman military presence was a small fortlet at Gatehouse of Fleet, in the southeastern part of Novantae territory., Britannia The Roman remains that have been excavated are portable, such as might be carried or transported into the region. The absence of evidence of Roman presence is in sharp contrast to the many remains of native habitation and strong points., Roman Remains, A History of Dumfries and Galloway, Wigtonshire. Rispain Camp near Whithorn, once thought to be Roman, is now known to be the remains of a large fortified farmstead, occupied by natives before and during the Roman Era.. Reports on the excavations were published in 1983. In his account of the campaigns of Gnaeus Julius Agricola (governor 78 ‚Äì 84), Tacitus offers no specific information on the peoples then living in Scotland. He says that after a combination of force and diplomacy quieted discontent among the Britons who had been conquered previously, Agricola built forts in their territories in 79. In 80 he marched to the Firth of Tay, campaigning against the peoples there. He did not return until 81, at which time he consolidated his gains in the lands that he had conquered., Life of Agricola, Chapters 19 ‚Äì 23. The Novantae were later said to have caused trouble along Hadrian's Wall, and the Gatehouse of Fleet fortlet was presumably used to subdue them. Novant The Novantae disappear from the historical record after the end of the Roman occupation, as the name was beyond doubt the Roman name for the people who did not use it, with their territory supplanted by the kingdoms of Rheged and Gododdin. A kingdom called Novant appears in the medieval Welsh poem Y Gododdin, attributed to Aneirin. The poem commemorates the Battle of Catraeth, in which an army raised by Gododdin attempted an ill-fated raid on the Angles of Bernicia. The work elegises the various warriors who fought alongside the Gododdin, among them the \\"Three Chiefs of Novant\\" and their substantial retinue., XVIII, The Gododdin This Novant is evidently related to the Novantae tribe of the Iron Age.  Contradicting Ptolemy  Ptolemy's placement of the Selgovae town of Trimontium was accepted to be somewhere along the southern coast of Scotland until William Roy (1726‚Äì1790) placed it far to the east at Eildon Hills, near Newstead. Roy was trying to follow an itinerary given in the 1757 De Situ Britanniae, and moving Ptolemy's Trimontium made the itinerary seem more logical according to his historical work, Military Antiquities of the Romans in North Britain (1790, published posthumously in 1793). Roy did not alter Ptolemy's placement of the Selgovae in southern Scotland, but chose to assign Trimontium to a different people who were described in De Situ Britanniae., Military Antiquities, Book IV, Chapter III Location of the Selgovae town of Trimontium according to Roy, who was trying to reconcile problems with the spurious De Situ Britanniae. When De Situ Britanniae was debunked as a fraud in 1845, Roy's misguided placement of Trimontium was retained by some historians, though he was no longer cited for his contribution. Furthermore, some historians not only accepted Roy's placement of Trimontium, but also returned the town to the Selgovae by moving their territory such that they would be near Eildon Hills. Ptolemy's placement of the Novantae in Galloway was retained, and since Ptolemy said that they were adjacent to the Selgovae, Novantae territory was greatly expanded beyond Galloway to be consistent with this thesis, which survives in a number of modern histories. ‚Äì see, for example, the influential Iron Age Communities in Britain, map of the tribes of Northern Britain, attributed to \\"various sources\\" The result is that an 'error correction' to the sole legitimate historical reference (Ptolemy), made so that a fictional itinerary in De Situ Britanniae would seem more logical, is retained; and the sole legitimate historical reference is further 'corrected' by moving the Selgovae far from their only known location, greatly expanding Novantae territory in the process. While Roy's historical work is largely ignored due to his unknowing reliance on a fraudulent source, his maps and drawings are untainted, and continue to be held in the highest regard. Treatment by historians Befitting the single historical mention of the Novantae by Ptolemy, many historians have largely included the Novantae im passim in their works, if they are mentioned at all. William Forbes Skene (Celtic Scotland, 1886) briefly relates their notice in Ptolemy, adding his conjectures as to the possible locations of towns, though not with any conviction., Celtic Scotland John Rhys (Celtic Britain, 1904) mentions the Novantae in passing, without any detailed discussion., Celtic Britain Local Galwegian historians, writing histories of their own home territory, provide a similarly scant treatment., The Hereditary Sheriffs of Galloway, A History of Dumfries and Galloway, History of the Lands and their Owners in Galloway, Galloway in Ancient and Modern Times, Ptolemy's Geography. More recent histories largely treat the Novantae in passing, but often weave them into a story that is not supported by either Ptolemy's map or archaeological evidence. John Koch (Celtic Culture, 2005) doesn't discuss the Novantae directly, but associates their name with the Trinovantes of southeastern England, and provides a map showing the \\"Novant\\" occupying Galloway and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright to accompany his discussion of the Gododdin., Celtic Culture, Gododdin and Trinovantes. Barry Cunliffe, an archaeologist, (Iron Age Communities in Britain, 1971) mentions the Novantae in passing, saying their homeland was Galloway and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, and with a map showing it, which he attributes to \\"various sources\\"., Iron Age Communities in Britain, Southern Scotland: Votadini, Novantae, Selgovae and Damnonii. David Mattingly (An Imperial Possession: Britain in the Roman Empire, 2006) mentions them as a people of southwestern Scotland according to Ptolemy, with maps showing them as occupying both Galloway and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright., An Imperial Possession: Britain in the Roman Empire Sheppard Frere (Britannia: A History of Roman Britain, 1987) mentions the Novantae several times in passing, associating them firmly with the Selgovae and sometimes with the Brigantes. He places them in both Galloway and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, with the Selgovae on the other side of the Southern Uplands in southeastern Scotland., Britannia The Novantae are inconsequential to the larger history of Scotland in Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History (2005) by Alistair Moffat, but he weaves a number of colourful though questionable details about them into his story. He says that their name means 'The Vigorous People', that they had kings and often acted in concert with the Selgovae and Brigantes, all of whom may have joined the Picts in raids on Roman Britain., Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History He provides no authority for any of these assertions.

He was born on the Greek island of Kos in about 340 BC. Both his father, Nicarchus, and his grandfather were physicians. Very little is known of Praxagoras' personal life, and none of his writings have survived. History Between the death of Hippocrates in 375 BC and the founding of the school in Alexandria, Egypt, Greek medicine became entrenched with speculation, seeing little advances in medicine. During this period four men took up the study of anatomy: Diocles of Carystus (fl. 4th century BC), Herophilus (c. 335-280 BC), Erasistratus (c. 304-250 BC), and finally Praxagoras. Galen (AD 129-216), a famous Greek physician, wrote of Praxagoras as this influential figure in Greek medicine and a member of the logical or dogmatic school. Galen also probably knew of the works of Praxagoras, writing on natural sciences, anatomy, causes and treatment of disease, and on acute diseases. Praxagoras adopted a variation of the humoral theory, but instead of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) that most physicians held, he insisted on eleven. Like the other Greek physicians, he believed health and disease were controlled by the balance or imbalance of these humors. For example, if the proper amount of heat is present in the organism, the process of digestion is natural. Too little or too much heat will cause a rise in the other humors, which then produces certain disease conditions. He considered digestion to be a kind of putrefaction or decomposition, an idea that was held until the 19th century. Praxagoras was also influential in the Alexandrian school in particular. After the death of Alexander the Great (356-323 BC), Egypt fell to the hands of General Ptolemy, who established a modern university with the first great medical school of antiquity. Human dissection was practiced, mostly by Herophilus and Erasistratus; Praxagoras was Herophilus' teacher. Although the university in Alexandria and its massive library was destroyed by bands of conquerors, later Arabic physicians made the efforts to preserve some of the writings. After the fall of the Byzantine Empire, Greek scholars brought back Greek medicine to the medical schools of the Western Renaissance. Praxagoras' theory of circulation Praxagoras studied Aristotle's (384-322 BC) anatomy and improved it by distinguishing between artery and veins. He saw arteries as air tubes, similar to the trachea and bronchi, which carried pneuma, the mystic force of life.Pendergraph, Garland E. (1998) Handbook of Phlebotomy and Patient Service and Techniques. Williams & Wilkins. Arteries took the breath of life from the lungs to the left side of the heart through the aorta to the arteries of the body. He believed the arteries stemmed from the heart, but the veins came from the liver. Veins carried blood, which was created by digested food, to the rest of the body. The combination of blood and pneuma generated heat. As one of the humors, thick, cold phlegm gathered in the arteries would cause paralysis. Also, he believed that arteries were the channels through which voluntary motion was given to the body, and that the cause of epilepsy was the blocking of the aorta by this same accumulation of phlegm. Aristotle, Diocles, and Praxogoras insisted that the heart was the central organ of intelligence and the seat of thought. Praxagoras differed with the others in that he believed the purpose of respiration was to provide nourishment for the psychic pneuma, rather than to cool the inner heat. =Arteries and pulse= Praxagoras' views on arteries were very influential in the development of physiology. Since the concept of nerves did not exist, Praxagoras explained the movement of arteries to the fact that arteries get smaller and smaller, and then disappear. This disappearance caused movement, a fact now attributed to nerves. However, he speculated about the role of movement and was satisfied that he had found the answer of the center of vitality and energy. His pupil, Herophilus, actually discovered both sensory and motor nerves. Praxagoras was interested in pulse and was the first to direct attention to the importance of arterial pulse in diagnosis. He insisted that arteries pulsed by themselves and were independent of the heart. Herophilus refuted this doctrine in his treatise \\"On Pulses.\\" In another area, Galen criticized Praxagoras for displaying too little care in anatomy. He suggested that Praxagoras did not arrive at his theories by dissection. The beliefs of Praxagoras held sway for centuries. For example, for nearly 500 years after his death, many still believed that arteries did not contain blood but pneuma. His most famous pupil, Herophilus, was instrumental in establishing the marvelous medical establishment at Alexandria.

Career As incumbent Chief Clerk of the War Department, on October 22, 1816, he was designated Acting Secretary by James Madison following William H. Crawford's promotion to the Department of the Treasury until Crawford's successor John C. Calhoun arrived and took over as Secretary on October 8, 1817. Outside of his Cabinet service, he is best known for a mission to Galveston Island, Texas to persuade the small Bonapartist colony of Champ d'Asile to accept American jurisdiction. There he met with privateer Jean Laffite. This voyage is considered the first Anglo- American account of a sea voyage to Texas. Graham fell ill with acute dysentery on his return trip from Champ d'Asile, but was healed by Atakapa natives. He was president of the Washington branch of the Bank of the United States, 1819‚Äì1823, and commissioner of the U.S. land office, 18231830. Death Graham died in Washington, D.C. on August 26, 1830.

Home Alive once operated as a non-profit organization and now continues to operate as a volunteer collective. Home Alive sees its work as integrated into larger social justice movements, recognizing how violence is often perpetuated through oppression and abuse. Home Alive classes included basic physical self-defense, boundary setting, and advanced multi- week courses.Mia Zapata: Home Alive History Following the rape and murder of local singer Mia Zapata in 1993, a number of artists and musicians within Seattle began to meet and discuss the problems of violence within the community, and the lack of available resources such as self-defense classes, which were considered impractical and somewhat unaffordable.Home Alive The birth of this organization was informal, with meetings originating as heated discussions in the living rooms of concerned women from the scene. However the group had trouble deciding how to organize and agreeing on the best methods of self-defense training to teach, so they chose to bring in teachers to help direct the course of their learning. This group of women, now recognized as the founders of the organization, pooled resources such as arts and music benefits in order to raise funds and study self-defense. Classes were provided to the community originally for free, but then later on a sliding scale basis. This change occurred because the founders were advised not to offer the classes for free because attendees would not value the class if they did not pay for it. However, no one was turned away due to lack of funds. The group continues this work, providing classes to individuals, as before; but expanding to also educate establishments such as schools and businesses. With primary support still coming from the arts community, Home Alive continues to ground its self-defense education in a movement for social justice. Violence occurs in childhood sexual abuse, date rape, intimate partner violence, and sexual harassment. The founders tried out other self-defense classes but they found them lacking due to prices, and they offered restrictive rules for women. These rules included how women should dress conservatively and to never walk alone, thus this was another decision to create Home Alive. Home Alive offers tools, not rules, to everyone seeking more safety and connection in their lives. They promote consensual behavior, and believe that we all have a responsibility to respect each other's boundaries and right to self- determination. Home Alive taught not only physical self-defense but as well verbal boundaries like saying \\"no\\" when feeling uncomfortable, escape route techniques and much others including going to a therapist, writing in a journal, talking to friends and exercising. For the organization self-defense meant to do anything to make oneself feel strong and able to take care of oneself in order to feel safer.\\"About.\\" Home Alive. Home Alive moved to the Capitol Hill district in 2004. On June 14, 2010 members of Home Alive's Board of Directors, together with the instructor collective, decided to close as a 501(c)(3) organization and to lay the Home Alive program dormant after 17 years in the community. They announced their decision to close in an email sent out to the Home Alive and Capitol Hill community, choosing to celebrate their years of work with an all ages party at Hidmo Eritrean cuisine featuring live music and an open mic. Home Alive included suggestions for other self- defense organizations in the wake of their closure such as INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence and Northwest Network as well as others. Deactivation occurred because of how difficult it was to maintain non-profit structure for the organization, as well as finding space and dependable funding. Members also found it difficult to maintain consistent leadership for the group, causing it to fall into disorganization. Home Alive consequently decided to move away from the formalized government structure of a non-profit and instead chose to create a website teaching self-defense. The website includes all of the curriculum and became volunteer-based. Since 2010 they have strayed away from the non-profit aspect of the organization and instead formed a small, loosely functioning volunteer collective. They also teach a handful of classes at high schools and for other progressive organizations. They have their curriculum available online for all to use. On July 3, 2012 four Home Alive instructors, with the assistance of a few dedicated community members, launched a new website, Teach Home Alive, a site dedicated to archiving and sharing Home Alive's curriculum. Other resources There are other resources that are available to victims as well as people looking to prevent violence against women or other groups. One of these is Her Wits About Her: a powerful anthology that relates dozens of true self-defense success stories by women, dispelling the pervasive myth that it's better not to fight back. This book demonstrates how often a combination of strategies (yelling, negotiating, striking, positive self talk) can be incredibly effective in dangerous situations. Home Alive co-founder Cristien Storm's first book Living in Liberation: Boundary Setting, Self-Care and Social Change is a great visionary resource. Cristien argues that responses to violence can and should embody boundary setting, self care, and self-defense skills that interrupt victim- blaming, fear-based approaches and locate healing within the social context of community. This groundbreaking text roots boundary setting and self care in larger visions of happier and healthier communities, all the while holding on to the complexities of individual safety and social justice. Benefit shows Many live music venues in Seattle, San Francisco, and New York organized shows to benefit Home Alive, where there would be music and spoken word performances. These performances were put on by a variety of people including bands, such as The Posies, and founders of Home Alive, such as Christien Storm, who performed spoken word, Valerie Agnew, who performed with her band 7 Year Bitch, and Gretta Harley, who performed with her band Maxi Bad. The first show took place at Seattle venue, RKCNDY (also known as Rock Candy). During these shows organizers and volunteers would talk about Home Alive and there would be tables with information about Home Alive, as well. In addition to being fundraisers for Home Alive, these benefit shows were also used as a \\"[way] to bring the music and arts communities together around tragedy, violence, and oppression\\" to \\"find ways to proactively address these issues.\\" While funds from the shows went towards providing self-defense classes, it did not always go directly to Home Alive. In the case of shows put on in February and March 1996, the money was put into a bank account with the intent of inspiring other organizations to provide self-defense classes, which would be supported using funds from the bank account. If no one used the money within one year, it would be \\"donated to women's shelters in the communities where the shows [took] place.\\" In more current events, partial proceeds from Capitol Hill Block Party in 2008 were also donated to Home Alive as well as in 2006 and 2007.Seling, Megan. \\"2008 Capitol Hill Block Party Line-Up: Vampire Weekend, Les Savy Fav, the Hold Steady, Girl Talk, Chromeo, and More!\\", The Stranger, Seattle, 15 April 2008. Retrieved on 3 June 2014. In 2008 the University of Washington put on a performance of the Vagina Monologues, and the proceeds from the show went the organization. CD and contributions Joan Jett, contributor to Home Alive Home Alive took hold by spreading the word to the community by making posters, zines, and newsletters. They organized benefit concerts, taught classes, and wrote the curriculum for the organization. As well they compiled a CD called Home Alive: the Art of Self Defense which included 44 tracks from various artists. The CD label was produced by Sony. Co-founder Gretta Harley was instrumental in helping produce the album. The CD included songs of empowerment, self-awareness, experiences with violence. Some tracks here were meant as goodbye songs, some are poems, and others merely rants. But there's no CD or \\"tribute\\" like it. Violent, intense and passionate, it pulls off the trick of pulling life from death. The artists included many Seattle local bands who wanted to contribute like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. The CD compilation gained recognition worldwide. Kathleen Hanna, lead singer of the Seattle punk band Bikini Kill and kick-starter of the Riot grrrl feminist movement, also appears on the album. The track Leaving Here on the album, covered by Pearl Jam, peaked as 24th in Mainstream Rock and 31st in Modern Rock Tracks on Billboard Singles in 1996. In 2001, Home Alive released a second compilation album titled Flying Side Kick. The album features 17 tracks from various artists including The Gossip, Amy Ray and the Butchies, The Need, the Pinkos, Sanford Arms and more. Proceeds from album sales went to Home Alive. Home Alive has received support from Joan Jett through a collaboration with Mia Zapata's former bandmates, The Gits. They performed, with Joan Jett as lead singer, under the name Evil Stig with proceeds benefitting Home Alive. Documentary Rock, Rage & Self Defense: An Oral History on Seattle's Home Alive, a documentary on the collective, was released in 2013. It was a documentary by Rozz Therrien and Leah Michaels, two then-undergraduates at the University of Washington. Therrien graduated with a degree in American Ethnic Studies and Michaels graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in History. Originally just seeking information for class, they came together to create an oral history about the group Home Alive and did not find a lot of information on the Internet. Both Therrien and Michaels did not have any technical background in filmmaking and self-taught each other technical skills. They fundraised $10,000 to make the film in sound editing and to pay off legal fees through the Kickstarter campaign, grants and donations. In 2014 Therrien and Michaels are on tour screening their documentary across the country, and have recently shown support for the feminist movement YesAllWomen on their website in light of the 2014 Isla Vista killings. The creators hosted screenings of the documentary to various cities across the United States, and completed their last screening of their first tour on May 27, 2014.This raised awareness across the country about self-defense and the history of Home Alive. Founders The nine people considered responsible for founding the organization are: *Valerie Agnew *Zoe Bermet *Gretta Harley *Julie Hasse *Lara Kidoguchi *Jessica Lawless *Mich Levy *Cristien Storm *Stacey Wescott Founder statements Cristien Storm (one of the co-founders of Home Alive) stated that when they began the process of their band, everyone she knew was in a band and everyone supported each other throughout the community. Young women made their music as art with a sense of feminism. Home Alive was created to demonstrate a sense of political activism, not just about going to shows and creating music. The bands supported each other and demonstrated collaboration and support through music. Cristien Storm also said that the combination of all the events and experience that they have in their lives contributed to Home Alive. She implied that the murder of Mia Zapata was not the only event that shaped Home Alive, although it is described that way. Zapata's death led to the organization of a collective community, which evolved into Home Alive and the mission to provide affordable self- defense training, education tools and grassroots activism. \\"Most of the courses we found were quite expensive. and what they taught made no sense to us. We're musicians, artists, actors; we work in establishments late at night. They were telling us to change our lives.\\" The group created their own agenda with unconventional classes to cater to people with backgrounds similar to their own.

Unlike the traditional detective who investigates murder and other common crimes, the occult detective is employed in cases involving ghosts, demons, curses, magic, vampires, undead, monsters and other supernatural elements. Some occult detectives are portrayed as being psychic or in possession of other paranormal or magical powers. History = Literature = Fitz James O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs character Harry Escott is a contender for first occult detective in fiction. A specialist in supernatural phenomena, Escott investigates a ghost in \\"The Pot of Tulips\\" (1855) and an invisible entity in \\"What Was It? A Mystery\\" (1859). The narrator of Robert Bulwer-Lytton‚Äôs novella \\"The Haunted and the Haunters; or, The House and the Brain\\" (1859) is another student of the supernatural who probes a mystery involving a culprit with paranormal abilities. Sheridan Le Fanu's Dr. Martin Hesselius appeared in \\"Green Tea\\" (1869) and later became a framing device for Le Fanu's short story collection In a Glass Darkly (1872). For most of its plot, The Hound of the Baskervilles, one of Sherlock Holmes's most well-known adventures, seems to belong in this genre. However, by the story's end the villain turns out to be completely human and mundane, who deliberately created this misleading impression. The next prominent figure in this tradition was Dr. Abraham Van Helsing in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), followed closely by E. and H. Heron's Flaxman Low, featured in a series of stories in Pearson's Magazine (1898‚Äì99), Algernon Blackwood's Dr. John Silence, and William Hope Hodgson's Carnacki the Ghost Finder. Other supernatural sleuths in fiction dating to the late nineteenth century include Alice & Claude Askew's Aylmer Vance and Champion de Crespigny's Norton Vyse. Thomas Carnacki may well be considered one of the first true occult detectives, as he combined both knowledge and experience of what he calls ‚Äúthe ab-natural‚Äù with scientific deductive method and equipment. The adventures of Carnacki have been continued by a number of writers, including A. F. Kidd in collaboration with Rick Kennett in 472 Cheyne Walk: Carnacki, the Untold Stories (2000), William Meikle in Carnacki: Heaven and Hell (Colusa, CA: Ghost House Press, 2011), Brandon Barrows in The Castle-Town Tragedy (Dunhams Manor, 2016), and others. In addition, writers Joshua M Reynolds and John Linwood Grant have each produced a separate series of stories which follow on from Carnacki's death, and feature occult detectives whose work relates to the original tales - The Adventures of the Royal Occultist and Tales of the Last Edwardian respectively. Sax Rohmer's collection The Dream Detective features the occult detective Moris Klaw, who utilises \\"odic force\\" in his investigations. The occultist Dion Fortune made her contribution to the genre with The Secrets of Dr Taverner (1926), consisting of psychic adventures of the Holmes‚Äìlike Taverner as narrated by his assistant, Dr Rhodes. Aleister Crowley's Simon Iff featured in a series of stories, some of which have been collected in book form. Dennis Wheatley's occult detective was Neils Orsen. Though never large, the occult detective subgenre grew to include such writers as Seabury Quinn (with his character Jules de Grandin); Manly Wade Wellman, whose character John Thunstone investigated occult events through short stories in the pulps, collected in The Third Cry to Legba and Other Invocations (2000) and in the novels What Dreams May Come (1983) and The School of Darkness (1985); and \\"Jack Mann\\" (E. C. Vivian), who chronicled the adventure of his occult detective Gregory Gordon George Green, known as \\"Gees\\", in a series of novels. Pulp writer Robert E. Howard created stories about Steve Harrison, an occult detective, in the Strange Detective Stories magazine. Margery Lawrence created the character Miles Pennoyer in her occult detective stories collected in Number Seven, Queer Street. Modern writers who have used the occult detective theme as a basis for supernatural adventures include Peter Saxon (The Guardians series), John Burke (Dr Alex Caspian), Frank Lauria (Dr Owen Orient), Lin Carter (Anton Zarnak), and Joseph Payne Brennan (Lucius Leffing). The occult detective theme has also been used with series characters devised by such contemporary writers as Douglas Adams (Dirk Gently), F. Paul Wilson (the Repairman Jack series), Steve Rasnic Tem (Charlie Goode), Jessica Amanda Salmonson (Miss Penelope Pettiweather), David Rowlands (Father O'Connor), Rick Kennett (Ernie Pine), Brian Lumley (Titus Crow), Robert Weinberg (Sydney Taine), Simon R. Green (John Taylor), Steve Niles (Cal McDonald), Mike Carey (Felix Castor), Mercedes Lackey (Diana Tregarde), Laurell K. Hamilton (Anita Blake), Brian Keene (Levi Stoltzfus), Jonathan L. Howard (Johannes Cabal), and Jonathan Maberry (Sam Hunter). Jim Butcher's best-selling book series The Dresden Files is another well-known example. Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy stories and Dean Koontz's The Haunted Earth are examples in which occult detectives operate in a world where the occult is simply an accepted part of mundane life. Assaph Mehr's Stories of Togas, Daggers, and Magic combine historical mystery detective in ancient Rome with fantasy and occult elements. A useful recent anthology collecting specimens of the genre is Mark Valentine, ed., The Black Veil & Other Tales of Supernatural Sleuths (), published by Wordsworth Editions in 2009. Earlier themed anthologies include Stephen Jones, ed., Dark Detectives: Adventures of the Supernatural Sleuths (Fedogan & Bremer, 1998) and Peter Haining, ed., Supernatural Sleuths: Stories of Occult Investigators (William Kimber, 1986). The magazine Occult Detective Quarterly (Electric Pentacle Press, 2016) specialises in presenting a wide range of new occult detective tales set in a range of time periods, with the occasional pastiche of classic figures from this branch of fiction. = Film and television = In the 1970s, there were a number of attempts at occult detective television series. While not overtly occult detectives, the heroes and heroine of the ITC cult classic sci-fi thriller series, The Champions inherited occult powers from a Tibetan lama and used these powers to investigate crime. Other examples include Fear No Evil (1969) and its sequel, Ritual of Evil (1970), starring Louis Jourdan as psychologist David Sorrell; The Sixth Sense (TV series) (1972) starring Gary Collins as a psychic investigator; The Norliss Tapes (1973) with Roy Thinnes as a reporter investigating the supernatural; Baffled! (1973), a British production with Leonard Nimoy and Susan Hampshire vs. an evil occult society; Spectre (1977), starring Robert Culp and Gig Young as criminologists turned demonologists; The World of Darkness (1977) and its sequel, The World Beyond (1978), starring Granville Van Dusen as a man who battles the supernatural following his own near death experience. The most successful effort of this period was the short-lived television series, Kolchak: The Night Stalker (1974‚Äì75), starring Darren McGavin; the weekly series was based on two backdoor pilots (The Night Stalker and The Night Strangler) produced by Dan Curtis and scripted by Richard Matheson, based on an unpublished work by Jeff Rice. Kolchak's adventures have been continued in books by Rice and in the comic book Kolchak Tales. Matheson's Kolchak Scripts have also been published. The Saturday morning cartoon Scooby-Doo followed an occult detective format, though in the earlier series the apparent occult influences were all revealed as (fully natural) tricksters. In the wake of Scooby-Doo's success, several of the follow-ups from Hanna-Barbera involved varying degrees of occult and supernatural influence, including Goober and the Ghost Chasers, The Funky Phantom, and some of the 1980s entries in the Scooby-Doo franchise. To keep the plotlines suitable for Saturday morning audiences, the occult villains were kept family-friendly. More recent examples include: Angel Heart, The Believers, Constantine, The Dresden Files, The Exorcist III, Grimm, Split Second, Lord of Illusions, Penny Dreadful, R.I.P.D., Special Unit 2, Supernatural, Twin Peaks, Vidocq, The X-Files, Millennium, Angel (1999 TV series), The Vampire Detective = Comics, manga, and anime = Dr. Occult, created by Jerry Siegel and Jerome Schuster, was one of the earliest occult detectives in comic books with a 1935 debut. Dr. Occult was first a costumed superhero but his appearance quickly changed to a more typical detective (Fedora hat and long coat). The Phantom Stranger, created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, first appeared in an eponymous six-issue comics anthology published in 1952, first as a debunker of fake supernatural events but later incarnations showed him with mystical or supernatural abilities. Dr. Occult and the Phantom Stranger were both published by DC Comics, with Occult falling into obscurity for decades before a 1980s revival, while the Phantom Stranger appeared steadily from his debut if mostly in a supporting role. The comic book Hellblazer began in the 1980s and boosted the popularity and image of the occult detective fiction genre and shaped it to its modern form. p. 585-586 Many modern examples of the genre such as Hellboy, Supernatural, Grimm, The Originals, and The Dresden Files have been influenced by it, March 15, 2012 September 10, 2014 and many imitators of both the series and its character flourished such as Criminal Macabre, Gravel, Planetary, and others. August 16, 2010 Its elements and style have been used countless of times in other works and many analogues of the cynical protagonist John Constantine have appeared. November 13, 2012 Examples of occult detectives in comic books include Doctor Spektor from Gold Key Comics, Hellboy from the Dark Horse series of same name, Dylan Dog from the Sergio Bonelli Editore series, Nightlinger by Steven Philip Jones and published by Caliber Comics, and Martin Hel a character created by Robin Wood. Two Hellblazer writers have gone on to write their own occult detective characters: Sebastian O also at Vertigo by Grant Morrison and Warren Ellis' Gravel from Avatar Press. 2000 AD has featured a number over the years in their own eponymous series: Bix Barton, Devlin Waugh, Ampney Crucis Investigates and Dandridge. The occult detective team of Syd Deadlocke and Doc Martin, featured in Pulse of Darkness and other comics by Chris G.C. Sequeira, also fits into this genre. There is also the comic book series Ruse, once owned by CrossGen and now by Marvel Comics. Examples in manga and anime include Majin Tantei N≈çgami Neuro, Mushishi, YuYu Hakusho, Ghost Hunt, 'Mononoke', Death Note, Ghosts at School, Bakemonogatari and Nightwalker: The Midnight Detective. = Video and computer games = * Alpha Polaris * Amnesia series ** Amnesia: The Dark Descent ** Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs * Asylum * The Adventures of Dog Mendon√ßa & Pizzaboy * Barrow Hill series ** Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle ** Barrow Hill: The Dark Path * Betrayer * The Black Mirror series ** The Black Mirror ** Black Mirror II: Reigning Evil ** Black Mirror III: Final Fear ** Black Mirror * Blackwell series ** The Blackwell Legacy ** Blackwell Unbound ** The Blackwell Convergence ** The Blackwell Deception ** The Blackwell Epiphany * Call of Cthulhu * Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth * Clive Barker's Undying * Clock Tower series ** Clock Tower (1995) ** Clock Tower (1996) ** Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within ** Clock Tower 3 * Condemned series ** Condemned: Criminal Origins ** Condemned 2: Bloodshot * Cryostasis: Sleep of Reason * D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die * Daemonica * Dark Fall series ** Dark Fall: The Journal ** Dark Fall II: Lights Out ** Dark Fall: Lost Souls * Dark Seed series ** Dark Seed ** Dark Seed II * Darkness Within series ** Darkness Within: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder ** Darkness Within 2: The Dark Lineage * Dead Reefs * Discworld_Noir * Dracula series ** Dracula: Resurrection ** Dracula 2: The Last Sanctuary ** Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon ** Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon ** Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy * Echo Night series ** Echo Night ** Echo Night 2: The Lord of Nightmares ** Echo Night: Beyond * Gabriel Knight series ** Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers ** The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery (also known as Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within) ** Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned * Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective * Gray Dawn * The Lost Crown: A Ghost-Hunting Adventure * Memento Mori series ** Memento Mori ** Memento Mori 2 * Murdered: Soul Suspect * Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness (also known as Necronomicon: The Gateway to Beyond) * Nocturne * Pathologic * Penumbra series ** Penumbra: Overture ** Penumbra: Black Plague ** Penumbra: Requiem * Phantasmagoria ** Phantasmagoria ** Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh (also known as Phantasmagoria 2) * Return of the Obra Dinn * Rhiannon: Curse of the Four Branches * Sanitarium * Scratches * Shadow of Memories * Silverload * The Vanishing of Ethan Carter * The Wolf Among Us * The X-Files Game See also *List of science fiction and fantasy detectives References Category:Fantasy tropes Category:Low fantasy Category:Fantasy genres ","title":"Occult detective fiction"},{"id":"3015942","text":"The National Origins Formula was an American system of immigration quotas, used between 1921 and 1965, which restricted immigration on the basis of existing proportions of the population. It aimed to reduce the overall number of unskilled immigrants (especially from Southern Europe, Eastern Europe and Asia), to allow families to re-unite, and to prevent immigration from changing the ethnic distribution of the largely Protestant population of Northwestern European Americans.  History  The 1921 Emergency Quota Act restricted immigration to 3% of foreign-born persons of each nationality that resided in the United States in 1910. The Immigration Act of 1924, also called the National Origins Act, provided that for three years the formula would change from 3% to 2% and the basis for the calculation would be the census of 1890 instead of that of 1910. After June 30, 1927, total immigration from all countries will be limited to 150,000, with allocations by country based upon national origins of inhabitants according to the census of 1920. The quota system applied only to non-Asian immigrants. It aimed to reduce the overall number of unskilled immigrants, to allow families to re-unite, and to prevent immigration from changing the ethnic distribution of the population. The 1924 Act also included the Asian Exclusion Act, which limited immigration to persons eligible for naturalization. As a result, East Asians and South Asians were effectively banned from immigrating. Africans were also subjected to severe restrictions. Immigration from North and South America was not restricted. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 retained but relaxed the National Origins Formula. It modified the ratios to be based on the 1920 census and eliminated racial restrictions, but retained restrictions by national origin. President Harry Truman vetoed it because of its continued use of national quotas, but the Act was passed over his veto. The quotas were in addition to 600,000 refugees admitted from Europe after World War II.David M. Reimers, Unwelcome Strangers (1998), 26 The National Origins Formula was abolished by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which marked a significant change in American immigration policy. It replaced the system with two quotas for the Western and Eastern hemispheres.

It is a Grade I listed building. The house has a long crenelated fa√ßade directly facing the main road, at the centre of which is the Tudor Gatehouse, dating from 1530; this has hexagonal turrets and oriel windows in the English Renaissance style. The gatehouse is the oldest part of the house and is flanked by later wings, in the Strawberry Hill Gothic style, popularised by Horace Walpole. History The Coughton estate has been owned by the Throckmorton family since 1409. The estate was acquired through marriage to the De Spinney family.Peter Marshall. Catholic Gentry in English Society: The Throckmortons of Coughton from Reformation to Emancipation, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., Nov 17, 2009. Google eBook Coughton was rebuilt by Sir George Throckmorton, the first son of Sir Robert Throckmorton of Coughton Court by Catherine Marrow, daughter of William Marrow of London. The great gatehouse at Coughton was dedicated to King Henry VIII by Throckmorton, a favourite of the King. Throckmorton would become notorious due to his almost fatal involvement in the divorce between King Henry and his first wife Catherine of Aragon. Throckmorton favoured the queen and was against the Reformation. Throckmorton spent most of his life rebuilding Coughton.The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1509-1558, ed. S.T. Bindoff, 1982. Article: THROCKMORTON, Sir George (by 1489-1552), of Coughton, Warws. In 1549, when he was planning the windows in the great hall, he asked his son Nicholas to obtain from the heralds the correct tricking (colour abbreviations) of the arms of his ancestors' wives and his own cousin and niece by marriage Queen Catherine Parr (see gallery drawing). The costly recusancy (refusal to attend Anglican Church services) of Robert Throckmorton and his heirs restricted later rebuilding, so that much of the house still stands largely as he left it. After Throckmorton's death in 1552, Coughton passed to his eldest son, Robert. Robert Throckmorton and his family were practicing Catholics therefore the house at one time contained a priest hole, a hiding place for priests during the period when Catholics were persecuted by law in England, from the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth I of England. The Hall also holds a place in English history for its roles in both the Throckmorton Plot of 1583 to murder Queen Elizabeth, and the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, although the Throckmorton family were themselves only indirectly implicated in the latter, when some of the Gunpowder conspirators rode directly there after its discovery. The house has been in the ownership of the National Trust since 1946. The family, however, hold a 300-year lease and previously managed the property on behalf of the Trust. In 2007, however, the house reverted to management by the National Trust. The management of the property is renewed every 10 years. The family tenant was Clare McLaren- Throckmorton, known professionally as Clare Tritton QC, until she died on 31 October 2017. The house, which is open to the public all year round, is set in extensive grounds including a walled formal garden, a river and a lake. Architecture The gatehouse at Coughton was built at the earliest in 1536, as it is built of stones which came from Bordesley Abbey and Evesham Abbey after the Dissolution of the Monasteries Act in 1536. As with other Tudor houses, it was built around a courtyard, with the gatehouse used for deliveries and coaches to travel through to the courtyard.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-305306-coughton-court- coughton-warwickshire#.VTQTCs6ghUQ The courtyard was closed on all four sides until 1651, when Parliamentary soldiers burnt the fourth (east) wing, along with many of the Throckmorton's family papers, during the English Civil War. After the Roman Catholic Relief Act was passed in 1829, the Throckmorton family were able to afford large-scale building works, allowing them to remodel the west front.  In popular culture  The house was used as a filming location for the BBC One series Father Brown in the episode The Mask of the Demon.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4860336/ Gallery Coughtoncourtmorris edited.jpgCoughton Court in the late 19th century Coughton Court east view.jpgCoughton Court courtyard Coughton Court gatehouse - geograph.org.uk - 1362441.jpgCoughton Court gatehouse Coughton Court - geograph.org.uk - 51904.jpgCoughton Court facade Wenceslas Hollar - Coughton (Throckmorton).jpgArmorials depicted in windows of Coughton Court, by Wenceslaus Hollar (d. 1677) Coughton Courtyard 2017.jpgOld Buildings in Coughton Courtyard See also *Hampton Court Palace *Throckmorton Baronets References * * Coughton Court (1979) Booklet for National Trust by J Lees- Milne. * External links *Official website *Coughton Court at nationaltrust.org.uk Category:Country houses in Warwickshire Category:National Trust properties in Warwickshire Category:Grade I listed buildings in Warwickshire Category:Grade I listed houses Category:Historic house museums in Warwickshire es:Coughton Court#top ","title":"Coughton Court"},{"id":"3016006","title":"Ikuhisa Minowa"},{"id":"3016017","text":"The Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles is a community of 48,874 Episcopalians in 147 congregations, 40 schools, and 18 major institutions, spanning all of Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties, and part of Riverside County.

It is run at the U.S. Army Engineer School in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, United States and lasts nineteen weeks and four days. Once a United States Army officer has been commissioned and selected for the Corps of Engineers, they are sent to EBOLC to learn combat engineering, general engineering, and geospatial engineering. With few exceptions, attendees will be the rank of Second Lieutenant who have recently commissioned. While attending, the officer will become a part of B Company, 554th Engineer Battalion, 1st Engineer Brigade receiving instruction from the U.S. Army Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCoE). At EBOLC, students spend the first 4 weeks conducting basic tactics, field craft, close quarters combat, and marksmanship. It is followed by a defensive module, an offensive module, a general engineering module, and a stability module. During the general engineering module, officers learn and are tested on military bridging, horizontal and vertical construction and military demolitions, including mine detection. They also conduct several field training exercise where students lead combat engineering missions. Once completed, most graduates are sent to engineer units where they will serve as platoon leaders and in various staff roles.

He taught and practiced the kavanot of the Rashash. His blessings and amulets were also widely sought to cure people of illnesses and infertility. In his life, he published no religious articles or books. At the time of his death, estimates of his age ranged from 103 to 108, and his birth year is still disputed. His funeral, which was held in Jerusalem drew over half a million followers in what was described as the largest funeral in Israel's history. Early life He was born in Baghdad, some say in 1902, although his true birth year isn't known for sure, in what was then part of the Ottoman Turkish vilayets. His father, Rabbi Katchouri Diba ben Aziza, was a spice trader. This birth year was published in Mishpacha magazine from a live interview with the rabbi in 2005. As a youngster, Kaduri excelled in his studies and began learning Kabbalah while still in his teens, a study that would last his entire life. He was a child student of the Ben Ish Chai (Rabbi Yosef Chaim of Baghdad, d. 1909) and studied at the Zilka Yeshivah in Baghdad. Rabbi Kaduri moved to the British Mandate of Palestine (Eretz Israel, the Holy Land) in 1923. It was here that he changed his name from Diba to Kaduri. Student of Kabbalah He went to study at the Shoshanim LeDavid Yeshiva for kabbalists from Iraq. There he learned from the leading kabbalists of the time, including Rabbi Yehuda Ftaya, author of Beit Lechem Yehudah, and Rabbi Yaakov Chaim Sofer, author of Kaf Hachaim. He later immersed himself in regular Talmudic study and rabbinical law in the Porat Yosef Yeshiva in Jerusalem's Old City, where he also studied Kabbalah with the Rosh Yeshivah, Rabbi Ezra Attiya, Rabbi Saliman Eliyahu (father of Sephardic Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu), and other learned rabbis. In 1934, Rabbi Kaduri and his family moved to the Old City, where the Porat Yosef Yeshivah gave him an apartment nearby with a job of binding the yeshivah's books and copying over rare manuscripts in the yeshivah's library. The books remained in the yeshivah's library, while the copies of manuscripts were stored in Rabbi Kaduri's personal library. Before binding each book, he would study it intently, committing it to memory. He was reputed to have photographic memory and also mastered the Talmud by heart, including the adjoining Rashi and Tosafot commentaries. During the period of Arab-Israeli friction that led up to the Israeli war of Independence, the Porat Yosef Yeshivah was virtually turned into a fortress against frequent flashes of violence. When the Jewish quarter of the Old City fell to the invading Jordanian Army, the Jordanians set fire to the yeshivah and all surrounding houses, destroying all the books and manuscripts that Rabbi Kaduri could not smuggle to Beit El Yeshiva (Yeshivat HaMekubalim) in Jerusalem. He knew all the writings of Rabbi Yitzhak Luria, the founder of modern Kabbalah by heart. After the passing of the leading kabbalist, Rabbi Efraim Hakohen, in 1989, the remaining kabbalists appointed Rabbi Kaduri as their head. Rabbi Kaduri did not publish any of the works that he authored on Kabbalah; he allowed only students of Kabbalah to study them. He did publish some articles criticizing those who engage in \\"practical Kabbalah\\", the popular dissemination of advice or amulets, often for a price. Kadouri said \\"It is forbidden to teach a non-Jew Kabbalah, not even Talmud, not even simple Torah;\\" perhaps referring to pop celebrity Madonna's publicised interest in Kabbalah; he also said that women (even Jewish) are not allowed to study Kabbalah. Blessings, amulets and prophecies Over the years, thousands of people (mainly but not exclusively Sephardi Jews) would come to seek his advice, blessings and amulets which he would create specifically for the individual in need. He had learned the Kabbalistic secrets of the amulets from his teacher, Rabbi Yehuda Fatiyah. Many people directly attributed personal miracles to receiving a blessing from Rabbi Kaduri, such as recovery from severe illnesses and diseases, children born to couples with fertility problems, finding a spouse, and economic blessings. His rise to fame, though, began when his son, Rabbi David Kaduri, who ran a poultry store in the Bukharim Market, decided to found a proper yeshivah organization under his father. Called Nachalat Yitzchak yeshiva, it was located adjacent to the family home in the Bukharim neighbourhood of Jerusalem. His grandson, Yossi Kaduri, took part in this endeavour with him Kaduri was seen as a prophesier. In late 2004, Kaduri said \\"Great tragedies in the world are foreseen\\" two weeks before the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami; reporter Baruch Gordon of Arutz Sheva connected the two by saying Kaduri \\"predicted\\" the tragedy. Political involvement The last two decades of his life were marred by the controversial way that some would use him to promote various political parties during Israeli elections. Rabbi Kaduri achieved celebrity status during the 1996 Knesset elections when he was flown by helicopter to multiple political rallies in support of the Shas party, and for amulets that were produced in his name for supporters of that party. In October 1997, Benjamin Netanyahu, then in his first term as Prime Minister of Israel, came to visit Kaduri at his synagogue and was recorded as whispering in his ear \\"the left has forgotten what it is to be a Jew\\". This was considered as a divisive action and resonated in the press. Final days and death The funeral procession in front of the Nachalat Yitzchak Yeshiva, David St., Bucharim neighbourhood, Jerusalem Tombstone of the Rosh HaMekubalim Yitzhak Kaduri Kaduri lived a life of poverty and simplicity. He ate little, spoke little, and prayed each month at the gravesites of tzaddikim in Israel. His first wife, Rabbanit Sara, died in 1989. He remarried in 1993 to Rabbanit Dorit, a baalat teshuva just over half his age. In January 2006, Rabbi Kaduri was hospitalized with pneumonia in the Bikur Holim Hospital in Jerusalem, where there wasn't an automatic artificial respirator, which was donated by a close person. He died at around 10 p.m. January 28, 2006 (29 Tevet 5766). He was alert and lucid until his last day. An estimated 300,000 people took part in his funeral procession on January 29, which started from the Nachalat Yitzchak Yeshivah and wound its way through the streets of Jerusalem to the Givat Shaul cemetery near the entrance to the city of Jerusalem. Mashiach The note in question, sealed to be opened posthumously Before his death, Kaduri had said that he expected the Mashiach, the Jewish Messiah, to arrive soon, and that he had met him a year earlier. It has been alleged that he left a hand-written note to his followers and they were reportedly instructed to only open the note after Rabbi Kaduri had been dead for one year. After this time period had passed, the note was opened by these followers and was found to read, \\"\\" (translated as \\"he will raise the people and confirm that his word and law are standing\\"), which by acronym, suggested the name \\"Yehoshua\\". Such acrostics are a well recognised phenomenon in the Tanakh. Many religious Jews and counter missionaries discredit the note as a Messianic Jewish forgery. Rabbi Tovia Singer suggests that when considering the context of the note, the name Yehoshua may refer to the biblical Yehoshua Ben Nun, rather than to Jesus Christ whose original Jewish Hebrew name is traditionally believed to be the shortened version of Yeshua. \\"Yehoshua\\" in the original Greek Septuagint and New Testament is also directly transliterated as 'Jesus'. Singer also claimed that no member of Kaduri's family he spoke to 'knew anything about this note', but it is Kaduri's disciples who publicized the note and posted it on Kaduri's website.

It is semi-autobiographical in nature, describing the King's capture by the English in 1406 on his way to France and his subsequent imprisonment by Henry IV of England and his successors, Henry V and Henry VI.  Summary  The poem begins with the narrator who, alone and unable to sleep, begins to read Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy. At first, he reads in the hope that it will help him get back to sleep, but he quickly becomes interested in the text and its treatment of Boethius' own experience of misfortune. At last, he begins to think about his own youthful experience, and how he came to a life of misery. On hearing the Matins bell, he rises and begins to write a poem describing his fate. He begins with a sea voyage taken when he was twelve years of age, when he was captured and imprisoned for eighteen years. Whilst in prison, he feels isolated, believing himself to be the most miserable man living. The sight of birds singing outside his prison window draws him back into the outside world. Looking out, he sees a beautiful woman, and falls in love. This woman is ultimately to be the means of his liberation, and this sequence of events closely parallels the biography of James I of Scotland. James's imprisonment came to an end with his marriage to Joan Beaufort whose name may be punningly referenced in the 'flour jonettis' which the beloved lady wears in her hair (stanza 47). When the lady departs, the narrator becomes desperately sad, and eventually falls into a trance. In a dream, he visits three goddesses, who address his love-problem. The first, Venus, admits that she has no authority in this case, and directs him to Minerva, who probes the nature of his love. Once satisfied that his desires are pure, rather than being simple lust, she advises him on the nature of free will, telling him that he must cultivate wisdom if he is to avoid being prey to changing fortunes. Finally, he descends to the earthly paradise, where he sees Fortune and her wheel, which fill him with fear. Fortune sets him to climb on her wheel, and, as she pinches his ear, he awakes. Consumed by doubt, the narrator is reassured by the appearance of a turtle dove carrying a message, signalling the beneficent quality of his vision. The narrator claims that Fortune kept her promise to him by increasing his wisdom, so that he is now in a state of happiness with his beloved. The poem closes with the narrator offering thanks to all the that, at the end of the poem, brought about his good fortune, and a dedication to the 'poetis laureate' Geoffrey Chaucer and John Gower. The poem's penultimate verse repeats its first line, 'heigh in the hevynnis figure circulere', so that its structure echoes that of the celestial spheres that it evokes. = Rhyming Scheme = The Kingis Quair uses the Chaucerian rhyme scheme rhyme royal: ABABBCC. The form was once thought to have been named for James I's usage, but scholars have since argued that it was named for its reference to the French chant royal.

Early life and World War II He was born in Sauherad in Telemark, to a father from √òyer and a mother from H√∏land. He lived initially in Saltdal and later, Bod√∏. His job was at the Nordland Line. He was a member of the Norwegian Red Cross Youth, and served in the Norwegian Army during the Battle of Narvik in 1940. He fled Norway for Sweden in 1941, and later continued to the United Kingdom. Here he joined the Special Operations Executive and underwent training for the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (Kompani Linge). His first operation was on 27 May 1941 when he set the machine room of the fish factory in Bod√∏ on fire. =Operation Musketoon= In 1942 he participated in the commando raid against the Glomfjord power plant (Glomfjord kraftverk) during Operation Musketoon. Granlund and Cpl. Erling Djupdraet were the two Norwegians in the twelve man team, the rest of whom were British. He and Captain Joseph Houghton had the role of scouts, ascending the Svartisen. Granlund shot and killed a German who was dozing at the plant. After the explosions had torn apart the local dam, he sought refuge at Fykandalen, a mountain resort where he was given a map to a bridge that would lead him further up on the mountain. Unable to find the bridge by nightfall, he met up with Houghton and Sergeant Erling Djupdraet and the three returned to the resort where a scuffle broke out between the group and some Germans who had come to question the owners. After the fight, with one German killed, one wounded and Djupdraet wounded by a bayonet, Trigg, O'Brien, Granlund and Fairclough split off and managed to avoid capture, escaping to Stockholm, then London. Erling Djupdraet died on 24 September at the hospital in Bod√∏ and of the rest, only Lance Sergeant Richard O'Brien and Private John Fairclough, survived the war. The distance from Bj√¶rangfjord to Sweden walked on foot by Granlund was and took him over seven days, with practically no food and only wearing his uniform. =Operation Seagull= He died at sea on 10 February 1943 in transit to Norway, when the Norwegian submarine hit a German minefield southwest of Fugl√∏yv√¶r, carrying his team as part of Operation Seagull.

Name The name comes from the coat of shells these creatures are said to wear, which rattle upon movement. Distribution Many places on the coast of Scotland have names that reference the shellycoat. Supposedly, shellycoats are particularly fond of the area around the River Hermitage. Characteristics Shellycoats are considered to be relatively harmless; they may mislead wanderers, particularly those they think are trespassing upon the creature's territory, but without malice.Briggs, pp. 58‚Äì59. A common tactic of a shellycoat would be to cry out as if drowning and then laugh at the distracted victim. As described above, the shellycoat shares many of the traits of the Brag, Kelpie and Nix.  Schellenrock  Jacob Grimm stated in his Deutsche MythologieChapter 17, p. 4. that the Scottish goblin Shellycoat is one and the same as the German Schellenrock, that is bell-coat: Thomas Keightly quotes Grimm and classifies the shellycoat as a type of brownie.:Keightly, 1870, in the section \\"Brownie\\". The domestic nature of the shellycoat emphasized by Grimm and Keightly stands in contradistinction to the wild nature of the water sprites mentioned in other sources.

Early years Lara (birth name: Agust√≠n Enrique Lara Olivencia ) was born in R√≠o Piedras, Puerto Rico. Lara was raised by his maternal grandmother and received primary education in Santurce. During his spare time, he taught himself to play the guitar. In 1942, when was only 10 years old, his grandmother realized that her grandson had musical talent and took him to WNEL, the local radio station, where he made his debut. In 1946, Lara enrolled at the Free School of Music in San Juan, where he continued his guitar studies and learned to play the trumpet.Tito Lara Tr√≠o Los Lirios In 1948, Lara and eleven fellow students created an ensemble with Lara as lead singer. In 1949, Lara formed a trio called Tr√≠o Los Lirios which became a regular guest on the WKAQ radio station. They were paid 2 American dollars per appearance. Recording debut Lara enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico to study Liberal Arts and joined the university's choir. In 1950, the owner of Mard√≠ Records heard and was impressed by Lara's singing and asked him to form a quartet including a female voice. Lara did so, was signed by Mard√≠ Records and dropped out of college in 1953 to travel with the quartet to New York City. Lara also went solo in 1953 and scored a hit with a recording of the bolero Sollozo ('Crying'), which he followed up with Orqu√≠deas, a Spanish version of Orchids in the Moonlight by Vincent Youmans. That same year he met and married Nilda Mar√≠a Canino with whom he was to have three children, Agustin Jr., Mar√≠a and Jos√© Rafael. He returned to New York and performed at the Paramount Theater where Myrta Silva introduced him as \\"El Pollo que Canta\\" ('The Handsome Singer').Musica de Puerto Rico Los Hispanos In 1955, Lara joined one of Puerto Rico's renowned quartets Los Hispanos and made his television d√©but with them and singers, Ida Claudio, and Sonia Noem√≠ on \\"El Show Ford\\", broadcast by Telemundo, the television station owned and operated by √Ångel Ramos. His extraordinary vocal range allowed him to replace any of the members of Los Hispanos when one of them was unable to perform. In January 11, 1965, the group began a seven-year participation in the televised part of the Festival Sultana, a show produced by Paquito Cordero. Lara and Los Hispanos travelled and performed in the United States, the Dominican Republic, Panam√°, Per√∫, Venezuela and Chile. Lara enrolled in the Music Conservatory of Puerto Rico and in 1970 earned his Bachelor's degree, specializing in trumpet-playing. He formed a duo with Mar√≠a Esther Ortiz called Los Dos and also founded the Allegro 72 group, which, among others, included Luis Antonio Cosme. Lara performed with Allegro 72 at Carnegie Hall, New York, and at various television stations. Some members of Allegro 72 who went on to gain fame were Lunna, √Ångel \\"Cucco\\" Pe√±a, Dagmar Rivera and Alyce Gracia. Later years Lara began to have problems with his health in 1978, suffering a stroke which was complicated by his diabetes. In 1979, he underwent an open-heart surgery procedure from which he recuperated and shortly after returned to Puerto Rico. There he underwent conversion to Christianity and joined a Protestant church. After his conversion, he continued singing sacred music almost exclusively, collaborating with singers such as the magnificent mezzo-soprano Maribel Soto, recording with her a Spanish adaptation of Sandi Patty's \\"More than Wonderful\\" (\\"Maravilloso es\\"); singing in a choir put together by Wis√≥n Torres, Jr. and Leyda E. Col√≥n, founders and directors of the Puerto Rican Christian music group Peregrinos y Extranjeros, for the CD \\"Buscando aquella ciudad\\" (\\"Looking for that city\\") (Pilgrim Music), and recording two beautiful projects as a soloist. The first one was titled \\"√âl\\" (\\"He\\"); the second one: \\"Se√±or Amigo\\" (\\"My Lord, my friend\\"). Most of the lyrics of his sacred songs talked about grace, eternal live, hope, and love for his Lord, Jesus Christ. When visiting churches to sing live or presenting concerts, he always said: \\"I sing happily because I believe in the words I sing\\". His version in Spanish of the Frankie Laine hit I Believe, titled \\"Tengo Fe\\", became his signature song. He also participated in \\"Noche de Gala\\", a musical variety show hosted by T.V. personality Eddie Mir√≥, for the celebration of Easter, singing the famous duet with Maribel Soto. In 1985, Lara participated in the Concierto de Navidad (Christmas Concert) held at the \\"Luis A. Ferr√© Center for the Performing Arts\\" in San Juan. In 1986, he held concerts in the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts and at the Hostos Center of Culture in the Bronx. That year he also recorded his last album, Los Cuatro Ases (The Four Aces). Personal life Lara was married to Nilda Maria Canino from 1953 to his death. In addition to his wife, he was survived by his three children.http://prpop.org/biografias/tito-lara/ Discography * Sollozo ('Crying') (1953) * Orqu√≠deas ('Orchids') * Canciones de Los Cuatro Ases ('Song of the Four Aces') * Lo que hay que hacer ('What You Must Do') (1958) * No quiero ser tu amante ('I Do Not Want To Be Your Lover') * Un nuevo √≠dolo para Am√©rica ('A New Idol for America') (1959) * Mi versi√≥n ('My Version') * La vida m√≠a ('My Life') * Vivo sin ti ('I Live Without You') * Im√°genes * Niebla de Riachuelo ('Bolero, Duet Album with Maria E.

His field career ended when he was shot in the back following his decision to intervene and apprehend the assailants in an altercation outside Campisi's, a Dallas Italian restaurant. He wore uniform number 14 when the American League began using uniform numbers for its umpires in 1980, and the number was never reassigned to another AL umpire until after the AL and NL umpire staffs were unified by MLB in 2000. Biography =Early life and education= Steve Palermo was born on October 9, 1949 in Worcester, Massachusetts. He studied education at Norwich University, Leicester Junior College and Worcester State College. While in school, he worked as a baseball umpire. Barney Deary, who headed Major League Baseball's Umpire Development Program, discovered Palermo working a Little League all-star game. As a result, Palermo entered the league's development program where he trained for five years. =Umpiring career= His career as an umpire includes the 1983 World Series, three American League Championship Series (1980, 1982, and 1989), the 1981 American League Division Series and the 1986 All-Star Game. In August 1991, The Sporting News ranked Palermo \\"Number 1\\" among American League umpires for overall performance. His first game as an umpire was the Toronto Blue Jays first ever game on April 7, 1977 at Exhibition Stadium. Palermo was the third base umpire for that game. Palermo was one of the first American League umpires to never use the outside chest protector. Starting in 1977, all new AL umpires had to adopt the inside chest protector, which had been used in the National League for decades under the guidance of Hall of Fame umpire Bill Klem. AL umpires on staff prior to 1977 were grandfathered and could continue to use the outside protector. Among those umpires with Palermo in the AL Class of '77 were Durwood Merrill and Vic Voltaggio. His career highlights also include umpiring two of the most famous games in New York Yankees history. In 1978, he worked the Yankees' one-game playoff against the Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park to determine the AL's Eastern Division winner. Palermo, serving as the third base umpire, signaled \\"fair ball\\" when Bucky Dent hit the game- changing home run. On July 4, 1983, Palermo worked behind the plate for Dave Righetti's no-hitter against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. Steve Palermo provided the umpire's voice in Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball, a 1994 Super NES baseball video game. 1991 shooting and recovery On July 7, 1991, he and several friends, including fellow umpire Rich Garcia, were dining after a Texas Rangers game when they were alerted that two waitresses were being mugged in the parking lot. In an attempt to apprehend the assailants, he suffered a bullet wound to his spinal cord, resulting in instant paralysis from the waist down. Palermo's umpiring career ended, and doctors told Palermo and his wife, Debbie, that he would probably never walk again. Through rehabilitation and determination, Palermo managed to recover, walking with the use of one small leg brace and a cane. He subsequently threw the ceremonial first pitch in Game 1 of the 1991 World Series, only three months after suffering his injury. =Later life= Bud Selig hired Palermo as a special assistant in 1994 and, in 2000, elevated him as a supervisor of umpiring for the league. From 1995 to 1997, Palermo worked part-time as an analyst for Yankees games on MSG Network. Palermo died on May 14, 2017, in Overland Park, Kansas at the age of 67, following a battle with lung cancer. Honors In 2003, Palermo began serving as the Honorary Chairman of Assurant Employee Benefits' WillReturn Council. The Council annually presents the Shining Star of Perseverance Award to individuals who overcome disabilities.WillReturn Council Palermo was also an honorary inductee into the Perseverance Hall of Fame. In 1994, he won the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. Palermo served as honorary commissioner for the Tee Ball game at the White House on July 24, 2005, in which children with physical disabilities participated; the game was part of President George W. Bush's White House Tee Ball Initiative. At the 2012 All-Star Game in Kansas City, Palermo accompanied the umpiring crew to the plate for special recognition.

Skeptics have questioned his claim that he has ability to cure ailments such as asthma, arthritis and cancer; stating that he uses psychological manipulation to make people feel as though they are healed. Subritzky was a friend to the controversial Nigerian \\"prophet\\" T.B. Joshua and publicly supported him amidst criticism that Joshua's \\"miracles\\" were not of God. In 1986, Subritzky and other conservative Christians helped establish the Coalition of Concerned Citizens, a right-wing Christian pressure group formed to oppose the socially-liberal policies of the Fourth Labour Government. He was married to Lucy Patricia (Pat), who died in 2011. Subritzky later married Kaylene. In the 1991 New Year Honours, Subritzky was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for community service. Subritzky published his autobiography On the Cutting Edge: The Bill Subritzky Story in 1993.Published by Sovereign World Ltd (Kent, UK) PB; HB. In 2014, Subritzky's estate in Lynfield, Mount Roskill was sold to Ryman Healthcare with an estimated market value of $16.2 million. The property was developed by Subritzky and his first wife, Pat, in 1960 and featured several homes, a pool, tennis court, sheds and a separate office wing from where Subritzky ran his businesses. Subritzky died on 23 December 2015.

The genus name is from Latin Larus which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird. The specific glaucescens is New Latin for \\"glaucous\\" from the Ancient Greek, glaukos. English \\"Glaucous\\" denotes a bluish-green or grey colour. Range and lifespan The glaucous-winged gull is rarely found far from the ocean. It is a resident from the western coast of Alaska to the coast of Washington. These glaucous winged gulls can also lived in Seattle area. It also breeds on the northwest coast of Alaska, in the summertime and in the Russian Far East. During winter, they can be found along the coast of California, Oregon, Baja California, Baja California Sur, and Sonora. It frequently hybridizes with western gull resulting in identification problems‚Äîparticularly in the Puget Sound area. This species also hybridizes regularly with the herring gull in Alaska. Both hybrid combinations resemble the Thayer's gull. Glaucous-winged gulls are thought to live about 15 years, but some live much longer; a bird in British Columbia, for example, lived for more than 21 years, while one in the US state of Washington lived for at least 22 years, 9 months. The longevity record though, is more than 37 years, for a bird banded as a chick in British Columbia. It is an exceptionally rare vagrant to the Western Palearctic region, with records from Morocco, the Canary Islands and, most recently, from Ireland in February and March 2016. It has also been recorded in Britain in the winters of 2006/2007 and 2008/2009. The 2008/2009 record was from Saltholme Pools, Cleveland, and attracted hundreds of twitchers. Description Newborn chick and egg in nest, St. Lazaria Island, Alaska This gull is a large bird, being close in size to the herring gull, with which it has a superficial resemblance, and the western gull, to which it is likely most closely genetically related. It measures in length and in wingspan, with a body mass of .All About Birds (2011).CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), .Gulls: Of North America, Europe, and Asia by Klaus Malling Olsen & Hans Larsson. Princeton University Press (2004). . It weighs around on average. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . It has a white head, neck, breast, and belly, a white tail, and pearly-gray wings and back. The ends of its wings are white-tipped. Its legs are pink and the beak is yellow with a red subterminal spot (the spot near the end of the bill that chicks peck in order to stimulate regurgitative feeding). The forehead is somewhat flat. During the winter, the head and nape appears dusky, and the subterminal spot becomes dark. Young birds are brown or gray with black beaks, and take four years to reach adult plumage. Glaucous-winged gull, juvenile The glaucous-winged gull nests in the summer, and each pair produces two or three chicks which fledge at six weeks. It feeds along the coast, scavenging for dead or weak animals, fish, mussels and scraps. In urban areas it is well known for its tendency to accept food from people and peck open unprotected garbage bags in search of edibles. Its cry is a low-pitched \\"kak-kak-kak\\" or \\"wow\\", or a more high-pitched wailing.

Frequently used in gridiron football, they serve as extra players during the team's practices, often as part of the scout team by emulating an upcoming opponent's play style. Because the players on the practice squad are familiar with the team's plays and formations, the practice squad serves as a way to develop inexperienced players for promotion to the main roster. This is particularly important for professional gridiron football teams, which do not have formal minor league farm team affiliates to train players. In addition, it provides replacement players for the main roster when players are needed as the result of injuries or other roster moves, such as bereavement leave. National Football League =History= During the 1940s, Cleveland Browns coach Paul Brown invented the \\"taxi squad,\\" a group of promising scouted players who did not make the roster but were kept on reserve. The team owner, Arthur \\"Mickey\\" McBride, put them on the payroll of his taxi company, although they did not drive cabs. The name stuck, and the practice of retaining a squad of ready reserves spread throughout professional football. However, the National Football League (NFL) did not officially recognize the existence of taxi squads until February 18, 1965. On that date, the NFL team owners formally adopted a 40-man active roster supplemented by a taxi squad of unregulated size, which was officially termed the \\"future list.\\" Over the next few seasons, the NFL gradually limited the allowable number of inactive players to seven, and regulations were established in relation to injured reserve and waiver practices. In 1974, the NFL eliminated the taxi squad altogether, moving the seven inactive spots into an expanded 47-man active roster. Beginning in 1977, a more limited inactive system was introduced (often consisting of either two or four players, depending on the season), and these players were sometimes referred to as taxi squad members. Players may be signed to a practice squad for several reasons: for lack of space on the team, due to injury, or because they require more development. Practice squad players can be signed to any team's 53-man active roster, without compensation to their former team, at any time during the season. Many NFL players spent time on practice squads before finding success in the league, including NFL first-team All Pro players James Harrison, Adrian Phillips, Jason Peters, Danny Amendola, Danny Woodhead, Arian Foster, and Kyle Cook. =Squad size= In the 1993 collective bargaining agreement, practice squads were limited to five players. The practice squad expanded to eight players on April 1, 2004, following a vote from NFL owners. In August 2014, the practice squad expanded to 10 players. Effective with the 2020 season, each NFL team may keep up to 12 players on its practice squad in addition to the 53-man active roster; effective with the 2022 season, the number of players on the practice squad will increase to 14. The 2020 Collective Bargaining Agreement made a number of changes to the practice squad: * The CBA increased the practice squad to 12 players for the 2020 and 2021 seasons, and 14 players starting in 2022. The added slots are open to players with any amount of experience. * Teams may promote up to two players per week to the active roster. Such promotions must be made the day before the team's game, and allow the player to automatically revert to the practice squad without having to clear waivers. * In July 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NFL increased the practice squad size to 16 for the 2020 season, with six slots open to players with any amount of experience. Additionally, each week, teams may designate up to four practice squad players who then cannot be signed by other teams to their active rosters. Additional protocols are in place for activation of large numbers of practice squad players in the event of an outbreak. The practice squad is only in effect during the regular season and postseason. Once a team's season finishes, practice squad players are typically signed to reserve/futures contracts by their teams, enabling them to be members of the team's 90-man offseason roster at the start of the new league year in March. =Eligibility= In 1998, eligibility limits were imposed to allow only players without an accrued season or players who had one accrued season but were active for less than nine games that season. Players could only be members of the practice squad for up to two seasons. One practice squad season was defined in 1998 as having been on the squad for at least three games in a season, with bye weeks counting as a game. In 2006, a third practice squad season for a player became possible as long as the team had 53 players on their active roster for the duration of the player's time on the practice squad that season. The player was considered to have served a third season as a practice squad member if they were on the squad for at least one game that season. Until the 2011 season, games in which a player is listed as the third- string quarterback (using the third quarterback rule) did not count as being on the active list. Former quarterback Mike Quinn, who was listed as the third-string quarterback for several teams throughout his career, was practice squad eligible during his eighth NFL season. In August 2014, eligibility was expanded by increasing the number of games in a season a player must be on the squad in order for that season to count as one of the player's three seasons of eligibility from three games to six games. Finally, each practice squad could include two players who have accrued too much playing time to be eligible for the squad under the previous rules, though these players may have no more than two accrued seasons in the league. Starting with the 2016 season, up to four veteran players were allowed to be on the practice squad. =Salaries= The minimum salaries were $3,300 per week from 1993 to 1997; $3,650 per week from 1998 to 1999; $4,000 per week from 2000 to 2002; and $4,350 per week from 2003 to 2004. The minimum salaries were $4,700 per week from 2006 to 2007; and $5,200 per week from 2008 to 2010. The minimum salaries were $5,700 per week from 2011 to 2012; $6,000 per week in 2013; $6,300 per week in 2014; $6,600 per week in 2015; $6,900 per week in 2016; $7,200 per week in 2017; $7,600 per week in 2018; and $8,000 per week in 2019. Those on the practice squad are paid 17 weeks a year for the regular season, like active players, however unlike the latter there are no signing bonuses nor guaranteed salaries. Practice squad players earn considerably less than active squad players: in 2020, the minimum salary for a practice squad player was $8,400 per week ($142,800 for 17 weeks), and the minimum rookie salary was $610,000. Some practice squad players are paid considerably more, however. In 2006, the New England Patriots paid third-year player Billy Yates the full $425,000 he would have earned as a member of the team's active roster. In addition to their low wages, practice squad players can be released from a team at any time. This means that they incur additional expenses and uncertainly due to the frequency of moving around as the \\"cost of living varies so widely from city to city ‚Äî as do each state‚Äôs taxes ‚Äî that most players err on the side of caution when it comes to the rent they‚Äôre willing to pay, since they don‚Äôt know where they‚Äôll wind up next\\". Being on the practice squad is similar to a \\"journeyman lifestyle, but often without the active roster paychecks that make that path worthwhile\\". Consequently, many practice squad players rely upon family support and/or take offseason jobs.https://www.sbnation.com/2018/11/14/18092708/nfl-practice-squad-money- reality-jaydon-mickens-michael- thomashttps://www.sbnation.com/2019/1/15/18182010/nfl-practice-squad-reality- life-on-the-move-tyvis-powell Canadian Football League The Canadian Football League (CFL) follows similar rules to the NFL with regards to practice squad players, but has unique rules due to its nationality-based player designation and roster ratio system, where Canadian citizens are considered \\"national\\" players and non-Canadians are considered either \\"international\\" or \\"global\\" players. Each CFL team is normally limited to 10 players on their practice squads (2 of which must be national players) and their salaries count against their teams' salary caps. A CFL practice squad roster may further be expanded to 12 with \\"global\\" players (see \\"international players\\" below). Due to the CFL seasons starting before the NFL's and its position as a smaller sister-league to the NFL, each team's practice squad is temporary expanded to 15 players (17 when counting \\"global\\" players) following the NFL's roster cuts at the beginning of the NFL season; the extra 5 players do not count against a team's salary cap.CFL Roster Makeup ‚Äî A CFLdb Razzle Document XFL and NFL Europe The second incarnation of the XFL, which held its sole brief season in 2020, in lieu of individual teams having their own practice squads, operated a centralized \\"Team 9\\" that acted as both a practice squad and farm team for the entire league. This team had its own coaches and staff but did not play any on-record games. Team 9 players were paid the league minimum salary for inactive players, $1,040 per week. A similar system was reportedly used by the now-defunct NFL Europe, the NFL's European developmental league. College and high school football In college football, players who are on a team's roster and practice with the team but do not play are known as redshirts. Redshirts consist mostly of freshmen and of transfer students who are not eligible to play in games due to NCAA rules. If a player plays through one entire season as a redshirt, that season does not count toward their limit of four years of eligibility to play college football; in rare circumstances, usually stemming from major injuries, a player may be granted a second redshirt year.https://www.sportsrec.com/practice-squad-football-5091404.html Before the 2018 season, a player lost redshirt status with his first game appearance in that season; since then, redshirt status is lost only if the player appears in more than four games during that season. Prior to 1972, the NCAA prohibited freshmen from participating in varsity games, though they could practice with the varsity team and compete on separate freshmen teams, similar to junior varsity teams in high school football.https://ussporthistory.com/2015/10/22/a-brief-history-of-freshman- eligibility-and-race-in-the-ncaa/ International players The practice squad has also been used by professional teams and leagues as a way to bring in and train players from outside the United States or Canada, where gridiron football is not a popular sport, as an attempt to foster international interest. In the CFL, players from outside Canada are designated \\"international\\" players, which is usually used in reference to American players, but a subset of \\"international\\" players known as \\"global\\" players was implemented in 2019 to refer to players originating from outside the United States and Canada.https://www.cfl.ca/2019/06/11/global-additions-set-make- history-week-1/ This section, for both the NFL and CFL, refers to players that would be eligible for the CFL's \\"global\\" designation. =NFL= The NFL has operated programs in which selected international players were assigned to teams' practice squads as an extra member who did not count towards a team's maximum practice squad size. The first, called the International Practice Squad Program, began operation in 2004. In 2005, Rolando Cantu of Mexico was promoted to the Arizona Cardinals' active roster after spending the previous season on the practice squad as a member of the program.NFL Expands International Practice Squad Program , The News Tribune, May 23, 2008. Players from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Japan, and Russia also participated. In 2008, the program sponsored sixteen players, the largest number ever. The program was discontinued for 2009. The rule allowing for an extra practice squad player of international origin, however, remained in the NFL's rulebook and teams attempted to use the rule even after the demise of the program. For example, in 2013 the Detroit Lions attempted to use it to add Norwegian kicker H√•vard Rugland to their practice squad, but were rejected by the NFL, which stated that the rule was meant to be used for players from NFL Europe, which folded after the 2007 season. A new program, the International Player Pathway, was created in 2017. This new initiative started as a trial involving only NFC South teams. Each team in the division was allowed to sign one international player to its practice squad who would not count against the normal 10-player limit, but would not be eligible to be activated during the season after being signed. The pathway was expanded to eight teams (NFC South and AFC North) for the 2018 season. Additionally, several international players have tried to find their starts in the NFL through spending time on teams practice squads without having initially been part of these programs, such as Efe Obada, Moritz B√∂hringer, and Jarryd Hayne. =CFL= In the CFL, the \\"global\\" player designation was started in 2019 as part of an international partnership with amateur and semi-pro leagues in Mexico and Europe. In addition to the requirement of each CFL team to have one \\"global\\" player on their active rosters, each team may have a maximum of two \\"global\\" players on their practice squad who do not count against the team's normal practice squad size limit. Each \\"global\\" player designated is paid the CFL minimum salary and a portion of their salary may be sent back to the leagues they were taken from, depending on partnership arrangements; players taken from Mexico, for example, currently have 10% of their salaries sent to the Liga de F√∫tbol Americano Profesional, Mexico's top level American football league.BARNES: Mexican players who make an active CFL roster will hand over 10% of salary for a scholarship fund References Bibliography * Category:College sports in the United States Category:American football terminology Category:Canadian football terminology ","title":"Practice squad"},{"id":"3016112","text":"JAAS may refer to: * Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry * Journal of Asia Adventist Seminary * Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies * Java Authentication and Authorization Service ","title":"JAAS"},{"id":"3016121","title":"Michel Bri√®re"},{"id":"3016132","text":"Dejazmach Wand Bewossen (died 10 December 1777) was a prominent figure in Ethiopian history.

Lane in 1981. Plot summary Nineteen-year-old Mart√≠n Castillo is a boy from Buenos Aires trying to find his path in life. He meets and falls in love with Alejandra Vidal Olmos who with her father Fernando represents the \\"old\\", post-colonial and autochthonous Argentina, which is seen mutating amid a strange and unsettling \\"new\\" world. The novel gives an evocative portrait of the city of Buenos Aires and its people. Literary significance and criticism This work, filled with dark and emotional imagery, is considered by many to be Sabato's magnum opus, and the section Informe sobre ciegos (\\"Report on the Blind\\"), about Fernando's distorted obsession with, and fear of, the blind, is a haunting, nightmarish contribution to Latin American literature. References to actual history, geography and current science Interspersed with the text of the novel, as an almost surrealistic running commentary on it, is the italicised narrative of the flight, killing and ensuing odyssey of Juan Lavalle, a classic Argentine subject. Cultural influence John Malkovich has optioned the film rights for this novel. Swedish melodic death metal band At the Gates' album At War with Reality has lyrics based on this book.

It was created in 1912 to protect habitat and provide sanctuary for one of the largest elk (also known as wapiti) herds on Earth. With a total of 24,700 acres, the refuge borders the town of Jackson, Wyoming on the southwest, Bridger-Teton National Forest on the east and Grand Teton National Park on the north. It is home to an average of 7,500 elk each winter. The refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The refuge's elk migrate from as far away as southern Yellowstone National Park. Historically, they migrated to the present location of the refuge and further south into southwestern Wyoming during the fall, wintering on grassy plains that were both sheltered from weather and that maintained less snowfall or snow depth than surrounding lands. During the spring, the herd would follow the retreating snows and growing grasses back into the Yellowstone National Park region. The original size of the elk herd has been estimated to have been in excess of 25,000. By the end of the 19th century, the town of Jackson had developed on important winter range, blocking off some of the migration routes used by the elk. The elk herd was severely reduced in size due to the hostile climate and lack of food supply, in addition to hunting pressures by both homesteaders and surrounding Native American tribes (Bannock). Elk during winter on the refugeA movement to protect the remaining herd and establish greater numbers was commenced in the early 1900s. When the Miller homestead was sold for $45,000 to the federal government, the refuge was established. The elk herd survives the hard winters of Jackson Hole through a supplementary feeding program and a lottery-based, permitted hunting program. The elk have antlers which are shed each year- the Boy Scouts of America have been collecting the antlers under permit since 1968 and selling them at auction, under agreement that 75% of the proceeds are returned to the refuge, where they are used for irrigation of the grasses to maintain maximum natural food supply. Ten to eleven thousand pounds (4,500 to 5,000 kg) of antlers are auctioned each year. The increase in value has resulted in a commensurate rise in antler theft, and the 2017 auction set a new record price of $18.79/lb. bison trudge across the landscape at the National Elk Refuge. The refuge also provides horse drawn sleigh rides to the public during the winter months so that visitors have the opportunity to see portions of the herd up close. The furthest consistent migration of elk to the refuge is currently from the southern portion of Yellowstone National Park, making it the second-longest ungulate migration in the lower 48 states. (The migration of pronghorn between the Green River basin and Jackson Hole is longer). The refuge is nearly 25,000 acres (101 km2) of meadows and marshes along the valley floor, sagebrush and rock outcroppings along the mountain foothills. The largest single herd of bison under federal management, comprising 1,000 plus individuals, also winter on the refuge. Bighorn sheep, along with pronghorn, mule deer can be found. Rare sightings of wolf packs and grizzly bears have occurred, while coyotes and red foxes are more common. The most abundant birds include red-winged blackbirds, magpies, crows and ravens, along with trumpeter swans, which can be found along Flat Creek, which flows out of the refuge south into the town of Jackson. A total of 47 mammal species and 147 bird species have been documented on the refuge. The refuge has a lower elevation and much milder climate than the rest of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which is why so many animals are drawn to winter on it. Most of it is snow-covered from November until March. Snowfalls are followed by sunny days, when some of the snow melts temporarily. South-facing slopes are free of snow for most of the winter.

A lawyer, he was a noted prohibitionist and abolitionist. He served in both houses of the Maryland state legislature, first as a Whig, and later as a member of the American Party. Later, as a Republican, he was a member of the convention that wrote Maryland's constitution in 1864. He helped found the Maryland Temperance Alliance in 1872 and served as its president for twelve years. Daniel was the vice presidential nominee and running mate of John St. John on the Prohibition Party ticket in the presidential election of 1884. Placing third in the election that year, he continued his involvement with the cause of temperance until his death in 1897. Early life and education Daniel was born on Deal Island in Somerset County, Maryland on January 24, 1826, the son of Travers Daniel and his wife, Mary Wallace Daniel. Travers Daniel arrived at Deal Island at the age of eighteen to teach school but soon turned to farming after marrying Mary Wallace. William Daniel and his siblings were raised on the farm and attended the local school. He attended Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1848. While in college, he became a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church; he would remain affiliated with the church for the rest of his life. After finishing third in a class of twenty-eight, Daniel returned to Maryland to study law in the office of William S. Waters, a Somerset County lawyer who had recently served as Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates. Daniel was admitted to the bar in 1851. State legislator Like the rest of his family, Daniel was a member of the Whig Party, and soon became involved in local politics. While maintaining his law practice, he was elected to a two- year term in the Maryland House of Delegates in 1853. While there he introduced a bill based on the Maine law, which would have prohibited the sale and production of alcoholic beverages in the state, but it did not pass. By this time, the Whig Party was falling apart over sectional issues, but Daniel was reelected in 1855 as a member of the American Party (also known as the \\"Know Nothings\\"). The Know Nothings' main political issue was nativism, but Daniel remained focused more on prohibition. In 1857, he promoted a law permitting the local option, which would let individual counties in the state chose whether to enact prohibition of alcohol within their borders, but it did not pass. That year he was elected to a four-year term in the Maryland Senate. He resigned part-way through his term, in 1858, to practice law in Baltimore. Two years later, he married Ellen Young Guiteau, daughter of a Congregational minister. By 1864, Daniel had joined the Republican Party. That year, he was a delegate to the state's constitutional convention, which produced the Maryland Constitution of 1864. Despite growing up in a slaveholding area, Daniel was an abolitionist and joined with the majority at the convention in voting to outlaw slavery and disenfranchise those who had fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. In 1866, Daniel argued in court that state laws enforcing racial distinctions were no longer valid after the passage of the recent federal Civil Rights Act. The court ruled in his favor, holding that the law could not treat black and white apprentices differently. Later that year, Daniel ran unsuccessfully for a judgeship on the state equity court. Prohibition advocate Daniel pictured in 1884 After the war, Daniel continued in his private law practice while remaining active in the anti- alcohol cause. He was elected president of the Maryland Temperance Alliance when it was formed in 1872. He was re-elected to that position annually for the next twelve years. During that time, the local option law Daniel favored while in the legislature became law; thirteen of the state's twenty-three counties (including Somerset) adopted prohibition under the statute. Throughout his leadership of the Maryland Temperance Alliance, Daniel remained a member of the Republican Party, but in 1884 he left to join the small Prohibition Party. Like Daniel, most party members came from pietist churches, and most were former Republicans. Elected as the head of the Maryland branch of the party, he attended the 1884 Prohibition Party National Convention in Pittsburgh. After being selected as temporary chairman of the convention, the delegates chose Daniel to be nominated for vice president alongside the presidential nominee, John St. John. The party platform was silent on most issues of the day, focusing instead on the alcohol problem. In the election that year, the Prohibition ticket fell far short of victory, as expected, but placed third with 1.5 percent of the vote‚Äîa marked improvement over the 0.1 percent the 1880 Prohibition candidates had received. Further, their vote total in New York‚Äîjust over 25,000‚Äîwas more than enough to throw the election in that state from James G. Blaine, the Republican, to Grover Cleveland, the Democrat. Because pro-temperance voters usually voted Republican, many historians credit St. John and Daniel with costing Blaine the election. After the campaign, Daniel continued his temperance activism, remaining head of the state party until 1888. He organized the Prohibition Camp Meeting association in 1889, which later purchased land in Glyndon, Maryland for their meetings. He also kept up his law practice, training many law students in his office, including Orlando Franklin Bump, who also serve as Daniel's law partner for several years. He also served as a trustee of Dickinson College, his alma mater, and in other charitable and religious activities, including YMCA. On October 13, 1897, he died suddenly of heart failure at his home in Mount Washington, Baltimore, survived by his wife and their adopted son, Clarence Adreon. He was buried at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.

Isostylis is a subgenus of Banksia. It contains three closely related species, all of which occur only in Southwest Western Australia. Members of subgenus Isostylis have dome-shaped flower heads that are superficially similar to those of B. ser. Dryandra, but structurally more like reduced versions of the \\"flower spikes\\" characteristic of most other Banksia taxa. There are three species of Banksia subg. Isostylis, B. ilicifolia (holly-leaved banksia), B. cuneata (matchstick banksia) and B. oligantha (Wagin banksia). B. ilicifolia is widely distributed and relatively common, but the other two species are rare and threatened. Description Banksia subg. Isostylis shares with B. ser. Dryandra the property of having compact, dome-shaped flower heads. Structurally, however, Isostylis flower heads are quite different from those of B. ser. Dryandra, having more in common with the erect flower spikes of other Banksia taxa. Specifically, Isostylis flower heads have an ovoid axis, suggestive of a greatly reduced flower spike, whereas Dryandra flower heads emerge from a flat receptable. Furthermore, Isostylis has thick follicles with a woolly coating, whereas Dryandra follicles are thin and hairless; and the involucral, common and floral bracts of Isostylis are unlike those of Dryandra. The Isostylis species are all upright shrubs or trees, with a single trunk. They generally have serrate leaves, although in rare cases B. ilicifolia may have entire leaves. Taxonomy =Taxonomic history= B. cuneata Banksia subg. Isostylis was first published by Robert Brown in his 1810 Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen; thus its full name, with author citation, is Banksia subg. Isostylis R.Br. Brown's arrangement was the first infrageneric arrangement of Banksia, making B. subg. Isostylis Banksias first infrageneric taxon. Brown erected B. subg. Isostylis to contain B. ilicifolia, which was then the only known Banksia with a dome-shaped inflorescence. He did not explicitly name a type species for the subgenus, but B. ilicifolia is treated as the type because it was the only member when the subgenus was published. Twenty years later, Brown issued a supplement to his Prodromus entitled Supplementum Primum Prodromi Florae Novae Hollandiae; another nine Banksia species were published, but there was no change to the 1810 arrangement, and no new Isostylis species. In 1846, √âdouard Spach promoted B. subg. Isostylis to genus rank in his Histoire Naturelle des Vegetaux: Phanerogames. This was not accepted, and Isostylis (R.Br.) Spach is now considered a nomenclatural synonym of B. subg. Isostylis. When Carl Meissner published his arrangement of Banksia in 1856, he demoted both of Brown's subgenera to sectional rank, maintaining B. sect. Isostylis (R.Br.) Meisn. as a monospecific taxon containing only B. ilicifolia. Meissner's rank and circumscription of Isostylis was retained by George Bentham in his 1870 arrangement for Flora Australiensis, but Bentham also published a putative variety of B. ilicifolia, B. i. var. integrifolia, based on specimens collected by Ludwig Preiss near the Swan River in Western Australia. This was later overturned. In 1905, James Britten challenged the genus name Banksia, on the grounds that Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst had precedent over Banksia L.f.. Britten adopted the name Isostylis for the entire genus, republishing the names Isostylis dentata (L.f.) Britten for B. dentata (Tropical Banksia), Isostylis ericifolia (L.f.) Britten for B. ericifolia (Heath-leaved Banksia), Isostylis integrifolia (L.f.) Britten for B. integrifolia (Coast Banksia) and Isostylis serrata (L.f.) Britten for B. serrata (Saw Banksia). This challenge failed, Banksia L.f. was eventually conserved, and his four names are now considered taxonomic synonyms of their respective names under Banksia L.f. None of them are considered members of Isostylis. The next change to Isostylis came in 1981, when Alex George promoted it back to subgenus rank, and published a second species, B. cuneata. In discussing the subgenus, George commented that there had been calls to transfer Isostylis into Dryandra, which was then a distinct genus. He argued, however, that the similarities between Isostylis and Dryandra were largely superficial, whereas the similarities with Banksia were much more important taxonomically. His conclusion was that the taxon should remain in Banksia, although he did not rule out promoting it into a separate genus. A third B. subg. Isostylis species, B. oligantha, was published by George in 1988. In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a revised arrangement based on a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They took up the question of an affinity of Isostylis with Dryandra, finding George's arguments unconvincing but failing to find any further evidence for or against Isostyliss placement within Banksia. They eventually accepted both of George's subgenera, using each as an outgroup in the analysis of the other. Thus their analysis yielded no information about the circumscription and placement of Isostylis, and their arrangement maintained Isostylis as a subgenus. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement was not accepted by George, and was largely discarded by him in his 1999 arrangement. The placement and circumscription of B. subg. Isostylis was unaffected and can be summarised as follows: B. cuneata grows as a large shrub, up to three metres in height. :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia (3 sections, 11 series, 73 species, 11 subspecies, 14 varieties) ::B. subg. Isostylis :::B. ilicifolia :::B. oligantha :::B. cuneata Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses has provided compelling evidence for the paraphyly of Banksia with respect to Dryandra, and suggest an overall phylogeny that is very greatly different from George's arrangement. Mast's results clearly recognise Isostylis as a distinct clade, but place it in a fairly recent position, within a clade that also contains B. elegans (Elegant Banksia) and B. attenuata (Candlestick Banksia). It falls a substantial distance from Dryandra, suggesting that similarities between those two groups are indeed superficial. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, B. subg. Isostylis has been set aside. If maintained at all in Mast and Thiele's forthcoming arrangement, it will be at a lesser rank than subgenus. Relationships within B. subg. Isostylis still remain unclear. Though Mast's studies found B. cuneata to be the most basal of the three species, a 2004 study of genetic divergence within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested B. ilicifolia as basal, while others suggested B. oligantha. Further complicating the situation is the existence of a population of B. cuneata having both genetic and phenetic affinities with B. oligantha. The origin of this population is unknown. It might have arisen through hybridisation, or it may be a transitional or even ancestral form. Finally, biogeographical factors suggest that B. ilicifolia would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the High Rainfall Zone where relictual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the Transitional Rainfall Zone, where more recently evolved species are most common. Distribution Distribution of the three B. subg.Isostylis species: B. ilicifolia (red), B. cuneata (green), and B. oligantha (blue) Species of B. subg. Isostylis occur only in Western Australia's South West Botanical Province. B. ilicifolia is widespread within 70 kilometres of the coast from Mount Lesueur in the north, south to Cape Leeuwin and east to Albany. The other two species occur further inland, and have quite limited distributions. B. cuneata occurs Brookton and Bruce Rock in the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region; while B. oligantha occurs slightly further south, in the vicinity of Wagin. Ecology Ecologically, B. subg. Isostylis is similar to other Banksias. As with other Banksia taxa, all three species have proteoid roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. They lack a lignotuber, so shrubs are killed by bushfire; mature trees of B. ilicifolia have a limited ability to resprout from epicormic buds on the trunk. But like all Banksias they release their aerial seed bank following a bushfire. This adaptation, known as serotiny, ensures the rapid regeneration of populations killed by fire. B. cuneata and B. oligantha have been declared rare under both Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950, and the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Threats include loss of habitat, Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, and grazing on seedlings by feral rabbits. Cultivation None of the B. subg. Isostylis species are popular in cultivation. The two rare species are virtually unknown in cultivation. B. ilicifolia is better known, but its usefulness as an amenity plant is limited by the fact that it has very prickly leaves.

The war pitted Francis I of France and the Republic of Venice against the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Henry VIII of England, and the Papal States. The conflict arose from animosity over the election of Charles as Emperor in 1519‚Äì20 and from Pope Leo X's need to ally with Charles against Martin Luther. The war broke out across Western Europe late in 1521, when a French‚ÄìNavarrese expedition attempted to reconquer Navarre while a French army invaded the Low Countries. A Spanish army drove the Navarrese forces back into the Pyrenees, and other Imperial forces attacked northern France, where they were stopped in turn. The Pope, the Emperor, and Henry VIII then signed a formal alliance against France, and hostilities resumed on the Italian Peninsula; but, with the attention of both Francis and Charles focused on the battleground in northeast France, the conflict in Italy became something of a sideshow.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 140. At the Battle of Bicocca on 27 April 1522, Imperial and Papal forces defeated the French, driving them from Lombardy.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 142‚Äì43. Following the battle, fighting again spilled onto French soil, while Venice made a separate peace. The English invaded France in 1523, while Charles de Bourbon, alienated by Francis's attempts to seize his inheritance, betrayed Francis and allied himself with the Emperor. A French attempt to regain Lombardy in 1524 failed and provided Bourbon with an opportunity to invade Provence at the head of a Spanish army. Francis himself led a second attack on Milan in 1525; his disastrous defeat at the Battle of Pavia, where he was captured by the Imperial captain Charles de Lannoy and many of his chief nobles were killed, led to the end of the war. With Francis imprisoned in the Lombard city of Pizzighettone and then in the Spanish city of Madrid, a series of diplomatic maneuvers centered on his release ensued, including a special French mission sent by Francis' mother Louise of Savoy to the court of Suleiman the Magnificent that would result in an Ottoman ultimatum to Charles‚Äîan unprecedented alignment between Christian and Muslim monarchs that would cause a scandal in the Christian world and lay the foundation for the Franco-Ottoman alliance. Suleiman used the opportunity to invade Hungary in the summer of 1526, defeating Charles' allies at the Battle of Moh√°cs; but, despite these efforts, Francis would sign the Treaty of Madrid, surrendering his claims to Italy, Flanders, and Burgundy. Only a few weeks after his release, however, he repudiated the terms of the treaty, starting the War of the League of Cognac. Although the Italian Wars would continue for another three decades, they would end with France having failed to regain any substantial territories in Italy.  Prelude  By 1518, the peace that had prevailed in Europe after the Battle of Marignano was beginning to crumble. The major powers (France, England, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire) were outwardly friendly, pledging by the Treaty of London to come to the aid of any of the signatories that was attacked and to combine against any nation that broke the peace. They were divided, however, on the question of the Imperial succession. The Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I, intending for a Habsburg to succeed him, began to campaign on behalf of Charles of Spain, while Francis put himself forward as an alternate candidate. At the same time, the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire were forced to deal with the rising influence of Martin Luther, who found support among some Imperial nobles, while Francis was faced with Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who interposed himself into the quarrels of the continent in an attempt to increase both England's influence and his own. The territories controlled by Charles V in 1519 Maximilian's death in 1519 brought the Imperial election to the forefront of European politics. Pope Leo X, threatened by the presence of Spanish troops a mere forty miles from the Vatican, supported the French candidacy. The prince- electors themselves, with the exception of Frederick of Saxony, who refused to countenance the campaigning, promised their support to both candidates at once. Before his death, Maximilian had already promised sums of 500,000 florins to the Electors in exchange for their votes, but Francis offered up to three million, and Charles retaliated by borrowing vast sums from the Fuggers. The final outcome, however, was not determined by the exorbitant bribes, which included Leo promising to make the Archbishop of Mainz his permanent legate. The general outrage of the populace at the idea of a French Emperor gave the Electors pause, and when Charles put an army in the field near Frankfurt, where they were meeting, the Electors obligingly voted for him.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 316‚Äì318. He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 23 October 1520, by which point he already controlled both the Spanish crown and the hereditary Burgundian lands in the Low Countries. Cardinal Wolsey, hoping to increase Henry VIII's influence on the continent, offered the services of England as a mediator for the various disputes between Francis and Charles. Henry and Francis staged an extravagant meeting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Immediately afterwards, Wolsey entertained Charles in Calais. Following the meetings, Wolsey, concerned mainly with improving his own stature in preparation for the next papal conclave, proceeded to stage a hollow arbitration conference at Calais, which lasted until April 1522 to no practical effect. Francis I of France, painted by Jean Clouet. Francis, stymied in his ambition to become Holy Roman Emperor, pushed Europe into war. In December, the French began to plan for war. Francis did not wish to openly attack Charles because Henry had announced his intention to intervene against the first party to break the tenuous peace. Instead, he turned to more covert support for incursions into German and Spanish territory. One attack would be made on the Meuse River, under the leadership of Robert de la Marck. Simultaneously, a French-Navarrese army would advance through Navarre after reconquering St-Jean-Pied-de-Port.Monreal and Jimeno, Conquista, 67. The expedition was nominally led by the 18-year-old Navarrese king Henry d'Albret, whose kingdom had been invaded by Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1512, but the army was effectively commanded by Andr√© de Foix and funded and equipped by the French.Blockmans, Emperor Charles V, 51‚Äì52. The French designs quickly proved flawed as the intervention of Henry of Nassau drove back the Meuse offensive; and although de Foix was initially successful in seizing Pamplona, he was driven from Navarre after being defeated at the Battle of Esquiroz on 30 June 1521.Oman, Art of War, 173‚Äì74. Charles was meanwhile preoccupied with the issue of Martin Luther, whom he confronted at the Diet of Worms in March 1521. The Emperor viewed Catholicism as a natural way of binding the diverse principalities of the Holy Roman Empire to him. Since Pope Leo X, for his part, was unwilling to tolerate such open defiance of his own authority, he and the Emperor were forced to support one another against Luther, who was now backed by Frederick of Saxony and Franz von Sickingen. On 25 May 1521, Charles and Cardinal Girolamo Aleandro, the Papal nuncio, proclaimed the Edict of Worms against Luther. Simultaneously, the Emperor promised the Pope the restoration of Parma and Piacenza to the Medici and of Milan to the Sforza. Leo, needing the Imperial mandate for his campaign against what he viewed as a dangerous heresy, promised to assist in expelling the French from Lombardy, leaving Francis with only the Republic of Venice for an ally.  Initial moves  In June, Imperial armies under Henry of Nassau invaded the north of France, razing the cities of Ardres and Mouzon and besieging Tournai. They were delayed by the dogged resistance of the French, led by Pierre Terrail, Seigneur de Bayard, and Anne de Montmorency, during the Siege of Mezieres, which gave Francis time to gather an army to confront the attack. On 22 October 1521, Francis encountered the main Imperial army, which was commanded by Charles V himself, near Valenciennes. Despite the urging of Charles de Bourbon, Francis hesitated to attack, which allowed Charles time to retreat. When the French were finally ready to advance, the start of heavy rains prevented an effective pursuit and the Imperial forces were able to escape without a battle. Shortly afterwards, French-Navarrese troops under Bonnivet and Claude of Lorraine seized the key city of Fuenterrabia, at the mouth of the Bidasoa River on the Franco-Spanish border, following a protracted series of maneuvers, providing the French with an advantageous foothold in northern Spain that would remain in their hands for the next two years. Battles in Lombardy (1521‚Äì25). The engagements at Bicocca, the Sesia, and Pavia are labeled. By November, the French situation had deteriorated considerably. Charles, Henry VIII, and the Pope signed an alliance against Francis on 28 November.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 88. Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec, the French governor of Milan, was tasked with resisting the Imperial and Papal forces; he was outmatched by Prospero Colonna, however, and by late November had been forced out of Milan and had retreated to a ring of towns around the Adda River.Blockmans, Emperor Charles V, 52 There, Lautrec was reinforced by the arrival of fresh Swiss mercenaries; but, having no money available to pay them, he gave in to their demands to engage the Imperial forces immediately.Oman, Art of War, 176‚Äì78. On 27 April 1522, he attacked Colonna's combined Imperial and Papal army near Milan at the Battle of Bicocca. Lautrec had planned to use his superiority in artillery to his advantage, but the Swiss, impatient to engage the enemy, masked his guns and charged against the entrenched Spanish arquebusiers. In the resulting melee, the Swiss were badly mauled by the Spanish under Fernando d'Avalos, Marquess of Pescara, and by a force of landsknechts commanded by Georg Frundsberg. Their morale broken, the Swiss returned to their cantons; Lautrec, left with too few troops to continue the campaign, abandoned Lombardy entirely.Blockmans, Emperor Charles V, 57; Taylor, Art of War in Italy, 125‚Äì26. Colonna and d'Avalos, left unopposed, proceeded to besiege Genoa, capturing the city on 30 May.Blockmans, Emperor Charles V, 57.  France at bay  Lautrec's defeat brought England openly into the conflict. In late May 1522, the English ambassador presented Francis with an ultimatum enumerating accusations against France, notably that of supporting the Duke of Albany in Scotland, all of which were denied by the king. Henry VIII and Charles signed the Treaty of Windsor on 16 June 1522. The treaty outlined a joint English-Imperial attack against France, with each party providing at least 40,000 men. Charles agreed to compensate England for the pensions that would be lost because of conflict with France and to pay the past debts that would be forfeit; to seal the alliance, he also agreed to marry Henry's only daughter, Mary. In July, the English attacked Brittany and Picardy from Calais. Francis was unable to raise funds to sustain significant resistance, and the English army burned and looted the countryside. Imaginative portrait of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon, by Bernard Gaillot (1835). Alienated from Francis, Bourbon betrayed him and allied himself with Charles V. Francis tried a variety of methods to raise money, but concentrated on a lawsuit against Charles III, Duke of Bourbon. The Duke of Bourbon had received the majority of his holdings through his marriage to Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon, who had died shortly before the start of the war. Louise of Savoy, Suzanne's sister and the king's mother, insisted that the territories in question should pass to her because of her closer kinship to the deceased. Francis was confident that seizing the disputed lands would improve his own financial position sufficiently to continue the war and began to confiscate portions of them in Louise's name. Bourbon, angered by this treatment and increasingly isolated at court, began to make overtures to Charles V to betray the French king.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 25‚Äì26. By 1523, the French situation had entirely collapsed. The death of Doge Antonio Grimani brought Andrea Gritti, a veteran of the War of the League of Cambrai, to power in Venice. He quickly began negotiations with the Emperor and on 29 July concluded the Treaty of Worms, which removed the Republic from the war.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 335; Norwich, History of Venice, 439. Bourbon continued his scheming with Charles, offering to begin a rebellion against Francis in exchange for money and German troops. When Francis, who was aware of the plot, summoned him to Lyon in October, he feigned illness and fled to the Imperial city of Besan√ßon. Enraged, Francis ordered the execution of as many of Bourbon's associates as he could capture, but the Duke himself, having rejected a final offer of reconciliation, openly entered the Emperor's service. Charles then invaded southern France over the Pyrenees. Lautrec successfully defended Bayonne against the Spanish, but Charles was able to recapture Fuenterrabia in February 1524.Blockmans, Emperor Charles V, 45. On 18 September 1523, meanwhile, a massive English army under the Duke of Suffolk advanced into French territory from Calais in conjunction with a Flemish-Imperial force. The French, stretched thin by the Imperial attack, were unable to resist, and Suffolk soon advanced past the Somme, devastating the countryside in his wake and stopping only fifty miles from Paris. When Charles failed to support the English offensive, however, Suffolk‚Äîunwilling to risk an attack on the French capital‚Äîturned away from Paris on 30 October, returning to Calais by mid- December.Gunn, \\"Suffolk's March\\", 631‚Äì33. Guillaume Gouffier, Seigneur de Bonnivet, pencil and chalk drawing by Jean Clouet (c. 1516). Bonnivet commanded a number of French armies during the war. Francis now turned his attention to Lombardy. In October 1523, a French army of 18,000 under Bonnivet advanced through the Piedmont to Novara, where it was joined by a similarly sized force of Swiss mercenaries. Prospero Colonna, who had only 9,000 men to oppose the French advance, retreated to Milan.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 27. Bonnivet, however, overestimated the size of the Imperial army and moved into winter quarters rather than attacking the city; and the Imperial commanders were able to summon 15,000 landsknechts and a large force under Bourbon's command by 28 December, when Charles de Lannoy replaced the dying Colonna.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 27‚Äì28. Many of the Swiss now abandoned the French army, and Bonnivet began his withdrawal. The French defeat at the Battle of the Sesia, where Bayard was killed while commanding the French rearguard, again demonstrated the power of massed arquebusiers against more traditional troops; the French army then retreated over the Alps in disarray.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 28; Taylor, Art of War in Italy, 53‚Äì54. D'Avalos and Bourbon crossed the Alps with nearly 11,000 men and invaded Provence in early July 1524.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 28. Sweeping through most of the smaller towns unopposed, Bourbon entered the provincial capital of Aix-en-Provence on 9 August 1524, taking the title of Count of Provence and pledging his allegiance to Henry VIII in return for the latter's support against Francis.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 28‚Äì29. By mid-August, Bourbon and d'Avalos had besieged Marseille, the only stronghold in Provence that remained in French hands. Their assaults on the city failed, however, and when the French army commanded by Francis himself arrived at Avignon at the end of September 1524, they were forced to retreat back to Italy.Blockmans, Emperor Charles V, 57; Guicciardini, History of Italy, 343‚Äì44; Konstam, Pavia 1525, 29.  Pavia  In mid-October 1524, Francis himself crossed the Alps and advanced on Milan at the head of an army numbering more than 40,000. Bourbon and d'Avalos, their troops not yet recovered from the campaign in Provence, were in no position to offer serious resistance.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 89. The French army moved in several columns, brushing aside Imperial attempts to hold its advance, but failed to bring the main body of Imperial troops to battle. Nevertheless, Charles de Lannoy, who had concentrated some 16,000 men to resist the 33,000 French troops closing on Milan, decided that the city could not be defended and withdrew to Lodi on 26 October.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 30‚Äì33. Having entered Milan and installed Louis II de la Tr√©moille as the governor, Francis (at the urging of Bonnivet and against the advice of his other senior commanders, who favored a more vigorous pursuit of the retreating Lannoy) advanced on Pavia, where Antonio de Leyva remained with a sizable Imperial garrison.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 34. The French advance into Lombardy and the Pavia campaign of 1524‚Äì25. French movements are indicated in blue and Imperial movements in red. The main mass of French troops arrived at Pavia in the last days of October 1524. By 2 November, Montmorency had crossed the Ticino River and invested the city from the south, completing its encirclement. Inside were about 9,000 men, mainly mercenaries whom Antonio de Leyva was able to pay only by melting the church plate.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 34‚Äì35. A period of skirmishing and artillery bombardments followed, and several breaches had been made in the walls by mid- November. On 21 November, Francis attempted an assault on the city through two of the breaches, but was beaten back with heavy casualties; hampered by rainy weather and a lack of gunpowder, the French decided to wait for the defenders to starve.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 36‚Äì39. In early December, a Spanish force commanded by Hugo of Moncada landed near Genoa, intending to interfere in a conflict between pro-Valois and pro-Habsburg factions in the city. Francis dispatched a larger force under Michele Antonio I of Saluzzo to intercept them. Confronted by the more numerous French and left without naval support by the arrival of a pro-Valois fleet commanded by Andrea Doria, the Spanish troops surrendered.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 40‚Äì41. Francis then signed a secret agreement with Pope Clement VII, who pledged not to assist Charles in exchange for Francis's assistance with the conquest of Naples. Against the advice of his senior commanders, Francis detached a portion of his forces under the Duke of Albany and sent them south to aid the Pope.Blockmans, Emperor Charles V, 57; Konstam, Pavia 1525, 42‚Äì43. Lannoy attempted to intercept the expedition near Fiorenzuola, but suffered heavy casualties and was forced to return to Lodi by the intervention of the infamous Black Bands of Giovanni de' Medici, which had just entered French service. Medici then returned to Pavia with a supply train of gunpowder and shot gathered by the Duke of Ferrara; but the French position was simultaneously weakened by the departure of nearly 5,000 Grisons Swiss mercenaries, who returned to their cantons in order to defend them against marauding landsknechts.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 43‚Äì45. Part of The Pavia Tapestry, woven from a cartoon by Bernard van Orley (c. 1531) In January 1525, Lannoy was reinforced by the arrival of Georg Frundsberg with 15,000 fresh landsknechts and renewed the offensive. D'Avalos captured the French outpost at San Angelo, cutting the lines of communication between Pavia and Milan, while a separate column of landsknechts advanced on Belgiojoso and, despite being briefly pushed back by a raid led by Medici and Bonnivet, occupied the town.Blockmans, Emperor Charles V, 59; Konstam, Pavia 1525, 46‚Äì50. By 2 February, Lannoy was only a few miles from Pavia. Francis had encamped the majority of his forces in the great walled park of Mirabello outside the city walls, placing them between Leyva's garrison and the approaching relief army.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 50. Skirmishing and sallies by the garrison continued through the month of February. Medici was seriously wounded and withdrew to Piacenza to recuperate, forcing Francis to recall much of the Milan garrison to offset the departure of the Black Band; but the fighting had little overall effect. On 21 February, the Imperial commanders, running low on supplies and mistakenly believing that the French forces were more numerous than their own, decided to launch an attack on Mirabello Castle in order to save face and demoralize the French sufficiently to ensure a safe withdrawal.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 52‚Äì53. In the early morning of 24 February 1525, Imperial engineers opened breaches in the walls of Mirabello, allowing Lannoy's forces to enter the park. At the same time, Leyva sortied from Pavia with what remained of the garrison. In the ensuing four-hour battle, the French heavy cavalry, which had proven so effective against the Swiss at Marignano ten years prior, masked its own artillery by a rapid advance and was surrounded and cut apart by landsknechts and d'Avalos's massed Spanish arquebusiers. Meanwhile, a series of protracted infantry engagements resulted in the rout of the Swiss and French infantry. The French suffered massive casualties, losing the majority of their army. Bonnivet, Jacques de la Palice, La Tr√©moille, and Richard de la Pole were killed, while Anne de Montmorency, Robert de la Marck, and Francis himself were taken prisoner along with a host of lesser nobles.Konstam, Pavia 1525, 56‚Äì74; Taylor, Art of War in Italy, 126‚Äì27. The night following the battle, Francis gave Lannoy a letter to be delivered to his mother in Paris, in which he related what had befallen him: \\"To inform you of how the rest of my ill-fortune is proceeding, all is lost to me save honour and life, which is safe.\\"Konstam, Pavia 1525, 76. Soon afterwards, he finally learned that the Duke of Albany had lost the larger part of his army to attrition and desertion, and had returned to France without ever having reached Naples.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 348. The broken remnants of the French forces, aside from a small garrison left to hold the Castel Sforzesco in Milan, retreated across the Alps under the nominal command of Charles IV of Alen√ßon, reaching Lyon by March 1525. Western Europe in 1525, after the Battle of Pavia  Madrid  After Pavia, the fate of the French king, and of France itself, became the subject of furious diplomatic manoeuvring. Charles V, lacking funds to pay for the war, decided to forgo the marriage into the House of Tudor which he had promised Henry VIII and sought instead to marry Isabella of Portugal, who would bring with her a more substantial dowry. Bourbon, meanwhile, plotted with Henry to invade and partition France, and at the same time encouraged d'Avalos to seize Naples and declare himself King of Italy.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 358‚Äì59 Louise of Savoy, who had remained as regent in France during her son's absence, attempted to gather troops and funds to defend against an expected invasion of Artois by English troops.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 357‚Äì58. She also sent a first French mission to Suleiman the Magnificent requesting assistance, but the mission was lost on its way in Bosnia.Merriman, Suleiman the Magnificent, 129. In December 1525 a second mission was sent, led by John Frangipani, which managed to reach Constantinople, the Ottoman capital, with secret letters asking for the deliverance of king Francis I and an attack on the Habsburg. Frangipani returned with an answer from Suleiman, on 6 February 1526, initiating the first steps of a Franco-Ottoman alliance. Suleiman eventually wrote an ultimatum to Charles, asking for the immediate release of Francis‚Äîand demanding a yearly tax from the Holy Roman Empire; when this was not forthcoming, the Ottomans launched an invasion of Hungary in the summer of 1526, aiming to reach Vienna. Francis, convinced that he would regain his freedom if he could obtain a personal audience with Charles, pressed d'Avalos and Lannoy, who had intended to transport the king to the Castel Nuovo in Naples, to send him to Spain instead. Concerned by Bourbon's scheming, they agreed and Francis arrived in Barcelona on 12 June.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 358;Guicciardini notes that he did not \\"know whether [Francis believed this] because he measured men by his own nature; or because men easily delude themselves when their own desires are involved.\\" Francis was initially held in a villa in Benisan√≥, near Valencia, but Charles, urged to negotiate a settlement by Montmorency and Lannoy, who suggested that the Italians would soon prove unfaithful to their Imperial alliance, ordered the king brought to Madrid and imprisoned in the citadel there.Knecht, Renaissance Warrior, 242. However, Charles adamantly refused to receive Francis personally until the latter had accepted an agreement.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 359. Meanwhile, Henry II of Navarre, who had fought alongside Francis at Pavia and who had been imprisoned in Madrid as well, escaped. The struggle for Navarre continued, with Charles occupying the southern fringes of Lower Navarre and Henry remaining at large.Urzainqui et al., Conquista de Navarra, 21. Charles demanded not only the surrender of Lombardy, but also of Burgundy and Provence, forcing Francis to argue that French law prevented him from surrendering any lands possessed by the crown without the approval of Parlement, which would not be forthcoming.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 357. The Imperial demands were first delivered to Francis by B√ºren, the Emperor's chamberlain, when he was still imprisoned in the fortress of Pizzichitone after the Battle of Pavia; Charles had originally intended that Bourbon would be given an independent Provence as a reward for his services. Charles V Visits Fran√ßois Ier After the Battle of Pavia by Richard Parkes Bonington (watercolor on paper, c. 1827) In September, Francis fell gravely ill, and his sister, Marguerite de Navarre, rode from Paris to join him in Spain.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 359 The Imperial doctors examining the king believed that his illness was caused by his sorrow at not being received by the Emperor, and urged Charles to visit him. Against the advice of his Grand Chancellor, Mercurino Gattinara (who argued that seeing Francis on his deathbed was an action motivated by mercenary concerns rather than by compassion, and was thus unworthy of the Emperor) Charles consented; and Francis soon made a complete recovery.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 360. An attempt to escape, however, proved fruitless, and succeeded only in getting Marguerite sent back to France. The final frontiers of France after the Peace of Cateau-Cambr√©sis in 1559. Despite more than three decades of further warfare, the French failed to regain any of their former possessions in Lombardy. By the beginning of 1526, Charles was faced with demands from Venice and the Pope to restore Francesco II Sforza to the throne of the Duchy of Milan, and had become anxious to achieve a settlement with the French before another war began. Francis, having argued to retain Burgundy without result, was prepared to surrender it to achieve his own release.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 363. On 14 January 1526, Charles and Francis agreed to the Treaty of Madrid, by which the French king renounced all his claims in Italy, Flanders, and Artois, surrendered Burgundy to Charles, agreed to send two of his sons to be hostages at the Spanish court, and promised to marry Charles' sister Eleanor and to restore to Bourbon the territories that had been seized from him.Blockmans, Emperor Charles V, 60, 68; Guicciardini, History of Italy, 363‚Äì64; Oman, Art of War, 211. Francis, who held the title of \\"Most Christian King\\", also agreed to persuade Henry to relinquish the throne of Navarre in favor of Charles \\"in order to uproot the errors of the Lutheran sect and the rest of condemned sects\\".Urzainqui et al., Conquista de Navarra, 21. The agreement also reiterated the need to destroy \\"the Infidels\\". Francis was released on 6 March and, escorted by Lannoy, journeyed north to Fuenterrabia. On 18 March, he crossed the Bidasoa north into France, while at the same time the Dauphin and his brother, who had been brought to Bayonne by Louise and Lautrec, crossed into Spain and into captivity.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 366. By this time, Francis had attained peace with England by the Treaty of Hampton Court; drafted by Thomas Wolsey and the French ambassador at the Hampton Court Palace, the treaty was signed in 1526, and was ratified by a French delegation in April 1527 at Greenwich. Francis, however, had no intentions of complying with the remaining provisions of the Treaty of Madrid. On 22 March, with the Pope's blessing, he proclaimed that he would not be bound by the Treaty of Madrid because it had been signed under duress. Clement VII, who had meanwhile become convinced that the Emperor's growing power was a threat to his own position in Italy, sent envoys to Francis and Henry VIII suggesting an alliance against Charles.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 365‚Äì66. Guicciardini records that Clement feared that \\"the Emperor's greatness would inevitably mean his servitude.\\" Henry, having received nothing from the Treaty of Madrid, was receptive to the offers. In May, Francis and the Pope launched the War of the League of Cognac in an attempt to reclaim the territory the French had lost; Henry, rebuffed in his attempt to have the alliance signed in England, would not join until 1527.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 369, 392. The war would prove unsuccessful; but Francis and his successor, Henry II, would continue to assert their claims to Milan through the remainder of the Italian Wars, only relinquishing them after the Peace of Cateau-Cambr√©sis in 1559.

Background The song's lyrics describe racing a souped-up \\"air-mobile\\" down the New Jersey Turnpike, then unfolding its wings and taking off. At the time, the Aerocar designed and built by Molt Taylor was nearing Civil Aviation Authority approval for mass production as a flying car with detachable folding wings. Berry's song was featured in the 1956 film Rock, Rock, Rock and was one of the four songs from the film that was included on the \\"soundtrack\\" album (the only one of his songs to be used both in the movie and on the album). The lyrics refer to two previous hits by Berry, \\"Maybellene\\" and \\"Wee Wee Hours\\". It was originally recorded in May 1955 at Chess Studios during the same session for those two songs. Cover versions Berry's music publisher, Morris Levy, sued John Lennon for copyright infringement because of the melodic similarity between \\"You Can't Catch Me\\" and the Beatles' 1969 song \\"Come Together\\", written by Lennon, and because the Beatles' song used some of the lyrics of Berry's song (\\"here come old flat- top\\"). The suit was settled out of court. As part of the settlement, Lennon included a rendition of \\"You Can't Catch Me\\" on his 1975 album of cover versions, Rock 'n' Roll. Cover versions of the song were also recorded by Sleepy LaBeef for a 1963 single, by The Rolling Stones for their 1965 album The Rolling Stones No. 2, and by The Blues Project for their 1966 album Projections.

It is named for Adam Kohlenberg (March 11, 1819 ‚Äì January 1, 1868), a station agent and first town merchant who owned much of present-day Adamstown. As of the 2010 census, the Adamstown CDP had a population of 2,372.  History  Adamstown lies in the fertile valley between Sugarloaf and Catoctin Mountain on the former Carrollton Manor, a estate originally owned by Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Until 2000, it was a little-altered representative of mid-19th century linear town planning. It is significant in architecture for its variety of structures, including residential, commercial, industrial, educational, agricultural, and religious buildings. The late 18th century road from Jefferson to Greenfield Mills on the Monocacy River, originally called the Bridal Road, followed the route of the present-day Mountville Road. The 1832 arrival of the railroad to the manor created the economic and transportation impetus for the development of the community. Adamstown was first known as \\"Davis' Warehouse\\" because Dr. Meredith Davis, a leading Quaker county miller, built a warehouse about 1835 where Mountville Road, by then called Jefferson Road, crossed the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad ( southwest of Frederick) to store flour from his Greenfield Mills. The first settler in Adamstown was Robert Palmer, an African American \\"post and railer\\" who also ran a general store around 1835. In 1840 when Adam Kohlenburg was appointed the first B&O; railway agent, the community became known as \\"Adamstown\\", after his given name. He was also the first postmaster and ran a general store located in the lot between his brick Italianate-style home and the railroad. Edward Hebb laid off lots on the north side of the railroad in the 1840s. Daniel Rhodes of Pennsylvania, the first white settler, was so impressed with the location, he bought a tract of land and laid it off into 12 building lots on the south side of the railroad in 1856. With Adamstown located so close to the Potomac River and Virginia, its citizens were almost exclusively loyal to the South during the Civil War; however, both Federal and Confederate troops were constantly moving on Carrollton Manor. For several months in the spring of 1861, the Minute Men of Adamstown, a secession militia company composed of three officers (Captain Robert H. E. Boteler, 1st Lieutenant Jacob G. Thomas, and 2nd Lieutenant William Hilleary Johnson, all local doctors) planted a pole and flew the Confederate flag adjacent to their guard post next to the B&O; railroad. Many skirmishes in the war were fought here and the town was often raided, most notoriously by the 43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry, also known as Mosby's Rangers, on July 30 and October 14, 1864. On one of these raids, Adam Kohlenburg's entire stock was taken. Local folklore holds that one family had a son fighting for the North and one fighting for the South. In 1902, Jacob Klein's Addition to Adamstown included the area of Washington, Adams, and Tuscarora streets. The Adamstown Bank was established in 1917, and the building opened in 1919. In 1921, Adamstown had two large grain elevators (Farmers Exchange of Frederick and Thomas & Co.), a blacksmith shop, a carriage works, two garages, a general store, a hardware store, a butcher shop and the bank. Electric lights were first installed in the town in 1921 as well. Culture The largest area-wide event is the Carroll Manor Fire Company Carnival, which is held every June.  Demographics  Three new developments with a total of 540 homes have been constructed in Adamstown since 2000 (Green Hill Manor, Saddle Ridge and Adamstown Commons). The population in 1880 was 66 and approximately 500 in 1971. As of the census of 2000, there were 2,920 people, 1,049 households and 829 families residing in Adamstown. The racial makeup of the county was 92.7% White, 4.9% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 0.2% from other races, and 1.3% from two or more races. 1.6% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. There were 1,049 households, out of which 36.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 69.3% were married couples living together, 5.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 21.0% were non-families. 20.10% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.77 and the average family size was 3.12. Adamstown's population was spread out, with 28.8% under the age of 19, 2.9% from 20 to 24, 29.4% from 25 to 44, 24.3% from 45 to 64, and 14.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39.5 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.46 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97 males.  Business  The largest local business is Trans-Tech, which manufactures RF microwave components. Other businesses in Adamstown Proper along Mountville Rd include Stups Market, Garden and Vintage Goods @ Adamstown, C&H; Supply Company, Italia New York Pizza II, DeFrehn Consulting Investment Advisory Service, Brittany DeFrehn Photography and Elegant Forever Bridal Shop. Eastalco, an aluminum smelting plant, curtailed operations in December 2005 when it was unable to continue purchasing electricity at a price they could afford due to electric deregulation in the State of Maryland. Eastalco is in the process of dismantling its plant and selling the property.  Education  Carroll Manor Elementary School services area children from pre-kindergarten through 5th grade. The school also houses part of Frederick County's Challenges Program, a special program for children with autism and other severe communication disorders, and a special education pre- kindergarten. The school is supported by the Carroll Manor Elementary School PTAPTA. Current school district boundaries designate Ballenger Creek Middle School and Tuscarora High School for continued education.

Fission-track dating is a relatively simple method of radiometric dating that has made a significant impact on understanding the thermal history of continental crust, the timing of volcanic events, and the source and age of different archeological artifacts. The method involves using the number of fission events produced from the spontaneous decay of uranium-238 in common accessory minerals to date the time of rock cooling below closure temperature. Fission tracks are sensitive to heat, and therefore the technique is useful at unraveling the thermal evolution of rocks and minerals. Most current research using fission tracks is aimed at: a) understanding the evolution of mountain belts; b) determining the source or provenance of sediments; c) studying the thermal evolution of basins; d) determining the age of poorly dated strata; and e) dating and provenance determination of archeological artifacts. Method Unlike other isotopic dating methods, the \\"daughter\\" in fission track dating is an effect in the crystal rather than a daughter isotope. Uranium-238 undergoes spontaneous fission decay at a known rate, and it is the only isotope with a decay rate that is relevant to the significant production of natural fission tracks; other isotopes have fission decay rates too slow to be of consequence. The fragments emitted by this fission process leave trails of damage (fossil tracks or ion tracks) in the crystal structure of the mineral that contains the uranium. The process of track production is essentially the same by which swift heavy ions produce ion tracks. Chemical etching of polished internal surfaces of these minerals reveals spontaneous fission tracks, and the track density can be determined. Because etched tracks are relatively large (in the range 1 to 15 micrometres), counting can be done by optical microscopy, although other imaging techniques are used. The density of fossil tracks correlates with the cooling age of the sample and with uranium content, which needs to be determined independently. To determine the uranium content, several methods have been used. One method is by neutron irradiation, where the sample is irradiated with thermal neutrons in a nuclear reactor, with an external detector, such as mica, affixed to the grain surface. The neutron irradiation induces fission of uranium-235 in the sample, and the resulting induced tracks are used to determine the uranium content of the sample because the 235U:238U ratio is well known and assumed constant in nature. However it is not always constant. To determine the number of induced fission events that occurred during neutron irradiation an external detector is attached to the sample and both sample and detector are simultaneously irradiated by thermal neutrons. The external detector is typically a low-uranium mica flake, but plastics such as CR-39 have also been used. The resulting induced fission of the uranium-235 in the sample creates induced tracks in the overlying external detector, which are later revealed by chemical etching. The ratio of spontaneous to induced tracks is proportional to the age. Another method of determining uranium concentration is through LA-ICPMS, a technique where the crystal is hit with a laser beam and ablated, and then the material is passed through a mass spectrometer. Applications Unlike many other dating techniques, fission-track dating is uniquely suited for determining low- temperature thermal events using common accessory minerals over a very wide geological range (typically 0.1 Ma to 2000 Ma). Apatite, sphene, zircon, micas and volcanic glass typically contain enough uranium to be useful in dating samples of relatively young age (Mesozoic and Cenozoic) and are the materials most useful for this technique. Additionally low-uranium epidotes and garnets may be used for very old samples (Paleozoic to Precambrian). The fission-track dating technique is widely used in understanding the thermal evolution of the upper crust, especially in mountain belts. Fission tracks are preserved in a crystal when the ambient temperature of the rock falls below the annealing temperature. This annealing temperature varies from mineral to mineral and is the basis for determining low-temperature vs. time histories. While the details of closure temperatures are complicated, they are approximately 70 to 110 ¬∞C for typical apatite, c. 230 to 250 ¬∞C for zircon, and c. 300 ¬∞C for titanite. Because heating of a sample above the annealing temperature causes the fission damage to heal or anneal, the technique is useful for dating the most recent cooling event in the history of the sample. This resetting of the clock can be used to investigate the thermal history of basin sediments, kilometer-scale exhumation caused by tectonism and erosion, low temperature metamorphic events, and geothermal vein formation. The fission track method has also been used to date archaeological sites and artifacts. It was used to confirm the potassium-argon dates for the deposits at Olduvai Gorge. = Provenance analysis of detrital grains = A number of datable minerals occur as common detrital grains in sandstones, and if the strata have not been buried too deeply, these minerals grains retain information about the source rock. Fission track analysis of these minerals provides information about the thermal evolution of the source rocks and therefore can be used to understand provenance and the evolution of mountain belts that shed the sediment.http://rimg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/extract/58/1/205 This technique of detrital analysis is most commonly applied to zircon because it is very common and robust in the sedimentary system, and in addition it has a relatively high annealing temperature so that in many sedimentary basins the crystals are not reset by later heating. Fission-track dating of detrital zircon is a widely applied analytical tool used to understand the tectonic evolution of source terrains that have left a long and continuous erosional record in adjacent basin strata. Early studies focused on using the cooling ages in detrital zircon from stratigraphic sequences to document the timing and rate of erosion of rocks in adjacent orogenic belts (mountain ranges). A number of recent studies have combined U/Pb and/or Helium dating (U+Th/He) on single crystals to document the specific history of individual crystals. This double-dating approach is an extremely powerful provenance tool because a nearly complete crystal history can be obtained, and therefore researchers can pinpoint specific source areas with distinct geologic histories with relative certainty.http://geology.gsapubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/36/12/915 Fission- track ages on detrital zircon can be as young as 1 Ma to as old as 2000 Ma.http://minerva.union.edu/ft2008/Abstract_volume.html  See also  * thermochronology References Further reading * Naeser, C.

He is noted for his forthright style of football commentary and has been involved in several controversies and disputes with managers including Alex Ferguson and Sam Allardyce. He also works in the MLS as Atlanta United play by play lead announcer for Fox Sports South and Fox Sports Southeast. Career Alan Green attended Methodist College Belfast. After gaining an honours degree in modern history from Queen's University Belfast He worked in local newspapers until he moved to the BBC in 1975 as a news trainee with the ambition of becoming a TV news producer. Green presented current affairs on both radio and television in Northern Ireland, before he moved to Manchester, joining BBC Radio's sport department. Green's first World Cup as a BBC commentator was in 1982 and in 1986 Green made his debut covering the FA Cup Final as the junior commentary partner to Peter Jones. He returned to the Cup final in 1988 and following Jones' untimely death he covered every FA cup final from 1990 to 2016, missing only 2010 due to ill health. In 1989, Green was present at the Hillsborough disaster with Jones. In a 2009 radio programme marking the 20th anniversary of the disaster, Green spoke of his bitterness that justice had been denied for the 96 people who died at Hillsborough. Green's forthright commentary style has often divided opinion among radio listeners. He has won the admiration of some listeners for his honest assessments of football games and for his uncompromising opinions. Green has disputed the notion that the English Premier League is the greatest in the world. In 2013, Green wrote an article in which he said: \\"The Premier League I see week in, week out, isn't remotely as good as it thinks it is.\\" In the article for the Belfast Telegraph, Green criticised what he called \\"woeful defending\\", \\"selfish, oafish behaviour\\" and \\"the underwhelming, overpaid footballers that populate the Premier League.\\" In an interview with The Observer in 2009, Green said of his career as a sports commentator: \\"Apart from one time in 1984, I've never applied for a television job.\\" Green said that he told a BSkyB executive, who had floated the idea of him moving from radio to the satellite channel, that he is too outspoken to work for Sky TV. The Sky executive implored Green to \\"always accentuate the positive\\". Green told him that his role as a commentator was \\"to tell the truth, not to act as a propagandist.\\" Green debuted as a commentator on BBC 1's Match of the Day on 13 September 2014, covering highlights of the Premier League game between West Brom and Everton. He later covered Steven Gerrard's last match for Liverpool at Anfield. In July 2015, Green featured as the narrator on the Channel 4 programme Lookalikes. He was the lead play by play announcer for Atlanta United (MLS) for Fox Sports South and Fox Sports Southeast for the inaugural 2017 season. His BBC 5Live contract was not renewed following the 2019/20 football season.https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/alan-greens- anger-as-bbc-shows-him-the-door-after-45-years-39031014.html =Disputes with football managers= Green had a long-standing dispute with Alex FergusonTheir feud is such a central part of our football folklore that any game involving Green's commentary and Manchester United makes for compelling listening. following an incident in which Green said on air that he was \\"learning not to believe the propaganda that comes out of the Manchester United manager's office\\". Green felt that he had been deliberately misled by Ferguson giving him inaccurate team news the day before a match. In 2009, Green said of Ferguson: \\"He either bullies or frightens. It's the way he exerts his control over the media. He would be a fantastic propaganda minister. He knows how to manipulate and some of my colleagues take it in.\\" In 2006, Green was banned from Bolton Wanderers' Reebok Stadium after accusing manager Sam Allardyce of playing \\"ugly\\" football. Following Allardyce's departure to Newcastle United, the club invited Green back.The Bolton News, daily, Wanderers, Phil Gartside, Kelly, Reebok Stadium, tv, video, Bolton MP In an article for The Belfast Telegraph in 2010, Green wrote: \\"Am I alone in thinking Sam Allardyce must be the most arrogant football manager that's ever lived?\\" In January 2013, Green criticised Allardyce's style of play at West Ham United, which he described as \\"hitting the ball long and high to a big man up front.\\" =Other controversies= In 2004, Green was censured by Ofcom after he made a comment live on-air about Manchester United's Cameroonian midfielder Eric Djemba- Djemba speaking pidgin English with the referee. Green said that Djemba-Djemba was saying \\"me no cheat\\" to the referee. A listener complained that it was inappropriate to suggest a black man was unable to speak grammatical English. Green had previously described Manchester City's Chinese defender Sun Jihai as wearing shirt \\"Number 17 ‚Äì that'll be the Chicken Chow Mein, then\\" during a live radio broadcast.sp!ked review of books  In 2005, Green had a dispute with Everton fans after he wrote an article in which he suggested that manager David Moyes, \\"instead of raising expectations after Everton's fourth-place finish the previous season, should suppress them.\\" Green's article led to him receiving some death threats. In 2007, Green commentated on a match between Everton and Reading at Goodison Park. Film star Sylvester Stallone was paraded on the pitch and Green joked about whether Stallone's limousine would still have wheels when he returned to it. This prompted an official complaint to the BBC by Liverpool City Council, upset at his stereotypical views about car crime in the city.Radio Today with United Radio..: Five Live upsets Liverpool Green is reported to have fallen out with a number of his broadcasting colleagues over the years. In 2009, Green was reported to have had a rift with former fellow BBC broadcaster Mark Saggers, that surfaced in on-air exchanges. Saggers left the BBC to join rival Talksport at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 English football season.Mark Saggers lifted by new role with BBC's rivals In June 2016, Green stated that he would boycott the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia due to the \\"horrendous atmosphere\\" he had experienced on previous trips to Russia.

His full royal title was Kambawsarahta Thiri Pawaramahawuntha Thudamaraza. He was a well-respected Shan political figure in Burma. His residence in Nyaung Shwe (Yawnghwe), the Haw, is now the \\"Buddha Museum\\" and is open to the public. Early life Born on 16 October 1895,His birth year is reported as either 1894 or 1896. (Seekins 2006: 410‚Äì411) gives 1894. (Sarpay Beikman 1952) says that he was born on 16 October 1896 in the Burmese year of 1257. But both cannot be true since 1257 ME lasted between 15 April 1895 and 14 April 1896, and 16 October 1896 fell in 1258 ME; thus, he was born either on 16 October 1895 (14th waning of Thadingyut 1257 ME), or a year later on 16 October 1896 (10th waxing of Thadingyut 1258 ME). His name Shwe Thaik, assuming he was named according to traditional Burmese naming customs, suggests he was born on a Wednesday. Since 16 October 1895 was a Wednesday and 16 October 1896 was a Friday, he was probably born on Wednesday, 16 October 1895. Shwe Thaik was educated at the Shan Chiefs School in Taunggyi. He then entered the British military service during World War I, and also served in the Northeast Frontier Service from 1920‚Äì1923. In September 1927, he was chosen as successor to his uncle as saopha of Yawnghwe by the Federated Shan States' Council of Ministers.Seekins 2006: 410‚Äì411 He officially assumed office on 8 March 1929.(Kyaw 2013) He again served in the military service from 1939 to 1942. He was married five times; his best-known wife was the first, Sao Nang Hearn Hkam, sister of the Saopha of North Hsenwi Sao Hom Hpa.Hsenwi (Shan Princely State) He had a total of three children. President Sao Shwe Thaik became the president of the Union of Burma on 4 January 1948 at its independence, served as the head of state until 16 March 1952. The following is his first presidential address to the nation on the day of independence, 4 January 1948. :Let us rejoice at the independence which has come to us today, the result of sacrifices undergone by us and those who preceded us in the years that have passed. Let us rejoice also that the independence has come not as a result of armed conflict but as the fruit of friendly negotiations with that great nation whose political bonds we replace by mutual consent to-day with the stronger bonds of friendship and goodwill. :Today is for us not only a day of freedom but also a day of reunion. For a long time, the principal races of Burma, the Kachins and the Chins have tended to look upon themselves as separate national units. Of late, a nobler vision, the vision of a Union of Burma, has moved our hearts, and we stand united to-day as one nation determined to work in unity and concord for the advancement of Burma‚Äôs interests and for the speedy attainment of her due position as one of the great nations of the world. It is unity which has brought our struggle for independence to this early fruition and may unity continue to be the watchword for every member of the Sovereign Independent Republic to be henceforth known as the Union of Burma. Excerpt from \\"the White Umbrella\\" by Patricia Elliot (Pg. 206‚Äì207) On 4 January 1949, a mass rally was held outside City Hall to mark the first anniversary of Independence Day. As head of state, (he) addressed the crowd. To his credit, he didn't serve up the previous year's menu of brave words and high purpose. Instead he issued a warning. :Co- operation and understanding cannot come about so long as the element of violence or threat of violence exists, for violence has no counterpart in freedom, and liberty ends where violence begins. The progressive retreat of democracy in the world today is mainly due to the worship by nations of the cult of physical force. The deterioration in this direction has been such that the much-vaunted democracies are nowadays hardly distinguishable from totalitarian states. He made a direct stab at his own country's deteriorating political situation with insurgencies and armed conflicts. Speaker of the Chamber of Nationalities After this term as president, he was the speaker of the Chamber of Nationalities, the upper house, from 1950 to 1962. In the military coup of March 1962 he was arrested by the Union Revolutionary Council headed by General Ne Win and died in prison in November 1962. One of his sons, 17 at that time, was killed in the March 1962 military coup, apparently the only casualty on the day of the coup.

The state of Chihuahua was created on July 6, 1824, as one of the original states of the federation recognized by the 1824 Constitution. It has survived through all the different systems of government Mexico has had, both the federal system and the central system, and so its status has changed between that of a state and a department; along with that, the denomination of the holder of the executive power also changed. In order to be elected, the Governor must be under the Constitution of Mexico a Mexican citizen by birth, not less than 30 years of age, and a native or resident of Chihuahua for at least 5 years prior to inauguration.

It is primarily suited for people who have conductive hearing losses, unilateral hearing loss, single-sided deafness and people with mixed hearing losses who cannot otherwise wear 'in the ear' or 'behind the ear' hearing aids. They are more expensive than conventional hearing aids, and their placement involves invasive surgery which carries a risk of complications, although when complications do occur, they are usually minor. Two of the causes of hearing loss are lack of function in the inner ear (cochlea) and when the sound has problems in reaching the nerve cells of the inner ear. Examples of the first include age-related hearing loss and hearing loss due to noise exposure. A patient born without external ear canals is an example of the latter for which a conventional hearing aid with a mould in the ear canal opening would not be effective. Some with this condition have normal inner ear function, as the external ear canal and the inner ear are developed at different stages during pregnancy. With normal inner anatomy, sound conducted by the skull bone improves hearing. A vibrator with a steel spring over the head or in heavy frames of eyeglasses pressed towards the bone behind the ear has been used to bring sound to the inner ear. This has, however, several disadvantages, such as discomfort and pain due to the pressure needed. The sound quality is also impaired as much of the sound energy is lost in the soft tissue over the skull bone, particularly for the higher sound frequencies important for speech understanding in noise.  Medical use  A sound processor behind the ear Bone-anchored hearing aids use a surgically implanted abutment to transmit sound by direct conduction through bone to the inner ear, bypassing the external auditory canal and middle ear. A titanium prosthesis is surgically embedded into the skull with a small abutment exposed outside the skin. A sound processor sits on this abutment and transmits sound vibrations to the titanium implant. The implant vibrates the skull and inner ear, which stimulate the nerve fibers of the inner ear, allowing hearing. The surgery is often performed under local anesthesia and as an outpatient procedure. An important piece of information for patients is that if they for whatever reason are not satisfied with the BAHA solution, removing the implant is easy. No other ear surgical procedure is reversible like this. By bypassing the outer or middle ear, BAHA can increase hearing in noisy situations and help localise sounds. In addition to improved speech understanding, it results in a natural sound with less distortion and feedback compared with conventional hearing aids. The ear canal is left open for comfort, and helps to reduce any problems caused by chronic ear infections or allergies. In patients with single-sided sensorineural deafness, BAHA sends the sound by the skull bone from the deaf side to the inner ear of the hearing side. This transfer of sound gives a 360¬∞ sound awareness. BAHAs may facilitate normal language development. = Chronic ear disease = This fairly common condition is often associated with continuous or intermittent drainage from the ear canal. These patients may also have a hearing loss and need amplification. A conventional air conduction aid with a mold placed in the ear canal opening may not be appropriate due to the drainage, and may even provoke drainage. If the hearing loss is significant an air conduction aid may have difficulty overcoming the dysfunction of the eardrum and middle ear bones. Bone conduction hearing device bypassing the middle ear may be a more appropriate treatment for these patients. Good transmission of sound in the bone, with reduced attenuation and distortion may be possible. = Single-sided deafness = A person with unilateral hearing loss may have functional difficulty hearing even when the other ear is normal, particularly in demanding situations such as noisy environments and when several people are speaking the same time. A complication in single-sided deafness is hearing impairment in the hearing ear. Conventional ear surgery involves a risk of hearing loss due to the surgical procedure. Most ear surgeons are thus reluctant to perform surgery on an only hearing ear. The BAHA surgery avoids this risk and may be an appropriate treatment. An extended trial of a BAHA system with a headband prior to surgery led to more realistic expectations. In the trial, 50% of the candidates wished to proceed to surgery. = External ear canal problems = Irritation in the external ear canal due to inflammation or eczema may be a condition for which a conventional air conduction aid is not an appropriate treatment. Direct bone conduction may be an option. = Malformations = Patients with malformations are not always suitable for reconstructive surgery. Treacher Collins syndrome patients may have significant malformations with ossicular defects and an abnormal route of the facial nerve. These structures, as well as the inner ear, could be in danger at surgery. Patients with Down syndrome may have a narrow ear canal and middle ear malformation leading to impaired hearing. Some part of the cognitive delay seen in these children may be partly due to their poor hearing. The surgery can only take place once the skull is at least 2.5 mm thick. Children who suffer certain syndromes may have a slighter build, thinner bone, or unusual anatomy. Other children may have a thicker skull at a younger age, so it is difficult to give a specific age for surgery. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration only approves BAHA implantation of children aged five years or older. For infants and young children prior to surgery, the sound processor can be worn on a head band or soft band which the infant wears to hold it against the skull.  Side effects  Complications of BAHA systems can be considered as either related to the bone (hard tissue) or the soft tissue. * Bone ** Failure of osseointegration ** Chronic infection ** Trauma * Soft tissue ** Irritation of the skin surrounding the implant ** Skin flap necrosis (death of the skin flap, e.g. due to interrupted blood supply) ** Overgrowth of skin over the device ** Wound dehiscence (splitting apart of the wound) ** Bleeding or hematoma formation ** Persistent pain Soft-tissue complications are much more common, and most are managed with topical treatments. Children are more likely to suffer both kinds of complications than adults. Sometimes, a second surgical procedure is required. Complications are less likely with good wound hygiene. Other drawbacks of BAHA include accidental or spontaneous loss of the bone implant, and patient refusal for treatment due to stigma.  Surgical procedure  The bone behind the ear is exposed through a U-shaped or straight incision or with the help of a specially designed BAHA dermatome. A hole, 3 or 4 mm deep depending on the thickness of the bone, is drilled. The hole is widened and the implant with the mounted coupling is inserted under generous cooling to minimize surgical trauma to the bone. Some surgeons perform a reduction of the subcutaneous soft tissue. The rationale for this is to reduce the mobility between implant and skin to avoid inflammation at the penetration site. This reduction of the soft tissue has been questioned and some surgeons do not perform any or a minimum of it. The rationale for this is that any surgery will result in some scar tissue that could be the focus of infection. The infections seen early during the development of the surgical procedure could perhaps be explained by the lack of seal between implant and abutment allowing bacteria to enter the space. A new helium tight seal may be advantageous and prevent biofilm formation. This will also allow the surgeon to use longer abutments should a need exist. Three to six weeks later or even earlier, the audiologist will fit and adjust the hearing processor according to the patient's hearing level. The fitting will be made using a special program in a computer. The original surgical procedure has been described in detail by Tjellstr√∂m et al. 2001.  Handling  An implant shown in actual size in adult hand An area where skin is penetrated requires care and cleaning because of the risk of inflammation around the abutment. Daily cleaning is required.  Small children  Hearing is of importance for a normal speech development. The skull bone in children is often very thin and softer than in the adult. Surgery is thus often delayed until the age of four to five years. In the meantime, the child with bilateral atresia can be fitted with a band around the head with a coupling for a BAHA. This may be done at the age of one month. Infants at this age may tolerate this well.  History  Patients with chronic ear infection where the drum and/or the small bones in the middle ear are damaged often have hearing loss, but difficulties in using a hearing aid fitted in the ear canal. Direct bone conduction through a vibrator attached to a skin-penetrating implant addresses these disadvantages. In 1977, the first three patients were implanted with a bone-conduction hearing solution by Anders Tjellstr√∂m at the Ear, Nose, and Throat Department at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden. A 4-mm-long titanium screw with a diameter of 3.75 mm was inserted in the bone behind the ear, and a bone conduction hearing aid was attached. The term osseointegration was coined by Professor Br√•nemark. During animal studies, he found the bone tissue attached to the titanium implant without any soft tissue in between. He also showed an such an implant could take a heavy load. His definition of osseointegration was \\"direct contact between living bone and an implant that can take a load\\". The first clinical application of titanium was in oral surgery, where implants were used for retention of dentures. Br√•nemark sought an acoustic way to evaluate osseointegration. A patient with implants in the jaws was fitted with a bone vibrator on one of his implants. When tested, the patient experienced very loud sound even at low stimulation levels, indicating sound could propagate very well in the bone. It has later been shown by H√•kansson that the sound transmission in bone is linear, indicating low distortion of the sound. The implant in the bone is made of titanium and will osseointegrate. The hearing instrument is impedance-matched. Osseointegration has been defined as the direct contact between living bone and an implant that can take a load, with no soft tissue at the interface.  Costs  In the US, the cost of the Baha device is about $4,000. In the Netherlands, the cost of the device is around ‚Ç¨3000 (in 2008). The cost of the titanium implant, surgery, and aftercare from surgeon and audiologist must also be considered.

Early life She was born Iris Guiver Wilkinson in Cape Town, South Africa to an English father and an Australian mother, and was taken to Wellington, New Zealand before her first birthday. She had her secondary education at Wellington Girls' College, where she wrote poetry and short stories for the school magazine. After school she briefly attended Victoria University of Wellington. When she was 18, Hyde suffered a knee injury which required a hospital operation. Lameness and pain haunted her for the rest of her life. In 1925 she became a journalist for Wellington's Dominion newspaper, mostly writing for the women's pages. She continued to support herself through journalism throughout her life. Later life While working at the Dominion, she had a brief love affair with Harry Sweetman, who left her to travel to England. In 1926, in Rotorua for a holiday and treatment for her tubercular knee, Hyde had an affair with Frederick de Mulford Hyde. When Hyde fell pregnant, Frederick paid for her to have the child in Sydney, Australia. Their son, Christopher Robin Hyde, was stillborn. She was to adopt the name 'Robin Hyde' as a 'nom de guerre', to preserve his memory. On her return to New Zealand in December 1926, she discovered that Frederick had married. Traumatised by the loss of her child, Hyde was hospitalised at Queen Mary Hospital in Hanmer Springs and then cared for at the family home in Wellington, though only her mother knew of the pregnancy.Challis, Derek and Rawlinson, Gloria (2002), The Book of Iris: A Life of Robin Hyde, Auckland University Press After a period of recovery, she began to write again, publishing poetry in several New Zealand newspapers in 1927. She was also engaged to write columns for the Christchurch Sun, and the Mirror. However, she became frustrated at the lack of creative input, as the papers merely wanted a social column. Social columns or women's pages were the main outlet available to women journalists during the period. These experiences contributed to her treatise on journalism in New Zealand, Journalese, published in 1934. In 1930, while working for the Wanganui Chronicle, Hyde had an affair with the Marton-based journalist Harry Lawson Smith. Their son, Derek Arden Challis, was born in Picton that October. Lawson Smith was married, and his only relationship with Hyde and their son was to provide sporadic maintenance payments. In time Hyde's mother learned of Derek's existence, but her father was never told.Challis, Derek and Rawlinson, Gloria (2002), The Book of Iris: A Life of Robin Hyde, Auckland University Press, p. 207 In 1929 Hyde published her first book of poetry, The Desolate Star. Between 1935 and 1938 she published five novels: Passport to Hell (1936), Check To Your King (1936), Wednesday's Children (1937), Nor the Years Condemn (1938), and The Godwits Fly (1938). A manuscript of her unpublished autobiography was given to Auckland Libraries by Dr Gilbert Tothill.Sharp, Iain (2007). Real gold : treasures of Auckland City Libraries. Auckland University Press. Manuscript of Robin Hyde's unpublished autobiography thumbMemorial plaque dedicated to Robin Hyde in Dunedin, on the Writers' Walk on the Octagon Final years and death In early 1938 she left New Zealand and travelled to Hong Kong, arriving in early February. At the time, much of eastern China was under Japanese occupation, after the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Hyde was meant to travel to Kobe then Vladivostok to take the trans-Siberian railway to Europe. When the connection was delayed she made her way to Japanese-occupied Shanghai, where she met fellow New Zealander Rewi Alley. Various peregrinations through China followed, including Canton and Hankow, the latter of which was the centre of Chinese resistance to Japanese occupation. She moved north to visit the battlefront and was in Hsuchow when Japanese forces took the city on 19 May. Hyde attempted to flee the area by walking along the railway lines and was eventually escorted by Japanese officials to the port city of Tsing Tao where she was handed over to British authorities. Shortly after she resumed her journey to England via sea, arriving in Southampton 18 September 1938. She died by her own hand with an overdose of BenzedrineNew Zealand History - Writer Robin Hyde Dies in London in London in 1939, and was buried in Kensington New Cemetery, Gunnersbury. She was survived by a son, Derek Challis.

In many cases, recombinant human proteins have replaced the original animal-derived version used in medicine. The prefix \\"rh\\" for \\"recombinant human\\" appears less and less in the literature. A much larger number of recombinant proteins is used in the research laboratory. These include both commercially available proteins (for example most of the enzymes used in the molecular biology laboratory), and those that are generated in the course specific research projects. Human recombinants that largely replaced animal or harvested from human types =Medicinal applications= * Human growth hormone (rHGH): Humatrope from Lilly and Serostim from Serono replaced cadaver harvested human growth hormone * human insulin (BHI): Humulin from Lilly and Novolin from Novo Nordisk among others largely replaced bovine and porcine insulin for human therapy. Some prefer to continue using the animal-sourced preparations, as there is some evidence that synthetic insulin varieties are more likely to induce hypoglycemia unawareness. Remaining manufacturers of highly purified animal-sourced insulin include the U.K.'s Wockhardt Ltd. (headquartered in India), Argentina's Laboratorios Beta S.A., and China's Wanbang Biopharma Co. * Follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) as a recombinant gonadotropin preparation replaced Serono's Pergonal which was previously isolated from post-menopausal female urine * Factor VIII: Kogenate from Bayer replaced blood harvested factor VIII =Research applications= * Ribosomal proteins: For the studies of individual ribosomal proteins, the use of proteins that are produced and purified from recombinant sources has largely replaced those that are obtained through isolation. However, isolation is still required for the studies of the whole ribosome. * Lysosomal proteins: Lysosomal proteins are difficult to produce recombinantly due to the number and type of post-translational modifications that they have (e.g. glycosylation). As a result, recombinant lysosomal proteins are usually produced in mammalian cells. Plant cell culture was used to produce FDA aproved glycosilated lysosmal protein-drug, and additional drug candidates. Recent studies have shown that it may be possible to produce recombinant lysosomal proteins with microorganisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recombinant lysosomal proteins are used for both research and medical applications, such as enzyme replacement therapy.

Founded in 1891, the School of Medicine has 1,260 students, 604 of which are pursuing a medical degree with or without a combined Doctor of Philosophy or other advanced degree. It also offers doctorate degrees in biomedical research through the Division of Biology and Biological Sciences. The School has developed large physical therapy (273 students) and occupational therapy (233 students) programs, as well as the Program in Audiology and Communication Sciences (100 students) which includes a Doctor of Audiology (Au.D.) degree and a Master of Science in Deaf Education (M.S.D.E.) degree. There are 1,772 faculty, 1,022 residents, and 765 fellows. The clinical service is provided by Washington University Physicians, a comprehensive medical and surgical practice providing treatment in more than 75 medical specialties. Washington University Physicians are the medical staffs of the two teaching hospitals ‚Äì Barnes- Jewish Hospital and St. Louis Children's Hospital. They also provide inpatient and outpatient care at the St. Louis Veteran's Administration Hospital, hospitals in the BJC HealthCare system and 35 other office locations throughout the greater St Louis region. U.S. News and World Report ranks the college high; the school is currently ranked 6th for research and has been ranked as high as 2nd in 2003 and 2004, It has been listed among the top ten medical schools since rankings were first published in 1987. The school ranks first in the nation in student selectivity. As of 2019, it also receives the third most funding among all medical schools in the US from the National Institue of Health, totalling an amount of $218 million. Globally, the school is ranked as the 20th and 35th best medical program in 2020 by the Times Higher Education‚Äôs World University Rankings for medicine and QS World University Ranking for medicine, respectively. Faculty 18 Nobel laureates have been associated with the School of Medicine. 12 faculty members are fellows of the National Academy of Sciences; 30 belong to the Institute of Medicine. 92 faculty members hold individual career development awards from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 59 faculty members hold career development awards from non-federal agencies. 14 faculty members have MERIT status, a special recognition given by the National Institutes of Health that provides long-term, uninterrupted financial support to investigators. 6 faculty members are Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators.  History  Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the University, establishing a Medical Department. Robert S. Brookings, a University benefactor from its earliest days, devoted much of his work and philanthropy to Washington University and made the improvement of the Medical Department one of his primary objectives. This especially became a cause for concern after an early 1900s Carnegie Foundation report derided the organization and quality of the Medical Department. Following a trend in medical education across the country, research and the creation of new knowledge became a stated objective in a 1906 course catalog for the medical department. For Brookings and the University, incorporating the Medical Department into a separate School of Medicine seemed to be the next logical step. This process began in 1914 when facilities were permanently moved to their current location in St. Louis's Central West End neighborhood in 1914, and was completed in 1918 with the official naming of the School of Medicine. The first female faculty member seems to have been biochemist and physiologist Ethel Ronzoni Bishop, who became an assistant professor in 1923. The Medical School began its escalation from regional renown in the 1940s, a decade when two Nobel Prizes were awarded, in 1944 and 1947, to groups of faculty members. In 1950, a Cancer Research Building was completed, being the first major new building addition to the School of Medicine since its relocation in 1914. More buildings were added in that decade, and in the 1960s the School of Medicine focused on diversifying its student body by graduating its first African-American student and substantially increasing the percentage of graduating students who are female to nearly 50%. In March 2020, Washington University School of Medicine announced the construction of a new $616 million, 11 story, 609,000-square- foot neuroscience research building which will sit at the eastern edge of the Medical Campus in the Cortex Innovation Community. Construction of the building is set to be finished in 2023.  Campus  Barnes-Jewish Hospital, which is affiliated with the Medical School Washington University Medical Center comprises 164 acres (0.5 km¬≤) spread over approximately 17 city blocks, located along the eastern edge of Forest Park within the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis. Barnes-Jewish Hospital and St. Louis Children's Hospital, part of BJC HealthCare, the teaching hospitals affiliated with the School of Medicine, are also located within the medical complex. Many of the buildings are connected via a series of sky bridges and corridors. As of 2008, the School of Medicine occupies over in the entire medical complex. Washington University and BJC HealthCare have taken on many joint venture projects since their original collaboration in the 1910s. The Center for Advanced Medicine, completed in December 2001, is one such collaboration, which houses the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center. At , it is one of the largest single buildings in the Medical Complex. In the expansive Medical Complex are several especially large buildings. Recently completed is the BJC Institutes of Health, of which Washington University's Medical School will occupy several floors. It is the largest building constructed on Washington University's campus. Called the BJC Institute of Health at Washington University, it will house the University's BioMed 21 Research Initiative, five interdisciplinary research centers, laboratories, and additional space for The Genome Center. Prominent buildings, centers, and spaces at the medical campus includes Barnes-Jewish Hospital, the Central Institute for the Deaf, St. Louis Children's Hospital, Rehabilitation Institute of Saint Louis, Siteman Cancer Center, Center for Advanced Medicine, Charles F. Knight Emergency and Trauma Center, and the Eric P. Newman Education Center. The Medical Complex is accessible via the Central West End MetroLink station, which provides transportation to the rest of Washington University's campuses.

He currently drives Maximum Destruction on the Monster Jam circuit. He has won twelve Monster Jam World Finals championships during his career (six in racing, five in freestyle, one in 2-wheel skills challenge).  Career  Tom Meents started out as a mud racer, driving his own vehicle, Shake Me. He had his first wreck when he rolled Shake Me over at a USHRA mud race in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He won the NMRO Open Class championship in 1992. He later teamed up with Paul Shafer to drive Shafer's Mud Patrol vehicle. Tom won the NMRO Class 5 championship in 1993 and 1994 and won the Class 6 championship in 1993. This also led to an opportunity to drive one of Shafer's Monster Patrol monster trucks, which Tom drove to a rapid rise in popularity. Among his accomplishments in this truck was a victory at the USHRA U.S. Truck Fest in 1997. Meents bought the truck and in 1999 was commissioned by PACE Motor Sports (FNA Live Nation, now owned by Feld Motor Sports, a division of Feld Entertainment) to run the Bulldozer monster truck, to help increase the truck's exposure. In his first event with Bulldozer, Meents defeated Dennis Anderson, driver of Grave Digger, on national television, becoming an instant star in the process. Meents would continue driving Bulldozer until December 1999 in Minneapolis, MN. In 2000, Clear Channel (which owned Monster Jam) commissioned Meents to drive a new truck, Goldberg, named and themed after the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) wrestler. Meents was extremely successful in the truck and rose to an even greater level of popularity, despite controversy over the truck's unconventional looks. With Goldberg, Meents won the inaugural Monster Jam World Finals racing championship in 2000, and completed a full sweep of the event in 2001, winning racing and freestyle. This event was notable for the controversial encore, in which Dennis Anderson and Meents attempted to drive over each other's trucks at the end of the freestyle competition. When WCW folded two days after the 2001 World Finals, Meents debuted Team Meents, which was a repaint of Goldberg with a similar design and lettering style. Meents again swept the World Finals in 2002 with this truck. In 2003, the truck got a brand new image with the debut of Maximum Destruction. Meents' popularity has remained high with this truck, with several major stadium event victories, but he has not had the success in the World Finals he had with previous trucks. Despite berths in the first three World Finals since switching to Maximum Destruction, he had only been able to score a co-championship in freestyle with Madusa, driven by Debra Miceli, and El Toro Loco, driven by Lupe Soza, in 2004. Finally, in 2006, Meents broke through and regained the Monster Jam World Freestyle Championship. Meents finally won another racing championship in 2009 at Monster Jam World Finals 10, using the same chassis that won the first championship. He regained this title once more at World Finals 12 in 2011, when he won in the championship race against Jimmy Creten in Bounty Hunter. In 2012 at the Advance Auto Parts Monster Jam World Finals 13, Meents defended his title once again, winning the championship race against Damon Bradshaw in Monster Energy. In 2013, the ten year anniversary of Maximum Destruction's debut, at World Finals 14, The Streak was Ended By Adam Anderson in Grave Digger The Legend in the Semi Finals, Meents won his fifth freestyle title. In 2005 Tom Meents jumped Maximum Destruction over his old house, before destroying the house with the truck.  Hallmarks  Meents has several signature moves in freestyle, including top speed \\"cyclone\\" donuts, \\"side surf\\" two-wheel driving, and roof and wing walks where he stands on the roof or wing (as on Monster Patrol) of the truck while it is still in motion. Another is Meents sticking his left hand out the window while flying through the air. Meents also has a reputation for hitting obstacles at unconventional angles and at higher speeds than other drivers. He is known for going into the crowd after a freestyle run and giving his helmet to a fan holding a Max D related sign. Meents was the first person to attempt the monster truck backflip. He landed a perfect backflip at his shop in Paxton, IL, but the rear king pins broke off. Other than that, it was perfect. When he attempted it in public at the Monster Jam World Finals in 2009, he over-rotated and landed exactly on the tailgate, then rolled over backwards onto the roof. Meents was the first person to ever attempt a double backflip in Monster Jam. Meents practiced the stunt at the shop, and results were never released to the public. Meents attempted it at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey on June 16, 2012, but did one backflip in the air and then cork-screwed, landing on the hood of the truck. He completed the first ever double backflip at World Finals 14 during an encore, celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the Maximum Destruction truck. On May 15, 2015 it was announced that Meents would be attempting a never-before-done front-flip of a Monster Jam truck, which would establish a Guinness World Records title.http://www.virtualpressoffice.com/publicsiteContentFileAccess?fileContentId=2026292&fromOtherPageToDisableHistory;=Y&menuName;=News&sId;=&sInfo;= On June 13, 2015 during Monster Jam Path of Destruction at MetLife Stadium, Meents made history and successfully landed the first front-flip on a monster truck, but just missed establishing a new Guinness World Records title.

He held the world record for the long jump and won gold medals in three Olympic Games for the long jump and triple jump. Early life Prinstein was Jewish and was born in Szczuczyn, in Russian- ruled Poland.Paul Taylor, Jews and the Olympic Games: The Clash Between Sport and Politics, Sussex Academic Press, 2004, , pp. 239-40 His parents, Jacob and Julia Prinstein (born Jankiel Prinsztejn and Judes Rubinsztejn),Szczuczyn Marriage Register 1870 emigrated to New York City in 1883 and soon thereafter moved to Syracuse, New York, where Myer was raised. They had five daughters and four sons; Jacob was a grocer and baker. Myer was the third child. Prinstein was captain of the Syracuse University track team, and graduated with a law degree. World record Prinstein set a long jump world record of 7.235 m (23' 8‚Öû\\") in New York on June 11, 1898. However, the record was soon broken, first by William Newburn of Ireland on June 18, 1898, and then by Alvin Kraenzlein on May 26, 1899. On April 28, 1900, Prinstein set a new record of 7.50 m (24' 7¬º\\") in Philadelphia. Four months later, on August 29, 1900, this record was also broken by Peter O'Connor of Ireland. Olympic Games Prinstein won the silver medal in the long jump at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France, losing to Alvin Kraenzlein after being denied permission by Syracuse officials to compete in the final because it was contested on a Sunday - despite the fact that Prinstein was a Jew, and Kraenzlein, who was a Christian, did compete. The two had had an informal agreement not to compete on Sunday, and when Prinstein learned that Kraenzlein had competed he became angry and, depending on the account, punched Kraenzlein in the face or was restrained from doing so. The following day, he won the gold medal in the hop, step and jump (triple jump), beating 1896 champion James Connolly with a leap of 14.47 meters which simultaneously set the Olympic Record.Meyer Prinstein, USA Track and Field Competing as a member of the Irish American Athletic Club in St. Louis 1904 he won both the long jump (setting a new Olympic record) and the hop, step and jump on the same day, the only athlete ever to win both events in the same games. He also came 5th in both the 60 m and 400 m dash.Matthews (2005), pp. 132‚Äì5 In Athens 1906 he again won the long jump competition, beating the world record holder, Peter O'Connor. The only judge for the competition was Matthew Halpin, who was manager of the American team. O'Connor protested, but was overruled. He continued to protest Halpin's decisions through the remainder of the competition. The distances were not announced until the end of the competition. When they were, Prinstein had won with his very first jump.The King of Spring - The Life and Times of Peter O'Connor. Mark Quinn. Later career Prinstein did not compete in the Olympics after 1906. He practiced law in Jamaica, Queens, and later became a businessman. He died in 1925 at age 46 of a heart ailment at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York.

To the extent that there is a common interest in the old and new holding companies, the spinout ...\\" or starburst, is a type of corporate action where a company \\"splits off\\" a section as a separate business. Characteristics Spin-offs are divisions of companies or organizations that then become independent businesses with assets, employees, intellectual property, technology, or existing products that are taken from the parent company. Shareholders of the parent company receive equivalent shares in the new company in order to compensate for the loss of equity in the original stocks. However, shareholders may then buy and sell stocks from either company independently; this potentially makes investment in the companies more attractive, as potential share purchasers can invest narrowly in the portion of the business they think will have the most growth. In contrast, divestment can also sever one business from another, but the assets are sold off rather than retained under a renamed corporate entity. Many times, the management team of the new company are from the same parent organization. Often, a spin-off offers the opportunity for a division to be backed by the company but not be affected by the parent company's image or history, giving potential to take existing ideas that had been languishing in an old environment and help them grow in a new environment. Spin-offs also allow high-growth divisions, once separated from other low-growth divisions, to command higher valuation multiples. In most cases, the parent company or organization offers support doing one or more of the following: * Investing equity in the new firm * Being the first customer of the spin-off that helps create cash flow * Providing incubation space (desk, chairs, phones, Internet access, etc.) * Providing legal, finance, or technology services All the support from the parent company is provided with the explicit purpose of helping the spin-off grow. =U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission= The United States Securities and Exchange Commission's definition of \\"spin-off\\" is more precise. Spin-offs occur when the equity owners of the parent company receive equity stakes in the newly spun off company. For example, when Agilent Technologies was spun off from Hewlett-Packard in 1999, the stock holders of HP received Agilent stock. A company not considered a spin-off in the SEC's definition (but considered by the SEC as a technology transfer or licensing of technology to the new company) may also be called a spin-off in common usage. =Other definitions= A second definition of a spin-out is a firm formed when an employee or group of employees leaves an existing entity to form an independent start-up firm. The prior employer can be a firm, a university, or another organization. Spin-outs typically operate at arm's length from the previous organizations and have independent sources of financing, products, services, customers, and other assets. In some cases, the spin-out may license technology from the parent or supply the parent with products or services; conversely, they may become competitors. Such spin-outs are important sources of technological diffusion in high-tech industries. Reasons for spin-offs One of the main reasons for what The Economist has dubbed the 2011 \\"starburst revival\\" is that \\"companies seeking buyers for parts of their business are not getting good offers from other firms, or from private equity\\". For example, Foster's Group, an Australian beverage company, was prepared to sell its wine business. However, due to the lack of a decent offer, it decided to spin off the wine business, which is now called Treasury Wine Estates. =Conglomerate discount= According to The Economist, another driving force of the proliferation of spin-offs is what it calls the \\"conglomerate discount\\" ‚Äî that \\"stockmarkets value a diversified group at less than the sum of its parts\\". Examples Some examples of spin-offs (according to the SEC definition): * Guidant was spun off from Eli Lilly and Company in 1994, formed from Lilly's Medical Devices and Diagnostics Division. * Agilent Technologies spun off from Hewlett-Packard in 1999, formed from HP's former test-and-measurement equipment division. * Expedia Group was spun off from Microsoft with its eponymous subsidiary Expedia.com. * Cenovus Energy was spun off from Encana Corporation in 2009. * Ocean Rig UDW Inc was spun off from Dryships Inc in September 2011. * AOL was a Time Warner spin-off; this effectively was a demerger, as AOL had previously merged into Time Warner. * DreamWorks Animation was spun off from DreamWorks Studios in 2004. * News Corporation's publishing operations (and its broadcasting operations in Australia) were spun off as News Corp in 2013. The previous News Corporation's remaining media properties were retained under the name 21st Century Fox. In turn, 21st Century Fox was acquired by The Walt Disney Company in 2019, but most of its broadcast and cable properties were spun-off to the new Fox Corporation while Disney retained the film and television production units. * After being acquired by Sega, Index Corporation's video game operations were re-branded as Atlus, the name of a predecessor company, while its contents and solution businesses were spun off as a new company using the Index Corporation name in 2013. Examples following the second definition of spin-out: * Fairchild Semiconductor was a spin-out of Shockley Transistor; the founders were Shockley's \\"traitorous eight\\" * Intel was in turn a spin-out of Fairchild, as were many firms in the semiconductor industry =Academia= An example of companies created by technology transfer or licensing: * Since 1997, Oxford University's Isis Innovation has helped create more than 70 spin-out companies, and now, on average, every two months a new company is spun out of \\"academic research generated within and owned by the University of Oxford\\". Over ¬£266 million in external investment has been raised by Isis spin-out companies since 2000, and five are currently listed on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market (AIM). =U.S. tax treatment= In the United States, a spin-off may be executed by complying with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 355.

Biography  Born in Coronel Dorrego, Roberto Juarroz published 14 volumes of poetry in all, numbered successively 1 to 14, under the general title \\"Poes√≠a vertical\\", the first appearing in 1958 and the final one posthumously in 1997. A fifteenth volume was edited by his wife, the poet and critic Laura Cerrato, and published after his death. W.S. Merwin published a bilingual selection of Juarroz' poems in 1977 (Kayak Books) which was re-issued in an enlarged edition in 1987 (North Point Press), both volumes entitled Vertical Poetry. In 1992 Mary Crow published her translations of the later work as Vertical Poetry: Recent Poems (White Pine Press), which won a Colorado Book Award. In 2011 Crow's translations of a selection of Juarroz' final poems will appear as Vertical Poetry: Last Poems (White Pine Press). He died in 1995 in Temperley.  Literary style and critical reception  The poetry of Juarroz is spare and sometimes cryptic, with lines such as \\"busco las espaldas de Dios\\" (\\"I seek the back of God\\"). Octavio Paz wrote: \\"Each poem of Roberto Juarroz is a surprising verbal crystallisation: language reduced to a bead of light. A major poet of absolute moments.\\"In Duod√©cima Poes√≠a Vertical, Ediciones Carlos Lohl√©, Buenos Aires, 1991. Original quotes follow.

It consists of ten short parallel streets and is bordered by Duffus Street to the north, Young Street to the south, Isleville Street to the west and Novalea Drive to the east. The neighbourhood was designed by architect Thomas Adams to provide housing for working-class families displaced by the Halifax Explosion in 1917. Architectural design was by George Ross of the Montreal architectural firm of Ross and Macdonald. The neighbourhood draws its name from the special cinderblocks from which the houses were constructed. Most of the dwellings are row-houses in groups of four and six, except for the large, two-storey single- family houses at the eastern end of each street. Some have been converted to sets of flats. All of the streets in the Hydrostone are boulevards except Stanley Place. These boulevards have treed, grassy strips which serve as communal outdoor space for the neighbourhood. This is consistent with the Garden city movement by which Adams was influenced. All streets are also served by back lanes, a feature characteristic of Western Canadian cities, but not usually found in Eastern Canadian communities. It is designated a National Historic Site of Canada. Construction Following the Halifax Explosion, many of the wood-frame buildings collapsed on their coal stoves and furnaces and caught on fire, which was a concern when reconstruction was being planned. To minimize the danger of fire, Adams and Ross proposed the use of non- combustible hydrostone for the reconstruction of this area. Most of the buildings in Hydrostone were built to minimize the dangers of fires, a consequence of the Halifax Explosion. Hydrostone was a concrete block that was finished with crushed rock (granite, in this case) to approximate the appearance of cut-stone construction. The concrete blocks and their faces were amalgamated through a hydraulic pressing process, patented by a Chicago firm. Manufacture of the blocks was done in a plant located in Eastern Passage, Nova Scotia and the finished stones were hauled across Halifax Harbour by barge.Smith, David G. 1981. Reconstruction of the Richmond District. Typed manuscript, research paper, presented to Benevolent Funipendulous Society of Nova Scotia, April, Public Archives of Nova Scotia, Manuscript Group 27, Vol. 9, No. 8, 6 pp. Transporting the stones to the construction site was problematic, due to the steep rise from the harbour. To solve this problem and make the area more easily accessible, two diagonal streets were included in the Richmond district reconstruction plans: Devonshire Street/Avenue and Dartmouth Avenue. The Hydrostone today The neighbourhood has experienced a wave of gentrification, as young professionals and small families move into the area. Today, the Hydrostone has become a gentrified area, sought after by young professionals and small families for its ample green space and proximity to shops and transit. Recently, this newer generation has been buying and renovating the area's homes, pushing up property values and displacing longtime residents. In 2011, the Canadian Institute of Planners named the Hydrostone the Second Greatest Neighbourhood in its inaugural Great Places in Canada contest.http://greatplacesincanada.ca/2011-winners/ References External links * Halifax Explosion website Category:Communities in Halifax, Nova Scotia Category:National Historic Sites in Nova Scotia Category:Historic districts in Canada Category:Ross and Macdonald buildings Category:Public housing in Canada ","title":"The Hydrostone"},{"id":"3016487","text":"Rembert√≥w () is a district of the city of Warsaw, the capital of Poland.

The game consists primarily of collecting gacha toys and battling with them. Upon its initial release the game received mediocre reviews from critics and very little advertising. Due to these circumstances, it was not commercially successful, although it has gained a cult following with numerous high fan reviews. The official Capcom Japan website showcases many pieces of concept art and videos. There is also a toy and manga line in Japan though it is extremely rare. In March 2012, Capcom reprinted copies for the GameCube in Japan 9 years after its original release, which stirred talk of a possible future sequel to come. Gameplay The game focuses primarily on its combat system, which goes as follows: Before each match, GF Commanders must pick Gotcha Borgs to put on a force.Gotcha Force Instruction Booklet pg. 7 Each Gotcha Borg, depending upon its powers and abilities, costs a specific amount of \\"GF Energy\\" in order to place on a force‚Äîin Story Mode, GF Energy increases with each match. In multiplayer, GF Energy is determined by players beforehand. Once Forces are determined, the battle begins. Borgs are placed in an arena, and both Borgs are constantly locked onto each other. If there is more than one enemy, Borgs can switch their lock between enemies, or have the option to lock onto allies (for healing or support). The player must quickly dodge, move, use borg abilities, and use the arena to their advantage in order to evade or block incoming attacks. Borgs often have five attack capabilities that normally consist of close range contextual attacks and three long range attacks, though some Borgs differ. Once a borg is defeated, that does not mean the match is over. Forces are determined by multiple Gotcha Borgs, and once one is defeated, the next Gotcha Borg in the Force will arrive in the arena, picking up where his or her fallen ally left off. Battles continue until a Force simply has no more Gotcha Borgs. There are many different types, or tribes, of Gotcha Borgs. Some types of Gotcha borgs have the ability to make a partner bigger or make an enemy smaller, some borgs can even change the look and abilities of an opponent ‚Äî there are many different strategies to use with a single force, counters to these strategies, and counters to these counters. There are over 200 Gotcha Borgs overall. As you play through, you may also obtain borgs of alternate colours, or even special colours such as silver, gold, shadow, or crystal, each with various effects on the borg's life points though some borgs are significantly harder to obtain than others. Plot The Earth is being attacked by \\"Gotcha Borgs\\" called the Death Force. Luckily, a child named Kou finds a borg called G-Red and forms the Gotcha Force. Allied by his friends, Kou counterattacks and aims to get rid of the menace, known as the Death Force's leader, the Galactic Emperor.Gotcha Force Instruction Booklet pg. 2-3 Reception Gotcha Force received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Reviewers generally praised the game's concept and gameplay, but found the game to lack depth in the long run. Mary Jane Irwin of IGN stated: \\"What really hurts it is that the game never progresses beyond the simple battles. I never felt challenged -- and after playing through the story mode for an hour, I felt like I had seen all there was to see.\\" Irwin, along with other reviewers, also noted the game to be more appealing to children. Alex Navarro of GameSpot believed the game \\"crutches itself far too heavily on brainless, clunky, spastic action that doesn't so much entertain as it bewilders.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one seven, one eight, and two sevens for a total of 29 out of 40.

He moved to Argentina with his parents in 1902. Raised in humble circumstances, Fijman was a highly intelligent child interested in art, music, and literature; he later made a modest living as a French teacher and itinerant violinist until a series of mental breakdowns lead to his permanent (and, according to Fijman, not always unpleasant) residency at the Borda Asylum from 1942 until his death. Fijman was keenly interested in religion and religious visions, part of the reason for his conversion from Judaism to Catholicism in 1930. The poetry of Jacobo Fijman is often metaphysical, and has traces of surrealism. Fijman published three volumes of poems in his life: Molino rojo, Hecho de estampas, and Estrella de la Ma√±ana.

The company was formed in 1947 to continue the coachbuilding activities of W. Alexander & Sons when their bus service operation was nationalised. After several mergers and changes of ownership it now forms part of Alexander Dennis. History In 1913, Walter Alexander founded Alexander's Motor Service to expand upon the Falkirk & District Tramways Company's route into previously unserved Grangemouth. In 1924, believing in the future of the omnibus, Alexander established W. Alexander & Sons Limited, to run them and to manufacture bodywork for its own fleet and for sale to other operators.P.S.V. Circle (1995), p. 5. In 1928, several of the major British railway companies bought into the Scottish Motor Traction Company (SMT). Walter Alexander decided to sell his business to the SMT group in 1929, and through this action, received access to a vast supply of resources and services. Alexander became an in-house supplier of bodywork for the whole of the SMT group, and only a few bodies were built for other customers during this period.P.S.V. Circle (1995), p. 5. Coachbuilding work had initially taken place at the company's main bus garage and works in Brown Street, Camelon, but it outgrew this facility and in 1930 a bus garage in Drip Road, Stirling was converted into a dedicated coachbuilding factory,P.S.V. Circle (1995), p. 5. although a few bodies for Alexander's own fleet did continue to be built at Brown Street in the 1930s and '40s. In 1947, in anticipation of the newly elected Labour Government's nationalisation of the SMT group's bus services, a new company, Walter Alexander & Company (Coachbuilders) Limited was formed in order to keep the coachbuilding business in private hands.P.S.V. Circle (1995), p. 4. Although Alexander remained the largest supplier of bodywork to what became the Scottish Bus Group, the independent company also began to broaden its customer base. The company outgrew the Drip Road premises and in 1958 it relocated to a purpose-built factory at Glasgow Road, Camelon. The coachbuilding business continued to flourish and expansion was rapid. In 1969, the company bought out Potters, a bodybuilder in Northern Ireland, and set up a subsidiary Walter Alexander & Co (Belfast) Limited,Companies House extract company no NI005105 Walter Alexander (Belfast) Limited formerly Walter Alexander & Co (Belfast) Limited and within six years started selling buses to the Far East. In 1981 the company was awarded the Queen's Award for Export. By 1983, the company was the largest supplier of double-deck bus bodies in the world, and a year later it won a British Rail contract to construct 25 Class 143 carriages. In 1987, Walter Alexander became a publicly listed company, having previously been a private firm run by the Alexander family. The ownership of the company subsequently changed several times: In 1990 the family sold the company to Spotlaunch plc but within two years a management buyout occurred and it became a standalone company until 1995, when it was bought by the Mayflower Corporation plc.WA sale is imminent Commercial Motor 18 January 1990WA split for business Commercial Motor 25 January 1990 In 2001, it was incorporated into TransBus International.

Located at the head of navigation for the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, it handles shipping loads through its waterway access to the Arkansas River via the Verdigris River. TPOC offers year round, ice- free barge service with river flow levels controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It encompasses an area of and employs over 4,000 people at over 70 companies in its industrial park. The port ships manufactured goods and agricultural products from Oklahoma to the rest of the world. Designated a foreign trade zone, it is a major economic engine for the region with over 2.7 million tons of cargo shipped through the Port in 2013 alone. History The notion of making Tulsa a port city on the MKARNS evolved during the early 1960s, as the Corps of Engineers was constructing the massive waterway. A delegation of 23 Tulsa business people travelled to Ohio to evaluate the impact of the effects of the Ohio River Valley navigation systems on regional business growth. They concluded that it would stimulate business in Oklahoma, and convinced other Tulsa business leaders to support the concept. The Metropolitan Tulsa Chamber of Commerce appointed Early Cass to chair a committee, thereafter known as the City of Tulsa‚ÄìRogers County Port Authority. The port received its first commercial shipment in January 1971, It was officially opened for business on February 20, 1970 and was formally dedicated by President Richard M. Nixon on June 5, 1971. This port is the largest in Oklahoma. It is also one of the largest, most inland river-ports in the United States. It is located from the Tulsa International Airport, and from downtown Tulsa. It is a fully equipped multi-modal transportation center served by both the BNSF Railroad and the South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad. The port also provides rail switching services with three dedicated Port-owned switch engines. In 1971 (the first full year of operation), the port handled 86,654 tons of cargo. In 2013 (the most recently reported full year), it handled over 2.7 million tons.\\"Shipping and Ports:Tulsa Port of Catoosa.\\" Accessed January 24, 2017.

It operated from 1891 to 1989. It was established on 10 March 1891, and formally opened by Minister for Mines and Agriculture Sydney Smith on 16 March. The college initially operated out of two historic residences in Richmond, \\"Toxana\\" and \\"Andrew Towns House\\", with construction of the campus buildings beginning from 1895. Two central campus precincts, the Quadrangle (the initial teaching area) and Stable Square (the initial base for student practical work), both date from this initial 1890s phase of construction. Stable Square, now the main student recreation and support facilities, was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon; it was completed in 1895, burned down in April 1896, and was then rebuilt. The college was operated by the state Department of Agriculture. Initially offering a two-year full-time residential course in general agriculture, it expanded to three years in 1910, after which time the course became known as the Hawkesbury Diploma in Agriculture. A dairying diploma was also introduced in 1910. The first female students were admitted in 1971, at which time the college began relaxing requirements that students reside on campus. It became a College of Advanced Education from 1 January 1972. It continued to be operated by the Department of Agriculture until 1976, after which time it became autonomous with its own governing council. It operated a separate residential campus at Scheyville, using the former Officer Training Unit, Scheyville buildings, from 1977 to 1983. It was solely residential, with all teaching remaining at the Richmond campus, and the college opted to consolidate all operations there at the conclusion of its five-year lease. Notable faculty included George Lowe Sutton, while notable students included Walter Lawry Waterhouse. In 1985, Premier Neville Wran initiated a Higher Education Board inquiry into higher education in Western Sydney, headed by Ron Parry. The report recommended the amalgamation of the Hawkesbury Agricultural College and the Nepean College of Advanced Education to form a new university. The state government gave effect to the report's recommendations in the University of Western Sydney Act 1988, and the college formally amalgamated into the new University of Western Sydney from 1 January 1989.

He was a Union Army veteran of the American Civil War, served as United States Postmaster General, and later edited The Washington Post. Early life Hatton was born in Cambridge, Ohio on April 28, 1846, a son of Richard Hatton and Sarah (Green) Hatton. He was raised and educated in Cadiz, Ohio and apprenticed to his father, who was a printer and newspaper publisher. Civil War Though he was only 16 years old, in 1862 Hatton enlisted for the American Civil War as a private in Company C, 98th Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment. His unit served primarily with the Army of the Cumberland, and Hatton took part in numerous engagements including the Battle of Atlanta. In 1864, he was commissioned as a first lieutenant and he served with the 184th Ohio Infantry before being mustered out at the end of the war. After the war, Hatton was an original member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. In addition, he was also one of the organizers of the Grand Army of the Republic in Ohio. Early career After the war, Hatton worked in the newspaper business in Mount Pleasant, Iowa and later in Burlington, Iowa. A Republican who was active as a member of the Stalwart faction, he served as Burlington's Postmaster, and held several party positions, including Chairman of the Iowa Republican Party's Central Committee. Political career In 1881, Hatton was a candidate for several federal appointments at the start of the James A. Garfield administration. Garfield died that summer and in October, Hatton was appointed First Assistant Postmaster General during Chester A. Arthur's presidency. In 1884 he was promoted to Postmaster General when incumbent Walter Q. Gresham became Secretary of the Treasury. Hatton worked unsuccessfully to nominate President Arthur for a full term at the 1884 Republican National Convention. The nomination was won by James G. Blaine, who went on to lose the general election to Democrat Grover Cleveland. Hatton left office at the end of Arthur's term and returned to the newspaper business. Later career Hatton was part-owner and editor of The Washington Post until April 24, 1894, when he was stricken with a massive stroke while working at his desk. Hatton experienced complete paralysis, and was transported to a hospital, where his condition continued to decline. Death and burial He died on April 30, 1894, a week after his stroke and two days after his 48th birthday. He was interred in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Family In 1867, Hatton married Elizabeth J. Snyder (1844-1944) of Mount Pleasant Iowa. They were the parents of a son, Richard Hatton (1872-1939).

Note that the picture shows several stages of one and the same spermatozoon - only one penetrates the ovum Illustration depicting ovulation and fertilization. The sperm entering the ovum using acrosomal enzymes to dissolve the gelatinous envelope of the oocyte. Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm, usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell, or fertilized egg, initiating prenatal development. Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century.Garrison, Fielding. An Introduction to the History of Medicine, pages 566-567 (Saunders 1921). The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum. The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation, follows with ovulation, and finishes with fertilization. Various exceptions to this sequence are possible, including artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, external ejaculation without copulation, or copulation shortly after ovulation.Lawyers Guide to Forensic Medicine SBN 978-1-85941-159-9 By Bernard Knight - Page 188 \\"Pregnancy is well known to occur from such external ejaculation ...\\" Upon encountering the secondary oocyte, the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg. The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg's plasma membrane, triggering the sperm head to disconnect from its flagellum as the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb, in vitro.  Anatomy  = Ampulla = Fertilization occurs in the ampulla, the section of the oviduct that curves around the ovary. Capacitated sperm are attracted to progesterone, which is secreted from the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte. Progesterone binds to the CatSper receptor on the sperm membrane and increases intracellular calcium levels, causing hyperactive motility. The sperm will continue to swim towards higher concentrations of progesterone, effectively guiding it to the oocyte. = Corona radiata = The sperm binds through the corona radiata, a layer of follicle cells on the outside of the secondary oocyte. Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell, known as zygote. The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism. = Cone of attraction and perivitelline membrane = Where the spermatozoan is about to pierce, the yolk (ooplasm) is drawn out into a conical elevation, termed the cone of attraction or reception cone. Once the spermatozoon has entered, the peripheral portion of the yolk changes into a membrane, the perivitelline membrane, which prevents the passage of additional spermatozoa. = Sperm preparation = At the beginning of the process, the sperm undergoes a series of changes, as freshly ejaculated sperm is unable or poorly able to fertilize. The sperm must undergo capacitation in the female's reproductive tract over several hours, which increases its motility and destabilizes its membrane, preparing it for the acrosome reaction, the enzymatic penetration of the egg's tough membrane, the zona pellucida, which surrounds the oocyte. = Zona pellucida = After binding to the corona radiata the sperm reaches the zona pellucida, which is an extra- cellular matrix of glycoproteins. A special complementary molecule on the surface of the sperm head binds to a ZP3 glycoprotein in the zona pellucida. This binding triggers the acrosome to burst, releasing enzymes that help the sperm get through the zona pellucida. Some sperm cells consume their acrosome prematurely on the surface of the egg cell, facilitating the penetration by other sperm cells. As a population, sperm cells have on average 50% genome similarity so the premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization by a member of the same cohort. It may be regarded as a mechanism of kin selection. Recent studies have shown that the egg is not passive during this process.Suzanne Wymelenberg, Science and Babies, National Academy Press, page 17Richard E. Jones and Kristin H. Lopez, Human Reproductive Biology, Third Edition, Elsevier, 2006, page 238  Cortical reaction  Once the sperm cells find their way past the zona pellucida, the cortical reaction occurs. Cortical granules inside the secondary oocyte fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell, causing enzymes inside these granules to be expelled by exocytosis to the zona pellucida. This in turn causes the glyco-proteins in the zona pellucida to cross-link with each other ‚Äî i.e. the enzymes cause the ZP2 to hydrolyse into ZP2f ‚Äî making the whole matrix hard and impermeable to sperm. This prevents fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm. The cortical reaction and acrosome reaction are both essential to ensure that only one sperm will fertilize an egg.  Fusion  Fertilization and implantation in humans. After the sperm enters the cytoplasm of the oocyte (also called ovocyte), the tail and the outer coating of the sperm disintegrate and the cortical reaction takes place, preventing other sperm from fertilizing the same egg. The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body. The sperm nucleus then fuses with the ovum, enabling fusion of their genetic material. When the sperm enters the vitelline space, receptors on the sperm head called Izumo1 bind to Juno on the oocyte membrane. Once it‚Äôs bound 2 blocks to polyspermy then occur. After approximately 40 minutes, the other Juno receptors on the oocyte are lost from the membrane, causing it to no longer be fusogenic. Additionally, the cortical reaction will happen which is caused by ovastacin binding and cleaving ZP2 receptors on the zona pellucida. These two blocks of polyspermy are what prevent the zygote from having too much DNA. = Cell membranes = The fusion of cell membranes of the secondary oocyte and sperm takes place. = Transformations = In preparation for the fusion of their genetic material both the oocyte and the sperm undergo transformations as a reaction to the fusion of cell membranes. The oocyte completes its second meiotic division. This results in a mature ovum. The nucleus of the oocyte is called a pronucleus in this process, to distinguish it from the nuclei that are the result of fertilization. The sperm's tail and mitochondria degenerate with the formation of the male pronucleus. This is why all mitochondria in humans are of maternal origin. Still, a considerable amount of RNA from the sperm is delivered to the resulting embryo and likely influences embryo development and the phenotype of the offspring. = Replication = The pronuclei migrate toward the center of the oocyte, rapidly replicating their DNA as they do so to prepare the zygote for its first mitotic division.Marieb, Elaine M. Human Anatomy and Physiology, 5th ed. pp. 1119-1122 (2001). = Mitosis = Usually 23 chromosomes from spermatozoon and 23 chromosomes from egg cell fuse (half of spermatozoons carry X chromosome and the other half Y chromosome). Their membranes dissolve, leaving no barriers between the male and female chromosomes. During this dissolution, a mitotic spindle forms between them. The spindle captures the chromosomes before they disperse in the egg cytoplasm. Upon subsequently undergoing mitosis (which includes pulling of chromatids towards centrioles in anaphase) the cell gathers genetic material from the male and female together. Thus, the first mitosis of the union of sperm and oocyte is the actual fusion of their chromosomes. Each of the two daughter cells resulting from that mitosis has one replica of each chromatid that was replicated in the previous stage. Thus, they are genetically identical.  Fertilization age  Fertilization is the event most commonly used to mark the zero point in descriptions of prenatal development of the embryo or fetus. The resultant age is known as fertilization age, fertilizational age, conceptional age, embryonic age, fetal age or (intrauterine) developmental (IUD) age. Gestational age, in contrast, takes the beginning of the last menstrual period (LMP) as the zero point. By convention, gestational age is calculated by adding 14 days to fertilization age and vice versa. In fact, however, fertilization usually occurs within a day of ovulation, which, in turn, occurs on average 14.6 days after the beginning of the preceding menstruation (LMP). There is also considerable variability in this interval, with a 95% prediction interval of the ovulation of 9 to 20 days after menstruation even for an average woman who has a mean LMP-to-ovulation time of 14.6.Derived from a standard deviation in this interval of 2.6, as given in: In a reference group representing all women, the 95% prediction interval of the LMP-to-ovulation is 8.2 to 20.5 days. The average time to birth has been estimated to be 268 days (38 weeks and two days) from ovulation, with a standard deviation of 10 days or coefficient of variation of 3.7%. Fertilization age is sometimes used postnatally (after birth) as well to estimate various risk factors. For example, it is a better predictor than postnatal age for risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature babies treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.  Diseases  Various disorders can arise from defects in the fertilization process. * Polyspermy results from multiple sperm fertilizing an egg. Polyspermy, while physiologically possible in some species of vertebrates and invertebrates, is a lethal condition for the human zygote.

During the Civil War his father served as assistant surgeon while he enlisted into Company D, 135th Indiana Infantry at the age of 17. At the end of the Civil War his family moved to Illinois. Hale Johnson campaign button He was a lawyer and became mayor of Newton, Illinois. In 1882, Johnson left the Republican Party after supporting every Republican presidential candidate from 1868 to 1880 because it did not support a constitutional amendment for national alcohol prohibition. In 1892, he was elected as the Prohibition Party's national chairman and served in that position until 1896. In 1896, he was the Prohibition Party candidate for governor of Illinois, but later that year he was nominated party's candidate for vice president in the 1896 presidential election and campaigned in over 30 states. He was a narrow gauger who supported a platform with one plank for prohibition unlike the broad gaugers who supported free silver and women's suffrage being added to the platform. During the 1900 presidential election he ran for the Prohibition Party's presidential nomination, but withdrew shortly before balloting and supported John G. Woolley who was able to narrowly defeat Silas C. Swallow for the nomination with 380 delegates to 320 on June 28, 1900. Johnson was shot to death by a farmer, Harry Harris in Bogota, Illinois, in Jasper County, Illinois on November 4, 1902, while trying to collect a debt that Harris had refused to pay even after being ordered to by a court. Johnson was with a local sheriff when he was shot in the face by a shotgun and killed instantly; Harris was grabbed by the sheriff, but not before he swallowed a fatal dose of poison which he died from hours later. Johnson was interred in the Riverside City Cemetery in Newton, Illinois. In 1903, a monument of Johnson was created in Newton with former Prohibition presidential candidate John G. Woolley, former Representative George W. Fithian and national Prohibition chairman Oliver W. Stewart were at the ceremony.

The most easily distinguishable landmark is the United States Coast Guard lighthouse which is visible to mariners on the eastern shore of Bristol Bay and all of Ugashik Bay. The long beaches, shoals, and sandbars of lower Ugashik Bay and the eastern shore of Bristol Bay make navigation through the area particularly troublesome. Shipwrecks, even of smaller vessels, are not unusual. Deaths arising from vessels in distress and from drowning are also commonplace. The combination of extremely rough sea conditions‚Äîsurf arising in Bristol Bay is commonly 1‚Äì5 m (3‚Äì16 ft) high‚Äîand cold water make survival rates extremely low. On a single day in July 2006, to illustrate, two vessels of the Bristol Bay fishing fleet were lost on the shoals of Smoky Point. The crew of the fishing vessels Kaos and Silver Tide were rescued by heroic efforts of the M/V Farwest Leader in extreme weather conditions in the dark.  Demographics Besides the lighthouse, the area also hosts several homes and beach cabins belonging to the salmon gillnet families who fish the nearby waters, dotting the coastline from Dago Creek, approximately east of the lighthouse to Cape Greig, approximately to the north. The area population typically exceeds 30 in summer, dropping to just a single resident in winter.  Flora and fauna  The terrain consists of a series of long ridges which once comprised the ancient coastline of the Bering Sea punctuated by numerous long, narrow lakes and marshland which provide food and shelter for any number of nesting seabirds and annual migrations of the emperor goose, lesser Canada goose, Arctic tern, cormorant, mallard duck, fish duck, and others. The land is also host to the American bald eagle, sandhill crane, willow ptarmigan, barrenground caribou, brown bear, foxes, porcupines, ground squirrels, and wolves, to name but a few. Although treeless, some stands of willow and alder grow in the more protected valleys between the ridges; the region is mostly covered with low shrubbery, mosses, and lichen, which comprise the tundra of the plain. The area is frequently buffeted by strong winds off the Bering Sea which keep the growing season short and cool, and undermines vegetation growing on the unstable sand dune ridges.

He was born with the name Francis Wemyss but on 24 February 1732, he legally changed it to Francis Wemyss Charteris, adopting his mother's maiden name on the inheritance of the estates of his maternal grandfather Colonel Charteris. In a Haddingtonshire Sasine registered on 8 August 1792, No.576, Francis Charteris, Earl of Wemyss was seised in the barony of Newmilns, or Amisfield, Haddingtonshire, plus half of the barony of Morham and its lands, plus the grain mill of the monastery of Haddington called Abbey Mill. His elder brother David, Lord Elcho, was implicated in the Jacobite rising of 1745, and was attainted in 1746.

He is currently a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing Maroubra for the Australian Labor Party since 2005. Daley is aligned with the Labor Right faction. Biography Daley is of Irish Catholic background. He was educated at Marcellin College, Randwick, finishing in 1983. He spent 13 years as a Customs officer with the Australian Customs Service during which time he studied law at night. In 1998 having completed his legal studies he was admitted to the Supreme Court of New South Wales as a legal practitioner and began to pursue a career as a lawyer, and worked for a year in a law firm in central Sydney before spending five years as a senior in-house lawyer with NRMA Motoring and Services. Daley was elected as a councillor to Randwick City Council in 1995 and served as deputy mayor from 2000 to 2004. Personal life Daley married Christina Ithier in 2005 whom he met \\"at a photocopier\\" at his legal firm in 1997. She had two children from a previous marriage that Daley counts as his own. He and Christina have since had two other children, Olivia (12 in January 2019), and Austin (age 8 in January 2019). Political career Daley was elected to represent Maroubra for the Australian Labor Party in 2005 following the retirement from politics of former premier Bob Carr. Daley served on the backbench until the elevation of Nathan Rees as Premier of New South Wales in September 2008 when Daley became the Minister for Roads. Daley held this portfolio until a cabinet reshuffle in September 2009 where he was subsequently appointed Minister for Police and Minister for Finance. When Kristina Keneally became Premier in December 2009 he remained as Minister for Police and Minister for Finance until the 2011 state election. Daley was believed to be a potential candidate for the Labor leadership, however, did not contest it. As a result, John Robertson was elected unopposed as Keneally's replacement, and Daley was appointed as Shadow Treasurer and Shadow Minister for Finance and Services in the Robertson shadow ministry. =Leader of the Opposition= Following Luke Foley's resignation of the role, Daley nominated for the role of New South Wales Labor leader and Leader of the New South Wales Opposition. On 10 November 2018, Daley won the leadership spill against Chris Minns 33 votes to 12 and was elected as the Leader of the Labor Party in New South Wales and became the 38th NSW Leader of the Opposition. On 19 March, a September 2018 video surfaced in which Daley made comments about Asian immigration in Sydney. Daley said \\"Our young children will flee and who are they being replaced with? They are being replaced by young people from typically Asia with PhDs,\\" and \\"So there's a transformation happening in Sydney now where our kids are moving out and foreigners are moving in and taking their jobs\\". Daley apologised from his comments, stating \\"What I was referring to was housing affordability in Sydney ... I could've expressed myself better, no offence was meant.\\" In March 2019 he led his party in the unsuccessful 2019 election. He subsequently stood aside as leader, and withdrew his candidacy for the subsequent leadership ballot after initially stating that he would contest it.

Founded in 1876 as the \\"National Rose Society\\", it was the world's oldest plant society. It was a membership organisation, with members drawn from professional and amateur gardeners and horticultural businesses. Originally based in London, the rose society moved its headquarters to Chiswell Green, near St. Albans, Hertfordshire in 1959, where it created the Royal National Rose Society Gardens. In 1965, the society changed its name to the \\"Royal National Rose Society\\" (RNRS). At the height of its popularity, the RNRS had 100,000 members and its gardens contained 30,000 rose shrubs. The organisation was dissolved in May, 2017 and the gardens were closed permanently. History =The National Rose Society= 'Mrs. Herbert Stevens', 1910 Gold Medal The Royal National Royal Society, originally named \\"The National Rose Society\\", was the inspiration of Rev Dr Reynolds Hole, an Anglican priest, author and horticulturalist. In 1858, he founded the first National Rose Show at St. James's Hall in Picadilly, London. The show was considered a great success with 2000 attendees. By 1860, the popular rose exhibition was being held at the Crystal Palace, with 16,000 rose enthusiasts in attendance. Because of the growing interest in roses by the general public, a meeting of leading rose enthusiasts, including Rev Hole, was held on 9 December 1876, and the \\"National Rose Society\\" was created. Rev Hole was elected the society's first President. The Rev Henry Honeywood D‚ÄôOmbrain was appointed the society's first Secretary. From 1877 to 1902, D'Ombrain edited the society's yearly first publication, The Rosarian's Yearbook. The organisation initially opened an office in central London. Rose exhibitions were the primary focus of the society for its first twenty-five years. It also provided advice to its members with rose related questions, such as finding a specific rose or identifying roses, as well as providing general and specific rose care advice. =The Gold Medal award= The public's growing interest in roses, specifically the new rose cultivars introduced at rose exhibitions, inspired the creation of the society's Gold Medal Award in 1883. Rose breeder and former wheat farmer, Henry Bennett, won the first and second Gold Medals awarded, with Rosa 'Her Majesty' (Hybrid Perpetual) in 1883 and Rosa 'Mrs. John Laing' (Hybrid Perpetual) in 1885. In later years, an important role of the society was to supervise trials of new rose varieties that were submitted to the society's test gardens by rose breeders from around the world. A committee of twenty judges evaluated the rose cultivars periodically throughout the season from June to September over two or three successive years. The Gold Medal was generally awarded each year to two or three roses of exceptional quality. There were several years when no roses would meet the strict guidelines for the award and no gold medal is awarded. =Royal patronage= 'Queen Elizabeth', 1955 Gold Medal In acknowledgement of the Society's important work, Queen Alexandra established the first Royal Patronage in 1888. The society's membership grew steadily from 900 in 1888 to 16,000 in 1926. The annual journal sponsored by the society, The Rose Annual was first published in 1907, and was issued yearly until 1984. In 1925, Queen Mary was appointed Royal Patron of the society. Membership dropped to 11,500 during World War II, but increased to 15,000 by 1947. When Queen Mary died in 1953, the Princess Mary became the society's Royal patron. The society's headquarters was moved from London to its new location at Bone Hill, Chiswell Green, near St. Albans, Hertfordshire in 1959. The society created new rose gardens designed to accommodate the International Rose Trials at the eight acre property. The gardens were named the Royal National Rose Society Gardens. The rose gardens grew to a collection of 30,000 rose bushes and gained an international reputation. The rose society grew quickly to 100,000 members by the 1960s. In 1965, Queen Elizabeth issued a command to add the \\"Royal\\" pretext to the society's title, and the name was changed to the \\"Royal National Rose Society\\" (RNRS). After the death of Princess Mary, the Queen Mother became the RNRS patron and held the position until her death in 2002. =The golden years= 'Peace', 1947 Gold Medal The 1960s and the 1970s were the rose society's best years. In 1968, an International Rose Conference was held by the RNRS in London. A decision was made at the conference to create a coalition of national rose societies. From that meeting, the World Federation of Rose Societies was established. In 1976 The Queen Mother attended the society's centenary reception at St. James's Palace. To celebrate the occasion, ten thousand rose boutonni√®res were distributed to the general public in Trafalgar Square; The Post Office in Britain issued a new commemorative set of rose stamps. In 1978, the traditional Westminster rose exhibition was moved to St. Albans, where it was refashioned into a different, updated rose show. Along with the rose exhibition, the two-day festival included live musical performances, craft fairs and trade stands. The show attracted 25,000 attendees and afterwards, the RNRS rose gardens were known as the Gardens of the Rose. Beginning in the 1990s, the public's interest in roses declined and membership numbers gradually fell, with fewer people attending the Gardens of the Rose. The society's Trustees made the decision to close the gardens and develop a new garden in 2005. The old garden was dismantled and a renovated garden was opened to the public in June, 2007. The new design included 20,000 rose cultivars with new companion plantings. The RNRS continued to struggle financially and finally dissolved the organization in May, 2017. The gardens were permanently closed.

In December 2009, the Springfield School District administration reported that 529 pupils, or 14.7% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 60% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-2011 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 The Springfield School District received a $1,552,295 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-2011. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. =Gifted education= The Springfield School District Administration reported that 142 or 4% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2013, the average teacher salary in Springfield School District was $72,587 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $28,583 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $101,171.

The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In 2005, the total reserve funds held by Pennsylvania public school districts was $1.9 billion.

Tuition Students who live in the Springfield School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Springfield School District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $11,542, High School - $11,018. Springfield School District is funded by a combination of: a local mercantile tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a small amount, generally 10% of its budget from the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the district. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. =State basic education funding= According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Springfield School District receives 14.6% of its annual revenue from the state.

The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District of Allegheny County, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, the district reported that 322 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2009, 2009-10 Some public school districts experienced a reduction in funding due to the loss of federal stimulus funding which ended in 2011. In the 2010-2011 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 4% increase in Basic Education Funding (BEF) for a total of $2,666,242. Among the districts in Delaware County, the highest increase went to Southeast Delco School District which got a 10.34% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest BEF increase (in 2010-2011) went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County, which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. Fifteen (15) Pennsylvania public school districts received a BEF increase of greater than 10%. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even when enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some public school districts at a far greater rate than others. In the 2009-10 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $2,563,660. Among the districts in Delaware County, the highest increase went to Interboro School District which got an 8.57%. Ninety (90) Pennsylvania public school districts received the base 2% increase. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received a 22.31% increase in state basic education funding in 2009. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward G. Rendell and the Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal. The state Basic Education Funding to the Springfield School District in 2008-09 was $2,259,910. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 212 District students received free or reduced- price lunches due to low family income in the 2007‚Äì2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Funding Report by LEA, 2009 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Pennsylvania spent $7,824 Per Pupil in the year 2000. This amount increased up to $12,085 by the year 2008.U.S. Census Bureau., Annual Survey of Local Government Finances., 2000U.S. Census Bureau., 2008 Survey of Local Government Finances ‚Äì School Systems, 2010 All Pennsylvania school districts also receive additional funding from the state through several other funding allocations, including Reimbursement of Charter School Expenditures; Special Education Funding; Secondary Career & Technical Education Subsidy; PA Accountability Grants; and low achieving schools were eligible for Educational Assistance Program Funding. Plus all Pennsylvania school districts receive federal dollars for various programs including: Special Education funding and Title I funding for children from low-income families. In 2010, Pennsylvania spent over $24 billion for public education - local, state and federal dollars combined. Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher skills training; All Day Kindergarten; lower class size in Kindergarten through 3rd grade; literacy and math coaching programs (provides teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction); before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $137,906 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding for teacher training.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Accountability Block Grant report Grantee list 2010, October 2010 Ready to Learn grant Beginning in the 2014-2015 budget, the State funded a new Ready to Learn Grant for public schools. A total of $100 million is allocated through a formula to districts based on the number of students, level of poverty of community as calculated by its market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) and the number of English language learners. Ready to Learn Block Grant funds may be used by the districts for: school safety; Ready by 3 early childhood intervention programs; individualized learning programs; and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs. Springfield School District will receive $50,808 in Ready to Learn Grant dollars in addition to State Basic Education funding, Special Education funding, Accountability Block Grant funding, PreK Counts funding, reimbursement for Social Security payments for employees and other state grants which the district must apply to receive. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The Springfield School District received $407,573 in 2006-07. In 2007-08, the district received $300,000 more. The district did not apply for funding in 2008-2009. Among the public school districts in Delaware County the highest award was given to Upper Darby School District which received $1,508,520. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. =Other grants= The Springfield School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants; PA Science Its Elementary grants (discontinued effective with 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell);Pennsylvania Department of Education, Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Grantees Students in 143 Schools Benefit from Intensive Science Curriculum, July 22, 2008 Education Assistance Grants; 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant; 2013 Safe Schools and Resource Officer grants; 2012 and 2013 Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. =Federal Stimulus grant= The Springfield School District received an extra $787,699 in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Pennsylvania Senate Education Committee, the Governor and the Pennsylvania School Board Association, to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Springfield School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars, in additional federal funding, to improve student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Race To The Top Webinar powerpoint for districts December 2009, December 9, 2009 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2014-2015 were set by the Springfield School Board at 29.9604 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service-related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: # Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and # Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2013-2014 - 29.3000 mills *2012-2013 - 28.7300 mills Pennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012-13, 2012 *2011-2012 - 27.9750 mills. *2010-2011 - 27.2230 mills *2009-2010 - 26.2910 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-2009 - 25.2840 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-2008 - 23.9130 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-2007 - 22.4570 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-2006 - 21.4000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Delaware County residents amounts to about 5.04% of their yearly income. Delaware County ranked 73rd out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2014 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2014, 2014 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Wellness policy Springfield School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The Springfield School District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low-income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Springfield School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Extracurriculars Springfield School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, publicly funded sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). According to Pennsylvania's Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. =Athletics= Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract. When athletic competition exceeds the regular season, additional compensation is paid.Springfield School Board, Springfield School District Teacher Union Contract, 2014 The Springfield Cougars compete in many varsity and Junior varsity sports each participating in the Central League. ;Varsity: ;Boys: *Baseball - AAAA *Basketball- AAAAA *Cross Country - AAA *Football - AAAAA *Golf - AAA *Indoor Track and Field - AAAA *Lacrosse - AAAA *Soccer - AAA *Swimming and Diving - AAA *Tennis - AAA *Track and Field - AAA *Wrestling - AAA ;Girls: *Basketball - AAAA *Cross Country - AAA *Indoor Track and Field - AAAA *Field Hockey - AAA *Lacrosse - AAAA *Soccer (Fall) - AAA *Softball - AAAA *Swimming and Diving - AAA *Girls' Tennis - AAA *Track and Field - AAA *Volleyball - AAA *Cheerleading ;Middle school sports: ;Boys: *Baseball *Basketball *Football *Lacrosse *Soccer *Track and Field *Wrestling ;Girls: *Basketball *Field Hockey *Lacrosse *Soccer *Softball *Track and Field *Volleyball =American football= The Springfield Cougars Football Program which started in 1932 has seen four Central league championships in 1962, 1963, 1989, 1994, 2014, 2016, 2017.

He instigated the murder of Gedaliah, the Babylonian- appointed Jewish governor of Jerusalem.  Seal of Ba‚Äôalis  When the Babylonians conquered Judah in the early 6th century BCE and destroyed Jerusalem, they made Gedaliah, a member of a prominent Jerusalem family, governor of Judah. But he was soon murdered, an event still commemorated in Jewish tradition by an annual fast. The assassin was sent by none other than Ba'alis, King of the Ammonites (Jeremiah 40:13 - 41:2). Ba'alis's seal (shown on the cover of the issue of Biblical Archaeology Review, where this article was first published) is made of brown agate with white bands and is in fact quite tiny (0.5 inches in diameter and 0.2 inches thick). A small hole was drilled through the center of the scarab-shaped seal for the setting. On the seal are three lines of script, each separated by double rules: # [Belonging to] Ba'alis # King of # B[nei Ammo]n As indicated by the brackets, the first and last letters in the first line have been reconstructed, but their reconstruction was easy.#1 Almost all seals begin with a lamed, or l, meaning \\"belonging to.\\" The last letter of the line, also missing, completes the spelling of the name. Much more needs to be reconstructed in the damaged third line. Only traces of the first and last letters are visible: the head of the first letter, bet, and upper edge of the last letter, nun. But this is enough to reconstruct the line as Bnei Ammon‚Äîliterally, the Sons of Ammon, or the Ammonites‚Äîsince the named king, Ba'alis, is known as an Ammonite king. Indeed, in the Biblical passage that mentions Ba'alis (Jeremiah 40:14), he is referred to as the \\"King [of the] Bnei Ammon,\\" the same term that we have reconstructed here based on the first and last letters. The same term appears on a well- known bronze bottle, called a situla, found at Tell Siran in Jordan. (see sidebar)#2 The script on our seal is typically Ammonite. It is a mark of how far our epigraphic knowledge has developed that we can distinguish between the closely related scripts of the Israelites, the Ammonites, the Moabites and the Edomites.#3 The name Ba'alis means \\"Ba'al has saved,\\" or \\"Ba'al is salvation.\\" This is not the first time Ba'alis has appeared in the archaeological record. His name also appears in an inscription excavated at Tel el-'Umeiri in Jordan. This seal impression, made by a high official of the king, reads \\"Milqom, servant of Ba'alis.\\"#4 The iconography of the royal Ba'alis seal is as interesting as its inscription: The center and largest register depicts a winged sphinx wearing an Egyptian-style apron. Although the Egyptian influence is clear and strong, just as it is in Israelite culture (perhaps mediated through Phoenicia), the sphinx here has identifying characteristics particular to Ammonite culture. The sphinx has a tail in the shape of the letter S. It curves upward to the right and then finishes in a loop to the left. An identical sphinx is depicted on another Ammonite seal belonging to one \\"Pado'el\\" (see sidebar).#5 Pado'el's seal does not give his title, but we know from cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia that Pado'el was the name of an Ammonite king.#6 If, as appears likely, this type of sphinx was an Ammonite royal emblem, then the seal of Pado'el probably belonged to the king himself, even though the seal does not identify him as such. Buttressing the suggestion that this is a royal symbol is an Edomite seal impression bearing the name of the Edomite king Qosgabri, which contains a very similar sphinx with an identical tail.#7 Apparently this was a royal emblem in both Edom and Ammon. Biblical Archaeology Review, March/April 1999, Pages 48‚Äì9 Still another Ammonite king appears in a bulla also being published here for the first time (see sidebar), but this Ammonite king is otherwise unknown. This bulla comes from the collection of Shlomo Moussaieff. It is made of black clay and is only a little more than a half inch in diameter. The seal impression on the clay is about a quarter of an inch in diameter. A groove around the seal impression indicates that the seal was set in a metal bezel. On the back of the bulla we can see the impression of the cord that tied the document and the texture of the papyrus roll sealed by the bulla. Around the edge appear fingerprints that could well belong to the king himself. Strangely, for a king, his seal is purely epigraphic; it contains nothing but an inscription (Ammonite seals are usually rich in iconography.) Perhaps the royal emblem was on the back of the seal, in which case it would not appear on the bulla. The inscription is divided into two registers by the common double line and surrounded by a framing border line. The letters are typically Ammonite.#8 Two dots are marked at the end of the second line to fill the empty space. The bulla, like the seal of Ba'alis, was purchased in London from a Jordanian antiquities dealer. The inscription reads: # (lbrk'l) \\"Belonging to Barak'el\\" # hmlk \\"the king\\" The name Barak-el means \\"Blessed of God (El)\\" (\\"El\\" is a generic term for God used in the Hebrew Bible). The same name also appears in the Bible: The father of Job's friend Elihu is named Barak-el (Barachel) (Job 32:2,6). The name was apparently common among the Ammonites; we know of three Ammonites called Barak-el.#9 However, now we know that there was a hitherto unknown king by this name as well. The paleography‚Äîthe shape and form of the letters‚Äîindicates that he ruled sometime in the first half of the 7th century BCE. The list of known Ammonite kings is short, so the discovery of a new one is especially important. Some are mentioned in the Bible. In addition to Ba'alis, the Bible also refers to an Ammonite king named Nahash, who threatened to gouge out the right eyes of the men of Jabesh-Gilead (1 Samuel 11:1-2). Nahash ruled in the tenth century BCE, the time of David. Nahash's son, who succeeded him as king, is identified as Hanun (I Chronicles 9:1-2). A number of other Ammonite kings are known from cuneiform inscriptions. The total, until the appearance of Barak-el, was nine. Now it is ten.

It was founded at Oak Ridge High School in 1987 with the first graduates in 1991. The AST relocated to The Woodlands College Park High School in stages from 2005 to 2007. The first Headmaster in 1991 was Dr. Ron Laugen who was succeeded in 2007 by Dr. Susan Caffery. Math, science, and electives in these areas are taught mainly only to students from the Academy. All other courses are taken with the high school along with students who are not in the magnet program. Candidates are accepted by the Academy of Science and Technology following application, testing, and essay reviewing. Some candidates are interviewed by two faculty members before being accepted. For each class, 65 students are initially accepted, and ten are wait-listed. The size of each class at a given time is between 65 and 77 students. There are approximately 280 students in the Academy, selected from College Park High School, the Woodlands High School and Oak Ridge High School. Additional requirements =Research and Problems= Each AST student is required to complete a Research and Problems project for local credit each year. In the first year, all are required to do science fair. Many students proceed to the Science and Engineering Fair of Houston after district competition at the Sci:// Tech Exposition. The Academy of Science and Technology has a strong record of having students in all grades proceed to the ExxonMobil Texas State Science and Engineering Fair and the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Other options upperclassmen have for fulfilling their Research And Problems requirement include BEST Robotics, FIRST Robotics, Destination Imagination, Engineering Design Competition, Biotechnology Competition, and Envirothon Competition. =Explorations= 14 \\"Exploration credits\\" must be earned by each student for local credit to graduate from the AST. These credits are earned through several means: Job shadowing in a technical, scientific, or medical field; documented and researched exploration trips to places such as Alaska, the Galapagos Islands, The Grand Canyon, Colorado, Peru, and Belize; scientific lectures; short day trips to scientific laboratories or companies; college visits; attending approved lectures on scientific topics; and approved student-proposed explorations that are relevant to scientific fields. =Internship= All students are also required to complete an internship in the technical, medical, or scientific community of at least 80 hours. It is usually done in the area of interest of the student. Students have completed internships at NASA, Memorial Hermann and St. Luke's hospitals, the National Zoo, and many local businesses. The internship is normally done during the summer between the junior and senior years. In order to fulfill the requirement, students must keep a detailed journal of their daily experiences. Fish Camp As a means of being \\"inducted\\" into the Academy, all incoming students are expected to attend a three-day camp. It is held about three weeks prior to the start of each school year and campers consist mainly of incoming freshmen, as well as newly accepted upperclassmen. AST upperclassmen volunteer to serve as counselors to the new students. Various outdoor activities take place in the three days, including a ropes course (high and low elements) and other team building exercises. The purpose of this two-and-a-half-day camp is for new students to meet upperclassmen, to interact with each other, and to promote the four virtues that are pivotal to AST: Teamwork, Responsibility, Integrity, and Perseverance (TRIP). Through writing a report on the experience, incoming freshmen may earn their first 2 \\"Exploration credits\\" towards graduation from AST. Other activities AST students are active in such clubs as Mu Alpha Theta, Interact, Leo Club as well as Literary Club and many other clubs the host school has to offer. In addition, they participate in the host school's activities, including band, choir, drama, chess club, and athletics.

He is the creator, team owner, and former driver of \\"Grave Digger\\" on the USHRA Monster Jam circuit. Anderson is from Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, where he currently resides. Career Dennis started out as a mud bogger with his original truck in 1982. This truck was built using the body of a 1952 Ford pickup truck painted in red primer, and was dubbed Grave Digger after a boast made before a race. The truck was later rebuilt with larger wheels and using a 1951 Ford panel truck painted in silver and blue. At one local show, a scheduled monster truck failed to appear and Anderson, who already had large tractor tires on the truck, offered to crush cars in the absence of the full-size monster truck. The success of the event led Anderson to pursue monster trucks as a career. In 1986, Grave Digger was further modified and first received its distinctive black graveyard paint scheme. In 1987 and 1988 Anderson drove the truck primarily at TNT Motor sports races. In 1988 Anderson beat Bigfoot in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on a show taped for ESPN. Anderson moved to a newly built Grave Digger 2 in 1989, made with a 1950 Chevrolet panel van body. TNT began promoting Grave Digger heavily, especially for races on the Tuff Trax syndicated television series and ESPN's Powertrax. This was helped by Bigfoot running a limited schedule in the 1989 championship as Bigfoot 8 was deemed too advanced for the field. During the same year, construction of Grave Digger 3 had begun. While Dennis drove Grave Digger 2, his brother Leslie drove Grave Digger 1. When TNT became a part of the USHRA in 1991, Anderson began running on the USHRA tour and debuted his first four-link suspension truck, Grave Digger 3. In 1992, after Dennis Anderson was injured, he decided to build a better truck with a similar short wheelbase and a new tube frame, therefore Grave Digger 7 was constructed (numbers 4 and 5 having been franchised to other drivers and number 6 being a street-legal display truck). He drove that truck from 1992 until 1996, and was a regular on the USHRA syndicated series \\"Monster Wars\\". In 1997 he built and debuted Grave Digger 12, which would be inherited by former Carolina Crusher driver Gary Porter in early 2001. In late 1998, due to his financial difficulties, Anderson sold the Grave Digger team to SRO/Pace, then-owners of the USHRA, leading to controversy and accusations of rigged races due to Anderson driving for the same company that runs the events. In 1999 he won his first championship in the USHRA series. In 2001, he drove Mr. Destruction into a wall of cars as a special stunt for a show in the Louisiana Superdome. Anderson won the inaugural Monster Jam World Finals freestyle championship in 2000, and scored a racing championship win at the 2004 World Finals. He won another racing championship at the 2006 World Finals driving Grave Digger 20. Anderson has also won the 2010 World Finals Racing Championship also driving Grave Digger. Anderson was also a co-host on History Channel's Around the World in 80 Ways. His final event as a competitor took place in Tampa, Florida, at Raymond James Stadium on January 14, 2017, as he was injured and forced to miss the rest of the season. During Monster Jam's 2018 Season Kickoff Show on September 18, 2017, Anderson announced his retirement from the sport. He stated he would remain \\"behind the scenes\\" at events, working in the pits with his team. Injuries Anderson has had several injuries over his career. In late 1991 he broke his kneecap when he hit a wall at the Rosemont Horizon in Chicago, forcing him to sit out the 1992 winter season. He recovered and beat Jack Willman Jr. in Taurus at Carter Finley Stadium in Raleigh, North Carolina. Later in 1992, a hard side hit on the wall of Louisville Motor Speedway in Louisville, Kentucky broke several ribs near his backbone and caused recurring problems throughout his career. A nose-dive, AKA the lawn dart, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans in 1999 aggravated the injury and caused Anderson to miss several shows over the next couple of years. He reinjured himself at a Special Events show in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. A broken hand from a non-driving accident in Philadelphia 2003 sat him out for half of the year. A lesser-known injury happened during the summer of 2006 in a non-monster truck accident when Anderson injured his wrist. He also suffered a shoulder injury at the Metrodome in late 2006, in which his son Adam Anderson drove Grave Digger at shows in early 2007 until The Monster Jam World Finals 8. In 2017, Anderson was hospitalized following an accident while attempting a backflip. On March 10, 2017, it was announced on that Anderson would not compete in World Finals 18 due to the previously stated injury. Hallmarks Anderson has often crashed or damaged his truck early in racing rounds due to his driving style. For this reason, he had a nickname of \\"One Run Anderson\\". Back in his early mud bogging days, he was known for running full throttle, flinging mud everywhere. He would either make a mess going through, or break the truck from heavy strain during most events. Coincidentally and fitting enough, his most recent work has brought Anderson 'full circle' ‚Äì back to the mud ‚Äì a custom built monster mud truck called King Sling. The truck, a 1941 Willys truck with custom-cut tractor tires and modern chassis and suspension components, carries twice the horsepower at half the weight of his monster truck Grave Digger. The truck is a favorite exhibition vehicle at mud bogs as it is a combination of monster mud vehicle with the monster mud driver.

In some cases, it is the highest degree that can be awarded in a specific academic or professional track. In other cases, it is a degree that is awarded when a candidate completes a certain amount of coursework but does not go on to doctoral work. Some students enroll in a terminal Master's program with the goal of preparing to enter a PhD program. For certain professions and research grants it means the lowest degree to be considered qualified. An earned academic (or research) doctorate\\"Earned\\" in the sense that the degree is obtained through the completion of a program of study and is not an honorary doctorate. such as a PhD is considered the terminal degree in most academic fields, as well as the most advanced degree possible, advancing the boundaries of human knowledge through research and dissertation defense, in the United States. However, professional doctorates may be considered terminal degrees within the professional degree track, even though they are prerequisites for research degrees (e.g., \\"Doctor\\" of Medicine). The phrase \\"terminal degree\\" is used heavily in the United States, but is used less in other countries. The term is not generally used in the United Kingdom or Canada, for example, and its exact meaning varies somewhat between those areas and disciplines in which the term is used. In some countries there are degrees which are more advanced than the PhD, such as the higher doctorates in the United Kingdom and Russia, and the habilitation degree awarded in Germany and Austria. Not all terminal degrees are doctorates. For example, in professional practice fields there are often terminal master-level degrees, some which are called doctorates e.g., Doctor of Jurisprudence, as well as, MEng (Master of Engineering), MLArch standing for Master Landscape Architect or BEng for Engineers, MB (Bachelor of Medicine - UK). Architecture was a discipline where the M.Arch was considered terminal as a professionally oriented degree, but a Doctor of Architecture (D.Arch) that is recognized by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) establishes the Doctoral level as the highest level of \\"professional degree\\" in Architecture in the United States. For the same discipline of Architecture, the \\"Laurea di Dottore\\" is the terminal degree in Italy. Interior design and Interior Architecture have terminal master-level degrees such as MID, MA, MS Interior design education. Most non-doctoral degrees are not terminal in academic terms, with the exception of the Master of Fine Arts (MFA). The MFA is an academically recognized terminal degree and is given to practitioners in the fine arts and performing arts. The MBA, and the MAT are also considered terminal professional degrees.  Research degrees  In academic fields, the typical terminal degree is that of Doctor of Philosophy, although others also exist. The first phase of the Ph.D. consists of coursework in the student's field of study and requires one to three years to complete. This is often followed by a preliminary or comprehensive examination and/or a series of cumulative examinations, in which the emphasis is on breadth rather than depth of knowledge. Finally, another two to four years is usually required for the composition of a substantial and original contribution to human knowledge embodied in a written dissertation that in the social sciences and humanities is typically 250 to 450 pages in length. Dissertations generally consist of (i) a comprehensive literature review, (ii) an outline of methodology, and (iii) several chapters of scientific, social, historical, philosophical, or literary analysis. Typically, upon completion, the candidate undergoes an oral examination, sometimes public, by his or her supervisory committee with expertise in the given discipline. = Typical professional degrees, professional/clinical doctorates, and research doctorates = * Doctor of Education (EdD) * Educational Specialist (EdS) *Science and Engineering: **Doctor of Computer Science (DSc.Comp, DCS, D.C.Sc.), D.C.Sc.) **Doctor of Engineering (Dr.-Ing./DEng/Dr. Eng./EngD) **Doctor of Science (Sc.D., D.Sc., S.D., or D.S.) *Technology: **Doctor of Information Technology (DIT) **Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS, MLS, MSLS) (Given in the US, by an ALA accredited school or program.) * Religion: ** Doctor of Ministry (DMin) ** Doctor of Theology (ThD or DTh) *Design: ** Master of Art and Design (MAD) ** Master of Architecture (M.Arch) ** Doctor of Architecture (D.Arch) ** Doctor of Design (DDes) ** Master of Design (MDes) ** Master of Landscape Architecture (MLArch and/or MLA) ** Master of City Planning (MPLAN, MCRP, MUP, MCP, MCD or MURP) ** Master of Fine Arts (MFA) ** Master of Graphic Design (MGraph) *Arts: ** Doctor of Arts (DA) ** Doctor of Music (DM or DMus) ** Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA) (Usually awarded to performance majors in the musical arts) ** Doctor of Modern Languages (DML) ** Doctor of Philosophy (PhD or DPhil) ** Doctor of Professional Studies (DPS) ** Master of Fine Arts (MFA) *Management: ** Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) ** Doctor of Management (DMgt or DM) ** Master of Project Management (MPM) ** Doctor of Public Administration (DPA) ** Doctor of Economic Development (DED)http://business.nmsu.edu/academics/graduate-programs/ded/ *Healthcare: ** Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (DAOM) (The PhD might soon replace this degree for easier recognition) ** Doctor of Behavioral Health (DBH) ** Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) ** Doctor of Clinical Nutrition (DCN) ** Doctor of Healthcare Administration (DHA) ** Doctor of Health Science (DHS, DHSc) ** Doctor of Medical Physics (DMP) ** Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia Practice (DNAP) ** Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) ** Doctor of Occupational Therapy (DOT or OTD) ** Doctor of Physical Therapy or Physiotherapy (DPT or DPhysio) ** Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) ** Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) ** Doctor of Public Health (DrPH, DPH) ** Doctor of Science (DSc) ** Doctor of Social Science (DSocSci) ** Doctor of Social Work (DSW) *Law: ** Doctor of Canon Law (JCD) ** Doctor of Juridical Science (JSD/SJD) (in the U.S.) *Social Science: ** Doctor of Criminal Justice The Doctor of Criminal Justice (DCJ) is a professional doctorate (terminal degree) that is awarded on the basis of advanced study and research in the field of criminal justice. Structurally, the Doctor of Criminal Justice differs from the PhD in that the DCJ has, as noted above, at least a three year duration, with only one year equivalent on the dissertation, while an American PhD in criminal justice would normally require a minimum of four years, with at least two years spent on the dissertation. The Doctor of Criminal Justice (DCJ) prepares the holder for research and academic positions. It also prepares the holder for professional positions in the American criminal justice system.  Professional degrees  A professional degree is a degree that is required, often by law as in the case of medical and other clinical professions, that must be earned first before the holder of the degree can practice in the profession. A speech-language pathologist, for example, must hold a master's degree in communicative disorders: speech-language pathology in order to practice. However, an actor does not need a degree to act, even though there are degrees for acting available. In some fields, especially those linked to a profession (such as medicine, law or teaching), a distinction is to be drawn between a professional degree, an advanced degree and terminal degree. A first professional degree is generally required by law or custom to practice the profession without limitation. An advanced professional degree provides further training in a specialized area of the profession. A first professional degree is an academic degree designed to prepare the holder for a particular career or profession, fields in which scholarly research and academic activity are not the profession, but rather the practice of the profession. In many cases such as law, medicine and teaching, the first professional degree is also terminal, usually because no further advanced degree is required for practice in that field, even though more advanced academic degrees may exist. = Typical professional degree = * Business: ** Accountant (MAcc, MAcy, MSAcy) ** Business Administration (MBA)MBA represents a professional designation in the field of Management * Design: ** Architect (B.Arch, M.Arch, D.Arch) ** Architectural Engineer (B.A.E, M.A.E) ** Landscape Architect (BLA, MLA) ** Urban Planning (MPLAN, MCRP, MUP, MCP, MCD, MURP) ** Interior Design, Interior Architecture (BS, BFA, MFA, MID, MA, MS) * Education or a bachelor's usable for teaching (BEd, BA, BME, BSE, BSocSc, BSc) * Engineer (BE, BEng, MEng, BSE, BScEng, BASc)http://ncees.org/about-ncees/news/ncees-approves- revised-approach-education-initiative/ * Healthcare: **Acupuncturist (MAcOM, DAcOM) (Some students pursue both, as the DAcOM is thought to become the new minimum requirement for licensure) ** Advanced Practice Nurse (DNP, DNAP, DNS, DNSc) ** Audiologist (MS, AuD) ** Chiropractor (DC) ** Health Administrator (MHA) ** Mental Health Counselor (MA, MSc, PhD) **Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS, CLS, MT) **Dentist (DMD, BDent, DDS, BDS, BDSc, BChD, CD, Cand.Odont., Dr.Med.Dent.) **Midwife (BMid, BScMid) **Nurse (BSN, MSN) **Occupational Therapist (OTD, DrOT, MSOT, MA, MOT) **Optometrist (OD, B.Optom) **Pharmacist (BPharm, BScPhm, PharmB, MPharm, Pharm.D.) **Physical Therapist (DPT, DPhysio, MPT, MSPT, MPhysio, BSPT, BPT, BPhysio) **Physician or Surgeon (M.D., D.O., MBBS, MDCM, MBChB, BMed, Dr.Med, Dr.MuD, Cand.med). **Physician Assistant (MPAS, MPS, MS, PGDip) **Podiatrist (DPM, DP, PodD, BPod, PodB) **Psychologist (PhD, PsyD, ClinPsyD or EdS) **Public Health (MPH) **Radiation Therapist (BSc, BRad) **Radiographer (BSc, BMRSc, BRad) **Respiratory Therapist (MSRC, BSRT) **Scientist (BSc, BS) **Social Worker (BSW, BA, BSc) **Speech and Language Therapist (MA, MS) **Veterinarian (DVM, VMD, BVS, BVSc, BVMS) * Lawyer (LL.B., J.D.) * Minister (M.Div.) =Advanced professional degrees= * Education (MEd, MAT, MT, EdS) * Engineering (MEng, MASc, MMSc, PD) * Healthcare: ** Acupuncture (DAcOM) (The DAcOM is thought to become the new minimum requirement for licensure.

He received a second M.D. from the Medical College of Virginia in 1904. His studies complete, for two and a half years he served aboard the USS Maryland while it was deployed overseas. In 1907, he was assigned to the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery and appointed Naval surgeon aboard the Mayflower, the presidential yacht of President Theodore Roosevelt. He continued in this role during the entire William Howard Taft administration as well. While attending a dinner party in March 1913, Grayson aided President Woodrow Wilson's injured sister and quickly became a close confidant of the new president, who had grown up in the South.Ferrell, Robert H. Ill-Advised: Presidential Health and Public Trust. Reprint ed. Columbia, Mo.: University of Missouri Press, 1996. In 1915, after the death of Wilson's first wife, Grayson introduced Wilson to Edith Bolling Galt, who became his second wife. Grayson's close personal relationship with Woodrow Wilson led to his commission as a Rear Admiral on August 29, 1916. \\"This rapid promotion of Dr. Grayson from Passed Assistant Surgeon with the rank of Lieutenant to Medical Director to the rank of Rear Admiral was unprecedented and was due to his position as White House Physician.\\"Braisted, William C. and Bell, William Hemphill.

Some historians have strongly criticized Grayson's actions, while others have supported them. \\"While one might excuse Mrs. Wilson's actions on the grounds of wifely loyalty, Grayson's behavior during these days exceeded the bounds of physician responsibility.

This is a horse breeding operation in Upperville, Virginia. Among his successful horses, Fluvanna was voted the retrospective American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly. In the year of his death, Grayson bred the mare On Hand to Kentucky Derby winner Brokers Tip to produce Market Wise. The colt went on to become a multiple stakes winner and the 1943 U.S. Co-champion Handicap Horse. Blue Ridge Farm remains owned by the Grayson family. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Namesake The USS Grayson (DD-435), a Gleaves-class destroyer was named in his honor. Grayson Avenue in Mercerville, New Jersey 08619 is said to be named in his honor, circa 1928.

The film is the story of an alienated teen (Leelee Sobieski) who forms an unlikely friendship with a lonely clothing store manager (Albert Brooks). The film co-stars Carol Kane, Michael McKean, John Goodman, and Desmond Harrington. Plot In an effort to secure employment at the upscale Century City Mall in Los Angeles, Jennifer (Sobieski), a 17-year- old \\"goth-punk\\" girl who just graduated from high school, makes a nuisance of herself at a clothing store run by 49-year-old Randall Harris (Brooks), who eventually hires her on a trial basis as a stockroom clerk. Jennifer refers to herself simply as \\"J\\", and thus asks Randall if it's okay if she calls him \\"R\\", to which he accedes. One day, as there is nothing more to be done in the stockroom, J makes her way to the front of the store and begins to interact with customers. Encouraged by her initiative but concerned that her appearance may frighten away potential customers, Randall buys her an appropriate outfit and promotes her to saleswoman. Feeling isolated from the other people in her life, J finds she is attracted to Randall. After an incident that makes him question whether he can continue to trust her, J demonstrates her trust in him by revealing that she engages in self harm. The two thus strike up an unlikely friendship as they realize that neither has anyone close with whom they can confide. Made aware that J is unhappy living with her mother (who seems to pay more attention to her two pugs than her daughter) and stepfather, Randall offers her an advance on her salary so she can afford her own place, then helps her find an apartment. As their friendship progresses, Randall consents to getting a (very small) tattoo at J's urging, only to realize at the last possible moment that he can't go through with it. In a fit of despair he declares that they can't continue as friends. Confronted by J at his home a short time later, Randall confides his many phobias, which endears him to J even more. Their friendship restored, Randall reluctantly accompanies J to a cemetery to lie on the graves of the deceased to feel their \\"energy\\", something she does regularly. Due to the lateness of the hour, they go back to Randall's where they bond over tea and J spends the night on the couch. The following morning J discovers Randall collapsed in the street after having told her he was going \\"for a run.\\" She learns that Randall has had leukemia for many years and doesn't have long to live, and is initially very angry that he didn't share this with her. While collecting some of Randall's personal items from his home, J discovers the name and address of his ex-wife. Unable to contact her by phone, J drives to Albuquerque only to find her (and Randall's) son Randy, a deeply cynical young man who tells her that his mother died in a car accident six months earlier, and had told him that his father had died before he was born. Although he initially refuses to drive to L.A. to see the father he's never known before he dies, he ultimately does so. Because of J's intervention, Randall and his son have a brief time to get to know one another, for which Randall is very grateful. J's friendship with Randall inspires her to seek a closer relationship with her family, especially her mother. In Randall's final days, Jennifer organizes a dinner at which his son and Jennifer's family come together to celebrate his life.

Similarly, when Sobieski was considered for the part of \\"J\\", she was initially skeptical that \\"such a beautiful face\\" could capture the feeling and look of isolation that was needed for the character, but changed her mind after meeting Sobieski. Lahti expresses deep disappointment that the film was rated R (for language), despairing that it would likely not be seen by many teenagers who would like and relate to the characters. She also laments that the shooting schedule, constrained by the film's budget, didn't give her the opportunity to shoot more \\"coverage\\" (camera perspectives, such as \\"close-ups\\"), and thus more editing choices to convey the emotional content of some scenes. Leelee Sobieski's character, Jennifer, has a number of facial piercings and cartilage piercings in both ears, but does not have her earlobes pierced‚Äîto which a reference is made in the movie. At the time the movie was made, Sobieski herself did not have pierced earlobes, as she did not have them done until 2006. Specially for her part in this movie, she did, however, have both nostrils, both eyebrows and her lower lip pierced, along with her navel and the cartilage of both ears. After filming was completed, she removed the piercings and allowed them to close up again, but kept the jewelry as a souvenir of the movie. Critical reception Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film, writing, \\"These two characters are so particular and sympathetic that the whole movie could simply observe them...The bravest thing about the movie is the way it doesn't cave in to teenage multiplex demographics with another story about dumb adults and cool kids. My First Mister is about reaching out, about seeing the other person, about having something to say and being able to listen. So what if the ending is in autopilot? At least it's a flight worth taking.\\" Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times wrote, \\"Of all the odd couples who inhabit film, surely among the most endearing are Jennifer and Randall, the lost souls and repressed good hearts at the sweet, sentimental center of Christine Lahti's life-affirming My First Mister.\\" See also *Lost in Translation References External links  * My First Mister film info at Leelee Sobieski website Category:American teen drama films Category:American films Category:2001 directorial debut films Category:Films directed by Christine Lahti Category:Paramount Vantage films Category:Midlife crisis films ","title":"My First Mister"},{"id":"3016751","text":"Writ of Attainder for treason passed against his father, John (right). Portrait of Thomas, Lord Erskine, painted by David Allan. Thomas Erskine, Lord Erskine (1705 ‚Äì 16 March 1766) was the son of John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar. He could not inherit the title of Earl of Mar due to the Writ of Attainder for treason passed against his father in 1716 for his role in the First Jacobite Rebellion (1715). Thomas, Lord Erskine, son of John, 6th and 23rd Earl of Mar was initiated in Lodge Kilwinning Scots Arms, Edinburgh, No.3, in 1736. His name is second on the list of registrations in Grand Lodge made by Kilwinning Scots Arms in 1739. This Lodge had large military personnel and is now defunct. Lord Erskine, being under the shadow of his father's attainder, and being denied succession to the title of Earl of Mar, led the quiet life of a country gentleman and had more time to devote himself to the study of Freemasonry. He was elected Grand Master Mason of Scotland in 1749. This undoubtedly led to a quickening of interest in the Craft in Alloa. Thereafter stray names of Alloa men begin to appear in the minutes of the Lodge of Stirling. Within five years a Depute Lodge was regularly meeting in Alloa. On 1 October 1741, he married Charlotte Hope, daughter of the Charles Hope, 1st Earl of Hopetoun. He died without issue.

The theatre is named after brothers George Gershwin, a composer, and Ira Gershwin, a lyricist. It has the largest seating capacity of any Broadway theatre with 1,933 seats, host to large musical productions. The Gershwin has been home to the blockbuster musical Wicked since 2003. History and architecture Designed in an modernist Art Nouveau style by set designer Ralph Alswang, it is situated on the lower levels of a towering office complex built at an estimated cost of $12.5 million on the site of the historical Capitol Theatre. Escalators lead from the street level through-block passageway entrance to the expansive lobby, home to The American Theatre Hall of Fame. With a 65-foot wide adjustable proscenium arch and 80-foot wide stage, it is one of the largest Broadway stages, ideal for very large musical productions. A large orchestra with stadium seating, and mezzanine fill the expansive auditorium. It opened as the Uris Theatre on November 28, 1972 (named for the building developer Uris Buildings Corporation) with the musical Via Galactica starring Raul Julia. It proved to be an inauspicious start for the venue, with the first show to lose a million dollars closing after only seven performances. From 1974 to 1976 it served as a concert hall for limited engagements by a number of legendary pop music and jazz performers, before it began to host large musical productions with Porgy and Bess in 1976. The venue was host to the Tony Awards in 1983, 1984, 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1999. During the 37th Tony Awards ceremony held June 5, 1983, the theatre was rechristened to honor the Gershwins. The Gershwin was heavily modified for the Broadway production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Starlight Express in 1987, a massive production costing over $8 million. Starlight would go on to run nearly 800 performances at the Gershwin. The theatre has been closed as of March 12, 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. It does not plan on opening until January 3, 2021.

It is an elongated, comma-shaped estuary formed where the Ugashik River empties into Bristol Bay, on the western coast of the Alaska Peninsula. Its waters are characteristically turbid and turbulent, the result of muddy feeder streams, frequent winds, and very high tides. Some Bristol Bay tides are thought to rank eighth highest in the world, and Ugashik Bay is greatly influenced by this tidal action. The bay is bordered on the north by a sand beach stretching from Smoky Point on the west to the wide mouth of Dago Creek, on the east by a mud-and-sand shoreline running nearly true north-south past the village of Pilot Point to Muddy Point. The southern shore is a shifting series of mud- and-sand ridges, the northernmost and most prominent of which is called South Spit. The bay influences a marine zone ranging from Cape Greig, north, to Cape Menshikof, to the south. Ugashik Bay's weather is quite variable, especially during winter when storm systems frequently change climatological influences on the area. Storms blowing winds up from the North Pacific can make winter conditions relatively mild, even balmy; whereas winds from the Alaska Interior can bring clear and bitter cold conditions. Westerly winds blowing off the Bering Sea bring high humidity and biting cold, combined with coastal low clouds and fog, even in summer. This is so commonplace that Smoky Point was named from the frequent inclement weather.

It is also known as \\"The Hidden Valley\\".Bain et al. (2006) pp.293, 308 The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"place of adornment near the white [sinter flat]\\" for . History of the region From earliest times the Waikato Valley near Orakei Korako was occupied by MƒÅoriGordon (1888) pp.59‚Äì60 of the NgƒÅti Tahu sub-tribe of Tuwharetoa. By the early 19th century the MƒÅori population had congregated at Orakei Korako, probably attracted by the hot springs, which they used for cooking and bathing. The date when the NgƒÅti Tahu vacated the valley to settle at other locations is not recorded, but it has been suggested that they left after the eruption of Mount Tarawera in 1886, when great changes are alleged to have occurred in the hot springs. By the turn of the 20th century all but two families had moved from Orakei Korako. The earliest known route from Rotorua to Taupo for early European travellers passed right through Orakei Korako, and it was the existing MƒÅori who provided a dugout canoe for the river crossings. It was at this point in the early 20th century that the geothermal area was established as a visitor attraction. To transfer visitors across the then-swift Waikato River they used the dugout canoe, until in the 1930s a wire-strop and pulley system was erected across the river, and a punt with a guiding rudder was used to catch the flow and propel the punt to the other side. The tourist resort was officially opened on 15 December 1937. The first proposal for power development at Orakei Korako was made in 1904, but it was not until 1955 that the scheme was finally approved. By May 1960 an earth- filled dam, rising 49 metres above the original river level, was placed and consolidated. The filling of Lake Ohakuri began on 19 January 1961 and was completed in 14 days. Two of the world's largest geysers were drowned by the lake: Minginui Geyser, which was once observed erupting up to 90 metres high (equal to the world's tallest currently active geyser, Steamboat Geyser in Yellowstone National Park), and the Orakeikorako Geyser, which on occasion could erupt up to 55 metres, and which gave the whole region its name. Orakei Korako today Rainbow Terrace at Orakei Korako A hot pool on the Artist's Palette The lowest terrace at Orakei Korako is the jade-green Emerald Terrace, the largest of its kind in New Zealand since the presumed destruction of the famed Pink and White Terraces in the Mount Tarawera eruption of 1886. However, researchers recently rediscovered the Pink and White Terrace locations. In peak wet conditions up to 20 million litres of silica-enriched water per day may flow over the terrace and into Lake Ohakuri. The Emerald Terrace continues 35 metres under the lake, which was formed for hydropower generation in 1961. This raised the Waikato River level by 18 metres at Orakei Korako, flooding approximately 200 alkaline hot springs and 70 geysers (or two-thirds of the active thermal area). Some of these thermal features still discharge, with their presence evident as gas bubbles rising from the vents in the lake bed. Despite the loss of so many of its thermal features under the artificial lake, Orakei Korako remains the largest geyser field in New Zealand, with up to 35 active geysers. The most famous of these is the Diamond Geyser, whose unpredictable eruptions can last from a few minutes to many hours, ejecting boiling water as high as nine metres. The three terraces above the lakeside Emerald Terrace are great fault scarps formed by an earthquake in 131 AD, around the time when Lake Taupo (a supervolcano) was last erupting. They are mostly covered in hot water algae, or cyanobacteria, which grows in temperatures between 35‚Äì59 degrees Celsius (95-138.2 degree fahrenheit), the colours dependent on the species, with green, yellow and black the most common. At the base of the two lower terraces ‚Äì named Rainbow and Cascade Terraces ‚Äì are several small geysers, including the intermittently active Sapphire Geyser, and the Hochstetter Pool (named after Austrian pioneer geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter, who visited the area in 1859), which erupted in November 1954 and played as a geyser until mid-1955, ceasing suddenly after swarms of subterranean earthquakes. The third and largest great fault scarp in the valley is called the Golden Fleece Terrace (named Te Kapua by the MƒÅori people, meaning \\"The Cloud\\"), which is five metres high and 40 metres long, with a beautiful white crystal-like sinter coating. At the base are numerous vents where geysers have come and gone over the years, with the most recent, Wairiri Geyser. Atop this terrace is the Artist's Palette, a 10,000 m¬≤ silica sinter terrace covered with clear blue alkali chloride pools and irregularly erupting geysers. To one side of this topmost terrace a new geyser began to erupt in 2001, possibly the beginnings of a further terrace. Ruatapu Cave Also at Orakei Korako is the Ruatapu Cave, one of only two caves in the world known to exist in a geothermal field. The cave extends 45 metres, with a vertical drop of 23 metres, to a shallow pool of clear, sulfate-rich, warm acid water. (The pool's chemical composition gives it the unique ability to clean jewellery.) Another notable feature at Orakei Korako is the Soda Fountain, which burst into life in 1984 after a 17-year dormancy. To the south of this feature, high atop a cliff above Lake Ohakuri, are three further geysers, Kurapai, Ellan Vannin and Benedix Washer Geysers, in an area not accessible to the public because it is too dangerous. Temperatures of 100 degrees Celsius (212 degree fahrenheit) have been recorded here just 100 to 150 mm below the ground. Of these geysers, Kurapai Geyser is the most significant, and can sometimes be seen erupting from across the lake in the visitor's centre. The Orakei Korako geothermal system now has some protection from further development, although the nearby Ngatamariki Geothermal Development at Tahorakuri gained resource consent in 2010 despite its possible effects on Orakei Korako.

He made his Major League debut for the Rockies on July 16, 2005 against the Cincinnati Reds and recorded his first hit in that game, a single to right field off of Todd Coffey. That was the only game he played in for the Rockies that year, spending the rest of the year in AAA with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, where he hit .338 in 68 games. He rejoined the Rockies in 2006 and hit his first home run on May 29 off of Jim Brower of the San Diego Padres. He began the 2007 season at Triple-A with the Sky Sox, after being beaten out for a roster spot by veteran Steve Finley. After Finley was released by the Rockies, Spilborghs returned to the team. In 2008, he made the team from spring training, serving as the fourth outfielder. On August 24, 2009, in the 14th inning against the San Francisco Giants with the Rockies down 4‚Äì2, Spilborghs homered off pitcher Merkin Vald√©z for the first walk-off grand slam in Rockies history. This solo Rockies record was held for over 11 years until Charlie Blackmon, also wearing jersey number 19, hit a walk-off grand slam against the Los Angeles Angels on September 11, 2020. On December 12, 2011, Spilborghs was non-tendered by the Rockies and became a free agent. =Cleveland Indians= Spilborghs signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians on January 20, 2012. He also received an invitation to spring training. He failed to make the team and was assigned to the AAA Columbus Clippers, where he hit .250 in 21 games. =Texas Rangers= On May 4, 2012, Spilborghs was traded to the Texas Rangers organization for cash considerations and played for the Triple-A Round Rock Express. In 103 games with Round Rock, he hit .295. =Saitama Seibu Lions= On December 6, 2012 he agreed to a one-year contract with the Saitama Seibu Lions of the Japanese Pacific League. Broadcasting On February 6, 2014, it was announced that Spilborghs had joined the Root Sports Rocky Mountain broadcasting team, where his primary role is sideline reporting during games; however he occasionally provides in booth color commentary. He is an analyst for Rockies pregame and postgame shows, as well as for other programs on the network. Spilborghs currently co-hosts (with CJ Nitkowski) the \\"Loud Outs\\" program that airs Saturdays on SiriusXM's MLB Network Radio. Personal life Spilborghs is of mixed descent, as his father is Belgian, and his mother is Guatemalan. On July 20, 2009, Ryan's wife gave birth to their daughter and first child, Kiera. Her middle name, Esperanza, was chosen after his mother, who died during spring training earlier in the year.

Early life He was born James Boyd at Falkirk on 26 April 1726. James was the eldest son of William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock and Lady Anne Livingston, and from 1728 to 1746, he was known by the courtesy title of Lord Boyd while his father was Earl of Kilmarnock. His mother was only daughter of James Livingston, 5th Earl of Linlithgow, a Jacobite attainted for his role in the 1715 Rising, and Lady Margaret Hay (the second daughter of John Hay, 12th Earl of Erroll). Career During the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion his father sided with the Young Pretender, despite both James and his brother William then holding commissions under George II; James in the army, William in the navy. Remaining loyal to the Hanoverians, James then served at the Battle of Culloden, fighting on the opposite side to his father. During the rout following the Jacobite defeat, the Earl was captured and taken into the government camp, dishevelled and bareheaded, where he was reportedly recognised by James, who placed his own hat upon his father's head. This was the last time they were to meet, as the Earl was then transported to London where he was tried for treason and executed four months later; forfeiting all his lands and titles and thus depriving James of his inheritance. In 1751, however, although the Earldom was abolished, James was permitted to inherit the Kilmarnock estates. These included Dean Castle, the former family seat which had been gutted by a fire in 1735. Trying to recoup some of his father's debts (which he had also inherited), James sold the ruined castle to the 13th Earl of Glencairn. From 1751 to 1752, he served as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. =Later life= On 19 August 1758, he succeeded his maternal great-aunt, Mary Hay, 14th Countess of Erroll as the 15th Earl of Erroll, simultaneously changing his surname from Boyd to Hay, as he and his descendants were henceforth known. Along with the title Earl of Erroll, he also held the ceremonial hereditary office of Lord High Constable of Scotland. Between 1770 and 1774, he served as a Tory Representative Peer in the House of Lords, and from 1770 to 1778, he was Lord of Police for Scotland. Personal life On 15 September 1749, he married Rebecca Lockhart, the daughter of Alexander Lockhart, Lord Covington. Before her death in 1761, they were the parents of one daughter: * Lady Mary Hay (b. 1754), who married Gen. John Scott of Balcomie in 1770, divorced in 1771. In 1762, he married Isabella Carr (1747‚Äì1808), daughter of Sir William Carr of Etal, Northumberland. Together, they were the parents of twelve children, including: * Lady Charlotte Hay (1763‚Äì1800), who married Rev. William Holwell, Vicar of Menheniot, in 1797. * Lady Isabella Anne Hay (1765‚Äì1793) * Lady Augusta Hay (1766‚Äì1822), who married George Boyle, 4th Earl of Glasgow. * George Hay, 16th Earl of Erroll (1767‚Äì1798), who married Elizabeth Jemima Blake, the sister of Joseph Blake, 1st Baron Wallscourt. * Lady Harriet Jane Hay (1768‚Äì1812) * Lady Margaret Hay (1769‚Äì1832), who married Charles Cameron in 1789. * Lady Maria Elizabeth Hay (1771‚Äì1804), who married Rev. George Moore, Rector of Wrotham, eldest son of Most. Rev. John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1795. * William Hay, 17th Earl of Erroll (1772‚Äì1819), who married three times and had eleven children. * Lady Frances Hay (1773‚Äì1806) * Lady Flaminia Hay (1774‚Äì1821), who married Capt.

The Head of the suffrage department for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), she was a key figure in the Prohibition Party and Presbyterian Church, active in both local and national politics, and an advocate of reform laws. Twice she was appointed by the President to represent the United States at the World's Anti-Alcoholic Congress in Europe. Additionally, she was the first woman to run for the Vice President of the United States after the 19th amendment granted women the right to vote.  Early life and family  Brehm was born in Sandusky, Ohio, to William Henry and Elizabeth Rode Brehm as the third of eight children. Her father was a dry goods merchant.US Federal Census. Year: 1870; Census Place: Sandusky Ward 2, Erie, Ohio; Roll: M593_1197; Page: 227A; Family History Library Film: 552696US Federal Census: Year: 1880; Census Place: Sandusky, Erie, Ohio; Roll: 1013; Page: 233B; Enumeration District: 121 Her siblings were Minnie Duennisch-Schaber, Theodore Brehm, Elizabeth C. Forth, William H. Brehm, Frederick Conrad Brehm, John Brehm, and Carrie Brehm. She was reported to be a voracious reader, having read about 300 books from the Sunday school library when she was a child. Brehm's mother, a widow, was reported to have committed suicide by throwing herself into the bay in 1896. Brehm was a lecturer and educator in the public school system of Sandusky, where she also conducted private lessons in languages and civics. In 1883 or 1884, Brehm left her job as a bookkeeper in Sandusky and moved to Olney, Illinois, where she taught art, embroidery, and painting for five years. During this time, she was also a teacher and Superintendent of a Sunday school in the First Presbyterian Church of that city. While teaching at the Claremont School in Olney during the 1887‚Äì88 term, she resided with her uncle, Captain William Rhode and his wife. Rhode was a successful businessman with a thriving hardware store, clothing business, as well as a bustling tavern and resort.  Temperance and suffrage work  Brehm first became involved in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) organization in 1891, during which time she was an organizing member, and made president of the local chapter in April of that year.\\"Shall it be Senator Brehm?\\" The Golden West (October 15, 1920): 16. In September 1891 she served as secretary of a WCTU district convention in Newton, Illinois, where she was elected District President of a ten-county district and greatly increased WCTU membership and engagement over the next four years. Following her district work, Brehm was appointed State Superintendent of the WCTU Institutes, which grew under her direction into one of the most influential branches of the work, with her methodology replicated across the United States. In 1895 Frances Willard, National President of the WCTU, recommended Brehm to be National Superintendent of the Franchise Department at the Baltimore National Convention, a position she held for seven years. The WCTU Franchise Department was charged with all suffrage activities, their goal being, \\"to persuade all the women to want to vote, and to persuade all the men to let them vote.\\" While serving as the National Superintendent, Brehm was involved in a \\"turf war\\" between the National American Woman's Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and the WCTU. In May of 1899, the NAWSA requested, via the WCTU Executive Committee, that the WCTU refrain from involving itself in any suffrage-related legislation, campaign, or action and keep WCTU's activities confined to \\"prohibition and social purity.\\" The letter requesting co-operation was sent by Carrie Chapman Catt, Laura Clay, and Lucy Hobart Day. In addition, Catt appeared at the 26th Convention of the National WCTU (1899) in Seattle, Washington, in order to present NAWSA's position in person. The WCTU rejected these overtures with the explanation, \\"...while earnestly desiring harmony and unity of action, together with mutual co- operation, we cannot sacrifice judgement nor convictions of duty, and must continue to follow out our own plans and methods...\\" Further, at a speech given by Brehm titled \\"Why Woman Wants the Ballot,\\" she stressed the importance of the female vote to achieve prohibition: > \\"What we need in this country is a snow-storm of pure Christian prohibition > ballots, which will make lifeless and powerless the great, organized, > legalized rum system, and the women are asking for the ballot that we may > help you men to bring about a snow-storm which shall accomplish this > purpose.\\" Brehm succeeded Louise S. Rounds as President of the Illinois WCTU, where she served for five terms, from 1901 to 1906. For six years, Brehm served as Special Lecturer of Scientific Temperance of the Board of Temperance and Moral Welfare of The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of the United States. At the National American Convention of 1906 for NAWSA, Brehm represented the WCTU as president of Illinois and presented on \\"Heroes and Heroines\\" as part of Carrie Chapman Catt's program \\"Women in History.\\" Upon retiring from office in the WCTU, Brehm traveled across the United States as a lecturer for the temperance and welfare department of the Presbyterian Church for 25 years. She lectured on the church's behalf not only in the United States, but also in Canada, Ireland, Scotland, England, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. Her travels included representing the Federal Council of Churches at The Hague, Netherlands, in September, 1911, and addressing the World's Sunday School Convention in Zurich, Switzerland, in July 1913. It is reported that she crossed the United States from ocean to ocean twenty-seven times in her career. Additionally, Brehm was a lecturer on the Chautauqua circuit, holding forth on temperance and suffrage, with a specialty in \\"scientific temperance.\\" At a speech Brehm gave in Omaha, Nebraska, she argued that people who abstain from alcohol and maintain their health and physical condition have a better chance at success than those that do not. About six months before she died, Brehm predicted that cigarettes would be the target of a future eradication campaign. She cautioned students at her 1925 presentation in Honolulu, Hawaii, \\"The time will come when you will have to face the tobacco issue just as the world has faced the slavery question and the liquor problem ...\\"  Political career  = Local and national political involvement = Prior to Brehm's vice presidential run, she had an active political life. She was the First Vice President of the 1912 Women's Legislative Council of California conference in San Francisco. The Council was a non-partisan, non-sectarian group which sought to secure better laws for women and children, better public welfare measures, and laws that cater to improved moral, economic, and social conditions. Brehm was appointed by two United States presidents to represent the United States on temperance. In 1909, President William H. Taft appointed her to speak at the World's Anti- Alcoholic Congress in London. In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson appointed her as a delegate to the World Anti-Alcohol Congress in Milan, Italy, where she argued for scientific temperance. Additionally, Brehm spoke before both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and authored a petition urging Congress to create a Department of Education. = 1916 Prohibition Party National Convention = Brehm was approached to run as the Prohibition Party's vice presidential candidate twice before her 1924 nomination, in 1916 and 1920, but declined at those times. At the 1916 Prohibition Party National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota, Brehm proclaimed that the monument of former WCTU president Frances Willard in the National Statuary Hall was a prophecy that some day a woman would be in the Capitol Building, not as a statue, but in power. Although Brehm was considered for the vice president candidacy at the time, she withdrew her name from the nomination, believing Ira Landrith would make a better candidate as he had a strong constituency in the south. Activists Mary Harris Armor and Ella A. Boole were also considered for the vice presidency nomination, and women played a crucial role within the party. More than a hundred women delegates and an equal number of alternates attended the convention and held women's conferences throughout the event. = The National Party = Brehm enjoyed a brief stint as vice chairman of the nascent National Party in 1918, the only woman to hold the position at that time. The party was involved in both temperance and women's suffrage and had equality built into its structure. One man and one woman from every state served on its National Committee. Suffrage was one of the primary tenets of the party platform, stating \\"the National Party regards equal suffrage as the first step toward the attainment of political democracy, and the first plank in our platform demands the submission of the Federal Suffrage Amendment and pledges the party to aid in the ratification campaigns.\\" At the National Party Convention telegrams were sent to President Wilson and United States Senators urging them to pass the Susan B. Anthony suffrage amendment. = 1920 Prohibition Party National Convention = Brehm was the first woman selected as permanent chairman of a national political convention at the 1920 Prohibition Party National Convention in Lincoln, Nebraska. Although she was considered a nominee for both the vice president and presidential candidacies, and was endorsed through the primary elections of Wisconsin, North Dakota, Minnesota and Illinois, she declined once again, choosing to focus on her State Senate run. Instead, she offered a resolution nominating William Jennings Bryan for the presidency. This broke precedent and disrupted the convention program by selecting a candidate on the first day. The resolution was enthusiastically supported, and Bryan was nominated by acclamation. These events followed the Democratic Convention earlier that month, during which James M. Cox was nominated for president and Franklin D. Roosevelt was nominated for vice president. Upon hearing of Bryan's nomination by the Prohibition Party, Cox's aides scrambled to encourage Bryan to decline, fearing potential Cox supporters may favor Bryan instead. Further, it was not yet certain whether Bryan would publicly declare his support for Cox. Democratic strategists acknowledged that if Bryan threatened to accept the Prohibition nomination, it would pressure Cox to declare support of the prohibition platform. Ultimately, however, Bryan declined the nomination, perhaps because after he had lost three times on a major party ticket, he feared losing a fourth time on a minor party ticket. Bryan sent a telegraph to the convention declaring he could not accept the nomination, but the resolution passed anyway. Bryan's brother, Charles W. Bryan, sent a letter to the convention and was invited to appear to explain the refusal. As the convention considered new candidates upon Bryan's refusal, party leaders continued to attempt to persuade him. Ultimately, the nomination went to Aaron S. Watkins for president and D. Leigh Colvin for vice president. = 1920 California State Senate run = In 1920, Brehm was nominated by the Democratic and Prohibition parties to run for California State Senate for the Thirty- third District. The primary tenets of her platform were a complete abolition of alcohol trafficking, and supporting legislation that protected women and children. She ran a \\"spirited\\" campaign against her opponent, the incumbent Richard Rominger, as their race was the only one in which a woman was running. Many Los Angeles women's clubs campaigned for Brehm, eager to have a woman representing them in the State Legislature. As ballots were cast, Rominger maintained a healthy lead. Ultimately, he won the race with 64 percent of the votes. H.P. Faris and Marie C. Brehm campaign button from the 1924 Prohibition Party ticket = 1924 Vice presidential campaign = Brehm was the first female candidate to run for the vice-presidency of the United States after women were allowed to vote in national elections, thus enabling her to vote for herself. Marietta Stow had run for vice-president in 1884 on an all female ticket, but many argue that Brehm was the first to run legally, because of the passage of the 19th amendment in 1920. Brehm ran in 1924 on the ticket of the Prohibition Party running with Herman P. Faris. The vice presidential nominee was initially Dr. A.P. Gouthey, with Brehm in second, and Colonel A.L. Moudy in third. Gouthey withdrew and Brehm was nominated by acclamation. Her running mate, H.P. Faris, praised her abilities during the campaign with several memorable comments: > \\"[Miss Brehm] is the peer of any candidate now running, although she doesn‚Äôt > wear a skull cap or smoke an upside down pipe.\\" \\"Why adopt a dry law then > elect a wet nurse for it?\\"  Personality and interests  Brehm was described as an eloquent and forceful speaker, but also one who lacked a sense of humor. Other contemporaneous reports, however, praised her presentations without complaint and noted her attributes approvingly, \\"Her platform work is forceful and pleasing. Her voice is strong but sympathetic. Her manner is easy, graceful and dignified. Her appearance is striking, her taste in dress exquisite and there is always apparent in look and action the high bred refined Christian woman.\\" Another fan of her work noted that Brehm brought to her work \\"zeal tempered by wisdom, conviction softened by kindness and refinement strengthened by knowledge.\\" \\"With a statesman's grasp of world-wide movements, a commanding finesence (finesse) and splendid voice, Miss Brehm wins her audiences with her first sentence and carries conviction in her arguments\\". She was often counted on to provide music at club meetings and conventions as well as acting as the musical director of the WCTU from 1897 to 1901. True to her belief in maintaining a healthy physical condition, Brehm enjoyed tennis, dancing, swimming, and rowing. She also considered part of her mission to be the imposition of temperance on \\"nonchristian races\\" and \\"uncivilized people\\" around the world. At the 1911 Prohibition Conference in The Hague, the Netherlands, she was a speaker on the same program as the headlining proponent of eugenics and temperance Dr. C.W. Saleeby. At the Cincinnati meeting of the National WCTU, Brehm scolded the crowd for waving their handkerchiefs in the air as an enthusiastic response to favored speakers. Brehm felt the waving of soiled handkerchiefs was surely responsible for the frequency of colds among the conference attendees and admonished the participants to keep their personal handkerchiefs in their pockets and instead wave the small silk flags which had been provided for the express purpose of greeting the speakers.  Later life and death  By 1917, Brehm had moved to Long Beach, California, a town which had been \\"dry\\" for the most part since its founding. While there, she shared her home with two single female boarders, a woman named Mary Kennedy1920 United States Federal Census. Year: 1920; Census Place: Long Beach, Los Angeles, California; Roll: T625_104; Page: 4B; Enumeration District: 85 as well as fellow Sandusky native Jessie Williams and became involved in local issues. She became active in community affairs, with a stint on the Long Beach Planning Commission and on the Board of Directors of the City Club. She also supported the Community Hospital, and was a member of the Board of Deacons of the Second Presbyterian Church. At the age of 66, Brehm died after being injured in the New Year's Day collapse of a Tournament of Roses grandstand in Pasadena, California. Of twelve eventual deaths attributed to the collapse, Brehm was the sixth fatality. While some of the newspapers at the time reported her injuries as \\"minor\\" to \\"torn scalp and sprained left leg,\\" or \\"deep scalp wounds\\" or even a compound fracture of the leg and head injuries, her death certificate listed the cause of death as \\"mitral regurgitation\\" with a contributing factor of \\"shock from accident on Jan. 1, 1926.\\" The accident resulted in a criminal trial with charges brought against the city inspector as well as the builder of the temporary grandstand. Brehm's host for the Rose Parade viewing was Charles Campbell, an old friend who resided in Pasadena and whose family she had visited during a Hawaiian speaking tour the year before. At trial, Campbell related his unease at seeing the flimsy construction for the chosen grandstand and his hesitation on moving forward with tickets for that viewing location. However, he moved forward with the original plan and seating location, despite his \\"premonition\\" and was seriously injured himself (either Campbell exaggerated in court or the initial or later newspaper reports were flawed since he was initially reported with minor injuries treated at home) as well as the eventually fatal injuries to his friend, Brehm. She was cremated in Long Beach and is buried in Oakland Cemetery in Sandusky, Ohio. Although she died on January 21, 1926, her tombstone incorrectly lists 1925 as the year of her death. During the probate process after Brehm's death, it was discovered that the name of one the beneficiaries of her will (Algerian Mission Band) did not match the name as it was written in Brehm's will (the Algerian Mission of North Africa). This caused Brehm's younger sister, Mrs. Elizabeth C. Forth to contest the will and argue that the funds meant for the Algerian Missionaries should instead go to Brehm's surviving siblings. According to contemporaneous reports, Elizabeth Forth also took exception with the distribution of funds to mission work for \\"Mexicans in the Los Angeles Presbytary\\", as well as other contributions to missionary organizations. In the details of the report of the ruling of Division One, District Court of Appeals, it was stated that Brehm's wishes should be respected, despite the fact that she had used the common name of the beneficiary organization rather than its legal name.

His most recent interests have mainly been in quantum information theory, condensed matter, and quantum gravity. In 2003 he received the Computing Anticipatory Systems award for a new interpretation of quantum mechanics based on the similarity of quantum mechanics and Helmholtz machines. He was awarded the E. O. Lawrence Award in 1982 by the United States Department of Energy for leading the team that first demonstrated a working X-ray laser. Work In the field of condensed matter physics Chapline is best known as the originator of the concept of a gossamer metal; i.e. a metal where the density of states at the Fermi surface is depressed because of pairing correlations. Both the actinides and high Tc superconductors are examples of gossamer metals. Chapline is known for his work with Nick S. MantonG. F. Chapline and N. S. Manton, \\"Unification of Yang-Mills theory and supergravity in ten dimensions\\", Phys. Lett. 1208:105 (1983) 105. on finding the classical equations which unify supergravity and Yang‚ÄìMills gauge theories. These equations play an important role in superstring theory. Chapline was also the first person to point out that the anomaly cancellation condition for superstrings in 10 dimensions could be satisfied by E8 x E8, and the first person to suggest that the 24-dimensional Leech lattice might play a central role in a theory unifying gravity and elementary particle physics.G. Chapline, \\"Unification of Gravity and Elementary Particle Interactions in 26 Dimensions\\", Phys. Lett. 158B (1985) 393. Chapline (right) and the world's first X-ray laser Chapline is perhaps best known for his research on black holes, proposing that they \\"do not exist.\\" Drawing upon quantum mechanical insights of himself and Pawel Mazur from the early 1900s, he proposed that objects currently thought to be black holes are actually dark-energy stars. Chapline and Mazur are also responsible for the only known exact result in quantum gravity; namely all rotating space-times can be constructed from an array of quantized spinning strings. This idea incorporates the 1980 proposal by Robert B. Laughlin and Chapline that the surface of a dark energy star actually represents a quantum critical transition of a superfluid vacuum. The Chapline‚ÄìLaughlin theory predicts that space-times with a large vacuum energy are unstable to the formation of dark energy stars; in the context of the early universe, this provides a natural explanation for both dark matter and the metric fluctuations which led to the formation of galaxies. A remarkable astrophysical prediction of the Chapline‚ÄìLaughlin theory is that dark energy stars should be prolific sources of positrons because nucleons decay when they encounter the surface of a dark energy star, which may explain the strong positron annihilation radiation observed coming from the central region of our galaxy.See YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw-og52UUVg . Chapline's interest in quantum gravity dates from the time when as a teenager he wrote Richard Feynman a letter about the problem of quantum propagation in a gravitational field. Because quantum mechanics is intrinsically non-local while the equivalence principle is local there is a tension between quantum mechanics and general relativity that has not yet been resolved. As a result of his letter Feynman invited the 15-year-old Chapline to have lunch at Caltech. Chapline and Feynman talked often about physics in the following years, particularly when he was a graduate student at Caltech (see photo). Feynman reportedly helped Chapline get his first job, as an assistant professor at UC Santa Cruz. Chapline earned a B.A. in mathematics at UCLA in 1961. He was a member of the 1959 UCLA Putnam Competition team which scored 3rd in the nation. He earned a PhD in physics from Caltech in 1967.https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/4895/ See also * Robert B.

Russky Golos was funded by the Comintern and by advertising, commercial newsstand and subscription sales. Its editorial position was closely aligned with the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). Bayer was allegedly part of a Soviet military intelligence (GRU) network. As president of Russky Golos, Bayer got to know John Hazard Reynolds, who provided financial support to a publication entitled Soviet Russia Today, and recommended him to Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) General Secretary Earl Browder. In a July 1943 Venona project decryption sent by the New York GRU Rezident Pavel Mikhailov to Moscow, Bayer is credited with describing a CPUSA source near President Franklin Roosevelt as a woman 'from an aristocratic family, who has known the President and his wife for a long time, evidently a secret member of the CPUSA.'

He was named one of the 100 most important leaders in the field of library and Information science in the 20th century by American Libraries in December 1999, which praised his ‚Äúsubject approach to information‚Äù as ‚Äúone of the most flexible ever conceived.‚Äù Despite these praises, Bliss was ‚Äúmet with apathy and even derision in his efforts‚Äù during his lifetime. His classification system was generally disregarded in favor of other more established classification systems such as the Dewey Decimal System created by Melvil Dewey and the Library of Congress Classification system, causing ‚Äúmore than one author‚Äù to label him as a, ‚Äúprophet without honor.‚Äù Although Bliss was an American, his system was more popular in British libraries than in American libraries. A second edition of the system has been developed in the United Kingdom in 1977. Several volumes have been published. Life Henry Bliss was born in New York City. The son of Henry H. Bliss and Evalina Matilda Davis. He became the deputy librarian of City College of the City University of New York, now known as the City College of New York, in 1891, where he worked until he retired in 1940. Bliss never obtained a degree of higher education yet he was extremely erudite and well learned. He was also a poet and published a collection of poems entitled Better Late Than Never (1937.) He was married in 1901 and had four children with his wife, Ellen deKoster, before she died in 1943. Bliss‚Äô relationship with the American Library Association was strained at best. He resigned from the institution in 1933 saying that he had received ‚Äúso dubious a welcome there‚Äù and was ‚Äútreated like an outsider.‚Äù He rejoined however in 1937. Bliss was generally rather blunt and biting in his criticism of the work of other librarians, and after his wife‚Äôs death, and near the end of his life, Bliss became something of a recluse. Despite this, at Bliss‚Äôs death in 1955 ‚Äúa generous and moving obituary tribute‚Äù was written for him by none other than S.R. Ranganathan. despite the fact that Bliss had criticized Ranganathan by saying that he took him, ‚ÄúLess seriously then some others do, including himself.‚Äù Bliss' Ideas and Bibliographic Classification Bliss is most remembered for his ideas on library classification and the classification system he developed, which he called Bibliographic Classification. The full four volumes of Bibliographic Classification appeared from 1940‚Äì1953 and ‚Äúmarked half a century of sustained effort‚Äù by Bliss. Bliss‚Äôs reasons for developing this system were primarily because of his discontent with the Classification systems that were at use at the time. For example, Bliss says, ‚Äú[that] The International Institute‚Äôs adoption of the Decimal Classification some 35 years ago, [was] for the specious reason that no better system was then available.‚Äù Bliss was emphatic about the fact that ‚Äúgood classification, ‚Äòdignifies the library as an embodiment of knowledge.‚Äô‚Äù The basis behind this system is the idea of a ‚Äúsubject approach to knowledge,‚Äù where books are ordered in a logical systematic way that is ‚Äúintertwined with the organization of knowledge in society.‚Äù Bliss stressed this relationship by saying ‚ÄúOrganizations of Knowledge thus become organizations for thought.‚Äù In an article entitled \\"The System of the Sciences and the Organization of Knowledge\\" written by Bliss in the January issue Philosophy of Science from 1935, he outlines seven major ‚Äúprinciples of classification for organization of knowledge and thought.‚Äù Briefly stated and explained, they are, *Organization - This first principle, while being fairly self-explanatory, Bliss explains by saying ‚ÄúFree thought, like free life, without organization, may rove and rave like Bedlam in a Tower of Babel.‚Äù *Subordination - ‚Äúof the more special classes [or subjects] to the more general,‚Äù for example placing geometry under the more general subject of Mathematics. *Coordination ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe third structural principle, that classes, or sub-classes, of the same order, or grade, may be arranged serially either vertically or horizontally.‚Äù *Extension‚Äì ‚ÄúSerial, branched, and crossed classifications may be combined in structures of three or more extensions.‚Äù *Collocation ‚Äì or rather, arrangement ‚Äúof closely related classes for functional efficiency.‚Äù *Gradation in Speciality ‚Äì Bliss says ‚Äúas the several sciences become more definite in scope, each becomes more or less special in relation to others, and accordingly they may be arranged in a scalar series of gradation in speciality.‚Äù *Maximal Efficiency ‚Äì This is the seventh principle ‚Äúper se.‚Äù and is a result of the first six principles when they are followed. Another of the important features of Bliss‚Äôs work is his ideas on ‚ÄúAlternative Location.‚Äù This simply means that Bliss provided provisions in his system for the possible different shelf locations of certain materials. This can be described as ‚ÄúFor certain topics‚Ä¶ two or more places would be provided and the individual library would select the one most appropriate to its needs.‚Äù One critic described this as, ‚Äúa handsome concession to rival school of thought.‚Äù Reception The reception of Bliss‚Äôs classification system was mixed at best. Bliss said that he received ‚Äúmore discouragement than encouragement from the first.‚Äù Many readers of Bliss‚Äôs work disliked his ideas simply because of the writing style. This was because Bliss‚Äôs writing was usually very complex and wordy. One critic said that Bliss‚Äôs writing was ‚Äúmuch too long. Its exposition is frequently tedious and it has an overplus of trivial observations.‚Äù The reviews weren‚Äôt all bad, though. Susan Grey Akers, in 1936, wrote that Bliss‚Äôs system ‚Äúhas possibilities which are interesting and thought-provoking.‚Äù Grace O. Kelley, writing in 1934 said, ‚Äúa field of investigation is here presented which‚Ä¶ would go far toward lifting librarianship to a plane of scholarship easily ranking with other disciplines which glory in the possession of subject matter which they can call their own‚Äù Legacy and lasting Importance Bliss is often overlooked in the history of Library Science in favor of such giants as Melvil Dewey and S.R. Ranganathan. However, it is important to remember that ‚Äúhis work represents a major step along the way to the modern classification scheme.‚Äù Maltby and Gill in their book The Case for Bliss, writes,‚ÄúIt would be easy to pronounce [Bliss‚Äôs work] as a failure. Nevertheless‚Ä¶ no individual in the history of bibliographical classification has equaled the time spent by Bliss in ascertaining and weighing the needs of learning, in the penetrating analysis of other systems and the slow evolution of his own.‚Äù He was compared to Melvil Dewey by Eugene Garfield: :‚ÄúHis goals and aspirations were different from those of Melvil Dewey, whom he certainty surpassed in intellectual ability, but by whom he was dwarfed in organizational ability and drive. Dewey was a businessman, but he was in no sense as profound in his accomplishments.‚Äù Reprinted in Garfield, E., Essays of an Information Scientist: 1974-1976, Vol. 2., pp. 250-253  Publications  * 1929 The Organization of Knowledge and the System of the Sciences * 1933 The Organization of Knowledge in Libraries  External links  * *Dekker Encyclopedias *A Memorable day with Henry E.

History  left Cleveland was the traditional territory of the Koobenpul clan of the Quandamooka. There are conflicting reports as to the naming of Cleveland; it was either named in 1770 by Captain James Cook in honour of John Clevland, the Secretary of the Admiralty around the time, or by surveyors in the 1840s, in honour of William Vane, 1st Duke of Cleveland. The latter is more likely as Cook did not enter Moreton Bay when he passed by on the 17th of May 1770 and it is not mentioned in his journal. European settlement of Brisbane and surrounding areas was banned from 1824 until 1842, due to the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement, but the area to become Cleveland was first surveyed in 1840, and in 1841, was recommended for a maritime or seaport township. In 1847 a navigation beacon was established at Cleveland Point. In 1847, the Government planned for the new town, and on 13 December 1850, Cleveland was proclaimed a township. The first land sales of the new township took place a year later, with early purchases primarily around Cleveland Point, at the time an early candidate for a major port to replace Brisbane. Brisbane was troubled by sand bars across the mouth of the Brisbane River, and Cleveland Point was closer to the southern passage (the entrance to Moreton Bay between North Stradbroke Island and Moreton Island).alt=However, when Governor Sir George Gipps visited Cleveland in 1842, it is reported that upon disembarking his boat, he immediately sank into the mudflats up to his waist. He was so annoyed by this that he changed his mind and suggested Ipswich. A series of wreckings in the southern passage led to ships using the longer but safer northern entrance between Bribie and Moreton islands. This, and an unfortunate fire at the Cleveland jetty, removed any hopes for Cleveland. In 1852, the first large buildings were built in Cleveland; what is now the Grand View Hotel, and the Old Courthouse, at the time a workers cottage. Farms sprang up; a brickworks was built at the point, and a wool store to handle shipping. The first mail service to Cleveland began in 1861, with the first school established at the same time. The wool store, unused because of Cleveland's failure as a port, was converted into a sawmill, which supplied timber to a shipyard built at the Point. The population at this time was only 270. Tourism blossomed with the arrival of the first regular steamer service to Cleveland in 1864.alt=The Cleveland Point Light was also constructed in 1864, and was only replaced in 1969. From this time, the most popular crop was sugar cane, until it was replaced by the popularity of fruits such as passion fruit and strawberries. A rail line connecting Brisbane to Cleveland was completed in 1889, and with it tourism, residential subdivisions and farming further grew in the area. The area now known as G.J. Walter Park was originally proclaimed a reserve by the Government on 13 March 1889. This area was used mainly by residents and day trippers for swimming, picnicking and general park use. This area is included on the Redland City Council's Register of Heritage Places classified as being of local significance.alt=The rail line continued further than it does today, terminating at Cleveland Point - the existing Cleveland station was constructed later, for passenger use. The Redlands attracted farming families and became a district known for producing top quality fruits and vegetables with crops of strawberries, tomatoes, pineapples, custard apples, citrus fruits, bananas, herbs and vegetables grown very successfully.alt=By the outbreak of World War I, the population in Cleveland had hit 540. However, in 1960, lack of demand ended the rail service to Cleveland, and it was only restored twenty years later, by which time the population of Cleveland was over 5000. The completion of the Leslie Harrison Dam allowed town water to be connected to the shire, with the majority of the town being serviced by 1970. Construction of the Raby Bay canal estate broke ground in 1983, and by 1992, the population of Cleveland was nearing 10,000. The current Cleveland Library opened in 1997.alt=  Geography  Cleveland is located on the western shores of Moreton Bay approximately east-south-east of Brisbane, the capital of the Australian state of Queensland. It comprises commercial, residential and industrial areas and is the location of Redland City's Council Chambers, offices and various cultural facilities.  Toondah Harbour  Mangroves immediately south of Toondah Harbour Toondah Harbour is the location of the Stradbroke Island Ferry Terminal used by water taxis and vehicular ferries to provide access to North Stradbroke Island. This area of Moreton Bay is naturally shallow but the Fison Channel has been dredged to provide access for vehicular ferries which connect Cleveland to Dunwich.Joshua Peter Bell, \\"Moreton Bay And How To Fathom It\\", Queensland Newspapers, 1984, p 52 Toondah Harbour is situated in an area of coastal wetlands featuring sandbanks, mudflats and mangroves which provide important habitats for dugongs, turtles and many shorebird species including migratory birds such as the critically endangered eastern curlew. Most of the wetlands in this area, except for Toondah Harbour and its primary channel, are within the boundaries of the Moreton Bay Ramsar site. Cassim Island, an area of sandbanks and mangroves located to the north of Toondah Harbour, provides the Harbour with shelter from northerly winds. The island is named after William Cassim, an early Cleveland hotel keeper. Cassim Island provides a high value habitat for wading birds and other mangrove fauna.Peter Davie et al, \\"Wild Guide To Moreton Bay\\", Queensland Museum, 1998, p 376 The Queensland Government is proposing extensive development between Toondah Harbour and Cassim Island including an 800 berth marina. On 23 February 2014 approximately 300 people attended a rally to protest against the Government's plans to \\"carve up\\" the G.J. Walter Park as part of its Toondah Harbour redevelopment proposal. A number of Queensland architects and planners reviewed the scheme at an Urban Design Workshop. The workshop Convenor said the group found the current Toondah scheme \\"too large, unfeasible and risky\\". He said the workshop recommended smaller developments across the city linking Raby Bay with Cleveland's CBD and the ferry terminal. On 4 March 2014 a petition with 1,211 signatures calling for the Government's plans to be withdrawn was tabled in the Queensland Parliament. On 19 March the Council decided to ask the Queensland Government to make some changes to the plan which include reducing building heights from 15 storeys to 10 and a 400-berth marina at Toondah Harbour instead of 800 berths. In April 2014, after the consultation period had ended, the Redland City Council released copies of expert reports used to prepare the proposed development scheme. On 31 May 2014 an approved development scheme was released together with a lengthy report on the 583 submissions received during the consultation period.

These include charges that he participated in the 1979-1981 Iran Hostage Crisis, assassinations of Kurdish politicians in Austria, torture, interrogation and executions of political prisoners in the Evin prison in Tehran. Ahmadinejad and his political supporters have denied these allegations. Early student activism According to Iran Focus, soon after attending Elm-o Sanaat University in 1975 to study engineering, Ahmadinejad was caught up in the Islamic Revolution of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmadinejad founded the Islamic Student Association at his university. By 1979, he became a representative of Office for Strengthening of Unity Between Universities and Theological Seminaries, later known as OSU. The OSU was organized by Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti, one of Khomeini's top advisors. Members of the OSU central council, including Ahmadinejad, Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, Mohsen (Mahmoud) Mirdamadi, Mohsen Kadivar, Mohsen Aghajari, and Abbas Abdi, were regularly received by Khomeini himself. The OSU leadership played a key role in the crackdown on dissident university professors and students during the Islamic Cultural Revolution of 1980. Many professors and students who did not support Khomeini were arrested and executed. In voting for storming the US embassy, Ahmadinejad objected, arguing that the protest ought to be directed at the Soviet embassy, but they were outvoted. Ahmadinejad has said that he did not support the embassy takeover until Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini endorsed it. The endorsement came late on November 4, 1979, the day the embassy was seized. According to al-Jazeera, when OSU leaders proposed taking over the US embassy in 1979, Ahmadinejad proposed taking over the Soviet embassy at the same time. Kurdish-Austrian accusations Peter Pilz, an Austrian politician and former spokesman of the Austrian Green Party, has alleged Ahmadinejad possibly had a hand in international assassinations ordered by the Iranian government against political opposition groups, including a 1989 assassination of exiled Kurdish leader Ebdulrehman Qasimlo and two of his associates in Vienna. After Ahmadinejad's election to presidency, in early July 2005, Pilz passed his documents about his claims to the Austrian Interior ministry, which \\"were then forwarded to the state prosecutor's office.\\" This allegation has been denied by several sources in Iran, including Saeed Hajjarian, a political opponent of Ahmadinejad. Also notable among the deniers, is Ali Rabiee, the intelligence advisor to the reformist President Khatami, who stated \\"during the mentioned accident happened, I was present in action regions of northwest and western Iran, and at that time Mr. Ahmadinejad was only involved at the civil construction work in the governing offices of Maku and the province\\". At the same time, the allegation has been echoed by a spokesman for the People's Mujahedin of Iran, an opposition group in exile. Reuters has mentioned that information [Pilz] received from an \\"extraordinarily credible\\" informer, an Iranian journalist living in France who Pilz calls only \\"witness D\\". [...] Witness D's information came from one of the alleged gunmen, who contacted Witness D in 2001 but later drowned, Pilz said. Supporters of Ahmadinejad have questioned the credibility of such information, have mentioned that Pilz is a Jew, and have called the media reporting these to be \\"Zionist media.\\" Hamid Reza Asefi, the spokesman of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said that, \\"The charges are so self-evidently false they are not worthy of response. [‚Ä¶] We advise the Europeans not to fall into the trap of the Zionist media and to separate their interests from America and the Zionist entity (referring to the state of Israel).\\" Alleged election fraud During the Iranian presidential election of 2005, some people, including Mehdi Karroubi, a reformist candidate who ranked third in the election, alleged that a network of mosques, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Basij militia forces, have been illegally used to generate and mobilize support for Ahmadinejad. Karroubi has explicitly alleged that Mojtaba Khamenei, a son of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, is involved. Ahmadinejad's supporters consider these to be false allegations. Furthermore, Khamenei has written to Karroubi stating that his allegations are \\"below his dignity\\" and \\"will result in a crisis\\"; in Iran, which he will not allow. As a reply, Karroubi resigned from all his political posts, including his positions as an adviser to the Supreme Leader and as a member of the Expediency Discernment Council, both of which he had been appointed to directly by Khamenei. Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Ahmadinejad's rival in the second round, has also pointed to what he claims are \\"organized and unjust\\" interventions conducted by \\"guiding\\" the votes, and has supported Karroubi's complaint. Rafsanjani also alleged a \\"dirty tricks\\" campaign had \\"illegally\\" propelled Ahmadinejad into the presidency, an allegation which he strongly denies. In the same statement, Rafsanjani stated that he would only appeal the election results to \\"God\\", and recommended accepting the results and \\"assisting\\" the new president-elect. Some political groups, including the reformist party Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF), allege that Ahmadinejad received illegal support and advertising activities from supervisors selected by the Guardian Council who should have remained nonpartisan according to the election law. Also, the reformist newspaper Shargh pointed out an announcement by Movahhedi Kermani, the official representative of the Supreme Leader in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who was quoted as saying, \\"vote for a person who keeps to the minimum in his advertisements and doesn't lavish,\\" which uniquely pointed to Ahmadinejad, whose supporters touted as being not wealthy. Support for Navvab Safavi On 10 January 2006, Ahmadinejad declared that his government is following the \\"religious mission\\" initiated by Navvab Safavi, a Shi'a cleric who assassinated the historian and author Ahmad Kasravi in 1946 for \\"insulting Islam.\\" In 2001, Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, Ahmadinejad‚Äôs ideological mentor, praised Safavi and encouraged Muslims in taking similar steps against the \\"enemies of Islam.\\" Denial of the Holocaust Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has issued a number of statements claiming The Holocaust as is commonly accepted is \\"a myth\\", and \\"a lie\\" and asks people to educate themselves on both sides of the issue. His words have been publicly repudiated by world leaders from many countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and others, including Iranian academics and expatriates. In a speech given at the Columbia University on Sep, 24, 2007, Ahmadinejad stated that he did not deny the Holocaust, but didn't see what was wrong with asking questions about it. In September 2009, in response to the international outrage, Ahmadinejad was reported to say that the angering of \\"professional man-slayers is a source of pride for us and will not stand in our way.\\" Banning of Western music In December 2005 President Ahmadinejad banned Western and \\"offensive\\" music from state-run radio and television stations. The ban follows a ruling in October by the Supreme Cultural Revolutionary Council to ban Western songs from Iranian airwaves. Popular forms of Western music (hip-hop, rock, jazz) have been banned in Iran for many years, since the days of Khomeini. At the same time, some forms of western music, such as classical music, are regularly aired on state radios. Relations with the foreign press On 16 January 2006, Cable News Network (CNN) was temporarily banned in Iran by the Iranian Ministry of Culture, after misreporting the remarks by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made during a press conference held on 14 January 2006. The president, talking to domestic and foreign reporters, said the peaceful use of nuclear energy is a right which Iran cannot be denied. However, a CNN interpreter incorrectly quoted Ahmadinejad as saying \\"the use of nuclear weapons is Iran's right.\\" CNN later apologised for its mistake. Ahmadinejad allowed CNN to resume broadcasting on 17 January 2006 after the apology. In his letter to the Minister of Culture, he wrote 'We believe that accurate dissemination of news and information is necessary for political growth and awareness as well as effective interaction among nations in today's world. Since the Iranian Revolution, no Iranian reporters have been allowed to enter the United States or take part in a press conference of the U.S. President. Reporters employed by the state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) have only been allowed to cover United Nations events and are only able to travel within a 17-mile (27.4-kilometer) radius of New York City. For this reason several IRIB reporters criticised President Ahmadinejad on his support for CNN. Blocking of major websites A campaign led by Ahmadinejad attempts to free the country of Western cultural influences, via the Internet. Human rights groups, YouTube and b3ta are amongst the major Web sites blocked. Reporters Without Borders called Iran, along with 13 other countries, \\"enemies of the Internet\\" in November 2006. Iran has about 23 million Internet users which is the highest number of web users in the Middle East. The country also has more than 100,000 bloggers, some of which are substitutes for Iran's suppressed, reformist press. Critics accuse Iran of using filtering technology to censor more sites than any country, except the People's Republic of China. Until now, targets have been mainly linked to opposition groups or those deemed \\"immoral\\" under Iran's Islamic legal code. Some news sites, such as the BBC's Persian service, are also blocked. Eschatology Ahmadinejad's religious beliefs in the imminent return of the \\"occulted\\" Shi'a Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi have alarmed some Western commentators. In particular, remarks reportedly made after his speech before the United Nations General Assembly have created concern (translated):(www.ahmadinejad.ir) Former CIA officer Robert Baer said, in the context of evaluating a nuclear strike on Iran, that Ahmadinejad and others in the Iranian government are \\"apocalyptic Shiites.\\" He continues, \\"If you‚Äôre sitting in Tel Aviv and you believe they‚Äôve got nukes and missiles ‚Äî you‚Äôve got to take them out. These guys are nuts and there's no reason to back off.\\" Some have conjectured that his actions are strictly a means of bolstering his standing among devout Muslims, and cannot be interpreted as the existence of an \\"apocalyptic Shiite\\" group. Columbia University On September 24, 2007 Ahmadinejad appeared at Columbia University. President Lee Bollinger received harsh criticism for inviting such a controversial figure to Columbia. He responded in a statement saying \\"The event will be part of the annual World Leaders Forum, the University-wide initiative intended to further Columbia‚Äôs longstanding tradition of serving as a major forum for robust debate, especially on global issues,\\" and also for closing the area to outside protesters. Students protest Ahmadinejad's visit.Columbia University's president, Lee Bollinger, introduced Ahmadinejad with a combative tone: \\"Mr. President you exhibit all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator.\\" Ahmadinejad responded by opening his speech saying that his introduction was \\"an insult to information and knowledge of the audience there.\\" Some of his arguments were met with derisive laughter, for example \\"... in Iran we don't have homosexuals, like in your country. We don't have that in our country. In Iran we do not have this phenomenon. I don't know who told you that we have it.\\" An aide later claimed that he was misrepresented and was saying that \\"compared to American society, we don't have many homosexuals\\". He however was applauded when he spoke about the Palestinian peoples' right to self- determination. He spoke on the issue of the September 11, 2001 attacks that \\"if the root causes of 9/11 are examined properly, why it happened, what caused it, what conditions led to it, who was involved, and put together how to understand and how to prevent the crisis in Iraq, fix the problem in Afghanistan and Iraq combined\\". He also stated \\"the most liberated women in the world are the women in Iran\\". Despite having previously called the Holocaust a \\"myth\\", Ahmadinejad stated \\"granted this happened, what does this have to do with the Palestinian people?\\" He used Koranic quotes to criticize the Bush administration and the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He also described Iran's nuclear ambitions as peaceful measures aimed at increasing Iran's energy production. Outside the convention many protested his presence there, most of them supporters of Jewish organizations .

Early life He first bore arms in the crusade against the Ottomans which culminated in the Battle of Nicopolis. After returning to France, he commanded a force which invaded England in support of Owain Glynd≈µr. His troops burned Plymouth in 1403, but twelve ships of his fleet were lost in a storm while returning to France in 1404. He was an adherent of John the Fearless and foe of the Armagnac party. However, his affairs in France were interrupted by a sojourn abroad. In 1415, the barons of the Kingdom of Naples arranged his marriage to Joanna II of Naples, hoping he would break the power of her court favorites, Pandolfo Alopo and Muzio Sforza, to their advantage. He had Alopo executed and imprisoned Sforza, but he also kept the queen in confinement and aspired to personal rule. The indignant barons captured and imprisoned him in 1416; he was compelled to free Sforza and resign the kingship, and was ejected from the kingdom in 1419. However their marriage does not seem to have been annulled and neither Joanna nor James would ever marry again. Returning to France, he fought against the English for Charles VII of France in 1428 and was made Governor of Languedoc. In 1435, he resigned his titles and became a Franciscan friar, dying in 1438. Marriage In 1406 in Pamplona, he married Beatrix d'√âvreux, daughter of Charles III of Navarre and Eleanor of Castile. The couple had three children: * Isabelle (1408 - after 1445), a nun at Besan√ßon * Marie (1410 - after 1445), a nun at Amiens * Eleanor of Bourbon-La Marche (Burlada, Navarre, 1407 - after 21 August 1464), married Bernard d'Armagnac, Count of Pardiac (d. 1462) In 1415, James married Joanna II of Naples.

The books depict a dystopian future, set in a hypothetical mid 21st century where a new Russian Soviet has invaded Western Europe, causing massive disruption and destruction. Their armies were only repelled by the (unseen) use of tactical nuclear weapons, resulting in a stalemate, somewhat like the middle years of World War I. The New Soviet--more oligarchic than communist--has been stymied. But now Europe is in chaos, the USA is in crisis. To keep order and free up troops for actual fighting, NATO has contracted with the Second Alliance Security Corporation (SA), a right-wing, private security company of mercenaries, an anticipation of Blackwater-style privatization of the military. Second Alliance is part of a hidden (fascist) agenda unbeknownst to most of those who hired them. The heroes of the series are the New Resistance, who are fighting to expose and defeat the SA's racist policies and the neofascist attempt to grab power. The scope of the story is worldwide, but the main action mostly takes place in Europe, on a small Caribbean island and on humanity's first space colony. On the book jacket of the 2012 re-release, William Gibson calls Shirley \\"cyberpunk's patient zero.\\" Bruce Sterling is quoted as calling the trilogy \\"a complex, bizarre, and unique vision of the near future, with a kaleidoscopic mix of politics, pop, and paranoia.\\" An of the trilogy is being released by Dover Books, starting with A Song Called Youth: Eclipse, in October 2017. Characters *\\"Smiling\\" Rick Crandall is the leader of the SA is a charismatic American preacher/televangelist *Steinfeld is the leader of the New Resistance (NR), a former Mossad agent *Jack \\"Smoke\\" Brendon is a former professor, the public face of the NR. He is the first character we meet, disillusioned and living in a bombed out Amsterdam *Dan \\"Hard-Eyes\\" Torrence is the NR's best fighter *Claire Rimpler is the protected daughter of the man who runs the space colony, FirStep Technologies and advances Various technologies and societal changes are employed in this fictional world, and help define it while also anticipating the future through extrapolation and/or speculation. Among these are: * Extraction is a tactic used by both sides in the war. The term is applied to both the process of removing memories from an enemy to find out secrets and the process of implanting other memories that can go as far as altering one's identity and changing one's allegiance. * Orbiting space colony - FirStep has its own gravity and a vulnerable environment that plays a key role in the action of the trilogy. * Removable mind implants - Characters exchange mind implants and otherwise interface with them. These removable implants (like memory chips or USB ports) are controlled or accessed using fingernail taps. This augmentation is viewed with suspicion and is essentially outlawed in the United States, where some key figures are jailed for its use. While this is a common feature in other cyberpunk literature, Shirley's deep exploration of this is notable. * Surreptitious aerial surveillance - Artificial birds that are barely distinguishable from real ones act much like drones that take pictures and otherwise spy and surveil. * Jaegernauts - Large rolling war machines that can destroy entire city blocks, high rises and other large buildings. * Technicki ‚Äì A somewhat subversive language developed by the working class, poorly understood and not well tolerated by others. * Buildings as drugs - As with other cyberpunk literature, intoxication has also changed with advances in technology, chemistry and other factors. In one scene in the second novel, a character ascends higher into a \\"place that is a drug,\\" where atmospheric stimulants ranging from mists to light stimulation deepen his intoxication. \\"Instead of you swallowing the drug, the drug swallows you.\\" Shirley, John.

Biography Viktor Pokrovsky graduated from Pavlovsk army cadet and Sevastopol aviation military schools. He served in the Russian army during First World War as a pilot and was awarded Cross of St. George for bravery. =Russian Civil War= Following the October Bolshevik coup (see Russian Revolution of 1917) he formed an anti-Bolshevik army unit in the Kuban region of southern Russia. Kuban Rada promoted him to the rank of colonel and later to the rank of major general. In March 1918, after heavy fighting with the Red Army, his units were forced to leave Yekaterinodar. After this, on 26 March 1918, Viktor Pokrovsky joined Volunteer Army of general Lavr Kornilov (later led by generals Anton Denikin and Pyotr Wrangel and known also as the Armed Forces of South Russia). General Pokrovsky was in charge of Kuban Cossacks and Caucasus army units of the White Army. Pokrovsky‚Äôs men played a key role in the capture of Tsaritsyn and Kamyshin from the Bolshevik forces in the summer of 1919. Many in the White movement, including military officers, complained about Pokrovsky's penchant to hang prisoners. =Exile= In April 1920, he emigrated from Crimea because general Wrangel did not appoint him to any key positions at his headquarters. In emigration, he settled in Bulgaria and continued anti-Soviet activities. On 9 November 1922 he was killed by the Bulgarian police while resisting arrest in a murder investigation.Svindine, Nicholas & Leonard Mayhew (Trans.) (1973). The Treasure of the White Army.

Occurring annually in late August, the two-day neighborhood festival was first held in 1980, as a way to quell tensions between the neighborhood's long-time Latino residents and the newer gay residents, who some felt were causing the neighborhood to become gentrified. (Los Angeles Business Journal, 2002-12-09) The festival, put on by the Sunset Junction Neighborhood Alliance, closed off a large portion of Sunset Boulevard and features live music, rides, food and merchandise vendors. Over the years, many noted musicians and musical acts performed, including Beck, Elliott Smith, Sleater-Kinney, X, Camper Van Beethoven, Redd Kross, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Eels, Chaka Khan, the Ladies of The Supremes, and Nick Name and the Normals, Jody Watley among others. 2011 festival closure In 2011, the fair was scheduled to take place on August 27 and 28. After booking the talent the promoters failed to secure permits for the fair and it was canceled. In dispute was $260,000 owed to the city for unpaid fees for the previous couple of years. In a last minute ditch effort, the promoters of Sunset Junction were able to secure a $142,000 backing from Live Nation to at least cover this year‚Äôs bills, which would have gone towards cost of police protection, parking enforcement and other city services. The $142,000 did not include any part of the $260,000 that is due for previous years. Despite this, the permits were still denied by members of the Board of Public Works. In the previous year, the city issued a permit for the event even though the estimated fees for police, sanitation and traffic crews were not paid in advance. Following the festival, the city sent organizers three invoices for $256,484. The unpaid bill was eventually forwarded to the Office of Finance, which turned it over to a collection agency, and ultimately the matter was referred to the city attorney‚Äôs office. According to the Los Angeles Times, ‚ÄúIt was the most aggressive stand yet in the city's effort to get tough on the people and organizations who owe money to cash-strapped City Hall.‚Äù One of the reasons for the denial of the permits was that the festival's original reason for charging admission was that the proceeds would be reinvested in the community. However, several community advocates claimed that said proceeds were, in fact, not being reinvested, and that the committee handling the festival were unwilling to submit themselves to public scrutiny of their finances. To date, neither the vendors nor ticketholders have been reimbursed. The fair's official ticket vendor, Flavorus, has suggested that ticketholders contact their credit card providers to dispute the ticket purchases, and that they themselves are unable to provide refunds as they have not been paid either. It was the first time in the street fair's thirty-year history that it had been cancelled. In February 2012, the Sunset Junction Neighborhood Alliance filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, citing $900,000 in debts and only $500 in assets. Alliance president Michael McKinley is also listed among the creditors owed money. According to the official filing, he claims that he is owed $25,000. The City of Los Angeles is listed as the most prominent creditor, at $250,000.

It is the largest enclosed mall in the state of Alaska, though the open-air Tikahtnu Commons in NE Anchorage has a greater GLA. The mall is anchored by Best Buy, Dave & Buster's and a 9-screen Regal Cinemas theater. In total the Dimond Center contains over 200 stores, restaurants and services, including a six-story office tower at the mall's southeast corner. The lower level in the office tower also contains a small food court, a bowling alley, and a health club, all arrayed around an ice skating rink. The office tower is home to the Anchorage branch of iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel Radio), including the studios of radio stations KASH, KBFX, KENI, KGOT, KTZN and KYMG. History The section line road leading south from Anchorage to the rural settlements of Rabbit Creek and Potter became the Seward Highway in the early 1950s and the Old Seward Highway about 20 years later with the construction of a 4-lane freeway slightly to the east. The Old Seward Highway formed the backbone of what became south Anchorage, both in terms of access to residential subdivisions and homesteads, as well as businesses which catered to both nearby residents and highway travelers. As south Anchorage began to grow, the intersections of the Old Seward Highway with Dowling Road and with O'Malley Road originally began to develop as commercial hubs for the area. This changed after Larry Carr and Barney Gottstein acquired and subsequently developed large amounts of acreage throughout Anchorage, mostly with intent to expand the Carrs grocery chain. Their initial foray into south Anchorage occurred at the corner of Dimond and Old Seward, across Dimond Boulevard from the east end of what became the Dimond Center. This turned what was originally intended as industrial land into retail land, no doubt helped by the development boom associated with the trans-Alaska pipeline during the 1970s. Dimond Center opened in 1977 with Safeway and Pay 'n Save as its anchor stores.Anchorage Daily News, Alaska, Business Question and Answer Column (Brief article) It underwent a major expansion in 1981, adding a replacement Pay 'n Save drug store and other stores. In 1982, a competing development, the Great Northern Mall, was announced for the tract of land across the Old Seward Highway from the mall. Owing to a real estate-related economic crash which befell Anchorage during the most of the middle and late 1980s, only a small portion of that proposed development was ever constructed, mostly near the Dimond Boulevard and New Seward Highway intersection. This tract was fully developed during the 1990s centered on big-box stores, which supplement the Dimond Center as a destination for shoppers from a vast geographical area. A refrigerant leak on May 20, 1991 resulted in the death of the skating rink's assistant manager and injured 33 others, including six whose injuries required hospitalization. A movie theater was added in 1996.Dimond Center to add Theater ACT III Plans Nine-Screen Complext is South Anchorage Mall (brief article) The Dimond Center Hotel was later built on the mall's southwest corner, which was largely financed by Seldovia's Native corporation, Seldovia Native Association, Inc. The Samson-Dimond Library, a branch of the Anchorage Public Library and an original tenant of the mall, closed at the end of 2010 due to budget cuts.

These tree frogs are commonly found in rice paddies, and rest during the day on rice leaves and other broad- leaved vegetation. During the early evening, they are active and move to lights to catch the insects attracted to the lights. Acting as opportunistic predators, D. japonicus mainly preys on species which are the most widely available to them, including a number of insects, such as ants, beetles, caterpillars, dipterans, and spiders.

Notice that after a 360¬∞ rotation, the spiral flips between clockwise and counterclockwise orientations. It returns to its original configuration after spinning a full 720¬∞. In quantum mechanics, spin is an intrinsic property of all elementary particles. All known fermions, the particles that constitute ordinary matter, have a spin of . The spin number describes how many symmetrical facets a particle has in one full rotation; a spin of means that the particle must be fully rotated twice (through 720¬∞) before it has the same configuration as when it started. Particles having net spin include the proton, neutron, electron, neutrino, and quarks. The dynamics of spin- objects cannot be accurately described using classical physics; they are among the simplest systems which require quantum mechanics to describe them. As such, the study of the behavior of spin- systems forms a central part of quantum mechanics.  Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment  The necessity of introducing half- integer spin goes back experimentally to the results of the Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment. A beam of atoms is run through a strong heterogeneous magnetic field, which then splits into N parts depending on the intrinsic angular momentum of the atoms. It was found that for silver atoms, the beam was split in two‚Äîthe ground state therefore could not be an integer, because even if the intrinsic angular momentum of the atoms were the smallest (non-zero) integer possible, 1, the beam would be split into 3 parts, corresponding to atoms with Lz = ‚àí1, +1, and 0, with 0 simply being the value known to come between -1 and +1 while also being a whole-integer itself, and thus a valid quantized spin number in this case. The existence of this hypothetical \\"extra step\\" between the two polarized quantum states would necessitate a third quantum state; a third beam, which is not observed in the experiment. The conclusion was that silver atoms had net intrinsic angular momentum of .  General properties  Heuristic depiction of spin angular momentum cones for a spin- particle. Spin- objects are all fermions (a fact explained by the spin‚Äìstatistics theorem) and satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. Spin- particles can have a permanent magnetic moment along the direction of their spin, and this magnetic moment gives rise to electromagnetic interactions that depend on the spin. One such effect that was important in the discovery of spin is the Zeeman effect, the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field. Unlike in more complicated quantum mechanical systems, the spin of a spin- particle can be expressed as a linear combination of just two eigenstates, or eigenspinors. These are traditionally labeled spin up and spin down. Because of this, the quantum-mechanical spin operators can be represented as simple 2 √ó 2 matrices. These matrices are called the Pauli matrices. Creation and annihilation operators can be constructed for spin- objects; these obey the same commutation relations as other angular momentum operators.  Connection to the uncertainty principle  One consequence of the generalized uncertainty principle is that the spin projection operators (which measure the spin along a given direction like x, y, or z) cannot be measured simultaneously. Physically, this means that it is ill-defined what axis a particle is spinning about. A measurement of the z-component of spin destroys any information about the x- and y-components that might previously have been obtained. Mathematical description A spin- particle is characterized by an angular momentum quantum number for spin s of . In solutions of the Schr√∂dinger equation, angular momentum is quantized according to this number, so that total spin angular momentum :S = {{\\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}+1\\\\right)}}}\\\\ \\\\hbar = \\\\tfrac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\\\hbar . However, the observed fine structure when the electron is observed along one axis, such as the z-axis, is quantized in terms of a magnetic quantum number, which can be viewed as a quantization of a vector component of this total angular momentum, which can have only the values of . Note that these values for angular momentum are functions only of the reduced Planck constant (the angular momentum of any photon), with no dependence on mass or charge. =Complex phase = Mathematically, quantum mechanical spin is not described by a vector as in classical angular momentum. It is described by a complex-valued vector with two components called a spinor. There are subtle differences between the behavior of spinors and vectors under coordinate rotations, stemming from the behavior of a vector space over a complex field. When a spinor is rotated by 360¬∞ (one full turn), it transforms to its negative, and then after a further rotation of 360¬∞ it transforms back to its initial value again. This is because in quantum theory the state of a particle or system is represented by a complex probability amplitude (wavefunction) œà, and when the system is measured, the probability of finding the system in the state œà equals , the square of the absolute value of the amplitude. In mathematical terms, the quantum Hilbert space carries a projective representation of the rotation group SO(3). Suppose a detector that can be rotated measures a particle in which the probabilities of detecting some state are affected by the rotation of the detector. When the system is rotated through 360¬∞, the observed output and physics are the same as initially but the amplitudes are changed for a spin- particle by a factor of ‚àí1 or a phase shift of half of 360¬∞. When the probabilities are calculated, the ‚àí1 is squared, (‚àí1)2 = 1, so the predicted physics is the same as in the starting position. Also, in a spin- particle there are only two spin states and the amplitudes for both change by the same ‚àí1 factor, so the interference effects are identical, unlike the case for higher spins. The complex probability amplitudes are something of a theoretical construct which cannot be directly observed. If the probability amplitudes rotated by the same amount as the detector, then they would have changed by a factor of ‚àí1 when the equipment was rotated by 180¬∞ which when squared would predict the same output as at the start, but experiments show this to be wrong. If the detector is rotated by 180¬∞, the result with spin- particles can be different to what it would be if not rotated, hence the factor of a half is necessary to make the predictions of the theory match the experiments. In terms of more direct evidence, physical effects of the difference between the rotation of a spin- particle by 360¬∞ as compared with 720¬∞ have been experimentally observed in classic experiments in neutron interferometry. In particular, if a beam of spin-oriented spin- particles is split, and just one of the beams is rotated about the axis of its direction of motion and then recombined with the original beam, different interference effects are observed depending on the angle of rotation. In the case of rotation by 360¬∞, cancellation effects are observed, whereas in the case of rotation by 720¬∞, the beams are mutually reinforcing. =NRQM (non-relativistic quantum mechanics)= The quantum state of a spin- particle can be described by a two-component complex-valued vector called a spinor. Observable states of the particle are then found by the spin operators Sx, Sy, and Sz, and the total spin operator S. Observables When spinors are used to describe the quantum states, the three spin operators (Sx, Sy, Sz,) can be described by 2 √ó 2 matrices called the Pauli matrices whose eigenvalues are . For example, the spin projection operator Sz affects a measurement of the spin in the z direction. : S_z = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} \\\\sigma _z = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&-1 \\\\end{bmatrix} The two eigenvalues of Sz, , then correspond to the following eigenspinors: :\\\\chi_+ = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\left \\\\vert {s_z {=} {+\\\\textstyle\\\\frac 1 2}} \\\\right \\\\rang =  {\\\\uparrow } \\\\rang =  0 \\\\rang :\\\\chi_- = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\left \\\\vert {s_z {=} {-\\\\textstyle\\\\frac 1 2}} \\\\right \\\\rang =  {\\\\downarrow} \\\\rang =  1 \\\\rang. These vectors form a complete basis for the Hilbert space describing the spin- particle. Thus, linear combinations of these two states can represent all possible states of the spin, including in the x- and y-directions. The ladder operators are: : S_+ = \\\\hbar \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0&1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0 \\\\end{bmatrix}, S_-= \\\\hbar \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&0 \\\\end{bmatrix} Since , and . Thus: : S_x = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} \\\\sigma _x = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0&1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&0 \\\\end{bmatrix} : S_y = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} \\\\sigma _y = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0&-i\\\\\\\\\\\\ i&0 \\\\end{bmatrix} Their normalized eigenspinors can be found in the usual way. For Sx, they are: : \\\\chi^{(x)}_+ = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\left \\\\vert {s_x {=} {+\\\\textstyle\\\\frac 1 2}} \\\\right \\\\rang : \\\\chi^{(x)}_- = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\left \\\\vert {s_x {=} {-\\\\textstyle\\\\frac 1 2}} \\\\right \\\\rang For Sy, they are: : \\\\chi^{(y)}_+ = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ i \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\left \\\\vert {s_y {=} {+\\\\textstyle\\\\frac 1 2}} \\\\right \\\\rang : \\\\chi^{(y)}_- = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -i \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\left \\\\vert {s_y {=} {-\\\\textstyle\\\\frac 1 2}} \\\\right \\\\rang =RQM (relativistic quantum mechanics)= While NRQM defines spin with 2 dimensions in Hilbert space with dynamics that are described in 3-dimensional space and time, relativistic quantum mechanics defines the spin with 4 dimensions in Hilbert space and dynamics described by 4-dimensional space-time. Observables As a consequence of the four-dimensional nature of space-time in relativity, relativistic quantum mechanics uses 4√ó4 matrices to describe spin operators and observables. Spin as a consequence of combining quantum theory and special relativity When physicist Paul Dirac tried to modify the Schr√∂dinger equation so that it was consistent with Einstein's theory of relativity, he found it was only possible by including matrices in the resulting Dirac Equation, implying the wave must have multiple components leading to spin.

Early life Lindsay was born in the Victorian town of Creswick, into a creative family ‚Äì he was the brother of artist Norman Lindsay and artist and critic Daryl Lindsay and of the relatively unknown artists Ruby Lindsay and Percy Lindsay. Lionel became a pupil-assistant at the Melbourne Observatory (1889‚Äì1892) and later studied at the National Gallery School, Melbourne and in George Coates' rooms. Lindsay taught himself etching and engraving in the 1890s while a student, immediately prior to his first trip to Spain and England. On his return to Australia he settled in Sydney as a freelance artist and journalist, contributing to The Bulletin and other magazines and newspapers. He married Jean, a sister of the literary Dyson boys (Ted, Will, and Ambrose), while Will married Lionel's sister Ruby. Career Pastoral. Lionel Lindsay after Sydney Long (1918) In 1907 he held an extremely successful exhibition of etchings in Sydney with the Society of Artists. The two decades after 1907 saw him active with the Society of Artists and in 1921, when the Australian Painter-Etchers' Society was formed, Lindsay was its first president. He began to exhibit in London in 1923 and had his most successful exhibition of that period at Colnaghi, a London art dealer, in 1927. Colnaghi's Galleries and the critic Harold Wright led British interest in Lindsay's work and guaranteed his reputation as a major British printmaker and watercolourist. Key themes in his oeuvre include the swagman in the outback, old Sydney, portraits of prominent Australians, romantic views of Spain and Arab culture, a series of classically inspired works and birds and animals. Lindsay became a Trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales and was knighted for his services to Australian art in 1941. In 1942 Lindsay published Addled Art, a vituperative and anti-semitic attack on modernism in art. Lindsay's views on modernism, however, were not as clear cut as Addled Art would have it seem: for example, Lindsay supported William Dobell during the court case over his Archibald Prize-winning portrait of Joshua Smith. He was good friends with Ernest Moffitt and published a book on his art (see link below). A Consideration of the Art of Ernest Moffitt was the first monograph written on an Australian artist. Death Lindsay died in Melbourne on 22 May 1961. His autobiography, Comedy of Life, was published posthumously. Legacy The Lionel Lindsay Art Gallery and Library, in Toowoomba, Queensland, holds rare books, manuscripts and maps, and over 400 art works by members of the Lindsay family and other significant Australian painters, including Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts and Rupert Bunny. The library and gallery was established by local transport owner and philanthropist Bill Bolton MBE (1905‚Äì1973).

It was renamed by Liu Xin to differentiate it from a chapter in the Book of History by the same name. To replace a lost work, it was included along with the Book of Rites and the Etiquette and Ceremonial becoming one of three ancient ritual texts (the \\"Three Rites\\") listed among the classics of Confucianism. In comparison with other works of its type, the Rite's ruler, though a sage, does not create the state, but merely organizes a bureaucracy. It could not have been composed during the Western Zhou, and was probably based on Warring States period societies. Michael Puett and Mark Edward Lewis compares its system of duties and ranks to the \\"Legalism\\" of Shang Yang.Benjamin Elman, Martin Kern 2010 p.17,41. Statecraft and Classical Learning: The Rituals of Zhou in East Asian History. https://books.google.com/books?id=SjSwCQAAQBAJ&pg;=PA17 * Dingxin Zhao 2015 p.72. The Confucian-Legalist State. https://books.google.com/books?id=wPmJCgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA72 Authorship The book appeared in the middle of the 2nd century BC, when it was found and included in the collection of Old Texts in the library of Prince Liu De (; d. 130 BC), a younger brother of the Han emperor Wu. Its first editor was Liu Xin (c. 50 BC AD 23), who credited it to the Duke of Zhou. Tradition since at least the Song dynasty continued this attribution, with the claim that Liu Xin's edition was the final one. In the 12th century, it was given special recognition by being placed among the Five Classics as a substitute for the long-lost sixth work, the Classic of Music. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, following Kang Youwei, the book was often seen as a forgery by Liu Xin. Currently, a few holdouts continue to insist on a Western Zhou date while the majority follow Qian Mu and Gu Jiegang in assigning the work to about the 3rd century BC. Yu Yingshi argues for a date in the late Warring States period based on a comparison of titles in the text with extant bronze inscriptions and calendrical knowledge implicit in the work In this view, the word \\"Zhou\\" in the title refers not to the Western Zhou but to the royal State of Zhou of the Warring States; the small area still directly under the king's control. Contents Bronze chariot model based on a passage of the Rites of Zhou, \\"Make the criminal with his left foot cut off guard the gardens\\" () The book is divided into six chapters: #Offices of the Heaven () on general governance; #Offices of Earth () on taxation and division of land; #Offices of Spring () on education as well as social and religious institutions; #Offices of Summer () on the army; #Office of Autumn () on justice; #Office of Winter () on population, territory, and agriculture. The work consists mainly of schematic lists of Zhou dynasty bureaucrats, stating what the function of each office is and who is eligible to hold it. Sometimes though the mechanical listing is broken off by pieces of philosophical exposition on how a given office contributes to social harmony and enforces the universal order. The division of chapters follows the six departments of the Zhou dynasty government. The bureaucrats within a department come in five ranks: minister (' ), councilor (' ), senior clerk (' ), middle clerk (' ) and junior clerk (' ). There is only one minister per department -the department head-, but the other four ranks all have multiple holders spread across various specific professions. In addition to the Etiquette and Ceremonial, the Rites of Zhou contain one of the earliest references to the Three Obediences and Four Virtues, a set of principles directed exclusively at women that formed a core part of female education during the Zhou. Record of Trades A part of the Winter Offices, the Record of Trades ('), contains important information on technology, architecture, city planning, and other topics. A passage records that, \\"The master craftsman constructs the state capital. He makes a square nine ' on one side; each side has three gates. Within the capital are nine north-south and nine east-west streets. The north-south streets are nine carriage tracks in width\\".

The LLLP form of business entity is recognized under United States commercial law. An LLLP is a limited partnership, and it consists of one or more general partners who are liable for the obligations of the entity, as well as or more protected-liability limited partners. Typically, general partners manage the LLLP, while the limited partners' interest is purely financial. Thus, the most common use of limited partnership is for purposes of investment. LLLP versus LP The essential distinction between older LLP and newer LLLP is that the latter allows liability transfer from the general partner's (to external insurer) for debts and obligations of the limited partnership (LLLP). In a traditional limited partnership the general partners are jointly and severally liable for its debts and obligations; limited partners are not liable for those debts and obligations beyond the amount of their capital contributions. In an LLLP, by having the limited partnership make an election under state law, the general partners are afforded limited liability for the debts and obligations of the limited partnership that arise during the period that the LLLP election is in place. Certain LLLP elections take the form of a limited partnership electing to be a limited liability partnership (this is the format used in Delaware, for example) while in other states the election is made in the certificate of limited partnership (examples being Florida, Hawaii and Kentucky). Most states require that an LLLP identify itself in its name, but those requirements are not universal. Because the LLLP is so new, its use is not widespread. See list below: several states have adopted statutes that allow formation of an LLLP, usually as a conversion of an existing limited partnership (the general partners might want to do this to reduce their legal liability). The filing fees of an LLLP vs. a limited partnership are at times higher. In the case of Nevada, the Secretary of State charges $75 to register a limited partnership and $100 to register an LLLP. Additionally, the initial and annual report filing for an LLLP in Nevada is $175 vs. $125 for a limited partnership. Conversely, in Kentucky the filing fee for a limited partnership is no higher if the partnership elects to be an LLLP. LLLPs are most common in the real estate business, although other businesses can also use the form, for example, CNN. There are significant questions about whether the limited liability provided to general partners by the LLLP election will be effective in states that do not have an LLLP statute.

It depicts the suffering and stress of an arduous journey, together with the unwavering loyalty and courage of the three animals. The story is set in the northwestern part of Ontario, which has many lakes, rivers, and widely dispersed small farms and towns. It is usually considered a children's book, although Burnford has stated that she did not write it specifically for children. The book was a modest success when first published, but became widely known after 1963 when it was loosely adapted into a movie by the same name by Walt Disney. The story was again adapted loosely when Disney remade the film in 1993 as Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Burnford based the fictional story on the animals she and her husband owned while living in Canada: a Bull Terrier brought from England; a Siamese cat, whose mutual relationship with the terrier she described as \\"closer than any other cat-and-dog relationship I had ever seen\\"; and a young Labrador Retriever, who also developed a close relationship with the older dog. Plot The animals' owners, the Hunters, leave to go to England for several months because Jim, the father, is scheduled to give a series of university lectures there. They leave their pets in the care of John Longridge, a family friend and godfather of their daughter, Elizabeth. One day, after John Longridge leaves for a two-week duck hunting trip, the animals, feeling the lack of their human helpers, set out to try to find their owners, the Hunters. Mrs. Oakes, who is taking care of Longridges' home, does not find the animals and thinks that John must have taken them with him. The animals follow their instincts and head west, towards home, 300 miles away through the Canadian wilderness. They face many obstacles in their path; from rivers to irritable people, but nonetheless, they struggle bravely on, until they finally reach home. =Characters= * Luath: Luath is a young Labrador Retriever. His fur is red-gold, his eyes are brown, and he is strongly built. Of the Hunter's three pets, he is the most recent addition. He is also the most determined to push forward and reach home and the Hunters. Luath usually walks on Bodger's left side. * Bodger: Bodger (whose full name is Champion Boroughcastle Brigadier of Doune) is an old English Bull Terrier. His fur is white with a slight pinkish tint. Bodger's left eye is nearly blind. The dog was born to fight and endure (as he does in the book). Because he is eleven years old, Bodger tires easily; but he is a brave, loyal, persevering, and tenacious companion. He is very fond of humans, particularly children, and whenever the group comes across humans in their travels, he tries to charm them for affection and snacks, with varying results. He has an intense hostility towards all cats save Tao, who earned his respect by standing up to him when Tao first joined the Hunter family as a small kitten. Though they care deeply for Luath, Bodger and Tao have a special bond. Bodger is the first of the animals to have joined the Hunter family. Despite his advanced age and diminished senses, Bodger is still every bit the fighter he was in his prime, at one point saving Luath from a Border Collie sicced on them by an irate farmer. * Tao: Tao is a slender, seal-point, old-style Siamese cat with sapphire eyes. Tao has a royal white body with dark black features such as his face, feet, and tail. An element of humor in the book is that Tao, like Bodger, despises other cats, and the two once shared many adventures terrorizing the other felines in their neighborhood; when they encounter other domesticated cats in their travels, Tao often fights them, successfully. Tao is able to open most doors, a help to the dogs in several situations. Tao is a tireless, bold, and loyal animal. Tao is probably the best equipped of the three to survive in the wilderness, and has no difficulty surviving on his own when separated from the two dogs; despite this, he spends all his time seeking to rejoin them, a testament to the bond between the animals. The cat is an independent and natural hunter, catching small birds for the group. When Tao is separated from them, the dogs fare more poorly without Tao than Tao does without them. Therefore, Tao is crucial to the dogs' survival. * John Longridge: John Longridge is Elizabeth Hunter's godfather. He lives in a stone house in a small village about 300 miles from the college town where the Hunters live. Mr. Longridge wrote several historical books, is a writer by profession, and a bachelor. * The Hunter Family: The Hunter Family consists of the father Jim, the mother and their two children, 11-year-old Peter and nine- year-old Elizabeth. Jim owns Luath, Elizabeth owns Tao, and Peter owns Bodger. * Mrs. Oakes: Mrs. Oakes is the owner of the three animals while John is gone on his trip. * The Nurmi Family: The Nurmi family is a family of Finnish immigrants. Ten-year-old Helvi rescues and nurses Tao after she discovers him unconscious in the river by her house, having been swept up by flotsam from a broken beaver dam while trying to swim across with the dogs upstream. * The Mackenzies: James and Nell Mackenzie are elderly farmers who live alone, now that their eight children have grown, and they are instrumental in helping the dogs to survive. Bodger charms his way into their home and their pantry, and Luath appears soon afterward, his instincts leading him to fetch for James while he is duck hunting. James removes porcupine quills from Luath's muzzle, allowing the dog to recover and continue his journey. Tao is present at the farm while his companions rest and recover, and instrumental in freeing the dogs from the barn, but he is unseen by the Mackenzies. *The Lynx: The Lynx tried to attack and eat Tao, but a hunter killed him, without realizing Tao was in a rabbits den the Lynx was digging into. *Farm Dog: The Farm Dog was a vicious and mean sheepdog who attacked Luath, but Bodger intervened and fended him off. *Bear cub: The Bear cub thought Bodger was a toy and pawed at him with his sharp claws until Tao intervened and tried to protect him. *Mother Bear: The Mother Bear tried to protect her cub when Tao attacked him until she was chased off by Luath.

It is operated by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. The supermax prison, Southport Correctional Facility, is located two miles away from Elmira. The facility was founded in 1876 as the Elmira Reformatory and run by its controversial superintendent Zebulon Brockway. Acting with rehabilitative aims, Brockway instilled strict discipline along the lines of military training. Although accused of brutality for his corporal punishment in 1893, Brockway was an acknowledged leader in his field. At his retirement in 1900 the Elmira System had been adopted by the states of Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, and Minnesota. In 1970 the complex was renamed the Elmira Correctional and Reception Center. Elmira retained a focus on younger offenders until some time in the 1990s. Early years The facility was founded as Elmira Reformatory in 1876. It differed from many prisons of the day as it focused on reforming the convict using psychological methods rather than physical. Previously, prisoners were required to abide by the \\"holy trinity\\" of silence, obedience and labor. Sentences were indeterminate. Inmates were only released after a warden's determination that they'd \\"paid their debt to society.\\" In contrast Elmira sought to reform and rehabilitate. Brockway set up a system of incentives to encourage self-discipline.History of Elmira CF = Elmira system = Elmira Reformatory, circa 1897 Among the programs begun at the reformatory included courses in ethics and religion, vocational training in various trades and extracurricular activities such as a prison band, newspaper and various athletic leagues. Influenced by the methods of Walter Crofton's \\"Irish system\\" as well as Alexander Maconochie's experiments in Australian penal colonies, discipline was largely patterned after military academies. Inmates would be dressed in military style uniforms often marching to the tune of a military band. Inmates were classified by three \\"grades,\\" with newly arriving prisoners being placed at second grade for their first six months. Those who became the most responsive and cooperative prisoners earned a first grade, with the opportunity to earn additional privileges or \\"marks,\\" including earning a reduction of their sentences or being granted parole (although inmates could be demoted if failing in their duties). Those inmates who were less responsive to rehabilitation or had behavioral problems were placed at third grade. However, under instituted indeterminate sentencing, tension was often high among the general population as prisoners were rarely informed how long the terms of their imprisonment lasted. Brockway's later use of corporal punishment, the \\"Paddler Brockway\\" system that would eventually result several prisoners' being transferred to mental asylums, caused some to question the reformatory system. Still, the Elmira system was influential in prison reform. Two central ideas emerged from the Elmira system: differentiating between juvenile and adult offenders, and acknowledging the possibility of prisoner rehabilitation.\\"Elmira system,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online, February 2010. Later years Despite its mixed results, the Elmira Reformatory would influence the construction of 25 reformatories in twelve states over the next 25 years, reaching its height in 1910. Although the education programs introduced in Elmira were the first to serve inmates in a correctional facility, the majority of the teaching staff were often unqualified and its complex grading system made progress difficult to maintain. Eventually, all well-behaved inmates were placed in first grade with a few in second grade and those under punishment in third grade. However, following Brockway's resignation, the reformatory reinstituted to standard custody and treatment methods and eventually converted to the Elmira Correctional and Reception Center, an adult maximum security prison holding approximately 1,800 inmates. In the late 1970s through late 1980s, Elmira and Corning Community College had a partnership whereby college professors volunteered to lecture within the prison, and inmates were able to earn an associate degree. However, during the recession of 1990‚Äì1992 there was a public outcry over spending taxpayer money to educate felons while many middle-class families struggled to pay their children's college tuition. As a result, the program was cut. There were attempts to revive the program in later years but by the time George Pataki, the former GOP governor, finished his budget cuts, the program was completely terminated. Convicted murderers Timothy Vail and Timothy Morgan escaped on July 7, 2003, by digging through the roof of their cell. Vail seriously injured himself during the escape, and the two were captured three days later and placed in solitary confinement in different prisons. Their escape was featured in the National Geographic documentary Breakout. Elmira is a major stop in the New York State Department or Corrections bus network, with a large enclosed yard that holds many, and inmate transfers.

It belongs to the \\"crows and tigers\\", that is, the Danainae group of the brush-footed butterflies family. The butterfly is also called striped tiger in India to differentiate it from the equally common plain tiger, Danaus chrysippus.Kunte (2000): 45, pp. 148-149. The species was first described by Pieter Cramer in 1779. Description The butterfly closely resembles the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) of the Americas. The wingspan is . Both sexes of the butterfly have tawny wings with veins marked with broad black bands. The male has a pouch on the hindwing.Wynter-Blyth (1957): p. 69. The margins of the wings are black with two rows of white spots. The underside of the wings resembles the upperside but is paler in colouration. The male common tiger has a prominent black-and-white spot on the underside of the hindwing. In drier regions the tawny part of the hindwing pales and approaches white in colour making it very similar to the white tiger (D. melanippus). Distribution and ecology D. genutia is distributed throughout India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and extending to South-East Asia and Australia (except New Guinea). At least in the South Asian part of its range it is fairly common, locally very common. This butterfly occurs in scrub jungles, fallowland adjacent to habitation, dry and moist deciduous forests, preferring areas of moderate to heavy rainfall. Also occurs in degraded hill slopes and ridges, both, bare or denuded, and, those covered with secondary growth. While it is a strong flier, it never flies rapidly or high. It has stronger and faster strokes than the plain tiger. The butterfly ranges forth in search of its host and nectar plants. It visits gardens where it nectars on the flowers of Adelocaryum, Cosmos, Celosia, Lantana, Zinnia, and similar flowers. =Defence against predators, mimicry= Members of this genus are leathery, tough to kill and fake death. Since they are unpleasant to smell and taste, they are soon released by the predators, recover and fly off soon thereafter. The butterfly sequesters toxins from its food plants of the family Asclepiadaceae. The butterflies also congregate with other danaiines to sip from the sap of Crotalaria, Heliotropium and other plants which provide the pyrrolizidine alkaloids which they sequester. A study in north-eastern India showed a preference to foraging on Crotalaria juncea compared to Bauhinia purpurea, Barleria cristata rosea and Nerium oleander.Bhuyan et al. (2005) To advertise their unpalatability, the butterfly has prominent markings with a striking colour pattern. The striped tiger is mimicked by both sexes of the Indian Tamil lacewing (Cethosia nietneri mahratta) and the leopard lacewing (Cethosia cyane) and females of the common palmfly (Elymnias hypermnestra).Wynter-Blyth (1957): p. 56. =Life history= This butterfly lays its egg singly under the leaves of any of its host plants of family Asclepiadaceae. The caterpillar is black and marked with bluish-white and yellow spots and lines. It has three pairs of tentacles on its body. It first eats the eggshell and then proceeds to eat leaves and vegetative parts of the plant. The chrysalis (pupa) is green and marked with golden-yellow spots.

Early life Brockway was born in Lyme, Connecticut on April 28, 1827.James J. Beha, Redemption to Reform: The Intellectual Origins of the Prison Reform Movement, New York University Annual Survey of American Law, vol. 3, 773, 2007‚Äì2008. He married Jane Woodhouse (1828-1911) on April 13, 1853. Career He began his career as a prison guard or assistant warden at the state prison in Wethersfield, Connecticut in 1848. Brockway became a clerk at the Wethersfield prison by 23 years old. Later he worked as assistant superintendent of the Municipal Alms House in Albany, New York for four years. He was made the Monroe County, New York Penitentiary superintendent in 1854. There, he focused upon rehabilitation of the prisoners. In 1861, Brockway became the superintendent of the prison in Detroit, where he attempted to introduce work and release supervision programs and \\"indeterminate sentences\\". Brockway's chief innovation, though, was his attempt to establish the country's first indeterminate sentencing system. In 1869, Brockway drafted a law, passed by the Michigan legislature but overturned by the state Supreme Court, that would allow for the conditional and discretionary release of \\"common prostitutes.\\" When he was in Detroit, he got the inspiration for his prison reforms from Moses and Amos Pilsbury, who also brought about prison reforms. He began his reforms in Detroit. However, he resigned in 1872 when his ideas were no longer accepted. Before the Elmira Reformatory was built, Brockway was already made the superintendent in 1876. While warden at the Elmira Reformatory in Upstate New York from 1876 to 1900, Brockway claimed to introduce a program of education, training in useful trades, physical activity, indeterminate sentences, inmate classification according to \\"grades,\\" and an incentive program; his own reports of the accomplishments of the reformatory were highly influential in prison reform across the nation. Publicly, Brockway claimed to believe that the aim of the prison was to rehabilitate and not simply just to punish. Grounding his claims in anecdotal and eugenic \\"prison science,\\" Brockway publicly advocated for the reformatory's provision of Christian moral education paired with manual labor as a means of reforming the individual incarcerated therein. He also used the idea of the indeterminate sentence to incentivize prison discipline. In 1895, the State Board of Charities opened an investigation into accusations of brutality at Elmira after John Gilmore, a man formerly incarcerated at the reformatory, appeared before a judge on a parole violation and begged to be sent to the state prison rather than returned to Elmira. An investigation by the State Board of Charities revealed that Brockway himself regularly inflicted violent corporal punishment on individuals incarcerated there, and utilized forced labor, solitary confinement for negligible offenses, refusal of medical care, and starvation as methods of governance. Individuals incarcerated at Elmira also testified that sexual violence was rampant and in some cases facilitated by guards, that the grading system was used arbitrarily as a method to keep people imprisoned for longer terms, and that Brockway refused to release some people from prison unless they'd agree to take employment at Elmira Reformatory upon release. One such individual coerced into employment as a watchman at Elmira after release was found to have committed suicide during his shift. In his research on the investigation, Alexander Pisciotta writes, \\"The final report of the committee, released on 14 March 1894, was unequivocal; its findings were unanimously endorsed by the ten members of the New York State Board of Charities: 'That the charges and the allegations against the general superintendent Z.R. Brockway of 'cruel, brutal, excessive, degrading and unusual punishment of the inmates' are proven and most amply sustained by the evidence, and that he is guilty of the same.' Brockway retired at the age of 72 in 1900 after further criticism. Brockway was such a popular man in Elmira that he was elected mayor five years later at 77. In 1912, he wrote Fifty Years of Prison Service: An Autobiography (1912). Death Zebulon Brockway died in Elmira on October 21, 1920 at the age of 93.

The factory is designated by the government as a historic site and all its buildings are preserved in very good condition. It is a big factory in the old city of Tomioka, in Gunma prefecture, Japan ‚Äî about 100 km northwest of Tokyo. History Soon after the Meiji Restoration in the late 19th century, the Japanese government hastened the modernization of Japan to catch up with European countries. Japanese raw silk was the most important export and sustained the growth of Japan‚Äôs economy at that time. During this boom, however, the Japanese silk industry began to sacrifice the quality of its silk for quantity, which rapidly harmed the reputation of Japan as a raw silk manufacturer. As a result, the national government decided to establish the Tomioka Silk Mill as a model filature facility equipped with the most sophisticated machinery to improve the quality of raw silk. In 1870, Paul Brunat, who worked in a French trading company in Yokohama, researched suitable locations for a silk mill in the Kant≈ç region and selected the site in Tomioka City from among the candidates. The construction began in 1871 and was completed in July the next year. Three months later the factory started operation. In the beginning, there were 150 silk reeling machines (300 basins), and about 400 female workers operated the machines in the mill. The lifestyle of the workers has been recorded in the diary of one, Wada Ei. Tomioka Silk Mill concentrated on offering high-quality raw silk. But even though their silk enjoyed a good reputation overseas for its high quality, the business was always in the red. Even after reducing costs, they continued to suffer from chronic deficits. As a result, the government decided to privatize Tomioka Silk Mill and transferred its business to the Mitsui Finance Group in 1893. In 1902 it was transferred again, from the Mitsui Finance Group to the Hara Company. In 1939 (the 14th year of the Showa Era), Tomioka Silk Mill was transferred to Katakura Industries Co., Ltd, the largest silk reeling company in Japan. The mill contributed actively to the growth of Japan‚Äôs economy during and after World War II. Tomioka Silk Mill was closed in March 1987, and it is well looked after as a historic site. In 2005 Tomioka Silk Mill was designated by the government as a historical site and was transferred to Tomioka city, and was added to the World Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 21, 2014.

Dick became a successful merchant in the West Indies and later in London. Following his death, he bequeathed ¬£113,787 to encourage \\"learning and efficient teaching\\" among the parish schoolmasters of Elgin, Banff, and Aberdeen shires. This fund is known as the Dick Bequest, and awards continue to be made to school boards in the region. Career Dick grew up in a house in Forres High Street. In the summer months, he herded cattle and during the rest of the year he received his education at Rafford grammar school about 3 miles from Forres. His father employed him as his bookkeeper and it was during this time that Dick wished to marry the family's household servant. Because his parents objected to this, Dick left home at the age of nineteen for the West Indies. He settled in Kingston, Jamaica where he became clerk in a merchant house. Along with his brother John Dick, he set up a business importing colonial produce into London. After twenty years, he transferred his share of the business to his brother and returned to London a very wealthy man. Dick's brother John sold the business when he retired and returned to Scotland but suddenly fell ill in and died. James inherited his fortune. Philanthropist After providing for his daughter, Dick left over ¬£113,000 in his will with instructions for the setting up of a bequest fund to help the schoolmasters and schools in Aberdeenshire, Banffshire and Morayshire. Most of the masters were arts graduates who taught only while they waited for a career in the church. Dick's vision was that the most learned of these would be encouraged to stay in education for the benefit of both themselves and the children they taught. By 1833 the endowment yielded between ¬£3300 and ¬£5500 annually and had grown to around ¬£200,000. The fund was administered by trustees belonging to the Society of Writers to the Signet. Applicants were rigorously examined for suitability and were required to be proficient in teaching classical languages, humanities, mathematics and science; those who were successful doubled their salaries. The Education (Scotland) Act 1872 changed the way in which the grants were dispensed by ensuring that endowments were transferred to school boards.

The band released two full-length albums, A Strange Education (2007) and Love and Terror (2009), as well as a five-track EP, \\"Silent Scream EP\\" (2010), but split up in the middle of recording their third full-length album. The band consisted of Scott Rinning, Larry Reid, Adam Goemans and Ross Bonney. History =Formation and A Strange Education (2003‚Äì2008)= The band was formed by Scott Rinning (vocals and guitar), Ramsay Miller (lead guitar), Adam Goemans (bass) and Ross Bonney (drums) in 2003 in Glasgow, however, the members originally met at school in Dingwall. The band were signed to TVT Records in 2005 after playing at an In the City showcase gig in Manchester. Their debut album A Strange Education was produced by Simon Barnicott (Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, Editors, Kaiser Chiefs) and Stephen Hague (New Order, Blur, Pet Shop Boys), and released on 6 March 2007. In early 2008, it was reported that TVT Records was suffering financial difficulties and was forced to file for Chapter 11/Bankruptcy. The label and its assets were purchased by New York-based digital-distribution company, The Orchard. Much of the TVT roster was dropped, but The Cinematics‚Äô recording contract was retained. Around the same time, the band parted company with Ramsay Miller, who was replaced by Larry Reid, who had previously played with the band live on tour. =Love and Terror and the break-up (2009‚Äì2011)= In their Myspace blogs, the band reported at various stages that they were writing and self-producing their second studio album, despite suggestions that it would be produced by Richard Gottehrer (Blondie, Dr Feelgood, Richard Hell). The Cinematics' second album, Love and Terror, was released on 6 October 2009. On 22 May 2010, the band released a five-track EP titled Silent Scream EP, recorded partially live while on tour during late 2009 and early 2010. Both Love and Terror and the EP were produced by the band's guitarist, Larry Reid. In 2010, Reservoir Media Management acquired 100% of the Cinematics publishing assets which had formerly been administered by TVT Music Enterprises, LLC. The Cinematics moved to Berlin in 2010 and began recording their third studio album there. The album was set to be named \\"Kino\\". In July 2011, however, Reid announced in an interview with The Pop Cop that the band had split up before completing it. The Cinematics' third album remains unreleased to date, but the band did make one track - \\"Nausea\\" - available free to fans on their Facebook page. In June 2012, Larry Reid released an album with his post-Cinematics project, Laurence and the Slab Boys. The record, Lo-Fi Disgrace, features appearances by fellow Cinematics, Ross Bonney and Adam Goemans.

The result of the battle was a decisive Muslim victory. The details of this battle are mostly known through Muslim sources, such as the ninth-century historian al-Waqidi. Sources Regarding the primary sources, there is an absence of any of Byzantine provenance; possibly, according to Walter Kaegi, because what Byzantine material exists may conflate the battle with other Byzantine defeats, such as Dathin and Yarmouk. The earliest source appears to be an entry in the Frankish Chronicle of Fredegar, compiled in 658-660, unless this is a possible interpolation. Background According to David Nicolle, the Rashidun army left the capital Medina probably in the autumn of 633, but possibly at the beginning of 634. They first engaged and defeated the Byzantines at Dathin on February 4; after that Emperor Heraclius, then stationed in Emesa, had reinforcements sent south to protect Caesarea Maritima. As a possible reaction, commander Khalid ibn al-Walid was ordered to interrupt operations against the Sassanian Empire and reach Syria, which brought him to engage and defeat the Byzantine-allied Ghassanids by April 24, permitting him to enter almost unopposed in Bosra. At this point, Khalid converged with several armies, led by generals such as Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah, Yazid ibn Abu Sufyan, Amr ibn al-As and Shurahbil ibn Hasana.D. Nicolle, Yarmuk 636 AD - The Muslim Conquest of Syria, Osprey, 1994, p. 46. Khalid united with Amr's forces in a place known traditionally as Adjnadayn. The site is placed by the Muslim literary sources somewhere between Ramla and Bayt Jibrin (modern Beit Guvrin), both in modern Israel, but is otherwise unattested by any geographer of the period. Based on the region's topography, the historian N. A. Miednikoff suggested that the battle was fought on the Wadi al-Samt river, where lies the twin village of al-Jannaba. According to the hypothesis advanced by Miednikoff and Michael Jan de Goeje and summarized by Leone Caetani, it was from the dual form (al-Jannabatayn) of the village the historical name of the battle emerged, by conflation with the plural for \\"army\\", ajnad. Opposing forces Regarding the strength of the confronting armies, H. A. R. Gibb in the Encyclopaedia of Islam argues that, at best, both forces were made up of 10,000 men, and that the numbers offered in the Muslim sources are \\"highly exaggerated\\", especially as regards the Byzantines. David Morray in the Oxford Companion to Military History, however, places both armies at approximately 20,000 strong. The Byzantines were led by Heraclius' brother Theodore, as well as by a figure called \\"Artabun\\" or \\"Wardan\\" in the Muslim sources, evidently a corruption of the Armenian name Vardan. The Muslim sources name him as the patrikios (commander) of Emesa, which was the major Byzantine base of operations in Syria in the early period of the Muslim conquests. According to Kaegi, he possibly commanded fresh reinforcements from the north, including Armenians, or from the army that had accompanied Heraclius to Syria. In addition, the army may have also contained local Arab tribal levies. The Arab army consisted of three separate contingents, with either Khalid or, less likely, Amr, as the overall commander. Battle and aftermath The Byzantines suffered a heavy defeat and were forced to retreat to Damascus. The Arabs suffered heavy casualties, and Muslim tradition records several lists of Companions of Muhammad, including several members of the early Muslim aristocracy, who fell in the battle and were regarded as martyrs. The high number of deaths served to reinvigorate the sense of religious martyrdom among the nascent Muslim community, while the high proportion of Meccan deaths served as a useful counterbalance to the influence of the Medinan Ansar. On the Byzantine side, the Muslim sources report that one of the two commanders, probably Vardan, fell in the battle, but that Theodore escaped and withdrew north where Heraclius replaced him with Vahan and Theodore Trithyrius and sent him to imprisonment in Constantinople. Heraclius himself withdrew from Emesa to the greater safety of Antioch after Ajnadayn, while the surviving Byzantine units fled to the safety of walled towns, and left the countryside undefended before the Muslim raids. The whole of Palestine was thus left open to Muslim raids, especially in the interior parts away from the coastal towns. As a result, panic spread across the region, and large numbers of the rural population also sought safety behind the town walls. After their victory, the Arab army once more broke up into several raiding columns, with Amr capturing the interior towns of Nablus (Neapolis), Sabastiya (Sebastia), al-Ludd (Diospolis), Yibna, Amwas (Emmaus-Nicopolis) and Bayt Jibrin (Eleutheropolis) and the coastal town of Yafa (Jaffa). Most of these localities surrendered after token resistance due to the flight of Byzantine troops. The Arab columns reunited once more to confront another Byzantine attempt at halting the Muslim invasion at the Battle of Fahl (near Pella in modern Jordan) six months later.

Genois was the top- ranked Canadian singles player during 1978 and 1979. His career high ranking of World No. 89 was the highest grand prix tour computer ranking for a Canadian until Glenn Michibata reached World No. 79 in 1984. Collegiate tennis Genois played tennis at Florida State University from 1972 until 1974. Tour results =1972= Genois lost in the second round of the 1972 Canadian Open to Czechoslovak Jan Kukal 3‚Äì6, 0‚Äì6, after having had a first round bye. In doubles he and compatriot Dale Power likewise lost in the second round after a bye. =1973= Genois played in the main draw of one tour event in 1973, the Quebec Grand Prix in October. He lost handily in the first round in singles to New Zealander Onny Parun 2‚Äì6, 1‚Äì6. In doubles Genois and partner Richard Legendre, fellow Quebecer and Canadian Davis Cupper, fell in straight sets in the first round to the top-seeded pairing of Jimmy Connors and Marty Riessen. =1974= Genois competed in two event main draws in 1974. In February he competed at the WCT Toronto and lost in the first round to American Erik van Dillen 2‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6. In doubles he and partner Canadian C. Burr lost in the first round as well. In August, Genois played the Canadian Open for a second time and won his first ever tour match, as he and partner Pierre Lamarche, another Quebecer and Davis Cup player, won their first round match, 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì3, over Jeff Borowiak and Jim McManus. In the second round they fell to Manuel Orantes and Guillermo Vilas 2 and 3. In singles, Genois was again soundly beaten, this time by Mexican Joaqu√≠n Loyo Mayo 2‚Äì6, 0‚Äì6. =1975= Genois played in just one main draw in 1975, the Canadian Open for a third time. In addition, on March 5 however, he received his first computer ranking, at World No. 355 in singles, which put him Canada No. 4. By April 30 he was the country's fifth highest-ranked player. Genois competed just in singles in Montreal and did not fare well, losing to No. 7 seed American Harold Solomon 0‚Äì6, 1‚Äì6. =1976= Genois defaulted in his first round match to Ilie NƒÉstase at the Salisbury Grand Prix, played in February indoors on carpet in Salisbury, Maryland. (Nastase went on to win the title.) His ranking improved slightly - on June 14 he became World No. 326 and Canada No. 3 (in singles - doubles rankings were not kept then). For the fourth time Genois fell in the first round of the Canadian Open, this time to Australian Geoff Masters 2‚Äì6, 5‚Äì7. He played doubles again too, losing in the first round partnering compatriot and fellow Davis Cupper Dale Power. =1977= Genois competed in singles at the Taipei Grand Prix and won his first set in a tour match as he fell to American Chris Delaney 7‚Äì5, 5‚Äì7, 4‚Äì6. He also played in a grand slam event for the first time, competing in doubles at the U.S. Open. He and partner Guillermo Oropez lost 2 and 1 in the first round to the legendary doubles pair of Bob Hewitt and Frew McMillan. Despite never having won a tour singles event, remarkably, Genois was ranked World No. 184 on Dec 31, 1977, putting him at Canada No. 2. The only Canadian ranked higher was Greg Halder, at No. 127. =1978= Genois had his best tour results by some margin in 1978. He played in the newly formed challenger tour, reaching the semi-final of the third ever challenger tournament, and first American one, in Shreveport. He and partner Ramiro Benavides, of Bolivia, won the doubles title. The following week at the Birmingham Challenger Genois reached the third round in the singles event. The week after the Asheville Challenger was held with R√©jean reaching the second round in singles and taking the title in doubles, again partnering Benavides. The following week Genois, according to the ATP's results archives, played in the Raleigh Challenger and Cincinnati Grand Prix events simultaneously, reaching the second round in both. He scored his first ever win in a grand prix event over American Keith Richardson, 7‚Äì6, 7‚Äì6. He lost in the second round to Pat DuPr√© in three sets. Genois also reached the second round in doubles partnering Frenchman Christophe Freyss. In rankings released on July 12, Genois was listed as World No. 115 and Canada No. 1. He continued his good run reaching the quarter-finals of the Virginia Beach Challenger held two weeks later. In doubles he and partner Bernard Fritz lost in the first round. Genois reached his career high ranking of World No. 89 at the end of July. In following two challengers however, Genois lost in the first round in singles however. At the Wall Challenger (in Wall, New Jersey) he and partner Johan Kriek managed to reach the quarter-finals. Genois turned matters around somewhat winning his first ever singles match at the Canadian Open, as he defeated Briton Robin Drysdale 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì0. In the second he lost to eventual champion and top seed Eddie Dibbs, 2‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6. In doubles, he and compatriot Harry Fritz lost in straight sets in the first round. Genois had his best tour tournament result at the 1978 U.S. Open, reaching the third round. In doing so, Genois defeated No. 10 seed Sandy Mayer in the first round, 7‚Äì6, 6‚Äì2, and Colombian √Ålvaro Betancur in the second, 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì3. He fell to Johan Kriek in the third 2‚Äì6, 6‚Äì7. Genois played in two further challenger events in the autumn, reaching the second round of the Tinton Falls Challenger in late September and the quarter-finals of the Tel Aviv Challenger in middle October. In doubles at Tinton Falls he and partner Legendre reached the second round, while in Tel Aviv G√©nois and fellow Canadian Dale Power likewise reached the second round. Genois finished the year World No. 121 (in singles). =1979= Genois played in this first main draw for the year in early May at the Raleigh Challenger on clay, and did well reaching the third round in singles. In singles, he and partner Richard Legendre lost in the first round however. He next, two weeks later, saw action in the French Open where he went out in the opening round to No. 10 seed Brian Gottfried in straight sets. He was to be his only main draw appearance at Roland Garros. In June Genois lost in the first round in both singles, to Stefan Simonsson, 5‚Äì7, 6‚Äì7, and in doubles, partnering Legendre, at Brussels Outdoor Grand Prix. The following week he again lost in the first round in singles, again on clay, at the Berlin Grand Prix, to Javier Soler, 1‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6. The week after he appeared, for his only time, in the main draw at Wimbledon. As in Paris the previous month, the experience lasted only briefly as R√©jean was defeated by Robert Lutz, 3‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6. In July back in North America, Genois continued his losing streak going down to lucky loser entrant Juan N√∫√±ez, 1‚Äì6, 6‚Äì4, 4‚Äì6. Two weeks later at the Louisville Grand Prix, he finally got off the snide in beating Erick Iskersky, 6‚Äì4, 2‚Äì6, 7‚Äì5. In the second round he lost however to Deon Joubert without winning a single game. In doubles, he and partner Steve Krulevitz lost in the first round. The following month at the Canadian Open, R√©jean battled well in the first set before succumbing to No. 13 seed Brian Teacher, 6‚Äì7, 0‚Äì6. The following week the poor results continued as he went out in the opening round U.S. Pro Tennis Championships in Boston on Har-Tru clay, to qualifier Jai DiLouie 3‚Äì6, 3‚Äì6. The following month Genois competed in what turned out to be his final main draw for the year at the Charlotte Challenger and fared well, reaching the quarter-finals in singles and the semis, partnering Ramiro Benavides, in doubles. He finished 1979 ranked World No. 186 in singles. =1980= Genois competed in one event in a main draw, the San Luis Potos√≠ Challenger in April. Losing in the first round in singles, he captured the doubles title, partnering Mike Barr. It turned out to be his last doubles tour event that he played in. =1982= Genois made one final appearance at the Canadian Open in 1982, losing his first round match to Juan Avenda√±o, 2‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6. Davis Cup Genois had a career Davis Cup win-loss record of 13 and 14 in 13 ties for Canada, between 1973 and 1983, including going 11-9 in singles. The highlight of his play was in 1982 when Canada was one tie win away from gaining promotion to the World Group. Canada defeated Venezuela away and Colombia at home to set up a home encounter versus Paraguay. Played in Laval, Glenn Michibata narrowly lost the opening rubber, going down to former World top ten player V√≠ctor Pecci in five sets. This set up a singles encounter between Genois and veteran, former World top fifty player, Francisco Gonz√°lez. The diminutive Quebecer fell to the tall Paraguayan in straight sets sadly. The following day Paraguay took the doubles match to seal victory. Honours Genois was inducted in the Tennis Canada Hall of Fame in 1999. Post tour tennis career Genois is the current president of Tennis Qu√©bec.

If F \\\\colon\\\\mathcal{A}\\\\to\\\\mathcal{B} and G \\\\colon \\\\mathcal{B}\\\\to\\\\mathcal{C} are two additive and left exact functors between abelian categories such that both \\\\mathcal{A} and \\\\mathcal{B} have enough injectives and F takes injective objects to G-acyclic objects, then for each object A of \\\\mathcal{A} there is a spectral sequence: :E_2^{pq} = ({\\\\rm R}^p G \\\\circ{\\\\rm R}^q F)(A) \\\\Longrightarrow {\\\\rm R}^{p+q} (G\\\\circ F)(A), where {\\\\rm R}^p G denotes the p-th right-derived functor of G, etc. Many spectral sequences in algebraic geometry are instances of the Grothendieck spectral sequence, for example the Leray spectral sequence. The exact sequence of low degrees reads :0\\\\to {\\\\rm R}^1G(FA)\\\\to {\\\\rm R}^1(GF)(A) \\\\to G({\\\\rm R}^1F(A)) \\\\to {\\\\rm R}^2G(FA) \\\\to {\\\\rm R}^2(GF)(A).  Examples  = The Leray spectral sequence = If X and Y are topological spaces, let :\\\\mathcal{A} = \\\\mathbf{Ab}(X) and \\\\mathcal{B} = \\\\mathbf{Ab}(Y) be the category of sheaves of abelian groups on X and Y, respectively and :\\\\mathcal{C} = \\\\mathbf{Ab} be the category of abelian groups. For a continuous map :f \\\\colon X \\\\to Y there is the (left-exact) direct image functor :f_* \\\\colon \\\\mathbf{Ab}(X) \\\\to \\\\mathbf{Ab}(Y). We also have the global section functors :\\\\Gamma_X \\\\colon \\\\mathbf{Ab}(X)\\\\to \\\\mathbf{Ab}, and :\\\\Gamma_Y \\\\colon \\\\mathbf{Ab}(Y) \\\\to \\\\mathbf {Ab}. Then since :\\\\Gamma_Y \\\\circ f_* = \\\\Gamma_X and the functors f_* and \\\\Gamma_Y satisfy the hypotheses (since the direct image functor has an exact left adjoint f^{-1}, pushforwards of injectives are injective and in particular acyclic for the global section functor), the sequence in this case becomes: :H^p(Y,{\\\\rm R}^q f_*\\\\mathcal{F})\\\\implies H^{p+q}(X,\\\\mathcal{F}) for a sheaf \\\\mathcal{F} of abelian groups on X, and this is exactly the Leray spectral sequence. = Local-to-global Ext spectral sequence = There is a spectral sequence relating the global Ext and the sheaf Ext: let F, G be sheaves of modules over a ringed space (X, \\\\mathcal{O}); e.g., a scheme. Then :E^{p,q}_2 = \\\\operatorname{H}^p(X; \\\\mathcal{E}xt^q_{\\\\mathcal{O}}(F, G)) \\\\Rightarrow \\\\operatorname{Ext}^{p+q}_{\\\\mathcal{O}}(F, G). This is an instance of the Grothendieck spectral sequence: indeed, :R^p \\\\Gamma(X, -) = \\\\operatorname{H}^p(X, -), R^q \\\\mathcal{H}om_{\\\\mathcal{O}}(F, -) = \\\\mathcal{E}xt^q_{\\\\mathcal{O}}(F, -) and R^n \\\\Gamma(X, \\\\mathcal{H}om_{\\\\mathcal{O}}(F, -)) = \\\\operatorname{Ext}^n_{\\\\mathcal{O}}(F, -). Moreover, \\\\mathcal{H}om_{\\\\mathcal{O}}(F, -) sends injective \\\\mathcal{O}-modules to flasque sheaves, which are \\\\Gamma(X, -)-acyclic. Hence, the hypothesis is satisfied.  Derivation  We shall use the following lemma: Proof: Let Z^n, B^{n+1} be the kernel and the image of d: K^n \\\\to K^{n+1}. We have :0 \\\\to Z^n \\\\to K^n \\\\overset{d}\\\\to B^{n+1} \\\\to 0, which splits. This implies each B^{n+1} is injective. Next we look at :0 \\\\to B^n \\\\to Z^n \\\\to H^n(K^{\\\\bullet}) \\\\to 0. It splits, which implies the first part of the lemma, as well as the exactness of :0 \\\\to G(B^n) \\\\to G(Z^n) \\\\to G(H^n(K^{\\\\bullet})) \\\\to 0. Similarly we have (using the earlier splitting): :0 \\\\to G(Z^n) \\\\to G(K^n) \\\\overset{G(d)} \\\\to G(B^{n+1}) \\\\to 0. The second part now follows. \\\\square We now construct a spectral sequence. Let A^0 \\\\to A^1 \\\\to \\\\cdots be an F-acyclic resolution of A. Writing \\\\phi^p for F(A^p) \\\\to F(A^{p+1}), we have: :0 \\\\to \\\\operatorname{ker} \\\\phi^p \\\\to F(A^p) \\\\overset{\\\\phi^p}\\\\to \\\\operatorname{im} \\\\phi^p \\\\to 0. Take injective resolutions J^0 \\\\to J^1 \\\\to \\\\cdots and K^0 \\\\to K^1 \\\\to \\\\cdots of the first and the third nonzero terms. By the horseshoe lemma, their direct sum I^{p, \\\\bullet} = J \\\\oplus K is an injective resolution of F(A^p). Hence, we found an injective resolution of the complex: :0 \\\\to F(A^{\\\\bullet}) \\\\to I^{\\\\bullet, 0} \\\\to I^{\\\\bullet, 1} \\\\to \\\\cdots. such that each row I^{0, q} \\\\to I^{1, q} \\\\to \\\\cdots satisfies the hypothesis of the lemma (cf. the Cartan‚ÄìEilenberg resolution.) Now, the double complex E_0^{p, q} = G(I^{p, q}) gives rise to two spectral sequences, horizontal and vertical, which we are now going to examine. On the one hand, by definition, :{}^{\\\\prime \\\\prime} E_1^{p, q} = H^q(G(I^{p, \\\\bullet})) = R^q G(F(A^p)), which is always zero unless q = 0 since F(A^p) is G-acyclic by hypothesis. Hence, {}^{\\\\prime \\\\prime} E_{2}^n = R^n (G \\\\circ F) (A) and {}^{\\\\prime \\\\prime} E_2 = {}^{\\\\prime \\\\prime} E_{\\\\infty}. On the other hand, by the definition and the lemma, :{}^{\\\\prime} E^{p, q}_1 = H^q(G(I^{\\\\bullet, p})) = G(H^q(I^{\\\\bullet, p})). Since H^q(I^{\\\\bullet, 0}) \\\\to H^q(I^{\\\\bullet, 1}) \\\\to \\\\cdots is an injective resolution of H^q(F(A^{\\\\bullet})) = R^q F(A) (it is a resolution since its cohomology is trivial), :{}^{\\\\prime} E^{p, q}_2 = R^p G(R^qF(A)). Since {}^{\\\\prime} E_r and {}^{\\\\prime \\\\prime} E_r have the same limiting term, the proof is complete. \\\\square Notes References * * = Computational Examples = * Sharpe, Eric (2003).

Overview Traditionally, it is considered to be the place where sage Dev Sharma led his ascetic life, giving birth to its present name, Devprayag. It is one of the five sacred confluences in the hills and is an important place of pilgrimage for devout Hindus. Tehri Garhwal district, Official website. \\"Devprayag\\" means \\"Godly Confluence\\" in Sanskrit. As per Hindu scriptures, Devprayag is the sacred event of merging two visible heavenly rivers, Alakananda and Bhagirathi, to form the holy Ganga. Its believed that a third river, the mythical Saraswati river is underground and meets these two rivers at the confluence. On a terrace in the upper part of the village is the temple of Raghunathji, built of huge stones, pyramidal in form, and capped by a white cupola. Devprayag is the home of the late Acharya, Pt. Chakradhar Joshi (a scholar in Astronomy and Astrology) who established Nakshatra Vedh Shala (an observatory) in the year 1946. This is located on a mountain called Dashrathanchal at Devprayag. The observatory is well equipped with two telescopes and many books to support research in astronomy. It also contains about 3000 manuscripts from 1677 AD onwards collected from various parts of the country. Apart from the latest equipment, it also has ancient equipment like Surya Ghati, Dhruv Ghati, which showcase the pride of Bharatiya's progress in the field of astronomy. Shri Dr. Prabhakar Joshi and Acharya Shri Bhaskar Joshi (Popularly known as Guruji) are currently in charge and caretakers of the observatory. Other than Sangam and Raghunath Ji Temple in Devprayag, visitors can visit sacred places like Mata Bhuvneshwari temple at nearby village Pundal, followed by Dhaneshwar Mahadev temple, Danda Nagaraja (Lord of Snakes) temple, and Chandrabadni temple. Devprayag is the place where the rivers Alaknanda & Bhagirathi confluence. According to mythology, there is another river that belongs to this confluence named Saraswati, which originates from Mana Village in Badrinath. In Devprayag, the river comes from the feet of Shri Raghunath Ji in Raghunath Temple. Also, according to mythology, the footprints of Lord Rama are purported to exist at \\"Ram Kunda.\\" Devprayag is surrounded by 3 Godly peaks, namely Giddhanchal Parvat, Dashrathanchal Parvat, and Narsinghancal Parvat. Giddhanchal Parvat is on top of Raghunath Ji temple. Narsinghanchal Parvat is in front of Giddhanchal Parvat, and Dashrathanchal Parvat is on the top right side of \\"Sangam.\\" Lord Shiva is worshiped here in the form of Linga, named Tondeshwar Mahadev and Dhaneshwar Mahadev. Tondeshwar Mahadev is Just in front of Sangam. It is very crowded on the day of Mahashivratri. Many devotees come here to offer Gangajal on the Shiva Linga. Dhaneshwar Mahadev is en route on an old Badrinath Way, which starts from Bah Bajar (a market in Devprayag). This way, devotees can reach another temple of Maa Durga in Pundal Village. In this temple, Maa Durga is worshiped in the form of Maa Bhuvneshwari. The temple of Maa Bhuvneshwari is situated at Pundal village, at the footstep of, and approximately 500m-700m from Dhaneshwar Temple. \\"Mishras\\" live here in Pundal village. Devprayag is divided into three parts. Bah Bazzar (Pouri Side part), Beech Bajar (laying down to the Highway No. 58), and Shanti Bazar, the main bus stand of Devprayag. Devprayag is the home to the priests of Badrinath. They are known as \\"Pandas.\\" Every Panda has his own region in the whole country. A thousand years ago, when Adiguru Shankaracharya came to the area in Badrikashram in the 8th century, many South Indian Brahmins from different regions and of different castes came to Devprayag with Aadiguru. These were \\"Tetriya Krishna Yajur Brahmins.\\" Inspired by the wisdom of the Brahmins, the Maharaja of Garhwal assigned them to worship Lord Ram in Raghunath Temple in Devprayag. When these Brahmins arrived at Badrinath, they were worshiped by the pilgrims. Since then, these Brahmins are known as Panda in Dham and everywhere. Pandas serve devotees of the same area of each region they offer. Every Panda plays a significant role in the life of devotees, referred to as Y√°tris, who arrive in Badrinath for Puja or Darshan. While in Badrinath, Pandas look after them very carefully. Pandas organize everything for their Yatri like food, accommodation, puja's tickets, and everything which is really needful to the yatri. Pandas have thousands of years of literature on their devotees. This literature is purported to have information about the devotee's last 3 or 4 generations. Every Panda has various types of books related to his Yatri's information, like Bahi, Daskhati, and others. Every Yatri is identified with the help of these books. The Pandas of Devprayag spend 6 months of a year at Badrinath, 2-3 months in Devprayag, and the rest in their own regions. It is quite hard for a Panda and his family as He spends very less time with the family. Many peoples say that Pandagiri is a very normal and less prestigious occupation. But as it belongs to their God Almighty and this is their patrimonial occupation, it automatically becomes more prestigious rather than the other occupations. The cuisines of Devprayag are also rich and famous as Devprayag. Dishes like Singori and Bal Mithai keep an important place in Devprayagi's heart. Singori, traditionally made with khoya wrapped in form of a cone with Maalu leaves. The khoya absorbs the smell of Maalu leaves. On the other hand, Bal Mithai is a brown chocolate-like fudge, made with roasted khoya, coated with white sugar balls. Devprayag is a small town situated in Tehri Garhwal district in the state of Uttarakhand. Apart from that some of its area comes under Pauri Garhwal District. It is also a Nagar Panchayat and a division of Panch Prayag. Devprayag is the last prayag of River Alaknanda. Devprayag is located on the Rishikesh-Badrinath highway. Geography The Alaknanda rises at the confluence and feet of the Satopanth and Bhagirath Kharak glacier in Uttarakhand near the border with Tibet. The headwaters of the Bhagirathi are formed at Gaumukh, at the foot of the Gangotri glacier and Khatling glaciers in the Garhwal Himalaya. These two sacred rivers join to form the Ganges (Ganga) in Devprayag. Devprayag is 70 km from Rishikesh. Devprayag has an average elevation of 830 metres (2,723 feet). Demographics Confluence of the Alaknanda (left) and Bhagirathi (right) Rivers to form the Ganga at Devprayag India census, Devprayag had a population of 2144. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Devprayag has an average literacy rate of 77%, higher than the national average of 74.5%; male literacy is 82% and, female literacy is 72%. In Devprayag, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age. The town is the seat of the pandas of the Badrinath Dham. In popular culture Devprayag has been featured prominently in the film Kisna: The Warrior Poet.

However, Rishikesh is a small railway station not connected by fast trains. Haridwar railway junction, 24 km farther from Rishikesh, has train connections to most of the major cities in India and is, therefore, the railhead for Devprayag. =Road= Devprayag lies on national highway NH58 that connects Delhi with Badrinath and Mana Pass in Uttarakhand near Indo-Tibet border. Therefore, all the buses and vehicles that carry pilgrims from New Delhi to Badrinath via Haridwar and Rishikesh in pilgrim season of summer months pass through Devprayag on the way to Joshimath and further north. Rishikesh is the major starting point for road journey to Devprayag and regular buses operate from Rishikesh bus station to Devprayag.

Projective objects in abelian categories are used in homological algebra. The dual notion of a projective object is that of an injective object. Definition An object P in a category \\\\mathcal{C} is projective if for any epimorphism e:E\\\\twoheadrightarrow X and morphism f:P\\\\to X, there is a morphism \\\\overline{f}:P\\\\to E such that e\\\\circ \\\\overline{f}=f, i.e. the following diagram commutes: 150px That is, every morphism P\\\\to X factors through every epimorphism E\\\\twoheadrightarrow X. If C is locally small, i.e., in particular \\\\operatorname{Hom}_C(P, X) is a set for any object X in C, this definition is equivalent to the condition that the hom functor (also known as corepresentable functor) : \\\\operatorname{Hom}(P,-)\\\\colon\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{Set} preserves epimorphisms. =Projective objects in abelian categories= If the category C is an abelian category such as, for example, the category of abelian groups, then P is projective if and only if : \\\\operatorname{Hom}(P,-)\\\\colon\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{Ab} is an exact functor, where Ab is the category of abelian groups. An abelian category \\\\mathcal{A} is said to have enough projectives if, for every object A of \\\\mathcal{A}, there is a projective object P of \\\\mathcal{A} and an epimorphism from P to A or, equivalently, a short exact sequence :0 \\\\to K \\\\to P \\\\longrightarrow A \\\\longrightarrow 0. The purpose of this definition is to ensure that any object A admits a projective resolution, i.e., a (long) exact sequence :\\\\dots P_2 \\\\to P_1 \\\\to P_0 \\\\to A \\\\to 0 where the objects P_0, P_1, \\\\dots are projective. =Projectivity with respect to restricted classes= discusses the notion of projective (and dually injective) objects relative to a so-called bicategory, which consists of a pair of subcategories of \\"injections\\" and \\"surjections\\" in the given category C. These subcategories are subject to certain formal properties including the requirement that any surjection is an epimorphism. A projective object (relative to the fixed class of surjections) is then an object P so that Hom(P, ‚àí) turns the fixed class of surjections (as opposed to all epimorphisms) into surjections of sets (in the usual sense). Properties * The coproduct of two projective objects is projective. * The retract of a projective object is projective. Examples The statement that all sets are projective is equivalent to the axiom of choice. The projective objects in the category of abelian groups are the free abelian groups. Let R be a ring with identity. Consider the (abelian) category R-Mod of left R-modules. The projective objects in R-Mod are precisely the projective left R-modules. Consequently, R is itself a projective object in R-Mod. Dually, the injective objects in R-Mod are exactly the injective left R-modules. The category of left (right) R-modules also has enough projectives. This is true since, for every left (right) R-module M, we can take F to be the free (and hence projective) R-module generated by a generating set X for M (we can in fact take X to be M). Then the canonical projection \\\\pi\\\\colon F\\\\to M is the required surjection. The projective objects in the category of compact Hausdorff spaces are precisely the extremally disconnected spaces. This result is due to , with a simplified proof given by . In the category of Banach spaces and contractions (i.e., functionals whose norm is at most 1), the epimorphisms are precisely the maps with dense image. shows that the zero space is the only projective object in this category. There are non-trivial spaces, though, which are projective with respect to the class of surjective contractions. In the category of normed vector spaces with contractions (and surjective maps as \\"surjections\\"), the projective objects are precisely the l^1-spaces. :l^1(S) = \\\\\\\\{(x_s)_{s \\\\in S}, \\\\sum_{s \\\\in S} x_s < \\\\infty \\\\\\\\}.

Paramsant Dr. Chaturbhuj Sahay Ji established RSM in the year 1930 in Etah in Uttar Pradesh, India, naming it after his Guru, Lala Ji Maharaj, Paramsant Mahatma Shri Ram Chandra Ji. At the behest of his Guru, he openly laid out the secrets of methods of spiritual evolution kept closely guarded by the Saints since time immemorial. The main methodology is transfer of Soul Power. Breaking away from the centuries-old norm, He openly propagated the teachings of his Guru to all, and these methods and principles are applicable to and adaptable by people of any and all religions. Love is the objective of all Spiritual Methods. In this school 'Love' is mingled in all its methods. The central focus is on the Spiritual Master, who is looked upon as a father/ mother figure by all and who by Soul -Power uplifts the aspirants and makes them experience the higher stages of spirituality without aspirants having to make effort for it on their own. Periodic dosage of this transfer of power brings about an altered state within an aspirant. The mind has to be centered before higher states can be experienced; therefore, this school has evolved its own system of meditation, designed not only to bring the aspirants up to the level of receiving and experiencing the Soul Power (the goal of spiritual evolution and the main objective of every religion) but also to make the higher states flow automatically one after the other and even thereafter to keep the aspirant on track. This is probably the only school of its kind, where the method of transfer of Soul Power has evolved to such an extent that power is transferred not only on one to one basis but from one to many. At the tri-monthly meets known as 'Bhandara', organized by this Satsang, thousands of aspirants receive this power at the same time. Overtly, all are seen only to practice meditation, but each one notices and experiences the altered state upon leaving the Bhandara. This system of Sadhana/Satsang is a synthesis between action Karma (duty), Upasana (devotion) and Gyan (knowledge). Aspirants are required to keep in touch with the Master and to meet with the Master at the least once in every three months and to do Dhyan (meditate) every morning and evening for 15‚Äì20 minutes when not in company of the Master till they achieve the desired goal.

Spearman (December 17, 1824 - May 31, 1911) was a 19th-century American iron manufacturer, foremost among the iron manufacturers of his era, and for many years identified with the banking interests of Sharon, Pennsylvania. Early life He was born in Mc Kee‚Äôs Gap, Blair County, Pennsylvania. His parents were Francis and Elizabeth (Ambrose) Spearman. His father was born in Kent county, Maryland, of English origin. His mother was born near McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania. They came to Mercer, Pennsylvania in 1852, where the father died. The mother died at Middlesex and was buried in Mercer. By occupation, the father was a miller. This couple reared a family of eight children, of whom two were sons and six were daughters. Very early in life Spearman was thrown on his own resources. At the age of fourteen he became a clerk in the mercantile establishment of David Puterbaugh, of Woodbury, Bedford County, Pennsylvania. Here he remained for three years, and then accepted employment in 1841 with Dr. Peter Shoenberger, a prominent manufacturer of iron in those days, at the Rebecca and other furnaces, and Maria forges, in Blair county, Pennsylvania. Here Spearman gained his first practical experience in the manufacture of iron, and he spent six years there. Education His early opportunities for education were very limited, and confined to two terms in the early-day common schools. Despite this, by reason of his wide experience of business and by mingling with men of letters and affairs generally, as well as by observation, by reading books and newspapers, he gained an excellent general education. Iron industry executive In January, 1847, Spearman took charge of the business management of the Sharon furnace, which was operated at that time by Shoenberger, Agnew & Co. He held this position for a period of six years. In 1853 he purchased the Mazeppa furnace, near Mercer, which he operated until 1859, when he accepted the position of manager of the Sharpsville furnace, where he stayed for three years. In 1862 he became manager of the iron interests of James Wood & Sons, at Wheatland, and the following year took, an interest as a partner in the business, renamed as James Wood, Sons & Co. This association continued until August, 1870. Spearman moved to Sharon where, in 1872, he organized the Spearman Iron Company and built the Spearman furnaces at Sharpsville, and became general manager. This was a partnership concern up until 1895, when it was incorporated, and in 1901 the property was sold. Spearman retired from the iron industry, in which he had spent half a century. In 1868 he was prominent in the organization of the First National Bank of Sharon. The first president was George Prather, who died in the autumn of 1871. He was succeeded by Spearman as president of the bank in January, 1872. Marriage and family On March 12, 1851, John Spearman married Cordelia Breed, a daughter of Jabish Breed, of Sharon. Five children were born of this union: Celesta, who married David Adams, Eva, who remained at home, Chloe, wife of W. D. McKeefrey, Francis, who died in 1896, and Benjamin, who resided at Grove City, Pennsylvania. Politically, Mr. Spearman voted the Republican ticket. Public recognition Spearman had a long and successful business career and saw many changes in the production of iron. He had a reputation as a reliable man, a good citizen and an exemplar for younger men. In Masonic circles he was an advanced Mason and member of the Knights Templar degree. He was one of the charter members of Sharon Lodge No. 347, Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He lived to be one of the oldest residents of Mercer County, Pennsylvania, and among the best and most universally known men of the county. He died at his home at Sharon on May 31, 1911.Death of John J.

Peter Botsman who had previously been the Executive Director of the Evatt Foundation was the inaugural Director. Botsman left Brisbane in 2001 to run the Whitlam Institute at the University of Western Sydney. The Brisbane Institute was very active in its first two years holding seminars, breakfast and lunch discussions and weekly lectures. Notable speakers included Noel Pearson, Derek Shearer, Peter Beattie, Anna Bligh, Justice Michael Kirby, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws and the painter Jeffrey Smart. The Institute specialised in social, political, economic and cultural issues. In 2004-05 it had a particular emphasis on the regional planning issues confronting South East Queensland (SEQ). In addition to the regular functions, the Brisbane Institute also curated exhibitions, including 'The Two Hundred Kilometre City' and 'Defending the North: Queensland in the Pacific War'. The Brisbane Institute was funded by the University of Queensland, the Brisbane City Council, the Queensland State Government and a number of companies. The Institute ran an e-zine on its website called The Brisbane Line - a somewhat cheeky title alluding to the widespread fear and belief in Queensland that in the event of an invasion of Queensland by the Japanese in the Pacific War, that the rest of Australia through the Federal government would abandon all of Queensland to the north of Brisbane (the theoretical 'Brisbane Line'.) The Brisbane Institute received a mention in Mark Latham's The Latham Diaries (Melbourne University Press 2005), on page 109.

Development The Go 244 was the powered version of the Gotha Go 242 military glider transport. Studies for powered versions of the Go 242 began early in the design of the glider, with one early proposal being for modification to allow a single Argus As 10C engine to be temporarily attached to the nose of the glider to allow recovery back to base after use. This idea was rejected, but the alternative of a permanently powered twin-engined version was taken forward.Air International December 1989, p. 291.

Life and career Crater Lake, oil on canvas, 1919 Arthur Wesley Dow: View of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, 1919 Dow went to Paris for his early art education, studying at the Acad√©mie Julian under the supervision of the academic artists, Gustave Boulanger and Jules Joseph Lefebvre, between 1880 and 1888. He accepted commissions for posters and other commercial work. In 1895, he designed the poster to advertise the Journal of Modern Art and in 1896, he designed the poster for an exhibition of Japanese prints.Waller, S. (ed.), Foreign Artists and Communities in Modern Paris, 1870-1914: Strangers in Paradise, Routledge, 2017, p. 119 After his return to the United States, over the course of his career Dow taught at three major American arts training institutions, beginning with the Pratt Institute from 1896 to 1903. He also taught at the New York Art Students League from 1898 to 1903.Columbia University Teachers College Announcements, 1906-07:13; In 1900, Dow founded and served as the director of the Ipswich Summer School of Art in Ipswich, Massachusetts. From 1904 to 1922, he was a professor of fine arts at Columbia University Teachers College. Ideas on teaching art His ideas were quite revolutionary for the period; Dow taught that rather than copying nature, individuals should create art through elements of the composition, such as line, mass and color. He wanted leaders of the public to see art is a living force for all in everyday life, not as a sort of traditional ornament for the few. Dow suggested that the American lack of interest in art would improve if art was presented as a means of self-expression. He wanted people to be able to include personal experience in creating art. His ideas on art were published in his 1899 book Composition: A Series of Exercises in Art Structure for the Use of Students and Teachers. The following extracts are from the prefatory chapter \\"Beginnings\\" to the second edition of this book (1912): > Composition ... expresses the idea upon which the method here presented is > founded - the \\"putting together\\" of lines, masses and colors to make a > harmony. ... Composition, building up of harmony, is the fundamental process > in all the fine arts. ... A natural method is of exercises in progressive > order, first building up very simple harmonies ... Such a method of study > includes all kinds of drawing, design and painting. It offers a means of > training for the creative artist, the teacher or one who studies art for the > sake of culture.

Fenollosa. After detailing some of Fenollosa's attributes and history, he continues: > He at once gave me cordial support in my quest, for he also felt the > inadequacy of modern art teaching.

Martin, two of the Overbeck Sisters, Delle Miller, among others. Dow had influence at the Byrdcliffe Colony. Biography Portrait of students of Acad√©mie Julian, France, 1886. (Dow is depicted in center) The significance of Arthur Wesley Dow as an artist and teacher is becoming increasingly apparent. A champion of fine craftsmanship in a wide variety of art media, Dow was a leading figure in the Arts and Crafts revival that became prominent in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He advocated principles of pure design and promoted the creation of handmade rather than machine made objects. Dow also played an important role in American art as his work bridged the gap between Eastern and Western art. Applying principles of Oriental design to depictions of commonplace locales, Dow created works that were ahead of their time, anticipating the East/West synthesis that would be sought by modernist artists as the twentieth century progressed. Born in Ipswich, Massachusetts into an old, established New England family, Dow received his first art training in 1880 from Anna K. Freeland of Worcester, Massachusetts. The following year, Dow continued his studies in Boston with James M. Stone, a former student of Frank Duveneck and Gustave Bouguereau. In October 1884, Dow followed the path of many native painters of his era, and departed for Paris. In the French capital, he enrolled at the Acad√©mie Julian where his instructors were Gustave Boulanger and Jules-Joseph Lefebvre. Among his fellow students were John Henry Twachtman, Willard Metcalf, and Edmund Tarbell. While abroad, Dow spent his summers in Pont Aven, Brittany, in the company of the Americans, Benjamin Harrison, Arthur Hoeber and Charles Lazar. Dow returned to America in 1887. A year later, the first solo exhibition of his work was held at the J. Eastman Chase Gallery in Boston. After spending another summer in Pont-Aven, Dow settled in Ipswich in 1889 and began to hold private art classes. Soon, however, he moved to Boston, where he became interested in Egyptian and Aztec artifacts, which he saw at the Boston Public Library and the Museum of Fine Arts. Arthur Wesley Dow, The Clam House, woodblock print, circa 1892 At the same time, he began to study the prints of the Japanese artist, Hokusai. He sought out the curator of Japanese art at the Museum, Ernest Fenollosa, who shared his view that art should be both pictorial and decorative and introduced him to the other masters of Sumi ink painting and woodblock techniques. Soon after meeting Fenellosa, Dow developed a method for making woodcuts that reflected his study of Japanese techniques. He found the subjects for his prints mainly on Boston's North Shore, which he felt were well suited to the Japanese-inspired appreciation of nature that he sought to express. The Long Road--Argilla Road, Ipswich, 1898, Brooklyn Museum In 1893, Dow was appointed assistant curator of the Japanese collection at the Museum of Fine Arts under Fenellosa. Two years later, he gave a lecture outlining his ideas on Japanese art, which became the basis for his popular teaching manual, entitled \\"Composition,\\" which was published in 1899. As this text was used by public schools, it served to disseminate Dow's ideas broadly. Dow later wrote additional books on design including \\"Theory and Practice of Teaching Art and Constructive Art Teaching.\\" Dow also had an active teaching career. He taught first at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, then at the Art Students League in New York and, finally, at Columbia University's Teachers College. In his teaching, Dow emphasized abstract concepts of line, notan and color in order to arrive at a synthesis of eastern and western thought. His famous pupils, Max Weber and Georgia O'Keeffe, carried his methods even further into abstraction. One of his most influential pupils, the respected educator and printmaker Pedro Joseph de Lemos, adapted and widely disseminated Dow's theories in dozens of theoretical and instructional publications (1918-1950) for art schools. After 1900, Dow maintained a studio in his native Ipswich and conducted summer classes there. The nearby marshes and the area of Bayberry Hill were frequent subjects of his landscapes. His work in print mediums took up most of his time during the first decade of the century but, when he returned to oils in 1907, he began to experiment with a brighter palette and more expressive brushwork. Dow died in New York on December 13, 1922. His work is represented in the Amon-Carter Museum, Fort Worth, Texas; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Wadsworth Athenaeum, Hartford, Connecticut; Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York; the San Diego Museum of Art; the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco; Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, Boston; the National Museum of American Art, Washington, D.C.; Columbia University, New York; Ipswich Historical Society; The Two Red Roses Foundation/ Museum of the American Arts and Crafts Movement; the Ipswich Public Schools and many other public and private collection‚ÄîSpanierman Galleries.

Radioland Murders is set in the 1939 atmosphere of old-time radio and pays homage to the screwball comedy films of the 1930s. The film tells the story of writer Roger Henderson trying to settle relationship issues with his wife while dealing with a whodunit murder mystery in a radio station. The film stars an ensemble cast, including Brian Benben, Mary Stuart Masterson, Scott Michael Campbell, Michael Lerner and Ned Beatty. Radioland Murders also features numerous small roles and cameo appearances, including Michael McKean, Bobcat Goldthwait, Jeffrey Tambor, Christopher Lloyd, George Burns (in his final film appearance), Billy Barty and Rosemary Clooney. George Lucas began development for the film in the 1970s, originally attached as director for Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz's script. Universal Pictures commenced pre-production and both Steve Martin and Cindy Williams had already been approached for the two leads before Radioland Murders languished in development hell for over 20 years. In 1993, Lucas told Universal that advances in computer-generated imagery from Industrial Light & Magic (owned by Lucasfilm), particularly in digital mattes, would help bring Radioland Murders in for a relatively low budget of about $10 million, which eventually rose to $15 million. Mel Smith was hired to direct and filming lasted from October to December 1993. Radioland Murders was released on October 21, 1994, to negative reviews from critics and bombed at the box office, only grossing $1.37 million in the U.S. Plot In 1939, a new radio network based at station WBN in Chicago, Illinois, begins its inaugural night. The station's owner, General Walt Whalen, depends on his employees to impress main sponsor Bernie King. This includes writer Roger Henderson, assistant director Penny Henderson (Roger's wife, seeking divorce), page boy Billy Budget, engineer Max Applewhite, conductor Rick Rochester, announcer Dexter Morris, director Walt Whalen, Jr. and stage manager Herman Katzenback. After King commissions rewrites on the radio scripts, the WBN writers get angry, adding to the fact that they have not been paid in weeks. When Ruffles Reedy, a trumpet player, falls dead from rat poisoning, a series of events ensue. Director Walt Jr. is hanged (the mysterious killer makes it look like a suicide), and his father, the General, has the Chicago Police Department (CPD) get involved to solve the murder mysteries as the nightly radio performance continues. Herman Katzenback is then killed after attempting to fix the main stage when the machinery malfunctions. Penny is appointed both stage manager and director due to Walt Jr. and Katzenback's deaths. Writer Roger Henderson tries to solve the killings, much to the annoyance of the police, led by Lieutenant Cross. Because Roger unfortunately appears at every scene of crime just as the murders take place, he is ruled as the prime suspect. Roger and Billy Budget then theorize that announcer Dexter Morris is the next to die. Dexter ignores their warning and is killed by electrocution. By going through private documents in WBN's file room, Roger finds that the victims all previously worked together at a radio station in Peoria, Illinois, which he then correlates into a secretive FCC scandal. King (laughing gas) and General Whalen (falls down an elevator shaft) are the next to die after Roger's warning, causing even more suspicion from the police. After escaping from custody, Roger uses Billy to communicate and send scripts to Penny. When rewriting one of the programs, Gork: Son of Fire, Roger attempts to write the script with self-referential events, proving to everyone that the mysterious killer is actually sound engineer Max Applewhite. Max explains that his killings were a revenge scheme that dealt with stock holders and patents, specifically detailing his invention of television, which other scientists have copied. Roger and Penny are taken by Max atop the radio tower at gunpoint. Max is eventually killed when a biplane shows up and guns him down. Impressed by the nightly performance, the sponsors decide to fund WBN. Roger and Penny reconcile their complex relationship and decide not to divorce. Cast *Brian Benben as Roger Henderson: Ecstatic writer of WBN and husband to Penny. Much to the consternation of the police force, Roger solves the murder mystery. *Mary Stuart Masterson as Penny Henderson: Stressed WBN secretary who is promoted to both director and stage manager after the deaths of Walt Jr. and Herman Katzenback.

Production =Development= The genesis of Radioland Murders came from executive producer/co-writer George Lucas's obsession with old-time radio. Lucas conceived the storyline of the film during the writing phase of American Graffiti, viewing it as a homage to the various Abbott and Costello films, primarily Who Done It (1942), in which Abbott and Costello star as two soda jerks solving a murder in a radio station. Radioland Murders also shares some inspiration from The Big Clock (1948). When Universal Pictures accepted American Graffiti in 1972, Lucas also allowed the studio first-look deals for both Radioland Murders and an untitled science fiction film (which eventually became the basis for Star Wars). Lucas eventually negotiated a deal to produce Radioland Murders for Universal shortly after the successful release of American Graffiti in late 1973. Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz prepared a rough draft based on Lucas's 1974 film treatment, and Universal was confident enough to announce pre-production soon after. Lucas was set to direct with Gary Kurtz producing. In the original Huyck/Katz script, Roger and Penny were not a married couple seeking divorce, but were boyfriend and girlfriend with a love- hate relationship. Their script also included the controversy over the invention of radio. In July 1978, Lucas revealed that Radioland Murders was still in development, and that both Steve Martin and Cindy Williams were approached for the two leads. The script was being rewritten and the planned start date was early 1979. However, throughout the 1970s to early 1990s, Radioland Murders remained in development hell. Between this time, Lucas commissioned Theodore J. Flicker to perform a rewrite. In early 1993 Lucas told Universal that advances in computer-generated imagery from Industrial Light & Magic (owned by Lucasfilm), particularly in digital mattes, would help bring Radioland Murders in for a relatively low budget of about $10 million, which eventually rose to $15 million. =Pre-production= Universal agreed to greenlight Radioland Murders if Lucas would \\"update\\" the script. The Huyck/Katz script contained parodies of old-time radio that the general public in the 1970s would likely acknowledge. Universal reasoned that the script would have to be modified in an attempt to accustom audiences from the MTV Generation. Based on Ron Howard's recommendation, Lucas hired Jeff Reno and Ron Osborn (known for their work on Moonlighting) to \\"update\\" the screenplay.Baxter, pp. 380-382 The shooting script was prepared by Lucas, who combined his favorite elements of the Reno/Osborn draft with the original Huyck/Katz script from the 1970s. Lucas then hired Mel Smith to direct, who recommended Brian Benben for the lead role. Lucas specifically chose Smith because he believed the British comedian/filmmaker could handle Radioland Murders form of slapstick comedy and dark humor. Universal was adamant that the ensemble cast be filled with then-popular TV stars of the early 1990s. Christopher Lloyd agreed to make a small appearance as the eccentric sound designer Zoltan on the agreement that all of his scenes were shot in one day. =Filming= Principal photography for Radioland Murders began on October 28, 1993 at Carolco Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. Brief filming also took place at Hollywood Center Studios. Production designer Gavin Bocquet (Star Wars prequels, Stardust) disguised the film's limited rooms in a beehivelike structure. Larger areas, notably the exterior of the building and the transmission tower on the roof, were created or augmented with digital mattes added by visual effects supervisor Scott Squires (The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace) at Industrial Light & Magic. Following a break, in which Lucas, director Mel Smith and editor Paul Trejo reviewed the footage using the new digital Avid Technology editing system (the successor to EditDroid), the cast and crew were reassembled for a further two weeks of filming.Hearn, pp. 180-182 Principal photography for Radioland Murders ended on December 23, 1993. Release To market Radioland Murders, Universal attached a film trailer to The Flintstones in May 1994. The studio believed both films would specifically appeal to the Baby Boom Generation. Radioland Murders was originally set to be theatrically released in September 1994 before it was pushed back. The film was released in the United States on October 21, 1994 in 844 theaters, only grossing $1.37 million. Ultimately the film bombed at the box office because it did not recoup its $15 million budget. It ranks among the top ten widely released films for having the biggest second weekend drop at the box office, dropping 78.5% from $835,570 to $179,315. =Critical reception= Radioland Murders received negative reviews with Rotten Tomatoes calculated a 24% approval rating based on 17 reviews collected. Roger Ebert criticized the film for containing too much slapstick comedy instead of subtle humor. Although he praised the art direction and visual effects, Ebert believed \\"the movie just doesn't work. It's all action and no character, all situation and no comedy. The slapstick starts so soon and lasts so long that we don't have an opportunity to meet or care about the characters in a way that would make their actions funny.\\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/radioland-murders-1994 Richard Schickel, writing in Time magazine gave a mixed review, mainly criticizing the film for its fast pacing. Caryn James of The New York Times dismissed the film for trying too hard to pay homage to screwball comedy films of the 1930s. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a mixed reaction, feeling the filmmakers failed in attempting to woo audiences with nostalgia. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli called the film a \\"horrible concoction synthesizing elements of The Hudsucker Proxy and Brain Donors, and setting them in the world of David Lynch's On the Air. This film has more gags in it than anything this side of a Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker production, too few of which work.\\" =Year-end lists= * 1st worst ‚Äì Michael Mills, The Palm Beach Post * 1st worst ‚Äì Stephen Hunter, The Baltimore Sun * 4th worst ‚Äì Desson Howe, The Washington Post * Top 10 worst (listed alphabetically, not ranked) ‚Äì William Arnold, Seattle Post-Intelligencer * Top 10 worst (listed alphabetically, not ranked) ‚Äì Mike Mayo, The Roanoke Times =Home media= The first Region 1 DVD release came in March 1998 by Image Entertainment.

It stars Bonnie Bedelia as Shirley Muldowney and Beau Bridges as drag racing driver Connie Kalitta. The film garnered two award nominations: Bedelia for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama, and William Theiss for an Oscar for Best Costume Design. Plot summary In 1956 Schenectady, New York, waitress Shirley Roque (Bonnie Bedelia) marries auto mechanic Jack Muldowney (Leo Rossi) over the mild objections of her singer father Tex (Hoyt Axton), who wants her to be able to take care of herself, rather than having to rely on a husband. Jack buys a gas station, Shirley becomes a housewife, and they have a son. For fun, Jack races his sports car against others on deserted stretches of road late at night. One time, Shirley talks him into letting her drive. She wins and continues winning. A chance encounter with professional driver \\"Big Daddy\\" Don Garlits (Bill McKinney) gives her the idea to look for sponsorship from one of the major car manufacturers, despite her husband's skepticism. This being the 1950s, a pretty housewife is not taken seriously, especially since there are no women professional drivers. But when she returns home, Jack tells her that he can build her a dragster. In 1966, she is ready. She still needs to get three signatures before she can get her National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) license, nearly impossible in the macho racing world. Finally, Garlits (seeing an opportunity to broaden the popularity of the sport) signs, followed by funny car driver Connie Kalitta (Beau Bridges), who has his own reasons; Connie talks a reluctant third driver into going along. In her first attempt to qualify for a race, she sets a track record. Later, during a dinner with their respective spouses, Connie gets her alone, makes a pass at her, and she slaps him in the face. Shirley becomes successful, racing on weekends, but when Connie decides to move up to Top Fuel dragsters, she wants to buy his funny car and compete year round. This exhausts Jack's tolerance for Shirley's racing activity, as he feels neglected, and they separate. Connie and Shirley become involved romantically, despite his continual philandering. In a 1973 race, Shirley's funny car is destroyed and she is seriously burned. When Connie is suspended indefinitely by the NHRA for fighting on her behalf, she tells him that she is going to Top Fuel. He becomes her crew chief. She wins her first NHRA national event in 1976, then the World Championship in 1977. Finally, tired of Connie's womanizing, she drops him from her team. Angry, he successfully pursues reinstatement by the NHRA. Shirley, with little sponsorship and an inexperienced crew, has two lean years, but she rebounds in 1980. She races against Connie in that year's NHRA championship final. She is victorious, and they reconcile. Jack, her ex- husband (who had watched the victory on TV), gives her a private cheer. Cast *Bonnie Bedelia as Shirley Muldowney *Beau Bridges as Connie Kalitta *Leo Rossi as Jack Muldowney *Hoyt Axton as Tex Roque *Bill McKinney as \\"Big Daddy\\" Don Garlits *Anthony Edwards as John Muldowney, Shirley and Jack's son *Tiffany Brissette as Little Shirley The film also marked the film debut of character actor Leonard Termo, who had a small role as Good Joe. Reception Rolling Stones Michael Sragow gave Heart Like a Wheel a mostly positive review, deeming it \\"flawed but energetic\\". He remarked that compared to other film biographies, the storyline and depiction of the core subject matter (drag racing) are lacking in drama and clarity, but in part because of that, are much more true to life. For this reason, he felt that drag racing enthusiasts would get more out of the film than those unfamiliar with the sport. He praised the acting as the movie's strongest point, particularly the performances by Bedelia and Bridges. =Muldowney's reaction= Muldowney would rather have had Jamie Lee Curtis play her; she called Bedelia \\"a snot\\", and stated, \\"When she was promoting the movie on TV shows, she would tell interviewers she didn't even like racing. She got out of race car like she was getting up from the dinner table.\\" Although Muldowney acted as creative consultant on the production, she has mixed feelings about the film itself, stating, \\"No, the movie did not capture my life very well at all, but more importantly, I thought the movie was very, very good for the sport.\\" Accolades The film was nominated for the American Film Institute's 2008 AFI's 10 Top 10 list in the sports film category.

A plaintiff (or other person bringing a civil action, such as a petitioner) drops his or her suit, under certain circumstances that do not prevent another action being brought later on the same facts. United States In the United States, a voluntary nonsuit is a motion taken by the plaintiff to release one or more of the defendants from liability. An example would be a plaintiff suing a physician and a hospital for damages resulting from surgical complications. If the plaintiff settles with the physician, the plaintiff would nonsuit the physician (removing him/her from the suit) but maintain action against the hospital and the suit would continue. If the plaintiff later settles with the hospital before trial, the resulting nonsuit would end the case as all defendants have been released. A nonsuit is a right of the plaintiff, but it may be prevented if the defendant has pleaded for affirmative relief. The law in the United States was established as early as 1828 when the Supreme Court ruled: A compulsory nonsuit is a decision by a court that a case cannot proceed to trial, either on substantive or procedural grounds. Depending on which grounds the nonsuit is entered, the plaintiff may or may not be able to file his case again. In the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the term does not appear, but a dismissal under Rules 12 and 41 has a similar effect. Often, the term \\"nonsuit\\" will appear in older U.S. cases. The meaning of the term in most of these older cases is the same as described for the United Kingdom (see below). This is because most colonies, upon separation from England, still used English common law (as no U.S. or state- specific laws had yet been passed). In more modern parlance, this type of motion is known as a \\"motion of dismissal\\". A few code pleading states still use the term \\"nonsuit\\" to refer to an involuntary or compulsory nonsuit which is granted at the request of an opponent. For example, in California, a motion for nonsuit under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 581c \\"is a procedural device which allows a defendant to challenge the sufficiency of plaintiff's evidence to submit the case to the jury,\\" and it cannot be granted if the plaintiff's evidence would be sufficient to support a jury verdict in the plaintiff's favor.Campbell v. General Motors Corp., 32 Cal. 3d 112, 117-118, 184 Cal. Rptr. 891, 649 P.2d 224 (1982). =Virginia= In Virginia, which does not follow the Federal Rules, a nonsuit is known by that name. A nonsuit is simply an agreement by the plaintiff not to proceed in that suit against that defendant, and is not a bar to bringing a future action against the same defendant.E.g., Muse v. Farmers Bank, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 252 (1876); Coffman v. Russell, 18 Va. (4 Munf.) 207 (1814). There are restrictions on when a Virginia nonsuit may be taken, and only one nonsuit may be taken against a party on a cause of action as a matter of right.Va. Code ¬ß 8.01-380. Within the limitations, a plaintiff has an absolute right to one nonsuit.Nash v. Jewell, 227 Va. 230, 315 S.E.2d 825 (1984). A Virginia plaintiff who takes a nonsuit may bring a new action against the same defendant(s) on the same subject matter within six months, regardless of the operation of the Statute of Limitations.Va. Code ¬ß 8.01-229. The difference between a Federal Rule 41 dismissal and a Virginia nonsuit is more a matter of form than substance, although the Virginia statute does not require the consent of the defendant and can be taken at later stages in the proceeding.Scoggins v. Douglas, 760 F.2d 535 (4th Cir. 1985). A nonsuit is often taken by a plaintiff who anticipates a judgment or ruling that \\"imparts finality\\" against him, who wants to avoid the adverse judgment and preserve at least the possibility of prevailing on the merits of his case in the future.E.g., Newton v. Veney, 220 Va. 947, 265 S.E.2d 707 (1980). United Kingdom =England and Wales= In the common law courts (e.g. the Court of Common Pleas) a party to a civil action had a right of withdraw their claim/counterclaim by nonsuit up until verdict or judgment without prejudice to the launch of a fresh action.\\"From an examination of all these cases it seems possible to draw the following conclusions: (1) At any time up to verdict, if the plaintiff elected to be non-suited he was entitled to it as of right, and the court had no discretion to refuse‚Äîsee Robinson v. Lawrence ((1852) 7 Exch 123, 155 ER 883); Outhwaite v. Hudson ((1852) 7 Exch 380, 155 ER 995). (2) If before verdict the plaintiff refused to be non-suited, the position is not so clear ... (3) Once the evidence had been completed and the verdict of the jury taken‚Äîor, where there was no jury, once the judge had found the facts‚Äîit seems clear that the court had an unfettered discretion, if the verdict was against the plaintiff, either to enter a nonsuit or to give judgment for the defendant.\\" (See Clack v Arthurs Engineering Ltd [1959] 2 All ER 503 at 509, [1959] 2 QB 211 at 221, Willmer LJ quoting from A. L. Smith LJ's judgment in Fox v Star Newspaper Co Ltd in the Court of Appeal at [1898] 1 QB 636 at 637‚Äì638) There was an equivalent right in the Court of Chancery to dismiss one's own bill (as actions in that court were known as).'/Fox v Star Newspaper Co Ltd in the Court of Appeal at [1898] 1 QB 636 at 637 Chitty LJ (at 638, 639 When the courts were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875, provision was made for the procedure to governed by rules of court. The 1875 rules provided for non suiting but also made provision for setting aside a judgment of nonsuit. In 1883 the nonsuit provisions were repealed and replaced by discontinuance of an action. Thereafter it was subsequently ruled that nonsuiting ceased to exist in the High Court of Justice having been wholly displaced by the provisions relating to discontinuance.Fox v Star Newspaper Co Ltd in the Court of Appeal at [1898] 1 QB 636; Gilham v Browning and another [1998] 2 All ER 68 In the County Courts, the County Court rules continued to provide for nonsuiting until the Rules of the Supreme Court and the County Court Rules were repealed and replaced by the Civil Procedure Rules 1998, which only provided for discontinuance. This brought nonsuiting to an end in mainstream England and Wales (although one cannot comment for e.g. actions in the High Court of Chivalry).Gilham v Browning and another [1998] 2 All ER 68 =Northern Ireland= The present court rulesThe Rules of the Court of Judicature (NI) 1980 SR 1980/346; The County Court Rules (Northern Ireland) 1981 SR 1981/225 make no provision for nonsuiting and provide instead for discontinuance. One therefore presumes nonsuiting no longer exists in Northern Ireland, applying the same principles as in England and Wales. =Scotland= References Category:Common law legal terminology Category:Judicial legal terminology ","title":"Non-suit"},{"id":"3017474","text":"Nullisomic is a genetic condition involving the lack of both the normal chromosomal pairs for a species (2n-2).

The road currently extends from just north of the intersection of Southwest 137th Avenue and U.S. Highway 41 (US 41) in Tamiami, eastward past the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike (SR 821) and Miami International Airport, before intersecting I-95, becoming I-395 and ending at SR A1A in Miami at the west end of the MacArthur Causeway. The Dolphin Expressway is maintained and operated by the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority (MDX), while the I-395 section is maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). The Dolphin Expressway from the Palmetto Expressway to I-95 opened in 1969, with the I-395 section opening in 1971, the extension to the HEFT opening in 1974 and a second western extension opening in 2007. Route description Dolphin Expressway (SR 836) eastbound with downtown Miami in the distance The highway begins just north of the intersection of Southwest 137th Avenue (unsigned SR 825) and U.S. Highway 41 (SR 90) in Tamiami, built in 2007 and initially accessible only to motorists with SunPass transponders, passing through the first toll gantry. The expressway heads east towards the Homestead Extension of the Turnpike, and then passes through the second of four toll gantries. It then intersects with the Palmetto Expressway (SR 826) at the recently rebuilt Dolphin-Palmetto Interchange, and passes through the southern end of the Miami International Airport. With the failure of FDOT to build either the previously planned airport spur or the proposed LeJeune Road Expressway to give additional access to the airport, Miami-Dade County's sole complete east‚Äìwest throughway is now often congested, most commonly in the stretch between the Palmetto Expressway (SR 826) and LeJeune Road (SR 953). During this stretch, the expressway have interchanges with NW 72nd Avenue, a third toll gantry, NW 57th Avenue, and a partial with NW 45th Avenue before reaching LeJeune Road. East of the interchange with the airport at LeJeune Road, The expressway has interchanges with NW 37th Avenue and NW 27th Avenue (SR 9), and then reaches the fourth and final toll gantry just west of downtown. The highway has two more interchanges in the fringes of downtown with NW 17th Avenue and NW 12th Avenue before intersecting with I-95 at the Midtown Interchange and becoming a free road and unsigned as Interstate 395 goes into downtown Miami. Downtown Miami I-395 heads east as an elevated, six-lane expressway into downtown Miami. The feeder lanes from I-95 to eastbound I-395 make up a separate three lane ramp to the right of I-395, with the exit to US 1/US 41 being a left exit from the I-395 lanes and a right exit from the I-95 feeder lanes. The feeder lanes then merge into three lanes, heading east towards the MacArthur Causeway, with I-395 and SR 836 terminating just east of an entrance ramp with US 1 (SR 5)/US 41, and continuing as SR A1A. Tolls The Dolphin Expressway is an all-electronic toll road that only accepts tolls via SunPass transponders or billing by the toll-by-plate at double cost. The toll road does not accept cash. Toll gantries are located along the expressway and on interchange ramps, eliminating all \\"free movement\\" sections that existed in the past. As of November 15, 2014, the total toll for traffic traveling along the expressway from Northwest 137th Avenue to Interstate 95 is $2.40 for SunPass users, and $4.80 for Toll-by-Plate users. History Signage denoting the current western terminus of the Dolphin Expressway, right above an all electronic toll gantry Originally envisioned as the Twentieth Street Tollway in 1964 (with a spur to the airport along LeJeune Road), construction on the Fourteenth Street east‚Äìwest Expressway between the Palmetto Expressway and US 1 started in 1967 and was completed in 1969. Two years later, construction of the western extension to Florida's Turnpike commenced, and was finished in 1974. Also in 1974, the name of the tollway was changed to commemorate the success of the Miami Dolphins of the NFL, after back-to-back wins in the Super Bowl. The section of SR 836 signed as I-395 was supposed to open with the rest of the Dolphin Expressway in 1968, but was delayed due to a freeze at the federal level for road spending. The expressway opened on March 26, 1971. Initial plans for the Interstate 75 extension to Miami in 1968 would have had used the Dolphin Expressway as its final link to Interstate 95 (I-75 would have crossed the Everglades via the Tamiami Trail under this plan). However, these plans were abandoned in 1973 in favor of I-75's current route farther north. The fact that the Dolphin Expressway was not built to interstate standards was one of the factors in changing I-75's proposed route. Construction of a second westward extension of SR 836 started in 2004. This extension, westward to Northwest 137th Avenue near Northwest 12th Street, opened June 22, 2007, was initially accessible only to motorists with SunPass electronic toll-paying capability; there is no capacity for the collection of cash. The road has since opened to non SunPass users with the Toll by Plate system. Until July 1, 2007, the toll for eastbound automobiles was $1.25 ($1.00 for motorists with SunPass), paid at a toll booth between Northwest 22nd and Northwest 17th Avenues (toll is not collected from westbound traffic). In conjunction with the completion of the new three-mile- long extension west of the Turnpike, tolls of $1.00 (75 cents for motorists with SunPass) were collected from traffic in both directions west of SR 973 (Northwest 87th Avenue/Galloway Road). Although the new toll was originally stated to be only for the extension, motorists going to the Florida Turnpike or Northwest 107th Avenue also have to pay. On July 21, 2013, the eastbound toll plaza near I-95 ceased cash collection and became all electronic, with those paying with SunPass paying $1, and Toll by Plate users paying $2. On November 15, 2014, the Dolphin Expressway became an all electronic toll road, no longer collecting cash, and the only ways to pay are either by the SunPass transponders or billing by the toll-by-plate program, at double the cost of SunPass users. Toll gantries are located along the expressway and on interchanges to where there are no \\"free movement\\" sections of the expressway as existed previously. The move was first announced in 2010, and along with the nearby Airport Expressway, was the last of the MDX expressways to be converted to open road tolling. On May 24, 2010, construction began on the Port Miami Tunnel, a $1 billion project that connects the port to other major highway arteries, including I-395, with the tunnel opening on August 3, 2014. =Future= Short range plans include the construction of additional lanes to match the rebuilt, higher capacity Dolphin-Palmetto Interchange, with SR 826. A planned third extension (southward to Southwest 136th Street) is currently being considered, though may have been replaced with the widening of the rural surface road Krome Avenue to four lanes. The Dolphin Expressway will be home to two of the state's three diverging-diamond interchanges after the reconstruction of two exits at Northwest 27th Avenue and Northwest 57th Avenue. Long-term plans in the 2020s call for a double-decker span of SR 836 (from NW 17 Avenue, rising over the center of the existing SR 836 roadway, and touching down at I-395, east of the I-95 interchange), and a complete replacement of the I-395 sector (from I-95 to the MacArthur Causeway), with a new \\"signature\\" cable-stayed bridge extending across it and over Biscayne Boulevard. Community parks, art installations, and urban green spaces will be designed underneath the 1.4 mile stretch. The $802 million project is known as \\"Connecting Miami\\" and will be coordinated between the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) and the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority (MDX). Construction began in January 2019, with completion estimated for late 2023. Exit list Exits are unnumbered on the MDX-maintained section.

Jackson Street and 4th Avenue S. in the Pioneer Square neighborhood, the station opened on May 20, 1911. The Milwaukee Road discontinued passenger service to Union Station 50 years later, on May 22, 1961, and the Union Pacific followed suit on April 30, 1971. With no passenger rail service serving Seattle from Union Station, the building remained largely empty. An antique store filled the great hall for several years. After nearly 30 years of sitting idle, the station finally experienced an expansive renovation supported by Nitze-Stagen with financial backing from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The Union Station's renovation was the winner of the 2000 National Historic Preservation Award. The building has served as the headquarters of Sound Transit since 1999. Its grand hall is available to the public as a venue for weddings and other events.

Svoray infiltrated German Neo- Nazi groups, contributed to the arrest of Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, and has also been active in searching for treasure looted by the Nazis. Biography Yaron Svoray was born in Israel. His father, Yehuda Soberski, born in Germany, immigrated to Mandatory Palestine with his family in 1938. The rest of the Soberski family perished in the Holocaust. His mother, Rachel Stern, was born in Egypt and moved with her family to Romania when she was a child. Most of her relatives died in the Holocaust and she fled to Mandate Palestine with some of her family in 1943. Svoray served in the Paratroopers Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces, and later worked as a detective in the Israeli Central Police Command. He traveled to the USA where he earned his bachelor's and master's degree in media and communication, and worked as a journalist and a lecturer. Intelligence career In the early 1990s, he went undercover inside the German Neo Nazi organization. He convinced them that he was an Australian neo-Nazi named Ron Furey who wanted to join the German Neo Nazis. Svoray's investigation brought him into contact with key neo-Nazi leaders. Furthermore, there was evidence that the German groups had managed to forge links with similar groups in South America and the United States. Svoray's book In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow was later adapted into a 1995 HBO special, The Infiltrator, starring Oliver Platt as Svoray. While working undercover Svoray discovered that a Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke who participating in the massacre at the Ardeatine caves in Rome escaped to South America and lived there under an assumed name. The intelligence he gathered facilitated the capture and arrest of Priebke. In 2007, Svoray found the dumping ground for the destroyed remains of Jewish property plundered during Kristallnacht. The dump, situated in a forest in Brandenburg, is the size of several football fields and thought to contain an extensive range of personal and ceremonial items, although only a small number of items have been dug up. In 2013 Svoray and his team began a search for boxes full of gold dumped into the Stolpsee lake in Germany. This project is being filmed by National Geographic. Published works To the general public Svoray is probably best known for his hunt of Nazi era diamonds. Svoray‚Äôs search was documented on the History Channel‚Äôs special Blood from a Stone, which was based on the book, Blood from a Stone, written by Yaron Svoray and published by the Tor Books division of St. Martin‚Äôs Press. Svoray's next book was Gods of Death, published in 1997 by Simon & Schuster. The book is an account of Svoray's hunt for the source of and sense behind the snuff film which he witnessed while undercover inside the Neo Nazi movement. This time Svoray presented himself as a middleman first for buyers and then for dealers of snuff films, trying to fake his way into the highly secretive industry, at several points running foul of the Russian mob in Israel and various criminal organizations in the US and Southeast Asia.

It was produced about 872-883 in the scriptorium of the Abbey of St. Gall, Switzerland, under the direction of the scribe Folchardus, usually modernized as Folchard or Folchart. Folchardus is attested to being a monk at St. Gall from 849-854 and 898-899. Curiously, Folchardus is not mentioned in the Casus of Ekkehard IV, making his biography obscure and incomplete. He is recorded being a sub-deacon in 858, and a deacon no later than 860; he was elected prior in the Benedictine monasteries at Z√ºrichgau and Turgovia (869-878), and at the latest in 882 was elected the senior assistant or vicar of Abbot Hartmut. Folchardus penned, on folios 26-27, the following inscription: \\"Hunc praeceptoris Hartmoti iussa secutus/ Folchardus studuit rite patrare librum\\" (\\"Following the orders of Abbot Hartmut/ Folchart endeavoured to complete this book according to rules). Although Hartmoti (Hartmut) is referred to as preceptor, it really means abbot. Since he is cited as abbot it places the manuscript during his tenure of office 872-883. Portraits of the tonsured Folchardus, holding the Psalter and bowing towards the abbot (far left side of tympanum painting of King David receiving his harp) and Abbot Harmut prepared to receive the Psalter with open arms (far right side of tympanum painting of the Ark of the Covenant transported by an oxen drawn wagon) are each found on the extreme ends of the folio on either side of the centralized bust of Christ in the spandrel on the ‚ÄúDedication Page‚Äù on folio 12. He is also probably the artist of the Lindau Gospels in the Morgan Library, New York. The initial letter Q of Psalm 51 (52) is often cited as a masterpiece of late Carolingian illumination.

In philosophy, ethics is the attempt to offer a rational response to the question of how humans should best live. Aristotle regarded ethics and politics as two related but separate fields of study, since ethics examines the good of the individual, while politics examines the good of the City-State, which he considered to be the best type of community. Aristotle's writings have been read more or less continuously since ancient times,\\"Roman Aristotle,\\" in Philosophia Togata II: Plato and Aristotle at Rome, Oxford University Press (Oxford: 1997), pp. 1‚Äì69. and his ethical treatises in particular continue to influence philosophers working today. Aristotle emphasized the practical importance of developing excellence (virtue) of character (Greek ƒìthikƒì aretƒì), as the way to achieve what is finally more important, excellent conduct (Greek praxis). As Aristotle argues in Book II of the Nicomachean Ethics, the man who possesses character excellence will tend to do the right thing, at the right time, and in the right way. Bravery, and the correct regulation of one's bodily appetites, are examples of character excellence or virtue. So acting bravely and acting temperately are examples of excellent activities. The highest aims are living well, and eudaimonia ‚Äî a Greek word often translated as well-being, happiness or \\"human flourishing\\".Nicomachean Ethics, trans. T. H. Irwin, Introduction. Hackett Publishing Company (Indianapolis: 1999) xv. Like many ethicists, Aristotle regards excellent activity as pleasurable for the man of virtue. For example, Aristotle thinks that the man whose appetites are in the correct order actually takes pleasure in acting moderately. Aristotle emphasized that virtue is practical, and that the purpose of ethics is to become good, not merely to know. Aristotle also claims that the right course of action depends upon the details of a particular situation, rather than being generated merely by applying a law. The type of wisdom which is required for this is called \\"prudence\\" or \\"practical wisdom\\" (Greek phronesis), as opposed to the wisdom of a theoretical philosopher (Greek sophia). But despite the importance of practical decision making, in the final analysis the original Aristotelian and Socratic answer to the question of how best to live, at least for the best types of human, was, if possible, to live the life of philosophy.  Three ethical treatises  Three Aristotelian ethical works survive today which are considered to be either by Aristotle, or from relatively soon after: * Nicomachean Ethics, abbreviated as the NE or sometimes (from the Latin version of the name) as the EN. The NE is in 10 books, and is the most widely read of Aristotle's ethical treatises. * Eudemian Ethics, often abbreviated as the EE. * Magna Moralia, often abbreviated as the MM. The exact origins of these texts is unclear, although they were already considered the works of Aristotle in ancient times. Textual oddities suggest that they may not have been put in their current form by Aristotle himself. For example, Books IV‚ÄìVI of Eudemian Ethics also appear as Books V‚ÄìVII of Nicomachean Ethics. The authenticity of the Magna Moralia has been doubted,But for an argument that the Magna Moralia's philosophical content (if not the language) is authentically Aristotle's, see: John M. Cooper, \\"The Magna Moralia and Aristotle's Moral Philosophy,\\" in The American Journal of Philology 94.4 (Winter, 1973): pp. 327‚Äì49. whereas almost no modern scholar doubts that Aristotle wrote the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics himself, even if an editor also played some part in giving us those texts in their current forms. The Nicomachean Ethics has received the most scholarly attention, and is the most easily available to modern readers in many different translations and editions. Some critics consider the Eudemian Ethics to be \\"less mature,\\" while others, such as Kenny (1978),The Aristotelian Ethics: A Study of the Relationship between the Eudemian and Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle, (Oxford 1978). contend that the Eudemian Ethics is the more mature, and therefore later, work. Traditionally it was believed that the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics were either edited by or dedicated to Aristotle's son and pupil Nicomachus and his disciple Eudemus, respectively, although the works themselves do not explain the source of their names. On the other hand, Aristotle's father was also called Nicomachus. Aristotle's son was the next leader of Aristotle's school, the Lyceum, and in ancient times he was already associated with this work.Cicero mentioned him in De Finibus. A fourth treatise, Aristotle's Politics, is often regarded as the sequel to the Ethics, in part because Aristotle closes the Nicomachean Ethics by saying that his ethical inquiry has laid the groundwork for an inquiry into political questions (NE X.1181b6-23). Aristotle's Ethics also states that the good of the individual is subordinate to the good of the city-state, or polis. Fragments also survive from Aristotle's Protrepticus, another work which dealt with ethics.  Aristotle as a Socratic  Aristotle's ethics builds upon earlier Greek thought, particularly that of his teacher Plato and Plato's teacher, Socrates. While Socrates left no written works, and Plato wrote dialogues and a few letters, Aristotle wrote treatises in which he sets forth philosophical doctrines directly. According to Aristotle in his Metaphysics, Socrates was the first Greek philosopher to concentrate on ethics, although he apparently did not give it this name, as a philosophical inquiry concerning how people should best live. Aristotle dealt with this same question but giving it two names, \\"the political\\" (or Politics) and \\"the ethical\\" (Ethics), with Politics being the more important part. The original Socratic questioning on ethics started at least partly as a response to sophism, which was a popular style of education and speech at the time. Sophism emphasized rhetoric, and argument, and therefore often involved criticism of traditional Greek religion and flirtation with moral relativism. Aristotle's ethics, or study of character, is built around the premise that people should achieve an excellent character (a virtuous character, \\"ethikƒì aretƒì\\" in Greek) as a pre- condition for attaining happiness or well-being (eudaimonia). It is sometimes referred to in comparison to later ethical theories as a \\"character based ethics\\". Like Plato and Socrates he emphasized the importance of reason for human happiness, and that there were logical and natural reasons for humans to behave virtuously, and try to become virtuous. Aristotle's treatment of the subject is distinct in several ways from that found in Plato's Socratic dialogues. *Aristotle's presentation is obviously different from Plato's because he does not write in dialogues, but in treatises. Apart from this difference, Aristotle explicitly stated that his presentation was different from Plato's because he started from whatever could be agreed upon by well brought-up gentlemen, and not from any attempt to develop a general theory of what makes anything good. He explained that it was necessary not to aim at too much accuracy at the starting point of any discussion to do with controversial matters such as those concerning what is just or what is beautiful.NE Book I, EE Book I (From this starting point however, he built up to similar theoretical conclusions concerning the importance of intellectual virtue and a contemplative life.)NE end of Book VI and end of Book X. Also see Burger (2008). *Rather than discussing only four \\"cardinal virtues\\" of Plato (courage, temperance, justice, and prudence), all three of the ethical works start with courage and temperance as the two typical moral virtues which can be described as a mean, go on to discuss a whole range of minor virtues and vices which can be described as a mean, and only after that touch upon justice and the intellectual virtues. Aristotle places prudence (phronƒìsis, often translated as practical wisdom) amongst these intellectual virtues. (Nevertheless, like Plato he eventually says that all the highest forms of the moral virtues require each other, and all require intellectual virtue, and in effect that the happiest and most virtuous life is that of a philosopher.)Burger (2008) *Aristotle emphasizes throughout all his analyses of virtues that they aim at what is beautiful (kalos), effectively equating the good, at least for humans, with the beautiful (to kalon).Burger (2008); Sachs (2002) *Aristotle's analysis of ethics makes use of his metaphysical theory of potentiality and actuality. He defines happiness in terms of this theory as an actuality (energeia); the virtues which allow happiness (and enjoyment of the best and most constant pleasures) are dynamic-but-stable dispositions (hexeis) which are developed through habituation; and this pleasure in turn is another actuality that complements the actuality of happy living.NE Book X  Practical ethics  Aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not only a theoretical knowledge, but rather that a person must have \\"experience of the actions in life\\" and have been \\"brought up in fine habits\\" to become good (NE 1095a3 and b5). For a person to become virtuous, he can't simply study what virtue is, but must actually do virtuous things.  Aristotle's starting point  The Aristotelian Ethics all aim to begin with approximate but uncontroversial starting points. In the Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle says explicitly that one must begin with what is familiar to us, and \\"the that\\" or \\"the fact that\\" (NE I.1095b2-13). Ancient commentators agree that what Aristotle means here is that his treatise must rely upon practical, everyday knowledge of virtuous actions as the starting points of his inquiry, and that he is supposing that his readers have some kind of experience-based understanding of such actions, and that they value noble and just actions to at least some degree.See M.F. Burnyeat, \\"Aristotle on Learning to be Good,\\" in Essays on Aristotle's Ethics, ed. Rorty (1980) pp. 71‚Äì72. Elsewhere, Aristotle also seems to rely upon common conceptions of how the world works. In fact, some regard his ethical inquiries as using a method that relies upon popular opinion (his so-called \\"endoxic method\\" from the Grk. endoxa). There is some dispute, however, about exactly how such common conceptions fit into Aristotle's method in his ethical treatises,Martha Nussbaum, for example, has argued that Aristotle's so-called endoxic method, described at NE VII.1145b1 ff. is in fact Aristotle's general philosophical method. See Nussbaum, Fragility of Goodness (Cambridge: 1986/2001) pp. 240 ff. particularly since he also makes use of more formal arguments, especially the so-called \\"function argument,\\" which is described below. Aristotle describes popular accounts about what kind of life would be a happy one by classifying them into three most common types: a life dedicated to vulgar pleasure; a life dedicated to fame and honor; and a life dedicated to contemplation (NE I.1095b17-19). To reach his own conclusion about the best life, however, Aristotle tries to isolate the function of humans. The argument he develops here is accordingly widely known as \\"the function argument,\\" and is among the most-discussed arguments made by any ancient philosopher.As noted by Rachel Barney, \\"Aristotle's Argument for a Human Function,\\" in Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy 34 (Summer 2008) p. 3. He argues that while humans undergo nutrition and growth, so do other living things, and while humans are capable of perception, this is shared with animals (NE I.1098b22-1098a15). Thus neither of these characteristics is particular to humans. According to Aristotle, what remains and what is distinctively human is reason. Thus he concludes that the human function is some kind of excellent exercise of the intellect. And, since Aristotle thinks that practical wisdom rules over the character excellences, exercising such excellences is one way to exercise reason and thus fulfill the human function. One common objection to Aristotle's function argument is that it uses descriptive or factual premises to derive conclusions about what is good.As noted by Jennifer Whiting in an article that defends the argument. See Whiting, \\"Aristotle's Function Argument: A Defense\\" Ancient Philosophy 8, p. 35. Such arguments are often thought to run afoul of the is-ought gap.  Moral virtue  Moral virtue, or excellence of character, is the disposition (Grk hexis) to act excellently, which a person develops partly as a result of his upbringing, and partly as a result of his habit of action. Aristotle develops his analysis of character in Book II of the Nicomachean Ethics, where he makes this argument that character arises from habit‚Äîlikening ethical character to a skill that is acquired through practice, such as learning a musical instrument. In Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle argues that a person's character is voluntary, since it results from many individual actions which are under his voluntary control. Aristotle distinguishes the disposition to feel emotions of a certain kind from virtue and vice. But such emotional dispositions may also lie at a mean between two extremes, and these are also to some extent a result of up- bringing and habituation. Two examples of such dispositions would be modesty, or a tendency to feel shame, which Aristotle discusses in NE IV.9; and righteous indignation (nemesis), which is a balanced feeling of sympathetic pain concerning the undeserved pleasures and pains of others.EE III.vii. Also see MM. Exactly which habitual dispositions are virtues or vices and which only concern emotions, differs between the different works which have survived, but the basic examples are consistent, as is the basis for distinguishing them in principle. Some people, despite intending to do the right thing, cannot act according to their own choice. For example, someone may choose to refrain from eating chocolate cake, but finds himself eating the cake contrary to his own choice. Such a failure to act in a way that is consistent with one's own decision is called \\"akrasia\\", and may be translated as weakness of will, incontinence, or lack of self-mastery.  Four Cardinal Virtues  # Prudence, also known as practical wisdom, is the most important virtue for Aristotle. In war, soldiers must fight with prudence by making judgments through practical wisdom. This virtue is a must to obtain because courage requires judgments to be made. # Temperance, or self-control, simply means moderation. Soldiers must display moderation with their enjoyment while at war in the midst of violent activities. Temperance concerning courage gives one moderation in private which leads to moderation in public. # Courage is ‚Äúmoderation or observance of the mean with respect to feelings of fear and confidence.‚Äù Courage is ‚Äúobservance of the mean with regard to things that excite confidence or fear, under the circumstances which we have specified, and chooses its course and sticks to its post because it is noble to do so, or because it is disgraceful not to do so.‚Äù Concerning warfare, Aristotle believes soldiers are morally significant and are military and political heroes. War is simply a stage for soldiers to display courage, and is the only way courage can be exemplified. Any other action by a human is simply the copying a soldier's ways; they are not actually courageous. # Justice means giving the enemy what is due to them in the proper ways; being just toward them. In other words, one must recognize what is good for the community and one must undertake a good course of action. Vices of courage must also be identified which are cowardice and recklessness. Soldiers who are not prudent act with cowardice, and soldiers who do not have temperance act with recklessness. One should not be unjust toward their enemy no matter the circumstance. On another note, one becomes virtuous by first imitating another who exemplifies such virtuous characteristics, practicing such ways in their daily lives, turning those ways into customs and habits by performing them each and every day, and finally, connecting or uniting the four of them together. Only soldiers can exemplify such virtues because war demands soldiers to exercise disciplined and firm virtues, but war does everything in its power to shatter the virtues it demands. Since virtues are very fragile, they must be practiced always, for if they are not practiced they will weaken and eventually disappear. One who is virtuous has to avoid the enemies of virtue which are indifference or persuasion that something should not be done, self-indulgence or persuasion that something can wait and does not need to be done at that moment, and despair or persuasion that something simply cannot be accomplished anyway. In order for one to be virtuous they must display prudence, temperance, courage, and justice; moreover, they have to display all four of them and not just one or two to be virtuous.  Justice  Aristotle devotes Book V of the Nicomachean Ethics to justice (this is also Book IV of the Eudemian Ethics). In this discussion, Aristotle defines justice as having two different but related senses‚Äîgeneral justice and particular justice. General justice is virtue expressed in relation to other people. Thus the just man in this sense deals properly and fairly with others, and expresses his virtue in his dealings with them‚Äînot lying or cheating or taking from others what is owed to them. Particular justice is the correct distribution of just deserts to others. For Aristotle, such justice is proportional‚Äîit has to do with people receiving what is proportional to their merit or their worth. In his discussion of particular justice, Aristotle says an educated judge is needed to apply just decisions regarding any particular case. This is where we get the image of the scales of justice, the blindfolded judge symbolizing blind justice, balancing the scales, weighing all the evidence and deliberating each particular case individually.  The highest good  In his ethical works, Aristotle describes eudaimonia as the highest human good. In Book I of the Nicomachean Ethics he goes on to identify eudaimonia as the excellent exercise of the intellect, leaving it open whether he means practical activity or intellectual activity. With respect to practical activity, in order to exercise any one of the practical excellences in the highest way, a person must possess all the others. Aristotle therefore describes several apparently different kinds of virtuous person as necessarily having all the moral virtues, excellences of character. *Being of \\"great soul\\" (magnanimity), the virtue where someone would be truly deserving of the highest praise and have a correct attitude towards the honor this may involve. This is the first such case mentioned in the Nicomachean Ethics.It is mentioned within the initial discussion of practical examples of virtues and vices at Book IV.1123b. *Being just in the true sense. This is the type of justice or fairness of a good ruler in a good community.This description occurs for example during the special discussion of the virtue (or virtues) of justice at 1129b in Book V. *Phronesis or practical wisdom, as shown by good leaders.Mentioned in this way at 1144b in Book VI.1144b. *The virtue of being a truly good friend.Book VIII.1157a *Having the nobility kalokagathia of a gentleman.Eudemian Ethics Book VIII, chapter 3. Aristotle also says, for example in NE Book VI, that such a complete virtue requires intellectual virtue, not only practical virtue, but also theoretical wisdom. Such a virtuous person, if they can come into being, will choose the most pleasant and happy life of all, which is the philosophical life of contemplation and speculation. Aristotle claims that a human's highest functioning must include reasoning, being good at what sets humans apart from everything else. Or, as Aristotle explains it, \\"The function of man is activity of soul in accordance with reason, or at least not without reason.\\" He identifies two different ways in which the soul can engage: reasoning (both practical and theoretical) and following reasoning. A person that does this is the happiest because they are fulfilling their purpose or nature as found in the rational soul. :(The wise person will) be more than human. A man will not live like that by virtue of his humanness, but by virtue of some divine thing within him. His activity is as superior to the activity of the other virtues as this divine thing is to his composite character. Now if mind is divine in comparison with man, the life of the mind is divine in comparison with mere human life. We should not follow popular advice and, being human, have only mortal thoughts, but should become immortal and do everything toward living the best in us. (NE 10.7) In other words, the thinker is not only the 'best' person, but is also most like God.  Influence on later thinkers  Aristotle's writings were taught in the Academy in Athens until 529 CE when the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I closed down non-Christian schools of philosophy. Aristotle's work however continued to be taught as a part of secular education. Aristotle's teachings spread through the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where some early Islamic regimes allowed rational philosophical descriptions of the natural world. Alfarabi was a major influence in all medieval philosophy and wrote many works which included attempts to reconcile the ethical and political writings of Plato and Aristotle. Later Avicenna, and later still Averroes, were Islamic philosophers who commented on Aristotle as well as writing their own philosophy in Arabic. Averroes, a European Muslim, was particularly influential in turn upon European Christian philosophers, theologians and political thinkers. In the twelfth century, Latin translations of Aristotle's works were made, enabling the Dominican priest Albert the Great and his pupil Thomas Aquinas to synthesize Aristotle's philosophy with Christian theology. Later the medieval church scholasticism in Western Europe insisted on Thomist views and suppressed non-Aristotelian metaphysics. Aquinas' writings are full of references to Aristotle, and he wrote a commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Aquinas also departed from Aristotle in certain respects. In particular, his Summa Theologica argued that Eudaimonia or human flourishing was held to be a temporary goal for this life, but perfect happiness as the ultimate goal could only be attained in the next life by the virtuous. Aquinas also added new theological virtues to Aristotle's system: faith, hope and charity. And supernatural assistance could help people to achieve virtue. Nevertheless, much of Aristotle's ethical thought remained intact in Aquinas. In modern times, Aristotle's writings on ethics remain among the most influential in his broad corpus, along with The Rhetoric, and The Poetics, while his scientific writings tend to be viewed as of more strictly historical interest. Modern science develops theories about the physical world based on experiments and careful observation‚Äîin particular, on the basis of exact measurements of time and distance. Aristotle, on the other hand, bases his science largely on qualitative and non-experimental observation. Accordingly, he made some inaccurate claims which have been overturned‚Äîsuch as the claim that objects of different mass accelerate at different rates due to gravity. On the other hand, The Nicomachean Ethics continues to be relevant to philosophers today. In fact, virtue ethics takes its inspiration from Aristotle's approach to ethics‚Äîin particular, sharing his emphasis on character excellence, and ethical psychology. Some philosophers, in particular Bernard Williams, regard Aristotle's ethics as superior to the Utilitarian and Kantian traditions, which have come to be the dominant approaches to philosophical ethics. Aristotle's well-known function argument is less commonly accepted today, since he seems to use it in order to develop a claim about human perfection from an observation from what is distinctive about man. But the exact role of the function argument in Aristotle's ethical theory is itself a matter of dispute.

The Fourth Network details the history of Fox up until the 1999-2000 broadcast season, with events happening afterward included in an epilogue. Many times throughout the book Kimmel makes a point of how Fox, during its first 20 years of existence, radically changed the standards by which network television stations in America operate, such as putting an emphasis on looking at demographics in show ratings as opposed to overall viewership, and working with cable television suppliers in order to attain a broader audience. While much of the book, which is laden with interviews of former network executives, deals with the network's prime time programming, some material is left to the network's other endeavors, both successful and unsuccessful, such as Fox's stunning acquisition of the rights to NFL games, the start-up of the Fox Kids Saturday morning cartoon block, as well Fox's failed attempts at a morning show and late-night talk shows. Reception In 2005, the book won the Goddard Book Award from the Cable Center for best book of 2004.Past Goddard Book Award Winners CableCenter.org Publishers Weekly called the book \\"a solid but rather dry account of the birth of a network and its impact on TV\\".The Fourth Network.

According to Wikipedia's List of Internet Exchange Points by Size, TorIX is the 16th largest IXP in the world in numbers of peers, and 17th in the world in traffic averages. The Exchange is organized and run by industry professionals in voluntary capacity. Within 151 Front Street, TorIX is accessible within facilities operated by Equinix, Cologix, Neutral Data Centres and Frontier Networks, or available via the building's meet-me-room (MMR), which makes the IX reachable by any organization with a presence in the building. At Equinix TR2, TorIX is available to all organizations present there. At 905 King Street West, TorIX is accessible via the building meet-me-room. History 151 Front Street West Building TorIX initially started by Bill Campbell and Jason Lixfeld in 1997 the RACO facility in suite 604 at 151 Front Street West. In 2003, the exchange began offering gigabit Ethernet. In 2008, the Exchange began offering 10GE ports. In 2015, 100GE ports began to be offered. Inaugurated 19 December 1846, over a line connecting Toronto City Hall, then occupying this site, with Hamilton. The system was built and owned by the Toronto, Hamilton and Niagara Electro- Magnetic Telegraph Company. Organized in 1846, Incorporated 1847, and now operated as part of \\"Canadian National Telegraphs\\". (Erected 1929) Architecture The exchange is Ethernet-based and currently operates Cisco Cisco Nexus switches 9000 series switches. Core nodes handle port speeds of GigabitEthernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet and 100 Gigabit Ethernet, including bonded configurations. Peers connect to the Layer 2 fabric using IPv4 & IPv6 addresses provided by TorIX to communicate with each other using the BGP routing protocol. Single-mode fiber is the only physical connection media supported. =Route-Servers= The Exchange also offers two BGP Route-Servers, which allow peers to exchange prefixes with each other while minimizing the number of direct BGP peering sessions configured on their routers. Participation is voluntary, with approximately 85 percent of the membership using the free service. Strict prefix filtering to prevent unintentional announcements of IP address blocks to other participants. The exchange allows participants the option of eliminating the TorIX ASN from the AS path of prefixes received via the route-servers. This can substantially increase the utility of the route-servers for participants, but should only be undertaken after careful consideration. In addition, TorIX participants will have a range of BGP communities that can be used for traffic engineering purposes. =Portal= The Exchange operates a members-only portal that allows peers to publish their peering policies, contact other members with peering requests, configure route-server access and options, track traffic usage, etc. =Community Projects= TorIX will consider hosting Internet community projects that are of an interest to members of the Exchange or the wider Canadian Internet. ntp.torix.ca Since 2012, TorIX has been hosting a cluster of Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers for use by the Internet as a whole. Using servers which sync to both GPS and CDMA sources, the TorIX NTP cluster is a stratum 1 time source. The original equipment was donated by the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA) and has since been replaced and upgraded. As of June 2019 provides time to over 500,000 devices worldwide every minute. Membership Membership is open to all companies capable of connecting to the exchange at 151 Front Street West or Equinix TR2, and have their own Autonomous System Number (ASN). The typical peer is an ISP, communications company or a Content Delivery Network, though overall membership includes a broad range of enterprise companies, government, and educational institutions. Peers have autonomous control over their routing policies at the exchange, and may peer with as few or as many as desired. The exchange does encourage use of the route-servers. Members are not required to have their own provider-independent address space, but it is recommended. For those that do not, and who wish to join the exchange, companies are asked to provide a Letter of Authority from their ISP permitting them to advertise their IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes. Peers must have their own unique ASNs. Organizations wishing to connect to TorIX can arrange colocation for their equipment with one of the many companies operating at 151 Front Street West or with Equinix at TR2, or use long-haul Ethernet transport through a third-party provider capable of physically connecting to the exchange. Justification for joining the Toronto Internet Exchange is typical to most IXPs: financial, network performance and/or security. High-profile members of TorIX include Google, Akamai, Facebook, Amazon, Yahoo!, Telus, Zayo Group, CANARIE, CBC, CenturyLink, CloudFlare, Cogeco, DigitalOcean, Distributel, Dropbox, Eastlink, Fastly, iTeraTEL, Limelight Networks, LinkedIn, Microsoft, ORION, OVH, Primus Canada, Rogers Communications, Shaw Communications, StackPath, TekSavvy, Twitch, Cogent Communications, Frontier Networks, Freedom Mobile and Vianet Inc. =Financial= Compared to commercial Internet transit pricing in Canada, the per-megabit cost of being a typical TorIX peer works out to cents- on-the-dollar, versus tens of dollars per megabit. According to Job Snijders' IXP Pricing List, TorIX is one of the lowest cost IXP's in the entire world. Most commercial Internet transit agreements require a minimum traffic commitment level, which the customer must pay regardless if their usage is below that point. If usage exceeds the contracted commitment level, the customer usually pays based on an agreed per-megabit charge. Billing is typically done based on the 95th percentile. As a not-for-profit, TorIX charges a small port fee based on the speed of the port the member desires, rather than the amount of traffic traveling over TorIX. The more traffic, the better, but peers are not penalized for lower traffic levels. The low-cost barrier to entry for prospective peers is attractive for smaller companies, while larger companies can see significant operational expense savings by utilizing the exchange at a fraction of the cost of commercial Internet transit. =Performance= By utilizing the exchange, members can keep their Internet traffic \\"local,\\" without the added latency of a third-party Internet transit provider. For example, Internet traffic between two points in the same province that used different last mile ISPs may travel extensive physical distances, including to and from other countries, which would negatively impact latency-sensitive applications. Through direct peering relationships, members and their customers realize better network performance. While many companies see a benefit in such arrangements, including many of the country's largest ISPs, Bell Canada is not a participant at TorIX. =Security= By keeping Canadian Internet traffic local within the country, many organizations are able to alleviate concerns regarding Canadian source/destination Internet traffic, particularly involving concerns regarding the American NSA's interception of cross-border traffic, best demonstrated by the revelations of Edward Snowden to the press. =Fees= Peers are charged an annual port access fee, with the cost dependent on the type of port and the number of ports required. These fees are used to offset the costs of running the exchange, including vendor support contracts, spare optics and hardware upgrades. Mailing lists TorIX operates several mailing lists: three are TorIX specific, two deal with operational issues, and the other is a general member participation list. The exchange also hosts a mailing list for wholesale ISPs that connect to Bell Canada (formerly Bell Nexxia)'s wholesale DSL services, and this is a key source for up-to-date information on day-to- day issues experienced by operators. Sponsorship TorIX has been a gold sponsor of the annual Canadian ISP Summit in Toronto since 2011. TorIX sponsored NANOG 65 Montreal in October 2015. In April 2010, TorIX was a co- sponsor of ARIN's conference in Toronto. In February 2007, TorIX was a co- sponsor of NANOG's conference in Toronto.

The first edition contained 86 stories, and by the seventh edition in 1857, had 210 unique fairy tales.  Origin  Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were two of eight children from their mother Dorothea (n√©e Zimmer) and father Philipp Wilhelm Grimm. Philipp was a highly regarded district magistrate in Steinau, near Kassel. Jacob and Wilhelm were sent to school for a classical education once they were of age, while their father was working. They were very hard-working pupils throughout their education. They followed in their father‚Äôs footsteps and started to pursue a degree in law, and German history. However, in 1796, their father died at the age of 44 from pneumonia. This was a tragic time for the Grimms because the family lost all financial support and relied on their aunt, Henriette Zimmer, and grandfather, Johanne Hermann Zimmer. At the age of 11, Jacob was compelled to be head of the household and provide for his family. After downsizing their home because of financial reasons, Henriette sent Jacob and Wilhelm to study at the prestigious high school, Lyzeum, in Kassel. In school, their grandfather wrote to them saying that because of their current situation, they needed to apply themselves industriously to secure their future welfare. Shortly after attending Lyzeum, their grandfather died and they were again left to themselves to support their family in the future. The two became intent on becoming the best students at Lyzeum, since they wanted to live up to their deceased father. They studied more than twelve hours a day and established similar work habits. They also shared the same bed and room at school. After four years of rigorous schooling, Jacob graduated head of his class in 1802. Wilhelm contracted asthma and scarlet fever, which delayed his graduation by one year although he was also head of his class. Both were given special dispensations for studying law at the University of Marburg. They particularly needed this dispensation because their social standing at the time was not high enough to have normal admittance. University of Marburg was a small, 200-person university where most students were more interested in activities other than schooling. Most of the students received stipends even though they were the richest in the state. The Grimms did not receive any stipends because of their social standing; however, they were not upset by it since it kept the distractions away. = Professor Friedrich Carl von Savigny = Jacob attended the university first and showed proof of his hard work ethic and quick intelligence. Wilhelm joined Jacob at the university, and Jacob drew the attention of Professor Friedrich Carl von Savigny, founder of its historical school of law. He became a huge personal and professional influence on the brothers. Throughout their time at university, the brothers became quite close with Savigny and were able to use his personal library as they became very interested in German law, history, and folklore. Savigny asked Jacob to join him in Paris as an assistant, and Jacob went with him for a year. While he was gone, Wilhelm became very interested in German literature and started collecting books. Once Jacob returned to Kassel in 1806, he adopted his brother's passion and changed his focus from law to German literature. While Jacob studied literature and took care of their siblings, Wilhelm continued on to receive his degree in law at Marburg. During the Napoleonic Wars, Jacob interrupted his studies to serve the Hessian War Commission. In 1808, their mother died, and it was hard on Jacob because he took the position in the family as a father figure, while also trying to be a brother. From 1806 to 1810, the Grimm family had barely enough money to properly feed and clothe themselves. During this time, Jacob and Wilhelm were concerned about the stability of the family. Achim von Arnim and Clemens Brentano were good friends of the brothers and wanted to publish folk tales, so they asked the brothers to collect oral tales for publication. The Grimms collected many old books and asked friends and acquaintances in Kassel to tell tales and to gather stories from others. Jacob and Wilhelm sought to collect these stories in order to write a history of old German Poesie and to preserve history. Composition The first volume of the first edition was published in 1812, containing 86 stories; the second volume of 70 stories followed in 1815. For the second edition, two volumes containing the KHM texts were issued in 1819 and the Appendix was removed and published separately in the third volume in 1822, totaling 170 tales. The third edition appeared in 1837; fourth edition, 1840; fifth edition, 1843; sixth edition, 1850; seventh edition, 1857. Stories were added, and also subtracted, from one edition to the next, until the seventh held 210 tales. Some later editions were extensively illustrated, first by Philipp Grot Johann and, after his death in 1892, by German illustrator Robert Leinweber. The first volumes were much criticized because, although they were called \\"Children's Tales\\", they were not regarded as suitable for children, both for the scholarly information included and the subject matter.Maria Tatar, The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales, p15-17, Many changes through the editions ‚Äì such as turning the wicked mother of the first edition in Snow White and Hansel and Gretel (shown in original Grimm stories as H√§nsel and Grethel) to a stepmother, were probably made with an eye to such suitability. Jack Zipes believes that the Grimms made the change in later editions because they ‚Äúheld motherhood sacred‚Äù.Flood, Alison. \\"Grimm brothers‚Äô fairytales have blood and horror restored in new translation\\", The Guardian, November 12, 2014 They removed sexual references‚Äîsuch as Rapunzel's innocently asking why her dress was getting tight around her belly, and thus naively revealing to the witch Dame Gothel her pregnancy and the prince's visits‚Äîbut, in many respects, violence, particularly when punishing villains, was increased.Maria Tatar, \\"Reading the Grimms' Children's Stories and Household Tales\\" p. xxvii-iv, Maria Tatar, ed. The Annotated Brothers Grimm.,  Popularity  The brothers' initial intention of their first book, Children‚Äôs and Household Tales, was to establish a name for themselves in the world. After publishing the first KHM in 1812, they published a second, augmented and re-edited, volume in 1815. In 1816 Volume I of the German Legends () was published, followed in 1818, Volume II. However, the book that established their international success was not any of their tales, but Jacob‚Äôs German Grammar in 1819. In 1825, the Brothers published their Kleine Ausgabe or \\"small edition\\", a selection of 50 tales designed for child readers. This children's version went through ten editions between 1825 and 1858. In 1830, Jacob became a professor at University of G√∂ttingen and shortly after, in 1835, Wilhelm also became a professor. During these years Jacob wrote a third volume of German Grammar and Wilhelm prepared the third revision of the Children‚Äôs and Household Tales. In 1837, King Ernst August II revoked the constitution of 1833 and was attempting to restore absolutism in the Kingdom of Hanover. Since G√∂ttingen was a part of Hanover, the brothers were expected to take an oath of allegiance. However, the brothers and five other professors led a protest against this and were heavily supported by the student body since all of these professors were well renowned. Jacob left G√∂ttingen immediately and Wilhelm followed him a few months later back to Kassel. In Kassel, the Grimms devoted themselves to researching and studying. A close friend of theirs, Bettina von Arnim, was also a talented writer. Savigny and others convinced the King of Prussia, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, to allow the brothers to teach and conduct research at the University of Berlin. In March 1841, the brothers did just this and also continued to work on the German Dictionary. Influence Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen (Children and Household Tales) is listed by UNESCO in its Memory of the World Registry.Zipes, Jack. \\"How the Grimm Brothers Saved the Fairy Tale\\", Humanities, March/April 2015 The Grimms believed that the most natural and pure forms of culture were linguistic and based in history. The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of romantic nationalism, that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence.Acocella, Joan. \\"Once Upon a Time\\", The New Yorker, July 23, 2012 Among those influenced were the Russian Alexander Afanasyev, the Norwegians Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen and J√∏rgen Moe, the English Joseph Jacobs, and Jeremiah Curtin, an American who collected Irish tales.Jack Zipes, The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, p 846, There was not always a pleased reaction to their collection. Joseph Jacobs was in part inspired by his complaint that English children did not read English fairy tales;Maria Tatar, p 345-5, The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales, in his own words, \\"What Perrault began, the Grimms completed\\". W. H. Auden praised the collection during World War II as one of the founding works of Western culture.Maria Tatar, \\"Reading the Grimms' Children's Stories and Household Tales\\" p. xxx, Maria Tatar, ed. The Annotated Brothers Grimm, The tales themselves have been put to many uses. Adolf Hitler praised them as folkish tales showing children with sound racial instincts seeking racially pure marriage partners, and so strongly that the Allies of World War II warned against them;Maria Tatar, \\"-xxxix, Maria Tatar, ed. The Annotated Brothers Grimm, for instance, Cinderella with the heroine as racially pure, the stepmother as an alien, and the prince with an unspoiled instinct being able to distinguish.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 77-8 Writers who have written about the Holocaust have combined the tales with their memoirs, as Jane Yolen in her Briar Rose.Maria Tatar, \\"Reading the Grimms' Fairy Stories and Household Tales\\" p. xlvi, Maria Tatar, ed. The Annotated Brothers Grimm, Three individual works of Wilhelm Grimm include Altd√§nische Heldenlieder, Balladen und M√§rchen ('Old Danish Heroic Songs, Ballads, and Folktales') in 1811, √úber deutsche Runen ('On German Runes') in 1821, and Die deutsche Heldensage ('The German Heroic Saga') in 1829. The Grimm anthology has been a source of inspiration for artists and composers. Arthur Rackham, Walter Crane and Rie Cramer are among the artists who have created illustrations based on the stories.

It is sited in Bandipora district in Jammu and Kashmir, India. The lake basin was formed as a result of tectonic activity and is fed by the Jhelum River. The lake's size varies seasonally from 12 to 100 square miles (30 to 260 square kilometres). In addition, much of the lake has been drained as a result of willow plantations being built on the shore in the 1950s. Etymology In ancient times, Wular Lake was also called Mahapadmasar (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§™‡§¶‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∏‡§∞‡§É). Nilamata Purana also mentions it as Mahapadmasaras. Mahapadmasar is referred as Bolor by Al-Biruni {960‚Äì1031 AD}. The lake, with its big dimensions and the extent of water, gives rise to high leaping waves in the afternoons, called Ullola in Sanskrit, meaning \\"stormy leaping, high rising waves\\". Therefore, it was also being called Ullola. Its corrupted form saw its transition as Bolor by Al-Biruni and over the centuries corrupted further to Wulor or Wular.Ramsar Sites of disputed territory: Wular Lake, Jammu and Kashmir, World Wide Fund for Nature, India, 1994, ... The name \\"Vulla\\" from which the present name Wular or Volar (Vulgo Woolar) seems to have been derived, is found in the Janarajas chronicle and can be interpreted as 'turbulent' or the lake with high-going waves' ...Imperial Gazetteer of India, Sir William Wilson Hunter, pp. 387, Clarendon Press, 1908, ... Wular Lake - Lake in Kashmir State ... bad reputation among the boatmen of Kashmir, for when the winds come down the mountain gorges, the quiet surface of the lake changes into a sea of rolling waves ... corruption of ullola, Sanskrit for 'turbulent' ... The ancient name is Mahapadmasaras, derived from the Naga Mahapadma, who is located in the lake as its tutelary deity ... The origin may also be attributed to a Kashmiri word 'Wul', which means a gap or a fissure, appellation that must have come also during this period. The word Wul {Gap or fissure}, is also an indicator of its origin to a fissure or gap created. Natural history The lake is one of the 37 Indian wetlands designated as a Ramsar site. However it faces environmental threats including the conversion of large parts of the lake's catchment areas into agriculture land, pollution from fertilizers and animal wastes, hunting of waterfowl and migratory birds, and weed infestation in the lake itself. =Fish= Wular Lake is an important fish habitat, the main species being the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), rosy barb (Barbus conchonius), mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), Nemacheilus species, Crossocheilus latius, and various snowtrout species in the genera Schizopyge and Schizothorax. Snowtrout species identified in the lake include the Sattar snowtrout (Schizopyge curvifrons), Chirruh snowtrout (Schizopyge esocinus), Schizothorax planifrons, Schizothorax macropogon, Schizothorax longipinus and Chush snowtrout (Schizopyge niger). Fish from Wular Lake make up a significant part of the diet for many thousands of people living on its shores and elsewhere in the Kashmir Valley. More than eight thousand fishermen earn their livelihood from the lake, primarily fishing for the endemic Schizothorax species and the non-native carp. Their catch comprises about 60 percent of the total yield of fish in Kashmir. Hundreds of other local villagers are employed by cooperative societies that trade the fish catch. Many other families harvest plants such as the grass Phragmites and the waterlily-like Nymphoides from the lake for animal fodder. =Birds= The lake sustains a rich population of birds. Terrestrial birds observed around the lake include the black-eared kite, Eurasian sparrowhawk, short-toed eagle, Himalayan golden eagle, Himalayan monal, chukar partridge, koklass pheasant, rock dove, common cuckoo, alpine swift, Indian roller, Himalayan woodpecker, hoopoe, barn swallow, golden oriole and others. History The Kashmiri sultan Zain-ul-Abidin is reputed to have ordered the construction of the artificial island of Zaina Lank in the middle of the lake in 1444. Tulbul Project The Tulbul Project is a \\"navigation lock-cum- control structure\\" at the mouth of Wular Lake. According to the original Indian plan, the barrage was expected to be of long and wide, and would have a maximum storage capacity of of water. One aim was to regulate the release of water from the natural storage in the lake to maintain a minimum draught of in the river up to Baramulla during the lean winter months. The project was conceived in the early 1980s and work began in 1984. The average annual inflows or outflows from the lake is nearly 7 billion cubic meters There has been an ongoing dispute between India and Pakistan over the Tulbul Project since 1987, when Pakistan objected that it violated the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). India stopped work on the project that year, but has since pressed to restart construction. The Jhelum River passing through the Kashmir valley below Wular Lake which is a connecting lake as per IWT, provides an important means of transport for goods and people. To sustain navigation throughout the year, a minimum depth of water is needed. India contends that the Tulbul Project is permissible per paragraphs 7 (c) and 9 of Annexure E, IWT while Pakistan maintains that the project is a violation of the treaty if the storage is above for non-power generation purpose. India says suspension of work is harming the interests of people of Jammu and Kashmir and also depriving irrigation and power benefits to the people of Pakistan that may accrue from regulated water releases. The lake storage capacity can be increased per IWT to 300,000 acre feet or more up to 1580 m MSL by considering it as a reservoir for a run of the river (RoR) hydro power plant by envisaging a low head (nearly 8 meters rated head) power plant. The available deepened river bed level at the toe of the dam can be below MSL for 4,000 cusecs flow. Simultaneously, the enlarged lake can also meet the downstream navigational requirements fully during the lean flow season. The regulated buffer / surcharge water storage in the Wular lake would substantially enhance the power generation from the downstream Lower Jhelum (105 MW), Uri (720 MW), proposed 1124 MW Kohala (in PaK), proposed 720 MW Azad Pattan (in PaK), 590-MW Mahl hydropower project (in PaK) and proposed 720 MW Karot (in PaK) RoR hydel projects though its own power plant's generation is marginal. Construction of a RoR power plant with sufficient sluice gates would also flush the sediment from the lake area to preserve the lake. The lean season water inflows into the Wular Lake are enhanced from the Kishanganga river by the Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plant after generating electricity. Other lakes such as Manasbal Lake, Anchar Lake, Dal Lake, etc. which are not located on Jhelum Main river can be used similar to Wular Lake to impound flood waters for flood protection in downstream areas, hydro electricity generation, navigation throughout the year, irrigation, municipal and industrial uses. Recognition In recognition of its biological, hydrological and socio-economic values, the lake was included in 1986 as a Wetland of National Importance under the Wetlands Programme of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India for intensive conservation and management purposes. Subsequently, in 1990, it was designated as a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention. Against the Ramsar Conventions, the lake area is being used for garbage dumping. =Restoration= Amongst other developments, two million trees will be cut to restore Wular Lake under the National Lake Conservation Programme. The Environment Ministry of India approved Rs 4 billion for the restoration project for the lake that will take 5 to 10 years and was after long delays scheduled to start in December 2011. The partner organisation South Asian Voluntary Association of Environmentalists (SAVE) is a joint initiative of individuals with the aim to protect the ecology and to conserve the nature at Wular Lake. Tourism Boating, water sports and water skiing have been launched by the Government of India Tourism in collaboration with Kerala Tourism and J&K; Tourism. The contract for the operation of the site was awarded in September 2011.

It is most associated with actress-singer Ethel Waters who used the title for her autobiography.Waters, Ethel, with Charles Samuels, His Eye Is On The Sparrow: An Autobiography, New York, 1951, reprinted by Da Capo Press, 1992 Mahalia Jackson's recording of the song was honored with the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 2010. Sometimes it was sung with the slightly altered title \\"His Eye is on the Tiny Bird\\" and this version was recorded by actress Violet Carson in 1972. Inspiration The theme of the song is inspired by the words of David in the Psalms and Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible: \\"I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye (Psalm 32:8). \\"Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?\\" (Matthew 6:26) and \\"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows\\" (Matthew 10:29‚Äì31).

With its monetary tools, a monetary authority is able to effectively influence the development of short-term interest rates, but can also influence other parameters which control the cost and availability of money. Generally, a monetary authority is a central bank or currency board. Most central banks have a certain degree of independence from the government and its political targets and decisions. But depending on the political set-up, governments can have as much as a de facto control over monetary policy if they are allowed to influence or control their central bank. A currency board may restrict the supply of currency to the amount of another currency. In some cases there may be free banking where a broad range of entities (such as banks) can issue notes or coin. Commonly, there is one monetary authority for one country with its currency. However, there are also other arrangements in place, such as in the case of the eurozone where the so-called Eurosystem, consisting of the European Central Bank and the 19 European Union member states that have adopted the euro as their sole official currency, is the sole monetary authority.

Background Argyll was the eldest son of John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll and his wife, Elizabeth Campbell, 1st Baroness Hamilton, daughter of Colonel John Gunning. Career Argyll sat as Member of Parliament for St Germans from 1790 to 1796. In 1806 he succeeded his father in the dukedom and entered the House of Lords. He was Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland from 1827 to 1828 and again from 1830 and 1839. In 1833 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Lord Steward of the Household in the Whig administration headed by Lord Grey, a position he retained when Lord Melbourne became prime minister in July 1834. The Whigs fell from power in November 1834 but returned to office already in April 1835, when Argyll once again became Lord Steward under Melbourne. He continued in the post until his death in 1839. Argyll was also Lord-Lieutenant of Argyllshire from 1799 to 1839. Family Argyll married Lady Caroline Elizabeth Villiers, daughter of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Jersey, at Edinburgh, on 29 November 1810. She was the former wife of Argyll's friend Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey. They had no children. He died in October 1839, aged 71 at Inveraray Castle, Argyllshire, and was buried on 10 November 1839 at Kilmun Parish Church in Kilmun, Cowal.

The real interest rate is the rate of interest an investor, saver or lender receives (or expects to receive) after allowing for inflation. It can be described more formally by the Fisher equation, which states that the real interest rate is approximately the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. If, for example, an investor were able to lock in a interest rate for the coming year and anticipated a rise in prices, they would expect to earn a real interest rate of .Marc Levinson, 2006, \\"Guide to Financial Markets\\", The Economist, page 24 The expected real interest rate is not a single number, as different investors have different expectations of future inflation. Since the inflation rate over the course of a loan is not known initially, volatility in inflation represents a risk to both the lender and the borrower. In the case of contracts stated in terms of the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate is known only at the end of the period of the loan, based on the realized inflation rate; this is called the ex-post real interest rate. Since the introduction of inflation-indexed bonds, ex-ante real interest rates have become observable. Compensation for lending An individual who lends money for repayment at a later point in time expects to be compensated for the time value of money, or not having the use of that money while it is lent. In addition, they will want to be compensated for the expected value of the loss of purchasing power when the loan is repaid. These expected losses include the possibility that the borrower will default or be unable to pay on the originally agreed upon terms, or that collateral backing the loan will prove to be less valuable than estimated; the possibility of changes in taxation and regulatory changes which would prevent the lender from collecting on a loan or having to pay more in taxes on the amount repaid than originally estimated; and the loss of buying power compared to the money originally lent, due to inflation. :Nominal interest rates measure the sum of the compensations for all three sources of loss, plus the time value of the money itself. :Real interest rates measure the compensation for expected losses due to default and regulatory changes as well as measuring the time value of money; they differ from nominal rates of interest by excluding the inflation compensation component. On an economy-wide basis, the \\"real interest rate\\" in an economy is often considered to be the rate of return on a risk- free investment, such as US Treasury notes, minus an index of inflation, such as the rate of change of the CPI or GDP deflator. =Fisher equation= The relation between real and nominal interest rates and the expected inflation rate is given by the Fisher equation :1+i = (1+r) (1+\\\\pi_e) where : = nominal interest rate; : = real interest rate; :\\\\pi_e = expected inflation rate. For example, if somebody lends for a year at , and receives back at the end of the year, this represents a increase in her purchasing power if prices for the average goods and services that she buys are unchanged from what they were at the beginning of the year. However, if the prices of the food, clothing, housing, and other things that she wishes to purchase have increased over this period, she has, in fact, suffered a real loss of about in her purchasing power. (Notice that the approximation here is a bit rough; since 1.1/1.25 = 0.88 = 1 - 0.12, the actual loss of purchasing power is exactly .) If the inflation rate and the nominal interest are relatively low, the Fisher equation can be approximated by :r=i-\\\\pi_e. =After-tax real interest rate= The real return actually gained by a lender is lower if there is a non-zero tax rate imposed on interest earnings. Generally taxes are imposed on nominal interest earnings, not adjusted for inflation. If the tax rate is denoted as t, the before-tax nominal earning rate is i, the amount of taxes paid (per dollar or other unit invested) is i √ó t, and so the after-tax nominal earning is i √ó (1‚Äìt ). Hence the expected after-tax real return to the investor, using the simplified approximate Fisher equation above, is given by :Expected real after-tax return = i(1-t) - \\\\pi_e. =Variations in inflation= The inflation rate will not be known in advance. People often base their expectation of future inflation on an average of inflation rates in the past, but this gives rise to errors. The real interest rate ex-post may turn out to be quite different from the real interest rate (ex-ante real interest rate) that was expected in advance. Borrowers hope to repay in cheaper money in the future, while lenders hope to collect on more expensive money. When inflation and currency risks are underestimated by lenders, then they will suffer a net reduction in buying power. The complexity increases for bonds issued for a long-term, where the average inflation rate over the term of the loan may be subject to a great deal of uncertainty. In response to this, many governments have issued real return bonds, also known as inflation-indexed bonds, in which the principal value and coupon rises each year with the rate of inflation, with the result that the interest rate on the bond approximates a real interest rate. (E.g., the three-month indexation lag of TIPS can result in a divergence of as much as from the real interest rate, according to research by Grishchenko and Huang.) In the US, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are issued by the US Treasury. The expected real interest rate can vary considerably from year to year. The real interest rate on short term loans is strongly influenced by the monetary policy of central banks. The real interest rate on longer term bonds tends to be more market driven, and in recent decades, with globalized financial markets, the real interest rates in the industrialized countries have become increasingly correlated. Real interest rates have been low by historical standards since 2000, due to a combination of factors, including relatively weak demand for loans by corporations, plus strong savings in newly industrializing countries in Asia. The latter has offset the large borrowing demands by the US Federal Government, which might otherwise have put more upward pressure on real interest rates. Related is the concept of \\"risk return\\", which is the rate of return minus the risks as measured against the safest (least-risky) investment available. Thus if a loan is made at with an inflation rate of and in risks associated with default or problems repaying, then the \\"risk adjusted\\" rate of return on the investment is . Importance in economic theory Effective federal funds rate and prescriptions from alternate versions of the Taylor Rule The amount of physical investment‚Äîin particular the purchasing of new machines and other productive capacity‚Äîthat firms engage in depends on the level of real interest rates, because such purchases typically must be financed by issuing new bonds. If real interest rates are high, the cost of borrowing may exceed the real physical return of some potentially purchased machines (in the form of output produced); in that case those machines will not be purchased. Lower real interest rates would make it profitable to borrow to finance the purchasing of a greater number of machines. The real interest rate is used in various economic theories to explain such phenomena as capital flight, business cycles and economic bubbles. When the real rate of interest is high, because demand for credit is high, then the usage of income will, all other things being equal, move from consumption to saving, and physical investment will fall. Conversely, when the real rate of interest is low, income usage will move from saving to consumption, and physical investment will rise. Different economic theories, beginning with the work of Knut Wicksell have had different explanations of the effect of rising and falling real interest rates. Thus, international capital moves to markets that offer higher real rates of interest from markets that offer low or negative real rates of interest triggering speculation in equities, estates and exchange rates. =Real federal funds rate= In setting monetary policy, the U.S. Federal Reserve (and other central banks) uses open market operations, affecting the amounts of very short-term funds (federal funds) supplied and demanded and thus affecting the federal funds rate. By targeting this at a low rate, they can encourage borrowing and thus economic activity; or the reverse by raising the rate. Like any interest rate, there are a nominal and a real value defined as described above. Further, there is a concept called the \\"equilibrium real federal funds rate\\" (r*, or \\"r-star\\"), alternatively called the \\"natural rate of interest\\" or the \\"neutral real rate\\", which is the \\"level of the real federal funds rate, if allowed to prevail for several years, [that] would place economic activity at its potential and keep inflation low and stable.\\" There are various methods used to estimate this amount, using tools such as the Taylor Rule. It is possible for this rate to be negative.U.S. Federal Reserve-Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson Jr. October 29, 2004 Negative real interest rates The real interest rate solved from the Fisher equation is :\\\\frac{1 + i}{1 + \\\\pi} - 1 = r If there is a negative real interest rate, it means that the inflation rate is greater than the nominal interest rate. If the Federal funds rate is and the inflation rate is , then the borrower would gain of every dollar borrowed per year. :\\\\frac{1 + 0.02}{1 + 0.1} - 1 = -0.0727 Negative real interest rates are an important factor in government fiscal policy. Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest rates on government debt, meaning the inflation rate is greater than the interest rate paid on the debt.Saint Louis Federal Reserve (2012) \\"5-Year Treasury Inflation-Indexed Security, Constant Maturity\\" FRED Economic Data chart from government debt auctions (the x-axis at y=0 represents the inflation rate over the life of the security) Such low rates, outpaced by the inflation rate, occur when the market believes that there are no alternatives with sufficiently low risk, or when popular institutional investments such as insurance companies, pensions, or bond, money market, and balanced mutual funds are required or choose to invest sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge against risk.David Wessel (August 8, 2012) \\"When Interest Rates Turn Upside Down\\" Wall Street Journal (full text ) Lawrence Summers stated that at such low rates, government debt borrowing saves taxpayer money, and improves creditworthiness.Lawrence Summers (June 3, 2012) \\"Breaking the negative feedback loop\\" ReutersMatthew Yglesias (May 30, 2012) \\"Why Are We Collecting Taxes?\\" Slate In the late 1940s through the early 1970s, the US and UK both reduced their debt burden by about to of GDP per decade by taking advantage of negative real interest rates, but there is no guarantee that government debt rates will continue to stay so low.Carmen M.

He was convicted of the August 5, 1997 kidnapping, sexual assault and murder of 9-year-old Jennifer Lee Gravell. Crime On the night of August 4, 1997, there was a barbecue in the neighborhood of Ozona, Texas where Gravell and White both lived. Some time between 10:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. Gravell went to the home of White, who lived two houses down the street from her. She was looking for someone to go for a ride with. He kidnapped her and took her in his truck to a rest area out of the city. There he sexually assaulted her, but she resisted, so White bound her arms behind her back with electrical tape and gagged her with a sock. He would later admit to penetrating her with his finger. He fled the rest area with Gravell after another car arrived. After taking her to another location he killed her by repeatedly striking her head with a tire iron. He dumped her body behind a water tank in a field outside of town. Trials and appeals Allan B. Polunsky Unit houses the State of Texas death row for men. After witnesses reported they had seen White leave his home with a young girl in the passenger seat of his truck, he was arrested and immediately confessed to the crime. He told police where Gravell's body could be found. In a trash can at White's home, underpants, sandals, and a ball of electrical tape with her hair in it were found. On August 15 he was indicted for her capital murder. After being found guilty of Gravell's capital murder on June 10, 1999, he was sentenced to death during the separate penalty phase of the trial on June 14.

As with all death sentences in Texas, it was automatically appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which on January 31, 2001 upheld the sentence and conviction. White appealed for writ of habeas corpus to the trial court, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and U.S. district court. All were denied. He also filed a motion for a certificate of appealability, which was likewise denied by various courts including the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In October 2005, his appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari was denied. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 6-0 on November 1 to recommend that Governor Rick Perry deny a 90-day stay or a commutation to life imprisonment, which Perry obliged. It was revealed during the penalty phase of the trial that White had forced his own daughter to perform oral sex on him while penetrating her with his finger when she was 12 years old. He also offered her $50 per week to perform sexual favors for him. When White was between the ages of 10 and 12 he molested a preschool aged relative. Witnesses also said that he would hold parties for teenagers in the area at which he provided alcohol, and where he would grope girls' breasts. White blamed alcoholism for his actions.

The band's music is notable for its imagery based in nature, cerebral yet intimate melodic songs, as well as Meiburg's vocals.  History  = Early years = In 1999, Okkervil River band members Jonathan Meiburg and Will Sheff founded Shearwater as an outlet for quieter songs on which they were collaborating. The band's name comes from the shearwater, a tribe of seabirds related to petrels and albatrosses. Meiburg, who holds a master's degree in geography with a focus on ornithology, picked the name mostly for the sound of the word. Shearwater's debut, The Dissolving Room, introduced Kim Burke on upright bass; shortly after, drummer and vibraphonist Thor Harris joined the band. The addition of multi-instrumentalist Howard Draper plus tours and support dates with The Mountain Goats, Akron/Family and Blonde Redhead brought them exposure. Shearwater continued to produce music under this lineup in Everybody Makes Mistakes (2002) and Winged Life (2004), as well as the Thieves EP (2005). In May 2006, Shearwater released Palo Santo, their fourth full-length album and last to be released on Misra Records, to much acclaim from critics and fans. The song \\"Red Sea, Black Sea,\\" was featured as an NPR Song of the Day. NPR's Stephen Thompson subsequently named Palo Santo as the best album of 2006. Although Sheff appeared as an instrumentalist for the recording of Palo Santo, the album's songs were composed and sung entirely by Meiburg, as the band felt that the songs that Meiburg had written were best suited for the project. Sheff then left the band to concentrate on other projects. = Matador records = Midway through the tour for Palo Santo, the band was notified by Misra Records that they would be unable to continue to distribute Shearwater's music. Meiburg personally emailed the owner of Matador Records, Gerard Cosloy, who subsequently signed Shearwater to a multi-album deal. On April 10, 2007, Shearwater released a two-disc edition of Palo Santo which featured five re-recorded tracks, remastered versions of the other six tracks, as well as a bonus disc of outtakes from the original sessions. Meiburg had felt that the original Palo Santo suffered from \\"murkiness\\", and could be improved upon in the studio. Matador Records released the album Rook on June 3, 2008. On the tour that followed, Shearwater opened for Clinic and later Coldplay. Additional touring accompanists were added at that time: Jordan Geiger of Hospital Ships and Minus Story (on cornet, synthesizer, and percussion) and Kevin Schneider of Black Before Red (on keyboard, bass, and guitar) replaced Howard Draper. On February 23, 2010, Shearwater released their sixth album, The Golden Archipelago, which the band produced with John Congleton. The band toured extensively behind the record in 2010, with an international tours in the spring (with Wye Oak and Hospital Ships opening) and additional U.S. dates in the fall (with special guest Damien Jurado). The Golden Archipelago concluded the band's Island Arc trilogy, a project also encompassing Palo Santo and Rook. On November 6, 2010, the band released an instrumental album, Shearwater is Enron, via Bandcamp. The album was recorded in the spring of 2010 and includes live material recorded at a performance under the pseudonym \\"Enron.\\" It introduces some textures not traditionally associated with the band, such as electronic drum tracks and squalling guitar rock. Members of Wye Oak and Hospital Ships assist on the live tracks. = Sub Pop records = In February 2012, a new full-length album called Animal Joy was released. It was Shearwater's first record with Sub Pop Records. The record signaled a new chapter for the band after the conclusion of the Island trilogy, as the album included more rock elements. Following the release of the album, the band opened for the North American tour of Sharon Van Etten. In 2013, Fellow Travelers was released on Sub Pop, a Shearwater album consisting entirely of cover songs by bands that Shearwater had toured with. Each band that was covered on the album was also invited to play on the album, under the condition that they could not play on their own song. The band's most recent record Jet Plane and Oxbow was released on Sub Pop January 22, 2016. Frequent collaborator, producer Danny Reisch, worked on the album, as did composer Brian Reitzell, Wye Oak's Jenn Wasner, drummer Cully Symington, Howard Draper, and regular band members Jesca Hoop, Lucas Oswald, and Abram Shook.

It was a religious outpost established by Spanish Catholic Franciscans, to spread Christianity among the local Native Americans. History Isleta Pueblo is the name of two pueblos of the ancient Tiwa (Spanish: Tigua) tribe, connected culturally and by language to other tribes of the Tanoan language family. Older historians thought they were related distantly to Shoshonean peoples. The San Agustin de la Isleta Mission was founded on the older pueblo, on the west bank of the Rio Grande about 13 miles (21 km) south of Albuquerque. The original Isleta (i.e. islet) was so named by the Spaniards from its position on a tongue of land projecting into the stream; the native name, Shiewhibak, seems to refer to a knife used in connection with a certain ceremonial foot race. The village was first entered by the Spanish conquistador Francisco V√°squez de Coronado in 1540. In 1582-3 Espejo (q.v.) visited the pueblo while trying to ascertain the fate of Father Rodriguez and two other Franciscan missionaries, who had been murdered a year earlier by native people in the vicinity. The Franciscan friar Juan de Salas came to New Mexico with Alonso de Benavides in 1622. Salas probably built the San Antonio \\"convent\\" at Isleta around 1629 or 1630. At a later period, the mission received many refugees from outlying pueblos abandoned because of Apache raids, By the outbreak of the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, it may have numbered 2000 people. The numerous Spanish settlers resisted the revolt with few casualties. They burned down the pueblo. The Tiwa accompanied some of the Spanish colonists, moving south to El Paso, Texas to the Ysleta Mission del Sur. In 1692-3, Vargas reconquered the Pueblo country. The Crown allowed mission work to resume. In approximately 1710, the original pueblo was reoccupied by the Isleta people. A new mission was established there under the name of San Agust√≠n. With the growth of the Spanish settler population, the Native American missions decreased in importance. In 1780-1, one-third of the Pueblo population was swept away by a smallpox epidemic. The Spanish abandoned most of the missions at that time. San Agustin continued to operate the Pueblo of Isleta under Spanish and then Mexican rule for fifty years longer. After the region was acquired by the United States, whose mainstream population was then Protestant, the Catholic church became nearly secular. Father Anton Docher arrived from Belgium in the late 19th century and was assigned to the Pueblo of Isleta after several years in the region. In 1923, he undertook a major remodeling of the Isleta mission, adding prominent French-style gothic spires on the adobe walls.Christopher Vecsey. On the Padres' Trail. University of Notre Dame Press, 1996, p. 182. The flat roof was replaced by a sloping one to avoid the water leaks, which frequently damaged the altar.Guggino, Patty. \\"Los Lentes\\". New Mexico State Record Center and Archives. In the late 20th century, the mission church was restored to its original structure. \\"The Padre of Isleta\\" spent 34 years (1891‚Äì1925) serving the community in Isleta; he was buried inside the church near the altar.

Panchala is a country mentioned in the Mahabharata in the northwest Uttar Pradesh. However, there are also traditions that place the Mahabharata regions in western Punjab and southern Kashmir. Scholar Dineshchandra Sircar has analysed the geography described in the Shakti‚Äêsangama Tantra, where this is indeed the case. Scholar M. A. Stein believes that the concept of deity must have been translated into that of a Pir after the region was Islamised. Peaks of the range Deo Tibba () and Indrasan () are two important peaks at the eastern end of the mountain range. They can be approached from both the Parvati-Beas Valley (Kulu District), Upper Belt of Chamba Himachal Pradesh and the Chandra (Upper Chenab) Valley (Lahaul and Spiti District) in Himachal Pradesh. The hill station of Gulmarg in Kashmir lies in this range.Pir Panjal Range (mountain system, Asia) ‚Äì Britannica Online Encyclopedia Passes Haji Pir Pass (altitude ) on the western Pir Panjal range on the road between Poonch and Uri is in disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir and falls towards Pakistan off the Line of Control. The Pir Panjal Pass (also called Peer Ki Gali) connects the Kashmir valley with Rajouri and Poonch via the Mughal Road. It is the highest point of the Mughal Road at and lies to the south west of the Kashmir Valley. The nearest town to the pass in the Kashmir valley is Shopian. The Pir Panjal region witnessed massive killings of its inhabitants in 1947 by Dogra forces which lead the region to be divided between India and pakistan Pir Panjal range as seen from Banihal, Jammu and Kashmir The Banihal pass () lies at the head of the Jhelum River at the southern end of the Kashmir Valley. Banihal and Qazigund lie on either side of the pass. The Sinthan pass connects Jammu and Kashmir with Kishtwar. Rohtang La (altitude ) is a mountain pass on the eastern Pir Panjal range connecting Manali in the Kullu Valley to Keylong in the Lahaul Valley. Tunnels =Jawahar Tunnel= The Jawahar Tunnel is a long tunnel through Pir Panjal mountain under the Banihal pass connects Banihal with Qazigund on the other side of the mountain. The Jawahar Tunnel was named after the first Prime Minister of India was constructed in early 1950s and commissioned in December 1956 to ensure snow- free passage throughout the year. It is at elevation of about . It was designed for 150 vehicles per day but now used by more than 7,000 vehicles per day.Beacon Light in the Tunnel Therefore, a new wider and longer tunnel has been planned at a lower elevation. =Banihal Qazigund Road Tunnel= Construction of a new long twin-tube Banihal Qazigund Road Tunnel started in 2011. The new tunnel is at a lower elevation than the existing Jawahar tunnel and, when completed, would reduce the road distance between Banihal and Qazigund by . It would also be less prone to snow avalanche as it will be at a lower elevation. =Atal Tunnel= The Atal Tunnel is being built under the Rohtang Pass in the eastern Pir Panjal range of the Himalayas on the Leh- Manali Highway. With length, the tunnel will be the second longest road tunnel in India and is expected to reduce the distance between Manali and Keylong by about . The tunnel is at elevation whereas the Rohtang pass is at elevation. Lying on the Manali-Leh axis, this is one of the two routes to Ladakh. =Banihal Railway Tunnel= The Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel, an railway tunnel, passes through the Pir Panjal Range in Jammu and Kashmir. It connects Quazigund and Banihal and is a part of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla railway project. The tunnel was commissioned on 26 June 2013 for regular service.

He served 13 years, one month, and six days in prison from 1989 to 2002 for theft and arson, having robbed and firebombed businesses owned by Asians in Western Australia. In the late 1980s it was revealed van Tongeren's father was of part-Javanese (Indonesian) ancestry. Nevertheless, Van Tongeren resumed anti-Asian activities upon his release in 2002, leading to further convictions, in 2006.  Biography  Peter Van Tongeren was born in the Netherlands in 1947 to a father of Dutch- Javanese descent, Rudi, and an Australian mother, Stella. The family later migrated to Australia. He joined the Australian army and saw action in Vietnam in 1971. Following his military service he travelled throughout Australia from 1979 to 1983 associating with a variety of far-right groups such as the South Australia League of Rights, the Tasmanian branch of the Anglo-Saxon Keltic Society (ASKS), Sydney based National Action (NA) neo-Nazi group, and the Los Angeles-based neo-Nazi American Worker's Party.  Australian Nationalist Movement  Van Tongeren's involvement with the Sydney based National Action (NA) neo-Nazi group led to him running, unsuccessfully, for the Senate in the 1984 election on an independent ticket, attaining 1,077 votes (0.13%). He later left the group to form his own organisation, the Australian Nationalist Movement (ANM) in April 1985. ANM's initial actions involved an extensive flyer-distribution campaign in Perth of more than 400,000 photocopied posters. The crude posters and fliers bore repetitive messages that included phrases such as \\"No Asians\\", \\"White Revolution The Only Solution\\", \\"Coloured Immigration: Trickle Is Now A Flood\\" and \\"Asians Out Or Racial War\\" and brought the organisation to the attention of the public. ANM is believed to have had approximately 100 loosely-affiliated members by the mid-1980s. By 1988, ANM turned towards identifying with international neo-Nazi ideology with public expressions of Antisemitism and holocaust denial. = Commencement of criminal activities =  February 1988 ‚Äì August 1989  ANM's criminal activity may have commenced in February 1988 when a member of the group's home was arsoned in a failed attempt at insurance fraud. ANM then turned towards arsoning and fire-bombing Asian-owned businesses with the intention of intimidating Asians and inciting a race war. Between September 1988 and May 1989, five restaurants were arsoned, and one was bombed leading to community tensions, vigilantism, and a decline in Asian investment. Short on cash, ANM turned to theft, stealing an estimated $800,000 in goods during a series of warehouse robberies. They also bashed a left-wing anti-racist campaigner in a home invasion. A tip-off to the police led them to the location where ANM's stolen goods where being stored and the arrest of van Tongeren's associates, Willey and John van Blitterswyk. Willey turned informant and collected recordings of the group's leadership leading to their arrest in August 1989. Following the arrest, two other members of ANM suspected fellow member David Locke to be a police informant and lured him into a Park in the suburb of Gosnells where he was beaten with iron bars and his throat slit. The murder trial of the two men in June 1990 led to the trial of van Tongeren and the five other ANM members being aborted due to the media atmosphere at the time. At a second trial in August 1990, six members of ANM were found guilty, with van Tongeren was sentenced to 18 years on 53 counts. Van Tongeren was sentenced in absentia due to a hunger strike that commenced a few days into the trial. The two men who murdered David Locke received life sentences.Judge D. Hammond, Sentencing of Jack Van Tongeren, 20 September 1990, p. 68  Australian Nationalist Worker's Union  = Release from prison = Van Tongeren expressed no remorse following his release from Karnet Prison Farm in September 2002. His first public statement accused the Western Australian premier Geoff Gallop and Attorney General Jim McGinty of pandering to the Asian minority. He also denied being a terrorist. He soon formed a successor organisation to the ANM called the Australian Nationalist Worker's Union, and expressed interest in seeking election. Banned under Western Australian law from running for state parliament, Van Tongeren was free to run for a seat in the federal parliament. This led to the Attorney-General calling on the Commonwealth Government to tighten laws on the eligibility of convicted criminals. = Resumption of racist attacks = In February 2004 three Chinese restaurants in Perth were firebombed in the early hours of the morning. Other synagogues and Asian-owned shops where plastered with posters and daubed with swastikas. Van Tongeren denied responsibility, instead claiming that the attacks must be the actions of angry Australians reacting against \\"Asian gangs and African crime.\\" It was later reported that Van Tongeren instigated the attacks to drum up publicity for his book, The ANM Story. Western Australian police launched \\"Operation Atlantic\\" in response to the attacks, leading to the arrest of five men involved in the attacks. The police also identified a plot to harm Jim McGinty and his family, two police officers and an ethnic community leader, and raided Van Tongeren's home. These threats led to Jim McGinty cancelling meetings in Adelaide and returning to Perth. In August 2004 a week-long man-hunt for Van Tongeren ended with police receiving a tip-off that located him at an RSL club. Van Tongeren claimed to be innocent, and that he was only hiding from the police out of fear that they would shoot him. Following these arrests, the racist graffiti attacks around the Perth CBD ceased. In February 2006, Van Tongeren, out on bail pending his trial, failed to report to police and was believed to be at large and travelling with former ANM member Matthew Billing. On 23 March 2006, a letter was received by staff at ABC Television Studios, purporting to be from Van Tongeren. It claimed that charges against him were a conspiracy created by the WA Government, and indicated that they would need to be dropped by Attorney-General Jim McGinty, in order for Van Tongeren to return from hiding. A month later Van Tongeren and his co-accused Matthew Billing were found and arrested in the Boddington area south-east of Perth. Both men once again faced the courts over the 2004 arson plots. During a hearing on 2 November, Van Tongeren collapsed, was taken to hospital, and later used a wheelchair. Van Tongeren was released from jail on the condition that he leave Western Australia. He currently resides in the eastern states. In 2007 the ANM/ANWU was reported to have been disbanded.\\"Supremacist leader in court\\" theage.com.au. AAP. 7 August 2004.

He was born in 1935 at village Sisauli in Muzaffarnagar District of Uttar Pradesh. He was President of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, a farmers' movement, and was revered as the farmers' \\"second messiah\\" after the Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh. Tikait died in Muzaffarnagar on 15 May 2011 from bone cancer at the age of 75.  Title  The hereditary title of Tikait was apparently conferred on his family by the seventh-century emperor Harshavardhan. Since then the title has been transferred to the eldest son of the family. Tikait had become the chaudhary of Baliyan Khap, at the age of eight after his father's death.  Leadership  Tikait first became a significant figure in 1987 when he organised a campaign in Muzaffarnagar demanding the waiving of electricity bills for farmers. = Boat Club Rally = Tikait's most spectacular show was at Delhi's Boat Club lawns in 1988 when nearly five lakh farmers from western Uttar Pradesh occupied the entire stretch from Vijay Chowk to India Gate. Delhi's power elite held out until the stench became too much to bear and after a week, the Rajiv Gandhi government bowed to his 35-point charter of demands that included higher prices for sugarcane and the waiving of electricity and water charges for farmers. = Lucknow, 1990 = In July 1990, Tikait protested in Lucknow with over two lakh farmers, urging the Government of Uttar Pradesh to concede to the farmers' demand for higher sugarcane prices and heavy rebates in electricity dues. The pressure tactics worked and the then Janata Dal-controlled government bowed to the demands. = Lucknow, 1992 = In 1992, Tikait was back in Lucknow to stage a month-long sit-in panchayat in pursuance of his demand for writing off farmers' loans up to Rs 10,000. The same year, he launched a Farmers Land Compensation Movement in Ghaziabad, seeking higher compensation towards the acquired land of farmers. = Bijnore, 2008 - Remarks against Mayawati = Tikait was arrested on several occasions, the last being on 2 April 2008 for allegedly making derogatory and caste-based remarks against Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati at a rally in Bijnore on 30 March 2008. It took a contingent of 6,000 armed policemen to lay a siege around his village for his arrest. He was released only after tendering an apology to the Chief Minister.Tikait arrested  'Calling Maya names was a mistake' When things were back to normal, Mayawati described Tikait, in a condolence message, as a \\"true and committed leader of farmers\\".  Opposition to marriage within gotras  Tikait had a firm belief in his caste's traditions and culture. He opposed the Supreme Court decision that marriages between people from the same gotra were valid. \\"We live by a moral code where honour has to be protected at any cost. Same gotra marriages are incestuous, No society would accept it. Why do you expect us to do so? Incest violates maryada (honour) and villagers would kill or be killed to protect their maryada,\\" he had said in a TV interview.

It is similar in game mechanics, if not exact rules, to Russian pyramid, but using typical American pool equipment. The game probably takes its name from the fanciful notion that things might be done backwards on the other side of the world (cf. Chinese fire drill, etc.). Play The balls are set up as they would be for a regular game of eight-ball. The first player by shooting the cue ball into the as one normally would. A ball must be ed, or two must strike s, for the break to be legal. If a ball is pocketed, the breaking player shoots again. Even if a ball is pocketed on the break shot, the table is still , meaning neither player has yet claimed the or groups of balls. To determine which object balls one is playing, one must pocket an object ball with a legal shot. From this point forward, balls are pocketed by striking a chosen object ball with the cue stick and causing that ball to contact the cue ball and () off it into a specific pocket by legal means . Legal shots For a shot to be legal (i.e., not a ), the shooting player must the pocket where the object ball to be shot is intended to drop. The object ball that is shot must strike the stationary cue ball before touching any other ball on the table. One or more cushions may be struck by the shot object ball before contact with the cue ball. After first contact with the cue ball, the shot ball may (as with straight pool, ten-ball, and professional eight-ball) strike other balls or cushions before dropping into the called pocket. A player who legally pockets a shot then shoots again (and again if succeeding again); otherwise, play passes to the other player. When all of a player's object balls have been pocketed, the 8 ball is the final . Fouls If a player makes a foul (fault, illegal shot), that player's turn ends. The opponent may elect to play the balls where they lie, or may choose to move the cue ball to the , but only if it is unoccupied by another ball. This center-spotting option is not always permitted, so players must agree about whether that rule will apply before play begins. =Major fouls= There are two major fouls that may invoke a penalty: one of the fouling player's pocketed balls (if any) must be pulled out and is placed on the , or if that is occupied, as close as possible to this spot following an imaginary line perpendicular to, and moving toward, the from the foot spot. (In the unlikely event this entire line is occupied, the ball is spotted in front of the foot spot on the same line.) #If the object ball is in contact with the cue ball when the shot begins, the player must hit away from the cue and strike it by banking off a cushion; the cue ball may not move before the object ball touches the cushion or it is a foul. #When the cue ball falls in a pocket or leaves the table, it is called a . In addition to the penalty ball being spotted on or near the foot spot, the cue ball is placed on the , or as close as possible on a line toward the . An object ball cannot, of course, be pulled from a that captures pocketed object balls, or when the player has no pocketed balls to pull. In such a case, a major foul is treated as a minor foul. Penalties are not \\"owed\\" when a player has no currently pocketed balls (i.e., in the advent of a major foul, a player with zero balls down does not have to pull and spot the next one the player pockets in a later round). There are also several 8-ball fouls that constitute immediate loss of game. =Minor fouls= There are several minor fouls: # Failure to strike the cue ball with the shot object ball before the latter contacts any other ball. # Failure to hit any ball at all with the shot object ball. # Pocketing the shot object ball in a pocket other than that which was called (it is spotted like a pulled ball, above). # Shooting the shot object ball directly into a pocket without contacting the cue ball with it first (it is spotted like a pulled ball, above). # Causing any object ball to fly off the table (it is spotted like a pulled ball, above). If it was not the shot object ball itself, whether to treat this as a foul varies in informal play. # Failure to cause at least one ball to touch a cushion, or at least one object ball to fall into a pocket legally, contact between the shot object ball and the cue ball. This \\"soft-shot\\" rule is sometimes dropped in informal play. # Inadvertently moving any ball, e.g. with the hand or the side of the cue. If this happens, the opponent elects whether to move it back or leave it where it has come to rest. Treatment of this as a foul is often dropped in informal play, especially if the inadvertent movement was minor and did not affect the shot. If a foul results in the pocketing of one or more of the opponent's balls, any such ball remains in the pocket. Any of the shooting player's own balls pocketed as a result of the foul must be pulled out and spotted, like a pulled ball (above), and this does not count as the pulled ball in the advent of a major foul. Failure to succeed in pocketing the shot object ball into the called pocket, during a shot that was otherwise legal, is not a foul but simply a miss. Aside from a major foul, knocking balls off the table, and pocketing one's own ball on a foul, a missed or foul shot does not result in any ball being returned to the table. Incidentally pocketing an object ball (of either player) that is not the shot object ball has no consequences if the shot was legal; it is not a foul on its own, nor does it enable the shooter to continue shooting if the object ball that was directly shot was not legally pocketed in the called pocket. Winning and losing The winner of the game is the one who successfully pockets the 8 ball with a legal shot, or the opponent of one who loses due to one of the 8-ball fouls described next. Pocketing the 8 ball through any foul shot (including in a pocket that was not called, when hitting some other ball with it before the cue ball, etc.), pocketing it when one has not yet pocketed all of one's regular object balls, or knocking the 8 ball off the table, each constitute a loss of game. It is not permissible to pocket one's last remaining regular object ball and the 8 ball in the same shot. Scratching the cue ball into a pocket while shooting the 8 ball does not result in a loss of game if the 8 ball remains on the table; the cue ball is head-spotted, as described above, and the shot is treated as a major foul, with a one-pulled-ball penalty. This rule is sometimes dropped in informal play, with a scratch while attempting the 8 ball considered a loss of game. Another variant is to treat a player's third such scratch while attempting the 8 during the same game as a loss of game (and any other foul while shooting the 8 ball may, in this variant, also count toward that three-fault countdown). Naturally, players must agree on which rule is to be applied before playing. Variations In addition to treating some rules as optional (as noted above), the rules peculiar to any variant of eight-ball can also be adapted to the so-called Chinese version, including ball-in-hand on fouls (players must agree whether it is the cue ball or an object ball which can be taken in-hand), ball-in-hand behind the only, bank-the-8, last- pocket, 1-and-15-in-the-sides, the fixed object ball order of eight-ball rotation, etc. Such adaptations may drop the major-foul penalty rule, to more closely mirror regular eight-ball as familiar in the region, simply with cue- ball-at-object-ball shooting reversed.

A follow up album, He Will Have His Way, featuring male artists, was released in 2010. Background The album takes its name from Neil Finn's single \\"She Will Have Her Way\\" from Try Whistling This, however the song does not appear on this album, nor does any other from Neil Finn's solo career. The album is a mixture of songs previously recorded for prior releases (such as \\"Better Be Home Soon\\") and some recorded specifically for the project (\\"Distant Sun,\\" \\"Fall at Your Feet,\\" \\"Stuff and Nonsense\\" etc.). A special edition of the album was released with a second disc containing all of the original versions of the songs remastered. Its cover was slightly redesigned with a pale blue instead of a dark blue background and subtle, added background elements. Commercial performance She Will Have Her Way peaked at #3 on the Australian Albums Chart and reached #4 in New Zealand. In total, it spent 15 weeks in the Australian top 40.\\"She Will Have Her Way ‚Äì The Songs Of Neil and Tim Finn (Album)\\" charts.org.nz Differences to original versions Some songs have distinct differences to the original versions, while some maintain the general feel of the original. *In \\"Distant Sun,\\" Fraser omits the bridge lyric \\"Like a Christian fearing vengeance from above,\\" presumably due to her Christian faith. *In \\"Six Months in a Leaky Boat,\\" much of the song is omitted, particularly the lower tempo parts of the song. *\\"Four Seasons\\" was originally entitled \\"Four Seasons In One Day.\\" *\\"I Hope I Never\\" is much slower. *\\"Persuasion\\" is converted from a \\"natural\\" folk rock song into a \\"synthetic\\" pop-rock song, and changed the gender references to neutral as opposed to male (e.g. \\"I will always be a man who's open to persuasion\\" was changed to \\"I will always be someone who's open to persuasion\\"). *\\"Charlie\\" converted from a sombre ballad into an uptempo rock song. *\\"Into Temptation\\" originally had the line \\"You and your new blue dress,\\" however Geyer changed this line to \\"You and your deep blue eyes\\" and converted the rock ballad into a RnB-ballad instead.

It has one episode which is made up of two separate and unconnected parts, the title story and the fifth story in the book, \\"Trophies Belong in the Bedroom\\". It was animated by Phoenix Entertainment. The whole OVA is 30 minutes long and, unlike the original manga, is much more explicit in nature, giving it an R-18/X/NC-17 rating in both the USA and Japan. Part 1 Sensitive Pornograph The story begins with Seiji Yamada (), a young sh≈çnen manga artist, who develops an affair with a fellow manga artist, who writes hentai, named Sono Hanasaki (), who is also his favorite artist. The plot-line develops from Yamada mistaking Sono for a girl. After having discovered him to be a boy, Seiji still falls in love with him, and they have an intimate affair. Seiji becomes distraught when he learns of Sono's past tendencies of sleeping around, and for a time the two become separated. However, they eventually reconcile after Seiji learns of the emotional damage Sono has suffered as a result of being abandoned and used only for sex and his body. This part is longer with a more romantic tone than the other. There is quite a large amount of humor while still containing graphic sex and sexual positions throughout the entire story, available in both censored and uncensored versions. Also in some versions, the order of the stories is reversed. Part 2 \\"House of the Little White Rabbit\\" The second part begins with Ueno, a student in college, who works part-time as a pet sitter, receiving an assignment to take care of a rabbit. Upon arriving at the specified address, looking for a rabbit named Aki-chan, he finds that there is no rabbit. Instead he discovers a young man bound, naked, in a closet, apparently a sex slave to the man who hired Ueno. Aki-chan is chagrined to realize that his lover-master has created a twist on a sexual thrill situation for himself ‚Äì he has sent strangers to Aki-chan for sex before, but tricking someone into the apartment was something new. Aki-chan knows his master wants to watch from a distance while Aki-chan has sex with the duped Ueno. Explaining that his master will get mad if things don't go his way, and may even hurt Ueno, Aki-chan persuades him to have sex to keep his master happy. In a car outside the building, the master, smirking, watches the two via a hidden camera. Initially just expecting Ueno to lie back and allow him to do all the work (something Aki-chan seems accustomed to), he is surprised when Ueno reciprocates and takes the active role. After making passionate love and even sharing a kiss, Aki-chan then encourages Ueno to leave before his master returns. After Ueno reluctantly leaves and his master shows up, Aki-chan angrily announces that he thought himself open-minded, but has had enough of the manipulative head games. At some unspecified time later, Ueno recalls that he quit his job (or was fired, depending on some versions). He then encounters Aki-chan at his school, which surprises him. Aki-chan tells him that he defied his master, was severely beaten and thrown out, and has since enrolled himself at Ueno's school. The scene ends with hints that the two may continue their relationship.

It was opened as a toll road in 1971 and classified as a state road two years later. The tolls were removed in 1990. It was named after Pineda, a former village east of Suntree on U.S. Route 1 (US 1). With interchanges at US 1 (SR 5), South Tropical Trail (County Road 3, CR 3), and South Patrick Drive (SR 513), the Pineda Causeway is (along with SR A1A) the primary access for Patrick Air Force Base and the southern end of Merritt Island. From US 1 to the eastern terminus, it is part of the Indian River Lagoon Scenic Highway system. Route description Pineda Causeway from US 1 The Pineda Causeway Extension begins at an interchange with Interstate 95. From I-95, the Pineda Causeway Extension passes between developments to its north and south. After an intersection with a local road, the route curves to the northeast and later resumes its eastward course, reaching Wickham Road. The route turns to the east and moves across the Florida East Coast Railway, via a partially completed overpass. East of the railway, the route crosses below US 1\\\\. The eastbound lane has an exit ramp that connects to both directions of US 1; in contrast, the westbound lane has a dedicated exit for both US 1 northbound and a loop to US 1 southbound. The road continues to the east, crossing a small inlet and a small island before ascending over the Indian River with twin bridges. At the eastern end of the bridges, the route again crosses a small island and inlet before reaching a narrow portion of Merritt Island. There, the causeway intersects with CR 3\\\\. The route crosses a series of islands, forming another twin set of bridges over the Banana River. After reaching land for the final time, the route enters South Patrick Shores and passes to the south of Patrick Air Force Base. It has a partial interchange with SR 513, with only an eastbound exit and a westbound entrance. After passing north of a housing development, the causeway ends at an intersection with SR A1A. Along the causeway east of the extension, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) estimated in 2011 that 37,500 cars drove on the route each day. According to the Space Coast Transportation Planning Organization, 30,245 cars drove on the route between U.S. 1 and I-95. As part of a pilot project, FDOT has painted the shoulders as bike lanes, thus allowing cyclists on a controlled-access highway that had been closed to them.Space Coast Daily, State Completes Bicycle Lane On Pineda Causeway, August 2, 2013 History Due to high traffic involving the Kennedy Space Center and Patrick Air Force Base in eastern Brevard County, local politicians in the early 1960s petitioned the United States Bureau of Public Roads for federal funding in creating a new causeway across the Banana River, between the Eau Gallie Causeway and SR 520\\\\. Although the federal agency declined twice due to low traffic projections, local officials maintained the need for the proposed causeway. In November 1969, after FDOT opened bids for various state construction projects, the Gregg, Gibson & Gregg Inc. put out a $7.7 million estimate to build the causeway from US 1 to the eastern shore of the Banana River. Ultimately, the original Pineda Causeway was opened in 1972, costing about $7 million to construct. In the previous year, the route's interchanges with US 1 and CR 3, as well as the bridges, were completed. In 1972, the interchange with SR 513 was finished. On May 31, 1973, FDOT classified the bridge and causeway as State Route 404. Initially it was a toll road, which funded the road's maintenance. However, FDOT agreed in 1989 to remove the fee and pay for maintenance. In June 1990, workers removed the toll along the Pineda Causeway, along with the Bennett Causeway to the north, at a cost of $745,000. The interchange with U.S. 1, which was first built in 1971, was reconstructed in 1997. In 1999, the route became part of the newly created Indian River Lagoon Scenic Highway, which was a series of roads around the Indian River Lagoon. In conjunction with a project to add additional lanes to I-95, FDOT authorized funding in March 2008 to create an interchange with an extension of the Pineda Causeway. The two projects were estimated to cost $202 million upon completion. On May 2, 2011, the interchange with I-95 opened. FDOT also authorized $10 million to complete the extension from the interchange to its original routing. The overall cost of the extension was estimated at $27 million, of which the remainder not financed by FDOT was paid by impact fee and gas tax. Groundbreaking for the extension occurred on December 14, 2007, and the project was finished in May 2011. This created a extension of the highway after decades of planning; once finished, it became a hurricane evacuation route. The project was expected to aid the local economy due to ease of travel from I-95 to the beach. In 2008, Brevard County commissioned a $400,000 study to create an overpass for the causeway over the Florida East Coast Railway line, located just west of US 1. In July 2018, FDOT began a $24 million construction project to build a bridge over the Florida East Coast Railway, at a height of , as well as to add a traffic signal for Holy Trinity Episcopal Academy. The eastbound bridge was finished on March 19, 2020. The overpass was named for Major General John Cleland, a local World War II veteran. The extension currently dead-ends just west of the I-95 interchange. This will eventually connect to Stadium Parkway / Lake Andrew Drive, and potentially as Orlando International Airport.

He served on the High Court of Australia for one month in 1913, making him the shortest-serving judge in the court's history. Piddington was born in Bathurst, New South Wales. He studied classics at the University of Sydney, and later combined his legal studies with teaching at Sydney Boys High School. Piddington was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1895, representing the Free Trade Party. He was defeated after a single term, and subsequently returned to his legal practice, becoming one of Sydney's best-known barristers. Piddington was sympathetic to the labour movement, and in April 1913 Andrew Fisher nominated him to the High Court as part of a court-packing attempt. His appointment was severely criticised, and he resigned a month later without ever sitting on the bench. Later in 1913, Piddington was made the inaugural chairman of the Inter- State Commission, serving until 1920. He was appointed King's Counsel in 1913, and remained a public figure into his seventies. Early life Piddington was born on 9 September 1862 in Bathurst, New South Wales. He was educated at Sydney Grammar School, and then studied at the University of Sydney. He graduated in 1883 with a Bachelor of Arts, winning the University Medal in Classics. He was appointed a vice-warden at the university's St. Paul's College in 1884, and from 1887 was a lecturer in English at the university. About this time he also started studying law. He was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1890. Piddington married Marion O'Reilly in 1896, who remained active in the social reform of liberal sex education and as a promoter of eugenics. Political career Piddington c. 1907 In 1895, Piddington was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the electoral district of Tamworth, defeating the former Premier of New South Wales Sir George Dibbs. In 1896, he married Louisa O'Reilly; their son Ralph became professor of anthropology at the University of Auckland. He was not a delegate to the second constitutional convention in 1897‚Äì1898, and campaigned against the proposed constitution, although supporting federation in general. He retired from politics in 1898. In 1910, Piddington was elected to the council of the University of Sydney. The following year, he was appointed as a Royal Commissioner by the Government of New South Wales to inquire into labour shortages, and was appointed a commissioner again in 1913 to inquire into industrial arbitration in New South Wales. During this time he continued to practise law and was employed at Sydney Boys High School.http://www.shsobu.org.au/wp-content/uploads/judges.pdf High Court appointment Piddington was one of four Justices appointed to the High Court in 1913. The bench had been expanded from five to seven justices that year, and foundation justice Richard O'Connor had died late in 1912. The Attorney- General Billy Hughes, under Prime Minister Andrew Fisher, took the opportunity to try to stack the court. The Fisher Labor government put forward a constitutional referendum in 1911, proposing to give the federal government increased power over corporations and industrial relations, and to allow it to nationalise monopolies. It was defeated in all states but Western Australia. Fisher held another referendum in 1913 on the same issues, but that was also defeated. In this context, Fisher and Hughes were looking for justices who would have a broad interpretation of the Constitution of Australia, particularly of Section 51, which divides powers between the federal and state governments. If the constitution was interpreted broadly, then the need for referendums might be circumvented. Hughes contacted Piddington's brother-in- law, poet and politician Dowell O'Reilly, to ask about Piddington's view on states' rights. O'Reilly was not sure, and contacted Piddington (who was arguing a case before the Privy Council in London at the time) by telegram. The message reached him in Port Said, Egypt on 2 February. Piddington replied: \\"In sympathy with supremacy of Commonwealth powers.\\" p80. Hughes then officially offered Piddington an appointment, which he accepted. Both the New South Wales and Victorian Bars, and the press, spoke out against Piddington's appointment. The Bulletin led a strong media campaign against Piddington. William Irvine refused to welcome Piddington as a judge on behalf of the Victorian Bar. Ultimately Piddington resigned from the High Court one month after his appointment, having never sat at the bench. Hughes, who had been widely criticised for trying to stack the court, labelled Piddington a coward after the incident, and called him a \\"panic-stricken boy\\". p82. Piddington was one of six justices of the High Court to have served in the Parliament of New South Wales, along with Edmund Barton, Richard O'Connor, Adrian Knox, Edward McTiernan and H. V. Evatt. Later life Piddington in 1927 after his appointment to the Industrial Commission of New South Wales In September 1913, Piddington was appointed as the chairman of the Interstate Commission by Joseph Cook, the new Commonwealth Liberal Party Prime Minister. It had been rumoured that Hughes would be appointed to that position, and it has been suggested that Cook appointed Piddington to spite Hughes, or to rebuke Hughes for turning on Piddington. Nevertheless, he remained Chairman until the legislation under which he and the other two commissioners had been appointed was invalidated by the High Court.. In 1919 he was made a Commissioner in both the Royal Commission on the Sugar Industry and the Royal Commission on the Basic Wage. [2009] NSW Bar Association News 62. In 1913 he was made a King's Counsel, and from 1926, he served as President of the Industrial Commission of New South Wales. He held that position until 1932, when following Governor of New South Wales Sir Philip Game's dismissal of the Lang government, Piddington resigned in protest, despite being just a few weeks short of being entitled to a pension. In 1934 he appeared in the High Court with Maurice Blackburn for Egon Kisch when he won his case to stay in Australia. and . In 1940, Piddington returned to the High Court as a plaintiff.. Two years earlier, he had been seriously injured when struck by a motorcycle while crossing Phillip Street in Sydney; he sued for negligence. Unsuccessful in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, he appealed to the High Court. Piddington won the appeal but was unsuccessful in the retrial in the Supreme Court.Graham, Morris 'Albert Bathurst Piddington', in Blackshield, Coper and Williams, (2000) Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia p 533 Piddington's memoirs, \\"Worshipful Masters\\" was published in 1929.

The name meant \\"half a byte\\" or \\"four bits.\\" Its slogan was \\"The Magazine for Apple II Enthusiasts.\\" Most of the articles incorporated the source code of a small to medium-sized utility, application program, or game (each written specifically for the magazine) and a detailed description of how it worked. The headquarters was in Lincoln, Massachusetts. History and profile The magazine was first published in January 1980 by Mike Harvey. Originally published eight times per year, by 1984 the magazine had attained a popularity that allowed it to become a monthly publication. It was published for more than twelve years; the July 1992 issue was the last. Since typing in the BASIC or hexadecimal listings could be error-prone, the magazine also published checksum tables that, with utilities available from the magazine, helped pinpoint the location of any errors in a reader's own typed-in copy. The programs were also available on disk for a small fee for those who did not want to spend the time to type them in. A technical highlight of Nibble was a regular column called Disassembly Lines, in which Dr. Sanford Mossberg presented assembly listings he had reverse-engineered from interesting parts of Applesoft BASIC and the DOS to illustrate how they worked. Later Mossberg turned his attention to the Apple IIGS and dissected its Toolbox and operating system as well. Omnibus editions of the best articles from each year's issues, dubbed Nibble Express, were published annually. The magazine also published other books that repurposed magazine material on various topics, such as games, personal finance programs, and \\"Apple secrets.\\" Mossberg's Disassembly Lines columns were also collected in four volumes. Harvey's publishing company, MicroSPARC (later MindCraft), published a number of Apple II programming utilities including an assembler and a BASIC-like set of macros for it. These were sold by mail-order from ads in the magazine. (Trivia: the company changed its name after Sun Microsystems bought the name MicroSPARC for a new line of processors.) A spinoff Macintosh publication, Nibble Mac, was first a section in Nibble and then was published separately. Like the original, Nibble Mac focused on hobbyist programming, notably HyperCard. Most of the Nibble material, including Nibble Mac, is now available again from the publisher through his Web site.

Background  Knnaird was the eldest son of Charles Kinnaird, 8th Lord Kinnaird, by Lady Olivia Laetitia Catherine FitzGerald third daughter of William FitzGerald, 2nd Duke of Leinster.  Political career  Kinnaird succeeded his father in the lordship of Kinnaird in 1826. This was a Scottish peerage and did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. However, in 1831 he was created Baron Rossie, of Rossie Priory in the County of Perth, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him a seat in the upper chamber of Parliament. In December 1839 he was appointed Master of the Buckhounds under Lord Melbourne, a post he held until the government fell in 1841. He was sworn of the Privy Council in early 1840. In 1857 he was made a Knight of the Thistle.leighrayment.com Knights of the Thistle Three years later he was created Baron Kinnaird, of Rossie in the County of Perth, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In contrast to the earlier barony, which was created with normal remainder to heirs male, this barony was created with special remainder to his younger brother, Arthur. Kinnaird later served as Lord Lieutenant of Perthshire from 1866 to 1878.leighrayment.com Peerage: Kilmaule to Kynnaird  Family  Lord Kinnaird married the Honourable Frances Anne Georgina Ponsonby, only daughter of William Ponsonby, 1st Baron de Mauley, at Great Canford, Dorset, on 14 December 1837.

Newman took up the term \\"post- anarchism\\" as a general term for political philosophies filtering 19th century anarchism through a post-structuralist lens, and later popularized it through his 2001 book From Bakunin to Lacan. Thus he rejects a number of concepts traditionally associated with anarchism, including essentialism, a \\"positive\\" human nature, and the concept of revolution. The links between poststructuralism and anarchism have also been developed by thinkers like Todd May and Lewis Call. Newman is currently Professor in Political Theory at Goldsmiths College, University of London. He received his B.A. from the University of Sydney, and his Ph.D in political science from the University of New South Wales. His work has been translated into Turkish, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese and Serbo-Croatian, and has been the subject of a number of debates amongst anarchist theorists and activists as well as academics.  Thought  Some of Newman's publications in recent times deal with Max Stirner, a German philosopher of the mid-19th century, author of the famous book Der Einzige und sein Eigentum (1845) (English translation: The Ego and Its Own, 1907). Newman regards Stirner as a key figure in developing a new radical critique of Western society. He calls Stirner a proto- poststructuralist, who on the one hand basically anticipated modern poststructuralists such as Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze, and Jacques Derrida, but on the other hand already transcended them, providing what they were unable to, namely paving the ground for a \\"non-essentialist\\" critique of present liberal capitalist society. Newman's interpretation of Stirner has received some degree of attention, including an endorsement by Ernesto Laclau, who provided a foreword to From Bakunin to Lacan.

Following the initial failure of his ballad opera The Beggar‚Äôs Wedding (Dublin, Smock Alley Theatre, 24 March 1729) - a work capitalising on the success of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera (1728) - he moved to London, where the work opened at the Haymarket on 29 May 1729. In an abbreviated form as Phebe, or The Beggar's Wedding it became highly successful, although it was not to be heard in Dublin before 1754. His fifth ballad opera, The Devil to Pay, or The Wives Metamorphos'd (1731) became the most successful ballad opera of the 18th century after The Beggar's Opera. A German translation as Der Teufel ist los, oder Die verwandelten Weiber (Berlin, 24 January 1743) strongly influenced the development of the German Singspiel. Coffey died in London and was buried in the St Clement Danes.

Cherlak, a typical small town - or a large village - in Western Siberia About 70% of Siberia's people live in cities. Novosibirsk is the largest city in Siberia, with a population of about 1.5 million, followed by Yekaterinburg (1.3 million, Urals), Omsk (1.1 million), Chelyabinsk (1.07 million, in the Urals), Krasnoyarsk (0.91 million), Barnaul (0.60 million), Irkutsk (0.59 million), Kemerovo (0.52 million), Tyumen (0.51 million), Tomsk (0.48 million), Nizhny Tagil (0.39 million, Urals), Kurgan (0.36 million), Ulan Ude (0.36 million), Chita (0.32 million).

Ethnicities and languages The vast majority of the Siberian population (over 95%) is Slavic and other Indo-European ethnicities, mainly Russians, Ukrainians, and Germans. Most non- Slavic groups are Turkic. Smaller linguistic groups are Mongols (ca. 600,000 speakers) Uralic (Samoyedic, Ugric; roughly 100,000 speakers), Manchu-Tungus (ca. 40,000 speakers), Chukotko-Kamchatkan (ca. 25,000 speakers), Eskimo‚ÄìAleut (some 2,000 speakers), the Yukaghir languages (highly endangered), and languages isolates Ket (but see below) and Nivkh. Mongolian, Turkic and Manchu-Tungus languages are sometimes taken together under the term Altaic. At one time Uralic and Altaic were believed to form the Ural‚ÄìAltaic group, though this theory has now been largely discarded. The proposed Uralo-Siberian family combines the Uralic family with the Yukaghir languages, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, and Eskimo‚ÄìAleut. These are more umbrella terms than accepted linguistic relationships. Ket has recently been linked with the Na-Dene languages into a Den√©‚ÄìYeniseian group; while not universally accepted a broad consensus in favor of the proposal has emerged.

They convert chemical energy into mechanical work by the hydrolysis of ATP. Flagellar rotation, however, is powered by a proton pump.  Cellular functions  The best prominent example of a motor protein is the muscle protein myosin which \\"motors\\" the contraction of muscle fibers in animals. Motor proteins are the driving force behind most active transport of proteins and vesicles in the cytoplasm. Kinesins and cytoplasmic dyneins play essential roles in intracellular transport such as axonal transport and in the formation of the spindle apparatus and the separation of the chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. Axonemal dynein, found in cilia and flagella, is crucial to cell motility, for example in spermatozoa, and fluid transport, for example in trachea.  Diseases associated with motor protein defects  The importance of motor proteins in cells becomes evident when they fail to fulfill their function. For example, kinesin deficiencies have been identified as the cause for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and some kidney diseases. Dynein deficiencies can lead to chronic infections of the respiratory tract as cilia fail to function without dynein. Numerous myosin deficiencies are related to disease states and genetic syndromes. Because myosin II is essential for muscle contraction, defects in muscular myosin predictably cause myopathies. Myosin is necessary in the process of hearing because of its role in the growth of stereocilia so defects in myosin protein structure can lead to Usher syndrome and non-syndromic deafness.  Cytoskeletal motor proteins  Motor proteins utilizing the cytoskeleton for movement fall into two categories based on their substrate: microfilaments or microtubules. Actin motors such as myosin move along microfilaments through interaction with actin, and microtubule motors such as dynein and kinesin move along microtubules through interaction with tubulin. There are two basic types of microtubule motors: plus-end motors and minus-end motors, depending on the direction in which they \\"walk\\" along the microtubule cables within the cell. = Actin motors =  Myosin  Myosins are a superfamily of actin motor proteins that convert chemical energy in the form of ATP to mechanical energy, thus generating force and movement. The first identified myosin, myosin II, is responsible for generating muscle contraction. Myosin II is an elongated protein that is formed from two heavy chains with motor heads and two light chains. Each myosin head contains actin and ATP binding site. The myosin heads bind and hydrolyze ATP, which provides the energy to walk toward the plus end of an actin filament. Myosin II are also vital in the process of cell division. For example, non-muscle myosin II bipolar thick filaments provide the force of contraction needed to divide the cell into two daughter cells during cytokinesis. In addition to myosin II, many other myosin types are responsible for variety of movement of non-muscle cells. For example, myosin is involved in intracellular organization and the protrusion of actin-rich structures at the cell surface. Myosin V is involved in vesicle and organelle transport. Myosin XI is involved in cytoplasmic streaming, wherein movement along microfilament networks in the cell allows organelles and cytoplasm to stream in a particular direction. Eighteen different classes of myosins are known. Genomic representation of myosin motors: * Fungi (yeast): 5 * Plants (Arabidopsis): 17 * Insects (Drosophila): 13 * Mammals (human): 40 * Chromadorea ( nematode C. elegans): 15 = Microtubule motors =  Kinesin  Kinesins are a group of related motor proteins that use a microtubule track in anterograde movement. They are vital to spindle formation in mitotic and meiotic chromosome separation during cell division and are also responsible for shuttling mitochondria, Golgi bodies, and vesicles within eukaryotic cells. Kinesins have two heavy chains and two light chains per active motor. The two globular head motor domains in heavy chains can convert the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work to move along microtubules. The direction in which cargo is transported can be towards the plus-end or the minus-end, depending on the type of kinesin. In general, kinesins with N-terminal motor domains move their cargo towards the plus ends of microtubules located at the cell periphery, while kinesins with C-terminal motor domains move cargo towards the minus ends of microtubules located at the nucleus. Fourteen distinct kinesin families are known, with some additional kinesin-like proteins that cannot be classified into these families. Genomic representation of kinesin motors: * Fungi (yeast): 6 * Plants (Arabidopsis thaliana): 61 * Insects (Drosophila melanogaster): 25 * Mammals (human): 45  Dynein  Dyneins are microtubule motors capable of a retrograde sliding movement. Dynein complexes are much larger and more complex than kinesin and myosin motors. Dyneins are composed of two or three heavy chains and a large and variable number of associated light chains. Dyneins drive intracellular transport toward the minus end of microtubules which lies in the microtubule organizing center near the nucleus. The dynein family has two major branches. Axonemal dyneins facilitate the beating of cilia and flagella by rapid and efficient sliding movements of microtubules. Another branch is cytoplasmic dyneins which facilitate the transport of intracellular cargos. Compared to 15 types of axonemal dynein, only two cytoplasmic forms are known. Genomic representation of dynein motors: * Fungi (yeast): 1 * Plants (Arabidopsis thaliana): 0 * Insects (Drosophila melanogaster): 13 * Mammals (human): 14-15 = Plant-specific motors = In contrast to animals, fungi and non-vascular plants, the cells of flowering plants lack dynein motors. However, they contain a larger number of different kinesins. Many of these plant-specific kinesin groups are specialized for functions during plant cell mitosis. Plant cells differ from animal cells in that they have a cell wall. During mitosis, the new cell wall is built by the formation of a cell plate starting in the center of the cell. This process is facilitated by a phragmoplast, a microtubule array unique to plant cell mitosis. The building of cell plate and ultimately the new cell wall requires kinesin-like motor proteins. Another motor protein essential for plant cell division is kinesin- like calmodulin-binding protein (KCBP), which is unique to plants and part kinesin and part myosin.  Other molecular motors  Besides the motor proteins above, there are many more types of proteins capable of generating forces and torque in the cell. Many of these molecular motors are ubiquitous in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, although some, such as those involved with cytoskeletal elements or chromatin, are unique to eukaryotes. The motor protein prestin, expressed in mammalian cochlear outer hair cells, produces mechanical amplification in the cochlea. It is a direct voltage-to- force converter, which operates at the microsecond rate and possesses piezoelectric properties.

It declined rapidly under various owners and was relaunched as a populist tabloid in 2006. However, the company went bankrupt on 23 July 2012,\\"France Soir\\" mis en liquidation. Xavier Ternisien, Le Monde before re- emerging as an online-only paper in 2016. In 2020, according to NewsGuard, this media \\"fails to adhere to several basic journalistic standards\\". History France Soir was founded as the underground paper D√©fense de la France (\\"Defense of France\\") by young resistance leaders, Robert Salmon and Philippe Viannay, in 1941. The first editions were printed on a Rotaprint 3 offset printing machine hidden in the cellars of the Sorbonne. Distributed to Grenoble, Clermont-Ferrand, Lyon and to Britain by the resistance networks Combat and T√©moignage chr√©tien, D√©fense de la France became the largest circulation newspaper in the underground press, with 450,000 copies per day by January 1944.France-Soir est issu d'un journal clandestin sous l'occupation. In March 1944, after multiple relocations, it was housed on three levels of an industrial building on rue Jean-Dolent, behind the La Sant√© Prison, in Paris's XIVth arrondissement. After the liberation, Paris-Soir, which with 1.7 million copies in 1936 was the leading French daily between the wars, forfeited its printing plant in Lyon due to its ambiguous behavior under occupation. Pierre Lazareff, its former editor, had returned from the US and joined D√©fense de la France in September 1944. The first issue of France-Soir - D√©fense de la France was printed using Paris-Soirs presses on 7 November 1944. The hyphenated name affiliated the old paper with that of the French resistance.Pierre Haski, France Soir ne sera plus imprim√©, la fin d‚Äôun dinosaure de la presse ¬ª, Rue89, publi√© le 11 octobre 2011, consult√© le 23 juillet 2012 The paper's name was truncated to France Soir after World War II. The paper grew to be ranked among the country's (and the European continent's) most circulated, reaching 1.5 million in 1955 with Pierre Lazareff as chief editor. Its circulation was more than 1.4 million in the late 1950s. Early in the 21st century, circulation dropped below 90,000. Its circulation was 30,000 copies just before its closure in 2011. =Cartoon controversy= In February 2006, Jacques Lefranc, managing director of the news, was dismissed by then owner Raymond Lakah for re-printing the cartoon depictions of Muhammad that were the subject of the \\"Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy\\". The 12 cartoons were printed with the addition of another depicting other religious figures sitting on a cloud with the caption reading, \\"Don't worry Muhammad, we've all been caricatured here\\". =Acquisition by Jean-Pierre Brunois and Olivier Rey= In April 2006, the Tribunal of Commerce in Lille announced that the paper would become the property of Jean-Pierre Brunois, a real-estate developer, and Olivier Rey, a former journalist for the paper. The tribunal had been overseeing the bankruptcy and bids for take over since October 2005, at which point the circulation had dropped to around 50,000. The decision lead to strike by the staff who were displeased with Brunois' plan to cut costs by firing many, and increase circulation by turning the paper into a tabloid. One of the opposing bids, favored by the staff, was from Arkadi Gaydamak, the owner of The Moscow News, who had promised not to fire the staff. Due to the turbulence, France Soir was not published for a month and a half. Brunois brought in bi-lingual British photographer Jason Fraser to lead the tabloid remodelling of the paper. =Pugachyov ownership= In March 2010, France Soir was acquired by Alexander Pugachyov, son of Russian ex-billionaire Sergey Pugachyov. The paper was relaunched in 2010, but its last print issue appeared on 13 December 2011, with the online version ending in July 2012 with the court-ordered bankruptcy of the company. During the liquidation process, the name France-Soir was then bought by the group Mutualize Corporation SA. which relaunched the newspaper as a 100% online media with an innovative strategy.http://www.francesoir.fr/culture-medias/france-soir-et-pougatchev- quatre-annees-de-vie-commune-mouvementees France-Soir et Pougatchev: quatre ann√©es de vie commune mouvement√©es =Mutualize Corporation A young french team = Mutualize Corporation SA. relaunched the newspaper as a 100% online media with an innovative strategy in 2016 reaching peak audience in 2018.

Arianna Huffington described Fleitz in a 2005 article as \\"Bolton's chief enforcer.\\"Huffington, Arianna, \\"Plamegate: The John Bolton Connection.\\" Huffington Post, May 2005. Fleitz's name first hit the press in the spring of 2005 during the battle in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to confirm Bolton as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Several accounts describe difficult challenges Fleitz faced as Bolton's Chief of Staff, mostly involving conflict over a controversial speech Bolton delivered on a possible Cuban biological weapons program. Most contemporaneous press accounts in 2005 portrayed this matter as a personnel dispute over a disagreement with two intelligence officers over assertions Bolton wanted to make in the speech. In his own testimony, Fleitz said one of the analysts had forwarded Bolton's speech for the CIA to review, but attached his own dissenting commentary and then denied doing so. This led to a confrontation and an apology from the analyst's supervisors. Fleitz testified that the other analyst campaigned against the speech after it had been delivered to Congress and the press.Jehl, Douglas. \\"Released E-Mail Exchanges Reveal More Bolton Battles\\".

It extends from an intersection with Biscayne Boulevard (U.S. Route 1 or US 1) near Northeast 88th Terrace north to an interchange of Interstate 95 (I-95) and Miami Gardens Drive (SR 860, also called Northeast 183rd Street). It is often used by commuters as an alternative to the oft- congested Interstate and U.S. Highway between Miami and Hollywood. Route description State Road 915 begins on the southern edge of Miami Shores at an oblique junction with Biscayne Boulevard (U.S. Route 1), with no direct access for southbound SR 915 travelers to northbound US 1. The road heads north, maintaining this orientation for most of its course, as a four-laned undivided road. After approximately a quarter-mile, SR 915 crosses the Florida East Coast Railroad tracks, and continues through a primarily residential neighborhood. SR 915 meets with SR 932 about three-quarters of a mile later, forming its eastern terminus. A short distance later, SR 915 swings eastwards in an arc to cross the Biscayne Canal and Griffing Boulevard, entering the village of Biscayne Park at this point, before resuming its original alignment. Upon entering North Miami, the road's neighborhood becomes more commercial as it leads up to the five-ways intersection with SR 922 and the eastern portion of SR 909. Apartment buildings line the road as it continues north for another half-mile to intersect SR 916. SR 915 continues north through more residential neighborhoods for another two miles before it meets SR 826, and crosses into North Miami Beach. The road then continues north past houses for another mile, terminating at an intersection with SR 860 and the access ramps for southbound Interstate 95. History Prior to a statewide reallocation of numbers in the Florida State Roads system in 1983, Northeast Sixth Avenue was designated State Road 933 by the Florida Department of Transportation. After the change, the SR 933 was applied to a stretch of road five miles to the south of SR 916.

They later became atabegs (governors) of Yazd, Isfahan and Abarkuh from c. 1051 to 1141. They were related to the Buyids.The Political and Dynastic History of the Iranian World, C.E. Bosworth, The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 5, ed. J. A. Boyle, John Andrew Boyle, (Cambridge University Press, 1968), 37.  Origins  Although Margaretha Heemskerk, a professor of Islamic Studies, states that the Kakuyids were of Kurdish origin, many other scholars consider them relatives of Sayyida Shirin, who was from the Dailamite Bavand dynasty.  History  The Kakuyids were given control of Isfahan in or before 1008 by Sayyida Shirin, who held the regencies of her young Buyid sons Majd al-Dawla of Ray and Shams al-Dawla of Hamadan. The man who was given the administration of the city was Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar. Over time, he effectively became independent of Buyid control. At times Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar acted as an ally of the Buyids; when Shams al-Dawla was faced with a revolt in Hamadan, for example, he turned to the Kakuyids for aid. Shortly after Shams al-Daula died, he was succeeded by Sama' al-Dawla, however, the Kakuyids invaded and took control of Hamadan in 1023 or 1024. They then moved on and seized Hulwan from the 'Annazids. The Buyid Musharrif al-Dawla, who ruled over Fars and Iraq, forced the Kakuyids to withdraw from Hulwan, but they retained Hamadan. Peace was made between the two sides, and a matrimonial alliance was eventually arranged. Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar was succeeded in 1041 by his son Faramurz. While in Hamadan another Kakuyid, Garshasp I, took power. In 1095, Garshasp II became the new Emir of the Kakuyid dynasty, and was later killed at the Battle of Qatwan.Bosworth, Clifford Edmund, Historic cities of the Islamic world, (BRILL, 2007), 562. Faramurz's reign was cut short by the Seljuks, who after a year-long siege of Isfahan took the city in 1051 or 1052. Despite this, Faramurz was given Yazd and Abarkuh in fief by the Seljuks. The Kakuyids remained the governors of these provinces until sometime in the mid-12th century; their rule during this time was known for the construction of mosques, canals and fortifications.

It was established in the 19th century but only became part of suburban Adelaide in the second half of the 20th century. It is approximately 10 km east of Adelaide's central business district. The main arterial road, Gorge Road, runs through this suburb in an east‚Äìwest direction. The River Torrens, one of Adelaide's major water supplies, borders the suburb. This water source runs its way from Mount Pleasant to the sea. Gorge Road leads up into the Adelaide Hills, joining the gorge of the Kangaroo Creek Dam, and the Torrens' source. Fifth Creek (a tributary to the River Torrens) also runs through the suburb as an intermittent stream, prone to flooding in late Spring (October‚ÄìDecember). Athelstone is bounded by the River Torrens, Black Hill Conservation Park, Montacute Road, Stradbroke Road, Hamilton Terrace, Schulze Road and River Drive.  History  The first Europeans known to have visited Athelstone were the explorers John Hill and Dr George Imlay. They camped overnight beside the Torrens on 23 January 1838, en route to the Murray River.Register newspaper, 16 June 1838, p. 3., Messrs Imlay & Hill's Excursion to the River Murray. Due to the high fertility of the alluvial river soils, the district was soon being farmed by incoming European migrants. Athelstone's name comes from Athelstone house and mill, built by Charles Dinham circa 1843 to 1845. John Coulls from Helston in Cornwall bought the mill in 1855, converting it for grape crushing.National Trust Register, Register of the National Estate The suburb (lower Athelstone) began as a village along the River Torrens. The shopping centre or village centre began from these settlements. Athelstone Post Office opened on 19 March 1863. The Addison family held possession of the land sold to the Jesuits in the 1960s to build Saint Ignatius' College senior campus around the Upper Athelstone site. Smaller subdivisions have been created. For example, Foxfield Estate in the east, was a development of the Hickinbotham Group during the late 1970s. Other subdevelopments have also occurred. Land has also been preserved in the process. Wadmore Park, adjoining Athelstone Oval and Black Hill Conservation Park were established as recreational and nature reserves. Market gardening was a big part of Athelstone's development. Families such as the Tunno family migrated from Italy in the 1950s and grew a variety of bunched vegetables on a small acreage for 30 years selling it to various retailers and wholesale markets throughout Adelaide. Much of the produce grown was European in origin such as endive, spinach, chicory, and fennel. As at 1 December 2014 only one market garden is left in Athelstone, located on Maryvale Road. Geography Athelstone Recreation Reserve is a reserve in the suburb of Athelstone. It is home to the Athelstone Soccer Club and Eastern United Football Club. It is the largest reserve in the suburb of Athelstone.  Demography  The 2001 Australian Bureau of Statistics data indicates Athelstone's population to be predominantly middle class and totalling just over 9,150 people. There is an even spread of both genders. Over 48% of the population comprises married couples with a skew to the 35- to 64-year-old age range. Less than 15% of the entire population of Athelstone is over 65 years old. Some 63% of the population was born in Australia. About 36% of the population speaks other languages. Approximately 40% of the people living in Athelstone have both parents born overseas. More than 13% of Athelstone speaks Italian, over 4% speaks Greek, and just over 2% speaks Chinese. Athelstone residents work primarily in the retail, manufacturing, health, medical, law, property / business services, education and construction sectors (in descending order) with over 66% of its workers employed in those industries.  Housing  The predominantly contemporary housing style is echoed throughout the suburb. There have been different stages in the suburb's development. Dwellings from the first half of the twentieth century housing still predominate in some sections of the suburb, with corrugated iron cladding or stone exteriors (mostly Californian bungalows). The first contemporary housing was built in the area during the 1970s. Many of these styles have emerged as the area still has some market gardening holdings yet to be released as housing allotments. Some blocks have been subdivided for high density housing arrangements.

Originally the (Royal) Charms, the band changed its name to the Gladiolas in 1957 and the Excellos in 1958, before finally settling on the Zodiacs in 1959. Early history Maurice Williams was born 26 April 1938 in Lancaster, South Carolina. His first experience with music was in the church, where his mother and sister both performed. By the time he was six, Williams was performing regularly there. With his childhood friend Earl Gainey, Williams formed the gospel group the Junior Harmonizers. As rock and roll and doo-wop became their primary interest, the Junior Harmonizers changed their name to the Royal Charms. The Royal Charms and the Gladiolas In addition to Williams and Gainey, the Royal Charms were made up of Willie Jones (baritone), William Massey (tenor, baritone, trumpet), and Norman Wade (bass). In the winter of 1956, while still in high school, Williams and his band traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, to record for the Excello label. At the time they were going by the name the Royal Charms, but the founder of Excello Records, Ernie Young, convinced them to change their name to the Gladiolas (at the time, there were at least two other bands using the same name).

The Zodiacs Williams finished high school and while on the road with the band, their station wagon broke down in Bluefield, West Virginia. The band came across a British-built Ford car known as the Zodiac (a 'luxury' version of the Ford Zephyr built in Britain, Australia and New Zealand) and changed their name. Shortly thereafter, Henry Gaston replaced Earl Gainey. In the spring of 1959, Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs performed at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, South Carolina. Around that time, the group split and reformed. The members were Williams, Gaston, Wiley Bennett, and Charles Thomas. Later, Little Willie Morrow and Albert Hill were added. One month later, in the early summer of 1959, the band recorded in a Quonset Hut on Shakespeare Road in Columbia. The recording engineer, Homer Fesperman, recorded several tracks that the band had hoped would include a hit. One of the last tracks that they recorded that day was \\"Stay\\", a song that Williams had written a couple of weeks before. Williams sang lead and Henry Gaston sang the counter-verse falsetto. After taking the demo of \\"Stay\\" to Al Silver at Herald Records in New York City, the song was pressed and released in early 1960. At 1:36, \\"Stay\\" is the shortest recording ever to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States.per Casey Kasem on the American Top 40 broadcast for the week ended March 15, 1980: cue sheet At the end of 1963, the British band the Hollies recorded \\"Stay\\", which gave the group their debut Top Ten hit single in the UK, peaking at No.8Rock File 4 - Chart log of American/British Top 20 Hits 1955-1974, Charlie Gillett & Simon Frith, Panther Books Ltd (1976) in January 1964, three years after the Zodiacs' version had peaked at No.14 on the U.K. charts (January 1961). Later versions of \\"Stay\\", by the Four Seasons (1963) and Jackson Browne (1978), reached the Top 20 in the U.S., each selling over one million copies in the United States alone. The inclusion of the Zodiacs' \\"Stay\\" on the soundtrack to the film Dirty Dancing in 1987 led to the song selling more records than it had during its original release. A 1965 recording by the group, \\"May I\\", released by Vee Jay Records and Dee-Su Records, became, over the years, another million-selling record. Later life Williams continued recording, touring, and releasing music through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. He is still active in the music industry, residing in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Pabbar River is the westernmost river that drains east to the Ganges. The Sutlej River is the next watershed over and is the easternmost river that drains west into the Indus. River is having siltation problem. The Asan River is a tributary of the Tons that is often named (incorrectly) after this great river as the Tons. The Asan river is a confluence of two small river systems; one comprising streams flowing south from the Himalayan range running from Vikas Nagar towards Tehri (with Mussorie in the centre), and the other comprising streams flowing north-west from the lower Shiwalik hills (that separate Dehradun and Saharanpur districts). The misnomer Tons stands for the river originating from the Mussorie hills, flowing down through Robber's cave, Bijapur canal and Tapkeshwar Mahadev, before emerging into a broad valley behind IMA. This river receives substantial waters from several streams flowing south from the Himalayan slopes. It goes on west beyond the locality of Premnagar to finally join the streams from the lower Shiwaliks and flow toward the Yamuna, which it joins near Poanta Sahib. Asan barrage is constructed just before this confluence. Identification with ancient Saraswati river Research K. S. Valdiya, The River Saraswati was a Himalayan- born river K. S. Valdiya Current Science, Vol. 104, No. 1, 10 January 2013, http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/104/01/0042.pdf points to the possibility of the ancient Saraswati river having had a source in the glacial waters of the Himalayas. The theory https://www.scribd.com/document/380650060/Tracing-the-Origin-of-Saraswati- River-to-Tons-and-Baspa-Rivers states that the Tons river became a tributary of the Yamuna a few thousand years ago following a tectonic event in the Shiwalik range near Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh. If this is true, the Tons once ran an independent course somewhat parallel to the Yamuna, running south-west into Haryana where the Yamuna merged into it, and lower down the course into Punjab, where the Sutlej merged into it. This river was then the Saraswati mentioned in the Vedic texts as the greatest of all Indian rivers. However, this is just a theory and is yet to be universally accepted. Geology The top of the Tons river is in the Himalayan Crystalline complex. It then flows through Tethan Himalaya rocks before connecting to the Pabbar River in the Lesser Himalayan Sequence. The Tons flows into the Yamuna River after crossing into the Sub-Himalaya Sequence. In Literature An engraved plate of a rope bridge crossing in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1839, inspired the poem Crossing the River Tonse by a Jhoola by Letitia Elizabeth Landon in which the three strands of the rope are echoed by the three-lined verses. Adventure sports Along with Ganges, it has now become a major destination for water-based adventure sports like white-water rafting in Uttarakhand.

The vessel was the third and last ship in the Sverige class along with and . Gustaf V was launched on 15 September 1917 at Kockums in Malm√∂ and delivered to the Navy on 9 January 1922. The design consisted of four 28 cm cannon and a secondary armament of eight 15.2 cm cannon. During the interwar period, the ship underwent several modernizations and was one of the most powerful vessels in the fleet during the Second World War. The ship was put in reserve in 1948, was decommissioned in 1957 and was later sold for scrapping in Karlskrona. However, the ship remained at Berga Academy of War as of 1968. Two of the ship's 15.2 cm guns are preserved in the battery at H√§ggmansberget in the defensive Kalix Line, around Kalix.  Design  Gustaf V was long, wide and had a depth of . The hull was made of nitrated steel with overlapping plates with an armored belt at the waterline and on the citadel. The bow was designed with a forward sloping Atlantic bow which gave her the ability to act as an icebreaker. Unlike her sister ship HSwMS Sverige, Gustaf V was not designed as a flagship but instead received two bunks for 22 cadets and engineers. =Machinery= The machinery consisted of twelve coal-fired boilers that delivered steam to two steam turbines. The boilers were placed in two groups of six, which necessitated two funnels. The boilers delivered steam to two independent turbine assemblies with a high-pressure turbocharger and a low-pressure turbine. The turbine movement was transmitted to each propeller shaft via a 17.23: 1 gear ratio which allowed turbines to operate at a rotational speed of about 3,459 RPM and propellers at 200 RPM. This method gave the machinery better efficiency than HSwMS Sverige, which did not have a reduction gear. This resulted in an increased power output by 20 percent. In addition, coal consumption decreased, which increased the ships range. Gustaf Vs machinery developed 22,000 horsepower, which gave the vessel a speed of 23.2 knots. =Armament= Forward 28 cm and 15.2 cm cannon. The main artillery on Gustaf V consisted of four 28 cm M/12 cannons that were placed in two double turrets, one on the bow and one on the stern. The projectiles weighed with a range of . The secondary artillery consisted of eight 15.2 cm cannons. These were placed in six single turrets, three on each side of the superstructure, and a twin turret staggered above the front 28 cm cannon. The light artillery consisted of four 75 mm cannons and furthermore there were two 57 mm cannons, two 6.5 mm machine guns and two 45.7 cm underwater torpedo tubes in the bow. History =Construction and Delivery= Gustaf V was laid down in spring 1915 at Kockums in Malm√∂. With HSwMS Sverige already being launched the shipyard had access to the original drawings, which meant that the construction work started well. However, as the First World War progressed, it became increasingly difficult to obtain materials, especially those that had to be acquired outside the country. In particular armored plates ordered from the United States were delayed, which caused delays in construction. On 31 January 1918, the ship was launched in the presence of Crown Prince Gustaf VI Adolf. Before launching, there was anxiety that as the ship slipped into the water it would hit the opposite side of the harbor basin, as the distance to this was considered short and the ship's weight was so great. To prevent a collision with the basin edge heavy chains were attached to the ship which would help arrest its momentum and at the edge of the basin were laid wooden logs that would help dampen a possible collision. The launching proved successful when the chains effectively braked the ship before reaching the quayside. During fitting out work after the launch, the problems with material procurement became even more pronounced. In addition, there was a strong labor shortage in 1917‚Äì1920 which forced the yards to request breaking the contract. Due to the belief in disarmament and peace after the First World War, there were also proposals to remove the armor and build HSwMS Gustaf V and HSwMS Drottning Victoria as passenger ships. Nothing came of this however and in the winter of 1921/1922 Gustaf V was ready to conduct sea trials. During these trials it appeared that the new propeller machinery, with the reduction gear that some had doubted, worked satisfactorily. The total cost of Gustaf V was 14,220,000 Swedish Krona. The sum is equal to today's monetary value (annual average 2016) of approximately 356,825,250 SEK or 44,022,000 USD.SCB: Prisomr√§knaren, ber√§kning gjord 15 Januari 2017 In addition to this appropriation, a sum of SEK 1,293,295 was received, which was awarded by an arbitration panel after it the shipyard requested extra money due to increased costs from procurement difficulties. =Interwar= Gustaf V in 1930 after refit and merged funnels. After the First World War, Sweden's relationship with the new nations, Finland and the Baltic States, had become increasingly busier, and in order to show the Swedish Government's goodwill during the early 1920s several official exercises were conducted in these countries. On 5 July 1924, Gustaf V joined together with HSwMS Drottning Victoria and four minelayers on a transit to Tallinn, and then together with the entire Swedish Coastal Fleet, a total of 36 ships, to Helsinki. In the summer of 1926, Gustaf V and HSwMS Sverige visited Copenhagen in connection with exercises in the southern Baltic. In 1927‚Äì1930 Gustaf V underwent her first major modernization. The forward mast was converted into a tripod mast in which a lookout post and a rangefinder were placed. The mast height was reduced, the ventilation system improved, and the old torpedo rooms were converted to artillery control centers. In addition, a new deckhouse was built on the superstructure in the stern for accommodations and fittings and an expanded bridge for the Chief of the Navy were built. Furthermore, an anti-aircraft control center was built and the two forward funnels were combined. Due to the death of Queen Victoria in the spring of 1930, Gustaf V went with HSwMS Drottning Victoria and the destroyers and to the then German city of Swinem√ºnde, arriving on 9 April. After the Queen's remains was carried onto HSwMS Drottning Victoria the ships returned to Stockholm, where the Queen's remains were landed by the royal barge . On 4 April 1933, Gustaf V ran aground off Malm√∂. She was refloated on 6 April 1933. In the years 1936‚Äì1938 a modernization was carried out when six of the coal boilers were replaced with two oil fired boilers, with some of the coal storage converted to oil tanks. In addition, the ammunition stores for the main and secondary artillery were built-up, and the 15.2 cm double turret above the bow 28 cm turret was replaced with four 40 mm Bofors. In addition the 90 cm searchlights were replaced with 110 cm searchlights. On 9 March 1939, a large air defense exercise was carried out in Karlskrona. During a flight landing in the dark, an aircraft collided with Gustaf Vs combat mast, killing two people from the airplanes crew. =Second World War= At the outbreak of World War II, Gustaf V was the flagship of the Coastal Fleet. On the night of 17 July 1940 during an exercise west of Gotland one of the boilers exploded. Eight people in the boiler room were killed instantly, and two people who were on the deck near one of the air intakes were badly injured. These two were taken by a minelayer to Visby Hospital, where they later died. Gustaf V then went to the mainland, and at H√•rsfj√§rden the commanding admiral and his staff moved to HSwMS Sverige, which then served as flagship during the remainder of the war. After the explosion Gustaf V was taken to Stockholm's naval yards for repair. After one month the ship was able to return to service. After the Second World War, Gustaf V participated in a ceremony in Stockholm when King Gustaf V thanked the Navy for their vigilant guard during the war years. The ship then returned to Karlskrona, where the ship was modernized with the installation of a new radar facility. When HSwMS Sverige was taken out of active service with the Coastal Fleet in 1947, Gustaf V took over the role of the Swedish flagship once again. Disposal 15.2 cm guns of Gustaf V in 2010 Gustaf V was released from the fleet on 1 April 1957. She was supposed to be released to Karlskrona, however she lay at Berga Naval Base, south of Stockholm through the year 1967. While there she was used as a mooring point for destroyers and smaller ships. Two of the ship's 15.2 cm cannons were moved after the erection of the Kalix Line in Norrbotten, where they were used as fortified cannon at H√§ggmansberget. In 1970 she was sold for scrapping in Gothenburg.

In intermediate betting rounds in loose games, he opined it is often more valuable to play a good draw strongly than to do so with the current best hand, while in tighter games the opposite is often the case. His books and recent gambling related writings have been on poker, although he wrote on horse handicapping in the 1980s. He also wrote on a wide range of non-gambling topics ranging from human resource topics to commercial snail farming.

It is the only high school in Kent and the Kent City School District and serves students in grades 9‚Äì12 living in Kent, Franklin Township, Brady Lake, and Sugar Bush Knolls as well as a small portion of southern Streetsboro. As of the 2018‚Äì19 academic year, enrollment was 1,308 students with 80 teachers for a student‚Äìteacher ratio of 16:1. Recognition for academic performance over the years has come from the United States Department of Education, Ohio Department of Education, and U.S. News & World Report. The school was founded in 1868 as Kent High School and was first housed at the Franklin Township Hall until the completion of the Union School building in March 1869. In 1922, the school was moved to a new facility named for U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt on a campus, which would serve as the high school until 1959. Following completion of a new building on a larger campus along North Mantua Street in northern Kent, Roosevelt was moved to this location. The building has had a number of additions made beginning in the mid-1960s and contains nearly 70 classrooms, a library, gymnasium, auditorium, and indoor pool. The campus has been expanded over the years to and also includes several athletic facilities and practice fields. Nearly 200 courses are offered at the school including 13 Advanced Placement classes and 25 vocational education programs. Roosevelt is part of the Six District Educational Compact which pools vocational resources with five nearby high schools. There are also two academy programs for students with various educational needs. Other elective courses offered include those in the study Arabic language, lifeguard training, various aspects of American history and culture, multiple writing and journalism courses, and the visual, performing, and practical arts. There are multiple co- and extracurricular clubs and activities, many of which have earned outside recognition at the state and national levels. Roosevelt athletic teams are known as the Rough Riders with school colors of red, white, and black, and compete in the Suburban League American Division as part of the Ohio High School Athletic Association. Notable Roosevelt alumni include a Governor of Ohio, professional athletes, and entertainment figures. History The Union School building, later known as Central School The establishment of what is today Theodore Roosevelt High School occurred in 1868 when the first classes of what was originally known as Kent High School were held. This was preceded first by the formation of the Franklin Union School District around 1860, which brought four smaller schoolhouse districts under one administration in what was then known as Franklin Mills. In 1867, the school board decided to consolidate the various neighborhood schoolhouses and create a graded curriculum, which included separate high school classes. As part of the consolidation effort, construction of a new building, known as the Union School, began at the corner of Park Avenue and North Mantua Street on a hill overlooking the newly named village of Kent. Construction of the school was part of a number of building developments in Kent in the late 1860s, including two churches and a large bank building. The name of the settlement was changed from Franklin Mills to Kent in 1864 and the village was incorporated from part of Franklin Township in 1867 after population growth began in the mid-1860s followed the arrival of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad and its shops in 1863. The laying of the Union School's cornerstone on May 29, 1867, was hailed by the local newspaper, the Kent Bulletin, as an event \\"which is brighter than anything heretofore recorded in our favor.\\" Because of construction delays, the building was not ready for classes in September 1868, so the first classes of the high school were held at the nearby Franklin Township Hall while students in grades 1‚Äì8 remained at their old schoolhouses. The new building opened on March 14, 1869 with the high school grades located in the southwest room of the second floor and the four primary grades on the first floor. The third floor of the building was an open, multi-purpose room. The school held its first graduation ceremony in July 1869 with a class of just one, a student named Anna Nutting. Nutting later taught at the Union School and eventually became its principal, serving until 1888. The Union School, which would later be known as Central School, served as the home of all Kent students until two additional elementary schools for grades 1‚Äì6 were constructed in the 1880s. For most of the 1910s, all of the school buildings were overcrowded and the high school graduating classes had grown to nearly 40 students. As a result, a new, separate high school building was built in 1922. The Union/Central building remained in service mainly for grades K‚Äì7 until 1953, when it was closed after the completion of a new Central Elementary School on the same property. It was razed in 1954. Because of Kent High School's location in what became known as the Central School by the late 19th century, the school is often referred to contemporarily and historically as Kent Central High or simply as Central High. The Roosevelt High School yearbook of 1923, done at the completion of the first school year the school was known as Roosevelt, uses \\"Kent Central\\" on several pages to refer to the school in previous years. The official name of the school prior to 1922 was always \\"Kent High School\\". Like the term \\"Kent Roosevelt\\" used today, \\"Kent Central\\" and similar terms are colloquial. =First campus, 1922‚Äì1959= The first building to bear the name of Theodore Roosevelt now serves as Davey Elementary School. Increases in enrollment throughout the 1910s led the school board to request funds to build a new high school building along with additions to other district buildings to ease overcrowding and prepare for expected growth in enrollment. A bond issue for the various construction projects was approved by voters June 24, 1919. Initially, the school board had planned to build the school on property along South Water Street adjacent to downtown, but decided against this citing the need for a larger lot and building to accommodate expected growth. Eventually, a site at the intersection of Park Avenue and North Prospect Street was purchased and construction began May 31, 1921. It was completed less than a year later, on May 22, 1922, and hosted commencement exercises for the graduating class in June. The four-story building cost $400,000 (approximately $ present-day) and contained a gymnasium with seating for 300, an 833-seat auditorium, and 27 classrooms. Later that year, in August, the Kent School Board adopted a resolution to name the building after former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. The first classes were held in the building September 6, 1922 and it was dedicated September 22.Grismer, pp. 100‚Äì101 By then, the high school enrollment had grown to approximately 400 students. In the late 1930s, a separate annex was built behind the building to house industrial arts classes. The North Prospect Street building served as the high school until 1959, when Roosevelt was relocated to a new building and campus along North Mantua Street in northern Kent. The building on North Prospect street was rededicated in 1959 as Davey Junior High School after the local Davey family and served as the junior high school for grades 7‚Äì9. It was later renamed Davey Middle School and housed grades 6‚Äì8. At the conclusion of the 1998‚Äì1999 school year, the building was closed for an extensive renovation, and reopened in 2000 as Davey Elementary School. =North Mantua campus, since 1959= Main entrance, part of the 1997 renovations. Further growth in Kent during the 1950s spurred discussion of a new high school with a larger campus offering more room for future expansion. In 1955, district voters approved a $1.5 million bond issue (approximately $ present-day) followed by a $650,000 bond issue (about $ present-day) in 1957 to fund a new high school, new elementary school, and renovation of the old high school to become a junior high school. Also in 1957, the school board purchased several acres of farmland along North Mantua Street as the site for the new high school campus.Darrow, pp. 11‚Äì12 Although some viewed the site as too remote, construction began in 1958 and the building was opened September 8, 1959 housing 550 students in grades 10‚Äì12. Enrollment increases throughout the 1960s and 1970s would necessitate several additions and by 1968, the graduating class numbered 238 students. Also in 1959, the Franklin Township and Brady Lake districts merged with the Kent City School District, bringing additional students to Roosevelt. Prior to that time some students from Franklin Township and Brady Lake, neither of which had an accredited high school, attended Roosevelt as tuition-paying students to complete their high school diploma, while others finished at Kent State High School. The state of Ohio had previously paid tuition for rural schools without accredited high schools, but discontinued doing so in the late 1950s. In 1972, 121 students from Kent State High School, which had closed earlier that year, were transferred to Roosevelt. Beginning in 1978, ninth graders started attending the high school again for the first time since 1959 due to overcrowding at Davey Junior High School. In 1985, Roosevelt was honored as one of 212 high schools in the United States to earn the Presidential Excellence in Education award from the U.S. Department of Education.Darrow, p. 175 Since 2004, Roosevelt has consistently been rated \\"Excellent\\" by the Ohio Department of Education and in December 2009, US News & World Report named Roosevelt in the 2010 \\"Best High Schools\\" issue as a Bronze Medal school. The school earned a \\"Bronze Medal\\" ranking and was one of only 46 high schools in the state of Ohio to be named in the report. Roosevelt was named as a Bronze Medal school again in 2015, 2016, and 2018. Campus and facilities Roosevelt High School looking southeast with baseball field visible on left and practice fields in foreground In addition to approximately 70 classrooms, the building contains a multi-purpose gymnasium, auditorium, a library, and a six-lane indoor swimming pool. When first opened in 1959, the building contained 27 classrooms, a library, and the gymnasium. Several additions have been made to the building and campus since 1959. In the mid-1960s, an additional classroom wing was added, followed in the early 1970s by construction of a vocational classroom wing and the auditorium and adjoining scene shop. In the late 1970s, two more additions were built; one wing containing classrooms and an indoor swimming pool and the other an expansion of the second floor.Darrow, pp. 173‚Äì174 The most recent additions in 1997 expanded the cafeteria and added a new art room and music storage room, along with several renovations and upgrades throughout the building. The Roosevelt High School campus covers along North Mantua Street (State Route 43) in northern Kent, adjacent to the corporate headquarters of the Davey Tree Expert Company. Along with the school building on the eastern end of the campus and Stanton Middle School on the western end, there are facilities and practice fields for several sports that are used for physical education and athletic competitions. The largest facility is Roosevelt Stadium, built in 1970, which includes a natural grass playing surface, an eight-lane all- weather running track, and locker rooms. It is used primarily for football and track and field. Adjacent to Roosevelt Stadium on the west is the smaller Stanton Stadium, used for lacrosse and soccer, which has an additional nine- lane all-weather track used by Stanton Middle School. Between Stanton Stadium and Stanton Middle School is the Adam S. Hamilton Fitness Center, named after 2007 Roosevelt graduate and athlete Adam S. Hamilton, who was killed on duty in Afghanistan in 2011. The center is used by the various athletic teams, physical education classes, athletic healthcare program, and as a locker room for athletic teams who use Stanton Stadium. The fitness center opened in 2000 and is housed in the building that previously served as the district's bus garage prior to the construction of Stanton Middle School in 1997. It was renovated and rededicated in honor of Hamilton in 2015. On the other side of Roosevelt Stadium are the baseball field, softball field, and a six-court tennis complex with additional open practice fields spread mainly along the southern part of campus. These fields are generally used for field hockey, football, soccer, and lacrosse. The campus site, previously a farm, was originally . Since its purchase in 1957 it has been expanded multiple times, with a addition in 1967, a expansion in 1990 that was used as the site for Stanton Middle School later that decade, and other adjacent parcels.Darrow, p. 176 The Roosevelt campus covers 18 adjacent parcels as of 2011 Along with the construction of Stanton Middle School, several changes were made to the campus between 1997 and 2000, including additional sports facilities and practice fields and the realignment of Roosevelt Drive. Demographics Location of the school (in red) and the Central School Annex (in pink) within the Kent City School District The Roosevelt student body comes from an area that includes most of the city of Kent, most of Franklin Township, and all of the village of Sugar Bush Knolls. A very small portion of Streetsboro is also included. The student body can also include those from outside the district through open enrollment, which is open to students from any school district in Ohio. During the 2018‚Äì19 school year, in which Roosevelt had a student body of 1,308, 78.2% of students were classified as non-Hispanic White, 10.9% non- Hispanic Black, 1.4% Asian, 2.8% Hispanic, and 6.5% multi-racial. 30.1% of Roosevelt students were labeled by the state of Ohio as economically disadvantaged, which classifies Roosevelt as a medium-low poverty school, and 14.4% of students were identified as having some sort of disability. The Roosevelt four-year graduation rate is 93.9%, which is above the state average of 82.2% and state requirement of 90%. Dennis Love, a 1993 Roosevelt graduate, serves as principal, a position he has held since June 2015. Previously, he had been serving as an assistant. Subscription required to view entire article As of the 2018‚Äì19 academic year, the school employs a teaching faculty of 80 for an average student‚Äìteacher ratio of 16:1. 81% of teachers hold a master's degree or beyond. Additional staff members include a career education assistant principal, two unit assistant principals, support staff, aides, tutors, guidance counselors, and administration. Curriculum Biology classroom The daily schedule is from 7:30 AM to 2:29 PM and consists of seven 51-minute periods with four minutes between each class and a 30-minute lunch period. Students who have lunch option are permitted to leave the campus during their lunch period and upperclassmen who have a study hall during their final period may leave early. The school year is divided into four 9-week grading periods which form two 18-week semesters. The first semester generally begins in mid-August and concludes in December while the second semester begins in early January and finishes in late May. State graduation requirements for the class of 2014 and beyond include 21.5 total credits. Of these, four must be in English, four in math, three each in science and social studies, one each in physical education and fine or practical arts, half a credit in health, and five elective credits. Within the credit requirements are specific classes that must be taken while the remainder can be filled by elective classes. Beginning with the class of 2017, the school began using the Cum Laude system for recognizing academic achievement instead of class rank.

Roosevelt offers nearly 200 courses including 15 Advanced Placement (AP), 25 vocational education, and numerous elective and required classes at varying levels of interest and understanding. Advanced Placement courses are offered in biology, calculus AB and BC, chemistry, environmental science, physics 1 and 2, English literature, French, Spanish, U.S. government, human geography, U.S. history, statistics, and studio art. Successful completion of an AP course adds an additional point that is factored into a student's class rank. Additionally, students are able to take advanced courses at nearby colleges and universities such as Kent State University and the University of Akron through two post-secondary dual enrollment options, which allow students to take credits that either fill both their high school and college graduation requirements or are for college credit only.Pathways to Your Future, pp. 120‚Äì123 (printed); pp. 118‚Äì121 (PDF) Vocational programs, known as Career and College Tech Prep classes, are available at the school and through the Six District Educational Compact, which includes the Cuyahoga Falls, Hudson, Stow- Munroe Falls, Tallmadge, and Woodridge school districts. The compact, established in 1969, combines and shares the vocational programs and resources of member schools and allows students to participate in the programs that are offered at each of the schools even if the program is at another building. There are 25 programs, 11 of which are housed at Roosevelt. Of the 25, six are College Tech Prep Initiative programs that allow students to earn both high school and college credits, while the remaining 19 programs are Career Programs designed to give students training and work experience. College Tech Prep programs housed at Roosevelt include those in athletic healthcare and fitness, manufacturing and engineering, landscape horticulture, and early childhood education. Career Programs housed at Roosevelt include two business- related programs, computer-aided design and manufacturing technologies, construction and remodeling, cosmetology, electronics, health technology, marketing, and out-of-school internships. Additional programs available through the compact that are housed at other schools include aviation, culinary arts, theater arts, automotive repair and technology, banking and finance, and early childhood educational aide training.Pathways to Your Future, pp. 61‚Äì76 (printed); pp.60‚Äì74 (PDF) Each program also has co- curricular component, meaning they have both in-class and outside requirements and responsibilities that are factored into the student's overall grade. One example is the Roosevelt chapter of DECA, which is part of the marketing education program. In 2016, DECA members representing Roosevelt advanced to the international competition for the 30th consecutive year. =Academies= The Expedition Academy is an advanced program based on the Expeditionary Learning model of Kurt Hahn and uses both traditional and experimental teaching methods and models. It was formed in 1999 as a result of a study using focus groups and interviews of 300 students which found that students generally felt they needed more \\"real-world\\" applications to their school work including community service, problem solving, and curriculum integration. The two-year program includes advanced courses in English, U.S. and world history, biology, and ecology and also includes a health class and an academy-specific physical education class integrated with outdoor education and community service.Pathways to Your Future, pp. 51‚Äì52 =Arts= Choir room Roosevelt offers several visual and performing arts classes and programs that vary according to grade level and interest. Classes are also available in practical arts, such as consumer science, information technology, and industrial technology. While all fine and practical arts classes are electives, one full- year credit of either fine or practical arts is required to graduate.Pathways to Your Future, pp. 54‚Äì57 Roosevelt offers four successive levels of general art classes, as well as classes in drawing and painting, clay and sculpture, glass and fiber, and an Advanced Placement studio art class that focuses on portfolio development. Three successive levels of photography classes are also offered. Generally, each art class lasts for a semester. A full-year general music theory class is offered for students of varying musical backgrounds, and semester-long courses in acting and directing and play production are also available.Pathways to Your Future, pp. 102‚Äì103 (printed); pp. 100‚Äì101 (PDF)Pathways to Your Future, p. 85 (printed); p. 83 (PDF) The musical performing arts programs‚Äîband, orchestra, and choir‚Äîare considered co- curricular, with the out-of-class requirements usually in the form of performances and additional rehearsals not during the school day. Each musical group also has additional extra-curricular ensembles and solo opportunities. Ensembles and soloists participate annually in the Ohio Music Education Association (OMEA) Solo and Ensemble Adjudicated Event, while the main groups participate in OMEA's Large Group Adjudicated Event. These events allow students to perform for judges and receive a rating and comments based on specific criteria. Rough Rider Marching Band performance of \\"Script Kent\\" in 2009 The Rough Rider Marching Band and flag corps perform at home and away football games, and at local and national competitions. In late October, after the football season, the band separates into concert band and wind symphony ensembles. Immediately after the final home game of every season, the band performs what is known as \\"Script Kent\\", a formation similar to \\"Script Ohio\\" performed by The Ohio State University Marching Band and using the same song, Le R√©giment de Sambre et Meuse by Robert Planquette. As part of the tradition, the band spells out \\"Kent\\" with the stadium lights off and band members wearing green glow sticks around their ankles that are uncovered only after the stadium lights have been turned off. The marching band also hosts a yearly band show in late August, known as the \\"Roosevelt Premier of Bands\\" that features several local high school bands and marches in Kent's annual Memorial Day parade in May. See also: \\"2009 Script Kent\\" (video) Additional extra- curricular performance groups include Jazz Band and brass, woodwind, percussion ensembles. The Roosevelt orchestra program is composed mainly of an all-string chamber orchestra. Extracurricular ensembles include a pit orchestra for the school's annual musical production and several smaller ensembles. The choral program includes two all-female choirs known as Treble Choir and Women's Chorale, a mixed four-part choir called ChoralWorks, and an all-male choir known as Men's Chorus. Membership in ChoralWorks and Women's Chorale is determined by audition. The choirs generally have three concerts during the school year, with additional performances in and outside of school at various times of the year. There are also three additional extracurricular ensembles, two all-female ensembles‚ÄîJunior Varsity Women and Varsity Women‚Äîand one four-part mixed ensemble called ACEs (Advanced Choral Ensemble), all of which are determined by audition at the beginning of each school year. Every May, the choirs, along with the Jazz Band, stage a pops concert that features music from a variety of time periods and genres and also includes choreography and additional solo and small group performances. The concert has been held every year since 1970. Since 2013, a madrigal dinner in the style of a Medieval or Renaissance boar's head festival, is held in early December. Members of ChoralWorks and Women's Chorale wear period costumes and sing period repertoire while guests are served a three-course meal. Practical arts classes include those in consumer science, information technology, and industrial technology. Generally, courses are for a semester, though a number of full-year classes are offered. Consumer science classes include those in areas such as cooking, sewing, interior design, relationships, and personal planning.Pathways to Your Future, pp. 86‚Äì90 (printed); pp. 84‚Äì87 (PDF) Classes offered in industrial and information technologies are separate from the vocational programs also available. Industrial tech classes include those in cabinetry, woods and metal, electronics, and computer-aided design while information tech classes include those in law, accounting, sports and entertainment management, and aspects of digital media.Pathways to Your Future, pp. 52‚Äì54Pathways to Your Future, pp. 57‚Äì60 =Additional courses and electives= The Roosevelt pool, built 1975‚Äì76 In addition to the required courses for subjects such as English, math, physical education, science, and social studies, a number of additional elective classes are offered, many of which can be substituted for traditional classes. At times, foreign language courses in Arabic and Mandarin Chinese were offered in addition to the four- year sequences of German, French, Latin, and Spanish classes. The Chinese language class was taught by an exchange teacher from China who came to the U.S. through a grant from the Ohio Department of Education. Arabic classes began in August 2010. A general English class for each grade level is required for graduation. Required English courses are full-year classes that can be taken at the comprehensive, college preparatory, or advanced levels with Advanced Placement available in 12th grade. Additional elective English classes include those in African American literature, women's studies and literature, public speaking, poetry, journalism, short story writing, writing research papers, and the works of William Shakespeare. A news magazine production class produces The Colonel, the school magazine published 10 times per academic year. The school yearbook, the Rough Rider, is produced by the yearbook production course. Staff members of The Colonel have won a number of awards at state competitions, including the All-Ohio Award for best overall news magazine from the Ohio Scholastic Media Association in 2010. See also: \\"'The Colonel' news staff honored\\" (2008), \\"Roosevelt journalists net honors at national session\\" (2007), and OSMA Contests English electives last one semester, except the full-year news magazine and yearbook production classes, and can only be taken along with the required English classes.Pathways to Your Future, pp. 77‚Äì83 (printed); pp. 75‚Äì81 (PDF) Within the physical education requirement, known as Dimensions of Physical Education, students have a choice of four programs of study in individual and net sports, dance, bodybuilding, and team sports. Ninth-grade students are required to take the one-semester class and an additional semester is required for graduation. Each dimension program also includes a session in aquatics and personal fitness. Lifeguard training is also offered as a course and can be used to gain certification as a Professional Rescuer in first aid, CPR, and lifeguarding from the American Red Cross.Pathways to Your Future, pp. 96‚Äì97 (printed); pp. 93‚Äì95 (PDF) The social studies requirement includes world history and U.S. history, a semester-long course in U.S. government, and a half-credit elective. World history has an advanced option while U.S. history is also offered as an Advanced Placement course. Advanced Placement U.S. government is offered as a year-long course that includes a semester in comparative government and a field trip to Washington, DC. Semester-long elective courses, which can fulfill either the elective portion of the graduation requirements or the social studies elective, include those on violence in the United States, sociology, psychology, American popular culture, African American history, economics, and a leadership and community service-oriented course known as Riders Taking Action.Pathways to Your Future, pp. 110‚Äì114 (printed); pp. 108‚Äì112 (PDF) Extracurricular activities Trophy case featuring the 1992 National High School Chess Championship trophy along with other awards In addition to many of the co-curricular activities associated with the various classes, there are several extracurricular clubs at the school. Honorary organizations National Honor Society and Quill and Scroll have active chapters at Roosevelt while national and international organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, Key Club, Amnesty International, and American Field Service (AFS) also have associated clubs at the school. In addition to the musical performing arts ensembles, there is also a chapter of the International Thespian Society honorary organization that is part of the Roosevelt Drama Guild. Drama Guild presents three productions each school year: a drama in November, a musical in February, and one-acts in April. Academic competition clubs such as an Academic Challenge quiz bowl team and Future Problem Solving are offered as well as a general foreign language club and separate clubs for the German, French, Latin, and Spanish language classes. General interest clubs and organizations include a chess club, athletic boosters, student council, arts promotion clubs ForArts (Friends of Roosevelt Art Society) and the RHS Film Society, a general science club along with clubs for the environment and zoology, and Gamers' Guild. There is also an African American youth-focused club known as Project Unity, a gay-straight alliance, and an active Special Olympics team. A number of Roosevelt's extracurricular clubs and activities have been successful in competitions at state, national, and international levels. The Roosevelt Chess Club won the 1992 High School National Championship in the U-1600 division while the Special Olympics team has had several individual medalists at state competitions.This is displayed in a trophy case at Roosevelt High School See also: \\"Special Olympians recognized\\" (2007) The Academic Challenge team won their three-team televised round of the show in 2007 which earned them an 8th- place finish overall in Northeast Ohio out of 87 schools. See also: \\"Kent Roosevelt High School wins first place\\" (2007) In 2003 and 2009 they placed second in their televised competition and also have first-place finishes in 1985 and 1993. The Future Problem Solving teams, which includes Community Problem Solving, has had a number of team and individual placings at the state and international competition including a fourth-place individual placing at the 2004 international competition and second- and third-place finishes in various categories at the 2006 international competition. See also: \\"Future Problem Solvers win big\\" (2004) =Athletics= Rough Rider logo Roosevelt's teams are known as the Rough Riders, owing to the school's namesake Theodore Roosevelt, and the school colors are red, white, and black. As of 2017, Roosevelt fields 28 varsity athletic teams, the most recent addition being the girls golf team, which became a varsity sport in August 2013 after two years as a club. Previously, girls who wanted to play golf could compete as individuals on the boys team. There are additional teams in most sports at the junior varsity level as well as a few sports that have freshman-only teams. All teams except the golf, ice hockey, and bowling have their home games in facilities on the Roosevelt campus. Ice hockey home games are held in the Kent State University Ice Arena, boys golf plays their home matches at Oak Knolls Golf Course just north of the Roosevelt campus, girls golf uses the Fairways of Twin Lakes, and the bowling teams have home matches at the Kent Lanes bowling alley. See also: GCHSHL Member Schools - 1969‚Äì2010 Homecoming football game, October 17, 2008 The school is a member the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) and competes at the OHSAA Division I level in all sports except football, where it competes in Division II. See also: Divisional Breakdowns - 2016-17 Since August 2015 Roosevelt has been a member of the Suburban League American Division for all sports except ice hockey, field hockey, and boys and girls lacrosse, as few or no other Suburban League schools have teams in those sports. Ice hockey competes in the Greater Cleveland High School Hockey League and field hockey in the Northeast Ohio Field Hockey League. Both boys and girls lacrosse compete in Division II, with the boys team part of the Ohio High School Lacrosse Association and the girls lacrosse team in the Ohio Schoolgirls Lacrosse Association. Prior to the 2016‚Äì17 school year, lacrosse was not an OHSAA sanctioned sport. Roosevelt was a member of the Trolley League, later called the Western Reserve League, from 1919 until 1948 when the league dissolved. After competing as an independent, the school joined the Metropolitan League in 1954. The Riders competed in the Metro League until it was absorbed in 1996 by the formation of the Western Reserve Conference. From 1996‚Äì2005, the Rough Riders were part of the WRC South Division.Darrow, pp. 186‚Äì188 Roosevelt joined the Portage Trail Conference Metro Division in 2005 and competed in the league until 2015. During the time in the PTC, girls golf competed in the Northeast Ohio Independent School Girls Golf League, and swimming and diving in the Northeast Aquatic Conference since the PTC did not have enough teams for league play in those sports. Rivalries Ravenna Ravens Roosevelt's archrival is the Ravenna High School Ravens, located in nearby Ravenna. The two schools were long-time rivals in successive athletic leagues, most recently as members of the Portage Trail Conference Metro Division until 2015. The rivalry, most prominent in football, began in the early 20th century and can be traced to the longtime rivalry between the cities of Kent and Ravenna that dates back to the early 19th century. See also: \\"Kent Roosevelt-Ravenna all-time scores\\" (2008) and \\"Rough Riders roll rival Ravens\\" (2010) With Roosevelt's shift to the Suburban League, the two schools have continued to play in many sports. Roosevelt also has a long-standing rivalry with the Bulldogs of Stow‚ÄìMunroe Falls High School, located in neighboring Stow, as the two schools are only around apart. Both schools were league rivals for over 50 years in the former Metro League and Western Reserve Conference until Roosevelt joined the PTC in 2005. Since then the two have continued to meet in a variety of sports including football, soccer, boys basketball, swimming and diving, and field hockey. Since 2015, both schools are members of the Suburban League, but in opposite divisions. See also: \\"Stow tops Roosevelt in wild, physical showdown\\" (2008) and \\"Field hockey rivalry ends in zeroes\\" (2010) Championships Several Roosevelt teams have enjoyed both league and state success. The football team, established in 1910, has won 24 league titles with the most recent being in 2013.These years are displayed on banners in the Roosevelt High School gymnasium The team has had undefeated regular seasons in 1922, 1966, 1990, 2006, and 2008 with state playoff appearances in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013.Grismer, p. 113Darrow, pp. 186-187 The program has produced a number of players who have gone on to play major college football and professionally in the National Football League (NFL) including Mike Adamle, Deral Boykin, Tom DeLeone, and Stan White. The boys golf team has been one of the school's most successful and consistent teams winning the school's first state championship in 1944 and 38 league titles through the 2014 season. The team has posted two undefeated regular seasons, in 1983 and again in 2009. { style=\\"float: right;\\" border=\\"1\\" -align=center style=\\"background: black; color: white\\" ! colspan=2 State championships ! colspan=2 State runners-up - !

In 2010, the 1980 boys cross country team was awarded the National Cross Country Co-Championship by XCNation.com, the National Historical Archives for prep cross country. Recognized as one of the top teams in U.S. history, the team ran three of the top five team averages for 2.5 miles ever during the 1980 season. The 12:04 team average at the Warrior Classic and 12:17 at the Ohio State Championships rank as two of the top team performances all-time. Additional state titles have been won by the girls field hockey team in 1981 with a runner-up finish in 1988, and the boys ice hockey team in 1982 after finishing as runner-up the year prior. Boys basketball has won 22 league titles, the most recent being in 2012, and played in consecutive OHSAA district championship games in 2009 and 2010. The team enjoyed their greatest season in 1957 when they advanced to the state championship game, falling to Middletown High School, which was led by future NBA great Jerry Lucas.Darrow, p. 186 The boys lacrosse team, formed in 2000, has state runner-up finishes in 2001 and 2005 along with state final four appearances by boys soccer and boys volleyball in 1999. Roosevelt also fields girls soccer, girls tennis, and girls volleyball in the fall sports season (August‚ÄìNovember) along with football, field hockey, boys soccer, boys and girls cross country, boys and girls golf, and cheerleading. In the winter sports season (November‚ÄìFebruary), in addition to the boys basketball and ice hockey teams, there are also boys and girls bowling, girls basketball, boys and girls swimming and diving, and wrestling teams, plus an additional cheerleading squad. During the spring sports season (March‚ÄìJune), Roosevelt fields baseball, softball, girls lacrosse, boys and girls track and field, and boys tennis teams along with the boys lacrosse and boys volleyball teams.

Desert pavement showing wind scour on the cobbles; Mojave Desert of southern California. A desert pavement, also called reg (in the western Sahara), serir (eastern Sahara), gibber (in Australia), or sa√Ø (central Asia) is a desert surface covered with closely packed, interlocking angular or rounded rock fragments of pebble and cobble size. They typically top alluvial fans. Desert varnish collects on the exposed surface rocks over time. Geologists debate the mechanics of pavement formation and their age. Formation Several theories have been proposed for the formation of desert pavements.McFadden, L.D., Wells, S.G. and Jercinovich, M.J. 1987. \\"Influences of aeolian and pedogenic processes on the origin and evolution of desert pavements\\", Geology 15(6):504-508. A common theory suggests they form through the gradual removal of sand, dust and other fine-grained material by the wind and intermittent rain, leaving the larger fragments behind. The larger fragments are shaken into place through the forces of rain, running water, wind, gravity, creep, thermal expansion and contraction, wetting and drying, frost heaving, animal traffic, and the Earth's constant microseismic vibrations. The removal of small particles by wind does not continue indefinitely, because once the pavement forms, it acts as a barrier to resist further erosion. The small particles collect underneath the pavement surface, forming a vesicular A soil horizon (designated \\"Av\\"). A second theory supposes that desert pavements form from the shrink/swell properties of the clay underneath the pavement; when precipitation is absorbed by clay it causes it to expand, and when it dries it cracks along planes of weakness. Over time, this geomorphic action transports small pebbles to the surface, where they stay through lack of precipitation that would otherwise destroy the pavement by transport of the clasts or excessive vegetative growth. A newer theory of pavement formation comes from studies of places such as Cima Dome, in the Mojave Desert of California, by Stephen Wells and his coworkers. At Cima Dome, geologically recent lava flows are covered by younger soil layers, with desert pavement on top of them, made of rubble from the same lava. The soil has been built up, not blown away, yet the stones remain on top. There are no stones in the soil, not even gravel. Researchers can determine how many years a stone has been exposed on the ground. Wells used a method based on cosmogenic helium-3, which forms by cosmic ray bombardment at the ground surface. Helium-3 is retained inside grains of olivine and pyroxene in the lava flows, building up with exposure time. The helium-3 dates show that the lava stones in the desert pavement at Cima Dome have all been at the surface the same amount of time as the solid lava flows right next to them. He wrote in a July 1995 article in Geology, that he concluded, \\"stone pavements are born at the surface.\\" While the stones remain on the surface due to heave, deposition of windblown dust must build up the soil beneath that pavement. For the geologist, this discovery means that some desert pavements preserve a long history of dust deposition beneath them. The dust is a record of ancient climate, just as it is on the deep sea floor and in the world's ice caps. Desert pavement evolution Desert pavement surfaces are often coated with desert varnish, a dark brown, sometimes shiny coating that contains clay minerals. In the USA a famous example can be found on Newspaper Rock in southeastern Utah. Desert varnish is a thin coating (patina) of clays, iron, and manganese on the surface of sun-baked boulders. Micro-organisms may also play a role in their formation. Desert varnish is also prevalent in the Mojave desert and Great Basin geomorphic province.Dorn, R. I. and T. M. Oberlander, 1981, \\"Microbial Origin of Desert Varnish,\\" Science 213:1245-1247 Local names Adrar in Mauritania Stony deserts may be known by different names according to the region. Examples include: Gibbers: Covering extensive areas in Australia such as parts of the Tirari-Sturt stony desert ecoregion are desert pavements called Gibber Plains after the pebbles or gibbers.East, J.J. 1889. \\"On the geological structures and physical features of Central Australia\\", Transactions and Proceedings and Report of the Royal Society of South Australia 12:31-53. Gibber is also used to describe ecological communities, such as Gibber Chenopod Shrublands or Gibber Transition Shrublands. In North Africa, a vast stony desert plain is known as reg. This is in contrast with erg, which refers to a sandy desert area.Jean Dresch et al., G√©ographie des r√©gions arides, Presses universitaires de France, Paris, 1982.

It has a small subdivision just northeast of that confluence named the Scarped Range. The Clear Range totals 16,270 km¬≤ (6,280 mi¬≤) and is 75 km (47 mi) north to south and 35 km (22 mi) east to west (at its widest point). The Clear Range and its northward neighbour the Marble Range are both subranges of the Pavilion Range. It and the neighbouring Marble Range line the east bank of the Fraser River north of the town of Lytton, British Columbia. The Clear Range extends as far as the town of Pavilion and is bounded by the south wall of Marble Canyon on the north. The southeast flank of the Clear Range is the Thompson River between Ashcroft and Lytton, while to its northeast are the Cornwall and Trachyte Hills, and beyond them the Arrowstone Hills of the Bonaparte Plateau. The range is horseshoe-shaped, facing the high rangeland-plateau basin of Hat Creek, which drains northeast to join the Bonaparte River, a tributary of the Thompson. All of these areas, including the Clear Range, are classified by geographers as belonging to the Fraser Plateau, which is part of the Interior Plateau. Terrain The outer flanks of the range are steep, particularly on the side of the Fraser, where the northerly peaks are a high plateau-edge almost 2000 m (7000 ft) above the river below. The core of the range is rugged and has a complex series of interlocking valleys. Karst formations throughout the area suggest caves, though none has been discovered, and there are scores of intermittent waterfalls and sub-alpine swamps. The northern edge of the Clear Range is the south wall of Marble Canyon. The highest summits are Blustry Mountain, 2334 m (7657 ft); its neighbor Cairn Peak 2328 m (7638 ft); and north of them, Moore Peak, 2223 m (7293 ft); and Chipuin Mountain, 2170 m (7119 ft). The highest peak in the southern part of the range is Botanie Mountain (bu-TAN-ee), just north of Lytton 2077 m (6814 ft), but higher in the centre of the range is Mount Murray 2153 m (7064 ft). A separate ridge across the Fraser River from Lillooet is named Fountain Ridge. It is geologically distinct, actually a sliver of plate between the Fraser and Yalakom Faults. Arthur Seat, 1672 m (5486 ft), lies in that range on the west side of Spences Bridge, and was named by pioneer John Murray for the similarly-named mountain in Edinburgh, Scotland.BC Names/GeoBC entry \\"Arthur Seat (mountain)\\"Bivouac.com entry \\"Arthur's Seat Mountain\\" Flora and fauna The climate is varied, though mostly dry, especially on the west and southeast. The interior of the range gets more waterfall and is heavily treed relative to the canyons flanking it Typical boreal forest and mountain wildlife prevail: grizzly bear, black bear, black-tail deer, moose, and various rodents. The range's reptile populations include several varieties of dryland lizard and also the timber rattlesnake; the Clear Range is the farthest northwest extent of the rattlesnake. History and culture The Clear Range is largely the domain of the Nlaka'pamux peoples, although the northwest edge of the range is occupied by communities of the St'at'imc people and a rancherie of the Bonaparte River band of the Secwepemc people at Marble Canyon, whose territory also includes southeastern portion of the range along the Thompson. There are no urban settlements or towns in the range although it is skirted by three major highways and also three rail lines (the BCR, CPR and CNR). Due to its location, it overlooked the great movement of goldseekers during the Fraser Canyon and Cariboo Gold Rushes although no major mines or deposits were found on its slopes. At its northern extremity there is a large deposit of low-grade lignite, adjacent to Marble Canyon on the northwestern edge of the Hat Creek basin that has long been proposed for a major open-pit coal mine and coal- powered generating plant. The area is heavily logged but thereby interlaced with logging roads and other trails popular with 4x4 recreationists, mountain bikers and others.

This includes when visualizing veins, the urinary system, spleen, and joints, as well as during computer tomography (CT scan). It is given by mouth, injection into a vein, injection into the bladder, through a nasogastric tube, or rectally. Relatively common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, and skin redness. Other side effects include itchiness, kidney problems, low blood pressure, and allergic reactions. It is not recommended in people who have an iodine allergy. Diatrizoate is an iodinated ionic radiocontrast agent with high osmolality. Diatrizoate was approved for medical use in the United States in 1954. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses Diatrizoic acid may be used as an alternative to barium sulfate for medical imaging of the gastrointestinal tract, such as upper gastrointestinal series and small bowel series. It is indicated for use in patients who are allergic to barium, or in cases where the barium might leak into the abdominal cavity. It does not coat the stomach/bowel lining as well as barium, so it is not used commonly for this purpose. It is used for intravenous pyelography. It is also used to treat Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworms). Diatrizoate may not actually kill Ascaris, but instead it promotes , so may relieve intestinal obstruction caused by impacted Ascaris. =Administration= In principle, diatrizoic acid is administered by the route most appropriate and sensible to image the structure/-s of interest (e.g., IV for blood vessels through which it is distributed and kidney‚Äìureters‚Äìbladder that excrete it; orally or per rectally as an enema for the gastrointestinal tract). *It is given intravenously to enhance contrast in computed tomography, to image the kidneys and related structures, and to image blood vessels. *It is given orally or by enema to image the gastrointestinal tract. *It is given by Foley catheter to image the urinary tract. Contraindications A history of sensitivity to iodine is not a contraindication to using diatrizoate, although it suggests caution in use of the agent. In this case, a regimen of oral or intravenous corticosteroids may be given as prophylaxis, or an alternative such as barium sulfate may be preferable. Gastrografin is contraindicated to use along with certain medications that can cause lactic acidosis, such as metformin. Concurrent use may lead to kidney failure and lactic acidosis, and a clinician may need to space the agents apart over a number of days to prevent an interaction. Gastrografin is a hypertonic solution, and therefore it should be avoided in imaging studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract in patients who are at risk of aspiration, as it will cause prompt pulmonary edema if accidentally introduced into the tracheobronchial tree. Urografin is not to be used for myelography, ventriculography or cisternography, since it is likely to provoke neurotoxic symptoms in these examinations.

Although the board can have any size and shape, a board with unequal edges is generally used to avoid ties. Players may not place stones on the partial hexagons off the edge of the board; these are used for scoring. One player places black stones on the board; the other player places white stones. The game begins with one player placing a stone on the board. To avoid giving an advantage to the first player, a pie rule is used, allowing the second player to switch sides at that point. Players then alternate turns, placing a stone on an empty hexagon on the board. Players may pass; the game is over when both players pass. At the end of the game the players count their scores. A \\"star\\" is a group of connected stones belonging to one player that touches at least three partial edge hexagons. The score of a star is the number of edge hexagons it touches minus two.

Kottayam city is just 5 km south of Kumaranalloor. The region was administrated by the Kumaranallur grama panchayath till 2010, before the local self-governing body was merged into the Kottayam municipality. The former Panchayath office now exists as the regional administrative office for the municipality. The village is situated on the banks of Meenachil river. History Kumaranalloor is an ancient cultural center. The Town is famous for Kumaranalloor Devi(Goddess) Temple and the annual Trikarthika festival of the temple. This place was known as ‚ÄòThingalkkadu', before the temple came into existence. Later the name ‚Äòthingalkkadu' changed and came to be known as ‚ÄòIndu kananam'. In some ancient scripts, the temple is described and known as mahishari kovil (temple). Kumaranalloor Temple Kumaranalloor Devi temple is considered as one of the most important Devi temples among the 108 Durgalayas (Devi temples) in Kerala. The temple is said to be more than 2400 years old, as per historical and mythological evidences as well as other sources of information. The architecture of the temple is notable for the unique structure of the nalambalam and sreekovil both of which have been built in the sreechakra style (ring like object with a handle, which is placed in the right hand of the Devi). This kind of architecture is rarely found in temple architecture.The carnatic krithi 'Sri Kumara Nagaralaye' is a popular kshethrakrithi (composition about the deity of a particular temple) of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal set in Atana Raga and Adi thalam, and many legends including Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, M S Subbulakshmi etc. popularized it. Cheraman Perumal Cheraman Perumal was the ruling emperor of Kerala when the construction of a temple at Udayanapuram near Vaikom to install the idol of goddess Durga began; while he commenced the construction of another temple at a place (which is later known as kumaranalloor) to install the idol of lord Kumara or Subramanian. Meanwhile, a disturbing incident took place at Meenakshi temple, Madurai in Tamil Nadu. The gem-studded nose ring of Devi was stolen or went missing. The king ordered an enquiry. At the same time, he ordered to kill the priest of the temple unless he could solve this problem within 41 days. Because, the nose ring would not be misplaced without his knowledge. However, the priest was innocent. He was confused and perplexed in this dilemma. He took refuge at the feet of Devi. Forty Days As days and weeks progressed, the grief-stricken priest spent his days and nights crying and praying. On the night of the 40th day, he slept at the doorsteps of temple, meditating and contemplating his fate that his life would reach an end on the next day. However, he had a dream that night. Devi appeared before him and ordered him to quit the place at once. The perplexed and bewildered priest winked his eyes. He had seen a thejas (divine light) moving forward. He followed it without being aware of where he was going. The thejas led him a long distance and finally reached the place which latter became known as Kumaranalloor. At Kumaranalloor, the temple was under construction to install the idol of lord Subramanian or kumaran. Sanctum Sanctorum The thejas entered into the sreekovil (sanctum sanctorum) of the temple. Moreover, it was at the prathista time (suitable time of installation) that the thejas entered the sreekovil. Then there was an asareeri (an inerporeal and divine voice), ‚Äòkumaran alla ooril', meaning, ‚Äòthis place is not for kumara'. This is, kumari's or devi's place. Hence it got the name Kumaranalloor. Perumal was disappointed and frustrated. He travelled to Udayanapuram to install the idol of Kumara, at the temple, which was under construction. On the way, Perumal encountered some obstacles but finally managed to reach Udayanapuram and install the idol of Subramanian at the sreekovil of the temple. Back with the Idol Later, Perumal returned to Kumaranalloor with the devi's idol and began the preparation for installing it there. Yet another thought struck him that the idol has to be changed. There was an idol lying in water at vedagiri a nearby place. Perumal brought the idol from vedagiri. Maharshi Parasurama had supposedly made and worshipped the idol in past. At the time of installation, a Brahmin sage with matted hair, came and entered the sreekovil and installed the idol in a second. As soon as the installation of idol was done he vanished. To this date people believe that the Brahmin sage was Maharshi Parasurama. The Brahmin priest, who followed the thejas from Madurai, became the priest of the temple. His residence is known as Madurai illam. His successors worship the Devi even today. =Architecture= The temple is situated in area of 15,000 square metres. The main gopuram (entrance) of the temple faces towards the east direction, and high walls surrounding the temple with other three gopurams (entrance) in each direction (south, west & north). While entering the temple, the temple view presents a divine picture. Getting into the temple through the main gopuram one can see the golden dhwajom (flag staff) and the balickal pura with carvings of many sculptures including those of Ganapathy and Shiva and other saints on pillars. Inside the nalambalam, sreekovil and the main mandapam are surrounded by paths made of carved stones. The temple of Shiva is on the right side of the main sreekovil. Bhadrakali temple is situated on the south of the temple along with the full stretched surrounding path on carved stones for the whole temple. =Murals= Murals in Kumaranalloor temple are precious and rare. The outer walls of the sanctum sanctorum (sreekovil) are decorated with wall painting of hindu gods, goddesses, and incidents from great epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. Natural colours and medicinal plants were used to colour these frescos. =Kumaranalloor Thrikkarthika Utsavam= The important festival of the temple is Thrikkarthika celebrated in the month of Vrischikam (November‚ÄìDecember). On the Karthika day it is usual to make a nivedyam (offering) in the precincts of the Udayanapuram and Thrissur Vadakkunnatha temples. The story goes that the Gods in these two temples, greatly charmed by the beauty of the Devi returning after her Karthika bath. They came out of the temples, got over the compound walls, and stood there looking amorously at the seductive figure of the passing Devi, and the temple priest who ran helterskelter in search of the Gods, finally met them on the walls at the southern end of the temples. Thenceforth, during Karthika, puja is performed over the walls of these temples. The display of lights in the evening, called Karthika Vilakku, is the highlight of this celebration. The temple also manages some Educational Institutions which are: # Devi Vilasam LP School # Devi Vilasam UP School # Devi Vilasam High School # Devi Vilasam Vocational HS School (Specialisation in Medical Laboratory Technology and Computer Application) # Devi Vilasam Public School (English Medium up to 7th standard) =A Century old History of the School= In the year ME 1081 (AD 1905), the School Inspector (Northern Range) Sri M Raja Raja Verma visited the temple and was honoured. He saw many young Namboothiri boys who were not educated and offered to establish a special school for them. Sri CN Thuppan Namboothiri, the then Administrator of the temple were entrusted with the task. As per his instructions and supervision, with 12 students, on the Vidya Arambham day, the school was established. Sri Kumanam K Govinda Pillai, who was present on the occasion, served in the school for 6 months. Sri Kakkanattu Padmanabha Pillai, Thiruvatta Govinda Warrior and such eminent personalities also served in the school. Within 6 months, Rs 19 was allocated as grant and the balance had to be collected from various sources. The first Anniversary Meeting was held in the month of Kumbham in ME 1083. School Inspector Sri R Eswara Pillai presided over the meeting and suggested many ideas for the development of the school. But, the school could not function for a long time. Later when Sri CN Thuppan Namboothiri became the Member of Legislative Council (MLC), based on the memorandum submitted, the school was again reopened with up to 7th Standard. Since the school did not have its own building, after collecting donations from Namboothiri's the present big building was established. The new school building was inaugurated by the then Diwan of Sri Travancore Mannath Krishnan Nair. Dr. Gill, was a special invitee to the meeting and made a felicitation on the occasion. There was a boarding facility also for Namboothiri boys from other places. A Government Grant was sanctioned (Rs. 500) for the boarding facilities. The extra money required for the building, was collected through donations. This school functioned for 4 years. Afterwards, Diwan Raghavaiya visited the school and as per his directions, converted the school into an English medium school. Due to financial difficulties, the school had to close down again for some time. Later, as per the directions of Maharaja of Travancore, the school was converted into a Sanskrit school for the development of which people and devaswom started supporting. Later the school had been open to all as an academic school. Sri CN Thuppan Namboothiri was appointed as the Manager (for lifetime) of the school, but later resigned from the post. The children of this locality started to get the benefit of this school. Moreover, donations were received from many sources, and among them NSS College requires special mentioning. The (Kumaranalloor Uranma) Devaswom had to spend more than it could actually afford for the noble cause of this school.

Early life and education Jacobs was born in Chicago, Illinois. After a tour in the Air Corps ‚Äîduring which time he acquired some broadcast experience‚Äî he graduation from the University of Chicago, he then moved to Mexico City. There, around 1950, he appeared on Mexican radio station XEW and fledgling television station XHTV. Graduate school and early sound recordings In 1952, Jacobs returned to Chicago and began experimenting with reel to reel tape recorders, taking particular advantage of the ease with which they made it possible to manipulate sound directly. Ambient, everyday sound, and especially the structural variety of apparently spontaneous sounds, interested him; at one point he ventured to Haiti to make street recordings. While attending graduate courses at the University of Illinois, he also produced a regular program on the campus radio station (WILL) entitled Music and Folklore, which is believed by some to be one of the first presentations of \\"world music\\" to an American audience. Jacobs often brought experts in certain ethnic musics onto the show to provide background information. When no experts were available, he would not infrequently fake it - most notably in the case of \\"Sholem Stein\\", a putative Hebrew musicologist who claimed that calypso music had deep Rabbinical meanings. These were largely improvised with humorist and colleague Woody Leafer. Career as sound artist Pacifica station KPFA in Berkeley started receiving tapes of Music and Folklore not long after the program began, so Bay Area audiences were already familiar with Jacobs when he moved to San Francisco in 1953 and took up the show in person. While still at Berkeley, Jacobs assembled two tape recorders and re-recorded many of the percussive sounds that he had recorded on the road (and in his own studio) while varying the speed of the tape as he re-recorded them, and then spliced the unusual new percussive sounds into tape loops, recording them again into a montage of loops entitled \\"Sonata For Loudspeakers\\", which first appeared on the \\"Radio Program No. 1\\" Folkways disk, and eventually was included on the 1957 Folkways album, \\"Sounds of New Music\\" (Folkways disk no. FX 6160.) Meanwhile, he continued to pursue an interest in all aspects of sound, in the composition of musique concrete, in improvisational theatre and humor. He met poets Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Kenneth Rexroth, Allen Ginsberg, comedian Lenny Bruce (whose first recording was a Jacobs project, Interviews of Our Times), and percussionist Mongo Santamar√≠a. Most important among these new social contacts were the friendships he struck up with Ken Nordine, \\"the father of word jazz\\", and Alan Watts, a gifted raconteur and former Anglican priest best known for popularizing and interpreting Eastern philosophy for a Western audience. Jacobs, upon taking the helm at his friend Bill Loughborough's record label, MEA, in 1959, set about releasing several recordings of Watts. He was co- curator of the Alan Watts archive. Moe Asch, the founder of Folkways Records, offered Jacobs the opportunity to release his first record, Radio Programme No 1 Audio Collage: Henry Jacobs‚Äô Music and Folklore, in 1955. In 1957, working with artist Jordan Belson, Jacobs produced the Vortex Concerts, a series of concerts featuring new music, including some of Jacobs' own, and that of Karlheinz Stockhausen, and many others - taking place in the Morrison Planetarium in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. Sound designers, including Walter Murch, the sound designer of Apocalypse Now, commonly regard this as the origin of the (now standard) concept of \\"surround sound.\\" The program was popular, and Jacobs and Belson were invited to present a version of it at the 1958 World Expo in Brussels. Jacobs appeared as the narrator, \\"Rheny Bojacs\\", in Jane Conger Belson Shiman√©'s 1959 film Odds and Ends. Jacobs' album, The Wide Weird World of Shorty Petterstein consisted largely of encounters between hipsters and unknowing squares. One interviewer asks about art to be told, \\"Art? He's been with the band about six months. Blows good piano.\\" When the interviewer protests that pianos aren't blown, but played with the hands, Shorty returns the opaque reply, \\"Blow is like an instrument.\\" Shorty also stars in a 1961 cartoon short, The Interview, directed by Ernest Pintoff. =Collaborations with filmmakers= Jacobs collaborated with filmmaker Jordan Belson on the soundtrack for an 8-minute, 16 mm film titled Allures, completed in 1961. In 1963, Jacobs released an album titled The Laughing String. With the backing of the American Cancer Society, Jacobs, in collaboration with John Korty, put together an animated short film about quitting smoking, Breaking the Habit, which was nominated for an Academy Award in 1964. This brought Jacobs far enough into the limelight to get remunerative work as a sound consultant. In the late sixties he created radio advertisements for Japan Airlines and supplied audio/visual ideas to Bank of America's marketing division. Jacobs's approach to sound manipulation greatly interested Walter Murch and George Lucas, and he was tapped to provide some improvised soundtrack material and background dialogue for Lucas's film THX 1138. Jacobs was godfather to sound designer Ren Klyce. In 1972, Jacobs collaborated with Bob McClay and Chris Koch on a series of half-hour television programs for San Francisco public television station KQED. \\"The Fine Art of Goofing Off\\" was a sort of philosophical Sesame Street; each program would develop an open-ended theme, like \\"time\\" or \\"work\\" in an unpredictable collage of brief episodes in a variety of different styles of animation. Alan Watts, improv troop The Committee, artist Victor Moscoso, musicians Mark Unobsky and Pete Sears, Woody Leafer, and Jordan Belson all contributed to the series. The CD/DVD set by this name has been described as \\" a kaleidescopic array of sound bites that are alternately funny, charmingly nostalgic, bizarre, psychedelic or inexplicable.\\" Jacobs was joined by David Grieve on a 1973 film, Essential Alan Watts: Man in Nature, Work as Play, which also described Watts' connections to the Beat movement. Some of Jacobs' work is back in print through Locust Music and Important Records. The bulk of his master tapes were destroyed by fire in 1995, though 63 reel-to-reel tapes were rediscovered by Jack Dangers who released a portion of the material in collaboration with Jacobs in 2005. Henry Jacobs co-stars, together with architect Daniel B-H Liebermann, in Frederik Carbon's documentary feature Sunnyside (2017). Personal life Jacobs resided to the north of San Francisco, where he could avoid \\"electricity and cars.\\" He had three children, practiced Qigong, and was a fervent appreciator of ping-pong and Afro-Cuban music.

A wealthy collector, Hewitson was particularly devoted to Coleoptera (beetles) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and, also, to birds' nests and eggs. His collection of butterflies, collected by him as well as purchased from travellers throughout the world, was one of the largest and most important of his time. He contributed to and published many works on entomology and ornithology and was an accomplished scientific illustrator. Life William Hewitson was educated in York. He became a land-surveyor and was for some time employed under George Stephenson on the London and Birmingham Railway. Delicate health and the accession to an ample fortune through the death of a relative led him to give up his profession and he afterwards devoted himself to scientific studies. He lived for a time at Bristol and Hampstead. In 1848 he purchased ten or twelve acres of Oatlands Park, Surrey, and built a house there. He remained at Oatlands for the rest of his life.

On January 21, 1927, a short film of singer Raquel Meller was shown before this feature at the Sam H. Harris Theater in New York City. The short film, not quite synchronized, was the first public presentation of a film in the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system.Edwin M.

The studio was reportedly inundated by calls and letters from enraged Americans, including deaf and hearing impaired people, to whom the vivid profanity between Sergeant Quirt and Captain Flagg was extremely offensive. In the 1924 Broadway play the roles of Captain Flagg and Sgt. Quirt were played by Louis Wolheim, fresh from his triumph in Eugene O'Neill's The Hairy Ape and William \\"Stage\\" Boyd. Curiously Wolheim and the younger William Boyd would play characters similar to Quirt and Flagg in the 1928 film Two Arabian Knights.

Though he writes easily in both French and English, Virahsawmy is most renowned for his efforts to popularize the use of Creole. Early life Virahsawmy spent his early childhood in Goodlands but after the death of his mother he went to live with his grandparents at Beau-Bassin.www.lehman.cuny.edu After having done his secondary education, he went to Scotland at the Edinburgh University to study languages, literature and linguistics. Political life Between 1966 and 1987, he was a politician and one of the three leaders of the Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM). On 22 September 1970 he became the first member of the MMM to be elected to the National Parliament by winning the vacant seat at by-elections held in Constituency No. 5 (Pamplemousses-Triolet). These by- elections resulted from the untimely death of former attorney general Lall Jugnauth who had been duly elected in Constituency No. 5 at the 1967 General Elections under the IFB banner. On 23 March 1973 Dev Virahsawmy left the MMM and formed his new party Mouvement Militant Mauricien Socialiste Progressiste (MMMSP). Since leaving politics he has concentrated on playwriting. He is associated with the early protest theatre in Mauritius. Virahsawmy is married to Loga Virahsawmy, a feminist and chairperson of Gender and Media Southern Africa.www.winmauritius.net Works Dev Virahsawmy is known for writing in Morisyen (Mauritian Creole) and translations from English and French to Morisyen. = Drama = ** Li.

The first game was released in 1992 for the PC Engine system. The game's sequels and spin-offs later appeared on the Super Famicom, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, WonderSwan, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. Mainly consisting of side-scrolling shoot 'em ups in the vein of Gradius, the Cho Aniki series is best known for its homoerotic overtones, wacky humor and vivid, surreal imagery. Most of the games have never seen release outside Japan. For various reasons, the popularity of the Cho Aniki games has endured since the series' debut. Highlights of the various games include in-game music, innovative control schemes or sheer kitsch value. In Japan, these games are examples of baka-ge, a type of kuso-ge. \\"Baka-ge\\" literally means \\"idiot game\\" while \\"kuso-ge\\" literally means \\"shitty game\\" or \\"shit game\\". Baka-ge's appeal lies in its campiness. Occasionally, the title is transliterated as \\"Choaniki\\", \\"Chou Aniki\\", or (erroneously) \\"Cho Eniki\\". The rights to the series are currently owned by Extreme Co., Ltd., which had obtained the rights of NCS Corp. and Masaya products and trademarks.„É°„Çµ„Ç§„É§ Video games =Cho Aniki= Cho Aniki is the first game in the Cho Aniki series. =Ai Cho Aniki= was the sequel to Cho Aniki developed by Masaya and also released for the Super CD-ROM¬≤. In this game, players control Samson and Adon directly. A key difference in the control scheme of Ai Cho Aniki is that instead of rapidly pressing buttons as a means of firing at enemies, players now had to input intricate button combinations, Street Fighter-style. By and large, Cho Aniki and Ai Cho Aniki play very similarly. In this game, Bo Emperor Conshyasu (BoteiConshyasu, a pun of \\"body conscious\\") raises the Neo Builder Army to fight Idaten and Benten. However, the two fall in love and elope. This leaves Samson and Adon to fight the new threat, Su Emperor Roido (SuTeiLoido, a pun on \\"steroid\\"). This time Taku Iwasaki scored the soundtrack. On release, Famicom Ts≈´shin scored the PC Engine version of the game a 24 out of 40,NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: ÊÑõ„ÉªË∂ÖÂÖÑË≤¥. Weekly Famicom Ts≈´shin. No.324.

The game was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service in 2007 in Japan. =Cho Aniki Bakuretsu Ranto-hen= A departure from the typical Cho Aniki formula has characters from previous games ‚Äî heroes and villains alike ‚Äî battling in one-on-one fights. Playable characters include the following. * Idaten, a warrior with long spiked hair who uses a variety of attacks with his body * Benten, who in this game is flanked by two cherubs who can transform into mini-hunks * Samson/Adon, attacks by gyrating and flatulating. * Sabu, a pagoda-shaped ship with an Elvis Presley-looking figurehead * Mami 19, a strange amalgam of a cute girl and a battleship transporting three naked, frolicking men * Adam, a naked man riding in half a moon. He is intended to resemble Adam from The Creation of Adam portion of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel. * Botei, a berserker, likely to be Bo Emperor (Botei) Bill from the first series * Uminin, an odd latex creature that resembles a condom This game was the last of the series to be developed by Masaya. It was released in 1995. =Cho Aniki: Kyuukyoku Muteki Ginga Saikyou Otoko= was released for the PlayStation the same year as the previous two titles. This game features digitized sprites instead of the hand-drawn anime-style art from the other titles. It was released for the Sega Saturn three months later and the PlayStation Network in Japan in 2009. The subtitle of this game loosely translates to \\"The Ultimate, Most Strongest Man in the Milky Way\\" or \\"The Ultimate, Invincible, Most Galactically Powerful Man.\\" The game is based on the engine of the first Cho Aniki. Idaten and Benten are again the main two characters. Koji Hayama returned to score a few songs for the soundtrack, along with Don McCow, Taku Iwasaki and Sanae Kasahara. Newly-formed publisher MonkeyPaw Games released this game on September 21, 2010 in North America http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/09/20/playstation-store-update-157/ and on October 5, 2011 in Europe on the PlayStation Network. =Cho Aniki: Otoko no Tamafuda= is a video game in the Cho Aniki series. This twist on the Cho Aniki universe pits the heroes of the previous games on a role-playing video game quest in which battles are fought with playing cards. According to an article on the game at the Hardcore Gaming 101 website, the title of the game is a pun. The title translates to \\"Man's Tamafuda,\\" with tamafuda being a portmanteau of tamashii ‚Äî Japanese for \\"soul\\" ‚Äî and hanafuda ‚Äî a Japanese card game. It is also likely that the pun extends to another meaning of tama, \\"balls\\". The game was released for the portable WonderSwan system in 2000. =i (Ai) Ch≈ç Aniki: Gekiretsu Nawatobi-hen= is the first Cho Aniki game released for Japanese mobile phones. The lowercase i is a reference to the i-mode Japanese cellphone provider. =Cho Aniki: Seinaru Protein Densetsu= . It was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2003. With Masaya now defunct, the game was co-developed by X-Nauts and Psikyo. This team also developed Sengoku Blade, and this game plays much like it as a result. The plot of this game centers on the Holy Protein, a godlike glob of what may be semen. Samson and Adon hover around the glob, absorbing enemy fire as they did in previous games. This game lacks playable characters from previous titles, such as Benten, who only appears in some \\"stage complete\\" illustrations. Some of the enemies include a giant, cross-dressing man in an Alice in Wonderland costume and a Mona Lisa painting that fires lasers from its eyes. =Cho Aniki Zero= This is the first Cho Aniki title developed by extreme Co.,Ltd., who had obtained the rights of NCS Corp. and Masaya products. Music The first game was composed entirely by Koji Hayama, who states on his website that Cho Aniki is his favorite work to date. Numerous soundtracks from the various games have been released on CD, Maxi-Singles and even a live performance has been released on VHS. Later games in the series were composed by Taku Iwasaki, Isao Mizoguchi (under the alias Don McCow) and Sanae Kasahara. Cho Aniki in pop culture =Appearances in other games= Masaya also developed the Langrisser series, where Samson and company make a cameo. A hidden level takes the party to an area called the Muscle Shrine, where they must fight Samson. If victorious, the party can then use the Aniki summon, the most powerful summon in the game. The cameo exists in the Mega Drive, Super NES and PlayStation ports of the game. The Capcom video game, God Hand, pokes fun of Samson and Adon as powerless yet flamboyant drag queens who are the first boss of the game. Though technically not part of the series, the Sega Genesis shoot 'em up Wings of Wor (known as Gynoug in Japan and Europe) was also developed by Masaya and published by NCS, and features gameplay and surreal designs similar to the first Cho Aniki game. The Japanese release of the Game Boy Advance game Gem Smashers replaces the three playable characters with three differently colored versions of the Uminin (the original light blue Uminin, and a pink and green Uminin as well). =Samson and Adon= These series mascots are the personification of phallic imagery. For example, they shoot white energy beams from the holes in their heads called the \\"Men's Beam,\\" which is charged up with every firing by both of them rapidly pelvic thrusting into the air. The pair are never specified as lovers or even necessarily homosexuals in the earlier games. However, in \\"The legend of Holy Protein\\", both Samson and Adon's preference are spelt out as \\"men\\". =Cult popularity= Few outside Japan have played the Cho Aniki series, but many know of the game through articles written about it on such websites as I-Mockery, Seanbaby, and Something Awful.http://www.somethingawful.com/d/rom- pit/cho-aniki-bakuretsu.php The series is often mentioned in lists of outrageous, peculiar or sexual video games. Sometime around 1999, gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly ran a passing comment about how the US was thankfully spared this homoerotic shooter (Referring to Cho Aniki for PS1, although the comment was followed by \\"Not that there is nothing wrong with a homosexual shooter\\"). For the next few months EGM's letters to the editor were dominated by remarks lambasting the editors at EGM for making fun of the game, even after the editors repeatedly told their readership that the game was horrible.

Her family immigrated to the United States as converts to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and traveled West to settle in Utah territory with other Saints. She started working at the age of fourteen. At sixteen she enrolled in the University of Deseret, now called the University of Utah, receiving a Bachelors in Chemistry. From there she attended the University of Michigan and received her MD. She became the fourth of six wives in a polygamous marriage to Angus M. Cannon, a prominent Latter-day Saint leader during the anti- polygamy crusade. Cannon exiled herself to Europe so she wouldn't have to testify against her husband. Upon returning to Utah, Cannon worked as a doctor and fought for women's rights. She helped put women enfranchisement into Utah's constitution when it was granted statehood in 1896. On November 3, 1896 Cannon became the first female State Senator elected in the United States, defeating her own husband, who was also on the ballot. Martha Hughes Cannon was the author of Utah sanitation laws and was a founder and member of Utah's first State Board of Health. Biography =Early life= Martha Maria Hughes Cannon was born near Llandudno, Clwyd, Wales on July 1, 1857, the daughter of Peter Hughes and Elizabeth Evans. She was known by the nickname \\"Mattie\\". The Hughes family were converts to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and emigrated to the United States with their two daughters, Mary Elizabeth and Martha Maria. They embarked from Liverpool, England on March 30, 1860, on the ship Underwriter and arrived in New York City, New York on May 1, 1860. Peter was very sick at the time and Elizabeth gave birth to their third child, Annie Lloyd. They stayed in New York to earn money to travel the plains to Utah territory. Erastus Snow, a Mormon leader, invited the family to join a pioneer company funded by the LDS Church for the less fortunate. The family accepted the invitation and traveled by train to Florence, Nebraska, and left with The Joseph Horne Company on July 11, 1861. Shortly before the family's arrival in the Salt Lake Valley, on September 3, 1861, Martha's sister Annie Lloyd Hughes died and was buried in an unmarked grave. She was 21 months old. The Joseph Horne company arrived in the Salt Lake valley on September 13, 1861. Three days after they arrived in Salt Lake City, on September 17, 1861, Peter Hughes died. Elizabeth Hughes was left a widow with two young daughters at the age of 28. Thirteen months later, Elizabeth married James Patten Paul, a widower with four sons, thereafter giving birth to the later Latter-day Saints university professor and newspaper editor Joshua Hughes Paul. After Elizabeth's marriage to James P. Paul, Martha, at different times in her life, went by the surnames of both Paul and Hughes. Later in life, Paul encouraged Martha to follow her dream of becoming a medical doctor. =Education and career= Martha Maria Hughes Cannon in the year 1880. At age fourteen, Hughes taught school for a year, but quit when she had trouble controlling her larger male students. Brigham Young asked Hughes to learn typesetting and she worked as an apprentice for Hyrum Perry. Hughes first worked as a typesetter for the Deseret News. Later she worked as a typesetter for the Women's Exponent, a women's newspaper in Salt Lake City published by Emmeline B. Wells and affiliated with the Mormon Relief Society. While working at the Women's Exponent, Hughes met Emmeline B. Wells and Eliza Snow. These two women were her mentors and encouraged Hughes in her aspiration to become a doctor. In an October 1873 General Conference address, Brigham Young encouraged women, specifically, to enter the medical field and become doctors. The same year, at age sixteen, Martha Hughes enrolled in the University of Deseret as a pre-med major, working as a typesetter during the day while taking night classes. She graduated from the University of Deseret in 1878 with a degree in chemistry. On August 13, 1878, Hughes was one of four women set apart for medical studies and practice by the LDS Church. President John Taylor and his counselor George Q. Cannon set them apart. The other three women were Romania B. Pratt, Ellis R. Shipp, and Maggie Shipp. Pratt and Ellis Shipp had already received their medical degrees while Maggie Shipp and Hughes were heading out to earn theirs. Ellis R. Shipp and Maggie Shipp were plural wives of Milford Shipp. Maggie had been watching Ellis's children in the Utah Territory while Ellis earned her MD. Now as Hughes was heading to the University of Michigan for her MD, Maggie was taking her turn to become a doctor as well. Hughes started at the University of Michigan in the autumn of 1878. With limited funds, she spent her first year working in the student dormitories. During Hughes' second year she worked as a secretary for another student, Bethenia Owens-Adair. She graduated July 1, 1880, on her 23rd birthday. She briefly practiced medicine in Algonac, Michigan. In 1881 she moved to Philadelphia to take post-graduate courses at the Auxiliary Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania. Hughes was the only women out of 75 students. Additionally, Hughes took night classes to learn more about pharmaceuticals and enrolled at the National School of Elocution and Oratory. In 1882 she earned a Bachelors of Science from the University of Pennsylvania and a bachelor's degree in Oratory (B.O.) at the National School of Elocution and Oratory. At 25 Martha Hughes had earned four degrees. Hughes returned to Salt Lake City, Utah and opened a private practice in a new wing of her old home built by her step-father. Soon after, she was called by LDS Church leaders to become the resident physician for the newly founded Deseret Hospital in 1882. As the Deseret Hospital's paid physician, Hughes set up training classes for nurses and lectures on obstetrics. =Plural marriage and exile= While working at the Deseret Hospital, Martha met a Mormon polygamist, Angus Munn Cannon, who was the superintendent of the new hospital and a local official of the LDS Church. Mormon polygamy was a hot topic in Utah Territory. To the Mormons polygamy was sacred but to the rest of the United States it was offensive. In 1882 the Edmunds Act was passed by Congress making polygamy a felony punishable by a $500 fine and five years in prison. When Martha married in the Mormon temple to Angus on October 6, 1884, becoming the fourth of his six plural wives, the marriage was kept secret as it was a religious ceremony rather than a legally binding contract. Martha Cannon's mother knew nothing of the ceremony. Still, rumors of her marriage to Angus brought pressure to the Deseret Hospital. Martha Hughes Cannon was called to testify before the court, but Cannon eluded federal officers. Angus was also called to testify and after a court hearing, was sent to jail. Cannon joined the Mormon \\"underground\\" seeking to avoid providing federal marshals with proof of her plural marriage to Angus. She also feared being forced to provide testimony against others, based on information gathered through her obstetrical practice. Cannon found that she was pregnant after Angus was sent to jail. She had her first child, Elizabeth Rachel, while in hiding and with Angus still in captivity. Evading warrants in 1886, she decided to visit her mother's relatives in Europe and chose to exile herself from Utah territory. Only a few days before her departure, Angus married his fifth wife, Maria Bennion, who was six months younger than Martha. Cannon and her baby, Elizabeth, traveled to New York and then to Europe. Cannon first stayed with her uncle in Birmingham. However, Elizabeth grew sick and Cannon, fearing for her daughter's life, moved to Wolverton near Stratford-on-Avon to stay with other relatives. During Cannon's self-exile, her letters to Angus show increasing jealousy and resentment of his new wife. Cannon wrote to Angus about Elizabeth's improving health also adding, \\"perhaps at this very moment you are basking in the smiles of your young Maria.\\" In 1887 Angus married Johanna Danielson, while Cannon was exiled in Europe, unable to return to Utah for fear of having to testify. Later that year Angus's son, Lewis, traveled to England while waiting for a passport for Switzerland to proselyte. Cannon met him and together they toured Wales, Paris, and Switzerland. Yet, Cannon was increasingly homesick and on December 1887, left Liverpool on the SS Arizona bound for New York. To her surprise, Angus met Cannon and Elizabeth as they arrived. Recently published correspondence between Cannon and her husband during this period provides a window into 19th-century polygamous life in Utah and also on \\"the underground\\" just prior to the practice's abolition. It was a time when many polygamous families went into hiding to avoid legal pressures which threatened to sever polygamous families. =As a suffragist= Susan B. Anthony (first row fourth from left) with suffrage leaders from Utah and elsewhere. Dr. Martha Cannon standing far left. The Edmunds‚ÄìTucker Act was passed while Cannon was in exile. In an effort to limit Mormon religious leadership in government, the act disenfranchised women of the Utah territory who had been voting in elections since 1870. The women of Utah territory had previously enjoyed voting rights, and they began to rally together to fight for suffrage. After Cannon returned she became a leader in the Utah Women's Suffrage Association, giving speeches in Utah and traveling to suffrage conferences with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. At the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, Martha Hughes Cannon was featured as a speaker of the Women's Congress. She then traveled to Washington D.C. to give a status report to a congressional committee on women's suffrage work in Utah. In her fight for women suffrage, Cannon felt that education, freedom, and purpose were vitally important for mothers, stating: She defended polygamy, believing wives in a polygamous marriage may in fact have more freedom than a monogamous marriage stating that if a husband had more than one wife, that wife had freedom in the weeks her husband was away visiting his other wives. In February 1927, three decades after becoming the first women state senator of the United States, Cannon attended the 30th annual convention of the American Woman Suffrage Association in Washington D.C. =Political career= The Utah State Senate in 1897, Dr. Martha Hughes Cannon standing to the left of center. After 1888, Cannon resumed her Salt Lake medical practice and taught nursing courses through a school established at Deseret Hospital. By 1896, a suffrage clause in the new state constitution had restored the right to vote to Utah women. In a heavily publicized election, Cannon was one of five Democrats running as \\"at large\\" candidates for state senator from Salt Lake County. Suffrage activist Emmeline B. Wells and Cannon's husband Angus were among the Republicans running for the office. The five candidates with the largest quantity of votes were elected. On November 3, 1896, Martha Hughes Cannon became the first woman elected as a state senator in the United States with 10,288 votes while her husband only received 8,054 votes. The couple reported that no relationship issues were produced from the election. Cannon introduced three bills in her first month in state senate. In consequence of her bill, an Act Providing for Compulsory Education of Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Citizens, Governor Heber Wells appointed Cannon to the board of directors for the school for the Deaf and Dumb. During her second term as State Senator, she drafted a bill for the building of a hospital at the Deaf and Dumb school. Her second bill was an Act to Protect the Health of Women and Girl Employees. The bill protected women and girls by requiring employers to give female employees something to rest on when they weren't serving customers. At the time nothing was provided and many female employees were left exhausted. Her last bill from her first month in office was an Act Creating a State Board of Health and Defining its Duties. Cannon also sponsored the State's first pure food law. She fought against lobbyists trying to abolish the State Board of Public Examiners. The board was in charge of certifying the qualifications of doctors and midwives, preventing impersonators from potentially hurting patients. As a doctor, Cannon took personal interest in fighting against the lobbyists attempting to terminate an association that protected physicians. In 1898 at the invitation of officials of the National American Woman's Suffrage Association, two years after becoming the country's first woman state senator, Cannon spoke at the Seneca Falls 50th year celebration in Washington D.C. Cannon also testified before the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary of the positive effects of women's franchise in Utah. Twenty-two years later, women's suffrage was added as the 19th amendment to the United States Constitution. During the second half of her term in Utah's state senate, Cannon set up a commission that provided for regulations regarding contagious disease. She was appointed to the Board of Health by Governor Heber Wells, staying in the position until December 31, 1903. Cannon attempted to prohibit children not vaccinated from attending school in case of a disease outbreak. The Board of Health sent out vaccines; however, the Deseret News spread information that vaccines weren't safe. LDS Church leaders were divided on the subject. One apostle, Brigham Young Jr. was very vocal in his opinions, writing in the Deseret News about the evils of vaccinations. The influence of the Deseret News and Mormon religious leaders limited how many people were willing to be vaccinated. Disease grew rampant in the state of Utah, and the smallpox epidemic of 1898‚Äì1899 closed an entire town in Sanpete County. The epidemic Cannon tried to prevent began to spread through the state. To mitigate the effects of disease, Cannon eliminated communal cups attached to water fountains in Salt Lake valley. Cannon's third child was born at the close of her term and subsequently she did not run again for office. At the end of her term, Deseret News wrote, \\"In political conventions, her wit, rapid thinking, and knowledge made her capable of holding her own and of representing her sex most favorably.\\" Cannon lost only one bill: an Act Providing for the Teaching in the Public Schools of the Effects of Alcoholic Drinks and Narcotics on the Human System =Last years, death, and legacy= After leaving the legislature, Cannon still served as a member of the Utah Board of Health and as a member of the board of the Utah State School for the Deaf and Dumb. In 1902 she became a member of the psychology section of the Medico-Legacy Society of New York. The society's main focus was tuberculosis. In 1904 Cannon moved to California with her children for health reasons and became the vice president of the National Congress of Tuberculosis. She also worked at the Selwyn Emmett Graves Memorial Dispensary. After her husband's death in 1915, Cannon settled near her son in Los Angeles, California where he built Cannon her own home. She died in Los Angeles on July 10, 1932. Cannon's body was laid to rest at the Salt Lake City Cemetery next to her husband. In 1986 the new Utah Department of Health building was dedicated and named the Martha Hughes Cannon health building in Salt Lake City. An eight-foot-high bronze statue of Martha Hughes Cannon by Laura Lee Stay Bradshaw, dedicated in 1996, was housed in the Utah Capitol rotunda. Her grandson, Robert J. Cannon, spoke at the dedication. After the Utah Capitol re-dedication in 2008, the bronze statue of Cannon was moved to the foyer of the Utah State Senate building on Utah Capitol Hill. There is also a bronze plaque honoring the \\"author of Utah sanitation laws\\" on a boulder next to a drinking fountain on the northeast corner of 200 West and South Temple. Since 1990, Utah officials have lobbied the U.S. Postal Service for a stamp in Cannon's honor. In 2011 a group of students at Brigham Young University created a stage play and later a film about five strong females of faith, which included Martha Hughes Cannon. In October 2015 legislators formed the Martha Hughes Cannon caucus in an effort to encourage more women in Utah to participate in government. KUED produced an hour-long documentary on Martha Hughes Cannon's life. The Utah State Legislature voted in 2018 to send a statue of Martha Hughes Cannon to the United States Capitol's National Statuary Hall in 2020, replacing the extant statue of inventor Philo Farnsworth.

Rabbinic responsa constitute a special class of rabbinic literature, differing in form, but not necessarily in content, from Rabbinic commentaries devoted to the exegesis of the Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud, and halakha (the codes of Jewish religious law).Oesterley, W. O. E. & Box, G. H. (1920) A Short Survey of the Literature of Rabbinical and Medi√¶val Judaism, Burt Franklin: New York. The codes themselves contain the rules for ordinary incidents of life. The responsa literature covers all these topics and more. Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography: Responsal literature as a whole has as yet found no literary historian; single periods have been discussed while others have been entirely neglected, the works on these separate epochs including: Joel M√ºller, Briefe und Responsen aus der Vorgaon√§ischen J√ºdischen Literatur, Berlin, 1886; idem, Einleitung in die Responsen der Babylonischen Geonen. ib. 1891; Zecharias Frankel, Entwurf einer Geschichte der Literatur der Nachtalmudischen Responsen, Breslau, 1865. The responsa by European and American rabbis to problems arising in America are summarized by J. D. Eisenstein, The Development of Jewish Casuistic Literature in America, Baltimore, 1905. The mode, style and subject matter have changed as a function of the travels of the Jewish people and of the development of other halakhic literature, particularly the codes. Forumulation of responsa, or she'elot ve-t'shuvot, which literally translates to questions and answers, generally involve an individual or group asking either teachers, rabbis, or heads of yeshivot about halakhah (Jewish law) and the party responding via an exchange of letters. Responsa literature spans 1700 years and there are even responsa being developed based on questions posed today. The development of responsa literature can be divided into four periods: the Tannaitic Period, the Geonic Period, the First Rabbinic Epoch,the Second Rabbinic Epoch, the Third Rabbinic Epoch, and the Fourth Rabbinic Epoch. Talmudic era Title page of Rambam's Iggeret Teiman Collected Responsa of Akiva Eger, Bar-Ilan University Library Responsum of Rabbi Shmuel Wosner, Shevet HaLevi, concerning the status of translated works of Torah, in response to a question from Rabbi Shlomo Sztencl. The responsa of the first five centuries are not contained in special works; they are scattered through the writings of both Talmuds (the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud). Works devoted especially to responsa first appear in the post-Talmudic period. Many responsa have been lost, but those extant number hundreds of thousands, in almost a thousand known collections. = Pre-Mishnaic era = No responsa are known to exist from before the Mishnah (200 CE); it is doubtful whether any were written before this period. A tradition held that no halakha (law) should be written down (see Oral Torah). Even when reluctance to write down rulings became obsolete, letters of a legal nature might be written only in cases where laws might likewise be reduced to writing. While the rule prevailed that no laws should be written, no communications of legal content were made by means of letters. Questions were usually communicated orally, or proposed to the academy by a teacher, who transmitted the answer and decision by word of mouth. The rarity of letters on legal problems in the Tannaitic era (the period the Mishnah covers) may be seen from a passage in the Tosefta,Ter. ii. 13 which states that Rabbi Gamliel secretly dispatched a messenger with an answer to a question; for if he desired to keep his decision secret, he would probably have sent a letter had such replies been customary at that time. = Mishnaic era = In the Tannaitic period (100 BCE to 200 CE) statements, publications, contributions concerning the calendar, and notifications were the only documents regularly committed to writing. On the other hand, it can not positively be asserted that no ruling at all had been given in writing before the completion of the Mishnah: certain exceptions were doubtless made. = In the Talmud= Immediately after the completion of the Mishnah, when the prohibition or reluctance against writing halakhot had in great part disappeared, the responsa literature began to appear, traces being preserved in the Talmud. Often questions were settled by a single letter, as was later the case with the Geonim, who exchanged a series of responsa. The replies were signed by pupils and colleagues, so that, strictly speaking, the responsa were issued by a board. With the beginning of the third century of the common era, responsa begin to frequently appear in letters from Babylonia to Israel. By the end of the third century the correspondence between Israel and Babylonia had become more active, and the responsa from the one to the other had become far more numerous. These rulings from rabbis in Israel seem to have been regarded as authoritative and demanding obedience; and the threat was made to Rabbi Judah ben Ezekiel, head of the Academy of Pumbedita, that a letter would be brought from \\"the West\\" (i.e., Israel) to annul his decision.Talmud, tractate Bava Batra 41b ) The same experience befell and Mar UkbaTalmud, Sanhedrin 29a and another, unnamed, judge.Talmud, Shebu. 48b  Geonim  During the Geonic period (650‚Äì1250 CE), the Babylonian schools were the chief centers of Jewish learning; the Geonim, the heads of these schools, were recognized as the highest authorities in Jewish law. Despite difficulties that hampered the irregular communications of the period, Jews who lived even in most distant countries sent their inquiries concerning religion and law to these officials in Babylonia. It was common for Jews outside of Babylon to ask to be sent a section of the Talmud along with ‚Äúits explanation‚Äù or to ask the scholars in Babylon to settle Jewish arguments for which they could not find any precedent. The length of a responsum from this period can span from less than a sentence to a large book. Many of the responsa are still being studied today in the Cairo Genizah. In the yeshiva during this time period, students and scholars would discuss these halakhic questions during kallah and then the head of the yeshiva would announce his decision and the leaders in the yeshiva would sign it. Another type of responsa were those that were more time- sensitive, so the gaon usually responded to them right away and with many different sections in order to answer multiple questions that were posed. Later Geonim also referred to the responsa and commentaries of earlier Geonim when writing responsa. Later in the geonic period (from the mid-tenth to mid- eleventh centuries), their supremacy suffered, as the study of the Talmud received care in other lands. The inhabitants of these regions gradually began to submit their questions to the heads of the schools of their own countries. Eventually they virtually ceased sending questions to Babylonian Geonim, so that during this period responsa of eminent rabbis of other lands appeared side by side with geonic rulings. =Characteristics= *Geonic responsa are written in three languages, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic. In the earliest period Aramaic, the language of the Gemara, prevailed exclusively, but in the mid-ninth century Hebrew began to appear in the responsa alongside it. This innovation was due, on the one hand, to the study of Hebrew (which spread through rabbinical circles as a result of the Karaite movement), and, on the other, to the fact that the rulings of the Geonim were sent to distant lands, where the inhabitants were unfamiliar with Aramaic; it thus became necessary to write to them in Hebrew, the language of the Mishnah. When Arabic became the prevailing language of the Jews, questions were frequently addressed to the Geonim in Arabic, whereupon the scholars used the same language in reply. *Some of the responsa that have survived are in their original form, while others survive only in extracts. The first collection appeared, together with brief geonic rulings, at Constantinople in 1516 under the title Halakot Pesukot min ha-Geonim (\\"Brief Rulings of the Geonim\\"), and in 1575 another corpus, titled She'elot u-Teshubot me ha-Geonim, was published in the same city. At Salonica in 1792 Nissim ben Hayyim edited a collection of geonic responsa under the title Shaare Tzedek (\\"Gates of Justice\\"), which contains 533 responsa arranged according to subject, and an index by the editor. For the majority of these responsa the name of the author is cited, and many of them are reproduced in their original form with their Talmudic proofs and disquisitions. *The responsa are characterized by a more developed literary style than in the Talmudic era. The Talmud had been completed and was recognized as authoritative, and was accessible to scholars. With an accurate knowledge of the Talmud, scholars might deduce for themselves the ruling for any case. Even in instances where the questioner was not versed in the Talmud and the responsum was required to give only a brief decision, the ruling was usually not a mere \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\", \\"permitted\\" or \\"forbidden\\"; rather, the scholars would generally cite a Talmudic passage in support or proof of their decisions, or to rebut an anticipated refutation. Many of these questions have little practical use, but are concerned with the correct explanation of passages of the Talmud. = Earlier Geonim = In the days of the earliest geonim, most questions asked them were sent only from Babylonia and nearby lands, where the inhabitants were more or less acquainted with the Talmud and could visit the academies in the Kallah months to hear Talmudic explanations by leading scholars. The questions, which were submitted in writing, were accordingly limited to one or more specific cases, while the responsum gave in brief form the required ruling and a concise reason for it, together with a citation of an analogous Talmudic instanceFor example: Judah Gaon, in \\"Sha'are ·∫íede·∏≥\\", iv. 4, 69, p. 71 and a refutation of any possible objection.For example: ib. iv. 5, 27, p. 76b = Later Geonim = More discursive were the responsa of the later geonim after the first half of the ninth century, when questions began to be sent from more distant regions, where the inhabitants were less familiar with the Talmud, even if they possessed it, and were less able to visit the Babylonian academies, the only seats of Talmudic learning. Talmudic difficulties were often the subject of these inquiries. The later geonim did not restrict themselves to the Mishnah and Talmud, but used the decisions and responsa of their predecessors, whose sayings and traditions were generally regarded as authoritative. These responsa of the later geonim were often essays on Talmudic themes, and since a single letter often answered many questions, it frequently became book-length in size. The letters of the Geonim, which, for the most part, contained replies to many problems, assumed a definite and official form. They began with the statement that the questions had been correctly received, read, and considered, and that the corresponding answers had been given in the presence of the gaon and with his approval. Rishonim The period of the rishonim, or the First Rabbinic Epoch, primarily consists of the writings from 11th and 12th century Spanish and French schools. With the decline of the gaonate in the first half of the eleventh century, it ceased to be seen as the central spiritual authority for Jews worldwide. From then on, questions were sent to the rabbinical authorities of one's own or a neighboring country. Thus, inquiries sent during this period to Babylonia were rare and exceptional. =Characteristics= * The questions were not all practical. Many were theoretical, concerning the correct interpretation of a halakic or haggadic passage in the Talmud. In their discussion of theoretical problems, the responsa of Spanish scholars are noteworthy for the untrammeled scientific spirit that permeates them, far more than those of the French school. Even in responsa that are practical in nature, a distinction may be drawn between the two schools. Although these responsa can still be found in significant response anthologies today, they are not as significant as the responsa written during the Geonic period. *The responsa of the epoch came from various countries, and from schools having different tendencies, thus showing the position and the type of spiritual life in general and of Talmudic learning in particular, since all these factors prevailed in the different countries at the time. Especially noteworthy is the divergence between the French and the Spanish school in the twelfth century, the second half of this period. For the most part the rulings of this period receive their basis or their confirmation from a passage in the Talmud, and in this motivation the difference between the French and the Spanish exegesis of the Talmud is clearly shown. The Spanish school was the more logical, and strove for brevity and lucidity in the deduction of its rulings from the Talmud, while the French school was more dialectic, and frequently gave full play to casuistry at the expense of clearness. =Eleventh century= *The chief representative of the French school in the eleventh century was Solomon ben Isaac (Rashi), and many of his responsa have been preserved in the \\"Pardes\\" and in the Mahzor Vitry. His decisions are written in Hebrew, without formulas either of introduction or of conclusion, although an interesting phrase that is peculiar to him, and was apparently invented by him occurs once: \\"I, the undersigned, was asked whether ... thus have I heard from my teachers, and thus is my own opinion likewise inclined,...\\" the ruling being followed by the signature \\"Solomon b. Isaac\\", without any concluding formula (Mahzor Vitry, pp. 434‚Äì435). *The leader of the Spanish school in the same century was Isaac Alfasi, who left many responsa, an entire collection being printed at Livorno in 1780, under the title \\"She'elot u-Teshubot ha-RIF\\" (Rabbi Isaac Alfasi). These decisions were written in Arabic, and were translated into Hebrew at an early date, being extant only in this version. =Twelfth century= *The chief representatives of the French school of the twelfth century were Jacob Tam, Abraham ben David of Posqui√®res, and Eliezer ben Nathan of Mayence. **The responsa of Rabbi Tam are contained in his \\"Sefer ha-Yashar\\" as well as in the works of other authorities, such as Meir of Rothenburg and Mordechai ben Hillel, \\"the Mordecai\\". **The responsa of Eliezer ben Nathan, contained in his \\"Even ha-Ezer\\", are partly exegetic in character and partly devoted to practical decisions. **The responsa of Abraham ben David are included in the collection titled \\"Tummat Yesharim\\" or \\"Temim De'im\\" (Venice, 1622). Particularly noteworthy is his injunction that Jewish law obligates Jews to follow the laws of the land, i.e., to follow the laws of the secular government in which a Jewish community found itself living. This ruling is based on the Talmudic saying: \\"The law of the land is valid\\" (ib. responsum No. 50). *The chief representatives of the Spanish school in the twelfth century were Joseph ibn Migash and Maimonides. The responsa of ibn Migash include both practical decisions and explanations of difficult passages in the Mishnah and the Talmud, the first group being written in Arabic and later translated into Hebrew, while the greater portion of the second category was composed by the author himself in the Talmudic Hebrew idiom. =Thirteenth century= The Second Rabbinic Epoch consists of responsa from Spanish and Frenco-German schools in the 13th and 14th centuries. Nahmanides and R. Solomen ben Adret were two of the big scholars during this period. These responsa were written about a wide range of topics including Talmudic passages, ethics, religious philosophy, and more. In this period the difference between the Spanish and the Franco-German forms of responsa vanished. On the one hand, the scientific spirit of the Spanish school partially entered the academies of southern France, and, on the other hand, the dialecticism of the French rabbis steadily increased in influence in Spain. *The chief representatives of the Spanish responsa in the thirteenth century were Nahmanides (Rabbi Moshe ben Nahman), Rabbi Solomon ben Adret, and Rabbi Nissim ben Reuben. **Very few responsa by Nahmanides have been preserved. Those that exist are contained in a work titled \\"She'elot u-Teshubot\\" (Venice, 1523; Zolkiev, 1798), in which are included in great part the responsa of Solomon ben Adret. To him came questions from the most distant communities. His responsa number about three thousand, and in content are partly practical and partly devoted to exegesis, ethics, and religious philosophy. The exegetic rulings interpreted difficult passages of the bible, the Talmud, and the works of older authors, while the practical responsa comprised decisions as to the ritual, civil and marital law, communal relations, and the contemporary political affairs of the Jews. **The responsa of Solomon ben Adret fall into five parts. The first part (Bologna, 1539) contains 1,255 responsa; part two, titled \\"Sefer Toledot Olam\\" (Leghorn, 1654), contains 405; part three (ib. 1778) contains 445; part four (Salonica, 1803) contains 330; and part five (Leghorn, 1805) contains 298. Other responsa by him are included in the aforementioned \\"She'elot u-Teshuvot\\". A few examples of his decisions may be given. When asked concerning many discrepancies between the books of Chronicles and the other books of the Bible, he replied as follows (i., No. 12): \\"A change in phraseology without an alteration of meaning is not surprising. Even in the Pentateuch apparent discrepancies of this kind are found, so that one of the sons of Simeon is called Zohar in and , and Zerah in , but since both names signify 'magnificent', the double nomenclature is explained.\\" In responsum No. 395 he describes his abolition of several superstitious customs, one of which was to kill an old cock, and to hang its head at the door on the occasion of the birth of a boy. Particularly noteworthy is responsum No. 548, in which he gives a decision regarding a marvelous child at Avila, who had originally been idiotic, but later frequently fell into trances during which he composed works whose contents he declared had been communicated to him by an angel. *The chief representative of the German school in the thirteenth century was Rabbi Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg. Many of his responsa have been preserved, the oldest collection being the \\"She'elot u-Teshubot\\" (Cremona, 1557) with 315 responsa, while another corpus, which contained 1,022 responsa, appeared under the same title at Prague in 1608. A collection of unedited responsa was issued at Lemberg in 1860, and in 1891 Moses Bloch published at Berlin a new corpus of unedited responsa of Me√Ør of Rothenburg under the title \\"Sefer Sha'are Teshubot Maharam\\". Maharam, famously, rules that a man may not hit his wife, \\"since,he may not hit another man, despite not owing him honour, whereas he owes her honour...\\". The special interest of Me√Ør's responsa is the picture they give of the condition of the German Jews of his time, and of their sufferings from the caprice of princes and from heavy taxation. The collections of the responsa of Me√Ør of Rothenburg contain also the rulings of other older and contemporary rabbis of the Franco-German school. =Fourteenth century= The principal representatives of the fourteenth century were Asher ben Jehiel (RoSH) and Isaac ben Sheshet Barfat. *The responsa of the RoSH first appeared at Constantinople in 1517 under the title \\"She'elot u-Teshubot\\", while an enlarged edition was published at Venice in 1607. This collection of responsa is arranged according to 108 subjects, each of which has a special chapter, called \\"kelal\\", while at the head of every rubric stands a r√©sum√© of its contents and a numerical list of the responsa treating of each subject. This arrangement, however, was not the work of Asher himself, but was made probably by one of his pupils, possibly by his son Rabbi Judah. From the responsa of Rabbi Asher may be gleaned many curious customs of the Spanish communities. To a question addressed to him from Burgos, Asher responded (No. 68, 10) that according to Talmudic law no arrests could be made for debt, even in cases where the debtor had pledged his own person, although, on the other hand, he noted that it was the custom of the communities in Spain to imprison one who had failed to pay his quota of the royal tax until he should discharge his debt. *The 518 responsa of Isaac ben Sheshet were published at Constantinople in 1546-47 as \\"She'elot u-Teshuvot\\". These responsa contain many disquisitions illustrative of the conditions of the times, including rulings on marriage and marital relations in the case of Jews who had been forcibly baptized, as well as other decisions relating to those who had been compelled to accept Christianity (e.g., Nos. 1, 4, 6, 11, 12, 43). Especially interesting are responsa that describe prevailing customs and regulations of the communities of the period, as in No. 158, which contains a noteworthy account of the seven days of mourning after the death of a kinsman. Acharonim The period of the Achronim, or the Third Rabbinic Epoch includes response of Italian, Turkish, German, and Polish rabbis. Given the political climate and various persecutions the Jews were experiencing throughout this time period, the majority of these responsa were written in response to questions concerning legal matters. This section covers responsa written during fifteenth to the eighteenth century, and includes responsa of Italian, Turkish, German, and Polish rabbis. This period is the richest in the responsa literature. It would therefore be impossible to enumerate all the collections; this section presents a survey of the chief representatives of each century and country. =Characteristics= These rulings are different from those of the previous periods in the nature of the problems presented, in the method of treatment, and in the arrangement of subject-matter. *Since the Acharonim saw themselves as no longer having the independence of the Rishonim, they sought to base their decisions on the older authorities. The field had already been thoroughly worked, and the respondent was consequently obliged to make a careful search for the question asked or one analogous to it, in order to provide an answer. *Previously, the questions had covered many departments of knowledge, both sacred and profane, being concerned with ethical and philosophical problems as well as with halakhic and exegetic themes, so that there was scarcely a subject of human activity or thought on which the responsa might not expound. Among the Achronim, however, the responsa were restricted almost entirely to legal regulations. Since the pronouncement of judgment was regarded as a religious duty, and since in most countries the Jews were unwilling to submit to a non-Jewish court, legal questions formed a large part of the responsa. *Previously, systematic sequence was almost entirely lacking. The responsa of the Achronim had as models the \\"Arba'ah Turim\\" of Jacob ben Asher and, after the sixteenth century, the Shulkhan Arukh of Joseph Caro, so that many of the responsa were arranged according to these two works, while among the later scholars this practice became the rule. *Earlier responsa had been so lucid that the reader could easily follow them. Among the Achronim this changed completely, for pilpul, which had been in vogue since the mid-fifteenth century in Talmud study, forced its way into responsa literature as well. The responsa are remarkable for the hair- splitting dialectics that characterizes them, and often robs them of lucidity. =Fifteenth century= *The most important German respondents of the fifteenth century were Israel Isserlein and Israel Bruna. **The collection of the responsa of Israel Isserlein, \\"Terumat ha-Deshen\\", comprises 354 decisions, which are important as describing many characteristic features of the time. Several of them (Nos. 341-346) discuss the apportionment of the taxes and the assessments, while others are concerned with the attitude to be observed toward a repentant apostate (No. 198). Particularly interesting is the responsum (No. 197) devoted to the problem whether Jews might so disguise themselves as to escape recognition in countries where they were absolutely forbidden to reside. He was lenient in cases of widows who lacked a divorce document (agunah). **The responsa of Israel Bruna, titled \\"She'elot u-Teshuvot\\",, Stettin, 1860 likewise contain many interesting allusions to contemporary conditions, as in the case of No. 71, which discusses the problem whether the Jews might attend races. *In Italy the chief representatives of the fifteenth century were Joseph Colon and Judah Minz. *Especially important in the responsal literature of this century were the Turkish rabbis, among whom the chief were Jacob Berab, Levi ben Chabib, Elijah Mizrachi, and Moses Alashkar. The responsa of Moses Alashkar (printed at Sabbionetta in 1554) discuss whether a converted Jew may be compelled by the provincial court to give his Jewish wife a bill of divorce according to Jewish procedure (No. 75, pp. 136b-137a), and the question of the covering of the head and the concealment of the hair in the case of a married woman (No. 35, pp. 94 et seq.) =Sixteenth century= The chief Polish representatives of the sixteenth century were Moses Isserles, Solomon Luria, and Meir Lublin; the responsa of these scholars throw a flood of light on the condition of the Jews of the period, who evidently took high rank in Poland and were not unfamiliar with military arts, since they offered their services to the duke or to the prince on the outbreak of a war (comp. responsum. No. 43 of Meir Lublin). The chief Turkish respondents of this period were Joseph Caro, Joseph ibn Leb, Samuel of Modena, and David abi Zimra (\\"Radbaz\\"). The responsa of Radbaz, in particular, are characterized by lucidity and strict logic. One noteworthy example discusses whether a Jew may abjure his religion and accept Islam when threatened with death, considering the question in detail, and determines the cases in which a Jew may thus save his life and the contingencies in which he should rather choose death.Responsa, 4:92 The only important Italian respondent of the sixteenth century was Menahem Azariah da Fano, whose responsa were edited at Dyhernfurth in 1788. =Seventeenth century= In the seventeenth century rabbis of various countries prepared responsa, but the Polish scholars were in the great majority. *The chief German representative of responsal literature was Jair Hayyim Bacharach. *Among the Italian respondents the most important was Samuel Aboab, whose decisions appeared at Venice in 1702 under the title \\"Debar Shemu'el\\". *Of the Turkish authorities the most prominent were Joseph ben Moses di Trani (MaHaRIT) and Jacob Alfandari, whose responsa, titled \\"Mu·∫ì·∫ìal me-Esh\\", were published at Constantinople in 1718. * The principal Polish rabbis of the seventeenth century who wrote responsa were Aaron Samuel Kaidanover and Menahem Mendel Krochmal. The decisions of the former, which were published at Frankfort-on- the-Main in 1683 under the title \\"Emunat Shemu'el\\", afford a glimpse of the plight of the German Jews of the time. The responsa of Menahem Mendel Krochmal appeared posthumously; the most noteworthy of his rulings is one (No. 2) in which he decided in favor of universal suffrage in the community, making no distinction between rich and poor, taxed and untaxed, learned and ignorant, but giving all an equal share in the choice of the rabbi, the dayan, and the president. =Eighteenth century= In the eighteenth century the rabbis of various countries contributed to responsa literature, but the most important were still the Polish scholars. *The chief representative of Germany was Jacob Emden, whose responsa form the collection titled \\"She'elot Ya'abetz\\". Lemberg, 1884 *Among the many noteworthy Polish scholars are Meir Eisenstadt and Ezekiel Landau. **The Responsa of Meir Eisenstadt, titled \\"Panim Me'irot\\" contains one \\"particularly interesting\\" ruling, in which he stigmatizes as presumptuous arrogance the practice of ostentatiously wearing white garments in the fashion of the Kabbalists, while the general custom was to wear black clothing.ii., No. 152 **The collection of responsa by Ezekiel Landau, known as \\"Noda' bi-Yehudah\\", was esteemed by rabbis and scholars, as distinguished both for its logical discussion and for its independence with regard to the rulings of later authorities as contrasted with its adherence to the writings of earlier scholars. Nineteenth century to early twentieth century  In this period, many responsa deal with problems taken from modern experience. Responsa have been inspired or necessitated by economic growth, social movements, and advances in technology, which wrought sweeping changes in the lives and living conditions of the Jews in different countries, as well as within Judaic streams; e.g., those of Reform Judaism and Zionism. The movements for the reform of Judaism evoked many responsa in reply to questions concerning the location of the bimah, organ accompaniments, the covering of the head in the synagogue, the seating of men and women together, and prayers in the vernacular. Jewish settlement in Palestine had occasioned many responsa on questions connected with agriculture and horticulture in the Holy Land, including the problems of the cessation of all labor in the fields during the Sabbatical year and the use of etrogs from Israel. Following are representative examples: *Moses Sofer discussed whether the \\"bimah\\" might be removed from the center and placed near the Ark, as is now the case in all Reform and even in many Orthodox synagogues, but was then interdicted as an innovation.\\"Hatam Sofer, Orah Hayyim\\", No. 28 In another responsum he debated whether a Jewish sculptor was permitted by his religion to carve human figures.ib. \\"Yoreh De'ah\\", No. 128 *Joseph Saul Nathanson discussed the problem of the transfer of a corpse from one place of burial to another.\\"Sho'el u-Meshib\\", i., No. 231 In another responsum he replied in the affirmative to a question sent him from New York City asking whether a Protestant church might be changed into a synagogue.ib. iii., No. 373 He was one of the first to permit the use of machinery in baking Matzah. Reprinted from *Isaac Schmelkes passed judgment on the question of civil marriage, which the laws of Hungary permitted between Jews and non-Jews,\\"Bet-Yitzchak\\", i., Przemysl, 1901, No. 29 and he debated also whether electric lights may be used for Hanukkah,ib. ii., Przemysl, 1895, No. 31 and whether the telephone or the phonograph may be used on the Sabbath.ib. No. 58 In addition to the collections of responsa already mentioned, important examples of responsa literature in the nineteenth century include: the \\"·∏§esed le-Abraham\\" of Abraham Te'omim,, Lemberg, 1898 the \\"Ketab Sofer\\" of Abraham Samuel Benjamin Sofer,Presburg, 1873-84 and the \\"Be'er Yi·∫ì·∏•a·∏≥\\" of Isaac Elhanan Spektor., K√∂nigsberg, n.d.  Twentieth century  While many of the responsa throughout history have been written down and can be found in various books or anthologies, a lot of responsa today can be found on online databases such as The Global Jewish Database (The Responsa Project) at Bar-Ilan University. The Schechter Institute's website also has six volumes of Conservative responsa written by the Rabbinical Assembly. = Responsa of Orthodox Judaism = In contemporary Orthodox Judaism, responsa remain a primary channel whereby halakhic decisions and policies are formulated and communicated. Notable collections of Responsa published in the 20th Century include those by Moshe Feinstein, Ovadia Yosef, Eliezer Waldenberg, Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg and Meir Arik. Contemporary responsa deal with both traditional questions and phenomena associated with modern social, religious, medical and technological developments. For example, Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon noted that, while orbiting the earth, the space shuttle experiences a day/night cycle approximately every ninety minutes. Thus, Ramon asked whether he should keep the Sabbath according to Earth time, or mark it once every seven day/night cycles (ten and a half hours). And if according to Earth time, then what location on Earth should this be based upon? The rabbis concluded that he was to celebrate the Sabbath in accordance with Earth time, based on the place of his departure, Cape Canaveral. = Conservative responsa = Conservative Judaism holds that Orthodoxy has deviated from historical Judaism through excessive concern with recent codifications of Jewish law. Conservative rabbis make a conscious effort to use historical sources to determine what kind of changes occurred, how and why they occurred, and in what historical context. With this information they believe that can better understand a proper way for rabbis to interpret and apply Jewish law to our conditions today. Like Orthodoxy, there is no one legal body that speaks for all Jews in their religious community. When defined narrowly as the Conservative movement, Conservative Judaism has two law committees: In the USA there is the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly. The CJLS is the body that sets halkhic policy. There are 25 voting members on the committee who determine whether or not to enact a specific responsa. The responsa are written after a member of the Rabbinic Assembly or the Conservative movement in general poses a question about Halakha. A responsa is deemed approved when at least 6 member of the committee vote to approve it. Despite the fact that CJLS makes decisions about the rulings of responsa, which stands as the decisions for the entirety of the Conservative Movement, individual rabbis can still make their own decision about how to rule on specific circumstances within their communities. In the State of Israel there is the Vaad Halakhah of the local branch, the Masorti movement.

Background Noshiro was the second of the four vessels completed in the Agano class of light cruisers, which were intended to replace increasingly obsolete light cruisers in the Imperial Japanese Navy. Funding was authorized in the 4th Naval Armaments Supplement Programme of 1939, although construction was delayed due to lack of capacity in Japanese shipyards. Like other vessels of her class, Noshiro was intended for use as the flagship of a destroyer flotilla.Stille, Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45 , pages 34-39; Design The design for the Agano class was based on technologies developed by the experimental cruiser , resulting in a graceful and uncluttered deck line and single smokestack. Noshiro was armed with six 152 mm Type 41 guns in three gun turrets. Secondary armament included four 76 mm Type 98 DP guns designed specifically for the class, in two twin turrets amidships. Anti-aircraft weapons included two triple 25 mm AA guns in front of the bridge, and two twin 13 mm mounts near the mast. Noshiro also had two quadruple torpedo launchers for Type 93 torpedoes located below the flight deck, with eight reserve torpedoes. The torpedo tubes were mounted on the centerline, as was more common with destroyers, and had a rapid reload system with eight spare torpedoes. Being mounted on the centerline allowed the twin launchers to fire to either port or starboard, meaning that a full eight- torpedo broadside could be fired, whereas a ship with separate port and starboard launchers can only fire half of its torpedoes at a time. Two depth charge rails and 18 depth charges were also installed aft. Noshiro was also equipped with two Aichi E13A aircraft and had a flight deck with a 26-foot catapult. The engines were a quadruple-shaft geared turbine arrangement with six boilers in five boiler rooms, developing for a maximum speed of . Service career =Early career= Noshiro was launched at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 19 July 1942 and completed less than a year later on 30 June 1943. On completion, she was initially assigned to the IJN 1st Fleet for training off of Hashirajima. On 15 August 1943, she was reassigned to Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita's Second Fleet as the flagship of DesRon 2, replacing the cruiser , which had been sunk a month earlier at the Battle of Kolombangara tabular record: CombinedFleet.com: ‚Äò‚ÄòNoshiro‚Äô‚Äô history =Battles in the Gilbert Islands and Solomon Islands= On 18 September 1943, in reaction to air raids on Tarawa launched by United States Navy aircraft carriers , and , the Combined Fleet sortied to Eniwetok with a massive force but failed to make contact and returned to Truk in the Caroline Islands. Likewise, from 17 October 1943 ‚Äì 26 October 1943, the Combined Fleet failed to contact US Task Force 15 after it bombed Wake Island. On 1 November 1943, the United States launched the Guadalcanal Campaign [the Guadalcanal Campaign was to retake Guadalcanal, the Bougainville Campaign was to retake Bougainville] to retake Bougainville in the Solomon Islands. The day after the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay (2 November), Noshiro departed Truk with Sentai 4's , and , Sentai 7's and , Sentai 8's and four destroyers, arriving at Rabaul on 5 November 1943. While refueling in Simpson Harbor from the oiler Kokuyo Maru the cruisers were attacked during the Carrier Raid on Rabaul by 97 planes from Task Force 38's carriers and Princeton. Noshiro was hit by a dud Mark 13 aerial torpedo. From 12 November 1943, Noshiro assisted its sister ship, , after the latter was torpedoed by the submarine , and attempted to tow it back to Truk. On 20 November 1943, American \\"Operation Galvanic\\" to retake the Gilbert Islands invaded Tarawa. The invasion fleet of 200 ships included 13 battleships and 11 carriers. Noshiro responded by sailing from Truk with Suzuya, , , and several destroyers. The group was attacked on 1 January 1944 by aircraft from the aircraft carriers and . One of Noshiros gun turrets was put out of action temporarily by the attack and ten crewmen killed. On 19 January 1944, Noshiro was dispatched from Truk to assist the aircraft carrier after it had been torpedoed by the submarine by towing it back to Saipan. Noshiro continued on to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, going into dry dock for repairs and refit on 1 February 1944. Six triple-mount and eight single-mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns were fitted. This brought the Noshiros 25 mm total to 32 barrels (8x3) (8x1). =Battles in the Philippines= The retrofit was completed by 28 March 1944, enabling Noshiro to depart for Davao and Lingga on 5 April 1944 with Sentai 4's Atago, Takao and Ch≈çkai, ‚Äò‚ÄòSentai‚Äô‚Äô 5's and and the destroyer . The cruiser group was attacked by the submarine , which missed with all six bow torpedoes, and was also sighted by the submarine , which failed to achieve an attack vector. Likewise, the cruiser group was sighted coming out of Davao Bay on 7 April 1944 by the submarine , which was also unable to attack, and by the submarine on 18 May 1944 which fired a full salvo of six bow torpedoes, all of which missed. Noshiro was at the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 June 1944, where it was flagship of Rear Admiral Mikio Hayakawa as part of Vice Admiral Kurita‚Äôs Vanguard Force. Noshiro escaped from the battle undamaged. From late June-early July 1944, Noshiro again was dry docked and refitted at Kure Naval Arsenal. Two more triple-mount Type 96 25 mm AA gun mounts were installed amidships bringing the total number of 25 mm guns to 48 barrels (10x3, 18x1). A Type 13 air-search and Type 22 surface-search radar were also fitted. On 8 July 1944, Noshiro departed Kure with the destroyers carrying army troops and material to Singapore, and remained in the vicinity for the following three months conducting training. On 18 October 1944, Noshiro was ordered to Brunei, in preparation for the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which began on 22 October 1944. Noshiro, as DesRon 2's flagship, sortied with Admiral Kurita's First Mobile Striking Force, Force \\"A\\" (Center Force). At the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea on 24 October 1944, Force A was attacked 11 times by over 250 carrier aircraft from Task Force 38 comprising the aircraft carriers , Lexington, , , and . Although the battleships , , , and the cruisers My≈çk≈ç and were damaged, Noshiro escaped unharmed. The following day, at the Battle off Samar, Noshiro hit the escort carrier with several 6-inch shells, but was in turn hit starboard side by a 5-inch shell from an American destroyer. She also participated in the sinking of the carrier , which was one of two cases of an aircraft carrier being sunk solely by naval gunfire. On 26 October 1944, west of Panay, Kurita's force was attacked by 80 Grumman TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bombers from the aircraft carriers and . One bomb exploded in Noshiros AA shell magazine, starting a fire that was quickly extinguished. In the second attack, six more Avengers attacked Noshiro, which dodged their torpedoes, but in the third wave, an Avenger launched a Mark 13 aerial torpedo that hit in the No. 3 boiler room. It instantly flooded, and the No. 1 boiler room flooded shortly thereafter. The inrush of water threw all of Noshiros boilers off line, and she came to a halt with a 16-degree list to port. While emergency repairs were carried out and Noshiro dead in the water, the destroyer came alongside and removed Rear Admiral Hayakawa, who later transferred to Yamato. At 1014, a fourth attack of 28 TBMs and Curtiss SB2C-3 Helldiver dive bombers from struck with another torpedo to starboard beneath Noshiros No. 2 turret. Noshiros gunners later claimed to have shot down six of the attacking planes. Captain Kajiwara ordered the forward magazines flooded in an attempt to right the ship. Five minutes later, with the forward deck awash and the list steadily increasing, Kajiwara gave the order to abandon ship. At 1113, Noshiro sank at south of Mindoro. The destroyers and Hamanami rescued Captain Sueyoshi Kajiwara and 328 survivors. Noshiro was removed from the navy list on 20 December 1944.

Spraing can be caused by two viruses, tobacco rattle virus (TRV) which is transmitted by trichodorid nematodes, or Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) transmitted by the powdery scab fungus Spongospora subterranea. The two viruses may have synergistic effects in disease progression when both are present.Beuch, U., Persson, P., Edin, E. and Kvarnheden, A.

Spraing like symptoms can also be caused by physiological defects or specific nutrient deficiencies, most notably Calcium. Control of the disease is generally by ensuring that seed is disease free although the strain transmitted by nematodes can be controlled to some extent by the use of nematicides. TRV spraing vectored by free living nematodes (trichodorid) most typically occurs on light sandy soils during incidence of heavy rain or over irrigation. These conditions are ideal for the nematodes to swim to the surface in order to feed on the tubers and subsequently cause infection. During non wet periods they return to the depths of the soil profile making soil sample testing for trichodorid often unreliable. Different potato varieties show varying levels of resistance to TRV tuber symptoms. Thus avoiding using susceptible cultivars and careful irrigation management is often enough to avoid problematic symptoms. The resultant internal brown flecks can cause costly factory rejections for commercial growers due to loss of processed quality.

It rises at a point south of the Pilanesberg (and the Pilanesberg National Park) to form a curved prominence that intersects suburban Pretoria before it peters out some to the east, just south of Bronkhorstspruit. The highest point of the Magaliesberg is reached at Nooitgedacht, about above sea level. A cableway reaching to the top of the mountain range is located at Hartbeespoort Dam, providing sweeping views of the Magaliesberg and surrounding area.Harties Aerial Cableway Geology The Magaliesberg has ancient origins. Its composition is ascribed to successive geological processes over a very protracted history. Its quartzites, shales, chert and dolomite were deposited as sediments in an inland basin on top of a 3 billion year old Archaean Basement Complex, known as the Kaapvaal Craton. This process of sedimentation lasted for about 300 million years. About 2 billion years ago, a massive upwelling of molten magma resulted in what is now known as the Bushveld Igneous Complex. The enormous weight of this intrusion depressed the sediments that lay beneath and tilted the sediments along the edges so that the broken escarpments faced outward and upward, and the gentler dip slopes inward. During the same period, these sediments were fractured and igneous intrusions of dolerite filled the cracks. With the passage of time these intrusions eroded, especially on the dip slopes, forming deep kloofs or ravines providing rock-climbing potential to modern man. This large dog-leg- shaped area is now termed the Transvaal Basin and includes the lofty escarpment of the Transvaal Drakensberg overlooking the Lowveld in the eastern part of the country. Massive outpourings of igneous material‚Äìvolcanic lava‚Äìof the much younger Karoo Supergroup later covered the Transvaal Basin, but this was subsequently eroded so that it only remains along the Transvaal Basin's southern rim. Climate Silverton, Pretoria. The range forms a natural barrier between the lower lying Bushveld to the north and the cooler Highveld to the south. The range receives rainfall in summer in the form of thunderstorms, with an average of annually. In winter, frost occurs frequently in the valleys on the southern side of the mountain, but almost never on the northern slopes. History Tonquani Kloof in the Magaliesberg Hamerkop Kloof The area around the Magaliesberg range has seen extremely lengthy occupation by humans dating back at least 2 million years to the earliest hominin species (such as Mrs Ples) in and around the Sterkfontein Caves, which lie at the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site, close to the town of Magaliesburg. In the mid-1800s the mountain range became known as Magaliesberg (lit. Mogale's mountain) after Kgosi Mogale. \\"Mogale\\" means \\"sharp\\" or \\"brave\\" person, but is also the common word for a warrior or Tswana soldier, in Sotho bogale means \\"sharp\\" and mogale is \\"brave\\". Similarly, the mountain range to the north, near Sun City, Pilanesberg, was named after the local Bakgatla chiefs, who were called Pilane. In 1822, Shaka, the leader of the Zulu Kingdom, sent his most trusted commander, Mzilikazi, to conquer the Sotho tribes of the region. After accomplishing this task, Mzilikazi decided to break away from Shaka and found his own nation, the Matabele. As he feared an attack from Shaka if he returned home, he settled in the Magaliesberg region. On 17 January 1837, after some Voortrekkers had been attacked and killed by Mzilikazi's impis, they counter-attacked and, under the leadership of Hendrik Potgieter and Gerrit Maritz, and with the help of local Sotho-Tswana chiefdoms, drove the Matabeles north across the Limpopo River. Because the re-conquest of the region was a cooperative venture of the Boers and the Sotho-Tswana against the Matabele, the Boers and Sotho-Tswana had friendly relations at the beginning of white settlement. These friendly relations are reflected in the name of the main Boer town, Rustenburg (lit. resting town), because it seemed to them that they would not have to engage in any more fighting against African communities. The Boers initially settled south of the Magaliesberg in the Highveld, leaving the Bushveld north of the Magaliesberg mostly to their Sotho-Tswana friends and allies; according to Sarah Heckford's memoir, A Lady Trader in the Transvaal, the Boers would move into the Bushveld to visit their Sotho-Tswana neighbors during the winter. According to oral testimony by Tswana headmen recorded around the turn of the 20th century, many individual Boers formed close friendships with prominent individual Tswana headmen and chiefs, especially for the purpose of forming hunting parties to gather ivory and other products from further north. Subsequently the Boers began settling in the valleys of the Magaliesberg Range and in the Bushveld north of the Magaliesberg, and turned the region into some of the most productive farmland in South Africa, while displacing their former allies, confining them to locations and reserves. The area saw some heavy fighting during the Second Anglo-Boer War. The Boers, being extremely familiar with the mountains, used secret pathways across the mountains to launch guerrilla attacks on the British soldiers. In response, the British forces built blockhouses on top of the mountains in order to restrict the movement of the Boer forces; ruins of these structures are still to be seen on the mountain. Control of the Magaliesberg Mountain Range was of great importance to both the Boer and the British forces, especially the two routes between Pretoria and Rustenburg, which crossed it at Silkaatsnek and Kommandonek, respectively. As a result, many battles, such as the battles of Buffelspoort, Nooitgedacht and Olifantsnek were fought in the area. After the war, farms in the area were reoccupied and farming was resumed, tobacco and citrus being particularly successful. In 1923 the Hartbeespoort Dam, situated in one of the valleys of the range, was completed. It became a popular holiday and weekend destination for the inhabitants of Johannesburg and Pretoria, and the villages of Hartbeespoort and Kosmos developed as a result. At present, the Magaliesberg area is still largely agricultural, although tourism is a rapidly growing industry in the area. Kgaswane Mountain Reserve is a nature reserve above Rustenburg covering of the Magaliesberg. Numerous smaller reserves, private and state, are to be found along the length of the range. Magaliesberg Biosphere Reserve Tonquani Kloof, Magaliesberg Rock climbing in Tonquani Kloof After nearly a decade of lobbying and sustained efforts by a small committee of dedicated environmentalists, the Magaliesberg has been declared a World Biosphere Reserve. The announcement was made on 9 June 2015 in Paris by the International Coordinating Council of the Programme on Man and the Biosphere (MAB). This is a UNESCO programme that aims to build a supportive and sustainable relationship between people and their environments. In effect, this means a specific focus on safeguarding natural ecosystems through innovative approaches to economic development. The World Network of Biosphere Reserves, which Magaliesberg now joins, counts 631 biosphere reserves in 119 countries. ‚ÄúWe are delighted with this final acknowledgement of the unique nature of the Magaliesberg and the powerful contribution it is making to our country, to the ecosystem services in Gauteng and the North West and the communities it nurtures over an extensive area,‚Äù said Paul Fatti, chair of the Magaliesberg Biosphere Initiative Group (MBIG) that has been lobbying authorities since 2007 to support the establishment of the biosphere. Vincent Carruthers, past chair of MBIG and renowned author of The Magaliesberg, the most authoritative study of the mountain range, said that this announcement was the culmination of a campaign that began in 2006. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm most grateful there is now international recognition of this great mountain range that has witnessed the whole span of life, from its very origins,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe Magaliesberg is almost 100 times older than Mount Everest and half the age of the earth, a unique treasure for us in this part of Africa.‚Äù Rock climbing The Magaliesberg mountains offer excellent rock climbing opportunities, spread across its many kloofs and escarpments. The climbing is mostly traditional, with a small number of sport climbing venues and hundreds of routes across a wide range of grades. The relatively mild climate allows year-round climbing.

History The Pavilion was named in honour of the enterprising retail Hordern family, Anthony Hordern and Sons, and Sir Samuel Hordern, who was the president of the Royal Agricultural Society from 1915 to 1941. The building is designed in the Inter-War Academic Classical Style with rendered masonry featuring classical detailing inside and out, including fluted Doric columns, a parapet and an imposing vaulted roof with lantern tower. Designed by Northern Sydney architecture firm Trenchard Smith & Maisey, it cost ¬£45,000 to originally build. The pavilion was officially opened on 2 April 1924 by the Premier, Sir George Fuller.

His father was the German immigrant Gustav Baumgart and his mother was Mathilde Odebrecht, daughter of the German immigrant and engineer Emil Odebrecht. A typical German-Brazilian of his days, Em√≠lio Henrique Baumgart was bilingual, speaking both German and Portuguese fluently. Education Em√≠lio Henrique Baumgart started his studies in his home state but also studied in the city of S√£o Leopoldo in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Later, he attended the Escola Polit√©cnica do Rio de Janeiro (today's Escola de Engenharia da UFRJ). Career While attending the Escola Polit√©cnica, Baumgart worked as an intern with the Firma L. Riedlinger (an engineering firm located in Rio de Janeiro). Lambert Riedlinger brought the reinforced concrete building technique from Germany at the time. As a result, Baumgart became well known for his innovative projects throughout Brazil and abroad.

The accumulation of factors of production per se does not explain economic development. They are necessary factors of production, but they are not sufficient for economic growth. Human creativity and productive entrepreneurship are needed to combine these inputs in profitable ways, and an institutional environment that encourages productive entrepreneurship becomes the ultimate determinant of economic growth. Thus, the entrepreneur and entrepreneurship should take center stage in any effort to explain long-term economic development. Early economic theory, however, did not pay proper attention to the entrepreneur. \\"The theoretical firm is entrepreneurless ‚Äì the Prince of Denmark has been expunged from the discussion of Hamlet\\". This oft-quoted observation was made by William Baumol in the American Economic Review. The article was a prod to the economics profession to attend to this neglected factor. If entrepreneurship remains as important to the economy as ever, then the continuing failure of mainstream economics to adequately account for entrepreneurship indicates that fundamental principles require re-evaluation. The characteristics of an entrepreneurial economy are high levels of innovation combined with high level of entrepreneurship, which result in the creation of new ventures as well as new sectors and industries. Entrepreneurship is difficult to analyse using the traditional tools of economics, e.g. calculus and general equilibrium models. Current textbooks have only a passing reference to the concept of entrepreneurship and the entrepreneur. Equilibrium models are central to mainstream economics, and exclude entrepreneurship. Coase believed that economics has become a \\"theory- driven\\" subject that has moved into a paradigm in which conclusions take precedence over problems. \\"If you look at a page of a scientific journal like Nature,\\" he said, \\"every few weeks you have statements such as, 'We‚Äôll have to think it out again. These results aren't going the way we thought they would.' Well, in economics, the results always go the way we thought they would because we approach the problems in the same way, only asking certain questions. Entrepreneurial Economics challenges fundamental principles, using insights from models and theories in the natural sciences.\\" Studies about entrepreneurs in economics, psychology and sociology largely relate to four major currents of thought. Early thinkers such as Max Weber emphasized its occurrence in the context of a religious belief system, thereby suggesting that some belief systems do not encourage entrepreneurship. This contention has, however, been challenged by many sociologists. Some thinkers such as K Samuelson believe that there is no relationship between religion, economic development and entrepreneurship. Karl Marx considered the economic system and mode of production as its sole determinants. Weber suggested a direct relation between the ethics and economic system as both interacted intensively. Another current of thought underscores the motivational aspects of personal achievement. This overemphasized the individual and his values, attitudes and personality. This thought, however, has been severely criticized by many scholars such as Kilby (1971) and Kunkel (1971). Economic functions of the entrepreneur =Richard Cantillon= Richard Cantillon (1680?-1734) was the earliest scholar of whom we know that paid considerable attention to the entrepreneur. He introduced the very concept of entrepreneur. The entrepreneur is functionally described as arbitrager. The motivating factor is the potential profit generated from the activity of \\"buying at a certain price and selling at an uncertain price\\". =Jean-Baptiste Say= Jean-Baptiste Say, who has been an entrepreneur during a period of his life, recognizes the \\"superior kind of labour\\" of the entrepreneur. He is the \\"coordinator, modern leader and manager within his firm\\". He is a kind of \\"super-manager\\" because the exercise of the function needs a combination of rare qualities and experience: \\"Judgement, perseverance, and a knowledge of the world as well as of business...the art of superintendence and administration\\". To Say, a successful entrepreneur must demonstrate prudence, probity and regularity. =Frank Knight= Frank KnightRisk Uncertainty & profits, 1921 saw the entrepreneur as someone who undertakes business decisions under conditions of 'uncertainty'. Knightian uncertainty exists where there is no basis for objective probabilities, so that it is unmeasureable and decisions have to be made using subjective judgment. The entrepreneur earns economic profits as a reward for good judgment. Entrepreneurs are seen as being confident and venturesome. =Schumpeter= Schumpeter's concept is a synthesis of three different notions of the entrepreneur: risk bearer, innovator and a coordinator. He assigned the role of innovator to the entrepreneur, driving economic growth through a process of creative destruction, and not to the capitalist. Capitalists supply capital while entrepreneurs innovate. He stated that \\"whatever the type, everyone is an entrepreneur only when he actually carries out a new combination and loses that character as soon as he has built up his business, when he settles to running it as other people run their business.\\"Schumpeter, 1934, p. 78 The focus here is not on a category of person, but on a function. He was perhaps influenced by his family history. The Schumpeterian entrepreneur disrupts existing equilibrium. Innovation is a chaotic, unpredictable economic process, which cannot be modeled using the equilibrium based analytic methods used in mainstream economic theory. =Israel Kirzner= Israel Kirzner, an economist of the Austrian School, sees the entrepreneur as an arbitrageur who is alert to opportunities for profit that exist due to market disequilibrium. =Harvey Leibenstein= Harvey Leibenstein claimed that entrepreneurship is a creative response to x-inefficiency. Entrepreneurs are also gap-fillers, having the ability to perceive market opportunities and to develop new goods/services that are not currently being supplied. He postulates that entrepreneurs have the special ability to connect markets and make up for market deficiencies. Additionally, drawing from the theories of J.B. Say and Richard Cantillon, Leibenstein suggests that entrepreneurs have the ability to combine various inputs into new innovations in order to satisfy unfulfilled market demand.Leibenstein, 1995 =Baumol= Baumol has argued that entrepreneurship can be either productive or unproductive. Unproductive entrepreneurs may pursue economic rents or crime. Societies differ significantly in how they allocate entrepreneurial activities between the two forms of entrepreneurship, depending on the 'rules of the game' such as the laws in each society. =David Audretsch= Audretsch defines the entrepreneur as the missing link between investment in knowledge and growth. It is the entrepreneur who adds value to scientific discovery. Entrepreneurship capital is then, just as capital and labor in a macroeconomic model, an essential factor of production in the economy.

Following the recommendations of the savings bank committee, withdrawal limits of accounts were raised from S$200 once every seven days to S$500 once every three days, longer banking hours, exempting interest earned on POSB savings accounts from income tax, and accepting non-Romanised signatures for operating accounts.Annual report of the Singapore Post Office Savings Bank, 1966.

A Turbojugend member can be recognised by their specially-made denim jackets with the Turbonegro logo and \\"Turbojugend [name of chapter]\\" stitched on the back. The logo of Turbojugend Oslo can be found on almost every album Turbonegro has made. There are more than 2300 chapters worldwide.  Origins  Turbonegro guitarist Euroboy explained the club's origin: \\"We thought about how Kiss had the Kiss Army so we thought that Turbonegro should have our own Navy. It started as a joke in Happy-Tom‚Äôs apartment in 1995. We put his address on the album sleeves and it was all just for laughs.

Happy Tom has implied that the band have a complicated relationship with the Turbojugend: 'It's a kind of fearful and hostile relationship we have with them... I think if we put out a bad record we'd probably get beaten up. The Turbojugend are starting to remind me quite a lot of the Manson Family - except they do beer and speed instead of LSD and they haven't killed anyone... yet!' Ever since its initial foundation, Turbojugend has more and more become a movement independent of the band itself. According to a poll on a TJ-website, a majority of members would choose the Jugend, if they had to decide between band and TJ.  The jackets  The jacket, commonly known as a \\"Kutte\\", first appeared in the late '90s. Bitzcore Records customized Levi jackets by embroidering the \\"Turbojugend Oslo\\" logo on them, but eventually changed Oslo to St. Pauli. The jackets became so sought-after that Bitzcore Records-run Turbonegro Mailorder started ordering Levi jackets from the factory with \\"Turbojugend Oslo\\" already embroidered on them. These jackets were available for a couple of years but do not hold the same status as the originals, which were locally created in very limited numbers. Eventually, Turbonegro Mailorder made it possible to buy jackets with the names of other chapter cities on them; this is how Turbojugend Worldwide was started. The back of a \\"kutte\\" Members who travel around the world frequently trade patches or buttons with chapter members in different countries, to place them on their own jackets. This is usually a good way to spot well-travelled members, but internet trading does occur and some still prefer a jacket with few to no other patches or buttons.  Welt-Turbojugend-Tage  Group photo of Turbojugend Members at the \\"Welt-Turbojugend-Tage\\" 2006 Once a year, Turbojugends from all over the world meet in St. Pauli, Hamburg, Germany to celebrate Turbonegro themselves as well as punk rock in general. This 2-day event is called Welt-Turbojugend-Tage (\\"World Turbojugend Days\\") with concerts and meetings in different clubs. In 2011 the 7th edition of WTJT was held featuring the comeback of Turbonegro, with Duke of Nothing on vocals. In addition to the Welt-Turbojugend-Tage in Hamburg, in recent years, the Punk Rock Bowling festival in Las Vegas has served as meeting point for Turbojugend chapters Worldwide. Each year, several hundred members can be encountered there.  Bands  Even though Turbojugend is the fan club of Turbonegro, Turbojugend has also taken a shine to other rock bands as well. Some of these bands are: * Silver (Former band of Turbonegro drummer, Tommy Manboy) * Brainerd * Peter Pan Speedrock * The Turbo A.C.'s * Trashcan Darlings * The Dukes Of Nothing (former band of Turbonegro vocalist, Tony Sylvester) * Valient Thorr  Leadership  When Turbojugend was first started by the band (Turbonegro), there was no clear leader, instead it was intended to be a flat- structured entity based on the principles of classic anarchist thought. In the late 1990s Bitzcore Records starting taking over and began to produce the jackets as a merchandising venture, with the owners of Bitzcore assuming the leadership role, using names such as \\"El Presidente\\" and \\"Il Consiglieri\\". However, in 2012 the band regained ownership and handed the leadership over to two groups. These groups were the Turbojugend Amb-ASS-adors and Jugendwart, both groups put together of well experienced members.

In this construction, the subject of a subordinate clause is put in the accusative case (objective case in English) and the verb appears in the infinitive form. Among other uses, information may be given in this form to indicate indirect speech, also called indirect discourse. The construction is often referred to by the Latin term Accusativus cum infinitivo, frequently abbreviated ACI. In Latin The accusative and infinitive is the usual grammatical construction by means of which Classical Latin expressed indirect statements, that is, statements which report what someone has said, thought, felt, etc. Whereas a direct statement would say :\\"I am a good student,\\" says Julia. the indirect statement might say :Julia says that she is a good student. Classical Latin tends not to use a conjunction equivalent to the English \\"that\\" to introduce indirect statements. Rather, an accusative subject is used with an infinitive to develop the appropriate meaning. For example, translating the aforementioned example into Latin: : :literally: 'Julia says herself to be a good student.' here is an accusative reflexive pronoun referring back to the subject of the main verb i.e. ; is the infinitive \\"to be.\\" Note that the tense of the infinitive, translated into English, is relative to the tense of the main verb. Present infinitives, also called contemporaneous infinitives, occur at the time of the main verb. Perfect infinitives (prior infinitives) occur at a time before the main verb. Future infinitives (subsequent infinitives) occur at a time after the main verb. For example, the contemporaneous infinitive in this sentence, : would still be translated \\"They said he was helping her,\\" even though iuvƒÅre is a present infinitive. Passive periphrastic infinitives, i.e. the gerundive + , indicate obligatory action in indirect statements, e.g. , \\"Gaius says that the letters ought to be written by you.\\"Wheelock, Frederic M. Wheelock's Latin, HarperCollins, 2005. In late classical and Medieval Latin, the ACI gradually gave way to a construction with with the subjunctive. : This was probably the more common usage in spoken Latin and is the form used consistently in Jerome's Vulgate, which reflects a colloquial style. It is also the equivalent of the Greek indirect statement introduced by . This is the origin of the construction in the modern Romance languages such as French: :Julia dit qu'elle est une bonne √©l√®ve. In English and Spanish In English, the ACI construction occurs with verbs of wishing, saying and perceiving (e.g. I would like the President to be successful; I saw her go, I believe that to be true) as well as in causative clauses (e.g. She made me eat the vegetables; The teacher let him stand outside the classroom). Depending on the valency of the main verb in the sentence, English may use a full infinitive (with to) or a bare infinitive (without to). The verbs make, see and hear have the interesting characteristic of using a bare infinitive in the active voice and a full infinitive in the passive: :I saw her enter the restaurant :She was seen to enter the restaurant In Spanish, the ACI is used in causatives as well (Me oblig√≥ a mirarlo \\"He forced me to look at him\\") and in perception verbs (Los vi caminar por aqu√≠ \\"I saw them walk around here\\"), but it is not permitted in other cases. For example, in English one may say I told him to do it, but in Spanish one must say Le dije que lo hiciera \\"I said to him that he do it\\" (using the subjunctive mood), not *Le dije hacerlo or any other construction with the infinitive.

It offers interactive on-screen program listings that enable viewers to navigate, sort, select and schedule television programming for viewing and recording. The differing names are only used for marketing purposes ‚Äì the entire system is owned by Rovi Corporation, the successor to Gemstar-TV Guide International. In 2016, Rovi acquired digital video recorder maker TiVo Inc., and renamed itself TiVo Corporation. In late 2012, Rovi issued a notice to its North American users through the Guide Plus+, TV Guide On Screen and 'Rovi Guide' message system that broadcast transmission of the service would cease beginning in November 2012, and be discontinued gradually through April 2013.Retrieved from http://www.avsforum.com/t/1122914/lightbox/post/22575551/id/88163. The service was discontinued in Europe by the end of 2016. Technical overview The system was launched in the United States and Japan in the mid-1990s, and began to be deployed throughout Europe during the 2000s. It is also available for broadcast and cable services in Canada, France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. Companies that manufacture products that are compatible with the system include those made by Channel Master, Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita/Panasonic, Thomson (RCA, GE and ProScan), Samsung, Sharp, Sony, LG Group and Toshiba. Since the service is advertiser-supported, the updated program listings are provided to users free- of-charge, regardless of whether they receive their television signal over- the-air or via cable or satellite television. Gemstar also produced EPG computer software bundled with analog NTSC TV tuner cards made by ATI Technologies, particularly the TV Wonder and All-in-Wonder lines. ATI later partnered with TitanTV to provide its digital ATSC cards. The original analog service uses the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of host television stations that datacast the service, similar to the manner that closed captioning and teletext are broadcast. This can take 24 hours to download on the initial setup, because the information is delivered at a low bitrate. Digital television The digital service was launched in the United States in 2006, using the ATSC digital television standard. Although the implementation of the digital transmissions improved the service significantly, older systems were no longer able to download listings following the June 12, 2009 digital television transition. The Program and System Information Protocol (PSIP) utilized by the ATSC standard allows for each television station to send out its own program listings information; in the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires broadcast stations to provide programming information over PSIP, but not cable providers, unless they rebroadcast a broadcast television station that provides PSIP data. However, actual implementation is rather scattered, and usually minimal; often cases, stations do not provide full programming descriptions or even display the correct information about the program currently airing, much less programming information for the next three hours that is required of them, or the guide information over a 16-day period that can be transmitted. Additionally, ATSC tuners are not required to show the EPG, only the very limited information for the current show on the channel being viewed. While the TV Guide service also requires software installed in a television set or other device, and licensing fees or royalties must be paid to Rovi, it also offers a more complete solution for broadcast television, more like digital satellite or digital cable.

Completed in 1942, she escorted a troop convoy to New Guinea in December. In early 1943 the ship participated in Operation Ke, the evacuation of Japanese troops from Guadalcanal. Six months later Agano transported troops and supplies to New Guinea and she played a minor role in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay in early November. A few weeks later, the ship was badly damaged by American airstrikes and she sailed for Truk under her own power the following day. While en route, Agano was torpedoed by an American submarine and had to be towed to her destination. After several months of repairs, she left for Japan, but was intercepted and sunk by another American submarine in February 1944. Most of her crew was rescued by her escorting destroyer, but that ship was sunk with the loss of most of her crew and all of Aganos survivors by an American airstrike the following day. Design and description The Agano- class ships were intended to replace the obsolete light cruisers built in the 1910s and 1920s as flagships of destroyer flotillas. The ships measured long overall with a beam of and had a draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load.Whitley, p. 186 The ships had a crew of 51 officers and 649 enlisted men; assignment as a flagship added 6 officers and 20 more sailors.Lacroix & Wells, p. 591 The Agano class had four geared steam turbine sets, each driving a single propeller shaft, using steam provided by six Kampon Ro G≈ç water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of and give the ships a speed of . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at a speed of .Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 111 =Armament and protection= The main armament of the Agano class consisted of six 41st Year Type guns in three twin-gun turrets, two superfiring in front of the superstructure and one aft. The secondary armament included four Type 98 8 cm (3 in) anti-aircraft (AA) guns in two twin-gun mounts amidships.Stille, pp. 35‚Äì36 The suite of light anti-aircraft weapons included a pair of triple mounts for Type 96 AA guns and two twin-gun mounts for Type 93 anti-aircraft machineguns. The ships also had two rotating quadruple torpedo launchers on the upper deck for Type 93 (Long Lance) torpedoes on the centerline and had a reload system with eight spare torpedoes. The Agano-class ships were also fitted with a pair of Aichi E13A floatplanes and a catapult.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 571‚Äì72, 579‚Äì580 To detect submarines, the Aganos were equipped with a Type 93 Model 2 hydrophone installation and a Type 93 Model 3 sonar. They were equipped with two depth charge chutes for 18 depth charges and could also carry three mines.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 579‚Äì581 The propulsion machinery was protected by a waterline armor belt thick with transverse bulkheads fore and aft of the propulsion machinery and a middle deck of the same thickness. The ships' magazines were enclosed in armored boxes with sides, 20-millimeter tops and 20- or 25-millimeter ends.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 563‚Äì564 Construction and career Agano, named for the Agano River,Lacroix & Wells, p. 562 was laid down at Sasebo Naval Arsenal on 18 June 1940, launched on 22 October 1941 and completed on 31 October 1942. She was assigned as flagship of Destroyer Squadron 10 () of the Third Fleet on 20 November after working up. The ship departed Kure six days later and arrived at Truk in the Caroline Islands on 1 December where Rear Admiral Susumu Kimura hoisted his flag aboard her the following day.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 593‚Äì594 On 16 December Agano escorted the aircraft carrier and a troop convoy to Wewak and Madang in New Guinea. The ships briefly covered the landing of Japanese forces at Hollandia before returning to Truk on 20 December. Agano escorted the forces covering the evacuation of Japanese troops from Guadalcanal Island (Operation KE) from 31 January to 9 February 1943, during which 11,700 Japanese soldiers were removed.Hackett & Kingsepp The ship was transferred to the 1st Mobile Fleet the following day. She returned to Kure Naval District in early May for her sea trials and was then assigned to the Combined Fleet preparing to counterattack the American offensive in the Aleutian Islands, but this operation was cancelled after the Allied victory on Attu on 29 May. Agano was refitted at the Kure Naval Arsenal from 3 June to 2 July. The ship exchanged her 13.2 mm machine guns for a pair of twin-gun Type 96 mounts and another pair of triple 25 mm mounts were added amidships, giving her a total of sixteen 25 mm guns. A Type 21 early-warning radar was also installed.Lacroix & Wells, p. 594 Agano departed for Truk on 9 July escorting the First Carrier Division while carrying troops and supplies. Despite numerous sightings by American submarines and an attack on the aircraft carrier , the convoy made it safely to Truk on the 15th. Agano helped to ferry troops and supplies to Rabaul on 19‚Äì26 July. In response to the American carrier raid on Tarawa on 18 September, the ship and much of the fleet sortied for Eniwetok to search for the American forces before they returned to Truk on 23 September, having failed to locate them. The Japanese had intercepted some American radio traffic that suggested another attack on Wake Island, and on 17 October, Agano and the bulk of the fleet sailed for Eniwetok to be in a position to intercept any such attack, but no attack occurred and the fleet returned to Truk. =Battle of Empress Augusta Bay= A map of Bougainville The ship, now the flagship of Rear Admiral Morikazu Osugi, departed Truk on 30 October for Rabaul just as the Americans were preparing to invade Bougainville Island on 1 November. The Japanese attempted to disrupt the landings on the night of 1/2 November with a force of two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, including Agano, and six destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Sentar≈ç ≈åmori. The Japanese ships had been spotted by American aircraft around 21:00 and Task Force 39, which consisted of four light cruisers and eight destroyers, was ordered to intercepted them.O'Hara, pp. 206‚Äì207 Omori arranged his ships in three staggered columns; the outer ones were each led by one of the light cruisers followed by three destroyers and the two heavy cruisers were in the middle. Osugi in Agano led the southernmost column, which trailed the main body. One of the cruiser floatplanes claimed to have spotted a cruiser and three destroyers south at 01:20 and ≈åmori ordered his ships to make a 180-degree maneuver intended to buy time for the pilot to investigate Empress Augusta Bay for American shipping. Less than an hour later, he reported that American transports crowded the bay; the pilot had actually spotted three minelayers and their destroyer escort that were leaving the bay. Omori ordered his ships to reverse course at 02:25. In the darkness, and with most ships lacking radar, the Japanese formation of three columns was disordered by the maneuvers and commanders lost track of where their ships were in relation to each other.O'Hara, pp. 207, 209‚Äì210 American radar picked up the Japanese at a range of at 02:27 and Rear Admiral Aaron Merrill, commander of the task force, ordered his destroyers to attack with their torpedoes while his cruisers stood off to avoid Japanese torpedoes and would open fire when the torpedoes struck their targets to maintain the element of surprise. The leading division of four destroyers fired a salvo of 25 torpedoes by 02:46, but they were detected as they turned away and the Japanese turned into the torpedoes to makes themselves smaller targets. Their maneuvering caused Merrill to believe that his ships had been spotted and the first of his cruisers opened fire at the light cruiser , leading the northernmost column, three minutes later.O'Hara, pp. 210‚Äì211 The abrupt maneuvers by the Japanese ships, both to evade the American torpedoes and to fire their own, led to one collision and several near misses early in the battle. Most of the American cruisers were firing at the heavy cruisers in the center column by 03:05 and Omori turned away in a 270-degree turn that cut across the path of Aganos column. The heavy cruiser rammed and crippled the destroyer while the heavy cruiser nearly struck the destroyer . Incorrectly believing that he had sunk three of the American cruisers, Omori ordered his ships to cease fire at 03:29 and turned away to disengage four minutes later. Osugi, who had kept his ships on the disengaged side of the heavy cruisers after the collision, fired a parting shot of eight torpedoes at 03:40, all of which missed.O'Hara, pp. 211‚Äì214 After returning to Rabaul, Agano was near-missed by a bomb when the aircraft carriers and attacked the port on 5 November. The bomb damaged one anti-aircraft gun and killed one crewman. Agano and her sister put to sea on the following day to destroy the American forces near Empress Augusta Bay, but this was cancelled and the ships returned to Rabaul on 7 November. Four days later, the American aircraft carriers of Task Group 50.2 attacked Rabaul. Agano was hit by a Mark 13 torpedo which blew off the very end of her stern and bent her rearmost propeller shafts. The ship's rudder was not damaged, although Osugi was injured in the attack. After emergency repairs were made by the ship's crew, Agano departed Rabaul under her own power the next day, escorted by the destroyer . Not long after their departure, the ships were sighted by the American submarine , which launched six torpedoes. One of them struck the cruiser amidships, flooding all of the boiler rooms, which knocked out all power. While attempting to repair the damage, the submarine attempted to attack, but was prevented from doing so by depth charges from Urakaze. Noshiro and the light cruiser were ordered to her assistance on the 13th and her sister took Agano in tow upon her arrival. The tow parted the following day and Nagara took over the task. The damaged ship finally reached Truk on 16 November.Lacroix & Wells, p. 595 =Sinking= Temporary repairs by the repair ship began immediately upon her arrival and lasted until 15 February 1944. That evening she departed Truk to get permanent repairs in the Japanese home islands, escorted by the destroyer and submarine chaser CH-28. On the afternoon of 16 February, about north of Truk, Agano was attacked by the submarine , which fired four torpedoes. Two struck the cruiser on the starboard side at 16:44, flooding Boiler Room No. 2 which gave her a list of 12¬∞ and started a large fire. The ship progressively flooded and Oite rescued 523 survivors between 20:00 and 23:30. Agano sank at at 01:50 on 17 February and was struck from the navy list on 31 March.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 595‚Äì596 As Oite was approaching Truk the following morning, the destroyer was sunk by Grumman TBF Avengers of Task Force 58 in the course of Operation Hailstone, and sank within minutes, taking all but twenty of her own crew down with her. All of the Agano crewmembers originally rescued were lost.

History and functions The office of the logothetƒìs tou dromou is explicitly attested for the first time in circa 762, but traces its origins to the officials supervising the Public Post in Late Antiquity. Until the late 4th century, the administration of the Roman Empire's Public Post was a responsibility of the praetorian prefectures. Due to the abuse of the Post and its privileges by the officials of the praetorian prefecture, in the late 4th century the oversight over the Post passed to the magister officiorum, while the day-to-day administration remained in the hands of the praetorian prefecture. As a result, an official known as the curiosus cursus publici, the inspector of the Public Post, is attested in the late 4th-century Notitia Dignitatum (Pars Orientalis, XI.50) as one of the principal aides of the magister officiorum. The twin administration of the Public Post by the praetorian prefects and the magister officiorum continued into the 6th century, and it was not until ca. 680 that the Public Post is found fully under the supervision of the magister officiorum. The office of the logothetƒìs tou dromou does not appear in the surviving sources until the year 762, but must have come into existence earlier, as the once-wide ranging duties of the magister officiorum were gradually removed and the office itself practically abolished during the course of the 8th century. Among the various functions of the magister officiorum, the logothetƒìs tou dromou assumed control not only the Public Post, but also of domestic security and the Empire's foreign affairs, handling collection of intelligence on foreign peoples, correspondence with foreign princes and the reception of ambassadors. Originally the office was simply one of the four senior fiscal ministers or logothetai, and the Klƒìtorologion of 899 places the logothetƒìs tou dromou 35th in the imperial hierarchy, after the logothetƒìs tou genikou (33rd) and the logothetƒìs to≈´ strati≈çtikou (34th), but above the logothetƒìs t≈çn agel≈çn (40th). It rose quickly in importance, however, and came to combine, according to the French scholar Rodolphe Guilland, the functions of a modern Interior, Security and Foreign Minister, although his role in foreign affairs remained by far the most important. It is indicative of his pre-eminence that in the Byzantine sources of the 9th‚Äì10th centuries, when there is mention of \\"the logothetƒìs\\" without further qualification, it usually refers to the logothetƒìs tou dromou. Consequently, the incumbent of the office often served as the Empire's chief minister, although this ultimately depended on the reigning emperor. The Byzantines never formalized such a position, nor was it attached to a particular office, rather it was granted ad hoc on the basis of each emperor's favour towards a particular courtier, irrespective of rank or office. As Guilland points out, the senior officials of the imperial household‚Äîthe praipositoi, parakoim≈çmenoi and pr≈çtovestiarioi‚Äìhad far more opportunity to attract imperial favour and consequently were more often chosen to fill the role of chief minister. Notable logothetai tou dromou who served as chief ministers include Staurakios under Empress Irene of Athens (), Theoktistos during the regency of Empress Theodora (842‚Äì856), Stylianos Zaoutzes in the early reign of Leo VI the Wise (), Leo Phokas the Younger during the rule of his brother Nikephoros II Phokas (), John under Constantine IX Monomachos (), and Nikephoritzes under Michael VII Doukas (). The 10th-century De Ceremoniis of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus () depicts the administrative and ceremonial roles of the logothetƒìs tou dromou: he was received in audience every morning by the Emperor in the Chrysotriklinos, he presented the senior officials at award- giving ceremonies, and had a prominent part in the reception of foreign embassies, as well as the exhibition of captives. After the reforms of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (), in circa 1108 the dromos ceased to exist as a department, but the logothetƒìs remained, now responsible for official communications and for supervising foreigners resident in Constantinople. At the same time, the logothetƒìs tou dromou lost his pre-eminence among the senior ministers to the logothetƒìs t≈çn sekret≈çn, a post which later evolved to the megas logothetƒìs.

The oikeiakoi (from , \\"belonging to the household\\") were a class of senior imperial household officials attested in the 9th and 10th centuries. The position of a head of this class (epi t≈çn oikeiak≈çn means \\"in charge of the oikeiakoi\\") appeared possibly in the 10th century, based on sigillographic evidence, or at any rate before circa 1030. His exact functions are unclear: Rodolphe Guilland considered him the successor of the epi tou eidikou as the head of the imperial private treasury, while Nicolas Oikonomides thought that he administered the Byzantine emperor's private domains. The post was often combined with other positions, and fulfilled a range of judicial and fiscal duties. In the Palaiologan period, it became the logothetƒìs t≈çn oikeiak≈çn, who exercised mainly diplomatic and judicial duties. According to the Book of Offices of pseudo-Kodinos, compiled around the middle of the 14th century, the logothetƒìs t≈çn oikeiak≈çn occupied the 39th place in the imperial hierarchy, between the prait≈çr tou dƒìmou and the megas logariastƒìs, but held no official function. His court uniform consisted of a turban (phake≈çlis) and an overcoat called epilourikon.

History and functions Seal of the proedros and genikos logothetƒìs Basil Xeros (11th/12th centuries) The genikon was responsible for general taxation and revenue, and also served as a court for financial cases. As such, it broadly fulfilled the tasks of the earlier sacrae largitiones, although it was mostly derived from the \\"general department\\" of the praetorian prefecture. The first attested logothetƒìs tou genikou, the monk Theodotos, is mentioned in 692, but the post may have been instituted as early as 626. The bureau of the genikon and its logothete remained one of the chief ministries for the entire middle Byzantine period (7th‚Äì12th centuries). During the Komnenian period, its importance declined, but recovered under the Angeloi. Following the sack of Constantinople in 1204 and the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire, the office of the logothetƒìs tou genikou was retained as a purely honorary title by the successor state of Nicaea and the restored Palaiologan Empire after 1261. The mid-14th century writer Pseudo-Kodinos records him in the 20th place in the imperial hierarchy, between the parakoim≈çmenos of the imperial bedchamber and the pr≈çtovestiaritƒìs. His distinctive court dress and insignia during this time were a brimmed hat called skiadion of white silk, a silk long kaftan-like kabbadion, and for ceremonies and festivities, a domed skaranikon hat of white and gold silk, with gold-wire embroidery and decorated with images of the emperor in the front and back. Unlike other officials, he bore no staff of office (dikanikion). Amongst the Palaiologan-era holders were significant intellectuals and statesmen, such as George Akropolites and Theodore Metochites. The last recorded logothetƒìs tou genikou was a certain John Androuses in 1380. By that time, however, its original functions had long been forgotten; as the Pseudo-Kodinos records, \\"the function of the General Logothete is unknown\\". Subordinate officials The subordinates of the logothetƒìs tou genikou were: *The chartoularioi megaloi tou sekretou (, \\"great chartularies of the department\\"), the heads of the various departments. *The chartoularioi t≈çn arkl≈çn (, where means \\"[money] box\\", i.e. \\"treasury\\") or ex≈ç chartoularioi (, \\"outer chartularies\\"). As their name signifies, they were the senior treasury officials posted in the provinces (\\"outer\\", i.e. outside Constantinople). *The epoptai of the themata (), who were the officials charged with control of taxation in the provinces. *The komƒìtes hydat≈çn ( , \\"counts of the waters\\"), officials probably in charge of aqueducts and water supply in the provinces. *The chartoularios tou oikistikou () or simply ho oikistikos, whose precise functions are unknown. It is attested that he was in charge of tax exemptions, and had various juridical duties in some themata in the 11th century; the office may have been associated with the imperial domains (oikoi). By the 11th century, the office had become an independent bureau, but vanishes after that. *The kommerkiarioi (), who were customs officials. Attested since the early 6th century, they are likely the successors of the comes commerciorum mentioned in the Notitia Dignitatum. Initially stationed at the frontier, after the 7th century they were placed at ports or in charge over entire themata or islands. *The epi tƒìs kourat≈çrias of the basilikoi oikoi (, \\"in charge of the curatorship [of the imperial domains]\\"), who supervised the imperial estates. *The komƒìs tƒìs lamias (), an official probably in charge of the mines and gold bullion (cf. , \\"gold, precious metals\\"). It is therefore usually assumed that he is the successor of the old comes metallorum per Illyricum. From sigillographic evidence through the 11th century, this office was sometimes combined with the positions of epi t≈çn oikeiak≈çn (\\"in charge of the oikeiakoi\\", a class of senior courtiers) and of one of the chartoularioi megaloi of the genikon. *The dioikƒìtai (), officials who supervised the collection of taxes, assisted by a number of praktores (\\"agents\\"). *The kom[v]entianos (Œ∫ŒøŒº[Œ≤]ŒµŒΩœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ), an official of unknown function. *A number of kankellarioi (Œ∫Œ±Œ≥Œ∫ŒµŒªŒªŒ¨œÅŒπŒøŒπ, from ) under a pr≈çtokankellarios. Originally senior officials in the praetorian prefecture, in the middle Byzantine period they were mid-level secretaries in the various ministries.

From 2002 to 2010, he served as Chief of Staff of the Afghan National Army and from 2010 to 2012 he held the post of Interior Minister of Afghanistan. He has an anti-Taliban background and once served as a senior commander under Ahmad Shah Massoud. Early years and career Bismillah Khan Mohammadi was born in 1961 in the Panjshir Province of Afghanistan. An ethnic Tajik, he is the son of Ghausuddin of the Panjshir Valley. After graduating from 14th grade in Abu Hanifa Seminary he enrolled at Kabul Military University. Mohammadi was a former PDPA Parcham member, but after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan he aligned himself with mujahideen resistance commander Ahmad Shah Massoud. When the Taliban gained control over large parts of Afghanistan in 1996 establishing their Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, Bismillah Khan served as Deputy Minister of Defense of the anti-Taliban and still recognized Islamic State of Afghanistan. He was a senior commander in the anti-Taliban resistance, the United Front (Northern Alliance), led by Ahmad Shah Massoud. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent fall of the Taliban regime through United Front ground troops and the U.S. Air Force, Bismillah Khan was appointed commander of Kabul's police force and became a member of the Kabul Security Commission. During that period the security situation in Kabul was better than in other parts of Afghanistan.Moyar, Mark. Orbis Operations ‚Äì Research Report: Afghanistan‚Äôs New Minister of Interior: A Potential Game Changer. 16 July 2010. Chief of Staff of the Afghan National Army In 2002, Bismillah Khan became Chief of Staff of the Afghan National Army, a post he held until 2010.Davis, Anthony. Interview: General Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, Chief of General Staff, Afghan National Army. Jane's Defence News. 18 January 2008. Interior Minister Kunar province In June 2010, Bismillah Khan was transferred from his position as Army Chief of Staff to the post of Interior Minister by President Hamid Karzai. As Interior Minister, Mohammadi has loudly deplored ethnic fractiousness within the Afghan security forces, and has called on Afghanistan's ethnic groups to come together in the interest of the country and Islam. By stressing national unity and Islamic ethics in the Afghan National Police, he may be able to get officers of different identities to work together, discourage them from pilfering supplies, and convince them to prevent their men from robbing and beating civilians, as he was at times able to do in the Afghan National Army. Mohammadi is committed to base police leadership appointments upon merit. The challenging tasks to prevent politics, ethnicity, tribalism, cronyism, and nepotism from influencing appointments will take perseverance and patience by Mohammadi. When Mohammadi was the army chief of staff, he was able to achieve substantial improvements in the army‚Äôs capabilities by championing meritocracy. With the police, he will need to redouble his efforts, for Karzai and other political figures have intruded into appointments more often with the police than the army. Mohammadi‚Äôs ties to the army also make him uniquely qualified to increase cooperation between the police and the army in the field. Such cooperation is essential, above all because most police units are not adequately prepared to deal with sizable groups of armed insurgents on their own. U.S. General David Petraeus with Bismillah Khan in July 2010 One advantage for appointing Mohammadi as the Minister of Interior is the hope of mending the rifts within the Afghan National Army that opened or widened as a result of the U.S. government‚Äôs plan to begin withdrawing forces in July 2011. Expecting the eruption of a civil war after the American withdrawal, officers have been gravitating towards ethnic groupings and powerful generals, with Mohammadi and the Pashtu Defense Minister Wardak at the head of the two largest cliques. The departure of Mohammadi from the Ministry of Defense leaves no one who can rival Wardak in stature, which could mean a weakening of centrifugal forces. One of Mohammadi's strategies is to push greater authority down to local police commanders. When Mohammadi was the Chief of Staff of the Afghan National Army, he enforced the decentralization process within an institution heavily influenced by senior officers who had been trained in the centralized model. A decentralized command requires a wide range to regulate due to the fact that some commanders lack the abilities and must be identified for help or removal. Upper-echelon commanders must get out of their headquarters and visit the field commanders, a practice alien to some senior Afghan officers. Fortunately, Mohammadi as well known for circulating the battlefield as an army commander, and has already implemented his regular process of making unannounced inspection trips to police stations at all hours of the day and night. Mohammadi undoubtedly will expect other senior commanders to do the same. As the Minister of the Interior, Mohammadi stressed the need to curb the corruption that has corroded the government and the people‚Äôs trust in it. Mohammadi has already begun taking some of the actions essential to the reduction of corruption. He is, for example, keeping tabs on the movements of Ministry of Interior officials, and has fired several police chiefs for corruption.  Awards  Bismillah Khan Mohammadi has received the Sayed Jamaluddin Afghani, Ghazi Amanullah Khan and Ahmad Shah Baba awards for his efforts in bolstering the Afghan National Army.Mohammadi, Gen.

Beginning in a small lake southeast of Egegik, it meanders southwest across the flats to enter Ugashik Bay southeast of Smoky Point. The name derives from the numerous Sicilian fishermen who would anchor in the protected waters during closed fishing periods and collectively celebrate their heritage with plenty of food and wine. At first used in a pejorative way, the Sicilians embraced the terminology and the name stuck, becoming official when the area was first definitively mapped in 1943. The area is still used as a small boat harbor for the nearby village of Pilot Point, especially with the completion of a bulkhead-style dock and boat launch in 1990. Although a few fish swim up, and reportedly spawn in, its waters, the stream is primarily a drain for the multitude of small lakes, marshland and tundra of the coastal zone north of Ugashik Bay. The creek generally flows from north to south, beginning with the drainage from Dago Lake, a large but shallow freshwater lake located approximately 25 miles (40 km) north of the creek's mouth. It then begins a slow and meandering path towards the sea, with several oxbow lakes and false channels along the way. Though relatively narrow, the entire length of the stream has been navigated by vessels from the Bristol Bay fishing fleet. The creek also serves to break the contiguous land mass of the north/east shore of Ugashik Bay, separating the village of Pilot Point from the neighboring community of Smoky Point. It also serves as a point of subsistence salmon fishing, although its waters are officially closed to commercial fishing activity. Local Alaska Natives also catch abundant supplies of small, oily, herring-like fish called smelt which helps supplement the local diet.

Reith stated that impartiality and objectivity were the essence of professionalism in broadcasting. Allegations that the corporation lacks impartial and objective journalism are regularly made by observers on both the left and the right of the political spectrum. Another key area of criticism is the mandatory licence fee, as commercial competitors argue that means of financing to be unfair and to result in limiting their ability to compete with the BBC. Also, accusations of waste or over-staffing occasionally prompt comments from politicians and the other media.  20th century  = Thatcher government = Accusations of a left-wing bias were often made against the Corporation by members of Margaret Thatcher's 1980s Conservative government. Norman Tebbit called the BBC the \\"Stateless Person's Broadcasting Corporation\\" because of what he regarded as its unpatriotic coverage of the Falklands War, and Conservative MP Peter Bruinvels called it the \\"Bolshevik Broadcasting Corporation\\". Steve Barnett wrote in The Observer in 2001 that in 1983, Stuart Young, the \\"accountant and brother of one of Thatcher's staunchest cabinet allies\\", David Young, was appointed as BBC chairman. After him, in 1986, came Marmaduke Hussey, a \\"brother-in-law of another Cabinet Minister.... According to the then-Tory party chairman, Norman Tebbit, Hussey was appointed 'to get in there and sort the place out'\\". Controversies continued with the likes of the Nationwide general election special with Thatcher in 1983, a Panorama documentary called Maggie's Militant Tendency, the Real Lives interview with Martin McGuinness, the BBC's coverage of the US 1986 Bombing of Libya and the Zircon affair. In 1987, the Director-General of the BBC, Alasdair Milne, was forced to resign. Thatcher later said: \\"I have fought three elections against the BBC and don't want to fight another against it\\". In 2006, Tebbit said: \\"The BBC was always against Lady Thatcher\\". Mark Thompson, the Director General of the BBC, said in 2010, \\"In the BBC I joined 30 years ago [as a production trainee, in 1979], there was, in much of current affairs, in terms of people's personal politics, which were quite vocal, a massive bias to the left. The organisation did struggle then with impartiality\\".  21st century  BBC News forms a major department of the Corporation, and receives many complaints of bias. The Centre for Policy Studies stated, \\"Since at least the mid-1980s, the Corporation has often been criticised for a perceived bias against those on the centre-right of politics\\". Similar allegations have been made by past and present employees such as Antony Jay, North American editor Justin Webb, former editor of the Today programme Rod Liddle, former correspondent Robin Aitken and Peter Sissons, a former news presenter. The former political editor Andrew Marr argued in 2006 that the liberal bias of the BBC is the product of the types of people that it employs and so is cultural, not political. In 2011, Peter Oborne wrote in his Daily Telegraph blog, \\"Rather than representing the nation as a whole, it [the BBC] has become a vital resource ‚Äì and sometimes attack weapon ‚Äì for a narrow, arrogant Left- Liberal elite\\". Speaking to journalists at a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch in 2009, Jeremy Hunt, the Shadow Cabinet Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, claimed that BBC News needed more people from the centre-right: \\"I wish they would go and actively look for some Conservatives to be part of their news-gathering team, because they have acknowledged that one of their problems is that people who want to work at the Corporation tend to be from the centre-left. That's why they have this issue with what Andrew Marr called an innate liberal bias\\". Other commentators have taken the opposite view and criticised the BBC for being part of the establishment. The commentator Mehdi Hasan pointed out in the New Statesman the right-wing backgrounds of many BBC presenters and journalists and queried why even many \\"liberals and leftists\\" accept the right's description of BBC bias. The Guardian columnist Owen Jones also believes that the BBC is biased towards the right since numerous key posts being filled by Conservatives. A study by Cardiff University academics, which was funded by the BBC Trust, was published in August 2013 and examined the BBC's coverage of a broad range of issues. One of the findings was the dominance of party political sources; in coverage of immigration, the EU and religion, they accounted for 49.4% of all source appearances in 2007 and 54.8% in 2012. The data also showed that the Conservative Party received significantly more airtime than the Labour Party. In 2012, Conservative leader and then Prime Minister David Cameron outnumbered Labour leader Ed Miliband in appearances by a factor of nearly four to one (53 to 15), and governing Conservative cabinet members and ministers outnumbered their Labour counterparts by more than four to one (67 to 15). A former Director General of the BBC, Greg Dyke, criticised the BBC as part of a \\"Westminster conspiracy\\" to maintain the British political system. Before to the 2019 general election, the BBC was accused by some Labour politicians and pundits of coverage that favoured the ruling Conservative Party. For instance, they took issue with a clip used from a BBC Question Time leader's special episode in which the part showing audience laughter at Prime Minister Boris Johnson's response to a certain question was edited out. BBC officials addressed the issue and admitted their mistake. Furthermore, the BBC was accused of subjecting Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson to a gruelling interview by Andrew Neil but not requiring Johnson to go through the same and of arranging it beforehand. The Guardian columnist Owen Jones also took issue with the BBC rescinding its policy of not letting Johnson be interviewed by Marr unless he went through one with Neil. The BBC defended its decision to waive the requirement by citing national interest amidst a terror attack in London on 29 November 2019. = Racism = The BBC has also been accused of racism. In a speech to the Royal Television Society in 2008, Lenny Henry said that ethnic minorities were \\"pitifully underserved\\" in television comedy and that little had changed at senior levels in terms of ethnic representation during his 32 years in television. Jimmy McGovern, in a 2007 interview, called the BBC \\"one of the most racist institutions in England\\". In 2001, BBC Director-General Greg Dyke said that the BBC was \\"hideously white\\" and acknowledged difficulties with \\"race relations\\". He acknowledged that it was having difficulties in retaining minority staff and outlined plans towards solving those problems. Rageh Omaar, the Somali-born British journalist and former BBC war correspondent who reported the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, called BBC a \\"white man's club\\" after he resigned to join Al-Jazeera in 2006. Later, in 2007, while being interviewed by Hannah Pool of The Guardian, he accused the BBC of classism too. The BBC, which is legally obliged to be an equal opportunities employer, had a 2012 target for 12.5% of its staff to be from a black or minority ethnic background (12% at 31 January 2009). The BBC's buildings are largely based in urban areas with a more diverse demography than the country as a whole (30% ethnic minority population in London and about 15% in the Manchester/Salford area), and the 12.5% figure is over 4% higher than the current percentage of ethnic minorities in the United Kingdom as a whole. However, many of its ethnic minority members of staff have been argued to be cleaners and security guards, not presenters and programme makers. The Guardian reported:l, \\"The BBC has pledged to increase the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people on air by more than 40% over the next three years and almost double the number of senior managers from those groups who work at the corporation by 2020\\". Indarjit Singh, the chief of Britain's Network of Sikh Organisations, criticised the BBC Asian Network, a radio station intended for an audience of South Asian origin: \\"Stations like BBC Asian Network do little to encourage integration and social cohesion because they allow communities to ghettoise themselves\\". In September 2019, the BBC's Editorial Complaints Unit upheld a complaint that television presenter Naga Munchetty breached their editorial guidelines in her criticism of racist comments made by US President Donald Trump about four US representatives. That decision was criticised by the BBC's black and ethnic minority (BAME) network, and 44 British actors, broadcasters and journalists of BAME origin wrote a letter to ask for the BBC to reconsider its decision. Ofcom initiated a parallel assessment of the decision. Her fellow cohost, Dan Walker, was also named in the initial complaint, but no action was taken by the BBC against him since the complainant's follow-up complaint focused solely on Munchetty. In response, Tony Hall, the Director- General of the BBC, intervened and reversed the decision to uphold the complaint on 30 September. In July 2020, a BBC reporter used the N-word in a report on the attack of a 21-year-old NHS worker and musician known as K-Dogg. This led to complaints to the BBC about why it didn't bleep that word out or said \\"the N-word\\". It also led to questions about why a white person was even allowed to say that word. The N-word was used in the attack.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/31/bbc-receives-complaints- white-reporter-uses-n-word-air/ A few days later, the BBC also received criticism after airing the offensive language used by historian Lucy Worsley when quoting former American president Abraham Lincoln, on her documentary American History's Biggest Fibs which aired on BBC Two on 1 August 2020. The documentary first aired on BBC Four in 2019.https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/bbc-n-word-lucy- worsley-biggest-fibs-a9650251.html The BBC has defended the use of the N-word in response on 4 August 2020 saying it wanted to report the word allegedly used in the attack of K-Dogg, and this decision was supported by the family of the victim, but the corporation accepted that it did cause offence.https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/complaint/pointswestbbcnewschannel0720 On 8 August, Sideman, real name David Whitely, has decided to leave BBC Radio 1Xtra because of the use of the racial slur and the defense of it.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53708991 The next day, 9 August, the BBC apologised over the use of the N-word and said a mistake was made. Its director general Tony Hall said he now accepts the corporation should've taken a different approach.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53715814 = Homophobia = The Independent reported the findings of a University of Leeds study in March 2006, which accused the BBC of being \\"institutionally homophobic\\" towards \\"lesbian and gays, references to them, or related issues\\". The Leeds researchers found that out of 168 hours of programming, only 38 minutes (0.4%) dealt with gay and lesbian issues, and that 32 minutes (80%) was deemed negative. Focus groups used in the study accused the BBC of being the worst broadcaster in terms of gay and lesbian issues and their portrayal of the LGBT community. In 2015, the BBC was criticised for shortlisting boxer Tyson Fury for Sports Personality of the Year, despite the controversial remarks that he had made on homosexuality, women and abortion. A BBC Northern Ireland journalist, Andy West, resigned from the BBC after he was suspended for publicly criticising the decision. = Safeguarding Impartiality in the 21st Century = A report commissioned by the BBC Trust, Safeguarding Impartiality in the 21st Century, published in June 2007, stressed that the BBC needed to take more care in being impartial. It said the BBC had broken its own guidelines by screening an episode of The Vicar of Dibley that promoted the Make Poverty History campaign. The bias was explained as the result of the BBC's liberal culture. A transcript of the impartiality seminar is included as a separately published appendix to the report available via the BBC Trust. After press reports emerged that BBC employees had edited the Wikipedia article's coverage of the report, the BBC issued new guidelines banning BBC staff from \\"sanitising\\" Wikipedia articles about the BBC. = Immigration and European Union = In 2005, two independent reports deemed the BBC's coverage of the European Union to be rather inadequate and one of the reports noted a \\"cultural and unintentional bias\\". In July 2013, a report commissioned by the BBC Trust found that the organisation had been slow to reflect widespread public concerns about immigration to the United Kingdom and shifts in public attitudes towards the European Union. The report, by Stuart Prebble, stated that Helen Boaden, the former director of BBC News, had said that when she arrived at the organisation, there had been a \\"deep liberal bias\\" in the handling of immigration issues. It also stated that, within the BBC, \\"the agenda of debate is probably too driven by the views of politicians\\" but that \\"overall the breadth of opinion reflected by the BBC on this subject is broad and impressive, and no persuasive evidence was found that significant areas of opinion are not given due weight today\\". It also stated that the BBC was \\"slow to give appropriate prominence to the growing weight of opinion opposing UK membership of the EU, but in more recent times has achieved a better balance\\". In contrast, in 2018, former BBC (now ITV) journalist Robert Peston accused the organisation of not being \\"confident enough\\" in pointing out false arguments during the campaign and of giving a false balance of impartiality. Peston said that the organisation \\"put people on with diametrically opposed views and didn't give their viewers and listeners any help in assessing which one was the loony and which one was the genius.... Impartial journalism is not giving equal airtime to two people one of whom says the world is flat and the other one says the world is round\\". = Political correctness = Speaking at the China Exchange in Soho, the former BBC employee Jeremy Clarkson recalled when he was accused of being racist by the corporation: \\"Political correctness is tiresome. We really suffered from it terribly at the Beeb.... I remember being called in to see Danny Cohen... he said, 'I understand you have a new dog and you have called it Didier Dogba. It is racist'\\". In an interview with the Radio Times, Clarkson said, \\"It's become so up itself, suffocating the life out of everything with its nonsense need to be politically correct\\". In October 2019, Indarjit Singh left Thought for the Day on BBC Radio 4 and accused the BBC of \\"a misplaced sense of political correctness\\". An item commemorating a guru of the Sikh faith who had been executed for opposing the forced conversion of Hindus to Islam in India in the 17th century had been prevented from being broadcast by the BBC \\"because it might offend Muslims\\" although it contained no criticism of Islam. Specific allegations =Anti- Hindu bias and Indophobia= In The Hindu Business Line, the reporter Premen Addy criticised the BBC's reportage on South Asia as consistently anti-India and pro-Islamist, underreporting India's economic and social achievements and political and diplomatic efforts and disproportionately highlighting and exaggerating problems in the country. In addition, Addy alluded to discrimination against Indian anchors and reporters in favour of Muslim Pakistanis and Bangladeshis who are hostile to India. The journalist Christopher Booker also criticised the BBC for its coverage of India-related matters. He concludes that the BBC's efforts to reinforce stereotypes of South Asians has been directly responsible for damaging the image of India and encouraging racist incidents against Indians, such as the Leipzig University internship controversy. Writing for the 2008 edition of the peer-reviewed Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, Alasdair Pinkerton analysed the coverage of India by the BBC from India's 1947 independence from British rule to 2008. Pinkerton observed a tumultuous history involving allegations of anti-India bias in the BBC's reportage, particularly during the Cold War, and concluded that the BBC's coverage of South Asian geopolitics and economics showed a pervasive and hostile anti-India bias because of the BBC's alleged imperialist and neocolonialist stance. In 2008, the BBC was criticised for referring to the men who carried out the November 2008 Mumbai attacks as \\"gunmen\\", rather than \\"terrorists,\\" used to describe the attacks in UK. That follows a steady stream of complaints from India that the BBC has an Indophobic bias that stems from a culturally-ingrained racism against Indians arising from the British Raj. Rediff reporter Arindam Banerji has chronicled what he argues are numerous cases of Indophobic bias from the BBC regarding reportage, selection bias, misrepresentation and fabrications. In protest against the use of the word \\"gunmen\\" by the BBC, the journalist Mobashar Jawed \\"M.J.\\" Akbar refused to take part in an interview after the Mumbai attacks and criticised the BBC's reportage of the incident. The British parliamentarian Stephen Pound has supported the claims by referring to the BBC's whitewashing of the terror attacks as \\"the worst sort of mealy mouthed posturing. It is desperation to avoid causing offence which ultimately causes more offence to everyone\\".  Indian Army  The BBC has also been criticised for covering conflicts in South Asia with an anti-India bias. For instance, it made false allegations that the Indian Army stormed a sacred Muslim shrine, the tomb of Hazrat Sheikh Noor-u-din Noorani in Charari Sharief and retracted the claim only after strong criticism.  Pakistani propaganda against India  A report from the BBC accused India of sponsoring Pakistan's Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a domestic party based from Karachi, to fund anti-Pakistani activities. However, the only source mentioned in the report was an \\"authoritative Pakistani source\\", rather than independent investigation. The flawed reporting was severely criticised by India and other prominent journalists like Barkha Dutt. The report was extensively circulated in Pakistani domestic media to fuel propaganda and conspiracy theories.  Anti-Hindu bias in UK  Hindu groups in the United Kingdom have accused the BBC of anti-Hindu bigotry and whitewashing Islamist hate groups that demonise the British Indian minority. In March 2012, the BBC referred to the Hindu festival of Holi as a \\"filthy festival\\". The Webster New World Dictionary defines \\"filthy\\" as \\"full of filth, disgustingly foul; grossly obscene; morally vicious or corrupt\\". The BBC apologised for the offence caused. In December 2019, BBC published a story that claimed that \\"ghost studies\\" were being taught at the Banaras Hindu University. The British Hindu Press Association subsequently pointed out that Bhoot Vidya is a Sanskrit word for psychotherapy, not \\"ghost Studies\\", and added that this was a \\"deliberate attempt to mock and denigrate\\" Hinduism.  Anti-Sikh bias  In 2009, the BBC Asian Network angered Sikhs for a show in which Muslim presenter Adil Ray expressed that Sikhs should not always carry their kirpan, a ceremonial dagger and key item of their faith. The BBC rejected the charge but deleted the show from its website. = Criticism of BBC reporting on Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict = Criticism of the BBC's Middle East coverage, especially related to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, from supporters of both Israel and the Palestinians led the BBC to commission an investigation and report from a senior broadcast journalist and senior editorial advisor Malcolm Balen that was referred to as the Balen Report and completed in 2004. The BBC's refusal to release the report under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 resulted in a long-running and ongoing legal case.Lords rule Balen report was wrongly blocked under FoI Press Gazette 11 February 2009Timeline: The battle to make BBC publish Middle East coverage report The Guardian 11 February 2009 The BBC eventually overturned a ruling by the Information Tribunal that rejected the BBC's refusal to release the Balen report to Steven Sugar, a member of the public, under the Freedom of Information Act on the grounds that it was held for the purposes of journalism. The report examines BBC radio and television broadcasts covering the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. On 10 October 2006, The Daily Telegraph claimed, \\"The BBC has spent thousands of pounds of licence payers' money trying to block the release of a report which is believed to be highly critical of its Middle East coverage. The corporation is mounting a landmark High Court action to prevent the release of The Balen Report under the Freedom of Information Act, despite the fact that BBC reporters often use the Act to pursue their journalism. The action will increase suspicions that the report, which is believed to run to 20,000 words, includes evidence of anti-Israeli bias in news programming\\". The Times reported in March 2007 that \\"critics of the BBC\\" were interested in knowing if the Balen Report \\"includes evidence of bias against Israel in news programming\\". After the 2004 report, the BBC appointed a committee chosen by the Governors and referred to by the BBC as an \\"independent panel report\\" to write a report for publication, which was completed in 2006. Chaired by the British Board of Film Classification president, Sir Quentin Thomas, the committee found that \\"apart from individual lapses, there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias\\" in the BBC's reporting of the Middle East. However, its coverage had been \\"inconsistent\\", \\"not always providing a complete picture\\" and \\"misleading\\", and the BBC had failed to report adequately the hardships of Palestinians living under the occupation. Reflecting concerns from all sides of the conflict, the committee highlighted certain identifiable shortcomings and made four recommendations, including the provision of a stronger editorial \\"guiding hand\\". Of the report's findings regarding the dearth of BBC reporting of the difficulties faced by the Palestinians, Richard Ingrams wrote in The Independent, \\"No sensible person could quarrel with that judgement\\". Martin Walker, then the editor of United Press International, agreed that the report implied favouritism towards Israel but said that the suggestion \\"produced mocking guffaws in my newsroom\\" and went on to list a number of episodes of what he thought was the BBC's clear pro-Palestinian bias. Writing in Prospect magazine, the Conservative MP Michael Gove wrote that the report was neither independent nor objective.Gove, Michael (25 June 2006) Bias at the Beeb Prospect, June 2006 A former BBC Middle East correspondent, Tim Llewellyn, wrote in 2004 that the BBC's coverage allowed Israel's view of the conflict to dominate, as was demonstrated by research conducted by the Glasgow Media Group. Douglas Davis, the London correspondent of The Jerusalem Post, has accused the BBC of being anti-Israel. He wrote that the BBC's coverage of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict was a \\"portrayal of Israel as a demonic, criminal state and Israelis as brutal oppressors\\" and resembled a \\"campaign of vilification\\" that had delegitimised the State of Israel.Davis, Douglas. \\"Hatred in the air: the BBC, Israel and Anti-Semitism\\". in: Iganski, Paul & Kosmin, Barry. (eds) A New Anti-Semitism? Debating Judeophobia in 21st century Britain. Profile Books, 2003, p. 130. \\"Anglicans for Israel\\", the pro-Israel pressure group, berated the BBC for apparent anti-Israel bias. The Daily Telegraph has criticised the BBC for its coverage of the Middle East; in 2007, it wrote, \\"In its international and domestic news reporting, the corporation has consistently come across as na√Øve and partial, rather than sensitive and unbiased. Its reporting of Israel and Palestine, in particular, tends to underplay the hate-filled Islamist ideology that inspires Hamas and other factions, while never giving Israel the benefit of the doubt\\".Terror victims are BBC licence-payers, too 20 August 2007 In April 2004, Natan Sharansky, Israel's Minister for Diaspora Affairs, wrote to the BBC to accuse its Middle East correspondent, Orla Guerin, as having a \\"deep-seated bias against Israel\\" after her description of the Israeli army's handling of the arrest of Hussam Abdo, who was captured with explosives strapped to his chest, as \\"cynical manipulation of a Palestinian youngster for propaganda purposes\\". In March 2006, a report on the Arab-Israeli conflict on the BBC's online service was criticised in a BBC Governors Report as unbalanced and creating a biased impression. The article's account of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 in 1967 concerning the Six-Day War between Israel and a coalition of Egypt, Jordan and Syria \\"suggested the UN called for Israel's unilateral withdrawal from territories seized during the six-day war, when in fact, it called for a negotiated 'land for peace' settlement between Israel and 'every state in the area'. The committee considered that by selecting only references to Israel, the article had breached editorial standards on both accuracy and impartiality\\".\\"BBC Partially Revises Biased Timeline on Web site\\", CAMERA, 10 March 2006 During the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli diplomatic officials boycotted BBC news programmes, refused interviews and excluded reporters from briefings because Israeli officials believed the BBC's reporting was biased: \\"the reports we see give the impression that the BBC is working on behalf of Hezbollah instead of doing fair journalism\\". Fran Unsworth, the head of BBC News gathering, defended the coverage in an article for Jewish News.com. On 7 March 2008, the news anchor Geeta Guru-Murthy clarified significant errors in the BBC's coverage of the Mercaz HaRav massacre that had been exposed by media monitor Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America. The correspondent Nick Miles had informed viewers that \\"hours after the attack, Israeli bulldozers destroyed his [the perpetrator's] family home\\". Thar was not the case, and other broadcasters showed the east Jerusalem home to be intact and the family commemorating its son's actions. On 14 March 2008, the BBC accepted that in an article on its website of an IDF operation that stated, \\"The Israeli air force said it was targeting a rocket firing team.... UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has condemned Israel's attacks on Palestinian civilians, calling them inappropriate and disproportionate\\", it should have made reference to what Ban Ki-Moon said about Palestinian rocket attacks as well as to the excessive use of force by Israel. The article was also amended to remove the reference of Israeli 'attacks on civilians' as Ban's attributed comments were made weeks earlier to the UN Security Council and not in reference to that particular attack. In fact, he had never used such terminology. The BBC received intense criticism in January 2009 for its decision not to broadcast a television appeal by aid agencies on behalf of the people of Gaza during the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict,l on the grounds that it could compromise the BBC's journalistic impartiality. A number of protesters asserted that it showed pro- Israeli bias, and some analysts suggested that the BBC's decision in the matter derived from its concern to avoid anti-Israeli bias, as analysed in the Balen Report.The secret report at heart of BBC's Gaza paranoia Evening Standard 27 January 2009 Parties criticising the decision, included Church of England archbishops, British government ministers and even some BBC employees. More than 11,000 complaints were filed in a three-day span. The BBC's director general, Mark Thompson, explained that the BBC had a duty to cover the Gaza dispute in a \\"balanced, objective way\\" and was concerned about endorsing something that could \\"suggest the backing one side\\".\\"BBC Assailed for Refusing to Carry Gaza Appeal.\\" The New York Times, 26 January 2009. Retrieved 28 January 2009. Politicians such as Tony Benn broke the BBC's ban on the appeal and broadcast the Gaza appeal on BBC News: \\"If the BBC won't broadcast the appeal, then I'm going to do it myself\\". He added that \\"no one [working for the broadcaster] agrees with what the BBC has done\\". When Peter Oborne and James Jones investigated the BBC's refusal to screen the appeal, they said they found it \\"almost impossible to get anyone to come on the record\\". They were told by organisations Disasters Emergency Committee, Amnesty International, Oxfam, Christian Aid, Save the Children Fund and the Catholic agency CAFOD that the topic was \\"too sensitive\\". Mohamed El-Baradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, protested the BBC's decision by cancelling interviews scheduled with the company; El-Baradei claimed the refusal to air the aid appeal \\"violates the rules of basic human decency which are there to help vulnerable people irrespective of who is right or wrong\\". The BBC's chief operating officer, Caroline Thomson, affirmed the need to broadcast \\"without affecting and impinging on the audience's perception of our impartiality\\" and that in this case, it was a \\"real issue\\". In response to perceived falsehoods and distortions in a BBC One Panorama documentary, 'A Walk in the Park', transmitted in January 2010, the British journalist Melanie Phillips wrote an open letter in the news magazine The Spectator to the Secretary of State for Culture, Jeremy Hunt, to accusin the BBC of \\"flagrantly biased reporting of Israel\\" and to urge the BBC to confront the \\"prejudice and inertia which are combining to turn its reporting on Israel into crude pro- Arab propaganda, and thus risk destroying the integrity of an institution\\". In 2010, the BBC was accused of pro-Israel bias in its documentary about the Gaza flotilla raid. The BBC documentary concluded that Israeli forces had faced a violent premeditated attack by a group of hardcore activists, who intended to orchestrate a political act to put pressure on Israel. The programme was criticised as \\"biased\\" by critics of Israel, and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign questioned why the IDF boarded the ship at night if it had peaceful intentions. The eyewitness Ken O'Keefe accused the BBC of distorting the capture, medical treatment and ultimate release of three Israeli commandos into a story of heroic self-rescuing commandos. Anthony Lawson produced a 15-minute video detailing the BBC's alleged bias. In March 2011, the MPtl Louise Bagshawe criticised the inaccuracies and omissions in BBC's coverage of the Itamar massacre and questioned the BBC's decision not to broadcast tws incident on television and barely on radio and its apparent bias against Israel. In his July 2012 testimony to the Parliament, the outgoing Director- General of the BBC Mark Thompson admitted that BBC \\"got it wrong\\". A BBC Editorial Standards Findings issued in July 2011 found that a broadcast on Today on 27 September 2010 that stated, \\"At midnight last night, the moratorium on Israelis building new settlements in the West Bank came to an end. It had lasted for ten months\\" and had breached the accuracy guideline in respect of the requirement to present output \\"in clear, precise language\\", as in fact the moratorium on building new settlements had been in existence since the early 1990s and remained in place. In December 2011, the BBC caused further controversy after censoring the word \\"Palestine\\" from a song played on BBC Radio 1Xtra. More controversy was caused in April 2012 when the BBC broadcast news of 2,500 Palestinian prisoners who were on hunger strike, with very little overall coverage. This resulted in two protests outside the BBC buildings in Glasgow and in London. During the 2012 Summer Olympics's country profiles pages, the BBC listed \\"East Jerusalem\\" as the capital of Palestine and did not list a capital at all for Israel. Also, while all other country profile pages featured a representation the country's flag, the Israeli page featured a picture of an Israeli soldier confronting another man, supposedly a Palestinian. After public outrage and a letter from Israeli government spokesperson Mark Regev, the BBC listed a \\"Seat of Government\\" for Israel in Jerusalem but added that most foreign embassies \\"are in Tel Aviv\\". It made a parallel change to the listing for \\"Palestine\\" by listing \\"East Jerusalem\\" as the \\"Intended seat of government\\". The picture of the Israeli soldier was removed as well and replaced with the Israeli flag. In a response to a reader's criticism on the issue, the BBC replied that the complaints that prompted the changes were \\"generated by online lobby activity\\". The BBC was also noted for having no coverage about the campaign for the IOC to commemorate the 11 killed Israeli athletes from the Munich massacre in the 1972 Summer Olympics, which was met with repeated refusal by IOC President Jacques Rogge, despite the issue receiving much press by other major news networks. According to the poll conducted by Jewish Policy Research on more than 4,000 respondents, nearly 80% of British Jews believes that BBC is biased against Israel. Only 14% of British Jews believes that BBC coverage of Israel is \\"balanced\\". In 2013, the BBC scheduled to broadcast a documentary film, Jerusalem: an Archaeological Mystery Story, but pulled the film \\"off the schedule at the last minute.\\" The film \\"theorizes that many Jews did not leave Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple, and that many modern-day Palestinians may be in part descended from those Jews\\". Simon Plosker of HonestReporting believed that the decision was made to avoid offending people who are ideologically opposed to Israel by broadcasting a documentary about Jewish history in the region. The BBC's explanation for the sudden schedule change was that the film did not fit with the theme of the season, which was archaeology. In 2014, an op-ed in The Jerusalem Post by Raphael Cohen-Almagor criticised BBC for avoiding the word \\"terrorism\\" in connection with violent acts or groups of people considered by various governments or intergovernmental organisations to be terrorists. Cohen-Almagor wrote: \\"Instead of adhering to one principled definition of terrorism and then employing it across the board, the BBC prefers to sit on the fence, so as to say that it is impossible to differentiate between terrorists and 'freedom fighters', that one person's terrorist might be another's 'freedom fighter'\\". The same year, protesters presented an open letter from the Palestinian Solidarity Foundation , Stop the War Coalition, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and other groups to Lord Hall, Director General of the BBC. The letter accused the broadcaster of presenting Israeli attacks on Gaza as a result of rocket fire from Hamas without giving any other context. The letter was signed by notable individuals, such as Noam Chomsky, John Pilger and Ken Loach. In 2015, Fraser Steel, the head of the Editorial Complaints Unit of the BBC, upheld complaints that it had breached impartiality guidelines in an interview with Moshe Ya'alon, the Israeli defence minister.\\"BBC admits Israeli defense minister interview breached impartiality rules \\", RT International, 3 June 2015. Retrieved 22 January 2016. Ya'alon claimed on the Today programme that Palestinians \\"enjoy already political independence\\" and \\"have their own political system, government, parliament, municipalities and so forth\\" and that Israel had no desire \\"to govern them whatsoever\\". The Palestine Solidarity Campaign objected to these claims: \\"Palestinians don't have political independence. They live under occupation and, in Gaza, under siege\\". The filmmaker and activist Ken Loach sent a letter via the Campaign: \\"You understand, I'm sure, that this interview is a serious breach of the requirement for impartiality. Unlike all other Today interviews, the minister was allowed to speak without challenge. Why?\\" After the June 2017 Jerusalem attack, the BBC reported, \\"Three Palestinians killed after deadly stabbing in Jerusalem\\". However, those Palestinians had actually been the assailants in the attack, which ended when the three were shot and killed by law enforcement officers. After being inundated with complaints, BBC News changed the online headline. = Anti-American bias = In October 2006, the Chief Radio Correspondent for BBC News since 2001 and Washington, DC, correspondent Justin Webb said that the BBC is so biased against America that Deputy Director- General Mark Byford had secretly agreed to help him to \\"correct\\" it in his reports and that the BBC treated America with scorn and derision and gave it \\"no moral weight\\". In April 2007, Webb presented a three-part series for BBC Radio 4, Death to America: Anti Americanism Examined, in which he challenged a common perception of the United States as an international bully and a modern imperial power. The conservative American news commentator Bill O'Reilly repeatedly sought to draw attention to what he calls the BBC's \\"inherent liberal culture\\". = Anti-Catholic bias = Hostility towards Roman Catholic Church Prominent Roman Catholic leaders have criticised the BBC for having an anti-Catholic bias and showing hostility towards the Roman Catholic Church. The BBC has also been criticised for recycling old news and for \\"insensitivity\\" and bad timing when it decided to broadcast the programmes Kenyon Confronts and Sex and the Holy City around the same time as Pope John Paul II's 25th anniversary and the beatification of Mother Teresa. In 2003, the BBC had planned Popetown, a ten-part cartoon series which \\"featured an infantile Pope [...] bouncing around the Vatican on a pogostick\\". The plans were shelved after it evoked intense outrage and criticism from Roman Catholics.  Jerry Springer: The Opera  In January 2005, the BBC aired Jerry Springer: The Opera, ultimately resulting in around 55,000 complaints to the BBC from those upset at the opera's alleged blasphemies against Christianity. In advance of the broadcast, which the BBC had warned \\"contains language and content which won't be to some tastes\\", but mediawatch-uk's director, John Beyer, wrote to the Director General to urge the BBC to drop the programme: \\"Licence fee payers do not expect the BBC to be pushing back boundaries of taste and decency in this way\\". The BBC issued a statement: \\"As a public service broadcaster, it is the BBC's role to broadcast a range of programmes that will appeal to all audiences ‚Äì with very differing tastes and interests ‚Äì present in the UK today\\". Before the broadcast, some 150 people bearing placards had protested outside the BBC Television Centre in Shepherd's Bush. On the Monday after the broadcast, which was watched by some two million viewers, The Times announced that BBC executives had received death threats after their addresses and telephone numbers had been posted on the Christian Voice website. The BBC had received some 35,000 complaints before the broadcast but reported only 350 calls following the broadcast, which were split between those praising the production and those complaining about it. One Christian group attempted to bring private criminal prosecutions for blasphemy against the BBC, and another demanded a judicial review of the decision. In March 2005, the Board of Governors of the BBC convened and considered the complaints, which were rejected by 4 to 1. = Pro-Muslim bias =  Blaspheming other faiths but refusing to publish Muhammad cartoons  Subsequent to anti-christianity blasphemous reporting by BBC, its refusal to reproduce the actual Muhammad cartoons in its coverage of the controversy convinced many that the BBC follows an unstated policy of freely broadcasting defamation of Christianity but not Islam.  Disproportionate reporting on Muslims over other faiths  Hindu and Sikh leaders in the United Kingdom have accused the BBC of pandering to Britain's Muslim community by making a disproportionate number of programmes on Islam at the expense of covering other Asian religions, such as Sikhism and Hinduism. However, in a letter sent in July 2008 to the Network of Sikh Organisations (NSO), the head of the BBC's Religion and Ethics, Michael Wakelin, denied any bias. A spokesman for the BBC said that it was committed to representing all of Britain's faiths and communities. However, a number of MPs, including Rob Marris and Keith Vaz, called on the BBC to do more to represent Britain's minority faiths. \\"I am disappointed,\\" said Vaz. \\"It is only right that as licence fee payers all faiths are represented in a way that mirrors their make-up in society. I hope that the BBC addresses the problem in its next year of programming\\".  BBC reporter's tears for Yasser Arafat  During the BBC programme From Our Own Correspondent broadcast on 30 October 2004, Barbara Plett described herself as crying when she saw a frail Yasser Arafat being evacuated to France for medical treatment.Plett, Barbara (30 September 2004) \\"Yasser Arafat's unrelenting journey\\", BBC News, 30 October 2004. Retrieved 22 October 2006 That led to \\"hundreds of complaints\\" to the BBC, and suggestions that the BBC was biased. Andrew Dismore, the MP for Hendon, accused Plett of \\"sloppy journalism\\" and commented that \\"this shows the inherent bias of the BBC against Israel\\". BBC News defended Plett in a statement by saying that her reporting had met the high standards of \\"fairness, accuracy and balance\\" expected of a BBC correspondent.Gibson, Owen (26 November 2005). \\"BBC bias complaint upheld\\". The Guardian. Retrieved 22 October 2006.Gross, Tom (28 November 2005). BBC sanctions reporter who cried for Arafat (& \\"Hitler\\" running in Fatah primaries) Retrieved 30 December 2006. Initially, a complaint of bias against Plett was rejected by the BBC's head of editorial complaints. However, almost a year later, on 25 November 2005, the programme complaints committee of the BBC governors partially upheld the complaints by ruling that Plett's comments \\"breached the requirements of due impartiality\\". Despite initially issuing a statement in support of Plett, the BBC Director of News, Helen Boaden, later apologised for what she described as \\"an editorial misjudgment\\". The governors praised Boaden's speedy response and reviewed the BBC's stance on the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict.  Secret Agent biased documentary against British National Party  On 15 July 2004 the BBC broadcast a documentary on the far-right British National Party where undercover reporter Jason Gwynne infiltrated the BNP by posing as a football hooligan. The programme resulted in Mark Collett and Nick Griffin, the leader of the party, being charged for inciting racial hatred in April 2005 for statements that included Griffin describing Islam as a \\"wicked, vicious faith,\\" Collett describing asylum seekers as \\"a little bit like cockroaches\\" and saying \\"let's show these ethnics the door in 2004\\". Griffin and Collett were found not guilty on some charges at the first trial in January 2006, but the jury failed to reach a verdict on the others and so a retrial was ordered. At the retrial held in November 2006, all of the defendants were found not guilty on the basis that the law did not consider those who followed Islam or Christianity to be a protected group with respect to racial defamation laws. Shortly after this case, British law was amended to outlaw incitement to hatred against a religious group by the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006. The BNP believed that it was an attempt to \\"Discredit the British National Party as a party of opposition to the Labour government\\". After the second trial, Griffin described the BBC as a \\"Politically correct, politically biased organisation which has wasted licence-fee payers' money to bring two people in a legal, democratic, peaceful party to court over speaking nothing more than the truth\\". = Anti-Muslim bias =  Asian network  In 2008, staff at the BBC's Asian radio station complained of anti-Muslim discrimination by a *mafia of executives\\", which required the BBC to launch an internal investigation. Staff claimed that Hindus and Sikhs were being favoured over Muslim presenters and reporters. Disparity in coverage of Islamophobia One of Britain's largest Muslim representative bodies accused the BBC of \\"failing to sufficiently report\\" on Islamophobia within the ranks of the Conservative Party. The complaint was addressed to the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, in a letter by the Muslim Council of Britain. The MCB reminded Hall of the BBC's responsibility as a public broadcaster to be impartial and not to create a hierarchy of racism through its biased coverage: \\"Racism against Muslims should be given equal importance to racism against others\\". On 6 June 2018, the independent online media outlet Evolvepolitics released an article highlighting the disparity in BBC media coverage of anti-Semitism within UK Labour and that of Islamophobia within the Conservatives. The article demonstrated that the BBC website had about 50 times the amount of search results dedicated to anti-Semitism in the Labour Party as for Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. All outlets have given a far higher amount of coverage to Labour anti-Semitism compared to that of Tory Islamophobia: the BBC have covered this over ten times more. Catering primarily for Christians over other faiths The BBC's head of religion, Aaqil Ahmed, accused the BBC of neglecting Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs in its religious programming and catering primarily for Christians in 2016.accused = Biased reporting of sexual abuse scandals of BBC staffers = In the weeks after the ITV1 documentary Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile was broadcast on 3 October 2012, the BBC faced questions and criticism over allegations that it had failed to act on rumours about sexual assaults, especially on young girls, by presenter Jimmy Savile, some of which had occurred on BBC premises after the recording of programmes, including Top of the Pops and Jim'll Fix It. Allegations were also made that a Newsnight investigation into Savile in December 2011 was dropped because it conflicted with tribute programmes prepared after his death. By 11 October 2012 allegations of abuse by Savile had been made to 13 British police forces, and on 19 October Scotland Yard launched a formal criminal investigation into historic allegations of child sex abuse by Savile and others over four decades. The police reported on 25 October 2012 that the number of possible victims was 300. It was claimed that Douglas Muggeridge, the controller of BBC Radio in the early 1970s, was aware of allegations against Savile and had asked for a report on them in 1973. The BBC stated that no evidence of any allegations of misconduct or of actual misconduct by Savile had been found in its files and later denied that there had been a cover-up of Savile's activities. However, there were claims by some, including DJ Liz Kershaw, who joined BBC Radio 1 in 1987, that the culture in the BBC tolerated sexual harassment. The BBC was criticised in the UK Parliament for its handling of the affair, with Harriet Harman stating that the allegations \\"cast a stain\\" on the corporation. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said that she was satisfied that the BBC was taking the allegations very seriously and dismissed calls for an independent inquiry. Labour leader Ed Miliband said that an independent inquiry was the only way to ensure justice for those involved. George Entwistle offered to appear before the Parliamentary Culture, Media and Sport Committee to explain the BBC's position and actions. On 16 October, the BBC appointed the heads of two separate inquiries into events surrounding Savile. Former High Court judge Dame Janet Smith, who led the inquiry into serial killer Harold Shipman, would review the culture and practices of the BBC when Savile was working there, and Nick Pollard, a former Sky News executive, would look at why a Newsnight investigation into Savile's activities was dropped shortly before its transmission. A Panorama investigation was broadcast on 22 October 2012. The Director-General of the BBC, George Entwistle, declined to be interviewed, citing legal advice that BBC senior management should co- operate only with the police, the BBC reviews and Parliament. On the same day, the BBC announced that Newsnight editor Peter Rippon would \\"step aside\\" from his position with immediate effect. On 23 October, Entwistle appeared before the Parliamentary Culture, Media and Sport Committee at which he faced hostile questioning and stated that it had been a \\"catastrophic mistake\\" to cancel the Newsnight broadcast. In the context of the Savile scandal, a book written in 1999 by journalist John Simpson, Strange Places, Questionable People, was noted to have referred to an \\"Uncle Dick\\" at the BBC who had sexually assaulted children and appeared to fit the profile of BBC announcer Derek McCulloch. The author Andrew O'Hagan wrote that there had long been rumours about McCulloch's activities and those of his colleague Lionel Gamlin while they worked at the BBC in the 1940s and 1950s. The BBC said that it would \\"look into these allegations as part of the Jimmy Savile review\\". McCulloch's family described the allegations as \\"complete rubbish\\". Newsnight broadcast on 2 November 2012 a report making allegations against an unmamed \\"prominent Thatcher era Conservative politician\\" in relation to the North Wales child abuse scandal. However, the story collapsed after The Guardian reported on 8 November a case of mistaken identity, and the next day, the victim retracted the allegation. An apology was included in Newsnight on 9 November, and all ongoing Newsnight investigations were suspended. George Entwistle stated that he was unaware of the content of the report before it was broadcast and stated that Newsnight staff involved in the broadcast could be disciplined. However, Entwistle himself resigned on 10 November, after facing further criticism in the media. The Director of BBC Scotland, Ken MacQuarrie, investigated the circumstances around the Newsnight programme. His findings were published on 12 November and concluded that there had been \\"a lack of clarity around the senior editorial chain of command\\" and that \\"some of the basic journalistic checks were not completed\\". Nick Pollard's report into the shelving of a Newsnight report on Savile in 2011 was published in December 2012. It concluded that the decision to drop the original report was \\"flawed\\" and that it had not been done to protect programmes prepared as tributes to Savile. His report criticised Entwistle for apparently failing to read emails warning him of Savile's \\"dark side\\" and stated that after the allegations against Savile eventually became public, the BBC fell into a \\"level of chaos and confusion [that] was even greater than was apparent at the time\\". On 20 December 2012, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee published criticism of payments made to Entwistle after he had resigned and called the ¬£450,000 paid to him after 54 days in post, double the amount specified in his contract, together with a year's health insurance and additional payments, to be a \\"cavalier\\" use of public money.BBC News, Entwistle pay-off was cavalier use of public money ‚Äì MPs, 20 December 2012. Retrieved 20 December 2012 = Fake news and deliberate misrepresentation = Inaccurate reporting by Jeremy Bowen In April 2009, the Editorial Standards Committee of the BBC Trust published a report on three complaints brought against two news items involving Jeremy Bowen, the Middle East Editor for BBC News. The complaints included 24 allegations of inaccuracy or partiality, of which three were fully or partially upheld.Antony Lerman, The Guardian, 16 April 2009, What did Jeremy Bowen do wrong?BBC News Online, 4 June 2007, How 1967 defined the Middle East The BBC Trust's editorial standards committee found that Bowen's radio piece \\"had stated his professional view without qualification or explanation, and that the lack of precision in his language had rendered the statement inaccurate\\" and that the online article should have explained the existence of alternative views and that it had breached the rules of impartiality. However, the report did not accuse Bowen of bias. The website article was amended, and Bowen did not face any disciplinary measures. Primark and child labour fake news In 2011, after three years of Primark's effort, the BBC acknowledged that its award- winning investigative journalism report of Indian child labour use by the retailing giant was a fake. BBC apologised to Primark, Indian suppliers and its viewers. \\"Terrorist house\\" misrepresentation story In January 2016, stories originating from the BBC alleged that the Lancashire Constabulary had taken a young Muslim child away for questioning on anti- terrorism charges after he accidentally spelled \\"terraced house\\" as \\"terrorist house\\". The story was widely reported in the British and international media. The police force in question criticised the BBC's coverage of the story by stating that it was \\"untrue to suggest that this situation was brought about by a simple spelling mistake\\" and adding that the incident \\"was not responded to as a terror incident and the reporter was fully aware of this before she wrote her story\\" and that \\"the media needs to take more responsibility when sensationalising issues to make stories much bigger than they are and to realise the impact they can have on local communities\\". A statement from the police and local council also said that it was \\"untrue to suggest that this situation was brought about by a simple spelling mistake. The school and the police have acted responsibly and proportionately in looking into a number of potential concerns using a low-key, local approach\\". Other pieces of work by the student, including one where the child wrote about his uncle beating him, were allegedly other reasons for the police questioning over the safety of the child.  One-sided documentary on racism during Euro 2012  Eleven days before the tournament took place, the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama, entitled Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate, included recent footage of supporters chanting various racist slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners in Poland and Nazi salutes and the beating of South Asians in Ukraine. The documentary was first commented widely in the British press but was accused of being one-sided, biased and unethical. Critics included the British media, anti-racism campaigners, and black and Jewish community leaders in Poland, Polish and Ukrainian politicians and journalists, England fans visiting the host nations and footballers (Gary Lineker, Roy Hodgson and others). Jonathan Ornstein, the leader of Jewish community in Krak√≥w and a Jewish source used in the documentary, said: \\"I am furious at the way the BBC has exploited me as a source. The organization used me and others to manipulate the serious subject of anti-Semitism for its own sensationalist agenda... the BBC knowingly cheated its own audience ‚Äì the British people ‚Äì by concocting a false horror story about Poland. In doing so, the BBC has spread fear, ignorance, prejudice and hatred. I am profoundly disturbed by this unethical form of journalism\\". A reporter from Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's biggest left-wing newspaper, questioned Panorama's practices and stated, \\"I am becoming more and more surprised with what the BBC says. So far it has denied two situations I witnessed. I would not be surprised if the BBC prepared a statement saying that the Panorama crew has never been to Poland\\". The anti- racism campaigner Jacek Purski said, \\"The material prepared by the BBC is one- sided. It does not show the whole story of Polish preparations for the Euros. It does not show the Championship ran a lot of activities aimed at combating racism in the 'Respect Diversity' campaign. For us the Euro is not only about matches. The event has become an opportunity to fight effectively against racism and promote multiculturalism. There is no country in Europe free from racism. These are the facts\\". The nations fined by UEFA for racism were not the hosts but the visitors from Spain, Croatia, Russia and Germany. The Royal Dutch Football Association issued a complaint to UEFA after monkey chants were thought to be aimed at their black players during an open training session in Krak√≥w, but UEFA denied the chants were racially motivated. = Professional ineptitude =  Hutton Inquiry: Whitewashed reporting of Iraq invasion  The BBC was criticised for its coverage of the events before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The controversy over what it described as the \\"sexing up\\" of the case for war in Iraq by the government led to the BBC being heavily criticised by the Hutton Inquiry, although this finding was much disputed by the British press, who branded it as a government whitewash.CNN: UK press mauls Hutton 'whitewash', 29 January 2004 (on the reaction of the British press to the final report) The BBC's chairman and its director general resigned after the inquiry, and Vice-Chairman Lord Ryder made a public apology to the government, which the Liberal Democrat Norman Baker MP described as \\"of such capitulation that I wanted to throw up when I heard it\\".Baker, Norman: The Strange Death of David Kelly, London: Methuen, 2007  Shallow and sensationalist reporting on Arab Spring  In June 2012, the BBC admitted making \\"major errors\\" in its coverage of the unrest. In an 89-page report, 9 pages were devoted to the BBC's coverage of Bahrain and included admissions that the BBC had \\"underplayed the sectarian aspect of the conflict\\" and \\"not adequately convey the viewpoint of supporters of the monarchy\\" by \\"[failing] to mention attempts by Crown Prince\\" Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa to \\"establish dialogue with the opposition\\". The report added that \\"the government appears to have made a good-faith effort to de-escalate the crisis\\", particularly while the BBC's coverage of the unrest dropped substantially, and many people had complained that their coverage was \\"utterly one-sided\\".  Hypocrisy on climate change  The BBC has been criticised for hypocrisy over its high carbon footprint despite the amount of coverage that it gives to the topic of climate change. Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman argued that its correspondents \\"travel the globe to tell the audience of the dangers of climate change while leaving a vapour trail which will make the problem even worse\\". Paxman further argues that the 'BBC's coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago'. At the 2007 Edinburgh International Television Festival, Peter Horrocks, the head of television news, and Peter Barron, the editor of Newsnight, said that the BBC should not campaign on climate change. They criticised the proposed plans for a BBC Comic Relief- style day of programmes on climate change. Horrocks was quoted as saying, \\"I absolutely don't think we should do that because it's not impartial. It's not our job to lead people and proselytise about it\\". Barron was quoted as adding, \\"It is absolutely not the BBC's job to save the planet. I think there are a lot of people who think that, but it must be stopped\\"., BBC Drops Climate Change Special, Media Guardian, 5 September Horrocks later outlined the BBC's position on the BBC Editors Blog (\\"No Line\\"). The plans for a day of programmes on environmental issues were abandoned in September 2007. A BBC spokesperson said that it was \\"absolutely not\\" because of concerns about impartiality. In July 2011 a BBC Trust review cited findings of an assessment by Professor Steve Jones of University College London. Jones found there was sometimes an \\"over-rigid\\" application of the editorial guidelines on impartiality in relation to science coverage, which failed to take into account what he regarded as the \\"non-contentious\\" nature of some stories and the need to avoid giving \\"undue attention to marginal opinion\\". Jones gave reporting of the safety of the MMR vaccine and more recent coverage of claims about the safety of genetically-modified crops and the existence of man-made climate change as examples. In 2017, the BBC apologised for allowing climate change denier Nigel Lawson to claim that global temperatures had not risen in the past decade on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, which the organisation acknowledged breached its editorial guidelines., and in 2018, Carbon Brief released an internal notice sent by Fran Unsworth, the BBC director of news and current affairs, that argued that the BBC's coverage of climate change often went against its own guidelines on accuracy and created a false balance with regard to impartiality: \\"Manmade climate change exists: If the science proves it we should report it.... To achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage, in the same way you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2‚Äì0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken\\". The BBC is alleged to have attempted to cover up a climate change seminar that is credited with shaping its coverage of the environment. =Sexism= Annie Nightingale was repeatedly refused a job as a disc jockey on Radio 1 on the basis that ‚ÄúOur disc jockeys are husband substitutes‚ÄùBBC Radio 4 ‚Äì Desert Island Discs - Annie Nightingale, DJ, 19 July 2020  \\"Overstaffing\\"  The BBC has been criticised for \\"overstaffing\\" news, sporting and cultural events and in doing so, both wasting licence fee money and using its dominant position to control the coverage of events. A 2010 House of Commons Public Accounts Committee report criticised the number of staff that the BBC had sent to sporting events such as the Beijing Olympics and the Euro 2008 football championships. In June 2011, the BBC sent 263 staff to cover the Glastonbury Festival. The next month, it sent 250 staff members to cover an event marking one year until the start of the London 2012 Olympics, ten times the numbers that were used by other broadcasters. On 19 October 2011, the Liberal Democrats' culture spokesman, Don Foster, criticised the large number of BBC staff members who attended the eviction of Travellers and their supporters from the illegal section of the Dale Farm site. Foster stated that it was \\"ludicrous overstaffing and hardly [a] good way to get public sympathy for the 20 per cent budget cuts facing the BBC\\". The BBC responded that it had only 20 staff members on site.  Funding  The fact that the BBC's domestic services are funded mainly by a television licence fee is heavily criticised by its competitors and others on a number of grounds. The rise of multichannel digital television led to criticism that the licence fee is unjustifiable on the basis that minority interest programmes can now be transmitted on specialist commercial subscription channels and that the licence fee is funding a number of digital-only channels, which many licence holders cannot watch (such as BBC Three and BBC Four). However, since 24 October 2012, with the completion of the digital switchover, all licence payers can now access that content.  BBC Russia  On 17 August 2007, it was reported that FM broadcast of the BBC's Russian-language service in Russia would be dropped, leaving only medium- and short-wave broadcasts. The financial organisation Finam, which owns the FM radio service that dropped the BBC Russia broadcasts, said through its spokesman, Igor Ermachenkov, \\"Any media which is government- financed is propaganda ‚Äì it's a fact, it's not negative\\". A spokesman, for the BBC responded, \\"Although the BBC is funded by the UK government... a fundamental principle of its constitution and its regulatory regime is that it is editorially independent of the UK government\\". Reports put the development in the context of criticism of the Russian government for curbing media freedom and strained British-Russian relations. Reporters Without Borders condemned the move as censorship.  \\"London-centrism\\": Lack of national representation  On 1 November 2007, it was reported that Sir Michael Lyons, the chairman of the BBC Trust, criticised the BBC as too London-centric and paying less attention to news stories outside the capital. In light of such criticism in terms of both news and general programming and in recognition of its mandate to represent the entire UK and to encourage creativity throughout the country, active efforts have been made by the Trust and Board of Governors to correct the regional imbalance. That is reflected in a commitment to produce at least half of programmes outside Greater London, a target that the BBC achieved in 2013 and 2014 but fell short of in 2015. The BBC's annual report for 2015‚Äì2016 refers to the \\"London bubble\\" and claims that it represents not an active bias but the fact that London is where so many decisions and programming are made. While notable investments in production capacity outside London have been made, such as the creation of MediaCityUK in Salford, Greater Manchester, spending figures for regional radio and television production has fallen in real terms. That accompanied a reduction of nearly ¬£600 million in funding for the BBC as a whole since 2010. The UK's move towards increased devolution in the areas of healthcare, education and a range of other policy areas has created additional challenges for the BBC. The flagship newscasts are based in London and tend to report \\"nation-wide\\" stories related to government and policy that often pertain only England or sometimes England and Wales. The BBC Trust and Future for Public Service Television Inquiry recognised that it requires more clarity in UK-wide news programming (for example, by explaining that the Junior Doctors Strike affected only England or that Scotland and Northern Ireland are exempt from the bedroom tax and the funding changes leading to the 2010 student protests), and it creates an additional responsibility for the home nations to report on devolved matters. From 2016, BBC management would go before the devolved committees for culture or media to answer questions and criticism, just as for the Westminster Culture, Media, and Sport Committee. = Wales Coverage = In August 2007, Adam Price, a Plaid Cymru MP, highlighted what he perceived as a lack of a Welsh focus on BBC news broadcasts. Price threatened to withhold future television licence fees in response to a lack of thorough news coverage of Wales and echoed a BBC Audience Council for Wales July report that cited public frustration over how the Welsh Assembly is characterised in national media. Plaid Cymru Welsh Assembly Member Bethan Jenkins agreed with Price and called for responsibility for broadcasting to be devolved to the Welsh Assembly. Similar calls were voiced from Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. Criticism of the BBC's news coverage for Wales and Scotland since devolution has prompted debate of providing evening news broadcasts with specific focus for both countries. = Scotland coverage controversy =  Scottish independence referendum, 2014  The National Union of Journalists criticised the BBC in October 2012 for its poor coverage of the Scotland independence referendum, which took place on 18 September 2014. The BBC reportedly \\"downplayed the costs of referendum coverage, claiming it was a 'one off'\\". According to a research team led by Dr John Robertson from the University of the West of Scotland, the BBC's first year of referendum coverage, until September 2013, was biased towards the unionist No campaign. Andrew Marr, the BBC presenter, was accused of expressing anti-independence views in a March 2014 interview with Alex Salmond. The BBC allowed the Better Together campaign to make a unionist cinema advertisement at its Glasgow studios in April 2014, which was thought to contravene its editorial guidelines.Martyn McLaughlin \\"Better Together film ‚Äòmade in BBC studio‚Äô\\", The Scotsman, 14 June 2014 According to The Scotsman, the BBC appointed Kezia Dugdale, Labour's education spokeswoman, as presenter of Crossfire, a radio programme debating issues relating to the referendum. The newspaper believed the arrangement to be also a breach of the BBC's guidelines and asserted that Dugdale is \\"a member of Scottish Labour's Truth Team ‚Äì set up to monitor all SNP and Yes Scotland interviews, press statements and briefing papers\\" in the runup to the September vote.Martyn McLaughlin \\"Independence: BBC criticised for MSP Indyref role\\", The Scotsman, 18 June 2014 A report by the Audience Council Scotland, the BBC Trust's advisory body in Scotland, questioned the impartiality of BBC Scotland in covering the independence referendum in July 2014. A Sunday Times article, also in July 2014, queried the BBC's approach to the independence referendum and stated that emails by a senior member of a BBC production company organising debates gave advance notice to the No campaign.\\"Better Together ‚Äòtipped off‚Äô on BBC debates\\", Sunday Times, 20 July 2014 On 10 September 2014, the BBC was accused of bias in its reporting of an Alex Salmond press conference for the international media. In a response to a question by the BBC's Nick Robinson, Salmond accused him of heckling and wanted an inquiry by the British Cabinet Secretary into a leak to the BBC from the Treasury onplans of the Royal Bank of Scotland to relocate its registered office to London, which had been in the previous evening's news.Simon Johnson \\"Alex Salmond goes to war with BBC over RBS 'leak'\\", The Daily Telegraph, 11 September 2014 In response to complaints on editing live coverage of the conference for later bulletins, the BBC said: \\"The BBC considers that the questions were valid and the overall report balanced and impartial, in line with our editorial guidelines\\". After a day of protests from Yes campaigners and demands for Robinson to be sacked,Ben Riley-Smith \\"Scottish independence: Nationalists demand Nick Robinson sacking in vocal anti-BBC protest\\", The Daily Telegraph, 14 September 2014 the following Monday (15 September), Salmond responded to questions from journalists at Edinburgh Airport. About Robinson's report in later bulletins, he said: \\"I don't think it was fair for Nick to suggest that I hadn't answered a question when I actually answered it twice\\". He did not believe that Robinson should be sacked.Severin Carroll \\"Alex Salmond backs protests against 'bias' shown by BBC's Nick Robinson\\", The Guardian, 15 September 2014 The former BBC correspondent Paul Mason was reported in September 2014 to have been critical of the BBC's reporting on his Facebook page that had been intended to be read only by his friends: \\"Not since Iraq have I seen BBC News working at propaganda strength like this. So glad I'm out of there\\". Channel 4's director of creative diversity, Stuart Cosgrove called for a rethink at the BBC on the nature of balance and due impartiality. That was during a BBC Scotland radio conversation hosted by John Beattie. Cosgrove commented, \\"Yesterday, I was watching the rolling BBC News very closely and it was clear that notions of balance were being predicated on a party political basis. It would go from Cameron to Miliband to Clegg and back. If you look at it as a different premise ‚Äì it‚Äôs a yes/no question ‚Äì then Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens, who is not the leader but is a significant political person within the Yes campaign, should have had exactly the same coverage as Ed Miliband. Do you think for a second he got that? Of course he didn't. I think there's been a failure of the understanding of the nature of balance and due impartiality. It's simply wrong and not acceptable\\". An interview of Salmond for the Sunday Herald published on 14 September 2014 included his opinion that the BBC had displayed a unionist bias during the referendum.\\"'Is the BBC's coverage biased? Yes, absolutely.... Don't get me wrong, I like these folk, but they don't realise they're biased. It's the unconscious bias which is extraordinary'\\"., Sunday Herald, 14 September 2014 \\"Off payroll\\" tax arrangements In October 2012, a Public Accounts Committee report found that the BBC had 25,000 \\"off payroll\\" contracts, 13,000 for people who were on air. The contracts enable people to make their own arrangements to pay tax and National Insurance, which could allow them to contribute less than employees on pay-as-you-earn tax. In response, the BBC said many of them were short-term contracts but that it was carrying out a detailed review of tax arrangements.

In theatre she was known for her performances in light comedy and appeared in several popular television series during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Early life Born in Southport, Lancashire, Jeanne Wilkinson, as she then was, spent her early childhood in India, where her father was a senior manager at the Swadeshi Cotton Mills in Kanpur. At the age of six, she and her twin brother Geoffrey were sent to schools in the hills near Simla. Getting there took a two-day train journey. The term lasted nine months, and there were three months at home during the cool season. The schools were not mixed, so she and her brother only met at church on Sundays. Holden was heartbroken when her twin brother drowned during the early 1960s. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Holden and her mother returned to Britain, where she became a boarder at Lowther College in North Wales. When the war ended, her mother returned to India while Jan stayed at her school and lived with school friends during the holidays. At the age of eighteen, she was offered places at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the Old Vic School, and the Bristol Old Vic, but her father declined to pay the fees, as he disapproved of her ambition to go on the stage. Eventually, he was persuaded to allow her to take a directors' course at the Old Vic, where she was one of two pupils chosen as assistant stage managers. Career After the Old Vic, Holden turned to repertory, where she met her first husband, the actor Edwin Richfield. The couple married in 1952, while they were both appearing in a stage version of The Blue Lamp. Holden was an elegant actress, known for her arresting pale blue eyes. She made her West End debut in 1958 in Speaking of Murder at St Martin's Theatre, which was followed by The Tunnel of Love, a farce at the Apollo Theatre. =Television= Her television credits included Fabian of the Yard, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents, The Champions, The Vice, The Avengers, Bird of Prey, The Cheaters, The Saint,Burl Barer, The Saint: A Complete History in Print, Radio, Film, and Television, 1928-1992 (McFarland, 2003), p 316 The Baron, Harpers West One, Are You Being Served?, Casanova '73, Agony and O Happy Band!. Private life Holden's marriage to actor Edwin Richfield broke down in 1973, leaving her with three teenage children. In 1988, she married Louis Manson, a solicitor and businessman, but she was already in poor health and remained so during her final two decades. In 1999, one of her twin daughters died from a brain tumour, but she remained cheerful and courageous until her own death in 2005. She was survived by her husband, the son and remaining daughter of her first marriage, and two stepdaughters and four stepsons.

The song was considered for inclusion on the band's sixth album, Don't Believe the Truth, but missed the final cut. In October 2005, Noel Gallagher announced that the song was set to lead a summer 2006 UK EP release. In an interview with the NME, he said: \\"I think we‚Äôre gonna put out just as a single, that‚Äôs not going be on the next album.\\" The sessions for that EP never occurred and the release was cancelled in early 2006. Noel, in a December 2005 interview for the NME, described the track as being driven by a piano and acoustic guitars. He also mentioned that the track has got a chant at the end, where the words go \\"'Come all together / If we come all together / We'll come all together for you'.\\" He was quoted as saying \\"It's a bit like Spiritualized, y'know, when they do that gospel thing. The bulk of the song is only about three minutes long, but the outro could go on forever, really.\\" Noel also said the track didn't go on the Don't Believe the Truth album because of a lack of a chorus. He also said that the track needed more work done on it and spoke of planned recording session in January 2006 during a break in their Don't Believe the Truth world tour. However, these sessions didn't take place. In different interviews conducted in February 2006, Noel and Liam both made conflicting statements as to the future of the track. Liam was quoted as saying, \\"After the tour we'll do some recording, then we'll put it out,\\" whilst Noel said, \\"We had a couple of tracks left over from the last record and in our own heads we thought they were good enough to be released as an EP. We went back and listened to the tapes and we reckon we can get it better, so we're having the year off instead.\\" In the February 2007 NME issue, Noel said: \\"It could be like a gospel track.

The theory of Gelfand pairs is closely related to the topic of spherical functions in the classical theory of special functions, and to the theory of Riemannian symmetric spaces in differential geometry. Broadly speaking, the theory exists to abstract from these theories their content in terms of harmonic analysis and representation theory. When G is a finite group the simplest definition is, roughly speaking, that the (K,K)-double cosets in G commute. More precisely, the Hecke algebra, the algebra of functions on G that are invariant under translation on either side by K, should be commutative for the convolution on G. In general, the definition of Gelfand pair is roughly that the restriction to H of any irreducible representation of G contains the trivial representation of H with multiplicity no more than 1. In each case one should specify the class of considered representations and the meaning of contains. Definitions In each area, the class of representations and the definition of containment for representations is slightly different. Explicit definitions in several such cases are given here. =Finite group case= When G is a finite group the following are equivalent * (G,K) is a Gelfand pair. * The algebra of (K,K)-double invariant functions on G with multiplication defined by convolution is commutative. * For any irreducible representation œÄ of G, the space œÄK of K-invariant vectors in œÄ is no-more-than-1-dimensional. * For any irreducible representation œÄ of G, the dimension of HomK(œÄ, C) is less than or equal to 1, where C denotes the trivial representation. * The permutation representation of G on the cosets of K is multiplicity-free, that is, it decomposes into a direct sum of distinct absolutely irreducible representations in characteristic zero. * The centralizer algebra (Schur algebra) of the permutation representation is commutative. * (G/N, K/N) is a Gelfand pair, where N is a normal subgroup of G contained in K. =Compact group case= When G is a compact topological group the following are equivalent: * (G,K) is a Gelfand pair. * The algebra of (K,K)-double invariant compactly supported continuous measures on G with multiplication defined by convolution is commutative. * For any continuous, locally convex, irreducible representation œÄ of G, the space œÄK of K-invariant vectors in œÄ is no-more- than-1-dimensional. * For any continuous, locally convex, irreducible representation œÄ of G the dimension of HomK(œÄ,C) is less than or equal to 1. * The representation L2(G/K) of G is multiplicity free i.e. it is a direct sum of distinct unitary irreducible representations. =Lie group with compact subgroup= When G is a Lie group and K is a compact subgroup the following are equivalent: * (G,K) is a Gelfand pair. * The algebra of (K,K)-double invariant compactly supported continuous measures on G with multiplication defined by convolution is commutative. * The algebra D(G/K)K of K-invariant differential operators on G/K is commutative. * For any continuous, locally convex, irreducible representation œÄ of G, the space œÄK of K-invariant vectors in œÄ is no-more-than-1-dimensional. * For any continuous, locally convex, irreducible representation œÄ of G the dimension of HomK(œÄ, C) is less than or equal to 1. * The representation L2(G/K) of G is multiplicity free i.e. it is a direct integral of distinct unitary irreducible representations. For a classification of such Gelfand pairs see.O. Yakimova. Gelfand pairs, PhD thesis submitted to Bonn university. Classical examples of such Gelfand pairs are (G,K), where G is a reductive Lie group and K is a maximal compact subgroup. =Locally compact topological group with compact subgroup= When G is a locally compact topological group and K is a compact subgroup the following are equivalent: * (G,K) is a Gelfand pair. * The algebra of (K,K)-double invariant compactly supported continuous measures on G with multiplication defined by convolution is commutative. * For any continuous locally convex irreducible representation œÄ of G, the space œÄK of K-invariant vectors in œÄ is no-more-than-1-dimensional. * For any continuous, locally convex, irreducible representation œÄ of G, the dimension of HomK(œÄ, C) is less than or equal to 1. * The representation L2(G/K) of G is multiplicity free i.e. it is a direct integral of distinct unitary irreducible representations. In that setting, G has an Iwasawa-Monod decomposition, namely G = K P for some amenable subgroup P of G.Nicolas Monod, \\"Gelfand pairs admit an Iwasawa decomposition\\". This is the abstract analogue of the Iwasawa decomposition of semisimple Lie groups. =Lie group with closed subgroup= When G is a Lie group and K is a closed subgroup, the pair (G,K) is called a generalized Gelfand pair if for any irreducible unitary representation œÄ of G on a Hilbert space the dimension of HomK(œÄ, C) is less than or equal to 1, where œÄ‚àû denotes the subrepresentation of smooth vectors. =Reductive group over a local field with closed subgroup= When G is a reductive group over a local field and K is a closed subgroup, there are three (possibly non-equivalent) notions of Gelfand pair appearing in the literature. We will call them here GP1, GP2, and GP3. GP1) For any irreducible admissible representation œÄ of G the dimension of HomK(œÄ, C) is less than or equal to 1. GP2) For any irreducible admissible representation œÄ of G we have \\\\dim \\\\mathrm{Hom}_K(\\\\pi, \\\\mathbf{C}) \\\\cdot \\\\dim \\\\mathrm{Hom}_K(\\\\tilde{\\\\pi}, \\\\mathbf{C}) \\\\leq 1, where \\\\tilde{\\\\pi} denotes the smooth dual. GP3) For any irreducible unitary representation œÄ of G on a Hilbert space the dimension of HomK(œÄ, C) is less than or equal to 1. Here, admissible representation is the usual notion of admissible representation when the local field is non-archimedean. When the local field is archimedean, admissible representation instead means smooth Fr√©chet representation of moderate growth such that the corresponding Harish-Chandra module is admissible. If the local field is archimedean, then GP3 is the same as generalized Gelfand property defined in the previous case. Clearly, GP1 ‚áí GP2 ‚áí GP3. Strong Gelfand pairs A pair (G,K) is called a strong Gelfand pair if the pair (G √ó K, ŒîK) is a Gelfand pair, where ŒîK ‚â§ G √ó K is the diagonal subgroup: {(k,k) in G √ó K : k in K}. Sometimes, this property is also called the multiplicity one property. In each of the above cases can be adapted to strong Gelfand pairs. For example, let G be a finite group. Then the following are equivalent. * (G,K) is a strong Gelfand pair. * The algebra of functions on G invariant with respect to conjugation by K (with multiplication defined by convolution) is commutative. * For any irreducible representation œÄ of G and œÑ of K, the space HomK(œÑ,œÄ) is no-more-than-1-dimensional. * For any irreducible representation œÄ of G and œÑ of K, the space HomK(œÄ,œÑ) is no-more- than-1-dimensional. Criteria for Gelfand property =Locally compact topological group with compact subgroup= In this case there is a classical criterion due to Gelfand for the pair (G,K) to be Gelfand: Suppose that there exists an involutive anti-automorphism œÉ of G s.t. any (K,K) double coset is œÉ invariant. Then the pair (G,K) is a Gelfand pair. This criterion is equivalent to the following one: Suppose that there exists an involutive anti- automorphism œÉ of G such that any function on G which is invariant with respect to both right and left translations by K is œÉ invariant. Then the pair (G,K) is a Gelfand pair. =Reductive group over a local field with closed subgroup= In this case there is a criterion due to Gelfand and Kazhdan for the pair (G,K) to satisfy GP2. Suppose that there exists an involutive anti- automorphism œÉ of G such that any (K,K)-double invariant distribution on G is œÉ-invariant. Then the pair (G,K) satisfies GP2. SeeI.M. Gelfand, D. Kazhdan, Representations of the group GL(n,K) where K is a local field, Lie groups and their representations (Proc. Summer School, Bolyai J√°nos Math. Soc., Budapest, 1971), pp. 95--118. Halsted, New York (1975).A. Aizenbud, D. Gourevitch, E. Sayag : (GL_{n+1}(F),GL_n(F)) is a Gelfand pair for any local field F. . If the above statement holds only for positive definite distributions then the pair satisfies GP3 (see the next case). The property GP1 often follows from GP2. For example, this holds if there exists an involutive anti-automorphism of G that preserves K and preserves every closed conjugacy class. For G = GL(n) the transposition can serve as such involution. =Lie group with closed subgroup= In this case there is the following criterion for the pair (G,K) to be generalized Gelfand pair. Suppose that there exists an involutive anti- automorphism œÉ of G s.t. any K √ó K invariant positive definite distribution on G is œÉ-invariant. Then the pair (G,K) is a generalized Gelfand pair. See.E.G.F. Thomas, The theorem of Bochner-Schwartz-Godement for generalized Gelfand pairs, Functional Analysis: Surveys and results III, Bierstedt, K.D., Fuchssteiner, B. (eds.), Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. (North Holland), (1984). =Criteria for strong Gelfand property= All the above criteria can be turned into criteria for strong Gelfand pairs by replacing the two-sided action of K √ó K by the conjugation action of K. Twisted Gelfand pairs A generalization of the notion of Gelfand pair is the notion of twisted Gelfand pair. Namely a pair (G,K) is called a twisted Gelfand pair with respect to the character œá of the group K, if the Gelfand property holds true when the trivial representation is replaced with the character œá. For example, in case when K is compact it meanes that the dimension of HomK(œÄ, œá)) is less than or equal to 1. One can adapt the criterion for Gelfand pairs to the case of twisted Gelfand pairs. Symmetric pairs The Gelfand property is often satisfied by symmetric pairs. A pair (G,K) is called a symmetric pair if there exists an involutive automorphism Œ∏ of G such that K is a union of connected components of the group of Œ∏-invariant elements: GŒ∏. If G is a connected reductive group over R and K=GŒ∏ is a compact subgroup then (G,K) is a Gelfand pair. Example: G = GL(n,R) and K = O(n,R), the subgroup of orthogonal matrices. In general, it is an interesting question when a symmetric pair of a reductive group over a local field has the Gelfand property. For symmetric pairs of rank one this question was investigated inG. van Dijk. On a class of generalized Gelfand pairs, Math. Z. 193, 581-593 (1986). and An example of high rank Gelfand symmetric pair is (GL(n+k), GL(n) √ó GL(k)). This was proven inH. Jacquet, S. Rallis, Uniqueness of linear periods., Compositio Mathematica , tome 102, n.o. 1 , p. 65-123 (1996). over non-archimedean local fields and later inA. Aizenbud, D. Gourevitch, An archimedean analog of Jacquet - Rallis theorem. for all local fields of characteristic zero. For more details on this question for high rank symmetric pairs see.A. Aizenbud, D.Gourevitch, Generalized Harish-Chandra descent and applications to Gelfand pairs. Spherical pairs In the context of algebraic groups the analogs of Gelfand pairs are called spherical pair. Namely, a pair (G,K) of algebraic groups is called a spherical pair if one of the following equivalent conditions holds. * There exists an open (B,K)-double coset in G, where B is the Borel subgroup of G. * There is a finite number of (B,K)-double coset in G * For any algebraic representation œÄ of G, we have dim œÄ^K ‚â§ 1. In this case the space G/H is called spherical space. It is conjectured that any spherical pair (G,K) over a local field satisfies the following weak version of the Gelfand property: For any admissible representation œÄ of G, the space HomK(œÄ,C) is finite- dimensional. Moreover, the bound for this dimension does not depend on œÄ. This conjecture is proven for a large class of spherical pairs including all the symmetric pairs.Yiannis Sakellaridis and Akshay Venkatesh, \\"Periods and harmonic analysis on spherical varieties\\". Applications =Classification= Gelfand pairs are often used for classification of irreducible representations in the following way: Let (G,K) be a Gelfand pair. An irreducible representation of G called K-distinguished if HomK(œÄ,C) is 1-dimensional. The representation Ind(C) is a model for all K-distinguished representations i.e. any K-distinguished representation appears there with multiplicity exactly 1. A similar notion exists for twisted Gelfand pairs. Example: If G is a reductive group over a local field and K is its maximal compact subgroup, then K distinguished representations are called spherical, such representations can be classified via the Satake correspondence. The notion of spherical representation is in the basis of the notion of Harish- Chandra module. Example: If G is split reductive group over a local field and K is its maximal unipotent subgroup then the pair (G,K) is twisted Gelfand pair w.r.t. any non-degenerate character œà (see,J.A. Shalika, The multiplicity one theorem for GLn, Ann. of Math. 100(1974) 171‚Äì193. ). In this case K-distinguished representations are called generic (or non-degenerate) and they are easy to classify. Almost any irreducible representation is generic. The unique (up to scalar) imbedding of a generic representation to Ind(œà) is called a Whittaker model. In the case of G=GL(n) there is a finer version of the result above, namely there exist a finite sequence of subgroups Ki and characters \\\\psi_i s.t. (G,Ki) is twisted Gelfand pair w.r.t. \\\\psi_i and any irreducible unitary representation is Ki distinguished for exactly one i (see,Omer Offen, Eitan Sayag, Global Mixed Periods and local Klyachko models for the general linear group, Omer Offen, Eitan Sayag, UNIQUENESS AND DISJOINTNESS OF KLYACHKO MODELS , ) =Gelfand‚ÄìZeitlin construction= One can also use Gelfand pairs for constructing bases for irreducible representations: suppose we have a sequence {1} ‚äÇ G1 ‚äÇ ... ‚äÇ Gn s.t. (Gi,Gi-1) is a strong Gelfand pair. For simplicity let's assume that Gn is compact. Then this gives a canonical decomposition of any irreducible representation of Gn to one- dimensional subrepresentations. When Gn = U(n) (the unitary group) this construction is called Gelfand Zeitlin basis. Since the representations of U(n) are the same as algebraic representations of GL(n) so we also obtain a basis of any algebraic irreducible representation of GL(n). However one should be aware that the constructed basis isn't canonical as it depends of the choice of the embeddings U(i) ‚äÇ U(i+1). =Splitting of periods of automorphic forms= A more recent use of Gelfand pairs is for splitting of periods of automorphic forms. Let G be a reductive group defined over a global field F and let K be an algebraic subgroup of G. Suppose that for any place u of F the pair (G, K) is a Gelfand pair over the completion F_ u. Let m be an automorphic form over G, then its H-period splits as a product of local factors (i.e. factors that depends only on the behavior of m at each place u). Now suppose we are given a family of automorphic forms with a complex parameter s. Then the period of those forms is an analytic function which splits into a product of local factors. Often this means that this function is a certain L-function and this gives an analytic continuation and functional equation for this L-function. Remark: usually those periods do not converge and one should regularize them. =Generalization of representation theory= A possible approach to representation theory is to consider representation theory of a group G as a harmonic analysis on the group G w.r.t. the two sided action of G √ó G. Indeed, to know all the irreducible representations of G is equivalent to know the decomposition of the space of functions on G as a G √ó G representation. In this approach representation theory can be generalized by replacing the pair (G √ó G, G) by any spherical pair (G,K). Then we will be led to the question of harmonic analysis on the space G/K w.r.t. the action of G. Now the Gelfand property for the pair (G,K) is an analog of the Schur's lemma. Using this approach one can take any concepts of representation theory and generalize them to the case of spherical pair. For example, the relative trace formula is obtained from the trace formula by this procedure. Examples =Finite groups= A few common examples of Gelfand pairs are: * (Sym(n+1), Sym(n)), the symmetric group acting on n+1 points and a point stabilizer that is naturally isomorphic to on n points. * (AGL(n, q), GL(n, q)), the affine (general linear) group and a point stabilizer that is naturally isomorphic to the general linear group. If (G,K) is a Gelfand pair, then (G/N,K/N) is a Gelfand pair for every G-normal subgroup N of K. For many purposes it suffices to consider K without any such non-identity normal subgroups. The action of G on the cosets of K is thus faithful, so one is then looking at permutation groups G with point stabilizers K. To be a Gelfand pair is equivalent to [1_K,\\\\chi\\\\downarrow^G_K] \\\\leq 1 for every œá in Irr(G). Since [1_K,\\\\chi\\\\downarrow^G_K] = [1\\\\uparrow_K^G,\\\\chi] by Frobenius reciprocity and 1\\\\uparrow_K^G is the character of the permutation action, a permutation group defines a Gelfand pair if and only if the permutation character is a so-called multiplicity-free permutation character. Such multiplicity-free permutation characters were determined for the sporadic groups in . This gives rise to a class of examples of finite groups with Gelfand pairs: the 2-transitive groups. A permutation group G is 2-transitive if the stabilizer K of a point acts transitively on the remaining points. In particular, G the symmetric group on n+1 points and K the symmetric group on n points forms a Gelfand pair for every n‚â•1. This follows because the character of a 2-transitive permutation action is of the form 1+œá for some irreducible character œá and the trivial character 1, . Indeed, if G is a transitive permutation group whose point stabilizer K has at most four orbits (including the trivial orbit containing only the stabilized point), then its Schur ring is commutative and (G,K) is a Gelfand pair, . If G is a primitive group of degree twice a prime with point stabilizer K, then again (G,K) is a Gelfand pair, . The Gelfand pairs (Sym(n),K) were classified in . Roughly speaking, K must be contained as a subgroup of small index in one of the following groups unless n is smaller than 18: Sym(n - k)√ó Sym(k), Sym(n/2) wr Sym(2), Sym(2) wr Sym(n/2) for n even, Sym(n - 5) √ó AGL(1,5), Sym(n - 6) √ó PGL(2,5), or Sym(n - 9) √ó PŒìL(2,8). Gelfand pairs for classical groups have been investigated as well. =Symmetric pairs with compact K= * (GL(n,R), O(n,R)) * (GL(n,C), U(n)) * (O(n+k,R), O(n,R) √ó O(k,R)) * (U(n+k), U(n) √ó U(k)) * (G,K) where G is a reductive Lie group and K is a maximal compact subgroup. =Symmetric Gelfand pairs of rank one= Let F be a local field of characteristic zero. * (SL(n+1,F), GL(n,F)) for n > 5. * (Sp(2n+2,F), Sp(2n,F)) √ó Sp(2,F)) for n > 4. * (SO(V ‚äï F), SO(V)) where V is a vector space over F with a non-degenerate quadratic form. =Symmetric pairs of high rank= Let F be a local field of characteristic zero. Let G be a reductive group over F. The following are examples of symmetric Gelfand pairs of high rank: * (G √ó G, ŒîG): Follows from Schur's lemma. * (GL(n+k,F), GL(n,F) √ó GL(k,F)). * (GL(2n,F), Sp(2n,F)).E.Sayag (GL(2n,C),SP(2n,C)) is a Gelfand Pair * (O(n+k,C), O(n,C) √ó O(k,C)).A. Aizenbud, D. Gourevitch. Some regular symmetric pairs. * (GL(n,C), O(n,C)). * (GL(n,E), GL(n,F)), where E is a quadratic extension of F.Y.Z. Flicker: On distinguished representations, J. Reine Angew. Math. 418 (1991), 139-172. =Strong Gelfand pairs= The following pairs are strong Gelfand pairs: * (Sym(n+1), Sym(n)), this is proven using the involutive anti- automorphism g ‚Ü¶ g‚àí1. * (GL(n+1,F), GL(n,F)) where F is a local field of characteristic zero. * (O(V ‚äï F), O(V)) where V is a vector space over F with a non-degenerate quadratic form. * U(V ‚äï E), U(V)) where E is a quadratic extension of F and V is a vector space over E with a non-degenerate hermitian form. Those four examples can be rephrased as the statement that the following are Gelfand pairs: * (Sym(n+1) √ó Sym(n), Œî Sym(n)). * (GL(n+1,F) √ó GL(n,F), Œî GL(n,F)) * (O(V ‚äï F) √ó O(V), Œî O(V)) * (U(V ‚äï E) √ó U(V), Œî U(V)) See also * spherical function * Symmetric pair * Spherical pair Notes References  * * Category:Representation theory of groups Category:Representation theory of Lie groups Category:Harmonic analysis ","title":"Gelfand pair"},{"id":"3018621","text":"The Tal Committee was an Israeli public committee appointed on 22 August 1999 which dealt with the special exemption from mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) given to Israeli ultra-Orthodox Jews which had been the status quo from the time of Ben Gurion, as well as extending mandatory military service to Israeli-Arabs. The committee was appointed by Prime Minister Ehud Barak and was initially headed by former Supreme Court Justice Tzvi Tal. The committee was later headed by Yohanan Plesner before its official dissolution on 2 July 2012, two days before submitting its report, hence the term Plesner Committee. Based on the committee recommendations, on 23 July 2002 the Knesset passed the temporary Tal Law, which expired after five years and was renewed. The law authorises a continuation of the exemption to yeshiva students subject to the conditions within the law. According to the law, at the age of 22, yeshiva students have a \\"decision year\\" and can choose between one-year civilian national service alongside a paying job or a shortened 16-month military service and future service in the reserves as an alternative to continuing to study. Five motions against the law were filed with the High Court of Justice claiming it violated the principle of equality. In 2005, the state admitted, in a response to a Supreme Court petition, that the Tal Law had failed to change enlistment arrangements for ultra-Orthodox Jews, as only a few dozen had enlisted in the army as a result. The law was then extended in 2007 for another five years. On 21 February 2012, the High Court ruled that the law is unconstitutional. History Although yeshiva students were not technically exempt from military service, their enlistment was annually postponed until they received an age or parental exemption. This situation, while in practice from the early days of Israel, was viewed by many as undemocratic, unjust and unequal. Unlike other exemptions from military service given to some groups in Israel (Bedouin, Arabs, and others), it was based on a ministerial order and not specified in the law. In 1974 only 2.4% of the soldiers enlisting to the army that year were exempt because they were yeshiva members, under the Torato Omanuto arrangement. This number reached 9.2% in 1999, when it was anticipated that this percentage will reach up to 15% by the year 2012. By comparison, in the year 2025 the orthodox sector in Israel is expected to reach 12.4% of the total population, whereas the children of this sector would reach 22.4%. In 1999 there were 30,414 exempted yeshiva students, and by 2005 the number grew to 41,450. To be recognized as an exempt yeshiva student one must meet two conditions: dedicate one's whole time for the purpose of studying Torah in a recognized yeshiva institute, and not be employed in any work in which salary would be provided. The Finance Ministry of Israel presented data which indicates an unreasonable rise in the number of exempt young men. According to that data the number of the students grew 237% between the years 1985‚Äì1998, while the number of young men growth at the same period was 354%. This disproportional increase, creating an economical and a security burden on the other sectors of the Israeli population, led to an appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court. The Tal committee was appointed after the Supreme Court determined that the minister of defense had no authority to determine the extent of the exemption from army service given to ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students. The ruling also elaborated on the need for a legislative solution, dealing with all aspects of the issue. Other committees before the Tal committee had tried to resolve the matter, including the Cohen committee and the Israeli committee. Members The committee was chaired by former Supreme Court Justice Tzvi Tal, and its members were Cabinet Secretary Isaac Herzog, attorney Jacob Weinroth, Deputy Director General of the Ministry of Defense Haim Israeli, Secretary of the Committee for Yeshivot in Eretz Yisrael Rabbi Asher Tenenboim, former head of the IDF's Manpower Directorate Moshe Nativ, Mayor of Hadera and former Police Major General Israel Sadan, deputy legal advisor to the defense system Rachel Stuvitzky, Mayor of Bnei Brak Rabbi Mordechai Kerlitz, and Deputy Attorney General Yehoshua Shufman. Goals The goals of the committee as they were declared when it was appointed were: # To recommend the appropriate way in the legislation which would entitle the defense minister to provide exemptions or postponements from army service. # The exemption or postponement should be applied without a limitation of the number of yeshiva students, because there was no intention to prevent them from continuing their studies. # To look into the development of possible alternative frameworks for ultra-Orthodox citizens and recommend how the defense minister should act in this regard. Discussed were the possibility of lowering the age of exemption from military service, minimal military training, and relevant training for ultra-Orthodox citizens choosing to integrate into the job market, taking into consideration the possibilities and needs of the IDF. Goals which the committee itself formulated: # The committee saw its main point in finding a proper agreement. # Finding a solution which would be practical and not theoretical. # Creating a way to prevent the alienation and the social distance of the ultra-Orthodox population in Israel from the other Israeli population groups. Tal Law In April 2000 the committee presented its report, which served as a basis for the legislation of the Deferral of Military Service for Yeshiva Students Law, also called the Tal Law on March 7, 2001. On July 23, 2002, the Tal Law in an expanded and updated version was passed in the Knesset by a majority of 51 to 41. It was a temporary law, to be renewed every five years. The law enabled a continuation of the exemptions to yeshiva students subject to certain conditions. Yeshiva students had the option to defer their military service until the age of 22. When they reached that age, they had a ‚Äúdecision year‚Äù in which they could perform a year of vocational training and then decide whether to join the army for a minimum of 16 months followed by annual reserve duty, or to perform a year of unpaid civilian national service if they decided not to continue to study full-time. In addition, the law also provided for the IDF's Orthodox units to be expanded, such as the Orthodox Nahal units. It also recommended that those included in the arrangement be carefully supervised and checked while enforcing the set conditions. The leadership of the yeshivas were required to cooperate on these matters. After the law was passed, the Movement for Quality Government submitted a petition to the High Court, seeking an annulment of the law. The law was also to affect recruitment within the Arab population and was later reported to have been supported by the de facto leader of the Lithuanian and all non-Hasidic Haredim Rabbi Aharon Leib Shteinman.http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/tal-law-2-0-like-the-first-one- but-newer-1.429876 In July 2005, three years after the law took effect, the state admitted in a response to a petition to the Supreme Court that the law had failed to change enlistments for Orthodox Jews as only a few dozen had enlisted in the army as a result of the law. Tzvi Tal responded that the state had done nothing to enforce the law. Also, state representatives announced that propositions planned for enforcement, mainly optional exchange of national service for army service for Orthodox Jews, were not implemented. The minister of justice detailed the omissions of the Tal Law in the letter to the Israeli prime minister. On May 11, 2006, the Supreme Court determined that the Tal Law conflicted with the human dignity of those who serve in the Israeli Army and that the law was implemented in a vague way that did not constitute a \\"worthy purpose\\" that would justify damage to rights of those who serve. However, the court determined that the law should be left untouched for an additional year and a half to see if its application would improve. Two judges held a minority opinion. Judge Mishael Cheshin determined that the law was illegitimate from its foundation, and completely contradicted the values of Israel as a Jewish democratic state, and Judge Asher Grunis said that the Court shouldn't interfere with Knesset decisions unless they damage rights of minorities, whereas in this case the damaged part is the majority, which must take care of its own rights. On July 18, 2007 the Knesset decided to extend the Tal Law for another five years, to August 2012. The Movement for Quality Government petitioned the High Court again. Paradoxically, the petition promoted the law's implementation, as the state tried to prove that it does encourage military or civilian national service. But according to the data submitted to the Court, only a few more ultra-Orthodox men served in the IDF. =2012 extension debate= In January 2012, a mock military camp was erected in Tel Aviv to protest against the Tal Law. On 21 February 2012, the High Court ruled that the Tal Law was unconstitutionalCourt Bans ‚ÄòTal Law‚Äô for Religious Exemptions from IDF. by 6 votes to 3. Outgoing High Court President Dorit Beinisch who supported the ruling wrote in her opinion that ‚Äúapart from a certain improvement in the implementation of the law, one cannot say that the law‚Äôs means achieved their goals, and it seems that certain blocs influence its potential to be fully fulfilled. That being the case, one cannot but determine that the law is unconstitutional... Originally the legislation harboured the hope that the law would launch a social process that without coercion would encourage ultra-Orthodox people to serve in the military or take part in civilian national service. These hopes were dashed.‚Äù In a minority opinion, incoming president Asher Grunis who was among those who opposed the ruling said that ‚Äúit would have been best if the court didn‚Äôt have to deal with the issue; if it had been left in the public sphere beyond the court‚Äôs jurisdiction.‚Äù In his opinion, ‚Äúthe fact that this court dealt again and again with the issue of Haredi military service, without any progress being made as a result of the court‚Äôs ruling, does not add much to the standing of the High Court.‚Äù The court argued that the Law had failed to encourage Haredim to serve in the military or take part in civilian national service (Sherut Leumi) without coercion. Defense Minister Ehud Barak welcomed the ruling; in the past he had expressed the view that only 2,000 to 3,000 Torah experts should be granted exemption. Shas and United Torah Judaism, two Haredi political parties, issued a joint statement rejecting any discussion of changes to the status of the tens of thousands of Haredi yeshiva students who do not serve in the army or perform civilian national service. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the government would formulate a new bill that would guarantee a more equal sharing of the burden by all parts of Israeli society. The system in place since 2002 was regarded as unfair by secular Jews, but there was no obvious alternative. The Movement for Quality Government and Meretz, which had submitted the petition to the High Court, welcomed the decision, as well as many Members of Knesset, among them Kadima's Tzipi Livni, Shaul Mofaz, and Yohanan Plesner, and Likud's Tzipi Hotovely. Plesner was tasked with heading the committee. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he ‚Äúwill formulate a new bill that would guarantee a more equal sharing of the burden of all parts of Israeli society.‚Äù Defense Minister Ehud Barak also stated that a new law has to be passed so that all citizens equally share society's burdens. Interior Minister Eli Yishai said that ‚Äútogether with the Defense and Justice ministries, we will come up with a new law to regulate the status of the yeshiva students, whose contribution to the Jewish people and the State of Israel is obvious to any Jewish believer‚Äù. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman had expressed his objections to extending the Tal Law before the High Court ruling. Dissolution and report On 2 July, Netanyahu dissolved the committee following the resignation of former Yisrael Beiteinu and Habayit Hayehudi representative Jacob Weinroth. An aide to Kadima leader Shaul Mofaz said that there was no need for the prime minister to meet the deputy prime minister to discuss the dissolution as \\"Netanyahu made up his mind and there is no point in discussing it after the fact,\\" following his claim that he would convene a meeting of the leaders of the ruling coalition party members \\"in order to draft a proposal that would garner a majority in the Knesset.\\" The aide then also said that \\"the prime minister knows Kadima's position, and the only reason for calling the meeting is to discuss the framework of the Plesner Committee and its recommendations, including issuing personal sanctions against those who refuse to serve in the IDF.\\" After having carried out the dissolution, an unnamed member of the committee told Ynet that he was \\"very disappointed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to dissolve the committee. We missed a historic opportunity to ease the tensions surrounding one of the most heated disputes in Israeli society.\\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4250413,00.html It was also followed by controversy and a threat by Mofaz to have Kadima leave the coalitionhttp://www.jewishpress.com/uncategorized/bibi-dissolves-tal-law- committee-setting-up-potential-government-rift/2012/07/04/ that it recently joined over the issue itself.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/03/netanhayu-israel- coalition-military-service?newsfeed=true The move was also criticised as done to placate the two Haredi parties, avoid a new election and incur the wrath of the Arab-Israeli public. Two days later, the committee issued its report that called for conscripting the Haredi.http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2012/07/20127551148539228.html Netanyahu's met with Kadima leader Shaul Mofaz and other political leaders in regards to the issue. Likud parliamentary leader Ze'ev Elkin said that the differences between the governing coalition's two main parties was not big and could be bridged as neither party were opposed to the imposition of personal sanctions on whomever would not take part in national military service. Netanyahu also said that if no agreement was reached by 1 August, the law would be applied universally.http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=276322 If no accord is found it was further speculated that the two Haredi parties, United Torah Judaism and Shas, would leave the government and a new election would be called. Upon issue of the report, Plesner said that his \\"committee met for hundreds of hours, held dozens of meetings, heard dozens of experts, performed exhaustive staff work‚Ä¶ in an effort to produce the most comprehensive work on this subject in Israel's history. We have every intention of releasing our findings. [This could] lead to a fundamental change in Israeli society by creating a new social treaty that will see more sectors on Israeli society shoulder the burden of service. We do not wish to trample on any sector's rights. We aim to foster a historic change and create a more cohesive, united society.\\" It also suggested that within four years 80% of yeshiva students who were eligible for conscription would carry out their service. Ynet highlighted the committee's findings as including:http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4250987,00.html #Imposing the principle of universal service on all Israeli citizens. #Imposing individual liability on anyone trying to evade the service. #Offering those serving in the IDF incentives and increased compensation. #Formulating an effective enforcement system against those violating draft directives. #Mandating the draft of ultra-Orthodox men. #Applying the principle of universal service to the Arab sector via National Service opportunities. =Reactions= Shas leader and Interior Minister Eli Yishai said that following the High Court's declaration of the ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù Tal Law he would \\"submit a Tal Law substitute for second and third readings before the end of the Knesset summer session. I will oppose any form of sanctions against Yeshiva students who refuse to be drafted.\\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/244142 Mofaz said Netanyahu should be given more time to resolve the issue.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4251598,00.html Netanyahu's office issued a statement in reaction to the report that read: \\"The draft dodger will not get the same reception as the service member.\\" He also said that a bill to be presented to the Knesset at the end of the month \\"will be hard for Haredim.\\" He also said of the report's issuance that \\"we are moving in the right direction. The haredim must be integrated in military service and both haredim and Arab-Israelis must be integrated in civil service.\\" However, Kadima was reportedly still disappointed over his reaction.http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-07/05/c_131695697.htm Netanyahu also announced that two new teams would be set up, but Mofaz rejected the moves and insisted that the recommendations of the Plesner Committee be adopted, causing a rift in Likud-Kadima relations.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4252162,00.html However, Haaretz read this in saying that \\"hardness is subjective,\\" and that \\"in the end, everything is political. But beyond politics there is also substance. The report...is the most thorough, serious and genuine document ever written on the issue of Haredim who avoid military service, the product of long months of work that began before the committee was even appointed. It does historic justice and ends decades of infuriating and outrageous discrimination between 'blood and blood.' This is undoubtedly Plesner's finest hour. It could also be Netanyahu's.http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/netanyahu-scrambles-to- keep-kadima-from-bolting-coalition.premium-1.448891 An op-ed in the Jerusalem Post also defended Plesner's recommendations in saying that a \\"majority will be drawn out of hiding.\\"http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op- EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=276275 The New York Times asked about the issue as an emblematic of a conflict within Israeli society.

He is also notable as one of the few players of the vibraphone in rock music. He was known by his childhood nickname 'Olly' or 'Ollie' which was simply a corruption of his surname. The Ollie Halsall Archive was established in 1998, with the aim of documenting and promoting his work.The Ollie Halsall Archive  Career  > \\"Ollie may not have been the best guitarist in the world, but he was > certainly among the top two.\\" John Halsey, 1997 Halsall began his musical career in 1964 playing drums with various local bands such as Pete and the Pawnees, the Gunslingers, the Music Students and Rhythm and Blues Incorporated. In 1965 he taught himself to play the vibraphone and was invited to London to join fellow Southport musicians bassist Clive Griffiths and keyboardist 'Professor' Chris Holmes in pop rock outfit Take Five, which became Timebox. in 1967, Halsall took up guitar. They enlisted Mike Patto on vocals and drummer 'Admiral' John Halsey. In 1970, following the departure of Holmes, Timebox evolved into the progressive rock band Patto, featuring Halsall on both guitar and vibraphone. In 1973, Halsall left to join Jon Hiseman's Tempest. After less than a year, he quit and did numerous sessions, including a track for Kevin Ayers which led to a permanent position in Ayers' band the Soporifics. He was briefly considered as a possible replacement for Mick Taylor following his departure from the Rolling Stones. His UK session work included concerts and recordings with the Scaffold, Grimms, Neil Innes, Centipede, Andy Roberts, Michael d'Albuquerque, John Otway, John Cale and Vivian Stanshall. In 1975, Patto staged a brief reunion comprising just three benefit gigs. The reuniting of Halsall and Patto sparked the formation of Boxer during 1975. They release two albums on the Virgin record label before Patto died of lymphoid leukemia in 1979, and one posthumous album following that. Halsall's most commercially successful recording is his work on the album The Rutles (1978), which reached the top 20 in the UK, on which he plays many of the instruments and provides lead and backing vocals ‚Äì most notably on the tracks \\"Doubleback Alley\\", \\"With a Girl Like You\\" and \\"Get Up and Go\\". Eric Idle was cast in his place in the accompanying film and Halsall only featured in a very minor cameo role as Leppo, the fifth Rutle who became lost in Hamburg. During 1976 Halsall had rejoined Ayers with whom he stayed for the next sixteen years. For much of that time he frequented the town of Dei√† in the north of the Spanish island of Mallorca, commuting to Madrid on the mainland to produce and play for numerous Spanish artists, including his final work with pop rock band Radio Futura. In the 1980s he was, together with vocalist Zanna Gregmar, part of a Spanish synth-pop band, called Cinemaspop, created by Spanish producer Julian Ruiz. They released two studio albums ‚Äì 'Cinemaspop' (1983), just a collection of synth-pop covers of classical movie tunes, and 'A Clockwork Orange' (1984) which included some compositions and vocals by Halsall, as well as a bizarre electronic version of the Troggs' Wild Thing. In 1989, he replaced the ill Enrique Sierra in Radio Futura, another Spanish rock band. A finished solo album, produced by Robert Fripp, remains unreleased. Halsall died from a drug- induced heart attack on 29 May 1992 at the age of 43 in Calle de la Amargura, Madrid, Spain. Legacy Halsall has been described as an influence by Alvin Lee of Ten Years After, Bill Nelson of Be-Bop Deluxe, Allan Holdsworth and Cheap Trick's guitarist Rick Nielsen. XTC's Andy Partridge cites Halsall as one of his top three influences, saying \\"He made the guitar sound more like Albert Ayler or John Coltrane, more like a sort of fluid piano player.\\"  Discography  ;Solo * 1972 \\"Ollie & The Blue Traffs\\" (unreleased ‚Äì produced by Robert Fripp) * 1979 \\"Caves\\" * 1980 \\"Abbot's Langley\\" ;with Mike Patto * 1967‚Äì69 The Deram Anthology (as Timebox ‚Äì released 2000) * 1970 Patto (as Patto) * 1971 Hold Your Fire (as Patto) * 1972 Roll Em, Smoke Em, Put Another Line Out (as Patto) * 1973 Monkey's Bum (as Patto) (released 2017) * 1975 Below the Belt (as Boxer) * 1979 Bloodletting (as Boxer) * 2000 Warts and All (as Patto ‚Äì recorded live 1971) ;with Kevin Ayers * 1974 The Confessions of Dr. Dream and Other Stories * 1974 June 1, 1974 (with Nico, John Cale and Brian Eno) * 1975 Sweet Deceiver * 1976 Yes We Have No Ma√±anas (So Get Your Ma√±anas Today) * 1978 Rainbow Takeaway * 1980 That's What You Get Babe * 1983 Diamond Jack and the Queen of Pain * 1984 Dei√†...Vu * 1986 As Close as You Think * 1988 Falling Up * 1992 Still Life with Guitar ;with Cinemaspop * 1983 Cinemaspop * 1984 A Clockwork Orange (La Naranja Mec√°nica) ;Other Albums * 1973 Living in Fear (as Tempest) * 1978 The Rutles (with the Rutles) * 1996 Archaeology (album) (with the Rutles) * 2007 Under the Blossom (Tempest Anthology)  References   External links  *The Ollie Halsall Archive  Category:1949 births Category:1992 deaths Category:English rock guitarists Category:English male guitarists Category:English session musicians Category:Lead guitarists Category:The Rutles members Category:People from Southport Category:Deaths by heroin overdose Category:20th-century English musicians Category:20th-century guitarists Category:Tempest (UK band) members Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Ollie Halsall"},{"id":"3018646","text":"Clonroche ()A.

It was originally constructed in the late 1930s, with more homes being added after World War II and in recent years. In 2003, the local council-owned pre-war homes on the estate underwent an expansive home-improvement scheme funded by the council, which saw them all fitted with double-glazing and central heating, as well as maintenance and modernisation work to both the interior and exterior of the buildings. It is the third largest single housing estate in Wales behind Gurnos, Merthyr Tydfil, the second largest and Caia Park in Wrexham, which is the largest with nearly 12,000 inhabitants. The estate is located away from the main spread of the city of Bangor, being separated by Bangor Mountain. The name of the estate is often shortened to a simpler \\"Maes-G\\" in casual use, by residents of both the estate and the city. Maesgeirchen was named after the farm Maes-y-geirchen which was situated near Queens Avenue. Penrhyn Avenue, Maesgeirchen Path between the Maesgeirchen Housing Estate and the Llandegai Industrial Estate The estate has only one road entrance and exit, via \\"Maes-G Hill\\" (official road name: Penrhyn Avenue), which gives the residents of Maesgeirchen a strong sense of community. There are also numerous un-made footpaths leading to and from the estate; one called L√¥n Felin Esgob (meaning \\"Bishop's mill lane\\") is an old highway with some of the paving still in place. North it goes over Bangor Mountain towards the city and south it goes through the nearby Llandegai industrial estate. Recently there have been major environmental works throughout the river area including walkways, paths, and picnic areas designed for use by pedestrians and wheelchair users. The estate also boasts its own residents' organisation and 'communities first' division which is run by locals. In 2002 the estate was fitted with CCTV which covers the majority of streets. It has a social club, a community centre (Ty Cegin, built with National Lottery funding as a Healthy Living Centre and later taken over by the local Communities First Partnership following cessation of five years of lottery funding), a newsagent, a post office, a hairdresser, a chip shop, a Chinese take-away, a laundrette, a church and a primary school named Ysgol Glan Cegin. Bus services into the estate until 2006 were provided exclusively by Arriva Buses Wales, but now there is competition from Padarn Bus following a request by residents unhappy with Arriva's service. Maesgeirchen is designated a 'Communities First' area by the Welsh Assembly Government.

Biography Ann attended the Bradford Academy and during a revival there read Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education by Hannah More, which led her to \\"seek a life of 'usefulness'\\". Born in Bradford, Massachusetts, she was a teacher from graduation until marriage. Her father, John Hasseltine, was a deacon at the church that hosted the gathering that, in 1810, founded the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and, according to Ann's sister Ann, the family first met her husband Adoniram Judson at that time. She married Adoniram in 1812, and two weeks later they embarked on their mission trip to India. The following year, they moved on to Burma.S. W. Williams, ed., Queenly Women: Crowned and Uncrowned (Cincinnati: Cranson and Stowe, 1885), 59‚Äì60. She had three pregnancies. The first ended in a miscarriage while moving from India to Burma; their son Roger was born in 1815 and died at eight months of age, and their third child, Maria, lived for only six months after her mother's death.S. W. Williams, ed., Queenly Women: Crowned and Uncrowned (Cincinnati: Cranson and Stowe, 1885), 68. While in Burma, the couple's first undertaking was to acquire the language of the locals. Missionary efforts followed, with the first local converting to Christianity in 1819.S. W. Williams, ed., Queenly Women: Crowned and Uncrowned (Cincinnati: Cranson and Stowe, 1885), 60. Due to liver problems, Ann returned to the United States briefly in 1822‚Äì23. Nancy visits Adoniram in prison During the first Anglo- Burmese war (1824‚Äì26), her husband was imprisoned for 17 months under suspicion of being an English spy, and Ann moved into a shack outside the prison gates so as to support her husband. She lobbied vigorously for months to convince the authorities to release her husband and his fellow prisoners, but her efforts were unsuccessful. She also sent food and sleeping mats to the prisoners to help their time in prison to be more bearable.S. W. Williams, ed., Queenly Women: Crowned and Uncrowned (Cincinnati: Cranson and Stowe, 1885), 63. During this time, Ann wrote stories of life on the mission field and the struggles she faced. She wrote tragic descriptions of child marriages, female infanticide, and the trials of the Burmese women who had no rights except for the ones their husbands gave them. Ann's health was fragile by the time her husband was released. Her efforts to be near him when he was moved to a new location, all while she was nursing a newborn child, had involved strenuous travel and living conditions that may have contributed to her illness.S. W. Williams, ed., Queenly Women: Crowned and Uncrowned (Cincinnati: Cranson and Stowe, 1885), 66‚Äì67. After her husband's release they both remained in Burma to continue their work. Ann died at Amherst, Lower Burma, of smallpox in 1826. Hopia tree near the grave of Ann Hasseltine Judson circa 1913 She wrote a catechism in Burmese, and translated the books of Daniel and Jonah into Burmese. She was the first Protestant to translate any of the scriptures into Thai when in 1819 she translated the Gospel of Matthew. Her letters home were published in periodicals such as The American Baptist Magazine and republished after her death as devotional writings, making both her and Adoniram celebrities in America.

Its maximum depth is about 180 m (590 ft; 98 fathoms), making it the deepest point in the English Channel. Etymology It is most probable the feature was named after Captain Thomas Hurd RN (1747‚Äì1823), by Admiral Martin White. Description The feature has approximate dimensions of length of ; width of between and and maximum depth of . It terminates abruptly at the western end. Outside of the deep the seafloor is typically flat with a depth range of to . It is the deepest point on the English channel. Late Quaternary origin The underwater valley system found on the floor of the eastern English Channel formed from a catastrophic flood which was caused by a breaching of a rock dam at the Strait of Dover, which released a huge proglacial lake in the southern North Sea basin. The flood scoured the former river systems to form Hurd's Deep in late Quaternary times. =Pleistocene glacial refugium= During the ice ages, when the sea level dropped, most of the English Channel was dry land. Hurd's Deep likely remained as a sea. During the Pleistocene it is thought to have been a glacial refugium.
