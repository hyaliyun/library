Life Koga was born in Sacramento, California, on August 10, 1920, and had been an avid photographer since she was a child. She concentrated on social work, however, and received a BA in 1942 from the University of California at Berkeley and a Master's degree in 1947 from the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration. During World War II she was incarcerated in the internment camp at Tule Lake for a year because of her Japanese ethnicity. From 1947 to 1969, she worked in the field of social work in Chicago, starting out as a case worker and eventually teaching as an Assistant Professor for Field Work at the University of Chicago, School of Social Service Administration, 1960‚Äì1969. Koga then concentrated on photography, studied at the IIT Institute of Design and received a MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1973. She then went on to teach photography at Columbia College Chicago for seven years. Mary Koga died in Chicago on June 8, 2001. Photography Koga's photographic work consists mainly of three distinct series. The Floral Forms series was begun in 1972 and went on into the 1990s. Done in both color as well as black and white, the images are delicate close-ups of mostly single flower heads, artfully arranged in the studio with tightly controlled lighting. On occasion, she over exposed and used multiple exposure to emphasise the structure and/or color. Comparison has been made with the flower paintings of Georgia O'Keeffe. In parallel, between 1972 and 1980, Koga went to rural Alberta to work on the series The Hutterites. Her images show the members of the isolated religious community, who in many cases have been photographed for the first time, with great openness, sympathy and a touch of humor. While highly constructed and posed, her portraits capture people who are happy within their surroundings, yet emphasising how different and alien they are within modern society. The chaste lifestyle is not only palpable from the quaint, old fashioned dress the Hutterites wear but also in interiors and still life images of sober displays of kettles or bread. Koga's third big project is closely linked to both, her ethnicity and her former concern with social work. She concentrated on the elderly first generation of Japanese immigrants, her parents' generation, in black and white as well as color photos. Done over several decades from the 1970s to the 1990s, the Portrait of the Issei in Illinois series is much more relaxed than the Hutterite portraits. Koga was obviously at ease with these people, and documented their twilight years at the day care facility and the Senior Citizens Work Center of the Japanese American Service Committee (JASC) and at Heiwa Terrace, a Japanese American senior residence, both located in Chicago.

The song tells of the common struggles that a union organizer faces while starting a new labor union. Creation \\"Talking Union\\" was written in 1941, while the Almanac Singers were working to organize Congress of Industrial Organizations unions, in which Henry Ford was being divested in. The song was written accidentally. Millard Lampell and Lee Hays were in the process of creating new verses for the song \\"Talking Dust Bowl Blues\\" by Woody Guthrie,in which he taught the Almanac Singers the song \\"Old Talking Blues\\". another member of the Almanac Singers. Many of the verses they wrote were nonsensical, but after an hour, Lampell and Hays saw that they had created the beginnings of a new song. Yet another Almanac Singers Pete Seeger, who already had written a verse for the song, wrote an upbeat ending (Unrhymed) to complete the song. Lyrics and themes The lyrics of \\"Talking Union\\" describe the process of starting a union, and common roadblocks and issues that an organizer faces with ways to get around them. The song is both informative and humorous. It was designed as a \\"magnetic\\" song, used to encourage people to join labor unions. Critics have described the lyrical themes of the song as broadly non-interventionist. The lyrics start out with a list of the positive things that come with starting a union at one's workplace: increased pay, decreased hours on the job, and the ability to take time off work to \\"take your kids to the seashore\\". The song then describes the steps that a person would need to go through to start a union. Workers need to get the word out that the shop is unionizing through distributing handbills and holding meetings. The lyrics then move to common issues that a person who starts a union will face, such as starvation wages, picket lines, the protest demonstrations where the police and the national guard break up the masses and the bosses calling the union workers nasty labels and names. The song ends with the promise, that in those industrial cities, that if nothing breaks one up, that \\"You will win\\" (But take it easy, but take it) if you just stick together with the union.

Turkish authorities claim that Drug trafficking has provided substantial revenue for illegal groups such as the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK),mfa.gov.tr, Turkey's Efforts Against The Drug Problem particularly through marijuana cultivation in south-eastern Turkey,Today's Zaman, 24 September 2012, PKK runs major illegal drug trade in Turkey's Southeast and the 1996 Susurluk scandal showed substantial involvement in drug trafficking on the part of the Turkish deep state. The French Connection heroin trade in the 1960s and 70s was based on poppies grown in Turkey (poppies are a traditional crop in Turkey, with poppy seed used for food and animal fodder as well as for making opium). Turkish penalties for possession, use and trafficking of illegal drugs are labelled \\"particularly strict\\" by the US Embassy in Ankara.turkey.usembassy.gov, Penalties for Drug Offenses Opium production The city of Afyonkarahisar (afyon \\"poppy, opium\\", kara \\"black\\", hisar \\"fortress\\") and its Afyonkarahisar Province was a traditional centre of poppy cultivation. Poppies are a traditional crop in Turkey, with poppy seed used for food and animal fodder as well as for making opium. Already in the early nineteenth century, Turkish opium was being shipped to England and China.PBS, Opium throughout history Turkey signed the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 1961, ratifying it in 1967. It was classed as a \\"traditional opium producing country\\" under the Convention.Jorrit Kamminga, The Political History of Turkey‚Äôs Opium Licensing System for the Production of Medicines: Lessons for Afghanistan, SENLIS Council, undated In the 1960s, the French Connection heroin trade was based on poppies grown in Turkey, and Turkey was one of the main opium-producing countries. Under international pressure, Turkey reduced the number of provinces where poppies could be grown from 1967 to 1972, before introducing a total ban. This was overturned in 1974, with the introduction of a system for licensed poppy production and state purchasing of poppies for the legal production of poppy-based medicines.Ceylan Yeƒüinsu, Hurriyet, 21 November 2008, A flower caught in drug war crossfire The system appears to have been effective: from 1974 to 2000 no seizures of illegal opium derived from Turkish poppies were reported.UNODC, Turkey programme Trans- shipment CIA map of heroin flows in Asia, 2007. The European leg, nicknamed \\"the Balkan route\\", passes through Turkey. Due to its strategic geographical location Turkey is a significant trans-shipment point. For example, it is a major route for heroin from Afghanistan to Europe;Hurriyet Daily News, 12 August 2010, Seizure of illegal drugs in Turkey on the rise opium production in Afghanistan has been the highest in the world since 1992 (except for the year 2001). According to Interpol, \\"Turkey is a major staging area and transportation route for heroin destined for European markets.\\", and is the \\"anchor point\\" for the Balkan Route. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimated the 1997 volume of the Turkish heroin traffic at 4‚Äì6 tons per month. In 1992/3 the Turkish Navy intercepted two smuggling vessels, in the Kƒ±smetim-1 incident (3 tons of morphine base) and Lucky-S incident (11 tons of marijuana, 2.5 tons of morphine base). Notable Turkish traffickers include H√ºseyin Bayba≈üin (serving life in the Netherlands for trafficking). =Susurluk scandal= The point of contention of the Susurluk gangs was the European leg of the heroin transportation route, which passes through Turkey. One fifth of the black money is tapped by the gangs as \\"commission\\"; a market on the order of $80 billion (1997). According to Doƒüu Perin√ßek, the lure of heroin proved irresistible to the state, which suffered a $40‚Äì50 billion loss in trade with Iraq due to the U.N. embargo and the Gulf War. The biggest drug cartel was led by Kurdish drug trafficker H√ºseyin Bayba≈üin. Bayba≈üin said the most important state official involved in controlling the heroin trade was ≈û√ºkr√º Balcƒ±, who was Istanbul Chief of Police 1979 to 1983. According to the Independent, the U.K. National Crime Squad had estimated that 90% of the heroin in the United Kingdom was under their control until 2002, when it had a bloody falling-out with its partners in the PKK. He settled in the U.K. after becoming an informer for the HM Customs and Excise office to reveal what he knew, as someone who traveled with a diplomatic passport, about the involvement in heroin trafficking of senior Turkish politicians and officials. Another narcotic that was trafficked in significant quantity was Captagon. A notable trafficker was a Turkish businessman Mehmet Ali Yaprak of Gaziantep. Yaprak was ostensibly a businessman with a television channel (Yaprak TV), a radio station, and a tourism company (Hidayet Turizm). However, he also led a feared gang that smuggled Captagon over Syria and Saudi Arabia, according to the Mƒ∞T report. His tourism company facilitated the trafficking. The report says that Yaprak donated 500 billion LiraThe Turkish lira was experiencing hyperinflation at the time, so it is difficult to translate into foreign currency. The donation was made towards the elections on 24 December 1995, when the interbank rate was 57,700 Lira/$US. At the beginning of the same year, the parity was 38,900 Lira/$US. The contribution is therefore on the order of $8.7 million to $13m. to support Aƒüar's DYP campaign. Upon learning of Yaprak's wealth, √áatlƒ± and a team of 6‚Äì7 dressed in police uniform kidnapped Yaprak on 25 May 1996 and took him to a house in Siverek belonging to the Bucak clan. The kidnapping, motivated by the desire to know where the Captagon was coming from and cut Topal out of the loop, was directed by police in Ankara. Yaprak paid 10 million DM in ransom, however √áatlƒ± and his fellow kidnappers received only a small portion of this. When they found out that they had been cheated, they fell out with their overlords in Ankara. They then kidnapped Yaprak a second time and interrogated him, sending one copy of the interrogation tape to Bucak and another to Eym√ºr through Mƒ∞T agent M√ºfit Sement. Leveraging the tapes, √áatlƒ± worked out an agreement with Ankara. After Topal's capture, his friend Haluk Koral called Eym√ºr for help. Topal had also been kidnapped by police chief ƒ∞brahim ≈ûahin priorly. Yaprak was convicted in 1997 for involvement in the assassination of Gaziantep Bar lawyer Burhan Veli Torun, and released due to an amnesty law (). In 2002, he was re-imprisoned after being caught with 5 million pills of Captagon. He died in prison, January 2004. A market in the southeast town of Lice was destroyed by fire. Deputy Fikri Saƒülar alleged that Lice was a center of drug processing, and that the factory was moved to Elazƒ±ƒü. Saƒülar also said that the Turkish backing for the 1995 Azeri coup d'√©tat attempt was over control of the shipment route from Afghanistan.

In 1920 he moved to Berlin and began working as an art director and production designer with some of the best-known German directors of the time: Ernst Lubitsch (Sumurun, The Loves of Pharaoh), Robert Wiene (I.N.R.I.) and Karl Grune (Arabella). From the 1926 Secrets of a Soul he developed a close and continuous partnership with Georg Wilhelm Pabst. Metzner was art director for seven major Pabst films from 1926 to 1933, notably designing the production of Kameradschaft (1931), for which Metzner constructed realistic mining tunnels in the studio.Film Architecture and the Transnational Imagination: Set Design in 1930s ...by Tim Bergfelder, Sue Harris, Sarah Street, page 158 In 1927 Metzner began to direct films himself.

His most important work is probably the 1928 short film Polizeibericht √úberfall (\\"Police Report: Hold-Up\\", known in English as \\"Accident\\"). Metzner both wrote and directed this landmark of the New Objectivity movement in film, banned by authorities as \\"brutalizing and demoralizing.\\" As a Hungarian Jew, in 1933 Metzner emigrated from Germany to France and then to England, where he reunited with Austrian director Friedrich Feher.

George Washington Ochs-Oakes (George Oakes), founder of Current History Magazine (and brother of New York Times founder Adolph Ochs), attended the unveiling. In a letter dated December 13, 1929, Ochs-Oakes congratulates Wickham \\"on the enthusiasm with which your medal was received at Princeton. I was down there the other night and everybody admired it very much.\\" Following the commemoration, Wickham sent several plaster replicas of the medallion to Whig Society members who attended Princeton during Wilson's tenure as professor, and president of the University. These recipients include: George S. Cunningham, of Mission Hospital, Dumaguete, Philippine Islands; Zeph. Chas. Felt (graduated Princeton 1879), a real estate and loan magnate in Denver, CO; Sumner Walters (graduated 1919), of Church of the Redeemer, St. Louis, MO; Dr. Jose Romero (had Wilson as a professor in 1892 and 1895) of Washington, DC; John L. Porter, Pittsburgh businessman, philanthropist and arts advocate; H.C. Adler, Manager of the Chattanooga Times. In a letter dated Jan. 20, 1930, poet Rev. Seth Russell Downie, chaplain of the Pennsylvania State Fireman's Association, writes an especially prosaic letter to Wickham, about finding the \\"wee hangerhook\\" of the medallion \\"too much below rim to admit of use over nail or hook. But, my good sir, this merely gave me chance to use a nifty orange and black ribbonbow to neatly carry out the atmosphere of Old Nassau 'gainst the nooky spot on the homey wall of the living room.\\" In closing, Rev. Downie praises Woodrow Wilson in heroic fashion: \\"At this very time, our beloved idealist will command the world's acknowledgement as one who clearly envisaged the great society of Nations among whom Justice should reign & peace prevail. In every corner of the earth ‚Äî our idol will be blessed. The excoriated will be exalted. That will be glory enough for us ‚Äî My dear sir ‚Äî glory and good news.\\" 1929 was a busy year for Wickham, as he was also commissioned by the American Geographical Society for a medallion commemorating aviator and Antarctic explorer Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd. Six years later, in 1935, Wickham sent the original model of this medallion to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Inspired by words as well as images, Wickham's poem, \\"A Bookplate Speaks,\\" originally published in the New York Times, anthropomorphizes steel engraving printmaking, and showcases the artist's facility with language: ::Although begot of polished, graven steel, ::Entombed within thy lines do I conceal ::A soul; 'twere better were I ruby red, ::Perhaps, instead of black, so dead, ::For then, his every heartbeat I might feel ::And breathe and speak and tell the ardent zeal ::With which he studied, mastered every line ::Embodied in my quaint, beloved design. ::Thus now you well might look and long review ::Your bookplate; for the master's hand that drew ::This something which is me, for you to hold ::He, too, regarded me far more than gold ::Search long and well for him whose spirit lies ::Within my lines, in raven black disguise.  Personal life  Wickham was married twice, first to Dorothy Callan (1908-1948; widowed), with whom he fathered two children, Vincent Jr. (1938-2000), Sally (1943‚Äî); and Vivian Mallett Roberge (1900-1984). A man of adventure, Wickham and his first wife, Dorothy Callan, took excursions by steamship to Peru, Cuba, and Bermuda. They also were members of the Old White Art Colony at White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, where they attended a charity dinner dance on August 23, 1939. A lifelong learner, Wickham earned a Bachelor of Arts from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Department of Education, in 1957, at age 63. Retiring to New London, New Hampshire, Wickham studied and wrote poetry, and continued teaching art. His reputation preceded him, and even in retirement he was commissioned to design emblems, including the New London Town Seal. The Vincent Schofield Wickham Collection, curated by Massachusetts College of Art and Design's Archives and Special Collections Department, includes several of Wickham's watercolors, as well as historical photographs from his tenure at the New York Times.

There was a prolonged dispute before his position was recognized. After he fell out of favor with King Peter of Castile he was removed from office and murdered. Early years Juan N√∫√±ez de Prado was a knight of the Order of Calatrava. He and other knights rose against the Master Garci L√≥pez de Padilla, who was discredited because of his failure in his fight against the Taifa of Ja√©n, and his poor performance in an expedition against the Muslims of the Emirate of Granada, where he was supposed to have fled from the battlefield. The rebellious knights made Villareal, the future Ciudad Real, their stronghold, since some of them were from that town. They defeated the Master Garci L√≥pez de Padilla at the Battle of Malas Tardes. In 1325 Alfonso XI of Castile granted the wishes of the rebel knights and friars, who came to the court at Valladolid to indict the master on four counts. The first was dereliction of the strongholds that the master Garci had left without supplies and that had been lost, including those of Alcaudete, Locub√≠n, Susa√±a, Chist and Mathet. The second was that having fled the fighting during the battle of Baena he had left the friars who accompanied him. The third was the authoritarianism and cruelty of the master in his treatment of his friars. Fourth was his attacks on places and vassals of the Crown, particularly in Villarreal. The master was summoned to the royal court, but fled to Alca√±iz, headquarters of the Aragonese dominions of the Order of Calatrava. Master of Calatrava Since Garci L√≥pez de Padilla had taken flight, Alfonso XI ordered the friars opposing him to organize an irregular chapter that elected Juan N√∫√±ez de Prado as the new master. The schism was prolonged, as the deposed master tried to assert his rights before the general chapter of the Cistercians. That order, through the Abbots of Monsalud and of Morimond, recognized the legitimacy of his position and restored to him in possession of the mastership. But, with the backing of the Castilian king and most of the knights of the order for Juan N√∫√±ez de Prado, who held the Calatrava villas and castles, Garc√≠a L√≥pez de Padilla resigned from the mastership in 1329 in exchange for continuing to have the service of ten knights and lifetime enjoyment of a few villas and castles held by the order in the kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, with their income, and the Zorita and El Collado sections. However, Juan N√∫√±ez de Prado broke some of the terms of the agreement. Don Garcia returned to claim his rights with support from the Aragonese monarchy, and continued to claim the mastership of Calatrava until his death in 1336. This circumstance, and the continued support of the Crown of Aragon extended the schism until an agreement was reached in August 1348 before the Cortes in Zaragoza in exchange for granting greater rights and greater autonomy to the Aragonese sections of the order. Deposition and death During the reign of Peter of Castile (r. 1350‚Äì1369), the son and successor of Alfonso XI, Juan N√∫√±ez de Prado opposed the king's policies. He was forced to take refuge in the fortress of Calatrava la Nueva, and then fled to Alca√±iz. In 1355 he returned to the Master's residence at Almagro, Ciudad Real. Peter of Castile ordered Juan de la Cerda to arrest him there. The master did not resist, although he had enough men to put up a fight. He was replaced as Master by Diego Garc√≠a de Padilla, brother of the king's mistress, Mar√≠a de Padilla. The new master sent Juan Nunez to Maqueda Castle, where he was murdered by the squire Diego L√≥pez de Porras. Meanwhile, the nephew of N√∫√±ez de Prado, Pedro Est√©banez Carpinteyro, proclaimed himself Master in the Sevillian city of Osuna.

Also notable is that their two albums featured some well- known backing musicians including members of the Band.Sarlin, Bob, album review, Crawdaddy magazine, July 1973 After Borderline broke up in 1974, the Gershen brothers pursued various projects while Rooney became a successful producer in Nashville, working with artists including Iris DeMent, Nanci Griffith and John Prine. Origins In 1968, the Gershen brothers, who were raised in New Jersey, formed a rock band in New York City called the Montgomeries. Another founding member of this band was Tony Brown who would later appear on Bob Dylan's album \\"Blood on the Tracks.\\" In 1969, the Montgomeries relocated to Woodstock, where they crossed paths with other recently transplanted musicians including Van Morrison, who often played gigs with them.Heylin, Clinton, Can You Feel the Silence? Van Morrison, A New Biography, Chicago Review Press, 2003, pp. 217-218 Morrison, in fact, became a good friend of the Montgomeries and the band that would become Borderline during the early days in Woodstock. After the Montgomeries broke up, Jon Gershen met Rooney, a veteran of the Boston folk music scene who had moved to Woodstock in 1971. Rooney was at the time working as business manager at Bearsville Studios, which was built by Albert Grossman, who managed Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin and the Band. Guitarists Rooney and Gershen got together for some informal music-making sessions and discovered they had a unique sound that should be pursued further. Soon after, they invited David Gershen ‚Äì who specialized in folk and country music ‚Äì to join in.Hagiwara, Kenta, liner notes to Japanese reissue of \\"Sweet Dreams and Quiet Desires,\\" EMI Music Japan, 2000, TOCP-53124 The trio, still unnamed, began seriously working together in the fall of 1971. They landed a record contract with United Artists Records, which had once expressed interest in the Montgomeries. They eventually chose the name Borderline to reflect the way their different styles existed in close proximity to each other. First album Borderline began recording its first album in April 1972, helped by a stellar cast of musicians that lived in and around Woodstock. Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson, keyboardists in the Band, dropped in for a few tunes (they were later credited under pseudonyms, following Grossman's wishes).\\"Borderline: Sweet Dreams and Quiet Desires,\\" the Band's unofficial website, http://theband.hiof.no/albums/borderline.html Other musicians included former Mothers Of Invention drummer Billy Mundi, fiddle player Vassar Clements, saxophonist David Sanborn, bassist Jim Colegrove and longtime Neil Young sideman Ben Keith on pedal steel guitar and dobro. John Simon, who produced the band's first two albums, played piano on several tracks. The resulting album, \\"Sweet Dreams and Quiet Desires,\\" was released on UA's Avalanche label in April 1973. In addition to the U.S. pressing, editions of the record were manufactured and sold in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and Australia. The press materials promoting the album featured a blurb of approval by Van Morrison.Avalanche/United Artists promotional material, September 1973 The album was well-received critically but did not sell in great numbers. The 11 tracks included traditional bluegrass songs like \\"Handsome Molly\\" and \\"Clinch Mountain,\\" plus originals including Jon Gershen's jazzy \\"Dragonfly\\" and David Gershen's country/rock tune \\"The Distance.\\" Lead vocals were distributed more or less evenly by all three members. Avalanche/UA also issued a single from \\"Sweet Dreams\\" in the United States and the UK featuring two songs by David Gershen. The \\"A\\" side of the 45 was \\"Don't Know Where I'm Going,\\" and the \\"B\\" side was \\"Marble Eyes.\\" Second album The group began working on its ill- fated second album in August 1973. This time around, they chose to record at CRS Studios in Bridgeport, Connecticut, owned by award-winning producer Paul Leka. Once again, they were backed by a well-known assemblage of musicians, including guitarist Amos Garrett, bassist Will Lee, Ben Keith, David Sanborn and drummer Chris Parker. Jon Gershen, who produced, even brought in a New York City horn section of Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker and Barry Rogers. The album, originally titled simply \\"Borderline\\" but later changed to \\"The Second Album,\\" was scheduled for release in January 1974. One of the album's more notable tracks was the energetic opener, Dave Gershen's \\"Sonny Boy,\\" a catchy horn-driven tune which had tentatively been chosen as the single. As with the first album, all three band members contributed original songs and shared lead vocals. Unfortunately for the band, a personnel change within UA Records around this time ended up scuttling the planned release of \\"The Second Album.\\" Marchese, Joe, article in theseconddisc.com, Feb. 15, 2013, http://theseconddisc.com/2013/02/15/reviews-three-from-real-gone-music-pozo- seco-kenny-odell-and-borderline/ As Jon Gershen has explained, the executive who signed Borderline to UA, who was also the band's greatest proponent at the label, unexpectedly left the company. His replacement ended up putting a hold on all the projects that were not yet released. The result was that \\"The Second Album\\" was shelved. It would not become available until long after the band had broken up. Shortly after UA pulled the plug, Borderline decided to call it quits. The story of the never-released second album had a happy ending of sorts when EMI Japan released it on CD in 2001 (in the mid-1980s, EMI acquired the entire UA Records catalog). The original master tapes were thought to be lost, and so the CD was sourced from an old acetate. This release occurred one year after EMI Japan issued Borderline's first album on CD. The 2000 release of \\"Sweet Dreams and Quiet Desires\\" in Japan marked the first time Borderline's music had been made available on CD. The packaging featured extensive liner notes by critic Kenta Hagiwara. The Japanese releases, though somewhat hard to find, suggested that Borderline was finally gaining some recognition as a historically important part of the \\"Woodstock music scene\\" of the early 1970s. U.S. releases of CDs In January 2013, Real Gone Music (distributed by Sony Music Entertainment) released the group's two albums (on one disc), representing the first time the trio's music had been released on CD in the United States. The sound quality was a step up from the Japanese reissues, with Real Gone using the original two-track master tapes for both albums finally located by EMI after a recent reorganization of its archives. The packaging included new liner notes by Richie Unterberger and rare photos supplied by Jon Gershen. Rooney, the Gershen brothers after Borderline After Borderline broke up, Rooney turned his attention to recording a solo album and participating in releases by the Woodstock Mountains Review. He then moved to Nashville where he worked with legendary producer and songwriter \\"Cowboy\\" Jack Clement for many years at his studio Jack's Tracks. Rooney went on to make a name for himself as a successful producer in his own right,allmusic.com, artist biography, http://www.allmusic.com/artist/borderline-mn0000088977 winning a Grammy Award in 1993 for Nanci Griffith's album Other Voices, Other Rooms. Dave Gershen moved to Colorado and pursued a solo career, occasionally performing and recording. Jon Gershen moved to Western Massachusetts and established a music publishing company while continuing to write and record. The Gershen brothers reunited in 2003 for the album \\"Faded Glory,\\" released on Boardinghouse Records under the name of \\"Dave Gershen & Jon Gershen.\\" Some work has been done on a follow-up to \\"Faded Glory,\\" but the project remains unfinished. In addition to working with his brother, Jon Gershen has produced a number of albums for other recording artists.

The LTK data the program stewards consists of observations of sea ice, weather, wildlife and comes in many forms such as written interview transcripts, audio or video tapes and files, photographs, artwork, illustrations and maps. Housed at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado Boulder Cooperative Institute for Research and Environmental Sciences (CIRES), ELOKA is a National Science Foundation (NSF) Arctic Observing Network (AON) research program that came out of the 2007-2008 International Polar Year (IPY).  Data Sets  ELOKA data and information resources represent international and interdisciplinary collaboration between the physical and social sciences; between researcher(s) and communities and addresses cultural sensitivity issues that are not usually seen in standard physical science data management norms, but are critically important when administering documented forms of LTK and community-based monitoring. A variety of methods and tools are used on each data set as each project has different needs in presenting their data.  History and philosophy  Established in 2006 under an initial National Science Foundation (NSF) exploratory grant to address the need for an effective and appropriate system for recording, preserving and sharing data and information collected in Indigenous Arctic communities, ELOKA developed partnerships and defined the broad needs of the system defined as a set of people, communities, and technological components sharing information and working together to achieve particular goals. Its philosophy is \\"‚ÄúLTK and scientific expertise are complementary and reinforcing ways of understanding the Arctic system. Collecting, documenting, preserving, supporting, and sharing knowledge is a cooperative endeavor, and ELOKA is dedicated to fostering understanding and shared knowledge between Arctic residents, scientists, educators, policy makers, and the general public. ELOKA operates on the principle that all ways of knowing should be treated ethically, and intellectual property rights should be respected.‚Äù In 2009 NSIDC was awarded two more NSF awards to established an operational ELOKA data management and networking system for community-based research that keeps control of data in the hands of community data providers, while still allowing for broad searches and sharing of information. Building on the accomplishments of the first and second phases of ELOKA, the third phase of the program is to make it a sustained program at NSIDC and sustained presence in the Arctic research landscape. The critical next challenge is to sustain and evolve the established system to routinely support northern communities, NSF, and other investigators conducting community-based research to ensure these unique data are well preserved and readily useful by communities, researchers, service providers, decision makers, and others to help ELOKA support those meeting diverse urgent environmental and social challenges. The third phase also includes the addition of a six-member Advisory Committee of researchers and Indigenous leaders. The Committee is working with the ELOKA team to refine goals and objectives, and priorities.  International and Domestic Collaborations  ELOKA values building sustainable relationships with northern communities and researchers and understands that those relationships can only be built on a foundation of trust. Through an ongoing outreach program ELOKA has established a pan-Arctic network of community researchers and data practitioners that have greatly increased the recognition of the value and techniques of sound community data management. ELOKA has established a suite of technology and services to support, arc hive and provide access to diverse data including community-based meteorological data, quantitative and qualitative observations of sea ice from local experts, hand drawn maps and detailed interviews of Inuit hunters and Elders, controlled access to environmental and species observations of the Bering Sea region, oral histories from Siberia, and more. ELOKA collaborates with many domestic and international organizations engaged in addressing LTK and community-based monitoring data management issues. Together, they work to build a community of practice that facilitates international knowledge exchange, development of resources, and collaboration focused on local communities and stewardship of their data, information, and knowledge. ELOKA continues to seek new partners and the collaborative network continues to grow.

It was described by the art historian Sir Roy Strong as \\"a masterpiece of early Tudor jeweller's art\\", and its form has been compared to the crown of the Holy Roman Empire. Description Its date of manufacture is unknown, but Henry VII or his son and successor Henry VIII probably commissioned the crown, first documented in writing in a 1521 inventory of Henry VIII's jewels, naming the crown as \\"the king's crown of gold\\". More elaborate than its medieval predecessor, it originally had two arches, five crosses patt√©e and five fleurs-de-lis, and was decorated with emeralds, sapphires, rubies, pearls, diamonds and, at one time, the Black Prince's Ruby (a large spinel). The centre petals of the fleurs-de- lis had images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and St George, in an effort by Henry VIII to secure his position as head of the new Church of England. The crown was mentioned again in 1532, 1550, 1574 and 1597. Fate After the death of Elizabeth I and the end of the Tudor dynasty, the Stuarts came to power in England. Both James I and Charles I are known to have worn the crown. Following the abolition of the monarchy and the execution of Charles I in 1649, the Tudor Crown was broken up and its valuable components sold for ¬£1,100. According to an inventory drawn up for the sale of the king's goods, it weighed . Use in heraldry From 1902 to 1953, a stylised image of the Tudor Crown was used in coats of arms, badges, logos and various other insignia throughout the Commonwealth realms to symbolise the Crown and the monarch's royal authority. Replica In 2012, a replica of the crown, based on research by Historic Royal Palaces, was made by the retired royal jeweller Harry Collins, using authentic Tudor metalworking techniques and 344 pearls and gemstones.

As an artist, he is best known for his drawings, collages, performances and films exploring the ongoing repercussions of the western neocolonialism and imperialism within the contemporary context of globalisation. LucFosther Diop Early life and career LucFosther Diop was born in 1980 in Douala. After spending his young age having a very difficult relationship specially with his father, at the age of 17, he moved from the family house in Douala to his uncle's place in Bafoussam (the West Region of Cameroon) where he got his diploma of secondary studies in 2000. Then, went to study fine arts in Yaound√© where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the Yaounde 1 University in 2003. After obtaining a grant from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2009, he studied for two years at the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He is the first artist to benefit from a residency grant at ArtBakery (Bonendale, Douala, Cameroon) in 2003, at the MTN Cameroon Foundation (Douala) in 2007 and a digital arts research and production Unesco-Aschberg award for French Africa in 2013. Diop exhibited his work during the 3rd OK Video International Festival, National Gallery of Indonesia in Jakarta (2007), World One Minute Video, Today Art Museum in Beijing (2008), 2nd Thessaloniki Biennial (2009), International Symposium on Electronic Arts (ISEA) 2010, PHotoEspa√±a (2011), the Havana biennial (2012) and the 18th International Contemporary Art Festival SESC_Videobrasil, 2013. Work LucFosther Diop started making drawing on the free spaces of his books at the primary school like a hobby. His difficult familial atmosphere develops in him a strong solitary attitudes. He did not really got the feeling to play like other kids and was spending his time on trying to reproduce the images around. After he got the financial support of the Director of his secondary school in 1993, he bought colours, brushes and other tools for beginners. Then started making portraits, flowers and landscape in a very realistic ways. LucFosther represented his school and university many times in artistic competitions between 1995 and 2003. He really started getting in touch with film tools at the ArtBakery where he learned a lot about contemporary art and began to develop his process as an artist. Today, favouring a poetic point of view, LucFosther Diop is developing a research project on neocolonialism and imperialism, and their social, political, cultural, historical, geographic, economic and urban influences and repercussions. This research is essentially based on digital and media experimentation through photography, collage, drawing, video, ephemeral interventions, video performances, recycled documents and files found on the web and diversion of their content's meaning. He is calling these works \\"virtual made\\" or neo ready made and really enjoy the works by Marcel Duchamp, Alfredo Jaar, Olga Kisseleva, William Kentridge, Mona Hatoum, Pascal Kenfack, Goddy Leye, Bob Marley, Fela Kuti, Youssou Ndour and Richard Bona.

It may incorporate experimental techniques such as musique concr√®te, aleatoric music, or eclecticism into pop contexts. Often, the compositional process involves the use of electronic production effects to manipulate sounds and arrangements, and the composer may draw the listener's attention specifically with both timbre and tonality, though not always simultaneously. Experimental pop music developed concurrently with experimental jazz as a new kind of avant-garde, with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along the fringes of popular music. In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded the idea of the typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences. Characteristics Author Bill Martin states that while the term \\"experimental pop\\" may sound \\"seemingly oxymoronic\\", it is possible to identify three criteria for characterizing its music: *It is rooted in existing popular forms *It experiments with or stretches the use of these popular forms *It attempts to draw the audience of those forms toward these new developments, in the manner of the avant-garde Some tendencies among artists include the incorporation of experimental techniques such as musique concr√®te, aleatoric music, or eclecticism into pop contexts. Often, the compositional process involves the use of electronic production effects to manipulate sounds and arrangements. According to musicologist Leigh Landy, experimental pop settings combine sound-based work and note-based work, though not always simultaneously. Composer Nico Muhly described the world of experimental pop as \\"celebrations of sonic juxtapositions\\". History =Origins (1950s‚Äì60s)= Martin writes that experimental pop developed at roughly the same time as experimental jazz, and that it emerged as \\"a new kind of avant-garde\\" made possible by the historical and material circumstances of its time. In the pop and rock music of the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some of the best known examples are Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and Joe Meek's use of homemade electronic sound effects for acts like the Tornados. According to author Mark Brend, Meek's I Hear a New World (1960) predates better-known experimental pop by several years, whereas musicologist Leigh Landy names the American composer Frank Zappa as one of the first experimental pop musicians. Musician David Grubbs writes that many younger musicians \\"moved out of [John] Cage's shadow by taking to a different extreme and embracing the practice of making studio recordings of works along the fringes of popular music\\". Grubbs further explains that some of the most prominent avant-garde musicians who formed rock bands in the mid 1960s were the Welsh John Cale (later of the Velvet Underground) and the American Joseph Byrd (later of the United States of America), who both went on to create albums of experimental pop music. However, a \\"gulf\\" would still exist between experimental composers and \\"out-there\\" pop musicians, partly due to the role of the recording studio. Regarding this, composer Robert Ashley is quoted in 1966; Brian Wilson in the studio, 1976 Music historian Lorenzo Candalaria described American rock band the Beach Boys as \\"one of the most experimental and innovative groups of the 1960s.\\" Co-founder and leader Brian Wilson wrote and produced songs for the group that ranged from massive hits to obscure experimental pop compositions. Their 1966 single \\"Good Vibrations\\", also produced and co-written by Wilson, topped record charts internationally, subsequently proliferating a wave of pop experimentation with its rush of riff changes, echo chamber effects, and intricate harmonies. It was followed by Smiley Smile (1967), an album of stripped-down recordings. In 2003, Stylus Magazine wrote that the album \\"embrace[d] the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today\\". In the view of artist Duggie Fields, the Syd Barret-led incarnation of Pink Floyd exemplified experimental pop. The group found their initial success playing at the UFO Club in London, an underground venue whose objective was to provide an outlet for experimental pop groups. According to The New York Times, Barrett and his subsequent solo albums \\"became a touchstone for experimental pop musicians\\". By the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded the idea of the typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences, which cultural essayist Gerald Lyn Early credits to bands like Cream, Traffic, Blood, Sweat & Tears, and \\"of course\\", the Beatles. Drummer John Densmore believed that the Doors were on the cutting edge of experimental pop music until he listened to the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), which he described as \\"[seeming] to have done it all\\". Martin wrote that, along with the Rolling Stones' Their Satanic Majesties Request (1967), the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper \\"opened a space\\" for experimental pop which would be later filled by Jimi Hendrix, Jethro Tull, and the Who's Tommy (1968). Prior to Sgt. Pepper, Gary Usher and Curt Boettcher were Los Angeles-based songwriters and producers who were interested in classical music and the avant-garde. Later cited as fixtures of sunshine pop, they worked together to create their debut studio album, Present Tense (1968). It was credited to Sagittarius, a studio group referred to as an \\"experimental pop band\\" by The A.V. Club's Noel Murray. =1970s‚Äì80s= Kraftwerk performing in Zurich in 1976 Author Pascal Bussy wrote that German krautrock groups such as Can and Kraftwerk successfully bridged the gap between experimental and pop music in the 1970s, while according to The New York Times, Kraftwerk refined an \\"experimental pop sensibility\\" on albums such as Radio-Activity (1976) and Trans-Europe Express (1977). Writer Owen Hatherley located a \\"literary- experimental pop tradition\\" running throughout the United Kingdom during the 1970s and 1980s. Embodied by artists such as Roxy Music, the Smiths, the Associates, and Pet Shop Boys, this tradition \\"balanced sexuality and literacy, ostentatious performance and austere rectitude, raging ambition and class resentment, translating it into records balancing experimentation with populist cohesion.\\" Brian Eno at a live remix in 2012 The 1970s work of ex- Roxy Music member musician Brian Eno is cited by Leigh Landy as an archetypal example of a pop musician who \\"applied developments from the experimental sector while creating their own experimental pop sector.\\" Following his departure from Roxy Music in 1973, Eno began releasing a series of solo albums where he simultaneously developed his ambient, pop, and electronic styles. In the belief of pop musician Scott Miller, they were the era's \\"most successful\\" experimental pop artists, explaining that the key to Eno's success \\"appears to have been making a science out of decision points (see 'Oblique Strategies') rather than being willfully weird or different at the usual unexamined decision points\\" Eno's album Before and After Science (1977), according to Joshua Pickard of publication Nooga, was \\"experimental pop lucidity [...] the culmination of sound that Eno had been working on since the release of Here Come the Warm Jets in 1973.\\" Members of Roxy Music, Free, Fairport Convention, Can and Cluster feature on the record as session musicians in addition to Phil Collins, who performs drums on one track. Collins' own debut solo single \\"In the Air Tonight\\" (1981) was described by Gary Mills of The Quietus as being \\"at the vanguard of experimental pop\\" when it was released. He further called it \\"a rock oddity classic\\" which was influenced by \\"the unconventional studio predilections of Brian Eno and Peter Gabriel\\". Landy noted the tendency of experimental pop artists such as Eno and David Byrne to build tracks around existing recordings, effectively fusing different styles, a technique used on the duo's 1981 album My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. Laurie Anderson, 1980s The New York Times Will Hermes names Laurie Anderson an experimental pop pioneer whose signature song \\"O Superman\\" (1981) was a \\"left-field new wave hit\\" that \\"conflated maternal succor with the psychology of the modern corporate state using electronically processed verse.\\" Writing for The Guardian, Jason Cowley described British singer-songwriter Kate Bush as \\"an artist superbly articulate in the language of experimental pop music\\". Paste Magazine credited My Bloody Valentine's 1988 album Isn't Anything with showcasing an experimental pop aesthetic, which drew on \\"harsh, swirling guitar tones and beautifully dissonant distortion,\\" that would eventually develop into the genre known as shoegazing. Martin suggested that hip hop music, particularly released by artists such as Public Enemy and KRS-One, emerged as a new form of experimental pop, seeing a renewed merger of artistic and political innovation. =1990s‚Äì2000s= Icelandic singer Bj√∂rk, who began her solo career in the 1990s, has been called \\"the queen of experimental pop\\" by The Guardians Michael Cragg.The Guardian In a review of Animal Collective's album Strawberry Jam (2007), Evan L. Hanlon wrote that \\"experimental pop\\" is a \\"specious\\" but \\"necessary\\" term for acts like Animal Collective, \\"one of the only bands that takes [Brian] Wilson's influence to heart and then expands on it, pushing the conventions of pop music to their outer limits.\\" The record label Hippos in Tanks, founded by Barron Machat in 2010, was associated with Internet age experimental pop that drew on disparate sources such as new wave, avant-garde noise, R&B;, and techno. The label released projects by artists such as James Ferraro, Autre Ne Veut, Laurel Halo, Hype Williams, and Arca.

Background One of Hartman's final compositions, \\"The Love in Your Eyes\\" was written and produced by Hartman. Following the release of his 1989 instrumental album New Green Clear Blue, Hartman turned once again to producing and writing, mainly for others. By 1993, Hartman began to record a new album of contemporary pop and dance music. While in the studio during 1993, he noted that \\"So many things have changed in terms of social and political issues, as well as the need for love and personal relationships. All of these things are the reasons why writing and recording new material is most meaningful to me.\\" In the end, a total of two songs were completed; \\"Keep the Fire Burnin'\\" and \\"The Love in Your Eyes\\". The single was released posthumously after Hartman's death on March 22, 1994, from an AIDS-related brain tumor. Released in America and Europe, the single was not a commercial success and failed to make any chartings. It was Hartman's final single of his career, and succeeded \\"Keep the Fire Burnin'\\", which was the lead single from the same-titled album. The Keep the Fire Burnin' album largely featured remixes of Hartman's previous hits. The song and its remixes were mastered by Jose Rodriguez at the New York City mastering firm Sterling Sound. Release The single was released via 12\\" vinyl and CD by Chaos Recordings, a dimension of Columbia Records in America, and via Columbia Records directly in Europe. In America, it was manufactured by Chaos Recordings. At the time, the album was still forthcoming. In America, the CD release featured four different versions/remixes of the track; the \\"Radio Version\\" being the featured track, with the other three versions being the \\"Album Version,\\" the \\"(Hip Radio Version),\\" and the \\"Classic Frankie\\" version. The latter remix was handled by Frankie Knuckles. An American promotional version of the single was also issued, with the same track-listing as the main issue. In Europe, the CD single featured the same track-listing. The American 12\\" vinyl release featured the \\"Classic Frankie\\" remix as the featured track, along with four other exclusive remixes; the \\"(Classic Song)\\" version, the \\"(Reprise)\\" version, the \\"(DJ EFX's Raw Club)\\" version and the \\"(DJ EFX's Trib Hop)\\" version. The first three remixes were created by Knuckles, whilst the final two were done by Brendan McCarthy, DJ Digit and DJ Rasoul. The Frankie Knuckles remixes were done for Def Mix Productions. All editions of the single featured a full colour picture sleeve which highlighted a photograph of Hartman posing. Following the song's original release as a single and from the Keep the Fire Burnin' album, an exclusive remix of the song would also appear on the 1994 American promotional Hot Track Series various artists release Hot Tracks 13-9. This was titled \\"The Love in Your Eyes (Hot Tracks)\\", but was largely similar to the remixes by Frankie Knuckles.http://www.discogs.com/Various-Hot-Tracks-13-9/master/202463 Promotion No music video was created for the single as it was released after Hartman's death. In The Advocate of February 21, 1995, and the issue of March 7, 1995, it was revealed that the song was made available to listen to via The Advocate musicline, presented by JBL. It was given the dial code 106. Reception Upon release, Billboard said: \\"This [song] was among [Hartman's] final compositions, and it shows that he was still among the best writers and producers in pop music. Wrapped in warm romance, [the] tune has a retro-soul quality similar to his timeless mid-'80s hit \\"I Can Dream about You.\\" Perfectly suited to several radio and club formats, [the] single is an essential programming item from the upcoming Keep the Fire Burnin' collection.\\" Steve Baltin of Cash Box wrote: \\"This song, with its catchy dance groove, provides a strong legacy to Hartman's career, which was marked by the capability to write pop hits.\\"Cash Box magazine - Pop singles: Reviews - 19 November 1994 - page 7 In a 1995 review of Keep the Fire Burnin', The San Diego Union-Tribune described the song as \\"a softly soulful throwback.\\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=dan+hartman+love+in+your+eyes&tbm;=nws&source;=lnms&sa;=X&ei;=6X_pUafWIO210QWVpYD4Cw&ved;=0CAwQ_AUoATgK&biw;=1280&bih;=664#q=dan+hartman+love+in+your+eyes&tbm;=nws&source;=lnt&tbs;=ar:1&sa;=X&ei;=63_pUcLhNoan0wXssIGICg&ved;=0CCEQpwUoBQ&bav;=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm;=bv.49478099,d.d2k&fp;=6a684814048aa9ce&biw;=1280&bih;=664 In the liner notes of the album, writer Larry Flick stated: \\"The [song] showcases Dan's evocative tenor range, as well as his ability to transform simple love prose into a profound statement.\\" Track listing ;12\\" Single #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (Classic Frankie)\\" - 7:05 #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (Classic Song)\\" - 4:12 #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (Reprise)\\" - 7:05 #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (DJ EFX's Raw Club)\\" - 5:42 #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (DJ EFX's Trip Hop)\\" - 8:19 ;CD Single (American release) #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (Radio Version)\\" - 4:06 #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (Album Version)\\" - 4:58 #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (Hip Radio Version)\\" - 3:59 #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (Classic Frankie)\\" - 7:03 ;CD Single (European release) #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (Radio Version)\\" - 4:06 #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (Album Version)\\" - 4:58 #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (Hip Radio Version)\\" - 3:59 #\\"The Love in Your Eyes (Classic Frankie)\\" - 7:03  Personnel  * Lead Vocals, Producer, Writer - Dan Hartman * Mastering - Jose Rodriguez * Engineer on \\"Classic Frankie,\\" \\"Classic Song\\" and \\"Reprise\\" remixes - John Poppo * Keyboard Programming on \\"Classic Frankie,\\" \\"Classic Song\\" and \\"Reprise\\" remixes - Eric Kupper, Terry Burrus * Remixer, Additional Producer on \\"Classic Frankie,\\" \\"Classic Song\\" and \\"Reprise\\" remixes - Frankie Knuckles * Remixer, Re-production, Re-working, Flavoured on \\"DJ EFX's Raw Club\\" and \\"DJ EFX's Trib Hop\\" remixes - Brendan McCarthy, DJ Digit, DJ Rasoul * Editing on \\"Radio Version,\\" \\"Album Version\\" and \\"Hip Radio Version\\" versions - David Shaw, John Kubrick * Mixing on \\"Radio Version,\\" \\"Album Version\\" and \\"Hip Radio Version\\" versions - Dan Hartman References Category:Dan Hartman songs Category:1994 songs Category:1994 singles Category:Dance-pop songs Category:New jack swing songs Category:Song recordings produced by Dan Hartman Category:Songs written by Dan Hartman Category:Columbia Records singles ","title":"The Love in Your Eyes (Dan Hartman song)"},{"id":"40011994","text":"Panel 5 of the Tree swing cartoons A tree swing cartoon or tire swing cartoon is a humorous graphical metaphor that purports to explain communication pitfalls in the division of labor in the development of a product.

During World War II, he was a member of the U.S. Army unit devoted to recovering art, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives section (MFAA), a.k.a. \\"The Monuments Men.\\" Life and career Stout was born on October 5, 1897, in Winterset, Iowa (which was also the birthplace of actor John Wayne).Michael Swanger, \\"Iowan played key role in saving war treasures\\", Iowa HIstory Journal, July/August 2013. He studied at Grinnell College for two years and then served in a U.S. military hospital unit during World War I. After the war, he completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Iowa, taught painting in the art department for a couple of years, then traveled throughout Europe. In 1924, he married Margaret Hayes, with whom he had two sons, Robert and Thomas. In 1926, Stout began work on his master's degree at Harvard University. In 1929, he graduated and started his museum career in the art conservation department of Harvard's Fogg Art Museum, where he worked as a lecturer and conservator. Along with Harvard chemist Rutherford John Gettens, Stout pioneered three major areas of art conservation: rudiments, degradation, and reparations. This helped bring art conservation work into the world of modern science.\\"The Art Army: Harvard's Monuments Men at War\\", Harvard Magazine, January/February 2010. He became head of the Fogg's conservation department in 1933, a position he held until 1947. In 1942, with Rutherford John Gettens and introduced by Edward W. Forbes he published the seminal Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia.Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia, D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc, New York, 1942 A Navy reservist for some time, Stout was placed on active duty in 1943, and soon after joined the Twelfth Army Group. Because of his art conservation background, he was one of the first recruited to the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives section (MFAA). The group was charged with the protection of and documentation of damages to European cultural monuments during World War II, as well as the investigation, location, recovery, and repatriation of art that had been plundered by the Nazis. While in Europe from 1944-1945, he supervised the inventory and removal of several thousand art works from repositories hidden in salt mines, churches, and other locations, and was appointed as the deputy commander of the MFAA. After Japan's official surrender on September 2, 1945, Stout and fellow Monuments Man Laurence Sickman recommended creating a MFAA division in Tokyo. Consequently, the Arts and Monuments Division of the Civil Information and Education Section, GHQ, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers was established. Stout was the Chief of the Division from approximately August 1945 until the middle of 1946. After the war, Stout subsequently directed the Worcester Art Museum in Worcester, Massachusetts, from 1947-1954, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, in Boston, Massachusetts, from 1955-1970.\\"Oral history interview with George Leslie Stout, 1978 Mar. 10-21\\", Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. Stout was also instrumental in the founding of the International Institute for Conservation (IIC) and was its first president, from 1950‚Äì53 and served on its Council until 1963. Stout was made an Honorary Fellow of IIC in 1966. In 1975, he was inducted as an honorary member of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works for his accomplishments.

Born in Long Beach, California in 1943, Spindler struggled with learning disabilities as a child, later diagnosed as dyslexia. She began her art career with classes at Sherman E. Burroughs High School, but did not continue to college, instead marrying and starting a family. Spindler resumed her formal art education in 1979, with classes at Cerro Coso Community College. She focused on ceramic sculpture, graduating with an Associate of Arts degree in 1986. She then attended the University of California, Santa Cruz, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1990, at the age of 47. While Spindler's ceramics work started as a hobby, she slowly parlayed this into a professional career. Her most prominent work, the 2000 sculpture Hot Dog, is on permanent display in the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Other works of hers are included in the permanent collections of the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento, California, and the Winfield Gallery in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. Spindler has frequently spoken to students on her experiences in overcoming learning disabilities. In 2012, she served as a Distinguished Speaker for her alma mater Cerro Coso Community College's commencement exercises. She has also served as a trustee for Kern Community College District and the California Association of Community Colleges, and served on the Governor of California's Commission for Disabled Students.

History and architecture The choir of Falsterbo Church The oldest part of the church dates from the second half of the 14th century. Construction of the relatively large church must be seen in connection with the economically important medieval herring-trade and the Scania Market (Sk√§nemarkedet), in which Falsterbo and neighboring Skan√∂r played a central role. The earliest church was a simple, undecorated brick building. The nave is the oldest part of the church. The present choir was added during the 15th century and at about the same time the presently visible vaulting was constructed. The tower, with its crow-stepped gables typical for medieval Danish churches (Scania only became Swedish in 1658), is probably also from the 15th century. A number of murals which have been uncovered from 1953 onwards were probably also painted over during the reconstruction of the church during this time. The church contains some noteworthy interior details. The sculpted baptismal font is the earliest piece in the church, dating from the 14th century. The main altar is from the second half of the 15th century and probably made by Hermen Rode of L√ºbeck, or in his atelier. A smaller side- altar is from the same time period and likewise from northern Germany. There is also a sculpture depicting Saint Christopher made circa 1390, and attributed to Master Bertram of Minden. Two free-standing medieval Madonnas, one reputedly of French origin, can also be mentioned, as can a sculpture depicting a kneeling princess - the only remnant of a Saint George and the Dragon group, supposedly by master carver Henning Roleve of Rostock, another northern German late Gothic sculptor.

Dewhurst served in the Wisconsin State Assembly for four single discontinuous terms over four different decades (from the 1850s to the 1880s) under four different political party labels (Republican, Union, Liberal Reform and Independent);\\"Members of the Wisconsin Legislature 1848-1999 State of Wisconsin Legislative Bureau. Information Bulletin 99-1, September 1999. p. 44 and was defeated twice when running for election on the ticket of a fifth party, the Democratic.  Background  Dewhurst was born near Manchester, England on May 26, 1826; at the age of one year he came to the United States when his parents moved there, settling first in Bristol County, Massachusetts, then moving to Lorain County, Ohio, where they would spend the remainder of their lives, and where three more sons were born to them. Dewhurst spent a part of his boyhood and youth on his parents' farm, received a common school and academic education in Elyria, Ohio, subsequently but read the law in the Oberlin, Ohio office of one P. Bliss He was admitted to the bar of Ohio, and in 1850 moved to Jo Daviess County, Illinois, where for a while he worked in the lead mines. For a year or two he taught school in Scales Mound, Illinois, then moved about 1852 to Potosi in Grant County, Wisconsin.  Public office and employment; first term in the Assembly; marriage and move; Civil War  By 1854 he was teaching school in Platteville, and in 1856 was admitted to the bar of Wisconsin at White Oak Springs, before moving on to Weston in May of that year. In 1856 he was elected Clark County's county judge, and register of deeds. In 1858, he was first elected a member of the Assembly for a one-year term in the Legislature's 12th (1859) session as a member of the newly organized Republican Party, succeeding fellow Republican Lucius Cannon in the district encompassing Chippewa, Clark, Dunn and Pierce counties. He was succeeded by William P. Bartlett (also a Republican). On March 29, 1859 he married Maria S. Curtis, who had been born in Ohio on April 9, 1840 (her parents, both natives of Connecticut, were married in Ohio and had settled at Cottage Grove, Wisconsin). After marriage the Dewhursts came to Neillsville, settling on the bank of the creek below the mill. The nearest markets were then at Sparta and La Crosse, and the roads merely trails through the wilderness. They built a frame house, and there they began domestic life. Dewhurst engaged in logging, a widespread occupation in that region in those days. It was later remembered that there were still many American Indians in the area who often came to the Dewhurst home looking for handouts, and \\"were always given something.\\" During the American Civil War Dewhurst served in a Wisconsin regiment and served as a deputy U. S. assessor in 1863-4.  Second term in the Assembly  He was elected again in 1864 as a National Union candidate, to a district which now encompassed Clark and Jackson counties, succeeding Calvin R. Johnson (also a National Union candidate), and was assigned to the standing committees on banks and banking, and on school and university lands.

After the second term; 1870s and beyond  He was elected again to the Assembly in 1874 as a candidate of the Liberal Reform Party (also called the Democratic Reform or simply Reform Party), a short-lived coalition of Democrats, reform and Liberal Republicans, and Grangers formed in 1873. He was the Reform nominee both for the 32nd Senate District, losing 2097 to 2354 to Republican Robert C. Field; and for his old Assembly district (Clark and Jackson Counties), defeating Republican James Hewett 1210 to 1179. With the Reform coalition starting to break down (Reform Governor William Robert Taylor, the heart of the party, was defeated for re-election), Dewhurst was not a candidate for re-election in 1875, and was succeeded by Republican Hugh B. Mills. In 1875, he became county school superintendent; and upon the death of incumbent William Hutchinson he filled Hutchinson's unexpired term as county treasurer. In 1877 he once again became county judge, serving until 1879. During this period he built a colonial home in Neillsville, and a block on the town's Main Street bearing his name. In 1874 Dewhurst travelled to Oregon, Washington and California, and in the late 1870s toured Scotland, Ireland, his native England and the French Exposition. He ran for the Assembly again in 1884 as a Democrat (Clark County now had its own Assembly district), losing to Republican James O'Neill (the younger) with 1515 votes to O'Neill's 1831.Heg, James E., ed.

One of the most innovative styles of pottery Goodman developed is a modified coil pot, in which the coils are obliterated only on the interior surface.

In 1870, Tiernan published her first novel, Valerie Aylmer. In the following year, she published in Appletons' Journal a novel entitled Morton House, a story of Southern life. Tiernan considered it to be her best work. In 1887, she married James M. Tiernan, of Maryland, and accompanied him to Mexico where he had mining interests. There, she collected material for her novel, The Land of the Sun, and some Mexican short stories, notably The Pictures of Las Cruces, which appeared in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, and which was translated and published in L'Illustration of Paris. After her husband's death in 1898, Tiernan made her home in New York City, but later returned to Salisbury, North Carolina, living in the same house in which she was born. One of the best of her novels, The Land of the Sky, was set in western North Carolina. Though she never made a claim to being a poet, some of her verses were published. In 1909, Tiernan was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, in Indiana. This medal is given annually to a lay member of the Catholic Church for distinguished services in literature, art, science, or philosophy. Tiernan's receipt of the medal was the first when it was awarded to a Southerner. Early years and education Frances Fisher was born in Salisbury, North Carolina. Her parents were Colonel Charles Frederick Fisher and his wife, the former Elizabeth Clarissa Caldwell. Her mother had converted to become a Catholic; her father an Episcopalian. Colonel Fisher, was killed in the beginning of the American Civil War at the battle of Manassas, and his daughter remained loyal to his Confederate ideals to the end. The mother having died during Tiernan's infancy, their three children became orphans, raised by a Catholic maiden aunt. The Fisher family was rich, but the war caused the family to lose much of its money. The family lived at the northwest corner of Fulton and Innes Streets in Salisbury, North Carolina. As a child of three or four, before she had learned to form her letters, Frances would spin out long tales of fanciful invention, which she persuaded her aunt to transcribe. She received her early instruction from a maiden aunt, Miss Christine Reid, and as soon as she was old enough was sent to St. Mary's College, (now Saint Mary's School) in Raleigh, North Carolina. But her education was completed under the instruction of her aunt. Career The nom de plume, Christian Reid, which the family did not like, was said to have been taken from Christian, a family name on the mother's side, and Reid on her father's. The first article with this pseudonym was accepted by Appletons' Journal and a check for US$50 sent to \\"Christian Reid.\\" Being in a dilemma as to how to cash the check, she sought advice from her lawyer. He advised her to make it payable to him to avoid detection. Later, a member of the Appleton's firm wished to see the author as he passed through North Carolina, and could not discover such a person in Salisbury. He questioned the postmaster, who said probably Mr. Reid was related to the Fishers and had perhaps been visiting them, as his mail was sent their. Fisher confided to the postmaster about her pseudonymous name. Valerie Aylmer She wrote stories, but it was not until the end of the war, when the family found itself without fortune, that she conceived an idea. \\"I shall write a novel,\\" was greeted with amused skepticism. The publication of Valerie Aylmer in 1870 was an instant success. While it was faulty and immature; it possessed the charm of interest. Tosay it is of interest for its portrayal of life and conduct in the South, as reflected through the temperament of a sentimental, young lady of distinguished birth. The first period of Christian Reid's literary activities comprises the decade from 1869 to 1879. Most notable of the works of this period are the novels, Morton House (1871), A Daughter of Bohemia (1874), and A Question of Honor (1875). The most noteworthy book of Christian Reid's early years as a novelist, judged on the strength of its results, was the slight travel-sketch, entitled The Land of the Sky, which was published in 1876. In this book, read by hundreds of thousands of people, Christian Reid accomplished the most notable commemoration of a section of the US ever published in North Carolina. Southern Railway, after extending a line to Asheville around 1880, used ‚ÄúThe Land of the Sky\\" in advertising. Miss Churchill A distinct accession of power and increased mastery of style marked the works of Christian Reid's second period of literary activity, beginning after her return from Europe in 1880. Heart of Steel was a work approximating that of the standard English novelists, such as Anthony Trollope, in solidity of workmanship and concentration of purpose. Other works of this period were Armine, Roslyn's Fortune, The Child of Mary, Philip's Restitution, and Miss Churchill. When, in 1887, Miss Fisher married Mr. James Marquis Tiernan, of Maryland, and settled in Mexico, where her husband had extensive mining interests, there began the third period in Christian Reid's career as a novelist. Perhaps the story which, of all that she had ever written, contained more of the elements of general popularity and was at the same time most adequately written, was The Picture of Las Cruces. It had the distinction of being translated into French and appearing in L 'Illustration. The book was notable for the beauty of its envisagement of a semi-tropical land, the ideality of its poetic atmosphere, and the art displayed in the comparison and juxtaposition of the fragile romance of Mexico with the hardy realism of America. The Lady of Las Cruces, like most sequels was less a natural consequence of the former story, than a hazardous attempt to crown the story with a \\"happy\\" (and popular) ending. Other works of this period are: the travel-romance, The Land of the Sun (1894), one of her most interesting tales;, as well as Carmela, Little Maid of Mexico, A Comedy of Elopement, A Woman of Fortune, Weighed in the Balance, and Carmen's Inheritance. In addition, there were two novels which stood as memorials of Christian Reid's travels in Santo Domingo: The Man of the Family and The Chase of an Heiress. A Summer Idyl Christian Reid wrote at least two dramas, and quite a number of poems. The war-drama, Under the Southern Cross, was a stirring picture of the South during the American Civil War, and played to enthusiastic houses throughout the South. Its purport was to voice an impassioned presentation, fired by logic, of the views of the South upon the constitutional right of secession. The other play, entitled Princess Nadine, appeared in print only as a novel. It was originally written as a play, which was rewritten in collaboration with Victor Mapes, and translated into Italian. Most of her books were published by the Appletons, but a few, Roman Catholic in tone, such as Armine were brought out by the Catholic Publishing Company of New York. Other works included, Mabel Lee, Ebb Tide, Nina's Atonement, A Gentle Belle, Hearts and Hands, After Many Days, Bonny Kate, A Summer Idyll, A Child of Mary. Some critics described Fisher's work as \\"a graceful, limpid style\\", \\"bland\\" and \\"sylvan romances\\". Others described it as being striking in its naturalness and truthfulness. One biography said \\"There is in her fiction an over-reliance on the picturesque that was popular in the years following the Civil War. Yet, her work stands apart from the many narratives of travel in Appalachia in its honest and realistic portrait of life in southern society.\\" Personal life and legacy Early in life, she was received into the Catholic Church by Cardinal James Gibbons, then only Vicar Apostolic of North Carolina. She practised her religion zealously and to her was mainly due the erection of a Catholic church in her native town. Tiernan donated land for Sacred Heart Catholic Church, dedicated November 19, 1882. In 1909, Fisher received the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame. At the time, she had been the author of some 30 novels and numerous short stories, and was living with her aunt, Miss Christine Fisher. She married James Marquis Tiernan (died January 1898) on December 29, 1887, and they moved to Mexico where he had mining interests. Fisher died March 24, 1920 in Salisbury, and is buried at Chestnut Hill Cemetery. Because a fire destroyed some records in the 1930s, it is not certain which family member is buried where. In 2006, the entire family plot was enclosed by a brick wall, with materials and labor donated by the owners of Taylor Clay Products. A pink granite bench was added and a granite cross was restored.Deirdre Parker Smith, \\"Christian Reid is not forgotten,\\" Salisbury Post, March 25, 2006. The United Daughters of the Confederacy built a monument in 1939 on West Innes Street in Salisbury, which was moved in 1955 and again in 1983, this time to the Rowan Public Library. The Confederate Monument in Salisbury was paid for partly from the money Fisher made from The Land of the Sky.

Before he began painting, he worked as a trapper, fisherman, lumberjack, barber, and police officer. Dey was a favorite among the neighborhood children, whose toys and bicycles he fixed, and they affectionately nicknamed him \\"Uncle Jack\\". Biography John William Dey was born in Phoebus, Virginia. His parents separated when he was 11 years old, and he took on a series of odd jobs to help his family. He dropped out high school and later moved to Maine with a friend where he worked as a trapper and lumberjack. After his stay in Maine, Dey worked his way back south and settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he studied to be a barber. There, he met Margaret Pearl Cleveland, whom he later married. Dey became a police officer for the City of Richmond around 1942 and retired in 1955. Dey died of cardiopulmonary arrest in 1978.Chuck and Jan Rosenak research material, circa 1987-1998. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. Painting career Despite having no formal artistic training, Dey began painting in 1955 after his retirement from the police force. He preferred to use model airplane paint and painted on wood, plywood, and corrugated cardboard, which he sometimes covered with an old t-shirt. Dey purchased frames from yard sales and second-hand shops and then created paintings according to each frame's size. His subjects include country landscapes, Biblical stories, and imagined, exotic scenes, some inspired by his own memories. Each painting had a story, and Dey attached letters to the back of some of his paintings, explaining what the story was. Dey's doctor and friends were some of his earliest supporters and he gave away 300‚Äì400 of his paintings before he was recognized as an artist. It is estimated that he created around 650 paintings. In 1973, the American Folk Art Company in Richmond, Virginia, held Dey's first public paintings exhibition and more widespread recognition came in the next year when folk art collector Herbert Waide Hemphill, Jr. included an image of Adam and Even Leave Eden in his book,Twentieth-Century American Folk Art and Artists. Several of Dey's works, including Adam and Eve Leave Eden, The Elephant Who Was Fond of the Watermelon, and Acupuncture Pitchfork Style, are included in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

Biography  Bessie Stough was born near Wichita, Kansas in 1889 and spent most of her childhood on a farm, where her interest in animals originated. She moved to New York in the early 1920s after marrying The New York Times journalist Harold Callender. Here, she studied drawing under George Bridgman, at the Art Students League, and the Cooper Union. She also modeled from life. When she and her husband were transferred to Paris in 1926, she studied under Antoine Bourdelle, and later under the important animalier, Georges Hilbert. It was under Hilbert's supervision that she began the stone carvings of animals she received the most acclaim for. Callender's process began with observing animals in either the Jardin des Plantes or the London Zoo. Then, she would produce sketches and plasticine studies of an animal, until the \\"spirit\\" of the creature was captured. After that, she began to carve, and could take up to a year refining a single piece. The condensed forms and highly polished surfaces of her works show the influence of Egyptian sculpture, specifically block statues, which she considered to be the finest in the world. Her sculpture was immediately recognized for its quality and was frequently exhibited at the Salon des Independants in Paris and the Royal Academy in London. She continued to work until a cancer operation prevented her from sculpting later in life. After her death at the age of 62, in 1951, her husband donated seven of her sculptures to the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

It originated in the 'Asir Region of Saudi Arabia where the front parlour of traditional Arab homes typically contained wall paintings in the form of a mural or fresco with geometric designs in bright colors. Called nagash in Arabic, the wall paintings are often considered a mark of pride.Yunis, Alia, \\"The Majlis Painters,\\" Saudi Aramco World Magazine, July/August 2013, pages 24-31. In 2017 Al-Qatt Al-Asiri was inscribed on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Women‚Äôs artwork Women in the Asir region are traditionally responsible for plastering and painting the walls, corridors, and ceilings of their homes. A family‚Äôs wealth is often signified by the skill, color, and complexity of the paintings, with poorer homes decorated in basic straight, simple lines in red, green, yellow, and brown. Women within the same neighborhood sometimes compete to make the most vivid and extravagant designs. Women's artwork is heavily influenced by their love for music, their view of culture and general perception of life; for example, the artwork of more conservative women is more likely to feature conservative and modest colors. The interior walls of the home are brightly painted, employing defined patterns of lines, triangles, squares, diagonals and tree- like patterns.

He was famous for exacting standards, and even refused to complete many of the sculptures he began. Tovish focused on the human form as the primary vehicle for exploring metaphysical existence. Life Tovish was born in New York City to a Russian refugee father. His father died during the Great Depression and his destitute mother placed his older sisters in foster care and sent young Tovish to the Hebrew Orphan Asylum of New York. He took drawing classes that were sponsored by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Around age 16, Tovish finished his first sculpture, which then set the direction of his career. He received a scholarship and studied at the Columbia University School of the Arts where he studied with Oronzio Maldarelli. At Columbia, he also met Marianna Pineda. He earned his degree in 1943. Tovish was in Minneapolis-St Paul for a number of years around 1950, probably with the University of MN art department. (He and Marianna were family friends.) Tovish was sent to Europe by the United States Army during World War II. Upon returning in 1946, he married Pineda. He traveled to Paris with Ossip Zadkine, as well as Florence to study sculpture and drawing. After living in Europe for three years, the couple established residence and a studio in Boston in 1957. Tovish was artist-in-residence at the American Academy in Rome in 1965. In 1967, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship. Tovish taught at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Tovish was College of Fine Arts professor at Boston University from 1971 until his retirement in 1983. After his wife died in 1996, Tovish completed no works. He died of complications of a stroke one year after moving out of Boston to a retirement home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Works The early work of Tovish focused on the horror he witnessed as a soldier during World War II. In the early 1950s, he became concerned with the destructive consequences of science and technology, portraying humankind confronted with the machinery of \\"progress\\". Hilton Kramer described Tovish's 28 sculptures and 20 drawings that were exhibited at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum as \\"tedious, banal, and egregiously secondhand ... the work of a provincial artist ‚Äì no doublt adept in technique, but woefully deficient in ideas or imagination.\\" According to his daughter, Nina, Tovish \\"held himself to an extremely high standard and was ruthless about it\\" and as a consequence \\"he didn't leave behind a great body of work. He threw out 99 percent of everything he made.\\" He also requested that family members destroy all of his unfinished works upon his death. A retrospective display of six bronze sculptures organized by the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park of the artist's face and head showed a range of styles, including cubism and surrealism, as well as what was described as \\"contemporary biomorphic abstraction\\". =Collections= * The Museum of Modern Art * The Art Institute of Chicago * Walker Art Center References * * Category:1921 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Artists from New York City Category:Artists from Boston Category:American people of Russian descent Category:Columbia University School of the Arts alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology fellows Category:Boston University people Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:20th-century American sculptors Category:American male sculptors Category:School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston faculty Category:Sculptors from New York (state) Category:Sculptors from Massachusetts Category:Boston expressionism ","title":"Harold Tovish"},{"id":"40012982","text":"A \\"type A\\" Tanytrachelos, believed to be a female.

It is associated with the Skan√∂r-Falsterbo parish (Skan√∂r-Falsterbo f√∂rsamling) in the Diocese of Lund within the Church of Sweden. History and architecture Memorial to parishioners who were lost at sea Cemetery at Skan√∂r Church There has probably been a church at the site of the present one since the 12th century. The presently visible church however dates in its oldest parts, from the first half of the 13th century. The Romanesque nave is the oldest part of the church. It was unusual in that it was from the outset equipped with vaulted ceiling, not a simpler flat wooden ceiling. Rich herring deposits on the north side of the Falsterbo peninsula made Skan√∂r an important trading center in the 12th to 16th century. By the 14th century, Skan√∂r and neighbouring Falsterbo (Skan√∂r med Falsterbo) grew rich on herring-trade and through the regionally important Scania Market (Sk√§nemarkedet) which took place annually. This had repercussions for the church, which was greatly expanded. The nave was doubled in size, the present bell tower added, and the western fa√ßade adorned, typically for Scanian medieval churches, with crow- stepped gables. These additions were made in the new Gothic style. Less than a hundred years later, the large choir which today dominates the church with its high Gothic windows, was added. Furthermore, under the choir a crypt was built; Skan√∂r church is one of only four medieval churches in Scania with a crypt. These reconstruction efforts were probably intended only as the beginning of even larger reconstruction works, but these never came about (possibly as an effect of the herring trade shifting focus to nearby Falsterbo). There are some noteworthy interior details of the church. The main altar is a large Renaissance altar, probably made in Malm√∂. The baptismal font is medieval, although scholars disagree on its exact age. The triumphal cross is medieval, as is one of the church bells, made by a master bell-maker Gherhard Crammar in L√ºbeck.

The fabric covered wings had box spars and three-ply ribs. There were ailerons on both upper and lower wing, externally rod-connected. The upper wing was centrally supported with cabane struts. The trainer was designed to be powered by a Mercedes D.I or D.II engine. It is known that the smaller engine at least was flown. The fuselage was deep bellied, flat sided, constructed from wood and covered with three-ply. There were two open, tandem cockpits, the rear one provided with vision enhancing trailing edge cut-outs in both upper and lower planes. The V 39's undercarriage was standard for the time, with mainwheels on a rigid axle supported by fuselage mounted V-struts and with a tailskid. The V 39 was designed to combine modest performance with reliability and robustness with easy handling and a low landing speed.

Education Boozer received her training and education at Auburn University, where she graduated with a BFA in 1989, and later earned a MFA from New York State College of Ceramics in 1992. Career Boozer is the founder and director of the Red Dirt Studio, a group art studio in Mount Rainier, Maryland, where she teaches advanced workshops in ceramics and sculpture that help students transition toward becoming professionals with their own studios. Prior to founding the Red Dirt Studio, she taught for ten years at the Corcoran College of Art and Design. She also is a visiting artist and lecturer at the Freer Gallery of Art, Auburn University, Renwick Gallery, Gallaudet University, George Washington University, and the Virginia Commonwealth University. Boozer was a member of the Washington Sculptors Group Board of Directors Membership Committee. Work and collections Boozer's work is included in the collection of the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, New York's South Street Seaport Museum, the US Department of State, the Washington DC City Hall Art Collection at the John A. Wilson Building, and in other various private collections. Boozer also creates work that is more readily consumable for commercial art galleries, often consisting of highly decorative abstract wall-mounted pieces in the form of cracked, heat-blasted rectangular slabs. In 2009, her work was on view at the American University Museum at the Katzen Arts Center and may have qualified as the biggest mud pie in the world to be found in a museum. The work, Dirt Drawings, was to provide an opportunity for visitors to have the same experience she does every morning at her studio, and consisted of a floor installation that included crumbling clay that formed crater-like platters of ringed clay. In 2011, her work From This Distance, a clay and steel sculpture that results in a galactic array of clusters of speckled and distressed porcelain disks, was commissioned for installation as part of a permanent exhibition at the Djibouti US Embassy for the US State Department. Also in 2011, her work Line Drawing, a site-specific installation, was temporarily exhibited at the Flashpoint Gallery in Washington, DC. For this exhibit, Boozer used samples of excavated sedimentary rock and soil found at the nearby construction site of CityCenterDC, to recreate a geologically accurate linear progression of the earth below the gallery and city, by laying stratum after stratum in a narrow lengthwise band down the centre of the gallery floor. The history and geology of the earth is often a theme in some of Boozer's work, drawing inspiration from the raw soil and clay materials to present an abstract vision of an often overlooked story. In this approach, her 2012 work Correlation Drawing / Drawing Correlations: A Five Borough Reconnaissance Soil Survey showcases the aesthetics of urban soil while presenting a mapped history of the soil beneath New York City. The piece, the result of a cooperation with Dr. Richard K. Shaw, soil scientist for the Natural Resources Conservation Service who led the New York City Reconnaissance Soil Survey, was originally exhibited at the Museum of Art and Design; the piece was afterwards acquired by the Museum of the City of New York for permanent exhibition as the South Street Seaport Museum, and it consists of a grid of translucent plexiglas boxes that contain soil samples from all five New York boroughs surveyed over a span of 15 years.

The Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act was a part of the 1933 Banking Act. It placed restrictions on activities that commercial banks and investment banks (or other securities firms) could do. It effectively separated those activities, so the two types of business could not mix, in order to protect consumer's money from speculative use. The Banking Act of 1935 clarified and otherwise amended Glass‚ÄìSteagall. Over time, private firms and their regulators found novel ways to weaken the barriers envisioned in the legislation. Eventually, the protections became very weak. From its start, there were many economists, businessmen, and politicians who did not find the restrictions to be productive, and wished to do away with them altogether. It took about 66 years, but the legislation was eventually completely repealed. Subsequent financial crises have resulted in attempts to revive the legislation, and even make it stronger than originally envisioned. Glass‚ÄìSteagall developments from 1935 to 1991 Commercial banks withdrew from the depressed securities markets of the early 1930s even before the Glass‚ÄìSteagall prohibitions on securities underwriting and dealing became effective.Garten 1989, pp. 515-516. Hendrickson 2001, p. 860. Peach 1941, p. 160. However, those prohibitions were controversial. A 1934 study of commercial bank affiliate underwriting of securities in the 1920s found such underwriting was not better than the underwriting by firms that were not affiliated with banks. That study disputed Glass‚ÄìSteagall critics who suggested securities markets had been harmed by prohibiting commercial bank involvement. A 1942 study also found that commercial bank affiliate underwriting was not better (or worse) than nonbank affiliate underwriting, but concluded this meant it was a \\"myth\\" commercial bank securities affiliates had taken advantage of bank customers to sell \\"worthless securities.\\" =Senator Glass's \\"repeal\\" effort= In 1935 Senator Glass attempted to repeal the Glass‚ÄìSteagall prohibition on commercial banks underwriting corporate securities. Glass stated Glass‚ÄìSteagall had unduly damaged securities markets by prohibiting commercial bank underwriting of corporate securities.. Wilmarth 2008, p. 590. The first Senate passed version of the Banking Act of 1935 included Glass's revision to Section 16 of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act to permit bank underwriting of corporate securities subject to limitations and regulations.Burns 1974, pp. 170-171. Patrick 1993, pp. 265-266. Wilmarth 2008, pp. 590-591. President Roosevelt opposed this revision to Section 16 and wrote Glass that \\"the old abuses would come back if underwriting were restored in any shape, manner, or form.\\" In the conference committee that reconciled differences between the House and Senate passed versions of the Banking Act of 1935, Glass's language amending Section 16 was removed.Burns 1974, pp. 170-171. Perkins 1971, p. 269. =Comptroller Saxon's Glass‚ÄìSteagall interpretations= President John F. Kennedy's appointee as Comptroller of the Currency, James J. Saxon, was the next public official to seriously challenge Glass‚ÄìSteagall's prohibitions. As the regulator of national banks, Saxon was concerned with the competitive position of commercial banks. In 1950 commercial banks held 52% of the assets of US financial institutions. By 1960 that share had declined to 38%. Saxon wanted to expand the powers of national banks.White 1992, p. 7. In 1963, the Saxon- led Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a regulation permitting national banks to offer retail customers \\"commingled accounts\\" holding common stocks and other securities.Pitt and Williams 1983, p. 142. Investment Company Institute v. Camp, 401 U.S. 617, pp. 621-622 (for OCC actions) (1971). Retrieved February 18, 2012. This amounted to permitting banks to offer mutual funds to retail customers.Langevoort 1987, pp. 688-690. . Saxon also issued rulings that national banks could underwrite municipal revenue bonds.. White 1992, p. 13. Courts ruled that both of these actions violated Glass‚ÄìSteagall.White 1992, pp. 13 and 15. Reinicke 1995, p. 31. In rejecting bank sales of accounts that functioned like mutual funds, the Supreme Court explained in Investment Company Institute v. Camp that it would have given \\"deference\\" to the OCC's judgment if the OCC had explained how such sales could avoid the conflicts of interest and other \\"subtle hazards\\" Glass‚ÄìSteagall sought to prevent and that could arise when a bank offered a securities product to its retail customers.. Courts later applied this aspect of the Camp ruling to uphold interpretations of Glass‚ÄìSteagall by federal banking regulators. As in the Camp case, these interpretations by bank regulators were routinely challenged by the mutual fund industry through the Investment Company Institute or the securities industry through the Securities Industry Association as they sought to prevent competition from commercial banks.Macey 2000, p. 717. Reinicke 1995, p. 31 =1966 to 1980 developments= Increasing competitive pressures for commercial banks Regulation Q limits on interest rates for time deposits at commercial banks, authorized by the 1933 Banking Act, first became \\"effective\\" in 1966 when market interest rates exceeded those limits.. This produced the first of several \\"credit crunches\\" during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s as depositors withdrew funds from banks to reinvest at higher market interest rates.Minsky 1982, pp. xii-xiv. When this \\"disintermediation\\" limited the ability of banks to meet the borrowing requests of all their corporate customers, some commercial banks helped their \\"best customers\\" establish programs to borrow directly from the \\"capital markets\\" by issuing commercial paper.. Over time, commercial banks were increasingly left with lower credit quality, or more speculative, corporate borrowers that could not borrow directly from the \\"capital markets.\\"Garten 1989, pp. 522-524. Wilmarth 1990, pp. 1147-1148. Eventually, even lower credit quality corporations and (indirectly through \\"securitization\\") consumers were able to borrow from the capital markets as improvements in communication and information technology allowed investors to evaluate and invest in a broader range of borrowers.Wilmarth 1990, pp. 1142-1143. Banks began to finance residential mortgages through securitization in the late 1970s. During the 1980s banks and other lenders used securitizations to provide \\"capital markets\\" funding for a wide range of assets that previously had been financed by bank loans.. . In losing \\"their preeminent status as expert intermediaries for the collection, processing, and analysis of information relating to extensions of credit\\", banks were increasingly \\"bypassed\\" as traditional \\"depositors\\" invested in securities that replaced bank loans.Wilmarth 1990, pp. 1142-1144. In 1977 Merrill Lynch introduced a \\"cash management account\\" that allowed brokerage customers to write checks on funds held in a money market account or drawn from a \\"line of credit\\" Merrill provided.Mayer 1984, pp. 34-45. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had ruled that money market funds could \\"redeem\\" investor shares at a $1 stable \\"net asset value\\" despite daily fluctuations in the value of the securities held by the funds. This allowed money market funds to develop into \\"near money\\" as \\"investors\\" wrote checks (\\"redemption orders\\") on these accounts much as \\"depositors\\" wrote checks on traditional checking accounts provided by commercial banks.. Also in the 1970s savings and loans, which were not restricted by Glass‚ÄìSteagall other than Section 21, were permitted to offer \\"negotiable order of withdrawal accounts\\" (NOW accounts). As with money market accounts, these accounts functioned much like checking accounts in permitting a depositor to order payments from a \\"savings account.\\". Litan 1987, p. 34. . Helen Garten concluded that the \\"traditional regulation\\" of commercial banks established by the 1933 Banking Act, including Glass‚ÄìSteagall, failed when nonbanking firms and the \\"capital markets\\" were able to provide replacements for bank loans and deposits, thereby reducing the profitability of commercial banking.Garten 1989, pp. 508-509 and 521-525. Garten 1991, pp. 8-14. Richard Vietor agreed that traditional bank regulation was unable to protect commercial banks from nonbank competition. However, he noted that significant the economic and financial instability began in the mid-1960s. This slowed economic growth and savings, which reduced demand and supply of credit; it also induced financial innovations that undermined commercial banks.Vietor 1987, pp. 33-39. Hyman Minsky agreed financial instability had returned in 1966 and had only been constrained in the following 15 years through Federal Reserve Board engineered \\"credit crunches\\" to combat inflation followed by \\"lender of last resort\\" rescues of asset prices that produced new inflation. Minsky described ever worsening periods of inflation followed by unemployment as the cycle of rescues followed by credit crunches was repeated. Minsky, however, supported traditional banking regulationMayer 1974, pp. 523 and 531-535. and advocated further controls of finance to \\"promote smaller and simpler organizations weighted more toward direct financing.\\"Minsky 1982, p. 201 Writing from a similar \\"neo-Keynesian perspective,\\" Jan Kregel concluded that, after World War II, non-regulated financial companies, supported by regulatory actions, developed means to provide bank products (\\"liquidity and lending accommodation\\") more cheaply than commercial banks through the \\"capital markets.\\", p. 66 (Section 3.10 \\"The regulatory dynamic of innovation and protection\\"). Kregel argued this led banking regulators to eliminate Glass‚ÄìSteagall restrictions to permit banks to \\"duplicate these structures\\" using the capital markets \\"until there was virtually no difference in the activities of FDIC-insured commercial banks and investment banks.\\". Comptroller Saxon had feared for the competitive viability of commercial banks in the early 1960s. The \\"capital markets\\" developments in the 1970s increased the vulnerability of commercial banks to nonbank competitors. As described below, this competition would increase in the 1980s. Limited congressional and regulatory developments In 1967 the Senate passed the first of several Senate passed bills that would have revised Glass‚ÄìSteagall Section 16 to permit banks to underwrite municipal revenue bonds.. Reinicke 1995, p. 59. In 1974 the OCC authorized national banks to provide \\"automatic investment services,\\" which permitted bank customers to authorize regular withdrawals from a deposit account to purchase identified securities.. . In 1977 the Federal Reserve Board staff concluded Glass‚ÄìSteagall permitted banks to privately place commercial paper. In 1978 Bankers Trust began making such placements.Pitt and Williams 1983, pp. 154-155. As described below, in 1978, the OCC authorized a national bank to privately place securities issued to sell residential mortgages in a securitization Commercial banks, however, were frustrated with the continuing restrictions imposed by Glass‚ÄìSteagall and other banking laws.Reinicke 1995, pp. 57-58. After many of Comptroller Saxon's decisions granting national banks greater powers had been challenged or overturned by courts, commercial banking firms had been able to expand their non-securities activities through the \\"one bank holding company.\\"Shull and White 1998, p. 5. Because the Bank Holding Company Act only limited nonbanking activities of companies that owned two or more commercial banks, \\"one bank holding companies\\" could own interests in any type of company other than securities firms covered by Glass‚ÄìSteagall Section 20. That \\"loophole\\" in the Bank Holding Company Act was closed by a 1970 amendment to apply the Act to any company that owned a commercial bank.Reinicke 1995, pp. 30-31. Shull and White 1998, pp. 5-6. Commercial banking firm's continuing desire for greater powers received support when Ronald Reagan became President and appointed banking regulators who shared an \\"attitude towards deregulation of the financial industry.\\"Reinicke 1995, p. 61. =Reagan Administration developments= State non-member bank and nonbank bank \\"loopholes\\" In 1982, under the chairmanship of William Isaac, the FDIC issued a \\"policy statement\\" that state chartered non-Federal Reserve member banks could establish subsidiaries to underwrite and deal in securities. Also in 1982 the OCC, under Comptroller C. Todd Conover, approved the mutual fund company Dreyfus Corporation and the retailer Sears establishing \\"nonbank bank\\" subsidiaries that were not covered by the Bank Holding Company Act. The Federal Reserve Board, led by Chairman Paul Volcker, asked Congress to overrule both the FDIC's and the OCC's actions through new legislation.Reinicke 1995, pp. 65-70. The FDIC's action confirmed that Glass‚ÄìSteagall did not restrict affiliations between a state chartered non- Federal Reserve System member bank and securities firms, even when the bank was FDIC insured.Reinicke 1995, pp. 65-66. . Shull and White 1998, p. 7. State laws differed in how they regulated affiliations between banks and securities firms.. Shull and White 1998, p. 7. In the 1970s, foreign banks had taken advantage of this in establishing branches in states that permitted such affiliations.Reinicke 1995, pp. 91 and 95. Pitt and Williams 1983, p. 167. Although the International Banking Act of 1978 brought newly established foreign bank US branches under Glass‚ÄìSteagall, foreign banks with existing US branches were \\"grandfathered\\" and permitted to retain their existing investments. Through this \\"loophole\\" Credit Suisse was able to own a controlling interest in First Boston, a leading US securities firm.Capatides 1992, p. 7, fn. 12. After the FDIC's action, commentators worried that large commercial banks would leave the Federal Reserve System (after first converting to a state charter if they were national banks) to free themselves from Glass‚ÄìSteagall affiliation restrictions, as large commercial banks lobbied states to permit commercial bank investment banking activities.Reinicke 1995, pp. 66-68 and 75. The OCC's action relied on a \\"loophole\\" in the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) that meant a company only became a \\"bank holding company\\" supervised by the Federal Reserve Board if it owned a \\"bank\\" that made \\"commercial loans\\" (i.e., loans to businesses) and provided \\"demand deposits\\" (i.e., checking accounts). A \\"nonbank bank\\" could be established to provide checking accounts (but not commercial loans) or commercial loans (but not checking accounts). The company owning the nonbank bank would not be a bank holding company limited to activities \\"closely related to banking.\\" This permitted Sears, GE, and other commercial companies to own \\"nonbank banks.\\". . . Glass‚ÄìSteagall's affiliation restrictions applied if the nonbank bank was a national bank or otherwise a member of the Federal Reserve System. The OCC's permission for Dreyfus to own a nationally chartered \\"nonbank bank\\" was based on the OCC's conclusion that Dreyfus, as a mutual fund company, earned only a small amount of its revenue through underwriting and distributing shares in mutual funds. Two other securities firms, J. & W. Seligman & Co. and Prudential-Bache, established state chartered non-Federal Reserve System member banks to avoid Glass‚ÄìSteagall restrictions on affiliations between member banks and securities firms.Langevoort 1987, pp. 709-712. Legislative response Although Paul Volcker and the Federal Reserve Board sought legislation overruling the FDIC and OCC actions, they agreed bank affiliates should have broader securities powers. They supported a bill sponsored by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Jake Garn (R-UT) that would have amended Glass‚ÄìSteagall Section 20 to cover all FDIC insured banks and to permit bank affiliates to underwrite and deal in mutual funds, municipal revenue bonds, commercial paper, and mortgage-backed securities. On September 13, 1984, the Senate passed the Garn bill in an 89-5 vote, but the Democratic controlled House did not act on the bill.Reinicke 1995, pp. 76-77. . In 1987, however, the Senate (with a new Democratic Party majority) joined with the House in passing the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 (CEBA). Although primarily dealing with the savings and loan crisis, CEBA also established a moratorium to March 1, 1988, on banking regulator actions to approve bank or affiliate securities activities, applied the affiliation restrictions of Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32 to all FDIC insured banks during the moratorium, and eliminated the \\"nonbank bank\\" loophole for new FDIC insured banks (whether they took demand deposits or made commercial loans) except industrial loan companies. Existing \\"nonbank banks\\", however, were \\"grandfathered\\" so that they could continue to operate without becoming subject to BHCA restrictions.Reinicke 1995, p. 96. , pp. CRS-4 to CRS-5. Kurucza et al. 1988, pp. 1112 and 1119. The CEBA was intended to provide time for Congress (rather than banking regulators) to review and resolve the Glass‚ÄìSteagall issues of bank securities activities. Senator William Proxmire (D-WI), the new Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, took up this topic in 1987.Kurucza et al. 1988, p. 1107. Reinicke 1995, pp. 96-99. International competitiveness debate Wolfgang Reinicke argues that Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"repeal\\" gained unexpected Congressional support in 1987 because large banks successfully argued that Glass‚ÄìSteagall prevented US banks from competing internationally.Reinicke 1995, pp. 84-85 and 91-101 With the argument changed from preserving the profitability of large commercial banks to preserving the \\"competitiveness\\" of US banks (and of the US economy), Senator Proxmire reversed his earlier opposition to Glass‚ÄìSteagall reform.Reinicke 1995, pp. 98-100. Proxmire sponsored a bill that would have repealed Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32 and replaced those prohibitions with a system for regulating (and limiting the amount of) bank affiliate securities activities.Reinicke 1995, pp. 99-100 and 105-109. . He declared Glass‚ÄìSteagall a \\"protectionist dinosaur.\\"White 1992, p. 53. By 1985 commercial banks provided 26% of short term loans to large businesses compared to 59% in 1974. While banks cited such statistics to illustrate the \\"decline of commercial banking,\\" Reinicke argues the most influential factor in Congress favoring Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"repeal\\" was the decline of US banks in international rankings. In 1960 six of the ten largest banks were US based, by 1980 only two US based banks were in the top ten, and by 1989 none was in the top twenty five.Reinicke 1995, pp. 91-92, 95, and 115-116. In the late 1980s the United Kingdom and Canada ended their historic separations of commercial and investment banking.. Reinicke 1995, pp. 92 (for the U.K.'s Big Bang) and 95 (for broader global \\"deregulation\\"). Glass‚ÄìSteagall critics scornfully noted only Japanese legislation imposed by Americans during the Occupation of Japan kept the United States from being alone in separating the two activities.. As noted above, even in the United States seventeen foreign banks were free from this Glass‚ÄìSteagall restriction because they had established state chartered branches before the International Banking Act of 1978 brought newly established foreign bank US branches under Glass‚ÄìSteagall. Similarly, because major foreign countries did not separate investment and commercial banking, US commercial banks could underwrite and deal in securities through branches outside the United States. Paul Volcker agreed that, \\"broadly speaking,\\" it made no sense that US commercial banks could underwrite securities in Europe but not in the United States.Reinicke 1995, pp. 92, 95, and 101. . 1987 status of Glass‚ÄìSteagall debate Throughout the 1980s and 1990s scholars published studies arguing that commercial bank affiliate underwriting during the 1920s was no worse, or was better, than underwriting by securities firms not affiliated with banks and that commercial banks were strengthened, not harmed, by securities affiliates.Benston 1990, pp. 32-34. . . More generally, researchers attacked the idea that \\"integrated financial services firms\\" had played a role in creating the Great Depression or the collapse of the US banking system in the 1930s.Vietor 1987, pp. 38-39. If it was \\"debatable\\" whether Glass‚ÄìSteagall was justified in the 1930s, it was easier to argue that Glass‚ÄìSteagall served no legitimate purpose when the distinction between commercial and investment banking activities had been blurred by \\"market developments\\" since the 1960s.Garten 1989, pp. 512-513. . Along with the \\"nonbank bank\\" \\"loophole\\" from BHCA limitations, in the 1980s the \\"unitary thrift\\" \\"loophole\\" became prominent as a means for securities and commercial firms to provide banking (or \\"near banking\\") products.Eaton 1995, pp. 1202-1210. The Savings and Loan Holding Company Act (SLHCA) permitted any company to own a single savings and loan. Only companies that owned two or more savings and loan were limited to thrift related businesses.. Already in 1973 First Chicago Bank had identified Sears as its real competitor.Mayer 1974, p. 535. Citicorp CEO Walter Wriston reached the same conclusion later in the 1970s.Mayer 1984, p. 49. By 1982, using the \\"unitary thrift\\" and \\"nonbank bank\\" \\"loopholes,\\" Sears had built the \\"Sears Financial Network\\", which combined \\"Super NOW\\" accounts and mortgage loans through a large California- based savings and loan, the Discover Card issued by a \\"nonbank bank\\" as a credit card, securities brokerage through Dean Witter Reynolds, home and auto insurance through Allstate, and real estate brokerage through Coldwell Banker.Mayer 1984, pp. 49-52. Shull and White 1998, p. 6. By 1984, however, Walter Wriston concluded \\"the bank of the future already exists, and it's called Merrill Lynch.\\"Vietor 1987, p. 49. In 1986 when major bank holding companies threatened to stop operating commercial banks in order to obtain the \\"competitive advantages\\" enjoyed by Sears and Merrill Lynch, FDIC Chairman William Seidman warned that could create \\"chaos.\\"Reinicke 1995, p. 93. . In a 1987 \\"issue brief\\" the Congressional Research Service (CRS) summarized \\"some of\\" the major arguments for preserving Glass‚ÄìSteagall as: # Conflicts of interest characterize the granting of credit (lending) and the use of credit (investing) by the same entity, which led to abuses that originally produced the Act. # Depository institutions possess enormous financial power, by virtue of their control of other people's money; its extent must be limited to ensure soundness and competition in the market for funds, whether loans or investments. # Securities activities can be risky, leading to enormous losses. Such losses could threaten the integrity of deposits. In turn, the Government insures deposits and could be required to pay large sums if depository institutions were to collapse as the result of securities losses. # Depository institutions are supposed to be managed to limit risk. Their managers thus may not be conditioned to operate prudently in more speculative securities businesses. An example is the crash of real estate investment trusts sponsored by bank holding companies a decade ago. and against preserving Glass‚ÄìSteagall as: # Depository institutions now operate in \\"deregulated\\" financial markets in which distinctions between loans, securities, and deposits are not well drawn. They are losing market shares to securities firms that are not so strictly regulated, and to foreign financial institutions operating without much restriction from the Act. # Conflicts of interest can be prevented by enforcing legislation against them, and by separating the lending and credit functions through forming distinctly separate subsidiaries of financial firms. # The securities activities that depository institutions are seeking are both low-risk by their very nature, and would reduce the total risk of organizations offering them ‚Äì by diversification. # In much of the rest of the world, depository institutions operate simultaneously and successfully in both banking and securities markets. Lessons learned from their experience can be applied to our national financial structure and regulation.. Reflecting the significance of the \\"international competitiveness\\" argument, a separate CRS Report stated banks were \\"losing historical market shares of their major activities to domestic and foreign competitors that are less restricted.\\"Reinicke 1995, p. 98 (quoting CRS Report No. 87-725E). Separately, the General Accounting Office (GAO) submitted to a House subcommittee a report reviewing the benefits and risks of \\"Glass‚ÄìSteagall repeal.\\" The report recommended a \\"phased approach\\" using a \\"holding company organizational structure\\" if Congress chose \\"repeal.\\" Noting Glass‚ÄìSteagall had \\"already been eroded and the erosion is likely to continue in the future,\\" the GAO explained \\"coming to grips with the Glass‚ÄìSteagall repeal question represents an opportunity to systematically and rationally address changes in the regulatory and legal structure that are needed to better address the realities of the marketplace.\\" The GAO warned that Congress's failure to act was \\"potentially dangerous\\" in permitting a \\"continuation of the uneven integration of commercial and investment banking activities.\\". As Congress was considering the Proxmire Financial Modernization Act in 1988, the Commission of the European Communities proposed a \\"Second Banking Directive\\". that became effective at the beginning of 1993 and provided for the combination of commercial and investment banking throughout the European Economic Community.Jeannot 1999, pp. 1733, fn. 98 (on effective date), and 1736-1738 (on securities powers). . Whereas United States law sought to isolate banks from securities activities, the Second Directive represented the European Union's conclusion that securities activities diversified bank risk, strengthening the earnings and stability of banks.Jeannot 1999, pp. 1737-1738. The Senate passed the Proxmire Financial Modernization Act of 1988 in a 94-2 vote. The House did not pass a similar bill, largely because of opposition from Representative John Dingell (D-MI), chairman of the House Commerce and Energy Committee.Reinicke 1995, pp. 105-111. =Section 20 affiliates= In April 1987, the Federal Reserve Board had approved the bank holding companies Bankers Trust, Citicorp, and J.P. Morgan & Co. establishing subsidiaries (\\"Section 20 affiliates\\") to underwrite and deal in residential mortgage- backed securities, municipal revenue bonds, and commercial paper. Glass‚ÄìSteagall's Section 20 prohibited a bank from affiliating with a firm \\"primarily engaged\\" in underwriting and dealing in securities. The Board decided this meant Section 20 permitted a bank affiliate to earn 5% of its revenue from underwriting and dealing in these types of securities that were not \\"bank-eligible securities,\\" subject to various restrictions including \\"firewalls\\" to separate a commercial bank from its Section 20 affiliate.Reinicke 1995, pp. 103-104. FRB Manual, Section 3600.21.2. Three months later the Board added \\"asset-backed securities\\" backed by pools of credit card accounts or other \\"consumer finance assets\\" to the list of \\"bank- ineligible securities\\" a Section 20 affiliate could underwrite. Bank holding companies, not commercial banks directly, owned these Section 20 affiliates.Reinicke 1995, pp. 103-104. FRB Manual, Section 3600.21.3. In 1978 the Federal Reserve Board had authorized bank holding companies to establish securities affiliates that underwrote and dealt in government securities and other bank-eligible securities.Fein 2011, ¬ß 1.04[A], pp. 1-14. . Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker supported Congress amending Glass‚ÄìSteagall to permit such affiliates to underwrite and deal in a limited amount of bank- ineligible securities, but not corporate securities. In 1987, Volcker specifically noted (and approved the result) that this would mean only banks with large government securities activities would be able to have affiliates that would underwrite and deal in a significant volume of \\"bank-ineligible securities.\\", pp. 505-506. Reinicke 1995, p. 103. A Section 20 affiliate with a large volume of government securities related revenue would be able to earn a significant amount of \\"bank-ineligible\\" revenue without having more than 5% of its overall revenue come from bank-ineligible activities.. Volcker disagreed, however, that the Board had authority to permit this without an amendment to the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act. Citing that concern, Volcker and fellow Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne Angell dissented from the Section 20 affiliate orders.Reinicke 1995, pp. 103-4. , pp. 505-506. Senator Proxmire criticized the Federal Reserve Board's Section 20 affiliate orders as defying Congressional control of Glass‚ÄìSteagall. The Board's orders meant Glass‚ÄìSteagall did not prevent commercial banks from affiliating with securities firms underwriting and dealing in \\"bank-ineligible securities,\\" so long as the activity was \\"executed in a separate subsidiary and limited in amount.\\"Reinicke 1995, p. 103. After the Proxmire Financial Modernization Act of 1988 failed to become law, Senator Proxmire and a group of fellow Democratic senior House Banking Committee members (including future Committee Ranking Member John LaFalce (D-NY) and future Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-MA)) wrote the Federal Reserve Board recommending it expand the underwriting powers of Section 20 affiliates.Reinicke 1995, pp. 110-111. Expressing sentiments that Representative James A. Leach (R-IA) repeated in 1996, Proxmire declared \\"Congress has failed to do the job\\" and \\"[n]ow it's time for the Fed to step in.\\"Reinicke 1995, p. 110. Following Senator Proxmire's letter, in 1989 the Federal Reserve Board approved Section 20 affiliates underwriting corporate debt securities and increased from 5% to 10% the percentage of its revenue a Section 20 affiliate could earn from \\"bank- ineligible\\" activities. In 1990 the Board approved J.P. Morgan & Co. underwriting corporate stock. With the commercial (J.P. Morgan & Co.) and investment (Morgan Stanley) banking arms of the old \\"House of Morgan\\" both underwriting corporate bonds and stocks, Wolfgang Reinicke concluded the Federal Reserve Board order meant both firms now competed in \\"a single financial market offering both commercial and investment banking products,\\" which \\"Glass‚ÄìSteagall sought to rule out.\\" Reinicke described this as \\"de facto repeal of Glass‚ÄìSteagall.\\"Reinicke 1995, pp. 114 and 124-125. No Federal Reserve Board order was necessary for Morgan Stanley to enter that \\"single financial market.\\" Glass‚ÄìSteagall only prohibited investment banks from taking deposits, not from making commercial loans, and the prohibition on taking deposits had \\"been circumvented by the development of deposit equivalents\\", such as the money market fund.Eaton 1995, pp. 1189 and 1201-1202. Glass‚ÄìSteagall also did not prevent investment banks from affiliating with nonbank banks or savings and loans.Eaton 1995, pp. 1202-1203. Citing this competitive \\"inequality,\\" before the Federal Reserve Board approved any Section 20 affiliates, four large bank holding companies that eventually received Section 20 affiliate approvals (Chase, J.P. Morgan, Citicorp, and Bankers Trust) had threatened to give up their banking charters if they were not given greater securities powers.Reinicke 1995, p. 93. Following the Federal Reserve Board's approvals of Section 20 affiliates a commentator concluded that the Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"wall\\" between commercial banking and \\"the securities and investment business\\" was \\"porous\\" for commercial banks and \\"nonexistent to investment bankers and other nonbank entities.\\"Eaton 1995, p. 1219. =Greenspan-led Federal Reserve Board= Alan Greenspan had replaced Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board when Proxmire sent his 1988 letter recommending the Federal Reserve Board expand the underwriting powers of Section 20 affiliates. Greenspan testified to Congress in December 1987, that the Federal Reserve Board supported Glass‚ÄìSteagall repeal.Reinicke 1995, p. 104. Greenspan 1987, p. 3. Although Paul Volcker \\"had changed his position\\" on Glass‚ÄìSteagall reform \\"considerably\\" during the 1980s, he was still \\"considered a conservative among the board members.\\" With Greenspan as Chairman, the Federal Reserve Board \\"spoke with one voice\\" in joining the FDIC and OCC in calling for Glass‚ÄìSteagall repeal.Reinicke 1995, p. 104. By 1987 Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"repeal\\" had come to mean repeal of Sections 20 and 32. The Federal Reserve Board supported \\"repeal\\" of Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"insofar as it prevents bank holding companies from being affiliated with firms engaged in securities underwriting and dealing activities.\\"Greenspan 1987, p. 3. The Board did not propose repeal of Glass Steagall Section 16 or 21. Bank holding companies, through separately capitalized subsidiaries, not commercial banks themselves directly, would exercise the new securities powers.Reinicke 1995, pp. 104-105. Greenspan 1987, pp. 3 and 15-22. . Banks and bank holding companies had already gained important regulatory approvals for securities activities before Paul Volcker retired as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board on August 11, 1987.. Aside from the Board's authorizations for Section 20 affiliates and for bank private placements of commercial paper, by 1987 federal banking regulators had authorized banks or their affiliates to (1) sponsor closed end investment companies,Fein 2011, ¬ß 1.04, pp. 1-9 to 1-12. . (2) sponsor mutual funds sold to customers in individual retirement accounts,Fein 2011, ¬ß 4.05[C] [4]. . (3) provide customers full service brokerage (i.e., advice and brokerage),Fein 2011, ¬ß 4.05[C] [5]. . and (4) sell bank assets through \\"securitizations.\\"Fein 2011, ¬ß 4.05[C] [8]. . In 1982 E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and a close Volcker colleague, published an influential essay titled \\"Are banks special?\\" in which he argued banks should be subject to special restrictions on affiliations because they enjoy special benefits (e.g., deposit insurance and Federal Reserve Bank loan facilities) and have special responsibilities (e.g., operating the payment system and influencing the money supply). The essay rejected the argument that it is \\"futile and unnecessary\\" to distinguish among the various types of companies in the \\"financial services industry.\\"Reinicke 1995, p. 69. . While Paul Volcker's January 1984, testimony to Congress repeated that banks are \\"special\\" in performing \\"a unique and critical role in the financial system and the economy,\\" he still testified in support of bank affiliates underwriting securities other than corporate bonds.Reinicke 1995, pp. 71 (for opposition to underwriting corporate bonds), 74 and 76. . In its 1986 Annual Report the Volcker led Federal Reserve Board recommended that Congress permit bank holding companies to underwrite municipal revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, and mutual funds and that Congress \\"undertake hearings or other studies in the area of corporate underwriting.\\". Reinicke 1995, p. 97. As described above, in the 1930s Glass‚ÄìSteagall advocates had alleged that bank affiliate underwriting of corporate bonds created \\"conflicts of interest.\\" In early 1987 E. Gerald Corrigan, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, recommended a legislative \\"overhaul\\" to permit \\"financial holding companies\\" that would \\"in time\\" provide banking, securities, and insurance services (as authorized by the GLBA 12 years later).Reinicke 1995, pp. 93 and 97-98. In 1990 Corrigan testified to Congress that he rejected the \\"status quo\\" and recommended allowing banks into the \\"securities business\\" through financial service holding companies.. Reinicke 1995, pp. 117 and 119. In 1991 Paul Volcker testified to Congress in support of the Bush Administration proposal to repeal Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32. Volcker rejected the Bush Administration proposal to permit affiliations between banks and commercial firms (i.e., non-financial firms) and added that legislation to allow banks greater insurance powers \\"could be put off until a later date.\\". =1991 Congressional action and \\"firewalls\\"= Paul Volcker gave his 1991 testimony as Congress considered repealing Glass‚ÄìSteagall sections 20 and 32 as part of a broader Bush Administration proposal to reform financial regulation.Reinicke 1995, pp. 120-124. In reaction to \\"market developments\\" and regulatory and judicial decisions that had \\"homogenized\\" commercial and investment banking, Representative Edward J. Markey (D-MA) had written a 1990 article arguing \\"Congress must amend Glass‚ÄìSteagall.\\"Markey 1990. As chairman of a subcommittee of the House Commerce and Energy Committee, Markey had joined with Committee Chairman Dingell in opposing the 1988 Proxmire Financial Modernization Act. In 1990, however, Markey stated Glass‚ÄìSteagall had \\"lost much of its effectiveness\\" through market, regulatory, and judicial developments that were \\"tantamount to an ill-coordinated, incremental repeal\\" of Glass‚ÄìSteagall. To correct this \\"disharmony\\" Markey proposed replacing Glass‚ÄìSteagall's \\"prohibitions\\" with \\"regulation.\\"Markey 1990, pp. 457-458 and 474-475. After the House Banking Committee approved a bill repealing Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32, Representative Dingell again stopped House action. He reached agreement with Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-TX) to insert into the bill \\"firewalls\\" that banks claimed would prevent real competition between banks and securities firms.. . The banking industry strongly opposed the bill in that form, and the House rejected it. The House debate revealed that Congress might agree on repealing Sections 20 and 32 while being divided on how bank affiliations with securities firms should be regulated.Reinicke 1995, pp. 122-124. Hendrickson 2001, pp. 862-864 (finding the same reason in 1988 and 1991). =1980s and 1990s bank product developments= Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, as Congress considered whether to \\"repeal\\" Glass‚ÄìSteagall, commercial banks and their affiliates engaged in activities that commentators later linked to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008.. Kotlikoff 2010, p. 151 (suggesting commercial bank CDO and SIV activities began after the 1999 GLBA). Securitization, CDOs, and \\"subprime\\" credit In 1978 Bank of America issued the first residential mortgage-backed security that securitized residential mortgages not guaranteed by a government-sponsored enterprise (\\"private label RMBS\\").. Also in 1978, the OCC approved a national bank, such as Bank of America, issuing pass- through certificates representing interests in residential mortgages and distributing such mortgage-backed securities to investors in a private placement. In 1987 the OCC ruled that Security Pacific Bank could \\"sell\\" assets through \\"securitizations\\" that transferred \\"cash flows\\" from those assets to investors and also distribute in a registered public offering the residential mortgage-backed securities issued in the securitization.Capatides 1992, pp. 98-105. Fein 2011, ¬ß 4.05[C] [15], pp. 4-61 to 4-63. This permitted commercial banks to acquire assets for \\"sale\\" through securitizations under what later became termed the \\"originate to distribute\\" model of banking.. The OCC ruled that a national bank's power to sell its assets meant a national bank could sell a pool of assets in a securitization, and even distribute the securities that represented the sale, as part of the \\"business of banking.\\"Fein 2011, ¬ß 4.05[C] [15], pp. 4-62. Capatides 1992, pp. 99-101. This meant national banks could underwrite and distribute securities representing such sales, even though Glass‚ÄìSteagall would generally prohibit a national bank underwriting or distributing non-governmental securities (i.e., non-\\"bank-eligible\\" securities).Fein 2011, ¬ß 4.05[C] [15], pp. 4-62. The federal courts upheld the OCC's approval of Security Pacific's securitization activities, with the Supreme Court refusing in 1990 to review a 1989 Second Circuit decision sustaining the OCC's action. In arguing that the GLBA's \\"repeal\\" of Glass‚ÄìSteagall played no role in the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, Melanie Fein notes courts had confirmed by 1990 the power of banks to securitize their assets under Glass‚ÄìSteagall.Fein 2011, ¬ß 1.02, pp. 1-7. The Second Circuit stated banks had been securitizing their assets for \\"ten years\\" before the OCC's 1987 approval of Security Pacific's securitization.Securities Industry Association v. Robert L. Clarke, 885 F.2d 1034, 1041 (for \\"ten years\\") (2d. Cir. 1989). As noted above, the OCC had approved such activity in 1978. Jan Kregel argues that the OCC's interpretation of the \\"incidental powers\\" of national banks \\"ultimately eviscerated Glass‚ÄìSteagall.\\" Continental Illinois Bank is often credited with issuing the first collateralized debt obligation (CDO) when, in 1987, it issued securities representing interests in a pool of \\"leveraged loans.\\"Capatides 1992, p. 102. . By the late 1980s Citibank had become a major provider of \\"subprime\\" mortgages and credit cards.Wilmarth 1995, pp. 57-59. Wilmarth 2002, pp. 401-402. Arthur Wilmarth argued that the ability to securitize such credits encouraged banks to extend more \\"subprime\\" credit.Wilmarth 1995, pp. 55-59. Wilmarth 2002, pp. 403-407. Wilmarth reported that during the 1990s credit card loans increased at a faster pace for lower- income households than higher-income households and that subprime mortgage loan volume quadrupled from 1993‚Äì99, before the GLBA became effective in 2000.Wilmarth 2002, pp. 392-393. In 1995 Wilmarth noted that commercial bank mortgage lenders differed from nonbank lenders in retaining \\"a significant portion of their mortgage loans\\" rather than securitizing the entire exposure.Wilmarth 1995, p. 56. Wilmarth also shared the bank regulator concern that commercial banks sold their \\"best assets\\" in securitizations and retained their riskiest assets.Wilmarth 2002, pp. 406-407. ABCP conduits and SIVs In the early 1980s commercial banks established asset backed commercial paper conduits (ABCP conduits) to finance corporate customer receivables. The ABCP conduit purchased receivables from the bank customer and issued asset-backed commercial paper to finance that purchase. The bank \\"advising\\" the ABCP conduit provided loan commitments and \\"credit enhancements\\" that supported repayment of the commercial paper. Because the ABCP conduit was owned by a third party unrelated to the bank, it was not an affiliate of the bank.Kavanaugh, Boemio & Edwards Jr. 1992, pp. 109-112. Through ABCP conduits banks could earn \\"fee income\\" and meet \\"customers' needs for credit\\" without \\"the need to maintain the amount of capital that would be required if loans were extended directly\\" to those customers.Kavanaugh, Boemio & Edwards Jr. 1992, p. 107. By the late 1980s Citibank had established ABCP conduits to buy securities. Such conduits became known as structured investment vehicles (SIVs).. The SIV's \\"arbitrage\\" opportunity was to earn the difference between the interest earned on the securities it purchased and the interest it paid on the ABCP and other securities it issued to fund those purchases.. OTC derivatives, including credit default swaps In the early 1980s commercial banks began entering into interest rate and currency exchange \\"swaps\\" with customers. This \\"over-the-counter derivatives\\" market grew dramatically throughout the 1980s and 1990s.. In 1996 the OCC issued \\"guidelines\\" for national bank use of \\"credit default swaps\\" and other \\"credit derivatives.\\" Banks entered into \\"credit default swaps\\" to protect against defaults on loans. Banks later entered into such swaps to protect against defaults on securities. Banks acted both as \\"dealers\\" in providing such protection (or speculative \\"exposure\\") to customers and as \\"hedgers\\" or \\"speculators\\" to cover (or create) their own exposures to such risks.. . Commercial banks became the largest dealers in swaps and other over-the- counter derivatives. Banking regulators ruled that swaps (including credit default swaps) were part of the \\"business of banking,\\" not \\"securities\\" under the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act.. . Commercial banks entered into swaps that replicated part or all of the economics of actual securities. Regulators eventually ruled banks could even buy and sell equity securities to \\"hedge\\" this activity. Jan Kregel argues the OCC's approval of bank derivatives activities under bank \\"incidental powers\\" constituted a \\"complete reversal of the original intention of preventing banks from dealing in securities on their own account.\\" Glass‚ÄìSteagall developments from 1995 to Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley Act =Leach and Rubin support for Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"repeal\\"; need to address \\"market realities\\"= On January 4, 1995, the new Chairman of the House Banking Committee, Representative James A. Leach (R-IA), introduced a bill to repeal Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32.. After being confirmed as Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin announced on February 28, 1995, that the Clinton Administration supported such Glass‚ÄìSteagall repeal.. Repeating themes from the 1980s, Leach stated Glass‚ÄìSteagall was \\"out of synch with reality\\". and Rubin argued \\"it is now time for the laws to reflect changes in the world's financial system.\\" Leach and Rubin expressed a widely shared view that Glass‚ÄìSteagall was \\"obsolete\\" or \\"outdated.\\"Hendrickson 2001, p. 879. Wilmarth 2008, pp. 561-562. (\\"Throughout the debate, Glass‚ÄìSteagall was derided as an old-fashioned law out of step with modern finance\\"). As described above, Senator Proxmire and Representative Markey (despite their long-time support for Glass‚ÄìSteagall) had earlier expressed the same conclusion. With his reputation for being \\"conservative\\" on expanded bank activities, former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker remained an influential commentator on legislative proposals to permit such activities.. (\\"Mr. Volcker, who still carries considerable weight on Capitol Hill\\"). . . Volcker continued to testify to Congress in opposition to permitting banks to affiliate with commercial companies and in favor of repealing Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32 as part of \\"rationalizing\\" bank involvement in securities markets.. (\\"I have argued this morning the logic and practical desirability of finally eliminating Glass‚ÄìSteagall restrictions\\"). Supporting the Leach and Rubin arguments, Volcker testified that Congressional inaction had forced banking regulators and the courts to play \\"catch-up\\" with market developments by \\"sometimes stretching established interpretations of law beyond recognition.\\". In 1997 Volcker testified this meant the \\"Glass‚ÄìSteagall separation of commercial and investment banking is now almost gone\\" and that this \\"accommodation and adaptation has been necessary and desirable.\\". He stated, however, that the \\"ad hoc approach\\" had created \\"uneven results\\" that created \\"almost endless squabbling in the courts\\" and an \\"increasingly advantageous position competitively\\" for \\"some sectors of the financial service industry and particular institutions.\\" Similar to the GAO in 1988 and Representative Markey in 1990 Volcker asked that Congress \\"provide clear and decisive leadership that reflects not parochial pleadings but the national interest.\\" Reflecting the regulatory developments Volcker noted, the commercial and investment banking industries largely reversed their traditional Glass‚ÄìSteagall positions. Throughout the 1990s (and particularly in 1996), commercial banking firms became content with the regulatory situation Volcker described. They feared \\"financial modernization\\" legislation might bring an unwelcome change.Fein 2011, ¬ß 1.02, p. 1-6. Hendrickson 2001, pp. 867-869. . Securities firms came to view Glass‚ÄìSteagall more as a barrier to expanding their own commercial banking activities than as protection from commercial bank competition. The securities industry became an advocate for \\"financial modernization\\" that would open a \\"two-way street\\" for securities firms to enter commercial banking.Fein 2011, ¬ß 1.02, pp. 1-6. Fisher 2001, p. 1302, fn. 6. Levitt 1998 (\\"A Competitive Two-Way Street\\"). =Status of arguments from 1980s= While the need to create a legal framework for existing bank securities activities became a dominant theme for the \\"financial modernization\\" legislation supported by Leach, Rubin, Volcker, and others, after the GLBA repealed Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32 in 1999, commentators identified four main arguments for repeal: (1) increased economies of scale and scope, (2) reduced risk through diversification of activities, (3) greater convenience and lower cost for consumers, and (4) improved ability of U.S. financial firms to compete with foreign firms.Wilmarth 2002, p. 223. . Focarelli, Marques-Ibanez, Pozzolo 2011, pp. 6-7. By 1995, however, some of these concerns (which had been identified by the Congressional Research Service in 1987) seemed less important. As Japanese banks declined and U.S.-based banks were more profitable, \\"international competitiveness\\" did not seem to be a pressing issue.Mayer 1997, pp. 387-389 and 446-447. International rankings of banks by size also seemed less important when, as Alan Greenspan later noted, \\"Federal Reserve research had been unable to find economies of scale in banking beyond a modest size.\\"Greenspan 2010, p. 33. Wilmarth 1995, pp. 14-26. Still, advocates of \\"financial modernization\\" continued to point to the combination of commercial and investment banking in nearly all other countries as an argument for \\"modernization\\", including Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"repeal.\\" Litan and Rauch 1998, pp. 88-92. Similarly, the failure of the Sears Financial Network and other nonbank \\"financial supermarkets\\" that had seemed to threaten commercial banks in the 1980s undermined the argument that financial conglomerates would be more efficient than \\"specialized\\" financial firms.Wilmarth 2002, pp. 223-224, 284, and 425-428. Mayer 1997, pp. 23-24. Critics questioned the \\"diversification benefits\\" of combining commercial and investment banking activities. Some questioned whether the higher variability of returns in investment banking would stabilize commercial banking firms through \\"negative correlation\\" (i.e., cyclical downturns in commercial and investment banking occurring at different times) or instead increase the probability of the overall banking firm failing.Garten 1993, pp. 164-166. Others questioned whether any theoretical benefits in holding a passive \\"investment portfolio\\" combining commercial and investment banking would be lost in managing the actual combination of such activities.Garten 1993, pp. 163-164. Wilmarth 2002, pp. 439-440. Critics also argued that specialized, highly competitive commercial and investment banking firms were more efficient in competitive global markets.Garten 1993, p. 195. Wilmarth 2002, pp. 440-444. Starting in the late 1980s, John H. Boyd, a staff member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, consistently questioned the value of size and product diversification in banking.Stern and Feldman 2004, p. 77. Reinicke 1995, p. 112, fn. 105. In 1999, as Congress was considering legislation that became the GLBA, he published an essay arguing that the \\"moral hazard\\" created by deposit insurance, too big to fail (TBTF) considerations, and other governmental support for banking should be resolved before commercial banking firms could be given \\"universal banking\\" powers.. Although Boyd's 1999 essay was directed at \\"universal banking\\" that permitted commercial banks to own equity interests in non-financial firms (i.e., \\"commercial firms\\"), the essay was interpreted more broadly to mean that \\"expanding bank powers, by, for example, allowing nonbank firms to affiliate with banks, prior to undertaking reforms limiting TBTF-like coverage for uninsured bank creditors is putting the 'cart before the horse.'\\"Stern and Feldman 2004, p. 77. Despite these arguments, advocates of \\"financial modernization\\" predicted consumers and businesses would enjoy cost savings and greater convenience in receiving financial services from integrated \\"financial services firms.\\" Litan and Rauch 1998, pp. 88-92. After the GLBA repealed Sections 20 and 32, commentators also noted the importance of scholarly attacks on the historic justifications for Glass‚ÄìSteagall as supporting repeal efforts.Wilmarth 2008, p. 562. Focarelli, Marques-Ibanez, Pozzolo 2011, pp. 6-7. Throughout the 1990s, scholars continued to produce empirical studies concluding that commercial bank affiliate underwriting before Glass‚ÄìSteagall had not demonstrated the \\"conflicts of interest\\" and other defects claimed by Glass‚ÄìSteagall proponents.. Barth et al. 2000, p.1. By the late 1990s a \\"remarkably broad academic consensus\\" existed that Glass‚ÄìSteagall had been \\"thoroughly discredited.\\". Wilmarth 2008, p. 562. . Although he rejected this scholarship, Martin Mayer wrote in 1997 that since the late 1980s it had been \\"clear\\" that continuing the Glass‚ÄìSteagall prohibitions was only \\"permitting a handful of large investment houses and hedge funds to charge monopoly rents for their services without protecting corporate America, investors, or the banks.\\"Mayer 1997, p. 429.Hyman Minsky, who disputed the benefits of \\"universal banking,\\" wrote in 1995 testimony prepared for Congress that \\"repeal of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act, in itself, would neither benefit nor harm the economy of the United States to any significant extent.\\". . In 1974 Mayer had quoted Minsky as stating a 1971 presidential commission (the \\"Hunt Commission\\") was repeating the errors of history when it proposed relaxing Glass‚ÄìSteagall and other legislation from the 1930s.Mayer 1974, pp. 521-524. With banking commentators such as Mayer and Minsky no longer opposing Glass‚ÄìSteagall repeal, consumer and community development advocates became the most prominent critics of repeal and of financial \\"modernization\\" in general. Helen Garten argued that bank regulation became dominated by \\"consumer\\" issues, which produced \\"a largely unregulated, sophisticated wholesale market and a highly regulated, retail consumer market.\\"Garten 1999, p. 293. In the 1980s Representative Fernand St. Germain (D-RI), as chairman of the House Banking Committee, sought to tie any Glass‚ÄìSteagall reform to requirements for free or reduced cost banking services for the elderly and poor.Reinicke 1995, pp. 80 and 109. Democratic Representatives and Senators made similar appeals in the 1990s.. . During Congressional hearings to consider the various Leach bills to repeal Sections 20 and 32, consumer and community development advocates warned against the concentration of \\"economic power\\" that would result from permitting \\"financial conglomerates\\" and argued that any repeal of Sections 20 and 32 should mandate greater consumer protections, particularly free or low cost consumer services, and greater community reinvestment requirements.Mattingly and Fallon 1998, pp. 66-69. . =Failed 1995 Leach bill; expansion of Section 20 affiliate activities; merger of Travelers and Citicorp= By 1995 the ability of banks to sell insurance was more controversial than Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"repeal.\\" Representative Leach tried to avoid conflict with the insurance industry by producing a limited \\"modernization\\" bill that repealed Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32, but did not change the regulation of bank insurance activities.. Leach's efforts to separate insurance from securities powers failed when the insurance agent lobby insisted any banking law reform include limits on bank sales of insurance.Hendrickson 2001, pp. 865-866. . Similar to Senator Proxmire in 1988, Representative Leach responded to the House's inaction on his Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"repeal\\" bill by writing the Federal Reserve Board in June 1996 encouraging it to increase the limit on Section 20 affiliate bank-ineligible revenue.Fein 2011, ¬ß 1.06[F], pp. 1-39. . When the Federal Reserve Board increased the limit to 25% in December 1996, the Board noted the Securities Industry Association (SIA) had complained this would mean even the largest Wall Street securities firms could affiliate with commercial banks.. . The SIA's prediction proved accurate two years later when the Federal Reserve Board applied the 25% bank-ineligible revenue test in approving Salomon Smith Barney (SSB) becoming an affiliate of Citibank through the merger of Travelers and Citicorp to form the Citigroup bank holding company. The Board noted that, although SSB was one of the largest US securities firms, less than 25% of its revenue was \\"bank-ineligible.\\". Simpson Thacher 1998, p. 4. Citigroup could only continue to own the Travelers insurance underwriting business for two (or, with Board approval, five) years unless the Bank Holding Company Act was amended (as it was through the GLBA) to permit affiliations between banks and underwriters of property, casualty, and life insurance. Citigroup's ownership of SSB, however, was permitted without any law change under the Federal Reserve Board's existing Section 20 affiliate rules.Simpson Thacher 1998, pp. 1-6. Lockner and Hansche 2000, p. 37. Macey 2000, p. 718. In 2003, Charles Geisst, a Glass‚ÄìSteagall supporter, told Frontline the Federal Reserve Board's Section 20 orders meant the Federal Reserve \\"got rid of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act.\\" Former Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman Alan Blinder agreed the 1996 action increasing \\"bank-ineligible\\" revenue limits was \\"tacit repeal\\" of Glass‚ÄìSteagall, but argued \\"that the market had practically repealed Glass‚ÄìSteagall, anyway.\\" Shortly after approving the merger of Citicorp and Travelers, the Federal Reserve Board announced its intention to eliminate the 28 \\"firewalls\\" that required separation of Section 20 affiliates from their affiliated bank and to replace them with \\"operating standards\\" based on 8 of the firewalls. The change permitted banks to lend to fund purchases of, and otherwise provide credit support to, securities underwritten by their Section 20 affiliates.. Rodelli 1998, pp. 321-326. This left Federal Reserve Act Sections 23A (which originated in the 1933 Banking Act and regulated extensions of credit between a bank and any nonbank affiliate) and 23B (which required all transactions between a bank and its nonbank affiliates to be on \\"arms-length\\" market terms) as the primary restrictions on banks providing credit to Section 20 affiliates or to securities underwritten by those affiliates.Shull and White 1998, p. 8. Rodelli 1998, p. 335. Sections 23A and B remained the primary restrictions on commercial banks extending credit to securities affiliates, or to securities underwritten by such affiliates, after the GLBA repealed Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32.Omarova 2011. . =1997-98 legislative developments: commercial affiliations and Community Reinvestment Act= In 1997 Representative Leach again sponsored a bill to repeal Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32. At first the main controversy was whether to permit limited affiliations between commercial firms and commercial banks.Fein 2011, ¬ß 1.06[F], pp. 1-40 to 1-41. . Securities firms (and other financial services firms) complained that unless they could retain their affiliations with commercial firms (which the Bank Holding Company Act forbid for a commercial bank), they would not be able to compete equally with commercial banks.Mattingly and Fallon 1998, p. 34. . The Clinton Administration proposed that Congress either permit a small \\"basket\\" of commercial revenue for bank holding companies or that it retain the \\"unitary thrift loophole\\" that permitted a commercial firm to own a single savings and loan.. . Representative Leach, House Banking Committee Ranking Member Henry Gonzalez (D-TX), and former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker opposed such commercial affiliations.. (\\"permitting banks or bank holding companies to extend their activities into commerce and industry -- contrary to Anglo-Saxon traditions of finance -- would be directly contrary\\" to \\"the need for strong structural protection against conflicts of interest in the provision of credit and undue concentration of resources.\\") Meanwhile, in 1997 Congressional Quarterly reported Senate Banking Committee Chairman Al D'Amato (R-NY) rejected Treasury Department pressure to produce a financial modernization bill because banking firms (such as Citicorp) were satisfied with the competitive advantages they had received from regulatory actions and were not really interested in legislative reforms.. Reflecting the process Paul Volcker had described, as financial reform legislation was considered throughout 1997 and early 1998, Congressional Quarterly reported how different interests groups blocked legislation and sought regulatory advantages.. . The \\"compromise bill\\" the House Republican leadership sought to bring to a vote in March 1998, was opposed by the commercial banking industry as favoring the securities and insurance industries.Hendrickson 2001, pp. 868-869. . The House Republican leadership withdrew the bill in response to the banking industry opposition, but vowed to bring it back when Congress returned from recess.. Commentators describe the April 6, 1998, merger announcement between Travelers and Citicorp as the catalyst for the House passing that bill by a single vote (214-213) on May 13, 1998.Hendrickson 2001, p. 869. Fein 2011, ¬ß 1.06[G], pp. 1-42. . Citicorp, which had opposed the bill in March, changed its position to support the bill along with the few other large commercial banking firms that had supported it in March for improving their ability to compete with \\"foreign banks.\\". . The Clinton Administration issued a veto threat for the House passed bill, in part because the bill would eliminate \\"the longstanding right of unitary thrift holding companies to engage in any lawful business,\\" but primarily because the bill required national banks to conduct expanded activities through holding company subsidiaries rather than the bank \\"operating subsidiaries\\" authorized by the OCC in 1996.Hendrickson 2001, p. 869. . . On September 11, 1998, the Senate Banking Committee approved a bipartisan bill with unanimous Democratic member support that, like the House- passed bill, would have repealed Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32.. , pp. 3, 6, 19, and (for Democratic member statement) 53-58. The bill was blocked from Senate consideration by the Committee's two dissenting members (Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Richard Shelby (R-AL)), who argued it expanded the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Four Democratic senators (Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Russell Feingold (D-WI), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), and Paul Wellstone (D-MN)) stated they opposed the bill for its repeal of Sections 20 and 32.. =1999 Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley Act= In 1999 the main issues confronting the new Leach bill to repeal Sections 20 and 32 were (1) whether bank subsidiaries (\\"operating subsidiaries\\") or only nonbank owned affiliates could exercise new securities and other powers and (2) how the CRA would apply to the new \\"financial holding companies\\" that would have such expanded powers., p. 1. The Clinton Administration agreed with Representative Leach in supporting \\"the continued separation of banking and commerce.\\". The Senate Banking Committee approved in a straight party line 11-9 vote a bill (S. 900) sponsored by Senator Gramm that would have repealed Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32 and that did not contain the CRA provisions in the Committee's 1998 bill. The nine dissenting Democratic Senators, along with Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-SD), proposed as an alternative (S. 753) the text of the 1998 Committee bill with its CRA provisions and the repeal of Sections 20 and 32, modified to provide greater permission for \\"operating subsidiaries\\" as requested by the Treasury Department.. . S. 753, 106th Congress, First Session, p. 7, Section 101. Through a partisan 54-44 vote on May 6, 1999 (with Senator Fritz Hollings (D-SC) providing the only Democratic Senator vote in support), the Senate passed S. 900. The day before, Senate Republicans defeated (in a 54-43 vote) a Democratic sponsored amendment to S. 900 that would have substituted the text of S. 753 (also providing for the repeal of Glass‚ÄìSteagall Sections 20 and 32).. Amendment No. 302, Congressional Record, S4682 (May 4, 1999), Section 101, p. S4683. Senate debate and vote on Amendment No. 302, Congressional Record, S. 4736-4743 (May 5, 1999). On July 1, 1999, the House of Representatives passed (in a bipartisan 343-86 vote) a bill (H.R. 10) that repealed Sections 20 and 32. The Clinton Administration issued a statement supporting H.R. 10 because (unlike the Senate passed S. 900) it accepted the bill's CRA and operating subsidiary provisions.. . . On October 13, 1999, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department agreed that direct subsidiaries of national banks (\\"financial subsidiaries\\") could conduct securities activities, but that bank holding companies would need to engage in merchant banking, insurance, and real estate development activities through holding company, not bank, subsidiaries., pp. 1-2. On October 22, 1999, Senator Gramm and the Clinton Administration agreed a bank holding company could only become a \\"financial holding company\\" (and thereby enjoy the new authority to affiliate with insurance and securities firms) if all its bank subsidiaries had at least a \\"satisfactory\\" CRA rating., pp. 1-2. . After these compromises, a joint Senate and House Conference Committee reported out a final version of S. 900 that was passed on November 4, 1999, by the House in a vote of 362-57 and by the Senate in a vote of 90-8. President Clinton signed the bill into law on November 12, 1999, as the Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (GLBA).. . The GLBA repealed Sections 20 and 32 of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act, not Sections 16 and 21.Macey 2000, p. 716. Wilmarth 2002, p. 219, fn. 5. The GLBA also amended Section 16 to permit \\"well capitalized\\" commercial banks to underwrite municipal revenue bonds (i.e., non-general obligation bonds),. . as first approved by the Senate in 1967. Otherwise, Sections 16 and 21 remained in effect regulating the direct securities activities of banks and prohibiting securities firms from taking deposits. After March 11, 2000, bank holding companies could expand their securities and insurance activities by becoming \\"financial holding companies.\\". .

In the late 20th and early 21st century, plants were often taken into space in low Earth orbit to be grown in a weightless but pressurized controlled environment, sometimes called space gardens. In the context of human spaceflight, they can be consumed as food and/or provide a refreshing atmosphere. Plants can metabolize carbon dioxide in the air to produce valuable oxygen, and can help control cabin humidity. Growing plants in space may provide a psychological benefit to human spaceflight crews. Usually the plants were part of studies or technical development to further develop space gardens or conduct science experiments. To date plants taken into space have had mostly scientific interest, with only limited contributions to the functionality of the spacecraft, however the Apollo Moon tree project was more or less forestry inspired mission and the trees part of a country's bicentennial celebration. The first challenge in growing plants in space is how to get plants to grow without gravity. This runs into difficulties regarding the effects of gravity on root development, providing appropriate types of lighting, and other challenges. In particular, the nutrient supply to root as well as the nutrient biogeochemical cycles, and the microbiological interactions in soil-based substrates are particularly complex, but have been shown to make possible space farming in hypo- and micro-gravity. NASA plans to grow plants in space to help feed astronauts, and to provide psychological benefits for long-term space flight. In 2017, aboard ISS in one plant growth device, the 5th crop of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa) from it included an allotment for crew consumption, while the rest was saved for study. An early discussion of plants in space, were the trees on the brick moon space station, in the 1869 short story \\"The Brick Moon\\".  History  Vegetable Production System for ISS being discussed In the 2010s there was an increased desire for long-term space missions, which lead to desire for space-based plant production as food for astronauts. An example of this is vegetable production on the International Space Station in Earth orbit. By the year 2010, 20 plant growth experiments had been conducted aboard the International Space Station. Several experiments have been focused on how plant growth and distribution compares in micro-gravity, space conditions versus Earth conditions. This enables scientists to explore whether certain plant growth patterns are innate or environmentally driven. For instance, Allan H. Brown tested seedling movements aboard the in 1983. Sunflower seedling movements were recorded while in orbit. They observed that the seedlings still experienced rotational growth and circumnation despite lack of gravity, showing these behaviors are instinctual. Other experiments have found that plants have the ability exhibit gravitropism, even in low-gravity conditions. For instance, the ESA's European Modular Cultivation System enables experimentation with plant growth; acting as a miniature greenhouse, scientists aboard the International Space Station can investigate how plants react in variable-gravity conditions.The Gravi-1 experiment (2008) utilized the EMCS to study lentil seedling growth and amyloplast movement on the calcium-dependent pathways. The results of this experiment found that the plants were able to sense the direction of gravity even at very low levels. A later experiment with the EMCS placed 768 lentil seedlings in a centrifuge to stimulate various gravitational changes; this experiment, Gravi-2 (2014), displayed that plants change calcium signalling towards root growth while being grown in several gravity levels. Many experiments have a more generalized approach in observing overall plant growth patterns as opposed to one specific growth behavior. One such experiment from the Canadian Space Agency, for example, found that white spruce seedlings grew differently in the anti-gravity space environment compared with Earth-bound seedlings; the space seedlings exhibited enhanced growth from the shoots and needles, and also had randomized amyloplast distribution compared with the Earth-bound control group. =Early efforts= The first organisms in space were \\"specially developed strains of seeds\\" launched to on 9 July 1946 on a U.S. launched V-2 rocket. These samples were not recovered. The first seeds launched into space and successfully recovered were maize seeds launched on 30 July 1946. Soon followed rye and cotton. These early suborbital biological experiments were handled by Harvard University and the Naval Research Laboratory and were concerned with radiation exposure on living tissue. In 1971, 500 tree seeds (Loblolly pine, Sycamore, Sweetgum, Redwood, and Douglas fir) were flown around the Moon on Apollo 14. These Moon trees were planted and grown with controls back on Earth where no changes were detected. = Space station era = The arugula-like lettuce Mizuna growing for Veg-03 A young sunflower plant aboard the ISS In 1982, the crew of the Soviet Salyut 7 space station conducted an experiment, prepared by Lithuanian scientists (Alfonsas Merkys and others), and grew some Arabidopsis using Fiton-3 experimental micro- greenhouse apparatus, thus becoming the first plants to flower and produce seeds in space. A Skylab experiment studied the effects of gravity and light on rice plants. The SVET-2 Space Greenhouse successfully achieved seed to seed plant growth in 1997 aboard space station Mir. Bion 5 carried Daucus carota and Bion 7 carried maize (aka corn). Plant research continued on the International Space Station. Biomass Production System was used on the ISS Expedition 4. The Vegetable Production System (Veggie) system was later used aboard ISS. Plants tested in Veggie before going into space included lettuce, Swiss chard, radishes, Chinese cabbage and peas. Red Romaine lettuce was grown in space on Expedition 40 which were harvested when mature, frozen and tested back on Earth. Expedition 44 members became the first American astronauts to eat plants grown in space on 10 August 2015, when their crop of Red Romaine was harvested. Since 2003 Russian cosmonauts have been eating half of their crop while the other half goes towards further research. In 2012, a sunflower bloomed aboard the ISS under the care of NASA astronaut Donald Pettit. In January 2016, US astronauts announced that a zinnia had blossomed aboard the ISS.Behold the first flower to bloom in space, a cheerful zinnia, Cnet, 18 January 2016 In 2017 the Advanced Plant Habitat was designed for ISS, which was a nearly self-sustaining plant growth system for that space station in low Earth orbit. The system is installed in parallel with another plant grown system aboard the station, VEGGIE, and a major difference with that system is that APH is designed to need less upkeep by humans. APH is supported by the Plant Habitat Avionics Real-Time Manager. Some plants that were to be tested in APH include Dwarf Wheat and Arabidopsis. In December 2017 hundreds of seeds were delivered to ISS for growth in the VEGGIE system. In 2018 the Veggie-3 experiment was tested with plant pillows and root mats. One of the goals is to grow food for crew consumption. Crops tested at this time include cabbage, lettuce, and mizuna. In 2018, the PONDS system for nutrient deliver in microgravity was tested. In December 2018, the German Aerospace Center launched the EuCROPIS satellite into low Earth orbit. This mission carries two greenhouses intended to grow tomatoes under simulated gravities of the Moon and Mars using by-products of human presence in space as source of nutrients. Chang'e 4 lunar lander in January 2019, carried a sealed \\"biosphere\\" with seeds and insect eggs to test whether plants and insects could hatch and grow together in synergy. The experiment included seeds of potatoes, tomatoes, and Arabidopsis thaliana (a flowering plant), as well as silkworm eggs. These became the first plants grown on the Moon. Environmental systems will keep the container hospitable and Earth-like, except for the low lunar gravity.China Is About to Land Living Eggs on the Far Side of the Moon. Yasmin Tayag, Inverse. 2 January 2019. If the eggs hatch, the larvae would produce carbon dioxide, while the germinated plants would release oxygen through photosynthesis. It is hoped that together, the plants and silkworms can establish a simple synergy within the container. A miniature camera will photograph any growth. The biological experiment was designed by 28 Chinese universities.Chang'e-4: China mission primed for landing on Moon's far side. Paul Rincon, BBC News. 2 January 2019.

Club career Mayano, as he is popularly known, made his PSL debut at the beginning of the 2012/2013 season for Free State Stars F.C. from clubs feeder development side Carara Kicks F.C.. Luyolo would go on to become the club's prominent figure for the next few seasons due to his ball controlling ability, vision and pace, winning the club's rookie of the season award and helping the team to a top 8 finish. At the start of 2013/2014 season he was strongly linked with Kaizer Chiefs F.C. but the move never materialized. At the end of that season Nomandela joined Mamelodi Sundowns F.C. on a 4-year deal. He made just a few off the appearances for the club under coach Pitso Mosimane, being mostly in the side's development squad in the Multichoice Diski Challenge While still contracted to Mamelodi Sundowns F.C. he had loan spells with Moroka Swallows F.C. and Jomo Cosmos F.C. with both clubs suffering relegations one year apart, while Nomandela played for the clubs. In October 2016 Nomandela and Mamelodi Sundowns F.C. reached an agreement to part ways with the player surfacing at Cape Town City F.C. shortly after announcement. His stint in the mother city was also a less successful one having made very few appearances off the bench under Eric Tinkler. Before the end of the 2016/2017 PSL campaign, in April 2016 Cape Town City F.C. announced that they had parted ways with the player for undisclosed reasons. At the beginning of the 2017/2018 NFD campaign, Nomandela was unveiled by Mthatha Bucks F.C. as part of their plan to try and return to the PSL after more than a decade of absence. It was soon reported that player had been suspended by the club for disciplinary reasons leaving many of his supporters and admirers blaming it all on the big money move he made to Mamelodi Sundowns F.C. in the winter transfer window of 2014 which, in the opinion of many, was the beginning of the end of his career. On 16 January 2019, Nomandela joined Baberwa FC.Ex- Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Luyolo Nomandela joins Baberwa, kickoff.com, 16 January 2019 International career He made his first national team appearance under Gordon Igesund in the summer of 2013 scoring on debut against Burkina Faso.

The loan closet may be offered through an organization, an individual, or some other entity, often a non-profit organization. Because medical equipment is expensive and often needed for only a short time, loan closets help people receive equipment that they may not otherwise be able to afford. Process Typically a loan closet receives donated equipment from people who no longer need it. The loan closet will then clean and check the equipment and make it available to another person. Depending on the particular loan closet, the equipment may be loaned out for a set period of time, for as long as the person needs it or, in some cases it may be given away. When the equipment is returned, it is cleaned again and checked for safety and is then made available for the next person. The medical equipment available varies from one loan closet to another. Clients The requirements to use a loan closet vary. Some loan closets are only available to certain groups of people such as senior citizens or veterans. Others may only serve people with a particular disease or condition, such as ALS, multiple sclerosis, cancer, or cerebral palsy. A person may also need to reside in a particular geographical area, belong to a certain organization, or have an income below a certain level. Sponsors Loan closets may be sponsored by churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, senior centers, or fire stations. An individual may also loan out medical equipment on an informal basis. There are many non-profit organizations whose sole purpose is to loan out home medical equipment to those in need. Contributions Loan closets are dependent on contributors for the equipment which they lend out. Loan closets can be found through social workers, hospital discharge staff, and physicians' offices. Not all loan closets accept all donations and arrangements may need to be made in advance before donations are accepted.

It borders the Don River to the east. It was built on remediated industrial lands to be the centrepiece of a new emerging neighbourhood in downtown Toronto. It also provides a barrier to flooding from the Don River. History The West Don Lands, including what is now the Corktown Common, was once an industrialized area, once notably occupied by the pork processing plants of the William Davies Company and acres of railyards. After mergers in the packed meat industry, pork processing moved gradually away from the site. By the 1970s, much of the land was left abandoned. In 1987, the West Don Lands was expropriated by the Government of Ontario in order to build a new community known as Atatiri. The industrial history meant the soil was highly polluted and needed expensive cleanup before any residents could live there. The risk of flooding from the Don River also required a flood barrier to be erected. By 1992 the city and province had already invested some $350 million in purchasing and clearing the site, and new estimates put the final cost at more than a billion more. The real estate market had also collapsed, making any private investment unlikely. The new Ontario government of Bob Rae thus decided to cancel the project in 1992 and the West Don Lands was left deserted for the next 15 years. In the 2000s, the site was shown renewed interest after the formation of Waterfront Toronto, a joint venture of the City of Toronto, the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada. The agency's purpose was to reclaim the waterfront for development after decades of decay. The announcement of Toronto winning the 2015 Pan American Games meant that the governments would spend money to reclaim the area for the Games Athletes' Village, before reallocating the buildings for private residential usage. The Commons site itself is located in the flood plain of the Don River and required soil remediation. Also, the Athletes' Village and surrounding site required the building of flood protection before any development could occur. The Common's berm is a flood protection landform which was started in 2007 and was necessary before any other development of the West Don Lands could occur. The berm also meant clean soil was brought to the site to make it suitable for recreation. Corktown Common July 2013 Park description The Corktown Common was a project and it is a hilly park with pathways and prairie grasses, overlooking the mouth of the Don River, which doubles as a -high berm designed to protect the eastern downtown from a major flood, even a 500-year storm by shunting potential flood waters south toward the lake. Its name before it opened was the Don River Park. The park was designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, and opened with over 700 trees and thousands of shrubs and grasses that are native to Southern Ontario's Carolinian forest ecosystem. The park contains playgrounds, a splash pad, an athletic field, open lawns, a marsh, tables, benches, a barbecue, a fireplace, bike paths, a boardwalk and an off-leash dog area. There is a public art sculpture titled No Shoes by Mark di Suvero. On the river side of the park, there is a 3.2 hectare (7.9 acre) urban prairie. The Corktown Common is located east of Bayview Avenue, south of King Street, west of GO/CN railroad lines and the Don River to the rail corridor in the south.

It was released on October 25, 2013 in Europe on October 29 in the United States via Nuclear Blast.http://loudwire.com/sepultura-art-track-list-new-album/ The album is based on the 1927 science fiction film Metropolis; its title is a quote from the film. It is the band's first album to feature drummer Eloy Casagrande, and the first album by the band to be recorded in the United States since 1998's Against. The album was produced by Ross Robinson, who previously produced the band's 1996 album Roots. Background The band hinted at a thirteenth studio album as early as May 2012, when guitarist Andreas Kisser told Metal Underground that Sepultura would soon \\"start working on something new with [new drummer who joined in 2011] Eloy [Casagrande]\\" and see if they could \\"get ready for new music early next year.\\" Later, Kisser revealed that Sepultura was \\"already thinking about new ideas\\" for their next album and was going to \\"have something new going on\\" in 2013. On December 10, 2012, producer Ross Robinson, who produced Sepultura's Roots album, hinted on Twitter that he would be producing the new album, tweeting: \\"Oh, didn't mention.. Spoke to Andreas, it's on. My vision, smoke Roots- It can be done\\", which was later confirmed with another announcement that Steve Evetts would be co-producing the album. By April 2013, the band had 13 songs in development, with Kisser commenting positively about the progress of the album, saying: \\"This is the first time writing with Eloy Casagrande on drums and everything sounds fresh(...)You'll just have to wait to hear it. It's very difficult to describe what we're doing, but I can say that will be one of the strongest Sepultura albums to date.\\" In May, vocalist Derrick Green reported \\"We have written most of the music already and now we are working on lyrics for the album. We should have everything ready before we hit the studio June 1st.\\" On June 10, during the recording of the album, the band announced that they had six songs recorded for the album, and according to Kisser, they were \\"going in a rate of two songs a day\\". Later that month, it was announced that former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo would make a guest appearance on the album, with Kisser explaining \\"When the mics were all ready and running Eloy and Dave started playing and the magic was on, so great! The part they recorded will be a special part on the middle of one of the songs, it came out crazy!\\" On July 12, it was announced that the band has completed recording the album, and a week later, they announced that it would be called The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart.

They also commented positively on the input of new drummer Eloy Casagrande, with Green explaining \\"It's been great working with Eloy in the writing process because it brings a whole different energy to the music. The many changes that have been going on in our lives and in the world also add to the making of the new album.\\" Concept Guitarist Andreas Kisser said of the album title: \\"I was inspired by a phrase which is the main message of the story: ‚ÄúThe mediator between the head and hands must be the heart‚Äù to express what we are saying on the lyrics.\\" Although the album was inspired by the 1927 film Metropolis, it is not intended to be a concept album, unlike two of the band's previous studio albums, Dante XXI (based on Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy) and A-Lex (based on the 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess). As guitarist Andreas Kisser explains: > \\"In the movie, a crazy millionaire wants to transform a robot into a real > person. That's kind of the opposite of what we live today. More than ever we > are robotized, through the worldwide web, Google glasses, chips under our > skins and the globalized slavery our society suffers nowadays.

It is rod-shaped, obligately anaerobic, non-fermentative, has flagellum and type four pili, and is closely related to Geobacter metallireducens. Geobacter sulfurreducens is an anaerobic species of bacteria that comes from the family of bacteria called Geobacteraceae. Under the genus of Geobacter, G. sulfurreducens is one out of twenty different species. The Geobacter genus was discovered by Dr. Derek R. Lovely in 1987. G. sulfurreducens was first isolated in Norman, Oklahoma, USA from materials found around the surface of a contaminated ditch.  Characteristics  Geobacter sulfurreducens and its bacterial nanowires Geobacter sulfurreducens is a rod-shaped microbe with a gram-negative cell wall. Geobacter is known as a type of bacteria that is able to conduct levels of electricity, and the species G. sulfurreducens is also known as ‚Äúelectricigens‚Äù due to their ability to create an electric current and produce electricity. A study by Daniel Bond and Derek Lovely in 2003 showed that because of G. sulfurreducens‚Äô ability to conduct electricity, there was a possibility of creating an effective and long lasting microbial fuel cell (MFC). This study proved successful, as it was found that because G. sulfurreducens cells are successful at conducting electricity and changing electrons into electricity, it was also found that this made it possible to have electricity conducted for long periods of time. Due to these findings, organizations such as the World Bank have been heavily funding projects in countries such as Tanzania and Namibia in which they work to harness G. sulfurreducens to run on waste products in order to have electricity for lights and for the charging of batteries. G. sulfurreducens could be useful in bioremediation of uranium- contaminated groundwater.  Genome  G. sulfurreducens consists of a genome with one single circular chromosome and that single chromosome contains 3,814,139 base pairs (bp). The fact that this microbe has a circular chromosome is a further indication that it is a normal prokaryote, identified as a bacterium. It is predicted that G. sulfurreducens contains 3466 coding sequences, with the average size of these coding sequences being 989 base pairs. The microbe contains a high number of c-type cytochromes, which are utilized for electron transport proteins. There is a hypothesis that due to its genomic make up, G. sulfurreducens is able to identify surfaces and can construct biofilms that are able to conduct electricity by utilizing its ability to transport electrons. Overall, the genomic make up of G. sulfurreducens appears to support the current understanding of the ways in which the microbe is able to metabolize easily and transport electrons. An interesting part of the microbe‚Äôs genomic makeup, is that it is missing an enzyme called formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase, also referred to as FTS. This is relevant, because FTS is utilized to help the metabolic process ‚Äì Which is a key function of G. sulfurreducens. Because FTS is an enzyme that is missing, G. sulfurreducens instead utilizes the reverse electron transport process and completely ignores the missing FTS enzyme.

He attained the rank of brevet Brigadier General, United States Volunteers before leaving military service. Later he would serve as a member of the Missouri General Assembly. Early life David Moore was born in Columbiana County, Ohio on July 3, 1817 to John and Sarah (Clark) Moore. His father John Moore, an Irish immigrant, served in the War of 1812 and moved to Ohio shortly thereafter. David had two siblings‚Äîa sister and a brother‚Äîplus several half-siblings from his widowed father's first marriage. At the age of thirteen Moore moved to Wayne County, Ohio and became a carpenter's apprentice until he was eighteen. He continued in the trade until 1847 when he participated in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War as Captain of an Ohio unit known as the Wooster Guards, which became Company \\"E\\" of the 3rd Ohio Infantry Regiment. After returning from the war, he moved to Missouri in 1850 and took up farming as an occupation as well as small-town merchant. The Civil War At the outbreak of the war Moore was living in the small northeast Missouri village of Wrightsville. It was there his friend (and future Missouri State Treasurer) Colonel William Bishop, on orders from General Nathaniel Lyon, recruited him to organize a unit of Missouri Home Guards to protect the area from Confederate raiders. Dressed in his Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War uniform, David Moore rode into Alexandria, Missouri on June 24, 1861 to take the oath of loyalty to the Union. Given the rank of Captain, he had handbills printed the same day inviting \\"all who are willing to fight for their homes, their county, and the flag of our glorious Union\\" to enlist \\"bringing their arms and ammunition.\\" A sufficient number of men had been recruited from the Clark County, Missouri area within two weeks and on July 4, 1861 in Kahoka they were officially organized as the 1st Northeast Missouri Home Guards, Moore being elected the unit's Colonel. After the swearing in and organization, Moore and about five hundred men moved from Kahoka to the strategically important river port of Athens, Missouri. Also in Clark county and not far from the confluence of the Des Moines and Mississippi Rivers, Moore established a training camp there as well as used it as a base of operations against area pro-Confederate bushwhackers and Missouri State Guard (MSG) under Colonel Martin E. Green. Athens also had the advantage of being across-river from a Union army supply depot at Croton, Iowa and its railroad access. On July 21, 1861 Moore's troops, with assistance from Illinois and Iowa units, attacked the village of Etna in next-door Scotland County, Missouri and drove off elements of MSG cavalry then retreated back to fortified Athens. =Battle of Athens= In response to the action of July 21, MSG Colonel Green broke camp at his Fabius River training base and marched toward Athens, stopping long enough to rout a small Home Guard force at Edina, Knox County, Missouri on July 31, 1861.> On August 5, 1861 Green's force of 2,000 MSG‚Äîamong them two of Moore's sons‚Äîwith three cannon attacked Athens. Moore had something around 500 troops under his command but they were better armed, with a recently arrived shipment of Springfield rifles. Despite being outnumbered four-to-one, the pro-Union Home Guards were able to withstand the initial attack. Seeing the MSG faltering, Colonel Moore led a bayonet charge that sent the enemy scattering. Soon, reinforcements from Croton, Farmington, Iowa and Keokuk, Iowa across the river to help complete the rout. Green's men suffered losses estimated as anywhere between thirty and fifty dead and an unknown number of wounded, while the Home Guard reported only three dead and twenty wounded. Moore's forces also 450 horses, assorted small arms, and MSG cannons.Farthest North: The Historian and the Battle of Athens, Missouri Historical Review, January 1975 =The 21st Missouri= Colonel Moore's 1st Missouri Home Guards, along with Colonel Humphrey Woodyard's 2nd Missouri Home Guards continued to pursue Confederate elements in the late summer and fall after the Battle of Athens. On December 31, 1861 the two were combined to form the 21st Missouri Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The following March, after being augmented with further units from Iowa and Illinois, the unit was assigned to the command of General Ulysses S. Grant. On April 6, 1862 Moore was wounded while participating in the early actions of the Battle of Shiloh. While leading his men from the front Moore was struck by three bullets. This caused the loss of his right leg below the knee, but after three months recovery he would return to command in early July, 1862. His return was fortuitous, because the next month disgruntled members of the 21st made a half-hearted attempt at mutiny. Moore responded quickly and forcefully, arresting all and court martialed the six ringleaders. All further thoughts of mutiny or mass desertion were quashed among the 21st soldiers. The 21st Missouri returned to heavy combat action in Fall, 1862, participating in the Battle of Iuka on September 19 and the Second Battle of Corinth on October 3‚Äì4. Moore and his regiment wrapped up their busy 1862 by participating in the first phase of General Grant's Vicksburg Campaign in December. Nearly all of 1863 was spent in garrison duty, protecting Union supply lines and strategic towns like Columbus, Kentucky and the Tennessee towns of Union City, Clinton, and Memphis. The year 1864 would see the men of the 21st once again assigned to hard fighting as they served in the Third Division of the Union XVI Corps participating in the Meridian Expedition, Red River Campaign and, especially, the Battle of Tupelo, where Moore and his men were noted for their fierce stand against the dismounted cavalry of Nathan Bedford Forrest. The regiment would also return home to Missouri briefly in 1864 in response to Price's Raid, pursuing Confederate General Sterling Price across the Show-Me state and neighboring Arkansas. David Moore and the 21st would begin 1865 with more garrison duty, but their commander would not remain with them for long. Moore left the regiment in early February, almost three years to the day of its organization. On February 21, 1865 Moore was brevetted to the rank of Brigadier General and set about organizing another regiment, the 51st Missouri. In May he assumed command of the 51st along with the First Military District of Missouri, based in St. Louis. The war now over, he remained in command until mustering out the service on August 31, 1865. Life after the military General Moore returned to northeast Missouri following the war's conclusion and again set about engaging in farming activities and the mercantile business in Canton, Missouri. In 1869 he was again called to public service, being elected as a Liberal Republican to a four-year term representing Missouri's 12th District in the Missouri State Senate. Post-war, Moore was also quite active in the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), and became a Master Mason. In addition to raising crops, David Moore was raising a second family after the war. His first wife, Pennsylvania native Diademia (Schnabel) Moore, died in 1865 after bearing him five sons and a daughter: William W., Eugene, John C., Charles A, Thomas, and Frankie. As previously written, two of Moore's sons fought for the Missouri State Guard against him at Athens. David Moore's second wife, the widow May (Mattingly) Carnegy of Union County, Kentucky, bore him three daughters‚ÄîKatie (deceased in childhood), Katie D., and Nellie‚Äîand also brought two step-sons and four step- daughters to the marriage. Moore continued to be somewhat active in Missouri Republican politics until his death on July 19, 1893.

VilCap Investments, LLC is its affiliated, managed investment fund. The programs use a model referred to as peer-selection, in which the entrepreneurs themselves choose the companies in the program that receive pre-committed investments of around $50,000. As of October 2018, Village Capital reported that they had made over 100 investments, and that over 900 entrepreneurs had gone through a total of more than 50 programs.  History  CEO Ross Baird and early board member Bob Pattillo developed the concept in 2009 as an initiative of First Light Ventures. According to Baird, the concept drew inspiration from the \\"village bank\\" concept in microfinance, where peer groups of women in developing countries would enable small loans through a peer-review structure. Businessweek described their first programs in the US and India as \\"if Microfinance and Angel Investing had a baby.\\" In 2011, Village Capital launched as an independent organization with founding support from foundations active in impact investing: the DOEN Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Monterey Institute of International Studies. In 2014 the U.S. Agency for International Development Global Development Lab awarded Village Capital a five-year grant to offset the fund‚Äôs operating costs. In 2016, Village Capital closed an $18 million fund from a group including AOL co-founder Steve Case.  Program  The organization's investment readiness programs are what the founders call \\"problem-based\\", focusing on a specific social problem, and recruiting businesses targeted to solve this problem. For example, a 2018 health program supported early-stage companies solving critical issues for an aging population. Village Capital programs generally consist of three four-day workshops over a three-month period. In the sessions, ventures develop their business models, learn to create and manage a team, interact with potential customers, and connect with investors, all while participating in peer- mentoring with an eye toward the ultimate peer-rank and investment. One of the principles of the curriculum is the 'Lens of the Investor' whereby entrepreneurs are put in the role of investors in order to learn to see themselves from that perspective. The programs are typically in operation with local partners with sector or geographic expertise.  Results  A 2016 report by the Global Accelerator Learning Initiative found that participants in a Village Capital program earned follow-on investment at a rate eight times that of entrepreneurs who were not accepted for a program. The peer-selection model has also been shown to result in increased access capital for female entrepreneurs; companies with female co-founders are 78% more likely to be selected than male-only companies, three times the likelihood that women entrepreneurs will receive funding through traditional venture capital. Village Capital CEO Ross Baird won the Harvard Business Review/Mckinsey M-Prize for Management Innovation in 2013 for the innovation of peer-selected investment. In 2018, Village Capital was ranked as one of the \\"most connected\\" organizations in impact investing according to the Aspen Institute.

Over the next few decades, computer use increased at large Bangladeshi organizations, mostly with IBM mainframe computers. However, the sector only started to get substantial attention during the 1990s. Today the sector is still in a nascent stage, though it is showing potential for advancement.  History  The first computer in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) was an IBM mainframe 1620 series, installed in 1964 at the Dhaka center of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (later the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission). Computer use increased in the following years, especially after the independence of Bangladesh in 1971; more-advanced IT equipment began to be set up in different educational, research and financial institutions. In 1979, a computer centre, later renamed Department of Computer Science & Engineering, was established at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET); the centre has been playing a pivotal role in Bangladeshi IT education since its inception. Through the introduction of personal computers, the use of computers witnessed a rapid increase in the late 1980s. In 1985, succeeding several individual initiatives, the first Bengali script in computers was invented, paving the way for more intense computer activities. In 1995, use of the Internet began and locally made software started to be exported. In 1983, the Ministry of Science and Technology established a National Computer Committee to create the required policies. The committee was also responsible to carry out programs to expand and promote the efficacious use of the sector. In 1988, the committee was replaced by the National Computer Board. In 1990, the ministry reformed the board and reconstituted it as the Bangladesh Computer Council to monitor computer- and IT-related works in the country.  ICT industry  The ICT industry is a relatively new sector in the country's economy. Though it is yet to make tangible contributions in the national economy, it is an important growth industry. The Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS) was established in 1997 as the national trade body for software and IT service industry. Starting with only 17 member companies, by 2009 membership had grown to 326. In a study among Asian countries by Japan International Cooperation Agency in 2007‚Äì08, Bangladesh was ranked first in software and IT services competitiveness and third in competencies, after India and China. The World Bank, in a study conducted in 2008, projected triple digit growth for Bangladesh in IT services and software exports. Bangladesh was also listed as one of the top 30 Countries for Offshore Services in 2010‚Äì2011 by Gartner. The Internet penetration has also grown to 21.27 percent in 2012, up from 3.2 percent three years prior. But still Bangladeshi people are not so qualified to use ICT. So Bangladeshi government is giving much priority in it. If Bangladesh wants to become digital Bangladesh, she(Bangladesh) must make sure of giving ICT education to her children and therefore Bangladesh can make the best use of it. From a TV source of Bangladesh, government agreed to give the light of programming knowledge to the children from the primary level of their life. The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector of the country has maintained 57.21 percent export growth on an average over the last nine years since 2009. In the fiscal year (FY) 2016-17, Bangladesh ICT sector registered export earnings worth US$0.8 billion from the global market and US$1.54 billion from the domestic market span - thereby making around one percent contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP). The ICT sector has created around three hundred thousand job opportunities so far. As the Internet usage increases, the government expects the IT sector to add 7.28 percent to GDP growth by 2021.

Founded in 1891, it is one of the oldest African-American founded communities in the United States and was established only a few years after nearby Eatonville. In 1911, the community was annexed into Sanford, Florida. History The Freedmen's Bureau established Goldboro during the Reconstruction Era for African Americans who worked at local railroad yards, farms, produce house and ice houses. In 1891, residents of Goldboro pursued incorporation of the town, publishing notices in the Sanford Journal as early as October 24, 1891. The town was incorporated at noon on December 1, 1891 by merchant William Clark and 19 registered African American voters. Walter Williams served as Goldsboro's first mayor until 1892. In 1900, the population of Goldsboro was 71. By 1905, the population had increased to 100 people. In 1911, the community of Sanford Heights seceded from Sanford, because of discord over municipal services provided by Sanford. This added to concerns that Sanford's ability to expand would be constrained by the surrounding towns of Goldsboro, Georgetown and Sanford Heights, as well as Lake Monroe to the north. Florida State Representative and former Sanford mayor Forrest Lake led legislative efforts to curtail Sanford Heights ability to incorporate, independent of Sanford. Goldsboro was also a target in Forrest Lake's annexation process, prompting Goldsboro's leaders to start a letter writing campaign to local newspapers. On April 6, 1911, the Sanford city council passed a resolution to annex Goldsboro and on April 26, 1911 the Florida legislature passed the Sanford Charter Bill, dissolving the incorporation of both Sanford and Goldsboro, and reorganizing Sanford as a city that included Goldsboro within its boundaries. Goldsboro's identity slowly eroded after it lost its charter and was annexed. Sanford renamed several of Goldsboro's historically-named streets. Clark Street, named for the town's founder, was renamed Lake Street after Forrest Lake, the man responsible for the loss of Goldboro's status as a town. On February 28, 2013, Lake Ave. was renamed William Clark Ave., to honor the town's founding father. Demographics =Recent history= In 2007, a Public Safety Complex was slated for construction in Goldsboro as part of Sanford's efforts to revitalize the area. In November 2010, the Sanford Police Department was relocated to the new $20 million, complex on 13th Street, which it shares with the Sanford Fire Department and a five-bay fire station. A historical museum opened in Goldsboro in 2011, at the site of the original post office. The museum exhibits photographs, historic documents and furniture donated by local residents.

After retiring from toy-making at the age of sixty-five, he created a large variety of sculptures from everyday, common objects. His objects often portray either animals or American patriotic figures, such as many diverse renditions of the Statue of Liberty. Early life Marz√°n was born in Vega Baja, a coastal town in north central Puerto Rico, just west of San Juan. He grew up working in sugar cane fields, did not attend school past first grade, and later gained carpentry skills as a teenager through building wooden frames for suitcases. After saving enough money, he (and eventually his children) migrated to the United States, during \\"The Great Migration\\" of Puerto Ricans to New York before and after World War II. He settled into an East Harlem Tenement at 107 East 110th street where he was later joined by his children and other family members. He eventually moved to a nearby brownstone on East 111th street where he lived alone, and ultimately moved into a studio apartment in the George Washington Carver Houses public housing projects in East Harlem, Manhattan, and found work through the Works Projects Administration at Novelty Toys, a New York toy manufacturer where he stuffed dolls and created toy animals up until he retired in 1971. In his free time, he also created small art novelties and boxes. Artistic works After his retirement from the toy factory, Gregorio Marz√°n used his life of carpentry and doll-making to create larger, vibrant renderings and sculptures. He scrounged up everyday materials such as Elmer's glue bottle caps, jewelry, plastic eyes, bottle caps, glitter, reflective paper, paper, masking tape, light bulbs, and plaster from shops on Canal Street and Woolworth's in New York City. Coat hangers and cartons were recycled from the laundry, and fake hair was supplied by a wig shop in Harlem.Kogan 1997, p. 7 Marz√°n's inspirations for sculptures came from animals and figures he had seen in Puerto Rico and New York, such as colorful roosters and whimsical giraffes from the Central Park Zoo. He exhibits his Puerto Rican roots through the Latin American tradition of creating shrines and totems out of common objects, but often celebrated his new home in New York City through distinctly-American icons such as the Statue of Liberty, eagles, and the Empire State Building.

Early life James Strange French was born in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, in 1807. He was educated at the College of William & Mary and the University of Virginia, then read law with his uncle Robert Strange in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Career In 1831, French represented Nat Turner, as well as a number of other slaves accused of participating in Nat Turner's slave rebellion.Alfred L. Brophy, \\"The Nat Turner Trials\\", North Carolina Law Review (June 2013), volume 91: 1817-80. French was joined in defending slaves by Meriwether Brodnax, William Henry Brodnax, Thomas Ruffin Gray, who published The Confessions of Nat Turner and is commonly referred to as Nat Turner's lawyer, and William C. Parker. Those assertions are not entirely true. Meriwether B. Brodnax (sometimes written Merewether B.

It was a romance set around Tecumseh's War. It portrayed Native Americans sympathetically and, thus, may contain some clues to French's attitudes towards the legal system's treatment of Natives and slaves. Edgar Allan Poe published a critical review of it in Southern Literary Messenger in 1836. Though they had studied together at the University of Virginia, Poe was quite critical of the plot and prose.

The album represented a big stylistic departure for Hartman; it consists of instrumental, ambient songs, with the concept of being a journey into the subconscious. New Green Clear Blue was written, performed, engineered and produced entirely by Hartman. In the album's sleeve notes, Hartman was quoted as saying: \\"The subconscious mind is a powerful world possessing experiences and feelings we do not necessarily recognize in our daily movements; but nonetheless they influence our entire lives. The tones and shades in this collection were performed live and intuitively for the purpose of opening channels by which the listener may visit their own subconscious\\". He also stated \\"This music is meant to be something that helps people connect with their subconscious. It is intended to be played at very low levels in a tranquil environment. It's a platform for the imagination.\\" Background New Green Clear Blue marked a stylistic departure for Hartman's solo career. After the commercial success of his 1984 album I Can Dream About You, Hartman returned to the studio to record the follow-up, White Boy, however his label, MCA, disagreed with the musical direction of the material and ultimately refused to release it. Speaking to the Mohave Daily Miner in 1989, Hartman said: \\"It seemed to be a natural period when I wanted to stop doing pop records; it came with a falling-out between my record company and me. One of the quotes I heard was that they expected me to crank out 10 songs like \\"I Can Dream About You\\".\\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=943&dat;=19890307&id;=gGkLAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=OlMDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6768,567004 With his departure from MCA, Hartman was inspired to record an instrumental, ambient album after listening to the music of Brian Eno and Vangelis. Once he decided to begin the New Green Clear Blue project, Hartman began reading material on the subconscious mind and intuitiveness, as well as how songs work to create an emotional reaction with their listener. He spent eighth months researching and reading, and then began writing and recording material in his home studio in Connecticut between August 1987 and August 1988. Hartman revealed to Mohave Daily Miner: Hartman attempted to unlock his own subconscious during the writing and recording of the album: \\"I became frightened, to the point I was going to stop doing it. I was unlocking my own subconscious. And the first two or three pieces I listened to I felt were planets away from fulfilling my concept. Little by little, it began to flow. By that time I think I was on automatic pilot. I knew I had shifted gears to another level of the creative process. I ended up making 23 pieces for the collection. I narrowed it down to 11.\\" Hartman dedicated the album to his sister, Kathy, because of the colour of her eyes and how he felt she was still seeking her inner self. In an interview for the Dan Hartman fan site, Edgar Winter, a former musical collaborator of Hartman's, said that the album \\"marked a new evolutionary step in Dan's writing\\". He commented: \\"It is pure music of the spirit with no commercial intentions - meditative, peaceful, and serene. I know it came straight from his heart and was a beautiful parting gift to us all.\\" Critical reception Johnny Black of Q considered the album to be \\"beautiful\\" and reminiscent of Brian Eno and Harold Budd.

With nearly 2 million items, it is the fourth largest library system in California. History =Founding= The Sacramento Library Association was established in October 1857 as a public subscription library, and its first roster listed many prominent citizens, including E. B. Crocker, C. P. Huntington, and Leland Stanford. In 1872, the association acquired a building on I Street between 7th and 8th and furnished a library on the first floor.[2] By 1879, the Library Association was facing financial difficulties and offered to transfer ownership to the City of Sacramento on the condition that it be made free. The proposal was brought to a vote in the March elections and passed. The Sacramento Free Public Library opened to the public on Saturday, June 14, 1879, with a collection of 5,695 books. =1918 Carnegie Library Building= By 1913, the Sacramento City Library collection had expanded to fill the 5,763 sq. ft. main library at 716 I Street, and the Sacramento Veteran Knights of Pythias applied to the Carnegie Corporation for the building of a new city library at the corner of 9th and I Streets. After some debate, the Carnegie Corporation approved $100,000 toward a new building and the City of Sacramento pitched in an additional $30,000. The library would be designed by San Francisco architect Loring P. Rixford, whose plans for an Italian Renaissance edifice were chosen from among 56 drawings submitted by architects throughout the Pacific Coast region in a competition conducted under the rules of the American Institute of Architects. The new Sacramento Free Public Library opened to the public at 828 I Street on April 23, 1918. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. =County Library Service= Under the leadership of Director Lauren W. Ripley, Sacramento Free Public Library reached an agreement with the Board of Supervisors of the County of Sacramento in 1908 to become the first city library in the state of California to extend free service to county residents. The library established the first county deposit station in Elk Grove on October 19, 1908, and by early 1909, had deposit stations at Courtland, Fair Oaks, Folsom, Galt, Oak Park, Sutterville and Vorden. A separate Sacramento County Library system was established in 1919 and the next year began serving all of Sacramento County, excepting city residents. The two library systems would remain separate until a July 1966 agreement between the City and County of Sacramento combined their service, unifying them under the management of the City Librarian (henceforth known as the City-County Librarian) as the Sacramento City-County Library. On August 31, 1993, the Sacramento City Council and Sacramento County Board of Supervisors voted to initiate a joint powers authority to merge all operations of the Sacramento City-County Library, including budgeting and personnel. Today, the Sacramento Public Library Authority is governed by a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement between the County of Sacramento and the Cities of Citrus Heights, Galt, Isleton, Elk Grove, Rancho Cordova, and Sacramento. The purpose of the Sacramento Public Library Authority is to provide public library services that provide open access to diverse resources and ideas that inspire learning, promote reading, and enhance community life to all citizens in its member jurisdictions. =Development= In 2011, U.S. Congresswoman Doris Matsui commented that, \\"The Sacramento Public Library continues to establish itself as a leader in the region, and as a model for other systems.\\" Later that year, Sacramento Public Library became one of 53 places in the world to have an Espresso Book Machine. As of 2015, the Sacramento Public Library began to stock general materials that community members may need to borrow, such as pots, pans, sewing machines and other similar items in order to offer better services to the community and to draw in larger populations from the area.

He served as state congressman from 2010 to 2013 and, on 7 July 2013, he was elected municipal president of Fresnillo, the largest municipality in the state of Zacatecas. According to press reports, he became the first openly gay citizen in the history of Mexico to be elected municipal president, being elected municipal president of Fresnillo, Zacatecas. He did not, however, became the first openly gay Mexican citizen to be elected to a political post, as the country has elected openly gay and lesbian congresspeople since 1997. Biography Born into a poor family with eleven siblings in Nochistl√°n, Zacatecas, Medrano toured both Mexico and the United States as a musician for Mar√≠a Victoria and Ang√©lica Mar√≠a. Years later, he graduated from the Autonomous University of Zacatecas with a bachelor's degree in Law and, at the age of 21, lead a local chapter of a trade union for professional musicians. Eventually, he became a businessman, recording several albums of ballads and ranchera music and establishing a gay nightclub around 1994. He joined politics in 1995 as a city councilor in the state capital of Zacatecas City; three years later, he became an ally of Ricardo Monreal; an influential politician in the state who had quit the PRI to continue his career in several parties of the political left. Years later, Medrano became chief adviser for governor Amalia Garc√≠a of the PRD. He joined the cabinet of David Monreal (a brother of Ricardo) in the city council of Fresnillo and in 2010 became a state deputy for the Labor Party (PT), but left the organization in 2011 when the party elected someone else to run for federal deputy in his political district. He remained in the legislature and also presided over the Finance Commission. The Fresnillo area is a largely rural region with a high level of violent crimes related to the drug wars. The municipality covers some 258 villages that are, according to Medrano, \\"full of tough country people, who don't have much information about what is going on elsewhere...\\" Medrano ran on a campaign of public safety against a smear campaign from his former party that focused on his homosexuality and alleged embezzlement of public funds. In his platform, he also promised to crack down on police corruption, restore security and gain control over the drug cartels. While Medrano is vocal about his homosexuality and has publicly defended transvestites' labor rights, he opposes same-sex marriage and adoption, LGBT pride parades, \\"flamboyant\\" homosexuality, gay prostitution and abortion. He was named president of the Commission for Attention to Rural Municipalities, part of the national organization of the National Federation of Municipalities of Mexico, A.C. (FENAMM). In 2015, Medrano ran for and won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies for the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress, representing the first district of Zacatecas based in Fresnillo. He serves on five commissions: a special commission for the Pueblos M√°gicos, Radio and Television, Committee for the Center of Law Studies and Parliamentary Research, Federal District, and Constitutional Points.SIL: LXIII Legislature Profile, Benjam√≠n Medrano Quezada In October 2015, Medrano sought to leave the Chamber of Deputies for a year and finish his term as mayor of Fresnillo; ultimately, after negotiations between Medrano and officials in Zacatecas, he remained in the Chamber of Deputies and opted to permanently leave the municipal presidency of Fresnillo.

On 1 July 1974 there was a bus accident that involved a number of pupils from the school and ten were killed. Today there is a plaque recording the Lourenco Marques Bus disaster and its victims in the school grounds. The plaque was unveiled thirty years after the accident in 2009. On 8 June 1976 the South African Police attempted to arrest Enos Ngutshane who was the local leader of the South African Students Movement. He had written a letter of protest to the Minister for Education to protest that subjects like history, geography and mathematics would be taught through the medium of Afrikaans. The police failed to apprehend him and the police were stoned and a Volkswagen Beetle was set on fire by the students. Ngutshane was not arrested until a week later and he was in court when the Soweto Uprising started. Students had gathered at Naledi High School to walk to Morris Isaacson High School in Jabavu. The plan was to gather at Orlando Stadium but before that the Police arrived and school children were shot. The school achieved a pass rate of 8% but they were able to increase that to 61% in 2000.

Discovered at the age of sixteen, she rose to prominence working for Ralph Lauren in the 1990s. Her brother is fashion photographer Miles Aldridge. She also has a half-brother, Franco Aldridge and her half- sisters are models Lily Aldridge and Ruby Aldridge. Early life Born in Parliament Hill, North London, Aldridge is the daughter of graphic designer Alan Aldridge and Rita, a housewife. From age 13 to 16, she worked at Camden Lock market and people often suggested that she should be a model. She knew a girl working on a stall who was with the Take Two modeling agency, so one day she decided to go along and they took her on. Career Aldridge began her career as a model at sixteen years old wearing jewellery for The Field magazine. Aged 17, she managed to get herself a lucky break working for a Ralph Lauren campaign. She was brought in as an extra because a friend of hers knew Bruce Weber, who was shooting the campaign. It was this job that gave her her first contract with Ralph and from then on, Aldridge gained popularity as former face of Ralph Lauren. She was photographed for numerous advertising campaigns such as Burberry, Gianfranco Ferr√©, Harrods, La Perla, Olay, Ralph Lauren, Selfridges, Laura Biagiotti and also appeared on the covers of Italian and Brazilian magazines. In 1993 she was the first fashion model to be photographed while carrying her child on the cover of the Italian magazine Donna. After almost two decades of modelling, Aldridge has moved on to launch a charity for children. In 1998 she presented a fundraising project called Through the Eyes of a Child, with the proceeds going to the NSPCC. Aldridge persuaded Canon Inc. to donate 200 free cameras, that were handed out to children between the ages of 3 and 12. They could photograph anything they wanted but they were under instructions not to get help from grown-ups. The top 200 shots went on display and were featured in a coffee-table book. Altogether, including the charity dinner and auction (supported by many celebrities such as Hugh Grant, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bryan Adams and Sting), the project raised ¬£150,000. The following years the campaign was repeated worldwide. With her husband Ian Wace, Aldridge also works for ARK. Personal life After her parents' divorce at the age of eight, Aldridge grew up in North London with her mother and her older brother Miles Aldridge. Models Lily and Ruby Aldridge are her half-sisters from Alan's second marriage in Los Angeles. She suffered self-doubt for many years of her career as a model, also marked by the loss of her best friend in the Marchioness disaster and by the death of her mother from ovarian cancer in 1992. While she was modelling, in 1993 Aldridge became pregnant with her first child, Milo, by her partner Simon Astaire. A year later she married media executive Toby Constantine and gave birth to her second son, Finn Constantine in 1997 but the marriage eventually led to divorce. In 2012, she married the financier Ian Wace.

The book covers information on mechanics, electricity, magnetism, and optics, as well as the physics of sports, space exploration, and astronomy. Mad about Physics has been translated into seven languages, including German, Greek, Japanese, and Chinese. As of 2013, Mad about Physics is in its 10th reprinting. Content From the preface: \\"Solutions and more than three hundred references are provided. They constitute about two-thirds of the book. Most of the puzzles contain an element of surprise. Indeed, the clash between common sense conjecture and physical reasoning is the central theme that runs through this volume. Einstein characterized common sense as the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen, and we agree: At least in science, common sense is to be refined and often transcended rather than venerated. The present volume tries to undermine physical preconceptions employing paradoxes (from the Greek para and doxes, meaning 'beyond belief') to create cognitive dissonance. 'Though this be madness, yet there is method in't.' We believe that far from being merely amusing, paradoxes are uniquely effective in addressing specific deficiencies in understanding. (cf. Daniel W. Welch, 'Using paradoxes.' American Journal of Physics 48 [1980]: 629‚Äì632).\\" Mad about Physics cover (1st Ed.) contains a multitude of questions which are claimed to be both creative and difficult. A few examples: * Why do professional race car drivers accelerate when going around a curve? * Why is there eight times more ice in Antarctica than in the Arctic? * Why is a full moon about nine times brighter than a half-moon even though its lit area is only twice as large? * Why can you warm your hands by blowing gently and cool your hands by blowing hard? * Why are the tallest mountains on Mars much taller than ours even though Mars is only about half the size of Earth? An extensive set of marginalia is provided, including jokes, anecdotes, offbeat scientific facts, and unusual quotations ranging from Einstein on the sensation of the mystical to Bugs Bunny on the law of gravity. For example: * Isaac Newton spent years trying to date the world's end. He leaned toward 1948. * An inscription on the wall of a restroom at Princeton University: 2 + 2 = 5 for large values of 2. * The first prize offered for communication with extraterrestrials was announced in 1900, but Mars was excluded because it was felt that contact with the Martians would be too easy.

Located on the corner of S√∏ndre Fasanvej and Smallegade, adjacent to Frederiksberg Gardens, it has an area of about five hectares and consists of a mixture of dwellings, commercial space and premises for Copenhagen Business School, whose main campus is located nearby. Many of the historical buildings have been retained, including a landmark chimney and the listed director's residence from 1908. History =The manufacturies= Aluminia and the Royal Porcelain Manufactury, illustration from 1888 The company E. Nobel constructed a tobacco factory at the site.in 1860 but Aluminia acquired the site in 1868 to build a new faience manufactury which opened in 1870. In 1882, Aluminia purchased the Royal Porcelain Factory which was based in K√∏bmagergade but in 1884 joined its new owner at their site in Frederiksberg. The original factory was designed by Valdemar Ingemann. The director's house was designed by J. E. Gnudtzmann. In 1908. Anton Rosen designed a second director's residence in 1908 when the two companies get separate managements. Aerial from 1925 Aluminia closed in 1969 while Royal Copenhagen continued to have their production at the site until 2004 when they moved to more modern facilities in Glostrup in the western suburbs of Copenhagen. Since then most of the production has moved to Thailand. =Redevelopment= Sj√¶ls√∏ Group purchased the Frederiksberg site in 2002 when Royal Copenhagen first made the decision to move. The transformation of the area was completed in 2007. Greenspaces and landmarks The chimney Porcel√¶nshaven has an area of 72,000 square metres and contains several minor green spaces. The development also has its own entrance to Frederiksberg Gardens. Since its foundation in 1882, many trees have been gifted and planted by prominent foreign guests during their visits to the porcelain facility. The local plan for the area stresses that some of the trees are in the two highest categories of preservation value and required the developers to move them to another location in the area if they could not remain in their original place. The Director's House As many of the old buildings as possible were preserved in connection with the redevelopment. Located next to the green space at the street corner, one of the old chimneys now serve as a very visible landmark in the area. Another chimney have been retained in the rear of the area. A former residence for the managing director of the Royal Porcelain Manufactury was listed in 2004. It was built to a Neo-Baroque design by Anton Rosen in 1905 when two manufacturies got separate managements. Residents Royal Copenhagen's factory outlet at S√∏ndre Fasanvej 9 =Royal Copenhagen Factory Outlet= In some of the old buildings (S√∏ndre Fasanvej 9), Royal Copenhagen maintains a factory outlet over two floors. It sells 2nd quality porcelain and discontinued products at special prices. =CBS campus= The former eaw material storage building seen from Frederiksberg Gardens Copenhagen Business School occupies 19,000 square metres in the southern part of the area, overlooking Frederiksberg Gardens, as well as 8,000 square metres of underground parking A low, partly underground former oven hall on S√∏ndre Fasanvej serves as a vestibule to a complex of former factory buildings. It is roofed by three barrel vaults supported by pillars. The building to the south contains residences for international students and a canteen. The building to the north contains class rooms and IT facilities. Behind the complex is another building which home to Department of Intercultural Communication and Management and the Department of Management, Politics and Philosophy. Another building, further to the east, is a former raw material storage building which was adapted to its present use by Henning Larsen Architects after they won an architectural competition in 2006. It has retained its industrial character on three sides but has a glazed fa√ßade facing the park. It now contains flexible study environments. The former Director's House is also used by CBS. =Dwellings= Several architectural firms contributed to the area. Juul & Frost has designed Flora Danica House (44 housing society dwellings), Fasanhaven (83 owner-occupied apartments), Porcelain House (24 owner-occupied apartments), Magnolia Houses (10 three-storey townhouses), student housing (120 units of 25-49 sqm) and premises for Georg Jensen/Royal Copenhagen.

Although greedy embedding has been proposed for use in wireless sensor networks, in which the nodes already have positions in physical space, these existing positions may differ from the positions given to them by greedy embedding, which may in some cases be points in a virtual space of a higher dimension, or in a non-Euclidean geometry. In this sense, greedy embedding may be viewed as a form of graph drawing, in which an abstract graph (the communications network) is embedded into a geometric space. The idea of performing geographic routing using coordinates in a virtual space, instead of using physical coordinates, is due to Rao et al. Subsequent developments have shown that every network has a greedy embedding with succinct vertex coordinates in the hyperbolic plane, that certain graphs including the polyhedral graphs have greedy embeddings in the Euclidean plane, and that unit disk graphs have greedy embeddings in Euclidean spaces of moderate dimensions with low stretch factors. Definitions In greedy routing, a message from a source node s to a destination node t travels to its destination by a sequence of steps through intermediate nodes, each of which passes the message on to a neighboring node that is closer to t. If the message reaches an intermediate node x that does not have a neighbor closer to t, then it cannot make progress and the greedy routing process fails. A greedy embedding is an embedding of the given graph with the property that a failure of this type is impossible. Thus, it can be characterized as an embedding of the graph with the property that for every two nodes x and t, there exists a neighbor y of x such that d(x,t) > d(y,t), where d denotes the distance in the embedded space. Graphs with no greedy embedding K1,6, a graph with no greedy embedding in the Euclidean plane Not every graph has a greedy embedding into the Euclidean plane; a simple counterexample is given by the star K1,6, a tree with one internal node and six leaves. Whenever this graph is embedded into the plane, some two of its leaves must form an angle of 60 degrees or less, from which it follows that at least one of these two leaves does not have a neighbor that is closer to the other leaf. In Euclidean spaces of higher dimensions, more graphs may have greedy embeddings; for instance, K1,6 has a greedy embedding into three-dimensional Euclidean space, in which the internal node of the star is at the origin and the leaves are a unit distance away along each coordinate axis. However, for every Euclidean space of fixed dimension, there are graphs that cannot be embedded greedily: whenever the number n is greater than the kissing number of the space, the graph K1,n has no greedy embedding. Hyperbolic and succinct embeddings Unlike the case for the Euclidean plane, every network has a greedy embedding into the hyperbolic plane. The original proof of this result, by Robert Kleinberg, required the node positions to be specified with high precision, but subsequently it was shown that, by using a heavy path decomposition of a spanning tree of the network, it is possible to represent each node succinctly, using only a logarithmic number of bits per point. In contrast, there exist graphs that have greedy embeddings in the Euclidean plane, but for which any such embedding requires a polynomial number of bits for the Cartesian coordinates of each point. Special classes of graphs =Trees= The class of trees that admit greedy embeddings into the Euclidean plane has been completely characterized, and a greedy embedding of a tree can be found in linear time when it exists. For more general graphs, some greedy embedding algorithms such as the one by Kleinberg start by finding a spanning tree of the given graph, and then construct a greedy embedding of the spanning tree. The result is necessarily also a greedy embedding of the whole graph. However, there exist graphs that have a greedy embedding in the Euclidean plane but for which no spanning tree has a greedy embedding. =Planar graphs= conjectured that every polyhedral graph (a 3-vertex-connected planar graph, or equivalently by Steinitz's theorem the graph of a convex polyhedron) has a greedy embedding into the Euclidean plane.. By exploiting the properties of cactus graphs, proved the conjecture; the greedy embeddings of these graphs can be defined succinctly, with logarithmically many bits per coordinate. However, the greedy embeddings constructed according to this proof are not necessarily planar embeddings, as they may include crossings between pairs of edges. For maximal planar graphs, in which every face is a triangle, a greedy planar embedding can be found by applying the Knaster‚ÄìKuratowski‚ÄìMazurkiewicz lemma to a weighted version of a straight-line embedding algorithm of Schnyder. The strong Papadimitriou‚ÄìRatajczak conjecture, that every polyhedral graph has a planar greedy embedding in which all faces are convex, remains unproven.. =Unit disk graphs= The wireless sensor networks that are the target of greedy embedding algorithms are frequently modeled as unit disk graphs, graphs in which each node is represented as a unit disk and each edge corresponds to a pair of disks with nonempty intersection. For this special class of graphs, it is possible to find succinct greedy embeddings into a Euclidean space of polylogarithmic dimension, with the additional property that distances in the graph are accurately approximated by distances in the embedding, so that the paths followed by greedy routing are short.

Retrieved July 2013. History Pioneers arrived in Polk County around 1830, mainly from Tennessee, Illinois and Kentucky. They settled near Dallas, surviving off the area's abundant wild game, and building shelters from its rich timber resources. Polk County was created by the state's General Assembly in 1844, with Dallas as its county seat. The village was named for Vice-President George M. Dallas. The first Polk County courthouse was located in Dallas, but was destroyed by fire. In 1869 a second courthouse was built, which was also destroyed by fire, in 1883. Dallas became a regional center due to its location along Long's Trail, a stagecoach route which connected to the Butterfield Overland Mail Trail to the north, and passed west into what is now Oklahoma. At one time, Dallas had three mills, livery stables, boarding houses, two churches, several stores, and a weekly newspaper. Arthur Edward Stilwell built the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad (now the Kansas City Southern) from Kansas City, Missouri to Port Arthur, Texas during the 1890s. Nearby Mena was selected as the site for his railway stop, and train service to Mena began in 1896. A special election was held in 1898, and residents voted to move the county seat to Mena. Dallas Creek flows through the village, and Dallas Cemetery is located east of the community.

The Army Group was created to invade Ukraine after the withdrawal of the Austrian-German occupation force in November 1918 and to fight the Ukrainian People's Republic, as well as the troops of the Entente which had landed on the Black Sea coast. The Army Group was primarily based on two insurgent divisions that were created on September 22, 1918 by the order #6 of All-Ukrainian Central Military Revolutionary Committee and were part of the Red Army Reserve Front at the Oryol Military District. The reserve front was originally commissioned under Commandarm Glagolev and members of revolutionary military council Viyshnevetsky and Zusmanovich. Army Group of Kursk Direction On November 17, 1918 the Revolutionary Military Council consisting of Stalin, Yuri Pyatakov, Volodymyr Zatonsky, and Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko established the Army group of Kursk Direction. The name was chosen by the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of all Armed Forces of Republic Jukums VƒÅcietis (since September 1, 1918). The 1st Ukrainian Insurgent Division and the 2nd Ukrainian Insurgent Division in December 1918 were renamed into Soviet divisions. It was planned also to add to the Army Group the Moscow Worker's Division, the 43rd Worker's Regiment, the 2nd Oryol Cavalry Division as well as the formations of Innokentiy Kozhevnikov from Ufa. The most of them however were redirected to the Southern Front. The Moscow Military District also sent the Moscow Reserve Artillery Brigade and its leading military personnel. Officially Innokentiy Kozhevnikov became the commander of the Army Group, but the major work in organizing the Army Group was conducted by Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko. By January 1919 he managed also to recruit several formations of border guards, two Cheka and two food regiments as well as several armored trains from Moscow. The Army Group was also joined by a number of international volunteer formations from Kazan and Oryol, the 1st Moscow Communist Squad, the Yashvili Company and Armenian Company, all of which accounted for some 1,000 of bayonets. The chairman of the Russian Revolutionary Military Council Leon Trotsky ordered on December 14, 1918 a mass recruitment of ethnic Ukrainians. =Military Operations= On November 28, 1918 the All-Ukrainian Central Military Revolutionary Committee was transformed into the Provisional Workers- Peasants Government of Ukraine. On November 30, 1918 Vacietis was informed that the Ukrainian Revolutionary Military Council included Antonov, Sergeyev, and Zatonsky. By the end of December 1918 the Army Group successfully occupied the Chernigov Governorate and portions of the Kharkov Governorate. On December 13, 1918 the 1st Insurgency Division took Klintsy and on December 25 - Novozybkov and Novhorod-Siversky. It met some resistance on December 25, 1918 near Hlukhiv and Shostka. Another of its groups took Vovchansk and Kupiansk on December 19, 1918. After the withdrawal of the German forces from the borders, the 2nd Insurgent Division occupied Belgorod on December 21, 1918 and started to advance on Kharkiv. On December 28‚Äì30, 1918 the Ukrainian People's Army managed to halt their advance near Grayvoron and Kozacha Lopan. On January 2, 1919 Bolsheviks organized an uprising in Kharkiv. The local council of German soldiers supported the uprising and gave the Ukrainian forces an ultimatum to leave the city. On January 3, 1919 the Red Army occupied Kharkiv. The next day, the Army Group of Kursk Direction was reformed into the Ukrainian Front. Ukrainian Front In November 1918 the White Russian Volunteer Army was in a strong position after it successfully secured the territory of Northern Caucasus and Kuban, as well as being supported by the Allied landings in Southern Ukraine. After the formation of the Ukrainian Front on January 4, 1919, the Ukrainian Revolutionary Military Council consisted of Antonov, Kotsiubynsky, and Shchadenko. On January 13, 1919 as part of the Front the Army Group of Kharkiv Direction was created, which was based on the 2nd Ukrainian Soviet Division. On January 24, 1919 the People's Commissariat of Military Affairs was created as part of the Provisional Workers-Peasants Government of Ukraine ,which on January 28 was renamed into the Council of People's Commissars of the Ukrainian SSR. On February 18, 1919 the Army Group of Kiev Direction was created, which was based on the 1st Ukrainian Soviet Division. In mid February within the Army Group of Kharkiv Direction, there was a special group created, called the Army Group of Donetsk Direction which on March 5, 1919 was reorganized into the 13th Army led by Kozhevnikov. On April 14, 1919 the Central Executive Committee of the Ukrainian SSR ratified a military union with the Russian SFSR. On April 15, 1919 all army groups were transformed into armies: * 1st Ukrainian Soviet Army, * 2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army, * 3rd Ukrainian Soviet Army, * Crimean Soviet Army. On April 27, 1919 the 2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army was transferred under the jurisdiction of the Southern Front and on June 4, 1919 transformed into the 14th Army. In June, the 1st Ukrainian and 3rd Ukrainian armies were transformed into the 12th Army and transferred to the Western Front. The Crimean Soviet Army also joined the 14th Army at the Southern Front on June 4, 1919.

From 1952 to 1971, the 28th Army was based in Putian, Fujian and belonged to the Fujian Military Region. From 1971 to 1998, this army corps belonged to the Beijing Military Region and was based in Shanxi Province, initially in Houma and then in Datong. At the time of its dissolution in 1998, the 28th Army was composed of the 82nd, 83rd and 205th Infantry Divisions, the 7th Armored Division, an artillery brigade, an anti- aircraft brigade, an engineer regiment, a communication regiment and a reconnaissance battalion. The army corps‚Äô unit ID number was 51366.  History  =Formation and lineage= The 28th Group Army was formed in February 1949 out of the 10th Column of the East China Field Army and consisted of the 82nd, 83rd and 84th Divisions. The 28th Army traces its lineage to the Eighth Route Army‚Äôs guerilla units in the Bohai Military District of Shandong during the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the end of World War II, most units of the Bohai Military Districts were relocated to Manchuria but the remaining units were reorganized into the 7th and 11th Divisions of the Shandong People‚Äôs Liberation Army in 1946. At the outset of the Chinese Civil War in February 1947, these two divisions became the 10th Column of the East China Field Army, with 116,000 troops, under the command of General Song Shilun. In 1947, the 10th Column defeated Li Xianzhou‚Äôs Nationalist forces in the Battle of Laiwu and then participated in the Battles of Taian and Menglianggu in April and May. The 10th Column then covered the advance of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Field Army into the Dabie Mountains in June and spent the fall fighting along the Longhai Railway. In early 1948, the 10th Column fought in the border region of southern Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu. In the summer and early fall, the 10th Column participated in the capture of Kaifeng and Jinan. and, in the winter of 1948, the Liaoshen Campaign. When the 10th Column became the 28th Army in February 1949, the unit had 34,000 troops. The 28th Army entering Fuzhou on August 17, 1949. =Operations after formation= In April 1949, the 28th Army crossed the Yangtze River at Jiangyin and captured Taicang and Jiading in the Shanghai Campaign. In July, the army entered Fujian and in October, captured Fuzhou, Fuqing and Pingtan. The invasion of Kinmen Island ended in failure and the 28th Army lost all 9,086 troops contributed to the mission. At the end of 1949, the 28th Army was tasked with ‚Äúbandit suppression‚Äù in Fujian. In 1952, the 28th Army was headquartered at Putian and belonged to the Fujian Military Region. After the outbreak of Sino-Soviet Border clashes in 1969, the 28th Army was relocated from Putian north to Houma, Shanxi in 1971. In 1985, headquarters were moved to Datong and the 84th Division was dissolved. =Tiananmen protests of 1989= The 28th Army was notable for its passive enforcement of the martial law order against the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The 28th Army, led by commander He Yanran and political commissar Zhang Mingchun and based in Datong, Shanxi Province, received the mobilization order on May 19 and led the 82nd and 83rd Divisions by motorized transport to Beijing.(Chinese) Ëã±Âπ¥Êó©ÈÄùÁöÑ'ÂÖ≠Âõõ'ÊäóÂëΩÂ∞ÜÈ¢ÜÂº†ÊòéÊò•Â∞ëÂ∞Ü 2011-01-17 Like other PLA units trying to enforce martial law, the 28th Army's advance into the city was blocked by students and residents. The 28th Army retreated to Yanqing County northwest of Beijing's city centre. When ordered to enter the city on June 3, the 28th encountered protesting residents along route but did not open fire and missed the deadline to reach Tiananmen Square by 5:30 am on June 4. At 7:00am, the 28th Army ran into a throng of angry residents at Muxidi on West Chang'an Avenue west of the Square. The residents told the soldiers of the killings from earlier in the morning and showed blood stained shirts of victims. At noon, Liu Huaqing, the commander of the martial law enforcement action, ordered Wang Hai, head of the PLA Air Force, to fly over Muxidi in by helicopter and order by loud speaker the 28th Army to counterattack. But on the ground, the commanders of the 28th refused to comply. Instead the troops abandoned their positions en masse. By 5:00 pm, many had retreated into the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution nearby. Of all units involved in the crackdown, the 28th Army lost by far the most equipment, as 74 vehicles including 31 armored personnel and two communications vehicles were burned. The unit was later removed and ordered to undergo six months of reorganization. Afterwards, all commanding officers were demoted and reassigned to other units. Commander He Yanran was court- martialled and demoted.John Garnaut, \\"How top generals refused to march on Tiananmen Square\\" Sydney Morning Herald 2010-06-04 Political commissar Zhang Mingchun was demoted to political commissar of the Jilin Military District. Chief of Staff Qiu Jinkai was demoted to the Guizhou Military District, but was re-elevated in 1993 to become the deputy commander of the 27th Army. He became the commander of the 27th Army and held the position for a decade. In 2004, Qiu became the chief of staff of the Beijing Military Region and in 2005 became the deputy commander of the military region as well as the commander of the Beijing Garrison. =Dissolution= In 1998, the 28th Army was dissolved as a unit with the 82nd Motorized Infantry Division assigned to the 63rd Army, and the 7th Armored Division, reorganized as the 7th Armored Brigade, assigned to the 65th Army. The 83rd Division became a local reserve division in Shanxi. The 205th Division, downsized to a brigade, was assigned to the Inner Mongolia Military District.

Personal life Prince Sultan was born in May 1968. His father is known as \\"the second\\" Turki (ÿßŸÑÿ´ÿßŸÜŸä ath-thƒÅnƒ´), because he was the second son born to King Abdulaziz named \\"Turki\\". The first Prince Turki was Abdulaziz's first son who died in 1919 due to Spanish flu. His mother is Noura, the daughter of Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman. Prince Sultan lived in Geneva. He was married to former king Abdullah's daughter, Princess Noura. She died in 1990 in a car accident near Riyadh airport. He has one son named Mohammed bin Sultan from another marriage. Kidnappings In 2004, Prince Sultan accused the government of Saudi Arabia of kidnapping him in June 2003 in Switzerland after he spoke out in favour of reform in Saudi Arabia. He was lured to a meeting in Geneva where he was drugged before being flown back to the Kingdom and was kept under house arrest in Riyadh. To finish the mission successfully, a Boeing 747 medical evacuation aircraft was sent especially for this purpose after sedating him. The aircraft arrived at Geneva Airport a few days before the kidnapping operation, and it was always in a state of readiness. Another aircraft was sent to carry the personal effects, papers, files, and documents of Prince Sultan, which were later confiscated from the Hotel where he had been staying and taken to Riyadh. The aircraft was officially registered in Switzerland as part of the entourage of Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd, who was on visit to Switzerland at the time. According to newspaper reports, on 1 February 2016 Prince Sultan was again kidnapped, with his entourage of about 20 people. They were on a flight from Paris whose ostensible destination was Cairo: it was diverted to Riyadh where all were detained. After some days the non-Saudis in the party were released. In August 2017, Prince Sultan was apparently still in Saudi Arabia.Hugh Miles, \\"Saudi prince returned from Europe against his will, say staff\\" (29 March 2016) and \\"Saudi Arabia: new details of dissident princes' abductions emerge\\" (15 August 2017) in The Guardian The kidnapping was one of three disappearances of Saudi princes living in Europe that featured in the 2017 BBC News Channel documentary Kidnapped! Saudi Arabia's Missing Princes. His kidnappings were described as one of many disappearances of members of the Saudi Royal family who have criticized the government or called for regime change.

She used several other names and aliases, such as Countess Barcynska, H√©l√®ne Barcynska, Marguerite Florence Barclay, Mrs. Armiger Barczinsky, Caradoc Evans Marguerite, Marguerite Evans, Armiger Barclay, and Marguerite Barclay. Biography Daughter of an officer of the Indian Medical Corps, Marguerite was born in Henzada, Burma, then part of British India. She was educated and trained as an actress in England.The Miracle Stone and Welsh Legend Formation She married in 1911 the Polish-born journalist Armiger Barczinsky, also known as Barclay (1861?-1930), who greatly encouraged her to write,Article on Margaret by John Harris. and had a son, Nicholas Barczinsky- Sandys (born 1916). It was following the birth and the success of her stage novel, The Honeypot, published in 1916, that she separated from Barczinsky- Barclay, by whose death she was widowed in 1930. In 1929 she met the Welsh writer Caradoc Evans (1878‚Äì1945) in London, and married him on 22 March 1933, a union that lasted until his death in 1945. Living together in Aberystwyth from their marriage, then at Ruislip, Middlesex from 1937, Marguerite and Caradoc were involved in theatrical ventures, both in Wales and England. After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, they returned to Aberystwyth, and eventually settled in 1940 in New Cross, Cardiganshire, about five miles from Aberystwyth, where Caradoc remained with his son until 1945. In the 1940s, Marguerite wrote two autobiographical works, published by the publisher Hurst and Blackett. The first, Full and Frank: the Private Life of the Woman Novelist (1941), is a presentation of the author's life to the public. The second is a biography of Caradoc. The house they lived in, \\"Brynawelon\\" had spectacular views of Plynlimon, which may have inspired her book The Miracle Stone of Wales (1957). Caradoc Evans is buried in the New Cross Horeb chapel cemetery.Caradoc Evans After the death of Caradoc, Marguerite returned to London briefly, and then went to Penrhyn-coch, then to Panteidal Lodge, with Captain Hewitt, which she describes in her book The Miracle Stone of Wales. In the 1950s she came to live at \\"The Ancient House\\" in Little Stretton, Shropshire and used nearby Church Stretton as the setting for one of her later novels, Quaint Place (1952). By that decade the market for her kind of fiction had collapsed and she was surviving on a pension for literary services. On 10 March 1964 Marguerite died of heart failure in Shrewsbury Hospital. She was buried in her second husband's grave at New Cross Horeb chapel cemetery. Literary career Marguerite was a prolific author during the twentieth century, and achieved success before and after the First World War. Her autobiography, published in 1941, lists 38 novels which she wrote as Oliver Sandys, including six films, and 21 she wrote as Countess Barcynska, five of them also filmed.Orlando-Cambridge The total number of her works exceed 130, between 1911 and 1946, but libraries do not have all the catalogued works. She had also published short stories, memoirs (one on mysticism and faith healing), and a biography of her second husband, Caradoc Evans. The summer of 1911 marks the date of the first novel by Marguerite, signed as Oliver Sandys, The Woman in the Firelight, concluded a few weeks after the wedding. Her first successful novel, however, was The Honeypot (1916), inspired by her experiences as an actress; it was adapted to film in 1920.The Honeypot Nine more of her novels were adapted to film between 1922 and 1933, notably The Pleasure Garden (1925), debut film of director Alfred Hitchcock.

It is the fourth game in the Age of Wonders series, following Age of Wonders, Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne and Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic released in 1999, 2002, and 2003 respectively. It was released on March 31, 2014 through digital distribution, as well as through retail in select territories for Microsoft Windows. A port to Linux and OS X was released on April 14, 2015. The game is set in a high fantasy fictional setting, where players take the role of a leader to explore the world, interacting with other races and kingdoms, both diplomatically and through warfare while progressively expanding and managing their empire. It features a new graphics engine for the series, in addition to an updated soundtrack. The gameplay has also been updated, featuring a new role-playing style leader class based system and interchangeable choices of strategy and appearances for each playable race. It also supports online and local multiple player modes and a level editor along with a new story driven single player campaign mode. Gameplay An Elven city (left) with its own and rival armies placed on a world map view. Age of Wonders III, like the previous games in the series is a turn-based strategy game set within a high fantasy universe where the player assumes the role of a political-military leader. Gameplay is 4X-based (explore, expand, exploit and exterminate) where players explore the world map, slowly building an empire through colonization, warfare and diplomacy with rival powers. However new to III is the greater addition of role-playing game features, where players must first choose and customize their leader, all options are dependent on the player's chosen style of play. There are six available races in the initial release: humans, draconians, high elves, dwarves, orcs, and goblins, all that will determine the race of their empire with each having unique perks and abilities. The leader and empire is further shaped by the choice from skill sets based on traditional RPG classes along with further specializations and skills to select. Each leader class also has access to their own unique units with a distinct visual look based on their corresponding race, each to accommodate their own unique approach to strategy, both in combat and when managing their empire. On release there are six different classes a leader can be. The \\"Sorcerer\\" class emphasizes the use of magic for enchantments and summoning powerful units. The \\"Theocrat\\" derives from an organized religion based society including zealots followers and the use of holy spells and warriors. The \\"Rogue\\" favors less direct approaches to situations, employing stealth, thievery and manipulation as well as dark magic in diplomacy and warfare. The \\"Archdruid\\" channels the power of nature, using it to their advantage by being very self-sufficient and being able to call upon wild creatures. The \\"Dreadnought\\" leads a steampunk styled society, using large industry, machinery and gunpowder-based units like cannons and tanks. Finally the \\"Warlord\\" specializes in direct conflict and combat tactics, utilizing effective non-magic based units and abilities. Leaders themselves and separate recruitable hero units will be able to gain experience and level up, while also being able to gain new equipment and powers. Players can also develop their alignment between good and evil based on their player's actions and the cultures the player absorbs into their empire, rather than race like the previous games in the series. Cities themselves provide much of the resources, infrastructure and host to unit recruitment, spell casting and research to unlock more of both, requiring gold, mana and or research points respectively gained through said city prosperity while also exploration. Independent cities and units not immediately aligned to any player/leader are also present in the world map. Units that come from an unaffiliated city will fight to protect a city's domain and will not forget that they're tied to it. Many of these independent settlements aren't cities in the traditional sense, but can be alternative settlements for other races and creatures, like a giant's keep or an undead dwelling for example. A player can conquer these holdings, which will provide units like a city, or they can absorb them through diplomatic means by paying tribute with diplomatic and/or alignment standing affecting their own stance on the player. If the city retains its native population, the player can recruit units of other races besides their own while the player can at any time after absorbing a city into their empire migrate a different population to that city while also being an act of \\"evil\\" for their alignment. Different city races are affected by the type of terrain, determining how well they thrive, for example dwarves prefer mountainous landscapes over tropics. Migrating the population or the non-evil act of terraforming the landscape through spells can alleviate this. Quests can also be given to players by independent forces and cities, including but not limited to clearing out wild units and protecting their stronghold. Quests can grant the support of independent forces for player in addition to a reward such as gold or equipment, sometimes with the choice of either given to the player upon completion of the quest. As in the case of the first game in the series, Age of Wonders III offers a story-driven campaign that is playable from two sides, the human-centric Commonwealth Empire and the Court of the High Elves. In addition to the campaign; single-player scenarios, online multiplayer, random map generation and a map editor are also available. The graphics of Age of Wonders III have also changed to a fully 3D perspective with camera control instead of the isometric view the series has utilized prior. =Combat= A Dreadnought army besieging an Archdruid's city walls. Battles take place on separate 3D battlefields on a hexagon-grid layout of movement. When two rival players forces engage, either in open battle or during a siege of a city, combat takes place in a separate phase of gameplay within a hexagon grid-based 3D battlefield where units are designated movement and space. Each side can lead multiple armies into battle with up to six units per army, many represented by multiple soldiers forming ranks as a single combatant that reflect their overall health (as figures are killed, their combat ability does not diminish until the unit's health reaches zero) while others are shown as single yet stronger characters. Both sides take turns to move and utilize their units while also being able to grant abilities that can enhance their effectiveness in combat, including magical spells that can also be used to boost unit capabilities, summon in new units and call down potentially very devastating area of effect attacks. Spells that leaders have learnt are usable in every battle regardless of his or her presence while others require hero units to be present, spell usage being limited by their mana pool. Units can also make use of the battlefield environment, such as defensive walls during city sieges, foliage and being able to make use of a flanking manoeuvre where attacks from a units rear can be more effective. Units are allocated \\"action points\\" used for attacking, defending/retaliating and using special abilities, separate from yet dependent on their choice of movement shown by colour coding their choice of hexes they can act within. For example, if a unit does not move during their turn, they can perform up to three actions with the surrounding hexes displayed as green to the player, whereas if they move, they would appear orange and could now only perform two actions and finally one with red hexes. Any remaining action points a unit has or does have carries over into the opposition's turn, always having at least one left regardless of how far the unit moved prior. These remaining action points can be used to retaliate against any attacks they received from enemy units during the opposing player's own turn. It is also possible to expend action points entirely, potentially leaving units unable to move and/or retaliate themselves. Other options include the ability to just sprint or guard, greatly raising movement and defense respectively and evoking various different status effects such as stuns and poisons and damage enemy units that move into adjacent hexes. Plot Before the events of the first game, the elven court was decimated by humans, an invasive race new to the Blessed Continent at the time. The elves split into two factions. The son of the slain king Inioch, Meandor, led the dark elves and the Cult of Storms, a group that intended to wipe out the humans. Inioch's daughter, Julia, led the wood elves and the Keepers, a group that had no genocidal intentions. These factions and others clashed in the Valley of Wonders, around the ruins of the razed elven court. The High Elf race was founded many years later when Julia married a dark elf and reunited their two races. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth Empire began as a joining of races for mutual protection and the sharing of knowledge. Though it set out with benign intentions, once the Empire was through expanding, humans seized power and pushed forward with technology and commerce. The Commonwealth Empire means to sweep aside the old ways and assimilate the world. The Elven Court takes exception to this, and wants to rally the ancient races to stand in defense against imperial ambitions, hence the central conflict of Age of Wonders III. The Elven Court Campaign follows the Rogue Elven Princess Sundren of House Inioch. During a meeting at the Council of Origins, Thannis is killed and Gamblag blames both Sundren and Thannis of treachery, declaring war on Sundren and joining the Commonwealth. With the help of the Arch Druid Reskar Shapechanger, Sundren manages to defeat Gamblag and recover the body of Thannis. Sundren and Reskar then proceed to establish a haven for Draconians, meeting the Goblin Theocrat Nomlik in these lands. With his help, along with the help of the Orcish Sorcerer Groshak, they manage to defeat all opposition in these lands, including a Commonwealth Dreadnought draining the lands. As Reskar rules over his haven, Sundren and Nomlik strike a serious blow at the Commonwealth by destroying the Commonwealth factories in Xablor Province and defeating the High Priest Voraditius, freeing many enslaved goblins in the province. At Thannis's funeral, the Elven king Saridas vows retribution against the Commonwealth and prepares for all-out war while Julia does not share his genocidal intentions. Afterwards, Sundren and her party heads to the Sapphire Archipelago to attack Isabella's pirate forces. After a few battles, Sundren meets Merlin, who reveals that the Shadowborn, a secretive organization of which Isabella is part of, planned to push the Elven Court and the Commonwealth towards war. Sundren is then given a choice: either she tries to stop the war and spare the humans at the risk of being marked renegade by the Elven Court or she remains loyal to the Elven Court and purges the Archipelago of all human presence and follows Saridas to all-out war, something that Nomlik won't like. If Sundren chooses to stop the war, Groshak leaves her in disgust while she forms the Torchbearers, a third neutral party dedicated to hunting down the Shadowborn. Sundren offers peace to Isabella, but the shadowborn pirate rejects the proposal, leaving Sundren no choice but to rid the Sapphire Archipelago of her while sparing the human populations. She also frees Bormac Orcsbane, a Dwarven Dreadnought hero who becomes sympathetic to the Torchbearer cause. After defeating Isabella, Sundren, Nomlik, and Reskar follow Bormac eastward to establish a haven for Torchbearers. They encounter armies of Vontor and Leana, who are both loyal to Saridas and hostile due to Sundren's desertion, as well as the Shadowborn member Werlac. Leana soon reveals that Saridas is aware of Werlac's treachery and goes to war with him as well. After Werlac falls in battle, he proceeds to retreat from the region, leaving Sundren and her party to deal with the remaining opponents. They manage to defeat all of them just in time to reach the center of battlefield between the Elven Court and the Commonwealth. Merlin gives her a magic wand that gives the user the ability to reroute the throne teleport to a special holding place; his plan is to capture both King Saridas and Emperor Leonus in order to bring the war to the end. Together, Sundren and the Torchbearers, along with Edward Portsmith succeed and show the evidence about the Shadowborn to both leaders, and their animosities quickly fade. The Torchbearers proceeds to enter both the Commonwealth and the Elven Court to hunt down the remaining Shadowborn agents. The Commonwealth Campaign follows the Human Dreadnought Edward Portsmith. After taking the oath of command, he quells the rebellion at Brisska Province with the help of Emperor Leonus's niece, the Sorceress Laryssa Mirabilis. They then travel to the Haunted Nervinkiln to acquire Melenis's Power Source and drive out the Elven Sorcerer Werlac. There, they meet the Elven Warlord Valery and drop the Oscillator gem off at a Dwarven Outpost controlled by Commonwealth Dreadnoughts Drugal and Gormsog. Laryssa then proceeds to study the gem when she goes missing along with the gem, with Svengir being suspected of stealing the gem. As they approached him, Svengir reveals that he never stole the gem and orders the Drugal and Gormsog to betray and crush both Valery and Edward. Fending off attacks, they manage to defeat Svengir and both traitorous dwarves, only to find Laryssa and the gem not in the province. Laryssa is then revealed to have taken the gem with her and was branded a traitor. Edward is ordered to find and kill her. On the way, they meet the Orcish Rogue Sulthor and the Draconian Carishar, who claims to have been attacked by Laryssa. As Edward makes contact with Laryssa, she reveals her true intentions and Edward is given a choice: either join her and the Torchbearers to stop the war between the Commonwealth and Elven Court against Valery's wishes, or remain loyal to the Commonwealth and carry out her sentence. Development Following a digital re-release of the original series of games, Age of Wonders III was later announced on February 6, 2013. Development first began in 2010, with many of the original developers of the previous games having returned, with development being led by studio founders Lennart Sas and Arno van Wingerden, while technical producer Djurre van Dijk and game designer Arnout Sas also returned. Ray Bingham is the story writer. Jimmy van der Have has been the chief liaison between the development team and the fan community on the official website, with further development also involving the use of regular journals and solicits feedback on the developer game site's official forum, allowing the community to be involved in the testing of the game. While a random map generator has been promised, additional tools for extensive, user-created content are available. In February 2013, Markus \\"Notch\\" Persson, owner of Mojang and founding lead designer of the popular game Minecraft, was revealed as an investment partner in the development of Age of Wonders III. Triumph Studios got into contact with Mojang following the mention of their series with the random blurb for the title screen of Minecraft, leading them to show a demo of the current development stage at the time, including with other potential publishers. Lennart Sas at Triumph stated that \\"His biggest concern was that it would cost him a lot of time, so it helped that we made this sort of game before and were at an advanced stage of development.\\" This eventually allowed the studio to opt to self-publish following further funding, being an unconventional approach to funding and publishing, without the use of Kickstarter like many sequels to other classic PC titles in development during that period. Persson himself is a fan of the previous Age of Wonders games and instead went on to help simply fund the development of III rather than having any publishing rights or ownership. His involvement would later be referenced within the game in the form of a recruitable hero called \\"Per Notchson\\" that resembles Persson. =Release= Though originally intended for release in late 2013, it was pushed back to early 2014 to allow for a greater investment of time and resources. The game was released worldwide on 31 March 2014, predominantly through digital distribution including online store platforms Steam and GOG.com, published by the developer themselves. Limited retail physical copies are planned to be published in Europe by third party publishers including EuroVideo who are publishing a \\"Limited Collector's Edition\\" with a figurine, soundtrack and digital content codes in central Europe while Techland are publishing a \\"Special Edition\\" with a guide and stickers, with Namco Bandai and Buka published standard retail copies in other European countries. The digital versions also have pre-purchase bonus missions as well as the option of a \\"Deluxe Edition\\" that comes with a digital copy of the soundtrack and a further additional mission. =Expansions= Golden Realms An expansion titled \\"Golden Realms\\" was announced on 21 August 2014 and released 18 September 2014 as digital downloadable content. The expansion features a new playable race, in the form of Halflings with their own unique units, buildings and abilities, utilizing a \\"luck mechanic\\" to aid in combat. The Halflings also have a dedicated story campaign, following the race's struggle and return from distant lands following a massacre of their kind from the point of view of the Halfling warlord Ernest Thistlewood. The expansion also features new wild/non-player locations and units, along with new relics and perks to discover and two standalone scenarios that utilize the new features, while all races gain defensive structures when defending in siege battles. New specializations and upgrades are also available, including unique civilization advancements that can only be used once per game by the first player to meet a certain criterion. A new mode called \\"Seals of Power\\" allows an additional victory condition where players must seize and defend a number of independently guarded seals randomly placed across each map. Eternal Lords A second expansion titled \\"Eternal Lords\\" was released 14 April 2015 digitally, a year after the original game's release. This expansion is more substantial - featuring two new playable races, the humanoid ice dweller \\"Frostlings\\" and the bipedal-feline \\"Tigrans\\" from previous Age of Wonders. The second major addition is a new Necromancer class for all races who specializes in raising the dead, ghoul versions of race specific units and spreading disease. Both major additions come with further new units, abilities and play styles. The expansion also features new mechanics to the core gameplay such as new specializations for good, neutral and evil alignments including powerful new units and powers and considerations for race relations that can impact empire development and diplomacy. In addition, cosmic happenings that can alter or provoke players on the map and a new \\"Unifier\\" victory type for both randomly generated and new pre-set games where players must construct unity beacons in order to win. A new campaign story about the struggling Frostling kingdom from the point of view of the Frostling Necromancer Arvik the Dark incorporates the new elements, giving player choice throughout the story. A free update was also released alongside the second expansion to improve variety between the playable races such as race specific bonuses and unit updates. Soundtrack The soundtrack of the game was composed by Michiel van den Bos, a Dutch musician and disc jockey who had previously worked on Triumph Studios' past developed titles including Overlord and Overlord II and first game in the Age of Wonders series, in addition to other studios' games including Unreal Tournament and Deus Ex. Many of the tracks from the original game were remade; Van den Bos noted that the newer technology available has allowed him to create these tracks as they \\"sounded in his head\\" when he was working on original Age of Wonders. Reception Age of Wonders III received a positive reception on release. Adam Smith reviewing for Rock, Paper, Shotgun called Age of Wonders III \\"solidly constructed\\", praising the customization options and map generator for being able to \\"create interesting and attractive worlds\\", along with the battle system, calling it \\"cleverly... integrated\\". Maxwell McGee of GameSpot also enjoyed the combat, feeling it was \\"where Age of Wonders III really shines\\", calling them \\"tactically rewarding\\" in addition to \\"streamlined empire management\\", yet was critical of the initial releases familiarity between races, their units and how they play. Colin Campell reviewing for Polygon noted the degree of strategy within the gameplay, stating that \\"this is truly a grand strategy game; brains are a non-optional component to victory\\", positively commenting on the level of shifting difficulty and events throughout the average game before concluding that it is \\"tough to wield so much power, but control is hard-earned. As it should be\\". Richard Cobbett of PC Gamer also noted the general streamlining of the gameplay yet still called it \\"far from an easy one... Age of Wonders III takes no prisoners in either its strategic or tactical game\\", with the core gameplay as being \\"immediately engaging\\" for players. Cobbett went on to mention certain comparisons to Civilization V, noting the emphasis strategic battles, that \\"Age of Wonders III isn't remotely trying to be Civ 5 and its pace and your ability to roll with the punches is to its credit\\", however in regards to other features in the 4X genre he was critical of them in the game as \\"feeling overly clipped\\". Joe Robinson of Strategy Informer also drew comparisons to Civilization V but felt the game was still \\"more creative with the fairly rigid 'Civ' template\\". Rowan Kaiser at IGN however was not favorable of the story campaign mode due to what he considered \\"too-huge maps and insta-fail conditions\\", instead preferring the \\"small, crowded maps that forced more tactical battles\\". Reviews for the Golden Realms expansion were positive, with an average critic score of 82/100 on Metacritic. Tom Chick for Quarter to Three praised the addition of the Halflings and their unique gameplay compared to the other races and the new Seals of Power victory condition, calling it the \\"best-case scenario for how to do DLC\\". The Eternal Lords expansion similarly received a positive response, with a Metacritic score of 80/100. Daniel Starkey for GameSpot praised the new races and class and the variety they added to the base game and the addition role-playing elements, concluding the review by stating \\"Strategy game legend and Civilization creator Sid Meier once said, 'Games are a series of interesting decisions.' By that metric, Age of Wonders III: Eternal Lords is excellent\\", yet in reference to McGee's earlier review for GameSpot stated that it still \\"carries a few problems over from its core game.\\" By March 2016, Age of Wonders III had sold 500,000 copies.

The ethnic Mon commander was originally a minister at the court of King Takayutpi of Hanthawaddy but joined Tabinshwehti's service in 1536 and rose to be one of the top advisers to the Toungoo king. He is most well known for planning and commanding the 1541 naval attack on Martaban (Mottama) that finally breached the defenses of the last Hanthawaddy holdout, and ended the Toungoo‚ÄìHanthawaddy War (1534‚Äì41). Military career =Switching to Tabinshwehti's side= Smim Payu was a minister at the court of King Takayutpi and a general in the Hanthawaddy Army. He battled Toungoo forces early in the Toungoo‚ÄìHanthawaddy War (1534‚Äì41). In November 1536, he commanded a cavalry battalion in the Hanthawaddy regiments sent to the front to meet the invading Toungoo forces on their way to Pegu, the capital of Hanthawaddy. The opposing armies met near Kawliya (modern Thongwa, Bago Region), and the Hanthawaddy army was defeated. Payu himself was captured.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 186 After the capture, Payu decided to switch sides. He was made a senior commander in the Toungoo army and an adviser to King Tabinshwehti. In the 1538‚Äì1539 campaign that finally captured Pegu, Payu commanded one of the seven flotillas that chased the retreating Hanthawaddy forces.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 190 =Battle of Martaban (1540‚Äì1541)= A European galliot of the era He made his name at the battle of Martaban. The city of Martaban (Mottama) on the upper Tenasserim coast was the last Hanthawaddy holdout. In November 1541, Toungoo forces laid siege to the port city. He led an army at first but was later reassigned to take command of the Toungoo navy with the rank of admiral (; lit. \\"Minister of War Boats\\").Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 181‚Äì182(Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 182): Tabinshwehti was the first Burmese king on record to use the term wun (lit. \\"one who bears the responsibility\\"). Earlier kings simply used the term amat () (meaning \\"minister\\") for senior court officials. For months, Toungoo forces tried but could not break through the wealthy port's heavily fortified defenses that included Portuguese mercenaries, firearms and warships. Toungoo armies could not even get near the high walls of the city defended by Portuguese muskets and cannon. Payu's \\"navy\\", which consisted of small war boats, too was unable to take on seven Portuguese warships guarding the harbor. Payu then proposed a plan to the Toungoo command that the main attack needed go through the harbor. The king, who was personally leading the siege, accepted the plan, and appointed him to carry it out. The admiral went up the Salween river with thousands of men, and built two types of rafts. One type contained bamboo towers higher than the walls of the port. The others were fire-rafts. In May 1541, seven months into the siege and only weeks away from the rainy season, several fire-rafts \\"with flames higher than a toddy tree\\" came floating down the river toward the Portuguese ships guarding the harbor. Three of the seven Portuguese ships fled to the sea. The remaining four ships were either burned or captured. Then the rafts with mounted bamboo towers, crammed with troops and musketeers, slipped past the wreckage, and made it to the wall by the harbor. The Toungoo troops, who were exchanging musket fire with the defenders on the wall, then jumped over and soon won a foothold. The city fell, and the upper Tenasserim coast came under Toungoo rule.Harvey 1925: 156Htin Aung 1967: 110 Payu was showered with awards by the grateful king. He was given Myaungmya in fief and assigned his own cavalry and elephant regiments. He was also given the responsibility to administer the newly enlarged kingdom with Bayinnaung, the king's deputy.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 201 =Battle of Prome (1541‚Äì1542, 1543‚Äì1544)= Payu was the joint commander of the navy (with Nanda Yawda, governor of Thamyindon) in Toungoo's November 1541 attack on Prome Kingdom.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 203, 209 Toungoo forces took the city of Prome (Pyay) in May 1542. In response, Prome's erstwhile overlord Confederation of Shan States tried to retake Prome in December 1543. Payu was one of the three top military strategists (along with Bayinnaung and Saw Lagun Ein) advising the king. (Payu and Lagun Ein were under the command of Bayinnaung.) Faced with an impending naval and land invasion, the troika advised that Toungoo forces focus on defeating the Confederation's navy first. Their strategy, Payu noted, was modeled after the strategy used by King Razadarit against King Minkhaung I in the Forty Years' War.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 217‚Äì220 Tabinshwehti agreed. In December 1543, the Toungoo navy lured the Confederation navy (consisted of 30 large war boats, 30 fast war boats, and 50 cargo ships) to an area where the Toungoo armies had set up artillery on both banks of the Irrawaddy. The Confederation navy was smashed by artillery fire. Without naval support, the 16,000-strong Confederation armies could not break Toungoo lines, and retreated after a month in January 1544.Harvey 1925: 157‚Äì158 Death Smim Payu died in late 1544.Chronicles (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 222‚Äì223) simply state that he died in 906 ME (29 March 1544 to 29 March 1545). But since the entry on his death comes after the entry on the king's palace addition in Natdaw 906 ME (15 November 1544 to 13 December 1544), he likely died sometime between 15 November 1544 and 29 March 1545. Moreover, the entry on his death is followed by the entry on the Confederation's attack on Salin, which also took place in 906 ME. Since most campaigns took place early in the dry season (November/December), Payu most likely died in November/December 1544. He was deeply respected by the ethnic Mon lords of Lower Burma.

Unlike a traditional studio flat, residents may also have access to a communal kitchen, communal bathroom/shower, patio and roof garden. The microapartments are often designed for futons, or with pull-down beds, folding desks and tables, and extra-small or hidden appliances. They differ from bedsits, the traditional British bed- sitting room, in that they are self-contained, with their own bathroom, toilet, and kitchenette. Microapartments are becoming popular in urban centres in Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and North America, maximizing profits for developers and landlords and providing relatively low-priced accommodation. In Rome, where the average price of property in 2010 was $7,800 per square metre ($725 per square foot), microapartments as small as 4 square metres (45 square feet) have been advertised. In 2018, newly built one-room rentals in San Francisco at the Starcity development, aimed at high-income tenants, were referred to as single room occupancy rooms \\"by another name\\". Bedrooms in microapartments need to be tiny and may also serve as a living room. Countries =Hong Kong= Gary Chang, an architect in Hong Kong, has designed a large 32-square-metre (344 sq ft) microapartment with sliding walls attached to tracks on the ceiling. By moving the walls around, and using built-in folding furniture and worktops, he can convert the space into 24 different rooms, including a kitchen, library, laundry room, dining room, bar and video-game room. In Hong Kong, developers are embracing the micro-living trend, renting microapartments at sky-high prices. The Wall Street Journal compares the 180-square-feet flat in High Place, Sai Ying Pun to the size of a U.S. parking spot (160 square feet) in a video, highlighting the soaring property prices in Hong Kong (one of the apartments in High Place was sold for more than US$500,000 in June 2015). =United States= In the United States, most cities have zoning codes that set the minimum size for a housing unit (often 400 square feet) as well as the number of non-related persons who can live together in one unit. In January 2013, New York City got its first microapartment building, with 55 units that are as small as and ceilings from . Common's Williamsburg in Brooklyn rents single rooms where tenants share a kitchen for $2,050 per month; The Guardian states that \\"[s]ingle room occupancy housing is obviously not a new concept, however, the genius of late capitalism is that it has made it desirable\\" to high-income renters. In 2017, California passed a law which encourages development of \\"efficiency units\\" of at least 150 sq ft by disallowing localities from limiting their numbers near public universities and public transportation. In San Francisco, Starcity is converting unused parking garages, commercial spaces and offices into single room residential units, where tenants (tech professionals are the typical renter) get a furnished bedroom and access to wifi, janitor services and common kitchens and lounges for $1,400 to $2,400 per month, an approach that has been called \\"dorm living for grown ups\\". Boston's first microapartment building opened in August 2016, on Commonwealth Avenue in Packard's Corner. As the largest microapartment building in the United States, the building is currently being leased by Boston University to house 341 students during the renovation of another university residence. The building contains 180 units that each contain a bathroom with stand-up shower; a kitchen with all stainless-steel appliances that include an oven, a microwave, a dishwasher, and a refrigerator. Each unit also includes a stand up washer-dryer unit. Other amenities include an optional parking garage and indoor bike room in the basement, currently unused retail space, a lounge space, a rooftop penthouse, a deck overlooking the Allston neighbors, and an entertainment room that will be converted to a fitness center at the end of the University's tenure at the property, which is anticipated to be in 2018. Indianapolis micro-units are becoming popular as a way to get a downtown rental location.Micro-apartments becoming popular in Indy Tiny apartments began as a coastal city trend but they are spreading to the Midwestern United States.Micro-Apartments Are Coming to the Midwest There has been a backlash in some cities against the increasing number of microapartments. In Seattle, some residents have complained that high-density microhousing changes the character of neighbourhoods, suddenly increasing demand for parking spaces and other amenities. From 2009 to 2014, Seattle had a big increase in the building and creation of new single room occupancy (SRO) units designed to be rented at market rates, which had an average monthly rent of $660; In 2013, for example, 1,800 SRO units and microapartment units were built. In 2018, the media depicted the increasing popularity of micro apartments as a new trend; however, an article about Seattle in Market Urbanism Report states this is a \\"reenactment of the way U.S. cities have long worked\\", as individuals seeking \\"solo living and centralized locations\\" are willing to accept smaller apartments even though the per-square-foot prices may be higher than some larger units. The report states that 2018-era micro apartments were known as SROs in the early 20th century, and they housed \\"rich and poor alike\\" (although the rich lived in live-in luxury hotels and the poor lived in \\"bunkhouses for day laborers\\"). Neighborhood groups in Seattle have criticized new micro apartment SRO units, arguing that they \\"harmed community character and provided...inhumane living conditions; concerns\\"; the city passed regulations that outlawed micro apartment/SRO construction. =United Kingdom= In the UK, property developers are using office-to-residential permitted development rights, a policy introduced in 2013, to transform old office buildings into microapartment developments. The nationally described space standard stipulates that new homes in the UK cannot be smaller than 37sqm; however, this does not apply to conversions. London-based developer Inspired Homes has taken advantage of office-to-residential permitted development rights to deliver over 400 microapartments. A micro-property in the UK has no strict definition but typically refers to properties with a floor area below 37sqm. Which? magazine reported that almost 8,000 new micro-homes were built in 2016, the highest number on record. As of 2017, the largest microapartment building in the world is The Collective Old Oak, which opened in London on May 1, 2016. Designed by PLP Architecture, the development has 546 rooms with most units grouped into \\"twodios\\" ‚Äì two en-suite bedrooms that share a small kitchenette. There are also some private suites. The units sizes range from for an ensuite rooms with a shared kitchenette, to for a shared ensuite and shared ensuite with kitchenette. Each floor features one larger kitchen with a dining table, which is shared between 30 and 70 residents, and themed communal living spaces such as a games room, a cinema, a 'disco-launderette', a hidden garden and a spa. A restaurant, gym and co-working spaces are located in the lower floors of the building. Pros and cons Although some prefer to live in microapartments, others only temporarily live in microapartments due to economic reasons, and would move to a larger house or apartment if they could afford to do so. Susan Saegert, a professor of environmental psychology at the CUNY Graduate Center was quoted with her opinion on microapartments, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve studied children in crowded apartments and low-income housing a lot,‚Äù Saegert said, ‚Äúand they can end up becoming withdrawn, and have trouble studying and concentrating.‚Äù The small size of a microapartment can be an issue with some tenants, as its confined nature may permit strong odors to linger.

One of the most prominent Asian archaeologists, he was awarded the Grand Prize of the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize in 1996 by the Japanese city of Fukuoka. Wang specializes in the archaeology of China's Han and Tang dynasties, as well as Japanese archaeology. He is noted for his achievements in the study of ancient Sino-Japanese relations. Biography Wang Zhongshu was born in 1925 in Ningbo, Zhejiang province during the Republic of China era. His father was a high school Chinese teacher who also worked for Tian Yi Ge, one of the oldest libraries in China. Influenced by his father, Wang was well versed in classical Chinese literature and history. During the Japanese invasion of China he was forced to flee his hometown as a refugee and completed his middle school education while on the run. After the end of World War II, Wang was accepted by several top Chinese universities in 1946, and chose to enter Zhejiang University in his home province, where he studied under the historian Tan Qixiang and excelled in the subjects of Chinese history and the Japanese language. In 1949 the Communists won the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China. Zhejiang University was being reorganized by the new government, and following Tan's advice, Wang Zhongshu decided to transfer to Peking University. After graduating from the Department of History of Peking University in July 1950, Wang joined the newly established Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, working and studying under Xia Nai, the institute's vice director who is considered a founder of modern Chinese archaeology. After the major disruptions of the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì76), during which numerous intellectuals, including Xia Nai, were persecuted, in 1978 Wang became the vice director of the Institute of Archaeology, still working under Xia Nai, now director. He succeeded Xia as director of the institute in 1982, and held the position until 1988. Wang died on 24 September 2015. Academic achievements Wang's career path was a life spent in important historical sites undertaking excavations. In October 1950 he joined his first major excavation in Huixian, Henan province, focussing on Han dynasty tombs under the guidance of Xia Nai. From 1956 to 1962 he was the lead archaeologist in the excavation of the Han capital Chang'an. In 1964 Wang oversaw the excavations of the Balhae tombs in Dunhua, Jilin and Shangjing Longquanfu, the Balhae capital in Ning'an, Heilongjiang. His excavation report for the Balhae projects won an award from the National Social Science Fund and the Guo Moruo Chinese History Prize. His other major excavation projects include those of the Changsha and Mancheng Han tombs. In Mancheng, he excavated and studied the tomb of King Jing of Zhongshan and his wife. In 1959 Wang published a paper in the Chinese journal Kaogu (Archaeology), comparing the King of Dian gold seal which had been discovered in China's Yunnan province in 1956, with the King of Na gold seal of Japan. The authenticity of the King of Na seal, discovered in Fukuoka in 1784, had been in doubt. By comparing the similarities between the two seals, both cast by Han Dynasty emperors, Wang convincingly proved its authenticity. Wang's work revolved around the Warring States period, and the Qin, Han, Sui, and Tang dynasties. He contributed immensely to the study of the Han dynasty. He treated features such as China's castle town systems and tomb-building methods extensively in his works. It was his numerous years of work on archaeological sites that gave him the deep knowledge of the period. Wang was known for his unique approach and study of subjects ranging from castle towns, tombs, and ancient bronze mirrors. His contributions to the development of archaeology in China earned much reverence in the country as well as academic circles in Asia. He was an honorary professor of the National Cuzco University of Peru, a corresponding member of the German Archaeological Institute, and an evaluation committee member of the Asian History Association of Japan. =Archaeology in Japan= After the discovery in 1972 of the Takamatsuzuka Tomb in Japan, Wang developed a deeper interest in Japanese archaeology and history. He focused his research on sankakubuchishinjukyo, the triangular-rimmed bronze mirrors bearing mythical and animal designs, which were discovered in the tomb. The research led Wang to propose a new theory about the history of Sino-Japanese relations. Selected works *Han Civilization (1982), translated by K. C. Chang and collaborators.

She is known for work that draws from a mix of biblical, historical, and autobiographical themes.  Life and career  = Early life = Malcah Zeldis was born in the Bronx, New York, and raised in a Jewish ghetto in Detroit, Michigan. Her father faced work discrimination for his religion and the family was poor, but eventually moved to a middle-class neighborhood. However, Zeldis looks back on her years in Detroit fondly, stating that what she remembers best is the nature. She also remembers weekend visits to the Detroit Institute of Arts where she recalls being taken by brightly colored Flemish paintings full of small figures. These paintings would later inspire her colorful works with many small figures. = Israel = As a non-devout Jew, Zeldis felt disconnected from her people and wanted to explore her heritage. She moved to Israel in 1949 at the age of eighteen, becoming a Zionist and working on a kibbutz. It was here that Zeldis met her future husband, Hiram Zeldis. The two went back to the US to marry, and then returned to the kibbutz. Zeldis began painting, yet had little confidence in the quality of her work. However, Aaron Giladi, a well known Israeli artist visited the kibbutz and praised Zeldis‚Äôs paintings. Zeldis was overwhelmed by his regard and his request for two paintings, saying, \\"I lost my voice from excitement‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt go to his lecture I was so emotionally upset. I heard afterwards that he said I was a great artist\\". Giladi‚Äôs compliments came with constructive criticism; his suggestion to paint larger intimidated Zeldis. After trying and failing to use larger canvases she stopped painting for a period of time, which was extended by childbirth and a permanent move to Brooklyn, New York. = Brooklyn = Zeldis finally resumed painting twenty- three years later, as her children grew older and her marriage ended. She enrolled in Brooklyn College as an Early Childhood Studies major in 1970. The college had a \\"life experience\\" policy, which prompted Zeldis to submit her paintings despite continued apprehension over whether they were good enough. Much to her surprise, Zeldis's paintings were well received and her teacher introduced her work to an art critic, who further suggested showing her work to dealers. This period was a turning point for Zeldis, as she realized that her lack of training was not a barrier to the art world. It was around this time that she observed Haitian folk art in a gallery. She found Haitian folk art very stylistically similar to her own, and finally believed that she was an artist. Zeldis began painting seriously and had a number of gallery shows. Her work also appeared in books such as the International Dictionary of Naive Art and Moments in Jewish Life: The Folk Art of Malcah Zeldis. Zeldis later illustrated a number of children's books in collaboration with her daughter, Yona Zeldis.  Painting style  Zeldis's paintings are generally flat, lacking proportion, and brightly colored with busy compositions featuring crisply defined figures. Critics describe her colors as being explosive. Zeldis's works include everyday objects that ground the viewers in reality, yet include surprising subjects such as presidents, leading ladies, and biblical characters. Her whimsical images contain a number of storytelling devices and attempt to convey a narrative. After recovering from cancer in 1986, Zeldis was too weak to lift the masonite boards she regularly used, and instead painted on corrugated cardboard found in the street.  Children's book illustration  Malcah Zeldis collaborated with her daughter, Yona Zeldis, to write and illustrate a number of children's books. Yona says, \\"The collaboration I really owe to her. She really wanted to do a children's book with me, and I said, 'No no no no no, I can't do that,' and she said, 'Yes you can.' She persisted and in effect brought me a contract.\\" Zeldis and her daughter have written and illustrated Eve and Her Sisters: Women of the Old Testament, God Sent a Rainbow and Other Bible Stories, Anne Frank, Sisters in Strength: American Women Who Made a Difference, and Hammerin' Hank. Malcah Zeldis has also illustrated Honest Abe and Martin Luther King. Selected works *Miss Liberty Celebration, 1987, oil on corrugated cardboard, 54 1/2 x 36 1/2 in.

The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 et seq. is the major Federal law that authorizes and governs leasing of public lands for developing deposits of hydrocarbons and other minerals. Previous to the act, these materials were subject to mining claims under the General Mining Act of 1872. In BP America Production Co. v. Burton, 549 U.S. 84 (2006), the Supreme Court held that a statute of limitations does not apply to government actions for contract claims for an agency to recover royalties on such leases. Concerned that a predicted immanent shortage of petroleum would not leave enough fuel for naval vessels, President William Howard Taft established the first Naval Petroleum Reserve by withdrawing Federal land over the Elk Hills Oil Field in California from being claimed and drilled by private companies.

The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope.Gas Hydrates on Alaska's North Slope . * Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers, and large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well. As of 2001, the state's Energy Plan stated that, although wind and hydroelectric power are abundant, with low-cost electric interties they were judged uneconomical.Screening Report for Alaska Rural Energy Plan, April 2001 Likewise, Alaska receives a large proportion of its state revenues from its severance tax on oil: a full 68% of all revenue, much more than any state (only Wyoming coming close).

It lost out to the Ilyushin Il-28 'Beagle'. Development The Tupolev OKB continued to develop the Tu-2 line with the advent of gas turbine power-plants. The Tu-8 ('69')was redesigned with two Rolls-Royce Nene I turbojet engines, replacing the piston engines in new nacelles. The new design was given the OKB designation '72' and official designation Tu-18 2 √ó Nene I, but was abandoned due to the more promising '73' design soaking up resources. Following the general arrangement of the Tu-2- Tu-8, '72', the initial '73' short-range bomber (official designation; Tu-20 2 √ó Nene I) had a shoulder mounted wing, a large unswept fin and rudder with integral dorsal fin, tri-cycle undercarriage and engines in long under-slung nacelles at about 1/3 span, which also housed the main undercarriage legs, when retracted. Before the design was finalised it was discovered that the Nene I engines were producing less power than expected; and not the expected , necessitating the addition of a Rolls-Royce Derwent V booster engine in the rear fuselage, exhausting at the base of the fin. The three-engined '73' (official designation; Tu-14 2 √ó Nene I + 1 √ó Derwent V) was accepted for development and the '73' first flew on 29 December 1947, with flight tests continuing until 31 May 1949, with promising results, resulting in a production order for ten '73S' pre-production prototypes, powered by RD-45 and RD-500 (Soviet production Nene and Derwent engines). None of the pre-production order were completed but parts manufactured at GAZ-23 were absorbed by the Tupolev Tu-14 production line at GAZ-39. Further development of the '73' line resulted in the photo-reconnaissance '73R' / '78' (official designation; Tu-16 2 √ó Nene I + 1 √ó Derwent V). The '78' was outwardly identical to the '73' with the exception of a retractable conical shutter over the intake of the rear fuselage Derwent at the forward end of the dorsal fillet. The '78' first flew on 7 May 1948 and conducted flight trials of the photographic equipment, which were unsatisfactory. Improvements to the photographic equipment notwithstanding the Council of Ministers cancelled all further development or production of the '73', '78' and '79' on 14 May 1949. Two more phot-recce projects were designed both similar to the '73' and '78'. The first '79' (official designation; Tu-30 2 √ó Nene I + 1 √ó Derwent V) was not proceeded with. The second '79' (official designation; Tu-20 2 √ó VK-1 + 1 x RD-500), was to have utilised an uncompleted '73S' airframe but development was cancelled as noted above. The VVS (Voyenno-Vozdushnyye Sily - Soviet air force) rejected the three-engined bombers as they were averse to fielding aircraft with two engine types. They were also more in favour of the Ilyushin Il-28 for medium bomber roles. The AV-MF (Aviatsiya Voyenno-Morskogo Flota - naval aviation), however, were in need of a torpedo bomber which was developed from the final '73' iteration, the '81 (official designation; Tu-14 2 √ó VK-1) as the '81T' (official designation; Tu-14T 2 √ó VK-1).

The vessel was constructed in 1906 at Okanagan Landing and launched in 1907, becoming Okanagan Lake's second steamship (after the SS Aberdeen). She linked the transportation hubs at both the north and south ends of Okanagan Lake (Vernon and Penticton, respectively, aiding the development of interior British Columbia with other steamships of the 1900s. The ship was retired in 1934 and sold for scrap and spare parts. Only the Stern Saloon, a room in the back of the upper deck, remains. It was moved to the SS Sicamous Heritage Park in Penticton in 2002, to undergo restoration work. Commission and construction The SS Okanagan was commissioned by the Canadian Pacific Railway company in 1906 to replace the aging SS Aberdeen, the first steamer on Okanagan Lake, and link communities along the lake to facilitate trade and transportation in the Okanagan Valley. A similar ship named Kuskanook was built in 1906 for Kootenay Lake to aid Moyie with increasing passenger demand. The construction of Okanagan freed Aberdeen to transport freight. Construction began in the spring of 1906 at Okanagan Landing with James Bulger as master ship builder. The steel hull was built first, and the wooden interior was constructed after. Lightweight wood was chosen for the carpentry work as it would reduce the overall weight of the ship, allowing for greater loads of freight. The low strength of the lighter wood was remedied through the use of haug posts, large cross-laminate timber beams essential in maintaining the structural integrity of the ship, anchored in the steel hull. The keel was laid on July 10. Although the work was not completely finished, the ship was launched on April 16, 1907: \\"A special train brought guests to the Landing for launching ceremonies...the beautiful boat then floated out on the bosom of Okanagan Lake as graceful as a swan.\\" Mrs. Gore, wife of Captain Gore, manager of the British Columbia Lake and River Service in the early 1900s, named the ship after Okanagan Lake and the couple hosted a ball in the evening among other festivities. =Design= The Canadian Pacific Lake and River Service preferred to use stern wheelers for transportation on Okanagan Lake because of their rugged nature and ease of maintenance. The flexibility of the stern wheeler was also well-respected at the time because it allowed the vessel to work in waters where propeller or screw-driven vessels could not. The Canadian Pacific Lake and River Service operated many steam vessels from the late 1800s to mid-1930s and relied on proven designs, with a preference for more rugged and durable vessels. However, the infrastructure and machinery required to service the more modern ships were unavailable in the interior of British Columbia, requiring all new ships to be built using older techniques and designs. As such, these stern wheelers, despite being well-suited to the varying Okanagan conditions, seemed rather modest when compared to the more contemporary boat designs. Okanagan was designed under a similar style to its successful predecessor, SS Rossland. With a length of , width of , hull depth of , and gross tonnage of 1,008 tons, Okanagan was slightly larger than Rossland. The hull was formed into a deep lake boat pattern, allowing the ship to reach speeds not possible for a riverboat of similar proportions. The ship was designed with an eye for elegance, resulting in a graceful silhouette that lacked the boxy or top-heavy look privy to many other vessels. The layout was similar to other Canadian Pacific vessels, with three main decks (bottom-most for freight, machinery and crew's quarters, upper-most decks reserved for passenger travel and comfort with sitting rooms, galleries, observation decks, a dining hall and saloons). Okanagan boasted five dining room tables, with seating for up to thirty guests at a time, along with thirty-two staterooms and a total passenger capacity of four hundred. Mechanically speaking, Okanagan was of typical design. A large boiler provided the steam necessary to power each engine and run the on-board dynamo. The boiler itself was coal-fired and, like other boilers of its time, was certified to provide steam pressure up to . This steam was transmitted to the rear of the ship (by means of a bulkhead) where the engines drove the paddle wheel, after which the excess steam would be condensed back to its original liquid state and returned to the boiler by the jet condenser. Service The SS Okanagan served the communities of the Okanagan for 27 years, from 1907‚Äì1934. She was faster, larger, and more luxurious than Aberdeen, greatly improving the service around Okanagan Lake. She provided daily passenger service with stops at Kelowna, Peachland, Summerland and Penticton while Aberdeen took care of freight and smaller communities three times a week. This helped the rapid development in population, agriculture, and economy of the Okanagan that was taking place during this time. She was greatly appreciated by the communities she served, during and after her service. The Okanagan Semi-Weekly, a newspaper, reported soon after the launching: \\"The new CPR steamer Okanagan made a distance of 65 miles in three hours and fifteen minutes, or at the rate of over 21 miles per hour. She's a greyhound....\\" Okanagan and Kuskanook were also called two of the most beautiful lake and river steamers in western North America.Vernon Museum and Archives =Murder= Constable Aston of Penticton was shot and killed on the SS Okanagan in 1912. The case began when Walter Poelke, going under the name of Walter Byde James, held up a store in a small community named Okanagan Mission. There were only $15 in the store at the time, with which he fled to the city of Penticton, two days to the south on foot, meeting up with an accomplice named Frank Wilson on the way. They were arrested in a hotel by Chief Roche and Constable Aston, who found and confiscated several weapons and 200 rounds of ammunition on James. James and Wilson were put on the SS Okanagan to be transported to Kelowna, escorted by Constable Aston. However, the police had not found a pistol during the initial search, with which James shot Constable Aston before Okanagan arrived at Peachland. James and Wilson escaped by getting off the ship at Peachland. When Constable Aston and the escape were discovered, 200 armed men from all over the valley hunted for them until two special constables found and arrested them at Wilson's Landing, a community north of Kelowna. They were put under heavy guard and Okanagan took them to jail in Kelowna, where they were later transferred to jail in Kamloops and tried for the murder of Constable Aston. Wilson claimed to be an unwilling partner in the affair and turned King's Evidence. James' trial was held on May 12, 1912 in Vernon, where the jury found him guilty of \\"a most cold-blooded and atrocious murder.\\" On Friday, August 9, 1912, Walter James Poelke, 24 years of age, was hanged at Kamloops for the willful murder of Constable G. H. Aston. Retirement and restoration The steamboat era came to a close in the 1930s‚Äì1940s due to technological advancement and other forms of transportation. With the construction of highways and railways, passenger service by boat was no longer needed and Okanagan spent her last years transporting freight and pushing barges. She was retired in 1934 and sold in 1938 to be dismantled for scrap and spare parts. However, the SS Sicamous Restoration Society, a \\"charity...dedicated to protecting the Marine Heritage of the Okanagan,\\" found her Stern Saloon being used as a beach hut and moved it to the SS Sicamous Heritage Park in Penticton in 2002 to undergo restoration. Also in the park are the SS Sicamous, SS Naramata, and Canadian National Tug #6.

It was built from 1915 to 1916 by the Grand Army of the Republic as a memorial to soldiers who died in the American Civil War. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 due to its architecture and importance in local history. History Black Hawk County Soldiers Memorial Hall was built by the Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.) from 1915 to 1916. Local chapters of the G.A.R. built the hall as a memorial to soldiers who had lost their lives in the American Civil War. The construction was funded by a special tax levy in the amount of $14,000. When ground was broken for construction, current newspapers and membership lists of local patriotic organizations and G.A.R. posts were placed inside the cornerstone. A Waterloo local, H. R. Griffith, was originally supposed to speak at the 1916 dedication ceremony, but could not due to being ill. She was the Department Secretary of the Woman's Relief Corps, which is part of the Grand Army of the Republic. The role was then taken by a resident of Iowa Falls, who was previously the Department President. Design and features The building was designed in the Classical Revival style by John G. Ralston, a prominent local architect in Waterloo. It was influenced in part by the work of the American Prairie School architect, George W. Maher. The building has two stories and includes a kitchen, a dining room, and meeting rooms. The second floor houses a library that now includes a display of Civil War uniforms, artifacts, medals and weapons. The building is located adjacent to Cedar River and the Waterloo's Soldiers and Sailors Park. The park includes a fountain, a pool, and a miniature Statue of Liberty. Historic designation and recent history The Black Hawk County Soldiers Memorial Hall was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1987. The nomination was based on the fact that other local veterans halls from the area had been significantly altered in various respects, whereas the Waterloo facility had substantially maintained its original appearance and integrity. The nomination was accepted, and the building was listed on the NRHP in 1988. When John Kerry ran for President of the United States in 2004, he visited the building to hold a meeting, in which he stated that he wanted veterans to be \\"a driving force leading up to Iowa's caucuses\\". In May 2011, a POW-MIA monument was unveiled in the park near the hall. The hall is also the site of local Memorial Day commemorations.

In particular, the Dejter graph admits a 3-factorization into two copies of the Ljubljana graph, which is the third smallest existing semi- symmetric cubic graph of regular degree 3. In fact, it is proven that the Dejter graph can be 2-colored, say in the color set {red, blue}, as in the top figure to the right, so that both the resulting edge-monochromatic red and blue vertex-spanning subgraphs are copies of the Ljubljana graph. These two copies contain exactly the 112 vertices of the Dejter graph and 168 edges each, having both copies girth 10, while the Dejter graph has girth 6 and the 7-cube girth 4. It seems that the Dejter graph is the smallest symmetric graph having a connected self-complementary vertex-spanning semi-symmetric cubic subgraph. Both the red and blue vertex-spanning Ljubljana subgraphs of the Dejter graph can be presented as covering graphs of the Heawood graph, namely as 8-covers of the Heawood graph. This is suggested in each of the two representations of the Ljubljana graph, (red above, blue below, both to the right), by alternately coloring the inverse images of successive vertices of the Heawood graph, say in black and white (better viewed by twice clicking on images for figure enlargements), according to the Heawood graph bipartition. Each such inverse image is formed by the 8 neighbors, along a fixed coordinate direction of the 7-cube, of the half of the Hamming code having a fixed weight, 0 or 1. By exchanging these weights via the permutation (0 1), one can pass from the adjacency offered by the red Ljubljana graph to the one offered by the blue Ljubljana graph, or vice versa. One seventh of the Dejter graph appears in a separate figure down below that can be obtained from the two resulting copies of the Heawood graph.

It was opened as an all-female residence in 1970, but became a co-ed residence in 2012 on the UNB Fredericton campus. The house holds many traditions such as the charity drive Pushing Carts to Warm Hearts, Hawaiian Luau Dance in orientation week and the biggest Halloween Social on campus. The mascot of Tibbits Hall is the Tibbits Tornadoes and the house color consists of red and white.  History  Mary K. Tibbits Mary K. Tibbits Hall, more commonly known as Tibbits Hall, was established in 1970 as an all-female house. It was named after Mary Kingsley Tibbits (BA, MA, LL.D.) who in 1889 was the first female graduate of the University of New Brunswick. Tibbits Hall was located beside Lady Dunn Hall which was also an all-female residence. In 1998, Tibbits Hall was joined by Lady Dunn Hall when the residence complex was reconfigured, with the co-ed Joy Kidd House now in the former Lady Dunn Hall building, and Dunn Hall becoming a smaller residence for women behind Kidd House. The three residences formed the Dunn/Kidd/Tibbits \\"DKT\\" complex with its own meal hall inside. In 2011, the house went through a big renovation and had to function as a small residence with approximately 30 female students. During that time, Tibbits residents were moved to the 3T wing of Joy Kidd House. In 2012, UNB Residential Life & Conferencing Services decided to change the house into co-ed style due to the lack of enrolments in single-sex residences. This left UNB Fredericton with only one all-male and one all-female residence (as Neville/Jones, a former all-male residence was made co-ed in 2011-2012). The transition received mixed responses from the residence community and it was one of the most controversial topics of that year. Started from the school year of 2012 - 2013, Tibbits Hall returned to its original location before the renovation and functioned as a co-ed residence on UNB Fredericton campus. Tibbits saw its first male president in 2013 and remained one of, if not, the best residences on UNB Fredericton campus with great pride and tremendous passion.  Residence organization and house governance  There are fourteen residences at UNB as of 2013, one men's, one women's, ten co-ed, one apartment style, and one suite style residence. Each residence has its own unique characters, cultures and traditions. = House team = House Don is a university faculty, staff member, or a senior grad student living in the house who is responsible for the operation of Tibbits Hall. The Don is assisted by four hall proctors and an educational proctor who are senior undergraduates with the role of helping the students adjust to residence and university life. The House Team assumes the responsibility for maintaining order within the immediate vicinity of the residence and meal halls, and also has front line responsibility in crisis response. = House Committee = House Committee led by the house President is a team elected by residents of Tibbits Hall to act as peer leaders. The committee plays the main role in coordinating house social, educational, charity, athletic activities with the assistance from the Residence Coordinator and the House Team. As of 2013, Tibbits Hall House Committee includes President, Vice President, Male and Female Social Rep, Male and Female Sport Rep, Charity Rep, Merch Rep, Treasurer, Secretary and First Year Rep (aka Frosh Rep). General elections are usually held in March and First Year Rep election is held in September right after orientation week. = House Orientation Committee = House Orientation Committee (HOC) is a team consists of ten returning residents chosen by the Don and the returning President to welcome first-year students to the house. HOC acts as peer leaders during orientation week to create a welcoming environment to all the first year and make orientation week one of the best experiences of their lives. Tibbits Hall HOC jersey is red and white basketball jersey with a tornado on the front and HOC's name on the back. Tibbits Hall proctor jersey has the same design with the colors of black and red instead.

He has also consulted for several National Football League (NFL) teams. After working at Bain & Company and graduating from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Hinkie obtained a position with the NBA's Houston Rockets in 2005. Working under General Manager Daryl Morey, Hinkie promoted the use of advanced statistics. After joining the Sixers in 2013, Hinkie traded away several veterans, leading to accusations that the Sixers were \\"tanking\\" to obtain high picks in the NBA draft. Despite this criticism, Hinkie also attracted a devoted following among fans who adopted the mantra \\"trust the process,\\" which denoted faith in the Sixers' long-term hopes to compete for a championship. As general manager, Hinkie drafted players such as Joel Embiid and Dario ≈†ariƒá, and signed Robert Covington to a long-term contract. After the Sixers started the 2015-2016 season with a 1-21 record, the franchise hired Jerry Colangelo as chairman of basketball operations. Hinkie left the franchise later that season and was replaced as general manager by Bryan Colangelo. Early life and education Hinkie was born in the Netherlands in December 1977. Hinkie's father, Ron Hinkie, was an employee of Halliburton at the time of Hinkie's birth. His mother, Sarita Hinkie, was a stay-at-home parent. Hinkie's family moved to Easley, South Carolina when Hinkie was three. When Hinkie was ten years old, the family moved to Marlow, Oklahoma, the hometown of Ron Hinkie, although Ron continued to work overseas. Hinkie was the younger of two siblings; Hinkie's older brother, Bill, died shortly after the family moved to Oklahoma. In 1996, Hinkie graduated from Marlow High School, where he was valedictorian. Hinkie played defensive back for Marlow's football team and point guard for Marlow's basketball team. Hinkie graduated from the University of Oklahoma, where he served as president of the student business association and chairman of the dean's roundtable, and was named one of the top 60 undergraduates in the country by USA Today. While at Oklahoma, Hinkie met and eventually married fellow student Alison Burness, proposing to her on a bench next to the Arc de Triomphe. Following graduation, Hinkie accepted a job offer from Bain & Company, before taking a job with Bain Capital in Australia. Hinkie earned an MBA from Stanford University, during which time Hinkie advised the San Francisco 49ers and Houston Texans on draft strategies and statistical analysis. Hinkie also began working part-time with the Houston Rockets while attending Stanford. Career =Houston Rockets= Following his graduation from Stanford, Hinkie joined the Houston Rockets in 2005 as a special assistant to general manager Carroll Dawson. Hinkie was promoted to vice president in 2007, becoming the youngest vice president in the NBA; in that same year, Daryl Morey became the new Rockets general manager. Hinkie was promoted to Executive Vice President in 2010. In Houston, Hinkie promoted the use of advanced statistics in professional basketball while \\"second-in- command\\" to Morey, another widely known advocate of advanced basketball analytics. While in Houston, Hinkie played a key role in acquiring future starting point guards Kyle Lowry and Patrick Beverley. =Philadelphia 76ers= During the 2012 NBA off-season, Hinkie interviewed for the vacant position of general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, but the Sixers decided to promote Tony DiLeo to the position. The following off-season, the Sixers hired Hinkie to succeed DiLeo as general manager and Rod Thorn as president. Hinkie became the third Sixers GM since owner Josh Harris bought the Sixers in 2011. During Hinkie's tenure, the phrase \\"trust the process\\" became a mantra inside the Sixers locker room, and the phrase eventually became popular among fans as well as an expression denoting faith in the Sixers' long-term hopes to compete for a championship. In 2015, ESPN named Hinkie's Sixers as the major professional sports franchise that had most embraced analytics. Hinkie's first major move took place during the 2013 NBA Draft, when Hinkie traded All-Star point guard Jrue Holiday to the New Orleans Pelicans for the Pelicans' top-5 protected 2014 pick and Nerlens Noel. Hinkie also selected future Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams and Arsalan Kazemi in the draft. In August 2013, Hinkie hired former Spurs assistant Brett Brown as the new Sixers coach, replacing Doug Collins, who had stepped down before Hinkie's hiring. Hinkie's first year was marked with accusations that Philadelphia was \\"tanking\\" in order to get a high pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, and the Sixers tied the NBA record for longest losing streak around the time. In two trades at the 2014 NBA trade deadline, Hinkie traded veteran Sixers Evan Turner, Spencer Hawes, and Lavoy Allen, acquiring five second round picks and Henry Sims. After the season, Hinkie traded long-time Sixer Thaddeus Young to the Minnesota Timberwolves for the Miami Heat's top-10 protected 2015 first round pick, Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, and Alexey Shved. Hinkie selected Joel Embiid with the third pick of the 2014 NBA Draft During the 2014 NBA Draft, Hinkie selected Joel Embiid (who later nicknamed himself \\"the Process\\"), Dario ≈†ariƒá (after a trade that sent Elfrid Payton to the Magic), K.J. McDaniels, Jerami Grant, Vasilije Micic, and Jordan McRae; Hinkie also traded the 47th pick in the draft for NBA Development League veteran Pierre Jackson. During the 2014-2015 season, Hinkie signed D-League veteran Robert Covington to a four-year contract; alongside Noel and Carter-Williams, Covington was selected to participate in the 2015 Rising Stars Challenge. In three separate deals at the 2015 trade deadline, Hinkie traded Carter-Williams and McDaniels for Javale McGee, Isaiah Canaan, protected 2015 first round picks originally owned by the Lakers and the Thunder, and a second round pick. In the 2015 NBA draft, Hinkie selected Jahlil Okafor with the third overall pick, along with Richaun Holmes and J. P. Tokoto in the second round. During the 2015 off-season, Hinkie traded two second round picks for Nik Stauskas, Jason Thompson, Carl Landry, a 2019 first round pick, and the right to swap first round picks with Sacramento in 2016 and 2017. Because of that 2015 trade, Philadelphia would swap picks with Sacramento in the 2017 NBA Draft, moving from the 5th overall pick to the 3rd overall pick; the team would later acquire the first overall pick of the 2017 draft (Markelle Fultz) using assets acquired during Hinkie's tenure. After starting the 2015-2016 season with a 1-21 record, the Sixers hired former Phoenix Suns General Manager Jerry Colangelo as Chairman of Basketball Operations. On April 6, 2016, Sam Hinkie stepped down from his positions with the 76ers. Days after Hinkie's resignation, Jerry's son Bryan Colangelo was hired as the Sixers' general manager and president of basketball operations. Jerry Colangelo resigned from his post at the same time, but remained as a special advisor to the team. A month after Hinkie's resignation, the 10-72 76ers won the 2016 NBA Draft lottery, and the team selected Ben Simmons with the first overall pick of the 2016 NBA draft. The Sixers also selected Timoth√© Luwawu-Cabarrot and Furkan Korkmaz with first round picks that had been acquired during Hinkie's tenure. During the 2016‚Äì17 NBA season, Embiid and ≈†ariƒá both played their first games as Sixers, and both were named as finalists for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. The young players Hinkie acquired through the draft picks he had around 2014, 2016, and 2017 would later get the 76ers back into the NBA Playoffs, going as far as the Eastern Conference Semifinals in the 2017-18 season before losing to the Boston Celtics in 5 games. =Denver Broncos= On May 25, 2018, Hinkie met with the Denver Broncos to provide analytical advice after their first losing season since 2010.

Publication history The Advanced Dungeons & Dragons CD-ROM Core Rules was published by TSR, and produced by Evermore Entertainment with Victor Penman as Project Manager, released as a CD-ROM for PC only. In 1999, Wizards of the Coast released new CD-ROM titled Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Core Rules 2.0 Expansion. Contents The AD&D; CD-ROM Core Rules contains several rulebooks, both in Rich Text Format and as Windows Help files, including the Dungeon Master's Guide, the Player's Handbook, the Monstrous Manual, Tome of Magic, and Arms and Equipment Guide. It also includes a Key Topics book which summarizes the main AD&D; rules and an Instructions booklet, which explains how to use all of the rest. Hypertext links have been created for all of the main entries and rulings. There are a number of extra features, including the character generator, and tools to enable a user to update characters created with the disc and enter the details of a character which has been created using the traditional method. For the DM there's a tool which enables a user to quickly create non-player characters, a handout generator, a treasure generator based on the standard random treasure tables, a monster generator, an encounter generator and a map builder. 2.0 version additionally includes Dungeon Master Option: High-Level Campaigns, Player's Option: Combat & Tactics, Player's Option: Skills & Powers, and Player's Option: Spells & Magic. Reception Paul Pettengale reviewed the AD&D; CD-ROM Core Rules for Arcane magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. He began the review by speaking about how many books are needed to run a game of AD&D;, stating that \\"The prospect, then, of having all the main rulebooks on a CD-ROM is rather appealing, providing, of course, you've got a PC handy when you're playing your session. Few Dungeon Masters play with a PC on the gaming table [...] which seems to be a fundamental flaw with the whole premise of the Core Rules disc.\\" He found that \\"the text is very easy to read, being presented in a large enough text size to make it clearly visible even on smaller monitors. Naturally, you can print the books [...] and sections of each\\". Pettengale found the books \\"relatively easy to navigate, thanks to the hypertext links\\" but noted that there's no search feature - something I expected to find - which is a massive disappointment; because of the size of the files, it can take an age of scrolling to find precisely what you're after, even where hypertext links have been included. [...] This is a clumsy way of finding information, and TSR could have made it a lot easier.\\" He also found that \\"Another omission, which is perhaps inevitable given the format that the text has been presented in, is that there are no pictures in the books at all. This is fine, more or less, as far as the DMG, PHB and Tome of Magic are concerned, but illustrations are extremely useful when it comes to describing monsters that appear in the MM, and the Arms and Equipment book states right at the beginning that everything in it is illustrated, when in fact this is quite clearly not the case [...] Because of the lack of illustration, it has to be said that the rulebooks as they are presented here on CD-ROM can be used as no more than an addition to the paper versions. If you've only got the CD-ROM, you're going to have a hard time running AD&D.;\\" Pettengale looked at \\"the other features that the disc offers for added worth\\" noting that the extra features are \\"primarily designed to make a DM's life easier\\" such as the character generator which he found to be \\"an extremely fast way of rolling up a PC - the whole process, including proficiency choices and the purchase of equipment, can take as little as ten minutes (when done using the basic books, the creation of a 1st level character can usually take as long as two hours, so that's a big time saver). All of the dice rolling options are presented, so there's plenty of flexibility built in, though there's no way that you can 'cheat' - most DMs will let a player reroll a dice or two throughout the character generation process, especially if a Hit Points roll turns out to be a 1. Nevertheless, this is a very handy feature and, providing you don't use the excellent Skills and Powers sub-rules [...] which aren't included as an option [...] it will probably be used time and again.\\" He also commented on the DM tool to quickly create NPCs: \\"I suggest you use this only for creating 'general' NPCs if you've got a major, long-standing villain to create, it's best to do it yourself\\" and the map builder tool which \\"sounds more interesting than it actually is - the maps you create with it look pretty poor\\". Pettengale concluded the review by saying \\"Overall, I'm not terribly impressed with the AD&D; CD-ROM Core Rules. It had a lot of potential, but that potential hasn't really been capitalised on. There could have been splendid illustrations of all the monsters included, but this is not the case; there should have been a search feature for locating rulings in a hurry, but this isn't the case either. Yes, some of the tools are jolly useful, but they aren't the kind of things you can do yourself with pen and paper and a bit of time. I can see myself using it, though only occasionally [...] So, buy it if you've got money to burn, but this is not an essential purchase for all PC-owning DMs by any means.\\" In a review of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons CD-ROM Core Rules for Pyramid #22 (November/December 1996), the reviewer described the product as \\"an amazing achievement - easy to use, thorough, complete and incredibly useful\\".Pyramid Pick References Category:Dungeons & Dragons ","title":"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons CD-ROM Core Rules"},{"id":"40015363","text":"Champions of the Mists is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, published in 1998.

The book opens with a brief introduction of the various classes of Champions of the Mists, covering the four core classes of warrior, wizard, cleric, and thief, but does not cover the new classes found in Domains of Dread nor the optional classes from the Player's Handbook.

The reviewer felt that the book omitting the new classes from Domanins of Dread and the optional classes from the Player's Handbook was not a great difficulty \\"if one uses the ideas here and applies them in a slightly different manner to the class in question.

According to official reports, around 49 people were killed (unofficial reports are significantly higher at 400) and several hundred were injured in what was perceived as a \\"revenge killing\\" by newly settled armed Afghan Refugees following an unsuccessful raid on an Afghan heroin processing and distribution center in Sohrab Goth by the security forces. Most of the residents of the two colonies happened to be Biharis who had been freshly repatriated from Bangladesh and Muhajirs. The locality is situated within limits of Karachi city and consists of poor and lower middle class Mohajir families living side by side by Pashtuns residing on the adjacent hills populated primarily by Afghan migrants who settled during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War and were involved in narcotics and gun trade. During planned development of the city in the 1960s and 70s it was constructed by the government as colony for journalists where amenity plots were handed out to the residents. Due to the distance from the city most allottees sold their plots moving themselves to central areas. The place was thereon heavily dominated by the muhajir community. Background From the time of Pakistan's independence in 1947 and up until 1961, the population of Karachi grew by 432 percent ‚Äì a growth rate that \\"no other city anywhere else in the world [had] ever experienced\\". People migrating from India, commonly known as Muhajir could not be accommodated into the city properly and a vast majority of them were settled in informal housing settlements known as \\"kachi bastis\\". Resettlement of the Muhajirs could not effectively catch up with the growth of Karachi's kachi bastis as further more in-migrants arrived into the city from Punjab, Balochistan and the North-West Frontier Province. By the late 1960s, these informal settlements had taken up two forms: unorganised settlements, where the squatters illegally occupied public or private owned land, and, illegal subdivisions, where peripheral land was developed and sold \\"by 'independent' private persons who lack[ed] the property rights\\" over it. These informal entrepreneurs came to be known as dallals (patrons) and enjoyed a close connections with the police officers, politicians and bureaucrats, connections that offered them \\"a certain degree of security against illegal eviction of [other] basti dwellers\\". =Afghan Refugees influx and the Kalashnikov culture= During the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War in the late 1970s and early 1980s, millions of Afghan refugees had made their way into Pakistan. An estimated population of about 6 million refugees were welcomed with open arms into Pakistan as part of General Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization programme. These refugees gradually settled in populated urban centres throughout the country, including southern cities of Hyderabad and Karachi. Many of the Afghan refugees that made their way into Karachi settled in bastis at the outskirts of the city, which included areas like Sohrab Goth. The magnitude of refugees migrating into Pakistan had a huge socio-economic impact on the country's society, promoting wide availability of illegal narcotic drugs like heroin, and automatic firearms like the AK-47 rifles. Where Pakistan had previously been drug-free and largely deweaponised, the country soon became flooded with automatic weapons along with the population of drug users shooting up to over a million in the early 1980s which came into sharp conflict with the general populace of Karachi. The sudden proliferation of firearms has since been dubbed as the \\"Kalashnikov culture\\". =Changing housing market= This influx of Afghan refugees gave rise to informal Pashtun entrepreneurs who joined in Karachi‚Äôs informal housing market. Many of the Afghan refugees landed jobs as policemen and started investing in real estate while several drug and arms barons also made their way into Karachi's ethnic and political stage as a result of this influx.. every one lived side by side until the influx of Afghan Refugees who started stirring ethnic fault lines. As the Punjabi and Muhajir influence grew weak in Karachi's informal housing market, the Pushtun entrepreneurs imposed greater control over the land. Afghan gunmen would seize land by force, Afghan real estate developers would develop on plots and rent out to tenants who could be evicted at will. Thus coercion and violence became a common modus vivendi of the afghans. Of the few areas in Karachi where the Pashtuns were met with fierce resistance, Orangi was the largest squatter settlement in Karachi with a population of around one million. Orangi was an ethnically diverse settlement where Muhajirs and Pashtuns each constituted 25% of the population and the remainder was a mixture of Punjabis, Sindhis, Baloch, Bengalis. =Karachi's growing ethnic strife= The urban centres of Karachi and Hyderabad had increasingly become ethnically diverse and riots along ethnic lines were commonplace. The brimming ethnic conflict evolved into territorial demarcation on ethnic grounds, with power being accumulated into the hands of local criminal elements, particularly in and around areas of Orangi. In April 1985, Karachi faced its first major ethnic riot that claimed the lives of at least hundred people. The riot mobilised Muhajir and Bihari basti dwellers against he afghan gunmen who had tried to extend their influence to those neighborhoods. The main battlefield was situated between Banaras Chowk and the Metro Cinema in Orangi, an area adjacent to newly settled afghan strongholds. Later on the morning of 15 April 1985, another afghan-Muhajir ethnic clash broke out when a afghan minivan driver struck and killed a schoolgirl, Bushra Zaidi. The afghan driver had been eager to outrun a competitor without respecting a traffic light, hitting a vehicle and then bumping into a group of students of Sir Syed Government Girls College in Liaquatabad. In the hours immediately following the incident, a mob of angry young students organised a protest demonstration which was brutally repressed by the police. Tensions between the Pashtun and Muhajir populations grew to a boiling point after the incident. The police were later accused of molesting young female students after it entered the Sir Syed College. The alleged police brutality later fuelled the anger of Muhajir and Punjabis and violence erupted throughout the city all the way from Liaquatabad in the east to Orangi to the west. Eager to provoke the police, the young students set buses and minivans on fire and were inevitably met with harsh responses. =Police crackdown in Sohrab Goth= As complaints came flooding in about the increase in crime rates throughout Karachi, particularly those fueled by ethnic conflicts, newspapers began highlighting the issue in their headlines and the government of Sindh found the need for a crackdown on the various criminal elements within the afghan refugees settlements in the city. On 12 December 1986, the Sindh governor Lt Gen Jahan Dad Khan ordered a police operation in the vicinity of Sohrab Goth in Karachi. Guised as an anti-encroachment operation, a team was assembled under DC Sardar Ahmed, DIG Karachi, IGP Sindh and Corps Commander Karachi Lt Gen Ahmad Shamim Khan to root out and arrest criminal elements. They were also asked to relocate the illegal encroachers from Al-Asif Square in Sohrab Goth to a new site near the National Highway. The police had wanted to raid an Afghan heroin processing and distribution centre in Sohrab Goth. However, when they approached the neighbourhood, they were met with violent retaliation. As part of the operation, the security forces surrounded the area with bulldozers destroying illegally encroached houses and removing the residents. Some reports also suggest that just before the operation, the police had entered adjacent Orangi townships that were predominantly Muhajir and seized caches of arms and bombs. The massacre at Qasba and Aligarh colonies A group of several armed afghans refugees with Kalashnikov rifles charged down the hill overlooking the Qasba and Aligarh colonies, and Sector 1-D of Orangi Town. The invaders are said to have set people's houses on fire using kerosene tanks \\"under [the] cover of a hail of gunfire\\". In less than two hours an estimated 400 people were murdered . Hundreds more were injured and many more escaped from the roof to save their lives. However, according to official figures, there were only 49 deaths. By , hundreds of homes were burnt to the ground. Formal judicial inquiry The former chief justice of the Supreme Court Sajjad Ali Shah conducted an inquiry into the incident and wrote in his findings or that \\"it [was] the worst kind of massacre [he] had ever witnessed, where women, children and men from Muhajir community were slaughtered by illegal immigrants [and] the Corps Commander Karachi should have questioned as to why the army was asked to retreat approximately two hours before the incident took place\\". He suggested the existence of \\"foul-play\\". The report was sent to Islamabad where he criticized the army, Sindh administration and the governor‚Äôs role in the event. The report of fact finding mission was ignored by the establishment. In an interview with Mazhar Abbas, former Sindh chief minister Syed Ghous Ali Shah said that the judicial commission led by the chief justice was able to shed some light on the issues giving rise to the Qasba‚ÄìAligarh massacre and disclosed revealing details of negligence in the security forces. However, he confessed that the report was not brought to light because the government at the time had feared it would create more chaos. =Survivors' accounts= As per one of the survivors, \\"they came inside out houses and asked for men\\", \\"they killed indiscriminately with knives and guns chanting Allah‚Äôo‚ÄôAkber as if we were infidels\\" said one of the survivors who lost her father and elder brother sobbing and she was correct. Mosques were used to mobilize people to kill and there were speeches and sermons given against the people living in Qasba Aligarh by the clerics stating that \\"killing them would take one to heaven\\". Mohammad Ibrahim another survivor who lost his elder brother told us that \\"they came in and started burning our houses, kicking the babies and killing anyone in front of them ‚Ä¶\\".

Contents Bastion of Faith is the third in a series of books that detail one of the four core character classes, after College of Wizardry for mages and Den of Thieves for rogues. This book gives the priest a home, patrons, friends and allies to aid his cause. The Bastion is the name for the Church of Heironeous. Bastion of Faith details the upper levels of power in the priesthood and gives a summary of the different members of the church, noting where some of these levels have places that player characters might fit in. Thieves who worship Heironeous are called inquisitors, fighters are templars, and mages are catechists, and the faithful gain spell-like abilities as they rise in level. In addition to the roster, there are fourteen full write ups that include history, personality, statistics, possessions, and illustrations. The book also introduces favors, which are a form of paper money. Publication history Bastion of Faith was published by Wizards of the Coast, and written by Bruce R. Cordell. Reception Bastion of Faith was reviewed by the online version of Pyramid on June 16, 2000.Pyramid Pick The reviewer says that regarding the actual Bastion described, this book \\"gives the DM enough details to choke a horse\\". The reviewer also comments on the summary of church members: \\"One of the nice things about the roster is that there are several 1st level characters with names that a GM can just scoop up and use as player characters.

Plot summary The Dungeon of Death is part of the \\"Dungeon Crawl\\" series, which provides stand- alone adventures reminiscent of the old style of dungeon adventure. While the adventures in this series are set in the Forgotten Realms, they are designed to be easy to place in other campaigns with a minimum of effort. The Dungeon of Death is loosely connected to the events in the Hellgate Keep scenario. The plot involves an abandoned dwarven mining complex, long since taken over by evil inhabitants attempting to lure adventurers into investigating the complex.

Reception The Dungeon of Death was reviewed by the online version of Pyramid on June 23, 2000.Pyramid Review The reviewer felt that the adventure \\"easily stands on its on\\" despite its loose connection to Hellgate Keep. The reviewer felt that the production value was \\"very good, like most of the recent Wizard releases. Where other companies of late seem to be using larger typefaces and bigger margins, Wizards has moved in the opposite direction, allowing them to put more information into smaller books while keeping the price down.

It is served by Regionalbahn passenger service RB 46). It is also used by freight traffic from Bochum freight yard at the former Bochum S√ºd station and Bochum-Pr√§sident to Gelsenkirchen-Schalke Nord. The line was built in sections between 1867 and 1876 of the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company. The curve connecting to Bochum Central Station was opened in 1979. Passengers Class 515 battery car in the early 90s near Bochum-Nokia Until 1978, the Deutsche Bundesbahn passenger service ran from Bochum-Langendreer via Bochum-Nord, Bochum-Riemke to Wanne-Eickel (see Bochum-Riemke‚ÄìWanne-Eickel line below). After the construction of a connecting curve from Bochum Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) to the line towards Riemke in 1979, passenger services ran until 1990 from Bochum over the curve from Herne-Rottbruch to Herne, but subsequently services ran via Wanne-Eickel to Gelsenkirchen Central Station. Herne Rottbruch station represented a special case for operations, because it is located on a bridge over autobahn 43, but it has not been served since 1990. In the early 90s, the electronics manufacturer Nokia, which then had a factory near the railway, sponsored the modernisation of the fleet (starting with three vehicles of class 515 battery electric multiple units and followed by class 628 diesel multiple units). As a result, the line was renamed the Nokia-Bahn (\\"Nokia Railway\\") and Bochum-Graetz station was renamed Bochum-Nokia. Following Nokia‚Äôs closure of its Bochum factory in late 2008, the line was renamed the Gl√ºckauf-Bahn. At the timetable change of 2009/10, the station was renamed Bochum-Riemke. Currently, Regionalbahn service RB 46 is operated by Abellio Rail NRW, using three Alstom Coradia LINT 41/H vehicles and on weekends and holidays with Stadler FLIRT EMUs with two sections. Class 515 battery car in the early 90s near Gelsenkirchen-Zoo The Wanne-Eickel‚ÄìGelsenkirchen- Zoo‚ÄìDorsten section is used in passenger operations by Regionalbahn service RB 43. Until 1988, trains were operated by class 515 battery cars from the northernmost track of Wanne-Eickel station via a connecting curve directly to Wanne-Unser Fritz (\\"Our Fred\\", serving the Unser Fritz colliery, which was named after Frederick III) station. Today, the connecting curve is dismantled and the station is closed. Since the closure of the curve, passenger trains depart from the southern platform in Wanne-Eickel over the longer, southern connecting curve without stopping at Gelsenkirchen Zoo. The 1968/69 timetable included a Wanne-Eickel‚ÄìGelsenkirchen-Zoo‚ÄìGelsenkirchen-Schalke‚ÄìBottrop- S√ºd‚ÄìOberhausen service. In 1940, there was a Wanne-Eickel‚ÄìGelsenkirchen- Bismarck‚ÄìSchalke Nord‚ÄìGelsenkirchen-Hessler‚ÄìEssen service. class 221 in the mid 1980s at Herne Rottbruch Hgn junction Freight Freight from Bochum- Langendreer runs over line 2153. This bypasses the stations of Wanne-Eickel and Herne, reaching Recklinghausen and Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck directly. Associated lines =Bochum-Riemke‚ÄìWanne-Eickel railway= The line from Bochum-Riemke to Wanne-Eickel via Wanne-R√∂hlinghausen was used by passenger and freight traffic from 1886 to 1960. The chainage starts at the former Bochum Pr√§sident station. Apart from passenger services between Bochum- Langendreer and Wanne-Eickel, it was used by freight traffic to the Hannover colliery (until 1973) and the Mannesmann steelworks in Wanne-Eickel (until its closure in 1980). The line went past the Hannover colliery to the east and the preserved Malakow tower of the mine is still recognisable. West of the mine and the neighbouring K√∂nigsgrube (‚Äúking‚Äôs pit‚Äù) colliery was in places less than 100 metres away from the Gelsenkirchen-Wattenscheid‚ÄìWanne-Eickel railway (line 2232, see below). The Bochum-Riemke‚ÄìWanne-Eickel railway passed under the southern pair of tracks of the Gelsenkirchen‚ÄìWanne-Eickel main line at today‚Äôs G√∂rresstra√üe in Wanne-Eickel (exactly at the point where the parallel Gelsenkirchen-Wattenscheid‚ÄìWanne-Eickel line (line 2232) connected at a high level with the southern pair of tracks), then ran through Bickern junction and connected at Plutostra√üe with the northern tracks from Gelsenkirchen to Wanne- Eickel. This allowed Wanne-Eickel station to be reached by this line from the west, unlike the still operational Bochum‚ÄìGelsenkirchen line, which reaches Wanne-Eickel from the east. = Gelsenkirchen‚ÄìGelsenkirchen- Wattenscheid‚ÄìWanne-Eickel railway = This 10-km long line ran from Gelsenkirchen Central Station via Gelsenkirchen-Wattenscheid station, which is on the southern outskirts of the city, and back north to Wanne-Eickel. It was operated exclusively for freight, except for a brief period in the 1880s. However, the route was temporarily used in 1949 for the Katholikentag (‚ÄúCatholic‚Äôs day‚Äù) pilgrimages to Bochum, because the Bochum-Riemke‚ÄìWanne- Eickel line (discussed above) was overloaded. Originally built as a colliery railway (Carolinengl√ºck Railway, see below), the section from Gelsenkirchen Hbf to Gelsenkirchen-Wattenscheid was dismantled in the 1960s, while the eastern branch to the Hanover and K√∂nigsgrube collieries was electrified in 1977 before its closure in 1990. = Carolinengl√ºck Railway = A colliery railway connected from Gelsenkirchen-Wattenscheid station to the east to the Carolinengl√ºck colliery nearby. Along with the neighbouring collieries of Hannover, Holland and Rheinelbe, the Carolinengl√ºck colliery had a rail connection to Gelsenkirchen CME (now Gelsenkirchen Central Station) in the 1850s. It was connected in 1867 to the Rhenish Railway Company‚Äôs new Osterath‚ÄìDortmund S√ºd railway. Parts of the line at the Carolinengl√ºck mine were used for the route of an iron ore railway built from the Rhine-Herne Canal to the Bochumer Verein steel works in the early 20th century.

He was the founder of United Overseas Bank (UOB), formerly known as United Chinese Bank, and the father of Wee Cho Yaw.  Early life  Wee was born to Kinmen Hokkiens (Minnanese) on 22 July 1890 in Kuching, Sarawak (now part of Malaysia), a British established puppet colony. He was the family's second-to- eldest son. His father was Wee Tee Yah (died 1889), and his mother was Song Kim Keow, a local born widow. The younger Wee attended Saint Thomas Secondary School, and spoke Hokkien and English fluently.  Career  In 1924, Wee established the Bian Chiang Bank (now known as CIMB Group) in Kuching, Malaysia. He became the Treasurer of the Kuching-based Chinese General Chamber of Commerce upon its inception in 1930, before being promoted to President. In addition, Wee was the Hokkien Association (Á¶èÂª∫‰ºöÈ¶Ü)'s President. In 1931, he was elected as Chairman of the Sarawak Chinese Chamber of Commerce. He resigned from the post in 1946. On 6 August 1935, he established the United Chinese Bank with six other partners. The bank is now known as the United Overseas Bank (UOB). Wee staffed his bank with ethnic Hokkiens to serve his Hokkien clients.  Personal life  The Kapitan Cina Ong Tiang Swee (), who was then Kuching's wealthiest person, was impressed by Wee, and decided to let him marry his eldest daughter, Ong Siew Eng (). Wee was then given the role of manager of the Sarawak Chinese Bank, which Ong owned. Wee soon got to know more prominent businesspeople and other important figures; he shortly started a string of businesses, including farming and goods importing and exporting. He was married twice and had fifteen children (five sons and ten daughters). Wee's second wife is the mother of Wee Cho Yaw, chairman of Singapore's United Overseas Bank.  Death and legacy  In 1978, Wee died in his Kuching residence. His fourth son, Wee Cho Yaw, was subsequently appointed to head United Overseas Bank. Jalan Datuk Wee Kheng Chiang, a road in downtown Kuching, is named after him.  Awards  Wee Kheng Chiang was posthumously hailed as the \\"uncrowned king of Sarawak\\" in Queen of the Head Hunters by Rajah Vyner Brooke's spouse, Sylvia Brooke.

He is best known for hosting the television series, Boundless, and is the founder of both Adventure Science and Stoked Oats. Donato has become an ultra-endurance athlete, having competed in numerous adventure races and ultra marathons. Career After completing an undergraduate degree in anthropology and biology, he obtained an MSc in paleontology at Western University. He received his PhD in geology from McMaster University 2008 during which time he founded and ran the Canadian Adventure Racing Association, which is still in existence today, and provides insurance, safety, and environmental guidelines to Canadian race directors. In 2008, he also founded Adventure Science, a company that combined his passion for field-based research with ultra-endurance athletics as a way of giving back, and making a difference. The first project was a search for then missing pilot, Steve Fossett. Since 2008, Adventure Science has conducted fifteen projects, ranging from studying the relationship between ultra-running and muscle damage, to searching for undiscovered archaeological ruins in the Middle East, to anti-poaching projects in Kenya. After graduation Donato began work as a geologist for Imperial Oil (ExxonMobil) in Calgary, AB, and spent over four years working on a wide variety of projects from the Athabasca oil sands to the Beaufort Sea. While still working for Imperial Oil, he co-founded Stoked Oats Ltd. with Brad Slessor and Shaun Stevens of Calgary (April 2011). They started the company to fill the need for a healthy, gluten-free oatmeal option in grocery stores that was sugar, salt, and preservative free, but still delivered a high amount of nutrients and protein per serving. Stoked Oats hit the market in June 2012. In July 2012, with Josh and Jordan Eady of Eady Bros Productions, and HLP + Partners, Donato launched a new television series called Boundless. The idea for the series grew from his documentary ‚ÄúGo Death Racer‚Äù. During the shooting for Boundless, he, and long-time friend Paul Trebilcock, traveled the globe for 126 days competing in 8 grueling ultra-endurance races, ranging from stand-up paddle boarding, to running across the Sahara desert. The show had 3 seasons and has a \\"cult\\" fan base. In 2017, his book The Boundless Life, was released. Harper Collins published the novel. Simon is a sponsored endurance athlete.

Sumner married a Tahitian princess. Aided by royal family connections, he became a major landowner and politician in Hawaii. After contracting leprosy in 1877, by law Sumner was exiled to Kalaupapa, Moloka ªi. He served there as luna (superintendent) of the leper colony from 1878 to 1884. He died of leprosy in a Honolulu hospital in 1884.  Early life and family  William Keolaloa KahƒÅnui Sumner, Jr. was born circa 1816, the eldest son of Captain William Sumner (1786‚Äì1847) and High Chiefess Keakuaaihue Kanealai Hua. Captain Sumner, from Northampton, was an early settler of Hawaii who arrived in 1807 as a cabin boy. Befriended by Kauai's king Kaumualii, Sumner later became a naval captain under King Kamehameha I, who united the Hawaiian Islands in 1810. Related to the Kamehamehas through Uminuikukaailani, his mother family descended from the famous twins KahƒÅnui and Kaha‚Äòopulani, the Kohala chiefs who reared Kamehameha during his infancy. His mother was also a cousin and hƒÅnai (adoptive) sister of High Chiefess Ahia Beckley, wife of Captain George Charles Beckley, who was one of the reputed designers of the Flag of Hawaii. William had younger siblings: John Kapilikea Sumner (1820‚Äì1915) and Maria Sumner (1824‚Äì1908). Maria married Henry Sea and later Robert Grimes Davis. Both Sumner brothers married Tahitian princesses. William married Manaiula Tehuiarii. John married her cousin Princess Ninito, who had been formally betrothed to Prince Moses Kek≈´ƒÅiwa. With Manaiula Tehuiarii, he had his eldest daughter Nancy Wahinekapu Sumner (1839‚Äì1895). After Manailua's death, William married Mauli Tehuiarii; their daughter was Elizabeth Keawepo ªo ªole Sumner (1850‚Äì1911). Both Nancy and Elizabeth Sumner served as ladies-in-waiting at the Hawaiian royal court. Through both daughters, Sumner has living descendants.  Career  Sumner and his brother John bought the land of M≈çkapu from High Chief Abner PƒÅkƒ´ in 1856. This land passed to his brother after William's death, and then to their sister Maria and her children from her second marriage with Robert Grimes Davis. The former Sumner landholdings in M≈çkapu, along with other parcels held by other Hawaiian landholders in the region, were later acquired by the United States government and developed as the Marine Corps Base Hawaii. Sumner was elected to the House of Representative for Oahu with a seat for the regular session of the Legislature of 1855 but, according to American Commissioner to Hawaii David Lawrence Gregg, he did not appear to serve for an unknown reason. The legislative roster for 1855 listed his name as \\"William Sumner Keolaloa.\\" The records of the House of Representatives however indicate that a \\"W. S. Keolaloa\\" participated in the legislative sessions. Either way, Sumner was defeated for reelection in the summer of 1855. On January 16, 1864, he was commissioned first lieutenant of the 1st Company of the Yeomanry, a volunteer army regiment in the military of Hawaii.  Superintendent of Kalaupapa  After Sumner contracted leprosy (also known as Hansen's disease), he was admitted to the leper colony of Kalaupapa on March 24, 1877. The legislature of the kingdom in 1865 had enacted a law for the prevention of leprosy, which required those with severe cases to be quarantined at the colony on Moloka ªi. Later that same year, the first luna (superintendent) William P. Ragsdale died; he was a highly popular part-Hawaiian attorney who had also served the government as an interpreter. After Ragsdale died, the Board of Health temporarily appointed the Catholic priest Father Damien as his replacement, but Damien proved unpopular with the native Hawaiian residents. He demonstrated religious discrimination, harshly treating a Hawaiian Protestant minister J. K. Kahuila, whom he judged as too independent. The native population petitioned for Damien's removal, and for Sumner, who was much more well-liked and amicable, to take over. Father Damien resigned shortly afterward and Sumner was appointed the luna by the government in Honolulu. Tombstone of William Keolaloa KahƒÅnui Sumner, Jr. at the Honolulu Catholic Cemetery. From 1878 to 1884, Sumner served as luna of the Kalaupapa, representing the Board of Health. He was tasked with \\"keeping order\\" in the settlement, with the American Clayton Strawn serving as his assistant. Sumner was bilingual in Hawaiian and English, and was also well liked and respected by the residents. However, he was considered too old and ill to maintain the position of leadership for long. In 1879, Nathaniel Bright Emerson became the resident physician and took over many of Sumner's responsibilities. Sumner was allowed to retain the title of luna to avoid opposition from a majority of the residents if he was removed. In 1884, Sumner was sent for treatment to Kaka ªako Branch Hospital in Honolulu. He was replaced by Ambrose Kanoeali‚Äòi Hutchison, another part-Hawaiian man, as resident superintendent. Sumner died in Honolulu on May 25, 1885. He was buried at the King Street Catholic Cemetery , also known as the Honolulu Catholic Cemetery, beside other members of the Sumner family.

The show, broadcast live daily from Times Square Studios in New York City,\\"Keith Olbermann Finalizes Deal With ESPN,\\" from Hollywood Reporter, 7/16/2013 premiered on August 26, 2013, and featured Olbermann offering commentary and analysis on issues in the sports world. Olbermann was originally a sixty-minute nightly program, usually starting at 11:00 PM Eastern. For a brief period of time, specifically during the ESPN networks‚Äô coverage of the Australian Open, the show temporarily aired at 6:00 PM in a thirty-minute format. During this period a repeat of the program aired on ESPNEWS at 2:00 AM. In September 2014, Olbermann was moved from its nightly spot to a late afternoon time slot and began airing at 5:00 PM Eastern in a thirty-minute format. ESPNEWS added two additional repeat airings; the first aired at 6:30 p.m., the second one in the usual 2:00 a.m. slot, and the last at 5:00 a.m. On July 10, 2015, two days after ESPN declined to renew his expiring contract, Olbermann announced on air that the series would be coming to an end on July 24.\\"ESPN, Keith Olbermann Part Ways,\\" from Variety, 7/08/2015 The announcement came after The Hollywood Reporter claimed that ESPN wanted Olbermann to tone down his critical commentary,\\"Keith OESPN Wants Keith Olbermann to Quit Doing \\"Commentary\\",\\" from Hollywood Reporter, 7/01/2015 but the network claimed the move was to cut costs related to Olbermann's salary and the use of the space at Times Square Studios, claims later confirmed by an aborted move of Mike & Mike to the same facility and releases of other network talent at the end of their contracts throughout 2015 and into 2016. Background Olbermann marked the second tour of duty for Keith Olbermann with the ESPN organization, having served as a popular co-anchor (alongside Dan Patrick) of the main network's SportsCenter between 1992 and 1997; it's also Olbermann's second stint at ESPN's secondary network, ESPN2, where he briefly served as original anchor of the network's SportsNight in 1993-1994. In the decade before Olbermann's debut, Olbermann gained notice as an anchor/commentator on hard news and political discussion, serving as host of Countdown with Keith Olbermann, which aired on MSNBC and, briefly, Current TV. Since Olbermann's return to the ESPN family was formally announced in July 2013, much mention had been made in media coverage of the anchor's abrasive off-screen demeanor and his acrimonious partings with several of his previous employers, including his 1997 departure from ESPN. Both Olbermann and ESPN executives had reported \\"no friction\\" between them in the run-up to Olbermann's debut (ESPN VP/Programming Jamie Horowitz has noted Olbermann's openness to ideas and suggestions for the program);\\"Olbermann Set to Return to ESPN and Sports News,\\" from The New York Times, 8/25/2013 the anchor himself has owned up to his tempestuous past and his efforts to rebuild bridges with his old colleagues.\\"Keith Olbermann Defaces A-Rod; Reveals Apologies, Drama Behind ESPN Return,\\" from Hollywood Reporter, 8/23/2013 Olbermann had also indicated he is happy returning to covering sports on a regular basis, telling The New York Times, \\"If you cover politics for eight years without interruption like I did, you need a change.\\" Format The format rundown below was the format in use when the show was reduced to thirty minutes. *Opening monologue: Olbermann opens the show speaking for approximately six minutes about a sports issue of the day. Some of these commentaries are along the lines of the \\"Special Comment\\" segments on Countdown where he criticizes a figure and demands action. Others are more lighthearted in nature such as his \\"Mr. Cranky\\" predictions. Another occasional feature on his monologues were musings on sports history, lore and his take on it. *World's Worst: another Countdown feature adjusted for the sports audience, on people or organizations that have performed something egregious that sets them up for Olbermann's ridicule, and like Countdown, retains Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor as background music. This segment is \\"more gentle and sarcastic\\" than its counterpart's sharp political tinge on Countdown; Olbermann pokes fun at \\"the miscreants, losers and riffraff, the unwashed and the unloved,\\" suggesting that viewers \\"don't take it completely seriously, I don't mean it completely literally, we just call them 'The Worst Persons In the Sports World'.\\" Occasionally though the 'completely' is dispensed with if the target's behavior was particularly egregious, along with the theme music for extended commentary. Three targets per night are featured, ranked \\"worse,\\" \\"worser,\\" and \\"worst\\" just as they were on Countdown. Also, as on Countdown, Olbermann tosses his notes at the camera following its conclusion (although he did this more on the Current TV series) and pretends to play the organ chord that closes the musical piece. Although the Worst segment is usually lighthearted in nature, Olbermann will occasionally use the segment to profile someone who did something so bad there is no other place to discuss them and will usually dispense with his end of segment theatrics by either throwing to break or by spinning his chair around so his back is facing the camera. Other times, for instance when Olbermann complimented model Chrissy Teigen on her Dodgers first pitch done while under the influence of alcohol, or ribbed his friend, Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona, for a story about his over- consumption of ice pops, the \\"worst\\" ranking is done fully light-heartedly and disclaimed as the only place in the show's format where the story could fit in. *X Joins KO: Olbermann conducts an interview with a featured guest, whether it be from the world of sports or entertainment. ESPN contributors Jason Whitlock, Buster Olney, and John Clayton were frequent guests as are ESPNW contributor Sarah Spain, who like Olbermann is a Cornell University graduate (which Olbermann routinely discusses during the show); Grantland and Baseball Tonight contributor Jonah Keri, MLB.com and former Houston Chronicle columnist Richard Justice, and comedian and writer Bill Scheft, who was Olbermann's designated emergency guest. *The Bruno Bash: Every Friday, Olbermann and his former ESPN Radio colleague Tony Bruno would have a discussion focusing on various sports issues of the day, usually in a humorous fashion. The segment was temporarily on hiatus while Bruno focused on his return to daily sports radio hosting on WIP-FM in Philadelphia; he returned on April 2, 2015 with the segment done on Bruno's end most weeks via satellite from ABC O&O; WPVI-TV in Philadelphia. *Late Headlines/Keith Lights: The closing segment of every show. The segment leads off with Olbermann relaying some tidbits of sports news from earlier in the day, although some news breaks while the program is airing. These are followed by Olbermann commenting on sports highlights, usually from the previous day's action since the show's 5:00 PM airtime usually does not allow for current day highlights. As he recaps them Olbermann will rely on catchphrases he used during his SportsCenter days, such as saying a high-pitched \\"Hello!\\" for a collision between two players and \\"bye, Felicia\\" for plays that result in someone being dismissed or left behind (such as a strikeout or a fast break). Olbermann also lightheartedly mocks other sports announcers. For instance, for basketball highlights he will do an imitation of Johnny Most when a player makes a three- point shot. using accentuated, For baseball highlights, particularly those where home runs are featured, Olbermann puts a spin on the home run call of John Sterling where he follows the call with a series of three-syllable names, usually starting with Boba Fett. For golf highlights, Olbermann portrays course reporter \\"Bob Slurm\\" and speaks in a hushed tone like a stereotypical golf broadcaster would. A further running gag with the golf highlights involves Olbermann getting \\"caught\\" portraying Bob Slurm; since he uses the hushed tone, he has to hold his lapel mic close to his face so he can be heard and often the camera cuts away from the highlights while Olbermann is still in character. The voice is also used with Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show highlights in mid-February, and Olbermann interviews the trainer of the Best in Show dog the day after the show, as he did during the run of Countdown. Sometimes, if there are not any games to recap, the segment instead focuses on past highlights with the title \\"Keith Lights Throughout History\\". Politics are not entirely off limits on Olbermann; rebuffing a report from The New York Times claiming that he was contractually forbidden from speaking about politics on the show, Olbermann said, \\"There‚Äôs nothing preventing me from doing it other than common sense,\\" although he hinted that some aspects of politics would be covered if it crosses paths with the sports world. The original sixty-minute format included all of the above segments, with the exception that there were two rounds of Keith Lights segments; the first recapped sports action to that point in the program and included the top sports news of the day while the second added any additional action that had been completed in the intervening time. In October 2013 Olbermann adopted a more rigid format. The opening monologue and format rundown switched places, with Olbermann starting the show with the list of topics and introducing the program with \\"Olbermann is next, by the way, I'm Olbermann.\\" In April 2014, the show again flipped the order of the monologue and the rundown so that the monologue returns to its cold open style and the rundown leads into the first commercial. For the show's finale, Olbermann, instead of opening with a monologue, explained \\"his crack staff did everything for me today so I don't have to work\\", which immediately led into first guest Kareem-Abdul Jabbar. Olbermann would close the show in the following manner. Olbermann's signoff pays tribute to two people who influenced his life. After Chet Curtis, with whom Olbermann had worked at WCVB-TV in Boston when he was briefly the station's sportscaster in 1984, died in January 2014 Olbermann began adding the news close to his signoff and employed names of people featured earlier in the show (although he uses \\"news\\" and \\"Eyewitness News\\" interchangeably; oddly enough, Olbermann's time as a local sportscaster in Boston and Los Angeles did not see him work for any station using the Eyewitness News branding as WCVB brands its newscasts as NewsCenter, while KTLA had the NewsWatch branding and KCBS was using the Action News format while Olbermann was there). Olbermann's signoff line is taken from Arthur Naething, an English teacher of Olbermann's at the Hackley School who used to say this to all of his students and who died in October 2014. Previously Olbermann signed off by using Edward R. Murrow's trademark \\"good night and good luck\\" signoff, which he had begun to use while at MSNBC, and had recently begun incorporating the phrase \\"hap'nin\\" in honor of his schoolmate Chris Berman. After signing off, Olbermann crumples what is left of his notes and tosses them at the camera, with the lens \\"shattering\\" for effect. In his final show on 24 July, Olbermann, after a long montage of hilarity and quirks, thanked all of his directors, artists, and colleagues. He then signed off by saying \\"Bye, Felicia\\" one last time and threw his signed Abdul-Jabbar basketball toward the camera to close the series. When Olbermann first made the move to 5:00 PM, it coincided with a move of Outside the Lines to follow it on the schedule and at the end of the show, Olbermann would toss to Bob Ley (or whoever happened to be hosting the show that day) in Bristol and briefly discuss the upcoming half-hour. The tosses were cut out of each subsequent reairing and dropped altogether when OTL moved back to ESPN =Former segments= *\\"This Week in Keith History\\" - an interlude that finds Olbermann providing amusing reactions to clips from his earlier ESPN stint that he has not seen in advance (\\"I haven't seen it, I don't know what it is, I didn't get a hint, and yes I did pay for that haircut\\"). This segment was only featured for the first two weeks of the show and has since been dropped. *\\"Time Marches On\\" - originated as \\"Oddball\\" on Countdown and renamed to its current name when the show moved to Current, this segment saw Olbermann commenting on the \\"wild and wacky\\" stories in the world of sports with accompanying video clips. These segments were dropped when Olbermann was reduced to thirty minutes. =Guest hosts= Guest hosts have occasionally shown up on Olbermann for various reasons. These were initially done out of necessity due to Olbermann's previously announced commitment to anchor Turner Sports' coverage of the Major League Baseball postseason in October 2013.\\"Keith Olbermann Returning To TV On Turner,\\" from The Hollywood Reporter, 6/5/2013 Larry King was the first substitute host,\\"Larry King to Guest-Host 'Olbermann,'\\" from The Hollywood Reporter, 9/26/2013 with Colin Cowherd and Jeremy Schaap following him. The format for these shows was largely scrapped, and Cowherd had his own segment at the end of the show where he ranked whether or not a sports figure was having a good day. In early 2014, Olbermann suffered a bout of shingles and required some intermittent substitutes. The two most frequent were Adnan Virk and Pablo S. Torre, and in the former case (since Virk is a SportsCenter anchor) the \\"Keith Lights\\" segments returned. When Torre substituted the shows were more interview driven. In both cases, the program would often be reduced in length to thirty minutes. Other guest hosts have included Robert Flores, Bram Weinstein, Max Bretos, Jay Harris, Matt Barrie, Ryen Russillo, and Steve Weissman. Suspension Olbermann was suspended on February 24, 2015 for a week after he made disparaging comments on Twitter regarding Penn State and Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, which raises money for pediatric cancer.\\"ESPN Statement on Keith Olbermann's Penn State Tweets\\" from \\"ESPN\\", 2/24/2015 Adnan Virk and Pablo S. Torre hosted the show in his absence. Olbermann gave an apology for his Twitter comments on his first day back from suspension. International broadcasts * Canada: Was initially carried on TSN2, normally at midnight ET, i.e. on a tape delay of about one hour. Receiving little promotion, the program was removed from the schedule at the start of October 2013. With the September 2014 move to an afternoon timeslot (combined with the launch of additional TSN channels), the program now airs simultaneously with U.S. broadcast most weekdays on one of the TSN channels, currently normally TSN2. * Australia: Airs on ESPN Australia delayed to 11:00 PM EST.

Insomniac is also involved in the operation of three Los Angeles nightclubs‚ÄîCreate (in partnership with SBE, built on the site of the former Vanguard Hollywood), Exchange L.A. and the underground warehouse Factory 93, located at 1756 Naud Street. In 2013, Insomniac entered into a creative partnership with Live Nation, and in 2014, introduced a co-branded record label in partnership with Interscope Geffen A&M;, Overview and partnerships By contrast to other promoters, Insomniac places a larger emphasis on fan experiences during its events, as opposed to focusing on profits and ticket sales, and that \\"our strength lies in the movement as a whole. It‚Äôs a culture. It‚Äôs powerful. It‚Äôs always been about the people that attend.

While specifics of the deal were not revealed, Rotella emphasized that the deal was not an acquisition, as had been speculated. Since 1993Insomniac: How It All Began, Insomniac has produced over 2,000 festivals attended by over 5 Million people. In August 2015, Pasquale announced his new radio show, Night Owl Radio, on SiriusXM's Electric Area (Electric Area was later replaced by Diplo's Revolution in 2018). In the summer of 2018, Insomniac Radio launched on SiriusXM's channel 730. In May 2019, Insomniac partnered with Dash Radio as its flagship station. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic (which resulted in the postponement of its Beyond Wonderland festival), Insomniac began to stream a rotation of sets from previous editions of the EDC, HARD Summer, and Okeechobee festivals on its YouTube and Twitch channels under the \\"Insomniac Rewind\\" banner, and also began to host \\"Virtual Rave-a-Thon\\" events featuring new sets. The first was co-branded with and held on the original nights of Beyond Wonderland on March 20 and 21, streamed from stages at the Academy LA nightclub. The following weekend, an Insomniac Countdown edition of the event was held, followed by the \\"Hard Summer Staycation\\". Insomniac Records In May 2014, Insomniac announced the formation of Insomniac Records, an EDM record label created in partnership with Interscope Geffen A&M.; The label aimed to attract both \\"undiscovered\\" and \\"established\\" producers.

His father, who died in 1907, was a rice merchant. The family relocated to Singapore when Khoo was only eight years old. Khoo took over his father's company in 1896 and with the profits, donated generously to the public. However, his ineptitude in business caused the company to fall into bankruptcy.

Such errors result from the learner's lack of knowledge of the correct rules of the target lect. A significant distinction is generally made between errors (systematic deviations) and mistakes (speech performance errors) which are not treated the same from a linguistic viewpoint. The study of learners' errors has been the main area of investigation by linguists in the history of second-language acquisition research.Ellis, p.43 In prescriptivist contexts, the terms \\"error\\" and \\"mistake\\" are also used to describe usages that are considered non- standard or otherwise discouraged normatively. Such usages, however, would not be considered true errors by the majority of linguistic scholars. Modern linguistics generally does not make such judgments about regularly occurring native speech, rejecting the idea of linguistic correctness as scientifically untenable, or at least approaching the concept of correct usage in relative terms. Social perceptions and value claims about different speech varieties, although common socially, are not normally supported by linguistics.  Definition  H. Douglas Brown defines linguistic errors as \\"a noticeable deviation from the adult grammar of a native speaker, reflecting the interlanguage competence of the learner.\\" He cites an example Does John can sing? where a preceding do auxiliary verb has been used as an error. Difference between error and mistake In linguistics, it is considered important to distinguish errors from mistakes. A distinction is always made between errors and mistakes where the former is defined as resulting from a learner's lack of proper grammatical knowledge, whilst the latter as a failure to utilize a known system correctly. Brown terms these mistakes as performance errors. Mistakes of this kind are frequently made by both native speakers and second language learners. However, native speakers are generally able to correct themselves quickly. Such mistakes include slips of the tongue and random ungrammatical formations. On the other hand, errors are systematic in that they occur repeatedly and are not recognizable by the learner. They are a part of the learner's interlanguage, and the learner does not generally consider them as errors. They are errors only from the perspective of teachers and others who are aware that the learner has deviated from a grammatical norm. That is, mistakes (performance errors) can be self-corrected with or without being pointed out to the speaker but systematic errors cannot be self- corrected.  Importance of error  S. Pit Corder was probably the first to point out and discuss the importance of errors learners make in course of their learning a second language. Soon after, the study and analysis of learners‚Äô errors took a prominent place in applied linguistics. Brown suggests that the process of second language learning is not very different from learning a first language, and the feedback a L2 learner gets upon making errors benefits him in developing the L2 knowledge.

It was described from subfossil bones in 1892 by Scottish explorer, ornithologist and botanist Henry Forbes, who was director of the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch at the time. Taxonomy The Chatham coot and the related New Zealand coot (F. prisca) are classified as coots on the basis of anatomical features of the pelvis and humerus typical of the genus. There has been disagreement regarding the relationship between the two species. They have variously been considered full species, subspecies or lacking in taxonomic distinction. At one point a new genus, Nesophalaris, was proposed for them. A review by Trevor Worthy and Richard Holdaway in 2002 recommended that the two coots be treated as separate species. Description Remains of the coot were first found by Forbes in dune deposits on Chatham Island in 1892, since when much further material has been recovered from dunes and from Moriori middens on the island. It was a large coot, slightly larger than the New Zealand coot, some 40 cm in length and 1.9 kg in weight. Apart from a disproportionately long neck, and long legs and toes, it was similar in shape to other coots and was probably able to fly. Its large salt glands indicate that it inhabited the brackish waters of Te Whanga Lagoon. The common occurrence of its bones in middens show that it was a frequent food item, with over-hunting the main cause of its extinction.

He is the father of Morgan Boyle. Playing career =Canberra= Boyle was graded by the Raiders during the 1990 season. He made his first grade debut from the bench in his sides' 20‚Äì18 win over the Gold Coast Seagulls at Bruce Stadium in round 4 of the 1991 season. Boyle also scored his first try in his debut match. He was one of the Raiders' shining prospects when the club was forced to release several star players due to salary cap problems at the end of the 1991 season. Most of the Raiders players (including Boyle himself) agreed to take a pay cut to keep the side together. The Raiders missed the finals for the first time since 1986 when they finished 12th in the 1992 season.Middleton, David ; Rugby League 1992/1993; p. 49. The Raiders came back strongly in 1993, with their international stars Mal Meninga, Ricky Stuart, Laurie Daley, Bradley Clyde and Steve Walters, as well as try scoring Fijian Noa Nadruku (22 tries for the season) leading the way. Canberra finished third after the regular season, and were premiership favorites until their fateful round 21 match with the hapless Parramatta Eels at Bruce Stadium. Halfback Ricky Stuart badly broke and dislocated his right ankle in the second half and despite a club record 68‚Äì0 win, without their halfback and chief play maker, the Raiders fell apart. They lost their last regular season game to the Canterbury Bulldogs 32‚Äì8, before meekly going out in straight sets in the finals with losses to eventual Grand Finalists St. George Dragons and premiers the Brisbane Broncos. In the 1994 season, the Raiders once again finished third in the regular season, and went on to win their third premiership title. In the 1994 Grand Final against the Canterbury Bulldogs in which the Raiders won 36‚Äì12, Boyle, along with Jason Death were both listed on the four-man interchange bench, but were not used in the game.Middleton, David ; Rugby League 1995; p. 246. In the 1995 season, the Raiders finished second after losing only two matches in the regular season, and once again looked like title contenders. They lost in the preliminary final to the Canterbury Bulldogs 25‚Äì6. In the 1998 season, his final season at the Raiders, Boyle had his best season, after playing in 22 of their 26 games, he finished the season with 11 tries second only to Mark McLinden. Boyle left the Raiders at the conclusion of the 1998 season. =Bradford Bulls= In 1999, Boyle joined English Super League side the Bradford Bulls.

On corn silk Description and life cycle This beetle is 5 to 6 millimeters long. It has a red head and black thorax. The elytra are yellow, marked with three transverse bands in shades of green or blue-green and a narrower longitudinal green line down the center. The pattern of banding is variable and nearly absent in some individuals. The color of the elytra is influenced by the types of plants the beetle eats.Teng, H., et al. (1984). Performance and host preference of adult banded cucumber beetles, Diabrotica balteata, when offered several crops. J Agric Entomol 1(4) 330-38. The larva is also variable and has three instars. The new larva is white and about 2.3 millimeters long. It may turn yellow as it consumes plant material. The later-instar larva may reach nearly 9 millimeters. The adult mates at about six days of age. The female begins producing eggs about 16 days later. She lays a cluster of eggs every few days for two to eight weeks, producing up to 15 clusters, for a maximum of 850 eggs. A cluster has up to 100 oval yellow eggs each about half a millimeter long. The female oviposits the cluster in a crack in the soil, and the eggs hatch in 5 to 9 days. The larva develops for 11 to 17 days, pupation takes 4 to 6 days, and the adult has an average life span of 26 days. There is no diapause. In the best conditions there can be six or seven generations per year. In Tamaulipas, Mexico, the beetle is most commonly observed in May through July. This may be a time of high dispersal. Abundance is apparently increased by late spring and summer rainfall, and flight activity increases with wind speed.Rodr√≠guez-del-Bosque, L. A. and A. Magallanes-Estala. (1994). Seasonal abundance of Diabrotica balteata and other diabroticina beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in northeastern Mexico. Environmental Entomology 23(6) 1409-15. Distribution The beetle likely originated in the tropical Americas and has moved into more temperate climates. By the early 1900s it was limited to Arizona and Texas in the United States. During the 1920s it spread up the coast of California at a rate of about 25 miles per year.Davis, A. C. (1931). Diabrotica balteata Lec. Journal of Economic Entomology 24(2). It has since spread as far as North Carolina and Florida. It probably will not progress farther in the continental United States because it does not tolerate freezing temperatures. Host plants The larva eats the roots and tubers of plants. The adult feeds on most plant parts, such as leaves, seedling cotyledons, fruits, and flower parts, including corn silk.Banded Cucumber Beetle (Diabrotica balteata) . Technical Fact Sheet. Plantwise Knowledge Bank. A polyphagous species, this beetle has a variety of host plants from several different families. Among its primary hosts are cucurbits such as cucumber, cantaloupe, squash, gourd, and pumpkin, beans such as common bean and lima bean, sweet potato, soybean, and winged bean. Secondary hosts include tomato, potato, cassava, rice, sorghum, wheat, maize, and crucifers such as cabbages. Other known wild and cultivated host plants include amaranth, peanut, crownbeard, watermelon, silverleaf nightshade,Schalk, J. M. (1986). Rearing and handling of Diabrotica balteata. Chapter 3 In: Methods for the study of pest Diabrotica. (pp. 49-56). Springer New York. bell pepper, mulberry, pea, beet, okra, onion, and lettuce. Impacts The beetle causes the most serious damage to plants when the adult defoliates them and the larva attacks the roots, especially in seedlings. The larva is very damaging to the root tuber of the sweet potato. It riddles the tuber with holes which expand as the root grows, turning into craters.Jett, L. J., et al. (1998). Banded cucumber beetle (Diabrotica balteata LeC.) injury during sweetpotato development. HortScience 33(3) 475. Such root damage reduces plant growth and fruit production, and it makes the crop less marketable. Another consequence of beetle damage to plants is viral and bacterial infection. Even if the actual damage is minor, the injury can facilitate the entry of pathogens that can be lethal to the plant. This beetle is a vector for the pathogens that cause many forms of plant disease, including cowpea mosaic virus, cowpea severe mosaic virus, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, bean rugose mosaic virus, bean mild mosaic virus, quail pea mosaic virus, squash mosaic virus, muskmelon necrotic spot virus, and bacterial wilt. Insecticides are used to control this species, mainly to target the larvae in the roots. The mermithid nematode Filipjevimermis leipsandra has been studied as a possible agent of biological pest control.Elsey, K. D. (1989). Effect of temperature on development and survival of the mermithid Filipjevimermis leipsandra. Journal of Nematology 21(3) 416-18. Another entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae, will also attack this species.Kuhlmann, U. and A. C. M. Van der Burgt. (1998). Possibilities for biological control of the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, in Central Europe. Biocontrol News and Information 19(2) 59N-68N. Some plants are more resistant to the beetle than others. It was noted that in romaine lettuce crops, the cultivar 'Valmaine' is resistant to attack, while 'Tall Guzmaine' is not.Huang, J., et al. (2002). Resistance to adult banded cucumber beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in romaine lettuce. Journal of Economic Entomology 95(4) 849-55. Later studies suggest that the latex produced by 'Valmaine' is repellent to the beetle.Huang, J., et al. (2003). Resistance in lettuce to Diabrotica balteata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae): the roles of latex and inducible defense. Environmental Entomology 32(1) 9-16. Ecology Natural enemies of the beetle include ants, which prey on its eggs, particularly in the tropics. A Heterorhabditis nematode isolated from the larva of this beetle has been demonstrated to be a parasite that causes rapid mortality.Creighton, C. S. and F. Fassuliotis. (1985). Heterorhabditis sp. (Nematoda: Heterorhabditidae): a nematode isolated from the banded cucumber beetle Diabrotica balteata. Journal of Nematology 17 150-53. It is also a host to the tachinid fly parasitoid Celatoria compressa.Cabrera Walsh, G. (2004). Distribution, host specificity, and overwintering of Celatoria bosqi Blanchard (Diptera: Tachinidae), a South American parasitoid of Diabrotica spp.(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae).

Names Other common names for the insect include belted cucumber beetle in English, tortuguilla de franjas verdes del pepino, mayatito con bandas verdes, catarinita doradilla, and gusano alfilerillo in Spanish, and chrysom√©lide ray√©e du conconbre in French.Diabrotica balteata.

Shortly prior to the 2011 event, Insomniac founder Pasquale Rotella announced that they would no longer co-produce Together as One, due to \\"various issues\\" surrounding Go Ventures' commitments to \\"safety, production quality and the overall value of our fans' experience.\\" Rotella also felt that there were conflicts between his creative visions and those of Go Ventures' Reza Gerami. At the same time, Rotella announced that Insomniac would partner with the club promoter Giant to form a new, competing New Year's Eve event known as White Wonderland, a two-night festival which would be held at the Anaheim Convention Center on December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2012. Similarly to Montreal's Bal en Blanc festival and the Sensation White tour, the winter-themed event would require all of its attendees to wear white-colored clothing. Despite the break-up, Together as One would still be held for 2011‚Äì12, organized solely by Go Ventures. However, the following year's edition would ultimately be cancelled.

After being rushed to the hospital, she lies in bed weak and tired. She visits Kyung- chae's deceased mother at the crematorium house and begs for forgiveness. Not long after that, Kyung-chae and Soo-hyuk visit Mrs Yeo together because she had told Soo-hyuk to put on her engagement ring on in front of her mother. That night, Hee-soo calls Kyung-chae to meet her at the hospital. After talking, Hee-soo passes away because of the disease and her mother ends up in prison.

During the first year nine affiliates, known as Emblem Clubs, were formed in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.History of Emblem The original articles of incorporation stated that the Emblem Clubs' goals were to \\"unite under one head, all existing and future Clubs commonly known as Elks' Ladies clubs, Committees or groups...promote sociability among members of Elks', share community welfare work...assist with social affairs...[and] promote better understanding and further the ideals and purposes for which each organization was established.\\" Religious and political subjects were banned from discussion at Club meetings.Schmidt p.109  Organization  Local units are called Emblem Clubs and state groups, like in the BPOE, are called \\"State Associations\\". In 1979 there were 500 local Clubs and 11 State Associations. The national structure is called the \\"Supreme Emblem Club\\". In 1979 the group did not appear to have a headquarters per se, but was run by a Supreme Executive Secretary in Rutherford, New Jersey.Schmidt p.110 Today there are 16 State Associations (though three have jurisdiction over more than one state the California Hawaii Nevada State Association, the Ohio/West Virginia State Association and the Wisconsin-Illinois-Indiana-Michigan State Association).State Association‚Äôs of The Supreme Emblem Club of the United States of America  Membership  Membership is open to everyone, men and women, age 16 years and older. In earlier years, membership was limited to the wives, mothers, sisters, daughters, stepdaughters and widows of members of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. In 1979 there were 40,000 members, the same as a decade previously.Schmidt p.110 There were 41,000 members in 1989.Axelrod p.77 Currently, in 2018, the Supreme Emblem Club of the United States of America is facing a rapidly declining membership. The biggest reason for declining numbers of members is death or serious illness. The overall decline in Americans joining service organizations, as well as lack of available time due to working families has contributed to the decline in new membership applications. The majority of members are, now, senior citizens. A lack of new incoming members is an ongoing concern. In 2018, there are a lot of individual Emblem Clubs that make up the Supreme Emblem Club. The clubs are scattered all of the United States, east coast to west coast. The individual clubs range in size from very small to large. For example, Hartford Emblem Club # 150 from Hartford, VT has just twenty members, where Billerica, Massachusetts with over 200 members.  Ritual  The ritual of the Emblem Club was not considered secret, but neither was it really public. It was written by a member of the Elks and included a nondenominational prayer and a salute to the American flag.Schmidt p.110  Philanthropy and activities  The Emblem Club has adopted a formal program to support Americanism, and sets aside one week in June each year as \\"Americanism week\\". Prompted by the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the Emblem Club created a national disaster fund. The Clubs also sponsor scholarships and supports the Elks National Home in Bedford, VirginiaSchmidt p.109 Emblem clubs nationwide on the club level, as well as The national Organization, has given out over $2,000,000 in scholarships to students in the United States. Their unending efforts and work to support our American Veteran's is phenomenal as well as work with adults and children with Literacy projects and Drug Awareness projects.

Sigraf (also Sighraf, Sighrafr, fl. c.1175-1210) was a Romanesque stone sculptor, working on Gotland. He was mainly active as a sculptor of baptismal fonts, but also of reliquaries, carved pillars and reliefs. He was the most productive of several early medieval stone sculptors making baptismal fonts on Gotland. Works Unusually, this early medieval master stone sculptor is known by name since he has signed one of the fonts attributed to him (in Aa Church, on Bornholm island in Denmark) with runes, Sighraf Master. He was active on Gotland island, working in local sandstone and making inscriptions in Old Gutnish. The works of his atelier were exported to several places around the Baltic Sea, and he seems to have been the first sculptor of Romanesque fonts on Gotland to focus mainly on export, possibly because his home market was beginning to become satisfied. He was trained locally and his oeuvre displays similarities with earlier stone sculptors from Gotland, e.g. Semi-Byzantios and Majestatis. His style is classical Romanesque with Norse influences. Sigraf has been identified as the creator of 23 baptismal fonts, including those in Silte, Bro, Eke, Gr√∂tlingbo, Lau churches, all on Gotland, as well as Hannas and Hammenh√∂g churches, Scania; Brunflo church, J√§mtland; Mo church, H√§lsingland; Skogs-Tibble and Knivsta churches, Uppland; Locknevi church, Sm√•land; Tingstad church, √ñsterg√∂tland; M√∂lln, Schleswig-Holstein; St. Bendt's Church, Ringsted and possibly others.

These propulsion technologies are intended to provide effective exploration of our Solar System and will permit mission designers to plan missions to \\"fly anytime, anywhere, and complete a host of science objectives at the destinations\\" and with greater reliability and safety. With a wide range of possible missions and candidate propulsion technologies, the question of which technologies are \\"best\\" for future missions is a difficult one. A portfolio of propulsion technologies should be developed to provide optimum solutions for a diverse set of missions and destinations. Mason, Lee S. \\"A practical approach to starting fission surface power development.\\" proceedings of International Congress on Advances in Nuclear Power Plants (ICAPP‚Äô06), American Nuclear Society, La Grange Park, IL, 2006b, paper. Vol. 6297. 2006. In-space propulsion begins where the upper stage of the launch vehicle leaves off; performing the functions of primary propulsion, reaction control, station keeping, precision pointing, and orbital maneuvering. The main engines used in space provide the primary propulsive force for orbit transfer, planetary trajectories and extra planetary landing and ascent. The reaction control and orbital maneuvering systems provide the propulsive force for orbit maintenance, position control, station keeping, and spacecraft attitude control. Current technology A large fraction of the rocket engines in use today are chemical rockets; that is, they obtain the energy needed to generate thrust by chemical reactions to create a hot gas that is expanded to produce thrust. A significant limitation of chemical propulsion is that it has a relatively low specific impulse (Isp), which is the ratio of the thrust produced to the mass of propellant needed at a certain rate of flow. NASA's 2.3 kW NSTAR ion thruster for the Deep Space 1 spacecraft during a hot fire test at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A significant improvement (above 30%) in specific impulse can be obtained by using cryogenic propellants, such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, for example. Historically, these propellants have not been applied beyond upper stages. Furthermore, numerous concepts for advanced propulsion technologies, such as electric propulsion, are commonly used for station keeping on commercial communications satellites and for prime propulsion on some scientific space missions because they have significantly higher values of specific impulse. However, they generally have very small values of thrust and therefore must be operated for long durations to provide the total impulse required by a mission.Tomsik, Thomas M. \\"Recent advances and applications in cryogenic propellant densification technology.\\" NASA TM 209941 (2000).Oleson, S., and J. Sankovic. \\"Advanced Hall electric propulsion for future in-space transportation.\\" Spacecraft Propulsion. Vol. 465. 2000.Dunning, John W., Scott Benson, and Steven Oleson. \\"NASA‚Äôs electric propulsion program.\\" 27th International Electric Propulsion Conference, Pasadena, CA, IEPC-01-002. 2001. Several of these technologies offer performance that is significantly better than that achievable with chemical propulsion. Metrics In-space propulsion represents technologies that can significantly improve a number of critical aspects of the mission. Space exploration is about getting somewhere safely (mission enabling), getting there quickly (reduced transit times), getting a lot of mass there (increased payload mass), and getting there cheaply (lower cost). The simple act of \\"getting\\" there requires the employment of an in-space propulsion system, and the other metrics are modifiers to this fundamental action. Development of technologies will result in technical solutions that improve thrust levels, Isp, power, specific mass, (or specific power), volume, system mass, system complexity, operational complexity, commonality with other spacecraft systems, manufacturability, durability, and cost. These types of improvements will yield decreased transit times, increased payload mass, safer spacecraft, and decreased costs. In some instances, development of technologies within this technology area (TA) will result in mission-enabling breakthroughs that will revolutionize space exploration. There is no single propulsion technology that will benefit all missions or mission types. The requirements for in-space propulsion vary widely due according to their intended application. The described technologies should support everything from small satellites and robotic deep space exploration to space stations and human missions to Mars applications. =Technology area breakdown= The technology areas are divided into four basic groups: (1) Chemical propulsion, (2) Nonchemical propulsion, (3) Advanced propulsion technologies, and (4) Supporting technologies; based on the physics of the propulsion system and how it derives thrust as well as its technical maturity. Additionally, there may be credible meritorious in- space propulsion concepts not foreseen or reviewed at the time of publication, and which may be shown to be beneficial to future mission applications. =Defining technologies= Furthermore, the term \\"mission pull\\" defines a technology or a performance characteristic necessary to meet a planned NASA mission requirement. Any other relationship between a technology and a mission (an alternate propulsion system, for example) is categorized as \\"technology push.\\" Also, a space demonstration refers to the spaceflight of a scaled version of a particular technology or of a critical technology subsystem. On the other hand, a space validation would serve as a qualification flight for future mission implementation. A successful validation flight would not require any additional space testing of a particular technology before it can be adopted for a science or exploration mission. The challenge For both human and robotic exploration, traversing the solar system is a struggle against time and distance. The most distant planets are 4.5‚Äì6 billion kilometers from the Sun and to reach them in any reasonable time requires much more capable propulsion systems than conventional chemical rockets. Rapid inner solar system missions with flexible launch dates are difficult, requiring propulsion systems that are beyond today's current state of the art. The logistics, and therefore the total system mass required to support sustained human exploration beyond Earth to destinations such as the Moon, Mars or Near Earth Objects, are daunting unless more efficient in-space propulsion technologies are developed and fielded. Primary propulsion technologies The Glenn Research Center aims to develop primary propulsion technologies which could benefit near and mid-term science missions by reducing cost, mass, and/or travel times. Propulsion architectures of particular interest to the GRC are electric propulsion systems, such as Ion and Hall thrusters. One system combines solar sails, a form of propellantless propulsion which relies on naturally-occurring starlight for propulsion energy, and Hall thrusters. Other propulsion technologies being developed include advanced chemical propulsion and aerocapture.Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP). Glenn Research Center. NASA. 2019Ion propulsion system research .

Background In March 2012, French-Algerian Mohammed Merah went on a series of shooting sprees targeting soldiers and Jewish schoolchildren in Toulouse and Montauban, southern France. France was also on a state of high alert due to a threat from al-Qaeda in North Africa. The threat was sent in response to the French campaign to liberate northern Mali from Islamist occupation. Due to the alert, some 450 soldiers were placed on patrol in train stations and other locations in Paris. The attack occurred three days after of the murder of a British soldier in Woolwich, London, though President Hollande said there was no evidence to link the two attacks, despite this there was speculation as to whether it was a copycat attack. Attack In late afternoon, Saturday 25 May 2013, private first class C√©dric Cordier was patrolling a busy underground hall in La D√©fense in uniform with two other servicemen. Around 6 p.m., a man approached Cordier from behind and attacked him with a knife. The attacker stabbed Cordier in the neck and fled into a crowded shopping area before the other servicemen could react. The attacker stabbed the soldier several times, narrowly missing Cordier's jugular vein and carotid artery. =Victim= The soldier attacked was 23-year-old private first class C√©dric Cordier. He was stabbed in the neck and had lost a considerable amount of blood; however, his injuries were not life-threatening. He was in a stable condition and was treated at a nearby military hospital. He was released by 29 May. Some sources described Cordier as 25 years old; others identified him as C√©dric Cordiez. =Suspect= The suspected attacker was then-21-year-old Alexandre Dhaussy, a recent Christian convert to Islam. He turned 22 on 30 May. Dhaussy, unemployed and homeless, was already known to police since 2009 for petty crimes. He was known as becoming more radicalized in February, but had not been considered dangerous. Prosecutor Fran√ßois Molins said that Dhaussy's attack was believed to be motivated by his Islamic belief. In 2012, the police stopped him when he acted suspiciously as he did not want to wait for a bus with women; in 2011, he refused a job that involved working with women. Investigation French Minister of Defence Jean-Yves Le Drian said Cordier was targeted \\"because he was a soldier\\". The case was assigned to a counter-terrorism prosecutor. The attacker, a \\"tall, athletic, bearded man\\", was recorded on security cameras wearing a light-colored robe called djellaba. He was seen saying a Muslim prayer before the attack. The attacker took off his robe and fled in European clothing. On Wednesday 29 May, Minister of the Interior Manuel Valls stated that a man‚Äîlater identified as Alexandre Dhaussy‚Äîwas arrested in the morning in Yvelines. The suspect was traced from DNA found on a plastic bag left at the scene and was identified by fingerprint. He admitted the attack to the police who arrested him. Prosecutor Fran√ßois Molins said that Dhaussy \\"wanted to attack a representative of the state\\" and \\"acted in the name of his religious ideology\\", considering the character and timing of the attack. Molins also stated that Dhaussy stabbed Cordier with a \\"fairly clear intent to kill\\". Legal proceedings On Friday 31 May 2013, Dhaussy appeared before anti-terrorism judges Thierry Fragnoli and Gilbert Thiel, who determined there was enough evidence to proceed with an investigation. He was placed under formal investigation for \\"attempted murder linked to a terrorist enterprise\\". In November 2015, the court declared him not criminally responsible for psychiatric reasons.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on July 3, 2013. The episode was written by Ken Keeler and directed by Stephen Sandoval. In this episode, Bender meets his hero, Silicon Red, a folk singer who has been in jail 30 times, during a convict transport, and uses a wireless 3D printer to duplicate his guitar, but the wireless connection between Bender's brain and the 3D printer turns his folk song about an angry space railbot hunting down Bender into reality. Plot The Planet Express Discount Prisoner Transfer crew are transferring Dr. Brutaloff, a supervillain with Freddy Krueger-style finger-knives encased in a Han Solo-style block of frozen carbonite, to Elevenworth Variable Security Prison. Conveying this cargo to its final destination, Bender spies Silicon Red, \\"the universe's greatest folk singer\\" at the prisoner discharge office, retrieving his belongings and preparing to depart. Bender suddenly remembers his \\"lifelong dream of being a folk singer\\" and abandons Fry to chase down Silicon Red. As soon as Bender leaves, Brutaloff escapes from the carbonite, beats Fry up, and freezes Fry back into the carbonite up to his neck. Bender catches up to Silicon Red and takes a picture of Red's guitar, with the intention of using a 3-D printer to create a perfect duplicate. With this duplicate, Bender believes he will be a \\"famous folk singer\\". Dr. Beeler finds the image of the duplicated guitar in Bender's file system. He then turns a crank in Bender's compartment of mystery that causes Bender's components to wirelessly transmit the image to the printer. Bender then walks around Planet Express wearing a flannel shirt and playing his duplicated guitar. Fry, mostly encased in carbonite after being attacked by Dr. Brutaloff, begins at this point to make periodic sarcastic comments to complain of Bender's mistreatment of him at the prison. When the crew tell Bender that he doesn't know enough about folk music to be successful, he explains his analysis of \\"every folk song in the universe\\": bad-hearted woman cheats on her good man with a rambler. Bender uses this as a formula for creating his own folk songs. He crashes a performance by Silicon Red and performs one of his songs while Red is distracted, billing himself as \\"Ramblin' Rodriguez\\". The audience hates it, and Red explains that Bender's song is insincere. He sends Bender away and says, \\"Don't come back 'til you've lived a life worth singin' about!\\" Fry is still making biting comments about Bender's abandonment, as when Leela echoes Silicon Red: \\"You can't write a real folk song about experiences you haven't had.\\" Fry interjects, \\"You should write a song about a heartless robot who leaves his best friend to be murdered!\\" Bender continues to ignore him, and Fry becomes increasingly agitated. Bender follows Zoidberg's suggestion to go work on \\"the railroad\\" in order to have the experiences necessary to be a folk singer. In the Rusty Rail, a bar on \\"the wrong side of the tracks,\\" Bender meets Big Caboose, \\"a steel-drivin' man workin' the Trans-Universal line.\\" Bender sees Big Caboose, who is actually a robot, not a man, as exactly the kind of exciting personality that can be used in a good folk song. Caboose protests that he is nothing special. As Caboose introduces Bender to his colorful acquaintances, Bender takes notes so he can use these people as characters in his song. At the work site, Bender's job is to lead the singing of the laborers and drink cocktails. After living this grueling life for a while, he begins to create his song. By the time Fry and Leela arrive at Bender's railroad camp to deliver explosives, Bender's song includes the main character, Jezebel, and the rambler whom she runs to. Fry is still angry at Bender, and when he makes a mean comment, Bender adds a verse for him. It tells how Bender needs help to escape the angry Caboose, but Fry, still holding a grudge, sends him away. Fry gives credit where credit is due, responding, \\"You have accurately portrayed the nature of my grievance.\\" Bender is just adding the verse where his main character begins his quest to avenge himself on the rambler when Caboose bursts in and eagerly introduces Bender to his new fiancee. She flings herself at Bender as soon as Caboose leaves the room. Bender and the fiancee have sex, which inspires him to add another verse to his song. Foreshadowing later developments, the fiancee reveals that her name is Jezebel. Bender sees this as a lucky coincidence, not realizing its significance. While Fry and Leela hang out at Fry's house, Caboose, who was last seen near the railroad camp far from Earth, bursts in the door with a shotgun in his hands saying that he is here to shoot Bender down for sleeping with Jezebel. At this point, Fry and Leela realize that Bender's song is also playing out in real life. Back at camp, Bender has the idea for his hero to run over the rambler with a train, rather than shooting him. When Bender has this thought, his transmitter sends a train image from Bender's file system to the 3-D printer, and the printer begins to fabricate a train. Just as Bender is saying goodbye to Jezebel, Big Caboose crashes through the wall in the train from the printer, yelling that he has come to run Bender down. Caboose follows as Bender flees all the way to the apartment on Earth he shares with Fry. He bangs on the door and begs to be let in, but Fry mocks him, reminding him of the verse he had added to the song for Fry. Bender flees to Planet Express with Caboose not far behind. He finds Fry, Leela, and Professor Farnsworth trying to locate him. Bender is confused to see Fry, given that Fry had just mocked him at their apartment in his underwear, but decides to put off thinking about it. Leela explains that his song is coming true, and Bender finally realizes that he is transmitting his thoughts to the 3-D printer, resulting in duplicates even of people, such as the duplicate Fry who mocked Bender at their apartment. After some brief trouble with a band of gigantic octopuses, Leela realizes that Bender can \\"write his way out of\\" the problem. Fearing for Bender's safety, Leela suggests that Bender make up any old ending that saves him from Caboose. Bender refuses on the grounds of artistic integrity, as he still wishes to create \\"the best folk song in the universe\\". Just as he begins to add the next verse to his song, Caboose appears in his train and runs Bender down. At Bender's memorial service, it is revealed that this is not really Bender, but a duplicate fabricated by the 3-D printer. The real Bender arrives and sings the rest of his song, explaining that during the octopus trouble, he made a duplicate of himself with a fatal weakness that the real Bender doesn't have: artistic integrity. Bender and Silicon Red decide to sell out, and they are last seen performing a rap concert. Reception The A.V.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on June 19, 2013. The episode was written by Michael Rowe and directed by Raymie Muzquiz. Professor Farnsworth joins a gang of street racing punks, and ends up in a two- dimensional world. The title is likely a reference to the movie Two-Lane Blacktop (1971) Plot While the crew prepare to depart for a delivery, Leela argues with Farnsworth over the new modifications he has made to Bessie. He dismisses her concerns, and the ship barely clears the hangar before crashing. Sal tows Bessie away and Farnsworth breaks into the scrapyard and declares that he will convert the ship into a hot-rod using the spare parts lying around the scrapyard. The next morning, Farnsworth flies away from the scrapyard in Bessie, now a nearly unrecognizable junk heap. Two muscle- hovercars move up on either side of him and Farnsworth challenges them to a race, which they accept. A brief race ensues, in which the police give chase. Farnsworth escapes the police by using a dimensional drift device he had installed the night before. At headquarters, Leela unveils the new ship, a nearly featureless gray box that promises to be both safe and boring. Hermes sends Leela to shop for groceries and deliver Fry and Bender to karate class. During her return from these errands to headquarters, Farnsworth pulls alongside her in his hot-rod and tells her that she is not cool. Leela exclaims that she can still outdrive him, even in her ultra-safe ship. As they race on a looped track, Farnsworth again uses his dimensional drift device, but accidentally collides with Leela's ship. Fry is standing between the two ships as they collide, compressing him and the ships to near-flatness in a neat disc shape. The spectators presume Fry, Leela, and Farnsworth to be dead. A two-dimensional, but otherwise healthy, Farnsworth conjectures that colliding at relativistic speed has collapsed the group into two dimensions. Bender arrives on the scene, explaining that he had been napping onboard Leela's ship. Two creatures calling themselves the Lords of Flatbush arrive and report that a feast is being held in honor of Farnsworth and the others. At the feast, when Farnsworth attempts to explain three-dimensionality to the King of Flatbush, the King becomes angry and orders Farnsworth to be executed. Farnsworth and the others flee. Arriving at the two ships, Leela suggests that they use the dimensional drift device to attempt a return to the 3-D world. Just as Sal and the others in the 3-D world begin to cremate the remains, the remains themselves become the normal Bessie and her normal passengers. All is well, and Hermes indicates that the entire incident lasted about five minutes. Reception The A.V. Club gave this episode a B+.‚Äú2-D Blacktop‚Äù  Futurama  TV Club  TV  The A.V.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on June 19, 2013. The episode was written by Eric Rogers and directed by Edund Fong. Fry and Leela attempt to have a romantic time together, but with everyone around they can't get time alone. Plot At the end of the day at Planet Express, the crew take their leave of each other in the locker room. Fry and Leela make a big show of seeming to go their separate ways, but after everyone else is gone, the two emerge from hiding places and attempt to begin a romantic evening together. Interrupted by Scruffy, they realize that they can't really be alone there, so they leave. They share a nice walk in a deserted part of Central Park until Bender attempts to mug them. Leela beats him up and steals all of his mugging loot with Fry. Unable to have a night out completely alone, they settle for a quiet table at Elzar's restaurant. Here, Zoidberg, at his second job as a busboy, begins clearing their table in the middle of their meal. Even at Leela's home they can't quite be alone, as they are self-conscious about Nibbler. When Leela complains about the impossibility of being alone, a targeted advertisement appears on her wristlojackimator. The ad promotes Casa Isolada Eco Resort, a resort that caters to only one couple at a time and is devoid of other people. The ad announces a discount for Leela because she would be a repeat customer. Fry becomes jealous at this news, and Leela admits that she had visited once with Sean. The next day, the other crew members are loading the ship with tiny cars for a delivery to Simian 7, \\"the Planet of the Apes\\" where humans are strictly forbidden. Fry and Leela enter and announce that they are taking a week off. Farnsworth initially objects, but Fry reminds him that they are humans, so he allows them to leave. Being left shorthanded, Farnsworth instructs Amy to participate in the delivery disguised in her marmoset pajamas. At Casa Isolada, Fry and Leela enjoy a very nice day together. When they go skinny dipping in the pool, Leela's old boyfriend Sean inexplicably appears. To the horror of both Fry and Leela, Sean strips down and jumps into the pool with them. While everyone puts their clothes back on, Sean explains that he is here on vacation, availing himself of the repeat-customer discount. He is here due only to bad fortune; his vacation had come to an end, but the homeward shuttle is \\"under repair\\". Fry's jealousy, already at a fever pitch due to Sean's physical presence here, is further aroused when Leela accepts Sean's invitation to go to the resort's bar and catch up. Leela and Sean catch up fairly quickly, but then Sean plays his saxophone for her until she is quite bored and Fry is quite drunk and angry. Fry interrupts them and picks a fight with Sean. Sean's wife, Darlene, interrupts the fight to announce that the shuttle is repaired. She and Sean depart immediately to avoid any extra resort fees. On Simian 7 with the delivery complete, Amy and Guenter the Monkey recognize each other. Guenter promises not to give away Amy's secret. In fact, Guenter takes Bender, Amy, and Zoidberg on a tour of his city, leading them finally to the City Zoo where he explains that the zoo's policy of compassion leads to the animals not even knowing that they're in captivity. The point is driven home when they arrive at the human exhibit, where they find Fry and Leela enjoying their \\"secluded\\" vacation, unwittingly on public display on Simian 7. The arrival of the tour group coincides with the moment at which Fry and Leela make up and begin their vacation in earnest. Guenter and the others believe that their friends are being held against their will. They visit the zoo director, who turns out to be Banjo the Orangutan, to plead for their release. Banjo explains that not only are they not being held, but they actually paid to be there, as the human exhibit and Casa Isolada are one and the same. It is a popular exhibit, as different couples have visited for years. Banjo explains that when Sean and his current wife visited, the zoo decided to conduct a behavioral experiment: \\"strand\\" Sean and Darlene, entice Fry and Leela to visit, and observe. Guenter is satisfied at the news that Fry and Leela are here voluntarily, but the Planet Express crew are not. They worry about Fry and Leela being embarrassed. Banjo helps them to cool their fervor by showing them video of Fry and Leela complaining about and mocking each one of them in turn. Banjo finally reveals his knowledge that Amy is a human, and sounds the alarm. Fleeing, the crew resolve to rescue Fry and Leela in spite of being offended. On the threshold of success, they are swallowed whole by a moon worm and must wait a week to pass through its digestive tract. They emerge somewhat worse for the wear to find Fry and Leela just leaving, unaware of their presence, having spent a week on display. Back home, Fry and Leela tell the others about their vacation, oblivious to everything that happened outside their enclosure. Bender wants to humiliate them by revealing the truth, but Amy and Zoidberg remain strong, urging him to keep the secret. When Fry and Leela loudly and mockingly revisit their own secrets about the others, Amy changes her mind and advises Bender \\"Let 'er rip.\\". It is not until after the executive producer credits, that Bender is comically seen yelling the truth to Fry and Leela. Reception The A.V.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on July 10, 2013. The episode was written by Dan Vebber and directed by Frank Marino. In the episode, Bender becomes a firefighter, and ends up housing a solar flare who wants to blow up the Earth from the inside. Plot At a helium mining facility on the sun, Zapp Brannigan causes a cave-in that traps 15 miners inside the sun itself. Fry, Leela, and Bender venture to save the miners. When Bender attempts to abandon Fry and Leela and return to the ship, he inadvertently saves one of the miners. Prompted by Morbo, who is covering the breaking story on location, Bender goes on to rescue all of the remaining victims. He is hailed as the hero of the day, while Fry and Leela are recognized as his minor accomplices. A fire breaks out at their award ceremony. As Mayor Poopenmeyer explains, the fire department was sold to pay for Bender's medal. Fry, Leela, and Bender put out the fire, although Bender is very showy about it and once again receives most of the credit. Mayor Poopenmeyer decrees that the Planet Express crew are now the city's fire department. After some time as successful firefighters, the other crew members notice that Bender was present just before every one of the fires they extinguished. They ask themselves whether Bender might be setting these fires deliberately in order to inspire continued hero-worship. Their suspicions are confirmed when, while on the videophone with Bender, they see a fire break out in the shop just behind him. When he returns to headquarters, they confront him and kick him off the team. As Bender cleans out his locker, a strange, blue flame erupts from his shoulder. He tries to extinguish it, but the flame moves around as though deliberately dodging his attempts. Finally, the flame takes on the look of a shadowy face and begins to speak to Bender. It says that it is a \\"being of pure solar energy,\\" a member of a race that inhabits the Sun's photosphere. It explains that billions of years ago, it was imprisoned for treason, but that Bender has unwittingly transported it to Earth. When it announces its plans to ignite the Earth and rule over it, Bender realizes that this creature is the source of the fires for which he has been blamed. When Bender accidentally leads it to the sub-basement and the lava pit, it realizes that it can go to Earth's core and transform the Earth into a miniature Sun. To prevent this, Bender captures the creature within his compartment of mystery and flees to an ice floe in the Arctic Ocean, where there is nothing flammable. He announces to the creature, which he begins to refer to as \\"Flamo\\", that they will be here for the next billion years. At home, Fry accepts a package that contains Bender's hero medal, badly damaged in the fire at the Vampire Bank where Bender had kept it. Fry realizes that Bender never would have set a fire that would risk harm to this prize, and flies to the Arctic to retrieve and apologize to Bender. But when Bender explains that \\"it was a psychotic flame creature from the Sun who set those fires,\\" Fry decides that he must have been wrong about Bender after all. Fry angrily returns to headquarters alone. Unbeknownst to Fry and Bender, Flamo has escaped from Bender and attached itself to Fry's pants. At headquarters, it leaves Fry and ignites the Planet Express building itself. The crew is unable to extinguish the fire, as Flamo eludes their hoses. Just as they express relief that no one is left in the doomed building, Fry appears, hanging from the balcony and in need of rescue. Bender had discovered the loss of his captive earlier, and had left the Arctic just in time to arrive at this moment. He arrives such that only Fry knows of his presence, and quietly pulls him to safety. Fry refuses to be rescued, but Bender forces the issue. Fleeing with Fry in hand, Bender falls through the weakening floor, ending up in the sub-basement near the lava pit. Fry scolds Bender sharply and walks out on him, just as Flamo arrives and dives into the lava pit. Fry returns to scold Bender further, but Bender dives into the lava to capture Flamo. Before Fry can leave, a strange light draws him back into the room. Two large flame creatures appear, announcing that they are the \\"mystic aldermen of the Sun.\\" They await Bender's return, thank him for his heroism in capturing their escapee, explain that he is \\"now the greatest hero in Earth's history,\\" and depart with a bound Flamo. Fry finally understands the truth, and promises to vouch for Bender to the rest of the crew, but Bender explains that it cannot be. They wouldn't believe Fry either. And in fact, if Fry were to tell them that Bender is even present, they'll blame Bender for the fire. The only solution is for Fry to claim that he himself accidentally started the fire while Bender was thousands of miles away.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on July 24, 2013. The episode was written by Lewis Morton and directed by Stephen Sandoval. Calculon (who died in \\"The Thief of Baghead\\") is backed up and put into the body of a new robot so he can return to All My Circuits, only to learn that his over- the-top acting was never appreciated. Plot It has been a year since Calculon killed himself in a failed attempt to win an acting competition by making a death scene more realistic. Fry and Bender are so dissatisfied with Calculon's replacement Vaxtron on All My Circuits that they resolve to resurrect Calculon. Bender exhumes Calculon's body on live television, and Farnsworth organizes an occult ritual to return Calculon's soul to his body. The Robot Devil practically gives Fry and Bender Calculon's soul as Calculon has been driving him crazy with badly performed Shakespeare-style monologues ever since his suicide a year earlier. Successfully resurrected, Calculon returns to Hollywood to resume his role on All My Circuits, but he is rejected by the network president as \\"hammy\\" and \\"old-fashioned\\". Calculon receives another blow when he views the televised ceremony in which his star is removed from Hollywood's Walk of Fame and replaced with a second star for Robert Wagner's head. Undaunted, Calculon sees these setbacks as \\"an opportunity to prove anew\\" that he \\"is the greatest actor to ever trod the boards!\\" Starting at the bottom, he performs \\"HAL 9000\\", a one-man play that he had written years earlier; the play is unanimously panned by the critics. Stunned and crushed, he realizes that he is not the great actor he thought himself to be. Fry suggests that Calculon perform his trademark \\"dramatic pause\\" to cheer himself up, but Calculon vows never to pause again. As Calculon prepares to begin his journey through life as a non-actor, he solemnly laments his former delusions, moving Leela to tears. She suddenly realizes that Calculon is being sincere for the first time ever. She explains that if he could channel real emotions into his acting and leave out the hamming, he could be \\"great\\". She convinces him to audition for a bit part on All My Circuits. Calculon goes to an audition in disguise and finds that he is to portray \\"Calculon, back from his kidnapping ordeal.\\" The casting team, noting this auditionee's \\"old, past- your-prime\\" air, hires him on the spot. On the set, Calculon returns to his old ways, forgetting the humility he had so recently learned. The script calls for him to whine about how pathetic he is and commit suicide by hanging himself with a rope from the ceiling. Instead, he hams it up, ruining the scene. Leela verbally beats him back into submission, and in the second take Calculon deeply moves everyone on the set, even the network president. Calculon reveals his identity and is prevailed upon to take a bow. He inadvertently pulls on the rope that is still hanging from the ceiling, and equipment begins crashing to the floor, crushing Calculon to death. \\"On the basis of one performance that almost no one saw,\\" Calculon is posthumously re- awarded a star on the Walk of Fame. Back in Robot Hell, the Robot Devil's torments are just beginning as Calculon resumes annoying him. Reception The A.V. Club gave this episode a A-.‚ÄúCalculon 2.0‚Äù  Futurama  TV Club  TV  The A.V.

Bender searches the universe for his shiny, metal ass after an alien street gang has him stripped down to his bulb eyes and mouth grille. Plot Professor Farnsworth sends the crew to deliver a mysterious crate to Peoples Œ±, \\"the planet of gangs, thugs, and hustlers\\". At Peoples Œ±, Fry and Leela complete the delivery while Bender guards the ship. Fry and Leela deliver the crate, barely surviving a gang battle between the Blips and the Cruds, the two main gangs on the planet. They return to the ship only to find that thieves have bot-jacked Bender, having made off with all of his body except his eyes and mouth. Bender's RoJack leads the police to the chop-shop of Yuri, who provides them a list of the buyers of Bender's parts. The Planet Express crew search the galaxy and find all of the parts except for Bender's ass, which turns out to have been on the freighter Floatwell when it sank in the Sargaseous Sea. This \\"sea\\" is actually a nebula, but traveling there is like sailing an ocean: asteroids rise from dense fog like icebergs, and ships can sink. Navigating the Sargaseous Sea with difficulty, Leela crashes the ship into an inadequate lighthouse, whose keeper, Tarquin, helps the crew to recover Bender's ass. While they relax back at the lighthouse, the cruise ship S.S. Miami Muy Caliente approaches the lighthouse on a collision course, the ship's captain unable to see its feeble light. Celebrating Bender's reunion with his ass, Fry takes flash photos of Bender posing with it. The light reflecting from Bender's ass is brighter than the lighthouse, enough to alert the crew of the Caliente just in time to avoid disaster. Seeing its potential as a highly effective lighthouse mirror, Tarquin, Fry, and Leela convince Bender to leave his ass behind. Although Bender accepts his loss, his ass finds it unbearable to listen to Tarquin reading Bible verses. It escapes from the lighthouse and returns to Bender. Upon the reunion, fireworks appear in the sky, but they turn out to be ships exploding in the Sargaseous Sea, where the lighthouse beacon shines no more. Reception The A.V.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on August 7, 2013. The episode was written by Eric Horsted and directed by Lance Kramer. Leela develops a mutation which causes her to sprout tentacles all over her body, and ends up at a genetic engineering facility owned by Mom's Friendly Robot Company. The episode parodies many well-known fairy tales including Rapunzel, Chicken Little, and especially Jack and the Beanstalk among other references. Plot While riding a mechanical buggalo at Tex 1138's, Leela finds that she is breaking out in suction cups. Dr. Tenderman explains that due to a genetic condition, her body has begun a process called squidification, in which her limbs \\"will be gradually transformed into a slithering mass of tentacles.\\" There is no cure and a very expensive surgery can only delay the symptoms for a few months. In spite of these drawbacks, the crew send Fry to sell the company ship to pay for the operation. At the market, a con artist buys the ship for two gigantic, magic beans that are supposedly a miracle cure for Leela's ailment. Back at headquarters, Farnsworth is so angry that he knocks the beans out of Fry's hands, causing them to fly out the window. The beans fall onto fertile soil, watered by a leaking pipe, and rapidly grow into a beanstalk that reaches to the clouds. Leela, not wanting to share her misery with her friends, decides to cut off contact with them and live in the sewer. As she opens the manhole leading to the sewer, she sees the new beanstalk and chooses to climb it instead. At the top of the beanstalk, Leela finds a flying castle grounds occupied by colorful flying fish and a unicorn that eats them. She is captured by Mom's three sons and taken to Mom who explains that the castle is her genetic engineering facility, where she conducts experiments such as creating gigantic beanstalks for feeding the hungry. In spite of the arguably philanthropic nature of Mom's experiments, Leela is offended, considering the experiments to be crimes. After the Planet Express crew realize that Leela is gone, Fry and Bender fly to Mom's facility to rescue Leela. They find Leela in the lab, where Fry is horrified to see Leela's entire body has been transformed into the mass of tentacles that Dr. Tenderman predicted. While trying to escape from the lab, Fry, Leela, and Bender encounter a giant bound to an operating table connected to medical machinery. Believing that he is suffering from Mom's genetic experiments, Leela frees the giant, who chases the escapees until they flee down the drain of the giant's bathroom sink. The drain carries the three back to the bridge of the facility, where Leela confronts Mom. In order to put a stop to the experiments, Leela causes the facility to fly out of control. As it nears the ground, it passes close by the Planet Express headquarters, to which Fry, Leela, and Bender jump to safety. Later, Mom drops by to thank Leela for helping her to \\"engineer the perfect bean.\\" Leela is still opposed to genetic engineering in principle. Mom attempts to sway her by re- introducing her to the giant, whom she has cured of hereditary gigantism and reduced back to a normal-sized man. Leela is still not impressed, but changes her mind when Mom announces that she can cure Leela herself. The episode ends with Fry and a cured Leela walking hand-in-hand through New New York City, which has been transformed into a jungle of giant beanstalks. Trivia * During the scene in the tower, Bender runs into a chained up Finn and Jake from the Cartoon Network show Adventure Time. Jake and Bender are both characters voiced by John Dimaggio. * While climbing up the mass of tentacles up the tower, a parody of the Batclimb cameos from Batman occurs where Fry and Bender encounter Adam West's head jar on the body of a large bat and Burt Ward's head jar on a robot body as part of Mom's experiments. *When Leela first meets Mom in the Castle she remarks \\"I am not an animal!

It originally aired on Comedy Central on August 14, 2013. The episode was written by Michael Rowe and directed by Edmund Fong. The Planet Express crew enter Fry's dreams and find themselves back in the year 1999 in search of a mysterious alien song. The title is a spoof of Game of Thrones, while the episode as a whole makes many references to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Inception, and the plot contains many similarities to Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Plot Earth is slowly approached by a mysterious alien ship that repeatedly broadcasts four loud musical tones, which can be heard by everyone on the planet. At first, the music is merely an annoyance, but as the ship draws nearer, the booming tones begin to cause structural damage and threaten to tear the planet apart. No one has any idea what the ship is trying to communicate; only Fry seems to recognize the alien melody, but his memory of hearing it is so vague that he cannot place it. Seeing that it is crucial for Fry to recover his memory of the melody, Farnsworth scans Fry's brain, finding that Fry's memory of the music originates from December 31, 1999, the night he was cryogenically frozen. While the alien ship is still two weeks away from Earth, Farnsworth connects Fry to one of his machines and sedates him, transporting Fry in a kind of dream state to the world of his memories of that day. The crew are able to view Fry's experience on a TV monitor, and even communicate with Fry with microphones. After exploring his neighborhood and retracing his steps for a very short time, he accidentally wakes up, only to find that he has been asleep for almost two weeks. The alien ship is now so close that major earthquakes occur every time the tones are played. Although initially reluctant to return to the dream state, remembering what a bad day it had been for him including hanging out with his \\"crazy\\" family, Fry returns to the dream state at the family home, where Seymour runs up to greet Fry. As Fry muses that perhaps he does miss his family after all, he brushes off Farnsworth's protests and re-engages with his family, savoring the experience. He realizes that he needs closure, especially with his mother, but his fellow crewmembers begin to arrive in his dream, interrupting. Eventually they drag him out of the house, insisting that he continue his mission. Making a final effort to escape them, he runs back inside, but his people are gone; a quirk of this dream state has eliminated them. Bitter and defeated, Fry leads the crew through the rest of his day, even up to his last two minutes at Applied Cryogenics, still with no satisfaction. Fry takes his place in front of the cryogenic tube, leaning back in his chair as the countdown to the New Year begins. In the final seconds as he falls back into the tube, he at last hears the four notes, followed by two additional, higher-pitched notes that he had not earlier recalled. Armed with this new information, Nixon leads the crew to a landing facility built to receive the alien craft. When it arrives and blasts out the four notes, Fry uses a keyboard to respond with the final two. The ship lands, and from it emerges Digby, Nibbler's personal chauffeur. Digby explains that on December 31, 1999, he had conducted Nibbler to Earth on his mission to ensure that Fry entered the cryo-tube. Accompanying Nibbler, Digby used a key fob, coincidentally at the very instant that Fry fell in, to remotely lock the spaceship. The fob, after all, was the source of the musical tones, the two additional notes being the acknowledgement from the ship. Mission accomplished, Digby and Nibbler became severely drunk at a local pub. Heading home, having forgotten where they had parked their ship, a drunken Digby dropped the fob, with keys attached, down a storm drain. Forced to take a cab back to their base on Vergon 6, Digby had later retrieved a spare set of keys, and has been traveling from one planet to another, broadcasting the security signal in an attempt to locate the \\"company car\\". Fry leads them to the roof of the Applied Cryogenics building, where the Nibblonian ship still rests, ransacked, with a dead battery. With Bender's help, Digby flies away. Nibbler thanks Fry, vowing to somehow repay him. Fry thinks of his mother and laments that they cannot give him what he really wants. That night, while asleep, Fry has a dream about his mother, and once more expresses his desire to speak with her. When a television sportscaster announces the results of the 2000 Rose Bowl, Fry is confused; since that game took place after he was frozen, it should be impossible for him to know the results. Nibbler appears, and reveals that this is not actually Fry's dream; it is one of his mother's, and is the gift that Nibbler spoke of. Fry asks if it is really her, and she replies that it is, telling him that she has dreamed of him often since his disappearance. When she asks him what he would like to talk about, he wordlessly embraces her with tears in his eyes. Back in the 21st century, Fry's mother dreams of her son with a smile on her face.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on August 21, 2013. The episode was written by Lewis Morton and directed by Frank Marino. In this episode, the crew get trapped aboard the Planet Express ship with a horrific alien creature. The episode's title derives from Murder on the Orient Express and parodies Alien and The Thing. Plot Fry accuses Bender of using his toothbrush to polish his buttocks, and purchases a spy camera to check. At the Planet Express offices, Hermes accuses Zoidberg of eating his lunch. Leela accuses Amy of using her punching bag for golf ball practice. In turn, Amy accuses Leela of using her golf club to pound dents out of the Planet Express ship. The crew gathers together later that day, and Fry publicly accuses Bender. He shows the others the video he recorded, but it turns out that although Bender was not using his toothbrush that night, he did steal Fry's kidney whilst he slept. Leela reveals she also used a spy cam to spy on Amy, only to find out that Scruffy had used Amy's club to kill a fly and that Zoidberg had been living in Leela's punching bag. Hermes also used a spy camera to catch Zoidberg eating his lunch, only to find out that Bender had used his lunchbox to keep Fry's kidney on ice. Much to everyone's disgust, the footage shows Leela unwittingly eating the kidney, and that Hermes' manwich had instead been used in Professor Farnsworth's kidney transplant. The crew continue to bicker uncontrollably until Farnsworth threatens to do something about it. Farnsworth hires business consultant Dan McMasters for a team building exercise. On the way to the corporate team building retreat, they pick up a random hitchhiker at the behest of McMasters. The hitchhiker is used by McMasters to be the first \\"trust fall\\", but McMasters is apparently eaten by the hitchhiker, who transforms into a monster, crawls into the ventilation shafts and shuts off the power. Scruffy's apprentice Jackie Jr. is soon eaten by the creature. The crew go to the panic room, but the creature shuts off the life support for the ship. Farnsworth splits the crew into three teams: Zoidberg and Hermes must restart the life support system, Leela and Amy must travel to the bridge to get the steering wheel so as to pilot the ship from the panic room, and Bender and Fry must relight the pilot light from outside the ship to get the engines restarted. Fry and Bender manage to restart the engines, but Bender's gyroscope is broken when the engines ignite in his face. Zoidberg and Hermes restart the life support system (which was being blocked by Jackie Jr's skeleton), but Hermes' motion detector shows that the monster is coming. Hermes gets stuck in the vent and Zoidberg tries, in vain, to free him. Amy and Leela are in the basement of the ship and encounter the monster. Leela attempts to fight it, but is captured. Amy's golf shot to the monster's face saves her and they make a run for the bridge. Outside the ship, Bender's gyroscope is still not working; panicked, he accidentally breaks Fry's helmet causing him to suffocate in the vacuum of space. Bender, in a bid to save his life as well as fix his gyroscope, stuffs Fry into his compartment. Fry then takes over Bender's body by wearing him like a suit (creating a combination dubbed \\"Frender\\") and gets him under control. Leela and Amy finally make it to the bridge and take the steering wheel. Happy with their success, they proclaim themselves \\"Lamy\\". They run back to the panic room and see what they think is the monster (but is actually Hermes stuck in the vent) and attack it. Zoidberg, calling themselves \\"Hermberg\\", dislodges Hermes by squirting him with ink. Amy fixes Bender's gyroscope by bashing him with her club, but the group abruptly comes face to face with the monster and flee back to the panic room. Once they get the ship up and running again, Professor Farnsworth reveals that the whole thing was an exercise in trust. The three teams congratulate each other, but Hermes is abruptly eaten by the monster, who was disguised as the Professor, who also manages to claim Scruffy and the Professor himself via shape-shifting. The surviving crew members run out of the panic room and arm themselves with laser pistols. The monster continues to eat various members of the crew until only Fry and Bender are left; they meet up and proclaim that they trust each other (and Bender admits to using Fry's toothbrush) before McMasters enters the room. McMasters assures them that the whole thing was staged to help build trust and the monster, Blorgulax, is his business associate. He asks them to join him and the rest of the crew to a pizza party on the bridge, but Fry and Bender are convinced that he is the monster and kill him. Too late, the crew reveal themselves to be alive and well, and Bender disposes of what little is left of McMasters. Back on Earth, a news report is talking about the mysterious disappearance of McMasters and are calling it a homicide. Fry and Bender agree to not tell anyone about what happened. Linda then states that the police will give $1,000,000 for information leading to an arrest. In the event of two killers, they will give total immunity to whomever turned in the other and $2,000,000 (a variant of the prisoner's dilemma).

Dr. Zoidberg falls in love with a human flower merchant while Bender competes in a deadly tap-dancing contest. Plot Dr. Zoidberg manages to make a face-to-face date with an alien woman he's been seeing online, despite the other Planet Express crew members warning him that his date will be repulsed by his disgusting stench. After buying flowers from a merchant named Marianne (Emilia Clarke), it turns out the crew was right, and Zoidberg's date is driven away by his horrible armpit odor. Depressed that he has once again failed at a relationship, he returns the flowers to Marianne. Suddenly, Roberto appears and tries to mug Marianne and Zoidberg, but the latter's odor chases him away. Marianne is grateful towards Zoidberg, who is surprised that she was not disgusted by his stench. Marianne reveals she has no sense of smell, and the two date, leading to a happy relationship. The Planet Express crew are surprised that Zoidberg managed to go out with a normal woman, and encourages him to use his medical knowledge to give Marianne a sense of smell, though Zoidberg is afraid she will reject him like many others have. After Marianne expresses her desire to smell flowers, Zoidberg decides to give her a nose transplant that will allow Marianne to smell, much to the latter's joy.

Bender agrees to feed his ego, but finds that he is rivaled by Tonya (Tara Strong), a young girl with a heart condition. Bender attempts to sabotage Tonya, but the latter turns out to be just as malevolent as the robot, and breaks his leg. Bender recovers quickly and dances against Tonya, who wins but suffers a heart attack and dies.

It serves as the 26th episode of the seventh season, and the 140th episode of the series overall. The episode was written by Ken Keeler and directed by Peter Avanzino.WebCite query result It premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on September 4, 2013, along with Futurama Live, a special preshow and aftershow for the occasion. As the conclusion to the series, the episode revolves around the romantic relationship between Fry and Leela. The plot involves Professor Farnsworth inventing a device that allows the user to travel backwards in time by ten seconds. However, it is stolen and abused by Fry, who wants to use it to prolong the sunset during a romantic dinner after his marriage proposal to Leela. Due to the recurrently uncertain production status of Futurama, \\"Meanwhile\\" is the fourth episode written to serve as an ending to the series. It follows \\"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings\\", Into the Wild Green Yonder and \\"Overclockwise\\", all of which were also written by Ken Keeler. \\"Meanwhile\\" was watched by 2.21 million people in its original broadcast, making it the 5th most watched episode ever to originally air on Comedy Central, and it received acclaim reviews from television critics. Plot The crew delivers a package to Luna Park, with Fry and Leela both mentioning that this is where they went on their first delivery. In the park, they go on a ride called the \\"Mecha-Hexadecapus\\". During the ride, Bender vomits out nuts and bolts and one of them jams the ride's gears, causing Leela to fly out of the ride and out of the park's glass dome and into space. Leela survives; however, the worry of losing her again cements Fry‚Äôs decision to propose to her. Back at the Planet Express building, The Professor announces two new inventions: a time button that causes the entire universe to jump backward 10 seconds in time, and a shelter that shields people from the button's effects. Fry takes the button and uses it to repeatedly steal candidate diamonds for an engagement ring. After presenting the ring to Leela, he invites her to meet him atop the Vampire State Building at 6:30 pm if she agrees to marry him. If she does not arrive, he will infer rejection. His plan is to use the button to make the sunset last as long as he and Leela want. He is heartbroken when, at what his watch tells him is 7:02 pm, she has still not arrived. He jumps off the roof, but sees Leela is approaching and notes the building's clock reads 6:25; his watch has continued to run normally through all his uses of the button. He tries to undo the jump but, because he has been falling longer than 10 seconds, is unable to return to the rooftop. As the device takes 10 seconds to recharge, he continually loops falling toward the ground from several feet below the roof, never able to reach safety. The Professor notices the device has been stolen and is repeatedly looping time, and worries the universe could be damaged. He also warns that anyone leaving the shelter could be destroyed if the device is subsequently reused less than 10 seconds later, because the anti-chronitons would not know where in ten seconds to send that person back. Bender betrays Fry's theft of the device, and, using the shelter, the crew approach the Vampire State Building to save him. By this time, Fry is tired after falling for so long and accidentally lets go of the button. He is instantly killed when he hits the ground, but Leela picks up the button from Fry's splattered remains and uses it to loop the final seconds of Fry's life. The Professor, being outside the time shelter, tries to stop her and is seemingly vaporized when Leela presses the button. After several loops, Bender engineers a method of saving Fry's life using an airbag he contains. Fry survives this time but lands on the button, smashing it and freezing time throughout the universe for everyone and everything except himself and Leela. With the world theirs alone, Fry and Leela conduct their wedding themselves and spend what is, for them, decades romantically wandering the stationary world. A mysterious glimmer bothers them from time to time, but otherwise, they are very happy. In old age, they go to the top of the Vampire State Building to drink the champagne Fry had laid out there before the button was destroyed. The glimmer finally reveals itself to be the Professor, who was not killed, but was instead rotated into an orthogonal time that runs at right angles to the familiar one. He has been trying to find the button for decades and, since Fry has kept the pieces, is able to rebuild it with one key modification: the next press will release an enormous anti-chroniton blast, ripping everyone out of stasis and reverting the entire universe right back to the instant before the Professor conceived of the device, and no one will have any memory of what has happened since then. Despite having enjoyed growing old together, Fry and Leela both agree to \\"go around again\\" and the Professor presses the button. Reception The original American broadcast of \\"Meanwhile\\" on September 4, 2013 was watched by 2.21 million households, making it the 5th most watched episode ever to originally air on Comedy Central. \\"Meanwhile\\" has received critical acclaim. Max Nicholson, for IGN, wrote that \\"Meanwhile\\" was \\"a fitting end to a classic animated series\\". He gave the episode a 9 out of 10. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, said that, \\"the first five minutes are passable but rushed, and the hook of Fry deciding he needed to ask Leela to marry him isn't all that exciting\\". However, he later went on to say that \\"this finale settles somewhere between the 'too happy' and the 'oh dear God when will it end', which makes it just about perfect. It has just about everything you could want from Futurama: there's a nifty time-travel plot, Fry and Leela get married, Bender is a jackass, Zoidberg loses $10, and Fry dies\\". He graded the episode an A.

But after toeing up to that line of doing something truly impressive and revolutionary for the show, they backed away again.

Contributing elements of the listing include 23 buildings, 15 other structures, and 14 sites. In the 1850s, some 230 African Americans were enslaved on Friendfield Plantation and they produced 900,000 pounds of rice annually. Among them was Jim Robinson, born into slavery in 1850; one of his descendants is former First Lady Michelle Obama (n√©e Robinson.) Overview The current owner is Oscar Johnson Small II and his second wife Robbie Kephart. The founder and first owner was James Withers (1710-1756), a brick maker in Charleston, South Carolina who also became a planter. He developed a plantation along the Sampit River for indigo and rice from 1734 onward, based on the use of enslaved labor.Friendfield Plantation HistoryFrances Cheston Train, A Carolina Plantation Remembered, The Social Register Association, Summer 2013 He bought slaves from Barbados, where they had been transported from Africa and were sometimes seasoned for a period of time. In 1818, Francis Withers (1768-1847), a grandson of James, built a new house on the Friendfield Plantation. In the Low Country, where slaves developed a concentrated culture on large plantations, and slaves from Africa continued to be imported, African Americans developed what became known as the Gullah or GeeChee culture. It has been recognized as distinct for its creole African roots in language, cuisine and culture, and adaptations to the region. Paternal ancestors of First Lady Michelle (Robinson) Obama, including Jim Robinson, were among the Gullah enslaved laborers on the Friendfield Plantation. Francis Wither appointed his son-in-law, Dr. Alexius Mador Forster, III, MD (1815-1879), to manage the plantation, but it fell into disrepair after the American Civil War. An extended agricultural depression in the country brought down commodity prices. Combined with struggling with the change to free labor, planters faced a sudden lack of economic resources. After the war, Withers had the land cultivated mostly by sharecroppers, freedmen who paid a portion of their crop to use the land. Michelle Obama's ancestor Jim Robinson, who became free at age 15, is believed to have been among them. Friendfield Plantation passed out of the Withers family in 1897 when Elizabeth Hunt Warham Forster (1820-1906) sold it to B. Walker Cannon. (It had passed from the Withers bloodline in 1847 when Francis Withers died, as Elizabeth was his step-daughter.) The property was later purchased by Patrick C. McClary, Sr., who used it as a duck hunting club. This was a common use for plantations by wealthy owners in the early 20th century. In 1926, the Friendfield House burned down in a fire. In 1930, the plantation was purchased by Radcliffe Cheston, Jr., an investment banker from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1932, he had a new Friendfield House built, designed by noted Philadelphia architect Arthur Ingersoll Meigs (1882-1956). Up until the 1950s, African-American sharecroppers lived on the plantation and worked the fields. But during the early 20th century, thousands of African Americans left the South to go north in the Great Migration to industrial cities, seeking better opportunities and an escape from Jim Crow oppression. Michelle Obama's paternal grandfather Fraser Robinson, Jr. migrated to Chicago from the Georgetown area. He and his wife LaVaughn (n√©e Johnson) returned to the Low Country from Chicago after retirement. In 1989, the property was partly purchased by Daniel Thorne; it was co-owned by him and Frances Cheston Train, a daughter of Radcliffe Cheston. In 2019, Oscar Johnson Small II and his second wife Robbie Kephart bought the property.

The pilgrimage is similar to the Kumbh Mela of Prayag, where ablutions are performed. The temple and grounds are also known as Dakshina Kasi. In Kottiyoor (Kerala), there are two shrines on the banks of the Vavali (Bavali) river. On the west bank sits the Thruchherumana Vadakkeshwaram Temple (called Ikkare Kottiyoor Temple by natives), which is a nalukettu temple complex. On the east bank, there is a temporary shrine called \\"Akkare Kottiyoor\\", where the festival ceremonies take place. This is opened only during the Vysakha Mahotsavam. During the Vysakha pilgrimage, puja is performed in a temporary temple (Ikkare Kottiyoor) in the same prehistoric Vedic location. Only temporary thatch huts, which are removed after the festival, are built. Every year, thousands of pilgrims come to the Yajna bhoomi. Yajna shala has a Swayambhu Shivalinga, where ablutions are performed. The Akkare Kottiyoor temple, where the yajna takes place, has no Sreekovil/Garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum); instead, it is located on a raised platform made of river stones named Manithara (‡¥Æ‡¥£‡¥ø‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥±). The temple is located at the center of a pond that is the origin of a spring. From the pond, water flows towards the Vavali river to the west. The entire shrine looks like Shivalinga itself if viewed from the sky. This pond is called Thiruvanchira(‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥µ‡¥û‡µç‡¥ö‡¥ø‡¥±). Devotees circumambulate the shrine within the pond, mostly in the rain. There is another raised circular platform beside the main shrine, called Ammarakal Thara(‡¥Ö‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥Æ‡¥æ‡¥∞‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤‡µç ‡¥§‡¥±). Finally, there is a giant Jayanti vilakku (a type of Lakshmi lamp) and an idol covered by a palmyra leaf umbrella (‡¥ì‡¥≤‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥ü) there. It is believed that Sati immolates herself on Ammarakal Thara. Prajapati and his activities- Illustration The Ikkare Kottiyoor temple and Akkare Kottiyoor temple are dedicated to Mahadeva. The Vavali River flows between the shrines. The Ikkare Kottiyoor temple is believed to have been created by Parashurama, whereas the Akkara Kottiyoor temple is a Swayam bhu, which means naturally formed.The system of rites and rituals of the temple were developed by Sankaracharya. Period of pilgrimage The festival occurs from the Swati Nakshatra of the Saka calendar month of Vaisakha to Chitra Nakshatra of Jyaistha month. This is equivalent to the Malayalam calendar months of Medam-Edavam to Edavam-Mithunam or the Gregorian months of May‚ÄìJune to June‚ÄìJuly. The pilgrimage occurs during the monsoon season when there is abundant rainfall in the region. The flow of the Vavali river water is suitable for ablutions and the sacred pond Tiruvanchira is filled with water. The climate during the pilgrimage is moderate to slightly cold. Even though the pilgrimage is called Kottiyoor Ulsavam or Kottiyoor Festival, the programs related to the pilgrimage are only religious rituals there are no entertainment programs like festivals in other temples. Only Vedic hymns are recited and priestly rites and rituals performed. Legend Shiva taking Sati's body Daksha Yagna was an important turning point in the creation and development of sects in Hinduism like Shaktism and Shaivism. It is the story behind the 'Stala Purana' (Origin story of Temples) of Shakti Peethas. Daksha organised a huge yaga and intentionally avoided Shiva and Sati. Even though discouraged by Shiva, who told her not to go to a function where she and her husband was uninvited; the personal bondage with her parents made Sati ignore social etiquette and her husband's wishes. Sati without Shiva went to the ceremony. She was snubbed by Daksha and insulted by him in front of the guests. Sati unable to bear further insult ran into the Sacrificial fire and immolated herself. Shiva upon knowing the terrible incident in his wrath invoked Virabhadra and Bhadrakali by plucking a lock of hair and thrashing it on the ground. Virabhadra and Bhoota ganas marched south and destroyed all the premises. Daksha was decapitated and the yagnja shaala was devastated in the rampage. The Bhutaganas' celebrated victory by plucking the beard of 'Presiding Master' of the yagnja, Sage Bhrigu as a war souvenir. Daksha was later forgiven and given life by fixing a ram (Male Goat)'s head and the yagna was allowed to complete, with the presence of all the divinity. The story continues by the act of Vishnu in pacifying Shiva, who was in deep grief in seeing the half burned corpse of his beloved wife. Vishnu embraced Shiva to pacify him. Shiva unable to part with Sati took her corpse and wandered. The body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi fell in the places Shiva travelled.

Kottiyoor Ulsavam is conducted in the Tiruvanchira pond in rainy season where only hay thatched huts are allowed. The sacred pond is a spring and a tributary of the Vavali river and is an appealing environment - a reminder of ancient vedic times.Kottiyoor itself is a serene hilly area. It is believed that Bhutaganas brings the materials needed for the rituals from the Tirunelli MahaVishnu Temple (10 km south of Kottiyoor Temple) through the Brahmagiri valley. Kottiyoor Temple, as its name implies, is the meeting of the Trimurti - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The Shivalinga of the Kottiyoor Temple is Swayambhu i.e. formed naturally. Kottiyoor Temple pilgrimage is a rarity where each community is given right to perform specific rituals and duties for their pilgrimage. The ceremonies for the Kottiyoou Festival, performed in sequential order, are Shiva as Nataraja- A Chola Age Statue-(Los Angeles County Museum of Art) Purakkuvam, Neerezhunnallathu, Vavalikettu, Neyyattam , Bringing Agni and Ooda (Reed), \\"Vaal\\" Ezhunnallathu, \\"Chothi Vilakku\\" , \\"Naallam Thurakkal\\" , \\"Bhandaram Ezhunnallathu\\" , Thiruvona Aaraadhana , Ilaneervaipu , Ilaneerattam , Revathi Aaraadhana , Rohini Aaraadhana , Thrikur Ariyalavu , Makam , Kalam Varavu , Atham naal , Vallattom , Thengaeru , Chithra naal , Thrikkaleshattam , Thandilmeil Oonu , Vaal madakkam , Valiya Vattalam Payasam , Purakkuvam (Prakuzham, Purakuzham) Rohini aradhana is an important ceremony. Kurumathoor Nayikan Brahman, the title of the head of a Vaishnavite family in the area, who has the birthright for the ceremony, performs the rite. He is considered a representation of Vishnu. The Namboothiri performs the rites and embraces the Swayambhu Shivalinga, i.e. Alingana Pushpanjali. This commemorates the incident which took place during the Daksha yaga. Shiva was in heartbreaking sorrow, when he saw the burned dead body of his beloved wife Sati. Rohini aradhana, is a reminder of how Vishnu embraced Shiva to pacify and comfort his dear mate. =Entry of Parashurama= Ages after the dreadful incident and havoc, carrying Sati Devi's tears and curse, the land started being governed by Kali (the personification of Kali Yuga, the reigning power of calamity). Kerala was submerged under water. Parashurama, who donated all his conquered land to Brahmins, needed a place to live. At the request of Varuna, he threw his axe from Gokarna to Kanyakumari and Kerala reemerged from the sea. Parashurama was attacked by Kali in Kottiyoor. He overpowered Kali and, as he raised his axe to kill him, the Trimurti materialised there and stopped Parashurama. He released Kali on the condition that he would never ever come into the premises of the swyam bhuu linga of his Guru, Shiva, in Kottiyoor. He started the twenty-seven-day festival to remember the incidents that happened in the place. =Exclusiveness in rites= * Usha pooja is only for twenty- four days to match with the standard yaga period. However the rest of the pooja is conducted for all twenty-seven days. * The quantity of Nivedyam is fixed as in ancient time. It not increased proportional to an increase in the number of pilgrims. * No pooja is performed at Ammarakkal (Sati Devi's suicide site) only Pushpanjali and Nivedyam is offered. * Punyaham is never performed, as the location is blessed with the congruence of the Shaiva, Shakta, Vaishnava divinities. Kottiyoor is so pure that all impurities are washed away. The location is the origin of a spring which form part of the Vavali River. The festival takes place during the rainy season. * Ganapathi Homam is performed every day in morning. * The whole premises is a temporary shelter and it is a replica of the ancient Vedic worship and culture, thousands of years ago. Unlike most pilgrimage sites there is no permanent temple structure. The pradakshinam (circumambualtion)is through a pond. Access The national highway passes through Kannur town. Mangalore and Mumbai can be accessed on the northern side and Cochin and Thiruvananthapuram can be accessed on the southern side. The road to the east of Iritty connects to Mysore and Bangalore. The nearest railway station is Kannur on Mangalore- Palakkad line. There are airports at Mangalore and Calicut.

She is known for her political career, being the financier of the King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski prior to his election as king, his adviser in 1763-1776, and as one of the leaders of opposition in 1776-1793. She also had a relationship with the king in 1763-76. Life =Early life= She was the daughter of Piotr Branicki and Melania Teresa Szembek and the sister of Franciszek Ksawery Branicki. Her education is not known, but it was noted that she did not speak the French language (at that time an important part of a good education) very well. She married Jan J√≥zef Sapieha in 1753, whom she divorced in 1755 for his adultery. She remarried Jan Sapieha, a relative of her first spouse, by whom she was widowed in 1757 after an unhappy marriage. She became the mother of Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha. She inherited the position of wojewodzicowƒÖ mscis≈Çawska from her second spouse. =Supporter of Poniatowski= El≈ºbieta Branicka was not regarded a beauty, but described as a fascinating and charming woman, intelligent and with a great interest in politics. In 1761, she became an ally of Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, and gave him a loan of 300.000 zlotys, with a great interest, to fund his political career: he was still paying of the debt six year later. During the interregnum of 1763-64, they reportedly begun an affair, and she influenced him against the Czartoryski family. She was the rival of Magdalena Agnieszka Sapie≈ºyna, who in contrast to her supported the Familia (political party) and in parallel attempted to influence Poniatowski in favor of it. When Poniatowski was elected king, Branicka came to be in a very powerful position. =Political adviser of Poniatowski= Her influence on Poniatowski, both in her capacity as his lover and his moneylender, was well known, and the king included her in his inner circle of advisers and entrusted her with political assignments. In December 1765, for example, the king gave her the task to handle an affair regarding the contract of August Moszy≈Ñski and the Coinage Commission. Along with her co-mistress, Magdalena Agnieszka Sapie≈ºyna, she was also given an allowance of 200 ducats monthly, which was paid until at least 1775. The summer of 1766, she was given the task by the king to welcome the famous Madame Geoffrin on her visit to Poland. In a letter from 1768, the king described her as irreplaceable among his \\"petites amies\\" (lovers) and called her wonderful, warm, intelligent and an extremely useful ally. El≈ºbieta Branicka actively and publicly participated in state affairs and politics. She openly and frequently attended the sessions of the Sejm and the Tribunals and she also participated in the Diet assemblies, with the king's support. Her gender was no formal bar for this activity; within the contemporary Polish system of an aristocratic elective monarchy, her membership within the nobility was the main criteria. She was known to be able to affect the appointment of offices. Despite their opposition to the kings uncles the Czartoryski, she and her brother long kept their place in the circle of the king's political advisers. Reportedly, she also used her position to enrich herself and her family. =Opposition leader= The relationship between El≈ºbieta Branicka and the king deteriorated during the 1770s. In 1774, her brother Franciszek Ksawery Branicki joined the opposition in against the king and the Russian ambassador Stackelberg, with whom El≈ºbieta Branicka had a bad relationshop. In 1776, after having supported her brother against Stackelberg and the king, she was exiled from the royal court to her estate in Kode≈Ñ, with a monthly allowance of 200 ducats. In order to control her activities, Russian troops was placed on her estate Kode≈Ñ to keep her under guard. During the Sejm of 1776, she filed complaints and demanded the king's debt to her to be paid, which caused a long going conflict. She also engaged in long-going lawsuits with her relatives over inheritance and property issues. She also supported her son's political career by petitions to the king. During these years, she was regarded one of the most notable leaders of the opposition party of the Branicki, Seweryn and Rzewuski families against the king. As late as 1778, the king referred to her as one of the women for whom he felt the most respect. During the Great Sejm, she initially sided with the opposition lead by Stanis≈Çaw Szczƒôsny Potocki against the suggested constitutional changes, and was one of the significant players in Polish political life during the Sejm. She finally supported the Constitution of 3 May 1791. She retired from political life in 1793. =Portrayals= El≈ºbieta Branicka was a controversial figure in contemporary Poland, and her activity as a politician, particularly during the Great Sejm, made her the subject of satires, pamphlets and poems by Wojciech Jakubowski, Tomasz Wƒôgierski, Rafa≈Ç Gurowski, Ignacy Potocki and Franciszek Zab≈Çocki.

Written by Saeroen, the film followed a doctor who falls in love with his maid, as well as her failed romance with a fellow villager. Starring Adnan Kapau Gani, Djoewariah, and S. Joesoef, the black-and-white film was cast and advertised to cater to the growing native intelligentsia. Despite mixed reviews, it was a commercial success. As with most films of the Indies, Asmara Moerni may be lost.  Plot  After four years of doing his residency in Singkawang, Borneo, Dr. Pardi (Adnan Kapau Gani) returns to Java to open a practice. Before then, he goes to Cigading to visit his family and give them souvenirs. Upon arrival he is stunned to find that his family's maid Tati (Djoewariah), who had been his childhood playmate, is now a grown and beautiful woman. He secretly begins to fawn over Tati, although he does not tell her the reason. When Pardi's mother tells him he should marry quickly, he refuses all of her suggested brides. He says only that he already has someone in mind, aware that his mother would never approve an inter-class marriage with the maid. Tati's fianc√©, Amir (S. Joesoef), is jealous of all the attention that Tati is receiving, which leaves her no time for him. He plans to leave Cigading for the capital, Batavia (today Jakarta), where he will find work. Tati, upon learning this, joins him. She lives at her aunt's home in the city, making a living by washing clothes, while he finds lodging with a local man and learns to drive a becak (pedicab). Together they begin saving for their wedding. Unknown to them, Pardi has cut short his time in Cigading to move to Batavia, both to begin his new job and to find Tati. Days before the wedding, Amir is playing his flute when he is approached by a singer known as Miss Omi, who asks him to join her troupe on an international tour. Amir refuses, even after Omi hires him to drive her around the city in an attempt to convince him. After dropping Omi off, Amir is approached by a man who asks him to deliver a package; however, before he can deliver the package Amir is arrested and charged with smuggling opium. When Amir does not return, Tati and her aunt are worried: as Tati saw Amir with Omi, she fears that the two have run away together. Heartbroken, she intends to return to Cigading. When she and her aunt visit their boss, Abdul Sidik, they unknowingly pass PardiAbdul Sidik's doctor. Upon returning home, Pardi calls Abdul Sidik and asks him to take Tati in as if she were his daughter and educate her. Tati is a fast learner, and is soon comparable to any woman from a wealthy family. After being held eighteen months without trial, Amir is released and returned to Batavia. He is unable to find Tati, leaving him to wander the streets. Omi spots him, and again she asks him to play with her troupe. Amir agrees, and soon newspapers are filled with advertisements touting his name. Spotting one, Tati and Abdul Sidik go to a performance, only to learn that Amir was the victim of a car accident. At the hospital, where Amir is being treated by Pardi, Tati learns the truth behind Amir's absence. On his deathbed, Amir asks Pardi to take care of Tati; the two are later married.  Production  Asmara Moerni was directed by Rd Ariffien, a former journalist who had been active in the nationalist and labour movements before turning to theatre. He had joined Union Films ‚Äì the company behind Asmara Moerni ‚Äì in 1940, making his debut with Harta Berdarah (Bloody Treasure). Union's head Ang Hock Liem produced, while the story was written by journalist Saeroen, who had joined Union after commercial success on Albert Balink's Terang Boelan (Full Moon, 1937) and with the production house Tan's Film. The black-and-white film starred Adnan Kapau Gani, Djoewariah, and S. Joesoef.; It was the feature film debut of Gani and Joesoef,; while Djoewariah had been on Union's payroll since Bajar dengan Djiwa (Pay with Your Soul) the preceding year. At the time there was a growing movement to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government, and convince them to view domestic films, which were generally considered to be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions. This was blamed, in part, on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew. As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in Asmara Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions.  Release and reception  Asmara Moerni was premiered on 29 April 1941 at Orion Theatre in Batavia; the crowds were mostly natives and ethnic Chinese. Rated for all ages, advertising for the film emphasised Gani's education and Joesoef's upper-class background. It was also advertised as breaking away from the conventional standards of stage theatre, such as music, which were omnipresent in the contemporary film industry. By August 1941 it was screened in Singapore, then part of the Straits Settlements, and billed as a \\"modern Malay drama\\". A novelisation was published later in 1941 by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning. The film was a commercial success, though reviews were mixed. An anonymous review for the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad found the film \\"fascinating\\", with good acting, though another review for the same paper found that, though the film was better than contemporary works such as Pantjawarna and Sorga Ka Toedjoe, its claim to abandon stage standards was to be taken \\"with a pinch of salt\\". A review from the Surabaya-based Soerabaijasch Handelsblad found the film full of drama, describing it as \\"Western motifs, played in the native environment, with a specifically Sundanese situation\\".  Legacy  After Asmara Moerni, Union produced a further three films; only one, Wanita dan Satria, was by Rd Ariffien, who left the company soon after, as did Saeroen. Gani did not act in any further films, but instead returned to the nationalist movement. During the Indonesian National Revolution (1945‚Äì49) he became known as a smuggler, and after independence became a government minister. In November 2007 Gani was made a National Hero of Indonesia. Djoewariah continued to act until the 1950s, when she migrated to theatre after receiving a series of increasingly minor roles. Asmara Moerni was screened as late as November 1945. The film is likely lost. All movies were then shot on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, many films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

He was professor of ecology at the Institute of Ecology, University of Jena from 2009 to 2010, president of the Royal Entomological Society from 2004 to 2006, and honorary visiting professor at the School of Biosciences, Cardiff University. Loxdale works on the population biology, ecology, and genetics of insects, especially aphids and their wasp parasitoids. Education and early career Hugh Loxdale was educated at Corner Hall Secondary Modern Boys‚Äô School, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England from 1962 to 1967, and Apsley Grammar School, Hemel Hempstead (now Longdean School) from 1967 to 1969. On leaving school, he joined the Entomology Department at Rothamsted Experimental Station (now Rothamsted Research), in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, working in the Insect Survey, then run by L.R. (Roy) Taylor (1924‚Äì2007), studying the demography of moths and aphids as part of the national light trap and suction trap surveys, respectively.Harrington, R. (2014) The Rothamsted Insect Survey strikes gold. Antenna 38, 159‚Äì166. Scientific contributions Loxdale's research demonstrated that as the tansy aphid, parasitized by its specialist wasp parasitoid Lysiphlebus hirticornis, underwent increased genetic variation, so did that of its parasitoid. This suggested a fine-grained co-evolutionary tracking to be in operation.Nyabuga FN, Loxdale HD, Heckel DG, Weisser WW. (2012) Coevolutionary fine-tuning: evidence for genetic tracking between a specialist wasp parasitoid and its aphid host in a dual metapopulation interaction. Bulletin of Entomological Research. pages 149 ‚Äì 155. Such a scenario is supportive of the Red Queen hypothesis, whereby a host organism (here an aphid) is attempting to evolve away from its antagonist (here a parasitoid), which is meanwhile co-evolving in order to retain the ability to attack it, i.e. keep pace with it in an ecological-evolutionary sense.van Valen, L. (1973) A new evolutionary law. Evolutionary Theory 1, 1‚Äì30. Loxdale also determined the insecticide resistance status of the serious agricultural pest the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer). From this work, the spatial and temporal dynamics of this important (and now highly cross- resistant) pest aphid could be followed, thereby leading to more rational and effective control measures in the field.Tatchell GM, Thorn M, Loxdale HD, Devonshire AL. (1988) Monitoring for insecticide resistance in migrant populations of Myzus persicae. In: Proceedings of Brighton Crop Protection Conference - Pests & Diseases - 1988. pages 439-444.Foster SP, Harrington R, Dewar AM, Denholm I, Devonshire AL (2002) Temporal and spatial dynamics of insecticide resistance in Myzus persicae (Sulzer).

Loxdale has written reviews on absence of strict genetic uniformity in populations of clonal organisms such as aphids. This lack of uniformity is due to the rapid rate of mutation resulting from various mechanisms (e.g. point mutations due to errors of replication, inversion polymorphisms related to transposon effects, etc.) amplified by the huge reproductive potential of the animals concerned, e.g., not only do aphids show ‚Äòtelescoping of generations‚Äô such that an adult asexual female has her children and grandchildren within her, but also the ability to produce a large number of asexual copies (10-100 offspring) in a short time (10-14 days). Hence, a single aphid can, in theory produce enough offspring to cover the entire planet to a depth of many kilometres in a single growing season!Harrington, R. (1994) Aphid layer (letter). Antenna 18, 50. This of course has serious potential consequences for the agricultural, horticultural and forestry industries worldwide.Loxdale, H.D. (2016) Insect biology - a vulnerable discipline? Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata 159, 121‚Äì134. Loxdale has also co-authored overviews on several key areas of biological thought and research.

(2016) The ‚Äògeneralism‚Äô debate: misinterpreting the term in the empirical literature focusing on dietary breadth in insects. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 119, 265‚Äì282. The consensus of these articles is that the act of filling a new ecological niche is the fundamental act of specialization for any new species or sub-specific population. Whilst some species may be polyphagous to varying degrees, nevertheless diet breadth tends to involve preference for certain prey items in predatory as well as herbaceous species. Generalism, if it exists, is highly dependent upon an animal's morphology-anatomy, genetics, physiology-biochemistry, and chemistry, especially chemical ecology. This in turn governs the behaviour of the animal concerned and restrains it in terms of its habitat choice and what it can eat. In this light, the age old ‚Äòarms race‚Äô of insect herbivores with plants has led to the plants evolving an armoury of secondary chemical defenses which cause, more often than not, specialisms in terms of host and indeed habitat on the part of the herbivore/s involved. Ultimately, even apparently highly polyphagous species such as the aphid M. persicae, said to attack plants in 40 families,Blackman RL, Eastop VF. (2000) Aphids on the World‚Äôs Crops: An Identification and Information Guide, Second Edition, John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester. may be because of its highly specialised biochemistry-enzymology.

Originally a member of the military-backed Union Revolutionary Council that seized power in 1962, Kyi Maung resigned from the ruling council in 1963 after a public disagreement with General Ne Win, the leader of the council, on the military's long-term role in government.BNN 2011: 2‚Äì3 He joined the National League for Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, in 1988 and won a seat in the Hluttaw from Bahan Township in the 1990 general election. He was vice-chairman of the NLD from 1988 to 1997. He was imprisoned four times for a total of 12 years by successive military governments. Early life Kyi Maung was born on 20 December 1920 to Ngwe Khin and her husband Po TheinBNN 2011: 1 in Rangoon (now Yangon), British Burma to a family of Teochew-Burmese heritage. He enrolled in Rangoon University in 1936, and became a fervent anti-colonialist. He participated in 1938 nationwide strikes and rallies against the British colonial regime. He nearly died after he was severely beaten in his head by the police on 20 December 1938, which is now commemorated as Bo Aung Kyaw Day in Myanmar. He was by his fellow student striker Aung Kyaw, who was also severely beaten by the police, until Aung Kyaw's last breath. Career Kyi Maung was a final year student in 1941 when he left university to join the Burma Independence Army to fight the British colonial government. In 1943, he was sent to Japan for officer training school, from which he graduated in 1945. Upon return, he joined No. 5 Burma Rifles. He eventually rose to the rank of Battalion Commander when he was sent to the US for further training between 1955 and 1956. He was promoted to regional commander in 1960 when he became head of Yangon Command. Col. Kyi Maung was one of the 18 senior officers that seized power from the democratically elected government of U Nu in 1962. Later that year, he was reassigned to Southwestern Command. In 1963, he was forced out of the army and the council after he disagreed with Gen. Ne Win, the leader of the council, regarding the military's role in government. The army continued to keep tabs on him when he retired and was put under arrest a couple of times. After being released from his seven years of confinement, he was selected to be part of the Executive Committee of the political party, National League for Democracy (NLD), which was led by Aung San Suu Kyi until her house arrest in July 1989, after which Kyi Maung became its leader. Under his leadership, the NLD won a substantial majority in the parliament during the 1990 elections. The result, however, was not officially recognized by the ruling military junta then. Kyi Maung went to prison four times. Gen. Ne Win sent him to prison twice for a total of seven years between 1963 and 1987.

He played first-class cricket for Essex between 1935 and 1937. At the time of his death he was the oldest surviving Essex player. Career While studying at Keble College, Oxford, Belle appeared in two matches for Oxford University in 1935, then played a full season for them in 1936, winning his Blue. He usually batted in the middle order. Between 1935 and 1937 he also played regularly for Essex as an amateur. His highest first-class score was 70 for Oxford against Surrey in 1936, the highest score on either side, which enabled Oxford to gain a first-innings lead. His first-class cricket career ended when he became a master at Orwell Park School near Ipswich in Suffolk. He began playing Minor County cricket for Suffolk in 1939. After serving in the Royal Artillery during the Second World War, he continued to play for Suffolk, helping them to their first title in 1946 and captaining them between 1949 and 1953. He played 92 matches for Suffolk, scoring 4459 runs at an average of 35.11, with a top score of 175 not out. He was subsequently county chairman, holding office when Suffolk won the championship in 1977 and 1979.

The touring party played predominantly rugby union, but also a small number of association football and Victorian rules football matches. McCausland was also a cricketer of note and is recorded to have represented Wellington in a First-class match. Personal history McCausland was born in Jamieson, Victoria Australia in 1865 to John Conyngham McCausland and his wife Sarah. McCausland's parents were originally from County Armagh in Ireland, but emigrated to Australia where his father became a manager for the Union Bank of Australia. Around 1880 the family moved to New Zealand and McCausland followed his father into banking. By 1892 McCausland had returned to Australia, marrying Alice Shore that year in St Leonards, New South Wales. The marriage was short lived and in 1895 he remarried to Ada May Barber (born 1869/1870), the couple settling in Goulburn. The couple had six sons, John (known as Jack) EB McCausland (1896), Harold Conyngham McCausland (1897), James E McCausland (1899), Selwyn M McCausland (1903), Geoffrey M McCausland (1905) and Thomas R McCausland (1909). In 1930 Ada died and in 1932 McCausland married again, to Alice Maud Barber (born 1871), the sister of his second wife. He died in Sydney in 1936 at the age of 71. New Zealand Natives McCausland was a keen sportsman as a youth, and played rugby while a teenager, representing the New Zealand Bank's team at the age of 18. By 1886 McCausland was a regular three-quarter with Wellington and by 1888 he represented both Gordon and Auckland. When the 1888 New Zealand Natives rugby union team was being selected, McCausland was not an initial choice. As an employee of the Bank of New Zealand, it would have required a lengthy leave of absence, and McCausland was not part of Natives' captain Joe Warbrick's plans. When Warbrick broke a bone in his foot, McCausland was offered a place on the team and after obtaining a 12-month leave of absence from his employer he stepped in as a replacement for the injured captain. His duties for the Natives also included tour secretary and stand in umpire. He was the best goal-kicker in the Native side, and on the British leg of their tour scored 151 points in 63 matches ‚Äì making him the highest points scorer on tour. It was most likely due to only being granted 12 months leave from his banking position that McCausland returned to New Zealand following the Victorian leg of their Australian tour, so he scored only 4 points outside of the British matches.

It is widely regarded as the pinnacle of Picasso's Blue Period. The painting is in the permanent collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art.  Description and history  La Vie (The Life) was painted in Barcelona in May 1903. It is and portrays two pairs of people, a naked couple confronting a mother bearing a child in her arms. In the background of the room, apparently a studio, there are two paintings within the painting, the upper one showing a crouching and embracing nude couple, the lower one showing a lonesome crouching nude person very similar to Sorrow by Vincent Van Gogh. With this Picasso repainted another motif, a birdsman who attacks a reclining naked woman, traces of which are visible to the naked eye.

In contrast, the new painting sold only a month after it was finished, to a French art dealer, Jean Saint Gaudens. The sale was reported in the Barcelona newspaper, Liberal. With La Vie Picasso repainted the canvas of The derniers Moments from 1899, a painting that he had presented at the Paris International Exhibition 1900.Carsten Peter Warncke, Pablo Picasso 1881-1973. Benedikt Taschen, Cologne 1992, vol. 1, pp. 103-107. The painting was given by the Hanna fund to the Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio in 1945 and is in their permanent collection. In 2020, the painting was loaned to the Royal Academy of Arts in London as part of the 'Picasso and Paper' exhibition, where it was displayed with preparatory drawings and other works on paper exploring corresponding themes of poverty, despair and social alienation. Picasso and Paper - Press Release  Interpretation  The interpretation of the enigmatic composition has been the subject of much discussion.Cf. Becht-J√∂rdens, Gereon & Wehmeier, Peter M.: Picasso und die christliche Ikonographie. Mutterbeziehung und k√ºnstlerische Position. Dietrich Reimer, Berlin 2003, pp. 14-180, esp. pp. 14-19; pp. 44-45. The male figure clearly shows the portrait of Picasso's friend, the painter Carlos Casagemas, who had committed suicide not a long time before Picasso created La Vie. X-ray photographs show that Picasso first executed a self-portrait that he later replaced by the portrait of his friend.Cf. Marilyn McCully & Robert McVaugh, New light on Picasso‚Äôs La Vie, in: The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art, February 1978, pp. 67-71; Marilyn McCully, Picasso und Casagemas. Eine Frage von Leben und Tod, in: J√ºrgen Glaesemer (Ed.), Der junge Picasso. Fr√ºhwerk und Blaue Periode. Pro litteris, Zurich 1984, pp. 166-176; fig. d, p. 169. This fact and the circumstance that the confrontation of the two groups happens within a studio makes it verisimilar that self-reflective questions of the young artist are addressed in La Vie.Cf. Michael C. Fitzgerald (Ed.), Picasso. The artist‚Äôs Studio. Yale University Press, New Haven 2001. The crucial point indeed, scholars agree, seems to be the enigmatic gesture in the center of the composition. Noli me tangere, Antonio da Correggio, c. 1525 In 2003 Becht-J√∂rdens and Wehmeier recognized the well known painting Noli me tangere, a masterpiece by Antonio da Correggio in the Museo del Prado, as the possible source for this gestureCf. Becht-J√∂rdens, Gereon & Wehmeier, Peter M.: Picasso und die christliche Ikonographie. Mutterbeziehung und k√ºnstlerische Position. Dietrich Reimer, Berlin 2003, pp. 40-41; pp. 132-133; fig. 1-3, cf. Correggio, Noli me tangere, Museo del Prado, ca. 1518. and proposed an interpretation situated on two levels. The first, a biographical one that concerns the dyadic mother and child relationship and \\"the mental trauma and feelings of guilt that result from the inevitable conflicts\\" caused by detachment, and the second, a self-referential one about the Messianic mission of the modern artist in the sense of Friedrich Nietzsche, \\"his role in the world, and [...] the very essence of art\\". The two levels of interpretation are \\"interconnected by the significant role played by Picasso‚Äôs mother\\", who protected and adored her baby thus establishing some kind of cult of the divine child and by admiring her son and his first attempts \\"encouraged him to follow his way and reinforced him in his self-perception as a genius\\". The mother therefore can be seen as the representative of the artist‚Äòs \\"first audience, fascinated by his early mastership of academic art.\\" But to get an independent personality, and to fulfill his mission as a modern artist, for Picasso the detachment of both the mother and the incomprehending part of his audience that rejected his turn to modern art is needed. \\"As an answer to his confrontation with these difficulties, Picasso using further elements taken from the tradition of Christian art, for example the last supper, the resurrection, the veiled hands, presents himself both as Creator of a new art and its Messiah, who has come to comfort the suffering and redeem the world as a new Saviour, as a teacher of a new kind of seeing that frees from reality constraint. Thus, La Vie can be understood both as an answer to autobiographical experiences of the young Picasso and as a self-referential comment on his role as an artist and as an annotation on his fundamentally new art.\\"All citations from Becht-J√∂rdens, Gereon & Wehmeier, Peter M.: ‚ÄòTouch me not!‚Äô A gesture of detachment in Picasso‚Äôs La Vie as symbol of his self- concept as an artist  Literature  * Reyes Jim√©nez de Garnica, Mal√©n Gual (Edd.), Journey through the Blue.

Early life right Morganfield was born to Muddy Waters and Mildred Williams in Chicago. He was raised by his mother and seven uncles, with occasional visits from Muddy, and never really got to know his father. Regarding his childhood in Chicago, Morganfield says, \\"I didn‚Äôt have the pleasure of getting up and walking down the lakefront and watching the ocean and the lakes or something. I came up and there was gunshots and someone may have gotten hit down the street. I mean, I‚Äôve seen the drunks, the drugs, and I tell you again, I can‚Äôt forget these things because it makes up who I am today. It makes me the man I am today.\\" thumb Despite growing up surrounded by music, Morganfield did not consider becoming a professional musician until after his father‚Äôs death in 1983. At that time, Morganfield was driving trucks for a living, but the strain was wearing on him. He suggested that a recurring dream of Muddy Waters performing on stage helped prompt him to begin playing the blues professionally. Career Morganfield has described the resemblance of the tone and timber of his voice to that of his father‚Äôs voice as a double edged sword. The similarity is evident in For Pops: A Tribute To Muddy Waters, an album on which Morganfield performs several Muddy Waters songs. Morganfield launched his music career in blues clubs on the south side of Chicago, where he performed a mix of his father‚Äôs material and his own original works. Regarding his performances of Muddy Waters songs in addition to his own material, Morganfield says, \\"I started to sing to show the world that dad left me here. I love and am proud to sing his songs just like I love and will always be proud of him. I'm not Muddy Waters and I'm certainly not trying to be Muddy Waters. I'm Mud Morganfield but when I'm up on stage I always feel pops is there with me and it means so much that I can get on stage and keep his music alive around the world.\\" In May 2015, his album, For Pops: A Tribute To Muddy Waters, won a Blues Music Award in the 'Traditional Blues Album' category.

The standard, whose full name is Quantities and units Part 1: General was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), superseding ISO 31-0. It provides general information concerning quantities and units and their symbols, especially the International System of Quantities and the International System of Units, and defines these quantities and units. It is a part of a group of standards called ISO/IEC 80000. Contents list The standard is divided into the following chapters: * Foreword * Introduction # Scope # Normative references # Terms and definitions # Quantities # Dimensions # Units # Printing rules * Annex A (normative) ‚Äì Terms in names for physical quantities * Annex B (normative) ‚Äì Rounding of numbers * Annex C (normative) ‚Äì Logarithmic quantities and their units * Annex D (informative) ‚Äì International organizations in the field of quantities and units Scope ISO 80000-1 gives \\"general information and definitions concerning quantities, systems of quantities, units, quantity and unit symbols, and coherent unit systems, especially the International System of Quantities, ISQ, and the International System of Units, SI.\\" Terms and definitions The standard includes the following definitions. * quantity: property of a phenomenon, body, or substance, where the property has a magnitude that can be expressed by means of a number and a reference * kind of quantity: aspect common to mutually comparable quantities * system of quantities: set of quantities together with a set of non-contradictory equations relating those quantities * base quantity: quantity in a conventionally chosen subset of a given system of quantities, where no quantity in the subset can be expressed in terms of the other quantities within that subset * derived quantity: quantity, in a system of quantities, defined in terms of the base quantities of that system * International System of Quantities: system of quantities based on the seven base quantities: length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity * quantity dimension: expression of the dependence of a quantity on the base quantities of a system of quantities as a product of powers of factors corresponding to the base quantities, omitting any numerical factor * quantity of dimension one: quantity for which all the exponents of the factors corresponding to the base quantities in its quantity dimension are zero * unit of measurement: real scalar quantity, defined and adopted by convention, with which any other quantity of the same kind can be compared to express the ratio of the second quantity to the first one as a number * base unit: measurement unit that is adopted by convention for a base quantity * derived unit: measurement unit for a derived quantity * coherent derived unit: derived unit that, for a given system of quantities and for a chosen set of base units, is a product of powers of base units with no other proportionality factor than one * system of units: set of base units and derived units, together with their multiples and submultiples, defined in accordance with given rules, for a given system of quantities * coherent system of units: system of units, based on a given system of quantities, in which the measurement unit for each derived quantity is a coherent derived unit * off-system measurement unit: measurement unit that does not belong to a given system of units * International System of Units: system of units, based on the International System of Quantities, their names and symbols, including a series of prefixes and their names and symbols, together with rules for their use, adopted by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) * multiple of a unit: measurement unit obtained by multiplying a given measurement unit by an integer greater than one * sub- multiple of a unit: measurement unit obtained by dividing a given measurement unit by an integer greater than one * quantity value: number and reference together expressing magnitude of a quantity * numerical quantity value: number in the expression of a quantity value, other than any number serving as the reference * quantity calculus: set of mathematical rules and operations applied to quantities other than ordinal quantities * quantity equation: mathematical relation between quantities in a given system of quantities, independent of measurement units * unit equation: mathematical relation between base units, coherent derived units or other measurement units * conversion factor between units: ratio of two measurement units for quantities of the same kind * numerical value equation: mathematical relation between numerical quantity values, based on a given quantity equation and specified measurement units * ordinal quantity: quantity, defined by a conventional measurement procedure, for which a total ordering relation can be established, according to magnitude, with other quantities of the same kind, but for which no algebraic operations among those quantities exist * quantity-value scale: ordered set of quantity values of quantities of a given kind of quantity used in ranking, according to magnitude, quantities of that kind * ordinal quantity-value scale: quantity-value scale for ordinal quantities * conventional reference scale: quantity-value scale defined by formal agreement * nominal property: property of a phenomenon, body, or substance, where the property has no magnitude Quantities =International System of Quantities (ISQ)= The special choice of base quantities and quantity equations, given in ISO 80000 and IEC 80000 defines the International System of Quantities, denoted ‚ÄúISQ‚Äù in all languages. Derived quantities can be defined in terms of the base units by quantity equations. There are seven base quantities in the ISQ: length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. Dimensions Units Section 6.5 of the standard describes the International System of Units including SI prefixes and IEC binary prefixes kibi- to yobi-. Printing rules Section 7.3.2 states that the decimal mark is either a comma or a point on the line and further states that whichever decimal mark is used, that same mark should be consistently used. This is in agreement with prior ISO standards and revisions, notably resolution 10 of the 22nd CGPM, 2003. Annex A (normative) ‚Äì Terms in names for physical quantities According to Annex A, \\"[t]he logarithm of the ratio of a quantity, Q, and a reference value of that quantity, Q0, is called a level\\". For example LP = ln(P/P0) is the level of a power quantity P. Annex B (normative) ‚Äì Rounding of numbers Annex C (normative) ‚Äì Logarithmic quantities and their units Annex C introduces the concepts of power quantities and root-power quantities, and deprecates field quantity.

In the interim, Purdy played with Fury III, guitarist Nate Fowler's Elixer, Tommy Hale, Jasper Stone and Ruffled Feathers. In 2001 Purdy and Suede reconvened to form critical favorite Nope and produced the full length pop/rock CD Gettin Up The Rent (Backlash Records). Nope's album and demos brought them back to Lloyd's attention. Lloyd produced their 2004 album Competition at his NYC studio. The album proved to be their final work.

Sal forces him to deliver an apology in order to smooth over relations with another Mobster, Tony Matazano, whom he has insulted. Nick reluctantly delivers the apology, though his friend George, a local Irish thug unaffiliated with the mafia, ridicules him for having to show respect to what he views as a contemptible person. Although Tony accepts Nick's apology, tensions remain high between them. When Nick also delivers an apology to Tony's estranged daughter, Ali, whom his cousin had insulted, Nick and Ali become interested in each other, though she at first rejects his overtures. Ali does not like her father, and she is concerned by Nick's relationship to the Boston crime families. Nick and George rob a local drug dealer that George had befriended, and Nick attempts to give some of the money to his brother, Vito. However, their father, Vincent, refuses to accept it and calls it blood money. Meanwhile, Nick's attempts to romance Ali pay off, and the two begin dating, though she teases him about his stereotypically macho attitude. Sal finally gives Nick a contract, but he is unable to perform the murder. Seeing his hesitation, George performs it for him. Now a made man, Nick realizes that he no longer has to show as much respect around town. After first shaking down a local business owner to whom he owes money, he revisits Tony and demands a cut of his rumored Eastern European prostitution ring. Although resentful, Tony obliges. Now needing to collect on his outstanding debtors, Tony becomes frustrated with his incompetent underlings, who allowed an anonymous gambler to accrue a $25,000 debt without knowing his personal details. Tony personally takes charge of the collection and threatens to kill the man over the phone. George later calls Nick and directs him to a warehouse, where he reveals himself as the anonymous gambler. Nick is horrified to find that George has kidnapped and beaten Tony, and Nick attempts to talk George out of Tony's murder. After first threatening to kill George, Nick instead kills Tony. Joe, Tony's second in command, instantly becomes suspicious of George and Nick when Tony disappears. With Sal's blessing, he interrogates Nick's family, and Joe kills Vincent in an altercation. Enraged by his father's murder, Nick attempts to see Sal, though he is stopped by Jerry, who explains that Sal will not see him. Jerry asks whether Nick killed Tony, and when he is met with silence, Jerry advises Nick to leave town immediately. Instead, Nick goes to see Ali and apologizes to her for killing her father. On orders from Sal, Jerry murders Ali, but Nick kills him before he can also be targeted. George insists that they together kill the entire crime family, but Nick rebukes him, and the two go their separate ways. Having lost his father, girlfriend, and best friend, Nick resolves to kill Sal. Sal is unsurprised to see Nick, and they talk as Nick holds a gun on him. Although Nick blames Sal for the events that have destroyed his life, Sal says that Nick has thrown away a promising career in the Mafia over his connections to friends and family that should not mean anything to him, as they are outside the Mafia. Sal shoots and kills Nick with a hidden pistol. As Sal waits for a clean up crew to dispose of Nick's body, Vito arrives and murders Sal. The film ends as Vito runs off.

The Late Eocene dinoceratan Gobiatherium major, and the pantodont Hypercoryphodon, of what is now Mongolia. The type genus Coryphodon is known from around the Paleocene- Eocene transition in Europe, western United States, northern Canada, and eastern Asia. The remaining genera are known exclusively from the middle Eocene of Asia. The coryphodontids are related to the pantolambdids. Coryphodon are large, derived pantodonts first described in the mid-19th century, but no intermediate stages leading to their unusual upper molars are known. The last known species of Coryphodon have bilophodont molars similar to later, more derived coryphodontids, and, most likely, Coryphodon is the primitive sister taxon to the remaining genera and the entire lineage (or lineages) originated from within this genus. Two coryphodontids considerably larger than Coryphodon but endemic to China, Asiocoryphodon and Heterocoryphodon, have more advanced bilophodont dentition. Metacoryphodon is morphologically transitional between Coryphodon and Eudinoceras. Corypohodontids were slow-growing and long-living animals, and studies of a large sample of individuals from a single locality, assumed to be from the same population, suggest that coryphodontids had a polygynous social structure in which males and females reached sexual maturity at different ages.

Well-off, in a loving marriage, and pregnant with the couple‚Äôs second child, Rumi begins to question her own right to happiness when her husband has been responsible for depriving another family of its loved one. She becomes emotionally alienated from Kingshuk when he refuses to accept culpability for Kabita‚Äôs death.

Relieved and wishing to reconcile, he calls Rumi, announcing that he has \\"bought the patient party\\". Rumi is devastated at Kingshuk‚Äôs callous attitude and the lack of justice for Kabita. Soon after receiving the call, she suffers a fall and has a miscarriage, which leads to severe abdominal haemorrhaging. The tables are turned and Kingshuk finds himself in the same position as Kabita's crazed husband as the medical team at the local hospital takes its time in attending to Rumi. Rumi survives.

Besides reinforcing the principle that a person can receive general damages for breaches of privacy for humiliation and injury of feelings, it set the precedent of increasing such an award from the then $7,500 to $10,000, and was prominent enough to be included on the Privacy Commission's June 2012 newsletter. Background The Lochead-MacMillan's house in Waiuku was insured with AMI Insurance. When their house later burnt down, they made an insurance claim with AMI. AMI in assessing the claim, got an investigator to interview the claimants. Two interviews were conducted, both of which were recorded by the investigator. On 4 February 2010, the claimants requested AMI for a copy of audio files and transcripts, which under the Privacy Act they had the legal right to obtain. Only the transcript for the second interview was provided on 22 February, which was incomplete, and the transcript for the first interview was only provided in June. With regards the request for the audio files, it was never acknowledged despite they were legally required to do so within 20 working days of the request. This request was never complied with by AMI, as at some stage the audio files were lost by them. On 2 March 2010, unaware that the audio files were lost, requested AMI again for the audio files, and 3 days later AMI informed them that their claim had now been accepted, although there was still a dispute of the amount that was to be paid by AMI. The claimants again requested the audio files from AMI on 13 April 2010. Concerned about the progress of their insurance claim, on 6 May 2010 they requested AMI to also provide a copy of the VFR fire investigation report. While in this instance they got a reply from AMI on 21 May, they refused to provide them with the report on the grounds of litigation privilege. Five days later, they claimants later accepted, under protest, a lesser amount than they had claimed. They did so without the benefit of having the investigators report on hand. However, after this matter was investigated by the Privacy Commission, AMI released the report to them on 3 November. The claimants then filed a claim with the Human Rights Review Tribunal. The Decision The Tribunal ruled that AMI breached the Lochead-MacMillan's privacy on numerous grounds, including not giving a written decision to access requests, not providing records within a reasonable time, and not informing them of their right to lodge a complaint with the Privacy Commission. Furthermore, the Tribunal ruled that AMI's claim of litigation privilege was not genuine, as when they said this, they had no reasonable contemplation of litigation on the matter. The Tribunal made a ruling for damages of $10,000 for the violation and the injury to Lochead- MacMillan's feelings.

He was born between 1354 and 1360.Mosley, ed.

Talbot accused Gormanston, Gerald FitzGerald, 5th Earl of Kildare and the Prior of the Order of Hospitallers at Kilmainham, Thomas Le Boteller, of a treasonable conspiracy. The Prior, who was a professional soldier, removed himself from the conflict by going to fight at the Siege of Rouen, but Kildare and Gormanston were imprisoned and subject to forfeiture of their lands. They were accused of dissolving Parliament without the Lord Lieutenant's consent, holding a purported Parliament without Royal authority, uttering threats against the Lord Lieutenant and Privy Council, and plotting to kill the Lord Lieutenant.Otway- Ruthven, A.J. History of Medieval Ireland Barnes and Noble reissue 1993 p.354-5 As regards the truth or falsehood of the more serious charges, Gormanston had undoubtedly acted in a high-handed manner by trying to dissolve Parliament, but Otway-Ruthven considers it unlikely that he was guilty of anything more than hostility to Talbot. This enmity may have been the first sign of the 30-year feud, which came to completely dominate Irish public life, between Talbot and James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormonde, who was the Prior's half-brother and Kildare's future son-in-law.Otway-Ruthven p.356 The evidence of treason against Gormanston consisted mainly of his possession of the King's Coronation Oath, and also of a controversial treatise, the Modus Tenendi Parliamentum, which had probably belonged to his father.Otway-Ruthven p.356 Although the treatise stresses the importance of Parliament's role in Government and (on an extreme view) could be taken as justifying the deposition of the King, Lord Gormanston's possession of it may simply indicate that he was interested in political reform. He was quickly cleared of the charges of treason, released and restored to his estates. In 1421 he was sent with a message from Parliament to King Henry V. He died the following year. Family He married Elizabeth de Londres, daughter and heiress of William de Londres, feudal baron of Naas. His son Christopher succeeded as Baron of Gormanston, Kells and Naas.Burke's Peerage p.1601 He also had at least one daughter, Elizabeth, who married Thomas Fleming, 2nd Baron Slane.Slane Peerage case References Category:Barons in the Peerage of Ireland Category:14th- century Irish politicians Category:1422 deaths Category:1350s births Category:15th-century Irish politicians ","title":"Christopher Preston, 2nd Baron Gormanston"},{"id":"40018619","text":"Arteris, Inc. is a multinational technology firm that develops the on-chip interconnect fabric technology used in System-on-Chip (SoC) semiconductor designs for a variety of devices, particularly in mobile and consumer markets. The company specializes in the development and distribution of Network-on-Chip (NoC) interconnect Intellectual Property (IP) solutions. It is best known for its flagship product, Arteris FlexNoC, which is used in more than 60 percent of mobile and wireless SoC designs. Arteris, Inc. is headquartered in Campbell, California. K. Charles Janac is the company‚Äôs President and CEO. In 2012, the Silicon Valley San Jose Business Journal ranked Arteris as the 4th fastest-growing private company in Silicon Valley. Arteris has also been in the Inc. 500 list of America‚Äôs fastest growing companies for two years running. History Arteris was founded in 2003 by Philippe Boucard and two other engineering executives who had worked together at T.Sqware, a startup that was acquired by Globespan. Company executives wished to address problems with existing monolithic bus and crossbar interconnect technologies, such as wire and routing congestion, increased heat and power consumption, failed timing closure, and increased die area. The firm‚Äôs leadership sought and received venture capital totaling $44.1 million for the creation of its new technology from investors, including ARM Holdings, Crescendo Ventures, DoCoMo Capital, Qualcomm, Synopsys, TVM Capital, and Ventech. By 2006, Arteris developed the first commercially available NoC IP product, called NoC Solution, followed in 2009 by a more advanced product, FlexNoC. The products used ‚Äúpacketization and a distributed network of small interconnect elements to address congestion, timing, power and performance issues.‚Äù Arteris marketed FlexNoC as an improvement on traditional SoCs interconnect fabrics, citing its reduction in gate count by 30 percent, reduction of wires by 50 percent, and a more compact chip floor as compared to a functionally equivalent hybrid bus or crossbar. Designers of SoCs began to take advantage of the technology‚Äôs increased design efficiency, flexibility, and a significant reduction in production costs. By 2012, the company had over 40 semiconductor customers, including Qualcomm, Samsung, Texas Instruments, Toshiba, and LG Electronics, with 200 million SoCs being produced with Arteris IP. The company‚Äôs volume is projected to grow to over 1 billion units per year by 2015. In October 2013, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. acquired the FlexNoC network-on-chip product portfolio, but Arteris retained existing customer contracts and to continue licensing FlexNoC and modifying the source code for customer support. Qualcomm will provide engineering deliverables for the FlexNoC product line and updates to Arteris. Qualcomm does not maintain any ownership interest in Arteris. In February 2014, Arteris named Craig Forrest as Chief Technology Officer, Dave Parry as Vice President of Engineering, and Benoit de Lescure as Director of Application Engineering. Licensees Arteris claims to have had 117 licensees for its interconnect IP product since its inception in 2003. There are approximately 65 active customers who are publicly disclosed. These licensees include top-20 semiconductor makers Samsung Electronics, Qualcomm, Toshiba Semiconductor, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics, Renesas Electronics, Freescale Semiconductor and Marvell Technology Group, as well as systems and automotive companies like Mobileye. Arteris has also signed licenses with Chinese semiconductor companies including Baidu, HiSilicon (Huawei), Actions Semiconductor, Allwinner, InfoTM, Ingenic, Leadcore, Nufront, RDA Semiconductor, Rockchip, Socle and Spreadtrum. Other publicly announced licensees of Arteris products include Altera (Intel), Core Logic, CSR, GCT, GUC, iC-Logic, LG, MegaChips, Movidius (Intel), MtekVision, NTT Electronics, Open-Silicon, Pixelworks, Renesas Electronics, Sckipio, Schneider, ST-Ericsson / Ericsson, and VIA Telecom. Products Arteris offers a number of Network-on-Chip products, including FlexNoC for high performance SoCs, the FlexLLI MIPI interchip link IP for connecting multiple chips and dies, and the FlexWay interconnect fabric for smaller SoCs. The firm‚Äôs technology is used in a variety of consumer electronics, including mobile phones and tablets, modems, gaming consoles, digital televisions, automotive systems, and other applications.

The car was originally entered with a 2-litre turbocharged Cosworth straight-four engine, but several other engines were used in the car's three-year career. Two cars are known to have been built. In conjunction with the LMP297, the car helped Waterair Sport to the International Sports Racing Series SR2 Team's Championship in 1998. The LMP296 was updated into the LMP299 for 2000. Design and development The LMP296's chassis was developed by Roger Rimmer, whilst its bodywork was designed by Didier Bonnet. It featured an aluminium honeycomb monocoque chassis, and its open-top bodywork was made from carbon fibre. When it was initially built, it featured a Ford Escort RS Cosworth-derived 2-litre turbocharged straight-four engine, race-prepared by Fochesato, and capable of a claimed maximum output of The engine's power was transmitted to the wheels via a 5-speed Hewland FGC transmission. The LMP296 used double-wishbone suspension developed by KONI, and its Michelin-shod 16\\" wheels were stopped by Alcon disc brakes, with 4-piston calipers. In 1998, various other engines were experimented with; a 3-litre Alfa Romeo V6 engine, 3- and 3.2-litre BMW straight-six engines, before the team finally settled on the 3-litre BMW unit after the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans. Racing history =LMP296= 1996 The Debora LMP296 was first entered in the 24 Hours of Le Mans pre-qualifying session in 1996 by Didier Bonnet Racing. Both LMP296 chassis were entered, but the LMP296-01 chassis did not arrive, and the LMP296-02 chassis, driven by Guillaume Gomez, was only able to finish in 56th position, and, as a result, was not allowed to participate in the main event. However, the LMP296-01 chassis, driven by Edouard Sezionale, Jean-Claude Basso and Thierry Lecerf, was allowed to compete, and qualified 52nd for the race. The car did not start the race, due to engine problems. The car made its first racing appearance in the 1996 Le Mans Autumn Cup, with its drivers Jacques Chevalier, Dominique Lacaud and Patrice Roussel finishing fifth overall, and second in the LMP2 class. 1997 Its next appearance came at the first ever International Sports Racing Series race in 1997, held at Donington Park, but the car, now classified as a SR1 car and driven by Didier Bonnet and Chevalier, retired after just six laps; the new Debora LMP297 car, which was classified in the SR2 category, also retired. The LMP296 was listed as a SR2 class car for second round at Zolder, but the car was crashed during the formation lap, and was unable to make the start. Neither Debora car competed at Brno, but both were present at the season finale, held at Jarama. Once again classified as a SR1 car, the LMP296, driven by Herv√© Regout and David Dussau, finished fourth overall, and third in class. 1998 For 1998, Didier Bonnet Racing ran the car, under the Waterair Sports banner, in the International Sports Racing Series. The car was fitted with an Alfa Romeo 3-litre V6, in place of the regular Cosworth turbo engine, for the season opener at Paul Ricard, but exhaust damage forced the car out of the race. Didier Bonnet Racing then ran the car under their own name in the pre-qualifying session for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and Lionel Robert managed to pre-qualify the car in 51st place, with the Alfa Romeo V6 being replaced by a BMW 3-litre straight-6. Robert, Sezionale and Pierre Bruneau were selected to drive the car in the race, with a slightly larger 3.2-litre BMW S50 engine fitted; the car completed 106 laps, before a gearbox failure forced the team to retire the car at around the ten- hour mark. Following this event, the car was refitted with the 3-litre BMW unit, and ran again as Waterair Sports, who entered the car in the third round of the International Sports Racing Series, held at Misano; Sezionale, Andr√© Cholley and Jean-Claude de Castelli finished eleventh overall, and took the SR2 class victory, by virtue of being the only car present in that category. The car won the SR2 class again in the following round, held at Donington Park, and finished fifth overall in the hands of de Castelli and Fran√ßois Jakubowski. The fifth round, held at Anderstorp, proved to be unsuccessful for the team; the LMP297, entered for the first time in 1998, failed to start, and the LMP296 retired after a spin on lap two. Waterair Sports then took a 1-2 in the SR2 category at the N√ºrburgring round, with the LMP296 taking the class victory, and finishing seventh overall. It would be the last time a LMP296 would finish a race in 1998, as the car retired from the Le Mans round, and failed to start the season finale at Kyalami. However, as the LMP297 won both races, Waterair Sports were crowned as the SR2 class Team's Champions for 1998, and finished joint twelfth overall. 1999 For 1999, the International Sports Racing Series became known as the Sports Racing World Cup, and Pierre Bruneau took ownership of the car, running it in his own team. Bruneau, partnered with Marc Rostan and Martin Henderson, finished ninth overall in the season opener at Barcelona, and took a class victory. The team's fortunes reversed at the following round, held at Monza, as they finished last overall and in class - eleventh and sixth respectively. Spa- Francorchamps also saw the team finish last overall and in class; although, this time, it was ninth overall, and second in class. This was followed by a retirement at Pergusa, and a stronger third (of six) in class (twelfth overall) at Donington Park. The car's last ever finish came at the Brno round; a seventh place overall, and a class victory, as all the other SR2 cars retired. The car retired from each of the remaining three events, and Bruneau's team finished runner-up to Cauduro Tampolli Team in the SR2 Team's Championship, and eleventh in the overall Team's Championship. =LMP297= 1997 The Debora LMP297 was first entered in the 24 Hours of Le Mans pre-qualifying session in 1997 as a LMP650 class car by Didier Bonnet Racing; however, the car, which was fitted with the 2-litre Cosworth turbo engine for the event, finished 46th, which meant that it failed to pre-qualify, and as a result, was not allowed to compete in the race. The car made its International Sports Racing Series debut at the season opener at Donington Park, with Glenn Dudley and Paul Cope driving a 3-litre BMW straight-6 engined LMP297, but the car, which had been once more entered by Didier Bonnet Racing, retired from the race after 22 laps. The car, this time driven by David Dussau and Bernard de Dryver, also retired from the following round at Zolder after 39 laps, following an accident. The car finished for the first time in the season finale at Jarama, with its drivers Patrice Roussel and Bruno Boccard taking fifth place overall, and second in class. 1998 For 1998, Didier Bonnet Racing ran the car under the Waterair Sports banner. The team first entered the car at the fifth round of the season, held at Anderstorp, but the car did not start the race. The next round, held at the N√ºrburgring, saw the car, driven by Andr√© Cholley and David Dussau, finish tenth overall, and second in class. Cholley and Pierre Bruneau followed this with class victories at Le Mans and at Kyalami, on both occasions being the only SR2 car to finish the race. As a result of the points scored with both the LMP296 and the LMP297, Waterair Sports became the SR2 class champions for the 1998 season, and finished joint twelfth overall. This would prove to be the car's last race, as, although it was entered by Debora in the Sports Racing World Cup (which the International Sports Racing Series had been renamed to) in 1999 for the Donington Park round, the car did not arrive, and was not used again. =LMP299= 2000 The Debora LMP299 made its debut at the opening round of the 2000 Sports Racing World Cup season (SRWC), held at Barcelona. The car was fitted with a 3-litre BMW straight-six engine, allowing it to be classified in the \\"SRL\\" category. Pierre Bruneau and Marc Rostan drove the car for Bruneau's PiR Bruneau team, and finished second in the SRL class, eleventh overall. An ignition problem forced the pair to retire from the 500 km Monza after 56 laps, before the team took sixth overall at Spa-Francorchamps, and third in the SRL category. Although the team entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and fitted the car with a 3.2-litre BMW straight-six, they were not invited to compete. The team then entered the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring, part of the American Le Mans Series (ALMS); the car was refitted with the 3-litre BMW straight-six, and was classified as a LMP car. The team finished fourteenth overall, tenth of the LMPs, and third in the LMP675 subclass. The team then returned to the SRWC for the Brno round, with Bruneau being partnered by Robert Pergl and Dominique Lacaud; a broken axle forced them out after three laps. Bruneau was partnered by Rostan and Piers Johnson at Donington Park, but the team retired again; this time due to gearbox failure after 69 laps. Rostan and Bruneau were the two drivers for the penultimate round of the season, held at the N√ºrburgring; the team finished 17th overall, and sixth in the SRL class. At the final race of the season, held at Magny-Cours, Bruneau and Rostan were joined by Ludovico Manfredi, and the trio took twelfth place overall, and sixth in the SRL category. At the end of the season, PiR Bruneau were classified sixth in the WSRP SRL Team's Championship, with 39 points, whilst Bruneau and Rostan were classified joint ninth in the SRL Driver's Championship. Their single race in the ALMS was enough for them to finish 16th in the ALMS LMP Team's Championship, with 15 points. 2001 In 2001, PiR Bruneau remained in the Sports Racing World Series, which had now been renamed to the FIA Sportscar Championship. The team retained their LMP299, which was now classified as a \\"SR2\\" car, and hired Arturo Merzario to partnered Bruneau and Rostan for the opening round, held at Barcelona. The team took eleventh place overall in that race, and seventh in the SR2 class. At the next round, which was the 1000 km of Monza, the team were forced to retire due to accident damage after 81 laps. The team were classified 13th at Spa-Francorchamps, and seventh in class, but retired after 55 laps. The team suffered more problems at the following round, held at Brno; they finished the race, but were classified fourteenth overall and last (seventh in class), having completed 47 laps - this was 19 less than the car ahead. For Magny-Cours, Merzario was replaced by Manfredi, but the team retired again; this time, a gearbox failure after 27 laps was to blame. Donington Park would prove to be more successful; the team finished eleventh overall, and fourth in the SR2 class. Rostan was partnered by Arnie Black for the penultimate round of the season, held at Mondello Park; the team finished last again, although this time that equated to tenth overall, and fourth in the SR2 class. Bruneau returned to partner Rostan in the final race of the season, held at N√ºrburgring; the team finished ninth overall, and seventh in the SR2 class. The team were again classified sixth in their class in the Team's Championship, whilst Rostan was the highest classified driver, taking tenth with 38 points. 2002 In 2002, PiR Bruneau expanded to a two-car operation; they purchased a Pilbeam MP84, and ran it alongside the Debora LMP299; the latter car had been refitted with a 3-litre Nissan V6 engine. Philippe Hottinguer and Paul Daniels were selected to drive the LMP299 in the opening round at Barcelona, but retired due to a drive shaft issue after 35 laps. At Estoril, Pedro Couceiro and Manuel Gi√£o drove the LMP299, and finished eleventh and last overall, sixth in the SR2 class. Bruneau partnered Daniels at Brno, but the pair did not start the race due to engine problems. At Magny-Cours, Hottinger returned to partner Daniels; however, the engine failed again, forcing the team to retire after 61 laps. For Dijon-Prenois, Daniels drove alongside Rob Croydon; this time, the team were able to finish the race, but finished ninth and last - sixth in the SR2 class. At Spa, Fr√©d√©ric Bouvy, Christophe Geoffroy and David Sterckx were selected to drive the LMP299, but crashed out of the race after 22 laps. This was the last time the car was entered in a race.

Stereopsis recovery, also recovery from stereoblindness, is the phenomenon of a stereoblind person gaining partial or full ability of stereo vision (stereopsis). Recovering stereo vision as far as possible has long been established as an approach to the therapeutic treatment of stereoblind patients. Treatment aims to recover stereo vision in very young children, as well as in patients who had acquired but lost their ability for stereopsis due to a medical condition. In contrast, this aim has normally not been present in the treatment of those who missed out on learning stereopsis during their first few years of life. In fact, the acquisition of binocular and stereo vision was long thought to be impossible unless the person acquired this skill during a critical period in infancy and early childhood.See for example: This hypothesis normally went unquestioned and has formed the basis for the therapeutic approaches to binocular disorders for decades. It has been put in doubt in recent years. In particular since studies on stereopsis recovery began to appear in scientific journals and it became publicly known that neuroscientist Susan R. Barry achieved stereopsis well into adulthood, that assumption is in retrospect considered to have held the status of a scientific dogma.\\"[‚Ä¶] The book's main contribution, however, is exposing the wrong-headed dogma that acuity and binocular vision can be restored only during a critical developmental period.\\" ‚ÄîNew England Journal of Medicine. (See introductory pages of: Susan R. Barry (2009) Fixing My Gaze.)\\"[‚Ä¶] Part memoir and part science, Fixing My Gaze is a fitting tribute to the determination of a patient and her optometrist in challenging conventional wisdom and dogma.\\" ‚ÄîJournal of Behavioral Optometry. (See introductory pages of: Susan R. Barry (2009) Fixing My Gaze.) Very recently, there has been a rise in scientific investigations into stereopsis recovery in adults and youths who have had no stereo vision before. While it has now been shown that an adult may gain stereopsis, it is currently not yet possible to predict how likely a stereoblind person is to do so, nor is there general agreement on the best therapeutic procedure. Also the possible implications for the treatment of children with infantile esotropia are still under study.  Clinical management of strabismus and stereoblindness  In cases of acquired strabismus with double vision (diplopia), it is long-established state of the art to aim at curing the double vision and at the same time recovering a patient's earlier ability for stereo vision. For example, a patient may have had full stereo vision but later had diplopia due to a medical condition, losing stereo vision. In this case, medical interventions, including vision therapy and strabismus surgery, may remove the double vision and recover the stereo vision which had temporarily been absent in the patient. Also when children with congenital (infantile) strabismus (e.g. infantile esotropia) receive strabismus surgery within the first few years or two of their life, this goes along with the hope that they may yet develop their full potential for binocular vision including stereopsis. In contrast, in a case where a child's eyes are straightened surgically after the age of about five or six years and the child had no opportunity to develop stereo vision in early childhood, normally the clinical expectation is that this intervention will lead to cosmetic improvements but not to stereo vision. Conventionally, no follow-up for stereopsis was performed in such cases. For instance, one author summarized the accepted scientific view of the time with the words: \\"Stereopsis will never be obtained unless amblyopia is treated, the eyes are aligned, and binocular fusion and function are achieved before the critical period for stereopsis ends. Clinical data suggest that this occurs before 24 months of age,[‚Ä¶] but we do not know exactly when it occurs, because crucial pieces of basic science information are missing.\\" For purposes of illustration, reference is made to a book of doctors' handouts for patients, written for the general public and published in 2002, which summarizes the limitations in the terms in which they, at the time, were fully accepted as medical state of the art as follows: \\"If an adult has a childhood strabismus that was never treated, it is too late to improve any amblyopia or depth perception, so the goal may be simply cosmetic ‚Äì to make the eyes appear to be properly aligned ‚Äì though sometimes treatment does enlarge the extent of side vision.\\"Melvin L. Rubin, Lawrence A. Winograd: Taking Care of Your Eyes: A Collection of the Patient Information Handouts Used by America's Leading Eye Doctors, Triad Records (September 2002), It has only been accepted very recently that the therapeutic approach was based on an unquestioned notion that has, since, been referred to as \\"myth\\" or \\"dogma\\". Recently, however, stereopsis recovery is known to have occurred in a number of adults. While this has in some cases occurred after visual exercises or spontaneous visual experiences, recently also the medical community's view of strabismus surgery has become more optimistic with regard to outcomes in terms of binocular function and possibly stereopsis. As one author states: :\\"The majority of adults will experience some improvement in binocular function after strabismus surgery even if the strabismus has been longstanding. Most commonly this takes the form of an expansion of binocular visual fields; however, some patients may also regain stereopsis.\\" Scientific investigations on residual neural plasticity in adulthood now also include studies on the recovery of stereopsis. Now it is a matter of active scientific investigation under which conditions and to which degree binocular fusion and stereo vision can be acquired in adulthood, especially if the person is not known to have had any preceding experience of stereo vision, and how outcomes may depend on the patient's history of therapeutic interventions.  Examples and case studies  Oliver Sacks was the first to make the story of Susan Barry, whom he nicknamed \\"Stereo Sue\\", known to the general public. Stereopsis recovery has been reported to have occurred in a few adults as a result of either medical treatments including strabismus surgery and vision therapy, or spontaneously after a stereoscopic 3D cinema experience. = Personal reports in Fixing my Gaze = The most renowned case of regained stereopsis is that of neuroscientist Susan R. Barry, who had had alternating infantile esotropia with diplopia, but no amblyopia, underwent three surgical corrections in childhood without achieving binocular vision at the time, and recovered from stereoblindness in adult age after vision therapy with optometrist Theresa Ruggiero. Barry's case has been reported on by neurologist Oliver Sacks. Also David H. Hubel, winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Torsten Wiesel for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system, commented positively on her case.. In 2009, Barry published a book Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions, reporting on her own and several other cases of stereopsis recovery. In her book Fixing my Gaze, Susan Barry gives a detailed description of her surprise, elation and subsequent experiences when her stereo vision suddenly set in. Hubel wrote of her book: Her book includes reports of further persons who have had similar experiences with stereopsis recovery. Barry cites the personal experiences of several persons, including a man who was an artist and described his experience of seeing with stereopsis as \\"that he could see one hundred more times negative space\\",. a woman who had been amblyopic before seeing in 3D described how empty space now \\"looks and feels palpable, tangible‚Äîalive!\\",. a woman who had been strabismic since age two and saw in 3D after taking vision therapy and stated that \\"The coolest thing is the feeling you get being ‚Äúin the dimension‚Äù\\",. a woman who felt quite alarmed at the experience of suddenly seeing roadside trees and signs looming towards her,. and two women who experienced an abrupt onset of stereo vision with a wide- angled view of the world, the first stating: \\"I was able to take in so much more of the room than I did before\\" and the second: \\"It was very dramatic as my peripheral vision suddenly filled in on both sides\\".. Common to Barry and at least one person on whom she had reported is the finding that also their mental representation of space changed after having acquired stereo vision: that even with one eye closed the feeling is to see \\"more\\" than seeing with one eye closed before recovering stereopsis. Although stereoblind, Bridgeman used polarized glasses in a 3D cinema and could suddenly see in 3D. = Further cases in the media = Apart from Barry, another formerly stereoblind adult whose acquired ability for stereopsis has received media attention is neuroscientist Bruce Bridgeman, professor of psychology and psychobiology at University of California Santa Cruz, who had grown up nearly stereoblind and acquired stereo vision spontaneously in 2012 at the age of 67, when watching the 3D movie Hugo with polarizing 3D glasses. The scene suddenly appeared to him in depth, and the ability to see the world in stereo stayed with him also after leaving the cinema.Morgen Peck: How a movie changed one man‚Äôs vision forever, BBC Future, 19 July 2012Barry B. Sandrew: Reflections on the Growth of 3D, 19 March 2012 (downloaded 20 July 2013) = Other first person accounts = Michael Thomas has described the experience of instantaneous onset of three dimensional vision at the age of 69 in a Public Facebook post.  Recent scientific investigations  There is a growing recent body of scientific literature on investigations into the recovery of stereopsis in adults which started to appear shortly before Oliver Sacks' The New Yorker publication drew public attention to Barry's discovery. A number of scientific publications have systematically assessed patients' post-surgical stereopsis, (abstract, full text) whereas other studies have investigated the effects of eye training procedures. (full text) Article 53 = Post-surgical stereopsis = Certain conditions are known to be a prerequisite for stereo vision, for instance, that the amount of horizontal deviation, if any is present, needs to be small. In several studies it has been recognized that surgery to correct strabismus can have the effect of improving binocular function. One of these studies, published in 2003, explicitly concluded: \\"We found that improvement in binocularity, including stereopsis, can be obtained in a substantial portion of adults.\\" That article was published together with a discussion of the results among peers in which the scientific and social implications of the medical treatment were addressed, for example concerning the long-term relevancy of stereopsis, the importance of avoiding diplopia, the necessity of predictable outcomes, and psychosocial and socioeconomic relevance. Among the investigations into post-surgical stereopsis is a publication of 2005 that reported on a total of 43 adults over 18 years of age who had surgical correction after having lived with from constant-horizontal strabismus for more than 10 years with no previous surgery or stereopsis, with visual acuity of 20/40 or more also in the deviating eye; in this group, stereopsis was present in 80% of exotropes and 31% of esotropes, with the recovery of stereopsis and stereoacuity being uncorrelated to the number of years the deviation had persisted. A study that was published 2006 included, aside an extensive review of investigations on stereopsis recovery of the last decades, a re-evaluation of all those patients who had had congenital or early-onset strabismus with a large constant horizontal divergence and had undergone strabismus surgery in the years 1997‚Äì1999 in a given clinic, excluding those who had a history of neurologic or systemic diseases or with organic retinal diseases. Among the resulting 36 subjects aged 6‚Äì30 years, many had regained binocular vision (56% according to an evaluation with Bagolini striated glasses, 39% with Titmus test, 33% with Worth 4-dot test, and 22% with Random dot E test) and 57% had stereoacuity of 200 sec of arc of better, leading to the conclusion that some degrees of stereopsis can be achieved even in cases of infantile or early-childhood strabism. Another study found that some chronically strabismic adults with good vision could recover fusion and stereopsis by means of surgical alignment. In contrast, in a study in which a group of 17 adults and older children of at least 8 years of age, all of whom received strabismus surgery and post-operative evaluation after long-standing untreated infantile esotropia, most showed binocular fusion when tested with Bagolini lenses and an increased visual field, but none demonstrated stereo fusion or stereopsis. Stereoacuity is limited by the visual acuity of the eyes, and in particular by the visual acuity of the weaker eye. That is, the more a patient's vision of any one of the two eyes is degraded compared to the 20/20 vision standard, the lower are the prospects of improving or re-gaining stereo vision, unless visual acuity itself were improved by other means. Strabismus surgery itself does not improve visual acuity. = Stereopsis following training procedures = Orthoptic exercises have proven to be effective for reducing symptoms in patients with convergence insufficiency and decompensating exophoria by improving the near-point convergence of the eyes that is necessary for binocular fusion. Experiments on monkeys, published 2007, revealed improvements in stereoacuity in monkeys who, after having been raised with binocular deprivation through prisms for the first two years, were exposed to extensive psychophysical training. Their stereo vision recovered in part, but remained far more limited than that of normally raised monkeys. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley have stated that perceptual learning appears to play an important role. One investigation, published 2011, reported on a study on human stereopsis recovery using perceptual learning which was inspired by Barry's work. In this study, a small number of stereoblind subjects who had initially been stereoblind or stereoanomalous recovered stereopsis using perceptual learning exercises. Alongside the scientific assessment of the extent of recovery, also the subjective outcomes are described: \\"After achieving stereopsis, our observers reported that the depth ‚Äúpopped out,‚Äù which they found very helpful and joyful in their everyday life. The anisometropic observer GD noticed ‚Äúa surge in depth‚Äù one day when shopping in a supermarket. While playing table tennis, she feels that she is able to track a ping-pong ball more accurately and therefore can play better. Strabismic observer AB is more confident now when walking down stairs because she can judge the depth of the steps better. Strabismics AB, DP, and LR, are able to enjoy 3D movies for the first time, and strabismic GJ finds it easier to catch a fly ball while playing baseball.\\" In a follow-up study, the authors of this study pointed out that the stereopsis that was recovered following perceptual learning was more limited in resolution and precision compared to normal subjects' stereopsis.

A modified version of the game (not shown here) has been used for dichoptic training. There have been several attempts to make use of modern technology for enhanced binocular eye training, in particular for treating amblyopia and interocular suppression. In some cases these modern techniques have improved patients' stereoacuity. Very early technology-enhanced vision therapy efforts have included the cheiroscope, which is a haploscope in which left- and or right- eye images can be blended into view over a drawing pad, and the subject may be given a task such as to reproduce a line image presented to one eye. However, historically these approaches were not developed much further and they were not put to widespread use. Recent systems are based on dichoptic presentation of the elements of a video game or virtual reality such that each eye receives different signals of the virtual world that the player's brain must combine in order to play successfully. One of the earliest systems of this kind has been proposed by a research group in the University of Nottingham with the aim of treating amblyopia, using virtual reality masksPatent WO2003092482 A1 Ocular display apparatus for assessment and measurement of and for treatment of ocular disorders, and methods therefor, priority date 4 May 2002, publication date 13 November 2003, Isabel Ash et al. or commercially available 3D shutter glasses. The group also has worked to develop perceptual learning training protocols that specifically target the deficit in stereo acuity to allow the recovery of normal stereo function even in adulthood. Another system of dichoptic presentation for binocular vision therapy has been proposed by researchers of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre.Patent WO 2009053917 A1 Binocular vision assessment and/or therapy, priority date 23 October 2007, publication date 30 April 2009, Robert F. Hess et al. Using a modified puzzle video game Tetris, the interocular suppression of patients with amblyopia was successfully treated with dichotomic training in which certain parameters of the training material were systematically adapted during the course of four weeks. Clinical supervision of such procedures is required to ensure that double vision does not occur. Most of the patients who underwent this treatment gained improved visual acuity of the weaker eye, and some also showed increased stereoacuity. (with video clip explaining the procedure) Another study performed at the same institute showed that dichoptic training can be more effective in adults than the more conventional amblyopia treatment of an eye patch. For this investigation, 18 adults played the game Tetris for one hour each day, half of the group wearing eye patches and the other half playing a dichoptic version of the game. After two weeks, the group who played dichoptically showed a significant improvement of vision in the weaker eye and in stereopsis acuity; the eye patch group had moderate improvements, which increased substantially after they, too, were given the dichoptic training afterwards.Review of the Li et al (2013) article in: Dichoptic-based perceptual learning therapy, presented by means of a head-mounted display, is amenable also to amblyopic children, as it improves both the amblyopic eye's visual acuity and the stereo function. The researchers at McGill University have shown that one to three weeks of playing a dichoptic video game for one to two hours on a hand-held device \\"can improve acuity and restore binocular function, including stereopsis in adults\\". Furthermore, it has been suggested that these effect can be enhanced by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Together with Levi of the University of California, Berkeley, scientists at the University of Rochester have made further developments in terms of virtual reality computer gamesPatent US20120179076 A1 Method and system for treating amblyopia, priority date 16 September 2010, filing date 16 September 2011, publication date 12 July 2012, Daphne Bavelier et al. which have shown some promise in improving both monocular and binocular vision in human subjects. Game developer James Blaha, who developed his own crowd-funded version of a dichoptic VR game for the Oculus Rift together with Manish Gupta and is continuing to experiment with the game, experienced steropsis for the first time using his game.Reverend VR Podcast with James Rift In 2011, two cases of adults with anisometropic amblyopia were reported whose visual acuity and stereoacuity improved due to learning-based therapies. Cited in: There are indications that the suppression of binocularity in amblyopic subjects is due to a suppression mechanism that prevents the amblyopic brain from learning to see. It has been suggested that desuppression and neuroplasticity may be favored by specific conditions that are commonly associated with perceptual learning tasks and video game playing such as a heightened requirement of attention, a prospect of reward, a feeling of enjoyment and a sense of flow.  Health care policy matters  Prism lenses (here unusually thick) are used for pre-operative prism adaptation. Health insurances always review therapies in terms of clinical effectiveness in view of existing scientific literature, benefit, risk and cost. Even if individual cases of recovery exist, a treatment is only considered effective under this point of view if there is sufficient likelihood that it will predictably improve outcomes. In this context, medical coverage policy of the global health services organization Cigna \\"does not cover vision therapy, optometric training, eye exercises or orthoptics because they are considered experimental, investigational or unproven for any indication including the management of visual disorders and learning disabilities\\" based on a bibliographic review published by Cigna which concludes that \\"insufficient evidence exists in the published, peer- reviewed literature to conclude that vision therapy is effective for the treatment of any of the strabismic disorders except preoperative prism adaptation for acquired esotropia\\".Cigna Medical Coverage Policy, Coverage policy number 0221, effective 15 November 2012, for review 15 November 2013 (downloaded 20 July 2013) Similarly, the U.S. managed health care company Aetna offers vision therapy only in contracts with supplemental coverage and limits its prescriptions to a number of conditions that are explicitly specified in a list of vision disorders.Clinical policy bulletins: Vision therapy, Number 0489, 4 June 2013, for review 13 June 2013 (downloaded 21 July 2013)  See also  * Recovery from blindness  References  Category:Neurophysiology Category:Neuroscience Category:Ophthalmology Category:Stereoscopy Category:Visual perception Category:Visual system ","title":"Stereopsis recovery"},{"id":"40018675","text":"That's All may refer to: Songs * \\"That's All\\" (1938 song), a 1938 song by Sister Rosetta Tharpe * \\"That's All\\" (Merle Travis song), a 1946 song by Merle Travis * \\"That's All\\" (1952 song), a 1952 song written by Alan Brandt and Bob Haymes * \\"That's All\\" (Genesis song), a 1983 song by English rock band Genesis Albums * That's All (Bobby Darin album), 1959 * That's All (Mel Torm√© album), 1965 * That's All!, a 1967 album by Sammy Davis Jr. * That's All, a 1968 album by British vocal duo Twice as Much * That's All (Tete Montoliu album), 1985 ","title":"That's All"},{"id":"40018687","text":"Edgewood is a historic home located at Stanleytown, Henry County, Virginia.

Original text In his Summa Theologiae, begun in 1265 circa 50 years after St. Dominic founded the Dominican Order, St. Thomas Aquinas wrote that \\"Vita contemplativa simpliciter est melior quam activa quae occupatur circa corporales actus, sed vita activa secundum quam aliquis praedicando et docendo contemplata aliis tradit, est perfectior quam vita quae solum contemplatur, quia talis vita praesupponit abundantiam contemplationis. Et ideo Christus talem vitam elegit\\" (Summa Theologiae, III, Q. 40, A. 1, Ad 2). A translation is: \\"the contemplative life is, absolutely speaking, more perfect than the active life, because the latter is taken up with bodily actions: yet that form of active life in which a man, by preaching and teaching, delivers to others the fruits of his contemplation, is more perfect than the life that stops at contemplation, because such a life is built on an abundance of contemplation, and consequently such was the life chosen by Christ.\\" The literal expression comes from his treatment of the contemplative and active lives in the Second Part of the Summa Theologiae, where he states that, \\"just as it is better to enlighten than merely to shine, so is it better to give to others the fruits of one's contemplation (contemplata aliis tradere) than merely to contemplate (contemplari).\\" (Summa Theologiae, II-II Q. 188, A. 6) Dominican spirituality The phrase came to express the essence of the vocation and spirituality of the Dominicans, and is a principal motto of the Order. Since the foundation of the Order in 1216 by Saint Dominic and under his direct inspiration, the Dominicans dedicated themselves to the meditation and study of Sacred Scripture while having the explicit objective of serving in apostolic ministry, which for them is the fruit of their contemplative life.

It is a redundant church under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. When it was in active use, the church was an Anglican parish church in the deanery of Telford Severn Gorge, the archdeaconry of Ludlow, and the diocese of Hereford. Its benefice has been united with those of All Saints, Broseley, St Bartholomew, Benthall, St Giles, Barrow, and St Mary, Jackfield. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History St Leonard's originated as a chapel of ease to Holy Trinity, Much Wenlock in the 12th century, with the tower built later in the century. During the 19th century (before 1855) a pyramidal tower was added to the tower. The church was restored in 1858 by Arthur Blomfield, during which the nave windows were enlarged, the east wall was rebuilt and a new triple window inserted, new benches were installed, the floor was tiled, and a piscina was added in the sanctuary. The church was declared redundant on 24 September 2007, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 15 July 2013. Architecture =Exterior= The church is almost completely Norman in style. It is constructed in sandstone with tiled roofs. The plan consists of a nave, a narrower and lower chancel, and a west tower. The tower is in two stages on a plinth, with pilaster buttresses supporting the lower stage. In the bottom stage is a straight-headed west window, and small round-headed windows on the north and south sides. The upper stage contains double bell openings. These are set in recessed twin arches, and above them is a corbel table. On the summit is a pyramidal roof with a weathervane. In the nave is a Norman south doorway with simple imposts and a tympanum decorated with zigzag bands. The blocked north doorway, also Norman, has a tympanum carved with a Green Man, a figure with its legs apart and foliage extending from its mouth. The windows in the nave are straight-headed. The windows in the north and south walls of the chancel are small and Norman. In the east wall of the chancel are three round-headed windows dating from the 19th-century restoration. =Interior= Inside the church the walls are plastered. The tower arch has semicircular responds, and capitals decorated with volutes and beaded ornamental bands. The chancel arch is plainer, with simple imposts. Between the east windows are arches with scalloped capitals. In the south wall of the sanctuary is a piscina. The Norman font consists of a round tub, decorated around the rim with cable moulding. The exterior of the tub is carved with medallions, some of which are surrounded by bands originating from the mouths of demons, in the style of Green Men. The wooden pulpit is polygonal in shape. On the east walls of the nave are metal commandment boards. The reredos, dating from about 1870, was designed by Harry Burrows; it is a triptych containing a cross and angels, and is painted on board. Also in the church is a hatchment dated 1803, and in the blocked north doorway is the grave slab of two Roman Catholic monks who died, respectively, in 1779 and 1803. The stained glass in the east windows, dated 1862, depicts the Resurrection, and was designed by William Warrington.

Early career Juan N√∫√±ez de Prado was born in Badajoz, in the Extremadura region of Spain. He moved to Peru in the early 1540s, and became a supporter of Gonzalo Pizarro, taking part on his side in the civil wars. Before 1548 he had been appointed Alcade of the Potos√≠ mines. While holding this office, he went over to the royal forces before the Battle of Jaquijahuana and assisted in the victory over Pizarro's supporters. At the end of the civil war Captain N√∫√±ez de Prado returned to the city of Chuquisaca in Upper Peru. Since the royal forces had triumphed at Jaquijahuana, in 1549 Pedro de la Gasca granted Juan N√∫√±ez de Prado the territory of Tucum√°n in modern Argentina in return for his valuable services. This was a poorly defined area that roughly corresponded to the southern part of modern Bolivia and the northern part of modern Argentina. After receiving La Gasca's instructions for his mission, N√∫√±ez de Prado raised money from his property and from some of his friends. He prepared to leave with a force of 84 volunteers. Conquest of Tucum√°n N√∫√±ez de Prado travelled through the valleys of Tupiza, Jujuy and Chicoana to reach his new territory and to find a site for its capital. He chose a location on the banks of the Dulce River and founded the city of El Barco. It was named in honor of La Gasca, who was born in El Barco de √Åvila in Spain. He built a fort, and brought settlers from Upper Peru. Prado seems to have wanted to use peaceful methods to civilize the Indians. The territory was occupied by the Calchaqu√≠ people. He found that they were not inclined to resist. Prado named his province Tucuman after Tucumamahao, one of the leaders of the local people who formed an alliance with him. According to Funes, the original settlement of Ciudad del Barco was destroyed in 1552 when the Dulce River overflowed. Some of Prado's followers attacked a group of soldiers of Francisco de Villagra who were travelling to Chile. N√∫√±ez de Prado considered that he was within the jurisdiction of Peru since the governor of Peru had awarded him the province. Pedro de Valdivia, the governor of Chile, disagreed and claimed the territory for Chile. In a letter to the Emperor, Valdivia claimed that Prado had abandoned Barco and returned to Peru, although this was not true. Valdivia gave Captain Francisco de Aguirre the task of taking Tucuman for Chile. Aguirre left on 8 November 1552 and reached El Barco in December. Prado was away from the settlement when Aguirre arrived, but on his return was arrested and sent under guard to Chile. Some of Prado's men were sent to Lima, and Aguirre established Chilean authority in the new territory. Aguirre initiated a vigorous and aggressive policy towards the Indians, allocating them to his followers as forced laborers to work on their landholdings. The result was a rebellion. The colonists were greatly outnumbered, and in 1553 had to retreat beyond the Dulce River to a location a few leagues away, where they founded Santiago del Estero. In 1554 Aguirre returned to Chile in hope of being made governor in place of Valdivia, who had died. Many of the colonists took advantage of his absence to abandon the settlement and return to Chile or Peru. Illegalities and usurpations During the American conquest, there were several instances of abuse among the conquerors. For lack of clear boundaries or natural limits to their concessions, or deliberately, some conquistadors found cities in neighboring territories, or took possession of wealth that was not in the territory assigned to them. These arbitrary or unintentional interferences caused endless confrontation and lawsuits, which were not always resolved satisfactorily for both sides. In the case of El Barco, Valdivia, with the voluntarily help of Francisco de Aguirre, meant to arbitrarily extend his Chilean jurisdiction to the southeast of his assigned territory. As the jurisdiction of Tucum√°n then belonged to Peru, the Royal Audience of Lima captured Francisco de Aguirre and imprisoned him for abuse, demanding the release and reinstatement of N√∫√±ez de Prado. However, he died before he was able to return.

Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was an Ilyushin Il-18B registered CCCP-75687 to the Azerbaijan division of Aeroflot. Built in 1959, by the time of the accident the aircraft had sustained 21,663 flight hours and 11,787 pressurization cycles. Initially the cabin layout was designed to seat 80 passengers but later seats were rearranged to seat an additional nine passengers.  Crew  Left to right: Radio operator Dmitry Markin, first officer Yuri Filin, Captain Viktor Loginov, flight engineer Valentin Pershin, and navigator Viktor Filatov; photo taken at Bina Airport in 1972.Eight crew members were aboard the flight. The cockpit crew consisted of: * Captain ‚Äì Viktor Sergeyevich Loginov * Co-pilot ‚Äì Yuri Aleksandrovich Filin * Flight engineer ‚Äì Valentin Nikolayevich Pershin * Navigator ‚Äì Viktor Mikhaylovich Filatov * Radio operator ‚Äì Dmitry Korneyevich Markin  Synopsis  The flight departed from Tashkent Airport on the May 10 at 23:25 Moscow time (01:25 May 11 local time) with 63 people on board, including three children. The aircraft leveled at a cruising altitude of 7800 meters after takeoff until they were instructed by the Almaty Airport region controller at 00:56 MSK to increase altitude to a flight level of 9000 meters and fly on a bearing of 43¬∞; the flight crew confirmed receiving the instruction and proceeded to ascend as directed. At 01:12 MSK the flight briefly contacted the Ayaguz airport controller and again at 01:22 to inform him they were about to depart the Ayaguz sector and head over to Semipalatinsk. After contacting the Semipalatinsk controller the proceeded to decrease altitude to 7800 meters by initiating a 360¬∞ left turn; the aircraft was last seen on radar 110 km from Semipalatinsk but had been in flight 90 km from the airport, not detected by radar. The Semipalatinsk controller attempted to make contact with the plane when it was due to be overhead at 01:52 MSK (04:52 local time) but received no response from the flight. At the time the weather consisted of clouds at altitudes of 1000‚Äì1300 meters, mild wind and rain, with visibility at 10 kilometers. At the time the Il-18 was flying on autopilot when within the span of six seconds the instrument speed decreased from 400 to 370 km/h while at its assigned altitude before entering a rapid decline with no lateral roll, reaching overloads ranging from 1.5 to -0.8g. 17 seconds later the plane entered a right bank with an angular velocity of more than 100¬∞ per second, causing overloads that resulted in the loss of the right wing at an altitude of 5000 meters while at a speed of 670 km/h and the breakup of the fuselage at an altitude of 3600 meters at a speed of 700 km/h, well above the maximum safe speed of an Il-18 (675 km/h). At 04:37 local time (01:37 Moscow time), 38 seconds after the start of the decline, the remains of the aircraft crashed into the steppe 84 kilometers south of Semipalatinsk. Investigators were able to reach the wreckage and view the burning debris by 04:50 local time, but all 63 people on the flight perished in the crash.  Conclusions  Two local military units questioned by investigators reported that they had not fired any projectiles into the air around the time of the crash nor were there any air force aircraft in operation that could have collided with the flight. Investigators felt that the first altitude and speed of the 20‚Äì30 seconds of reduced altitude correlated with a controlled emergency reduction in altitude, followed by an unexplainable loss of control that led to an overspeed situation. Investigators thought that one of the reasons possible would have been a crew member unintentionally losing control of an elevator during an emergency descent, but it could not be conclusively confirmed. At the time of the rapid decline that led up to the accident, the propellers were feathered, but it is unknown if the crew had done so or if the autopilot had done so. Two round puncture holes in the fuselage of the rear luggage compartment; investigators had the portion of the compartment recovered and sent for analysis to see if an artillery shell could have caused the damage, but analysis concluded that the holes resulted from the crash itself with a lack of explosive residues present. Despite the recovery of the flight data recorders and most of the wreckage, the commission was not able to pinpoint an exact cause of the crash, in part due to the amount of damage sustained by the flight data recorders limiting the amount of information that could be recovered.

All 67 people aboard were killed in the accident.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was an Ilyushin Il-18V registered CCCP-75866 to Aeroflot. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had sustained only 154 flight hours and 68 pressurization cycles because it had been released from the factory just in March that same year.  Description of accident  Flight 25 departed from Moscow-Sheremetyevo at 03:12 local time and held an altitude of 6000 meters after takeoff. 59 passengers and 8 crew members were aboard the aircraft. Due to the rate of fuel consumption the crew requested permission from the controller to increase altitude to 8000 meters, but the request was initially denied because there was a Tu-104 at that altitude in the same air corridor. At 04:15 the Tu-104 reported passing Kanash and was approximately 40-50 kilometers past the Il-18. The air traffic controller then gave the Il-18 permission to climb to an altitude of 8000 meters at 04:22. The crew confirmed receiving the permission, and at 04:26 the flight reported passing Laishevo at an altitude of 7500 meters while ascending to the altitude of 8000 meters. This was the last communication from the aircraft and when the controller attempted to reach the aircraft at 04:30, no response was heard. The No. 4 engine malfunctioned in such a way that it initiated reverse thrust causing severe drag on the right wing; pilots had to feather both propellers on the right wing because they could not figure out which propellor was responsible for the failure in time. The severe drag led to the aircraft descending sharply until it briefly retained controlled flight at altitudes between 150‚Äì200 meters; the harsh aerodynamic loads the aircraft endured tore off both ailerons and the aircraft then plummeted into the ground. The aircraft crashed into a field in Pestrechinsky at 04:30 at a speed of 500‚Äì600 km/h, killing all 67 people on board.  Conclusions  The commission responsible for the investigation of the accident determined that the most likely cause of the accident was the failure of the No. 4 propeller pitch control mechanism on the right wing, which malfunctioned and created severe drag. The failure of the pitch control mechanism led to the subsequent failure of the speed regulator while in the lower position causing the screw to initiate thrust reversal. Because the crew was unable to establish which of the right props was causing drag, both propellers had to be feathered. The amount of drag on the right wing had put the aircraft in a sharp descent, in which the aircraft recovered from briefly before both ailerons tore off the aircraft and the aircraft crashed. Laboratory simulation showed that the failure of the pitch control mechanism was caused by a defect in the oil sealing rubber gasket on the oil transporter of the screw which was caused by incorrect assembly of the AV-68I propeller at the factory. The defect in the mechanism could not be detected in flight and only could be seen by examining the screw and checking it for defects during maintenance.

All but one aboard the aircraft were killed in the crash.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was an Ilyushin Il-18D registered CCCP-74252 to the Aeroflot Far East Civil Aviation Directorate. At the time of the accident the aircraft had 342 flight hours and 89 pressurization cycles.  Crew  The cockpit crew consisted of: * Captain Eugene A. Berezhnov * Co-Pilot Vladimir G.

Pashchenko Flight attendants Lyubov Semenovna Martynenko, Galina Lobanova, Hope Gavrilovna Kucheryavaya, and Alla G. Vnukovo served as cabin crew.  Accident  The flight successfully completed the Moscow-Yemelyanovo part of the route. At 22:03 (17:03 Moscow time), the Il-18 took off from Yemelyanovo with 64 adults and 11 children as passengers; two passengers were not registered. After completing takeoff the flight maintained an altitude of 8,000 meters. At 22:37 local time (17:37 Moscow time) the flight crew switched communications to Bratsk air traffic control. Weather conditions were reported to be normal at the time. The aircraft was established to be at a distance of 234 kilometers from the airport at a bearing of 270¬∞ degrees. The crew confirmed receiving the information, stating that they were at an altitude of 8,000 meters and flying at 780 km/h, and expected to fly past Bratsk airport at Bratsk 18:06. At 18:38:38, the airliner was forced into sudden descent. The situation onboard evolved into a full-blown emergency at 22:41:28. When the flight was at an altitude of 3000 meters, air traffic controllers detected a short unintelligible transmission at 22:43:12 from the flight, determined by investigators to be most likely about the state of the aircraft. The crew unintentionally pitched the aircraft further down to the point of overspeed while trying to correct the pitch of the aircraft. The \\"fasten seat belt\\" sign was turned on and at one point the airliner was inverted. At an altitude of 1000 meters and at a speed of 890 km/h, the airliner began to break apart, and at 17:43:47 the airliner crashed 13 kilometers away from Parchum and 165 kilometers west of Bratsk airport into the taiga. The only survivor was a young soldier found alive but injured at the crash site.  Causes  The investigation hypothesized that an emergency onboard caused the crew to descend, and in doing so control of the aircraft was lost when engine number three did not perform as expected. Examination of the left wing showed evidence of a fuel leak, which was presumed to have caused an onboard fire; that part of the wing was not equipped with fire detection or fire extinguishing systems. However, the commission responsible for the investigation later rejected the claim of an in-flight fire in the left wing caused by a leak, stating that the exact cause of the emergency is unknown.

On Wednesday, 2 September 1964, the aircraft flying this route, an Ilyushin Il-18V, crashed into the side of a hill on approach to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, killing 87 of the 93 people on board. At the time of the accident it was the deadliest Il-18 crash and the deadliest aviation accident on Russian soil. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the accident was an Ilyushin Il-18V turboprop airliner registered CCCP-75531 to the Krasnoyarsk Civil Aviation Directorate of Aeroflot. At the time of the accident, it had only been in service for about a year and had logged merely 1,269 total flight hours and 358 pressurization cycles.

All nine crew members perished in the crash. Synopsis Flight 721's route led it eastward across Russia from Moscow to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, with stopovers in Khabarovsk and Krasnoyarsk. The flight changed crews at Krasnoyarsk airport and proceeded with the flight to Khabarovsk without incident. At 20:00 the flight departed Khabarovsk en route to the final destination, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, carrying 84 passengers, including 17 children. After takeoff the aircraft flew the route at an altitude of . The flight went without incident until it began descent to Yuzhno. Clouds were present in the area and visibility was limited to . At 21:05 the Il-18 reported its altitude to be and continued its flight towards the non-directional beacon. The air traffic controller warned the crew of an irregular southeasterly wind at a speed of 14.4 km/h in the airport area, and instructed them to take a landing course on a bearing of 10¬∞ (to the south). The crew responded by twice requesting to land on the shortest route, which was at a bearing of 190¬∞ (from the north). The controller refused their request and told them to follow the first route towards the beacon while at an altitude of 1500 meters. At 21:09, when the IL-18 was 37 kilometers from the runway and at an altitude of , the crew contacted the controller again. The crew again requested permission to land the shortest approach on a bearing of 190¬∞. The controller asked the aircraft if they had enough time to do so, to which the crew answered in the affirmative. The controller relented and gave the flight permission to perform a visual approach with a right turn for the approach on a bearing of 190¬∞ and the crew confirmed receiving the permission. At 21:10 the air traffic controller asked the flight to report back when it had reached an altitude of . The crew began a left turn of 100¬∞ to switch course after doing so the Il-18 landing gear was lowered and decreased the rate of descent to 36 km/h. In the process of doing so the crew forgot that the minimum altitude for entering the turn was and they should not have exited the turn at an altitude lower than in order to avoid colliding with a mountain ridge in the area at . It would only be safe to occupy an altitude of 600 meters once the aircraft was 12.7 km from the front of the runway. The weather was clear but was quite dark out when the Il-18 was preparing for landing. When the crew heard the command to report when they had reached 600 meters when they were still at an altitude of 1200 meters, seeing the airport lights and not further trying to calculate their position, the crew thought they were closer to the airport than anticipated and began the descent to 600 meters. The crew did not notice at the time that their bearing was at 140¬∞ (which became 151¬∞ in the process of turning) was well off from the 190¬∞ needed for the landing. When the controller informed them that he had lost the flight from radar. The controller did not notice, and hence did not inform the crew that their bearing was significantly off from the 190¬∞ for beginning the straight-in landing. When the crew reported reaching an altitude of 600 meters the air traffic controller, still not understanding that the aircraft was not near the point where it was safe to fly at that altitude, instructed the aircraft to descend to 400 meters thinking it ready for final approach. At 21:11, north-west of the airport, the Il-18 it crashed into a wooded hillside at an elevation of feet, killing all nine crew members and 78 of the 84 passengers. Debris from the accident spread out across a 250-meter distance; a fire broke out in the remains of the aircraft and destroyed much of what remained of the airliner. All six survivors, which included three children, were seriously injured.  Causes  The official report cited pilot error and poor in-flight planning as the cause of the accident; the crew initiated descent prematurely and apparently did not have sufficient knowledge of approach conditions, and these factors combined ultimately led to the crash. The commands given by the air traffic controller at the times give were noted to have misled the crew into thinking they were closer to the runway than they actually were.

Mechanical failure was also suggested but not able to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The most investigated hypothesis was the possibility of birdstrikes damaging the aircraft, specifically by migrating birds. Due to the aircraft crashing into the Black Sea to a depth of 600 meters and into the mud, limiting the investigation, it was impossible to determine for certain the cause or causes of the crash.
