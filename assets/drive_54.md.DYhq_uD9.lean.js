During the war Dooland was in an Australian Commando unit serving in the South Pacific.Cricketer magazine, August 1957, 28th edition. A member of Z Special Unit, he took part in rescue, intelligence and sabotage missions in Borneo, often behind enemy lines.Greg Growden, Cricketers at War, ABC Books, Sydney, 2019, pp. 228‚Äì39. After the war, he played Sheffield Shield cricket for South Australia and took the first post-war hat- trick in Australia. In 1946‚Äì47 he was called up for the Third Test in Melbourne against England and took 4/69 and 1/84. More importantly he held up one end while Colin McCool made his maiden Test century. He was kept for the Fourth Test in Melbourne and again defended stoutly while Keith Miller made his maiden Test century, but returned match figures of 3/198 and was dropped in favour of George Tribe. His Test career ended when, after Doug Ring and Colin McCool were preferred as the leg spin bowlers in the 1948 Australian touring party to England, he came to England to play in the Lancashire League and then qualified by residence to play for Nottinghamshire (Notts). In 1950‚Äì51 He toured India with the Commonwealth team. The county team was at a low ebb and Dooland had the responsibility of being the first overseas import brought in specifically to strengthen the team. He played for them from 1953 to 1957, scoring 4,782 runs at an average of 24.52 and taking 770 wickets at 18.86. He completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season twice and in another season missed it by only 30 runs. He took 16 for 83 in the match against Essex at Trent Bridge in 1954Nottinghamshire v Essex 1954. Cricket Archive and his total of 181 wickets for Nottinghamshire that season remains the club's record. Following his departure, Notts had their worst-ever period in terms of results. Dooland played twice for the Players in the Gentlemen v Players match, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1955. In 1956, when the Australian touring team played Notts, he taught Richie Benaud how to bowl the flipper.

His younger brother, Neil, was one of Australia's finest batsmen, and the pair played together for Victoria during the latter part of Merv's career. Merv Harvey broke into the Victorian state team during the 1940‚Äì41 season and played in three first-class matches. The highlight of the first phase of his career for Victoria was a rapid 70 in one hour against a New South Wales attack containing Bill O'Reilly, regarded as the best bowler in the world at the time. However, the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific caused the suspension of top-level cricket and halted Harvey's progress. Harvey then served in the Royal Australian Air Force as an airframe fitter, losing his best cricketing years to the war. An opening batsman, Harvey was described by Neil as \\"the greatest cricketer of us all\\" and known for his attacking style and penchant for hooking fast bowlers. He was initially overlooked for Victorian selection after cricket resumed in 1945‚Äì46, before being recalled for the final match of the season, and he responded by scoring a career-best 163. He was a regular member of the Victorian team during the 1946‚Äì47 season, and although he faced much competition for national selection as Australia had an abundance of quality openers at the time, he was selected for his only Test during the fourth Test of the season against England at the Adelaide Oval when both Bill Brown and Sid Barnes were injured. Harvey made 12 and 31 before being dropped immediately due to Barnes' recovery. In 1947‚Äì48, Harvey played with younger brothers Neil and Ray in two matches for Victoria, captaining the team in the second of these fixtures. However, his own form began to wane and he was dropped from the team midway through the season. In 1948‚Äì49, Harvey remained outside the first-choice team, and played in only two first-class matches against Tasmania when Victoria fielded a second-string team. He retired at the end of the season, having played only 22 first-class matches in an interrupted career. Harvey captained his state five times during the post-war phase of his career, standing in when regular captain Lindsay Hassett was away on national duty.  Early years  Merv Harvey was born in Broken Hill, New South Wales to Horace \\"Horrie\\" and Elsie Harvey. Horace worked for BHP driving horse-drawn trailers.Coleman, p. 552. Merv was the second child in the family and the oldest son. Five younger brothers were to follow, in chronological order Mick, Harold, Ray, Neil and Brian. The family relocated to Newcastle, a mining town and harbour in New South Wales, before shifting to the inner-Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, a staunchly working-class, industrial area. Horace secured a job at the confectionery company Life Savers (Australasia) Ltd, located next door to their house at 198 Argyle Street. The 19th century two-storey house was owned by the firm and was used as lodgings for the workers‚Äô families. It no longer exists, having been demolished to make way for a textile factory. The Cornish-descended Horace raised his family as strict Methodists, disallowing gambling, alcohol, tobacco and profanity in his household. An ardent cricketer during his years in New South Wales, he was good enough to hit 196 runs during a match in Newcastle, and he encouraged his children to play sport. He himself played for the Rita Social Club after moving to Fitzroy. As recreational facilities and grass ovals were sparse in densely populated Fitzroy, Merv and his younger brothers played cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their terraced house.Coleman, p. 553. Here they played cricket with a tennis ball, home made cricket bat and a kerosene tin for a wicket. They were usually joined by other local children, two of whom became elite sportsmen: Allan Ruthven and Harold Shillinglaw. The group also played Australian rules football, kicking around rolled up cardboard and newspaper. Much of the batting skill displayed by the Harvey brothers has been attributed to these games played on the unpredictable bounce of the bumpy laneway. The surface also had a V-shaped slope inwards towards the centre of the lane, causing balls to deviate sideways after bouncing.Coleman, p. 551. As the laneway meant that the playing area was long and narrow, the young boys also had to learn to play the ball straight in accordance with orthodox cricket technique. The Harveys played another form of cricket in their concreted backyard using a marble instead of a ball, and a miniature bat.Harvey, p. 26. This sharpened their reflexes. Merv was the first of the brothers to attend the nearby George Street State School and join the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens.Cashman, pp. 117‚Äì119. The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year. The successful student would then be given access to all of the club's facilities.Harvey, pp. 26‚Äì27. All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal.Harvey, p. 27. At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant.Coleman, pp. 555‚Äì556. Merv and his younger siblings had no formal coaching,Coleman, p. 555. and their father, a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed.Coleman, p. 555. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their own style and technique.Harvey, p. 29. According to the brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty, and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism. During the winter, they played baseball for Fitzroy Baseball Club, often competing in matches played as curtain raisers to the elite Australian rules football competition, the Victorian Football League. Saturday night entertainment for the family typically consisted of dinner after the day's cricket matches for Fitzroy, and Plant, Liddicut and other cricket club personnel were often invited. Under the influence of Plant and Liddicut, the boys were taught to adopt an aggressive approach, using fast feet movement to attack spin bowling in particular.Coleman, p. 556. In 1932, Harvey captained the Victorian Under-15 schoolboys team on a tour of Queensland and one of his players was future Victorian and Australian teammate Keith Miller.Coleman, pp. 473‚Äì478. Harvey graduated to Fitzroy's first XI in 1933‚Äì34.Coleman, p. 564.  First-class beginnings  During the 1938‚Äì39 season, Harvey was selected for the Victorian Second XI to play in a match against their counterparts from New South Wales. Harvey was run out for four in the first innings and then made eight as his team succumbed to a 227-run defeat. As a result, he was not called up into the First XI for the next two years. Harvey made his first- class debut for Victoria against Queensland at the Gabba in 1940‚Äì41. In the first innings, he made 25 before being caught by wicket-keeper Don Tallon from the bowling of Jack Ellis as the visitors took first innings points in a drawn match. In the next match, he made an impression. After making 35 in the first innings, he scored 70 in an hour's batting in the second innings at the SCG against New South Wales. In both innings, he was dismissed by leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, the leading bowler in the world,Cashman, p. 231. but Victoria managed to prevail by 24 runs. The teams met again three weeks later, and this time, New South Wales turned the table, winning by 235 runs. Harvey made 14 in the first innings, bowled by O'Reilly for the second innings in a row. In the second innings he made 38 before being removed by another leg spinner, Cec Pepper. Harvey ended the season with 182 runs at 36.40. Harvey enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at Fitzroy on 12 May 1942 and was a member of the 30 Squadron. He served as an airframe fitter during World War II, which severely interrupted his sporting career, and first-class cricket was cancelled after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor prompted the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific.Perry, p. 53. He was discharged on 25 January 1946 with the rank of aircraftman. According to cricket administrator Bill Jacobs, the war cost Harvey his prime cricketing years. Jacobs believed that Harvey would have been selected for Australia in the period otherwise interrupted by war. Post-war resumption and only Test After the war ended in 1945, first- class cricket resumed in 1945‚Äì46. Harvey played in a trial match for state selection. Playing for the Rest of Victoria against the first-choice state team, he made 82 and 25. This was not enough to convince the state selectors and Harvey did not get a recall to the Victorian team until the end of the season when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He responded by striking a career-best 163 to help his team to an innings win. Immediately after the war, Harvey faced a lot of competition for a place as an opening batsman in the Australian team, but a vacancy arose in 1946‚Äì47, when Bill Brown, who had captained Australia the previous season and opened for the country in Tests in the 1930s, was sidelined with injury for the whole summer. In the first match of the season, Harvey's Victorians faced the touring England cricket team led by Wally Hammond.Coleman, p. 560. In the first innings, Harvey made 21 of the team's 189 before being caught and bowled by leg spinner Doug Wright. He then made 57 before being dismissed by Alec Bedser as the hosts fell for only 204 in pursuit of 449 for victory, losing by 244 runs. This was enough for him to be selected in the Australian XI for a match against the Englishmen, in what was effectively a Test dress rehearsal. Rain curtailed the match, and the game did not reach the second innings; Harvey made 22 in his only opportunity.Pollard, pp. 370‚Äì380. There was another match for Victoria against South Australia before the Tests, allowing him another chance to push his claim for national selection. It was also his first Sheffield Shield match; his previous appearances for Victoria in interstate games were in seasons where the competition was called off due to war and replaced by one-off matches. Harvey could manage only 9 as Victoria amassed 548 in their first innings. They needed 79 runs for victory in 35 minutes on the last afternoon, and with quick scoring required, the more aggressive Keith Miller opened in place of Harvey. When the first wicket fell with the target almost completed, Harvey came in and made three not out by the time the match was over.Whitington, p. 109. These performances were not enough for the Australian selectors and Harvey was overlooked for the team for the first two Tests. After this, Harvey had two opportunities to press for selection for the next Test. He made 13 in an innings victory over Queensland and continued to be overlooked. The second match was the Shield clash with arch-rivals New South Wales, which started on Boxing Day at the MCG. After the visitors had made 205, Harvey opened with Ken Meuleman, who was out at 1/31, bringing Miller to the crease. Miller hammered the bowling and Victoria were 1/154 at the end of the day. The next day, the 271-run partnership ended after just over three hours when Miller fell at 2/302.Whitington, p. 110.Perry, p. 194. Harvey went on to make 136 in what was generally regarded as his best innings.Coleman, pp. 559‚Äì561. He famously hooked leading Australian paceman Ray Lindwall, the fastest in the world at the time, over the fence into the public bar for six. It was one of the few occasions that Lindwall was hit for six in his long career. Victoria declared at 8/560, Test bowlers Lindwall and Ernie Toshack taking the most punishment with figures of 1/100 and 0/133 from 18 and 21 overs respectively, as Victoria went on to win by an innings and 114 runs. In the return match against Queensland, Harvey made 17 as Victoria took a convincing innings win. In the next match against New South Wales, Harvey played with Neil for the first time at first-class level, and pair played together for their state's two remaining matches of the season, although they never batted together as Merv was always out before Neil came in, usually at No. 6. Merv made 30 and 44, failing to capitalise on his starts to make a big score with a Test vacancy beckoning; incumbent opener Sid Barnes was injured and unavailable for the Fourth Test. Nevertheless, Harvey was selected to play his only Test, the Fourth Test at Adelaide, filling in for the injured Barnes. England batted first and made 460 before being dismissed late on the second day. Harvey opened with Arthur Morris, and made 12 in the first innings before being bowled by Bedser while playing an aggressive shot. With only a few minutes of play left, the Australian captain Don Bradman came in and he too was bowled by Bedser, without scoring a run. Harvey later privately said the Bradman had told him to play cautiously and survive until the end of the day, rather than attack, and that the captain was angry with the resulting two wickets. According to Harvey, Bradman told him that he would never be selected for Australia again. The tourists then declared during the last afternoon and left Australia a target of 314. The target was not a realistic offer and Morris and Harvey put on an opening stand of 116 before the latter was bowled for 31 by the medium pace of occasional bowler Norman Yardley. The match ended in a draw with Australia on 1/215.Whitington, p. 132. Barnes recovered and resumed his position for the Fifth Test. Harvey ended his season by scoring 10 in his only innings of Victoria's second tour match against England, which was drawn, and was 3 not out in the first innings of the Shield match against South Australia when it was washed out. Harvey made his captaincy debut in the latter match as Lindsay Hassett was representing Australia in the Fifth Test, and his bowlers dismissed South Australia for 222 in Victoria's only innings in the field. This washed-out drawn match was the only time in six Shield matches during the season that Victoria did not emerge victorious, and they won the competition.Pollard, p. 390. Harvey ended the season with 405 runs at 33.75.  Final seasons  By 1947‚Äì48, Brown had recovered,Robinson, pp. 197‚Äì200. so Harvey had to compete with him as well as Morris and Barnes for selection. In the first match of the season against the touring Indians, Harvey made 4 and 35. The following week, he made 89 in the first innings against South Australia but managed only three in the second innings as the Victorians collapsed to be all out for 182 and lost by nine wickets. Harvey was overlooked for the Australian XI for the Test trial against India the following week. Instead, he played in the match against Queensland, scoring only 13 and 3. He was subsequently overlooked for the Test selection. During this time, he played alongside Neil in all but the Queensland match, when his younger brother was playing in the Australian XI. However, neither batted together. Neil returned to the Victorian team for the match against New South Wales at the SCG the following week, and Ray was selected to make his first- class debut, so three Harveys were in the state team for the first time. Merv opened, while Neil and Ray batted at Nos. 4 and 7 respectively. Victoria batted first and the brothers again did not form any partnerships. Merv opened and made 45 as Victoria ended with 331; the Harvey brothers had scored almost half the runs. New South Wales were forced to follow on, and Victoria were set 51 for victory. After the fall of Fred Freer at 1/24, captain Lindsay Hassett elevated Ray to No. 3, allowing two Harveys to bat together for the first time at first-class level. Ray and Merv put on an unbeaten partnership of 27 to take Victoria to a nine-wicket win. Merv and Ray ended unbeaten on 12 and 22 respectively. The trio then proceeded to play together in the next match against Western Australia two weeks later and Merv captained the team as Hassett was away on Test duty. Victoria batted first and Neil came in to join Merv with the score at 2/102, and the pair added 173 together before the younger brother fell for 94. One run later, Merv was out for 141 in what turned out to be his final first-class century; later, Ray made only 1. Victoria ended on 370 and Western Australia took a 59-run lead. In the second innings, Merv made 6 and did not bat with his brothers. He declared the innings at 9/304, setting Western Australia a target of 246 for victory. They reached 5/205 and Victoria avoided defeat. A fortnight later, Harvey again captained the team and made a duck in his only innings in a rain-curtailed match. After the Victorians had made 412, Queensland reached 5/144 at the end of the match. Despite being the captain, Harvey was dropped for the next match and was overlooked for the rest of the season, ending with 351 runs at 35.10. After being dropped for the second half of the previous season, Harvey had even less opportunities in 1948‚Äì49. His only matches for Victoria came during the Christmas period, when he played consecutive fixtures, both against Tasmania. Although the two games had first-class status, they were effectively Second XI fixtures, as the first-choice team was playing Sheffield Shield matches at the same time. Victoria only batted once in each innings and Harvey made 7 and 36 respectively. Harvey captained the team, and they dominated both matches. The Victorians took a first-innings lead of 171 in the first match, but rain interruptions ended the match with Tasmania at 1/100 in their second innings, still 71 runs in arrears. In the second match, Victoria dismissed their opponents for 65 in the first innings to take a lead of 309 runs and they went on to win by an innings and 73 runs. Having seen his previous four matches as captain end in a draw, Harvey ended his first-class career with his only victory as a leader in his final match. Harvey continued playing in the First XI for Fitzroy until 1954‚Äì55, and he finished with 6,654 runs at 29.31 in 207 First XI matches for the club. Harvey was an attacking opening batsman, strong on the drive and fond of hooking fast bowling. His brother Neil called him \\"the greatest cricketer of us all\\". Outside cricket Harvey worked for more than five decades for the same engineering firm, and lived with his wife Myrtle in the western industrial suburb of Footscray.Coleman, p. 557. He had two sons, Jeff and Graeme, both of whom played in first grade for Fitzroy. His grandson Robert Harvey‚Äîson of Jeff‚Äîwas one of the leading Australian rules footballers of the 1990s and the early 21st century. Robert made his Australian Football League debut for St Kilda Football Club in 1988 and played 21 seasons. He was a member of the All-Australian team eight times and won the Brownlow Medal twice, in 1997 and 1998, for the best and fairest player. Robert played for Victoria at Under-19 level as a bowler, but he was already playing top-flight football at the time and gave up his cricket career after the national Under-19 tournament. Another grandson Anthony, the younger brother of Robert, also played for St Kilda and captained Norwood to the 1997 South Australian National Football League (SANFL) premiership.

The females are between 70 and 75 cm long, and the males between 50 and 60 cm. The longest measured snake is 87 cm long. The olive keelback is found near water or among the surrounding vegetation. =Identifying characteristics= The snake is distinguished by a number of scale characteristics: # Single internasal. # Nineteen rows of costals. # 8 or 9 supralabials (upper lip shields). Can easily be confused with olive forest Snake (Rhabdops olivaceus). Habits Lives in water or among the surrounding vegetation. A diurnal snake, it is seen at night also. The snakes rarely bite when handled. It is known to aestivate in the summer. The olive keelback feeds mainly on frogs, tadpoles, fish and crabs which it catches with a side-stroke motion that is characteristic of watersnakes. The snake swims past the prey and suddenly snaps its head to the side. The olive keelback is also known to eat mosquito larvae (Whitaker). Sometimes, referred to as a water-cobra, the olive keelback is nevertheless tolerated by people. Reproduction It is oviparous (egg laying). It breeds in the monsoon. The eggs, which are white, soft and 30 to 35mm in length, are laid in clutches of 10 to 32 in the months January to April. The newly hatched snakes measure 16.6 to 17.5 cm in length.

It is also found in Myanmar (formerly called Burma) and southeastern Tibet (China). Description B. reticulata has the following scalation. The rostral scale is about as broad as deep, and is visible from above. The suture between the internasals is one-half to two-thirds as long as that between the prefrontals. The frontal is longer than its distance from the end of the snout, about two- thirds the length of the parietals. One postocular and one elongated temporal scale are present. There are six upper labials, of which the third and fourth enter the eye. The first upper labial is smallest, and the sixth largest. Four lower labials are in contact with the anterior chin shields. The posterior chin shields are small. The dorsal scales are in 13 rows at midbody. The ventral scales are 127‚Äì130 in number, and the anal scale is divided. The subcaudals count is 19‚Äì29.

Advice: Bites by this species not expected to cause medically significant effects and the only risk, probably small, local secondary infection. Patients presenting with bites by these snakes do not require medical attention, other than to check for infection and ensure tetanus immune status. Patients should be advised to return if local symptoms develop, suggesting secondary infection. Bites unlikely to cause more than mild to moderate local swelling & pain, occasionally local bruising, paresthesia/numbness, erythema or bleeding, but no necrosis and no systemic effects. While most cases will be minor, not requiring admission, some cases will be more severe, requiring admission and treatment, so assess carefully before early discharge.http://www.toxinology.com/fusebox.cfm?fuseaction=main.snakes.display&id;=SN0705 IUCN threat status Not Evaluated (NE).

The rostral scale is broader than it is deep and the internasals are much shorter than the prefrontals. The frontal is nearly as long as its distance from the end of the snout, which is shorter than the parietal scales. The loreal is square or deeper than it is long. There is one preocular scale, extending to the upper surface of the head, and two or three postoculars. The temporal scales are very small and numerous. There are eight to eleven upper labials, with the third, fourth and fifth, or the fourth fifth and sixth entering the eye. There are three or four lower labials, in contact with the anterior chin shields, which are about as long as the posterior. The ventral scales are 259 to 270, the anal entire and the subcaudals 106 to 131. The body is laterally compressed. The dorsal scales are in 25 or 27 rows at midbody, disposed obliquely, and the vertebral row is feebly enlarged. It is brown above, with more or less regular angular black crossbars, with or without white spots between them. There is a black band from the frontal shield to the nape and another on each side behind the eye. The lower parts are white, uniform or spotted with brown.

Diet B. forsteni preys on lizards, snakes, birds, bats, and rodents. Venom Like other species of the genus Boiga, B. forsteni possesses a mild venom. However, because of its large size, bites to humans should be taken seriously. Reproduction B. forsteni is an oviparous species. Sexually mature females lay 5-10 eggs. In India the eggs are laid in August and September. References Further reading *Anderson J (1871). \\"On some Indian reptiles\\". Proc. Zool. Soc. London 1871: 149-211.

Geographic range and Distribution The snake is found in a wide variety of locales, including areas of Western Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, India (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Miao - Changlang district), Southern China (incl. Hong Kong and Hainan), Indonesia (Java, Sulawesi, Sumatra, Borneo), Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos,Singapore and Bali Behavior A very secretive snake, it hides in hollows and cracks of tree trunks during the day. Unlike most boigas, this species is a cathemeral snake, with which it is active at both day and night. It's quite nervous and will scuttle away at the slight disturbance. They rarely bite, however. It prefers rocky crevices and thin branches that are in plain sight. Feeding Habits Mostly observed hunting just before daybreak, it primarily feeds on lizards such as geckos and small skinks but they will also eat lizard eggs. This snake also frequents branches that are overhanging a water source, thus it may also devour fish in the process. Venom Being a rear-fanged snake, it is mildly venomous. The effects are the same as most boiga species but because of its size, it never poses any threat. There are no known or recorded fatalities as well.

Recently this species was also recorded in southern parts of the Eastern Ghats, in Tamil Nadu state (Sirumalai, Shevaroys, Kolli Hills, Melagiri and BR Hills). This species prefers low to mid-elevation hills (300-1200 m asl), occurring in tropical evergreen and moist deciduous forests. Morphology Small to medium length, with a moderately long tail, reaching a maximum of about 1.2 meters. Head somewhat ovoid when viewed from above is distinct from neck with a rounded snout. Eyes are large in size with vertically elliptical pupils. Deep rusty brown with numerous, rich, reddish brown cross bars across. Underside creamy yellow densely powdered with brown spots. Dorsal scales smooth with single apical pits. The vertebral scale series is strongly enlarged. Ventral scales are laterally angulate. Dorsal scale count 21 (23) - 21 (23) - 15. Behavior Nocturnal and arboreal. Occasionally seen on the ground searching for prey. Generally of a mild disposition, but has been observed to strike when approached or cornered. If the snake is provoked it will raise its fore body, coil into loops, often vibrating its tail and bites readily. Food Especially feeds on Calotes but can eat tree frogs and geckos also, like other cat snake species.

The name was last changed in an attempt to shed what staff feared was a \\"negative perception\\" of the school rooted in its past. The school enjoyed an extensive rebuilding and refurbishment programme from 2011 to 2013. The school's accreditations include Healthy Schools, Sportmark, Leading Parent Partnership award and International Schools status. Introduction The school has partnerships with a wide range of local, national and global organisations, and its vision is to become a hub for the local community. An Ofsted inspection for Regent High, in November 2012 and published in 2013, rated the school as \\"good\\" and praised students' achievement, the quality of teaching, the behaviour and safety of students and the leadership and management of the school. The school previously held 'Specialist Arts' status, giving students access to a number of opportunities, trips and visits, to develop their confidence and self-esteem. The school has 'Advanced Skills Teachers' in Maths, Science and Drama, recognised for their classroom teaching practice. Teaching staff were finalists in the 2011 Rolls Royce Science Award, an annual awards programme recognising inspirational teaching in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). In 2012, the school‚Äôs English and Humanities departments created a CD for Camden Borough Literacy Resources, which was made available for all schools in Camden and which is designed to encourage sharing of best practice across the borough. The school's accreditations include; Artsmark Gold, Teaching Awards, Investor in People, Stonewall School Champions, Sustainable Travel and International Schools status. Plans for redevelopment of Regent High School were proposed in January 2010 and approved on 6 August 2010. In the school year 2015/ 2016, the school was rated 'Needs to improve' by school inspectors. In the same school year the school took part in a video for 'Meet the Parents'.  History  The school dates from 1873, when the London School Board leased the site, although a school had existed there before. The new school was completed and opened in 1877, as \\"Medburn Street School\\". In 1904, it was renamed the \\"Stanley School\\", though reversed in 1910 to avoid confusion with another nearby Stanley School. It originally took children up to age eleven, later extended to older pupils. After 1938, following various reorganisations, the school no longer took pupils under eleven-years-old. In 1951 it merged with part of the North London Polytechnic school for boys, based in Prince of Wales Road, Kentish Town, and became a boys school, \\"Sir William Collins School\\", named after Sir William Job Collins, an eminent surgeon and local politician. During the 1950s the school was considered to be a ‚Äútechnical school‚Äù, academic studies were taught at the Medburn Street site, technical and science subjects at the Polytechnic in Kentish Town. The school added \\"Secondary\\" to its title around 1960 when it became a comprehensive school, though still for boys only.Ceremonial Opening booklet dated 20 October 1961 shows the names in effect since 1950 This was part of the London County Council policy at the time for all inner London schools. It became co-educational in 1978 and then became \\"South Camden Community School\\" in 1993. The original Victorian school buildings were located between Chalton Street and Medburn Street; Medburn Street was used as the address. Medburn Street was demolished when, between 1958 and 1961, the London County Council extended the site and buildings to Charrington Street, which became the new address with the school offices located on that side. The new extensions were officially opened in October 1961 by eminent engineer Sir Willis Jackson (later Lord Jackson of Burnley). The extensions had, however, already been partially occupied in 1960 out of necessity with the large expansion of pupils, to approximately 1,100 at the time, which made it one of the largest schools in inner London. The site for the new extension was about . The cost at the time was ¬£375,000, and a further ¬£36,500 for furniture and equipment. The architect was Mr William Crabtree, FRIBA and the general contractor Gee, Walker & Slater Ltd. The design consisted of interconnected quadrangles, designed to have as many rooms looking inwards as possible.Text in the Official Opening Booklet, 20 October 1961 = Rebranding = The school was rebranded and renamed in 2012. The new name was chosen after consultation with students, staff and governors, and the construction of a ¬£25 million new building featuring classrooms, a fully equipped gym, three all-weather multi-use pitches, science laboratories, a theatre with professional lighting and staging, drama studios, music recital rooms, technology suites, a recording studio, four art studios, a media studies suite and a large library. The school plans to use the new building to become a hub for their community and partner primary schools. Through the rebranding process, a compulsory uniform was established, consisting of a navy blazer with the logo and a plain white school shirt with a clip-on tie with the student's tutorial colour. Boys are required to wear plain black trousers, whilst girls have the option of wearing either these or a plain black knee- or ankle-length skirt.  Ofsted  In November 2012 Regent High School was rated as a \\"good\\" school under the new Ofsted framework. The inspection praised students' achievement, the quality of teaching, the behaviour and safety of students and the leadership and management of the school. Inspectors found that \\"all staff share a relentless drive to raise the achievement of students, that the school's broad curriculum caters for students' individual learning needs and interests, and that 'teaching supports students' social, moral, spiritual and cultural development strongly\\". The report confirms that the school's \\"capacity to secure and maintain improvement is reflected by the significant yearly improvements in attainment and achievement\\", that \\"GCSE and equivalent results obtained by Year 11 students have improved well... due to the very strong emphasis on learning\\" and that \\"a significant proportion [of students] made outstanding progress in 2012\\". Regent Sixth Form was also rated \\"good\\". Inspectors noted that \\"the achievement of students leaving in Year 13 is good, especially for students studying vocational qualifications\\" and that \\"the success of the school's drive to improve students' life chances is reflected in the greater proportion of students progressing to higher education\\". In 2015 following a decline in standards, examination results, and behaviour, Camden Local Authority placed the school on a \\"Notice to Improve\\", although the school was not inspected by OFSTED. The next OFSTED inspection came in January 2018, just 17 months after the new Headteacher was appointed. The school once again secured its \\"good\\" rating, with inspectors praising the Headteacher's \\"vision, drive and determination\\" together with improvements in behaviour and a culture of high expectations. Furthermore, pupils reported that they feel safe and the new PSHRE programme was well received.  Location  Located just north of central London, in the Borough of Camden, Regent High School is partnered with various institutions, including University College London, Rothschild, Sainsbury's and The Francis Crick Institute. The partnerships enhance the school's curriculum, support students preparing for higher education, developing employability skills, and gaining understanding of the world of work. These opportunities form an integral part of the learning environment, where individual students' needs are met and their talents and interests developed. In addition, the partnerships provide extensive CPD opportunities for staff.  Sixth Form  Regent Sixth Form is expanding and provides a wide range of AS/A Level and BTEC National courses. The curriculum is extended by work with other local post-16 providers, a mentoring programme and a number of unique initiatives, along with advice on higher education, UCAS applications and career options. The Sixth Form provides an enrichment programme, including nationally-recognised award schemes. Those enrolled in Sixth Form are encouraged to take an active part in the Vertical Tutoring system in place at the school, encouraging independence, initiative and leadership. The school provides dedicated study space for post-16 students to work together in groups or independently. Sixth formers progress onto a range of university courses, including biomedical and forensic sciences, law, nursing and geography at a number of Higher Education institutions. In 2012, 100% of Regent sixth form students were accepted onto their chosen university courses. The sixth form has an \\"Aim Higher\\" programme in place, which includes careers days, academic booster sessions and mentoring schemes with UCL, Sainsbury's and British Land. Post-16 students attend an annual Higher Education Conference, designed to give students information about a number of future options. In 2011 the school was in the top 25% of all schools and colleges nationally in terms of progress made by students at Key Stage 5.  Exam results  In 2012, the school had their best ever results with 62% of GCSE students achieving 5+ A*-C grades, including English and Maths, marking a 13 percentage point increase on the previous year's results. At A-level, post-16 students achieved a 98% pass rate, with 52% of students attaining an A*/A grade or equivalent in their A level and BTEC courses, with two thirds of Year 13 students achieving at least one grade at A*/A. An Ofsted report from November 2012 stated 'results are improving rapidly'. Partnerships The school's location in the city of London facilitates extensive links with professional organisations, businesses and educational institutions. Examples include: UCL, Rothschild, Wellcome Trust, Sainsburys, British Land and The Francis Crick Institute. The collaborative partnerships provide students with unique opportunities such as trips, visits, motivational speakers, masterclasses and mentoring. Other community partners include: Global Generation, City Learning Centre, Somers Town Community Association, The British Museum, British Library, Age UK Camden, Foundling Museum, Metropolitan Police, Camden Fairtrade Network, Camden Mela and Somerstown Festival, Anne Frank Trust and ARUP, Young Enterprise, Sainsburys and The British Council. In addition, the school works closely with their primary school partners. Activities and events include masterclasses, taster sessions and educational workshops, and allow for pupils to work with teachers and students from the school. The school achieved the 2012‚Äì2015 Full International Schools Award (ISA), in recognition of their international partnerships with Bububu Secondary School, Zanzibar, Tanzania, UNRWA School, Abu Dis, Palestine and Jongintaba Junior Secondary School, South Africa. Headteachers The current Headteacher is Gary Moore, who was appointed in March 2016 and subsequently took up post in September 2016. Prior to becoming Headteacher at Regent High School, Mr Moore was Deputy Head at Hampstead School (2013‚Äì2016), also in Camden and Vice Principal at Burlington Danes Academy (2006‚Äì2012). In Summer 2018 Mr Moore was nominated and shortlisted for \\"Headteacher of the Year\\" at the National TES Teaching Awards. This was following huge improvements for the school which saw its profile rise in media including on TV. The 2018 OFSTED report also praised Mr Moore's leadership. * 1952‚Äì1957 ‚Äì T G Jones BA * 1958‚Äì1968(?) ‚Äì Authur G Bastin, CBE MA BSc * 1968‚Äì1975 ‚Äì Mr Edmonson MA Cantab * 1975‚Äì1977(?) ‚Äì Graham Stewart (actual period of stay was longer) * 1977(?)‚Äì1982(?) ‚Äì Not known * 1982(?)‚Äì1988(?) ‚Äì Pamela Turner * 1988(?)-1990(?) ‚Äì Richard Green * 1990(?)‚Äì2001 ‚Äì Huw Salisbury OBE * 2001‚Äì2016 ‚Äì Rosemary Leeke * 2016‚Äì present ‚Äì Gary Moore Notable former teachers * Harry Greenway (former MP), was a Head of Telford House in the 1960s and Deputy Headmaster. * Stanley Warren, a former Japanese prisoner of war, noted for painting the Changi Murals in the chapel of Changi Prison during captivity, was an art teacher in the 1950s and 1960s, and Deputy Head of Brunel House from 1963‚Äì65.

The school opened in 1910, making it one of Victoria's oldest state secondary schools, and moved to its current site in 1915.Peter Begg (1990). Geelong - The First 150 Years. Globe Press. The current principal is Glenn Davey. It is situated on the corner of Garden and Ryrie Streets and backs on to Eastern Gardens, home of the Geelong Botanical Gardens. Both Eastern Beach and the centre of Geelong are within easy walking distance. Geelong High School accommodates students in Years 7‚Äì12 and has an enrolment of about 900. History On 8 February 1910, 79 students, together with eight teachers and an acting headmaster, began classes in a couple of disused rooms at the Gordon Institute of TAFE. John William Gray was appointed headmaster in April 1910. Twelve months later, enrolment had increased to 150, and 12 rooms were being used at the Gordon. The school was renamed the Geelong High School and as such became Geelong's first state secondary school. The current site was selected and the new school, to accommodate 450 students, was completed in August 1915. In 2005/06, the school underwent some major reconstruction, providing new woodwork and metalwork studios, science labs, computer pods and a new gymnasium and library, in addition to a learning centre with a computer pod, classrooms and a theatrette. The work was done to accommodate and assist Year 7 students in their learning. Geelong High School has been identified as one of the 50 \\"most needy schools\\" in Victoria, in an audit conducted by the Victorian state government. This has led to students sending letters to MHR for Corio Richard Marles, as well as other politicians, writing of \\"teachers and students working in classrooms with cracked walls, substandard heating and no cooling\\", pleading for funding to fix and upgrade the school. In 2014, the school received funding for a rebuild. Planning is undergoing during 2015/16 with construction expected to start early 2017. It should be completed by the end of 2019.

He was known for his unique \\"bent finger\\" grip, with which he briefly perplexed batsmen across Australia as well as the touring English cricket team. His five Tests were all against England, in the 1950‚Äì51 series, but was forced to retire to look after his ailing father's business; he \\"could have the world's best batsmen at his mercy, if he could spare the time\\".Kay, John (1951) Ashes to Hassett, John Sherratt & Son, pp. 47-52.  Early years and Army service  Iverson was born in St Kilda, Melbourne, and was a fast bowler at Geelong College where he was educated. His school career was notable for his dismissal of Lindsay Hassett with an inswinger in an inter-house match within his school, later to become his captain in both the Victorian and Australian teams. Iverson was to take no part in cricket for twelve years after graduation, and did not play first class cricket for another 15 years. Starting in 1933, Iverson became a jackaroo in the Mallee and later rose to become an assistant manager on a property of Essington Lewis at Tallarook. In 1939, he enlisted in the Australian Defence Force after the outbreak of the Second World War, and served in the anti-aircraft regiments of the Ninth Division in the Middle East, before being deployed to Papua New Guinea. There, Sergeant Iverson developed an unorthodox method of spinning the ball, which he gripped between his thumb and middle finger. This enabled him to bowl a wide variety of deliveries, including off breaks, leg breaks and googlies, without any change of action. At this stage he was only playing socially in spontaneous recreation with other army colleagues.  Early career  Upon returning to Australia after the war, Iverson only played golf and tennis for recreation, until he had a chance encounter with blind cricketers near the Melbourne Cricket Ground which motivated him to join the suburban Brighton Cricket Club at a time when he had no cricketing equipment. He rose rapidly, from the third XI at Brighton in late 1946, to the Melbourne Cricket Club in 1948 and the Victorian team a year later.  Test career  He first attracted attention in first class cricket in 1949‚Äì50 when he took 46 wickets for Victoria at an average of 16.12. In the following autumn he toured New Zealand under Bill Brown, and took, in all matches, 75 wickets at a cost of seven runs each, and in the next Australian season, aged 35, was selected for the Test team against the England cricket team captained by F. R. Brown. His unique action perplexed the visiting batsmen to such an extent that in the Test series he obtained 21 wickets for 15.73 runs apiece. Iverson made his debut in the first Test at Brisbane, where he did not bowl in the first innings before taking 4/43 in the second. He took match figures of 6/73 in his second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground before his most notable performance of 6/27 in the second innings of the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground as Australia completed an innings victory. During the Fourth Test at Adelaide he suffered an ankle injury when he trod on the ball. This impaired his ability, as he only took 3/68 and 2/84 in the final two Tests of his career. He played in only one game in each of the next two seasons and then gave up cricket altogether after batsmen analysed and mastered his tricks. With the bat, he scored three runs from seven innings, finishing his Test career with a batting average of 0.75.  Playing style  Iverson's unique bowling grip Nicknamed \\"Big Jake\\" and \\"Wrong-Grip Jake\\", Iverson's unique style caused Australian captain Lindsay Hassett, a fellow Victorian, to hide his action during training sessions for the national team. Hassett prohibited Iverson from bowling to New South Wales batsmen to prevent them from analysing his bowling action, making him more effective in Sheffield Shield matches for Victoria against New South Wales. This led to conflict with New South Wales batsmen. When Iverson was put on to bowl during the Tests, Hassett would remove Keith Miller, a New South Welshman, from his position at first slip and move him to mid on, so that he was standing behind Iverson and could not understand how Iverson's bowling action worked. He explained his action thus: His style was praised by one of his contemporaries, fellow Australian leg spinner Richie Benaud and national captain, who stated in reference to Iverson's innovation that changed thinking about spin bowling:  After cricket  Family commitments and his job in managing a real estate agency resulted in him disappearing from the first class cricket scene in 1951. However, he again played for Australia in three unofficial \\"Tests\\" played by a 1953‚Äì54 Commonwealth team. He later became a commentator for ABC radio. In his early 50s Iverson developed atherosclerosis of the brain, which caused him to suffer from recurrent depression. He committed suicide with a gunshot wound to the chest aged 58. He died in Brighton, Victoria.

They are abundant in highly sensitive skin like that of the fingertips in humans, and make synaptic contacts with somatosensory afferent nerve fibers. Though it has been reported that Merkel cells are derived from neural crest cells, more recent experiments in mammals have indicated that they are in fact epithelial in origin. Structure Merkel cell. Merkel cells are found in the skin and some parts of the mucosa of all vertebrates. In mammalian skin, they are clear cells found in the stratum basale (at the bottom of sweat duct ridges) of the epidermis approximately 10 Œºm in diameter. They also occur in epidermal invaginations of the plantar foot surface called rete ridges. Most often, they are associated with sensory nerve endings, when they are known as Merkel nerve endings (also called a Merkel cell-neurite complex). They are associated with slowly adapting (SA1) somatosensory nerve fibers. They react to low vibrations (5‚Äì15 Hz) and deep static touch such as shapes and edges. Due to a small receptive field (extremely detailed info) they are used in areas like fingertips the most; they are not covered (shelled) and thus respond to pressures over long periods. =Developmental= The origin of Merkel cells has been debated for over 20 years. Evidence from skin graft experiments in birds implies that they are neural crest derived, but experiments in mammals now demonstrate an epidermal origin. Function The German anatomist Friedrich Sigmund Merkel referred to these cells as Tastzellen or \\"touch cells\\" but this proposed function has been controversial as it has been hard to prove. Though, genetic knockout mice have recently shown that Merkel cells are essential for the specialized coding by which afferent nerves resolve fine spatial details. Merkel cells are sometimes considered APUD cells (an older definition. More commonly classified as a part of dispersed neuroendocrine system) because they contain dense core granules, and thus may also have a neuroendocrine function. Subject to malignancy Although uncommon, these cells may become malignant and form a Merkel cell carcinoma‚Äîan aggressive and difficult to treat skin cancer.

According to Howard T. Odum, \\"The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency.\\"H.T. Odum 1995, p. 311 History Chen (2006) has located the origin of the statement of maximum power as a formal principle in a tentative proposal by Alfred J. Lotka (1922a, b). Lotka's statement sought to explain the Darwinian notion of evolution with reference to a physical principle. Lotka's work was subsequently developed by the systems ecologist Howard T. Odum in collaboration with the Chemical Engineer Richard C. Pinkerton, and later advanced by the Engineer Myron Tribus. While Lotka's work may have been a first attempt to formalise evolutionary thought in mathematical terms, it followed similar observations made by Leibniz and Volterra and Ludwig Boltzmann, for example, throughout the sometimes controversial history of natural philosophy. In contemporary literature it is most commonly associated with the work of Howard T. Odum. The significance of Odum's approach was given greater support during the 1970s, amid times of oil crisis, where, as Gilliland (1978, pp. 100) observed, there was an emerging need for a new method of analysing the importance and value of energy resources to economic and environmental production. A field known as energy analysis, itself associated with net energy and EROEI, arose to fulfill this analytic need. However, in energy analysis intractable theoretical and practical difficulties arose when using the energy unit to understand, a) the conversion among concentrated fuel types (or energy types), b) the contribution of labour, and c) the contribution of the environment. Philosophy and theory Lotka said (1922b: 151): Gilliland noted that these difficulties in analysis in turn required some new theory to adequately explain the interactions and transactions of these different energies (different concentrations of fuels, labour and environmental forces). Gilliland (Gilliland 1978, p. 101) suggested that Odum's statement of the maximum power principle (H.T.Odum 1978, pp. 54‚Äì87) was, perhaps, an adequate expression of the requisite theory: This theory Odum called maximum power theory. In order to formulate maximum power theory Gilliland observed that Odum had added another law (the maximum power principle) to the already well established laws of thermodynamics. In 1978 Gilliland wrote that Odum's new law had not yet been validated (Gilliland 1978, p. 101). Gilliland stated that in maximum power theory the second law efficiency of thermodynamics required an additional physical concept: \\"the concept of second law efficiency under maximum power\\" (Gilliland 1978, p. 101): In this way the concept of maximum power was being used as a principle to quantitatively describe the selective law of biological evolution. Perhaps H.T.Odum's most concise statement of this view was (1970, p. 62): The Odum‚ÄìPinkerton approach to Lotka's proposal was to apply Ohm's law ‚Äì and the associated maximum power theorem (a result in electrical power systems) ‚Äì to ecological systems. Odum and Pinkerton defined \\"power\\" in electronic terms as the rate of work, where Work is understood as a \\"useful energy transformation\\". The concept of maximum power can therefore be defined as the maximum rate of useful energy transformation. Hence the underlying philosophy aims to unify the theories and associated laws of electronic and thermodynamic systems with biological systems. This approach presupposed an analogical view which sees the world as an ecological- electronic-economic engine. Proposals for maximum power principle as 4th thermodynamic law Definition in words Odum et al. viewed the maximum power theorem as a principle of power-efficiency reciprocity selection with wider application than just electronics. For example, Odum saw it in open systems operating on solar energy, like both photovoltaics and photosynthesis (1963, p. 438). Like the maximum power theorem, Odum's statement of the maximum power principle relies on the notion of 'matching', such that high- quality energy maximizes power by matching and amplifying energy (1994, pp. 262, 541): \\"in surviving designs a matching of high-quality energy with larger amounts of low-quality energy is likely to occur\\" (1994, p. 260). As with electronic circuits, the resultant rate of energy transformation will be at a maximum at an intermediate power efficiency. In 2006, T.T. Cai, C.L. Montague and J.S. Davis said that, \\"The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source.\\" (2006, p. 317). In several texts H.T. Odum gave the Atwood machine as a practical example of the 'principle' of maximum power. = Mathematical definition = The mathematical definition given by H.T. Odum is formally analogous to the definition provided on the maximum power theorem article. (For a brief explanation of Odum's approach to the relationship between ecology and electronics see Ecological Analog of Ohm's Law) Contemporary ideas Whether or not the principle of maximum power efficiency can be considered the fourth law of thermodynamics and the fourth principle of energetics is moot. Nevertheless, H.T. Odum also proposed a corollary of maximum power as the organisational principle of evolution, describing the evolution of microbiological systems, economic systems, planetary systems, and astrophysical systems. He called this corollary the maximum empower principle. This was suggested because, as S.E. Jorgensen, M.T. Brown, H.T. Odum (2004) note, C. Giannantoni may have confused matters when he wrote \\"The \\"Maximum Em-Power Principle\\" (Lotka‚ÄìOdum) is generally considered the \\"Fourth Thermodynamic Principle\\" (mainly) because of its practical validity for a very wide class of physical and biological systems\\" (C. Giannantoni 2002, ¬ß 13, p. 155). Nevertheless, Giannantoni has proposed the Maximum Em-Power Principle as the fourth principle of thermodynamics (Giannantoni 2006). The preceding discussion is incomplete. The \\"maximum power\\" was discovered several times independently, in physics and engineering, see: Novikov (1957), El-Wakil (1962), and Curzon and Ahlborn (1975). The incorrectness of this analysis and design evolution conclusions was demonstrated by Gyftopoulos (2002).

He was educated at the Anglican Church Grammar School. An opening batsman, he played domestic first-class cricket for Queensland for 10 years, from 1946-7 to 1956-7. He played in five Tests for the Australian cricket team in 1950 and 1951. His younger brother Ron Archer played 19 Tests for Australia between 1953 and 1956. Archer toured to South Africa in 1949-50, but was not selected for the Test team. He made his Test debut in the second test (after a 6th consecutive 12th man pick) of the 1950‚Äì51 Ashes series against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Despite moderate scores in that match, and the third test at the Sydney Cricket Ground and the fourth test at the Adelaide Oval, he was then dropped from the team. He returned for the first two tests against West Indies in 1951-2, but did not play Test cricket again. Archer initially worked as a science teacher during his playing career, but switched to broadcasting in 1954 when he was recruited by Bob Hynes for the Brisbane radio station 4BC. He later became Hynes's right-hand man in the Commonwealth Broadcasting Corporation and succeeded him as its chief executive.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hynes-sir-lincoln- carruthers-10585 On 26 January 1980, Archer was named a Member of the Order of Australia in recognition of services to the media.

Directed by Royston Tan, the film is an expanded version of Tan's 2002 award-winning short film, also titled 15. It is one of the few Singaporean films to feature brief full-frontal male nudity, together with the Singaporean-Thai film Pleasure Factory and the Singaporean- Hong Kong film Bugis Street. Plot The film stars three real-life juvenile gangsters, all aged 15, giving an accurate depiction of Chinese teenage gang- life in the Singapore suburbs. The 2003 film features two more gangsters as characters as well as a fight sequence with more affluent English-educated Singapore youths. Rather than scripting the movie or employing professional actors, Tan attempted to capture the troubled lives of his characters in realistic fashion, apparently without much prior scripting. Distribution In Singapore, the film premiered during the 2003 Singapore International Film Festival.IMDB: Release dates for 15: The Movie (2003). In 2003, it premiered in Canada during the Montreal World Film Festival, and in Britain during the London Film Festival. In 2004, it premiered in the United States during the Sundance Film Festival, and in Australia during the Sydney Film Festival. The film also saw its first US theatrical release in New York City on 13 April 2005.. In Singapore, the film is distributed by Zhao Wei Films. In North America, it is distributed by Picture This! Entertainment.IMDB: Company Credits for 15: The Movie (2003). Reception =Censorship= While the Media Development Authority (MDA) ruled that the film should be passed uncut under the then R(A) rating, the Singapore Police Force was concerned that fights could break out given the use of real gang names, locations and secret society chants in the movie, requesting cuts/edits to be made through the MDA for law and order reasons.. Under pressure, Royston Tan ended up making reportedly 27 cuts to the film.\\"Take a big breath, you'll survive.\\" The Standard. 27 July 2006. Opposition was also raised against the heavy use of Hokkien in the film, which is discouraged by the Singapore government in favour of Mandarin and English. These restrictions infuriated Tan, and later led him to create his satirical short film Cut. =Critical reception= The film received mixed reviews from film critics.See and . On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 50% based on 10 reviews.. On Metacritic the film has a score of 47% based on 6 reviews.. The film has been advertised outside of Singapore in gay publications, due to the heavy homoerotic tension between the characters. However, in an interview segment of the DVD Royston's Shorts, a collection of Tan's short films, Tan affirms that the boys whose lives he portrayed do not identify as gay. =Awards= * FIPRESCI/NETPAC Award, Singapore International Film Festival (2003)IMDB: Awards for 15: The Movie (2003). * Best Fiction, Tampere International Short Film Festival (2003) * Prize of the Youth Film Competition (Special Mention), Oberhausen International Short Film Festival (2003)Internationale Kurzfilmtage Oberhausen: 2003 Award Winners. * Grand Prix Asturias (nominated), Gij√≥n International Film Festival (2003) * Best Director, Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema (2004)6th Buenos Aires Festival Internacional de Cine Independiente: Winners.

They are nerve endings and provide information on mechanical pressure, position, and deep static touch features, such as shapes and edges. Merkel cells in the basal epidermis of the skin store serotonin which they release to associated nerve endings in response to pressure. Each ending consists of a Merkel cell in close apposition with an enlarged nerve terminal. This is sometimes referred to as a Merkel cell‚Äìneurite complex, or a Merkel disc receptor. A single afferent nerve fibre branches to innervate up to 90 such endings. Location In mammals, Merkel nerve endings have a wide distribution and are found in the basal layer of glabrous and hairy skin, in hair follicles, and in oral and anal mucosa. Microscopically they are relatively large, myelinated nerve endings. In humans, Merkel cells along with Meissner's corpuscles occur in the superficial skin layers, and are most densely clustered beneath the ridges of the highly sensitive fingertips which make up fingerprints, and less so in the palms and forearm. In hairy skin, Merkel nerve endings are clustered into specialized epithelial structures called \\"touch domes\\" or \\"hair disks\\". Merkel receptors are also located in the mammary glands. Wherever they are found, the epithelium is arranged to optimize the transfer of pressure to the ending. Functions Merkel cells provide information on pressure, position, and deep static touch features such as shapes and edges. They are tactile sensors in the business of mechanotransduction. They encode surface features of touched objects into perception, but also have to do with proprioception.Severson KS1, Xu D1, Van de Loo M2, Bai L3, Ginty DD4, O'Connor DH5.

Merkel disks can also respond to light touch https://www.soinc.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/2015A%26PIntegumentary%20Handout.pdf Merkel cells transduce tactile stimuli / mechanical forces into excitatory signals, which trigger vesicular serotonin release; they have also been called a \\"serotonergic synapse\\".Chang W, Kanda H, Ikeda R, Ling J, DeBerry JJ, Gu JG.

They have similar functions as the enterochromaffin cell, the mechanosensory cell in the GI epithelium, which synthesizes 95% of the body's total serotonin or 5-HT. Like the cells responsible for the mechanotransduction in hearing, Merkel cells transduce mechanical forces into excitatory signals via ion conductance on mechanosensitive channels.Arnad√≥ttir J., Chalfie M. Eukaryotic mechanosensitive channels. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 39, 111‚Äì137. (2010) DOI 10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125836 of which Piezo2 is the Merkel cell's primary mechanosensor.Woo S.

DOI 10.1038/nature13251 Electrophysiology The Merkel cell's somewhat rigid structure, and the fact that they are not encapsulated, causes them to have a sustained response in the form of action potentials or spikes) to mechanical deflection of the tissue. Because of their sustained response to pressure, Merkel nerve endings are classified as slowly adapting in contrast to rapidly adapting receptors by Pacinian and Meissner's corpuscles, which respond only to the onset and offset of mechanical deflection. In mammals, electrical recordings from single afferent nerve fibres have shown that the responses of Merkel nerve endings are characterized by a vigorous response to the onset of a mechanical ramp stimulus (dynamic), and then continued firing during the plateau phase (static). Firing during the static phase can continue for more than 30 minutes. The inter-spike intervals during sustained firing are irregular, in contrast to the highly regular pattern of inter-spike intervals obtained from slowly adapting type II mechanoreceptors. They fire fastest, when small points indent the skin, and fire at a low rate on slow curves or flat surfaces. Convexities reduce their rate of firing further still.Kandel E.R., Schwartz, J.H., Jessell, T.M. (2000). Principles of Neural Science, 4th ed., p.433. McGraw-Hill, New York. Sensitivity and receptive fields Merkel nerve endings are the most sensitive of the four main types of mechanoreceptors to vibrations at low frequencies, around 5 to 15 Hz. Merkel nerve endings are extremely sensitive to tissue displacement, and may respond to displacements of less than 1 Œºm. A mechanoreceptor's receptive field is the area within which a stimulus can excite the cell. If the skin is touched in two separate points within a single receptive field, the person will be unable to feel the two separate points. If the two points touched span more than a single receptive field then both will be felt. The size of mechanoreceptors' receptive fields in a given area determines the degree to which detailed stimuli can be resolved: the smaller and more densely clustered the receptive fields, the higher the resolution. Type I afferent fibres have smaller receptive fields than type II fibres. Several studies indicate that type I fibres mediate high resolution tactile discrimination, and are responsible for the ability of our finger tips to feel fine detailed surface patterns (e.g. for reading Braille). Merkel's discs have small receptive fields which allow for them to detect fine spatial separation. They also have two point discrimination. Eponym Merkel's discs are named after German anatomist Friedrich Merkel (1845‚Äì1919), who was 30 years old when he described them.Merkel FS. (1875). Tastzellen und Tastk√∂rperchen bei den Hausthieren und beim Menschen. Archiv f√ºr mikroskopische Anatomie, 11: 636-652. Diseases In burns, Merkel endings are most commonly lost.

It is native to coastal waters of South and Southeast Asia. The species was re-delimited in 2012, allocating populations east and south of the west coast of Thailand to other species. Ecology and behaviour It is commonly found in mangroves, mudflats, streams, ponds, tidal pools, on algae patches, and has even been found burrowing into the mud. It is rear-fanged and is mildly venomous. An aquatic and nocturnal snake, it feeds mainly on fish and is known to consume eels. In captivity, it is observed to move in a sidewinding direction on land. In the BBC series 'Life in Cold Blood' it was filmed adapting this sidewinding technique to jump across a mudflat in Singapore; up until then, no snakes were considered able to truly jump. It also has a prehensile tail that would suggest it could climb mangrove trees. It is now known to give birth to live young, numbering from 8 to 30, either in water or on land. It is a quite docile, mild-tempered and a hardy snake; in recent years it has become a welcome addition to snake hobbyists in the Philippines. It also owes its popularity to its bright yellow to orange belly coloring, mostly of females. In the Philippines, particularly in the Central Visayas area, this snake is commonly known as the \\"tangkig\\". Scalation Description The visibility of upper jaw, giving it a dog-like appearance. Head long and distinct from neck. Eyes small and beady, with rounded pupils. Dorsum dark gray, with faint dark blotches and a dark line along the sides of the head, across the eyes. Center cream with two distinct rows of large, diffuse dark gray spots. Scales are distinctly keeled. Midbody scale rows 21‚Äì25. Ventrals 132‚Äì160. Subcaudals 49‚Äì72.  Distribution and habitat Dog-faced Water Snake, Sundarban, India This is a saltwater-tolerant species found in India (including Andaman and Nicobar Islands), Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, and northwestern Malaysia.

Career A right-handed middle-order batsman and off-spinner, Hole played 98 first-class matches between 1949‚Äì50 and 1957‚Äì58. He made his first-class debut for New South Wales at the age of 19. During this match, he didn't do very well in batting, but he made up for this during his bowling. He then moved to South Australia and started playing for them. His debut in international cricket came when he was selected for the Australian team against England in February 1951. Before he made his international cricket debut, Hole played baseball in the off-season in the local New South Wales competition, before moving to South Australia in 1950 where he would be invited to play for the South Australia state baseball team in the 1950 Claxton Shield. However, he was ultimately declined by the Australian Baseball Council to play as he did not meet a six-month state residency requirement.Harris, J.O (2009). Queensland Baseball 1905‚Äì1990. p. 49.

Chrysopelea ornata is a colubrid snake found in both South and Southeast Asia. It is, along with the other species in its genus Chrysopelea, very unusual in that it is capable of a type of gliding flight. It is also rear-fanged. Currently, three subspecies are recognized. The snake's striking looks and capability of gliding make it a popular choice for captivity.  Description  Red-spotted form of Chrysopelea ornata from North Bengal, India Chrysopelea ornata is usually green in color, with black cross-hatching and yellow or gold colored accents. The body, though slender, is far less so than in other tree snakes. It has a flattened head with constricted neck, a blunt nose and large eyes with round pupils. The lateral, sharp and pronounced keeled condition of the ventrals in association with the normal, not enlarged, vertebral row of scales distinguish this snake. Chrysopelea ornata.The snake's striking looks and capability of gliding make it a popular choice for captivity. This snake ranges from long.Snakes of Sri Lanka website Maturity is reached at about in length. The tail is about one- fourth of the total length. Chrysopelea ornata has two major colour forms, and their descriptions are given below: * In Sri Lanka and the southern extent of its Indian range, the snake is primarily greenish yellow or pale green. Each scale has a black mesial streak or spot, and is more or less edged with black. The snake also has dark crossbars at intervals. A series of large, flower- shaped, reddish or orange vertebral spots may be present or absent. Ventrals greenish, outside the keel edged with black or spotted. Head black with yellow crossbars and spots. The flower-shaped spots are more common in Sri Lanka than in south India. * The second color variety which is more common in Southeast Asia lacks the reddish vertebral spots, and has less prominent black crossbars. But all varieties can be found throughout its distribution area. Venom This species is considered mildly venomous, with few confirmed cases of medically significant envenomation. Chrysopelea species are not considered so dangerous to humans as to be of medical importance.

In India Chrysopelea ornata ranges from the Western Ghats, up to the Dangs, Katernia Ghat in Uttar Pradesh, North Bihar, northern West Bengal eastwards to Arunachal Pradesh. It is also found in the forests of the Andaman islands. Conservation Not known to be endangered.  Subspecies  Two subspecies of C. ornata are recognized: *C. o. ornata ‚Äì southwest India *C. o. ornatissima ‚Äì north and east India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia  Behaviour  C. ornata is diurnal and arboreal. The snake's gliding ability, while not as impressive as that of the paradise flying snake (C. paradisi), still makes it capable of moving from tree to tree with relative ease. These snakes are excellent climbers, being able move across even the smallest of branches and even straight up trees with few branches by using the edges of rough bark. They are frequently seen moving up a coconut palm, or up vertical rock faces in graceful curves, gripping the somewhat uneven surfaces with their scales. They tend to be nervous, fast-moving snakes, and attempt to flee if disturbed, but generally do not hesitate to bite if handled. They are mildly venomous, but the venom is not considered to be dangerous to humans. It is intended to assist in subduing fast-moving, arboreal prey. C. ornata takes small arboreal prey, such as lizards, bats, and small rodents. It might also feed on bird eggs and insects. Also, it is reported to take snakes occasionally, and to avoid frogs, though frogs are also reported being eaten. The snake stalks or pursues the prey and seizes it by the neck, which is crushed in its strong jaws. C. ornata climbing up prior to launching itself into the air =Flight= C. ornata, like others of its genus, glides or parachutes. This is presumably done to cover distances faster, to escape predators, to catch prey, or to move around in forests. Flying snakes usually parachute from tree to tree, but sometimes launch themselves from trees onto the ground. They have been known to cross as much as 100 m. It does this by climbing up to a height, which it does easily by virtue of its keeled belly scales, and then launching itself into mid-air. The snake contracts its ventral surface inwards to form a U-shaped concave depression along the entire length of their bodies, holding the outer edges of the ventral scales rigid. This concave surface acts like a parachute, and increases air resistance, allowing the snake to glide forward with the thrust of its launch. The snake undulates through the air, in a swimming-like motion. It holds the tail rigidly upwards, and by twisting the tail from side to side, it attains balance. This motion allows it to propel forward, landing clumsily at the end of its flight. =Human habitats= C. ornata is a common snake and has adapted well to human habitats. In southern parts of Thailand, they are reported to hide in the thatch of the roofing material inside bungalows to prey on geckos and mice during the night. In these areas, one can almost be certain to be relatively close to a C. ornata most anywhere, perhaps hiding in the crown of the nearby coconut palm, under the roots of a tree, or even curled up in a potted plant. When hunting and pursuing fleeing prey, they have been reported to drop down out of the crown of coconut palms. Snakes are often indiscriminately killed, as many locals incorrectly assume all snakes are venomous. C. ornata is sometimes cooked for food. Reproduction Breeding habits are little known. The snake is oviparous and six to 12 elongated eggs are laid. Gravid females have been obtained in May and June and hatchlings in June. In Bangkok, according to Smith, mating takes place in June. Hatchlings measure 114‚Äì152 mm (4 to 6 in) long, while the smallest gravid female recorded was 1,093 mm (3 ft 7 in) long.  In captivity  In recent years, ornate flying snakes have become increasingly available in the exotic pet trade; many are exported from Vietnam and neighboring countries. Instances of captive breeding are virtually unknown. Due to the species' nervous temperament and difficulty to adjusting to captivity, they tend to make poor captives for all but the most experienced reptile keepers. Many imported specimens have heavy parasite loads, and the stress of captivity all too often leads to a quick death.

He played 18 first-class matches for Victoria, one in 1946, and then more regularly from 1951‚Äì52 to 1953‚Äì54. Born in Footscray, Victoria, Thoms attended Melbourne University, where he opened the batting for Melbourne University Cricket Club with Colin McDonald. He also played first-class cricket for Victoria alongside McDonald, and they both made their Test debut in the fifth Test against West Indies at the Sydney Cricket Ground in January 1952, alongside fellow debutant Richie Benaud. Uniquely, Thoms and McDonald opened the batting together for a Test team, state team, and club team in that season. A solid, rather than spectacular, batsman, he scored 16 and 28. Thoms was dismissed hit wicket in the second innings, treading on the stumps after pulling a Frank Worrell delivery for four. Johnnie Moyes, a pre-eminent cricket historian, wrote hyperbolically of this modest beginning: \\"He was a player of negative qualities, and one gained the impression that a competent leader could close him down to an occasional single for hours at a time, not the type of batsman for whom there could be any international future. It was no surprise that his first Test was also his last.\\"Moyes: Australian Batsmen, p. 161. His top score was 150 for Victoria against Western Australia in Perth in the first match of the 1951‚Äì52 season. He also scored 120 later in the season, against Queensland in Melbourne, and finished the Sheffield Shield season with 521 runs at 57.88.Wisden 1953, pp. 845‚Äì61. He also made a century, 140, against Tasmania in Hobart in 1953‚Äì54. He played his last first-class match in 1953‚Äì54 at 26. Thoms retired from representative cricket to concentrate on his medical career, fearful that a hand injury could end his ambitions as a surgeon. He is thought to be the only Test cricketer to have been a gynaecologist. He introduced laser surgery to Australia in the 1970s and was awarded the Order of Australia Medal in 1996. Jim Thoms, his elder brother, was a noted Australian rules footballer and national table tennis champion. During 1950 and 1951 Thoms was a member of the VFL Umpires Association and field umpired 16 matches of Australian football in various country leagues across Victoria. He also officiated in a single VFL Second Eighteens (later VFL Reserve Grade) match in June 1951. He attended a reunion of 150 Australian Test cricketers in Sydney on 11 July 2003. He died a few weeks later, in Melbourne, Victoria.

He was educated at the Anglican Church Grammar School and played in 19 Tests from 1953 to 1956. He was the younger brother of Ken Archer, who also played Test cricket for Australia. A highly gifted all rounder, Archer's career was cruelly cut short by a serious knee injury in the one-off Test against Pakistan in Karachi in 1956 when he was just 23. A permanent fixture in the team from his debut against South Africa at Melbourne in 1952‚Äì53 until stricken by injury in 1956 Archer was a stylish middle order batsman and robust opening bowler. When England toured Australia in 1954‚Äì55 he topped the Australian bowling averages with 13 wickets (16.53). In the 2nd Test at Sydney he took 3‚Äì12 and 3‚Äì53 and his 49 was the highest score in the Australian first innings. After a slow start he excelled on the West Indian tour of 1955, recording 84 in Trinidad, 98 at Bridgetown and a maiden test hundred at Kingston to finish the series with 364 runs at 60.66. Showcasing his all round talent he took 18 wickets at 25.05 in England in 1956 but fell injured in Pakistan on the way home. He played in 1958‚Äì59 as a specialist batsmen but though he averaged over 40 for Queensland his knee would not allow him to continue in the game. After retiring from the playing field he worked as a TV executive, became Cricket Australia's Code of Behaviour Commissioner and officiated as an International Cricket Council match referee. He was made a life member of the Queensland Cricket Association for his services to cricket. Cricket Australia Chairman Creagh O'Connor paid the following tribute \\"Ron Archer had a brief and very successful Test career which was tragically cut short by an injury of the type that modern sports medicine would today probably have overcome...But while his international playing career was too short, he still devoted an energetic and cheerful lifetime of support to the game that he loved, contributing right up until his final summer.\\" On 12 June 1995, Archer was named a Member of the Order of Australia in recognition of services to the community, cricket and business. On 14 July 2000, Archer was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his cricketing achievements. In 2009 Archer was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.

Rick Tyler made his live-action debut in Stargirl portrayed by Cameron Gellman. Fictional character biography =Childhood= Rick Tyler was born the child of Rex Tyler, who was a successful hero and a business man. However, Rex wasn't a very good father, something he later admitted and regretted. When Rex wasn't spending time with business, he was out doing his superhero work, as addicted to it as he was to the substance that powered him, Miraclo. This meant that Rick rarely saw his dad, even on his birthdays, and eventually Rex wasn't even sure of the age of his son. It was no surprise that although Rick would develop into a well- balanced teen, he was consistently looking for his father's guidance and approval. Yet, Rex could not see the role model Rick really needed, and he tried to push Rick's education to its limits, an endeavor that Rick didn't wish to pursue, and he constantly felt inferior to his father. =Infinity Inc.= Rick became the second Hourman when the Crisis on Infinite Earths threatened all of reality, and he used one of his dad's Miraclo pills to save the life of Beth Chapel, whom he grew quite fond of. His father strongly disapproved of Rick's actions, knowing the addictive effects of Miraclo and tried to prevent Rick from taking up the Hourman mantle. Nonetheless, Rick ended up trying to join a team of other 2nd generation heroes known as Infinity, Inc. Rex was able to temporarily convince his son not to, although Rick continued to try to persuade him. Matters became worse however when Rex, along with his teammates in the Justice Society of America sacrificed themselves to fight eternal Ragnarok in Limbo. When Northwind and Beth Chapel came to tell him of the news, Rick ran away in grief. He was later kidnapped by the new group Justice Unlimited, themselves former members of the Injustice Society and used as a hostage against Infinity Inc. Rick was able to escape, but in the process, seemingly killed the Wizard. Rick had a hard time forgiving himself, although it would later be revealed that the Wizard was in fact still alive. Rick gave up the Hourman identity almost as soon as he assumed it, as he angrily unmasked himself before a press photographer. Luckily, Lyta was able to prevent the photo from being taken and took Rick away, trying to console him. Nonetheless, Rick wore his Hourman outfit another time to attend the court hearing for the villain Mister Bones, although Rick feared he was just as bad as Bones as well, fearing that the Miraclo pills had simply worked on an already violent urge when he killed the Wizard. Eventually though, Rick returned to becoming Hourman, wearing an outfit similar to his father's in honor of him. Shortly afterwards, Infinity Inc. disbanded. =Retired hero and reunion= Eventually, Rex and the rest of the JSA returned from Limbo and he and Rick were reunited. In the meantime however, Rick had contracted leukaemia due to the prolonged exposure to Miraclo. With the help of Rex's old teammate, Johnny Chambers (aka Johnny Quick), both Rex and Rick learned to tap into their superhuman powers without the use of Miraclo and instead using his mind-focusing technique. Father and son would only spend a short time together, when the villain Extant killed Rex and some of his allies from the Justice Society during the event known as Zero Hour. Tragedy kept on striking, when shortly afterwards his sweetheart, Beth Chapel (as Dr. Midnight II) was slain by Eclipso. Rick remained retired from the superhero business for a long time, and in that time he met the new android Hourman. This android had been engineered by his time travelling father from Rex's own DNA. Although Rick intensely disliked the new Hourman, he was saved by the android when he transported Rick into the Timepoint (a place where time stands still), so that he would be spared from an unidentifiable alien illness. The two would grow closer when the android then cured Rick of his cancer and bestowed him two gifts. Due to a tachyon-enhanced hourglass, Rick was now able to occasionally see one hour into the future, as well as being given an hour with his dad in the Timepoint. The Hourman android had plucked Rex out of the timestream before he was killed fighting Extant, placing him in the Timepoint- an area outside of time- for an hour; when Rick was not in the Timepoint, time stood still, but when he entered it he could interact with his father for advice or simple conversation. When the hour in the Timepoint would be up however, Rex would be sent back in time, where he would fight and die. The transportation to the Timepoint would be activated by a button in Rick's Hourman gloves. =The Justice Society= Now cured of all his illnesses, Rick resumed the mantle of Hourman (adopting a new costume in the process), using the non-addictive form of Miraclo, and joined a makeshift JSA in defeating the Ultra-Humanite after he stole Johnny Thunder's Thunderbolt, Rick taking a brief visit to the Timepoint to get his father's advice on how to defeat the powerful genie. Rick remained with the JSA after this battle and began growing close to Jesse Chambers, who was the JSA's business manager and also the superheroine Jesse Quick. Rick is still close to his mother and has a strained relationship with his cousin Rebecca who runs his father's company TylerCo.JSA #5. DC Comics. When the JSA travelled with Hawkman to the Middle Eastern country of Kahndaq to stop Black Adam, Rick was severely injured by one of Nemesis' swords (a member of Adam's gathered group). Realizing that he would die from the massive blood loss unless he was quickly operated on, Rick saw no choice but to transport himself to the Timepoint where his father was. Rick quickly swapped places with his father, and the Timepoint held Rick and his wounds in stasis. Rex was returned to the regular world and was left with no means of returning to the Timepoint or how he could save his son.JSA #8. DC Comics. The answer once again came in the form of the android Hourman, who transported Rex and several other JSA members to the Timepoint, amongst them the latest Doctor Mid-Nite (Pieter Cross), who was able to save Rick's life.JSA #11. DC Comics. The time used to save Rick also meant that Rex's time was up, and that he would have to return to fighting Extant. Rick, however, tried to take his place, so that his father could live again. Instead, the android Hourman sacrificed himself so that both Hourmen may live. Rex retrieved the damaged Hourman parts and is trying to rebuild him, while Rick continues to operate with the JSA.JSA #15. DC Comics. While returning once more to Kahndaq to face the Spectre, Rick's friend Jakeem Thunder tried to trap the Spectre inside his magical pen, but was instead himself thrown into the 5th Dimension. Rick, Mr. Terrific and Stargirl ventured into the 5th Dimension and rescued Jakeem from the thralls of Qwsp.JSA #19. DC Comics. =One Year Later= Rick is part of the newly reformed Justice Society of America and is married to Jesse Chambers, now going by the name Liberty Belle. They were responsible for bringing Damage into the Justice Society of America, and the trio defeated Captain Nazi. =DC Universe= In the \\"Watchmen\\" sequel \\"Doomsday Clock,\\" Hourman appears with the Justice Society after Doctor Manhattan undoes the experiment that erased the Justice Society of America and the Legion of Super-Heroes.Doomsday Clock #12 (December 2019). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Like the original Hourman, Rex Tyler, Rick imbibes the drug, Miraclo, granting him super strength, speed, agility, reflexes, and durability for exactly sixty minutes. The nature of Miraclo's effectiveness has changed in explanation over the years, at times being described as a mega- vitamin, a steroid, a chemical enhancement, meta-gene enabler, and a placebo covering the release of metahuman potential. The latter, proposed by Johnny Quick, was generally dismissed by the Tylers. The effectiveness of Miraclo varies based on the subject's age, physical conditioning, and frequency of use. Rick's description of his abilities rarely matched their depiction; while he described his strength as the combined effort of five Olympic-level athletes, he was shown doing considerably more. Based on depictions, under its effects, Rick experienced the ability to lift/press 10 tons, run at speeds of 65 miles/hour, agility to leap from windows as high as three stories, reflexes enough to spar with super-speedsters, and durability to withstand superhuman blows. Generally, Rick used a single Miraclo pill for action based on the dosages created by his father; however, the drug is more potent in larger doses, though it lasts a fraction of the time. During an attack on the android hourman, a dual dose lasted Rick only ten minutes, but enhanced the regular effects by a substantial margin, allowing him to keep up with the android, albeit temporarily. Once the one hour time period is over, the drug metabolizes into the user's system. Repeated dosages have limited, if any effect, until approximately 23 hours have passed, at which point the drug's effects return to full potency. Rick, like his father Rex, often noticed that usage carried psychologically addictive properties, even if physical addition was not an issue. Because of the 'rush' from having enhanced abilities, especially when used in conjunction with a superhero lifestyle, the period following usage was coupled by a feeling of disappointment, insecurity, and an eagerness to reach the next effective dose. Rick struggled with this until joining the re-formed Justice Society. After reconciling with the android Hourman from the future, he was given a special hourglass that caused him to experience random visions of one hour in the future. The visions were extremely detailed and gave him information covering approximately one hour of time taking place one hour in the future; this process was temporarily painful, but granted a strategic advantage and allowed Rick to time his doses more effectively, allowing his \\"hour of power\\" to cover the entirety of the crisis contained in the vision. The hourglass on his chest was once able to take him to a limbo chamber at Timepoint, but this ability has been used up. Without Miraclo, Hourman is no more powerful than a regular human. He can only use one dose of Miraclo a day, as its long term abuse may prove detrimental for his health. Hourman's Miraclo is dispensed directly into his bloodstream by the hourglass amulets embedded in his costume's gauntlets. Other versions In 2011, \\"The New 52\\" rebooted the DC universe. The Earth-2 version of Rick Tyler/Hourman was introduced in the sixth issue of Earth 2: Society. He is depicted as a villain and works alongside Jimmy Olsen (Doctor Impossible), Johnny Sorrow, and Anarky. Three months prior to the series, Rick broke into Waynecorp to retrieve Thomas Wayne's Miraclo supplies which he used when operating as Batman. Rick is motivated by revenge and views Thomas Wayne as a thief for taking his father's Miraclo which was the only thing that could've saved his family. Jimmy Olsen helps him escape and the two decide to work together to achieve Jimmy's goal. Present day, Hourman arrives to fight Batman, Flash, and Superman. Using Miraclo, Rick was able to hold out on his own and fight the Wonders.Earth 2: Society #6. DC Comics. Flash was able to disarm Hourman of his Miraclo as the heroes discovered that this was a diversion so that Doctor Impossible can raid Wayne Tower.Earth 2: Society #7. DC Comics. Hourman later appears as a minion of Kyle Nimbus at the time when Batman raids Nimbus solutions. Batman had to dodge Hourman's attacks. When Nimbus is unaffected by Batman's batarang and throws it back at him, Hourman is left to finish the job as Batman calls for Red Arrow and Ted Grant.Earth 2: Society #10. DC Comics. By the time Red Arrow and Ted Grant have arrived, they find that Batman has defeated Hourman. While revealing that he dosed Hourman with something to counter the Miracloe, Batman stated that he also removed the mind-control that Nimbus used on the Miraclo that Hourman just used.Earth 2: Society #11. DC Comics. After noting that Hourman has a bad taste in paymasters, Dick Grayson hired Hourman to help make the world better. He accepted and helped in the fight against Ultra-Humanite.Earth 2: Society #12. DC Comics. In other media * Hourman has made background appearances as a member of the expanded Justice League in the animated TV show Justice League Unlimited. This version is said to be Rick Tyler. In the episode \\"Panic in the Sky\\", he can be seen injecting Miraclo via a button on the wrist of his gauntlet, the same way Rick does in the comics. * Rick Tyler appears in the DC Universe streaming service series Stargirl portrayed by Cameron Gellman and Boston Pierce as a seven-year-old. This version uses a special hourglass amulet that gives them superpowers for one full hour. In his early life, Rick Tyler was raised by his Uncle Matt after his parents Rex and Wendi were killed in a car accident outside of Blue Valley and later became a delinquent at Blue Valley High School. In the episode \\"Hourman and Dr. Mid-Nite,\\" Rick learns Solomon Grundy killed his parents and his father was the hero Hourman. Seeking vengeance for his parents, he took up his father's mantle and amulet and joined Stargirl's Justice Society. In addition, Pat Dugan gives him Rex's journal for Rick to decipher so they can foil the Injustice Society's plans. In the season one finale, \\"Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.\\", Rick confronts and defeats Grundy, but chooses to spare the zombie's life and let him go. ** Ahead of the series premiere, Rick made a cameo appearance in the Arrowverse crossover, \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\".

De Courcy was a dashing right-handed middle-order batsman who played for New South Wales for 10 years from the 1947-48 season. A regular as a specialist batsman in the state side from 1949‚Äì50, he did not make a first-class century until late in the 1951-52 season, when he hit 114 against South Australia in the Sheffield Shield match at Sydney. That remained his highest score in Australia, though he added a second domestic cricket century the following season, 1952‚Äì53, in the match against Victoria at Melbourne. The 1952-53 season was de Courcy's most successful in Australian cricket, with 503 runs at an average of 41.91 runs per innings. He was picked as an extra batsman for the 1953 tour of England, and outside the Test series on the tour was one of the most successful batsmen in first-class matches, scoring 1214 runs at an average of 41.86. His four centuries on the tour were the four highest scores of his career, and were headed by 204 in an end-of-season match against Combined Services, when he was outdone by 262 not out from Keith Miller, with whom he shared a partnership of 377 in 205 minutes for the fourth wicket. De Courcy's mid-season form saw him brought into the Test side for the Third Test at Old Trafford. He was, said Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, \\"brim full of confidence\\" and he made 41 in quick time, though some of his strokes \\"flew perilously over the fielders\\". He retained his place in the Test team for the final two matches of The Ashes series, but added only 40 more runs in five innings, one of them not out. De Courcy had a good season for New South Wales in 1953-54, improving his batting average to 49.00, though failing to score a century. He did not do well in matches for an Australian XI or New South Wales against the MCC side in 1954-55 and had a poor season in first-class cricket, failing to retain his Test or state place. He made single appearances in each of the next three seasons before retiring into grade cricket in the Newcastle area. According to his obituary in Wisden, he was a taciturn man who earned the nickname \\"Words.\\" He was a boilermaker by trade.

Pulling Traditionally, fibre optic cables were pulled through cable ducts in the same way as other cables, via a winch line. Every time the fibre passes a bend or undulation in the duct, the pulling force is multiplied by a friction- dependent factor (which can be reduced by using lubricantCable Pulling Lubricants polywater.com ). This means that the higher the local pulling force is, the more friction the cable will experience while being pulled against the internal duct wall. This \\"capstan effect\\" Mechanics of Friction in Rope Rescue jree.org leads to an exponential force build-up with pull distance, producing generally high pulling forces. Jetting Cable jetting is the process of blowing a cable through a duct while simultaneously pushing the cable into the duct. Compressed air is injected at the duct inlet and flows through the duct and along the cable at high speed. (Preferably, no suction pig is used at the cable head.) The high speed air propels the cable due to drag forces and pressure drop. The friction of the cable against the duct is reduced by the distributed airflow, and large forces that would generate high friction are avoided. Because of the expanding airflow, the air propelling forces are relatively small at the cable inlet and large at the air exhaust end of the duct. To compensate for this, an additional pushing force is applied to the cable by the jetting equipment. The pushing force, acting mainly near the cable inlet, combined with the airflow propelling forces, increases the maximum jetting distance considerably. Special lubricants have been developed for cable jetting to further reduce friction.http://www.polywater.com/blowing.asp Advantages of jetting compared to pulling # Longer installation distances can be reached # Installation distance less dependent on bends and undulations in duct # Forces exerted on the cable are lower # Easier use jet in tandem operation # The step of installing a winch rope is avoided # Equipment is needed only at one end of the duct route Practice Banglalink performing cable-jetting at Shantinagar, Dhaka. Couplers are shown for optical fibers and polyethylene ducts. In the 21st century the cable jetting technique is used worldwide, from small optical telecom cables (1.8 mm diameter) in small microducts (3 mm internal diameter) up to large copper telecom cables (35 mm diameter) in large ducts (50 mm internal diameter). Jetting is done with a pressure of the compressed air in the order of 10 bar. With the jetting technique distances per blow of 3.5 km have been reached , while spliceless links of 12 km have been reached by placing jetting equipment in tandem. It is possible to install 12 km in one day with one small crew. In mid 1990s the technique was also developed to install multiple smaller microducts, bundles, into a larger duct in one installation. This is called multi-ducting, microduct cabling, or bundle blowing. Each can hold a cable. Another capability is to install a single cable or a bundle of small ducts into an occupied duct. The most expensive activity in installing a network is the need for civil works. Thus, re-using ducts occupied with one cable, leaving some space, is a tempting and often possible and cost-effective alternative. History The technique of installing flexible and lightweight fibre optic units using compressed air was developed during the 1980s by British Telecom.http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX;=EP0186753&F;=0&QPN;=EP0186753 This early version of jetting did not use additional pushing.

She has to acclimate herself to the customs of the Chinese Ghost Month, during which she struggles with supernatural forces. The maid is employed by a Teochew opera family, a family with many secrets, who give her a place to stay in their dilapidated shophouse. The film broke the box office record in Singapore for the horror genre, making S$700,000 on its opening weekend. It won the European Fantastic Film Festival Federation (EFFFF) Asian Film Award at the 10th Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival (PiFan). The EFFFF Asian Film Award is a prize awarded to the best Asian film of the year by the federation, of which PiFan is a supporting member. It stars Alessandra de Rossi, Hong Huifang, Benny Soh, Guan Zhenwei and Chen Shucheng, a veteran actor-compere.  Plot  During the Chinese Seventh Month, the gates of hell open and spiritual forces are set loose upon the unsuspecting world. Hailing from a small village in the Philippines, 18-year-old Rosa Dimaano arrives in Singapore on the first day of the Seventh Month to work as a domestic maid. She urgently needs money to save her younger brother who is ill back home. Her employers, the elderly Mr. and Mrs. Teo, appear kindhearted and sympathetic. Their mentally handicapped son Ah Soon also takes to Rosa immediately. Between cleaning house and helping the Teos out at their Teochew opera workplace, things start going seriously amiss. Rosa glimpses strange apparitions at night and also has vivid nightmares. She finds out that there was a maid two years before her called Esther. She apparently has the same good relationship with Ah Soon as she does. That is when Rosa begins to suspect things are seriously wrong. As she explores around some of the shady areas of the house, she discovers the burnt corpse of Esther, the previous maid hidden in a concealed drum and through a ghostly vision that Esther's spirit shows her realizes that Esther was playing with Ah Soon in his room two years ago on that same day of the Ghost Festival when he suddenly, though unintentionally, raped her on the bed. When the parents witnessed this, they prevented Esther from calling police so Mr. Teo beat her to the ground, bundled her up and poured oil all over her before setting her on fire, burning her to death. Frightened by the vision, Rosa tries to escape but gets abducted and double-crossed when she is suddenly confronted by Ah Soon. She quickly finds out that Ah Soon is also a ghost himself when she tries to stab him only to realize that the man would not show a scar or any visible wound. In the past, Ah Soon committed suicide shortly after the death of Esther but instead of passing to the afterlife, he chose to return to the house to find the spirit of Esther, whom he was in love with. From behind her, Mr. Teo knocks Rosa unconscious and ties her up. When Rosa awakens, she is told by Mrs. Teo that the Teo family has long believed that ghosts can also marry and their whole motive for inviting her to Singapore was to sacrifice her so that she would be wed to their dead son. But when they try to hang Rosa, Ah Soon suddenly remembers the way his father brutally murdered Esther the year before and tells his parents that he does not want to see any more deaths in the house. In a scuffle, Ah Soon accidentally pushes Mr. Teo into an altar, spilling oil on him. Esther's spirit then ignites the oil, burning him to death. Rosa manages to break free with the help of Esther's spirit and tries to escape. Mrs. Teo picks up a knife and tries to finish her off once and for all. Rosa dashes out of the house and crosses the road with Mrs. Teo close behind. Rosa stumbles and falls on the other side of the road, but as Mrs. Teo approaches her menacingly with the knife in hand, an oncoming truck hits Mrs. Teo and kills her instantly. Rosa breathes a sigh of relief as the camera pans over Mrs. Teo's dead body. In the final sequence, Rosa is seen heading to the airport to fly back to her hometown on the last day of July when the gates of hell are closing. She takes with her the jar containing Esther's ashes as she enters the airport while the ghosts of the Teo family watches her disappear beyond the doors.

The impounded reservoir is called Advancetown Lake. ‚Äî includes a map Hinze Dam was named in honour of local pioneers Carl and Johanna Hinze (grandparents of Queensland politician Russ Hinze) who lived in the valley that was flooded by the dam. Location and features Dam wall, 2016 The dam is located in Advancetown, south-west of Nerang immediately downstream of the confluence of the Nerang River and Little Nerang Creek. Open space, following completion of Stage 2 upgrade The earthfill dam structure is high and long. The dam wall holds back the reservoir when at full capacity. From a catchment area of that includes the Numinbah Valley and Springbrook Plateau, with most being contained within state forests and national parks, the dam creates Advancetown Lake, with a surface area of . The uncontrolled un-gated spillway, located at above sea level, has a discharge capacity of . Initially managed by the Gold Coast City Council up until 2008, the dam is now managed by Seqwater. The dam also provides the benefit of flood mitigation to populated areas along the Nerang River downstream of the dam. =Construction= Hinze Dam spillway, following Stage 3 upgrade The Southport Town Council planned the dam in 1947. It was completed in 1976 and expanded in 1989 and 2011. Stage One was completed in 1976, and provided of potable water storage and supply. Stage Two was completed in 1989, when storage of potable water was increased to . This stage was completed at a cost of 42 million and involved raising the main embankment, spillway and intake towers by approximately to create a surface area of . In 2004 the Gold Coast City Council resolved to construct Stage 3 of the dam. When the dam reached full capacity, on 7 January 2008 work began on Stage 3 and was completed on 19 December 2011. After nearly four years of construction the construction cost was 395 million. The Stage 3 works increased the height of the dam wall from to , and increased the reservoir capacity from to , with the added purpose of flood mitigation, beyond water supply. Stage 3 construction was completed by the Hinze Dam Alliance, a joint venture between Seqwater, with private sector partners URS Corporation, Sinclair Knight Merz and Thiess. The additional works with a higher dam wall provided homes below the dam wall with flood protection from a 1974 Brisbanestyle flood event. The eastern boat ramp is located in Mudgeeraba and features a craft and paddle launching platform as well as toilets and bin facilities. The western boat ramp, located in Springbrook, contains the same amenities with a smaller car park. In 2012 a body was discovered by fishermen. Recreation Advancetown Lake is a popular recreational facility for Gold Coast residents. Since the Stage 3 upgrade, recreational activities allowed include walking, electric or manual-powered boating, fishing, biking and horse riding. The facilities are open from 6 am to 6 pm daily. No camping is permitted around the lake. Dogs are also not permitted, while swimming has been strongly discouraged. An interpretive centre was opened on 19 December 2011, along with new parking, walking trails, toilet facilities and barbecue areas. The Hinze Dam spillway overflows for the first time since the Stage 3 upgrade was completed, after heavy rain from Cyclone Oswald in January 2013 The final design of the dam was criticised in the media and by residents and politicians, some describing it as a \\"concrete bunker\\". The criticism arose because of a reduction in playground, boating and barbecue facilities; the banning of dogs; the extensive use of concrete; and because many of the facilities are either far from the water's edge or below the dam wall with no water views. Advancetown Lake has two boat ramps, one on the western and another on the eastern side. =Fishing= The dam is stocked with Mary River cod, silver perch, golden perch, southern saratoga and bass, while spangled perch are also present naturally. Banded grunter have been found in the lake and being illegally introduced, it is recommended that, if caught, they should be destroyed. A Gold Coast City Council permit is required to fish in the dam. A Queensland State Government Stocked Impoundment Permit is not required. From December 2018, Queensland Health advise not to consume fish from Hinze Dam due to elevated levels of mercury in recent fish samples. =2018 Commonwealth Games= The Gold Coast hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The area surrounding the Hinze Dam was originally proposed as the location for the mountain bike competition. A new course was constructed to meet international competition requirements. Some government representatives as well as some mountain bikers have sought to have the competition moved away to the unsecured trails at Nerang State Forest. The Gold Coast Mountain Bike Club maintain the course and sometimes host a race on the circuit the first Sunday of each month.

Accident details N7030U, the aircraft involved in the accident Flight 227, operated by a Boeing 727-22, registration departed LaGuardia Airport at 0835 Mountain Standard Time (1035 EST) for San Francisco, California, with scheduled stops in Cleveland, Chicago, Denver, and Salt Lake City. The flight to Denver was routine. In Denver a new flight crew took control of the plane: Captain Gale C. Kehmeier, First Officer Philip E. Spicer, and Second Officer Ronald R. Christensen. The flight took off from Denver at 1654 MST. During the flight, the First Officer was flying the aircraft under the direction of the Captain. At 1735 the plane was cleared to descend to 16,000 feet by the Salt Lake City Air Route Traffic Control Center. At 1747, now under the direction of terminal control, the plane was cleared to approach. At 1748, in response to the controller's request for the plane's altitude, the pilot replied \\"Okay we've slowed to two fifty (knots) and we're at ten (10,000 feet) we have the runway in sight now, we'll cancel and standby with your for traffic.\\" The plane began to descend, but its rate of descent was approximately 2,300 feet per minute, nearly three times the recommended rate of descent. At approximately 1749:30, the plane passed the outer marker 5.7 miles from the runway threshold at approximately 8,200 feet, over 2,000 feet above the normal glideslope. At approximately 1751, one minute prior to impact, the plane passed 6,300 feet; it was still 1,300 feet above the normal glide slope and still descending at 2,300 feet per minute. Around this time the first officer reached forward to advance the thrust levers to increase thrust, but the captain brushed his hand aside and said \\"Not yet.\\" At 30 seconds prior to impact the plane was 1,000 feet above and 1.25 miles from the runway. The captain indicated in post-crash interviews that at this point he moved the thrust levers to the takeoff power position, but the engines failed to respond properly. However, both the testimonies of the other members of the flight crew and the data from the flight data recorder indicate that the attempt to add power occurred only about 10 seconds before impact. At 1752 the plane struck the ground 335 feet short of the runway. The aircraft slid 2,838 feet before coming to a stop. The separation of the landing gear and the No. 1 engine was the result of impact loading in excess of their design structural strength. The failure of the landing gear caused the rupture of fuel lines in the fuselage. The resulting fire, rather than the impact of the crash, accounted for all 43 fatalities. Investigation conclusions This accident was blamed entirely on the bad judgment of the Captain, Gale C. Kehmeier, for conducting the final approach from a position that was too high and too close to the airport to permit a descent at the normal and safe rate. He allowed the plane to fly the final approach segment (in visual conditions) at a descent rate of 2,300 feet per minute (3 times the safe descent rate). When the plane crossed the outer marker, which marks the final approach segment, it was 2,000 feet too high. The First Officer, who was flying the aircraft under the Captain's direction, attempted to add engine thrust. But the Captain told him no and brushed his hands off the thrust levers. The Captain took over the controls during the last few seconds, but it was too late to avoid crashing short of the runway. The plane impacted with a vertical acceleration force of 14.7-g. That severe impact force broke off the left main landing gear and caused the right main gear to thrust up through the fuselage, rupturing pressurized fuel lines in the process. While the plane continued to slide down the runway on the nose gear and fuselage, pressurized fuel ignited inside the cabin, turning a survivable accident into a fatal accident. Many of the 50 people who successfully evacuated were severely burned. The CAB (Civil Aeronautics Board) accident investigation revealed that the Captain had a checkered training history. He had failed his initial jet transition training course, and was returned to flying the DC-6. Later on, he also failed to pass a routine annual instrument proficiency check.

Biography Holland, gold florin or 'Beiersgulden' with St John the Baptist, struck 1421-1422 by John of Bavaria. John was born in Le Quesnoy. He was the youngest son of Duke Albert I and Margaret of Brieg. His elder brother was William II of Bavaria, who succeeded their father as Count of Holland, Zeeland and Hainault in 1404. His sister was Margaret of Bavaria, who married in 1385 with John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy. As the youngest son of three, John was destined for a career in the church. At the age of 15, he became Prince- Bishop of Li√®ge, with the support of Pope Boniface IX. John's rule was a disaster. His authoritarian style clashed with the nobles and burghers of the Prince-Bishopric. He was expelled several times and saw even a counter-bishop being elected. John turned for help to his brother and brother-in-law. In 1408 a Burgundian army led by his brother-in-law John the Fearless went to the aid of John III against the citizens of Li√®ge, who were in open revolt. On the field of Oth√©e, on 12 September 1408, the men of Li√®ge were decisively defeated, and Burgundian influence was extended over the city and over the bishopric of Li√®ge. The ensuing executions of leading insurgents led to John's nickname \\"the Pitiless\\". When his brother died in 1417 and was succeeded by his daughter Jacqueline as Countess of Holland and Hainaut and Duchess of Bavaria-Straubing, John the Pitiless rejected holy orders and surrendered his bishopric. In 1418, John III married Elisabeth, Duchess of Luxembourg, who was then the widow of Antoine, Duke of Brabant. No children came from this marriage. With the aid of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, who was his wife's uncle, John III immediately started a civil war against his niece Jacqueline and her husband Duke John IV of Brabant. John the Pitiless supported the city of Dordrecht and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy. A siege of Dordrecht in 1419 was unsuccessful, so John IV of Brabant agreed to start a joint administration with John III. Jacqueline herself as a woman, did not get a share in the political responsibility. John IV of Brabant finally gave up Holland and Hainaut and left the rule to John the Pitiless. His niece Jacqueline went to England in 1421 and married the king's brother, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester.Alfred H.Burne, \\"The Hundred Years War\\" (1st ed., 1955; Folio Society 2005), 371-2 She was unable to retain control over Holland and Hainaut much longer after John's death. John the Pitiless was known for the rich culture of his court; Jan van Eyck was among the artists he engaged, from at least 1422 until 1424. John the Pitiless died of poison in 1425 in The Hague. His Court Marshal Jan van Vliet had allegedly poisoned the pages of the ducal prayer-book, and had already been executed in 1424. Bavaria-Straubing was divided between the dukes of Bavaria, the major portion of which went to Bavaria-Munich.

Synopsis Chicken Rice War is loosely based on William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In this movie the Montagues and Capulets are represented by the families Wong and Chan. Both families run Chicken Rice stalls side by side in the same market, something that the authorities say is impossible, since it is not allowed.

Biography  A right-hand opening batsman, he made 155 for New South Wales against the MCC at Sydney in 1954-55 in his second first-class match. Largely on the strength of that innings, and after only four first-class matches, he was selected in the Sydney Test that began on 25 February 1955, opening with Colin McDonald. He made only 18 and 3, but managed to impress selectors enough that he was picked for the West Indies tour a few weeks later. Although he scored 122 against Barbados, Watson failed to find form against the West Indians in the Tests, scoring 27, 6, 22 not out, 30 and 0, and was dropped after the Fourth Test. He scored strongly for New South Wales in the 1956-57 domestic season, with 664 runs at 44.26. The season included his highest score, 206, at number five, in an innings victory over Western Australia in Perth, and, opening the batting again, 50 and 198 against Queensland in Sydney. He was selected for an Australian team that toured New Zealand at the end of the season, but made only 23 runs in four first-class matches and was overlooked for selection on the tour to South Africa in 1957-58. In 14 matches in the next four seasons, he made only 450 runs at 25.00, and he retired after the 1960-61 season.

Located in the suburb of Doncaster, it is 120 metres above sea level and has uninterrupted views of the city, Port Phillip, Macedon Ranges, the You Yang Ranges and Dandenong Ranges. The hill experienced extensive low-density urban development during the 1960s and 70s, consisting of typical detached suburban dwellings. The surrounding transport infrastructure is heavily reliant on private automobiles. The City of Manningham has enacted policies to encourage high-density development atop the hill, however it lacks a holistic policy and incentives scheme to properly encourage sustainable urban development and transit-oriented development. As a result, the housing available is generally marketed to higher income earners and are of low practical quality. Government planning strategies The Doncaster Hill Precinct strategy is a 20-year, A$2 billion proposal created by the City of Manningham for the area. The precinct identified by the strategy is located from Melbourne's central business district. It is situated close to main arterial roads, including the Eastern Freeway, but is poorly served by public transport, with access to only buses. The strategy aims to create an urban village which reduces urban sprawl that would otherwise place pressure on natural environments in the green wedges to the precinct's east. The proposal includes both residential and commercial developments. Streetscapes, parks, transport and planning schemes are all being improved and amended as part of the proposal. Previous developments in the area include the Westfield Doncaster shopping centre, built in 1970 on a site previously occupied by a grocer shop as well as a few medium-density residential buildings. A few projects have already begun on Doncaster Hill, which has so far been limited to residential towers and flats that are built to take advantage of the views. In spite of expensive council promotion, investors are shying away from committing to a proposal that does not include upgraded public transport and parking requirements as well as the difficult topography. The Hill Strategy does not comply with the ideals of the State Planning Department because of its inability to provide walking and bicycling paths. Some investors want to undertake developments like that of Council House 2 in Melbourne's CBD and argue that the Manningham City council's proposal for the Doncaster Hill precinct is dated and should focus more on sustainability to entice investors. Central Melbourne as seen from atop Doncaster Hill =Eastern Golf Club= Slightly down the hill towards the city is the Eastern Golf Club, a golf course which has been proposed to be sold. Although three preservation groups advocate rezoning the land to prevent any redevelopment, if the sale goes through, it could be used to construct a medium-density sustainable urban precinct treating its own waste, collecting its own water and generating its own electricity. Many suggest coupling this potential sustainable land development with the Doncaster Hill precinct to create one of the largest car- free areas in the world in an existing urban environment. However, this is unlikely as it would require large political support. The group Retain Eastern At Doncaster (READ) attempted to present the alternative to relocation which would keep The Eastern Golf Club in its location at Doncaster. Neighbourhood gatherings to show support to the members were held, local government and expert consultation was made and support gained especially from Manningham City Council, MP Mary Wooldridge and Councillors. Provision for water was explored and planned for‚Äîwater was the significant resource needed to build a sustainable future for the club. the club's land has been sold to Mirvac. For information regarding the alternative to relocation, also discussion & support messages. http://easternsupport.bravehost.com/index.html =Doncaster Tower Reconstruction= Many local residents and historical societies have suggested constructing a replica of the original Doncaster Tower atop Doncaster Hill. The proposal suggests it be constructed of reinforced concrete clad in timber to replicate the original construction. This would provide another man-made drawcard to the area, providing 360-degree views of Melbourne and its surrounding environment as well as increased telecommunication installation opportunities. Precincts There are seven proposed precincts in the Doncaster Hill planning strategy. Five of the precincts are residential, one is retail and the other is for civic purposes. =Precinct 1= Precinct 1, or the Civic Precinct, covers the non-residential area off Doncaster Road, near the municipal offices.

He is considered to be one of the best goaltenders in the world by many colleagues, fans, The Hockey News, and EA Sports; and one of the greatest goalies in the history of the Montreal Canadiens by several members of the news media. Beginning his junior career with the Tri-City Americans in the Western Hockey League in 2002, Price was drafted fifth overall by the Montreal Canadiens in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft following his second season with the Tri-City Americans. Following a further two seasons with the Americans, where he won both the Del Wilson Trophy as the top goaltender in the Western Hockey League (WHL) and CHL Goaltender of the Year in his final season of major junior in 2007. Joining the Canadiens' farm team, the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League (AHL) just as the Calder Cup playoffs begun, Price led the Bulldogs to the Calder Cup championship, winning the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the tournament MVP. Price made the Canadiens roster for the 2007‚Äì08 season as the backup goaltender before ultimately becoming the starting goaltender later that season. In 2015, he was the winner of the Ted Lindsay, Jennings, Vezina and Hart trophies, becoming the first goaltender in NHL history to win all four individual awards in the same season. Internationally, Price has represented Canada at various tournaments at junior levels, winning silver medals at the World U-17 Hockey Challenge in 2004 and the IIHF World U18 Championship in 2005. He won a gold medal at the 2007 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Sweden. In 2014, Price was named to the Canadian Olympic Hockey Team and won a gold medal at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Price's play also earned him the tournament's top goaltending award, from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) directorate. In 2016 Price went undefeated to win his first World Cup of Hockey championship. Early life Carey Price was born in Vancouver to Lynda and Jerry Price. His mother is the former chief of the Ulkatcho First Nation. His father was also a goaltender; he was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the eighth round, 126th overall, in the 1978 NHL Amateur Draft. Although Jerry never played in the NHL, he did play four seasons of professional hockey in various leagues and was for a time the goaltending coach of the Tri-City Americans. Price has a sister, Kayla, and his second cousin is fellow ice hockey player Shane Doan. When Price was three, his family moved to the remote town of Anahim Lake in northern British Columbia where he was raised. He was taught to play goaltender by his father on a frozen creek during the winter months and played organized hockey in Williams Lake over five hours and away by car on Highway 20. Having to make the ten-hour round trip three days a week, Carey's father bought a plane to fly him to practice and games. Growing up, Price's favourite NHL team was the Edmonton Oilers and he idolized Marty Turco and Patrick Roy. Playing career =Tri-City Americans= Price made his first appearance in the Western Hockey League (WHL) in a single game for the Tri-City Americans during the 2002‚Äì03 season. He then made the Tri-City roster the next season, appearing in 28 games as the backup for Colorado Avalanche prospect Tyler Weiman, posting a 2.38 Goals against average (GAA) and .915 save percentage. The next season, Price took over as the primary starter of the team and established himself as a top goaltender, playing in a league-high 63 games with a 2.34 GAA and .920 save percentage and eight shutouts, both in the league top ten. Ranking as the best North American goaltender by NHL Central Scouting, Price was drafted fifth overall by the Montreal Canadiens, a move considered surprising by many who thought Price would not be drafted until the middle of the first round. During the 2005‚Äì06 season, Price's play in Tri-City suffered considerably and he ended the season with a 2.87 GAA and a .906 save percentage while starting 55 games. Price rebounded the next season with a very strong 2006‚Äì07 season, posting an excellent 2.45 GAA and .917 save percentage while winning both the Del Wilson Trophy as the top WHL goaltender and the CHL Goaltender of the Year award. Despite this, the Americans were eliminated in 6 games during the 2007 playoffs. =Hamilton Bulldogs= Price playing for the Hamilton Bulldogs during the 2007 Calder Cup finals Following Tri-City's early playoff exit, later that spring, Price joined the Montreal Canadiens farm team, the Hamilton Bulldogs, just before the start of the 2007 Calder Cup playoffs. In two regular season appearances with the Bulldogs, Price allowed only three goals and won one game. Price led the Bulldogs on a remarkable run that spring, defeating the Hershey Bears four games to one in the finals as the team won their first Calder Cup. Price became only the third teenage goaltender to win the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as AHL playoff MVP, posting a 2.06 GAA and .936 save percentage. =Montreal Canadiens (2007‚Äìpresent)= Price made his highly anticipated Canadiens debut on October 10, 2007, against the Pittsburgh Penguins and recorded 26 saves in a 3‚Äì2 win. After the first month of the season, he was awarded the Canadiens' Molson Cup for October, given to the player with the most first-star selections. Although reassigned to the Hamilton Bulldogs midway through the season in January, he was called back up shortly over a month later. With the trading of starting goaltender Cristobal Huet to the Washington Capitals before the trading deadline, Price assumed the starting role for the Canadiens. He was subsequently named the NHL Rookie of the Month for March and the NHL First Star of the Week (ending April 6, 2008) as the Canadiens finished first overall in the Eastern Conference and earned their first division title since 1991‚Äì92. Price completed the regular season leading all rookie goaltenders in wins (24), save percentage (.920) and shutouts (3). He was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team in recognition for his accomplishments in his first year in the NHL. Price warming up prior to a game in the season. Entering the playoffs against the Boston Bruins, Price recorded a 1‚Äì0 win on April 15, 2008, becoming the first Canadiens rookie to post a playoff shutout since Patrick Roy in 1986. He would go on to record another shutout in game seven to eliminate Boston. Montreal lost in the second round to the Philadelphia Flyers with Price losing 3 of the last 4 games. After a strong start to the 2008‚Äì09 season, in which he earned a second Molson Cup in November, Price injured his ankle on December 30, 2008. Forced out of action for nearly a month, during which he was voted in as a starting goalie for the 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal (along with teammates Alexei Kovalev, Andrei Markov and Mike Komisarek) he made his return to action on January 20, 2009, after backup Jaroslav Hal√°k was pulled in a 4‚Äì2 loss to the Atlanta Thrashers. Going into the 2009 playoffs as the eighth and final seed, the Canadiens played the Boston Bruins in the opening round for the second consecutive season. They were swept in four games, with the Bruins scoring at least four times in each game. In the final game at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Price surrendered four goals in two periods. After stopping a weak dump-in, the crowd cheered sarcastically and Price responded by putting his arms up in the air, similar to Patrick Roy's gesture on December 2, 1995, in a game after which Roy requested a trade from the Canadiens. Price struggled throughout the 2009‚Äì10 season, winning only 13 games and losing the starting job to Halak as the Canadiens entered the playoffs as the eighth and final seed. Although the Canadiens made a surprise run to the Eastern Conference final, upsetting both the Washington Capitals and Pittsburgh Penguins along the way, Price appeared in only four games, losing one and getting no decision in each of the others, only coming off the bench when the game was out of hand. The highlight of the season for Price was stopping 37 of 38 shots in a 5‚Äì1 win over the Boston Bruins in the Canadiens 100 year anniversary game on December 4, 2009, and the low point was surrendering four goals in his only start of the playoffs. In the summer of 2010, both Price and Hal√°k became restricted free agents and a goaltending debate emerged in Montreal over who would remain with the team ‚Äì the playoff hero Hal√°k or the younger Price. After weeks of media speculation, the Canadiens chose Price, trading Hal√°k to the St. Louis Blues and re-signing Price to a two-year, $5.5 million contract to return to his role as starting goaltender. Price talks to backup Alex Auld in Pittsburgh, March 2011. The 2010‚Äì11 pre-season was a tough start for Price. During the 2010‚Äì11 regular season, however, Price played in 72 games recording new career highs including 38 wins, eight shutouts a 2.35 GAA and a .923 save percentage, and was selected to play in the 2011 NHL All-Star Game. This play from Price allowed the Canadiens to enter the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs. This strong play continued for Price in the playoffs posting a .935 save percentage. It was not enough, however, to lead the Canadiens to victory, as they ultimately fell in seven games in the first round to the Boston Bruins. On October 26, 2011, Price earned his 100th win in his NHL career in his 214th game. A few months later, he participated to his third All-Star Game. The 2011‚Äì12 season, however, did not go well for the Canadiens, and they missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2006‚Äì07 season. Price missed the last 4 games of the season due to a concussion. On July 2, 2012, Price re-signed with the Canadiens on a six-year contract worth US$39 million. During the lock-out shortened 2012‚Äì13 season, Price started the year very well, winning 18 of his first 28 starts as the Canadiens, in stark contrast to the previous season, were one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference, going 29‚Äì14‚Äì5, good enough for second in the conference. Price's play, however, dropped off in the final weeks of the season, going 2‚Äì6 and allowing 27 goals. Nonetheless, the Canadiens went into the playoffs against the seventh seeded Ottawa Senators. In Game 4, with the score tied 2‚Äì2 as the third period came to an end, Price suffered a groin injury and did not return for the overtime period and was replaced by Peter Budaj; the Senators would go on to score and win the game. Price's injury sidelined him for the rest of the series and the Canadiens were eliminated in five games. Price ended the playoffs with a sub-par 3.26 GAA and an .894 save percentage. Price during a practice with the Canadiens during the season. The 2013‚Äì14 season saw Price return to form, recording 34 wins to go along with a career best 2.32 GAA and .927 save percentage, leading the Canadiens to their second 100-point season since 2007‚Äì08 season. The Canadiens entered the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference against the Tampa Bay Lightning, whom they swept in four games, marking Price's first playoff series win since his rookie year. The Montreal Canadiens then faced the President's Trophy-winning Boston Bruins in the second round for the fourth time of Price's NHL career. In contrast to the previous two postseason meetings, the Canadiens upset the Bruins, ousting them in seven games. Following a 4‚Äì2 defeat in Game 5 at TD Garden, Price shut out the Bruins in Game 6 by a score of 4‚Äì0 before stopping 29 shots in a 3‚Äì1 victory in Game 7 to eliminate Boston and advance to the Conference Finals. His and the Canadiens run, however, ended against the New York Rangers. In Game 1 at the Bell Centre, with the Rangers up 2‚Äì0 near the end of the second period, Rangers forward Chris Kreider crashed into Price. He would stay in net for the remainder of the period, allowing two more goals before the intermission. Price was then replaced by backup Peter Budaj in the third period as the Rangers scored three more goals to hammer the Canadiens 7‚Äì2 in Game 1. Price was soon ruled out for the rest of the series with an unspecified lower-body injury, as the Canadiens fell in six games to the Rangers, the second year in-a-row Price had a premature ending to his playoffs due to injury. Price during the 2014‚Äì15 season, in which he won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player. Price would follow up 2014‚Äì15 with the best season of his career, as he would finish the season as the leader of the three leading categories for goaltenders: GAA (1.96), save percentage (.933), and wins (44), all career highs as he would help the Canadiens win the Atlantic Division. That season he would go on to win the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player, the Vezina Trophy as best goaltender, the Ted Lindsay Award as most valuable player as voted by the NHLPA, and the William M. Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed (in a tie with Corey Crawford of the Chicago Blackhawks with 189 goals allowed). He became only the second player in franchise history to win 4 awards in one season. Early in the 2015‚Äì16 season, Price suffered a knee injury. At the time of injury, he was expected to return after six weeks. However, on April 6, 2016, the Canadiens announced that Price would not return for the 2015‚Äì16 season. The extent of Price's injury was revealed to be a medial collateral ligament injury (MCL sprain). At the beginning of the 2016‚Äì17 season, Price became the first NHL goalie to win his first 10 games of the season. On July 2, 2017, it was announced that Price signed an eight-year contract extension with an annual cap hit of US$10.5 million totalling to US$84 million for the entire contract. His new contract will run through the 2025‚Äì26 season. This will make Price the highest paid goaltender in the 2018‚Äì2019 NHL season, surpassing goaltender Henrik Lundqvist. After a dismal month at the start of the 2017‚Äì18 NHL season Price was out for the count with a minor lower body injury, leaving goalies Al Montoya and Charlie Lindgren to take his place. On February 22, 2018, Price was rule out indefinitely after sustaining a concussion in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers. On March 19, 2018, Price returned from his concussion and dressed for the first time in 13 games for a game against the Florida Panthers. Despite his injuries, Price made in his 557th career NHL start for the Canadiens on April 3, 2018, surpassing the previous franchise record holder Jacques Plante. On October 27, 2018, after a 3‚Äì0 win over the Boston Bruins, Price surpassed Patrick Roy for second place in Montreal Canadiens franchise career wins with his 290th career victory. Price was named to the 2019 National Hockey League All-Star Game, his sixth All-Star nomination, but he chose to defer due to a lower-body injury. On March 12, 2019, after a 3‚Äì1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings, Price surpassed Jacques Plante for first place in Montreal Canadiens franchise career wins with his 315th career victory. International play Price made his international debut for Canada at the 2005 IIHF World U18 Championships in the Czech Republic. He appeared in four games, earning a silver medal as Team Canada was defeated by the United States 5‚Äì1 in the gold medal game. Two years later, in his final year of major junior, Price was named to Team Canada for the 2007 World Junior Championships in Sweden. He led Team Canada to a third consecutive gold medal and was named Tournament MVP and Top Goaltender after going 6‚Äì0 with two shutouts, a 1.14 GAA and .961 save percentage. He was also named to the Tournament All-Star Team along with teammates Jonathan Toews and Kris Letang. He led the 2005 IIHF world U18 Championships in save percentage and wins. Price sold his U18 Championship helmet for charity. On January 7, 2014, Price was named to the 2014 Canadian Olympic Hockey Team along with goaltenders Mike Smith of the Phoenix Coyotes and Roberto Luongo of the Florida Panthers. Price, along with close friend and teammate P. K. Subban, became the first Montreal Canadiens players to be selected for Team Canada since Mark Recchi in the 1998 Nagano Olympics. Soon after arriving in Sochi, it was announced that Price would start in Canada's first game of the tournament against Norway. Price had a strong debut, stopping 18 of 19 shots against Norway in a 3‚Äì1 Canadian win. Price's strong play continued, allowing only a single goal in a 2‚Äì1 victory against Finland in the round-robin tournament. In Canada's quarter-final game, Price backstopped Canada over Latvia 2‚Äì1. On February 21, 2014, Price played a pivotal role in a 1‚Äì0 victory against Team USA in the semifinals. Price stopped all 31 shots and shutout Team USA, powering Team Canada into the gold medal game against Sweden. In his second consecutive shutout of the Olympics, Price made 24 saves in a 3‚Äì0 victory and won his first gold medal as an Olympian. Price ended the tournament undefeated in five games with a 0.59 GAA and .971 save percentage, and was named the tournament's best goaltender by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). Playing style Price holds off a shoot out attempt against Jeff Skinner of the Carolina Hurricanes. Like most modern goaltenders, Price plays the style of goaltending known as \\"butterfly style\\" popularized by Glenn Hall, dropping to his knees and pointing his skates outwards with his pads covering the bottom width of the net. Price is known for his excellent reflexes which are considered to be some of his best attributes as a goaltender. He can read the play very well and has very good reaction time. He is noted for his calm demeanor on the ice that allows him to remain focused and rarely appears rattled or upset in the net. Price is considered by the Canadiens' management and coaches to be one of the leaders of the team and is present during meetings with the team's captain and alternate captains. Philanthropy In 2015, Price teamed up with CCM to donate $10,000 worth of equipment to a minor hockey league in Williams Lake, B.C. Additionally, Price funds a breakfast program at his old school in Anahim Lake, B.C. During the 2019 NHL Awards, Price, together with model Camille Kostek, presented Canadien hockey fan Anderson Whitehead the Feel Good Moment Award. Whitehead's mother always wanted her son to meet the goalie, but wasn't able to arrange it before she died last November at age 44 from cancer. Personal life Price met his wife, Angela (n√©e. Webber), while playing with the Tri-City Americans. In an interview, Angela said that the couple were set up on a blind date by her friend, who was dating Carey's roommate at the time. They reside in Kelowna, British Columbia, during the off-season. They were married August 24, 2013, in Benton City, Washington, near Angela's hometown of Kennewick. The next day, Price flew to Calgary for Hockey Canada's Olympic orientation camp for the 2014 Winter Olympics. On October 21, 2015, Angela Price confirmed on her blog that they were expecting their first child due the following spring. In 2016, Angela gave birth to the couple's first daughter. In December 2018, Angela gave birth to their second daughter. In June 2020, Angela announced they were expecting their third child due in the fall.

He had a long career for Sussex, playing 538 first- class matches over a 21-year period, and played two Test matches for England. He also umpired one One Day International after his retirement as a player. Life and career A former Welsh Guardsman, and a more than dependable county all-rounder, Oakman used his unusual height () to gain bounce for his off-spinners, and got well forward to drive while at the batting crease. He passed a thousand runs in a season on nine occasions, took 99 wickets in 1954 and his telescopic skill as a close fielder snared him five catches in Jim Laker's famous 19 wicket haul at Old Trafford, and totalled 594 catches in his career. Although both his Test appearances in the home Ashes series of 1956 ended in victories, he was called upon for just eight overs at Old Trafford, whilst Tony Lock and Laker bowled over 130 between them. He played a key role in the Old Trafford match taking five catches from Australia's two innings. England's wealth of off-spinners during this period which included Laker, Illingworth and Titmus, meant his international career was brief. A stalwart for Sussex for two decades from 1947 to 1968, his value to the team was belied by his comparatively modest batting average, but he still stands eleventh in the list of all time run-scorers for his county. He took five wickets in an innings 31 times, with a best of 7 for 39 against Glamorgan in 1954 (10 for 58 in the match). He scored 22 centuries, with a highest score of 229 not out against Nottinghamshire in 1961 (off 105 overs), a season in which he made his highest tally of 2307 runs. Oakman became coach of Warwickshire in 1970 and led them to the County Championship title in 1972. After this he moved away from the pitch, becoming the club's Assistant Secretary for Cricket Administration. Oakman turned to umpiring for a brief spell after retiring, replacing Arthur Fagg for one over at the 1973 Edgbaston Test when Fagg staged a protest at the West Indies attitude in the field, but then became Warwickshire's coach between 1970 and 1987. Oakman continued to play cricket until almost seventy, making appearances for Warwickshire's Over-50s side and inspiring the founding of the Sussex Cricket Society. Oakman died on 6 September 2018, as a mark of respect the Sussex flag was flown at half mast for their championship game against Leicestershire at the County Cricket Ground, Hove.

The VSD database contains data compiled from surveillance on more than seven million people in the United States, including about 500,000 children from birth through age six years (2% of the U.S. population in this age group). The VSD data-sharing program is now being administered by the National Center for Health Statistics Research Data Center. The data sharing guidelines have been revised to include comments from interested groups as well as recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the VSD, and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Network are tools by which the CDC and FDA measure vaccine safety to fulfill their duty as regulatory agencies charged with protecting the public.

The compound is a derivative of aniline, consisting of an amine bound to two phenyl groups. The compound is a colorless solid, but commercial samples are often yellow due to oxidized impurities.P. F. Vogt, J. J. Gerulis, \\"Amines, Aromatic\\" in Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Diphenylamine dissolves well in many common organic solvents, and is moderately soluble in water. It is used mainly for its antioxidant properties. Diphenylamine is widely used as an industrial antioxidant, dye mordant and reagent and is also employed in agriculture as a fungicide and antihelmintic.\\"Identification of toxic impurities in commercial Diphenylamine\\", Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, February 1977, Volume 17, Issue 2, pp 204‚Äì207. Authored by S Safe, O Hutzinger, JFS Crocker, SC Digout Preparation and reactivity Diphenylamine is manufactured by the thermal deamination of aniline over oxide catalysts: : 2 C6H5NH2 ‚Üí (C6H5)2NH + NH3 It is a weak base, with a Kb of 10‚àí14. With strong acids, it forms salts. For example, treatment with sulfuric acid gives the bisulfate [(C6H5)2NH2]+[HSO4]‚àí as a white or yellowish powder with m.p. 123-125 ¬∞C.The Merck Index, 10th Ed., (1983), p.485, Rahway: Merck & Co. Diphenylamine undergoes various cyclisation reactions. With sulfur, it gives phenothiazine, a precursor to pharmaceuticals.T. Kahl, K.-W. Schr√∂der, F. R. Lawrence, W. J. Marshall, Hartmut H√∂ke, Rudolf J√§ckh, \\"Aniline\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. : (C6H5)2NH + 2 S ‚Üí S(C6H4)2NH + H2S With iodine, it undergoes dehydrogenation to give carbazole, with release of hydrogen iodide: : (C6H5)2NH + I2 ‚Üí (C6H4)2NH + 2 HI Arylation with iodobenzene gives triphenylamine. it is also used as a test reagent in the dische's test . Applications =Apple scald inhibitor= Diphenylamine is used as a pre- or postharvest scald inhibitor for apples applied as an indoor drench treatment. Its anti-scald activity is the result of its antioxidant properties, which protect the apple skin from the oxidation products of Œ±-farnesene during storage. Apple scald is physical injury that manifests in brown spots after fruit is removed from cold storage. =Stabilizer for smokeless powder= In the manufacture of smokeless powder, diphenylamine is commonly used as a stabilizer, such that the gunshot residue analysis seeks to quantify traces of diphenylamine. Diphenylamine functions by binding nitrocellulose degradation products (e.g. NO, NO2, and nitric acid), preventing these degradation products from accelerating further degradation. =Antioxidant= Alkylated diphenylamines function as antioxidants in lubricants, approved for use in machines, in which contact with food is not ruled out. Alkylated diphenylamines and other derivatives are used as anti- ozonants in the manufacture of rubber products, reflecting the antioxidant nature of aniline derivatives. =Redox indicator= Many diphenylamine derivatives are used as redox indicators that are particularly useful in alkaline redox titrations. The diphenylaminesulfonic acid is a simple prototype redox indicator, owing to its improved aqueous solubility compared with diphenylamine. Attempts have been made to explain the color changes associated with the oxidation of diphenylamine. In a related application, diphenylamine is oxidized by nitrate to give a similar blue coloration in the diphenylamine test for nitrates. =Dyes = Several azo dyes like Metanil Yellow, Disperse Orange 1, and Acid orange 5 are derivatives of diphenylamine. Toxicity In animal experiments diphenylamine was rapidly and completely absorbed after ingestion by mouth. It underwent metabolism to sulfonyl and glucuronyl conjugates and was rapidly excreted mainly via urine. Acute oral and dermal toxicity were low. Diphenylamine can cause severe irritation to the eyes. It was not a skin irritant, and it has not been technically feasible to test acute toxicity study by inhalation. Diphenylamine targets the red blood cell system and can cause abnormal erythropoiesis in the spleen, and thus congestion of the spleen, and haemosiderosis. Changes in liver and kidneys were found upon longer exposure. At clear toxic doses of parent animals reproductive effects were limited to reduced implantation sites in F1 females associated with reduced rat litter size, implicating a possible mutagenic or teratogenic effect. No effect on development could be attributed. The U.S. CDC's NIOSH lists the following symptoms of poisoning: irritation eyes, skin, mucous membrane; eczema; tachycardia, hypertension; cough, sneezing; methemoglobinemia; increased blood pressure and heart rate; proteinuria, hematuria (blood in the urine), bladder injury; in animals: teratogenic effects. The short-term NOAEL of 9.6 ‚Äì 10 mg/kg bw/day was derived from 90-day rat, 90-day dog and 1-year dog studies and the long-term NOAEL was 7.5 mg/kg bw/day. The Acceptable Daily Intake of diphenylamine was 0.075 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year rat study, applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level was 0.1 mg/kg bw/day. In a study of diphenylamine metabolism in harvested and dipped apples at different time intervals it was observed that radiolabelled residues of diphenylamine penetrate from the surface into the pulp, which after 40 weeks contained 32% of the residue. Diphenylamine was always the major residue, but 3 metabolites were found in good amounts in the apple samples, whose identification experts considered insufficient.(Kim-Kang, H. 1993. Metabolism of 14C-diphenylamine in stored apples‚Äînature of the residue in plants. Report RPT00124. Study XBL 91071. XenoBiotic Laboratories, Inc., USA, unpublished) cited in There is a data gap on presence or formation of nitrosamines in apple metabolism or during processing. The carcinogen 4-Aminobiphenyl can accompany diphenylamine as an impurity. Diphenylamine has low acute and short-term toxicity to birds, but is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Risk to biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. The impurity in commercial diphenylamine which induces polycystic kidney disease in rats was identified in 1981. Laboratory studies with highly purified diphenylamine indicated that the impurity can be formed by heating diphenylamine. Environmental fate Diphenylamine is considered practically insoluble according to the 2014 MSDS. It exhibits very low persistence in direct water photolysis experiments in the laboratory and is moderately volatile. Indirect photooxidation in the atmosphere through reaction with hydroxyl radicals was estimated. Despite limited data, the information was sufficient for the EC to characterize the environmental risk as negligible, because the intended use of diphenylamine was indoors. =Residues in fruit and alternatives= Of 744 apples tested USDA found 82.7% of them to have diphenylamine residue between 0.005 - 4.3 ppm, below the U.S. EPA's tolerance level of 10ppm. A number of alternatives to the use of diphenylamine exist for the control of scald of apples.Colin R. Little, Robert J. Holmes \\"Storage Technology for Apples and Pears: A Guide to Production, Postharvest Treatment and Storage of Pome Fruit in Australia\\" Institute for Horticultural Development Agriculture, 2000. Regulation =Europe= The EC set maximum residue levels for diphenylamine in 2005. (Annex II and Part B of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005). Diphenylamine was one of 84 substances of a European Commission (EC) review program covered by a regulation from 2002 requiring the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) upon EC request to organize a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. a draft risk assessment, and to provide the EC within 6 months with a conclusion. The assessment, received by the EFSA in 2007 started the peer review in October 2007 by dispatching it for consultation of the EC member states and the applicants, the two manufacturers, Cerexagri s.a., Italian subsidiary of United Phosphorus Ltd (UPL), and Pace International LLC. As a result of the peer review, mostly lacking data about risk to consumers, and particularly the levels and toxicity of unidentified metabolites of the substance, the possible formation of nitrosamines during storage of the active substance and during processing of treated apples, and the lack of data on the potential breakdown product of diphenylamine residues in processed commodities, the EC decided on 30 November 2009 to withdraw authorizations for plant protection products containing diphenylamine.(2009/859/EC) The 'European Diphenylamine Task Force' resubmitted an application to the EC with more data, and an additional report was received by the EFSA on 3 December 2010. EFSA concluded the risk assessment did not eliminate the concerns on 5 December 2011, published this opinion in 2012 and it became law in 2013. =WHO/FAO joint committee= The Committee established an acceptable daily intake of 0.02 mg/kg/day in a meeting on pesticide residues. =US EPA= After passage of the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996, the U.S. EPA had established a tolerance level for apples at 10 ppm, and for meat and milk at 0 ppm. The tentative LOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day In 1997 EPA approved the reregistration of diphenylamine, and determined that recommended tolerances met the safety standards under FQPA and that \\"adequate data indicate that tolerances for residues in milk and meat could be increased from 0.0 ppm and established as separate tolerances set at 0.01 ppm\\". EPA has not reviewed diphenylamine since then.

The Fasci gained the support of the poorest and most exploited classes of the island by channeling their frustration and discontent into a coherent programme based on the establishment of new rights. Consisting of a jumble of traditionalist sentiment, religiosity, and socialist consciousness, the movement reached its apex in the summer of 1893, when new conditions were presented to the landowners and mine owners of Sicily concerning the renewal of sharecropping and rental contracts. Upon the rejection of these conditions, there was an outburst of strikes that rapidly spread throughout the island, and was marked by violent social conflict, almost rising to the point of insurrection. The leaders of the movement were not able to keep the situation from getting out of control. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene, and Prime Minister Francesco Crispi declared a state of emergency in January 1894, dissolving the organizations, arresting its leaders and restoring order through the use of extreme force. Some reforms followed, including workmen's compensation and pension schemes. The suppression of the strikes also led to an increase in emigration. Characteristics The Fasci movement was made up of a federation of scores of associations that developed among farm workers, tenant farmers, and small sharecroppers as well as artisans, intellectuals, and industrial workers.Bruno Cartosio, Sicilian Radicals in Two Worlds, in: Debouzy, In the Shadow of the Statue of Liberty, pp. 120-21 The immediate demands of the movement were fair land rents, higher wages, lower local taxes and distribution of misappropriated common land.Seton-Watson, Italy from liberalism to fascism, pp. 162-63 Between 1889 and 1893 some 170 Fasci were established in Sicily. According to some sources the movement reached a membership of more than 300,000 by the end of 1893. The Fasci constituted autonomous organizations with their own insignia (red rosettes), uniforms and sometimes even musical bands, and their own local halls for reunions and congresses.Colajanni, Gli avvenimenti di Sicila e le loro cause, p. 14 They were called Fasci (Fascio literally means bundle) because everyone can break a single stick, but no one can break a bundle of sticks. Il tribunale militare fu un abuso di Crispi, La Repubblica, 5 February 2009 While many of the leaders were of socialist or anarchist leanings, few of their supporters were revolutionaries. Nevertheless, the peasants who assembled into the Fasci were eager for social justice and convinced that a new world was about to be born. A crucifix hung beside the red flag in many of their meeting-places, and portraits of the King beside those of the revolutionaries Garibaldi, Mazzini and Marx. Cheers for the King were often heard in their marches that almost resembled quasi-religious processions. Many of the Fasci were part of the Italian Workers' Party (Partito dei Lavoratori Italiani, the initial name of the Italian Socialist Party) that had been founded at a conference in Genoa on August 14, 1892.Colajanni, Gli avvenimenti di Sicila e le loro cause, p. 17Scolaro, Il movimento antimafia siciliano, p.18 The rural Fasci in particular were a curious phenomenon: both ancient and modern. They combined millenarian aspirations with urban intellectual leadership often in contact with workers‚Äô organizations and ideas in the more industrialized Northern Italy.Clark, Modern Italy, 1871 to the present, pp. 124-25 According to the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, the Fasci were millenarian insofar as the socialism preached by the movement was seen by the Sicilian peasantry as a new religion, the true religion of Christ ‚Äì betrayed by the priests, who were on the side of the rich ‚Äì that foretold the dawn of a new world, without poverty, hunger and cold, in accordance with God‚Äôs will. The Fasci, which included many women, were encouraged by the messianic belief that the start of a new reign of justice was looming and the movement spread like an epidemic.Hobsbawm, Primitive rebels, pp. 98-101 Foundation and rapid growth The Fasci were the result of the revolt of the Sicilian peasants against the introduction of capitalist relationships into the rural economy aggravated by the world depression in agriculture of the 1880s.Hobsbawm, Primitive rebels, p. 96 The agrarian crisis between 1888 and 1892 led to a steep decrease in wheat prices. The island‚Äôs main sources of wealth ‚Äì wine, fruit and sulphur ‚Äì suffered a heavy blow. The dominant landowning class channeled most of the economic burden on to the peasantry, in the form of higher rents and discriminatory local taxation. As social tension rose, a handful of young and hitherto quite unknown socialist intellectuals ‚Äì many of them recent graduates of Palermo University ‚Äì seized their opportunity. The movement grew under the first government of Prime minister Francesco Crispi (1887-1891) and coincided with unpopular tax increases and ratification of a series of laws curtailing personal freedom. The Italian economy had been sliding into a deep recession since the late 1880s. New protective tariffs had been introduced in 1887 on agricultural and industrial goods, followed by a trade war with France, which badly damaged Italian commerce and affected Italy‚Äôs agricultural exports, the only potentially dynamic economic sector of southern Italy. Many farmers suffered severely.Seton-Watson, Italy from liberalism to fascism, p. 161Duggan, The Force of Destiny, p. 339 Bernardino Verro, one of the leaders of the Fasci The first official Fascio was founded on May 1 (Labour Day), 1891, in Catania by Giuseppe de Felice Giuffrida. (An earlier Fascio was set up in Messina on March 18, 1889, but was dormant after its founder, Nicola Petrina, was arrested in July of that year and not released until 1892. Another reason why the first Fascio of Messina ‚Äì formed after the example of the Fasci operai [Workers leagues] constituted in Central and North Italy from 1871 ‚Äì did not develop was that it brought together not individual workers but the workers' associations of the city, which retained their independence, their status and economic orientation.) Other leaders included Rosario Garibaldi Bosco in Palermo, Nicola Barbato in Piana dei Greci, Bernardino Verro in Corleone, and Lorenzo Panepinto in Santo Stefano Quisquina. While the ruling elite depicted the men of the Fasci as treasonous socialists, communists and anarchists seeking to overthrow the monarchy; in fact many were devout Catholics and monarchists. The movement sometimes had a messianic nature, characterised by statements such as \\"Jesus was a true socialist and wanted just what the Fasci were demanding.\\" Nicola Barbato was known as \\"the workers' apostle.\\" The keenest socialist among the Fasci leaders was Garibaldi Bosco. In August 1892 he attended the Socialist party‚Äôs congress at Genoa and on his return obediently purged his fascio of its anarchist and other non- socialist members. His ideal of a united democratic front was shared by the father of Sicilian socialism, Napoleone Colajanni. The leader in Catania, De Felice, also maintained contact with leading anarchists like Amilcare Cipriani. On these and other important issues there was much friction between Catania and Palermo. Crispi was replaced as prime minister by Antonio Di Rudin√¨ in February 1891, who was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti in May 1892. On January 20, 1893, when peasants of Caltavuturo occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs, local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the Caltavuturo massacre. L‚Äôeccidio di ¬´San Sebastiano¬ª, La Sicilia, February 8, 2009 Disturbances continued throughout the year. The Fasci started out as urban movements, animated by artisans, which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners, and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers. In the autumn of 1893, labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers. The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes, involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside, becoming difficult, if not impossible, to control by its leaders. Initial success From its initial origins in Eastern Sicily, especially in Catania, the movement got its real impetus with the establishment of the Fascio of Palermo on June 29, 1892. The Leagues rapidly radiated over all Sicily. In the spring of 1893 the leaders of the movement decided to carry their propaganda to the peasants and miners of the countryside. Between March and October the number of fasci grew from 35 to 162 with more than 200,000 members.Leoni, Storia dei partiti politici italiani, p. 251 On May 21‚Äì22, 1893, a Congress was held in Palermo attended by 500 delegates from nearly 90 leagues and socialist circles. A Central Committee was elected, composed of nine members: Giacomo Montalto for the province of Trapani, Nicola Petrina for the province of Messina, Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida for the province of Catania, Luigi Leone for the province of Siracusa, Antonio Licata for the province of Agrigento, Agostino Lo Piano Pomar for the province of Caltanissetta, Rosario Garibaldi Bosco, Nicola Barbato and Bernardino Verro for the province of Palermo. Il ¬´battesimo¬ª del socialismo, La Sicilia, May 24, 2009 The Congress decided that all Leagues were obliged to join the Italian Workers' Party (Partito dei Lavoratori Italiani), the predecessor of the PSI. In July 1893 a peasant conference at Corleone drafted model agrarian contracts for labourers, sharecroppers and tenants and presented them to the landowners. When those refused to negotiate, a strike against landowners and against state taxes broke out over a large part of western Sicily. The so-called Patti di Corleone (Corleone Covenants), are considered by historians to be the first trade union collective contract in capitalist Italy. La firma dei ¬´Patti di Corleone¬ª, La Sicilia, September 14, 2008 In September the state authorities intervened and some of the landowners were persuaded to capitulate. Elsewhere the strike continued until November 1893. Railwaymen of Catania and Palermo, the sulphur-miners and many other workers followed their example winning higher wages or better working conditions. In October 1893, a congress of miners was held in Grotte in the Province of Agrigento which was attended by some 1,500 people, including workers and small producers. The miners demanded that the minimum age to be raised to 14 years for those who worked in the sulfur mines, the decrease of working hours and setting a minimum wage. Small producers demanded measures to avoid exploitation by large owners. The minimum-age measure was meant to improve the situation for the carusi, minors that worked in conditions of near-slavery that sparked public outrage and inspired many complaints. Movimento contadino e sindacale, Umberto Santino, Narcomafie, Nr. 2, February 2005 The successful struggle convinced the Sicilian ruling elite that the \\"upheaval\\" had to be stopped. They were seized by panic and some even demanded the closing of all schools to halt the spread of subversive doctrines. Prefects and frightened local councils bombarded Rome with requests for the immediate suppression of the Fasci. Despite the heavy pressure from the King, the army and conservative circles in Rome, however, Giolitti would neither treat strikes ‚Äì which were not illegal ‚Äì as a crime nor dissolve the Fasci nor authorise the use of firearms against popular demonstrations.De Grand, The hunchback's tailor, pp. 47-48 His policy was ‚Äúto allow these economic struggles to resolve themselves through amelioration of the condition of the workers‚Äù and not to interfere in the process. Rising tensions Prime Minister Francesco Crispi Nonetheless, Giolitti acknowledged the need to stifle the agitation. From May 1893 onwards, leaders of the Fasci were arrested occasionally and police and military reinforcements were sent to Sicily. In the autumn of 1893 the leadership lost control over the Fasci and the popular agitation got out of hand. Peasant squatters seized land, violent crowds demonstrated for work and against local misgovernment, tax offices were burnt down and clashes with the police grew more frequent and bloody. The violent social conflict almost rose to the point of insurrection. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene. However, his attitude could not be maintained. Landowners were infuriated by the unwillingness of the government to use force, while the peasants were annoyed by the unwillingness to redistribute land from the latifundia. Landowners matched the strike with a lockout, and many peasants, probably a majority in the strike centres, were left without tenancies when the planting season ended in mid-December.Alcorn, Revolutionary Mafiosi. In December 1893 the failure of the Giolitti government to restore public order gave rise to a general demand that Crispi should return to power. Giolitti had to resign on November 24, 1893, as a result of the Banca Romana scandal.Cabinet Forced To Resign; Italian Ministers Called \\"Thieves\\" by the People, The New York Times, November 25, 1893 In addition to the unrest in Sicily, a wave of rioting spread through Italy in August 1893, triggered by the killing of a number of migrant workers in the salt pans of Aigues Mortes in southern France escalated into a more generalized working-class revolt supported by anarchists and violent riots in Rome and Naples. Italy seemed to be slipping to a revolution. By the time Crispi returned to power in December 1893, Italy appeared to many to be on the brink of collapse.Duggan, The Force of Destiny, p. 340 Crispi promised important measures of land reform for the near future. He was not blind to the misery and the need for social reform. Before 1891 he had been the patron of the Sicilian working-class and many of their associations had been named after him. Colajanni, the chief architect of Giolitti‚Äôs fall by exposing the Banca Romana scandal, was first offered the Ministry of Agriculture, which he refused, then sent to Sicily on a mission of appeasement.Seton-Watson, Italy from liberalism to fascism, pp. 165-67 Crispi‚Äôs good intentions got lost in the outcry for strong measures. In the three weeks of uncertainty before the government was formed, the rapid spread of violence drove many local authorities to defy Giolitti‚Äôs ban on the use of firearms. In December 1893, 92 peasants lost their lives in clashes with the police and army. Government building were burned as well as flour mills and bakeries that refused to lower their prices when taxes were lowered or abolished.Shot Down by the Soldiers; Four of the Mob Killed in an Anti-Tax Riot in Sicily, The New York Times, December 27, 1893Sicily Under Mob Control; A Series of Antitax Riots in The Island, The New York Times January 3, 1894 Eleven people were killed on December 10, 1893, in Giardinello after a rally that asked for the abolition of taxes on food and disbandment of the local field guards (guardie campestri). The protestors carried the portrait of the King taken from the municipality and burned tax files. On December 17, 1893, many people were wounded when troops fired on a manifestation in Monreale. Another 11 protestors were killed in Lercara Friddi on December 25. La strage di Giardinello, La Sicilia, December 11, 2011Colajanni, Gli avvenimenti di Sicila e le loro cause, pp. 178-79 Scolaro, Il movimento antimafia siciliano, p. 57 On January 1, 1894, 20 people were killed and many wounded in Gibellina and Pietraperzia. On January 2, there two dead in Belmonte Mezzagno and the next day 18 dead and many wounded in Marineo. 1894, a Marineo un'altra strage, La Sicilia, January 2, 2011Serious Affair in Sicily, The New York Times, January 6, 1894 Two days after, on January 5, thirteen dead and many wounded closed the series in Santa Caterina.Sicily Under Mob Control; A Series of Antitax Riots in the Island, The New York Times, January 3, 1894 The disorders were not the product of a revolutionary plot, but Crispi chose to believe otherwise. On the basis of dubious documents and reports, Crispi claimed that there was an organised conspiracy to separate Sicily from Italy; the leaders of the Fasci conspired with the clerics and were financed by French gold, and war and invasion were looming.Duggan, The Force of Destiny, p. 342Trouble Has Been Long Brewing; Quantities of Arms and Ammunition in Hands of Revolutionists, The New York Times, January 6, 1894 Crackdown On January 3, 1894, Crispi declared a state of siege throughout Sicily. Army reservists were recalled and General Roberto Morra di Lavriano was dispatched with 40,000 troops.The Italian Government Alarmed; More Troops Called Out for Service in Sicily, The New York Times, January 4, 1894Martial Law Proclaimed In Sicily; Stern Measures Resorted To to Quiet the Anti-Tax Troubles, The New York Times, January 5, 1894 The old order was restored through the use of extreme force, including summary executions. The Fasci were outlawed, the army and the police killed scores of protesters, and wounded hundreds. Thousands of militants, including all the leaders, were put in jail or sent into internal exile. Some 1,000 persons were deported to the penal islands without trial. All working- class societies and cooperatives were dissolved and the freedom of the press, meeting and association were suspended. A solidarity revolt of anarchists and republicans in the Lunigiana was crushed as well. The government also seized the opportunity to 'revise' the electoral registers. In Catania 5,000 of the 9,000 electors were struck off.Clark, Modern Italy, 1871 to the present, p. 126 In the early days of January, 1894 a meeting of the Central Committee of the Fasci took place in Palermo to discuss the position of the movement. Two sharply contrasting positions emerged. De Felice Giuffrida, known for his anarchist tendencies, supported the need to take advantage of the situation of unrest to provoke a revolution on the island. However, the majority took an opposite view, arguing the need to proceed peacefully. A revolt was not only inappropriate, but it would be detrimental to the movement. The meeting condemned the violent incidents in various parts of the island, and launched an appeal to stay calm and not to retaliate. In the end De Felice Giuffrida accepted the position of the majority. But the die was cast for the authorities to arrest De Felice, Montalto, Petrina, and others. Garibaldi Bosco, Barbato and Verro were arrested on board the steamship Bagnara that was about to leave for Tunis. I Fasci dei lavoratori in Sicilia, by Pietro Siino, Societ√† Siciliana per l'Amicizia fra i Popoli On February 28, 1894 Crispi presented the \\"evidence\\" for a widespread conspiracy in parliament: the so- called \\"International Treaty of Bisacquino\\", signed by the French Government, the Czar of Russia, Giuseppe De Felice, the anarchists and the Vatican, with the goal to detach Sicily from the rest of the country and put it under a Franco-Russian protectorate. I contadini in ginocchio, La Sicilia, January 8, 2012 The Radical deputy Felice Cavallotti ridiculed the conspiracy of Crispi, poking fun at \\"the famous treaty between the Emperor of Russia, the President of the French Republic, and Mr De Felice\\". The so-called \\"Treaty of Bisacquino\\" was so named not because it was signed in the Sicilian town, but because it had been invented by the Director of Public Safety of Bisacquino, the Neapolitan Sessi. Crispi sciolse i Fasci contadini, La Sicilia, January 7, 2011 Trial in Palermo The heads of the Fasci Siciliani in the courtroom cage at the trial in April 1894 The trials of the central committee of the Fasci, that took place in Palermo in April and May 1894, were the final blow to the movement. In spite of an eloquent defence, which turned the Court into a political platform and thrilled every socialist in the country, they were condemned to heavy sentences of imprisonment. On May 30, 1894, the leaders of the movement received their sentence: Giuseppe de Felice Giuffrida to 18 years and Rosario Bosco, Nicola Barbato and Bernardino Verro to 12 years in jail.Sicilian Rioters Sentenced, The New York Times, May 31, 1894 ‚ÄúIn front of you,‚Äù Barbato told the judges, ‚Äúwe provided the documents and evidence of our innocence. My friends thought it necessary to support their defence legally; I will not do so. Not because I have no confidence in you, but it is the law that does not concern me. So I do not defend myself. You have to sentence: we are the elements that destroy your sacred institutions. You have to sentence: it is logical, human. I will always pay tribute to your loyalty. But we say to our friends outside: do not ask for pardon, do not ask for amnesty. Socialist civilization should not begin with an act of cowardice. We demand a condemnation, we do not ask for mercy. Martyrs are more useful to the holy cause than any propaganda. Condemn us!‚Äù Il ¬´manifesto¬ª di Nicola Barbato, La Sicilia, January 10, 2010 The heavy sentence aroused strong reactions in Italy and in the United States. In Palermo a group of students went to the Teatro Bellini and asked the orchestra to perform the hymn of Garibaldi. And the theatre applauded. In March 1896, after Crispi had to resign due to the humiliating defeat of the Italian army at Battle of Adwa in Ethiopia during First Italo-Ethiopian War, the new government under Prime minister Antonio Di Rudin√¨ recognized the excessive brutality of the repression. Many Fasci members were pardoned and released from jail.Pardon for Italian Socialists, The New York Times, March 14, 1896 Di Rudin√¨ made it clear though that a reorganization of the Fasci would not be tolerated.Seton-Watson, Italy from liberalism to fascism, pp. 185-86 After their release, De Felice, Barbato and Bosco were met by a large crowd of supporters in Rome, who released the horses form their carriage and dragged them to the hotel, cheering for socialism and denouncing Crispi.Freed Italians Unrepentant; Many Socialists Greet Giuseppe de Felice, Bosco, and Barbato, The New York Times, March 18, 1896 Aftermath The brutal repression backfired to some extent. The Fasci leaders used the military tribunals to make impassioned and well-reported speeches in their defence. The tribunals were too repressive and revolted the Liberal consciences of many Northern Italians. In an attempt to regain his former 'left wing', Crispi introduced a bill in July 1894 to take over large estates and uncultivated land. The idea was to rent out the land on long leases in medium-sized holdings and leaseholders would be given reduced credit and tax concessions. While the bill failed to convince the Radicals and democrats of Crispi's good intentions, it angered the Sicilian landowners. After the suppression of the Fasci those were now unwilling to make any concessions. Under the leadership of Di Rudin√≠, they battled against the bill. When Crispi fell from power after Adwa in March 1896, their proponent Di Rudin√≠ became Prime Minister and the Sicilian landowners were safe. Nevertheless, the revolt inspired social reforms. In 1898 two measures of social legislation were passed by the minister of the treasury of Di Rudini‚Äôs cabinet, Luigi Luzzatti. The industrial workmen‚Äôs compensation scheme from 1883 was made obligatory with the employer bearing all costs; and a voluntary fund for contributory disability and old age pensions was created. Many former adherents of the Fasci left Sicily. Life had grown hard and employment difficult to find because of their involvement with the movement. For those in Sicily who wanted to change their life for the better in those days, there were only two alternatives: rebel or emigrate. After the failure of the rebellion many peasants had no choice but to vote with their feet and opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue of communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed. Il malcontento in Sicilia, La Stampa, August 18, 1895 According to Hobsbawm, the Fasci were a prime example of primitive agrarian movement that became modern by aligning itself with socialism and communism. Many of its leaders continued in the Socialist Party and continued the struggle for land rights and land reform once they were released. Despite the 1894 defeat, permanent movements were set up in some areas of Sicily using modern socialist models of organisation.Hobsbawm, Primitive rebels, pp. 101-105 With the dissolution of the Fasci, the unrest on Sicily did not subside. In January 1898, peasants demanding work and bread ransacked the town hall in Siculiana. Gravi fatti in Sicilia, La Stampa, January 3, 1898 In the fall of 1901, Sicilian peasants ‚Äì following the example of numerous agrarian strikes that were affecting the whole of Italy ‚Äì again set off a wave of agrarian unrest, conscious of the fact that in a way they resumed \\"the march abruptly interrupted in 1894 by the repression of the Fasci.\\" Just as the Fasci movement, one of the main goals of the 1901 strikes and was a revision of the land leases to undermine the economic power of the gabellotti. Scolaro, Il movimento antimafia siciliano, pp. 89-92 After the First World War the communist movement In Sicily built on the incipient organisational structures of the Fasci, such as during the Biennio Rosso. The Fasci inspired social struggle in Sicily well into the 1950s. The role of women The role of women in the Fasci siciliani was substantial,Hobsbawm, Primitive rebels, p. 99 but is regularly overlooked in historical accounts. L'anima femminile dei Fasci siciliani, La Repubblica, 9 March 2010 Women were often at the forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they made sure that men were going to vote (women did not have the right to vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers. Scolaro, Il movimento antimafia siciliano, pp. 31-34 Women were among the most ardent. In some municipalities the women organized themselves into women's sections and in others even in exclusively female Fasci.Guglielmo, Living the Revolution, pp. 36-39 The strongest and most numerous presence of women was in the Fascio of Piana degli Albanesi, where over a thousand of the 3,500 members were women in a town of 9,000 inhabitants. For the Fasci the women abandoned the Church, but not the religious sentiment, to protest against the priests, who had tried to frighten them and isolate them with the threat of excommunication. In Piana the women organised a boycott of annual religious procession in protest of the priest‚Äôs opposition to the movement in 1893. Donne ribelli nella Sicilia dei Fasci, La Sicilia, February 6, 2012 At the congress in Palermo in May 1893 where the union of all the Fasci in Sicily was decided, Maria Cammarata, of the Fascio of Piana, urged the audience to ensure the registration of women. The presence and political sophistication of the female representatives at the congress surprised the editor of the Giornale di Sicilia: \\"I could not believe it myself. They spoke loudly and clearly, with ease and astonishing courage.\\" One of the most prominent women was Marietta De Felice Giuffrida, the daughter of Giuseppe de Felice Giuffrida ‚Äì one of the founders of the movement. Only 14 years old, she accompanied her father throughout Sicily to help him setting up Fasci in the interior. She was \\"extraordinarily animated by the spirit of socialism, who spoke to the people with a fervour of a missionary, and because of her sex and age, she commanded the fascination of the masses.\\" The authorities watched the Fasci closely and in a report to the government in Rome noticed that the female Fasci in Piana, Belmonte Mezzagno and San Giuseppe Jato should be considered as dangerous. The women had developed \\"highly successful propaganda activities and revolutionary agendas, through which they exercised considerable influence on the other fasci in the region.\\"  Mafia involvement  Some historians emphasize that the leagues were engaged in class struggle against a coalition of landowners and mafiosi and ignore evidence of strategic alliances between the Fasci and the Mafia. The leagues were not only led by socialists and anarchists; some were run by local gentry and mafiosi. The Mafia bosses Vito Cascioferro and Nunzio Giaimo led the Fasci in Bisacquino in alliance with Verro. The Mafia was sometimes needed to enforce flying pickets with credible threats of violence and to make the strike costly to landowners by destroying their property. In order to give the strike teeth and to protect himself from harm, Verro became a member of a Mafia group in Corleone, the Fratuzzi (Little Brothers). However, during the great strike of the Fasci in September 1893, the Fratuzzi mobilized to boycott it, providing the necessary manpower to work on the lands that the peasants refused to cultivate.

His seven for 11 in that innings remained his best bowling performance. On the way home from England, the Australians played one Test match in Pakistan and three in India. Wilson was picked for the second match against Indian match at Bombay, did not bat and took only one wicket. He was discarded for the third Test, played on a spinners' wicket at Calcutta.

Although Ernest Bromley was the first Western Australian to play Test cricket, Rutherford was the first player from the Western Australia cricket team to be picked for a senior cricket tour and the first to win a Test cap for Australia whilst playing for his native state. Biography Rutherford was born in Bruce Rock, Western Australia. A science and mathematics graduate from the University of Western Australia,Gideon Haigh, The Summer Game, Text, Melbourne, 1997, p. 210. Rutherford was a right-handed opening batsman, inclined to be defensive, and an occasional leg-break bowler who played for Western Australia from the 1952‚Äì53 season. Until 1956‚Äì57, Western Australia played the other Sheffield Shield state cricket teams only once a season, so Rutherford's record of five first-class centuries in his first four seasons was notable enough to win him selection for the 1956 Australian tour to England. In a damp summer, though, he scored 640 runs at an average of fewer than 23 runs per innings. Against MCC at Lord's, he scored a 98 and shared a second wicket partnership of 282 with Neil Harvey, who scored 225. When the team was announced for the first Test, however, the Australians reverted to the first-choice opening pair of Colin McDonald and Jim Burke. On the way back to Australia from England, the team stopped in Pakistan for one Test match and in India for three games: in the second Indian match at Bombay (Mumbai), Rutherford won his solitary Test cap, replacing McDonald. He scored 30 and also took the wicket of Vijay Manjrekar, but McDonald returned for the third match and Rutherford never played Test cricket again. Rutherford played state cricket for three more seasons, but after top-scoring in the match and achieving his career-best bowling performance for Western Australia against the 1958‚Äì59 MCC touring side, he was not selected for the Tests that season and retired at the end of it. He played as a professional with Rishton in the Lancashire League in 1959, scoring 831 runs and taking 52 wickets.Wisden 1960, p. 738. He reappeared in first-class cricket in 1960‚Äì61, when he captained the state team to victory over the visiting West Indians, but he suffered a mild heart attack during the match and never played first-class cricket again.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, Oxford, Melbourne, 1996, pp. 458‚Äì59.

History Woden Plaza was initially constructed in stages during the late 1960s and early 1970s, opening as a direct competitor to the Canberra Centre, situated in the City Centre less than 15 minutes away. To begin with, the Centre's only components were what now houses the Big W and David Jones areas, but, during the 1980s, expanded to include a medium-sized food court. In 1996, the Centre underwent a major redevelopment, adding on a new wing to the building called \\"The Fresh Food Market\\" (currently housing Coles and Woolworths) as well as a new Hoyts 8-screen cinema complex. It would also see General Property Trust purchase the first, second, and third storeys of the Bonner House building, situated across from the back of the Centre, and connect the areas together with a pedestrian bridge. The Centre was once again revitalised during 2018, where a further expansion opened a new dining district on Bradley Street. This project, created as a joint venture with Perron Group, introduced six new eateries in an indoor-outdoor setting, also modernising the facades of Bonner House.

This model represented F-M's attempted entry into the lightweight locomotive market, but only four of the low-slung units were produced: the first pair was purchased by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad for their John Quincy Adams train (New York, New York to Boston, Massachusetts), while the second pair went to the Boston and Maine Railroad for their Speed Merchant train (Boston, Massachusetts to Portland, Maine). The P-12-42's eight-cylinder opposed piston engine was rated at after 1950, but train lighting and other ancillary loads (\\"hotel\\" power) used about 25% of output, leaving for traction. The 100-ton units measured long by wide by high, and were configured in a B-2 wheel arrangement mounted atop a pair of two-axle AAR road trucks, geared for with only the first two axles powered. The P-12-42 was one of the first locomotives to have its prime mover configured to run at a constant speed, with traction generator output regulated solely by excitation. The New Haven locomotives were dual-powered, and came equipped with third-rail pickups to allow them to operate in New York's Grand Central Terminal, becoming the first dual-power locomotives light enough to operate on the Park Avenue Viaduct F-M expected to sell many more units to the New Haven, and to spin the technological advance off into a line of passenger units, including a proposal that used a Train Master-style carbody, but with financial troubles preventing F-M from extending financing to customers, the cash-strapped New Haven ultimately opted to purchase a fleet of sixty EMD FL9s instead, as GM financing was available for the purchase. The New Haven's Talgo train was sold to Ferrocarril de Langreo for service in Spain, in 1962, and their locomotives sat unused afterwards, until being scrapped in 1971.

The drama stars Lee Ji-eun, Lee Hae-eun and Ahn Jae- mo. It was released domestically in October 1998, and screened at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 1999. Plot Jin-a (Lee Ji-eun), a 22-year-old prostitute, arrives at a small seaside motel called the Birdcage Inn to replace the previous one. The inn is run by a couple who have a daughter and a son. They provide Jin-a with room and board and make a living by renting out rooms and taking a cut of the money she earns. Jin-a works at night and spends her daytime drawing and watching the sea. In addition to her circumstances Jin-a has a hard time because of the family. The well regarded, silent, apparently caring, father providing for his family rapes Jin-a. The mother only sees Jin-a as a source of money to make a living and to fund the education of her college student daughter and high school student son. The son, Hyun-woo (Ahn Jae-mo) begs to be allowed to take naked pictures of Jin-a for a photo contest and to have sex with her. At first, Jin-a turns him down. However, after Hyun-woo's long imploration, Jin-a poses for him on the deck of a ship by the seaside and has sex with him. Afterwards he uses his walkman to tap Jin-a's room to listen in on Jin-a and her guests. The daughter, Hye-mi (Lee Hye-eun), who is sexually repressed, is the same age as Jin-a, does nothing to hide her contempt towards Jin-a. She expresses her hostility by refusing to use the same toothpaste and hand basin as Jin-a and ignores Jin-a's gestures of friendship, such as sharing an umbrella and buying her a Walkman which she has been dying to have. She emphasizes to Jin-a that she and Jin-a belong to different worlds. The relationship between the two becomes even worse when Hye-mi finds out that her sexually frustrated boyfriend, with whom Hye-mi has refused to have sex with before marriage, has gone to Jin-a and has had sex with her. One day, rummaging through Jin-a's room and personal possessions Hye-mi gains an insight into Jin-a that allows her to develop an empathy towards Jin-a. That night Hye-mi lies in bed and eavesdrops on Jin-a and a customer. Meanwhile, a publisher having seen Hyun-woo's photos of Jin-a goes to him and deceives him into selling them at a low price. After seeing Jin-a's nude in the magazine, Jin-a's former pimp goes to her again demanding money. Supposing that she's been paid a lot for it, he beats Jin-a when she denies it, Hye-mi tries to protect Jin-a from him. That night Jin-a makes an attempt to kill herself by cutting her arm and is found by Hye-mi who has had a nightmare about Jin-a. Jin-a and Hye-mi sit together, leaning towards each other and reconcile. That night, a customer comes to the inn and Hye-mi spends the night with him instead of the sick Jin-a and loses her virginity.

It is situated about 27 km from Byndoor town. This village lies at the foot of the Western Ghats and is famous for the Mookambika temple, a Hindu pilgrim center. The village is located on the banks of Agnitheertha and Souparnika river. Kollur also called Kolapura (in the name of sage called Kola Maharshi) one of the important places of pilgrimage in Karnataka State, which has a temple dedicated to supreme goddess Mookambika or Durga devi . The goddess Durga is called Mookambika as she is said to have slain the demon Mookasura. The goddess is described as in the form of a jyotirlinga incorporating both Shiva and Shakti. The panchaloha image of the goddess on Shri Chakra is stated to have been consecrated by Shri Adi Shankaracharya. The Divine Mother is said to be a manifestation of trigunas or triple forms such as Mahakali, Mahalakshmi & Mahasaraswati. The shikhara of the temple which is well gilded with gold is said to have been donated by Sankanna Savantha. Around the chief shrine of Mookambika, there are many other shrines. The idol of Chandramaulishvara is said to have been installed by Shri Adi Shankara. The temple has been renovated by Keladi rulers. The temple of Mookambika and other shrines attract many pilgrims from other states, too.  Legends  Kollur is an important seat of Shakti worship. The temple is rich in puranic lore. Legend goes that a Maharishi (sage) Kola was enchanted with nature‚Äôs beauty and decided to perform a penance on a rock near the Agnitheertha. Lord Shiva, delighted with Kola rishi, appeared before him and blessed him. The Maharishi wished for the welfare of mankind and nothing else. The Lord, happy with Kola, granted him his wish. He assured that a swayambhu (autogenetic) Linga would appear for his daily worship. However, Kola wanted to worship Devi also. So, a swarna rekha (gold line) appeared on the Lingam, signifying Shakti. Thus, Shiva and Shakti are worshipped together in the Lingam. Besides this, a unique feature is that the other Gods and Goddess of the Hindu pantheon also believed to reside in aroopa (non-form) in the Linga. It is thus believed to be an abode of the entire celestial congregation. It is believed that Adi Shankaracharya had a vision of Sri Mookambika Devi and installed the deity here. The legend says that Adi Shankara meditated at Kodachadri hills and Devi incarnated before him asking for his wish. He revealed his wish to install the Devi idol in a place in Kerala to worship where he wanted. Devi agreed but put forward a challenge that she will follow Shankara and he should not look back till he reaches his destination. But to test Shankara, Devi deliberately stopped the voice of her anklets when they reached Kollur whereupon Shankara turned and looked back because of doubt. Devi then asked Shankara to install her vigraha, just as he sees her, at that very location in Kollur. The original temple where Shankara meditated and Devi appeared before him is at Kodachadri peak,(1343 mt) which is at a distance of about 20 km from Kollur, also visible as a large mountain peak in front of the temple. There also a small temple dedicated to Mookambika near Kodachadri peak. Main Temple of Mookambika * Shri Mookambika Devi Temple ** Kollur is believed to be one of the seven pilgrim centres(Sapta kshetra) in Parashurama kshetra. The temple is devoted to the Hindu goddess Parvathi Devi consort of Lord Shiva. While the other pilgrimages created by Parashurama are devoted to Lord Shiva, Lord Subramanya and Lord Ganesha, this one is devoted to goddess Parvathi. The temple is constructed on the banks of a tributary of Souparnika River and in the middle of a forest. Just in front of the temple, Kodachadri peak and mountain is visible, which is a delightful sight. It is believed that original temple is on top of Kodachadri peak, and to make it convenient for devotees to offer pooja, the temple is constructed at Kollur. Devotees from all over South India visit this temple. Many pilgrims from Kerala visit the temple and perform vidyaarambham during Vijayadasami here. Around Kollur * Kashi Theertha is a beautiful river spot with a bridge and forest trekking opportunities about 1 km from the Mookambika temple. * Souparnika is a river spot where devotees take a holy dip.

Rathotsava in the month of Phalguna and Navaratri in the month of Ashwina are the main festivals in this temple.  Legend  It is believed that Adi Shankaracharya had a vision of Sri Mookambika Devi and installed the deity here. One day Devi appeared before Adi Shankaracharya asking for his wish. He revealed his wish to install the Devi idol in a place in Kerala to worship. Devi agreed but put forward a condition that she will follow Shankara and he should not look back till he reaches his destination. But to test Shankara, Devi deliberately stopped the noise of her anklets when they reached Kollur whereupon Shankara turned and looked back because of doubt. Devi then asked Shankara to install her vigraha at that very location at Kollur.

Rorke made his Test debut in January 1959 in the Fourth Test of The Ashes series against England in Adelaide. It was an impressive debut, taking 3/23 off 18.1 eight- ball overs in the first innings (including the wickets of Colin Cowdrey for 84, Tom Graveney and Willie Watson) and 2/70 from 34 overs in the second innings. Rorke claimed three wickets in the Fifth Test at Melbourne a fortnight later, and was selected to tour Pakistan and India the following year. A six-foot five-inch (or 1.96 m) \\"Blond Giant\\", Rorke was the fastest Australian bowler and accused of throwing by the English press, but this paled beside his excessive dragging. With his seven-foot stride, if dragging his rear foot a yard over the crease he could be only eighteen yards from the batsman when he finally delivered the ball. At times he seemed impossible to score from.Willis & Murphy, p. 96.Frith, p. 437.Brown, p. 131 Fred Trueman was no balled for dragging his foot a couple of inches over the crease and wrote \\"It was really annoying as this umpire seemed to allow Gordon Rorke to bowl with both his feet over the front line!\\".Trueman, p. 221. One picture showed him with his rear foot past the bowling crease before he had even begun to drag. Colin Cowdrey joked \\"I was frightened that he might tread on my toes\\".Tyson, p.59. Rorke did not play Pakistan in the opening three Tests of the 1959‚Äì60 tour, but was selected when Ray Lindwall withdrew from the opening Test against India at Delhi. Rorke played little role in the following Test at Kanpur, bowling only two overs before being forced to retire ill. His situation became so grave he was flown back to Australia for medical treatment. Following this illness, Rorke struggled in first-class cricket, eventually losing his place in the New South Wales Sheffield Shield squad in 1964. Since the end of his playing career he has had three knee replacements. He and his wife have four children and 11 grandchildren.

Another historical structure, Yau Ma Tei Fruit Market is adjacent to the theatre, across Reclamation Street. Yau Ma Tei area Situated in the south of Kowloon, Yau Ma Tei ( or ) was once a village and is now one of the most historic areas in Hong Kong. Before British rule of Kowloon in 1860, Yau Ma Tei was known in historical documents by the name of Kwun Chung with Tanka fisherman clustering around its beach and bay. Today, after many reclamation attempts by the Hong Kong Government, a harbour still stands which is used for the fishing industry. Yau Ma Tei is also famous for its Typhoon Shelter and seafood dishes which are offered both on and off-shore. Yau Ma Tei is now known as the part of Hong Kong \\"where the city never sleeps\\". The English spelling of Yau Ma Tei has variations such as Yau Ma Ti, Yaumatei, Yaumati or Yau-ma-tee. Part of the Yau Tsim Mong District, the Yau Ma Tei area has its north border at Dundas Street and Mong Kok while Tsim Sha Tsui and Austin share the south border. Victoria Harbour lies at its west, and the hills of Ho Man Tin at its east. Tourists and locals alike come to Yau Ma Tei for bargains at Temple Street night market, Chinese opera singing, and just to have a taste of the abundant cultural atmosphere. Other stalls located on the same street house fortune tellers and palm readers, goldsmiths, and wedding costumes.

On a southern coastal hill sits the Kwun Chung Fort constructed by Lin Tse-hsu, the Wing official of the cultivated village in a river valley at that time, to protect the village from the affronts of the British. Holding the British from Kowloon throughout the Battle of Kwun Chung in 1839, the fort was later taken down for development after the British took over Kowloon. Other heritage sites include the Yau Ma Tei Fruit Market, located on Waterloo Road has been standing for a century. Adjacent to it is the Yaumati Theatre, previously the largest of its kind in the Kowloon area. Also down the road are the Kwong Wah Hospital, the first hospital established in Kowloon in 1911, and the YMCA headquarters and hostel. The Yau Ma Tei Police Station in the district holds great historical value.Yau Ma Tei history Near the Yau Ma Tei Theater lies the Red Brick Building (known as The Engineer's Office of the Former Pumping Station) which is also being converted into a Xiqu Activity Centre for the performance and training of Cantonese opera.LCQ16: Revitalising Historic Buildings through Partnership Scheme History of the theatre Sources conflict over the exact year the Yaumati Theatre was completed and open to public, which fall between 1925 and 1931. The d√©cor of the theatre has shown some hints for the opening time of it. In the late 1920s, the dominant architectural style was the Neo-classicism while the Art Deco was an emerging trend of the next decade. While the front and the proscenium arch were designed as Neo-classical style with Art Deco influence, the interior d√©cor of the theatre is Art Deco. This provides a crucial clue that the theatre was built in the late 1920s but not the mid-1920s. Another important clue is the manufacturers‚Äô label found on the vintage film projectors kept in the projection room. Both of them were manufactured by Strong Electric Corp. of Toledo, Ohio, USA, and one of them has a patent registration year of 1927 and 1928. From this it can be proves that the cinema was opened no earlier than 1928. The Theatre used to be the venue of entertainment for working class citizens and was patronized by rickshaw riders, coolies and low-income families. It gradually lost customers to newer theatres in later time, particularly in the 1980s when the popularity of home video entertainment increased. Toward the end of its life, it screened erotic films to maintain its business. Some traditional cinemas in Hong Kong were demolished and re-developed into shopping malls and ‚Äòmini-cinema complexes‚Äô (a complex of small cinemas with 200 or less than 200 seats). Yaumati Theatre was not converted to either of because of its inherent spatial and technical problems of its pre-war design. In order to survive through the vigorous competition with other cinemas, Yaumati Theatre started to screen erotic films and even sold pornographic tapes in the concourse in order to increase the profit.An article by the former Secretary for Home Affairs, Dr. Patrick Ho (2006) The theatre finally closed on 31 July 1998. In the same year, it became a Grade II historical monument and the only pre-WWII monument that survived in the Kowloon area.Development Proposals/Cases Related to Preservation of Historic Buildings = Movies shown throughout the years = *Pre-World War II period: Silent movies *From 1930s to the eve of Pacific War: English-language movies (mainly Hollywood productions) and Chinese-language movies (mainly Shanghai productions) *During the Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong (1941-1945): Japanese movies and propaganda films *Post-war years to 1960s: Mainstream Hong Kong-Cantonese movies produced by local production companies (mainly Lan Kwong Film Company () and Kong Ngee Company ()). *1970s: Mandarin-language movies (primarily from Shaw Brothers Studio and Golden Harvest) *1980s : Cantonese-language movies from Golden Princess Amusement Co., Ltd. *After the late-1980s: 'Chain Showing' () of pornographic films, i.e., one ticket for several adult movies shown in one day *31 July, 1998: Closure of Yaumati Theatre Cantonese opera venue The back of the building.

It is the headquarters of the Kurseong subdivision. Located at an altitude of , Kurseong is from Darjeeling and has a pleasant climate throughout the year. Kurseong is from Siliguri and is connected to the city by road and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The nearest airport is at Bagdogra and the nearest major railway station is New Jalpaiguri, which is about from the town. The economy is based primarily on education and tourism.  Etymology  The origin of the name is unclear; stories suggest it comes from the Lepcha language word for \\"small orchid\\", kurson-rip because of the little white orchids (Coelogyne cristata) dotting the valleys, or perhaps the term for a stick made out of a local cane.  History  The original inhabitants were the Lepcha people, who named their home \\"Kurseong\\", because every spring it was alive and bright with Kurson-Rip orchids. In the remote past, Kurseong was a part of the Kingdom of Sikkim, even before the British came to India. However, in around 1780 the Nepalese conquered and annexed Kurseong and its surrounding areas. Then came the Gurkha War, which the Nepalese lost. The 1817 Treaty of Titalia restored Kurseong to Sikkim.Kurseong Municipality, \\"History\\" [of Kurseong]. Retrieved 2 February 2013 With its mountains providing a cool and dry environment in the summer, Kurseong was a favourite of the British. Nevertheless, they found travelling there from the plains of Bengal difficult, even on warm sunny days because of the mountains. Although a road was built from Kurseong to Darjeeling from Titalia in the 1770s and 1780s, its irregular maintenance soon made the new route, the Military Road, almost useless. The next route, Hill Cart Road (now Tenzing Norgay Road), opened in 1861 and fared better. Nevertheless, in 1835 the British decided that Darjeeling would make an excellent sanitorium and summer residence for their military and civilian officers along with their families. Negotiations with the Chogyal of Sikkim, Tshudpud Namgyal, provided them a strip of hill territory in Kurseong for an annual fee. As one of the hill stations on the road to Darjeeling, Kurseong began to develop. Kurseong is home to one of the oldest municipalities in the state of West Bengal. Established as an independent Municipality in 1879, it did not become a Sub- Division until 1890, when the District of Darjeeling was formed. Kurseong and the District were added to the Rajshahi Division (now West Central Bangladesh) by the British Raj for the Bengal Presidency. In 1908, they were transferred to the Bhagalpur Division in the same Presidency. Before Independence from the British, there were 12 ward commissioners. Four of them were appointed by the British Raj and it also appointed its own man, the Sub-Divisional Officer (S.D.O.), as their chairman. In 1939, when Bengal became a province of British India, Kurseong was allowed to elect its own member to be the chairman, but the Raj continued to send ward commissioners until India gained independence. Nevertheless, between 1939 and 1942, Kurseong grew rapidly. As of today Kurseong has 20 commissioners.

Nayak is the current president of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations (FIRA). He founded the Dakshina Kannada Rationalist Association in 1976 and has been its secretary since then. He also founded an NGO called Aid Without Religion in July 2011. He tours the country conducting workshops to promote scientific temper and showing people how to debunk godmen and frauds. He has conducted over 2000 such demonstrations in India, including some in Australia, Greece, England, Norway, Denmark, Sri Lanka and Nepal. He is also a polyglot who speaks 9 languages fluently, which helps him when he is giving talks in various parts of the country. Life and work Nayak was named after Swami Vivekananda (born Narendra Nath Datta). He has stated that seeing his father's business premises being repossessed by the bank and his father buying a lottery ticket on the advice of an astrologer to pay off the loan with the total confidence that it would get the first prize made him turn to rationalism. He married Asha Nayak, a lawyer in Mangaluru in a non-religious ceremony. Nayak started out working as a lecturer in the Department of biochemistry in the Kasturba Medical College in Mangalore in 1978. In 1982, he met Basava Premanand, a notable rationalist from Kerala, and was influenced by him.  Activism  Nayak decided to take on full-time anti-superstition activism in 2004 when he heard that a girl had been sacrificed in Gulbarga in Karnataka. He was an assistant professor of biochemistry when he took voluntary retirement on 25 November 2006, after working there for 28 years. Before the general election in 2009, Nayak laid an open challenge to any soothsayer to answer 25 questions correctly about the forthcoming elections. The prize was set at (about ). About 450 responses were mailed to him, but none were found to be correct. The Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations has been conducting such challenges since 1991. During May 2013 Karnataka state assembly election, disappointed at the challenge being one- sided, Nayak had decided against the idea of challenging astrologers this time. But when a Bengaluru-based astrologer Shankar Hegde made claims to predict the election results accurately, he received the challenge. Nayak offered to hand over a cheque of Rs.10 lakh (after deducting taxes as applicable under income Tax Act), if 19 out of the 20 results were proven right. However, later on astrologer Hegde did not turn up. Through the organisation named Aid Without Religion which was registered in July 2011, he has been helping people and institutions where there are no religious rituals, superstitious practices, unscientific systems of medicine and such supernatural beliefs. The registration was done at Rahu Kalam, a time of the day which is the most inauspicious - so it was a double rather a triple whammy, a Saturday, new moon day that too in the month of Ati which is considered to be the most unlucky time and at Rahu Kalam! He has been featured on National Geographic's television show Is it real?. He has also appeared on the Discovery Channel. He has been a regular columnist at the newspaper Mangalore Today since its inception. He also serves on the editorial board of the Folks Magazine. He has admitted to have been attacked for his activism a few times. He also has stated that his scooter's brake wires were once found severed, after an astrologer predicted his death or injury. He was also involved in fighting against Midbrain activation, an alleged modern technique that enables students to see objects despite being blindfolded. Views Nayak advocates that more people should be taught to perform the so-called miracles of godmen. He also advocates that people should be trained to recognize pseudoscience and demand scientific evidence. He holds the opinion that well-known scientists should be convinced to join the cause and form pressure groups against pseudoscience. He is also lobbying for a bill for the separation of state and religion to be introduced in the Indian parliament. After the murder of anti-superstition activist Narendra Dabholkar and enactment of the anti-superstition ordinance in Maharashtra state, Nayak expressed the need of a similar law in Karnataka.

It became the first stop out of Bradford on the Midland Railway (originally the Leeds and Bradford Railway), built in 1846. The Midland became part of the LMS in 1923, and British Railways in 1948. Manningham station opened on 17 February 1868. It was located north of the bridge of Queens Road (A6177 road) across the railway line. From 1872, there was an extensive network of sidings and sheds, known as Manningham motive power depot, to the north of the station. The station was closed following the Beeching Axe on 20 March 1965; unlike the next station on the line, Frizinghall, it has not reopened. In the 1950s, and up to closure in 1965, the Bradford Railway Circle used a hut on the platform at Manningham station for its meetings. Possible re-opening The map on the back of 'Canal Road News', Issue 1 (March 2006), published by the canal Road Business Forum, marks 'Potential Manningham Station' on approximately the site of the original station. However, this map (and the whole publication) is mainly about the proposed rebuilding of the Bradford Canal, and there is no mention of Manningham Station in the text. In January 2008, it was revealed that the City of Bradford prepared a bid to the Regional Transport Board for ¬£10 million, which, combined with the ¬£10 million the council received from the sale of Leeds Bradford Airport would provide funding for the reopening of Manningham station, as well as a number of other road infrastructure projects in the Aire Valley.

Kurmanjan was born into a rich family of the Mungush clan in the Osh region. At the age of 18 she was supposed to be married to a man whom she did not see until her wedding day. When she met him, she did not like him and broke with tradition ‚Äî first fleeing into neighboring China and later deciding to stay with her father, Mambatbai. In 1832, the local feudal lord, Alimbek, who had taken the title \\"Datka\\" and ruled all the Kyrgyz of the Alai, was attracted by the young, vivacious woman and married her. An instrumental politician in the increasingly decrepit Kokand khanate, Alimbek was murdered in the course of a palace coup in 1862 and his widow Kurmanjan was recognized by the khans of Bukhara and Kokand as ruler of the Alai and given the title of \\"Datka\\". In 1876 the Alai region was annexed by the Russian Empire. Recognizing the futility of resistance, Kurmanjan Datka persuaded her people to accept Russian overlordship. During the subsequent continuing unrest and sporadic attempts by the local population to shake off Russian supremacy, gun-running and smuggling were profitable businesses and two of Kurmanjan's sons and two of her grandsons were charged with contraband trade and murdering customs officials. When her favourite son was sentenced to death, she refused the urging of some of her followers to effect a rescue, saying that she would not let her private hopes and ambitions be the cause of suffering for her people; she actually attended her son's public execution. The others were then exiled to Siberia and she essentially retired from public life. In 1906, she was visited by Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim (later President of Finland) who was a colonel in the Russian army at the time. Mannerheim took her photograph. She died six months later. Kurmanjan Datka lived to be well over 90 and was survived by two sons, two daughters, 31 grandsons, 57 great grandsons and six great-great-grandsons.

There is no evidence that he actually existed. Alleged manifestations In the 1950s, psychic surgeon Z√© Arig√≥ (1918-1971) claimed to be operating as a channel for the spirit of a Dr. Adolf Fritz, a German doctor who had died in World War I. Arig√≥ became famous in Brazil and abroad, and was the subject of documentaries and books. Soon after predicting his own death, he died in an automobile accident. After Arig√≥'s death in a car accident, two brothers, Oscar and Edivaldo Wilde, claimed to channel the spirit of Dr. Fritz. Their careers were cut short when both died in violent car crashes. Following them was Edson Quieroz, a gynecologist. Quieroz treated hundreds of thousands of patients in the guise of Dr. Fritz, while further advancing the techniques of Arig√≥. He, too, met a violent death at the hand of a knife-wielding assailant. After Quieroz's death, Dr. Fritz has been allegedly channeled by Rubens Farias Jr. (1954- ) of S√£o Paulo; who claims that Dr. Fritz has predicted his own violent death. More recently Dr. Fritz manifests himself through Mr. Kleber Aran Ferreira da Silva who successfully attends patients on a monthly base and free of charge in Macei√≥, Aracaj√∫, Salvador and S√£o Paulo. Several other mediums have been reportedly able to channel Dr. Fritz' spirit. Most times operations are performed with the tip of the finger, no physical incision necessary, even though in some cases a light scar of the incision as well as of the stitches can be shortly seen. When asked about the improbability of the same spirit being channeled by more than one medium at the same time, some entities have indicated that the spirit does not follow the same rules of time and space that we do and, therefore, wields such an ability. Alleged biography In a mediunic interview, channeled by Arig√≥, the spirit of Dr. Fritz said that he had been born in Munich. His father suffered from asthma and a doctor recommended that he move to a place with a better climate, so the family moved to Poland when the boy was only four years old. Forced to work when he was young because of his parent's premature death, Fritz studied medicine on his own. One month before graduating, a general came into his office with his daughter in his arms, and despite his efforts, Fritz could not save her. The officer accused Fritz of her death and had him put in jail, where he suffered all sorts of tortures. He escaped from the jail and fled to Estonia, where he lived from 1914 until his death in 1918. Exhaustive research has found no mention of a doctor with any of those names in German records. Followers of Arig√≥ have retorted that the name provided by the spirit, as well as the German-like accent of his channels, were probably faked by Dr. Fritz himself, in order to preserve his true identity. Skeptics insist that the psychic surgeons themselves have invented the entity.

The class was built between 1954 and 1969, and delivered in two series, Di 3a and Di 3b. They are based on the Electro-Motive Division F7 and are equipped with EMD 567 engines. They have a distinct bulldog nose and were numbered 602‚Äì633 (a-series) and 641‚Äì643 (b-series). The locomotives had a prime mover that gives a power output of . The a-series has a Co‚Ä≤Co‚Ä≤ wheel arrangement, while the b-series has (A1A)(A1A). The b-series has higher top speed, but lower tractive effort. The class was the dominant locomotive on NSB's unelectrified lines. It was ordered as part of the company's dieselization of services during the 1950s and 1960s, and was initially used on the three mainline routes of the Bergen, Dovre and Nordland Lines. In the 1960s the Bergen and Dovre Lines were electrified and the Di 3 units transferred to smaller lines, such as the Mer√•ker, Valdres, R√∏ros, Sol√∏r and Rauma Lines. They remained in service with NSB until 2001, five years later than planned due to NSB returning their successor, the Di 6. The units are still in use by the private operator Ofotbanen, the Kosovo Railways, an operator in Sicily, and the Norwegian Railway Museum. The class is similar to the DSB Class MY, NMBS Class 52‚Äì54, CFL Class 1600 and M√ÅV M61.  Construction  Di 3.626 at Bod√∏ Station in 1991 The first diesel locomotive used by NSB was a single Di 1 unit delivered in 1942. It was more cost- efficient than the steam locomotives used on the non-electrified lines, and in 1945, NSB decided that it would not order more steam locomotives. General Motors' Electro Motive Division (EMD) made a bid to deliver twelve units based on their F7, and NSB agreed to lease a single unit for trial. The body and mechanical components were built by NOHAB, the motors by ASEA and prime mover by EMD. While under production in 1954, GM shipped a G12 for trial in Norway and Sweden. It was tested on the express train on the Dovre Line on 7 August, but proved to have insufficient power, causing the train to be 20 minutes late. The trial unit from NOHAB was delivered on 17 September 1954. The first test runs in scheduled service were on the Nordland Line between Trondheim and Mo i Rana in October. There were no technical faults until 22 December, when a grounding error caused the locomotive to be grounded until 17 January. In March the unit was sent back to NOHAB and went on a marketing tour that would eventually reach Ankara, Turkey in 1955. Two Di 3 units in NSB \\"Nydesign\\" The locomotive returned to Norway on 1 July 1955, where it was numbered 602 and put into service on the Nordland Line. The trials were successful, with much higher regularity than the steam locomotives. The Di 3 was used eight days in a row, and then spent a single day in the depot. NSB signed an agreement with NOHAB for delivery of five further locomotives. This caused a public debate, because the domestic supplier Thune had offered to build a similar locomotive in cooperation with American Locomotive Company. The first delivery was made on 25 April 1957, and the order completed by July. In March 1957 NSB received permission to buy another eight locomotives. Delivery started in October and was completed on 1 June 1958. The order was supplemented with another six trains, with delivery in 1958. The Finnish State Railways (VR) ordered five units in 1959, but these were cancelled for political reasons. The units were offered to NSB for a reduced price. Three were designated Di 3b because they had a slight specification variation, with a (A1A)'(A1A)' wheel arrangement and higher top speed. Two units had come short enough in the production process that they could be given the same specifications as the other Di 3a units, but received a slightly longer body. The Di 3b were given the numbers 641‚Äì643. For part of 1960, no. 623 was leased by NOHAB and sent on a demonstration tour in Eastern Europe. This resulted in an order from the Hungarian State Railways, where it became the MAV M61. The R√∏ros Line was upgraded and the Bergen Line units transferred to Trondheim in 1960, but increased need for hauling forced NSB to not use the units on the R√∏ros Line until the delivery of the next batch of six units in 1965. The final delivery, of four units, was made in 1969.  Operation  NSB Di 3.616 at Trondheim Central Station preparing for departure on the express train on the Nordland Line in 1986 The initial use for the Di 3 was to operate the three non- electrified long-distance lines of NSB: the Bergen Line, the Dovre Line and the Nordland Line. Following the delivery of the first batch in 1957, they were from 2 June used on the Dovre Line, north of Otta to Trondheim, and further north along the Nordland Line to Mo i Rana. The stock was sufficient to replace all steam locomotives on the Nordland Line, and reduced travel time by one hour. From Hamar to Otta, the track did not have sufficient permitted axle load. From the second batch of eight units, five were put into service on the Bergen Line, the rest on the Dovre and Nordland Lines. Necessary upgrades of the permitted axle load had been made to the Dovre Line and Nordland Line, and the locomotives were in use from Hamar to Saltdal. On 30 November, the Nordland Line was completed to Fauske, and the full length operated with Di 3. The first section of the Bergen Line, the Gj√∏vik Line and the Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line, was electrified in February 1961. This allowed diesel and electric locomotives to haul all trains from Oslo to Bergen. In 1962 the Nordland Line was completed to Bod√∏, but the increased need for locomotives was more than compensated by the electrification of the Bergen Line being extended to √Öl. The first Di 3 ran on the R√∏ros Line in 1964, that had previously been denied due to bridges with insufficient axle load permits. In 1965, the Bergen Line was electrified, and all but one Di 3 was transferred to Trondheim. A single unit, usually no. 610, was stationed at Finse Station as a snowplow. Along with additional deliveries, there were sufficient Di 3 units to terminate most steam operations. After the Bergen Line was electrified, the work continued on the Dovre Line. The section from Hamar to Otta was finished in 1967, and the following year to Domb√•s. This allowed the locomotives to be transferred to secondary lines. With the final delivery of the last units in 1969 and the completion of the electrification of the Dovre Line in 1970, the final steam locomotive was taken out of service. During the last half of the 1960s, the Di 3 was put into service on the Rauma Line, the R√∏ros Line, the Sol√∏r Line, the Valdres Line and the Mer√•ker Line. NSB Di 3.633 at Fagernes Station in 1986 In November 1970, the Dovre Line was electrified, and the last steam locomotives were retired. A long-term plan to electrify half the lines was finished, and for two decades, NSB's operations were very stable with no major investments to infrastructure or closing of lines. NSB had slightly less diesel locomotives than they needed, but plans to order additional Di 3 was never fulfilled. In 1981, NSB took delivery of five Di 4 to supplement the older units. They were mainly used on the Nordland Line, and Di 3 units were predominantly used on the other lines, although they continued to operate som trains on the Nordland Line. On 1 April 1987, a Di 3 612 caught on fire; the damage was small enough that it could have been repaired, but NSB instead decided to put aside the unit. At the time NSB planned to order additional Di 4, but these plans were put on hold. In 1988, the Valdres Line was closed; this was the only time a line with Di 3 in regular service was closed. During the 1980s, NSB started leasing SJ T44-locomotives from Sweden to supplement the Di 3. In 1992, the decision was made to order 12 Di 6 and 20 Di 8 to replace the Di 3. The former was based on the Di 4 and had twice the power of the Di 3. The Di 8 was slightly more powerful than the Di 3, and were intended for freight trains. Both series were put into service in 1996, but the Di 6 proved to have so many technical problems that they were returned to Siemens in 1998. The Di 3 units had been set aside and some had been scrapped, but the return of the Di 6 forced NSB to put the units back into service. An ore train of the Kosovo Railways being hauled by no. 008 During the mid-1990s, NSB had initiated a program to replace the traditional locomotive and carriage trains with new, tilting multiple units. This had led to the order of sixteen Class 73 four-car units for the three mainline routes on the Bergen Line, Dovre Line and S√∏rland Line. To supplement this, the board of NSB decided on 14 November 1996 to purchase seven tilting diesel multiple units for the R√∏ros and Rauma Lines. The choice fell on Class 93, with fifteen units eventually delivered. This allowed all passenger trains on diselized lines to either be operated with Class 93 be hauled by the Di 4. The last Di 3-hauled train ran on 7 January 2001. = Post-NSB = With the delivery of Class 93, NSB started to retire or sell the Di 3. In November 2001, five units were sold for NOK 250,000 each‚Äîwell under market price‚Äîto the new private operator Ofotbanen. The purchase raised controversy, because the potential operator Banetransport had offered full market price for the trains. One year after delivery, six of eleven Class 93-locomotives were out of order. To solve the problem, NSB had to rent back used Di 3 locomotives from Ofotbanen. NSB had chosen to sell the old locomotives for less than market price, but Ofotbanen demanded that NSB pay the entire purchase price for the short-term rental back. Four units (619, 633, 641 and 643) were sold to the United Nations and was put into service in Kosovo, in what has since become the Kosovo Railways. Four units (622, 626, 630 and 631) were sold to an operator in Sicily, Italy. The Norwegian National Rail Administration bought one unit (628) for maintenance, and has painted it yellow. The Norwegian Railway Museum in Hamar has preserved four units (602, 615, 616 and 642), of which two (602 and 616) were operated by GM-Gruppen and one (615) is kept for spare parts. NSB has kept one unit as reserve at √Öl Station. The remaining units have been scrapped, put aside or sold as spare part units.  Specifications  Two Di 3 units Ofotbanen design The Di 3 was built by Nydquist och Holm of Trollh√§tten, Sweden, as part of a series of GM EMD AA16 locomotives in Europe. They are technically similar to the DSB Class MY of Denmark and the MAV M61 of Hungary. The locomotives are powered by a 16-cylinder EMD 16.567 C or E engine that has a power output of at 835 revolutions per minute (rpm). The engines power an EMD D32 or D12 generator that feeds six ASEA LJB76 or LJB84 motors on a Di 3a. The Di 3b is equipped with four EMD D40 or D77B motors. This gives a tractive effort of for the a-series and for the b-series. The motors have a power output of . The maximum speed is for the a-series and for the b-series. The steel bodies are long. The longer length is for the three b-series units and the two a-series locomotives that were made in the batch, originally intended for VR. The a-series has a Co'Co' wheel arrangement, while the b-series has a (A1A)'(A1A)' arrangement, where the center of the three axles on each bogie is unpowered. The wheels have a wheel diameter and the locomotives have a weight of for the a-series and for the b-series. The trains can be run in multiple with the Di 4, Di 6 and Di 8. All the Di 3 engines featured a bulldog nose, the only locomotive type in Norway to do so. The locomotives were at first delivered in a dark green livery, but during the 1960s this was changed to red, and the last delivered units never had a green scheme.

The nearest towns are Kodungallur and Paravoor. Azikode is a part of Kodungallur taluk. Azhikode has a beach known as the munakkal beach. It has got the vast shore stretch around 3 km along the main beach side. It is the main attraction of this village. The main economic activity is fishing. History Azhikode was one of the major ports that linked Kerala to international trade and commerce. First church in India in the name of St. Thomas, who came here for the propagation of Christianity, is situated here. It is here where St. Thomas the apostle of Christ landed. The Cristian community of India had its inception here. St. Thomas is traditionally believed to have sailed to India in 52AD to spread the Christian faith among the Jews, the Jewish diaspora present in Kerala at the time. He is supposed to have landed at the ancient port of Muziris (which became extinct in 1341 AD due to a massive flood which realigned the coasts) near Kodungalloor. He then went to Palayoor (near present-day Guruvayoor), which was a Hindu priestly community at that time. He left Palayoor in AD 52 for the southern part of what is now Kerala State, where he established the Ezharappallikal, or \\"Seven and Half Churches\\". These churches are at Kodungallur, Kollam, Niranam (Niranam St. Mary's Orthodox Church, Nilackal (Chayal), Kokkamangalam, Kottakkavu, Palayoor (Chattukulangara) and Thiruvithancode Arappally ‚Äì the half church. According to Indian Christian tradition, St. Thomas landed in Kodungallur in AD 52, in the company of a Jewish merchant Abbanes (Hebban). There were Jewish colonies in Kodungallur since ancient times and Jews continue to reside in Kerala till today, tracing their ancient history. Transportation and Occupation Azhikode Munakkal BeachAzhikode Old harbour situated on the shores Periyar(Kottapuram) river joins Arabian sea, in Kodungallur Taluk. Azhikode was repeatedly eroded by tsunamis. The port that was situated in the old harbour was an important source of trade and commerce prior to British invasion. Azhikode is well connected by a series of canals. The famous Kodungallur Bhagavathy temple and Cheraman Juma Masjid is around 10 km away from this place. Fishing and tourism are the main sources of revenue in this region. Traditional boats are still used for fishing in this area. Chinese fishing nets are still deployed for fishing. This region also has abundant cultivation of coconut. Shrimp cultivation is another major industry that contributes to the economy in this region  References  Category:Villages in Thrissur district ","title":"Azhikode, Thrissur"},{"id":"3595797","text":"Seven Devils is a solitaire game in the style of Canfield played with two decks of playing games. It is considered to be a very difficult solitaire game.Thomas Warfield, The 4 Solitaire Games You Should Win Before You Die, 24 March 2015. Rules Two decks (104 cards) are used. Twenty-eight cards are dealt out to seven diminishing columns with the bottom card of each column face up, and a further seven cards (the \\"devils\\") are dealt face up to the right of the columns. The aim is to move all the cards into thirteen-card sequences on the goal piles (at the right of the board), ascending in sequence and following suit, starting with the aces. Cards on the table can be stacked red-on-black in descending sequence. Any card can be used to fill an empty column. Only one card can be moved at a time. Some variations of Seven Devils let you move several cards if there are empty columns as if the empty columns were used as temporary spots. The seven devils in the reserve stack cannot be placed on other stacks, and can be moved only to the goal piles. Difficulty The difficulty of this game arises from four factors: *Many games are not winnable from the start. If two higher cards overlie any card in the same suit in the reserve, the lower card can never be reached. *Even if this is not the case, if high cards overlie lower ones in the reserve, the low cards can be very difficult to reach. *If low cards, such as twos or threes, cannot be played to a column, they will be buried in the discard pile and become difficult to retrieve. *Key low cards may be hidden face down in columns where they may well prove inaccessible.

It was first described by George Albert Boulenger in 1890. Dendrelaphis wickrorum from Sri Lanka was previously confused with this species.  Habitat and ecology  This oviparous, diurnal and arboreal species can be found in trees, shrubs and bushes in wet and intermediate zones of lowlands to mid hills. However, there are references of finding it from Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Trincomalee of northern dry zone of Sri Lanka. It is often encountered on low vegetation, however, and it may also descend to the ground in search of food. Arboreal and feeds on frogs, geckos, skinks and agamid lizards. Sometimes descends to the ground, and it is said that when moving on the ground it has a peculiar habit of keeping its head and 1/8 of the forebody erect. These are very active and do not get panicked easily. Dendrelaphis is one of the quickest snakes to escape and hide, when exited they expose the skin underneath scales. Ventral keels help them to climb trees. Description Cylindrical, narrow, slender body is present with a dorso-ventrally flattened pear-shaped head. The neck region is clear. Long and compressed snout is present. The tip of it is broad and rounded. The nostrils are present laterally and they are rounded. Round pupil is present in large eyes. Prehensile tail is 1/3 of the body of the snake. Dorsal body of the snake is copper color. Top of the labials and chin is cream or light green color. The tongue is red in color. There is a black broad bar at the sides of the head and run along the eye to the neck region. Lateral corner of the anterior body has black cross strips in a diagonal angle. Two yellow lines run on the lateral sides of the body. Sometimes these lines may be margined by black dots. Ventral body is yellowish green. These are oviparous snakes. They lay eggs in tree hollows. Five long eggs are laid by them at a time. Adult snakes grow about 700‚Äì900 mm. Mid-body consists of 15 rows of scales. Vertebrals are clear and enlarged. Dendrelaphis bifrenalis differ in having a red color tongue from other Dendrelaphis species.

This article focuses on the period from c. 1500 to the mid-19th century, when sailing warships were replaced with steam-powered ironclads. Overview =Early history= Since ancient times, war at sea had been fought much as on land: with melee weapons and bows and arrows, but on floating wooden platforms rather than battlefields. Though the introduction of guns was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to- ship combat. The first guns on ships were small wrought-iron pieces mounted on the open decks and in the fighting tops, often requiring only one or two men to handle them. They were designed to injure, kill or simply stun, shock and frighten the enemy prior to boarding.Rodger (1997), pp. 205‚Äì6 . As guns were made more durable to withstand stronger gunpowder charges, they increased their potential to inflict critical damage to the vessel rather than just its crew. Since these guns were much heavier than the earlier anti-personnel weapons, they had to be placed lower in the ships, and fire from gunports, to avoid ships becoming unstable. In Northern Europe the technique of building ships with clinker planking made it difficult to cut ports in the hull; clinker-built (or clench-built) ships had much of their structural strength in the outer hull. The solution was the gradual adoption of carvel-built ships that relied on an internal skeleton structure to bear the weight of the ship.Marsden (2003), pp. 137‚Äì142. The development of propulsion during the 15th century from single-masted, square-rigged cogs to three-masted carracks with a mix of square and lateen sails made ships nimbler and easier to manoeuvre.Rodger (1997), pp. 71‚Äì72 . Gunports cut in the hull of ships had been introduced as early as 1501. According to tradition the inventor was a Breton shipwright called Descharges, but it is just as likely to have been a gradual adaptation of loading ports in the stern of merchant vessels that had already been in use for centuries.Rodger (1997), p. 207. Initially, the gunports were used to mount heavy so-called stern chasers pointing aft, but soon gun ports migrated to the sides of ships. This made possible coordinated volleys from all the guns on one side of a ship, broadsides, for the first time in history, at least in theory. Guns in the 16th century were considered to be in fixed positions and were intended to be fired independently rather than in concerted volleys. It was not until the 1590s that the word \\"broadside\\" in English was commonly used to refer to gunfire from the side of a ship rather than the ship's side itself.Rodger (1996), pp. 312, 316. Naval tactics throughout the 16th century and well into the 17th century, however, was focused on countering the oar-powered galleys that were armed with heavy guns in the bow, facing forwards, which were aimed by turning the entire ship against its target. Though far less seaworthy than sailing vessels and highly vulnerable to boarding by ships that rode higher in the water, the galleys were a serious threat due to their ability to aim accurate heavy gunfire low in the hulls of larger sailing ships and to escape solely sail-powered opponents by rowing into the wind. =Initial tactics= The line of battle tactic that allowed efficient use of broadside fire was not put into general use until the mid 17th century, as was described by English General at Sea Robert Blake in his Laws of War and Ordinances of the sea. The previous solution was to make sailing ships fire backwards from the stern, as a defensive measure, or forward from the bow, as an offensive measure. The latter was only partially achieved either by canting (angling) the side guns towards the bow or stern as far as the ship's structure would allow, or by placing guns on the sterncastle and fire them in an arc on either side of the forecastle. Both solutions were problematic since they created a blind spot dead ahead and made it especially difficult to hit low-lying targets, like galleys. The method that was deemed most effective by contemporaries was to simply counter the threat of galleys with other galleys. Despite the technical innovations, naval cannon fire also remained grossly inaccurate except at very close ranges. Difficulties in achieving standardization in metallurgy meant that all guns allowed for considerable \\"windage\\", meaning that bore diameters were about 10 percent larger than their ammunition. Combined with inefficient gunpowder and the difficulties inherent in firing accurately from moving platforms meant that naval tactics for sailing ships throughout the 16th century remained focused on boarding as a means of decisive victory.Rodger (1996); Rodger (1997), pp. 206‚Äì8, 215. Naval tactics in the Age of Sail were primarily determined by the sailing and fighting qualities of the sailing warships of the time. Three factors, in particular, constrained what a sailing admiral could order his fleet to do. * The first constraint was that, like all sailing vessels, sailing warships could not sail directly into the wind. Most could sail not much closer than 70 degrees off the wind. This limited the maneuverability of a fleet during battles at close quarters. Holding the weather gage, i.e. being upwind of one's opponent, conferred considerable tactical advantages. * The second constraint was that the ships of the time carried their guns in two large batteries, one on each broadside, with only a few mounted to fire directly ahead or astern. The sailing warship was immensely powerful on its sides, but very weak on its bow and stern. The sides of the ship were built with strong timbers, but the stern, in particular, was fragile with a flimsy structure around the large windows of the officers' cabins. The bow and, particularly, the stern of the ship were vulnerable to raking fire. Raking another ship by firing the length of a ship from either the bow or stern caused tremendous damage, because a single shot would fly down the length of the decks, while the ship being raked could not return fire with its broadsides. Moreover, the externally-mounted rudder was at the stern, and any hit there would render the ship essentially unsteerable and without the ability to maneuver, even with masts and sails intact. * The third constraint was the difficulty of communicating at sea. Written communication was almost impossible in a moving fleet, while hailing was extremely difficult above the noise of wind and weather. So admirals were forced to rely on a pre- arranged set of signal flags hoisted aboard the admiral's flagship. In the smoke of battle, these were often hard or impossible to see. The 16th century saw the development of the man-of-war, a truly ocean-going warship, carrying square-rigged sails that permitted tacking into the wind, and heavily armed with cannons. The adoption of heavy guns necessitated their being mounted lower down than on top of the fore and after castles as previously where anti- personnel weapons had been positioned through the later Middle Ages, due to the possibility of capsizing. This meant that what had earlier been the hold of a ship that could be used either as a merchant ship or warship was now full with cannon and ammunition. Hence ships became specialised as warships, which would lead to a standing fleet instead of one based on placing temporary contracts. The man-of-war eventually rendered the galley obsolete except for operations close to shore in calm weather. With the development of the sailing man-of-war, and the beginning of the great sailing fleets capable of keeping at sea for long periods together, came the need for a new adaptation of old principles of naval tactics. A ship that depended on the wind for its motive power could not hope to ram. A sailing vessel could not ram unless it was running before a good breeze. In a light wind, the charge would be ineffective, and it could not be made at all from leeward. It could still board, and the Spanish did for long make it their main object to run their bow over an enemy's sides, and invade the deck. In order to carry out this kind of attack they would naturally try to get to windward and then bear down before the wind in line abreast ship upon ship. But an opponent to leeward could always baffle this attack by edging away, and in the meantime fire with his broadside to cripple his opponent's spars. An important organizational innovation was made by Sir Francis Drake. Prior to his leadership, a warship was typically run by a committee of the sailing master, navigator, master- gunner and captain of marines presided over by an aristocrat. Drake saw no purpose in having a member of the aristocracy without specialist knowledge and established the principle that the captain of the ship would be in sole command, based upon his skill and experience rather than social position. This transformation was never quite made in the Spanish Navy where the \\"gentlemen\\" continued to obstruct operations throughout the Age of Sail. The Revolutionary French Navy made an opposite mistake in promoting seamen without sufficient experience or training, which worked well in the army, but not at sea. The Royal Navy by contrast was well served by many distinguished commanders of middle-class origin, such as Horatio Nelson (son of a parson), Jervis (son of a solicitor) or Collingwood (son of a butcher) as well as by aristocrats who proved themselves at sea such as Thomas Cochrane and even members of the working-class, such as John Benbow.Rodger (2004), p.205 Line of battle A French galley and Dutch man-of-war off a port by Abraham Willaerts, painted 17th century. The first recorded mention of the use of a line of battle tactic is attested from 1500. The Instructions provided in 1500 by King Manuel I of Portugal to the commander of a fleet dispatched to the Indian Ocean suggests its use predated the written instructions. Portuguese fleets overseas deployed in line ahead, firing one broadside and then putting about in order to return and discharge the other, resolving battles by gunnery alone. In a treatise of 1555, The Art of War at Sea, Portuguese theorist on naval warfare and shipbuilding, Fern√£o de Oliveira, recognized that at sea, the Portuguese \\"fight at a distance, as if from walls and fortresses...\\". He recommended the single line ahead as the ideal combat formation. The Cambridge Illustrated History of Warfare: The Triumph of the West - Geoffrey Parker, pp. 125‚Äì130, Cambridge University Press, 1995 An early line of battle tactic had been used by the Fourth Portuguese India Armada in the battle of Calicut, under Vasco da Gama in 1502, near Malabar, against a Muslim fleet.Geoffrey Parker, The Military Revolution, p. 94 One of the earliest recorded deliberate uses is also documented in the First Battle of Cannanore between the Third Portuguese India Armada under Jo√£o da Nova and the naval forces of Calicut, earlier in the same year.Marinha.pt, 2009, site Cananor - 31 de Dezembro de 1501 a 2 de Janeiro de 1502 This early use of this strategy also consisted in its implementation, in both battles, on only one side of the contenders. The evolution of naval cannons during the first half of the 17th century soon led to the conclusion that the fleet had to fight in a single line to make the maximum use of its firepower without one ship's getting in the way of another. The line of battle was traditionally attributed to the navy of the Commonwealth of England and especially to General at Sea Robert Blake who wrote the Sailing and Fighting Instructions of 1653. One of the first documented deliberate uses seems to be somewhat earlier in the Action of 18 September 1639 by Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp against the Spanish. The tactic was used by both sides in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, and was codified in written 'fighting instructions'. These formed the basis of the whole tactical system of the 17th and 18th centuries in naval warfare. One consequence of the line of battle was that a ship had to be strong enough to stand in it. In the old type of m√™l√©e battle a small ship could seek out an opponent of her own size, or combine with others to attack a larger one. As the line of battle was adopted, navies began to distinguish between vessels that were fit to form parts of the line in action, and the smaller ships that were not. By the time the line of battle was firmly established as the standard tactical formation during the 1660s, merchant ships and lightly armed warships became less able to sustain their place in a pitched battle. In the line of battle, each ship had to stand and fight the opposing ship in the enemy line, however powerful she might be. The purpose-built ships powerful enough to stand in the line of battle came to be known as a ship of the line. Importance of the weather gage Holding the weather, or windward, gage conferred several important tactical advantages. The admiral holding the weather gage held the tactical initiative, able to accept battle by bearing down on his opponent or to refuse it, by remaining upwind. The fleet with the lee gage could avoid battle by withdrawing to leeward, but could not force action. Even retreating downwind could be difficult once two fleets were at close quarters because the ships risked being raked as they turned downwind. A second disadvantage of the leeward gage was that in anything more than a light wind, a sailing ship that is sailing close hauled (or beating) will heel to leeward under the pressure of the wind on its sails. The ships of a fleet on the leeward gage heel away from their opponents, exposing part of their bottoms to shot. If a ship is penetrated in an area of the hull that is normally under water, she is then in danger of taking on water or even sinking when on the other tack. This is known as \\"hulled between wind and water\\". Finally, smoke from the gunfire of the ships to windward would blow down on the fleet on the leeward gage. So it was common for battles to involve days of manoeuvring as one admiral strove to take the weather gage from his opponent in order to force him to action, as at the battles of Ushant (1778), St Lucia Channel (1780) and the First of June (1794). Only in heavy weather could the windward gage become a disadvantage, because the lower gun ports on the leeward side of a ship would be awash, preventing her from opening her lower-deck ports to use the guns ‚Äì or risking being swamped if she did. So, in strong winds, a ship attacking from windward would not be able to bring her heavy lower-deck guns into action, while the enemy ship to leeward would have no such problem as the guns on her windward side would be raised by the heel. For this reason, Admiral Rodney ordered his ships to attack the Spanish from leeward in the stormy weather at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent in 1780. Development of tactics in the French Navy In the French Navy, sailing tactics were developed by the treatises of the French tacticians Paul Hoste, Bigot de Morogues and Bourde de Villehuet, which developed the traditional code of practice and were all translated into other languages. During the 18th century, French governments developed the strategic doctrine of focusing on the mission, rather than fighting for command of the sea. The French government was often reluctant to take tactical risks to achieve its strategic objectives. The navy was hampered by the timidity of its orders. French fleets and squadrons typically sought to avoid battle rather than risk a contest with a British force, as De Ternay did in June 1780 on meeting a smaller British squadron under Cornwallis off Bermuda. This strategy had important tactical ramifications. French ships tended to fire at the rigging of their opponents to disable them and allow the French ships to escape and continue with their mission. French ships typically fired their broadsides on the upward roll of the ship, disabling their opponents but doing little damage to the enemy ships or their crews. This was compounded by the French tendency to fight from the leeward gage, causing the guns to point high as the ships heeled with the wind. British and Dutch ships, by contrast, tended to use the opposite tactic of firing on the downward roll into the enemy hulls, causing a storm of flying splinters that killed and maimed the enemy gun crews. This difference in tactics goes some way to explaining the difference in casualty figures between British and French crews, with French fleets tending to suffer not only more casualties but also a higher proportion of killed than wounded. Tactical stagnation in the mid-18th century When the conflict came to be between the British and the French in the 18th century, battles between equal or approximately equal forces became largely inconclusive. The French, who had fewer ships than the British throughout the century, were anxious to fight at the least possible cost, lest their fleet should be worn out by severe action, leaving Britain with an unreachable numerical superiority. Therefore, they preferred to engage to leeward, a position which left them free to retreat before the wind. They allowed the British fleet to get to windward, and, when it was parallel with them and bore up before the wind to attack, they moved onwards. The attacking fleet had then to advance, not directly before the wind with its ships moving along lines perpendicular to the line attacked, but in slanting or curving lines. The assailants would be thrown into \\"a bow and quarter line\\" ‚Äì with the bow of the second level with the after part of the first and so on from end to end. In the case of a number of ships of various powers of sailing, it was a difficult formation to maintain. The result was often that the ships of the attacking line which were steering to attack the enemy's centre came into action first and were liable to be crippled in the rigging. If the same formation was to be maintained, the others were now limited to the speed of the injured vessels, and the enemy to leeward slipped away. At all times a fleet advancing from windward was liable to injury in spars, even if the leeward fleet did not deliberately aim at them. The leeward ships would be leaning away from the wind, and their shot would always have a tendency to fly high. So long as the assailant remained to windward, the ships to leeward could always slip off. The wars of the 18th century produced a series of tactically indecisive naval battles between evenly matched fleets in line ahead, such as M√°laga (1704), R√ºgen Island (1715), Toulon (1744), Minorca (1756), Negapatam (1758), Cuddalore (1758), Pondicherry (1759), Ushant (1778), Dogger Bank (1781), the Chesapeake (1781), Hogland (1788) and √ñland (1789). Although a few of these battles had important strategic consequences, like the Chesapeake which the British needed to win, all were tactically indecisive. Many admirals began to believe that a contest between two equally matched fleets could not produce a decisive result. The tactically decisive actions of the 18th century were all chase actions, where one fleet was clearly superior to the other, such as the two battles of Finisterre (1747), and those at Lagos (1759), Quiberon Bay (1759) and Cape St. Vincent (1780). British naval innovation was retarded by an unseemly dispute between two Admirals in the aftermath of the Battle of Toulon. The British fleet under Admiral Thomas Mathews had been unable to draw level with the French fleet but Mathews nevertheless ordered an attack, intending all the British ships to attack the French rear. He had no signals by which he could communicate his intentions, and the rear squadron under Vice Admiral Richard Lestock, his rival and second-in-command, obtusely remained at the prescribed intervals in line ahead, far to the rear of the action. A subsequent series of courts-martial, in which political influence was brought to bear by Lestock's friends in Parliament, punished Mathews and those captains who had supported him in the battle, and vindicated Lestock. In several future actions, Admirals who were tempted to deviate from the Admiralty's fighting instructions were reminded of Mathews's fate.Rodger (2004), pp.243-245 Developments during the American War of Independence The unsatisfactory character of the accepted method of fighting battles at sea had begun to be obvious to naval officers, both French and British, by the later 18th century and began to be addressed during the numerous battles of the American War of Independence. It was clear that the only way to produce decisive results was to concentrate the attack on part of the enemy's line, preferably the rear since the centre would have to turn to its support. The great French admiral Suffren condemned naval tactics as being little better than so many excuses for avoiding a real fight. He endeavoured to find a better method, by concentrating superior forces on parts of his opponent's line in some of his actions with the British fleet in the East Indies in 1782 and 1783, such as the Battle of Sadras where Suffren tried to double the rear of the British line. But his orders were ill obeyed, his opponent Sir Edward Hughes was competent, and the quality of his fleet was not superior to the British. Similarly, the British admiral Rodney, in the Battle of Martinique in the West Indies in 1780, tried to concentrate a superior force on part of his enemy's line by throwing a greater number of British ships on the rear of the French line. But his directions were misunderstood and not properly executed. Moreover, he did not then go beyond trying to place a larger number of ships in action to windward against a smaller number to leeward by arranging them at a lesser distance than two-cables length. An enemy who took the simple and obvious course of closing his line could baffle the attack, and while the retreat to leeward remained open could still slip away. Like Suffren, Rodney was a great tactician, but a difficult man to work with who failed to explain his intentions to his subordinates. Rodney's success in breaking the French line brought on a decisive engagement at the Battle of the Saintes At the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782, Rodney was induced, by a change in the wind and the resulting disorder in the French line, to break his own line and pass through the enemy line. The effect was decisive. The guns of the British ships were concentrated on a handful of French ships as the British broke through the French line in three places, and the tactical cohesion of the French fleet was destroyed. By the end of the battle, Rodney had taken the French flagship and four other ships. The successful result of this departure from the old practice of keeping the line intact throughout the battle ruined the moral authority of the orthodox system of tactics. =Sir John Clerk of Eldin= The inconclusive results of so many battles at sea interested Sir John Clerk of Eldin (1728‚Äì1812), a gentleman of the Scottish Enlightenment, illustrator of geologist James Hutton's Theory of the Earth, and great-uncle of James Clerk Maxwell. He began developing a series of speculations and calculations which he initially published in pamphlets, distributing them among naval officers, and published in book form as An Essay on Naval Tactics in 1790, 1797 and 1804. The hypothesis which governed all of Clerk's demonstrations was that as the British navy was superior in gunnery and seamanship to their enemy, it was in their interest to produce a m√™l√©e. He advanced various ingenious suggestions for concentrating superior forces on parts of the enemy's line ‚Äì by preference on the rear, since the centre must lose time in turning to its support. Technical innovations in the late 18th century By the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, a series of technical innovations first introduced during the American War of Independence had combined to give the British fleet a distinct superiority over the ships of the French and Spanish navies. These innovations were: * The carronade: the carronade was a short-barrelled gun which threw a heavy ball developed by the Carron Company, a Scottish ironworks, in 1778. Because of irregularities in the size of cannonballs and the difficulty of boring out gun barrels there was usually a considerable gap between the ball and the bore - often as much as a quarter of an inch - with a consequent loss of efficiency. This gap was known as the \\"windage\\". The manufacturing practices introduced by the Carron Company reduced the windage considerably, enabling the ball to be fired with less powder and hence a smaller and lighter gun. The carronade was half the weight of an equivalent long gun, but could throw a heavy ball over a limited distance. The light weight of the carronade meant that the guns could be added to the forecastle and quarterdeck of frigates and ships of the line, increasing firepower without affecting the ship's sailing qualities. It became known as the ‚Äúsmasher‚Äù and gave ships armed with carronades a great advantage at short range. * The flintlock: flintlock firing mechanisms for cannon were suggested by Captain Sir Charles Douglas and introduced during the American War of Independence in place of the traditional matches. Flintlocks enabled a higher rate of fire and greater accuracy as the gun captain could choose the exact moment of firing. Prior to this the Royal Navy introduced the use of goose quills filled with powder during the Seven Years' War giving an almost instantaneous burn time compared with earlier methods of detonation. * A wider field of fire: by the simple expedient of attaching the gun ropes at a greater distance from the gunports, the British gunnery innovator Captain Sir Charles Douglas increased the range through which each cannon could be traversed, increasing the ship's field of fire. The new system was first tested at the Battle of the Saintes, in 1782, where the Duke, Formidable and Arrogant, and perhaps other British ships, had adopted Douglas's new system. * Copper sheathing: after many trials, copper was found to be a practicable means of protecting the hulls of ships from marine growth and fouling. Copper sheathing delayed the growth of weeds on the hull, improving the sailing performance of ships that had been long out of dock. This had significant strategic as well as tactical implications. Up to 1780, the British, who kept their ships at sea for longer periods, had almost always found that the clean French ships were faster and could therefore avoid battle if they wished. The introduction of copper sheathing meant that ships that had spent months on blockade were not necessarily at an immediate speed disadvantage to enemy ships coming freshly out of port. Developments during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars By the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, technical innovations and the disorganization of the French Navy wrought by the revolution had combined to give British ships a distinct superiority over the ships of the French and Spanish navies. Britain had a far larger ocean trade than any of her principal enemies, and a much bigger reserve of professional seamen from which to man her warships. Throughout the 18th century the French and, particularly, the Spanish navy suffered from serious manning difficulties and were often forced to complete the ships' crews with soldiers or landsmen. British ships not only had a higher proportion of seamen in the first place, but the long months at sea on blockade or convoy escort gave British captains plenty of opportunities to train their crews. British gun crews seem to have achieved a much higher rate of fire than French or Spanish gun crews, contributing to the much higher casualties suffered by ships from those fleets. The better seamanship, faster gunnery and higher morale of British crews was a decisive advantage that could not be compensated for by any amount of bravery on the part of their opponents. The leading British admirals like Howe devoted their thoughts to how to break the enemy's line in order to bring on the kind of pell mell battle that would bring decisive results. At the Battle of the First of June in 1794, Lord Howe ordered his fleet to steer through the enemy, and then to engage the French ships from the leeward, so as to cut off their usual retreat. This had the effect of bringing his fleet into a melee in which the individual superiority of his ships would have free play. Nelson's unorthodox head-on attack at the Battle of Trafalgar produced a m√™l√©e that destroyed the Franco-Spanish fleet Throughout the wars, which lasted, with a brief interval of peace, from 1793 to 1815, British admirals like Jervis, Duncan and particularly Nelson grew constantly bolder in the method they adopted for producing the desired m√™l√©e or pell-mell action at the battles of Cape St. Vincent, Camperdown and Trafalgar. The most radical tactic was the head-on approach in column used by Nelson at Trafalgar, which invited a raking fire to which his own ships could not reply as they approached, but then produced a devastating raking fire as the British ships passed through the Franco-Spanish line. It has sometimes been argued that the tactics of these British admirals were rash and would have proved disastrous if tried against more skilful opponents. But it has been remarked that \\"this is one of those criticisms which are of value only against those who think that there can be a magic efficacy in any particular attack, which makes its success infallible.\\" That the tactics of British admirals of the great wars of 1793‚Äì1815 had in themselves no such virtue was amply demonstrated at the Battle of Lissa in 1811. They were justified because the reliance of admirals on the quality of their fleets was well founded. It should be borne in mind that a vessel, while bearing down on an enemy's line, could not be exposed to the fire of three enemies at once when at a distance less than 950 yards, because the guns could not be trained to converge on a nearer point. The whole range of effective fire was only a thousand yards or a very little over. The chance that a ship would be dismasted and stopped before reaching the enemy's line was small. Fighting at anchor Towards the end of the period of sailing navies, a number of fights took place between defending fleets or squadron anchored close to the shore or in harbours, and attacking fleets forced to sail to within range while under fire. Such battles tended to be decisive, as a wind which was fair to allow the attackers to enter a harbour or anchorage would let neither side out again. As it would normally be more profitable for the attackers to blockade the enemy until they were forced to sortie to accept battle in open water, such attacks were usually forced by lack of time, e.g. by shortage of supplies, the threatened onset of bad weather or the need to coordinate operations with an army on land. The defenders could expect to enjoy several advantages. As they would not need to manoeuvre under sail, most of the ships' crews could man the guns. If properly prepared, the ships would have \\"springs\\"; extra cables bound to the anchor cables, which they could haul in or let out to veer the ship to bring its guns to bear over a wide arc. If close to a naval establishment (such as at the Battle of Copenhagen), they could rely on boats from the shore to bring extra ammunition or replacements for casualties and if in range the defending ships could be aided by coastal gun batteries. The worst British naval reverse of the Napoleonic wars occurred during an attack on a protected anchorage at the Battle of Grand Port.

The dimension is depicted as existing beyond the shadows of the world and part of the Marvel Universe. Its first reference was in Uncanny X-Men #330 (March 1996) where it was searched for the life-giving elixir called Ebony Vain.  Plot  When Psylocke was left in a coma after being fatally wounded by Sabertooth, Archangel and Wolverine decided to journey to the realm of the Crimson Dawn. Their intention was to use the Elixer called the Ebony Vein to save Psylocke's life. Logan and Archangel went to New York‚Äôs China Town to find the Crimson Dawn, and Dr. Strange, sensing their intent, joined their quest, which brought them to a Chinese restaurant. Inside they met Gomurr, the ancient, an old acquaintance of Logan. The access to the Crimson Dawn was hidden in the mouth of a huge paper dragon, and their way was blocked by several Undercloaks, ninjas with the ability to travel through shadows, but the four allies got through. Face to face with Tar, the elixir‚Äôs Proctor, Gomurr kneeled and begged for them to take some of it, but Tar refused, rather annoyed that he was only visited when someone needed something of him. He spirited Gomurr away, but while Logan kept Tar busy, Dr. Strange and Archangel approached the Ebon Vein. Actually the Elixir could only be used on people present, but Strange reached into Archangel‚Äôs heart and pulled out the part of Psylocke‚Äôs soul that she had entrusted to him, resembled by a beautiful figurine. As he shoved the icon of their love into the glowing sphere containing the Crimson Dawn, back in Westchester, Betsy‚Äôs life signs stabilized and as a result Psylocke obtained a scarlet mark over her left eye. Tar angrily expelled all three heroes from his realm and they found themselves back on Earth, along with Gomurr.Uncanny X-Men #328-330 Over the following months it became quite clear that the experience changed Betsy more than on a skin-deep level. She grew much colder and distanced herself from her lover and their friends. Even when she manifested the ability to shadow-port, Psylocke didn‚Äôt bother much nor tell anyone, one day startling the X-Men by teleporting into the mansion without warning. Just like them, Betsy understood that something was amiss with her, but she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to talk with anyone about her concerns.Uncanny X-Men #338 When she found herself under attack by a group of Undercloaks, she managed to fight them off all on her own, and did keep the battle secret, not even telling Warren despite the dark warriors having attacked her in his penthouse.X-Men (2nd series) #61 Later, it was revealed that their actions had also weakened the dimensional walls which allowed those who have been trapped in the Crimson Dawn, such as the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn, a group of monks from the last years of the Ming Dynasty, to escape the mystical realm. Journeying to the Wildways, another Magical dimension and the home of Spiral when not serving Mojo, they needed her help to teleport them to Earth, but when Spiral refused to aid them, she was threatened with torture that was even beyond her Body Shoppe‚Äôs capabilities and she reluctantly accepted to join them and received the mark of the Crimson Dawn.Excalibur #107 Actually Spiral thought she could outsmart the Dragons at one point, but the Crimson Dawn‚Äôs influence was too strong and she had no choice but to release them on Earth, namely in London, where they attacked by surprise Captain Britain. They took him prisoner to their native Hong Kong, where they wanted to channel his powers into breaching the dimensional wall to the Crimson Dawn, thus enslaving Earth.Excalibur #108 However, Spiral alerted Excalibur to the Dragons‚Äô plan, and teleported the team to Hong Kong. Another one trying to spoil the plan was Xiandu‚Äôs spirit, a monk with ties to the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn, who told Meggan, the only one to sense him, that like him the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn were from the time China was overrun by the barbarian Li-Tzu Ch‚Äôeng. They had prayed that the kingdom would be spared from the endless bloodshed, but the Ming dynasty ended anyway. Frustrated that their prayers hadn‚Äôt been answered, Xiandu and three of his friends, Ra‚Äôal, Barak and A‚Äôyin, went down the darkest road they would ever travel. They sought out the \\"Covenant of the Ebon Vein\\", and were inducted on the promise that China would be freed from its oppressors. The four of them tasted the life-giving elixir and were given the scarlet mark over their left eyes, however, Xiandu underestimated the might of the elixir and during the night, A'yin, Barak and Ra'al were corrupted by its powers and murdered Xiandu. By killing Xiandu they were transformed into the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn, and Xiandu would roam Earth as a spirit for centuries to come, awaiting for their inevitable escape from the Crimson realm. The spirit revealed to Meggan that not only her abilities but also her love for Brain was needed to rescue him and stop the two worlds from merging into one.Excalibur #109 While the rest of Excalibur temporarily held the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn at bay, Meggan helped Brian redirect the power flow, releasing it safely into the atmosphere. While Brian survived, he was Captain Britain no more, his powers gone. The Dragons left by melting into the shadows, vowing that one day they would succeed and rule Earth.Excalibur #110 Another creature to break through from the Crimson Dawn, was the demon Kuragari. He hunted down Tar, and magically wrested control over Tar‚Äôs servants from him, only proceeding to kill him to become the next Proctor of the Crimson Dawn. Gomurr found his old rival‚Äôs body, and gave him a decent burial. Knowing that Kuragari would come after Psylocke next, he tried to warn her and Archangel, but he happened to be too late. In the meantime, the two X-Men had once again been attacked by Undercloaks, this time leaving behind a strange ring. By the time Gomurr arrived, Betsy, somehow attracted to the piece of jewelry, was already wearing it on her finger, thus allowing Kuragari to abduct her to the Crimson Dawn realm. Gomurr also revealed to Warren that Kuragari was the one to send the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn in the first place. Apparently one can not take from the elixir without giving something in return, and as Psylocke‚Äôs debt had never been paid, Kuragari now thought to force her into becoming his bride. Psylocke tried to resist as hard as she could, but by the time Archangel arrived, sent after her by Gomurr, Betsy had already been transformed into a shadow creature. While Betsy left with Kuragari, Warren had to face an entire army of Undercloaks. Back on Earth, Tar‚Äôs spirit visited Gomurr, thanking him for the burial and explaining that their past years of enmity had only served one purpose ‚Äì training lessons for Gomurr to become the rightful next Proctor. Accepting the mantle passed on to him, Gomurr too crossed over to the Crimson Realm and helped Archangel. In order to release Betsy from the Dawn‚Äôs hold, Warren sacrificed an unknown amount of his own life-force to pay the debt. Now free of Kuragari‚Äôs influence, Betsy‚Äôs darkened skin vanished and together they managed to drive Kuragari away. While the lovers returned home, Gomurr remained behind in his new home.Psylocke & Archangel: Crimson Dawn #1-4 Further changes awaited Psylocke, as when she found herself tricked by the Shadow King into creating a psionic energy wave that temporarily disabled all psionic abilities on a world-wide scale, she manifested another ability thanks to the Crimson Dawn. Actually the Shadow King had torn apart Betsy‚Äôs astral self, leaving her twisted and disfigured. Betsy, though, rebuilt herself in a new black form and found that this shadow astral self was nearly impossible to be detected, eventually defeating the Shadow King.X-Men (2nd series) #78 References South Park External links * Article on the Crimson Dawn at Uncannyxmen.net Category:X-Men ","title":"Crimson Dawn"},{"id":"3595968","text":"Wilmorton College before the land was reused Wilmorton is a suburb of the city of Derby, England. It is situated between Alvaston and Osmaston, to the south of the city centre on the A6 from Deadman's Lane to the Canal Bridge; the former is aligned to the old town boundary and named from the medieval track that lead to the plague pit dug 1348 during the Great Plague or Black Death. Victims of the Black Death were buried there (the burial site is now under Pride Park). It was given the name Wilmorton by the post office in 1887. The area was named after Reverend Sir George Wilmot-Horton, 5th Baronet of Osmaston and was formed out of the Osmaston Hall estate which was broken up in the 1880s. Most of the original houses were built by the Midland Railway Company. A school was opened in 1893 and in 1904 a church in red brick dedicated to Saint Osmund was constructed. In 1796, the Derby Canal was built through Wilmorton which helped to bring a lot of trade to this area. The canal was closed in 1964 and converted to a cycle track, but work is being undertaken to restore it. A local public house next to the canal, named The Navigation, was originally built in 1796 when the canal opened, and re-built in 1895 to a design by the Derby architect James Wright. The other public house in Wilmorton is the Portland Hotel; this is on the corner of the London Road and Dickinson Street - and adjacent to Deadman's Lane. Behind the housing the London Midland and Scottish Railway Company constructed a railway college in 1937 in a neo-classical style. This is now known as Derby Conference centre. Wilmorton campus of Derby CollegeDerby College was built off Harrow Street (known as Derby College of Further Education and then Derby Tertiary College) and in around 2006 this was knocked down and redeveloped as housing - known as City Point. Some of the college facilities were transferred to a site on Nottingham Road called Mason's Place, and some to the main site in Mackworth. In the late 1990s, a new section of the A6 was built from here to \\"The Cockpitt\\" roundabout, passing through Pride Park, known as Pride Parkway. In 2013 local Councillor Linda Winter called a meeting at the YMCA on London Road to set up a Residents Association for the Wilmorton area. From this meeting it was clear that the now housing development at City Point had further issues specific to its construction so on 5 June 2013 they held another meeting just for City Point Residents. The residents have formed their own Residents Association - Called City Point Residents Association \\\\- which intends to be under the governance of the Wilmorton Residents Association when it is finally formed. City Point Residents also have a Facebook page for general discussions.

It concerned pirates from a vessel from the defeated Spanish Armada terrorizing citizens on the English coast. All goes well until the villagers realize the Spaniards have been defeated and revolt. The film was the first of several collaborations between Don Sharp and star Christopher Lee. Plot summary A pirate ship, involved in 1588 battles on the side of the Spanish Armada, suffers extensive damage and must put into a village on the British coast for repairs. The village is small and isolated and the Spanish convince the villagers that the English fleet has been defeated and that they, the Spanish, are now their masters. This results in the villagers' sullen cooperation, but rumours and unrest begin to spread and soon the Spanish pirates find themselves facing a revolt.

The studio made a swashbuckler, The Pirates of Blood River (1962), written by Jimmy Sangster and starring Christopher Lee; it was a success at the box office, so Hammer commissioned Sangster to write another pirate-themed story for Lee, The Devil Ship Pirates. \\"The idea was to release these bloody-but-not-too- bloody adventure films during school holidays, and they made a fortune on them,\\" said Don Sharp, who would direct Devil Ship. Sharp had just made his first feature for Hammer, Kiss of the Vampire and was invited back to work at the studio by Tony Hinds. Sharp says the film was aimed at the school holiday market so it needed to have a \\"U\\" certificate. \\"But they wanted it to look like a X film. So we had an action film with kids in it,\\" said Sharp.Koetting p 10 It was the first time Sharp had worked with Christopher Lee. The director had seen several of Lee's performances \\"and I was worried about a range I saw as playing down one line. But right from out first meeting we got on and when we talked it was two actors talking. We'd explore his character and I found myself suggesting depths to Captain Roebles that I hadn't expected I'd be able to. Chris is tremendously professional and can essay roles that are charming and threatening at the same time - he has a lovely stillness about him. He‚Äôs a very commanding presence.\\"Koetting p 11 =Shooting= Filming began in 19 August 1963 at Bray Studios in London. Sharp did not get along particularly well with producer Anthony Nelson Keys who he called \\"a general manager type and any idea he had was most obvious. I remember him telling me that he wanted Christopher Lee's pirate to be clad in blue and I said, ‚ÄòA blue pirate. Tony? What shall we call him.

Ripper, Lamont and Farmer appeared in both films. The opening scene was shot in a flooded gravel pit a couple of miles up the road from Bray Studios. On the other side of the road council workers were starting to build a motorway so Sharp had the crew lay smoke to obscure trucks in the background.Koetting p 10 According to Christopher Lee, Hammer Studios had built a full-sized galleon in some sand pits on a steel structure under the water. Although warned not to have too many people on board at once, one day the tea boat was lifted onto a platform level with the water and too many people rushed over to get a cup of tea. The ship capsized, throwing most of the cast and crew in the water. Lee was on the poop deck and luckily managed to hold on to the rail. No one was drowned or seriously hurt.Yoram Allon, et al (eds.)

In 1986, the band released their follow-up album, Enemigos de lo ajeno, with the track, \\"Insurrecci√≥n\\", being chosen as \\"Best Song of the Year\\" by Rock de Lux magazine. Enemigos de lo ajeno achieved the first Gold record, due to sales in excess of fifty thousand, for the band. 1987 saw the release of the group's third album, Nuevas mezclas ‚Äí recorded on a larger budget with improved sound quality ‚Äí followed by 1988's Como la cabeza al sombrero which sold more than 400,000 copies. The band began performing at larger and larger concert venues throughout Europe and South America, including the September 1988 Amnesty International Human Rights Now! concert in Barcelona, along with Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, and Youssou N'Dour. From 1988 to 1990, the group continued touring throughout Europe and the Americas including stops in Mexico, the United States, Colombia, Argentina, and Venezuela. =1990s= In 1990, the band released their fifth album, Nuevo peque√±o cat√°logo de seres y estares, which reached #1 on the AFYVE sales chart. The group also founded their own music company, Perro Records. After another extensive tour throughout Spain, Europe, and South America, the group issued its sixth album, Astronom√≠a razonable, in 1993 which became the first album by a Spanish group to stay at #1 on the AFYVE sales chart for 10 or more weeks. The disc also went gold in Venezuela and Mexico. The group promoted the album with a new international tour which included scenography designed by the Els Comediants theater group. In 1995, the band released their seventh and final album, La rebeli√≥n de los hombres rana, and again toured internationally in collaboration with Els Comediants. The concerts included tracks from the group's entire history including songs from the Los R√°pidos and Los Burros eras. =1998 breakup= On 13 January 1998, El √öltimo de la Fila announced their breakup so that the group's two founding members, Manolo Garc√≠a and Quimi Portet, would each separately pursue solo careers.

The algorithm has applications in elliptic curve cryptography where it is important to know the number of points to judge the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem in the group of points on an elliptic curve. The algorithm was published by Ren√© Schoof in 1985 and it was a theoretical breakthrough, as it was the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm for counting points on elliptic curves. Before Schoof's algorithm, approaches to counting points on elliptic curves such as the naive and baby-step giant-step algorithms were, for the most part, tedious and had an exponential running time. This article explains Schoof's approach, laying emphasis on the mathematical ideas underlying the structure of the algorithm. Introduction Let E be an elliptic curve defined over the finite field \\\\mathbb{F}_{q}, where q=p^n for p a prime and n an integer \\\\geq 1. Over a field of characteristic eq 2, 3 an elliptic curve can be given by a (short) Weierstrass equation : y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B with A,B\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_{q}. The set of points defined over \\\\mathbb{F}_{q} consists of the solutions (a,b)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}^2 satisfying the curve equation and a point at infinity O. Using the group law on elliptic curves restricted to this set one can see that this set E(\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}) forms an abelian group, with O acting as the zero element. In order to count points on an elliptic curve, we compute the cardinality of E(\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}). Schoof's approach to computing the cardinality \\\\\\\\# E(\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}) makes use of Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves along with the Chinese remainder theorem and division polynomials. Hasse's theorem Hasse's theorem states that if E/\\\\mathbb{F}_{q} is an elliptic curve over the finite field \\\\mathbb{F}_{q}, then \\\\\\\\# E(\\\\mathbb{F}_q) satisfies : \\\\mid q + 1 - \\\\\\\\# E(\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}) \\\\mid \\\\leq 2\\\\sqrt{q}. This powerful result, given by Hasse in 1934, simplifies our problem by narrowing down \\\\\\\\# E(\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}) to a finite (albeit large) set of possibilities. Defining t to be q + 1 - \\\\\\\\# E(\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}), and making use of this result, we now have that computing the value of t modulo N where N > 4\\\\sqrt{q}, is sufficient for determining t, and thus \\\\\\\\# E(\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}). While there is no efficient way to compute t \\\\pmod N directly for general N, it is possible to compute t \\\\pmod l for l a small prime, rather efficiently. We choose S=\\\\\\\\{l_1,l_2,...,l_r\\\\\\\\} to be a set of distinct primes such that \\\\prod l_i = N > 4\\\\sqrt{q}. Given t \\\\pmod {l_i} for all l_i\\\\in S, the Chinese remainder theorem allows us to compute t \\\\pmod N. In order to compute t \\\\pmod l for a prime l eq p, we make use of the theory of the Frobenius endomorphism \\\\phi and division polynomials. Note that considering primes l eq p is no loss since we can always pick a bigger prime to take its place to ensure the product is big enough. In any case Schoof's algorithm is most frequently used in addressing the case q=p since there are more efficient, so called p adic algorithms for small-characteristic fields. The Frobenius endomorphism Given the elliptic curve E defined over \\\\mathbb{F}_{q} we consider points on E over \\\\bar{\\\\mathbb{F}}_{q}, the algebraic closure of \\\\mathbb{F}_{q}; i.e. we allow points with coordinates in \\\\bar{\\\\mathbb{F}}_{q}. The Frobenius endomorphism of \\\\bar{\\\\mathbb{F}}_{q} over \\\\mathbb{F}_q extends to the elliptic curve by \\\\phi : (x, y) \\\\mapsto (x^{q}, y^{q}). This map is the identity on E(\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}) and one can extend it to the point at infinity O, making it a group morphism from E(\\\\bar{\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}}) to itself. The Frobenius endomorphism satisfies a quadratic polynomial which is linked to the cardinality of E(\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}) by the following theorem: Theorem: The Frobenius endomorphism given by \\\\phi satisfies the characteristic equation : \\\\phi ^2 - t\\\\phi + q = 0, where t = q + 1 - \\\\\\\\# E(\\\\mathbb{F}_q) Thus we have for all P=(x, y) \\\\in E that (x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}} ) + q(x, y) = t(x^{q}, y^{q}), where + denotes addition on the elliptic curve and q(x,y) and t(x^{q},y^{q}) denote scalar multiplication of (x,y) by q and of (x^{q},y^{q}) by t. One could try to symbolically compute these points (x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}), (x^{q}, y^{q}) and q(x, y) as functions in the coordinate ring \\\\mathbb{F}_{q}[x,y]/(y^{2}-x^{3}-Ax-B) of E and then search for a value of t which satisfies the equation. However, the degrees get very large and this approach is impractical. Schoof's idea was to carry out this computation restricted to points of order l for various small primes l. Fixing an odd prime l, we now move on to solving the problem of determining t_{l}, defined as t \\\\pmod l, for a given prime l eq 2, p. If a point (x, y) is in the l-torsion subgroup E[l]=\\\\\\\\{P\\\\in E(\\\\bar{\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}}) \\\\mid lP=O \\\\\\\\}, then qP = \\\\bar{q}P where \\\\bar{q} is the unique integer such that q \\\\equiv \\\\bar{q} \\\\pmod l and \\\\mid \\\\bar{q} \\\\mid< l/2. Note that \\\\phi(O) = O and that for any integer r we have r\\\\phi (P) = \\\\phi (rP). Thus \\\\phi (P) will have the same order as P. Thus for (x, y) belonging to E[l], we also have t(x^{q}, y^{q})= \\\\bar{t}(x^{q}, y^{q}) if t \\\\equiv \\\\bar{t} \\\\pmod l. Hence we have reduced our problem to solving the equation : (x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) + \\\\bar{q}(x, y) \\\\equiv \\\\bar{t}(x^{q}, y^{q}), where \\\\bar{t} and \\\\bar{q} have integer values in [-(l-1)/2,(l-1)/2]. Computation modulo primes The th division polynomial is such that its roots are precisely the coordinates of points of order . Thus, to restrict the computation of (x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) + \\\\bar{q}(x, y) to the -torsion points means computing these expressions as functions in the coordinate ring of and modulo the th division polynomial. I.e. we are working in \\\\mathbb{F}_{q}[x,y]/(y^{2}-x^{3}-Ax-B, \\\\psi_{l}). This means in particular that the degree of and defined via (X(x,y),Y(x,y)):=(x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) + \\\\bar{q}(x, y) is at most 1 in and at most (l^2-3)/2 in . The scalar multiplication \\\\bar{q}(x, y) can be done either by double-and-add methods or by using the \\\\bar{q}th division polynomial. The latter approach gives: : \\\\bar{q} (x,y) = (x_{\\\\bar{q}},y_{\\\\bar{q}}) = \\\\left( x - \\\\frac {\\\\psi_{\\\\bar{q}-1} \\\\psi_{\\\\bar{q}+1}}{\\\\psi^{2}_{\\\\bar{q}}}, \\\\frac{\\\\psi_{2\\\\bar{q}}}{2\\\\psi^{4}_{\\\\bar{q}}} \\\\right) where \\\\psi_{n} is the th division polynomial. Note that y_{\\\\bar{q}}/y is a function in only and denote it by \\\\theta(x). We must split the problem into two cases: the case in which (x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) eq \\\\pm \\\\bar{q}(x, y), and the case in which (x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) = \\\\pm \\\\bar{q}(x, y). Note that these equalities are checked modulo \\\\psi_l. =Case 1: (x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) eq \\\\pm \\\\bar{q}(x, y)= By using the addition formula for the group E(\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}) we obtain: : X(x,y) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{y^{q^{2}} - y_{\\\\bar{q}}}{x^{q^{2}} - x_{\\\\bar{q}}} \\\\right) ^{2} - x^{q^{2}} - x_{\\\\bar{q}}. Note that this computation fails in case the assumption of inequality was wrong. We are now able to use the -coordinate to narrow down the choice of \\\\bar{t} to two possibilities, namely the positive and negative case. Using the -coordinate one later determines which of the two cases holds. We first show that is a function in alone. Consider (y^{q^{2}} - y_{\\\\bar{q}})^{2}=y^{2}(y^{q^{2}-1}-y_{\\\\bar{q}}/y)^{2}. Since q^{2}-1 is even, by replacing y^{2} by x^3+Ax+B, we rewrite the expression as : (x^3+Ax+B)((x^3+Ax+B)^{\\\\frac{q^{2}-1}{2}}-\\\\theta(x)) and have that : X(x)\\\\equiv (x^3+Ax+B)((x^3+Ax+B)^{\\\\frac{q^{2}-1}{2}}-\\\\theta(x))\\\\bmod \\\\psi_l(x). Here, it seems not right, we throw away x^{q^{2}}-x_{\\\\bar{q}}? Now if X \\\\equiv x^{q} _ {\\\\bar{t}}\\\\bmod \\\\psi_l(x) for one \\\\bar{t}\\\\in [0,(l-1)/2] then \\\\bar{t} satisfies : \\\\phi ^{2}(P) \\\\mp \\\\bar{t} \\\\phi(P) + \\\\bar{q}P = O for all -torsion points . As mentioned earlier, using and y_{\\\\bar{t}}^{q} we are now able to determine which of the two values of \\\\bar{t} (\\\\bar{t} or -\\\\bar{t}) works. This gives the value of t\\\\equiv \\\\bar{t}\\\\pmod l. Schoof's algorithm stores the values of \\\\bar{t}\\\\pmod l in a variable t_l for each prime considered. =Case 2: (x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) = \\\\pm \\\\bar{q}(x, y)= We begin with the assumption that (x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) = \\\\bar{q}(x, y). Since is an odd prime it cannot be that \\\\bar{q}(x, y)=-\\\\bar{q}(x, y) and thus \\\\bar{t} eq 0. The characteristic equation yields that \\\\bar{t} \\\\phi(P) = 2\\\\bar{q} P. And consequently that \\\\bar{t}^{2}\\\\bar{q} \\\\equiv (2q)^{2} \\\\pmod l. This implies that is a square modulo . Let q \\\\equiv w^{2} \\\\pmod l. Compute w\\\\phi(x,y) in \\\\mathbb{F}_{q}[x,y]/(y^{2}-x^{3}-Ax-B, \\\\psi_{l}) and check whether \\\\bar{q}(x, y)=w\\\\phi(x,y). If so, t_{l} is \\\\pm 2w \\\\pmod l depending on the y-coordinate. If turns out not to be a square modulo or if the equation does not hold for any of and -w, our assumption that (x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) = +\\\\bar{q}(x, y) is false, thus (x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) = - \\\\bar{q}(x, y). The characteristic equation gives t_l=0. =Additional case l = 2= If you recall, our initial considerations omit the case of l = 2. Since we assume to be odd, q + 1 - t \\\\equiv t \\\\pmod 2 and in particular, t_{2} \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod 2 if and only if E(\\\\mathbb{F}_{q}) has an element of order 2. By definition of addition in the group, any element of order 2 must be of the form (x_{0}, 0). Thus t_{2} \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod 2 if and only if the polynomial x^{3} + Ax + B has a root in \\\\mathbb{F}_{q}, if and only if \\\\gcd(x^{q}-x, x^{3} + Ax + B) eq 1. The algorithm Input: 1\\\\. An elliptic curve E = y^{2}-x^{3}-Ax-B. 2\\\\. An integer for a finite field F_q with q=p^{b}, b \\\\ge 1. Output: The number of points of over F_q. Choose a set of odd primes not containing .

Output q+1-t. Complexity Most of the computation is taken by the evaluation of \\\\phi(P) and \\\\phi^{2}(P), for each prime l, that is computing x^q, y^q, x^{q^2}, y^{q^2} for each prime l. This involves exponentiation in the ring R = \\\\mathbb{F}_{q}[x, y]/ (y^2-x^3-Ax-B, \\\\psi_l) and requires O(\\\\log q) multiplications. Since the degree of \\\\psi_l is \\\\frac{l^2-1}{2}, each element in the ring is a polynomial of degree O(l^2). By the prime number theorem, there are around O(\\\\log q) primes of size O(\\\\log q), giving that l is O(\\\\log q) and we obtain that O(l^2) = O(\\\\log^2q). Thus each multiplication in the ring R requires O(\\\\log^4 q) multiplications in \\\\mathbb{F}_{q} which in turn requires O(\\\\log^2 q) bit operations. In total, the number of bit operations for each prime l is O(\\\\log^7 q). Given that this computation needs to be carried out for each of the O(\\\\log q) primes, the total complexity of Schoof's algorithm turns out to be O(\\\\log^8 q). Using fast polynomial and integer arithmetic reduces this to \\\\tilde{O}(\\\\log^5 q). Improvements to Schoof's algorithm In the 1990s, Noam Elkies, followed by A. O. L. Atkin, devised improvements to Schoof's basic algorithm by restricting the set of primes S = \\\\\\\\{l_1, \\\\ldots, l_s\\\\\\\\} considered before to primes of a certain kind. These came to be called Elkies primes and Atkin primes respectively. A prime l is called an Elkies prime if the characteristic equation: \\\\phi^2-t\\\\phi+ q = 0 splits over \\\\mathbb{F}_l, while an Atkin prime is a prime that is not an Elkies prime. Atkin showed how to combine information obtained from the Atkin primes with the information obtained from Elkies primes to produce an efficient algorithm, which came to be known as the Schoof‚ÄìElkies‚ÄìAtkin algorithm. The first problem to address is to determine whether a given prime is Elkies or Atkin. In order to do so, we make use of modular polynomials, which come from the study of modular forms and an interpretation of elliptic curves over the complex numbers as lattices. Once we have determined which case we are in, instead of using division polynomials, we are able to work with a polynomial that has lower degree than the corresponding division polynomial: O(l) rather than O(l^2). For efficient implementation, probabilistic root-finding algorithms are used, which makes this a Las Vegas algorithm rather than a deterministic algorithm. Under the heuristic assumption that approximately half of the primes up to an O(\\\\log q) bound are Elkies primes, this yields an algorithm that is more efficient than Schoof's, with an expected running time of O(\\\\log^6 q) using naive arithmetic, and \\\\tilde{O}(\\\\log^4 q) using fast arithmetic. Although this heuristic assumption is known to hold for most elliptic curves, it is not known to hold in every case, even under the GRH. Implementations Several algorithms were implemented in C++ by Mike Scott and are available with source code. The implementations are free (no terms, no conditions), and make use of the MIRACL library which is distributed under the AGPLv3. * Schoof's algorithm implementation for E(\\\\mathbb{F}_p) with prime p. * Schoof's algorithm implementation for E(\\\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}).

The original band members were the late Jose Roberto Bertrami (keyboards), plus Alex Malheiros (bass, guitars), and Ivan Conti (drums, percussion). History From 1979 to 1988, they released many albums for Milestone Records. They also had a major hit single with \\"Jazz Carnival\\", a product of their Light as a Feather album, in 1979. It peaked at number 19 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1980. Since the mid-1990s, they have released albums on the London based Far Out Recordings label, while remaining based in Brazil, and continue to tour in Europe. Azymuth have also been involved in producing albums and their artists have been involved in several other projects through the years, including an album by Brazilian singer-songwriter Ana Mazzotti, and the 2005 debut album, Equilibria, by Alex Malheiros's daughter Sabrina Malheiros. They call their music \\"Samba Doido\\", which means \\"Crazy Samba\\". Since the advent of the remix, many of Azymuth's songs have been redone by a wide range of artists and musicians. Several electronic acts like Jazzanova among many others, can be heard remixing their works. Solo careers Ivan \\"Mam√£o\\" Conti has released several solo records, including The Human Factor (Milestone, 1984). In 2008, Conti and hip hop musician Madlib released an album as \\"Jackson-Conti\\" titled Sujinho. Alex Malheiros has released Atlantic Forest (Milestone, 1985), Zenith (Niter√≥i Discos, 1992) and The Wave (Far Out, 2009). Bertrami had the largest solo career. His album Things Are Different (Far Out Recordings, 2001) featured Robertinho Silva among others. Bertrami died on July 8, 2012 at age 66. Other contributors Ariovaldo Contesini was the original fourth member and percussionist. He provided percussion during the recording session of the Azimuth EP and album in 1975. However, Contesini left the band shortly after completing the album. Jota Moraes is a keyboardist, who filled in for Bertrami after his departure from the group in 1988.

The class should not be confused with the older and more obscure A class of 1873. They were designed by the NZR's Chief Mechanical Engineer, A. L. Beattie and his Chief Draughtsman, G. A. Pearson to replace less powerful locomotives struggling with increasing loads on the South Island Main Trunk Railway, and in anticipation of the traffic volumes that would be created upon the completion of the North Island Main Trunk Railway. Origin and design The Baldwin Q had established the Pacific as the way forward for Express passenger locomotives, but the C.M.E decided that greater efficiency was needed. The new locomotives were therefore designed as compounds. The Vauclain system had proved ineffective in New Zealand so the type attributed to Frenchman Alfred de Glehn was adopted. The first four had Stephenson valve gear inside and Walschaerts valve gear outside, while the following 53 had just Walschaerts. The first eight locomotives were built at New Zealand Railways Department's Addington Workshops, the rest by A & G Price of Thames. The first twenty-seven were built with intercepting valves allowing full simple operation. This feature was later removed from all but the first four, and the last thirty were built without and classified as AD until 1915. Service and modifications Initially, fifty Price built engines were allocated to the North Island the rest to the South. The class were delivered with 1700 gallon tenders which were inadequate for work on the NIMT. To solve this, larger tenders were ordered for the BB class which were given A class tenders. Delivered with saturated boilers, one of the class was given a superheated boiler after two years. Cost meant the rest were converted only as their boilers wore out. From the thirties onward the class were fitted with pressed- steel smokebox doors for Waikato spark arrestors, although not always the arrestors themselves. Although competent engines the maintenance of the inner cylinders was difficult. In 1941 No. 582 was converted to a two-cylinder simple arrangement. The last was finished in 1949 and the class remained successful performers thereafter. Until the arrival of large numbers of the AB class, the A class were New Zealand's premier express engines. Starting in 1932 thirty-eight of the North Island engines went south. By this time they were being relegated to secondary and branch line service. Despite this, the last North Island engine was not withdrawn until 1961 and the last in the south until 1969, near the end of steam. The final A class to be withdrawn was A 428. Preservation Two class members have been preserved: *A 423 was saved by Kevin and Paul Jowett in 1970. In September 1970, the 'A' and BA 552 were used on a steam delivery trip between Palmerston North and Frankton, with the 'BA' leading for much of the journey. The 'A' was later put on static display at the defunct Waikato Railway Museum in Te Awamutu, which was the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Societys Waikato Branch. Between 21 and 22 April 2008, it was moved to the Glenbrook Vintage Railway and is now in storage. *A 428 was saved by the A 428 Preservation Society in 1973 after being stored at the roundhouse at Elmer Lane, Greymouth. It was towed from Greymouth to Christchurch by a single DJ class locomotive. Then it was towed from Christchurch to the Weka Pass Railway in Waipara with the Weka Pass Railway's recently purchased carriages. The train was hauled by another member of the DJ class and the Weka Pass Railway's two DG class locomotives on 10 December 1983. Restoration commenced in late 1988, and A 428 was recommissioned on 25 September 1993. A 409 The eighth locomotive built, A 409, was built in 1908 as a two-cylinder simple-expansion locomotive for comparative purposes against the four-cylinder compounds. Fitted with an ALCO superheater as a trial when built, it was marginally more powerful than the other A class locomotives as a result despite having only two cylinders. Despite its differences, it was classified for a time as AB 409 up until the 1930s along with the mechanically derived AB class locomotives. A 409 was withdrawn in October 1959 and was scrapped at Linwood locomotive depot as being largely non-standard.

Its origin can be traced back to the times of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Ingredients Classic zrazy have a rolled shape and are made of thin slices of beef, which is flavored with salt and pepper and stuffed with vegetables, mushrooms, eggs, and potato. However, there are numerous stuffing combinations as new ones are encouraged, such as pickles and bacon. The stuffed meat is then rolled and secured with thread or toothpicks. After being fried in oil for a short period of time, the zrazy are placed in a casserole with celery, onion, and various spices and covered with a hot stock. The casserole is then stewed at a low temperature. Prior to serving, the threads or toothpicks are removed; the zrazy is then drained and sometimes dusted with flour or topped with sour cream. Zrazy are eaten with the sauce in which they were stewed and are usually garnished with crumbled kasha, usually buckwheat and barley. In place of beef, zrazy can also be made with veal or pork. History It is unknown exactly when this dish was invented as well as which region of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth first produced it; both Poland and Lithuania claim to have created zrazy. The dish also became part of other Eastern European cuisines with different variations existing in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.

In Australian culture, a seachange (or sea change) is a form of human migration where individuals abandon city living for a perceived easier life in rural coastal communities. The term was popularised by ABC TV series SeaChange, which prompted city-dwellers to escape to the coast as depicted by the series. The term originally comes from Shakespeare's The Tempest. The result of this phenomenon was a rapid boom in tourism and real estate development in coastal areas, particularly in New South Wales. A similar term, treechange, describes the movement of urban people to the countryside. SeaChange TV series In television series SeaChange, which originally ran 1998 to 2000, the main character Laura Gibson fulfils her escapist desire by leaving the city for a small seaside town after her career and family life in Melbourne falls apart. The series was one of the most popular programmes in Australia. The primary filming location was Barwon Heads on the Bellarine Peninsula. Who is shifting People shifting to the coast have been characterised as: *Free agent migrators **Include retirees **Majority are of working age, drawn to service the needs of retirees and tourists **Sub categories include pre-retirees, alternative lifestylers and internet business operators *Forced relocating migrants **Principally people reliant on income support including unemployed, single parents and the disabled. Effect The rate of growth in rural coastal areas in 2008 was 60% higher than the national average. Almost six million people already resided in coastal areas outside the mainland capitals in 2008. In addition to people seeking a better lifestyle, the seachange phenomenon is driven by retiring baby boomers and people forced out of capital cities by high house prices.The Challenge of Seachange Growth In response to the influx of tourists and new residents to their jurisdictions, coastal councils from around Australia formed the National Sea Change Taskforce in 2004 to seek ways to ensure sustainable development in their communities. As at 2008 there are 68 member councils from around Australia collectively representing more than four million residents.

The Konyaks were the last among the Naga tribes to accept Christianity. In the past, they were infamous for attacking nearby villages, often resulting in killings and decapitation of the heads of opposing warriors. The decapitated heads were taken as trophies and usually hung in the 'baan' (a communal house). The number of hunted heads indicated the power of a warrior. The headhunting expeditions were often driven by certain beliefs, such as code of honour and principles of loyalty and sacrifice. The tribal members maintain a very disciplined community life with strict adherence to duties and responsibilities assigned to each of them.

Background and early career Born in Sussex, England, he worked for a time as a journalist before emigrating to the United States. In 1834, he arrived in Belleville, Upper Canada, where he established a Tory newspaper, named The Belleville Intelligencer. Orange Order activities He became a Captain in the local militia and a member of the Orange Order in later years. He helped finance the building of a plank road between Belleville and Camden. He served as warden for Hastings County from 1847 to 1862. Though he was Jewish, in 1836 he became grand master in British North America for the Orange Order, replacing Ogle Robert Gowan. At this time, the Orange Order had a strong voice in Upper Canada. Gowan's attempt to regain control of the Order in 1853 led to a split in the organization which was only healed in 1856 when both he and Benjamin withdrew from the leadership. Benjamin had many political enemies and was the subject of a harsh caricature in Susanna Moodie's 1843 short story \\"Richard Redpath\\". Elected to Parliament In an 1856 by- election, he was elected to represent North Hastings in the Legislative Assembly, becoming the first Jew elected to a Canadian parliament.

It is graded as Grade III historic building.List of Graded historic buildings in Hong Kong (As at 6 Jan) The police station is adjacent to former Sham Shui Po Camp and later Dragon Centre. History Shortly after the British executed the 99-year lease of the New Territory, a police station, also served as the Harbour Master‚Äôs Station, was built at Sham Shui Po. British established a base at Sham Shui Po with military camps and police stations as it overlooked the western side of the Victoria Harbour. The current Sham Shui Po Police Station building was completed in 1924 to replace the older station at the area. The building was built before World War II for a small population, before the rapid industrial and residential development of the area after the war. In addition, a large influx of immigrants from mainland China, settling in the area after the war, caused the district to become one of the worst squatter areas in Hong Kong. Therefore, the station underwent a series of additions and alterations to cater for its growing need for personnel and facilities. Sham Shui Po Station is still serving its community today even though its role changed from the station for the whole district to a sub-station in 1967.

The airship was named after the Soviet organisation OSOAVIAKhIM. V6 was the largest airship built in the Soviet Union and one of the most successful. In October 1937, it set a new world record for airship endurance of 130 hours 27 minutes under command of Ivan Pankow, beating the previous record by the German airship Graf Zeppelin. In February 1938, a Soviet Arctic expedition led by Ivan Papanin became stranded on the drifting ice pack. It was decided to send the V6 on a rescue mission, starting from Moscow with a short intermediate landing in Murmansk. During the flight, at approximately 19:30 on 6 February 1938, the airship crashed into the hillside near Kandalaksha, 220 km south of Murmansk. She caught fire and was destroyed. Of the 19 people on board, 13 perished. Their remains were laid to rest at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. In 1972, a memorial was erected at the crash site by local authorities and the citizens of Kandalaksha. There is also a memorial sign in Dolgoprudny, the then Soviet airship base. As was officially communicated by TASS, the crash was due to poor visibility and insufficient flight altitude. The conclusions of the government commission appointed to investigate the disaster were never made publicly available and remained classified for the decades. Among the circumstances resulted in the disaster there have long been rumored act of sabotage, outdated charts, and human error, but no evidences were ever presented. The recent researchBelokrys (2017). revealed that the airship flew off her route as the crew lost orientation in completely unfamiliar district because of darkness and snowfall. Supposedly, contributing to the disorientation were inefficient use of radio navigation equipment (Telefunken's and Fairchild's RC-3 radio direction finders), lack of general navigational experience, and human fatigue. Barometric altimeters could have accumulated error while the crew was unable to maintain constant visual control of the altitude. The accident was a severe blow to the Soviet airship program which was eventually terminated in 1940.

Description The snake's snout is slightly depressed, and not spatulated. It has relatively small eyes. The rostral scale is much broader than it is deep, and is visible from above the snake. The scales between the nostrils are much shorter than the prefrontal scales. The frontal scale is slightly longer than it is broad, approximately as long as the distance from the scale to the snout, and shorter than the panetal scales. The loreal scale is small, elongated, and not entering the eye. The snake has one preocular and two postocular scales, and between 2 and 3 temporal scales. It has eight upper labial scales, with the third, fourth, and fifth entering the eye; its five lower labials are in contact with the anterior chin shields, which are longer than the posterior. It has 17 rows of scales, with the scales in the seven middle rows possessing a slight keel. Its 214 ventral scales are angulated laterally; the anal scale is entire; its 83 subcaudals are in two rows. The snake is black above and on the sides, with narrow, whitish, transverse bands. The bands form complete rings on the tail, which is dark brown on its lower surface. The snake's belly is whitish, with a few brown spots towards the rear. It can grow to a length of three feet, of which the tail consists of eight inches. Etymology ' is Latin for \\"northern\\", from the phrase ', meaning \\"seven plough oxen\\", indicating the seven stars of Ursa Major or Ursa Minor. Distribution The White-banded Wolf snake is found in the North-east Indian regions of Darjeeling and Assam, in the Himalayan foothills and in the Khasi hills. It is also found across Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Chinese province of Yunnan. It is possibly found in Bhutan. Although records exist from Taiwan and Japan, these are likely to be incorrectly identified specimens of Lycodon ruhstrati. Reproduction The White-banded Wolf snake is Oviparous, or egg-laying.

In addition to its directories, Ausway also produces laminated, folded and rolled maps of varying sizes and formats, 200dpi digital map images, and index data. Ausway markets a satellite navigation unit loaded with their mapping data, branded as Navway. History Seeking a higher quality street directory for Melbourne, Merv Godfrey and Iven Mackay began drawing maps by hand for their proposed directory in 1961. Having produced road maps for petrol stations in the 1960s in his spare time, Godfrey took 12 months leave from his employer, the Government of Victoria's State Electricity Commission, to work on the directory. Godfrey resigned from his job, and worked with his wife to complete the publication. In a second-hand Morris Minor car, Mackay took the drawn maps and drove around checking each road and detail to confirm them. After five years of meticulous research and pen-and-ink drawing, their maps were ready for publication. The first edition of Melway was released in May 1966 with a $2.50 price tag. Being twice as expensive as its nearest rival, critics dismissed it as too expensive, however the directory's higher quality prevailed and it sold well, especially after receiving publicity from Graham Kennedy on the popular In Melbourne Tonight television variety show's \\"New Products\\" segment. The directory was embraced by local residents ‚Äì the word \\"Melways\\" quickly became a household name for \\"street directory\\". With continuing success, the company grew from Godfrey's private residence in Malvern, to an office location in Mount Waverley in 1985. In 1991, Melway Holdings changed its name to Ausway Publishing, and expanded into Sydney in 1993 with the launch of the Sydway directory, into Brisbane in 2005 with the Brisway, and into Perth in 2010 with the Melway Perth.

Behaviour A nocturnal snake which is very active and timid by nature. If cornered and provoked it will fiercely attack its challenger repeatedly. This snake has a tendency to enter human dwellings in search of prey. It is highly capable of climbing walls but has an equal tendency to fall off, often onto unsuspecting human occupants with catastrophic results. Feeds mainly on lizards but may consume frogs and other small fauna when the opportunity provides so. Very little known due to the paucity of specimens. It is assumed to be oviparous. Little known about its growth rate. The longest specimens seldom exceed 50 cm.

The anterior chin shields are as long as or a little longer than the posterior chin shields. The dorsal scales are in 23 to 27 rows at midbody, smooth, or feebly keeled on the posterior part of the body and on the tail. The ventrals number 220-265; the anal plate is entire; and the subcaudals number 75-94. The young are pale brown above, with black crossbands, each crossband enclosing four to six white ocelli. The adults are darker brown, with a transverse series of squarish black spots, or with more or less distinct traces of the color pattern of the young. There is a vertical black streak below the eye, and an oblique black streak behind the eye. Some specimens have a white, black-edged collar; others have two black longitudinal streaks on the head; and others are intermediate in this respect. The lower parts are yellowish, with or without a few small black spots, sometimes with a more or less distinct festooned marking on each side.Boulenger GA. (1890).

Habitat A terrestrial snake, C. helena lives in termite mounds, but also prefers low heights, old trees, wood piles, around old houses, dense vegetation, etc. Diet The trinket snake feeds on rodents, other small mammals, and lizards. Behaviour Diurnal and highly active, C. helena is noted for its temper and will strike repeatedly if molested. The males of this species are generally more aggressive than the females. Its bites are often very damaging due to its inward pointing teeth.

Background Before the Protestant Reformation a select group of performers generally sang the psalms during church services, not the entire congregation. John Calvin believed that the entire congregation should participate in praising God in the worship service and already in his famous work Institutes of the Christian Religion of 1536 he speaks of the importance of singing psalms. In the articles for the organization of the church and its worship in Geneva, dated January 16, 1537, Calvin writes: \\"it is a thing most expedient for the edification of the church to sing some psalms in the form of public prayers by which one prays to God or sings His praises so that the hearts of all may be roused and stimulated to make similar prayers and to render similar praises and thanks to God with a common love.\\" For this reason he wanted to create a songbook of hymns based on the psalms in the belief that in this form these biblical text would become more easily accessible to people. After being forced to leave Geneva in 1538, Calvin settled in Strasbourg, where he joined the Huguenot congregation and also led numerous worship services. It was in Strasbourg where he became familiar with the German versification of the psalms prepared by Martin Luther and others. Calvin shared these songs with his French congregation and also wrote some metrical versifications for them himself. Considering his own versions of the psalms not to be of sufficient quality, he turned to the French court poet Cl√©ment Marot, who had already versified most of the psalms in French during the first part of the sixteenth century. Editions =1539 edition= In 1539 the first edition of Calvin's psalter was published. It bore the title \\"Aulcuns Pseaulmes et cantiques mys en chant\\" (Some rhymed Psalms and Hymns to be sung)History of the Genevan Psalter - Dr. Pierre Pidoux, psalmen.wursten.be and contained 18 psalms and hymns set to music, including 12 versifications of Marot (1, 2, 3, 15, 32, 51, 103, 114, 115, 130, 137, 143), six psalms of Calvin (25, 36, 46, 91, 113, 138), the ten commandments, the Song of Simeon and the Apostles' Creed. Most of the melodies therein were familiar tunes used in the German church in Strasbourg (Strasburg) at that time. Some were apparently composed by Wolfgang Dachstein or Matthias Greiter. =1542 edition= In 1541 Calvin returned to Geneva, where he published a new psalter in 1542. Guillaume Franc, cantor and music teacher there, contributed numerous tunes for this edition including those for Psalms 6, 8, 19, 22, 24 (this tune was also used for Psalms 62, 95 and 111), and 38. The collection was titled \\"Les Pseaumes mis en rime francoise par Cl√©ment Marot et Th√©odore de B√©ze\\". =1543 edition= Cl√©ment Marot moved to Geneva in 1543, where he created rhymed versions of another 19 psalms and the Song of Simeon. Although Calvin wanted him to complete the job, he left the city and went to Turin, where he died in the fall of 1544. His work was continued by Theodore de Beza (Th√©odore de B√®ze). The 1543 edition bore the title \\"La Forme des Prieres et Chantz ecclesiastiques\\". There was an argument with the City Council concerning its publication because of the presence in it of a rhymed version of the Angelic Salutation. The melodies for the new psalms were composed by Guillaume Franc. =1551 edition= Containing 83 psalms, this psalter appeared under the title Pseaumes Octante Trois de David (Eighty-three Psalms of David). In addition to the 49 psalms translated by Marot, this edition features 34 psalms with the text translated by Beza. The new collection was published in Geneva by Jean Crispin in the fall of 1551.History of the Genevan Psalter - Dr. Pierre Pidoux, psalmen.wursten.beLouis Bourgeois (Composer), bach-cantatas.comOctante Trois Pseaumes de David - Jean Crispin, Geneva 1554, bnf.fr The supervising composer was Loys Bourgeois. It is not exactly clear how many of the melodies he actually composed, but it is generally assumed that most of the new additions were from his hand. This includes the first version of the hymn tune known as the \\"Old 100th\\", nowadays common as a setting for Psalm 100 (\\"All people that on earth do dwell\\") in this edition, however, this tune is associated with Psalm 134 (Ecce nunc benedicite Dominum).Octante Trois Pseaumes de David - Jean Crispin, Geneva 1554: Psalm 134 - Ecce nunc benedicite Dominum, bnf.fr =1562 edition= Finally in 1562 a complete psalter was issued with rhymed versions of all 150 psalms. Some of the earlier melodies were replaced. The last 40 melodies are ascribed to a certain Maistre Pierre, probably Pierre Davant√®s. Many of the lyrics were updated or replaced and all of them were written by Marot and De B√®ze. =Editions since 1587= In 1587, a light revision of the psalter was led by Theodore de Beza and Corneille Bonaventure Bertram. The next editions of the Genevan Psalter followed this revised version, which was considered as official. Worldwide use The Genevan melodies are still widely used in churches all over the world. In particular, the melody attributed to Loys Bourgeois known as The Old 100th or \\"Doxology\\" is found in numerous hymnals everywhere. Most of the other melodies from the Genevan Psalter are still used in Reformed churches in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Scotland, Canada, the United States, South Africa and Australia. The Reformed Churches of Brazil are also currently working on a translation of the psalms to be sung to the Genevan tunes. In The Netherlands, Jan Utenhove and Lukas d'Heere had translated psalms using the Genevan melodies. In 1565 Petrus Dathenus published a complete Dutch psalter using the melodies of the Genevan Psalter. Eventually this psalter became the official hymnbook in all the Reformed churches in the country. Without the support of a choir or organ (both forbidden) the precentor had to teach and intonate the songs. The quality of the community hymn singing soon began to deteriorate, and the Renaissance melodies were sung with 'whole notes' only, removing the original rhythm from the music. This practice gradually disappeared with the exception of some very conservative churches who still sing them this way today. In 1773 a new text version was introduced, and again in 1967. Many of the Reformed churches in North America were founded by the Dutch, who brought these Genevan melodies with them when they emigrated. Probably the only Christians in North America who still use the Genevan Psalter in its entirety are the Canadian Reformed Churches. They sing from their own Book of Praise, the Anglo-Genevan Psalter, containing English versifications for all the Genevan tunes. Dutch settlers in South Africa also founded Reformed churches where many of the Genevan melodies are still used today, especially with the Afrikaans versifications of the 20th-century poet Totius. A complete collection of the Genevan psalm melodies can be found in the German hymnals of the Evangelisch Reformierte Kirche, and some of them are also found in the hymnals of other Protestant churches in Germany. They are even to be found in some Roman Catholic hymnbooks in use in Germany. Historical significance The Genevan Psalter is predominantly used within the Calvinist churches. One result is that most of the singing in Calvinist churches is done in unison. Harmonies and instrumental renditions were exclusively used within the home or for concert performances. Hence the number of musical arrangements based on the Genevan Psalm melodies is far smaller than those based on the church music of other traditions. The most well known harmonies based on the Genevan psalter are the four-part choral renditions composed by Claude Goudimel. Less known are the compositions of Claude Le Jeune from the same era and the arrangements of Cl√©ment Janequin and Paschal de l'Estocart. The Dutch composer Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck wrote motets for four to eight voices for all the psalms, some of them through-composed including all verses, as well as a number of psalm variations for organ. Anthonie van Noordt, another Dutch composer, wrote organ works in a similar style based on these melodies. Orlando di Lasso together with his son Rodolpho composed three-part renditions of the psalms by Caspar Ulenberg, whose melodies were mostly based on the Genevan melodies. In North-Germany, Sweelinck's pupil Paul Siefert composed two volumes of psalm motets. The Polish composer Wojciech Bobowski, who later converted to Islam and took the name Ali Ufki, modified the first fourteen psalms to the Turkish tuning system, writing Turkish texts to fit the Genevan tunes. In Italy the Jewish composer Salamone Rossi wrote motets based on the Genevan melodies. Several psalms from the Genevan Psalter were translated to German, retaining the melodies, such as \\"Mein ganzes Herz erhebet dich\\", a paraphrase of Psalm 138 which was modified several times and became part of Lutheran, Protestant and Catholic hymnals. Thus a number of these melodies entered compositions of Johann Sebastian Bach and others. More recent composers inspired by the Genevan psalter are Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, Frank Martin and Arthur Honegger, amongst others. Not quite a dozen years after the publication of the Genevan Psalter in 1573, the Lobwasser Psalter was published by legal scholar Ambrosius Lobwasser and found its way into the public worship of the Reformed Churches in, e.g., Z√ºrich. The Lobwasser Psalter in turn served as the model for Czech and Hungarian versifications of the Genevan psalms. A Czech-language edition of the Genevan Psalms was prepared by Ji≈ô√≠ Strejc (also known as Georg Vetter, 1536-1599), who was born in the Moravian village of Z√°b≈ôeh and became a minister in the Unity of the Brethren, the ecclesiastical heirs of the ill-fated pre-reformer Jan Hus (c. 1369-1415). It was still being used as recently as the turn of the last century. In Hungary Albert Szenczi Moln√°r versified the psalms in the Hungarian language, and they are still sung today in the Reformed Church congregations in the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen, including Hungary and parts of Romania and Ukraine. The Reformed Church in Japan has completed a translation of all 150 psalms to be sung to the Genevan tunes, and this Japanese Genevan Psalmody has been recorded by members of the Bach Collegium Japan conducted by Masaaki Suzuki.'A Reformed Approach to Psalmody: The Legacy of the Genevan Psalter', Emily Brink, Calvin Institute of Christian Worship, 10 June 2005, retrieved 10 February 2018. Tunes Homorhythmic (i.e., hymn-style) arrangement of the tune \\"Old 124th\\", from the Genevan Psalter. In the complete edition of 1562 only 124 tunes were used for the 150 psalms. Of the tunes which are used repeatedly, 15 occur twice, four occur three times and one occurs four times, in the following combinations: * psalm 5 and 64 * psalm 14 and 53 * psalm 17, 63 and 70 * psalm 18 and 144 * psalm 24, 62, 95 and 111 * psalm 28 and 109 * psalm 30, 76 and 139 * psalm 31 and 71 * psalm 33 and 67 * psalm 36 and 68 * psalm 46 and 82 * psalm 51 and 69 * psalm 60 and 108 * psalm 65 and 72 * psalm 66, 98 and 118 * psalm 74 and 116 * psalm 77 and 86 * psalm 78 and 90 * psalm 100, 131 and 142 * psalm 117 and 127 Musical characteristics The Genevan melodies form a strikingly homogeneous collection. Besides the fact that the melodies were written over a relatively short time span by a small number of composers, they have a number of other characteristics in common. They are based on the so- called church modes; the melodic range is generally within one octave; the note values are restricted to half notes and quarter notes (with the exception of the final note); every melody starts with a half-note and ends on a breve (also known as a double whole note); regular meter and bar-lines are absent; and there are very few melismas (only Psalm 2, 6, 10, 13, 91, 138) Editions * Book of Praise, Anglo-Genevan Psalter, * Pierre Pidoux, Le Psautier Huguenot, VOL I * Pierre Pidoux, Le Psautier Huguenot, VOL II References External links * Geneefs Psalter YouTube Playlist of performances of works found in the Genevan Psalter.

It is regarded as one of the most influential films in Korean cinema history, as well as the first Korean nationalist film and a critique of the Japanese occupation of Korea. It is named after the traditional song \\"Arirang,\\" which audiences were said to sing at the conclusion of the film. Arirang is considered a lost film, but a written record of the plot still exists. Plot summary Yeong-jin is a student who has become mentally ill after being imprisoned and tortured by the Japanese for his involvement in the 1 March 1919 protest against the Japanese occupation of Korea. After his release, he returns home to live with his father and sister, Yeong-hui, in their village home. His old friend Hyeon-gu is now in love with Yeong-hui. While the villagers are preoccupied with a harvest festival, O Gi-ho, a collaborator with the Japanese police, attempts to rape Yeong-hui. Hyeon-gu fights Gi-ho, while Yeong-jin watches and has a vision of a couple in a desert begging a man for water. When the man in his imagination embraces the woman rather than offering her water, Yeong-jin stabs him with a sickle, actually killing Gi-ho. Yeong-jin regains his senses at this moment. The film ends with the Japanese police taking Yeong-jin back to prison, while the villagers weep. Cast * Na Woon-gyu(ÁæÖÈõ≤Â•é) as Yeong-jin(ÈáëÊ∞∏Èé≠) * Shin Il-seon(Áî≥‰∏Ä‰ªô) as Yeong-hui * Nam Gung-un(ÂçóÂÆÆÈõ≤) as Hyeon-gu * Ju In-gyu as O Gi-ho Impact = Initial reception = Arirang premiered at the Dansungsa cinema(then run by park seung pil) in Seoul on 1 October 1926, and quickly became a national sensation and a commercial success, screening at cinemas throughout the country. The film was a departure from the standard melodramas popular at the time because of its metaphorical resistance to Japanese occupation. It is considered to be Korea's first nationalist film. = Legacy = Arirang is considered to be the first masterpiece of Korean cinema and an inspiration to many Korean filmmakers of the era. Today, the location where Arirang was filmed in Donam-dong, Seoul, is known as Arirang Movie Street. The street is home to Na Woon-gyu Park, the Arirang Cine Center movie theater, and the Arirang Information Library. Gyeongi arirang, a variety of the song arirang is thought to be originated from the song Na Woon-gyu made for the film.https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0034277 = Sequels and remakes = Na Woon-gyu made two sequels to Arirang: a silent film called A Story of the Day after Arirang (1930) and a sound film called Arirang 3 (1936). Several directors have remade Arirang, including Lee Gang-chon in 1954, Kim So-dong in 1957, Yu Hyun-mok in 1968, and Lee Doo-yong in 2003. Lee Doo-yong's version was the first South Korean film to be publicly screened in North Korea. Lost status Along with almost all Korean films of this era, Na Woon-gyu's Arirang is considered to be a lost film. The original nine reels of the film are believed to have been lost during the Korean War. However, a copy of the film was rumored to be in the possession of Japanese collector, Yoshishige Abe, who died in February 2005. His collection of approximately 50,000 films reverted to the Japanese government after his death, but no news has yet come forth as to whether Arirang was found in the collection.

In the context of the parallel universe setting of the books, Chrestomanci also refers to the British government office that is responsible for supervising the use of magic and Chrestomanci Castle in southern England, which is both residence and headquarters. The word \\"Chrestomanci\\" may be derived from the Greek khrestos, meaning \\"useful\\", and -mancy, \\"divination\\". In turn -mancy is derived from Ancient Greek mante√≠a, \\"prophecy or divination\\". Jones gives the pronunciation \\"KREST‚ÄìOH‚ÄìMAN‚ÄìSEE\\" herselfMixed Magics (Greenwillow Books, 2001), preface. \\"You pronounce it KREST-OH-MAN-SEE.\\" and one of her characters writes the same instruction for using the word as a spell.Witch Week, chapter 11. \\"The old lady had written just one strange word three times at the top of the paper. Under that, as she had told them, she had written, in shaky capitals, how to say this word: KREST-OH-MAN-SEE.\\"  The Worlds  The label \\"The Worlds of Chrestomanci\\" on some late 20th century editionsBeginning with a matching set (Collins, May 2000) comprising the first edition of Mixed Magics and reissue of the four extant novels. alludes to their general setting, a multiverse called the \\"Related Worlds\\". The worlds have branched from common ancestors at important events in history such as English and French victories in the Battle of Agincourt, or the success or failure of the Gunpowder plot. Some people can move between worlds, at least in spirit, and twelve Series of similar worlds have been labelled in the English of the stories. It is common for people to have parallel selves in other worlds. The principal setting for the series is World 12A. World 12A is reminiscent of Britain during the Edwardian Era. There are known to be other worlds with British governments, probably all of series 12 and some others; even more worlds have an England in or near Europe. The Chrestomanci has representatives in some other worlds but does not know all other worlds. Indeed, Witch Week is set in a world even closer to ours, yet its existence is a surprise to Chrestomanci Christopher Chant and he cannot easily identify it.WW ch. 12 to opening pages of ch. 15. Especially: \\"I think there has been some kind of accident. You shouldn't get a civilized world where witches are burned. As I said, it ought not to exist. ... I urgently need a short history of witchcraft, in order to discover what kind of accident happened here. Was Elizabeth I a witch?\\" (ch. 13) = Magic = In World 12A, \\"magic is as common as music is with us\\", Jones explains.DWJ, untitled preface to Mixed Magics (Greenwillow Books, 2001; first US hardcover edition, opposite title page). That may be the norm. On the other hand, a world where almost everyone has detectable magic is rare or unique to the world of Witch Week. Ordinary English language of the series distinguishes \\"enchanters\\" from sorcerers from witches, etc., partly by the degree or greatness of their magic. As a class, enchanters have the most magic and are rare. They may have as many as nine lives; those with nine lives have the most magic and are few in number. Nine-lived enchanters known to the Chrestomanci are unique across all the Related Worlds: i.e., they have no alternate selves. One crucial sort of magic is the capability to travel between worlds, at least in spirit‚Äîat least, to travel with some knowledge and control. Whether spirit-travel in the Related Worlds explains some experiences of ordinary people is not directly addressed.  Books  There are seven Chrestomanci books: six novels and a collection of four stories subtitled Four Tales of Chrestomanci. The main setting for the series is Chrestomanci Castle in southern England, in an unspecified time, in a parallel world close to ours where \\"magic is as common as music is with us\\". Two of the novels are set during the childhood and during the adolescence of Christopher Chant. * The Lives of Christopher Chant (1988) * Conrad's Fate (2005) Christopher is mainly about 12 years old in the first, which was later issued with subtitle The Childhood of Chrestomanci. He is 15 years old in the second. The other four novels and all four tales are set during his tenure as Chrestomanci, and least 25 years pass between The Lives and Charmed Life. * Charmed Life (1977) * \\"Warlock at the Wheel\\" (1984 short story) * The Magicians of Caprona (1980) * \\"Stealer of Souls\\" (2000 novella) * \\"Carol Oneir's Hundredth Dream\\" (1986 novelette) * The Pinhoe Egg (2006) One novel and one tale cannot be placed in sequence. They are set in other worlds without overlapping characters except visits by Christopher Chant as Chrestomanci and evidently in the prime of life. * \\"The Sage of Theare\\" (1982 novelette) * Witch Week (1982 novel) Eric Chant appears briefly in \\"The Sage of Theare\\" as a boy or young adult from the household of Chrestomanci Christopher Chant.

The office of Chrestomanci  = Abilities = All Chrestomancis must have, or have had, nine lives. Merely calling out \\"Chrestomanci\\" will cause the current Chrestomanci to appear, whether he wants to or not, anywhere on his own world. It is implied in Witch Week that saying his name three times will summon him on any world. Once called, a Chrestomanci will attempt to solve any urgent magical dilemma, either out of obligation or natural inclination. As enchanters, Chrestomancis are among the strongest magic-users in their world. The two featured Chrestomanci in the series have serious magical weaknesses; whether this is a result of their magical strength or a coincidence is unknown. In Christopher Chant's case, this weakness is silver: he cannot work magic while silver is on his person or while being touched by silver; he is also unable to work magic directly on silver. Eric \\"Cat\\" Chant's weakness is the book of matches into which his sister Gwendolyn put his nine lives. The seat of office is Chrestomanci Castle, a fortress of magic staffed by civil servants and occupied by the current enchanter and his family. This castle can be used as both a government office and a private dwelling, as well as a school for Chrestomanci's children and wards. Most people find the atmosphere of the castle disconcerting, but Chrestomanci does not seem to notice. = Known Chrestomancis = Benjamin Allworthy is the earliest named Chrestomanci, followed by Gabriel de Witt and his successor, Christopher Chant. Gabriel de Witt appears in The Lives of Christopher Chant, Conrad's Fate, and Stealer of Souls. Christopher Chant became Chrestomanci after Gabriel retired. Christopher Chant appears in all of the books in the Chrestomanci series. He is the current occupant of the post. He takes great pains with his clothes, and is often found in either his impeccable dove-gray suit or one of many elaborately embroidered dressing gowns. He is often described as dreamy or vague, but these are also the times when he is most perceptive. He currently has two lives remaining, one of which is in the gold wedding ring worn by his wife, Millie. Eric \\"Cat\\" Chant appears in Charmed Life, Mixed Magics, and The Pinhoe Egg. He is in training to become the next Chrestomanci. He is a seemingly ordinary boy, with interests similar to most boys his age. Cat currently has three lives remaining, one of which is in a cat named Fiddle that his sister Gwendolen transformed from his violin early in their childhoods. Gwendolen also imprisoned Cat's lives into a matchbook, killing one of his lives in the process, and it is revealed near the end of Charmed Life that she was somehow using Cat's magic, and destroying three of his lost lives, to do her nefarious works. Cat's two other lives were lost when he nearly died in childbirth, and when he drowned during the Saucy Nancy Disaster ‚Äì the sinking of a leisure boat at the beginning of Charmed Life that killed Cat and Gwendolen's parents.

Sometimes the bottom combatant is said to be in half guard, while the top combatant is in a half mount. In wrestling and catch wrestling half mount is called Turk ride. The half guard is the position that is in between a full guard and side control or full mount. The combatant on top will try to untangle the leg and obtain side control or mount, while the bottom combatant will try to transition into a full guard or alternatively attempt a sweep or submission. The combatant on top is however in a better position, and can strike or attempt submission holds, although not as well as in side control. Variations The lockdown (known in judo as niju garami) is a variant of half guard where the defending practitioner further intertwines the legs to achieve a figure four. Using the more extended of their legs, the practitioner traps and drives the foot of the opponent upward; thereby attempting to limit the ability of the opponent to pass to full mount or side control. This position offers a slightly higher likelihood of executing successful sweeps, or reversals, while also offering limited submission options. Z guard - also known as the 93 guard is a position where the practitioner locks his feet together and clamps down on the opponents thigh while using their top leg knee to exert pressure into the opponents hip. The position is very effective due to the biomechanics involved. The more the top player is pressuring into the top leg the tighter they lock the guard onto themselves while exerting more energy than the bottom player. Z-guard has many defensive characteristics as well as many offensive. It is a solid foundation providing entries into \\"deep half\\" and or \\"half single\\" as well as traditional half guard techniques. The Z-guard is a must for any practitioner as it creates a strong barrier between you and your opponent with the top knee controlling that distance while there is a push pull effect happening with the bottom leg. Deep Half guard is when the practitioner uses half guard to get underneath the body of the opponent. Whilst underneath the opponents legs, this position is primarily used for sweeping as it has less submission options but can also be used to enter other positions such as the X-Guard.

It focuses on education and aims to introduce the larger goals of the RoboCup project (creating robots) to primary and secondary school aged children (technically up through age 19). Participants compete in one of three main leagues: Soccer, Rescue or Dance. Dance Theatre also exists as a sub-league of Dance, and Premier Rescue is part of the competition in Australia. History RoboCup Jr Soccer was invented and started back in 1998 with a demonstration held by Henrik Hautop Lund and Luigi Pagliarini at the RoboCup international competition held in Paris, France. In 1999, an interactive workshop and competition was held by Henrik Hautop Lund and Luigi Pagliarini at the RoboCup international competition in Stockholm, Sweden. The following year in 2000, the first international RoboCup Junior Educational competition was held in Melbourne, Australia. The format for RoboCup Junior was devised by a Melbourne committee of teachers and industry representatives. The first competition introduced the three level competition of Dance, Sumo(later to become Rescue) and Soccer. Then-prime minister of Australia, John Howard, was impressed in 2001 when he visited students competing in a RoboCup Junior Australia competition, congratulating both teachers and students for their accomplishments. Queen Elizabeth II was also impressed in 2002 on a trip to Australia, pointing out the complexity of what students were accomplishing. =International competitions= Each year, an international competition is run around the same time, and at the same location, as the RoboCup competition. The location changes each year, and in the past has seen events held at: * 2000 - Melbourne, Victoria, Australia * 2001 - Seattle, Washington, United States of America * 2002 - Fukuoka, Japan * 2003 - Padova, Italy * 2004 - Lisbon, Portugal * 2005 - Osaka, Japan * 2006 - Bremen, Germany * 2007 - Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America * 2008 - Suzhou, China. * 2009 - Graz, Austria. * 2010 - Singapore. * 2011 - Istanbul, Turkey. * 2012 - Mexico City, Mexico. * 2013 - Eindhoven, the Netherlands. * 2014 - Jo√£o Pessoa, Brazil. *2015 - Hefei, China *2016 - Leipzig, Germany *2017 - Nagoya, Japan *2018 - Montreal, Canada Besides the international competition there are national and regional competitions around the world. Often teams have to qualify at their local competition to be admitted to the world championship. For example, in Germany, where RoboCup Junior is very popular, teams start on one of several qualification tournaments with over 300 teams, before advancing to the German Open and finally, the World Championships.  Challenges  = Soccer challenge = Two teams each place two robots (which they have designed and created) on a playing field. The aim of the game is for each team of robots to play a fully autonomous game of soccer. The robots detect the infrared-emitting ball and use this as well as other specialised sensors, such as sonars, compasses and cameras to locate themselves and the opposition's goal. These robots must each be able to fit into a cylinder which is 220 mm in diameter and height.http://rcj.robocup.org/rcj2011/soccer_2011.pdf Originally, the soccer field had a grayscale plastic floor allowing the robots to locate themselves along the field.http://titan.bloomfield.edu/facstaff/eeguchi/rcj_nyc- nj/RCJ08_soccer.pdf In 2007, this was replaced with the GENII (Generation 2) field which had different shades of green plastic, which allowed light sensors to be used to more accurately determine location (this field is still used in Australia and is now also used in the World Robot Olympiad).http://robocupjunior.org.au/sites/default/files/RCJA%20GEN%20II%20%20Soccer%20Rules%202011%2021-04.pdf In 2009, the field was replaced with plain green felt.http://rcj.robocup.org/rcj2011/soccer_2011.pdf This change was aimed at making the game more realistic by creating greater reliance on the goal location and walls rather than the ground. The change, however, has been controversial with many teams having problems with quality of the felt. When RoboCup Junior was first formed, almost all teams used Lego Mindstorms construction kits to build their robots. In more recent years, especially at the World Championships, some teams have been using more advanced technology and designs in their robots. Custom printed circuit boards, actuator devices (for kicking), cameras and advanced micro controllers have become common place at the international competition. =Rescue Line  Maze challenge= Since inception, the rescue challenge has gone through a number of iterations, increasing in difficulty. A map of Australia was used to demo the rescue challenge initially (and was subsequently used in Australia for a number of years). Subsequently, this was changed to a number of white tiles with black lines marked on them, which the robot had to follow. Internationally, this was replaced with a set of \\"rooms\\" that the robot had to search and move through by following a line; then added with an evacuation room for \\"victims\\" (colored balls) recognition. In 2011, Maze was introduced as an additional sub-league. Maze is new competition without lines where the robot had to detect heat- emitting and visual \\"victims\\". In additional robot is required to drop a \\"rescue-kit\\" to identify the victims as well. =Premier Rescue challenge= Premier Rescue is practiced in the Australian RoboCup Junior competition. It is very similar to the Australian Rescue challenge except for some minor additions. The teams must capture the object within the marked area and place it on a platform. This is more difficult than the regular Australian Rescue challenge because the participants must construct a device to secure the object and lift it onto the platform. =OnStage challenge= Before 2015, it was divided into Dance and Dance Theatre Challenge. After 2014, it merged to have a single division called OnStage.  Dance challenge (before 2015)  A team creates both a robot and a dance composition. The aim of the competition is to create a two-minute dance performance choreographed to music; with particular attention going to construction and programming. Team members can join in to dance alongside the robot. A panel of judges decides the winner based on a number of different criteria. The dance competition is most popular amongst younger students, mostly of primary school ages. The robots range in size from 10 cm tall to 2/3 meters tall with intricate mechanical details. Dance Theatre challenge (before 2015) In Dance Theatre, teams build and program robots that act out a story-based song. For example, robots could be different characters featured in it. This section of RoboCup Junior is more difficult than Dance, as the robots must complete more specialised actions.

The 1602 publication, titled Der Psalter Dauids Gesangweis, was without melodies and meant to be sung to the tunes of other well-known Lutheran hymns. Sch√ºtz Heinrich Sch√ºtz welcomed the theological intentions of Becker's metrical versions of the psalms, and wrote four-part settings which he published in 1628 as Psalmen Davids: Hiebevorn in Teutzsche Reimen gebracht durch D.

It dictates that at low temperatures a structure or body shall deform or displace to a position that (locally) minimizes the total potential energy, with the lost potential energy being converted into kinetic energy (specifically heat). Some examples * A free proton and free electron will tend to combine to form the lowest energy state (the ground state) of a hydrogen atom, the most stable configuration. This is because that state's energy is 13.6 electron volts (eV) lower than when the two particles separated by an infinite distance. The dissipation in this system takes the form of spontaneous emission of electromagnetic radiation, which increases the entropy of the surroundings. * A rolling ball will end up stationary at the bottom of a hill, the point of minimum potential energy. The reason is that as it rolls downward under the influence of gravity, friction produced by its motion transfers energy in the form of heat of the surroundings with an attendant increase in entropy. * A protein folds into the state of lowest potential energy. In this case, the dissipation takes the form of vibration of atoms within or adjacent to the protein. Structural mechanics The total potential energy, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Pi} , is the sum of the elastic strain energy, U, stored in the deformed body and the potential energy, V, associated to the applied forces: Extract of page 59 : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Pi} = \\\\mathbf{U} + \\\\mathbf{V} \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(1)} This energy is at a stationary position when an infinitesimal variation from such position involves no change in energy: : \\\\delta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Pi} = \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{U} + \\\\mathbf{V}) = 0 \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(2)} The principle of minimum total potential energy may be derived as a special case of the virtual work principle for elastic systems subject to conservative forces. The equality between external and internal virtual work (due to virtual displacements) is: : \\\\int_{S_t} \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{u}^T \\\\mathbf{T} dS + \\\\int_{V} \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{u}^T \\\\mathbf{f} dV = \\\\int_{V}\\\\delta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}^T \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} dV \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(3)} where : \\\\mathbf{u} = vector of displacements : \\\\mathbf{T} = vector of distributed forces acting on the part S_t of the surface : \\\\mathbf{f} = vector of body forces In the special case of elastic bodies, the right-hand-side of (3) can be taken to be the change, \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{U} , of elastic strain energy U due to infinitesimal variations of real displacements. In addition, when the external forces are conservative forces, the left-hand- side of (3) can be seen as the change in the potential energy function V of the forces. The function V is defined as: Extract of page 244 : \\\\mathbf{V} = -\\\\int_{S_t} \\\\mathbf{u}^T \\\\mathbf{T} dS - \\\\int_{V} \\\\mathbf{u}^T \\\\mathbf{f} dV where the minus sign implies a loss of potential energy as the force is displaced in its direction. With these two subsidiary conditions, (3) becomes: : -\\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{V} = \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{U} This leads to (2) as desired. The variational form of (2) is often used as the basis for developing the finite element method in structural mechanics.

History In 1988, American emigrant Steve Leibowitz founded the American Touch Football in Israel (ATFI) league. The ATFI grew into a popular touch football league and in 2002, after thirteen years of touch football, renamed itself American Football in Israel and adopted flag football rules. In 2005, the Israel Football League, a previously pick-up American football league founded by Ofri Becker, merged with the AFI and began organized play with helmets, pads, referees and coaches with the AFI serving as governing body. The AFI has grown to five tackle and flag football leagues, including some 90 teams and over 1000 players. In each league, teams play in colored jerseys displaying the team sponsor. The Moshiko AFI men's contact league is six-on-six and played according to AFI rules. In 2008, Stevie's Boyz came back from a 21-0 deficit to upset Big Blue in the Holyland Bowl, the national flag football championship game. AFI operates a successful women's league, the WAFI, and the Israeli national women's team is regarded as one of the top teams in the world. The team took first place at Big Bowl III (2009) in Germany, and at the 2008 Flag Oceane tournament in Le Havre, France. In the fall of 2005, the co-ed non-contact league and boys' non-contact high school league used for the first time EFAF/NFL Flag Football Rules, which is five-on- five. In February 2006, American Football in Israel hosted an international flag football tournament at Kraft Family Stadium in Jerusalem. Known as \\"Flag in Jerusalem\\", the event marked the first time the State of Israel hosted a sanctioned international flag football competition. Six teams participated in the event including the Italian national team and Germany's Waldorf Wanderers, plus two American and two Israeli teams composed of some of the best talent the AFI had to offer.

She was born in Sydney. Saville, from an athletically-inclined family, competed in swimming and surf lifesaving events as well as walking as a junior athlete. She has competed at four Olympics, with a midfield result in 1996. In the 20 km racewalking event at the 2000 Summer Olympics in her home city of Sydney, when heading into the stadium's tunnel for the final stretch, Saville was disqualified for an illegal gait (lifting: a very common occurrence in race walking - the previous leader of the event had already been disqualified). Saville collapsed in tears; afterwards, when asked what she needed, she replied \\"A gun to shoot myself\\". Saville recovered her composure soon after and was publicly philosophical about her loss. On her bronze medal in Athens, Saville stated \\"Nothing will make up for a gold medal in your home town, but you know this is where the Olympics began and any medal here, you know, I'm absolutely ecstatic with it\\". Saville has also won three gold medals at the Commonwealth Games, in the 10 kilometre walk in 1998, in the 20 kilometre walk in 2002 and 2006. She has won the Australian women's race walking championship five times. She was the Australian flagbearer at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. She is coached by her husband, Matt White, a professional cyclist. She splits her time between Sydney and Oliva, Spain. Her sister, Natalie Saville, is also a race walker and finished second to her at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Saville announced her retirement from competitive racewalking in February 2009, with her future plans including continued work in community health and fitness promotion, and a role on the IAAF race walking technical committee. Saville has completed a Bachelor's degree in social sciences from the University of New South Wales. Both Jane and Natalie Saville live in the City of Randwick Local Government Area. Jane Saville was presented with the Keys to the City of Randwick on 22 October 2002 by Mayor Dominic Sullivan in recognition of outstanding achievement in sport.

CD38 also functions in cell adhesion, signal transduction and calcium signaling. In humans, the CD38 protein is encoded by the CD38 gene which is located on chromosome 4. CD38 is a paralog of CD157, which is also located on chromosome 4 (4p15) in humans.  Function  CD38 can function either as a receptor or as an enzyme. As a receptor, CD38 can attach to CD31 on the surface of T cells, thereby activating those cells to produce a variety of cytokines. CD38 is a multifunctional ectoenzyme that catalyzes the synthesis and hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD+ to ADP-ribose in addition to synthesis of NAADP from NADP+. These reaction products are essential for the regulation of intracellular Ca2+. CD38 occurs not only as an ectoezyme on cell outer surfaces, but also occurs on the inner surface of cell membranes, facing the cytosol performing the same enzymatic functions. Like CD38, CD157 is a member of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family of enzymes that catalyze the formation of cADPR from NAD+, although CD157 is a much weaker catalyst than CD38. The SARM1 enzyme also catalyzes the formation of cADPR from NAD+, but SARM1 elevates cADPR much more efficiently than CD38.  Clinical significance  The loss of CD38 function is associated with impaired immune responses, metabolic disturbances, and behavioral modifications including social amnesia possibly related to autism. CD31 on endothelial cells binds to the CD38 receptor on natural killer cells for those cells to attach to the endothelium. CD38 on leukocytes attaching to CD16 on endothelial cells allows for leukocyte binding to blood vessel walls, and the passage of leukocytes through blood vessel walls. The cytokine interferon gamma and the Gram negative bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide induce CD38 expression on macrophages. Interferon gamma strongly induces CD38 expression on monocytes. The cytokine tumor necrosis factor strongly induces CD38 on airway smooth muscle cells inducing cADPR-mediated Ca2+, thereby increasing dysfunctional contractility resulting in asthma. The CD38 protein is a marker of cell activation. It has been connected to HIV infection, leukemias, myelomas, solid tumors, type II diabetes mellitus and bone metabolism, as well as some genetically determined conditions. CD38 produces an enzyme which regulates the release of oxytocin within the central nervous system. Increased expression of CD38 is an unfavourable diagnostic marker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is associated with increased disease progression.  Clinical application  CD38 has been used as a prognostic marker in leukemia. Daratumumab (Darzalex) which targets CD38 has been used in treating multiple myeloma. The use of Daratumumab can interfere with pre-blood transfusion tests, as CD38 is weakly expressed on the surface of erythrocytes. Thus, a screening assay for irregular antibodies against red blood cell antigens or a direct immunoglobulin test can produce false-positive results. This can be sidelined by either pretreatment of the erythrocytes with dithiothreitol (DTT) or by using an anti-CD38 antibody neutralizing agent, e.g. DaraEx. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) are NAD+ precursors, but when NR or NMN are administered, CD38 can degrade these precursors before they can enter cells.<  Aging studies  A gradual increase in CD38 has been implicated in the decline of NAD+ with age. Treatment of old mice with a specific CD38 inhibitor, 78c, prevents age- related NAD+ decline. CD38 knockout mice have twice the levels of NAD+ and are resistant to age-associated NAD+ decline, with dramatically increased NAD+ levels in major organs (liver, muscle, brain, and heart). On the other hand, mice overexpressing CD38 exhibit reduced NAD+ and mitochondrial dysfuntion. Macrophages are believed to be primarily responsible for the age-related increase in CD38 expression and NAD+ decline. Macrophages accumulate in visceral fat and other tissues with age, leading to chronic inflammation. Secretions from senescent cells induce high levels of expression of CD38 on macrophages, which becomes the major cause of NAD+ depletion with age.

ISS was established in 1952 by Dutch universities and the Netherlands Ministry of Education. The institution is located in Netherlands, The Hague, also known as 'The World‚Äôs Legal Capital'. Between 300 and 400 students are enrolled in the ISS programmes, mostly in the Master and PhD programme in Development Studies. In addition to its teaching and research, ISS is active in the fields of advisory work and institutional capacity building projects. ISS alumni come from over 150 different countries. History Noordeinde Palace in The Hague, the Institutes first location. The current location of ISS in The Hague, Kortenaerkade. ISS was founded in 1952 by the Dutch government to assist in the training and further education of professionals, especially, but not only, from developing countries. This was one way in which the Netherlands sought to develop good relationships with intellectuals and policy makers in partner countries, including and beyond former Dutch colonies. Queen Juliana offered to house ISS in the Noordeinde Palace in The Hague in 1951. At first, ISS was perceived as a teaching institute, although by 1954 ISS was aiming to become research and teaching driven. Due to the role ISS played in creating the European Association of Development Institutes (EADI), and its focus on research and academic quality, the Institute received its formal rights to award the PhD in the 1970s. From 1993 onward, the ISS has been located in the former headquarters of the Netherlands Post and Telecommunications (the PTT) on the Kortenaerkade. In 2009 ISS became part of Erasmus University Rotterdam. The partnership was carefully negotiated, due to ISS wanting to remain fairly autonomous and to retain its mission. For many years, the main funding body for ISS Masters students was the Dutch government, through the NFP programme (now the OKP programme) administered by the Nuffic in cooperation with Dutch Embassies. ISS students have either OKP funding, another scholarship or private funding. Academic profile =Programmes and degrees= ISS provides education in the social sciences to postgraduate professionals, mostly from developing countries and countries in transition. The courses are all taught in English and cover a number of different fields, including development economics, migration, public policy, governance, gender, agriculture, food, population, social security, children and youth, and human rights.  Doctoral programme  The Institute offers a four-year Doctoral programme which leads to a degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies. PhD researchers are embedded into the research programmes at ISS, and are usually involved in one of four research groups: Civic Innovation, Development Economics, Political Ecology or Governance, Law and Social Justice. Currently there are about 125 enrolled PhD researchers and ISS has awarded over 150 PhD degrees since the programme was established. Within the Netherlands, ISS participates in the national doctoral research school CERES, and within Erasmus University in the Erasmus Graduate School of Social Sciences and the Humanities.  Master programmes  ISS offers a 15.5-month Master in Development Studies with various Majors and postgraduate diploma programmes; there is also a two-year joint Master degree in Public Policy which requires students to study at ISS or at the Central European University in the first academic year, and at the University of York or the Institute on International Relations in Barcelona (IBEI) in the second year. The ISS Master Degree in Development Studies is accredited by the Netherlands Flemish accreditation organisation NVAO and provides eligibility for entry to PhD programmes in the Netherlands and other countries. In 2010 the ISS Master programme received the 'internationalization as a distinctive quality feature' accreditation from the NVAO. ISS also offers various joint programmes with academic partners. In some programmes students take part of the programme elsewhere and part of the programme at ISS in The Hague. In other programmes ISS staff travel to the partner institute for contribute to teaching. Postgraduate diploma programmes are also offered catering to the needs of young and mid-career professionals who wish to deepen their knowledge in a particular field related to their research or occupation. All degrees are recognized internationally and by Dutch legislation on higher education. = Research and publications = ISS research is clustered in the research programme Global Development and Social Justice. Much of the research carried out in the Institute is available through publications online, either as journal articles or in the ISS Working Papers. The ISS Working Paper series consists mainly of work in progress; the best, award-winning dissertations by Masters students are also published in this way. As well as seminars by staff and PhD participants, visiting researchers and invited experts come to speak at ISS on a regular basis. The wider diplomatic and academic community is often invited to major debates and other events. =Library= ISS has a specialised library available for the use of ISS staff and students and for visitors.

Glest is set in a medieval fantasy world with two factions, and was compared with Warcraft III and the Empire Earth series. The game received positive to mixed reviews from the press, has been downloaded over two million times, and spawned several derivative continuation projects which are under active development. Development The game was started by a team based in Spain around 2004. Release of version 3.0 added online multiplayer LAN/Internet support. Glest is designed to be moddable, with game elements defined by editable XML files, and includes a map editor. Since April 2009, development on the original game has ceased. However, two forks, MegaGlest and the Glest Advanced Engine (GAE) have continued developing the game and its engine further. While MegaGlest is focused on stable releases which provide reliable cross platform multi-player games and deliver new game content out of the box, GAE is primarily oriented towards improving the game engine and providing more options for full conversions, and is more experimental in nature. In 2011 it was suggested that the two forks should merge but due to different philosophies and goals amongst the developers of both forks this effort was called off during the planning stage. Gameplay Glest is set in a medieval fantasy world with two factions, named Magic and Tech, each with their own set of units, buildings and upgrades. The Tech faction uses traditional human warriors and has medieval mechanical devices in its arsenal, and are strong in melee combat. The Magic faction is designed for advanced players with most of their units morphed from or summoned by others. It lacks the hand-to-hand combat strength of the Tech faction but features more versatile units. Tilesets and maps are selected at the new game setup menu and determine the graphical nature of the Glest game world. Because of the moddability of the engine, Glest can play games from a variety of player-created mods. These range from futuristic science fiction themes to dark, high fantasy settings. Reception *Acid Play: Rating: 9.2 \\"A totally awesome 3D strategy game based in the magic forests during medieval times.\\" *CNET Download.com gave Glest v3.1 5 Stars (User Rating 4 out of 5 stars) and compared it to Warcraft III and the Empire Earth series in 2009: *happypenguin.org: Rating: 4.48 out of 5 stars *Casualty gamer: In October 2008 reviewed version 3.1.2. *About.com: Reviewed the game and highlighted the detailed 3D graphics in Glest, but criticized the underdeveloped gameplay and small number of maps in that version.

Use  Knee-on- stomach is an advantageous position, where the top combatant can effectively strike similarly to in the mounted position, and also transition into various holds or other positions, and also easily disengage and escape if needed. It is not however considered as stable as the mount, which on the other hand complements the knee-on-stomach well, since it is possible to easily transition from one to another in response to escape or sweep attempts by the opponent. A common submission hold applied from this position is the juji- gatame armbar, which can be performed if the opponent extends his or her hands in an attempt to push the top combatant off. The top combatant can sometimes submit the bottom combatant from this position by simply using his or her weight to compress the torso, hence causing pain and compressive asphyxia.

Sentimentalism, which is to be distinguished from sensibility, was a fashion in both poetry and prose fiction beginning in the eighteenth century in reaction to the rationalism of the Augustan Age. Sentimental novels relied on emotional response, both from their readers and characters. They feature scenes of distress and tenderness, and the plot is arranged to advance both emotions and actions. The result is a valorization of \\"fine feeling\\", displaying the characters as a model for refined, sensitive emotional effect. The ability to display feelings was thought to show character and experience, and to shape social life and relations.Richard Maxwell and Katie Trumpener, eds., The Cambridge Companion to Fiction in the Romantic Period (2008). History Among the most famous sentimental novels in English are Samuel Richardson's Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (1740), Oliver Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield (1766), Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy (1759‚Äì67), Sentimental Journey (1768), Henry Brooke's The Fool of Quality (1765‚Äì70), Henry Mackenzie's The Man of Feeling (1771) and Maria Edgeworth's Castle Rackrent (1800). Continental examples are Jean-Jacques Rousseau's novel Julie, or the New Heloise, his autobiography The Confessions (1764‚Äì70) and Goethe's novel The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774).J. A. Cuddon, The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory, 4th edition (London: Penguin Books, 1999), p.809; M. H. Abrams, A Glossary of Literary Terms, 7th edition (Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace,1999), p.283. Tobias Smollett tried to imply a darker underside to the \\"cult of sensibility\\" in his The Expedition of Humphry Clinker (1771). Another example of this type of novel is Frances Burney's Evelina (1778), wherein the heroine, while naturally good, in part for being country-raised, hones her politeness when, while visiting London, she is educated into propriety. This novel also is the beginning of \\"romantic comedy\\", though it is most appropriately labeled a conduct novel and a forerunner of the female Bildungsroman in the English tradition exemplified by later writers such as Jane Austen, Charlotte Bront√´, and George Eliot.Laura Sue Fuderer, The Female Bildungsroman in English: An Annotated Bibliography of Criticism (1990) While this genre is particularly associated with the second half of the 18th century, it continued in a modified form into the 19th century, especially in the works of Mrs Henry Wood, who is remembered especially for East Lynne (1861).\\"novel.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 19 Jan. 2013. However, the question as to whether Charles Dickens is a sentimental novelist is more debatable. Valerie Purton in her recent Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition, sees him continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his \\"sentimental scenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes\\", and that \\"Dombey and Son is ... Dickens's greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition\\".London: Anthem Press, 2012, p.xiii, p.123. on the other hand, the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online comments, that despite \\"patches of emotional excess\\", such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol (1843), \\"Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist\\". The first sentimental novel to be published in the United States, William Hill Brown's The Power of Sympathy, appeared in 1791 and dealt with themes of nationhood, seduction, and incest. Hill's novel was followed by Hannah Webster Foster's immensely popular The Coquette, whose events were loosely based on the tragic biography of Massachusetts native Elizabeth Whitman, who gave birth to an illegitimate child and died soon after at a roadside tavern. The American sentimental novel achieved massive sales and popularity during the Antebellum era. Landmark examples include Susan Warner's The Wide, Wide World (1850), Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), and Maria Cummins's The Lamplighter (1854).Tompkins, Jane. Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction, 1790-1860. New York: Oxford University Press, 1986. Sentimental novels also gave rise to the subgenre of domestic fiction in the early nineteenth century, commonly called conduct novels. The story's hero in domestic fiction is generally set in a domestic world and centers on a woman going through various types of hardship, and who is juxtaposed with either a foolish and passive or a woefully undereducated woman.University of Minnesota - Duluth http://www.d.umn.edu/~csigler/domestic_fiction.html The contrast between the heroic woman's actions and her foils is meant to draw sympathy to the character's plight and to instruct them about expected conduct of women. The domestic novel uses sentimentalism as a tool to convince readers of the importance of its message.Shirley Samuels, ed., The Culture of Sentiment, (1992). By the end of the 19th century, sentimental literature faced complaints about the abundance of \\"cheap sentiment\\" and its excessive bodily display. Critics, and eventually the public, began to see sentimentalism manifested in society as unhealthy physical symptoms such as nervousness and being overly sensitive, and the genre began declining sharply in popularity. The satirizing of sentimentalism The novelist Henry Fielding, known later for his novel The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, satirized the sentimental style in his early novels Shamela and Joseph Andrews. Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility is most often seen as a \\"witty satire of the sentimental novel\\",http://www.broadviewpress.com/bvbooks.asp?BookID=235 by juxtaposing values of the Age of Enlightenment (sense, reason) with those of the later eighteenth century (sensibility, feeling) while exploring the larger realities of women's lives, especially through concerns with marriage and inheritance. This reading of Sense and Sensibility specifically and Austen's fiction in general has been complicated and revised by recent critics such as Claudia L. Johnson (Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel [1988] and Equivocal Beings: Politics, Gender, and Sentimentality in the 1790s [1995]), Jillian Heydt-Stevenson (Austen's Unbecoming Conjunctions [2005], and Christopher C. Nagle (Sexuality and the Culture of Sensibility in the British Romantic Era [2007]), all of whom see unruly and even subversive energies at play in her work, inspired by the sentimental tradition. James Joyce parodies the sentimental novel in the \\"Nausicaa\\" episode of Ulysses. The character of Gerty MacDowell was inspired by the protagonist of The Lamplighter, a nineteenth century best-seller. Cultural aspects The sentimental novel complemented social trends of the time toward humanism and the heightened value of human life. The literature focused on weaker members of society, such as orphans and condemned criminals, and allowed readers to identify and sympathize with them. This translated to growing sentimentalism within society, and led to social movements calling for change, such as the abolition of the death penalty and of slavery. Instead of the death penalty, popular sentiment called for the rehabilitation of criminals, rather than harsh punishment.Paul Christian Jones, \\"'I put my fingers around my throat and squeezed it, to know how it feels': Antigallows Sentimentalism and E. D. E. N. Southworth‚Äôs The Hidden Hand,\\" Legacy, Vol. 25, no. 1, 2008. pp. 41‚Äì61. Frederick Douglass himself was inspired to stand against his own bondage and slavery in general in his famous Narrative by the speech by the sentimentalist playwright Sheridan in The Columbian Orator detailing a fictional dialogue between a master and slave. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 1774 The Sorrows of Young Werther was highly sentimental and immediately extremely popular throughout Europe, and even inspired young people who could relate to Werther's sorrows to commit suicide.Tobin Siebers, ‚ÄúThe Werther Effect: The Esthetics of Suicide,‚Äù Mosaic (Winnipeg), Vol. 26, 1993. It is also an excellent example of an epistolary novel, an especially typical form for eighteenth-century novels of sensibility, beginning with the influential novels of Samuel Richardson, Pamela (1740), Clarissa (1748), and The History of Sir Charles Grandison (1753). The latter was an especially important influence on Jane Austen, who refers to it repeatedly in her letters and began a dramatic adaptation of the work for the amusement of her family.  Gothic novel  The Gothic novel's story occurs in a distant time and place, often Medieval or Renaissance Europe (especially Italy and Spain), and involved the fantastic exploits of a virtuous heroine imperiled by dark, tyrannical forces beyond her control. The first Gothic novel is Horace Walpole‚Äôs The Castle of Otranto (1764), but its most famous and popular practitioner was Ann Radcliffe. As in other Gothic novels, the notion of the sublime is central. Eighteenth-century aesthetic theory, following Edmund Burke, held that the sublime and the beautiful were juxtaposed. The sublime was awful (awe-inspiring) and terrifying while the beautiful was calm and reassuring. The characters and landscapes of the Gothic rest almost entirely within the sublime, with the heroine serving as the great exception. The ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù heroine‚Äôs susceptibility to supernatural elements, integral to these novels, both celebrates and problematizes what came to be seen as hyper-sensibility. =Relation to the Gothic novel= Gothic and sentimental novels are considered a form of popular fiction, reaching their height of popularity in the late 18th century. They reflected a popular shift from Neoclassical ideas of order and reason to emotion and imagination.Robert Hume, \\"Gothic versus Romantic: A Revaluation of the Gothic Novel,\\" PMLA, Vol. 84, No. 2 (Mar. 1969), pp. 282-290. Popular stylistic elements, such as the \\"discovery\\" of the original manuscript by the author (as in Walpole's The Castle of Otranto) or creating fragmented works by combining disjointed tales (seen in Sterne's A Sentimental Journey) were meant to suggest to the reader that there was no act of artistic creation to distort reality between the reader and the work, or that the emotional intensity and sincerity remained intact.Leo Braudy, \\"The Form of the Sentimental Novel,\\" Novel: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 7, No. 1 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 5-13.

Traditionally it has been a male-bonding experience, especially in Orthodox communities. Custom Kiddush clubs are a fixture of Saturday morning shacharit services in Orthodox, and particularly Modern Orthodox synagogues. In a typical kiddush club, members of the \\"club\\"‚Äìgenerally men‚Äìleave the synagogue's prayer hall during either the Torah reading, the haftarah reading or the rabbi's sermon which generally follows it, and go to another room in the synagogue to drink and socialize. Depending on the club, participants may or may not return to the prayer hall for mussaf, the remaining portion of the prayer service. Kiddush clubs vary in offerings, although hard alcohol and wine are typical. More extravagant kiddush clubs may include various appetizers similar to a regular kiddush, such as pickles, whitefish spread, or pickled herring. Kiddush clubs may also sometimes raise money for the synagogue or other charities through membership fees of \\"bottle sponsorships\\". Some kiddush clubs congregate in members' homes after services have concluded to avoid disrupting services. Additionally, some synagogues refer to regular kiddush other social activities hosted by the synagogue as \\"kiddush clubs\\". History There is evidence that practices similar to modern kiddush clubs have been present in Jewish communities for hundreds of years. A 16th century text, Sefer Yefeh Nof includes a responsa from Rabbi Moshe Yitzhak M‚Äôzia opining that leaving the synagogue to drink whisky during the Torah service is permissible as long as the participants do not eat a full meal. Criticism Kiddush clubs have been met with criticism, particularly in the United States. In December 2004, the Orthodox Union (OU) called for the elimination of such practices. OU Executive Vice President Rabbi Dr. Tzvi Hersh Weinreb criticized \\"Kiddush Clubs\\" for detracting from the honor of the synagogue, promoting gossip, reducing decorum, and enabling substance abuse. Some synagogues have tried banning the clubs, but this is often unsuccessful as club members are often influential congregants of the synagogue.

The receiver of EPL-licensed programs can use, modify, copy and distribute the work and modified versions, in some cases being obligated to release their own changes. The EPL is listed as a free software license by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). Discussion of a new version of the EPL began in May 2013. Version2.0 was announced on 24August 2017. Compatibility The EPL 1.0 is not compatible with the GPL, and a work created by combining a work licensed under the GPL with a work licensed under the EPL cannot be lawfully distributed. The GPL requires that \\"[any distributed work] that ... contains or is derived from the [GPL-licensed] Program ... be licensed as a whole ... under the terms of [the GPL]\\", and that the distributor not \\"impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\\". The EPL, however, requires that anyone distributing the work grant every recipient a license to any patents that they might hold that cover the modifications they have made. Because this is a \\"further restriction\\" on the recipients, distribution of such a combined work does not satisfy the GPL. The EPL, in addition, does not contain a patent retaliation clause. Derivative works According to article 1(b) of the EPL, additions to the original work may be licensed independently, including under a proprietary license, provided such additions are \\"separate modules of software\\" and do not constitute a derivative work.

The FSF has analyzed the license in relation to GPL license compatibility and added it to their official list. The bare license notice is available in several formats, including plain text. In terms of GPL compatibility, the new license allows the initial contributor to a new project to opt in to a secondary license that provides explicit compatibility with the GNU General Public License version 2.0, or any later version. If this optional designation is absent, then the Eclipse license remains source incompatible with the GPL (any version). Other changes include: * the license now applies to \\"files\\" not \\"modules\\" * the new license is international because the choice of law provision has been removed * the new license is suitable for scripting languages, including JavaScript The Eclipse Foundation advises that version1.0 is deprecated and that projects should migrate to version2.0. Relicensing is a straightforward matter and does not require the consent of all contributors, past and present.

Similar in concept to early variant of the German Panzer IV, it was designed as a self-propelled howitzer to provide the close-in fire support for standard Japanese medium tanks with additional firepower against enemy anti-tank fortifications.History of War: Type 2 Ho-I Gun Tank History and development Experimental Type 1 gun tank Ho-I, 1941 Design work on the Type 2 Ho-I began in 1937, after experience in Manchukuo taught Japanese war planners that an armored vehicle with a larger weapon would be useful against fortified enemy positions such as pillboxes, against which the standard low-velocity 57mm and high-velocity 47mm tank guns were ineffective. Since this vehicle was to be able to keep up with the rest of an armored formation, the Japanese began work on mounting a Type 41 75 mm Mountain Gun onto the chassis of the Chi-Ha medium tank. The adapted mountain gun, known as the Type 99 75 mm Tank Gun, was completed in 1940. The gun could fire an assortment of ammunition, including a 6.6kg (14.5lb) armor-piercing shell and had a muzzle velocity of 445mps. By 1942 the Type 99 75 mm gun was fitted into a Type 97-Kai Shinhoto Chi-Ha turret, which resulted in the designated Type 2 Ho-I gun tank. The Type 2 Ho-I gun tank was intended to be part of a fire support company in each of the tank regiments. Design Experimental Type 1 gun tank Ho-I, side view Type 2 gun tank Ho-I, side view The 1941 prototype model, known as the Experimental Type 1 Ho-I, used the Type 97 Chi-Ha chassis.Taki‚Äôs Imperial Japanese Army: Type 2 \\"Ho-I\\" The production model utilized the chassis of the Type 1 Chi-He, which was itself a modified Type 97 Chi-Ha hull. The main armament of the Type 2 Ho-I was a Type 99 75 mm tank gun, and secondary armament was a single 7.7 mm Type 97 Light Machine Gun in the hull. The short barreled 75 mm Type 99 Gun was mounted in a fully rotating enlarged three-man gun turret used for the Type 97 Shinhoto Chi-Ha tank. Service history Production was hampered by material shortages, and by the bombing of Japan in World War II. All 31 Type 2 Ho-I tanks were conversions from existing Type 1 Chi He medium tanks. The Tokyo factory of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was unable to retool for mass production by the end of 1944, when the program was cancelled. These units were allocated to the Japanese home islands to defend against the projected Allied Invasion. As the cessation occurred before that invasion, the Type 2 Ho-I never saw combat.

The simple principle of polarography is the study of solutions or of electrode processes by means of electrolysis with two electrodes, one polarizable and one unpolarizable, the former formed by mercury regularly dropping from a capillary tube. Polarography is a specific type of measurement that falls into the general category of linear-sweep voltammetry where the electrode potential is altered in a linear fashion from the initial potential to the final potential. As a linear sweep method controlled by convection/diffusion mass transport, the current vs. potential response of a polarographic experiment has the typical sigmoidal shape. What makes polarography different from other linear sweep voltammetry measurements is that polarography makes use of the dropping mercury electrode (DME) or the static mercury drop electrode. A plot of the current vs. potential in a polarography experiment shows the current oscillations corresponding to the drops of Hg falling from the capillary. If one connected the maximum current of each drop, a sigmoidal shape would result. The limiting current (the plateau on the sigmoid), called the diffusion current because diffusion is the principal contribution to the flux of electroactive material at this point of the Hg drop life. Limitations Heyrovsk√Ω's Polarograph and DME There are limitations in particular for the classical polarography experiment for quantitative analytical measurements. Because the current is continuously measured during the growth of the Hg drop, there is a substantial contribution from capacitive current. As the Hg flows from the capillary end, there is initially a large increase in the surface area. As a consequence, the initial current is dominated by capacitive effects as charging of the rapidly increasing interface occurs. Toward the end of the drop life, there is little change in the surface area which diminishes the contribution of capacitance changes to the total current. At the same time, any redox process which occurs will result in faradaic current that decays approximately as the square root of time (due to the increasing dimensions of the Nernst diffusion layer). The exponential decay of the capacitive current is much more rapid than the decay of the faradaic current; hence, the faradaic current is proportionally larger at the end of the drop life. Unfortunately, this process is complicated by the continuously changing potential that is applied to the working electrode (the Hg drop) throughout the experiment. Because the potential is changing during the drop lifetime (assuming typical experimental parameters of a 2 mV/s scan rate and a 4 s drop time, the potential can change by 8 mV from the beginning to the end of the drop), the charging of the interface (capacitive current) has a continuous contribution to the total current, even at the end of the drop when the surface area is not rapidly changing. As such, the typical signal to noise of a polarographic experiment allows detection limits of only approximately 10‚àí5 or 10‚àí6 M. Improvements Dramatically better discrimination against the capacitive current can be obtained using the tast and pulse polarographic techniques. These have been developed with introduction of analog and digital electronic potentiostats. A first major improvement is obtained, if the current is only measured at the end of each drop lifetime (tast polarography. An even greater enhancement has been the introduction of differential pulse polarography. Here, the current is measured before the beginning and before the end of short potential pulses. The latter are superimposed to the linear potential-time-function of the voltammetric scan. Typical amplitudes of these pulses range between 10 and 50 mV, whereas pulse duration is 20 to 50 ms. The difference between both current values is that taken as the analytical signal. This technique results in a 100 to 1000-fold improvement of the detection limit, because the capacitive component is effectively suppressed. Qualitative information Qualitative information can also be determined from the half-wave potential of the polarogram (the current vs. potential plot in a polarographic experiment). The value of the half-wave potential is related to the standard potential for the redox reaction being studied. This technique and especially the differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) method can be used for environmental analysis, and especially for marine study for characterisation of organic matter and metals interactions. Quantitative information The Ilkovic equation is a relation used in polarography relating the diffusion current (Id) and the concentration of the depolarizer (c), which is the substance reduced or oxidized at the dropping mercury electrode. The Ilkovic equation has the form : I_\\\\text{d} = knFD^{1/2} m_r^{2/3} t^{1/2} c, :or :id = 607 n D1/2 C m2/3 t1/2 where k is a constant which includes œÄ and the density of mercury, and with the Faraday constant F has been evaluated at 708 for maximal current and 607 for average current, D is the diffusion coefficient of the depolarizer in the medium (cm2/s), n is the number of electrons exchanged in the electrode reaction, m is the mass flow rate of Hg through the capillary (mg/s), t is the drop lifetime in seconds, and c is depolarizer concentration in mol/cm3. The equation is named after the scientist who derived it, the Slovak chemist Dion√Ωz Ilkoviƒç (1907‚Äì1980).

Often characterized as an ideal king, he is known for his generosity, courage, and patronage of scholars. Vikramaditya is featured in hundreds of traditional Indian legends, including those in Baital Pachisi and Singhasan Battisi. Many describe him as a universal ruler, with his capital at Ujjain (Pataliputra or Pratishthana in a few stories). According to popular tradition, Vikramaditya began the Vikrama Samvat era in 2020 after defeating the Shakas, and those who believe that he is based on a historical figure place him around the first century BCE. However, this era is identified as \\"Vikrama Samvat\\" after the ninth century CE. Other scholars believe that Vikramaditya is a mythical character, since several legends about him are fantastic in nature. \\"Vikramaditya\\" was a common title adopted by several Indian kings, and the Vikramaditya legends may be embellished accounts of different kings (particularly Chandragupta II).  Etymology and names  Vikramaditya means \\"the sun of valour\\" (vikrama means \\"valour\\" and aditya means \\"sun\\"). He is also known as Vikrama, Bikramjit and Vikramarka (arka also means \\"sun\\"). Some legends describe him as a liberator of India from mlechchha invaders; the invaders are identified as Shakas in most, and the king is known by the epithet Shakari (; \\"enemy of the Shakas\\").  Early legends  Although Vikramaditya is mentioned in a few works dated to before the Gupta period (240‚Äì550 CE), portions (including Vikramaditya) may be later Gupta-era interpolations. The earliest work to mention Vikramaditya was probably Brihatkatha, an Indian epic written between the first century BCE and the third century CE in the unattested Paisaci language. Its existence (and its mention of Vikramaditya) is confirmed only by adaptations in surviving works dating to the sixth century and later and testimonials by contemporary poets. Since there is no surviving copy of Brihatkatha, it is not known if it contained the Vikramaditya legends; its post-Gupta adaptations, such as the Katha-Sarit-Sagara, may contain interpolations. Gaha Sattasai (or Gatha- Saptasati), a collection of poems attributed to the Satavahana king HƒÅla (), mentions a king named Vikramaditya who gave away his wealth out of charity. However, many stanzas in this work are not common to its revisions and are apparent Gupta-period expansions. The verse about Vikramaditya is similar to a phrase‚ÄîAnekago-shatasahasra-hiranya-kotipradasya‚Äîfound in Gupta inscriptions about Samudragupta and Chandragupta II (for example, the Pune and Riddhapur copper-plate inscriptions of Chandragupta's daughter, Prabhavatigupta); this phrase may have been a later, Gupta-era insertion in the work attributed to HƒÅla. The earliest uncontested mentions of Vikramaditya appear in sixth- century works: the biography of Vasubandhu by Paramartha (499‚Äì569) and Vasavadatta by Subandhu. Paramaratha quotes a legend which mentions Ayodhya (\\"A-yu-ja\\") as the capital of king Vikramaditya (\\"Pi-ka-la-ma-a-chi-ta\\"). According to this legend, the king gave 300,000 gold coins to the Samkhya scholar Vindhyavasa for defeating Vasubandhu's Buddhist teacher (Buddhamitra) in a philosophical debate. Vasubandhu then wrote Paramartha Saptati, illustrating deficiencies in Samkhya philosophy. Vikramaditya, pleased with Vasubandhu's arguments, gave him 300,000 gold coins as well. Vasubandhu later taught Buddhism to Prince Baladitya and converted the queen to Buddhism after the king's death. According to Subandhu, Vikramaditya was a glorious memory by his time. In his Si-yu-ki, Xuanzang () identifies Vikramaditya as the king of Shravasti. According to his account, the king (despite his treasurer's objections) ordered that 500,000 gold coins be distributed to the poor and gave a man 100,000 gold coins for putting him back on track during a wild boar hunt. Around the same time, a Buddhist monk known as Manoratha paid a barber 100,000 gold coins for shaving his head. Vikramaditya, who prided himself on his generosity, was embarrassed and arranged a debate between Manoratha and 100 non-Buddhist scholars. After Manoratha defeated 99 of the scholars, the king and other non-Buddhists shouted him down and humiliated him at the beginning of the last debate. Before his death, Manoratha wrote to his disciple Vasubandhu about the futility of debating biased, ignorant people. Shortly after Vikramaditya's death, Vasubandhu asked his successor, Baladitya, to organise another debate to avenge his mentor's humiliation. In this debate, Vasubandhu defeated 100 non-Buddhist scholars.  Association with Vikrama Samvat  After the ninth century, a calendar era beginning in 57 BCE (now called the Vikrama Samvat) began to be associated with Vikramaditya; some legends also associate the Shaka era (beginning in 78 CE) with him. When Persian scholar Al-Biruni (973‚Äì1048) visited India, he learned that the Indians used five eras: Sri Harsha, Vikramaditya (57 BCE), Shaka (78 CE), Vallabha and Gupta. The Vikramaditya era was used in southern and western India. Al-Biruni learned the following legend about the Shaka era: Since there was a difference of over 130 years between the Vikramaditya era and the Shaka era, Al-Biruni concluded that their founders were two kings with the same name. The Vikramaditya era named after the first, and the Shaka era was associated with the defeat of the Shaka ruler by the second Vikramaditya. According to several later legends‚Äîparticularly Jain legends‚ÄîVikramaditya established the 57 BCE era after he defeated the Shakas and was defeated in turn by Shalivahana, who established the 78 CE era. Both legends are historically inaccurate. There is a difference of 135 years between the beginning of the two eras, and Vikramaditya and Shalivahana could not have lived simultaneously. The association of the era beginning in 57 BCE with Vikramaditya is not found in any source before the ninth century. Earlier sources call this era by several names, including \\"K·πõ·π≠a\\", \\"the era of the Malava tribe\\", or \\"Samvat\\" (\\"Era\\"). Scholars such as D. C. Sircar and D. R. Bhandarkar believe that the name of the era changed to Vikrama Samvat during the reign of Chandragupta II, who had adopted the title of \\"Vikramaditya\\" (see below). Alternative theories also exist, and Rudolf Hoernl√© believed that it was Yashodharman who renamed the era Vikrama Samvat. The earliest mention of the Shaka era as the Shalivahana era occurs in the 13th century, and may have been an attempt to remove the era's foreign association.  10th- to 12th- century legends  = Brihatkatha adaptations = Kshemendra's Brihatkathamanjari and Somadeva's 11th-century Kathasaritsagara, both adaptations of Brihatkatha, contain a number of legends about Vikramaditya. Each legend has several fantasy stories within a story, illustrating his power. The first legend mentions Vikramaditya's rivalry with the king of Pratishthana. In this version, that king is named Narasimha (not Shalivahana) and Vikramaditya's capital is Pataliputra (not Ujjain). According to the legend, Vikramaditya was an adversary of Narasimha who invaded Dakshinapatha and besieged Pratishthana; he was defeated and forced to retreat. He then entered Pratishthana in disguise and won over a courtesan. Vikramaditya was her lover for some time before secretly returning to Pataliputra. Before his return, he left five golden statues which he had received from Kubera at the courtesan's house. If a limb of one of these miraculous statues was broken off and gifted to someone, the golden limb would grow back. Mourning the loss of her lover, the courtesan turned to charity; known for her gifts of gold, she soon surpassed Narasimha in fame. Vikramaditya later returned to the courtesan's house, where Narasimha met and befriended him. Vikramaditya married the courtesan and brought her to Pataliputra. Contemporary artist's impression of a vetala hanging from a tree, with Vikramaditya in the background Book 12 (Shashankavati) contains the vetala panchavimshati legends, popularly known as Baital Pachisi. It is a collection of 25 stories in which the king tries to capture and hold a vetala who tells a puzzling tale which ends with a question. In addition to Kathasaritsagara, the collection appears in three other Sanskrit recensions, a number of Indian vernacular versions and several English translations from Sanskrit and Hindi; it is the most popular of the Vikramaditya legends. There are minor variations among the recensions; see List of Vetala Tales. In Kshemendra, Somadeva and ≈öivadƒÅsa's recensions, the king is named Trivikramasena; in Kathasaritsagara, his capital is located at Pratishthana. At the end of the story, the reader learns that he was formerly Vikramaditya. Later texts, such as the Sanskrit Vetala-Vikramaditya- Katha and the modern vernacular versions, identify the king as Vikramaditya of Ujjain. Book 18 (Vishamashila) contains another legend told by Naravahanadatta to an assembly of hermits in the ashram of a sage, Kashyapa. According to the legend, Indra and other devas told Shiva that the slain asuras were reborn as mlechchhas. Shiva then ordered his attendant, Malyavat, to be born in Ujjain as the prince of the Avanti kingdom and kill the mlechchhas. The deity appeared to the Avanti king Mahendraditya in a dream, telling him that a son would be born to his queen Saumyadarshana. He asked the king to name the child Vikramaditya, and told him that the prince would be known as \\"Vishamashila\\" because of his hostility to enemies. Malyavat was born as Vikramaditya; when the prince grew up, Mahendraditya retired to Varanasi. Vikramaditya began a campaign to conquer a number of kingdoms and subdued vetalas, rakshasas and other demons. His general, Vikramashakti, conquered the Dakshinapatha in the south; Madhyadesa in the central region; Surashtra in the west, and the country east of the Ganges; Vikramashakti also made the northern kingdom of Kashmira a tributary state of Vikramaditya. Virasena, the king of Sinhala, gave his daughter Madanalekha to Vikramaditya in marriage. The emperor also married three other women (Gunavati, Chandravati and Madanasundari) and Kalingasena, the princess of Kalinga. The Brihatkathamanjari contains similar legends, with some variations; Vikramaditya's general Vikramashakti defeated a number of mlechchhas, including Kambojas, Yavanas, Hunas, Barbaras, Tusharas and Persians. In Brihatkathamanjari and Kathasaritsagara, Malyavat is later born as Gunadhya (the author of Brihatkatha, on which these books are based). = Rajatarangini = Kalhana's 12th-century Rajatarangini mentions that Harsha Vikramaditya of Ujjayini defeated the Shakas. According to the chronicle Vikramaditya appointed his friend, the poet Matrigupta, ruler of Kashmir. After Vikramaditya's death, Matrigupta abdicated the throne in favour of Pravarasena. According to D. C. Sircar, Kalhana confused the legendary Vikramaditya with the Vardhana Emperor Harshavardhana (); Madhusudana's 17th- century Bhavabodhini similarly confuses the two kings, and mentions that Harsha, the author of Ratnavali, had his capital at Ujjain.  Paramara legends  The Paramara kings, who ruled Malwa (including Ujjain) from the ninth to the fourteenth century, associated themselves with Vikramaditya and other legendary kings to justify their imperial claims. = Simhasana Dvatrimsika = Simhasana Dvatrimsika (popularly known as Singhasan Battisi) contains 32 folktales about Vikramaditya. In this collection of frame stories, the Paramara king Bhoja discovers the ancient throne of Vikramaditya after several centuries. The throne has 32 statues, who are actually apsaras who were turned into stone by a curse. When Bhoja tries to ascend the throne, one apsara comes to life and tells him to ascend the throne only if he is as magnanimous as Vikramaditya (as revealed by her tale). This leads to 32 attempts by Bhoja to ascend the throne, with 32 tales of Vikramaditya's virtue; after each, Bhoja acknowledges his inferiority. Pleased with his humility, the statues finally let him ascend the throne. The author and date of the original work are unknown. Since the story mentions Bhoja (who died in 1055), it must have been composed after the 11th century. Five primary recensions of the Sanskrit version, Simhasana-dvatrimsika, are dated to the 13th and 14th centuries. According to Sujan Rai's 1695 Khulasat-ut-Tawarikh, its author was Bhoja's Pradhan Mantri (prime minister) Pandit Braj. Vetala Panchavimshati and Simhasana Dvatrimsika are structurally opposite. In the Vetala tales, Vikramaditya is the central character of the frame story but is unconnected with the individual tales except for hearing them from the vetala. Although the frame story of the Throne Tales is set long after Vikramaditya's death, those tales describe his life and deeds. = Bhavishya Purana = The Bhavishya Purana, an ancient Hindu text, also connects Vikramaditya to the Paramaras. According to the text (3.1.6.45-7.4), the first Paramara king was Pramara (born from a fire pit at Mount Abu, thus an Agnivansha). Vikramaditya, Shalivahana and Bhoja are described as Pramara's descendants and members of the Paramara dynasty. According to the Bhavishya Purana, when the world was degraded by non-Vedic faiths, Shiva sent Vikramaditya to earth and established a throne decorated with 32 designs for him (a reference to Simhasana Dvatrimsika). Shiva's wife, Parvati, created a vetala to protect Vikramaditya and instruct him with riddles (a reference to Baital Pachisi legends). After hearing the vetala's stories, Vikramaditya performed an Ashvamedha Yagya. The wandering of the sacrificial horse defined the boundary of Vikramaditya's empire: the Indus River in the west, Badaristhana (Badrinath) in the north, Kapila in the east and Setubandha (Rameshwaram) in the south. The emperor united the four Agnivanshi clans by marrying princesses from the three non- Paramara clans: Vira from the Chauhan clan, Nija from the Chalukya clan, and Bhogavati from the Parihara clan. All the gods except Chandra celebrated his success (a reference to the Chandravanshis, rivals of Suryavanshi clans such as the Paramaras). There were 18 kingdoms in Vikramaditya's empire of Bharatavarsha (India). After a flawless reign, he ascended to heaven. At the beginning of the Kali Yuga, Vikramaditya came from Kailasa and convened an assembly of sages from the Naimisha Forest. Gorakhnath, Bhartrhari, Lomaharsana, Saunaka and other sages recited the Puranas and the Upapuranas. A hundred years after Vikramaditya's death, the Shakas invaded India again. Shalivahana, Vikramaditya's grandson, subjugated them and other invaders. Five hundred years after Shalivahana's death, Bhoja defeated later invaders.  Jain legends  Several works by Jain authors contain legends about Vikramaditya, including: Few references to Vikramaditya exist in Jain literature before the mid-12th century, although Ujjain appears frequently. After the Jain king Kumarapala (), it became fashionable among Jain writers to compare Kumarapala to Vikramaditya. By the end of the 13th century, legends featuring Vikramaditya as a Jain emperor began surfacing. A major theme in Jain tradition is that the Jain acharya Siddhasena Divakara converted Vikramaditya to Jainism. He is said to have told Vikramaditya that 1,199 years after him, there would be another great king like him (Kumarapala). Jain tradition originally had four Simhasana-related stories and four vetala- related puzzle stories. Later Jain authors adopted the 32 Simhasana Dvatrimsika and 25 Vetala Panchavimshati stories. The Jain author Hemachandra names Vikramaditya as one of four learned kings; the other three are Shalivahana, Bhoja and Munja. Merutunga's Vicarasreni places his victory at Ujjain in 57 BCE, and hints that his four successors ruled from 3 to 78 CE. = Shalivahana-Vikramaditya rivalry = Kalpasutra and Kalakacharya Katha manuscript Many legends, particularly Jain legends, associate Vikramaditya with Shalivahana of Pratishthana (another legendary king). In some he is defeated by Shalivahana, who begins the Shalivahana era; in others, he is an ancestor of Shalivahana. A few legends call the king of Pratishthana \\"Vikramaditya\\". Political rivalry between the kings is sometimes extended to language, with Vikramaditya supporting Sanskrit and Shalivahana supporting Prakrit. In the Kalakacharya-Kathanaka, Vikramaditya's father Gardabhilla abducted the sister of Kalaka (a Jain acharya). At Kalaka's insistence, the Shakas invaded Ujjain and made Gardabhilla their prisoner. Vikramaditya later arrived from Pratishthana, defeated the Shakas, and began the Vikrama Samvat era to commemorate his victory. According to Alain Dani√©lou, the Vikramaditya in this legend refers to a Satavahana king. Other Jain texts contain variations of a legend about Vikramaditya's defeat at the hands of the king of Pratishthana, known as Satavahana or Shalivahana. This theme is found in Jina- Prabhasuri's Kalpa-Pradipa, Rajashekhara's Prabandha-Kosha and Salivahana- Charitra, a Marathi work. According to the legend, Satavahana was the child of the NƒÅga (serpent) chief Shesha and a Brahmin widow who lived in the home of a potter. His name, Satavahana, was derived from satani (give) and vahana (a means of transport) because he sculpted elephants, horses and other means of transport with clay and gave them to other children. Vikramaditya perceived omens that his killer had been born. He sent his vetala to find the child; the vetala traced Satavahana in Pratishthana, and Vikramaditya led an army there. With NƒÅga magic, Satavahana converted his clay figures of horses, elephants and soldiers into a real army. He defeated Vikramaditya (who fled to Ujjain), began his own era, and became a Jain. There are several variations of this legend: Vikramaditya is killed by Satavahana's arrow in battle; he marries Satavahana's daughter and they have a son (known as Vikramasena or Vikrama- charitra), or Satavahana is the son of Manorama, wife of a bodyguard of the king of Pratishthana.  Tamil legends  In a medieval Tamil legend Vikramaditya has 32 marks on his body, a characteristic of universal emperors. A Brahmin in need of Alchemic quicksilver tells him that it can be obtained if the emperor offers his head to the goddess Kamakshi of Kanchipuram. Although Vikramaditya agrees to sacrifice himself, the goddess fulfills his wish without the sacrifice. In another Tamil legend, Vikramaditya offers to perform a variant of the navakhandam rite (cutting the body in nine places) to please the gods. He offers to cut his body in eight places (for the eight Bhairavas), and offers his head to the goddess. In return, he convinces the goddess to end human sacrifice. Chola Purva Patayam (Ancient Chola Record), a Tamil manuscript of uncertain date, contains a legend about the divine origin of the three Tamil dynasties. In this legend, Shalivahana (also known as Bhoja) is a shramana king. He defeats Vikramaditya, and begins persecuting worshipers of Shiva and Vishnu. Shiva then creates the three Tamil kings to defeat him: Vira Cholan, Ula Cheran, and Vajranga Pandiyan. The kings have a number of adventures, including finding treasures and inscriptions of Hindu kings from the age of Shantanu to Vikramaditya. They ultimately defeat Shalivahana in the year 1443 (of an uncertain calendar era, possibly from the beginning of Kali Yuga).  Ayodhya legend  According to a legend in Ayodhya, the city was re- discovered by Vikramaditya after it was lost for centuries. Vikramaditya began searching for Ayodhya and met Prayaga, the king of tirthas. Guided by Prayaga, Vikramaditya marked the place but then forgot where it was. A yogi told him that he should free a cow and calf; Ayodhya would be where milk began to flow from the cow's udder. Following this advice, Vikramaditya found the site of ancient Ayodhya. According to Hans T. Bakker, present-day Ayodhya was originally the Saketa mentioned in Buddhist sources. The Gupta emperor Chandragupta II, who compared himself to Rama and was also known as Vikramaditya, moved his capital to Saketa and renamed it Ayodhya after the legendary city in the Ramayana. The Vikramaditya mentioned in Paramartha's fourth‚Äìfifth century CE biography of Vasubandhu is generally identified with a Gupta king, such as Skandagupta or Purugupta. Although the Gupta kings ruled from Pataliputra, Ayodhya was within their domain. However, scholars such as Ashvini Agrawal reject this account as inaccurate.  Other legends  According to Ananta's 12th-century heroic poem, Vira-Charitra (or Viracharita), Shalivahana (or Satavahana) defeated and killed Vikramaditya and ruled from Pratishthana. Shalivahana's associate, Shudraka, later allied with Vikramaditya's successors and defeated Shalivahana's descendants. This legend contains a number of mythological stories. ≈öivadƒÅsa's 12th‚Äì to 14th-century ≈öƒÅlivƒÅhana KƒÅtha (or Shalivahana-Charitra) similarly describes the rivalry between Vikramaditya and Shalivahana. ƒÄnanda's MƒÅdhavƒÅnala KƒÅmakandalƒÅ KathƒÅ is a story of separated lovers who are reunited by Vikramaditya. Vikramodaya is a series of verse tales in which the emperor appears as a wise parrot; a similar series is found in the Jain text, PƒÅr≈õvanƒÅthacaritra. The 15th- century‚Äîor later‚ÄîPa√±cada·πá·∏çachattra Prabandha (The Story of Umbrellas With Five Sticks) contains \\"stories of magic and witchcraft, full of wonderful adventures, in which VikramƒÅditya plays the r√¥le of a powerful magician\\". Ganapati's 16th-century Gujarati work, Madhavanala-Kamakandala-Katha, also contains Vikramaditya stories.  Navaratnas  In Jyotirvidabharana (22.10), a treatise attributed to Kalidasa, nine noted scholars (the Navaratnas) were at Vikramaditya's court: # Amarasimha, # Dhanavantari, # Ghatakarapara, # Kalidasa, # Kshapanaka, # Shanku, # Varahamihira, # Vararuchi, and # Vetala Bhatta. However, many scholars consider Jyotirvidabharana a literary forgery written after Kalidasa's death. According to V. V. Mirashi, who dates the work to the 12th century, it could not have been composed by Kalidasa because it contains grammatical errors. There is no mention of such Navaratnas in earlier literature, and D. C. Sircar calls Jyotirvidabharana \\"absolutely worthless for historical purposes\\". There is no historical evidence indicating that the nine scholars were contemporary figures or proteges of the same king. Vararuchi is believed to have lived around the third or fourth century CE. Although Kalidasa's lifetime is debated, most historians place him around the fifth century; Varahamihira is known to have lived in the sixth century. Dhanavantari was the author of a medical glossary (a nighantu), but his lifetime is uncertain. Amarasimha cannot be dated with certainty either, but his lexicon uses works by Dhanavantari and Kalidasa; therefore, he cannot be dated to the first century BCE (Vikramaditya is said to have established an era in 57 BCE). Little is known about Shanku, Vetalabhatta, Kshapanaka and Ghatakarpara. Some Jain writers identify Siddhasena Divakara as Kshapanaka, but this is not accepted by historians. Kalidasa is the only figure whose association with Vikramaditya is mentioned in works earlier than Jyotirvidabharana. According to Rajasekhara's KƒÅvyamimƒÅ·πÉsa (10th century), Bhoja's Sringara Prakasa and Kshemendra's Auchitya-Vichara-Charcha (both 11th century), Vikramaditya sent Kalidasa as his ambassador to the Kuntala country (present-day Uttara Kannada). However, the historicity of these reports is doubtful.  Historicity  Vikramaditya was a historical Malava king from around the first century BCE. Still others believe that he was a legendary character based on an historical king, identified as Chandragupta II, Gautamiputra Satakarni or Yashodharman. Vikramaditya may also be based on several kings, legends about whom gradually coalesced into a tradition surrounding him. According to K. Krishnamoorthy, \\"Vikramaditya\\" and \\"Kalidasa\\" were used as common nouns to identify a patron king and court poet. = Malava king = Rajbali Pandey, Kailash Chand Jain and others believe that Vikramaditya was an Ujjain-based Malava king. The Shakas advanced from Sindh to Malwa around the first century BCE, and were defeated by Vikramaditya. The Krita era, which later came to be known as Vikrama Samvat, marked this victory. Chandragupta II later adopted the title of Vikramaditya after defeating the Shakas. Proponents of this theory say that Vikramaditya is mentioned in works dating to before the Gupta era, including Brihatkatha and Gatha Saptashati. Vikramaditya cannot be based on Chandragupta II, since the Gupta capital was at Pataliputra (not Ujjain). According to Raj Pruthi, legends surrounding this first-century king gradually became intertwined with those of later kings called \\"Vikramaditya\\" (including Chandragupta II). Critics of this theory say that Gatha Saptashati shows clear signs of Gupta- era interpolation. According to A. K. Warder, Brihatkathamanjari and Kathasaritsagara are \\"enormously inflated and deformed\\" recensions of the original Brihatkatha. The early Jain works do not mention Vikramaditya and the navaratnas have no historical basis as the nine scholars do not appear to have been contemporary figures. Legends surrounding Vikramaditya are contradictory, border on the fantastic and are inconsistent with historical facts; no epigraphic, numismatic or literary evidence suggests the existence of a king with the name (or title) of Vikramaditya around the first century BCE. Although the Puranas contain genealogies of significant Indian kings, they do not mention a Vikramaditya ruling from Ujjain or Pataliputra before the Gupta era. There is little possibility of an historically-unattested, powerful emperor ruling from Ujjain around the first century BCE among the Shungas (187‚Äì78 BCE), the Kanvas (75‚Äì30), the Satavahanas (230 BCE‚Äì220 CE), the Shakas () and the Indo-Greeks (180 BCE‚Äì10 CE). = Gupta kings = A number of Gupta Empire kings adopted the title of Vikramaditya or its equivalent, such as Samudragupta's \\"Parakramanka\\". According to D. C. Sircar, Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri and others, the exploits of these kings contributed to the Vikramaditya legends. Distinctions among them were lost over time, and the legendary Shalivahana was similarly based on the exploits of several Satavahana kings.  Chandragupta II  Chandragupta II on a coin Some scholars, including D. R. Bhandarkar, V. V. Mirashi and D. C. Sircar, believe that Vikramaditya is probably based on the Gupta king Chandragupta II. Based on coins and the Supia pillar inscription, it is believed that Chandragupta II adopted the title Vikramaditya. The Khambat and Sangli plates of the Rashtrakuta king Govinda IV use the epithet \\"Sahasanka\\", which has also been applied to Vikramaditya, for Chandragupta II. According to Alf Hiltebeitel, Chandragupta's victory against the Shakas was transposed to a fictional character who is credited with establishing the Vikrama Samvat era. In most of the legends Vikramaditya had his capital at Ujjain, although some mention him as king of Pataliputra (the Gupta capital). According to D. C. Sircar, Chandragupta II may have defeated the Shaka invaders of Ujjain and made his son, Govindagupta, a viceroy there. Ujjain may have become a second Gupta capital, and legends about him (as Vikramaditya) may have developed. The Guttas of Guttavalal, a minor dynasty based in present-day Karnataka, claimed descent from the Gupta Empire. Their Chaudadanapura inscription alludes to Vikramaditya ruling from Ujjain, and several Gutta kings were named Vikramaditya. According to Vasundhara Filliozat, the Guttas confused Vikramaditya with Chandragupta II; however, D. C. Sircar sees this as further proof that Vikramaditya was based on Chandragupta II.  Skandagupta  The Vikramaditya of Ayodhya legend is identified as Skandagupta () by a number of scholars. Book 18 of the Kathasaritsagara describes Vikramaditya as a son of Mahendraditya of Ujjain. According to D.C. Sircar, Kumaragupta I (r. 415‚Äì455 CE) adopted the title Mahendraditya. His son, Skandagupta, adopted the title Vikramaditya, and this set of legends may be based on Skandagupta. = Other rulers = In the Kathasaritsagara recension of the 25 vetala stories, the king is mentioned as the ruler of Pratishthana. A. K. Warder notes that the Satavahanas were the only notable ancient dynasty who ruled from Pratishthana. According to a Satavahana inscription, their king Gautamiputra Satakarni defeated the Shakas. One of Gautamiputra Satakarni's epithets was vara-varana-vikrama-charu-vikrama. However, according to D. C. Sircar, the epithet means \\"one whose gait is as beautiful as that of a choice elephant\\" and is unrelated to Vikramaditya. Most other Vikramaditya legends note the king's capital as Ujjain (or, less commonly, Pataliputra), but the Satavahanas never had their capital at these cities. Vikramaditya was also described as an adversary of the Pratishthana-based king Satavahana (or Shalivahana) in a number of legends. Max M√ºller believed that the Vikramaditya legends were based on the sixth-century Aulikara king Yashodharman. The Aulikaras used the Malava era (later known as Vikrama Samvat) in their inscriptions. According to Rudolf Hoernl√©, the name of the Malava era was changed to Vikramaditya by Yashodharman. Hoernl√© also believed that Yashodharman conquered Kashmir and is the Harsha Vikramaditya mentioned in Kalhana's Rajatarangini. Although Yashodharman defeated the Hunas (who were led by Mihirakula), the Hunas were not the Shakas; Yashodharman's capital was at Dasapura (modern Mandsaur), not Ujjain. There is no other evidence that he inspired the Vikramaditya legends.  Legacy  Several Vikramaditya stories appear in the Amar Chitra Katha comic-book series. Vikram Aur Betaal, which appeared on Doordarshan in the 1980s, was based on Baital Pachisi. An adaptation of Singhasan Battisi was aired on Doordarshan during the late 1980s. In 2014, another adaptation was aired on Sony Pal.

He emigrated to Israel at the age of 20 and lived on a kibbutz, then moved to France and opened a translation bureau. In the 1990s he was awarded the French Ordre national du M√©rite and the Ordre du M√©rite agricole for actions taken to rescue personnel in the War in Bosnia. In the AngolaGate scandal, he was convicted of failure to declare income. On 24 November 2015, he started serving a prison sentence at Fresnes prison in France for that tax issue. In the early 21st century, Gaydamak returned to Israel, where he founded Social Justice, a movement that became a political party. He ran for mayor of Jerusalem but did not win. He bought Hapoel Jerusalem, a professional basketball club. He also bought two newspapers, one in France and one in Russia. He directed the latter to take a pro-government/Vladimir Putin editorial stance. In Israel he has been a generous philanthropist. Biography Arcadi Gaydamak was born in 1952 in Moscow, the capital of the USSR. At the age of 20, Gaydamak was one of the first Jews to emigrate to Israel from Leonid Brezhnev's Soviet Union and receive Israeli citizenship. He lived on Kibbutz Beit HaShita, and studied Hebrew at an ulpan. He said he originally intended to serve in the Israeli Army, but ended up moving to France, where he opened a translation bureau. In 1982, Gaydamak Translations opened a branch in Canada. During that period he commenced international business, in import and export. After the collapse of the USSR, he built up ties in Russia and Kazakhstan and formed various business organizations across Europe. Gaydamak won two citations from the French government: Chevalier de l'Ordre national du M√©rite and the Ordre du M√©rite agricole for helping to rescue two captured French pilots in the War in Bosnia in the 1990s, as well as two French intelligence officers captured by rebel factions in the Caucasus. Because these operations were secret, the citations referred to his contribution to agriculture. Former French interior minister Charles Pasqua confirmed this, saying that President Jacques Chirac had personally authorized the citations. Gaydamak owns a home in Caesarea. He is married to Irene Tzirolnicova, with whom he has three children. He speaks Russian, French, and English. He also speaks Portuguese and Hebrew on a basic level. In December 2008, Gaydamak was reported to have left Israel and returned to Russia, settling in Moscow. In February 2009, it was reported that he was seeking to regain his Russian citizenship, lost when he emigrated to Israel decades before. Gaydamak was granted honorary Angolan citizenship. He holds French, Canadian, and Israeli passports. =Angola affair= In October 2009, Gaydamak and French magnate Pierre Falcone were convicted by a French court of organizing arms trafficking in Angola during the civil war in 1993‚Äì1998, to the value of US$790 million, in violation of the Lusaka Protocol. He was sentenced in absentia to six years in prison. His conviction on the arms dealing charges was overturned by the Court of Appeal in Paris on 29 April 2011. The only conviction remaining was for his incomplete 1994 tax declaration. =Politics= Arcadi Gaydamak during a press conference, February 2007 In February 2007, seeing the social issues in Israel, Gaydamak founded a party devoted to socio-economic issues, which he named Social Justice. Although the organization was established as a social movement, he said it could become a political party if the circumstances warranted it. In late 2007, the party contemplated taking part in the 2008 municipal elections. Gaydamak ran for mayor of Jerusalem in November 2008, but his party won no seats on the city council. During the campaign, Gaydamak courted the East Jerusalem Palestinian vote. Gaydamak approached the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Muhammad Ahmad Hussein, Palestinian political figures and media, and came away with a near endorsement. =Sport clubs and media ownership= In July 2005, Gaydamak became sponsor of the Hapoel Jerusalem basketball team. The following month he donated $400,000 to the Israeli Arab Bnei Sakhnin football club. On the same day, Gaydamak announced the purchase of 55% of the ownership of Beitar Jerusalem, and two days later he announced the acquisition of full ownership. Gaydamak is the patron of several Jewish charities and president of the Congress of Jewish Religious Communities and Organizations of Russia (KEROOR), Russia's oldest Jewish umbrella group. In the summer of 2008, Gaydamak claimed his son Alexandre was owner of Portsmouth F.C., and it was confirmed by the Premier League. In March 2006, he announced having bought the French newspaper France Soir via his company Moscow News. He had purchased the Russian Moskovskie Novosti newspaper in 2004, fired some senior journalists, and changed the paper's mandate to a firmly pro-government one, appointing a pro-Putin journalist as editor-in-chief. In January 2006, Portsmouth F.C. were sold to his son, Alexandre Gaydamak by Milan Mandariƒá. Gaydamak later sold the club to Ali al-Faraj in 2009. In June 2007, Gaydamak negotiated a deal to buy the non-kosher supermarket chain Tiv Taam. It was reported that he was planning to make the stores comply with Jewish religious practice: close them on Shabbat and halt the sale of pork products. A few days later the deal fell through, resulting in a lawsuit. In July 2009, Gaydamak announced his decision to give up the ownership of Beitar Jerusalem in favor of Itzik Kornfein and Guma Aguiar. Kornfein would handle buying and selling players, while Aguair would engage in financing. =Philanthropy and community service= A poster marking Arcadi Gaydamak's contributions to Jerusalem, 2007 Gaydamak has donated to many Israeli organizations, including Magen David Adom and Hatzalah. He also donated $10 million to the Jewish Agency for Israel During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, Gaydamak constructed a tent-village on the beach of Nitzanim, hosting thousands of families who fled the rocket-ridden North and had no place to go. Gaydamak's contributions totaled $15 million (about $500,000 a day). In November 2006, he funded a one-week-long vacation in Eilat for hundreds of Sderot residents who have suffered rocket attacks from Gaza.

Plot summary During the 1960s, in Virginia, while the blacks fight for their civil rights, a young white girl is kidnapped in Baltimore. Little Alice Raleigh, eleven years and blonde like corn, and heiress of an immense fortune, is held for a ransom of a million dollars. Her kidnappers, trying to make her invisible to the police officers and the federal agents searching for her, manage to brown her skin and her hair. They sequester her under an assumed name in a house held by an old black woman, near Norfolk, which turns out to be a house of prostitution. Slowly, Alice adapts herself to this surprising life amidst the black culture of the time period, completely new for her; at no point in the book is the young Alice made to participate in prostitution, and in fact Alice only has a vague idea of what goes on in behind closed doors in the house. She eventually discovers that her father is the real instigator of her kidnapping, in essence intending to embezzle money from himself that he can then spend without being traced by government offices. In the end, Alice is freed and returns to her former life, after denying knowledge of her father while still disguised as a black child and seeing him punished for his misdeed.

The 18th century saw the development of the modern novel as literary genre, in fact many candidates for the first novel in English date from this period, of which Daniel Defoe's 1719 Robinson Crusoe is probably the best known. Subgenres of the novel during the 18th century were the epistolary novel, the sentimental novel, histories, the gothic novel and the libertine novel. 18th Century Europe started in the Age of Enlightenment and gradually moved towards Romanticism. In the visual arts, it was the period of Neoclassicism.

Edmund Burke, in his A Vindication of Natural Society (2000), says: \\"The Fabrick of Superstition has in this our Age and Nation received much ruder Shocks than it had ever felt before; and through the Chinks and Breaches of our Prison, we see such Glimmerings of Light, and feel such refreshing Airs of Liberty, as daily raise our Ardor for more.\\"research by Shema Leon Patrick  English Literature in the Eighteenth Century by Year  =1700‚Äì09= In 1700, William Congreve's play The Way of the World premiered.Full text, gutenberg project, retrieved on 17-03-2012 Although unsuccessful at the time, The Way of the World is a good example of the sophistication of theatrical thinking during this period, with complex subplots and characters intended as ironic parodies of common stereotypes. In 1703, Nicholas Rowe's domestic drama The Fair Penitent, an adaptation of Massinger and Field's Fatal Dowry, appeared; it would later be pronounced by Dr Johnson to be one of the most pleasing tragedies in the language. Also in 1703 Sir Richard Steele's comedy The Tender Husband achieved some success. In 1704, Jonathan Swift (Irish satirist) published A Tale of a Tub and The Battle of the Books and John Dennis published his Grounds of Criticism in Poetry. The Battle of the Books begins with a reference to the use of a glass (which, in those days, would mean either a mirror or a magnifying glass) as a comparison to the use of satire. Swift is, in this, very much the child of his age, thinking in terms of science and satire at one and the same time. Swift often patterned his satire after Juvenal, the classical satirist.Satire#Classifications of satire He was one of the first English novelists and also a political campaigner. His satirical writing springs from a body of liberal thought which produced not only books but also political pamphlets for public distribution. Swift's writing represents the new, the different and the modern attempting to change the world by parodying the ancient and incumbent. The Battle of the Books is a short writing which demonstrates his position very neatly. In 1707, Henry Fielding was born (22 April) and his sister Sarah Fielding was born 3 years later on 8 November 1710. In 1711, Alexander Pope began a career in literature with the publishing of his An Essay on Criticism. In 1712, French philosophical writer Jean Jacques Rousseau born 28 June and his countryman Denis Diderot was born the following year 1713 on 5 October. Also in 1712 Pope published The Rape of the Lock and in 1713 Windsor Forest. In 1708, Simon Ockley publishes an English translation of Ibn Tufail's Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, a 12th-century philosophical novel, as The Improvement of Human Reason: Exhibited in the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan. This was the first English translation directly from the Arabic original. Samuel Johnson was born on 18 September 1709 in Lichfield, Staffordshire, England. =1710‚Äì19= Horace Walpole was born on 24 September 1717. Daniel Defoe was another political pamphleteer turned novelist like Jonathan Swift and was publishing in the early 18th century. In 1719, he published Robinson Crusoe. Alexander Smith was a biographer who authored A Complete History of the Lives and Robberies of the Most Notorious Highwaymen (1719) which includes heavily fictionalised accounts of English criminals from the medieval period to the eighteenth century. =1720‚Äì29= 1720 *Daniel Defoe's Captain Singleton is published. 1722 *Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders is published. Other published authors include Sir Richard Steele, Penelope Aubin and Eliza Haywood. Also in 1726, Jonathan Swift published Gulliver's Travels, one of the first novels in the genre of satire. In 1728, John Gay wrote The Beggar's Opera which has increased in fame ever since. The Beggar's Opera began a new style in Opera, the \\"ballad opera\\" which brings the operatic form down to a more popular level and precedes the genre of comic operettas. Also in 1728 came the publication of Cyclopaedia, or, A Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences (folio, 2 vols.), an encyclopedia by Ephraim Chambers. The Cyclopaedia was one of the first general encyclopedias to be produced in English and was the main model for Diderot's Encyclop√©die (published in France between 1751 and 1766). In 1729, Jonathan Swift published A Modest Proposal, a satirical suggestion that Irish families should sell their children as food. Swift was, at this time, fully involved in political campaigning for the Irish. =1730‚Äì39= In 1731, George Lillo's play The London Merchant was a success at the Theatre-Royal in Drury Lane. It was a new kind of play, a domestic tragedy, which approximates to what later came to be called a melodrama. In 1738, London, a poem in imitation of Juvenal‚Äôs Third Satire, by Samuel Johnson is published.

This compilation contains mini-biographies of 52 influential poets (most of whom lived in the 18th century) along with critical appraisals of their works. most notable are Alexander Pope, John Dryden, John Milton, Jonathan Swift, and Joseph Addison. =1780‚Äì89= 1783 Washington Irving was born. On 13 December 1784 Samuel Johnson died. 1785 William Cowper published The Task 1786 Robert Burns published Poems Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect. The mood of literature was swinging toward more interest in diverse ethnicity. Beaumarchais' The Marriage of Figaro (La Folle journ√©e ou Le Mariage de Figaro) was adapted into a comic opera composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte. 1789 The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, one of the first slave narratives to have been widely read in historical times, is published.

The two men published a joint volume of poetry, Lyrical Ballads (1798), which became a central text of Romantic poetry. 1796 Thomas Chandler Haliburton was born. 1796 * Matthew Lewis published his controversial, anti-catholic novel The Monk. * Charlotte Turner Smith published her novel Marchmont.  Others Literature in the Eighteenth Century by Year  =1700-1739= From 1704 to 1717, Antoine Galland published the first European translation of the One Thousand and One Nights (also known as The Arabian Nights in English).Jacob W. Grimm (1982). Selected Tales pg 19. Penguin Classics His version of the tales appeared in twelve volumes and exerted a huge influence on subsequent European literature and attitudes to the Islamic world. Galland's translation of the Nights was immensely popular throughout Europe, and later versions of the Nights were written by Galland's publisher using Galland's name without his consent. In 1707, playwright Carlo Goldoni was born. In 1729, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was born. In 1731, Manon Lescaut, a French novel by the Abb√© Pr√©vost that narrates the love affairs of an unmarried couple and inaugurates one of the most common themes of the literature of the time: the sentimental story, taking into account for the first time the female point of view and not only the courtship and the conquest or the failure of man. =1740‚Äì69= 1743 Gavrila Derzhavin is born. 1752, Microm√©gas, a satirical short story by Voltaire, features space travellers visiting earth. It is one of the first stories to feature several elements of what will later become known as science fiction. Its publication at this time is also indicative of the trend toward scientific thinking that characterizes the Enlightenment. 1759 Voltaire's Candide/Optimism is published. On November 10, Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller is born. 1761 Jean Jacques Rousseau's Julie, ou la nouvelle H√©lo√Øse is published. 1762 Jean Jacques Rousseau's √âmile is published. 1767 September 8: August Wilhelm von Schlegel is born. =1770‚Äì1800= 1772 March 10: Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel is born. *German poet Novalis is born. 1774 Goethe wrote The Sorrows of Young Werther, a novel which approximately marks the beginning of the Romanticism movement in the arts and philosophy. A transition thus began, from the critical, science inspired, enlightenment writing to the romantic yearning for forces beyond the mundane and for foreign times and places to inspire the soul with passion and mystery. 1778 Death of Voltaire. Death of Jean Jacques Rousseau 2 July. Two major contributors to Diderot's Encyclop√©die dead in the same year. 1784 Denis Diderot died 31 July. Voltaire, Rousseau and Diderot have all died within a period of a few years and French philosophy had thus lost three of its greatest enlightened free thinkers. Rousseau's thinking on the nobility of life in the wilds, facing nature as a naked savage still had great force to influence the next generation as the romantic movement gained momentum. Beaumarchais wrote The Marriage of Figaro. Maria and Harriet Falconar publish Poems on Slavery. The anti-slavery movement was growing in power and many poems and pamphlets were published on the subject. 1791 Dream of the Red Chamber is published for the first time in movable type format. 1793 August 25: John Neal is born. 1796 Denis Diderot's Jacques le fataliste was published posthumously. 1700s - 1710s - 1720s - 1730s - 1740s - 1750s - 1760s - 1770s - 1780s - 1790s - 1800s = Selected list of novels = *Simon Ockley, The Improvement of Human Reason: Exhibited in the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan (British, 1708) - English translation of Ibn Tufail's Hayy ibn Yaqdhan (12th century) *Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe, (British, 1719) - considered by many the first novel in English *Eliza Haywood, Love in Excess, (British, 1719) *Samuel Richardson, Pamela, (British, 1740) *Henry Fielding, Tom Jones, (British, 1749) *Laurence Sterne, Tristram Shandy, (British, 1759‚Äì1767) *Tobias Smollett, The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, (Scottish, 1771) *Ignacy Krasicki, The Adventures of Nicholas Experience (Polish, 1776) - the first Polish novel *Frances Burney, Evelina, (British, 1778) *Ann Radcliffe, The Mysteries of Udolpho, (British, 1794) *Mary Hays, Memoirs of Emma Courtney, (British, 1796) *Matthew Lewis, The Monk, (British, 1796) References External links * Category:History of literature ","title":"18th century in literature"},{"id":"3596459","text":"Alexandre \\"Sacha\\" Gaydamak (, born May 1976 in France) is a French and Israeli businessman. A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the only son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandariƒá. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandariƒá remained at the club as non- executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be ¬£32,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent ¬£2.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C. had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.

Parsons (October 11, 1913April 18, 2007) pioneered numerical control (NC) for machine tools in the 1940s. These developments were done in collaboration with his Chief Engineer and Vice President of Engineering, Frank L. Stulen, who Parsons hired when he was head of the Rotary Wing Branch of the Propeller Lab at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in April 1946. Together, they were the first to use computer methods to solve machining problems, in particular, the accurate interpolation of the curves describing helicopter rotor blades. In 1946, \\"computer\\" still meant a punched-card operated calculation machine. In 1948, Parsons' company, \\"Parsons Corporation\\" of Traverse City, Michigan, was awarded a contract to make the challenging tapered wings for military aircraft; they won the contract because they developed the computer support to do the difficult three-dimensional interpolation for the complex shapes, as well as the 800 steps long production cycle for the wing manufacturing. IBM was one of the subcontractors, as was MIT, which took care of the servomechanisms. The latter lab boosted the developments of numerical control machining in the following decades, by developing reliable servo control in 1952 and the APT (Automatic Programmed Tool) programming language for NC machines. It was only after the servos were also steered by computers that real \\"numerical control\\" was realised. The initial developments of Parsons and Stulen were only about the calculations, and not the control: the results of the calculations were given to human operators that turned the wheels on the machine tool to generate the desired tool paths. Parsons, however, quickly saw the potential of connecting computers to the machine motors. On January 14, 1958, he received a patent for a Motor Controlled Apparatus for Positioning Machine Tool (patent number 2,820,187, filed on May 5, 1952). The initial developments of NC machines, however, had been so expensive that Parsons was fired from his own company because the funding of the MIT developments was too much for the company. Parsons was reinstated as president of the company after royalties on the patent had generated significant amounts of money. (Bendix Corporation was an initial licensee of the patent, in 1955, and eventually bought all the rights to it.) In 1985, Parsons and Stulen received the National Medal of Technology. In 1988 he received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from the University of Michigan. In 1993, Parsons (but not Stulen) was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for inventing numerical control. On Wednesday April 19, 2007 John T. Parsons died at the Grand Traverse Pavilions. He was 93. He had a son, David Cameron Parsons.

An einzel lens (from ‚Äì single lens), or unipotential lens, is a charged particle electrostatic lens that focuses without changing the energy of the beam. It consists of three or more sets of cylindrical or rectangular apertures or tubes in series along an axis. It is used in ion optics to focus ions in flight, which is accomplished through manipulation of the electric field in the path of the ions. The electrostatic potential in the lens is symmetric, so the ions will regain their initial energy on exiting the lens, although the velocity of the outer particles will be altered such that they converge on to the axis. This causes the outer particles to arrive at the focus intersection slightly later than the ones that travel along a straight path, as they have to travel an extra distance. Theory A perspective view of an einzel lens. Da accelerated to 40 kV, the middle plate potential is at 200 V, and the plate size is 1 m (note that these values are atypical for illustrative purposes). The equation for the change in radial velocity for a particle as it passes between any pair of cylinders in the lens is: \\\\Delta v_r = \\\\int \\\\frac{qE_r(r,z)}{m v_z} dz, with z axis passing through the middle of the lens, and r being the direction normal to z. If the lens is constructed with cylindrical electrodes, the field is symmetrical around z. E_r(r,z) is the magnitude of the electric field in the radial direction for a particle at a particular radial distance and distance across the gap, m is the mass of the particle passing through the field, v_z is the velocity of the particle and q is the charge of the particle. The integral occurs over the gap between the plates. This is also the interval where the lensing occurs. The pair of plates is also called an electrostatic immersion lens, thus an einzel lens can be described as two or more electrostatic immersion lenses. Solving the equation above twice to find the change in radial velocity for each pair of plates can be used to calculate the focal length of the lens. Application to television tubes The einzel lens principle in a simplified form was also used as a focusing mechanism in display and television cathode ray tubes,\\"Radio and Television\\" by C. A. Quarrington, 1952‚Äì1963.\\"Television Receiver Servicing\\" by E. A. W. Spreadbury, 1953. and has the advantage of providing a good sharply focused spot throughout the useful life of the tube's electron gun, with minimal or no readjustment needed (many monochrome TVs did not have or need focus controls), although in high-resolution monochrome displays and all colour CRT displays a (technician-adjustable) focus potentiometer control is provided.

Nykken is a symphonic poem composed by the Norwegian composer Geirr Tveitt in 1957. It is written for orchestra and several solo instruments, although they do not have any solo roles. It was written on demand for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) and survived a fire in 1970 by being kept safe in their archives. It is built on a Norwegian legend about the sea-creature n√∏kken, and is based on a story about him transforming into a beautiful, white horse and getting out of a silent pond. The horse lures a young boy onto its back and takes him with it back into the pond, generating a great disturbance in the normally so silent water. A normal performance lasts about 16‚Äì18 minutes. Nykken (Norwegian) or N√§cken (Swedish), originating from Old Norse, is a spirit said to exist along the borders of water and land.

History The mill was erected c1820 by millwright Robert Barnes of Great Yarmouth. It was disused in 1883 but later put back to work. The mill was worked by wind until 1956. Her owners, the Somerleyton Estate were keen to ensure that she was preserved. East Suffolk County Council agreed in principle that the mill should be preserved, and approached the Ministry of Works who agreed to pay half the cost of the restoration. Most of the rest of the money came from East Suffolk County Council and the Suffolk Preservation Society, with smaller amounts from other groups. Restoration of the mill was undertaken by Thomas Smithdale & Sons, the Acle millwrights. The mill was officially opened on 25 July 1958 by Charles Howlett, who had been marshman at the mill for over forty years. Further restoration work was done in 1971 by Neville Martin, the Beccles millwright. Description Herringfleet Windmill & Bridge Herringfleet Mill is an octagonal three-storey smock mill with a boat-shaped cap. Winding is by tailpole and winch, the last mill on the Broads. The four Common sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The wooden brake sheel has 59 teeth. It drives a cast-iron wallower with 47 cogs. The wallower is mounted on an square upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft a cast-iron bevel gear with 33 teeth drives a cast-iron pit wheel with 102 cogs. The pit wheel is carried on a cast-iron shaft diameter. This shaft has at its outer end a by scoopwheel. The mill could pump of water per minute.

Contemporary urban village ideas are closely related to New Urbanism and smart growth ideas initiated in the United States. Urban villages are seen to provide an alternative to recent patterns of urban development in many cities, especially decentralization and urban sprawl. They are generally purported to: * Reduce car reliance and promote cycling, walking and transit use * Provide a high level of self-containment (people working, recreating and living in the same area) * Help facilitate strong community institutions and interaction The concept of urban villages was formally born in Britain in the late 1980s with the establishment of the Urban Villages Group (UVG).Tony Aldous (1992) Urban villages : a concept for creating mixed-use urban developments on a sustainable scale, London: Urban Villages Group, pp. 11-13 Following pressure from the UVG, the concept was prioritized in British national planning policy between 1997 and 1999.Department of the Environment (DOE) (1997) PPG1: General Policies and Proposals, London: DOE Urban villages also come in the form of suburbs of metropolitan areas that are politically designated as villages. Application Urban village ideals have been applied to new greenfield and brownfield developments and urban renewal projects. The concept has been widely adopted in many countries and used by both government development agencies as well as private enterprise as a guiding concept for many projects. Influences and impetus The ideas of the urban commentator Jane Jacobs are widely regarded as having had the largest influence on the urban village concept.Robert Gratz (2003), 'Authentic urbanism and the Jane Jacobs legacy' in Urban villages and the making of communities, London: Spon Press, pp. 17-23 Jacobs rejected the modernist views that dominated urban planning and architecture in the 1950s-60s and constructed an alternative philosophy that values traditional neighborhoods and the role of the inner city.Jane Jacobs (1961) The death and life of American cities, New York: Random House Proponents believe that urban villages provide a viable alternative to the social ills that characterize modernism in cities, such as freeways and high- rise estates. Another strong impetus for urban villages has been growing disenchantment with the urban sprawl that has characterized the development of many cities since World War II. Urban villages are seen to create self- contained communities that reduce the need to travel large distances and reduce the subsequent reliance on the automobile. The decline of noxious industry and the emergence of the service economy allows the mixing of employment and residential activities without detriment to residents. This is in contrast to the single-use zoning that helped fuel urban sprawl during the industrial and manufacturing eras. Through more consolidated development, urban villages can reduce the intrusion of urban growth on the countryside. These environmental consequences of urban sprawl have come to dominate discussion promoting urban villages in recent years.Michael Biddulph, Bridgett Franklin & Malcolm Tait (2003) 'From concept to completion: A critical analysis of the urban village', Town and Regional Planning, 74:2 Urban villages are widely seen to provide a solution to the demise of community that is often associated with modernism and sprawl. The concept uses the social and physical morphology of the traditional rural village as an inspiration for creating better functioning communities. The urban village movement has been influenced by Ebenezer Howard‚Äôs Garden City ideals which also emphasize environmental determinism in relation to community. Urban design techniques such as public space and pedestrianization are employed to facilitate the development of community by encouraging human interaction. This philosophy shares many attributes with the new urbanism school of thought. Criticisms Many urban village developments, both Government and privately initiated, have been seen to depart from the original ideals of the concept. Private developments often use the ‚Äòurban village‚Äô label as an advertising pitch or to win Government support for their project.Michael Biddulph, Bridgett Franklin & Malcolm Tait (2003) 'From concept to completion: A critical analysis of the urban village', Town and Regional Planning, 74:2 Many developments, although intended to create a true urban village form, have not achieved their objectives. Some planners question whether a genuine urban village has actually been built.Bridget Franklin and Malcolm Tait (2003), 'Constructing an image: The urban village concept in the UK', Planning Theory, 1:3 The objectives of urban villages are often criticized as unrealistic because they ignore broader social and economic realities. The ability to create self- contained villages is questionable as employment and activity patterns continue to become more complex. The viability of creating a variety of employment and activity within an area with a small population base can also be questioned.Malcolm Tait (2003), 'Urban Villages as self-sufficient, integrated communities: a case study in London's Docklands', Urban Design International, 8 It has been suggested that the demise of the neighborhood community is a function of ‚Äúconscious economic and social choice‚Äù rather than a product of urban form.Hugh Barton (2000), 'Do Neighbourhoods Matter?', Sustainable Communities: The Potential for Eco-Neighbourhoods, London: Earthscan The limitations of the urban village concept to achieve sustainability in urban areas have also been studied in developing countries, which further emphasizes the institutional barriers against such an application in the case of the developing countries. This issue becomes more critical when we accept that the institutional landscape in rural environments is more complex than urban areas and that incompatible institutional structure of the developing countries would add to the idealistic nature of the urban village concept.Hossein Bahrainy and Mehdi Azizkhani (2012), 'Institutional Barriers to the Application of Urban Village as A Tool for Achieving Urban Sustainability in Developing Countries-the Case of Asheghabaad, Isfahan, Iran', Armanshahr Journal, 5(8), 43:57 Some urban commentators believe that urban villages are not a new concept and are simply a re-formulation of ideas that have been prevalent in urban planning for decades.Bridget Franklin and Malcolm Tait (2003), 'Constructing an image: The urban village concept in the UK', Planning Theory, 1:3 Examples The following is a brief list of a few projects claimed to be urban villages that have evolved or already been completed, or are in planning stages: * Bulimba & Hawthorne Urban Village - Brisbane Queensland Australia * Kelvin Grove Urban Village, Brisbane, Australia * Doncaster Hill, Melbourne, Australia * Westboro Village, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada * Commercial Drive, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada * Willowgrove and Rosewood, Saskatoon, Canada (Planned communities based on the urban village concept) *Parkside Village in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada *Osborne Village in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada * Canal Street and the surrounding areas that make up Manchester Gay Village, Manchester, United Kingdom *Holbeck Urban Village, Leeds, United Kingdom * Poundbury, Dorset, England * Fairford Leys, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England * Coed Darcy, Wales, United Kingdom * Greenwich Millennium Village, London, United Kingdom * Metro Walk, Richmond, California * Adamstown, Dublin, Ireland *Saifi Village in Centre Ville, Beirut, Lebanon * Franklin, Michigan, United States * Bensenville, Illinois, United States *Ballston, Clarendon, Courthouse, Crystal City, Pentagon City, Rosslyn, Shirlington and Virginia Square in Arlington, Virginia, United States *Santana Row in San Jose, California, United States *City of Phoenix Urban Villages, Phoenix, Arizona, United States *Central Village, East Village, and South Village in Sandy, Utah, United States (master-planned villages under development) *The Village, Oklahoma, a city in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area that has \\"village\\" in its name See also * Peri Urban Regions Platform Europe * New Urbanism * Transit oriented development * Urban planning * Urban sprawl * Principles of Intelligent Urbanism * Rubanisation =Suburbs classified as \\"villages\\"= *Bensenville, IL a suburb of Chicago *Franklin, MI (a suburb of Detroit) *Lathrup Village, MI (a suburb of Detroit)  References  External links * Urban Villages - an introduction * The Case for Urban Villages, Randall Fleming, 2000 * Urban Villages - the best of both worlds?, Andrew Rossiter 2001 Category:Sustainable urban planning Category:Decentralization ","title":"Urban village"},{"id":"3596536","text":"The common gamma chain (Œ≥c) (or CD132), also known as interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma or IL-2RG, is a cytokine receptor sub-unit that is common to the receptor complexes for at least six different interleukin receptors: IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and interleukin-21 receptor. The Œ≥c glycoprotein is a member of the type I cytokine receptor family expressed on most lymphocyte (white blood cell) populations, and its gene is found on the X-chromosome of mammals. This protein is located on the surface of immature blood-forming cells in bone marrow. One end of the protein resides outside the cell where it binds to cytokines and the other end of the protein resides in the interior of the cell where it transmits signals to the cell's nucleus. The common gamma chain partners with other proteins to direct blood-forming cells to form lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The receptor also directs the growth and maturation of lymphocyte subtypes: T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. These cells kill viruses, make antibodies, and help regulate the entire immune system.  Gene  Cytokine receptor common subunit gamma also known as interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma or IL-2RG is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IL2RG gene. The human IL2RG gene is located on the long (q) arm of the X chromosome at position 13.1, from base pair 70,110,279 to base pair 70,114,423. IL-7 receptor and signaling, common Œ≥ chain (blue) and IL-7 receptor-Œ± (green) Structure The Œ≥c chain is an integral membrane protein that contains extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains. Function Lymphocytes expressing the common gamma chain can form functional receptors for these cytokine proteins, which transmit signals from one cell to another and direct programs of cellular differentiation. = Ligands = The Œ≥c chain partners with other ligand-specific receptors to direct lymphocytes to respond to cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. = Signalling = IL2RG has been shown to interact with Janus kinase 3. Clinical significance = X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency = X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency is caused by mutations in the IL2RG gene. More than 200 different mutations in the IL2RG gene have been identified in people with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Most of these mutations involve changes in one or a few nucleotides (DNA building blocks) in the gene. These changes lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the common gamma chain protein or no production of protein. Without the common gamma chain, important chemical signals are not relayed to the nucleus and lymphocytes cannot develop normally. A lack of functional mature lymphocytes disrupts the immune system's ability to protect the body from infection. Sufferers have no functional immunity and can die within months after birth without successful bone marrow transplantation or alternatively, isolation from exposure to pathogens. Without important developmental signals from IL-7 and IL-15, T-cell and NK cell populations respectively fail to develop. Experiments in animal models have shown X-SCID to occur similarly in dogs, but not in mice. = Schizophrenia = Alterations in the immune response are involved in pathogenesis of many neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. Distinct gene variants of a number of pro-inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines together with their receptors associate with this disorder. IL2RG represents an important signaling component of many interleukin receptors and so far, no data on the functional state of this receptor in schizophrenia have been reported. Over-expression of the IL2RG gene may be implicated in altered immune response in schizophrenia and contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder.

The plan was put forward by Loyalist Joseph Galloway in the First Continental Congress of 1774 but was rejected. Galloway was a Pennsylvania delegate who wanted to keep the Thirteen Colonies in the British Empire.  Outline  Galloway suggested the creation of an American colonial parliament to act together with the Parliament of Great Britain. The Grand Council would have to give formal consent to the latter's decisions, particularly on trade and taxation, thus giving it a veto.R Tucker, The Fall of the British Empire (London 1982) p. 335 The Colonial Parliament would consist of a President-General appointed by the Crown and delegates appointed by the colonial assemblies for three-year terms.J Vile, The Constitutional Convention (2005) p. 301 The plan would have kept the British Empire together and allow the colonies to have some say over their own affairs, including the inflammatory issue of taxation. Galloway's plan was not accepted by the Congress. The appearance of the Suffolk Resolves at the Congress led to a polarization of discussion, with the radicals swiftly gaining the upper hand. Galloway's Plan of Union was narrowly defeated by a vote of six to five on October 22, 1774.  Galloway and Albany Plans  The proposed Galloway Plan bore striking resemblance to the Albany Plan,Union: Joseph Galloway, Plan of Union The Founders' Constitution, accessed December 11, 2009. a proposal by Galloway's fellow Pennsylvania delegate (and active correspondent) Benjamin Franklin at the Albany Congress in July 1754 to create a unified government for the Thirteen Colonies. The Albany Plan went beyond the original scope of the Albany Congress, which was to develop a plan of defense for the French and Indian War.  Aftermath  Although as a delegate to the Continental Congress Galloway was a moderate, when his Plan of Union (despite its removal of British Parliamentary sovereignty) was rejected, Galloway moved increasingly towards Loyalism. After 1778, he lived in Britain, where he acted as a leader of the Loyalist movement and an advisor to the government. Once Britain's Parliament granted American independence as part of the Peace of Paris (1783), many Loyalists went into forced exile,J Black, Crisis of Empire (New York 2008) p. 177 and Galloway permanently settled in Britain.

Harper was born at Caledonia, Ontario and worked for some time as a primary school teacher before studying at the Ontario School of Art from 1938 to 1940. During World War II he served, alongside his future wife Mary Elizabeth Goodchild, as a radar mechanic for the Royal Canadian Air Force in Canada and England. After the war, he enrolled at the University of Toronto and received a B.A. in 1948 and an M.A. in 1950 in art and archeology. In the 1950s, he became the chief cataloguer of the Royal Ontario Museum, and in 1951, he moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, to work for the New Brunswick Museum. After archaeological fieldwork for the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, he reported in 1959 on the potential for restoration of the fortress at Louisbourg, Nova Scotia. From 1959 to 1963, he was the curator of Canadian art at the National Gallery of Canada, and from 1965 to 1968 the chief curator of the McCord Museum of McGill University. From 1965 until his retirement in 1979 he lectured as a professor of art history at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec. Beginning in the 1960s, he specialized in the study of Canadian painting. His 1966 Painting in Canada: a History was the first comprehensive overview of the field. Subsequent works include the ground-breaking studies on Paul Kane (Paul Kane's Frontier, 1971) and Cornelius Krieghoff (Krieghoff, 1979). His later interests centred on Canadian folk art. Harper was a member of the board of the Journal of Canadian Art History from 1974 through 1983, and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature from the University of Guelph in 1972 and Doctor of Fine Arts from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University in 1982. Among other awards, he was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1974; and also in that year became an Officer of the Order of Canada.

In 1659 there were 12 English/Scots and 10 Roman Catholic families. There is an ancient Anglo-Norman motte just behind the village. In 1836 it was described as being without any importance and not being a post town. The inhabitants were mostly fishermen and other trades were 4 spirit dealers and grocers and one smith. It had 45 cabins, 18 of which were slated and 11 two-storey houses of stone with small windows. There were no fairs or markets held in the village. The people were described as respectable and industrious with no decided cleanliness about them or their houses. They used turf as fuel for their fires. There was a court held in the village every 9 weeks and a leet court held every year in April. There was no police constable, but there were 8 coastguard men and one chief officer. There were two corn mills here in 1836, an ancient standing stone nearby and a village graveyard. On 27 May 1848 a public works program was instigated for famine relief with the upgrading of the road from Portaferry to Ballyhalbert. There was a Coastguard Station here in 1863. In May 1917 four vessels, the Saint Mungo, Derrymore, Amber and the Morion, were captured and sunk in Ballyhalbert Bay, by U-boat UC 65 under the command of Otto Steinbrinck, one of the most famous U-boat commanders of World War I. The village played a major role during World War II when an RAF airfield, RAF Ballyhalbert, was built. It had the important role of protecting Belfast and the eastern half of Northern Ireland. During its lifetime, Ballyhalbert was home to RAF, Army, Navy and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) personnel. The airfield was sold to developers in March 1960, and is in use for a caravan park and gated community known as Ballyhalbert Park Homes. In stormy weather, although sea defences have been implemented, waves crashing against the coast leave debris on main roads. In the 21st century, a car park opposite the gospel hall has had numerous repairs to protect it from the sea. Education Victoria Primary School serves the village. Glastry College is one mile from Ballyhalbert.

Maud Allan (born as either Beulah Maude Durrant or Ulah Maud Alma Durrant; 27 August 1873 ‚Äì 7 October 1956) was a Canadian pianist-turned-actress, dancer and choreographer who is remembered for her \\"impressionistic mood settings\\". Early life Allan was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada as Beulah Maude Durrant or Ulah Maud Alma DurrantBirthname given as Ulah Maud Alma Durrant McConnell, Virginia A. Sympathy for the Devil: The Emmanuel Baptist Murders of Old San Francisco, University of Nebraska Press (January 1, 2005), page 294 to William Durrant, a shoemaker, and his wife, Isabella (n√©e Hutchenson) Durrant. The family emigrated to San Francisco, California in 1877 or 1879. She spent her early years in San Francisco, moving to Germany in 1895 to study piano at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Berlin. By the age of nineteen, she was teaching piano as a private music teacher. She would start her own Concert Agency. She later changed her name, prompted in part by the scandal surrounding the crimes committed by her brother, Theo, who was hanged in 1898 for the murder of two women in San Francisco. After her brother's execution, she abandoned piano- playing and found self-expression in dance. Stage and dance career Maud Allan as Salom√© with the head of John the Baptist in Vision of Salom√©, 1908. In 1900, in need of money, Allan is said to have illustrated an encyclopaedia for women, Illustriertes Konversations-Lexikon der Frau. Shortly thereafter, she began dancing professionally. Tall (5'7\\"), athletic, and having great imagination, she had little formal dance training. She was once compared to Isadora Duncan, which enraged her as she disliked Duncan. She designed and often sewed her own costumes, which were creative. In 1906, her production Vision of Salom√© opened in Vienna. Based loosely on Oscar Wilde's play, Salom√©, her version of the Dance of the Seven Veils became famous (and to some notorious) and she was billed as \\"The Salom√© Dancer\\". Her book, My Life and Dancing, was published in 1908. That same year she toured England, giving 250 performances in under a year. In 1910, she left Europe to travel. Over the next five years she visited the United States, Australia, Africa, and Asia. In 1915, she starred as \\"Demetra\\" in the silent film, The Rug Maker's Daughter.McConnell, Virginia A. Sympathy for the Devil: The Emmanuel Baptist Murders of Old San Francisco, University of Nebraska Press (January 1, 2005), page 294 Libel suit and later years In 1918, British MP Noel Pemberton Billing, in his own journal, Vigilante, published an article, \\"The Cult of the Clitoris\\", which implied that Allan, then appearing in her Vision of Salome, was a lesbian associate of German wartime conspirators. Allan sued Billing for libel, based on the following counts: * The act of publishing a defamatory article about Maud Allan and J. T. Grein, her impresario. * The act, a separate offence, of including obscenities within the article. This led to a sensational court case, at which Billing represented himself. Lord Alfred Douglas also testified in Billing's favour. Allan lost the case. The trial became entangled in obscenity charges brought forth by the state against the performance given by Allan in her dance. She was accused of practising many of the sexually charged acts depicted (or implied) in Wilde's writings herself, including necrophilia. The Lord Chamberlain's ban on public performances of Wilde's play was still in place in England and the Salom√© dance was at risk. Her brother's crimes were also cited to suggest there was a background of sexual insanity in her family. As suffragette A suffragette supporter, Allan's name was given (as an alias) on arrest by a suffragette arrested near Stirling, Scotland for an attack on Prime Minister Asquith. Later years From the 1920s, Allan taught dance and lived with her secretary and lover, Verna Aldrich. She eventually settled in the Los Angeles during World War II and worked as a draughtswoman at Macdonald Aircraft. Allan died in Los Angeles in 1956, aged 83. Fiction and theatre Allan's Salom√© dance, the reactions to it and its significance in terms of the sexual, social and political mores of the time appear in Pat Barker's 1993 novel, The Eye in the Door, the second part of the Regeneration trilogy. Allan's libel suit was the subject of a \\"fictography\\", The Maud Allan Affair (written by Russell James) as well as a stage play, Salomania (by Mark Jackson). Salomania premiered at Berkeley, California's Aurora Theatre in June 2012.

The term also applied as the rank title of the field officer that was in charge of a captaincy (group of companies) of the Ordenan√ßas, the Portuguese territorial militia that existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Captaincy system Due to the impossibility of exercising direct control and sovereignty over overseas territories, the captain-major was the channel by which the monarch could delegate his powers, with certain restrictions, under the responsibility of peoples he felt he could confide. The Donat√°rio could administer, in the sovereign's name, the lands for which he was assigned, with all the regalia, rights and obligations, with the exception of certain limits, including military authority over soldiers and detachments of the crown, or the administration of justice. The Captains were agents named by the Dont√°rio, and after 1495, by the Crown, to a lifetime title that was passed down by the \\"legitimate male heirs\\".Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.236 As administrators, the Captains enjoyed various judicial and economic privileges that provided an incentive to settle and develop their captaincies. They had the authority to administer sentences, with the exception of those involving penalties of death or mutilation. Economically, they had the exclusive authority to mill, bake bread and sell salt, in addition to their entitlement to receive rent paid to the King for lands, fees and taxes due. In addition, they could receive a tithe (the tenth portion) paid to the captaincy directly. In addition to the regalia of office, the captains-major would hold title to the best parcels of lands and be able to contract renters to the donat√°rias (lands of the Donat√°rios), in the name of the crown. Many of the donat√°rios were hereditary, with a few exceptions, referred in the Salic Laws () of the time; these laws regulated all aspects of life, including crime, taxation, indemnity, and female inheritance. The Captains were less restricted to these conditions. Yet, many of these captains were selected as part of a consolidation of relationships between the Donat√°rios and their vassals. This subjective process usually involved close associations with the royal family or confidants of the Crown: a feudal meritocracy of vassals. This could result from rendering service during the overseas expansion or resulting from some heroism which may have been rewarded with a title.Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.237 The monarch surrounded himself with \\"trustworthy\\" men who were existed within a web of relationships, forming a restricted circle of individuals. In some cases precedents were superseded in favour of people they could trust, including setting aside the laws of male inheritance in favour of a daughter, for example (as with the case of the daughter of J√°come de Bruges). Yet, most had to prove themselves, as was the case with √Ålvaro de Ornelas (captain of Pico), who lost his captaincy due to \\"inefficiency\\" in its settlement. The captaincy system was built on confidence and good faith between the captain and donat√°rio, owing to the distance between each.Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.238 This weakened the Donat√°rio's control over the officials, resulting in a disparity between actual and perceived function. Some were either incompetent in their roles, power-hungry or just absent. In some cases the inhabitants of certain possessions were often subject to irregularities resulting from judicial or fiscal issues. Some captains appointed overseers, ouvidores (auditors) to represent them who were unqualified to respond to the issues of their masters. Captaincies The following is an incomplete list of some of the captaincies and their first Donatary-Captains: =Madeira= Medieval map showing the Atlantic frontier and settlements along the sea (Petrus Roselli) Biblioth√®que nationale de France There were three captaincies in the archipelago of Madeira, associated with the three principal discoverers of the islands: * Funchal, was bestowed to Capit√£o Donat√°rio Jo√£o Gon√ßalves Zarco * Machico, was bestowed to Capit√£o Donat√°rio Trist√£o Vaz Teixeira * Porto Santo, was appointed to Capit√£o Donat√°rio Bartolomeu Perestrello =Azores= The Lazaro Lu√≠s map of the Atlantic (1563) showing the Azores and Madeira Following their discovery, Gon√ßalo Velho Cabral became the first Donatary-Captain of the islands, beginning with the island of Santa Maria, but later including the island of S√£o Miguel when it was discovered. This captaincy, which lasted from 1439 to 1461, was described in 1460 by Henry the Navigator in a letter to Cabral as Capit√£o por mim em minhas ilhas de Santa Maria e S√£o Miguel dos A√ßores (Captain for Me in My Islands of Santa Maria and S√£o Miguel in the Azores). The progressive discovery of the islands of the archipelago resulted in new captaincies; in total, there have been thirteen unique captaincies in Azores since their discovery: * Santa Maria, part of the captaincy of Gon√ßalo Velho Cabral, Santa Maria and S√£o Miguel, was later divided by his nephew Jo√£o Soares de Albergaria, and Santa Maria left in the hands of his descendants; * S√£o Miguel, part of the captaincy of Gon√ßalo Velho Cabral was sold by Jo√£o Soares de Albergaria to its third Captain Donat√°rio Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara; * Angra, originally a single administration under the captaincy of J√°come de Bruges, the southern portion of Terceira was carved out and allocated to Jo√£o Vaz Corte-Real; * Praia, quarrelling between Jo√£o Vaz Corte-Real and √Ålvaro Martins Homem after the mysterious \\"disappearance\\" of J√°come de Bruge, resulted in the latter receiving Praia; * Praia da Graciosa, initially allocated to Duarte Barreto do Couto at the time of its early settlement, his mysterious disappearance left it in the caretaker-ship of his wife, until her brother Vasco Gil Sodr√© came to assist her in guaranteeing it within her family; * Santa Cruz, Pedro Correio da Cunha (brother-in-law of Christopher Columbus), who arrived on the island from Porto Santo, obtained the captaincy in 1474, after the mysterious disappearance of Duarte Barreto do Couto; * Graciosa, Vasco Gil Sodr√© attempted to obtain the captaincy of Graciosa following a Castilian incursion in 1475. but using the same logic, the crown decided to unify the island under one captain: Pedro Correio do Couto. * S√£o Jorge, originally bestowed to Jo√£o Vaz Corte-Real, the island was a fiefdom of Terceira, until re-incorporated by the Crown, after Manuel de Moura Corte- Real, donatary captain of Angra, decided to maintain his allegiance to Philip III; * Faial, the island was placed under the administration of Josse van Huerter, even after he failed on his first attempt to settle the island. This would be a discrepancy, since his second attempt at settling and developing the territory resulted in greater expansion; * Pico, √Ålvaro de Ornelas attempted to settle the island from 1460, bringing colonists from northern Portugal, who arrived by way of Terceira and Graciosa, but his attempt was slow and resulted in failure; * Faial and Pico, the island of Pico was incorporated into the Faialense administration of the Huerter/Dutra family on 29 December 1482, following the inefficient failure of √Ålvaro de Ornelas to spearhead and expand settlements; * Flores and Corvo, developed without any clear statue and late in its settlement, the dual island fiefdom functioned within a feudal hierarchy, following its settlement by Diogo de Teive. =Africa= A map of Africa by the Italian cartographer, engineer, and astronomer Giacomo Gastaldi (c.1500‚Äì66) * Portuguese Guinea, before it was united in 1879 under that name with its own Governor, and separated from Portuguese Cape Verde, remaining Portuguese till 1974: **Bissau, 1687‚Äì1879;

It has broad efficacy against various insects and ticks and is almost colorless and odorless. The name picaridin was proposed as an International Nonproprietary Name (INN) to the World Health Organization (WHO), but the official name that has been approved by the WHO is icaridin. The chemical is part of the piperidine family, along with many pharmaceuticals and alkaloids such as piperine, which gives black pepper its spicy taste. Trade names include Bayrepel and Saltidin among others. The compound was developed by the German chemical company Bayer and was given the name Bayrepel. In 2005, Lanxess AG and its subsidiary Saltigo GmbH were spun off from Bayer and the product was renamed Saltidin in 2008.Saltigo renames insect repellant, Chemical & Engineering News As of 23 July 2020, icaridin was approved by the EU Commission for use in repellent products.

Larval salamander toxicity  A 2018 study found that a commercial repellent product containing 20% icaridin, in what the authors described as \\"conservative exposure doses\\", is highly toxic to salamander larvae. Since only the icaridin content of the tested repellent product is known, the observed effects cannot be readily attributed to icaridin. Furthermore, the effects of the repellent product showed no dose- response relationship, i.e., there was neither an increase of the magnitude or severity of the observed effects (mortality, tail deformation), nor did the effects occur at earlier time points. The study has been regarded as invalid by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, which has evaluated icaridin prior to its approval under the EU Biocidal Product Regulation. The reasons for rejection were the testing of a mixture of undisclosed composition, the use of a non-standard test organism, the lack of analytical verification of actual test concentrations, and the fact that the test solution was never renewed with the 25 days of study duration. The study observed high larval salamander mortality occurring delayed after the four days of exposure. Because the widely used LC50 test for assessing a chemical's environmental toxicity is based on mortality within four days, the authors suggested that icaridin would be incorrectly deemed as \\"safe\\" under the test protocol. However, icaridin was also non-toxic in a 21-day reproduction test on the water flea Daphnia magna and a 32-day early life-stage test in zebrafish.  Chemistry  Stereoisomers of icaridin Icaridin contains two stereocenters: one where the hydroxyethyl chain attaches to the ring, and one where the sec- butyl attaches to the oxygen of the carbamate. The commercial material contains a mixture of all four stereoisomers. Commercial products Commercial products containing icaridin include Cutter Advanced, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus, Autan, Smidge, PiActive and MOK.O.Cha, Ariana Eunjung. \\"Zika virus FAQ: What is it, and what are the risks as it spreads? The Washington Post. January 21, 2016. Mechanism A potential odorant receptor for Œôcaridin (and DEET), the CquiOR136‚Ä¢CquiOrco, has been suggested recently for Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito. Recent crystal and solution studies showed that Icaridin binds to Anopheles gambiae odorant binding protein 1 (AgamOBP1). The crystal structure of AgamOBP1‚Ä¢Icaridin complex (PDB: 5EL2) revealed that Icaridin binds to the DEET-binding site in two distinct orientations and also to a second binding site (sIC-binding site) located at the C-terminal region of the AgamOBP1. Recent evidence with Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes suggests icaridin does not strongly activate olfactory receptors neurons, but instead functions to reduce the volatility of the odorants to which it is mixed. By reducing odor volatility, icaridin functions to \\"mask\\" the ability of volatile odorants on the skin to activate olfactory neurons and attract mosquitoes.

Heidelberg, UB, cpg 374, 1r. Diu Cr√¥ne () is a Middle High German poem of about 30,000 lines treating of King Arthur and the Matter of Britain, dating from around the 1220s and attributed to the epic poet Heinrich von dem T√ºrlin. Little is known of the author though it has been suggested that he was from the town of Sankt Veit an der Glan, then the residence of the Sponheim dukes of Carinthia. Diu Cr√¥ne tells also of the Knights of the Round Table's quest for the Grail but differs from the better- known \\"Percival\\" and \\"Galahad\\" versions of the narrative in that it is here Gawain who achieves the sacred object; it is the only work in the Arthurian corpus in which he does so. The 'crown' of the title is, in fact, the poem itself: Heinrich likens his work to a gem-set diadem - the 'gems' being the various Arthurian tales or episodes that he has 'set' in the gold of his verse; his avowed object in this endeavour being the delectation of ladies everywhere - the which accords well with the reputation of his chosen hero, Gawain as a ladies' man. John Matthews has characterized the poem as an overly wordy and occasionally ill-written work, containing a curious miscellany of stories drawn from all over the Arthurian mythos. He further points out that among these stories are some which are of a markedly archaic character, harking back to the knight's putative origin in the figure of the Irish hero C√∫ Chulainn, particularly in regard to that hero's testing by the sorcerous Cu Roi mac Daire and his (Cu Roi's) wife Blathnat. The character in Diu Cr√¥ne corresponding to Cu Roi (and thus also to the Green Knight of later tradition) is the 'learned clerk' Gansguoter, likewise a magician and shape-shifter. Noteworthy among these archaic episodes is that (lines 12611-13934) concerning the contention between two sisters for the bridle that confers mastery of a magic mule with the power to transport its rider in safety through terrors to an otherworldly, revolving castle adorned with severed human heads (Celts 6.1 and Headhunting 3.1). This is also to be found in more condensed and cryptic form in the short poem La Mule sans frein by Paien de Maisieres (Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle 7.3). Both versions appear to derive, in part, from the Uath mac Imoman episode in the 9th-century Irish legend of Fled Bricrenn (Bricriu's Feast). Scholarly editions of the poem were made in 1852 by Gottlob Heinrich Friedrich Scholl (1802-1870) and (in translation as The Crown) in 1989 by J.W. Thomas, a professor emeritus of German at the University of Kentucky. Manuscripts *Cologne, Universit√§ts- und Stadtbibliothek, Cod. 5 P 62 *Heidelberg, Universit√§tsbibliothek, Cod.

He has written a book and presented television programs on Aristotle's biology. Early life and education A Dutch citizen, Leroi was born in Wellington, New Zealand. His youth was spent in New Zealand, South Africa and Canada. He was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree by Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada in 1989, and a Ph.D. by the University of California, Irvine in 1993. This was followed by postdoctoral work at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York City using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as an experimental organism. Career In 2001, he was appointed lecturer at Imperial College, London. He has written several books, including Mutants: On Genetic Variety and the Human Body for which he was awarded the Guardian First Book Award in 2004. In 2004 he adapted his book into a television documentary series for Britain's Channel 4 entitled Human Mutants. Leroi has presented two other TV documentary series for Channel 4: \\"Alien Worlds\\" in 2005, and \\"What Makes Us Human\\" in 2006. Despite his TV appearances, Leroi has expressed scepticism about the truthfulness of television creatives. In an email exchange with TV director Martin Durkin, concerning the latter's documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle, Leroi wrote: \\"left to their own devices, TV producers simply cannot be trusted to tell the truth\\". He is also known as one of the first testers of the beneficial acclimation hypothesis. In 2005, Leroi published an article in The New York Times entitled \\"A Family Tree in Every Gene\\",The New York Times, retrieved 2009-09-30 which argued for the usefulness of racial types in medical genetics. It was found during the making of \\"What Makes Us Human\\" that his ASPM gene locus is heterozygous. That is to say, he has one copy of the recent variant and one copy of the old ASPM allele. In January 2009 Leroi presented the BBC4 documentary What Darwin Didn't Know, which charts the progress in the field of Evolutionary Theory since the original publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859. In January 2010 Leroi presented the BBC4 documentary Aristotle's Lagoon, filmed on the Greek island of Lesbos and suggesting that Aristotle was the world's first biologist. In 2012 he collaborated on the DarwinTunes evolutionary music project, using natural selection to create music and in 2016 presented The Secret Science of Pop on BBC4.

Born in Schiedam, he was best known for his drawings of animals and for \\"Gnomes\\" in the famous series of books provided with text by Wil Huygen and published by Harry N. Abrams, Inc. of New York City. Being a plasterer's son from Schiedam, making a living as an artist did not seem an option for Rien Poortvliet. His parents were strict followers of the Dutch Reformed Church and were opposed to the idea of their oldest son going to an art academy. Rien's aptitude for drawing showed early on. After primary education the young Rien worked at an ad agency, where he could make some use of his talent. He also had talent for the advertising profession because after he had completed his draft time in the Navy he rose to senior manager at Lintas, Unilever's ad agency. Rien took more pleasure in the work he did on the side for several publishers. He illustrated various books, among them works by Jaap ter Haar, and Godfried Bomans. He was also a passionate hunter, which led him to drawing various nature subjects. By the end of the 1960s, Poortvliet was able to make a living as an independent illustrator. To supplement his income, he made a book out of his drawings and watercolours based on his hunting experiences. Later on, he also made a similar work concerning the life of Jesus Christ. Poortvliet saw himself as a storyteller in drawings. His drawings told the tale, and at most he added a short caption. For years his works were published by Van Holkema en Warendorf in Bussum, where his \\"Leven en werken van de Kabouter\\" (co-authored by Wil Huygen, English title is \\"Gnomes\\") saw an astonishing 59 printings. With the Gnomes series Poortvliet acquired international fame. This series took on a life of its own, and was turned into an animated series in 1985. His books were translated into English, French, German, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Italian and other languages. Fame and recognition The general public was delighted with Poortvliet's drawings. Some critics thought Poortvliet hypocritical since he painted beautiful nature scenes while being a fervent hunter. Yet he was elated to be the centre of attention. He did well on television with his goatee, his corduroy trousers and his chequered jackets. For a few years, Poortvliet was a panel member in \\"Zo Vader, Zo Zoon\\" (a Dutch game show). Poortvliet found recognition when Prince Bernhard opened the Rien Poortvliet Museum in 1992. This museum stood in the old, historic Town Hall of Middelharnis, \\"Fortunately far away from the modern art gang in Amsterdam\\" as Poortvliet said in an interview. The Rien Poortvliet Museum in Middelharnis has now closed its doors to the public (December 16, 2006). Because of sharply reduced visitor numbers the museum could no longer meet its financial obligations. It reopened on the island of Tiengemeten on 7 July 2009.

Until 2003, it was also a major manufacturer of brass, string and woodwind musical instruments. Formed in 1930 through the merger of two well-established British music businesses, the company controls the copyrights to much major 20th-century music, including works by Leonard Bernstein, Benjamin Britten, Aaron Copland, Sergei Prokofiev, and Igor Stravinsky. It also publishes many prominent contemporary composers, including John Adams, Karl Jenkins, James MacMillan, Mark-Anthony Turnage, and Steve Reich. With subsidiaries in Berlin and New York, the company also sells sheet music via its online shop. History =Before the merger of the Boosey and Hawkes companies= Boosey & Hawkes was founded in 1930 through the merger of two respected music companies, Boosey & Company and Hawkes & Son. The Boosey family was of Franco‚ÄìFlemish origin. Boosey & Company traces its roots back to John Boosey, a bookseller in London in the 1760s‚Äì1770s. His son Thomas continued the business at 4 Old Bond Street,The shop moved to 28 Holles Street in 1816: and from 1819 the bookshop was called Boosey & Sons or T. & T. Boosey. A drawing of a euphonium manufactured by Boosey & Co. in 1878 Thomas Boosey's son, also named Thomas (1794/1795‚Äì1871), set up a separate musical branch of the company known as T. Boosey & Co. and, in the latter part of the 19th century, Boosey & Company. This branch initially imported foreign music but soon began publishing in England the works of composers such as Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Saverio Mercadante, Ferdinand Ries and Gioachino Rossini, and subsequently important operas by Bellini, Donizetti and Verdi. Elgar and Vaughan Williams were among its later signings. The company also produced books: among its first publications was an English translation of Johann Nikolaus Forkel's book Life of J.S. Bach (1820). This was a translation from the German of The company was seriously affected by the House of Lords' decision in Boosey v. Jeffreys (1854) which deprived English publishers of many of their foreign copyrights. Boosey & Company diversified into manufacturing woodwind instruments in 1851, collaborating in 1856 with flautist R.S. Pratten (1846‚Äì1936) to develop new designs for flutes. The firm bought over the business of Henry Distin in 1868, allowing it to begin making brass instruments. Among its achievements was the widely acclaimed design for compensating valves developed by David James Blaikley in 1874. The company also commenced production of string instruments. The company capitalised on the increasing popularity of the ballad by focusing its publishing activities on them. To promote sales, John Boosey (c.1832‚Äì1893), son of Thomas Jr., established the London Ballad Concerts in 1867 at St. James's Hall and later at Queen's Hall when it opened in 1893. Clara Butt, John Sims Reeves and Charles W. Clark performed at these concerts, and its successes included Arthur Sullivan's \\"The Lost Chord\\" (1877) and Stephen Adams' \\"The Holy City\\". The company began emphasising educational music from about the end of the 19th century. In 1874 Boosey & Company moved into offices at 295 Regent Street, where the business was to stay for the next 131 years. In 1892, Boosey & Company opened an office in New York which still exists today. The business eventually owned half of Regent Street, and at the time of the merger was managed by Leslie Boosey (1887‚Äì1979). Hawkes & Son (later Rivi√®re & Hawkes), a rival to Boosey & Company, was founded in 1865 by William Henry Hawkes selling orchestral sheet music. The company also made musical instruments and spare parts such as clarinet reeds, and by 1925 Hawkes had set up an instrument factory in Edgware, North London. The business, which was particularly known for brass and military band music, was eventually inherited by Ralph Hawkes (1898‚Äì1950). =After the merger= Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes met in the 1920s when they were on the Board of the Performing Right Society, and saw an opportunity to go into business together. They formed Boosey & Hawkes in October 1930 through a merger of their respective businesses. Hawkes & Son moved from its office in Denman Street to join the Boosey staff at 295 Regent Street. Russian composer Igor Stravinsky (1882‚Äì1971), one of the famous composers signed by Boosey & Hawkes. The 1938 Anschluss‚Äîthe annexation of Austria into Greater Germany by the Nazi regime‚Äîled to the Nazification of Viennese publishing house Universal Edition. Boosey & Hawkes seized the opportunity to sign up composers B√©la Bart√≥k and Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, and also rescued Universal's Jewish staff, who later played an important role in developing the company. One such employee in particular, Ernst Roth, facilitated the signing of Richard Strauss and Igor Stravinsky, and was instrumental in the production of Strauss's Vier letzte Lieder (Four Last Songs) (1948; premi√®red 1950) and Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress (premi√®red 1951). Another significant figure from Vienna who occupied an editorial role was composer Arnold Schoenberg's pupil Erwin Stein, and after the war the composer Leopold Spinner, a pupil of Anton Webern, was also on the editorial staff. Stein was instrumental in founding the modern-music journal Tempo in 1939, which began as Boosey & Hawkes' own newsletter but later became a more independent publication. By the time World War II broke out in 1939, Boosey & Hawkes had also signed Benjamin Britten and Aaron Copland. It was Ralph Hawkes who championed Britten when he was still relatively unknown, often against the rest of the board of directors, until the premi√®re on 7 June 1945 of Peter Grimes, which was a critical and popular success. Sheet music sales soared during the War, enabling Boosey & Hawkes to buy Editions Russes which held the rights to the most valuable works of Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky. The company also purchased the lease of the Royal Opera House in London in 1944, rescuing it from becoming a permanent dance hall and providing a venue for world-class ballet and opera in the capital. An illustration of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, by Thomas H. Shepherd, published in 1827‚Äì28. It became known as the Royal Opera House in 1892. By 1950, Boosey & Hawkes was a leading international music company with an extensive catalogue of serious composers and offices in Bonn, Johannesburg, New York, Paris, Toronto and Sydney. However, from the late 1940s, strains had begun to appear in the relationship between Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes, and this led to factions supporting each man forming in the company. It was discovered that Hawkes had borrowed capital of ¬£100,000 during the war without the permission of the exchange control authorities, and Boosey was forced to clear up the situation at great personal cost. Hawkes secretly wanted to buy out the music publishing side of the business and manage it from New York, leaving Boosey in London with the musical instrument business which Hawkes found dull. However, he died suddenly on 8 September 1950, and representation of his faction was taken over by his flamboyant but unreliable brother Geoffrey who spent much of the company's money on ventures such as the manufacture of mouth organs and ovens, which failed. Geoffrey Hawkes also sold shares in the company to fund his philandering, to the point that the company was forced to go public to raise cash. Leslie Boosey allowed Geoffrey his turn as chairman, but within two years the profitable company was on the brink of insolvency and Geoffrey Hawkes died of leukaemia in 1961. The distinctive brown cover of a Hawkes Pocket Score: Dmitri Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1 (Op. 77; sometimes numbered Op. 99). During these difficult years, Boosey was supported by his trusted managing director, Ernst Roth. However, Roth later regarded the Boosey family as ineffectual and parochial. In the early 1960s, Roth forced Boosey's sons Anthony and Simon out of the company, and prevented his youngest son, Nigel, from even joining, allegedly at the behest of Benjamin Britten. Roth and Boosey also had differences over Britten's influence over the company. Roth regarded Britten as a gifted local musician, rather than a true genius like Roth's friends Strauss and Stravinsky. Boosey realised how valuable Britten was to the company, and agreed to Britten's request to divide the company into instruments and publishing. However, Britten humiliated Boosey by preventing him from chairing the music publishing board Boosey had established at Britten's request. In 1963, Britten also managed to get Boosey & Hawkes to employ Donald Mitchell to find new, young composers for the company. Angered by the sway Britten had over Boosey, Roth fired Mitchell within a year. Mitchell later set up Faber Music for book publisher Faber and Faber with the assistance of Britten and the blessing of T. S. Eliot. Boosey retired from the company in 1964, and died without an obituary in 1979. Although he had been awarded with the L√©gion d'honneur by France, his achievements were mostly unrecognised in the UK. However, a large number of composers and their estates continue to benefit from his pioneering work in rights and royalty collection. In addition, every two years the Royal Philharmonic Society and the Performing Right Society honour individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the furtherance of contemporary music in Britain with the Leslie Boosey Award. The award is given to those who work \\"backstage\\", such as administrators, broadcasters, educationalists, programmers, publishers and representatives from the recording industry. Some time during the late 1960s or early 1970s Boosey & Hawkes bought out The Salvation Army Brass Instrument Factory in North London. They continued for some years to manufacture instruments with The Salvation Army name and crest on them such as The Bandmaster cornets.Army Instrument Making - A Short History by William H. Scarlett, 25 June 2011, at sahpa.blogspot.co.uk Accessed 4 March 2017 Boosey & Hawkes' musical instruments division was gradually scaled down from the mid-1970s as it became less viable to have such an extensive range of products. Various lines were outsourced and sold off. By the time of the closure of the Edgware factory in 2001, brass instruments were the only thriving part of the instrument range. Production was moved to Watford, Hertfordshire, and the instruments rebranded Besson. It took nearly 20 years for Boosey & Hawkes to regain the leading position in the international music scene that it has today. It claims to be the largest specialist classical music publisher in the world. The company today In 2001, Boosey & Hawkes was put up for sale after accounting irregularities were discovered in its Chicago instrument-distribution business, leading to ¬£13m worth of sales being written off, a plummeting share price, and the company's near-bankruptcy. It was eventually bought by venture capitalists HgCapital in 2003 for ¬£40 million. On 11 February 2003, Boosey & Hawkes sold its musical instrument division, which included clarinet maker Buffet Crampon and guitar manufacturer H√∂fner, to The Music Group, a company formed by rescue buyout specialists Rutland Fund Management, for ¬£33.2 million. An archive of musical instruments manufactured or collected by the company throughout its history was passed to the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill, South London.

In September 2005 the company was again offered for sale by HgCapital which announced that it was seeking between ¬£60 and ¬£80 million. One of the interested buyers was Elevation Partners, a private equity firm which counts U2 lead singer Bono as a partner and managing director. Despite offers of about ¬£115 million from a number of parties, the sale was later cancelled in November 2005. In April 2008, Boosey & Hawkes was bought by the Dutch owned Imagem which was subsequently itself acquired by the American based Concord. Concord later purchased Hans Sikorski in 2019, adding the German classical publisher to sit alongside Boosey & Hawkes. Today, partly due to the foresight or business acumen of Ralph Hawkes, the company controls the copyrights in major 20th- century music. It also publishes many prominent contemporary composers and the company's New York branch has developed its own catalogue emphasising the works of American composers. 295 Regent Street, which was the home of Boosey & Company since 1874 and of Boosey & Hawkes' publishing business and music shop from 1930, was finally given up by the company in 2005 which then relocated to Aldwych House. Boosey & Hawkes Music Shop claims to have the UK's largest selection of printed music from all publishers, and operates a worldwide mail order service. The company had a major division, BooseyMedia, that commissioned and produced music for radio, television and advertising jingles, and the administration of copyrights owned by media companies. This was split into commercial synchronisation and production music departments, both under the Imagem name. The production library was sold in 2016. In North America, Boosey & Hawkes' print sales catalogue is distributed by the Hal Leonard Corporation. Boosey & Hawkes launched its Online Scores service in 2011, allowing customers to view full scores of works in its catalogue. In January 2017, British Library acquired the archive of Boosey & Hawkes Parodies The company was lampooned by The Goon Show as \\"Goosy and Borks\\" in their episode, \\"Lurgy Strikes Britain\\", as well as by musical parodist Peter Schickele who named one of the friends of fictional composer P.D.Q.

Many regard the film as Mizoguchi's greatest pre-war achievement, praising its long takes and mise-en-sc√®ne composition. Plot The film is set in Japan in 1885, alternating largely between Tokyo and Osaka. Kikunosuke Onoe, generally called Kiku, played (in his movie debut) by the stage actor Shotaro Hanayagi, is the adopted son of a famous Kabuki actor, who is training to succeed his father in an illustrious career. Whilst hypocritically praising Onoe's acting to his face, the rest of his father's troupe deride him behind his back. Otoku (Kakuko Mori), who lives at the father's house as the young wet-nurse of the infant son of the father's natural son, is the only one frank enough to disclose his artistic shortcomings and urge him to improve himself. When Otoku is dismissed by Kiku's family for her over-closeness to the young master, with the potential for scandal, Kiku tracks her down and states that he wishes to marry her. His family is outraged and Kiku is forced to leave Tokyo, taking the train to Nagoya, honing his art away from his father, much to the latter's wrath. One year later, Kiku is acting alongside his uncle, Tamiro Naritaya in Osaka, but remains dissatisfied and wishes to join a traveling troupe. Then Otoku tracks down Kiku and re-inspires him. She becomes his common law wife and continues to encourage him. When his uncle dies, four years later, he decides to join a travelling troupe and their times together become even harder. A further four years pass and we see Kiku and Otoku on the road, their fellow actors squabbling over small amounts of money. Kiku has changed in character to the point where he even strikes her. She still loves him, but his love has clearly faded. Their position worsens and Otoku becomes very sick. Otoku goes to meet Kiku's brother to beg that he be given an acting role in Tokyo, re-using the famous family name. He agrees that Kiku can play the part he was due to play on two conditions: one, that his acting has improved; two, that he and Otoku separate, as this is needed to reconcile with their father. Fuku returns with Otoku to fetch Kiku. We then see Kiku on-stage giving a bravura performance of Sumizome, a difficult and critical female role. He has at last found his niche and the fame he had always sought as a Kabuki actor. Otoku watches sadly from the wings, but she is happy for him. The family agree that Kiku may perform in Tokyo. As Kiku boards the train to Tokyo Otoku cannot be found, and Fuku hands him a letter from her, explaining everything. His companions explain that paradoxically he must continue to Tokyo in order to make Otoku's sacrifice worthwhile. He is a success. The Tokyo troupe visit Osaka and have a triumphant welcome. Kiku's father says that Kiku may take pride of place in the river parade after the performance. The landlord comes and tells Kiku that Otoku is ill and will die that night. Kiku hesitates as it is his evening of glory, but his father forces him, saying how much Otoku helped him. Ultimately Kiku's father accepts Kiku's marriage to Otoku and Kiku tells her this, but this reconciliation comes only when she is already on her deathbed (due, by implication, to tuberculosis). Proud that he is at last happy, she ushers him to join the river parade because the audience is waiting to see and praise him. She dies, while the theater's parade led by her husband can be heard in the distance.

In 1939 he was appointed a National Film consultant in Japan and sent to Manchuria with five other film directors. He also left Toho for Shochiku Studios after several years of success at Toho. The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums is his first film in a trilogy about theater in the Meiji period.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987, p. 792. It was very successful in Japan and won 2nd place of Kinema Jumpo's list of best films. Mizoguchi also won an Education Ministry Award for the film.Wakeman. p. 793. Style Mizoguchi used many long takes in the film, often lasting up to six minutes. He also used many dolly shots for dramatic effects and in order to enhance the emotional state of the characters. He utilized both the foreground and the background in many shots. Derek Malcolm said that \\"If Mizoguchi was the poet of women, he was also the poet of houses, rooms, landscape and urban vistas. His period detail and sumptuous camera style lent his stories a fantastic naturalism, heightened by an almost musical editing style.\\" Legacy Jonathan Rosenbaum called it Mizoguchi's greatest film and praised his \\"refusal to use close-ups‚Ä¶the theme of female sacrifice that informs most of his major works is given a singular resonance and complexity here.\\" Derek Adams of Time Out called it \\"a heartbreaker to end them all\\" and praised its cinematography. Richard Brody called it \\"one of the cinema‚Äôs great outpourings of imaginative energy.\\" Noel Burch called it \\"one of his most deeply ‚Äòfeminist‚Äô films\\"Wakeman. p. 792. and Tony Rayns called it \\"the peak of Mizoguchi's art.\\" John Pym praised the film's sets, saying that they were \\"crammed with human detail\\" and that when they were \\"sometimes offset by shots of notably uncluttered spaces, [it] is to highlight the isolation of the two principles in a teeming world dominated by class prejudice, harsh economics, and sheer blank human indifference.\\" The film was selected to be screened in the Cannes Classics section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.

Some collectors collect all brands. In 1946 Talley Nichols and Lewis W. Nichols started a cap gun company in Pasadena, Texas, which eventually became one of the world's largest cap gun manufacturing companies. History World War II had just ended, and they wanted to manufacture something. After several ideas they decided to make toys, specifically toy cap guns. The primary choice was a cap pistol that resembled a 19th-century version of the famous Colt Peacemaker in some way, as that was an extremely popular revolver. Their first gun, the Silver Pony, was made and orders were brisk. The success of this initial offering led to the Mustang (later called the Silver Mustang) and the Silver Colt. But these were somewhat ordinary cap guns and being small they ventured out and created a large cap gun called the Stallion 45. In 1950 the Stallion 45 was introduced at the New York Toy Fair and became a sensation. It was declared the \\"Toy of the Year.\\" Besides its large size, which was essentially the same size as its namesake, it featured individual 2-piece bullets, which would hold a single cap and when the gun was fired, the cylinder revolved, the bullet fired, and smoke came out of the end of the barrel. One of the features of the Stallion series was that all sparking from the caps was contained within the bullet, thus eliminating the objection from some states that the sparks might harm children's eyes. In those states, there were \\"dummy\\" guns sold which could not fire a cap. The success of this gun was overwhelming and thus a dynasty of smaller and different versions of Stallions were also created: the Stallion 38, Stallion 32, Stallion 22, Stallion .41-40 and Stallion Model 61. Though the Stallion 300 Saddle Gun also had the name Stallion, it was a rifle that looked like a .30-30 Winchester. In 1954 the company moved to Jacksonville, Texas and officially opened in 1955. The entire county basically turned out for the gala event and their manufacturing capabilities were greatly expanded. Many new models were created with several variations of each. In 1957 the Stallion 45 MK-II was created, which many cap gun collectors have declared to be the \\"King of the Die-Cast Cap Guns.\\" The magazine, American Rifleman even ran a featured article on cap guns and featured this gun. The Nichols cap pistols featured a revolving cylinder that advanced when the trigger was pulled. The company also offered a repair service where a gun could be mailed to the factory and repaired for a very small fraction of the original price. By 1962 the matinee idols like Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, The Lone Ranger, Hopalong Cassidy and many others were gradually making fewer movies and television shows, and children's interest in cap guns began waning. Nichols Industries sold out to Kusan in 1965 which continued many of the cap gun models. Eventually cap guns began to fade from the scene and even Kusan and many other famous companies like George Schmidt, Kilgore, Hubley, Mattel, Esquire, Wyandotte, Stevens, etc., were forced to cut back or sell out completely. Thus ended the \\"Glory Days\\" of the cap guns. Now cap guns are collectibles and are highly valued in auctions like EBay and flea markets and private sales. The prices are quite high compared to the original guns and full sets of guns and holsters and other memorabilia of the period-especially the boxes are considered great prizes. Many people are \\"exclusive\\" collectors and only collect Nichols cap guns or other individual brands. With the new restrictions on cap guns, it is becoming more difficult to collect historical toys like this and thus preserve our heritage. These days, cap guns are required by law to either be a different color or have an orange plug in the ends of their barrels, so that law enforcement officers can tell the difference. Toy guns manufactured prior to 1988 are not required to have this feature. By 1988, most of the famous toy cap gun companies had already gone out of business, Nichols Industries being one of them.

It was the fourth published of the seven Chrestomanci books (1977 to 2006). When the first four books were reissued in the UK to accompany the fifth as a matching set (2000), this one was subtitled The Childhood of Chrestomanci and cover illustrations by Paul Slater branded them all The Worlds of Chrestomanci.Chrestomanci series at ISFDB. The \\"Chrestomanci\\" books are collectively named after a powerful enchanter and British government official in a world parallel to ours, who supervises the use of magic ‚Äîor the Chrestomanci, an office that requires a powerful enchanter and is responsible for supervising. The Lives is set perhaps three decades ago in a world quite different from ours, during the adolescence of Christopher Chant who is Chrestomanci in five of the books. Fictional background \\"The Worlds of Chrestomanci\\" brand of some late twentieth century editions alludes to their setting, a multiverse often called the Related Worlds, which young Christopher calls \\"Anywheres\\" in this volume. Worlds have branched from common ancestors at important events in history, such as English and French victories in the Battle of Agincourt. Some people can move between worlds and twelve series of similar worlds have been labelled by the English people of the stories. World 12A is the primary specific setting of this volume, and of the series, where Chrestomanci resides in England. Our world is 12B.  Plot  The novel tells the story of Christopher Chant's childhood. Although both of his parents are powerful practitioners of magic, the two are constantly at loggerheads; his father (an enchanter, the strongest type of magic-user) is entirely devoted to his work, to such a degree that the young Christopher is afraid that he would not recognise him should the two meet in public. On the other hand, his mother (a sorceress, the second-strongest type of magic-user) is a social climber, and is apparently only married to his father for his social connections. The only escape that Christopher has is through his dreams, in which he is able to escape to other worlds. While he is not the only person with this ability, seemingly no one is able to do it so easily as he. The fact that he can bring things back from these \\"spirit trips\\" makes him immensely valuable to his Uncle Ralph, a scheming silver-tongued businessman. He is soon caught up in a series of \\"experiments,\\" supposedly to test his talents. In reality, they are to fetch a series of highly illegal goods (from mermaid meat to dragon's blood), for sale at the highest prices on a magical black market. He is accompanied on these trips by Tacroy, a guide arranged by his uncle. While all this is going on, his father and mother part ways, his father having lost a goodly part of his fortune on the stock market, and Christopher is sent to a boarding school, where he does dismally at magic lessons, and develops an ambition to become a famous cricketer. However, his father has other ideas, and plucks him from the boarding school halfway through the school year, taking him to an irritable and elderly magic expert named Dr. Pawson. He soon unlocks the reason for Christopher's poor grades in magic: silver, specifically the silver coin his uncle gives him which he carries at all times. When Christopher touches silver, he loses his ability to use magic. When not touching silver, his magic surpasses almost every other enchanter in the world. Upon this discovery, he is sent to Chrestomanci Castle to be groomed for the role of the next Chrestomanci.  Characters  =Christopher Chant= Christopher is the protagonist of the book. He is nice and well- mannered, coming from a wealthy family. However, he tends to sulk and can be quite rude to people. Christopher is discovered to be the next Chrestomanci when his best friend hits him in the head with a cricket bat by accident, killing him. The doctor had pronounced him dead, but then he woke up in the morgue, confused. His father recognised Christopher as having more than one life, and got hold of Dr. Pawson, a magic expert. Christopher is furious, seeing as he had to quit school for magic lessons. He discovers that he has an exceptional talent for magic, as long as he has no silver on him. After many lessons, he is spirited away to Chrestomanci Castle, where he is unhappy and has no friends but a cat he brings from Asheth Temple, Throgmorten, and the spirit travelling guide Uncle Ralph sends along, called Tacroy. =The Living Asheth / Millie= The Living Asheth (also called \\"The Goddess\\") is the physical embodiment of a goddess worshipped in a world in Series 10. She is a girl about Christopher's age and is also an enchantress (although she at first thinks her magic comes from Asheth). Christopher first encounters her when he is sent by his Uncle Ralph to retrieve a living animal from his inter-world travels. The Goddess trades him a particularly nasty cat called Throgmorten in exchange for books from his world‚Äîthe goddess is not allowed to touch anything from her world that isn't holy. Christopher brings her books set in a boarding school, revolving around a girl named \\"Millie\\" (the series is reminiscent of Enid Blyton's boarding school series). The Goddess finds out that she is to die when she grows older and the Temple gets a new Living Asheth, so she runs away to Christopher's world after he tells her how he travelled from Series to Series. She adopts the name \\"Millie\\" from the books Christopher brought her. She winds up living in Christopher's world, going to school like an ordinary, wealthy girl with the funds the chief priestess gives her from the Temple. Later in the series, The Goddess becomes Christopher's wife, and is seen as such from Charmed Life onwards. =Tacroy / Mordecai Roberts= Tacroy is the spirit traveller Uncle Ralph had hired to help Christopher along with the raids. He is an easygoing man, and is a legendary cricket player at the Castle. He has a soft side for Miss Rosalie, a worker at the Castle. Tacroy belongs in Series Eleven, where their morals are different. He works as a spy, first told to work for a good man (Chrestomanci), and then a criminal (Uncle Ralph). Tacroy always went with Christopher. While his body lay in stasis back in Christopher's world, his spirit travelled with Christopher, loading carts and chatting. Tacroy was Christopher's source of joy while in the Castle, having grown to hate it there. But he is caught by the workers in the Castle smuggling goods for the Wraith. He is thrown in prison, but Christopher gets him out as soon as he could, after the current Chrestomanci's lives are scattered all over the Series by Uncle Ralph after he shot him with a special gun from Series One. He is eventually freed by Christopher, and given a pardon by the Chrestomanci. In the short story Stealer of Souls it is implied that Tacroy and Miss Rosalie marry and look after Gabriel de Witt once he has retired from the post of Chrestomanci. =Uncle Ralph= Uncle Ralph is Christopher's beloved uncle, who is also a villain. Uncle Ralph also happens to be the leader of the Wraith, an underground criminal organisation that smuggles magical goods and sells them through the black market. When Christopher was born, his father learned that silver would be dangerous or fatal to Christopher, and so was wary of Uncle Ralph, whose last name is Argent, which means silver. Uncle Ralph is the main antagonist of the book. He is Christopher's mother's brother, and pretended to help out his sister when his brother-in-law had lost their money. Christopher grew to love him, but shied away from him when he discovered Uncle Ralph's true identity. Throgmorten has an extreme dislike of him, as Uncle Ralph was going to cut him up and sell his parts. Uncle Ralph is merciless and was a millionaire by the time Christopher found out who he was.

Jetpack is a platform game available as freeware, developed by American studio Adept Software and originally published as shareware by Software Creations in 1993. The object of the levels is to collect all of the green emeralds scattered around the level while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Once accomplished, a door opens which the player must go through in order to advance to the next level. There is a single player, and a local multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode supports up to eight players, where players take turns on the same machine. The player is aided in his quest by a jetpack and a phase shifter, which allows tunnelling through certain walls. The environments, which usually consist of mazes of bricks, also feature vines, gold, ladders, ice, boxes, pillars, and conveyor belts. Other obstacles include jagged rocks, force fields, teleport pads, and indestructible bricks. In order to keep his jetpack running, the player has to collect fuel, by means of single/double tanks or fuel grids. The game includes a simple level editor. Numerous levels have been published on Adept Software's website. The registered game features 100 pre-built levels. The developers also released a hintbook containing screenshots and a short piece of advice for every level. Versions Jetpack was released in several variations, including a Christmas version with completely different levels, where the player became Santa and ran around leaving presents at Christmas trees instead of collecting emeralds. The Christmas version was almost exactly the same, but with different levels and a few more festive sprites. There was also a version designed for children.

He became a pioneer of world and new age music with his 1969 album Inside. Biography Horn was born on March 17, 1930 in New York City and has Jewish roots through his father. The family moved to Washington, D.C. when Horn was four. He took up the piano at age four, followed by the clarinet at 12. While in Washington, D.C., Horn attended Theodore Roosevelt High School and the Washington College of Music. In the summer of 1942, Horn worked as an usher at the Earl Theatre to buy a clarinet. He studied the clarinet and flute at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio, earning a bachelor's degree. In June 1953, Horn gained a master's from the Manhattan School of Music. Moving to Los Angeles he played with Chico Hamilton's quintet from 1956 to 1958 and became an established West Coast session player. He played on the Duke Ellington Orchestra's Suite Thursday and worked with Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett and others. He scored the 1959 animated television series Clutch Cargo. In 1960 Horn recorded for Fantasy Records with Latin Jazz vibraphonist Cal Tjader (with drummers Willie Bobo and Mongo Santamaria) for the album Latino! (originally released in 1962 and later re-released with the same title in 1992). He appears playing with his band in the opening scene at the jazz club in Curtis Harrington's film Night Tide. Horn's Quintet produced jazz albums for Columbia and RCA Victor up until 1966. During this period, he was the subject of a David Wolper television documentary Portrait of a Jazz Musician. Horn became a practitioner of transcendental meditation. He attended training at the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram along with The Beatles on their 1968 trip to India. Following his experiences in India, Horn's recordings moved from jazz to world and new-age music. In 1955, Horn married his first wife, Lilian Yvonne Jourdan. By 1959, the marriage had started to fall apart, and their divorce was finalised a few years later. In 1970, he moved with his two sons Marlen and Robin from his marriage, and second wife Tryntje Baum to Victoria, British Columbia, on Vancouver Island. He formed his own quintet and recorded film scores for the National Film Board of Canada. While well practiced as a jazz musician, many of his works defy such categorization. As well as the Inside series, he recorded other albums of jazz with musicians from a range of cultures and backgrounds including China and Africa. He lived in British Columbia and Arizona. He was most recently married to the Canadian singer and songwriter Ann Mortifee. Horn died at the age of 84 on June 29, 2014.Obituary in Times Colonist. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Paul Horn among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

Dunajsk√° Lu≈æn√° lies approximately 15 km from the capital city of Bratislava towards Dunajsk√° Streda and Kom√°rno. It was founded on 1 January 1974 consisting of three formerly separate villages - Nov√© Ko≈°arisk√° (German: Mischdorf, Hungarian: Mis√©rd), J√°no≈°√≠kov√° (German: Schildern, Hungarian: D√©nesd) and Nov√° Lipnica (German: Tartschendorf, Hungarian: Torcs). Dunajsk√° Lu≈æn√° belongs to the vicinity of Bratislava. There is increasing building activity because of new inhabitants coming from Bratislava or other cities. Not far from the municipality towards Senec lie two lakes - Mal√° Voda and Pieskov√° Jama. They are used for fishing and bathing and in summer months they are quite crowded. Near the township runs a dam, protecting the villages and townships all the way from Bratislava to Gabƒç√≠kovo from flooding of the Danube River. There is a large Roman Catholic community in Dunajsk√° Lu≈æn√° with the Church, devoted to \\"The Elevation of the Holy Cross\\". Besides Roman Catholics there are also Lutherans and other religions.  History  The village crest shows St. Martin of Tours. The municipality of Dunajsk√° Lu≈æn√° is also well known in European archaeology for its burial mound which dates from around 700 - 500 BCE. During the archaeological survey in the \\"Nov√© Ko≈°arisk√°\\" part of the municipality, a necropolis with fire-type burials and a central earth-grave was studied. Archaeogolists found richly decorated ceramic bins here, although only few metallic objects were retrieved. In 1945 the predominantly German inhabitants of the three neighbouring villages Nov√© Ko≈°arisk√° (German: Mischdorf), J√°no≈°√≠kov√° (German: Schildern) and Nov√° Lipnica (German: Tartschendorf) were expelled. In January 2004, a permanent exposition with the name \\"History and present of the municipality\\" was opened in Dunajsk√° Lu≈æn√° and it provides visitors with closer view of the past and present life of the Township. Demographics Due to its proximity near Austria and Hungary the village boasts a strong ethnic mix, with up to fourteen different nationalities calling the village home.http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/14617/9/ One of these is Dunajsk√° Lu≈æn√°'s strong Roma population, which is renowned for their skills as blacksmiths,http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/14617/9/, http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/17644/9/ and much of the ironwork seen in and around Bratislava is the craft of these smiths.http://www.reocities.com/~patrin/fireandiron.htm According to the 2011 census, the municipality had 4,482 inhabitants. 4,023 of inhabitants were Slovaks, 214 Hungarians, 45 Czechs, 22 Germans and 178 others and unspecified.

Religion is considered a personal belief in Hinduism and followers are free to choose the different interpretations within the framework of Karma and reincarnation. Many forms of Hinduism believe in a monotheistic God, such as Krishna followers, Vedanta, Arya samaj, Samkhya school of Vedas etc,, Quote: \\"The jealous God who says, \\"Thou shalt have no other gods but me\\" belongs to the Jewish-Christian-Muslim tradition, but not to the Hindu tradition, which tolerates all gods but is not a monotheism, monism, yes, but not monotheism.\\" Many traditions within Hinduism share the Vedic idea of a metaphysical ultimate reality and truth called Brahman instead. According to Jan Gonda, Brahman denoted the \\"power immanent in the sound, words, verses and formulas of Vedas\\" in the earliest Vedic texts. The early Vedic religious understanding of Brahman underwent a series of abstractions in the Hindu scriptures that followed the Vedic scriptures. These scriptures would reveal a vast body of insights into the nature of Brahman as originally revealed in the Vedas. These Hindu traditions that emerged from or identified with the Vedic scriptures and that maintained the notion of a metaphysical ultimate reality would identify that ultimate reality as Brahman. Hindu adherents to these traditions within Hinduism revere Hindu deities and, indeed, all of existence, as aspects of the Brahman.James Lochtefeld, Brahman, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A‚ÄìM, Rosen Publishing. , page 122Gavin Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, , pages 84-85 The deities in Hinduism are not considered to be almighty, omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent, and spirituality is considered to be seeking the ultimate truth that is possible by a number of paths.; Guy Beck (2005), Alternative Krishnas: Regional and Vernacular Variations on a Hindu Deity, State University of New York Press, , page 169 note 11Bruce Trigger (2003), Understanding Early Civilizations: A Comparative Study, Cambridge University Press, , pages 441-442, Quote: [Historically...] people perceived far fewer differences between themselves and the gods than the adherents of modern monotheistic religions. Deities were not thought to be omniscient or omnipotent and were rarely believed to be changeless or eternal.\\" Like other Indian religions, in Hinduism, deities are born, they live and they die in every kalpa (eon, cycle of existence). In Hindu philosophy, there are many different schools. Its non-theist traditions such as Samkhya, early Nyaya, Mimamsa and many within Vedanta such as Advaita do not posit the existence of an almighty, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God (monotheistic God), while its theistic traditions posit a personal God left to the choice of the Hindu. The major schools of Hindu philosophy explain morality and the nature of existence through the karma and samsara doctrines, as in other Indian religions.Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Ed: Gavin Flood), Wiley-Blackwell, , pages 454-455; ; Francis X. Clooney (1989), Evil, Divine Omnipotence, and Human Freedom: VedƒÅnta's Theology of Karma, The Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, No. 4, pages 530-548 Contemporary Hinduism can be categorized into four major traditions: Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, and Smartism. Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism worship Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi ‚Äî the Divine Mother ‚Äî as the Supreme respectively, or consider all Hindu deities as aspects of the formless Supreme Reality or Brahman. Other minor sects such as Ganapatya and Saura focus on Ganesha and Surya as the Supreme. A sub-tradition within the Vaishnavism school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic Dvaita, founded by Madhvacharya in the 13th-century (where Vishnu as Krishna is a monotheistic God). This tradition posits a concept of monotheistic God so similar to Christianity that Christian missionaries in colonial India suggested that Madhvacharya was likely influenced by early Christians who migrated to India,Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, , pages 177-179 a theory that has been discredited by scholars.

The theological interpretation of ' differs with each tradition and the translated from the Sanskrit language, the term literary means \\"Bhagavan Himself\\" or \\"directly Bhagavan.\\" Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition often translates it within its perspective as primeval Lord or original Personality of Godhead, but also considers the terms such as Supreme Personality of Godhead and Supreme God as an equivalent to the term Svayam Bhagavan, and may also choose to apply these terms to Vishnu, Narayana and many of their associated avatars. \\"Krishna is the primeval Lord, the original Personality of Godhead, so He can expand Himself into unlimited forms with all potencies.\\" page 161...\\"Bhakti, the highest path, was that of surrender to Lord Krishna, the way of pure devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead\\". p.109 Klaus Klostermaier translates it simply as \\"the Lord Himself\\" Gaudiya Vaishnavas and followers of the Vallabha Sampradaya Nimbarka Sampradaya, use the Gopala Tapani Upanishad, and the Bhagavata Purana, to support their view that Krishna is indeed the Svayam Bhagavan. This belief was summarized by the 16th century author Jiva Goswami in some of his works, such as Krishna-sandarbha. In other sub-traditions of Vaishnavism, Krishna is one of many aspects and avatars of Vishnu (Rama is another, for example), recognized and understood from an eclectic assortment of perspectives and viewpoints. Vaishnavism is one of the earliest single God focussed traditions that derives its heritage from the Vedas. Within Hinduism, Krishna is worshiped from a variety of perspectives.See McDaniel, June, \\"Folk Vaishnavism and : Life and status among village Krishna statues\\" in A different Vaishnavism viewpoint, such as those in Sri Vaishnavism, opposing this theological concept is the concept of Krishna as one of the many avatar of Narayana or Vishnu. The Sri Vaishnavism sub-tradition reveres goddess Lakshmi with god Vishnu as equivalent, and traces it roots its roots to the ancient Vedas and Pancaratra texts in Sanskrit.

Left unchecked, the progression of the condition will eventually lead to the failure of the arch and any structures supported by it.  Causes  The structural degradation of arches can occur for a variety of reasons. The stones or masonry components that make up an arch are vulnerable to physical and chemical attack over long periods of time. Sources of damage include atmospheric conditions, human induced mechanical stress, improper design, and natural disturbances like earthquakes or wildlife. = Ground shifting = Movement of the ground beneath an arch will eventually destroy it by changing the mechanical relationship between stones in the arch. An arch will evenly distribute forces across the surfaces of each stone when it is properly emplaced. Moving the ground below the arch will negatively affect the distribution of stress. An arch will slump in the center if the two sides move apart. If the sides are moved closer together, a hinge will form in the arch, increasing the stress on that area. Arches can also become angled away from level, inducing forces that are not normal to the faces of the individual stones. The ground can shift over long periods of time for many reasons: earthquakes, frost, swelling clays, tree roots, animal burrows, and unstable soils all have the potential to move the foundation of a building. = Weathering = A very exposed arch at Lindisfarne Priory on Holy Island, Northumberland. The weather plays an important role in destroying stone structures. Daily or annual freeze/thaw cycles cause water trapped in cracks to expand, breaking up the stones or causing them to shift from their original setting. Frost heaving in the ground may move the structure, making it unstable. Precipitation can also be detrimental for certain materials. Limestone and cement are subject to weathering from rain. Natural rainwater has a pH of 5.6 due to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This is low enough to dissolve the calcium carbonate that constitutes limestone and cement. Air pollution can greatly enhance this effect by dropping the pH of the rainwater. In the eastern United States, the pH of rainwater can be as low as 2.0. Rain can also dissolve salts from the stone or other sources and redeposit the salt into cracks in the stones or between them. The salts will then crystalize as the water evaporates, putting pressure on the edges of the crack and causing the stones to move or chip. This effect is most pronounced in coastal and urban environments. Salt damage is also prevalent in cities that employ salts to deice roads and sidewalks. If an arch includes mortar between the stones, the mortar becomes a likely point of weathering. As the mortar decays, the stones on either side will become unsupported and lead to failure. = Vibration = Human activities can inadvertently damage stone arches. The vibrations caused by road traffic can allow stones to shift over time. An arch will constantly apply pressure to the sides and downwards, so anytime a space is created by vibration on the sides the arch will shift to fill the gaps. As the stones move, the structure will eventually become unstable and collapse. Many[who?]attribute the decay to low pitch vibrations produced by late 19th century pipe organs, the proliferation of the 32 feet pipe particularly responsible, although some[who?]blame the vibrations from inner city traffic. The stone becomes crumbly, producing a fine powdered stone; large sections loosen and often fall off, creating a hazard. = Design flaws = Arches that lack adequate support on the sides will slump and fail. All arches convert some of the weight of the structure into a horizontal outwards thrust. The structure may be stable for a time, but the arch will push the walls around it outwards continuously. This is prevented by proper engineering. Arches can be supported by a buttress on the outer wall, thick, heavy wall construction between the arch and the corner, or by using arches in a series so that each arch is opposed by two others on its sides.  Prevention  The bald arch condition can be prevented by taking precautions during the construction phase and by properly maintaining the stonework over time. Ground movement can be avoided by using a solid foundation. Removing vegetation from near the foundation and preventing animals from burrowing will help to keep the foundation stable. Frost damage can be reduced by ensuring drainage around the building and by keeping the roof in good condition. This will keep water from saturating the stone and cracking it during cold weather. Keeping water off of the stone will also prevent salt and acid rain damage. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to keep the rainwater off the walls. Paint can be applied to the stones to protect them from rain and pollution, but this is often rejected because it alters the appearance of historic buildings. Cleaning the stone regularly can help to reduce the effects of chemical weathering. Pollutants accumulate on the exterior surfaces of the stone. They react with the stone and degrade the outer portions. This will degrade the appearance of the stone and eventually weaken it to the point of failure. The most popular methods are scrubbing with fresh water or steam cleaning. This is very expensive and time consuming for a large building. It may be impossible to treat the entire building in one season, and scaffoldings will need to be erected to reach the higher parts.  Restoration  It is often desirable to preserve an arch because they are common in historic and monumental architecture. Numerous methods are employed for restoring or preserving degraded arches. The first stage in restoring an arch is to evaluate the structure to determine how serious the damage is and what technique is best suited for repair. An architect or engineer will measure the rate of deformation over some period of time, to see how fast the arch is degrading. The deformation could have occurred immediately after construction during the settling period. If that is the case, it is less urgent to repair the damage. The goal of the restoration is an important consideration. If the goal is only to prevent further deterioration, there will be less work than if the goal is to restore the original condition. = Shoring = An arch may be shored up by adding new materials to the structure. The mode of failure determines how the arch should be reinforced. The most common failure for arches is an outwards movement of stones near the top. An arch will constantly apply pressure sideways, so the outwards pressure must be managed. If the arch is failing sideways, a buttress can be built to contain the lateral thrust. Steel tensioning rods can take the place of an external buttress to maintain the original appearance in some cases. Removing any stone from an arch without preparing the entire arch will cause it to fail. The arch must be supported before any work can be done. This is done with a falsework of wooden trusses, similar to how the arch is initially built. The entire arch is supported by the wooden falsework. Individual stones can then be removed and repaired or replaced. Repointing or grouting the joints between stones can greatly improve the integrity of the structure. If the arch has slumped it can be shored up using a hydraulic jack, and then the stones can be pushed into place and repointed. This can be a very demanding job, since any structures supported by the arch will need to be supported while the arch is repaired. The arches also can be reinforced using steel trusses. Some opponents believe that this degrades the appearance of the arches, that it makes them look like dental braces. Without this support, the building would be structurally unsound.

After graduation, Stulen served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and in the U.S. Air Force from 1942 to 1946, where he was head of the Propeller Lab, Rotary Wing Branch based out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. After a meeting with John T. Parsons, he was hired as Chief Engineer and Vice President of Engineering at Parsons Corporation in Traverse City. While working at Parsons Corporation, he invented numerical control of machine tools, in collaboration with Parsons. Though Parsons developed many of the core ideas, it was Stulen, as chief engineer, who turned these ideas into working machines and processes. In 1985, Stulen and Parsons were jointly awarded the National Medal of Technology by President Ronald Reagan for \\"Revolutioniz[ing] Production Of Cars And Airplanes With Numerical Controls For Machines\\". Stulen was also Mayor of Traverse City, Michigan in 1961 and 1962.  Life  Stulen was born on January 22, 1921 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He went to Carnegie Mellon University (then called Carnegie Tech), and moved to Traverse City, Michigan to begin his work with Parsons.  Development of NC  In 1942, Parsons was told that helicopters were going to be the \\"next big thing\\" by the former head of Ford Trimotor production, Bill Stout. He called Sikorsky Aircraft to inquire about possible work, and soon got a contract to build the wooden stringers in the rotor blades. At the time, rotor blades were built in the same fashion that fixed wings were, consisting of a long tubular steel spar with stringers (or more accurately ribs) set on them to provide the aerodynamic shape that was then covered with a stressed skin. The stringers for the rotors were built from a design provided by Sikorsky, which was sent to Parsons as a series of 17 points defining the outline. Parsons then had to \\"fill in\\" the dots with a French curve to generate an outline. A wooden jig was built up to form the outside of the outline, and the pieces of wood forming the stringer were placed under pressure against the inside of the jig so they formed the proper curve. A series of trusswork members were then assembled inside this outline to provide strength. After setting up production at a disused furniture factory and ramping up production, one of the blades failed and it was traced to a problem in the spar. At least some of the problem appeared to stem from spot welding a metal collar on the stringer to the metal spar. The collar was built into the stringer during construction, then slid onto the spar and welded in the proper position. Parsons suggested a new method of attaching the stringers directly to the spar using adhesives, never before tried on an aircraft design. That development led Parsons to consider the possibility of using stamped metal stringers instead of wood. These would not only be much stronger, but far easier to make as well, as they would eliminate the complex layup and glue and screw fastening on the wood. Duplicating this in a metal punch would require the wooden jig to be replaced by a metal cutting tool made of tool steel. Such a device would not be easy to produce given the complex outline. Looking for ideas, Parsons visited Wright Field to see Stulen, the head of the Propeller Lab Rotary Wing Branch. During their conversation, Stulen concluded that Parsons didn't really know what he was talking about. Parsons realized Stulen had reached this conclusion, and hired him on the spot. Stulen started work on 1 April 1946 and hired three new engineers to join him. Stulen's brother worked at Curtis Wright Propeller, and mentioned that they were using punched card calculators for engineering calculations. Stulen decided to adopt the idea to run stress calculations on the rotors, the first detailed automated calculations on helicopter rotors. When Parsons saw what Stulen was doing with the punched card machines, he asked Stulen if they could be used to generate an outline with 200 points instead of the 17 they were given, and offset each point by the radius of a mill cutting tool. If you cut at each of those points, it would produce a relatively accurate cutout of the stringer. This could cut the tool steel and then easily be filed down to a smooth template for stamping metal stringers. Stullen had no problem making such a program, and used it to produce large tables of numbers that would be taken onto the machine floor. Here, one operator read the numbers off the charts to two other operators, one on each of the X- and Y- axes. For each pair of numbers the operators would move the cutting head to the indicated spot and then lower the tool to make the cut. This was called the \\"by-the-numbers method\\", or more technically, \\"plunge-cutting positioning\\".\\"Numerically Controlled Milling Machine\\" It was a labor-intensive prototype of today's 2.5 axis machining (two-and-a-half-axis machining).  Legacy  The Parsons-Stulen building, home of the Northwestern Michigan College Aviation Campus at Cherry Capital Airport, is named after Parsons and Stulen.

It was first released in September 1984 and has since been re-released several times, mainly in the digitally remastered form in 2005 with bonus tracks. Shine, alongside the accompanying promotional videos and clips, is included in Frida ‚Äì 4xCD 1xDVD. This album has never been officially released in the United States, but was issued in Canada by WEA. This is Lyngstad's last English language studio album to date. Recording history After the success of Something's Going On, Phil Collins was to produce again for Frida's next album, but as Genesis formed part of his other commitments, producer Steve Lillywhite took over his role. Recording began on 1 February 1984, at the Studios de la Grande Arm√©e, Paris, France. The producer was Steve Lillywhite, and at only 29 years of age, he was already known for his work with Peter Gabriel, the Rolling Stones and U2 amongst others. Lilywhite's then-wife Kirsty MacColl co-wrote three songs that made the album, as well as a fourth recorded at the sessions and used as a B-side. At the time of recording, both Something's Going On and Shine, Lyngstad wanted to distance herself from the \\"typical ABBA pop-sound\\" and try new directions. Lillywhite managed to give Lyngstad an even more modern and complex soundscape than Phil Collins had done on her previous album. In Frida ‚Äì The DVD, when speaking about Shine and its failure to recreate the success of its predecessor, Lyngstad herself said \\"that maybe this album became a bit too modern for its time\\".Frida ‚Äì The DVD Music Shine features songwriting contributions from musicians such as Stuart Adamson, Kirsty MacColl, Simon Climie (of Climie Fisher fame), and Pete Glenister ‚Äì Alison Moyet's co-writer and producer. The Shine album is also unique as it saw the debut of Lyngstad as a songwriter in both \\"Don't Do It\\" and \\"That's Tough\\", the latter also features her son Hans Fredriksson as co-writer. (Frida also wrote \\"I Don't Wanna Be Alone\\" during this period). The track \\"Slowly\\" was written by Benny Andersson and Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus of ABBA. This is the last commercially released song written by the ABBA composers to be recorded by either of ABBA's female vocalists to date. The lead single from the album was the title track, \\"Shine\\".

In each he is an enthusiast for popular literature and a popularising businessman, described by one modern editor as \\"hovering on the borderline of roguery\\". Early life Francis Kirkman was the eldest son of Francis Kirkman senior (1602‚Äì61), who was a member of the Blacksmith's Company and a citizen of the City of London. Little is known of the younger Kirkman's life beyond his publications. He wrote The Unlucky Citizen (1673), which is taken to be autobiographical, though Kirkman was anything but reliable. However, the part in which he refers to his discovery of literature rings true, and is a good example of his style and enterprise: As will be seen, Kirkman‚Äôs enthusiasm for some of these books led him to publish them himself. He claims to have been forbidden to travel or be apprenticed into the book trade, and to have run away from the first scrivener to whom he was apprenticed. Publisher and bookseller Upon being apprenticed to another scrivener he installed his collection of novels and plays in his office, before selling many of them to finance the publication of his own translation of the sixth book of Amadis de Gaul (1652). It is characteristic that Kirkman's first publication was his own extension of a work already popular. His entrepreneurial talents were always directed towards the popular, or vulgar, end of the book trade. Although he became a freeman of the Blacksmith's Company he was never a member of the Stationers' Company. From 1652 he operated as a scrivener and bookseller from a small shop near the Tower of London, and continued to trade from various premises in Thames Street, Fenchurch Street and Paul's Yard until 1680. From 1657 he was publishing plays, although his partnership with Henry Marsh, Nathaniel Brook and Thomas Johnson ended after they were accused of pirating books, probably an edition of Beaumont and Fletcher's The Scornful Lady. He also claimed to have been swindled by Marsh, whose business he took over after his death in 1666. Kirkman had received a substantial inheritance on his father's death in 1661, which he squandered, and although he had an entrepreneurial spirit he suffered continual financial problems. Kirkman published many early novels, including many translated from French and Spanish. In 1652 he published The Loves and Adventures of Clerio and Lozia, which he also claimed was translated from French. One of his greatest successes was a novel, The English Rogue the first volume of which was written by Richard Head, and published in 1665. In 1666 Kirkman re-issued this, and then wrote a second volume in his own name (1668), followed by a third and fourth (1671), claiming Head as a co-author. In 1673 Kirkman wrote and issued under his own name The Counterfeit Lady Unveiled, a fictional autobiography of Mary Carleton, an impostor and bigamist. He also published other popular romances, such as The Famous and Delectable History of Don Bellianus of Greece, (1671‚Äì1674), The Seven Wise Masters of Rome (1674). Kirkman also became increasingly interested in theatre. In 1661 he published his own play The Presbyterian Lash, based on the notorious story of Zachary Crofton, a minister accused of whipping his maidservant. Kirkman had a penchant for the picaresque in literature, and in attributions. He also collected manuscripts, which he published, including A Cure for a Cuckold and The Thracian Wonder (both 1661), and both correctly attributed to John Webster and William Rowley. In 1662 he published The Birth of Merlin, wrongly attributed by him to William Shakespeare and William Rowley. This has been described as \\"a medley in which legendary history, love romance, sententious praise of virginity, rough and tumble clown-play, necromancy and all kinds of diablerie jostle each other\\". He was also involved in the publication of plays pirated from other printers. For instance, Kirkman in 1661 published The Beggars Bush by John Fletcher, Francis Beaumont, and Philip Massinger, pirated from Humphrey Robinson & Anne Moseley. Their hurried second printing contains a notice; Theatrical bibliography Kirkman's greatest contribution to literary history is his catalogues of plays. In 1671 he wrote \\"I have been these twenty years a Collector of plays, and have conversed with, and enquired of those that have been Collecting these fifty years\\". Kirkman's catalogues expanded upon two earlier lists, published in the first quartos of The Careless Shepherdess and The Old Law (both 1656). The first catalogue, attached to an edition of Tom Tyler and his Wife (1661), included 690 plays published England. Kirkman claimed to have read them all, and be ready to sell or lend them, \\"upon reasonable considerations\\". In 1671 he expanded to list 806 plays, attached to a translation of Pierre Corneille's Nicomede. For the first time he listed them not by title, but by author, for the most popular authors. Kirkman listed 52 plays attributed to Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, with Ben Jonson the next most productive at 50, and William Shakespeare third with 48. This was probably an accurate representation of their comparative popularity at the time. It must also be an indication of his reputation that Kirkman advertised books for sale at the sign of The John Fletcher's Head, only the second author thought worthy of this, (the first being Jonson). Shakespeare never This list provided the basis for the work of Gerard Langbaine, which became the main source for English drama to the end of the seventeenth century. Circulating library From the above Kirkman is taken to have operated what amounted to the first circulating library, based on his collection, starting in 1660, in Westminster and moving to Bishopsgate by 1669. The Wits (Drolls) Frontispiece to The Wits or Sport upon Sport (London, 1662). Attributed to Francis Kirkman. Also significant in the history of theatre was Kirkman's collection of drolls, The Wits, or Sport for Sport. The first part was published by Henry Marsh in 1662, but seems very likely to have been prepared by Kirkman before they fell into dispute and litigation. Marsh was a member of the Stationers' Company, and seems to have acted as printer and bookseller, with Kirkman acting as publisher and editor. It was described as Part I, but Part II did not appear until after Marsh had died and Kirkman had taken over his business. In 1672 Kirkman re-issued Part I, and issued Part II in 1673. Kirkman said, disingenuously, that the pieces were \\"written I know not when, by several persons, I know not who\\", though he included items such as the gravediggers' scene from Hamlet, and the bouncing knight from The Merry Wives of Windsor, the authorship of which cannot have been unknown either to him or his audience. He attributed some to an actor, Robert Cox, who had published his own drolls, and probably performed them at the Red Bull Theatre, and outside London. The Wits went through many editions in the next two decades. Kirkman described the contents as : ‚Äì Kirkman said the pieces were selected because of their popularity during the Commonwealth between 1642 and 1660, when the theatres were officially closed: ‚Äì He recommends the work for those reading for pleasure, fiddlers, mountebanks seeking a crowd, those undertaking long sea voyages, and strolling players, as ‚Äúa few ordinary properties is enough to set them up, and get money in any Town in England‚Äù. The extent to which these drolls were performed is almost impossible to tell. Some of the contents of The Wits were almost certainly edited by Kirkman from the many play scripts he owned. However, some of the drolls are known from versions that date before 1620. This suggests that, like so many plays, they existed in manuscript for many years before they were published. One droll, The Lame Commonwealth, a canting interlude extracted from The Beggars Bush, includes an additional section which seems to record stagecraft. Another droll from The Wits, Daphilo & Granida, is based on the play Granida by P.C. Hooft. Baskervill (1924) notes that a Christmas play collected from Keynsham, Somerset in 1822 contains a passage exhibiting a striking similarity to a passage from Daphilo & Granida, which suggests the text of Kirkman's droll was adapted for use in the folk play. The Wits is also known for the frontispiece by John Chantry. This is often assumed to represent the Red Bull Theatre, although this is disputed as being unlikely; it is not described as such before 1809, and is not consistent with what is known of it. It is one of the earliest illustrations of a theatre interior, showing chandeliers and lighting at the front of the stage, a curtained entrance, which may be genuine representations. However, the various characters shown are a catalogue, not an example of a scene as staged. They include Falstaff (by far the most popular theatrical character of the seventeenth century), a hostess, (perhaps Mistress Quickly), Clause (from The Lame Commonwealth), French Dancing Mr, (a dancing fiddler), The Changeling, and Simpleton, a character played by Cox.

Copy O, in the collection of the Library of Congress, is one of the two 1815-18 printings of Thel; the other is Copy N, in the collection of the Cincinnati Art Museum.Blake Archive The Book of Thel is a poem by William Blake, dated 1789 and probably composed in the period 1788 to 1790. It is illustrated by his own plates, and compared to his later prophetic books is relatively short and easier to understand. The metre is a fourteen-syllable line. It was preceded by Tiriel, which Blake left in manuscript. A few lines from Tiriel were incorporated into The Book of Thel. Most of the poem is in unrhymed verse. This book consists of eight plates executed in illuminated printing. Sixteen copies of the original print of 1789‚Äì1793 are known. Three copies bearing a watermark of 1815 are more elaborately colored than the others. Thel's Motto Plate 01 of the Book of Thel with Thel's Motto. This version of the image is from copy F currently held at the Library of Congress. Thel‚Äôs Motto can be interpreted as Blake‚Äôs rejection of the Church of England. The ‚Äúsilver rod‚Äù where Wisdom cannot be found represents a scepter or staff that would have been used in traditional kingship or even high-ranking ecclesiasts before the rise of nationalism and the consequent fall of the papacy in the 16th and 17th centuries.Sorensen, Peter. William Blake's Recreation of Gnostic Myth. Lewiston, NY: Edwin Mellen Press, 1995, p. 41. Print. The Motto goes on to express doubt that Love can be found in a ‚Äúgolden bowl.‚Äù The image of the golden bowl refers to a chalice that is raised when priests in the Christian tradition celebrate the Eucharist. The religious connotations of the rod and bowl help explain the disillusionment that many Romantic writers, notably William Blake, had with the state church. This type of theological alienation is consistent with the revolutionary and rebellious sentiments of the era. Another interpretation of the silver rod and the golden bowl are that of the male and female genitalia. Wisdom resides in the male organ and Love resides in the female organ.Wilkie, Brian. Blake's Thel and Oothoon. Victoria, British Columbia: University of Victoria Department of English, 1990, p. 90-1. Print. Should one accept this interpretation, the rod and bowl are transformed from an imperishable state to one of mortal flesh, and the reader acknowledges that a voice of authority is narrating the poem‚Äôs action. It is important to remember that Blake inscribed the ‚ÄúMotto‚Äù plate after he had already composed the first five plates, and the dates suggest that the Motto plate and plate 6 were created at or near the same time. Since Thel‚Äôs Motto is clearly an afterthought to the Book, one can connect the final plate, plate 6, and Thel‚Äôs Motto. The connection between the mole‚Äôs pit and the subterranean area that Thel enters in plate 6 suggests the disparate knowledge between beings in separate domains. The eagle knows only the sky and must ask the mole to gain knowledge about the pit; likewise, Thel knows only innocence and eternity and must be endowed mortality if she wants to learn about the ways of the mortal beings on Earth. The first lines The story The daughters of Mne Seraphim are all shepherdesses in the Vales of Har, apart from the youngest, Thel. She spends her time wandering on her own, trying to find the answer to the question that torments her: why does the springtime of life inevitably fade so that all things must end? She meets the Lily of the Valley who tries to comfort her. When Thel remains uncomforted, the Lily sends her on to ask the Cloud. The Cloud explains that he is part of a natural process and, although he sometimes disappears, he is never gone forever. Thel replies that she is not like the Cloud and when she disappears she will not return. So the Cloud suggests asking the same question of the Worm. The Worm is still a child and cannot answer. Instead it is the Worm‚Äôs mother, the Clod of Clay, who answers. The Clod explains that we do not live for ourselves, but for others. She invites Thel to enter into her underground realm and see the dark prison of the dead where Thel herself will one day reside. However, Thel is assailed by mysterious voices asking a whole series of yet more terrible questions about existence. Uttering a shriek, she flees back to her home in the Vales of Har. The pit represents sex and mortality of life, while the Vales of Har represent virginity and eternity. The first part of the poem shows the good part of life as in Songs of Innocence whereas the concluding part shows that life is full of sorrows where smiles are never seen, as in Songs of Experience. The question is \\"Why do the physical senses darken the soul by excluding it from the wisdom and joy of eternity?\\" Thel is the allegory of the unborn spirit who has gathered experience from her own discoveries and has decided to remain forever innocent. Innocence vs. Experience In The Book of Thel, the Vales of Har are depicted as an edenic paradise that lived in harmony; a world where the rain feeds the flowers and the clod of clay feeds the infantile worm.Erdman, David. Blake: Prophet against Empire. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1954, P. 119-21. Print. The common belief in this world among the characters is that ‚Äúeverything that lives Lives not alone nor for itself.‚Äù Thel wishes to enter the world of experience and leave behind her innocent paradise. However, once Thel enters the world of experience, she cowers in terror at the thought of mortality and the uselessness of human beings if every action leads toward the grave. This can also be interpreted as Thel‚Äôs fear of losing innocence and virginity upon entering the world of adult sexuality. In other words, Thel‚Äôs fear of growing up is what keeps her from actually living. When she flees from the experienced world because it appears as her tombstone, she unwittingly flees life itself. William Blake has put a microscope on the conflict between innocence and experience and he has found that innocence must take on a more elevated meaning, one found through suffering, that Thel can never reach so long as she is gripped by her fear of opening herself up to risk.Wilkie, Brian. Blake's Thel and Oothoon. Victoria, British Columbia: University of Victoria Department of English, 1990, p. 47. Print. The idea that Thel‚Äôs future life was one of despair and death can be read as another example of Thel‚Äôs skewed perspective. Thel is surprised by her brilliance and says that the world of experience looks like a ‚Äúchamber of horrors.‚Äù It has also been suggested that the Worm has a part in the conflict between innocence and experience. The Worm is speaking as a messenger for the world of experience, and his words are inaudible to Thel because the Worm is not a part of her realm.Levinson, Marjorie. \\"\\"The Book of Thel\\" by William Blake: A Critical Reading.\\" ELH 47.2 (1980):p. 294. Web. 6 Feb 2010. The Worm speaks of phallic sexuality and the guaranteed death of mortality. This creates a mediator when she gives the voice to the Clod of Clay. Now the Clod of Clay acts as an interface between innocence and experience. A visual criticism of Thel's fearful rejection of the natural progression from innocence to experience appears in the drawing containing the words \\"The End\\": children riding a serpent, a frequent iconographic symbol in Blake (cf. two instances in \\"Nurses Song,\\" \\"Songs of Innocence\\"). Quotations *\\"The Book of Thel is an allegory of the unborn spirit visiting the world of generation. Thel rejects the self- sacrificing aspects of experience and flees back to eternity. The symbols of the Lily-of-the-Valley, the Cloud, the Worm and the Clod of Clay represent idealistic fancy, youth, adolescence and motherhood.\\" --Geoffrey Keynes *\\"The Book of Thel is best understood as a rewriting of Milton's Comus. ...

It is a spin-off series to Phred on Your Head Show, an earlier Noggin series with the same animated host: a small, green character named Phred. The URL with Phred Show aired from September 10, 2001 until March 31, 2002. The show is presented as an art showcase, and each episode follows Phred as he presents a mix of viewer-submitted artwork and messages from Noggin's website. The show was named after URL, a term for an online web address. In the episodes, the URL name is said to also stand for \\"U R Live,\\" emphasizing how viewers could submit their own art and messages to Noggin's website to see them live on the show. In a departure from the original Phred on Your Head Show, the spin-off is themed around a website interface, and there are a variety of new characters who co-host the show with Phred. Most of the new characters started out in Noggin's online games before appearing on the show. Format =Characters= * Phred - The main host of the show, a former pickle mascot who looks like a yellow-green blob with short legs. He talks with a Brooklyn accent. As a running gag, Phred is often asked what his species is, and he will try to respond before being interrupted by a mishap in the studio. He was voiced by Doug Preis. * Noggimation Boy - A miniature boy made of 8-bit pixels who hosts the segment \\"Noggimation Station.\\" He has stringy red hair and wears a purple shirt. In his segment, he shows short animations submitted by Noggin.com users. He is hyperactive, talks in a sped-up voice, and is always moving around. Phred likes watching Noggimation Boy's animations but tends to get annoyed by him. * Birthday Boy - An untidy yellow cartoon boy who hosts the segment \\"Birthday Time.\\" He is always eating birthday cake and talks with his mouth full. He lives in a kitchen and likes to bake. His job is to announce the birthdays for Noggin.com users, but he usually shows up late and messes up his lines. At the end of each episode, Birthday Boy has a different excuse for being late to the \\"goodbye\\" segment. * Skengle and Skengle - Two aliens, both named Skengle, who host the segment \\"Skengle Poll.\\" They want to take over Noggin.com and then the Earth. They use online polls to find out everything about Earth and its people, hoping their knowledge will help them take over the world. The first Skengle is a blue cyclops with a female voice who wears a helmet. The second Skengle is a light green wig creature who wears a hair bow and floats around. * The Whats - A group of colorful birds with mismatched features who host the segment \\"Question the Whats.\\" They mostly communicate through warped sounds, squawks, and buzzing noises. * Big Voice - A sarcastic unseen announcer who narrates the segment \\"High Scores.\\" He often bickers with Phred, makes fun of him, and points out errors. Along with Phred, he is one of only two characters from Phred on Your Head Show to return for the spin-off. Although Big Voice is never shown on screen, Phred is able to see him and comments that he is \\"fat with an F.\\" * The Director - The off-screen director of the show. She is heard throughout all of the different segments. She also narrates the transitions from scene to scene, which usually involve her hurriedly trying to find the next act. =Segments= * Featured content - Like the original series, URL with Phred featured select episodes from shows such as Doug and Cro. * Phred's Email - This segment is usually featured at the start of the episodes. In it, Big Voice gives Phred an email from a Noggin.com user. Phred reads the email aloud and responds to it. Video messages and artwork were sometimes shown. * Dress Phred - Phred wears outfits designed by Noggin.com users. This segment is very brief and is often featured more than once in each episode. * Noggimation Station - Noggimation Boy shows a short digital animation from a Noggin.com user. As a running gag, Noggimation Boy sometimes tries to start the segment by chanting each letter of \\"Noggimation,\\" but Phred interrupts him. * Birthday Time - This segment features a list of Noggin.com users whose birthday was on a certain date. It is presented by Birthday Boy, with off- screen singing from Phred. * Skengle Poll - The Skengles announce the results of their online polls. In these segments, the Skengles often accidentally mention their plans to take over the Earth, which makes Phred question them. * Question the Whats - The Whats appear in a presentation of riddles. * High Scores - Big Voice announces the highest-scoring users for different online games on Noggin.com. When an unregistered user has a high score, their name is listed as \\"Nogginer.\\" * Goodbyes - This is the closing act of the show. It features the main characters gathering in Phred's room to say goodbye. One character (often Birthday Boy) is always late and holds up the end of the show. History =Production= An important change from the older Phred on Your Head Show was the addition of co-host characters who appear along with Phred in their own segments. Most of the new characters originated in Noggin's online games. Noggimation Boy first appeared as part of the \\"Noggimation Quilt,\\" an online feature where users could create and upload their own animations. After enough animations were posted, Noggin put them together as the patches of a digital quilt. Nickelodeon trademarked the name Noggimation on May 30, 2000, two months before The URL with Phred Show started. The Skengles were created by Noggin and Bottle Rocket for a game, just called \\"Skengle,\\" in 1999. The Skengle game asked thought-provoking questions to users and told them where they stood with their opinions in relation to others. It gave users the opportunity to tell Noggin why they chose certain answers, which Noggin could then publish on the site, making the users' voices heard. The game was reworked and renamed \\"Skengle Poll\\" for URL with Phred. The original game also gave a backstory to the Skengles, which was dropped and left unmentioned in the show. It described them as \\"aliens who, after drinking orange juice and brushing their teeth, cause a cataclysmic reaction that sends them hurtling through space towards Earth.\\" =Broadcast= The show was first announced by Noggin on June 11, 2001, and it was scheduled to premiere in summer 2001. It first appeared on Noggin's schedule on July 28, 2001. The show aired regularly throughout August and September. According to a Noggin press release, the show's official premiere was on September 10, and all previous airings were sneak peeks. URL with Phred was shown regularly on Noggin until March 31, 2002; this was the last day Noggin carried tween-oriented shows before it rebranded entirely as a preschool network.

The river basin is surrounded by ridges which separate it from the Yarlung Tsangpo River in the north, the Gandaki in the west and the Mahananda in the east. The river is joined by major tributaries in the Mahabharat Range approximately north of the Indo-Nepal border. Below the Siwaliks, the river has built up a megafan some in extent, breaking into more than 12 distinct channels, all with shifting courses due to flooding.Rao, K. L. (1975). India's Water Wealth. Orient Longman Ltd., Hyderabad, New Delhi.Verghese, B. G. (1993) \\"Waters of Hope: Integrated Water Resource Development and Regional Cooperation within the Himalayan-Ganga-Brahmaputra-Barak Basin\\". Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi and Oxford. IBH Publishing Co., New Delhi. KamalƒÅ, BƒÅgmati (Kareh) and Budhi Gandak are major tributaries of Kosi River in India, besides minor tributaries such as Bhutahi BalƒÅn. Its unstable nature has been attributed to the heavy silt it carries during the monsoon season, and flooding in India has extreme effects. Fishing is an important enterprise on the river but fishing resources are being depleted and youth are leaving for other areas of work. Geography Streams in Barun river valley Nepal - they join and merge into Arun river, another tributary of Koshi river Dudh Koshi, one of the seven Himalayan tributaries of Kosi river The Kosi River catchment covers six geological and climatic belts varying in altitude from above to comprising the Tibetan plateau, the Himalayas, the Himalayan mid-hill belt, the Mahabharat Range, the Siwalik Hills and the Terai. The Dudh-Koshi sub-basin alone consists of 36 glaciers and 296 glacier lakes. The Kosi River basin borders the Tsangpo River basin in the north, the Mahananda River basin in the east, the Ganges Basin in the south and the Gandaki River basin in the west. The eight tributaries of the basin upstream the Chatra Gorge include from east to west: * Tamur River with an area of in eastern Nepal; * Arun River with an area of , most of which is in Tibet; * Sun Kosi with an area of in Nepal and its northern tributaries Dudh Kosi, Likhu Khola, Tama Koshi, Bhote Koshi and Indravati. The three major tributaries meet at Triveni, from where they are called Sapta Koshi meaning Seven Rivers. After flowing through the Chatra Gorge the Sapta Koshi is controlled by the Koshi Barrage before it drains into the Gangetic plain. Peaks located in the basin include Mount Everest, Kangchenjunga, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Shishapangma. The Bagmati river sub-basin forms the south-western portion of the overall Kosi basin. The Dudh Koshi joins the Sun Koshi near the village of Harkapur. At , it emerges from the mountains and becomes the Koshi. After flowing another , it crosses into Bihar near Bhimnagar and after another joins the Ganges near Kursela. The Kosi alluvial fan is one of the largest in the world. It shows evidence of lateral channel shifting exceeding during the past 250 years, via at least twelve major channels. The river, which flowed near Purnea in the 18th century, now flows west of Saharsa. A satellite image shows old channels with a confluence before 1731 with the Mahananda River north of Lava. Floods Flooded north Bihar, India The Kosi River is known as the \\"Sorrow of Bihar\\" as the annual floods affect about of fertile agricultural lands thereby disturbing the rural economy. It has an average water flow (discharge) of . During floods, it increases to as much as 18 times the average. The greatest recorded flood was on 24 August 1954. The Kosi Barrage has been designed for a peak flood of . Extensive soil erosion and landslides in its upper catchment have produced a silt yield of about per year (10 cu yd/acre/yr), one of the highest in the world. Of major tributaries, the Arun brings the greatest amount of coarse silt in proportion to its total sediment load. The river transports sediment down the steep gradients and narrow gorges in the mountains and foothills where the gradient is at least ten metres per km. On the plains beyond Chatra, the gradient falls below one metre per km to as little as 6 cm per km as the river approaches the Ganges. Current slows and the sediment load settles out of the water and is deposited on an immense alluvial fan that has grown to an area of about 15 000 km2. This fan extends some 180 km from its apex where it leaves the foothills, across the international border into Bihar state and on to the Ganges. The river has numerous interlacing channels that shift laterally over the fan from time to time. Without channelisation, floods spread out very widely. The record flow of 24 200 m3/s is equivalent to water a metre deep and more than 24 km wide, flowing at one metre per second. The Kosi's alluvial fan has fertile soil and abundant groundwater in a part of the world where agricultural land is in great demand. Subsistence farmers balance the threat of starvation with that of floods. As a result, the flood-prone area is densely populated and subject to heavy loss of life. India has more flood deaths than any country except Bangladesh. =2008 flood in Bihar= On 18 August 2008, the Kosi River picked up an old channel it had abandoned over 100 years previously near the border with Nepal and India. Approximately 2.7 million people were affected as the river broke its embankment at Kusaha in Nepal, submerging several districts of Nepal and India. 95% of the Kosi's water flowed through the new course. The worst affected districts included Supaul, Araria, Saharsa, Madhepura, Purnia, Katihar, parts of Khagaria and northern parts of Bhagalpur, as well as adjoining regions of Nepal. Relief work was carried out with Indian Air Force helicopters by dropping relief materials from Purnia in the worst hit districts where nearly two million persons were trapped. The magnitude of deaths or destruction were hard to estimate, as the affected areas were inaccessible. 150 people were reported washed away in a single incident.Dainik Hindustan, Darbhanga edition Another news item stated that 42 people had died. dead link The Government of Bihar convened a technical committee, headed by a retired engineer-in-chief of the water resource department to supervise the restoration work and close the breach in the East Kosi afflux embankment. dead link Indian authorities worked to prevent widening of the breach, and channels were to be dug to direct the water back to the main river bed. The fury of the Kosi River left at least 2.5 million people marooned in eight districts and inundated . The prime Minister of India declared it a national calamity. The Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and non-government organizations operated the biggest flood rescue operation in India in more than 50 years.  Glaciers, glacier lakes and outburst floods In the Himalayas, glaciers are melting and retreating, which produces lakes insecurely dammed by ice or moraines. These dams are at risk of breaking, causing a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) with flows as great as 10,000 cubic metres a second. In the past two decades GLOF has become a topic of intense discussion within the development community in Nepal. The Dig Tsho GLOF on 4 August 1985, completely destroyed the nearly completed Namche hydropower plant and all bridges, trails, cultivation fields, houses and livestock along its path to the confluence of the Dudh-Koshi and the Sun-Koshi rivers over . The Dig Tsho glacier is on the terminus of the Langmoche Glacier. This event brought into focus the seriousness of such events and the studies to assess the glaciers, glacier lakes and GLOF followed. Studies of the glaciers and glacier lakes were carried out in 1988 by a joint Sino-Nepalese team. The Arun-Koshi river basin hosts 737 glaciers and 229 glacier lakes, out of which 24 lakes are potentially dangerous. The Sun-Koshi basin is home to 45 glacier lakes, of which 10 are potentially dangerous. According to a Sino-Nepalese study, since the 1940s on at least 10 occasions, glacier lakes burst their dams. Among them were five bursts in three glacier lakes in the Arun River Basin and four in three glacier lakes of the Sun Koshi River Basin. Development scenario =Multipurpose projects= The National Flood Control Policy in 1954 (following the disastrous floods of 1954 in a large part of the Kosi river basin) planned to control floods through a series of dams, embankments and river training works. The Kosi project was thus conceptualized (based on investigations between 1946 and 1955), in three continuous interlinked stages ‚Äì the first was a barrage to anchor the river that had migrated about westward in the last 250 years laying waste to a huge tract in north Bihar and to provide irrigation and power benefits to Nepal and India. The second part was to build embankments both below and above the barrage to hold the river within the defined channel. The third part envisaged a high multipurpose dam within Nepal at Barakshetra to provide a substantial flood cushion along with large irrigation and power benefits to both countries. This was followed by the Kosi Agreement between Nepal and India signed on 25 April 1954 and revised on 19 December 1966 to address Nepal's concerns. Further letters of Exchange to the Agreement between the two countries identified additional schemes for providing benefits of irrigation. While the first two parts of the plan were implemented by the Government of India, the Kosi High dam, the linchpin of the whole plan, for various political reasons has yet precluded any action for several years but has since been revived under a fresh agreement, in a modified form for further investigations and studies (1,2,3,4 & 5). =Koshi barrage and irrigation= Koshi Barrage Koshi Barrage, also called Bhimnagar Barrage, was built between 1959 and 1963 and straddles the Indo-Nepal border. It is an irrigation, flood control and hydropower generation project on the Kosi River built under a bilateral agreement between Nepal and India: the entire cost of the project was borne by India. The catchment area of the river is in Nepal at the barrage site. The highest peaks lie in its catchment. About 10% is snow-fed. The Eastern Canal and the Western Canal taking off from the barrage, were designed for a discharge capacity of to irrigate and to irrigate , respectively. A hydropower plant has been built on the Eastern Canal, at a canal drop ( from the Kosi Barrage), to generate 20 MW. The Western Koshi Canal provides irrigation to in Nepal. A valuable bridge over the barrage opened up the East- West highway in the eastern sector of Nepal. An inundation canal taking off at Chatra, where the Kosi River debouches into the plains, has been built to irrigate a gross area of 860 km2 in Nepal. The project was renovated with IDA assistance after Nepal took over the project in 1976. =Kosi embankment system= Silt deposition near Kosi embankment at Navbhata, Saharsa, Bihar, India The Koshi barrage, with earth dams across the river, as well as afflux bunds and embankments above and below the river, confines the river to flow within embankments. Embankments on both sides downstream of the barrage with a length of were constructed to check the westward movement of the river. The embankments have been kept far apart, about 12 to , to serve as a silt trap. =Sapta Koshi High Multipurpose Project (Indo-Nepal)= The governments of India and Nepal agreed to conduct joint investigations and other studies for the preparation of a detailed project report of Sapta Koshi High Dam Multipurpose Project and Sun Koshi Storage-cum-Diversion Scheme to meet the objectives of both countries for development of hydropower, irrigation, flood control and management and navigation. As currently outlined, the dam would displace approximately 75,000 people. Envisaged are a high concrete or rock- filled dam, a barrage, and two canals. The dam is on the Sapta Koshi River with an underground powerhouse, producing 3,000 MW at 50% load factor. The barrage is planned for the Sapta Koshi about downstream of Sapta Koshi High Dam to re-regulate the diverted water. The Eastern Chhatra Canal and Western Chhatra Canal, off-take from the barrage site to provide water for irrigation both in Nepal and India and navigation through Koshi up to Kursela and also in the reservoir of Sapta Koshi dam. A power canal existing Kosi barrage at Hanuman Nagar is proposed for conveying water for irrigation from the Eastern Chatra Canal and also water that may be required downstream for navigation. To utilize the head available between Chatra and Hanuman Nagar barrages for power generation, three canal power houses, each of 100 MW installed capacity are proposed on the power canal. Extra storage capacity of Sapta Koshi High Dam would be provided to moderate downstream flooding. Chatra Canal System would provide irrigation to large areas in Nepal and India, particularly in Bihar. A Joint Project Office (JPO) has been set up in Nepal for investigation of the project. =Hydropower= Nepal has a total estimated potential of 83,290 MW with economically exploitable potential of 42,140 MW. The Kosi River basin contributes 22,350 MW of this potential including 360 MW from small schemes and 18750 MW from major schemes. The economically exploitable potential is assessed as 10,860 MW (includes the Sapta Koshi Multipurpose Project [3300MW] mentioned above). Adventure sports Commercial river rafting, also known as whitewater rafting, and canyoning is available on the Sun Koshi river and tributaries.

Coldwater fish and fisheries in Nepal. Fish and Fisheries at Higher Altitudes: Asia. Issue 385 of FAO fisheries technical paper. Food & Agriculture Organisation. Pp. 13‚Äì40. Cultural significance The Kosi was also called Kausika in Rigveda. It is a major tributary of the Ganges. One major tributary of the Kosi is the Arun, much of whose course is in Tibet. This river is mentioned in the epic 'Mahabharata' as Kausiki. Formerly known as 'Kausiki,' named after the sage Vi≈õvƒÅmitra, who is said to have attained the status of Vedic or 'Rishi' on the banks of the river. Vi≈õvƒÅmitra was a descendant of the sage Kusika. Vi≈õvƒÅmitra is credited with writing many well-known Vedic Hymns on the Banks of the Kosi where he had his hermitage ‚Äî The Mandala 3, the Rigveda, and the GƒÅyatrƒ´ Mantra. The GƒÅyatrƒ´ Mantra is a highly revered mantra based on a Vedic Sanskrit verse from a hymn of the Rigveda (3.62.10). The mantra is named for its vedic gƒÅyatrƒ´ metre as: #the verse can be interpreted to invoke the deva Savitr, it is often called SƒÅvitrƒ´ #recitation is traditionally preceded by o·πÉ and the formula bh≈´r bhuva·∏• sva·∏•, known as the mahƒÅvyƒÅh·πõti (\\"great utterance\\"). The Gayatri Mantra is repeated and cited very widely in vedic literature, #this is praised in several well-known classical Hindu texts such as the Manusm·πõti, Harivamsa and Bhagavad Gita. The Kosi is associated with many ancient spiritual stories. It is mentioned in the Bal Kand section of Valmiki Ramayana as the Kausiki who is the form assumed by Satyavati after her death. Satyavati was the elder sister of Viswamitra, descendants of Kushak dynasty. In the Markandeya Purana, the Kosi is described as the primal force. Due to the violent nature of the Kosi during monsoon season, legend says that Parvati, the wife of Shiva, after defeating the demon Durg, became known as the warrior goddess Durga who transformed into Kaushiki. In Ramayana, the river Ganges is depicted as her elder sister. According to Mahabharata epic, the God of death took the form of a woman and resides on the banks of the river to limit population growth. Kosi resonates with the folklore of Mithila. The most important depictions of Kosi folklore are Kosi as a virgin absolutely care free and full of energy and as a frustrated wife of old hermit Richeek wandering in the Himalayas. Kosi is also invoked as the mother - 'Kosi Ma'. These images capture the contradiction that is inherent in the Kosi River as a source of life and death, prosperity and destruction; a mother and an enchanting virgin. It is also the lifeline of the Mithila region, today spread over more than half of India's state of Bihar. It is the subject of legend and folklore of the region; the legend of Mithila extends over many centuries. Mithila is also the name of a style of Hindu art created in the area.

The park covers an area of and ranges in elevation from to at the summit of Mount Everest. Established in 1976 the park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. The landscape in the park is rugged consisting of mountain peaks, glaciers, rivers, lakes, forests, alpine scrubs and meadows. The forests comprise stands of oak, blue pine, fir, birch, juniper and rhododendron. The park provides habitat for snow leopards, red pandas, musk deer, Himalayan tahrs, and 208 bird species including impeyan pheasant, bearded vulture, snow cock, and the yellow-billed chough. About 3500 Sherpa people live in villages and seasonal settlements situated along the main tourist trails. Tourism to the region began in the early 1960s. In 2003, about 19,000 tourists arrived in the area.Byers, A. (2005). Contemporary human impacts on Alpine ecosystems in the Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) national park, Khumbu, Nepal.

The novel follows the story of a young girl named Tita, who longs for her lover, Pedro, but can never have him because of her mother's upholding of the family tradition: the youngest daughter cannot marry, but instead must take care of her mother until she dies. Tita is only able to express herself when she cooks. Esquivel employs magical realism to combine the supernatural with the ordinary throughout the novel. Plot The book is divided into 12 sections named after the months of the year, starting in January and ending in December. Each section begins with a Mexican recipe. The chapters connect each dish to an event in the protagonist's life. Tita de la Garza, the novel's main protagonist, is 15 at the start of the story. She lives on a ranch near the Mexico‚ÄîUS border with her mother, Mam√° Elena, and her older sisters Gertrudis and Rosaura. Pedro is their neighbor, with whom Tita falls in love at first sight. The feeling turns out to be mutual, so Pedro asks Mam√° Elena for Tita‚Äôs hand in marriage. Unfortunately, she forbids it, citing the de la Garza family tradition that the youngest daughter (in this case, Tita) must remain unmarried and take care of her mother until her mother's death. She suggests that Pedro marry Tita's sister, Rosaura, instead. In order to stay close to Tita, Pedro decides to follow this advice. Tita has a deep connection with food and a love for cooking, enhanced by the fact that Tita's primary caretaker as a child was Nacha, the family cook. Her love for cooking also comes from the fact that she was born in the kitchen. In preparation of the wedding, Tita is forced to prepare the cake with Nacha. While preparing the cake, Tita is overcome with sadness, and cries into the cake batter. At the wedding, everyone gets violently sick, vomiting everywhere. Suspecting Tita was behind the incident, Mama Elena punishes Tita. After the wedding, Nacha is found dead, with a picture of her fianc√©. Later, Pedro and Rosaura have a son, Roberto. Rosaura is unable to nurse Roberto, so Tita brings Roberto to her breast to stop the baby from crying. Tita begins to produce breast milk and is able to nurse the baby. This draws her and Pedro closer than ever. They begin meeting secretly, snatching their few times together by sneaking around the ranch and behind the backs of Mam√° Elena and Rosaura. Tita‚Äôs strong emotions become infused into her cooking, unintentionally affecting the people around her through her food. After one particularly rich meal of quail in rose petal sauce flavored with Tita‚Äôs erotic thoughts of Pedro, Gertrudis becomes inflamed with lust and leaves the ranch in order to make ravenous love to a revolutionary soldier on the back of a horse, later ending up in a brothel and subsequently disowned by her mother. Rosaura and Pedro are forced to leave for San Antonio, Texas, at the urging of Mam√° Elena, who suspects a relationship between Tita and Pedro. Rosaura loses her son Roberto and later becomes infertile from complications during the birth of her daughter, Esperanza. Upon learning the news of her nephew's death, whom she cared for herself, Tita blames her mother, who responds by smacking Tita across the face with a wooden spoon. Tita, destroyed by the death of her beloved nephew and unwilling to cope with her mother's controlling ways, secludes herself in the dovecote until the sympathetic Dr. John Brown soothes and comforts her. Mam√° Elena states there is no place for \\"lunatics\\" like Tita on the farm, and wants her to be institutionalized. However, the doctor decides to take care of Tita at his home instead. Tita develops a close relationship with Dr. Brown, even planning to marry him, but her underlying feelings for Pedro do not waver. While John is away, Tita loses her virginity to Pedro. A month later, Tita is worried she may be pregnant with Pedro‚Äôs child. Her mother's ghost taunts her, telling her that she and her child are cursed. Gertrudis visits the ranch for a special holiday and makes Pedro overhear about Tita‚Äôs pregnancy, causing Tita and Pedro to argue about running away together. This causes Pedro to get drunk and sing below Tita‚Äôs window while she is arguing with Mama Elena‚Äôs ghost. Just as she confirms she isn't pregnant and frees herself of her mother's grasp once and for all, Mam√° Elena's ghost gets revenge on Tita by setting Pedro on fire, leaving him bedridden for a while and behaving like ‚Äúa child throwing a tantrum‚Äù.Esquivel, p. 211 Meanwhile, Tita is preparing for John's return, and is hesitant to tell him that she cannot marry him because she is no longer a virgin. Rosaura comes to the kitchen while Tita is cooking and argues with her over Tita's involvement with Rosaura‚Äôs daughter Esperanza‚Äôs life and the tradition of the youngest daughter remaining at home to care for the mother until she dies, a tradition which Tita despises. She vows not to let it ruin her niece's life as it did hers. John and his deaf great-aunt come over and Tita tells him that she cannot marry him. John seems to accept it, ‚Äúreaching for Tita‚Äôs hand...with a smile on his face‚Äù.Esquivel, p. 223 Many years later, Tita is preparing for Esperanza‚Äôs and John's son Alex‚Äôs wedding to one another, now that Rosaura has died from digestive problems. During the wedding, Pedro proposes to Tita saying that he does not want to ‚Äúdie without making [Tita] [his] wife‚Äù.Esquivel, p. 236 Tita accepts and Pedro dies making love to her in the kitchen storage room right after the wedding. Tita is overcome with sorrow and cold, and begins to eat a box of candles. The candles are sparked by the heat of Pedro's memory, creating a spectacular fire that engulfs them both, eventually consuming the entire ranch. The narrator of the story is the daughter of Esperanza, nicknamed \\"Tita\\", after her great-aunt. She describes how, after the fire, the only thing that survived under the smoldering rubble of the ranch was Tita's cookbook, which contained all the recipes described in the preceding chapters.

Themes =Self-growth= At the beginning of the novel, Tita has been a generally submissive young lady. As the novel progresses, Tita learns to disobey the injustice of her mother, and gradually becomes more and more adept at expressing her inner fire through various means. Cooking through enlightenment she learned to express her feelings, and cope with her mother. =Violence= Mama Elena often resorts to violence as she forces Tita to obey her. Many of the responsibilities she imposes on Tita, especially those relating to Pedro and Rosaura's wedding, are blatant acts of cruelty, given Tita's pain over losing Pedro. Mama Elena meets Tita's slightest protest with angry tirades and beatings. If she even suspects that Tita has not fulfilled her duties, she beats her. One example is when she thought that Tita intentionally ruined the wedding cake. When Tita dares to stand up to her mother, blaming her for Roberto's death, Mama Elena smacks her across the face, breaking her nose. Since Mama Elena must protect herself and her family from bandits and revolutionaries, her cruelty could be interpreted for strength. Then again, Tita's later illusions indicate that Mama Elena's actions were far from typical and deeply scarred Tita. =Passion= The romantic love that is so exalted throughout the novel is forbidden by Tita's mother in order to blindly enforce the tradition that the youngest daughter be her mother's chaste guardian. However, the traditional etiquette enforced by Mama Elena is defied progressively throughout the novel. This parallels the setting of the Mexican Revolution growing in intensity. The novel further parallels the Mexican Revolution because during the Mexican Revolution the power of the country was in the hands of a select few and the people had no power to express their opinions. Likewise, in Like Water for Chocolate, Mama Elena represents the select few who had the power in their hands, while Tita represents the people because she had no power to express her opinions but had to obey her mother's rules. =Rebellion= Tita is born in the kitchen‚Äîa place that foreshadows her calling. Due to the tradition that requires the youngest daughter to care for her mother, Mama Elena forbids Tita from falling in love, marrying, or becoming pregnant, forcing her to work in the kitchen. As she becomes a young woman, Tita appears to conform to the gender role her mother expects; however, Tita rebels, creatively devising a way in which she can express her suppressed feelings and emotions through her cooking. She has the magical ability to send her desires and emotions into the food she prepares. Tita bakes the wedding cake for her sister Rosaura and the man she wishes she was marrying, Pedro. Deeply depressed about the fact that her sister is marrying her one true love, she places her feelings of despair and sadness into the wedding cake. When the guests eat the cake, they weep over their lost loves and eventually became intoxicated and sick. Another example of her inclusion of suppressed emotions into her cooking is when Tita‚Äôs blood infects the rose sauce and quail dinner that she serves to Pedro, Rosaura, and Gertrudis. Rosaura becomes physically ill while Getrudis is instantly aroused. Finally, as a result of Pedro devouring this food, he becomes aware of Tita‚Äôs feelings and has a better understanding of the passion and love that she has for him. Even though Tita is not allowed to share her intimate feelings, she conveys her passions to the world through the action of cooking and sharing her food.https://www.litcharts.com/lit/like-water-for-chocolate/themes/emotion- and-repression =Food= Food is also one of the major themes in the story which is seen throughout the story. It is used very creatively to represent the characters' feelings and situations. Due to the magical nature of food in the story, it has literal effects on the people eating the food in terms of infusing the cook Tita's emotions into the food which are thus transferred beyond the food into the hearts and minds of those who devour it. Meaning of title Like Water for Chocolates full title is: Like Water for Chocolate: A novel in monthly installments with recipes, romances and home remedies. The phrase \\"like water for chocolate\\" comes from the Spanish phrase como agua para chocolate. This is a common expression in many Spanish-speaking countries, and it means that one's emotions are on the verge of boiling over. In some Latin American countries, such as Mexico, hot chocolate is made not with milk, but with near-boiling water instead.  Reception  Writing for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley described the novel as an \\"overly rich fable\\", which \\"aims to portray the onset of Mexican feminism in 1910, but it's really just another hearth-set Cinderella story, one that connects cooking to sorcery and servitude\\". Publication history Like Water for Chocolate has been translated from the original Spanish into numerous languages; the English translation is by Carol and Thomas Christensen. The novel has sold close to a million copies in Spain and Hispanic America and at last count, in 1993, more than 202,000 copies in the United States.

It offered over 240 free-to-air (FTA) channels in its EPG.List of Free To Air channels broadcast from the UK This is a greater number than its competitors, Freesat, which has 200+, and Freeview, which has 70+. It also had up to six HD channels and used to have Sky Active interactive data service. The service was less-promoted than the subscription-based Sky satellite service. Service reach , the number of households with free-to-view satellite television is estimated by Ofcom to be 2.045 million, or 8.0% of households with television. This figure includes households with the BBC/ITV Freesat, Freesat from Sky, and churned Sky subscribers who kept their Sky Digiboxes to access free-to- view channels. Reception equipment This service requires use of the proprietary SkyHD or SD set-top box, to receive the FTA channels. Sky's boxes use the proprietary OpenTV EPG for interactive television services. The boxes are limited in some regards when compared to other satellite receivers, such as digital audio, video outputs, and the lack of the ability to use a dish motor and scan for channels not carried on the EPG. They also feature an EPG that contains all Sky channels, including pay-TV services which are not available to non-subscription viewers. Sky currently include a SkyHD Digibox with new FsfS installations. These boxes receive a selection of standard definition and HD channels, but do not record. Those who wish to have Sky+ functionality (recording & time-shifting) must buy their own box, requiring Sky to 'pair' their existing viewing card to the new box. In addition, use of the recording facilities of these PVRs also requires an ongoing monthly fee. =Viewing card= Freesat from Sky differentiates itself from Freesat not just by its use of Sky equipment but by offering both free-to-air and free-to- view channels. A card is included with installation or can be purchased direct from Sky. For security reasons the viewing cards are deactivated from time to time and reception of the encrypted free-to-view channels disabled. This requires the user to purchase a new viewing card at the current standard charge. Sky viewing cards used to access subscription services revert to acting as FsfS viewing cards upon cancellation of the subscription. The viewing card also ensures the correct region for regionalised services for BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 and S4C.  Extra channels  The following is a list of free-to-view channels on the FsfS platform. A viewing card is required to watch them. None of these channels are available on Freesat. BT broadband subscribers can also receive BT Sport using a FsfS viewing card. * Local TV channels * 4Music * Yesterday +1  Other features  * The viewing card can be used to receive the correct region on the main channel number for the following services: ** BBC One ** BBC Two ** ITV / STV / UTV ** Channel 4 / S4C Competition Freesat from Sky (FsfS) is a competitor to the BBC and ITV's Freesat service which also broadcasts from 28.2¬∞E and 28.5¬∞E and the DTT service Freeview. FsfS has five free-to-view channels which are not available on Freesat (see above) and a large number of free-to-air channels which are not directly listed in the Freesat EPG and need manual tuning to receive them. FsfS has over 240 free-to-air channels on its EPG, (which do not require either a viewing card nor a Sky receiver to watch), including Bloomberg Television and the Travel Channel, compared to 198 free-to-air channels on Freesat EPG. with the remaining free-to-air channels not available through the main EPG, and needing manual tuning by the user. Freeview digital terrestrial television has over 50 free-to-air channels but cannot be manually tuned into the free-to-air channels available. FsfS also pre-tunes the boxes to the correct regional services of broadcasters who offer regional services such as the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. which on Freesat requires the user manually to enter their postcode during set-up for these correct regional services. Conversely, there are some TV channels that are on Freeview but are not on the Sky EPG, including many adult-category services. Most programming is simulcast on adult-category channels on Sky, but with different channel names and broadcast times.

From 1920 the artist participated in exhibitions including those of the UNOVIS group (Vitebsk, 1920 and 1921; Moscow 1929, 1921 and 1922), Petrograd exhibitions, an International Exhibition of Decorative Art (held in Paris, 1925), the Exhibition of Soviet Porcelain (1926 and 1927), and the First Exhibition of Leningrad artists in the Russian Museum among others. He lived in Petrograd from 1923, and worked at the State Lomonosov Ceramics Factory.

It is coeducational and has 183,638 members, including 32,898 leaders (of whom 1,896 priests), 1,952 groups and 6,333 units, making it the country's largest Scout association. AGESCI was formed in 1974 upon the merger of the Associazione Scouts Cattolici Italiani (ASCI, founded in 1916) and the Associazione Guide Italiane (AGI, founded in 1943). Some ASCI and AGI leaders, who had disagreed with the merger (and, above all, opposed the principle of coeducation) and had refused to join AGESCI, formed the Associazione Italiana Guide e Scouts d'Europa Cattolici (AIGSEC or Scouts d'Europa) in 1976, along with disgruntled members of the early AGESCI. Since 1986, AGESCI has formed, along with the 12,000-strong non-denominational Corpo Nazionale Giovani Esploratori ed Esploratrici Italiani (CNGEI),http://www.cngei.it/chi-siamo.html the Italian Scout Federation (FIS), Italy's national member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). Affiliated to AGESCI are the S√ºdtiroler Pfadfinderschaft (SP), the Catholic association of the German-speaking minority in South Tyrol, and the Slovenska Zamejska Skavtska Organizacija (SZSO) serving Slovenes in Friuli-Venezia Giulia. In 1986 Pope John Paul II was given the Wood Badge insignia as honorary AGESCI leader. Organisation AGESCI has a federal structure, composed of regional sections, provincial/diocesan sections and local groups. The region with more AGESCI members is Veneto (13.3% of the total), followed by Emilia-Romagna (12.7%) and Lombardy (10.3%). As a result, 49.2% of AGESCI members are in Northern Italy (29.5% in Northeast Italy and 19.7% in Northwest Italy), 19.6% in Central Italy and 31.2% in Southern Italy and the Isles. Veneto is first also by groups (11.5%) and units (12.2%). There are three age ranges/units in AGESCI (and they are present in most groups): *L/C: Lupetti and/or Coccinelle (Wolf Cubs and/or Brownies), aged 8‚Äì11/12, organised into packs. *E/G: Esploratori and Guide (Explorers and Guides), aged 11/12‚Äì16, organised into troops and patrols. *R/S: Rover and Scolte (Rover Scouts and Ranger Guides), aged 16‚Äì21, organised into crews. Units can be only-male, only-female or coeducational. In the latter case they have to be led by a male leader and a female leader. Mono-sex E/G units are quite frequent (46% of the total in Liguria, 40% in Marche, 40% in Emilia-Romagna, 35% in Sardinia, 34% in Campania, 32% in Tuscany, 32% in Veneto, 29% Sicily, etc.). L/C mono-sex units are rare and are more likely in regions where the Coccinelle have a strong tradition and presence (23% in Marche, 22% in Sardinia, 16% in Emilia-Romagna, 13% in Campania, 11% in Sicily, etc.). Finally, R/S mono-sex units are even rarer (5% in Sicily, 4% in Campania, 3% in Apulia, 2% in Abruzzo, 1% in Calabria and Lazio and none in the remaining fourteen regions).http://www.agesci.org/downloads/2013-12-proposta-educativa-03.pdf Each group is co-ordinated by two group leaders and directed by a comunit√† capi (leaders' community), where all adult leaders and at least a priest belong. It meets quite often (weekly in most cases) to plan all educational activities in the group. Its work is driven by a multi-year (usually three- year) progetto educativo (educational plan), which gives a common thread to the programme of all units, ensuring a common focus across all age ranges. Rover scouts and ranger guides may join the leaders' community upon completing their education and leaving the crew; more specifically, this moment is marked by a ceremony called partenza (departure). In order to be awarded of the Wood Badge, scout leaders need to go through a lengthy training, mainly consisting of three formation camps, as well as a few years of service before, between and after these camps.

The company was formed on January 18, 1854.  Beginnings  After grappling with financial difficulties for many years, the company opened service between Bridge Street in Grand Rapids to Cedar Springs, Michigan, on December 25, 1867, a distance of about . The gross earnings of the railroad in 1867 were about $22,700. In July 1868 it had 2 engines in service: the Pioneer and the Muskegon. At that time the company also utilized a single passenger coach and single baggage car, six box cars, 24 flat cars and five hand cars. By 1869 the railroad was again in trouble with its creditors, and the courts appointed a receiver, Jesse L. Williams of Fort Wayne, Indiana, to control the company. Under Williams' direction the Continental Improvement Company was hired on May 1, 1869, to complete the line between Fort Wayne and Little Traverse Bay in Michigan. Fifty-one days later, on June 21, 1869, the Continental Improvement Company had laid the last rail connecting Cedar Springs to Morley, Michigan. Williams was discharged as receiver on June 20, 1871.  Expansion  Map showing the Grand Rapids & Indiana Railroad, and its connections. Published 1871 The track from the south into Grand Rapids was completed September 13, 1870. The line extended north to Big Rapids, Michigan, by October 1, 1870, and a train first traveled between Fort Wayne and Big Rapids on that date. In June 1871, the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad Company took control of the road and property of the Cincinnati, Richmond and Fort Wayne Railroad Company, extending the line south to Cincinnati. The Traverse City Rail Road Company, a branch providing service between Walton Junction on the main line to Traverse City, was completed in December 1872, bringing a wave of immigration to that area. This branch offered service to Traverse City, Northport and many towns between by 1909. The line between Paris and Petoskey, Michigan, was completed November 25, 1873. The road was opened to Mackinaw City, Michigan, and the Straits of Mackinac on July 3, 1882. The total length of the line at this time was . In 1886 the company added an \\"airline\\" branch from Grand Rapids to Muskegon, Michigan, allowing travel between the two cities in about 1 hour. As of July 1888, the railroad had expanded its fleet to 66 locomotives and 3,100 cars. Its gross earnings were close to $2.3 million in 1887. In 1891 the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad featured the longest North-South line in the country. The railroad served to accelerate the settlement of Northern Michigan, which was largely a wilderness in the mid-19th century. On July 2, 1896, the Grand Rapids & Indiana Railroad reorganized as the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railway.  Lumber to tourism  GR&I; Advertising Poster with map and schedule During the last quarter of the 19th century, Northern Michigan had few residents, but the railroad netted a profit of over $300,000 as early as 1876. Most of the profit came from hauling lumber from northern Michigan south. The 244,000 tons of lumber hauled in 1876 represented 70 percent of the railroad's freight business for that year, and shipping forest products remained the main source of business for the railroad for the next decade. By the late 1880s the forests were depleted and the railroad began to depend more on tourist business. Even before completing the line to Mackinac City, the railroad marketed itself as \\"The Fishing Line\\" and published tourist guides advertising the fishing opportunities and resorts along its line. In 1886 the Grand Rapids & Indiana joined with the Michigan Central Railroad, which had built its own line into Mackinaw City in 1881 and the Detroit and Cleveland Navigation Company to form the Mackinac Island Hotel Company. This new company built the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, which opened in 1887.  Decline  the Northland Limited in Petoskey, Michigan By 1907 four passenger trains were running north to and from Mackinaw City daily. Passenger train fares were not enough to support the railroad and ridership declined. In 1909 the railroad reported a profit of 24.4 cents for every passenger for each mile carried; by 1921 the railroad was losing 19.5 cents per passenger mile. The Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad was bought by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1918. For several decades in the 20th century, ending in 1961, the PRR operated the Northern Arrow (Mackinaw City -- Cincinnati) on much of the route. In 1975 the Michigan Department of Transportation bought the railroad and it largely ceased operation in 1984, although the portion of track from Cadillac north to Petoskey is operated by Great Lakes Central Railroad. The Michigan Northern Railway also operated some of the GR&I; system until the mid-1980s in northern Michigan. During the 1990s much of the old railroad right of way between the north side of Grand Rapids and Cadillac, Michigan, was turned into the White Pine Trail State Park.

He was twice the Royal Governor of Chile. Early life He was the son of Hernado Camba de Quiroga and of Mar√≠a L√≥pez de Ulloa. In the year 1535 he traveled to Peru and participated in the exploration of Gran Chaco in the expedition of Diego de Rojas. A year later, he accompanied a group led by the conquistador Francisco de Aguirre as they made their way to Chile. This group met up with Pedro de Valdivia in Atacama. In Chile Quiroga participated in the military actions of the conquest of Chile, during the first part of the War of Arauco, coming to be one of the most important captains of the district. From 1548 he held a number of important posts in the administration in Santiago. Three times he was mayor, amongst other duties. He married In√©s de Su√°rez, the famous mistress of Pedro de Valdivia, when the Viceroy of Peru at the time ordered that Valdivia end the scandalous relationship or face excommunication. At the death of Valdivia at the hands of the Mapuches at the Battle of Tucapel, the citizens of southern Chile followed the instructions of his will and announced Francisco de Villagra as their leader. However, in Santiago, the ruling cabildo ignored these recommendations and proclaimed Quiroga as governor. It was thus that there were for a time two governors in Chile: Villagra in the south and Quiroga in the north. The situation ended upon the return of Villagra from the southern war zone to reclaim his right to govern. The cabildo awarded him this right and obliged Quiroga to relinquish his power, which Quiroga grudgingly did. In 1565, the Viceroy Lope Garc√≠a de Castro sent reinforcements from Peru under the command of general Jer√≥nimo de Castilla. Castilla had orders to arrest Pedro de Villagra (the uncle of Francisco who had risen to the post of governor while protected by the previous Viceroy), and put Quiroga in his place. In these circumstances, Villagra saw that he was too weak to defend his title, so he ceded his power to Quiroga and went to Peru. =First government= Alonso de Ovalle's 1646 engraving of Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza, Pedro de Villagra and Rodrigo de Quiroga This first government (not counting the earlier one, which was never imbued with real power) lasted until 1567. It was marked by constant clashes with the Indians, which often resulted in victories. Quiroga launched a new campaign, organized by Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado. He built forts at Lebu, Quiapo, reconstructed Ca√±ete, and repopulated Arauco in 1566. He accomplished the conquest of the island of Chilo√©, sending his Lieutenant Governor Mart√≠n Ruiz de Gamboa to establish the city of Castro there, and pacifying its inhabitants, the docile Cuncos. Despite these triumphs, the court did not recognize his strengths, and upon returning to the capital, he found that the Real Audiencia of Chile had replaced him. For a while, he retreated from political life and dedicated himself to business. =Second government= In 1575, however, as a result of a dispute between the Real Audiencia and the governor at the time, Melchor Bravo de Saravia, he was called a second time to take charge of the Reino of Chile. He was sworn in that same year in front of the cabildo. Quiroga's second administration was more turbulent then the first. In addition to the ongoing war of Arauco, there were incursions by pirates, two earthquakes (in 1575) and a dispute with the bishop of San Miguel over the naming of ecclesiastical posts and the reduction of the income of the clerics, which put him in danger of excommunication. Spain promised to send him 500 reinforcements to decisively end the war, but only 300 arrived. In addition, this smaller force was of much lesser quality than hoped and was almost completely without equipment. Overcoming these difficulties and his sickness (he had to be carried by chair to the battlefield), Quiroga launched a new offensive against the Mapuches, this time led by their toqui the mestizo Alonso D√≠az. The campaign had relative success, which allowed Quiroga to confront another menace, the appearance of Sir Francis Drake off the Chilean coasts. Drake managed to sack the port of Valpara√≠so, but when he tried to repeat the action at La Serena, he encountered the armed resistance of the inhabitants, and was repulsed. =Valdivia earthquake= On December 16, 1575 an earthquake struck southern Chile, and ruined the cities of La Imperial, Villarrica, Osorno, Castro, and specially the city of Valdivia, where the quake caused a landslide that plugged the drainage of Lake Ri√±ihue. The water then accumulated until it eventually destroyed this natural dam, creating a secondary flood and disaster. Later life Quiroga's grave sickness impeded him from continuing to direct the war, and he handed the task over to his son-in-law Mart√≠n Ruiz de Gamboa. Prostrated in his bed by his pain, in his last days he dedicated himself to religious observance, circled by monks to whose monasteries he would give a majority of his goods. He died quietly on February 25, 1580. His wife, In√©s de Su√°rez, would die the same year.

He served as a Labor Party Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1991 until his death in 1994, representing the electoral district of Parramatta. He was one of three New South Wales MPs to die that year, with John Newman (47) dying close before and Tony Doyle (41) following soon after. He was succeeded in office by his wife, Gabrielle Harrison. Private life Ziolkowski was born in Forbes, New South Wales, the son of Wladyslaw Ziolkowski - a Polish immigrant - and his wife Roma Ziolkowski. He moved to Parramatta, in western Sydney, as a child. He grew up in Parramatta, and attended St Patrick's Primary School and Parramatta Marist High School. Early years After finishing school he worked as a Process Worker for Alcan in Granville and as a Steelworks Tradesman's Assistant for BHP in Wollongong. Ziolkowski's political career began as a result of his involvement in trade unions and student politics. He attended university at Macquarie University, where he sat on the executive of the Students' Council and edited the student newspaper, Arena. It was during his student days that Ziolkowski met his future wife, Gabrielle Harrison, who was chairman of the Student Union at the time. NSW Premier Bob Carr would later tell Parliament, \\"Andrew was editor of the Macquarie University student newspaper Arena, while Gabrielle continued as the president of the Students' Union. I understand that his wife got a lot of coverage in the student paper.\\" Ziolkowski married Harrison on 30 November 1985 and she elected to keep her own name. After university, Ziolkowski, who had been involved in Young Labor at university, found work as an Industrial Research Officer for the then-Federal Member for Parramatta, The Hon. John Brown. In 1990 he was appointed a union official for the Transport Workers Union of Australia. State politics Ziolkowski was elected Member for Parramatta in 1991. At the age of 27 he was the youngest person ever elected to the New South Wales Parliament, and his difficult-to- pronounce surname soon saw him dubbed \\"Zorro\\" by fellow MPs. In July 1993, Ziolkowski advised the Leader of the Opposition, Bob Carr, that he had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, affecting the esophagus and by September 1993 was forced by illness to stop attending parliament. He finally succumbed in early 1994 at the age of 30. Ziolkowski's death resulted in a by-election on held on 27 August 1994, which his wife, Gabrielle Harrison, went on to win. He was survived by his wife and a son, Tristan, then aged 7. In her maiden speech to Parliament, Harrison stated :Andrew had hoped to publicly thank the staff of ward C5C at Westmead Hospital for their dedication and many acts of kindness. It is appropriate that I do that tonight on his behalf.

She was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1957 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1977, the third and the second highest civilian honours given by the Government of India. In 1981 she was awarded the Sangeetha Kalasikhamani award of The Indian Fine Arts Society, Chennai. Early life and background Balasaraswati was a seventh generation representative of a traditional matrilineal family of temple musicians and dancers (devadasis, who traditionally enjoyed high social status), who have been described as the greatest single repository of the traditional performing arts of music and dance of the southern region of India. Her ancestor, Papammal, was a musician and dancer patronized in the mid-eighteenth century by the court of Thanjavur. Her grandmother, Veenai Dhanammal (1867‚Äì1938), is considered by many to be the most influential musician of the early twentieth century. Her mother, Jayammal (1890‚Äì1967) was a singer who encouraged the training of Balasaraswati and was her accompanist. Balasaraswati created a revolution in traditional music and dance for bharata natyam, a combination of the performance arts of music and dance. She learned music within the family from her infancy, and her rigorous training in dance was begun when she was four under the distinguished dance teacher K. Kandappan Pillai, a member of the famed Thanjavur Nattuvanar family. Her younger brothers were the musicians T. Ranganathan and T. Viswanathan who would both become prominent performers and teachers in India and the United States. Her daughter, Lakshmi Knight (1943‚Äì2001), became a distinguished performer of her mother's style. Her grandson Aniruddha Knight continues to perform the family style today, and is artistic director of Bala Music and Dance Association in the United States and the Balasaraswati School of Dance in India. Her son-in-law Douglas M. Knight, Jr. has written her biography with the support of a Guggenheim Fellowship (2003). Famous Indian film maker Satyajit Ray made a documentary on her works. Career Balasaraswati's debut took place in 1925. She was the first performer of her traditional style outside of South India, performing first in Calcutta in 1934. As a young teenager, she was seen by choreographer Uday Shankar, who became an ardent promoter of her performances, and throughout the 1930s she captured the imagination of audiences across India. She went on to a global career that attracted international critical attention and the respect of dance greats such as Shambhu Maharaj, Dame Margot Fonteyn, Martha Graham, and Merce Cunningham. Interest in Bharatanatyam rebounded in the 1950s as the public became interested in promoting a unique Indian art form. Balasaraswati, encouraged by an administrator at the Music Academy in Madras, established a dance school in association with the institution. There she trained new dancers in bharata natyam as per her vision. In the early 1960s she increasingly travelled globally, with performances in East Asia, Europe, and North America. Later that decade, throughout the 1970s, and into the early 1980s, she visited the United States repeatedly and held residencies‚Äîas both a teacher and a performer‚Äîat Wesleyan University (Middletown, Connecticut), California Institute of the Arts (Valencia), Mills College (Oakland, California), the University of Washington (Seattle), and Jacob‚Äôs Pillow Dance Festival (Beckett, Massachusetts), among other institutions. Through her international engagements as well as her activities in India, especially in Madras, Balasaraswati not only exposed countless audiences to the traditional style of bharata natyam but also trained many new practitioners of the art form. She received numerous awards in India, including the President's Award from the Sangeet Natak Akademi (1955), Padma Vibushan from the Government of India for distinguished national service (1977) and Sangita Kalanidhi from the Madras Music Academy, South India's highest award for musicians (1973). In a review in 1977, the New York Times dance critic Anna Kisselgoff described her as one of the \\"supreme performing artists in the world\\". India Today, one of the leading news magazine of India, based on a survey, classified her as one of the 100 prominent Indians who have shaped the destiny of India. She was the only non-western dancer included in a compilation of the Dance Heritage Coalition, \\"America's Irreplaceable Dance Treasures: The First 100\\" (2000). * Dancing in India * Bharatanatyam * Mani Madhava Chakyar In popular culture Bengali film director Satyajit Ray made a documentary film on Balasaraswati named Bala (1976).

The game was revealed in JAMMA 2005. A Nintendo DS version was also later released. In the fall of 2008, Upper Deck Company released a Dinosaur King Trading Card Game. This card game is not to be confused with the cards used for the arcade machines.\\"Dinosaur King TCG Homepage,\\" Upper Deck The series has been adapted into an anime television series, . A second series was announced called \\",\\" which debuted February 3, 2008 in Japan. The show ended its run in Japan in late 2008. Game Story =Card game/Nintendo DS game= Dr. Spike Taylor was on a paleontology mission in Africa with his son Max and his friend Rex. Max discovers stone slabs and finds dinosaurs are calling them for help. An evil organization called the \\"Alpha Gang\\", led by the nefarious Dr. Z, traveled back in time to hunt down the dinosaurs and use them to take over the world. It is up to Max and Rex to travel around the world, defeating Dr. Z and the Alpha Gang while hunting down the dinosaurs (Later, the story varies as the arcade game machine keeps on upgrading). Anime Story =First season= Max Taylor is the son of paleontologist Dr. Spike Taylor. After falling out of bed early one morning and witnessing a meteor fall from the sky, Max sets out with his friends Rex Owen and Zoe Drake into a forest where the meteor had crashed. They find stones with the symbols for lightning, wind, and grass on them and a card with a picture of a Triceratops on it. The Triceratops that is later named Chomp is accidentally activated when Max rubs the card on the stone. The D-Team meet their new enemies in the Alpha Gang consisting of Dr. Z, Ursula, Zander, Ed, Seth, Laura, Rod, Helga, and the Alpha Droids. The Alpha Gang plans to obtain the Dinosaur Cards that were lost when their time machine exploded and stranded them in the present. Rex activated a Carnotaurus card which was named Ace and Zoe activated a Parasaurolophus which was named Paris. The D-Team and Alpha Gang often clash for possession of dinosaurs that are activated when their cards are activated. In the finale, Seth turns on his comrades with his Black Tyrannosaurus which is ultimately defeated. Seth attempts to bring Chomp back to the past which fails and Seth is sent into the past alone. The D-Team surrender their dinosaurs to Rex's original parents, with many tears. =Second season= In the second series, the Alpha Gang and the Ancients return. While the parents are talking, they are kidnapped by Gavro, a member of the Spectral Space Pirates. This causes the Alpha Gang and D-Team to join forces against the Space Pirates in their plot to obtain cosmic jewels known as the Cosmos Stones. Seth later returns as an ally to the Spectral Space Pirates after they saved him from the time portal. Spectre, the leader of the Space Pirates, provides the dinosaur cards. In episode 75, Seth seems to become a traitor as he appeals to the D-Team for help saying that they forced him to help them. However, it was really a trick to get the two Cosmos Stones in D-Team's control, despite the fact that he attacks and defeats his comrades two episodes later. In the end although the Spectral Space Pirates manage to catch all seven Cosmos Stones, Seth and the Pterosaur defeat the Black Pterosaur. Rex, his parents, and the Alpha Gang leave to their own time as the Spectral Space Pirates are floating around in a pod. Episodes Characters Gameplay There are different cards to collect and use in order to play Dinosaur King. The barcodes are located on the long edges of the cards for the player to scan them in the machine. There are four types of cards used in this game; Dinosaur, move, character and super move cards. Media The series was adapted into an anime television series, , which is made by Sunrise and premiered on TV Asahi on February 4, 2007.

It currently educates around 900 pupils and around 2,800 part-time adult learners.http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0042/00420794.xlsx Mike Irving has been head teacher since August 2017. History It is one of the oldest schools in Scotland, with its founding usually credited to 1560, though there are records of a Leith grammar school as early as 1521 (\\"maister of the gramer scule of Leith\\"). To begin with the school was under the control of the kirk session of South Leith Parish Church. It remained so until 1806. It is not known where the school met until 1636 when records make reference to meeting in Trinity House. The school met there until 1710 when, after a disagreement about rent, the kirk session decided to move the school to King James hospital which stood on what is now South Leith Parish churchyard. In 1792 the kirk agreed to a purpose-built building for the school. The building, by Robert Burn, beside Leith Links, was completed in 1806. The school changed its name to Leith Academy in 1888. The Leith Links school was demolished and replaced by a new building opened in 1898. In turn, due to continued growth in the number of pupils, by 1931 a new building was required and the school on the Duke Street site was built. The Links building is now used as Leith Primary School. The Duke Street school was used as part of Queen Margaret University College and has been (2014) converted to flats. The school's current building, off Easter Road, was completed in 1991 after much campaigning by staff, students and parents. The school was founded by South Leith Parish Church, and strong links remain to this day, with the school's annual Christmas assembly being held there. Building The current Leith Academy building was completed in May 1991. The building incorporated the design principles of ‚Äúplanning for change‚Äù developed by the OECD Programme on Educational Building (PEB). It features an innovative design based around a \\"Main Street\\" leading from one end of the school to the other with all departments and facilities leading off it. The Main Street has a glass roof and is lined on either side by plants which looks like a jungle. The school has a swimming pool that can be seen through windows on the right of the main street. These plants were featured on the BBC Television programme The Beechgrove Garden.

It is an open protocol managed by the Ethernet POWERLINK Standardization Group (EPSG). It was introduced by Austrian automation company B&R; in 2001. This protocol has nothing to do with power distribution via Ethernet cabling or power over Ethernet (PoE), power line communication, or Bang & Olufsen's PowerLink cable.  Overview  Ethernet Powerlink expands Ethernet with a mixed polling and timeslicing mechanism. This provides: * Guaranteed transfer of time-critical data in very short isochronic cycles with configurable response time * Time- synchronisation of all nodes in the network with very high precision of sub- microseconds * Transmission of less timecritical data in a reserved asynchronous channel Modern implementations reach cycle-times of under 200 ¬µs and a time-precision (jitter) of less than 1 ¬µs.  Standardization  Powerlink was standardized by the Ethernet Powerlink Standardization Group (EPSG) and founded in June 2003 as an independent association. Working groups focus on tasks like safety, technology, marketing, certification and end users. The EPSG cooperates with the standardization bodies and associations, like the CAN in Automation (CiA) Group and the IEC.  Physical layer  The original physical layer specified was 100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet. Since the end of 2006, Ethernet Powerlink with Gigabit Ethernet supported a transmission rate ten times higher (1,000 Mbit/s). Repeating hubs instead of switches within the Real-time domain is recommended to minimise delay and jitter. Ethernet Powerlink uses IAONA's Industrial Ethernet Planning and Installation Guide for clean cabling of industrial networks and both industrial Ethernet connectors 8P8C (commonly known as RJ45) and M12 are accepted.  Data link layer  The standard Ethernet data link layer is extended by an additional bus scheduling mechanism, which secures that at a time only one node is accessing the network. The schedule is divided into an isochronous phase and an asynchronous phase. During the isochronous phase, time-critical data is transferred, while the asynchronous phase provides bandwidth for the transmission of non time-critical data. The Managing Node (MN) grants access to the physical medium via dedicated poll request messages. As a result, only one single node (CN) has access to the network at a time, which avoids collisions, present on older Ethernet hubs before switches. The CSMA/CD mechanism of non-switched Ethernet, which caused non-deterministic Ethernet behaviour, is avoided by the Ethernet Powerlink scheduling mechanism.  Basic cycle  After system start-up is finished, the Real-Time domain is operating under Real-Time conditions. The scheduling of the basic cycle is controlled by the Managing Node (MN). The overall cycle time depends on the amount of isochronous data, asynchronous data and the number of nodes to be polled during each cycle. The basic cycle consists of the following phases: * Start Phase: The Managing Node is sending out a synchronization message to all nodes. The frame is called SoC‚ÄîStart of Cycle. * Isochronous Phase: The Managing Node calls each node to transfer time-critical data for process or motion control by sending the Preq - Poll Request - frame. The addressed node answers with the Pres - Poll Response - frame. Since all other nodes are listening to all data during this phase, the communication system provides a producer-consumer relationship. The time frame which includes Preq-n and Pres-n is called time slot for the addressed node. * Asynchronous Phase: The Managing Node grants the right to one particular node for sending ad-hoc data by sending out the SoA‚ÄîStart of Asynchronous‚Äîframe. The addressed node will answer with ASnd. Standard IP-based protocols and addressing can be used during this phase. The quality of the Real-Time behavior depends on the precision of the overall basic cycle time. The length of individual phases can vary as long as the total of all phases remain within the basic cycle time boundaries. Adherence to the basic cycle time is monitored by the Managing Node. The duration of the isochronous and the asynchronous phase can be configured. File:epl cycle-3.png Picture 1: Frames above the time line are sent by the MN, below the time line by different CNs. File:epl cycle-2.png Picture 2: Time slots for nodes and the asynchronous time slot Multiplex for Bandwidth Optimization In addition to transferring isochronous data during each basic cycle, some nodes are also able to share transfer slots for better bandwidth utilization. For that reason, the isochronous phase can distinguish between transfer slots dedicated to particular nodes, which have to send their data in every basic cycle, and slots shared by nodes to transfer their data one after the other in different cycles. Therefore, less important yet still time-critical data can be transferred in longer cycles than the basic cycle. Assigning the slots during each cycle is at the discretion of the Managing Node. File:epl cycle-1.png Picture 3: Time slots in EPL multiplexed mode. Poll response chaining Mode used mainly for robotics applications and large superstructures. Key is lower number of frames and better data distributions.  OpenSAFETY  Today, machines, plants and safety systems are stuck in a rigid scheme made up of hardware-based safety functions. The consequences of this are cost-intensive cabling and limited diagnostic options. The solution is the integration of safety relevant application data into the standard serial control protocol. OpenSAFETY allows both publish/subscriber and client/server communication. Safety relevant data is transmitted via an embedded data frame inside of standard communication messages. Measures to avoid any undetected failures due to systematic or stochastic errors are an integral part of a functional safety protocol. OpenSAFETY is in conformance with IEC 61508. The protocol fulfills the requirements of SIL 3. Error detection techniques have no impact on existing transport layers.

It is on the east (Irish Sea) coast of the Ards Peninsula between Donaghadee and Ballyhalbert. Ballywalter was formerly known as Whitkirk as far back as the 12th century. It had a population of 2,027 people in the 2011 census. Etymology The name of the village is derived from the Irish Baile Bhaltair meaning Walter's townland. This may have been a gaelicisation of Walter(s)ton. The name Walter was common among the Anglo-Normans who began to arrive in Ireland in the late 1100s. The taxation of Pope Nicholas IV known as Taxatio Ecclesiastica and compiled in 1291-1292 refers to Rector ville Walteri de Logan, i.e. ‚Äòthe rector of Walter- de-Logan‚Äôs town‚Äô.  Places of interest  On the northern edge of Ballywalter is the townland of Whitechurch (which has been translated as Whitkirk in Ulster Scots). Within this townland is the Whitechurch graveyard, an important burial place. The oldest gravestone is to John Cooper who had emigrated from Scotland to Ireland in 1606. He died aged 90 in 1608. The graveyard also contains the graves of several United Irishmen who were killed in a battle in Newtownards in 1798. Inside the church, there is a headstone to Arthur Lusks who sailed around the world in 1753 with George Anson. On the southern edge of the village is Ballywalter Park. It is open to the public, by appointment only, as the Mulholland family still lives on the estate. The house is the ancestral seat of The 6th Baron Dunleath. The park plays host to the Northern Ireland Game Fair, which has attracted nearly 40,000 people over a single weekend. Ballywalter Park is a Grade A listed stately home, deemed to be of exceptional architectural importance.  History  = Irish Rebellion of 1798= On the morning of 10 June 1798 (known thereafter as \\"Pike Sunday\\"), a force of United Irishmen, mainly from Bangor, Donaghadee, Greyabbey and Ballywalter, attempted to occupy the town of Newtownards. They were met with musket fire from the market house and among those killed was James Cain, an 18-year old man from Ballyferris outside Ballywalter. Cain was buried in Whitechurch graveyard. The extent to which the people of Ballywalter were involved in the 1798 Rebellion is illustrated by an announcement in the Freeman's Journal on 11 August 1798, which stated: \\"...the magnitude of the punishment of many districts of County Down may be conceived from this single fact-of the inhabitants of the little village of Ballywalter nine men were actually killed and thirteen returned wounded, victims of their folly. If a trifling village suffered so much what must have been the aggregate loss in those parts of the country which were in a state of rebellion.\\" A number of Presbyterian ministers in the Ards were deemed to have taken part in the rebellion and were tried, found guilty, and executed. Among the executed was a minister from near Ballywalter, Rev. Robert Goudy of Dunover. After the insurrection, bands of soldiers and yeomen scoured the country looking for United Irishmen. It is said locally that some Ballywalter men escaped capture by spending days at sea, hiding behind the Long Rock. =Lifeboat= It is recorded that the Ballywalter lifeboat saved 154 lives between the late 1800's and its disbandment. By 1906, the coastguards had been withdrawn from the village and there was some difficulty in finding a crew to man the lifeboat, so it too was withdrawn.

Mission and function Through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer review, and coordinate their regulatory oversight. NAIC staff supports these efforts and represents the collective views of state regulators domestically and internationally. NAIC members, together with the central resources of the NAIC, form the national system of state-based insurance regulation in the U.S. The NAIC is an Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The 2019 NAIC president is Eric A. Cioppa, who is also the superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance. The NAIC acts as a forum for the creation of model laws and regulations. Each state decides whether to pass each NAIC model law or regulation, and each state may make changes in the enactment process, but the models are widely, albeit somewhat irregularly, adopted. The NAIC also acts at the national level to advance laws and policies supported by state insurance regulators. The NAIC also is responsible for creating the statutory accounting principles (SAP) upon which insurance accounting is based. SAP is often contrasted with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and is notable for its very conservative valuation methods. Additionally, the NAIC promulgates the NAIC annual statement which incorporates SAP and must be filed with the department of insurance in every state in which an insurance company writes business. The NAIC is not a regulator; while its members are the insurance commissioners (i.e., the chief insurance regulators) of each U.S. state and six territories, the NAIC is a non-governmental organization that concerns itself with insurance regulatory matters but does not actually regulate. The states have not delegated their regulatory authority to the NAIC. Although the NAIC's mandate is to benefit state regulators and insurance consumers by promoting uniform laws and regulations, by promoting uniformity of regulation among the states, it also makes it easier for insurance companies to comply with the laws and regulations in all states in which they do business. = National meetings and publications = The NAIC holds three national meetings a year, in the spring, summer, and fall throughout the United States. Members of state insurance departments, NAIC staff, and insurance industry representatives gather to learn about new, upcoming NAIC initiatives on emerging topics in the field of insurance regulation. During the meeting, committees, task forces, and working groups gather to discuss and review drafts of new and revised model laws, guidelines, and white papers. All amendments and committee actions are recorded in a memorandum and made available on the NAIC website. Following every national meeting, the official Proceedings of the NAIC is published. The Proceedings serve as the permanent record of all NAIC actions, including model laws and regulations, as well as committee and task force minutes and reports. The current and some archival issues of the Proceedings are publicly available for download in PDF format on the NAIC Publications department website.  History  After Paul v. Virginia, state insurance commissioners formed the National Insurance Convention in 1871 to coordinate; this became the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners and then the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. During the first session, a uniform annual statement was adopted and life insurance companies but not fire insurance companies were required to make reserve deposits to protect their policyholders. In the second session a model law was passed; many states adopted a standard fire insurance policy known as the New York Standard Fire Policy of 1886. It has been argued that the policy was designed to favor the industry, as it contains various conditions which, if not adhered to, render the policy void. Organization structure and officers National Association of Insurance Commissioners was incorporated in Delaware on October 6, 1999.\\"National Association of Insurance Commissioners\\".

Officers of NAIC include a president, president-elect, vice president, and secretary-treasurer, who are elected annually by the membership by secret ballot. To help organize NAIC's efforts, the United States has been divided into four geographic zones: Northeastern, Southeastern, Midwestern and Western; each zone has its own chair, vice chair and secretary who sit on the NAIC's executive committee.

Career Barry Shepherd was an outstanding junior sportsman in Australian rules football, hockey and cricket. Twice representing Western Australia in schoolboy football, he won the medal for best player at the carnival on the first year of his selection (in Tasmania). He was runner-up for the same medal the following year (in Melbourne). The Richmond Football Club showed significant interest in recruiting him. He also represented Western Australia in hockey, winning all Australian selection as a full back. Cricket was the sport which he decided to pursue and he made his debut for Western Australia at age 17. He later captained the State with distinction. Known as a fierce competitor, he instilled in Western Australian cricket the will and self belief which made subsequent on field success possible. He made his Test debut in the 1962‚Äì63 Ashes series, replacing Peter Burge in the batting line up. He made a vital 71 not out in the first innings when the England off-spinner Fred Titmus was running through the Australian batting order, taking 7/79. Ironically, the England team had tried to play Shepherd into the team and thought they had failed by getting him out cheaply in tour matches. He made only 23 more runs in the series and was replaced by Burge in the Fifth Test, but his 94 runs (47.00) put him third in the Australian batting averages.

He was affiliated with the company for over 64 years, and was a board member from 1973 to 2003. He was a grandson of Adolph Coors (1847‚Äì1929), the company's founder. Biography Born in Golden, Colorado on August 11, 1916, he was the son of Adolph Coors II and Alice Kistler May (1885‚Äì1970), and the brother of Adolph Coors III (1915‚Äì60) and Joseph Coors Sr. (1917‚Äì2003). Coors earned a bachelor's degree from Princeton University in 1938, and a master's degree in chemical engineering in 1939. Coors had three daughters with his first wife Geraldine, who suffered from alcoholism and died of illness. William remarried in the 1960s and he and his wife, Phyllis, had one son, Scott. Coors' oldest daughter Geraldine committed suicide August 5, 1983 at the age of 40 after suffering from depression. Bill Coors climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in 1974 at age 58, as part of his pursuit of physical and spiritual health in the 1970s.R. Banham, Coors: A Rocky Mountain Legend, Greenwich Publishing Group Inc., 1998, , p 79. The experience inspired him to establish the Coors Wellness Center for employees and retirees of Adolph Coors Co. in a former grocery store building just outside the brewery property in 1981. Coors turned 100 in August 2016 and died on October 13, 2018, aged 102.William \\"Bill\\" Coors, brewing industry leader, dies at 102https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/obituaries/william- coors-dies-at-102.html Career William Coors entered the family business as a chemical engineer for Coors Brewing Company in 1939. Coors was respected in the industry for his ability in packaging, bottling, and engineering. He is credited with pioneering the recyclable two-piece aluminum can, which is now standard throughout the industry. In the 1950s, Coors requested $250,000 from his father, CEO Adolph Coors, Jr., to build an experimental line of aluminum cans. By the early 1960s, can recycling was viable, and the company offered customers a one-cent deposit on returned cans. Coors was elected to the board of directors in 1973. When the non-brewing assets (e.g., Coors Ceramics Co.) of Adolph Coors Co. were spun off in 1992 as ACX Technologies Inc., he served as chairman of both companies. In 2003, at the age of 87, Coors retired from the boards of the Adolph Coors Company and the Coors Brewing Company, although he remained with the company as chief technical adviser. Political views William Coors' political views were considered to be more moderate and less outspoken than his brother Joe's. For example, Joe's public opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment in 1988 earned the company the ire of feminist groups, even though William was on record supporting the amendment. =Accusations of racism= Coors was criticized for remarks he made on February 23, 1984, in a seminar held by the Minority Business Development Center in Denver. In off- the-cuff remarks, he stated that \\"...ancestors were dragged here in chains against their will‚Ä¶ I would urge those of you who feel that way to go back to where your ancestors came from, and you will find out that probably the greatest favor that anybody ever did you was to drag your ancestors over here in chains, and I mean it.\\" He also remarked Africa's economic problems stemmed from \\"a lack of intellectual capacity.\\" Coors apologized in a press conference the next day for his \\"unfortunate choice of words and lack of sensitivity,\\" and said he hoped his commitment to minority groups spoke louder than his words. He stated that his words were taken out of context by the Rocky Mountain News, which he later sued for libel. A number of people who attended the speech reported that the remarks were not considered offensive. An informal boycott of Coors was announced by the NAACP during a March 2 meeting in Los Angeles. At the time, the AFL-CIO had been boycotting the company for seven years over a labor dispute. At least 500 liquor stores in Southern California joined the NAACP boycott, which was suspended five days later when they reached an agreement with the company. In September, the Adolph Coors Company signed an agreement with Operation PUSH and the NAACP to invest $325 million into black communities over five years, to deposit millions of operating capital in black-owned banks, and to spend $8.8 million on advertising in black-owned media. In October, the company negotiated a similar agreement with American GI Forum and La Raza for $300 million. This was the first ever such arrangement between La Raza and any corporation. In 1987, Coors dropped his libel suit after the Rocky Mountain News printed an article commending Coors' good record with the minority community, and expressing regret for the headline over the February 24, 1984 article.

This instrument from Kerala and Tamil Nadu in southern India is completely made out of bronze and has two pieces in it. Elathalam is played by keeping one part of the cymbal in left hand banging the other cymbal to the one in left hand.

It is located high on the Stoke Bishop site on the edge of the Bristol Downs, and houses c. 370 students in two quadrangles. Almost all of these students are in their first year of study. History The name Wills Hall reflects the university's connection with the Wills family. The fortune made by their famous tobacco empire, W. D. & H. O. Wills and later Imperial Tobacco, enabled Henry Overton Wills III to fund the University's foundation in 1908 with a pledge of ¬£100,000 and he financed many of its finest buildings, such as the Wills Memorial Building. His son George Alfred Wills provided the money to build a hall of residence in memory of his brother Henry Herbert Wills on the site of Downside House, formerly the residence of the Georges, a family of Bristol brewers. George Alfred Wills originally planned to base the residence around Goldney Hall in Clifton, next to Clifton Hill House. However, the Warden of the all-female Clifton Hill House felt that having so many young men so close to her residents would pose a significant risk and demanded that the new hall be sited at least two miles away. Thus Downside House in Stoke Bishop was purchased, and a quadrangle of accommodation blocks erected around it according to the design of Sir George Oatley, with the rooms arranged on staircases (called \\"houses\\", A to N). It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building. A Latin inscription on the exterior of the dining hall dedicated the hall to Henry Herbert. Downside House, once the Warden's Lodge, now temporary staff accommodation Wills Hall was officially opened by Winston Churchill in 1929, then the Chancellor of the University. When he returned to open Churchill Hall in the late 1950s, he allowed himself to be \\"kidnapped\\" and his \\"release\\" was allowed only after he signed the following statement, that used to be displayed in the Warden's House at Wills, but which is now in the University's Special Collections Department: :\\"I Winston Spencer Churchill MP, CH Chancellor of the University of Bristol, Declare There be No Finer Hostel Than Wills Hall Among The Universities of the British Empire\\".M. J. Crossley Evans (1994), A History of Wills Hall University of Bristol. University of Bristol. . The initial quadrangle sufficed until rising student numbers precipitated the building of a further accommodation block, an L-shaped configuration of three linked houses (X, Y and Z) which was opened in 1961. Another expansion, in 1990, included a further accommodation block arranged on three floors (U, V and W), which featured en-suite rooms and a conference centre, the better to place the University in the conference market, which was becoming an important source of revenue.. Together with X, Y and Z houses, the new development completed a quadrangle now known as New Quad, the original accommodation being Old Quad. At some points in the Hall's history the \\"Cambridge\\" tradition of referring to what Oxford calls \\"quads\\" as \\"courts\\" has predominated, and whilst at present the norm is to refer to \\"Old Quad\\" and \\"New Quad\\" for the accommodation blocks, the space next to the JCR Bar is still always known as the \\"Old Court Lounge\\". Wills was founded as an all-male institution and was the last hall to accept both sexes: it went mixed in 1985, despite opposition from some traditionalists, but with the enthusiastic support of most students. In that year, 70 women took up residence alongside 200 men, and over the next few years the numbers of women residents rose quickly. Wills today is usually equally balanced between the sexes. The first woman JCR president was Elise O'Connor, elected in 1986; one of the first women residents, Jane Thompson, became Deputy Warden in 1987. Facilities The Old Quad in the snow Back of Old Quad as seen from the Cedar Lawn Wills Hall has a bar that is open once a week and staffed by students and former residents. The bar also hosts JCR quizzes, film nights, sports broadcasts and other events. There are theme- nights, including alcohol-free events, \\"Bond Night\\", and a \\"White Party\\" for the whole hall. The Monica Wills Chapel was opened in 1930. It hosts a number of services a week (e.g. evensong, compline) for students from all the Stoke Bishop halls, usually on Friday evenings during term-time, and there are well- attended Christmas and Armistice events. It is also used to stage plays and concerts, and houses a grand piano and a harpsichord as well as a fully refurbished organ. Wills Hall has an oak-panelled dining room, often likened to that of an Oxbridge college, and the Hall's architect, Sir George Oatley, deliberately took inspiration from the proportions and styles of certain Oxford Colleges when making his designs. The Hall houses tennis and squash courts that are shared with the other halls on the Stoke Bishop Site; there is a croquet lawn (used for an annual croquet tournament, the \\"Morton / Relph cup\\"), a table tennis room, and an oak-panelled billiard room. The billiard room was constructed when Downside House was extended in the late 19th century and the fireplace still has the original De Morgan tiles. Motto Over the main entrance to Wills Hall can be seen a shield emblazoned with the Wills family crest and their motto \\"Pro Aris et Focis\\". This Latin phrase literally means \\"for our altars and our hearths\\", but is used by ancient authors to express attachment to all that was most dear and venerable. Student life Formals Formal Hall used to be a weekly tradition within Wills (and in earliest times was held every day), but in the period 2010-2018 \\"formals\\" were only held at most every two or three weeks, with some 14-15 such events each year. After the changes implemented by the pastoral review in autumn 2018, formal dinners have been reduced to c. 6 per annum, plus a \\"Returners' Formal\\" hosted by the Wills Hall Association. Dress has usually been black tie, and residents wear an academic gown. Latin grace (Benedictus benedicat and Benedicto benedicatur) is said at the beginning of dinner, and in the past there was always a speech during dessert, given either by the Warden or by a notable guest. Speeches were often on contemporary social and political issues, and rejoinders were invited from members of the Hall if the topic was controversial. Speeches are no longer delivered under the new pastoral system, and high table is no longer a focus for guests from within the university and beyond. Junior Common Room (JCR) The bar and adjacent Old Court Lounge comprises the \\"Junior Common Room\\". The phrase \\"Junior Common Room\\" also refers to the whole body of undergraduate residents of the Hall: they elect a JCR Committee annually, which organizes a wide variety of social events, parties, guest nights, debates and quizzes. It sponsors an annual summer event, recently arranged jointly with Badock Hall, the \\"Founders' Ball\\". Organ scholarship An Organ Scholarship is offered annually by the Hall, funded by donations from former members. The Organ Scholar will usually play for services and some concerts, as well as accompanying the carols at the annual Hall Christmas Formal. Societies The Hall's theatrical society, the Wills Hall Amateur Theatrical Society (WHATS), performs musicals, plays and variety shows for audiences from the Stoke Bishop halls and beyond. Recent productions include Jez Butterworth's Jerusalem in 2016. The discussion club \\"Barneys\\" (named after a brand of tobacco that rivalled the Wills products), dates back to the 1930s and is still active, with fortnightly speaker-meetings on Sundays in term time and an annual dinner at which a distinguished guest delivers a speech. Wills Hall used to publish its own newsletter, The Executor, which was edited by students in hall and was published several times a year. This was the successor to the Wills Hall Loo Sheet, a newsletter that took its name from the fact that it was distributed by being posted in all communal lavatories around the hall. In 2015, a satirical newspaper called The Oracle was published for two issues before being shut down. Wills Hall Association Former members of Wills Hall are eligible to join The Wills Hall Association, which has been running since 1930. The Association holds a reunion in Bristol every July, when former members return for a reception in one of the gardens followed by a black-tie dinner in Hall with a notable guest speaker. The Association also holds an annual reception in London in the autumn, a \\"young members\\" bar night in London, and a reception that used to be held in the Warden's House (usually in February or March) but will in future take place in the Dame Monica Wills Chapel following the recently instituted Arthur Graves Lecture. Colonel Graves was the fifth Warden of Wills, a kind and popular man, and donations from former residents have allowed the WHA to institute an annual lecture in his memory. The Association also held a dinner to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Hall's opening, which took place in December 2019, and was attended by old members and current residents alike. Lady Hale of Richmond, patron of the Wills Hall Association, attended as Guest of Honour. The Association produces a Yearbook and a Newsletter. Controversy In 2003, as part of the national controversy surrounding claims that British universities were discriminating in favour of public school applicants, The Observer ran an article purporting to highlight class-strife and prejudice in Wills. Letters in reply followed the next week vigorously defending Wills. In 2008 a Harrow-educated undergraduate at Wills Hall crashed a Mini Cooper in the grounds of the Hall while intoxicated. Vehicles (including the Warden's), beds and other unorthodox objects have mysteriously appeared on the lawn of the Old Quad on many occasions. In May 2017 a large iron sculpture of a dinosaur was transported at night from the Botanical Garden and placed in the centre of high table in the dining hall. In 2017 there were allegedly incidents of drink-spiking in the Hall's \\"welcome week\\", widely reported in the press. None could be medically confirmed as spiking. The Warden and other pastoral staff responded quickly and firmly and no further incidents were reported.Telegraph, 21/9/2017 https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/09/21/drink-spiking-spate-bristol- university-freshers-week-investigated/; Independent, 22/9/2017 https://www.independent.co.uk/student/freshers-week-drink-spiking-first-year- students-bristol-university-alcohol-date-rape-drugs-a7961436.html; BBC, 21/9/2017 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-41346677; The Tab, 20/9/2017 https://thetab.com/uk/bristol/2017/09/20/wills-hall-bar-hit-by- spiking-incidences-30389; Epigram, 20/9/17 http://epigram.org.uk/news/2017/09/drink-spiking-reported-wills-hall In December 2017 the University announced a new model for pastoral support in the residences, which included the abolition of the posts of Warden, Deputy Warden and Student Support Adviser. Support is now provided from offices in central 'hubs' or 'villages', each serving a group of halls. Wills is served from a hub based in Hiatt Baker Hall. There are a small number of Senior Residents and a Chief Resident (undergraduate and postgraduate students) living on site in Wills Hall, but staff are based in the hub and are contactable in person or by phone 24/7. The decision to implement a new system of pastoral care generated significant controversy, reflected in the national and local press, partly in the light of Bristol University's regrettable record of student suicides (14 since 2016). The first proposals by the University were modified in February 2018. Students resident in Wills Hall were very prominent in the debate surrounding the changes, leading on a petition that secured thousands of signatures and publishing in student and national newspapers. No action was taken by the University in response to this petition.

The purpose of the Spanish Empire was to gather native populations into centers called \\"Indian reductions\\" (reducciones de indios), in order to Christianize, tax, and govern them more effectively. Beginning in 1569, the viceroy Francisco de Toledo presided over the resettlement of about 1.4 million native people into approximately 840 of these reductions.Mumford, Jeremy Ravi (2012), Vertical Empire: The General Resettlement of Indians in the Colonial Andes, Durham: Duke University Press, p. 190 The resettlement was carried out in the Royal Audiences of Lima and Charcas, modern day Peru and Bolivia, roughly speaking. The native populations, who had adapted to a way of life suitable to the many, minor microclimates throughout the Andes, experienced immense hardship in the transition to these new regions. Despite these hardships, certain aspects of native Andean life were fiercely preserved by their own agency, and life in the reductions reflected a complex hybrid of forced Spanish values and those preserved from the older native communities.  Background  Reducciones were not new to Latin America, and had been a Spanish policy in many other regions, starting in the Caribbean as early as 1503. From 1532 when Francisco Pizarro invaded the Inca empire until the arrival of Francisco de Toledo as Viceroy in 1569, Spanish rule of the Andean population had largely been indirect. Except for Roman Catholic priests, Spaniards were forbidden from living among the Indians and the Spanish extracted tribute and labor from the Andean population through their indigenous leaders, the caciques or kurakas. Although the Indian population was devastated by the internal wars of Spaniards and Incas, the ravages of European diseases, and forced, brutal labor in silver and mercury mines, the Andean Indian cultures remained in many ways little changed from the days when the Incas ruled.Hemming, John (1970), The Conquest of the Incas, New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., pp. 347-373 By the late 1560s, Spanish rule of the Andes was in crisis. Both Spanish residents and Indians threatened revolt, production from rich silver mines had declined, the diminishing Indian population meant less labor and tribute, and civil and religious authorities were in conflict.Mumford, p. 46 The new Viceroy Francisco de Toledo aimed to reverse the fortunes of Spanish rule in the Andes and to \\"aggrandize Spanish power by consolidating viceregal rule and to revive the flow of Andean silver to the metropolitan treasury.\\" In order to achieve these economic and political goals efficiently, one of the measures Toledo proposed was to relocate the scattered indigenous populations of the Andes into larger settlements, called \\"reductions.\\" Early in his assessment of the Andean region, Francisco de Toledo idealized a universal resettlement to transform Andeans ‚Äúfrom savages to men and from barbarians to civilized people.‚Äù The campaign that took place in the Andes was part of the larger reforms he had been conceptualizing since 1567 and consulting with Spanish authorities on. Toledo himself conducted a massive inspection of the Andean heartland from 1570 to 1575 and brought the entire viceregal court on the journey. Trekking through mountains in the central and southern highlands, he took detailed observations to legitimize his plan and motivated the inspectors and administrators of the project. The selection of ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù sites for the reducciones often fell within ‚Äúareas of proven or potential economic benefit to the Crown‚Äù, which was often near mining zones and agricultural valleys. Toledo also developed an immense and thorough body of rules that would set the framework for the colonial ambition of reorganizing Andean society. = Purpose = Before the construction of the relocation towns, indigenous peoples throughout the Andes lived in small, localized and dispersed villages, which were difficult for Spanish colonial authorities to oversee. A primary motivation for the massive resettlement program \\"was to establish direct state control and facilitate the church's Christianization of the native population, while enhancing the collection of the tribute tax and the allocation of labor.\\" Toledo further justified the reducciones under the theory that they would protect natives from ‚Äúbeing exploited by local landowners and miners, harassed by the colonial judicial system, and deceived by a false religion.‚Äù Such paternalistic attitudes were common among Spanish authorities who perceived indigenous groups as volatile and prone to lawlessness if not placed under strict administration. = Organization = Many Spaniards viewed Christianity as an inseparable component from town building in the colonial era, believing that it was necessary for the proper functioning of civilized urban life. This was based around the concept of policia, which portrayed an idealized civic life that extolled cleanliness, strict organization, and virtuous citizenship. Reducciones were, in large part, conceived within this philosophy. The structural layout of the reducciones was based on a common template, modeled after a Spanish-style rural town. Each settlement was built with a quadrilateral, uniform street grid. Each reducci√≥n had a town square, around which were arranged the chief buildings: a church with an assigned priest, a prison, and a travelers lodge. They can best be described as a type of camp designed to model an ordered town. Special governors, under the titles of corregidores de indios, were appointed to oversee the reducciones and were vested with an immense amount of authority. They were instructed to build cabildos (municipal councils) in the reducciones of common natives who were recruited from the general population. The effort to recruit commoners was meant to undermine the influence of caciques, indigenous lords who possessed immense power in Andean societies. However, many caciques used their knowledge and social capital as leverage against the corregidores, which made reducci√≥n governance less simple than Spanish authorities assumed. Though the caciques almost universally opposed the policy of resettlement, many of them took advantage of the opportunity to transition their positions of power into the reducciones and actively challenge Spanish authority.  Impact on indigenous people  The movement into the reductions had highly disruptive effects on indigenous societies. Traditional family and kinship ties that existed for centuries were severely disturbed as small villages were forced to consolidate into poorly organized and often oversized settlements. This fundamentally different living environment forced natives to acclimate to a new socioeconomic order in which their power was severely curbed by the violent coercion of Spanish forces. Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, an indigenous chronicler, recounts the changes due to the reductions in The First New Chronicle and Good Government. He notes that the local Andean agricultural system thrived based on plots cultivated according to the microclimates up and down the Andean mountain range. Each microclimate and corresponding agricultural product contributed to the health and overall well-being of the Native American population. However, the reductions destroyed this \\"'vertical' organization of farming.\\" The people were torn from their established agricultural system and crops, and their familiar villages, but they were potentially relocated to completely different climate zones, requiring new crops and techniques. Poma also notes that the new sites were \\"sometimes set in damp lands that cause pestilence\\" (disease). Despite the exploitation and circumstantial hardships that Andeans faced, many of them found ways to exercise their agency in certain spheres where opportunity presented itself. Poma took special pride in the cabildos (municipal councils), composed of natives in each reduction, and saw them as a path towards developing indigenous self-government. In addition, many Andeans were able to negotiate deals to keep all or some of their previous villages and farmland, which resulted in an ebb and flow of people from the reductions to the countryside. Some managed to avoid Spanish detection and escape the reductions altogether to pursue radically different lives.

This type of bluff may be employed as an attempt at using reverse psychology to steal the pot. It holds comparatively little risk for the player making the bet. The term was popularized by Doyle Brunson in his 1979 book Super System.  Strategy  A player executing the post-oak bluff bets a small amount relative to the size of the pot (typically of the order of 1/10 the pot), in order to create the impression that he is trying to lure the other player into the pot. In this way, he mimics the play he might make if he had a strong hand, where it is known as a \\"here kitty kitty\\" or \\"come hither\\" bet. When successful, the other player(s) fold rather than fall into the perceived trap. This bluff will not often win the pot as the pot odds presented by the bet‚Äî11 to 1‚Äîare usually too good for the opposing players to reject unless they are absolutely convinced they're beaten. However, in order to be successful in the long term, a 1/10 pot-size bluff need only succeed one time in ten. Dan Harrington has enumerated three preconditions he says are requisite for him to ever use a post-oak bluff: # He must have seen his opponent employ the luring bet. # His opponent must have previously observed him making luring bets. # He must have witnessed his opponent fold to a small bet. The term itself‚Äîderived from the post oak, a smallish tree of little commercial value‚Äîoften carries derogatory connotations and it is frequently seen as a weak play, as the player takes the overcautious approach by not betting too much. Thus, this strategy often undermines the chances of the bluff working. Doyle Brunson described the move as \\"gutless\\" and he claims that he never makes the play.

bandmates, according to Peter Buck's liner notes to the band's In Time compilation album. Like all R.E.M. songs, its composition is credited to all members. The song was recorded for Murmur in 1983, but was left off the album. In January 1993, the European reissue of Dead Letter Office, a B-side album compilation, included that recording, along with an acoustic version of \\"Gardening at Night\\". The song was also recorded during the Reckoning sessions, but not used (though bootlegged), and later recorded during the Lifes Rich Pageant demo sessions (this version was included on the bonus disc of the 25th Anniversary edition of the album). In 2001, director Cameron Crowe released the movie Vanilla Sky, starring Tom Cruise. R.E.M. were approached with the idea of them contributing a rock song to the soundtrack. According to Peter Buck, they were approached \\"about eight days before they needed it\\", and they had loads of material left from Reveal, but they wanted a rock song, and their manager Bertis Downs had liked \\"All the Right Friends\\", so they recorded it. Slightly different from the other version (with most of the original lyrics missing), the song was, in Peter Buck's vision, recorded as if they were recording it for the Chronic Town EP, as Buck noted on the sleeve notes to the band's 2003 In Time compilation album. The song was recorded on October 23, 2001, in Seattle's Bad Animals Studio's \\"Studio X\\" while R.E.M. were in town for a performance at the Groundwork Benefit the previous day and, that evening, at the Crocodile Caf√©. On an R.E.M. special of The South Bank Show, which aired in May 2002 on the UK's ITV, Buck is seen recording a guitar overdub for the song, then, upon completion, the camera follows him into the control room to evaluate the recording. In addition to the Vanilla Sky soundtrack album, the re-recording is included on R.E.M.'s 2003 Warner Bros. Records compilation, In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003. The original 1983 version of the song recorded for Murmur was internationally released on the expanded edition of the 2006 EMI compilation, And I Feel Fine... The Best of the I.R.S.

Design and development In the late 1940s and early 1950s the Allied aircraft industries were engaged in many projects to confirm and develop the design ideas captured from Nazi Germany at the end of the Second World War. As part of this activity the P.111 was built for the Air Ministry to specification E.27/46 by Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd to investigate the possibilities of the delta planform wing.Jones 1993, p.34. The P.111 was designed as the smallest airframe which could couple an engine (Rolls-Royce Nene), an ejection seat (Martin-Baker), and a delta wing. The latter was aerodynamically thin and had a sweep angle of 45¬∞. Without tip extensions the wing was strongly cropped at about 75% of the full delta. The aircraft could be flown with these wings or with one of two pairs of extensions, the larger ones making an almost perfect pointed delta shape. These extensions allowed an investigation of the aerodynamic effects of the tip shapes of delta wings. Unlike its contemporary the Avro 707, roll and attitude were both controlled by a pair of elevons. The fin had an unswept trailing edge and its tip also could be removed and altered, though it seems it always flew with a very pointed tip. The P.111 was fitted with one of the first fully powered control systems, hydraulically driven with electrical trim tabs. Because the Nene had a centrifugal compressor, the P.111 had a rather tubby fuselage, with an oval nose intake. The inward-retracting undercarriage had a noticeably wide track and a tall nosewheel leg placed it at 17¬∞ on the ground. The construction was all-metal with the exception of the wing extensions and the fin tip, which were of glass-reinforced plastic. Testing and evaluation The P.111 made its first flight on 10 October 1950, at Royal Aircraft Establishment Boscombe Down with Squadron Leader Bob Smyth at the controls. Later test flying was carried out by test pilot, Alexander E. \\"Ben\\" Gunn, who described the aeroplane as \\"touchy\\" and \\"like flying a razor's edge\\".Jones 1993, p.38. Part of the touchiness was because the power controls, essential at high speeds over 450 mph, lacked any feedback. There was also a large trim change when the undercarriage was raised or lowered and landing speeds were high in the absence of airbrakes and because of the need to keep the engine revs up to maintain the generators which powered the control surfaces. In the first few months of flying, the controls were spring-loaded to give a semblance of feel and the rudder was altered to manual control. The P.111 initially had a one piece blown and continuously curved windscreen, but this was replaced by a more conventional framed screen with a flat forward pane. After a landing accident in which the retractable landing gear failed to extend, the P.111 was modified during its repairs to improve the flight characteristics, and was re-designated the P.111A. Four \\"petal\\" airbrakes were added to the fuselage to lower landing speeds and the undercarriage doors were changed to reduce the trim change. A long nose probe carrying a pitot head was added. The most immediately obvious change was the new bright yellow overall paint scheme, the P.111 having been unpainted or silver coloured. The P.111A soon gained the nickname of the \\"Yellow Peril\\". The P.111A first flew on 2 July 1953 from Boscombe Down. Shortly afterwards the anti-spin parachute mounted on the rear port fuselage was strengthened so it could be deployed as a braking parachute and the pilot was given control over the strength of the power controls. It was used by the RAE in a series of explorations of delta wing characteristics and later based at RAE Bedford. During this time it flew with each of the three wing tips. After a last flight in 1958 it went to the Cranfield College of Aeronautics as a training airframe.Jones 1993, p.39. In 1975 it was acquired by the Midland Aircraft Preservation Society on long-term loan for its Midland Air Museum at Coventry Airport, making the journey by road on Sunday 13 July, since when it has been on static public display. The P.111 was followed by another delta-winged experimental aircraft, the P.120 which was intended to compare and contrast the behaviour of an otherwise identical tailed delta.

A member of the Hand, Tsurayaba's first appearance came in Uncanny X-Men #255 and was directly involved with the \\"body swap incident\\" between Betsy Braddock and Kwannon just after Betsy's emergence from the Siege Perilous. Fictional character biography Matsu'o Tsurayaba was a Hand assassin working in Japan. His love, another assassin by the name of Kwannon, worked for an opposing crime boss named Nyorin. Though they knew their respective employers would eventually clash, the two remained lovers, and vowed to fight honorably to the death should they have to. Fatefully, they did. Matsu'o was ordered by the Hand to kill Nyorin, and during his fight with Kwannon, she slipped, and fell from the cliffs they were on to the ocean below. Matsu'o brought her broken body to the labs of the Hand. They were able to keep her body alive, but her mind was shattered beyond repair. Soon after, the X-Man Psylocke emerged from the Siege Perilous. Betsy Braddock washed up, naked and amnesiac, on a beach of an island belonging to the Hand. Matsu'o recognized the woman as Psylocke and devised a plan to use her telepathic abilities to restore his lover's mind. His idea was to transplant the mind of Kwannon into the body of Psylocke. Kwannon possessed a natural empathic ability that would ensure her mind would survive contact with a high-level telepath's like Psylocke, but her body was still too weak for such a transfer. Matsu'o contacted the villain Spiral, who agreed to help. Spiral, true to her penchant for deception and treachery, did more than just switch the two minds. She twisted the DNA of both women so that both bodies were genetically the same, each bearing characteristics of the other. She also spliced the minds of both women, planting pieces of each in both bodies. After the transfer was complete, both the Asian body of Kwannon and the European body of Psylocke possessed parts of the psyches of both women, though it was later revealed that more of Betsy's mind existed within Kwannon's body and more of Kwannon's resided within Psylocke's. The process also halved Psylocke's telepathy between them. Seeing that both women seemed to be in both bodies, Matsu'o was more interested in the body that looked the most like his lost love, and left the other body, who would later become Revanche, in the hands of her old employer Nyorin. Matsu'o aided Psylocke, now Asian, in her recovery, training her in various martial arts and making her into the Mandarin's finest assassin. A warrior is exactly what Elizabeth Braddock had always dreamed of becoming, and Matsu'o, along with Spiral and the Hand, unwittingly gave Betsy Braddock her innermost desire. Matsu'o later allied with Fenris to revive Omega Red.X-Men vol. 2 #4-7 Later, when Revanche attacked Psylocke, claiming to be the true Elizabeth Braddock, the two women, accompanied by Beast and Gambit, went to Japan to discover the truth. Though they found planted evidence in the form of a false diary written by Lord Nyoirin, Matsu'o refused to reveal the truth. Revanche, having nowhere else to go, decided to remain with the X-Men and aided them on several missions. Later still, Revanche contracted the Legacy Virus. Her telepathic powers slowly increased to the point that she could cut through the confusion in her own mind and remember who she truly was: the real Kwannon, as Psylocke was the real Betsy Braddock. Near death, she confronted Matsu'o, who finally admitted the truth and begged for forgiveness. Sensing her imminent death, she asked Matsu'o (affectionately called Matta) to kill her before she burned herself out. He did, plunging a blade into her heart, and buried her. With Kwannon's death, Psylocke's full telepathic potential was returned to her. Sensing Revanche's death, Psylocke went to find Matsu'o, who explained everything. Revanche also left a portion of her psionic energies within Matsu'o, who used it at her behest, removing Kwannon's fractured memories and personality traits from Betsy Braddock's mind, and restoring those of Betsy's that were possessed by Kwannon. Matsu'o wished to commit suicide to join his lover, but was stopped by Psylocke, who convinced him to honor her memory by becoming the man she would have wanted.X-Men vol. 2 #31 Matsu'o's resolve to become a better person would not last, however. His enmity with Wolverine led him to initiate an attack on his lover, Mariko Yashida. In particular, Matsu'o collaborated with another of Logan's love interests, Silver Fox, the leader of HYDRA. After distracting Wolverine they sent an assassin to poison Mariko. The assassination was a success, but Matsu'o underestimated Wolverine's true berserker rage. In a mad fit of revenge, Logan entered Tsurayaba's penthouse, and sliced off his arm. Logan then promised him that every year on Mariko's death, he would carve a little more off the Hand boss. Matsu'o is now missing his arm, right ear, nose, and gall bladder.Wolverine vol. 2 #57 (July 1992) At one point Wolverine finally killed a now partly cyborg Matsu'o only for him to be almost instantly brought back to life by his own Hand ninjas (much to Matsu'o's chagrin as he wanted to die rather than face the constant waiting for Wolverine).Wolverine/Hercules: Myths, Monsters & Mutants #4 (August 2011) Psylocke, having returned from her stint with the Exiles, travelled to Japan to bury her former body. Upon arriving she was ambushed by the Hand, who destroyed her body with an incendiary device, stating as they departed that Matsu'o gave the command to attack. Enraged, Psylocke tracks Matsu'o down, only to be horrified to find him terribly disfigured; the result of Wolverine's yearly revenge. Matsu'o, now missing both hands and other body parts, desires an honorable death and wants Psylocke to grant him that honor since he cannot hold a blade to perform seppuku. Before Psylocke can oblige, Wolverine emerges from the shadows and says that Matsu'o's punishment is not over yet. The two X-Men engage in a brutal fight that ends in a standstill. Wolverine finally relents, however, allowing Psylocke to kill Matsu'o. She generates a telepathic illusion of Kwannon in Matsu'o's mind, then kills him quickly with her psychic blade.Psylocke #1-4 (2009) Powers and abilities Matsu'o Tsurayaba is trained in various martial arts disciplines. He once wore a prosthetic right hand with retractable finger blades. Matsu'o Tsurayaba's strength has been augmented with cybernetic implants. On occasion, he has worn an armored battlesuit of unrevealed capabilities.

Notice that the south pole of that magnet is deep in Earth's interior below Earth's North Magnetic Pole. Earth's magnetic field is produced in the outer liquid part of its core due to a dynamo that produce electrical currents there. The ions and electrons of a plasma interacting with the Earth's magnetic field generally follow its magnetic field lines. These represent the force that a north magnetic pole would experience at any given point. (Denser lines indicate a stronger force.) Plasmas exhibit more complex second-order behaviors, studied as part of magnetohydrodynamics. A simulation of a charged particle being deflected from the Earth by the magnetosphere. Thus in the \\"closed\\" model of the magnetosphere, the magnetopause boundary between the magnetosphere and the solar wind is outlined by field lines. Not much plasma can cross such a stiff boundary. Its only \\"weak points\\" are the two polar cusps, the points where field lines closing at noon (-z axis GSM) get separated from those closing at midnight (+z axis GSM); at such points the field intensity on the boundary is zero, posing no barrier to the entry of plasma. (This simple definition assumes a noon-midnight plane of symmetry, but closed fields lacking such symmetry also must have cusps, by the fixed point theorem.) The amount of solar wind energy and plasma entering the actual magnetosphere depends on how far it departs from such a \\"closed\\" configuration, i.e. the extent to which Interplanetary Magnetic Field field lines manage to cross the boundary. As discussed further below, that extent depends very much on the direction of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field, in particular on its southward or northward slant. Schematic view of the different current systems which shape the Earth's magnetosphere Trapping of plasma, e.g. of the ring current, also follows the structure of field lines. A particle interacting with this B field experiences a Lorentz Force which is responsible for many of the particle motion in the magnetosphere. Furthermore, Birkeland currents and heat flow are also channeled by such lines ‚Äî easy along them, blocked in perpendicular directions. Indeed, field lines in the magnetosphere have been likened to the grain in a log of wood, which defines an \\"easy\\" direction along which it easily gives way.  Motion of charged particles  A simulated charged particle, its trajectory determined primarily by the Earth's magnetosphere. The simplest magnetic field B is a constant one‚Äì straight parallel field lines and constant field intensity. In such a field, if an ion or electron enters perpendicular to the field lines, it can be shown to move in a circle (the field only needs to be constant in the region covering the circle). If q is the charge of the particle, m its mass, v its velocity and Rg the radius of the circle (\\"gyration radius\\"), all one needs do is notice that the centripetal force mv2/Rg must equal the magnetic force qvB. One gets Rg = mv/(qB) If the initial velocity of the particle has a different direction, one only needs resolve it into a component v‚ä•perpendicular to B and a component v// parallel to B, and replace v in the above formula with v‚ä•. If W‚ä•=m v‚ä•2/2 is the energy associated with the perpendicular motion in electron-volts (all calculations here are non- relativistic), in a field of B nT (nanotesla), then Rg in kilometers is For protons Rg = (144/B) For electrons Rg = (3.37/B) The velocity parallel to the field v// is not affected by the field, because no magnetic force exists in that direction. That velocity just stays constant (as long as the field does), and adding the two motions together gives a spiral around a central guiding field line. If the field curves or changes, the motion is modified, but the general character of spiraling around a central field line persists: hence the name \\"guiding center motion.\\" Because the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity, it performs no work and requires no energy‚Äînor does it provide any. Thus magnetic fields (like the Earth's) can profoundly affect particle motion in them, but need no energy input to maintain their effect. Particles may also get steered around, but their total energy remains the same.  Magnetic Mirroring and Magnetic Drift  The spacing between field lines is an indicator of the relative strength of the magnetic field. Where magnetic field lines converge the field grows stronger, and where they diverge, weaker. Now, it can be shown that in the motion of gyrating particles, the \\"magnetic moment\\" Œº = W‚ä•/B (or relativistically, p‚ä•2/2mŒ≥B) stays very nearly constant. The \\"very nearly\\" qualifier sets it apart from true constants of motion, such as energy, reducing it to merely an \\"adiabatic invariant.\\" For most plasmas in the magnetosphere, the deviation from constancy is negligible. The conservation of Œº is tremendously important (in laboratory plasmas as well as in space). Suppose the field line guiding a particle, the axis of its spiral path, belongs to a converging bundle of lines, so that the particle is led into an increasingly larger B. To keep Œº constant, W‚ä• must also grow. However, as noted before, the total energy of a particle in a \\"purely magnetic\\" field remains constant. What therefore happens is that energy is converted, from the part associated with the parallel motion v// to the perpendicular part. As v// decreases, the angle between v and B then increases, until it reaches 90¬∞. At that point W‚ä• contains all the available energy, it can grow no more and no further advance into the stronger field can occur. The result is known as magnetic mirroring. The particle briefly gyrates perpendicular to its guiding field line, and then retreats back to the weaker field, the spiral unwinding again in the process. It may be noted that such motion was first derived by Henri Poincar√© in 1895, for a charged particle in the field of a magnetic monopole, whose field lines are all straight and converge to a point. The conservation of Œº was only pointed by Alfv√©n about 50 years later, and the connection to adiabatic invariant was only made afterwards. Magnetic mirroring makes possible the \\"trapping\\" in the dipole-like field lines near Earth of particles in the radiation belt and in the ring current. On all such lines the field is much stronger at their ends near Earth, compared to its strength when it crosses the equatorial plane. Assuming such particles are somehow placed in the equatorial region of that field, most of them stay trapped, because every time their motion along the field line brings them into the strong field region, they \\"get mirrored\\" and bounce back and forth between hemispheres. Only particles whose motion is very close to parallel to the field line, with near-zero Œº, avoid mirroring‚Äîand these are quickly absorbed by the atmosphere and lost. Their loss leaves a bundle of directions around the field line which is empty of particles‚Äîthe \\"loss cone\\". In addition to gyrating around their guiding field lines and bouncing back and forth between mirror points, trapped particles also drift slowly around Earth, switching guiding field lines but staying at approximately the same distance (another adiabatic invariant is involved, \\"the second invariant\\"). This motion was mentioned earlier in connection with the ring current. One reason for the drift is that the intensity of B increases as Earth is approached. The gyration around the guiding field line is therefore not a perfect circle, but curves a little more tightly on the side closer to the Earth, where the larger B gives a smaller Rg. This change in curvature makes ions advance sideways, while electrons, which gyrate in the opposite sense, advance sideways in the opposite direction. The net result, as already noted, produces the ring current, though additional effects (like non-uniform distribution of plasma density) also affect the result.

It is native to Europe and Asia. The common name eltrot may also be applied, but is not specific to this species. Umbelliferous plants are so named because of the umbrella-like arrangement of flowers they produce. The North American species Heracleum maximum (also called cow parsnip) is sometimes included as a subspecies of H. sphondylium. The plant provides a great deal of nectar for pollinators. It was rated in the top 10 for most nectar production (nectar per unit cover per year) in a UK plants survey conducted by the AgriLand project which is supported by the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative.  Etymology  The species name sphondylium, meaning \\"vertebrate\\", refers to the shape of the segmented stem. It was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.  Description  Close-up of H. sphondylium flowers Heracleum sphondylium reaches on average of height, with a maximum of . The hollow, ridged stem with bristly hairs arises from a large tap root. The leaves can reach of length. They are once or twice pinnate, hairy and serrated, divided into 3‚Äì5 lobed segments. Hogweed has 5-petalled pinkish or white flowers, arranged in umbels usually less than 30 cm of diameter with 15 to 30 rays. The peripheral flowers have a radial symmetry (zygomorphic). The terminal umbels are flat-topped and the outermost petals are enlarged.Parnell, J. and Curtis, Y. 2012. Webb's An Irish Flora. Cork University Press. Flowering typically occurs between June and October. Drawing of Heracleum sphondylium, showing the heart-shaped schizocarp (fruit) The flowers are pollinated by insects, such as beetles, wasps and especially flies. The small fruits are schizocarps, flattened and winged, elliptical to rounded and glabrous, up to 1 cm long. The seed dispersal is by wind (anemochory). The characteristic pig-like smell of the flowers gives it its name. The leaves are commonly mined by the larvae of the leaf miner Phytomyza spondylii. H. sphondylium is smaller than dangerous Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) and Heracleum sosnowskyi (Sosnowsky's hogweed), and should not be confused. However, it contains some of the same phytophototoxic compounds (furanocoumarins), albeit at lower concentrations, and there is evidence that the sap from common hogweed can also produce phytophotodermatitis (burns and rashes) when contaminated skin is exposed to sunlight. Care therefore needs to be used when cutting or trimming it, to prevent 'strimmers rash'. The small picture-winged fly Euleia heraclei is, as its name suggests, found on hogweed.Euleia heraclei Retrieved 18 May 2012  Distribution  H. sphondylium has an Eurasian distribution, growing throughout Europe and eastwards to central Asia. Its native range just extends into North Africa. The species has been introduced to suitable habitats elsewhere, such as Canada and the U.S. In particular, H. sphondylium is recorded as introduced to Ontario by the Database of Vascular Plants of Canada but reports of H. sphondylium in Canada are rare..  Habitat  The plant is common in grassland, herb-rich meadows, in hedges, meadows and woods, road verges and railway embankments, waste and cultivated ground. It prefers moist, nitrogen- rich soils. It can occur in mountain areas up to of altitude.  Uses  In the 18th century, people on the Kamchatka Peninsula distilled a spirit called raka from a \\"sweet grass\\" that was most likely H. sphondylium. The raka was flavored with blue-berried honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea). Borscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems, leaves and umbels of common hogweed. The young shoots are considered excellent eating by many foragers. In eastern European countries and especially Romania, H. sphondylium is used as an aphrodisiac and to treat gynecological and fertility problems and impotence. It is also sometimes recommended for epilepsy. However, there are no clinical studies to prove its efficacy at treating any of these problems. The seeds can be dried and used as a spice, with a flavour similar to that of cardamom.  Subspecies  This species has variable characteristics and many forms have been described.

All water hemlock and poison hemlock are highly poisonous, but water parsnip is not. Both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, and have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Water parsnip has leaves only once compound, and water hemlock has leaves which are three times compound. Water hemlock has a large swelling at the stem base, and has bracts at the base of each small flower cluster, not at the base of the main flower head. The water parsnip has small bracts at the base of flowers and main flower head as well. The cow parsnips (Heracleum lanatum, Heracleum maximum) are also confused in this group with similar flower groupings. However, the cow parsnips have large, broad leaves, and an unpleasant odour.

It preceded the Office for National Statistics. Establishment of the CSO During the Second World War, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill directed the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Edward Bridges (later Lord Bridges), to advise him on how a central statistical office could be created in the Prime Minister's office in order to consolidate and issue authoritative working statistics.Minute sent by Winston Churchill to Sir Edward Bridges, 8 November 1940. Following consideration, a formal announcement was made to establish the CSO on 27 January 1941War Cabinet announcement by Sir Edward Bridges on behalf of Winston Churchill, 27 January 1941. with the purpose of handling the descriptive statistics required for the war effort and developing national income accounts. Shortly afterward, Harry Campion (later Sir Harry Campion), a member of the Central Economic Information Service in the Cabinet Office, was appointed director. After the war there was an expansion in the work of official statisticians resulting from the aim of managing the economy through controlling government income and expenditure using an integrated system of national accounts and in 1962, comprehensive financial statistics were published for the first time.CSO, Financial Statistics, London: HMSO. Development of the CSO Following Sir Harry Campion's retirement in March 1967, Claus Moser (now Lord Moser), a professor of statistics at the London School of Economics, was appointed director. Moser had the task of implementing proposals made by the House of Commons Estimates Committee in 1966, including the setting up of the Business Statistics Office to provide a centralised system of obtaining information from industry and the Office for Population, Censuses and Surveys to collect information from individuals and households through programmes of censuses, surveys and registers. He made major improvements in the area of social statistics in close partnership with the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and paid particular attention to the development of the CSO's role of co-ordinating the statistical activities of individual government departments and the development of the Government Statistical Service (GSS), of which he became the head in 1968. After eleven years of statistical development and reorganisation, Moser resigned on 1 August 1978. The third director of the CSO was John Boreham (later Sir John Boreham), Moser's deputy. The Rayner Review In 1979, a new government came into office with a review of the CSO and the Government Statistical Service as an early part of its policy of reducing the size of the Civil Service. This review, conducted by Sir, later Lord Derek Rayner and known as the Rayner Review, was published in a government white paper in April 1981 and recommended that 'information should not be collected primarily for publication (but) primarily because government needs it for its own business'.Great Britain, Privy Council Office (1981) Government Statistical Services, Report of the Rayner Review, London: HMSO. The Government accepted this recommendation and as a result, the CSO was cut by around 25% but continued to produce the same range of economic statistics. Expansion of the CSO After 35 years in the Government Statistical Service, Sir John Boreham retired on 31 July 1985 and was succeeded by Jack Hibbert, who became the fourth director of the CSO. During 1986 and 1987, quality problems with the economics statistics produced by the CSO, due partly to the effects of deregulation and to changes to the structure of the economy, became apparent. A review conducted by Stephen Pickford made a number of recommendations for further research and more significantly, recommended greater centralisation of work on economic statistics. Consequently, the Business Statistics Office, most of the two statistics divisions responsible for data on imports and exports at the Department of Trade and Industry, and the statistics division responsible for the Retail Prices Index at the Department of Employment were merged with the CSO in 1989. An improvement programme followed in 1990 at the request of the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, which focused on the national accounts and the balance of payments. In November 1991 the CSO was launched as an executive agency, detached from the Cabinet Office, which helped to put focus on the quality of service provided and gave an opportunity to restate publicly the arrangements to ensure the integrity of official statistics. Creation of the Office for National Statistics On 1 April 1996, the CSO merged with the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) to form the Office for National Statistics (ONS) under a single director, Professor Tim Holt.

Ritvik Holdings Inc., popularly known as the Lego Case, is a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada. The Court upheld the constitutionality of section 7(b) of the Trade-marks Act which prohibits the use of confusing marks, as well, on a second issue it was held that the doctrine of functionality applied to unregistered trade-marks. Background Mega Bloks building block (above) and Lego building brick (below) =History of the Trade-marks Act= While s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 gives the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction over copyright and patent matters, it is silent with respect to trademarks. However, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and the Supreme Court of Canada have both suggested in their jurisprudence that the Trade-marks Act is a valid exercise of the federal trade and commerce power., citing and =Lego and Mega Bloks= Kirkbi AG, a member of The Lego Group, previously held patents in the design and form of Lego blocks, which had expired in Canada and elsewhere.Kirkbi (FCT), par. 3334, noting , , , noting the last Canadian patent expired in 1988. Ritvik produced the pieces known as Mega Bloks. Kirkbi attempted to register the design of their blocks as a trade-mark but was denied by the Registrar of Trade-marks. Kirkbi then asserted unregistered trade-mark rights against Ritvik through an unregistered trade-mark in the distinctive orthogonal pattern of raised studs distributed on the top of each toy-building brick, and claimed relief under s. 7(b) of the Act, as well as under the common law doctrine of passing off. Ritvik denied any breach under the Act or at common law and counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that it was entitled to continue to make, offer for sale and sell in Canada its blocks and related parts. The courts below =Federal Court= Gibson J. dismissed Kirkbi's claim of based on trade-mark, finding that: * Kirkbi had an interest in an unregistered trademark, but only with respect of the inscription \\"LEGO\\" on the top surface of each stud, * there was no trademark protection in purely functional features, and * in considering the claim of passing off, while Kirkbi had acquired goodwill in the particular configuration of its bricks, it had failed to prove that Ritvik had intentionally misrepresented its product. =Federal Court of Appeal= Kirkbi's appeal was dismissed. Writing for the majority, Sexton JA did not comment on the questions of confusion and the elements of the tort of passing off, but did find that the doctrine of functionality applied to trade-marks, whether registered or not. In dissent, Pelletier JA, held: :* the \\"LEGO\\" mark, although functional, could still be the basis of a passing-off claim under s. 7(b), as Kirkbi was entitled to protection against the confusing use of its unregistered mark :* the doctrine of functionality was no longer part of the law of trade-marks in Canada in respect of unregistered marks, by reason of changes to the Act :* the elements of passing off had been made out, since, even though no deliberate strategy to deceive had been established, confusion in the market between Kirkbi and Ritvik products had been proved. Supreme Court Ruling In a unanimous judgment, the appeal was dismissed. In his reasons, LeBel J held that: :* s. 7(b) of the Trade‚Äëmarks Act was intra vires the Parliament of Canada, and :* Kirkbi‚Äôs passing‚Äëoff claim under s. 7(b) must be dismissed, as it is barred by the application of the doctrine of functionality. =Constitutionality= It was not until the case was at the Supreme Court that Ritvik challenged the constitutionality of s. 7(b) of the Trade-marks Act. LeBel J stated that it was constitutional,, using the test for constitutionality as restated in saying: :* the intrusion of s. 7(b) into provincial jurisdiction is minimal, as it is remedial and is limited in its application by the provisions of the Act. :* the Trade‚Äëmarks Act is a valid exercise of Parliament‚Äôs general trade and commerce power. :* s. 7(b) is sufficiently integrated into the Trade‚Äëmarks Act, as a \\"functional relationship\\", such as is present here, is sufficient to sustain the constitutionality of the provision. =Doctrine of Functionality= Citing jurisprudence dating back to 1964, LeBel noted: The Court noted that the Trade-marks Act specifically excluded protection from \\"utilitarian features of a distinguishing guise\\". It recognized that allowing the claim created a concern with \\"overextending monopoly rights on the products themselves and impeding competition, in respect of wares sharing the same technical characteristics.\\" The Court agreed with the Federal Court of Appeal ruling, which found no difference between the legal attributes held by registered and unregistered marks. It looked to the text and the legislative history of the act to determine that there was no intention to give unregistered marks more protection than registered marks. =Passing Off= Though the Court disposed of the case in ruling there was no cause of action under trade-mark law, it nonetheless considered the common law tort of passing off. It found that three elements were required to establish the tort:, quoting :* existence of goodwill, :* deception of the public due to a misrepresentation, and :* actual or potential damage to the plaintiff. In this case, K‚Äôs claim was bound to fail because it would not have met the first condition of the action. The alleged distinctiveness of the product consisted precisely of the process and techniques which were now common to the trade. While deception had been proven, the SCC noted that the trial judge had interpreted it too narrowly. Misrepresentation may be wilful and may thus mean the same thing as deceit. But now the doctrine of passing off also covers negligent or careless misrepresentation by the trader. As there was no discussion in the present case as to the question of damages, no comment was made. Impact Kirkbi, together with General Motors of Canada Ltd. v. City National Leasing, are leading cases on the scope of Parliament's trade and commerce power, particularly with respect to the general branch of that power. It reflects the current view of the Court that favours interprovincial economic integration, especially with the respect to the views expressed by Peter Hogg and Warren Grover: On the more specific questions of intellectual property law, Kirkbi can also be seen as encouraging manufacturers of products embodying functional modular designs to employ appropriately clever branding and marketing, so that such designs may be seen as a source of distinctiveness, and thus deserving of trademark protection.

Allan Gilbert, was a prominent American illustrator. He is especially remembered for a widely published drawing (a memento mori or vanitas) titled All Is Vanity. The drawing employs a double image (or visual pun) in which the scene of a woman admiring herself in a mirror, when viewed from a distance, appears to be a human skull. The title is also a pun, as this type of dressing-table is also known as a vanity. The phrase \\"All is vanity\\" comes from Ecclesiastes 1:2 (Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.) It refers to the vanity and pride of humans. In art, vanity has long been represented as a woman preoccupied with her beauty. And art that contains a human skull as a focal point is called a memento mori (Latin for \\"remember you will die\\"), a work that reminds people of their mortality. It is less widely known that Gilbert was an early contributor to animation, and a camouflage artist (or camoufleur) for the U.S. Shipping Board during World War I. Background Silhouette self-portrait of C. Allan Gilbert published in 1916 Born in Hartford, Connecticut, Gilbert was the youngest of the three sons of Charles Edwin Gilbert and Virginia Ewing Crane. As a child, he was an invalid (the circumstances of which are unclear), with the result that he often made drawings for self-amusement (Leonard 1913). At age sixteen, he began to study art with Charles Noel Flagg, the official portrait painter for the State of Connecticut, who had also founded the Connecticut League of Art Students. In 1892, he enrolled at the Art Students League of New York, where he remained for two years. In 1894, he moved to France for a year, where he studied with Jean-Paul Laurens and Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant at the Academie Julien in Paris (New York Times 1913). Illustration career Pastel painting, Woman with Rose (1920), by C. Allan Gilbert Returning from Paris, Gilbert settled in New York, where he embarked on an active career as an illustrator of books, magazines, posters and calendars. His illustrations were frequently published in Scribner's, Harper's, Atlantic Monthly and other leading magazines. It was earlier, while he was still a student at the Art Students' League, that he completed All Is Vanity, the drawing that became popular when it was initially published in Life magazine in 1902. In the course of his artistic career, Gilbert illustrated a large number of books, among them Ellen Glasgow's Life and Gabriella (1916), H.G. Wells' The Soul of a Bishop (1917), Gouverneur Morris' His Daughter (1919), Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence (1920), and Booth Tarkington's Gentle Julia (1922). He also published collections of his own drawings, including Overheard in the Whittington Family, Women of Fiction, All is Vanity, The Honeymoon, A Message from Mars, and In Beauty's Realm. Work as an animator Silhouette by Gilbert for the 1916 animated film Inbad the Tailor As an early contributor to animated films (Grant, p. 49), Gilbert worked for John R. Bray in 1915‚Äì16 on the production of a series of moving shadow plays called Silhouette Fantasies. These Art Nouveau-styled films, which were made by combining filmed silhouettes with pen-and-ink components, were serious interpretations of Greek myths (Crafton 1993, p. 865; Bachman 2002, pp. 261‚Äì262). Camouflage service During World War I, Gilbert served as a camouflage artist for the U.S. Shipping Board (the Emergency Fleet Corporation), as did other well-known artists and illustrators, including McClelland Barclay, William MacKay, and Henry Reuterdahl (Behrens 2009). As did they, he also illustrated posters for American wartime programs such as Liberty Bonds (or Liberty Loans). Later years Throughout his life (and still today), Gilbert was so strongly identified with his drawing All Is Vanity that he is sometimes mistakenly credited with two other popular double image artworks, Gossip: And the Devil Was There, and Social Donkey, both of which were apparently made by another illustrator of the same time period, George A. Wotherspoon. Gilbert continued to live in New York during the remainder of his life, but he often spent his summers on Monhegan Island in Maine. He died in New York of pneumonia at age 55.

He was well known as a performer on the organ and on the spinet, as well as a composer of chansons; in addition he was one of very few French composers of the 16th century with a surviving composition written specifically for the keyboard. Life Nothing is known about his early life; the first record of La Grotte's life is from 1557, when he was employed as a keyboard player (organ and spinet) to the King of Navarre, Antoine de Bourbon, at Pau in southwestern France. In 1562 he was given a position with the Duke of Anjou, along with Guillaume Costeley, and when the Duke of Anjou became King Henry III of France in 1574, La Grotte acquired the prestigious post of 'vallet de chambre et organiste ordinaire'. His reputation as an organist seems to have been high; several writers in the early 1580s, such as La Croix du Maine and Jean Dorat, praised his playing. Between 1586 and 1589 he attempted to purchase land outside of Paris (whether he was successful is not known) and he went to Tours during the 1590 siege of Paris, where he stayed with the as-yet-uncrowned Henry IV of France (Henri de Navarre). The rest of his career and circumstances of his death have not yet been investigated by biographers. Music La Grotte was known for his chansons, about 100 of which have survived, and also for his keyboard playing, especially on the organ. While he is known to have written music for the organ, only one composition has survived: a four-part fantasia on the madrigal Ancor che col partire by Cipriano de Rore. This is one of only a handful of French pieces of the 16th century that was written specifically for keyboard. The overwhelming majority of keyboard compositions from 16th-century France are transcriptions of music for voices‚Äîespecially chansons. La Grotte's chansons were transitional in style between the mid-century French chanson and the air de cour, which was to be the predominant type of secular vocal music in France around 1600. Many of his chansons feature a prominent melody in the superius part (the highest voice) with a relatively simple chordal accompaniment in the other voices, making them easily transcribable for lute. Indeed this is exactly what happened to many of them, and in this respect La Grotte's chansons are like the later air de cour, which featured a voice accompanied by a lute. In addition, he combined duple and triple rhythms in irregular patterns, following the declamation of the text, in the manner of the composers writing musique mesur√©e √† l'antique, such as Claude Le Jeune. The first book of La Grotte's chansons (1569, for four voices) is based on the poetry of Pierre de Ronsard. His later chansons set a variety of poets, and some of the poems are religious, in contrast to the exceedingly secular content of the French chanson of the early and middle 16th century. Unusually for the time, La Grotte seems to have written no music in the specifically sacred forms, including the mass and the motet. Many of La Grotte's chansons were published again later in arrangements for voice and lute, as airs de cour, under the name of Adrian Le Roy, the famous French music printer.

Council for Unity provides curriculum in schools, and programs in correctional facilities. \\"Its aim is to give kids a better way of life and keep them out of trouble, including away from gangs.\\" Council for Unity network comprises 60 schools and community centers in New York City, Long Island, Boys and Girls Clubs of America in Texas and California. Council for Unity also has a college chapter at The University of Vermont and has gone international with its chapter in Balti High School in Balti, Moldova. History Robert J. DeSena, a teacher at John Dewey High School, founded Council for Unity in 1975. Mr. Desena brought leaders of different gangs together to bring peace to the school. These African American, Latino, Asian American, Jewish and Italian American leaders put a stop to the violence, and created new friendships. However that was not enough. They wanted to create a program that would promote respect for different cultures throughout the whole school. To do this, new students had to be recruited from all ethnic and racial groups. A racial incident occurred in 1979 that changed the direction of Council for Unity forever. A conflict between Italian Americans and African Americans took place across the street from the school. Many young people were hurt, and the fight threatened to expand to the Dewey students. Immediate action had to be done, so Council mediated the conflict. Peace was restored, but tensions were still high. Council decided to produce a play about the incident titled: \\"A Lifting of Hands\\", which was written by Mr. DeSena. It was performed in the school auditorium. Community leaders, business leaders, politicians, and students from many schools were invited to attend the performance. The audience was extremely moved that requests for other Council chapters poured in from all over the city. At this point in Council's history our leaders realized that mediation was not enough. Something had to be done to prevent violence‚Äînot just react to it. It was then that the Four Pillars of Council for Unity were born. When these four pillars were formed, Council began its expansion into elementary schools, junior high schools, and other high schools besides Dewey. Instead of just bringing students together in one school, it was possible to bring many schools together. =Violence= When a community is faced with violence, Council for Unity provides its anti-gang, violence reduction models to schools and community centers. The child's need for family, safety, self- esteem and responsibility are met through the application of our customized curriculum, obviating the tendency to join anti-social peer groups. By empowering alienated youth to address the problems that plague them, by teaching them values and democratic approaches to solving problems, their sense of impotency dissipates. They become part of the solutions to the issues that beset them and, in turn, become productive citizens. =Racial Tensions= When a community is confronted with racial or ethnic tension, Council for Unity applies its unity model to bring conflicting groups together. Agendas are established that focus on attacking problems rather than individuals. Participants are then directed to seek a common good that benefits all parties. Accomplishments In an independent evaluation commissioned by the New York City Board of Education, The Council for Unity programs generated the following results : :94% of participants graduate from high school :96% of those attend college :70% of participating school principals reported a decrease in violent crime in their schools :100% of participants reported that Council for Unity has had a positive impact on their lives  References  External links: https://councilforunity.org/ Category:Non-profit organizations based in the United States ","title":"Council For Unity"},{"id":"3597488","text":"The Malla Dynasty was the ruling dynasty of the Kathmandu Valley from c. 1201‚Äì1779 CE in Nepal. They have claimed Kshatriya status for themselves.P. 58 Buddhism, Diplomacy, and Trade: The Realignment of Sino-Indian Relations, 600-1400 By Tansen Sen The term Malla mean \\"wrestler\\" in Sanskrit. The first of the Malla kings came to power in Kathmandu Valley around 1200 CE. The Malla period was a golden one that stretched over 600 years, though it was peppered with fighting over the valuable trade routes to Tibet.Bindloss et al. p34. The Mallas were noted for their patronisation of the Maithili language (the language of the Mithila region which includes parts of Nepal and Bihar in India) which was afforded equal status to that of Sanskrit in the Malla court. Maithil Brahmin priests were invited to Kathmandu and many Maithil families settled in Kathmandu during Malla rule.The backbone of the Malla army was also made up of Tirhuti soldiers from Northern Bihar and parts of the Terai. Origin The Malla kings claimed descent from the former king of Mithila, Harisimhadeva as they used to marry princesses of Mithila,who belonged to the Karnat dynasty. Harisimhadeva arrived in Kathmandu after fleeing Muslim invasions in his homeland. History =Early Malla period= Beginning in the early twelfth century, leading notables in Nepal began to appear with names ending in the term malla, (\\"wrestler\\" in Sanskrit), indicating a person of great strength and power. Ari Malla (reigned 1200‚Äì16) was the first king to be so called, and the practice of adopting such a name was followed regularly by rulers in Nepal until the eighteenth century. (The names of the Malla kings were also written as, for example, Ari Malla.) This long Malla period witnessed the continued importance of the Kathmandu Valley as a political, cultural, and economic center of Nepal. Other areas also began to emerge as significant centers in their own right, increasingly connected to the Kathmandu Valley.Savada. History, The Malla Kings. Another Legend says that Ari Dev a Licchavi King was fond of Wrestling so in honour of Wrestling he adapted Malla as a surname and establishing the Malla Clan. With this ended the Licchavi Period and Started the House of Malla making Ari Dev the Last Licchavi King and First Malla King as Ari Malla. The time of the earlier Malla kings was not one of consolidation but was instead a period of upheaval in and around Nepal. In the twelfth century, Muslim Turks set up a powerful kingdom in India at Delhi, and in the thirteenth century,Turko Afghan khaljis expanded their control over most of northern India. During this process, all of the regional kingdoms in India underwent a major reshuffling and considerable fighting before they eventually fell under Delhi's control. This process resulted in an increasing militarization of Nepal's neighbours and sections of Nepal as well. For example, in western Nepal, around Dullu in the Jumla Valley, an alternative seat of political and military power grew up around a separate dynasty of Mallas (who were not related to the Mallas of the Kathmandu Valley), who reigned until the fourteenth century. These Khas kings expanded into parts of western Tibet and sent raiding expeditions into the Kathmandu Valley between 1275 and 1335. In 1312 the Khas king, Ripumalla, visited Lumbini and had his own inscription carved on Ashoka's pillar. He then entered the Kathmandu Valley to worship publicly at Matsyendranath, Pashupatinath, and Swayambhunath. These acts were all public announcements of his overlordship in Nepal and signified the temporary breakdown of royal power within the valley.Savada. History, The Malla Kings. The first Malla rulers had to cope with several disasters. In 1255, one-third of the population of Kathmandu (30,000 people, including King Abhaya Malla) were killed when the valley suffered an earthquake with the epicentre right below the city.Newar. A devastating Muslim invasion by Sultan Shams-ud-din of Bengal in 1345-46, during the reign of Jayaraja Deva (r. 1347‚Äì1361), left plundered Hindu and Buddhist shrines in its wake. The invasion, however, did not leave a lasting cultural effect (unlike in the Kashmir Valley which remains Muslim to this day). In India, the damage was more widespread and many Hindus were driven into the hills and mountains of Nepal, where they established small Rajvanshi principalities. In fact, none of the existing buildings in the valley proper dates from before this raid. He is said to have destroyed the Lichchhavi palaces of Managriha and Kailashkuta. He also damaged all the temples in the Kathmandu valley except the Changu Narayan Temple, which he could not locate as it lies some hills away from Kathmandu. He returned after 3 days of looting and burning. Apart from this, the earlier Malla years (1220‚Äì1482) were largely stable. During the reign of Jayabhimdev Malla in 1260, the eighty artisans were sent to Tibet. Among them was Araniko (1245‚Äì1306) who later rose to become a high-ranking official in the court of Mongol leader Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty.Jing Araniko is the only person from this early Malla era whose biography is known to us in some detail, thanks to the Chinese historical records. Portrait of Jayasthiti Malla (r. 1382-1395) This period reached a high point under the third Malla dynasty of Jayasthiti Malla (r. 1382-1395), who united the valley and codified its laws, including the caste system. The early Malla period, a time of continuing trade and the reintroduction of Nepalese coinage saw the steady growth of the small towns that became Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhadgaon. Royal pretenders in Patan and Bhadgaon struggled with their main rivals, the lords of Banepa in the East, relying on the populations of their towns as their power bases. The citizens of Bhadgaon viewed Devaladevi as the legitimate, independent queen. The betrothal in 1354 of her granddaughter to Jayasthitimalla, a man of obscure but apparently high birth, eventually led to the reunification of the land and a lessening of strife among the towns. By 1370 Jayasthitimalla controlled Patan, and in 1374 his forces defeated those in Banepa and Pharping. He then took full control of the country from 1382 until 1395, reigning in Bhadgaon as the husband of the queen and in Patan with full regal titles. His authority was not absolute because the lords of Banepa were able to pass themselves off as kings to ambassadors of the Chinese Ming emperor who travelled to Nepal during this time. Nevertheless, Jayasthitimalla united the entire valley and its environs under his sole rule, an accomplishment still remembered with pride by Nepalese, particularly Newars. The first comprehensive codification of law in Nepal, based on the dharma of ancient religious textbooks, is ascribed to Jayasthitimalla. This legendary compilation of traditions was seen as the source of legal reforms during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. After the death of Jayasthitimalla, his sons divided the kingdom and ruled collegially, until Jayajyotirmalla, the last surviving son, ruled on his own from 1408 to 1428. His son, Yakshamalla (reigned ca. 1428-82), represented the high point of the Mallas as rulers of a united Nepal. Under his rule, a military raid was launched against the plains to the south, a very rare event in Nepalese history. Yakshamalla built the Mul Chok in 1455, which remains the oldest palace section in Bhadgaon. The struggles among the landed aristocracy and leading town families (Pradhan), especially acute in Patan, were controlled during his reign. Outlying areas such as Banepa and Pharping were semi-independent but acknowledged the leadership of the king. Newari appeared more often as the language of choice in official documents. The royal family began to accept Manesvari (also known as Taleju), a manifestation of Shiva's consort, as their personal deity. After the death of Jayasthiti Malla's grandson Yaksha Malla in 1482, the Kathmandu Valley was divided up among his sons into three kingdoms of Bhaktapur (Khowpa), Kathmandu (Yein) and Lalitpur(Yela:). The rest of what we today call Nepal consisted of a fragmented patchwork of almost 50 independent states, stretching from Palpa and Jumla in the west to the semi-independent states of Banepa and Pharping, most of them minting their own coins and maintaining standing armies. Most notable Malla kings of this later era were: Pratap Malla of Kantipur, Siddhi Narasimha Malla of Lalitpur, and Bhupatindra Malla of Bhaktapur. =Period of three kingdoms= Portrait of King Bhupatindra Malla (r. 1696-1722) Bhaskar Malla of Kathmandu (r. 1700-1714) dressed in Mughal fashion After 1482, a crucial date in Nepalese history, the kingdom became divided. At first, the six sons of Yakshamalla attempted to reign collegially, in their grandfathers' pattern. Ratnamalla was the first to rebel against this system of joint rule, seizing Kathmandu in 1484 and ruling there alone until his death in 1520. Rayamalla, the eldest brother, ruled Bhadgaon with the other brothers until his death, when the crown there passed into the hands of his descendants. Banepa broke away under Ramamalla until its reincorporation into the Bhadgaon kingdom in 1649. Patan remained aloof, dominated by factions of its local nobility, until Sivasimhamalla, a descendant of Ratnamalla, conquered it in 1597 and united it with Kathmandu. On his death, however, Kathmandu and Patan were given to different grandsons and again separated. The center of Nepal thus remained split into three competing kingdoms, roughly based on Bhadgaon, Kathmandu, and Patan. The influence of these petty kingdoms outside the valley varied over time. Bhadgaon extended its feeble power as far as the Dudh Kosi in the east, Kathmandu controlled areas to the north and as far west as Nuwakot, and Patan included territories to the south as far as Makwanpur. The relationships among the kingdoms within the valley became quite convoluted. Although all three ruling houses were related and periodically intermarried, their squabbles over minuscule territorial gains or ritual slights repeatedly led to warfare. The kings attended coronation rituals or marriages at each other's capitals and then plotted the downfalls of their relatives.Savada. History, Three Kingdoms. The period of the three kingdoms‚Äîthe time of the later Mallas‚Äîlasted until the mid-eighteenth century. The complete flowering of the unique culture of the Kathmandu Valley occurred during this period, and it was also during this time that the old palace complexes in the three main towns achieved much of their present-day forms. The Kings still based their legitimate rule on their role as protectors of dharma, and often they were devout donors to religious shrines. Kings built many of the older temples in the valley, gems of late medieval art and architecture, during this late Malla period. Buddhism remained a vital force for much of the population, especially in its old seat of Patan. Religious endowments called guthi arranged for long- term support of traditional forms of worship or ritual by allowing temple or vihara lands to pass down through generations of the same families; this support resulted in the preservation of a conservative art, architecture, and religious literature that had disappeared in other areas of South Asia. Newari was in regular use as a literary language by the fourteenth century and was the main language in urban areas and trading circles based in the Kathmandu Valley. Maithili, the language of the Tirhut area to the south, became a popular court language during the seventeenth century and still was spoken by many people in the Terai in the late twentieth century. In the west, Khas bhasha, or the language of the Khasa, was slowly expanding, only later to evolve into present-day Nepali. The final centuries of Malla rule were a time of great political change outside the Kathmandu Valley. In India overlordship in Delhi fell to the powerful Mughal Dynasty (1526‚Äì1858). Although the Mughals never exercised direct lordship over Nepal, their empire had a major indirect impact on its institutional life. During the sixteenth century, when the Mughals were spreading their rule over almost all of South Asia, many dispossessed princes from the plains of northern India found shelter in the hills to the north. Legends indicated that many small principalities in western Nepal originated in migration and conquest by exiled warriors, who added to the slow spread of the Khasa language and culture in the west. Along with these exiles came Mughal military technology, including firearms and artillery, and administrative techniques based on land grants in return for military service. The influence of the Mughals is reflected in the weapons and dress of Malla rulers in contemporary paintings and in the adoption of Persian terminology for administrative offices and procedures throughout Nepal. Meanwhile, in Tibet domestic struggles during the 1720s led to decisive intervention by the powerful Qing rulers of China (1644‚Äì1911). A Chinese force installed the 6th Dalai Lama (the highest ranking Tibetan religious leaders) in Lhasa in 1728, and thereafter the Chinese stationed military governors (amban) in Lhasa to monitor local events. In 1729 representatives of the three Nepalese kingdoms sent greetings and presents to the Chinese emperor in Beijing, after which the Qing viewed Nepal as an outlying tributary kingdom (a perception not shared within Nepal). The expansion of big empires in both the north and south thus took place during a time when Nepal was experiencing considerable weakness in its traditional center. The three kingdoms lived a charmed life‚Äîisolated, independent, and quarrelling in their mountain valley‚Äîas the systems around them became larger and more centralized. By the seventeenth century, the mountain areas to the north of the valley and the Kiranti region to the east were the only areas that maintained traditional tribal communal systems, influenced to various degrees by Hindu ideas and practices. In the west and the south of the three kingdoms, there were many petty states ruled by dynasties of a warrior (Kshatriya) status, many claiming an origin among princely, or Rajput, dynasties to the south. In the near west, around the Narayani River system (the Narayani was one of the seven Gandak rivers), there was a loose confederation of principalities called the Chaubisi (the Twenty-four), including Makwanpur and Palpa. In the far west, around the Karnali River system, there was a separate confederation called the Baisi (the Twenty-two), headed by the Raja of Jumla. The confederations were in constant conflict, and their member states were constantly quarreling with each other. The kingdoms of Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhadgaon periodically allied themselves with princes among these confederations. All of these small, increasingly militarized states were operating individually at a higher level of centralized organization than ever before in the hills, but they were expending their resources in an almost anarchic struggle for survival. There was an awareness of the distinct culture of the Himalayan area but no real concept of Nepal as a nation. The first contacts between the people of Nepal and Europeans also occurred during the period of the later Mallas. The Portuguese missionaries Jo√£o Cabral and Est√™v√£o Cacella visited Lhasa in 1628, after which Cabral traveled to Nepal. The first Capuchin mission was founded in Kathmandu in 1715. These contacts, however, affected only a minuscule number of people. Of far greater importance was the growth of British power in India, notably in Bengal to the south-east of Nepal, during the eighteenth century. By 1764 the British East India Company, officially a private trading corporation with its own army had obtained from a decaying Mughal Empire the right to govern all of Bengal, at that time one of the most prosperous areas in Asia. The company explored possibilities for expanding its trade or authority into Nepal, Bhutan, and toward Tibet, where the Nepalese had their own trading agencies in important settlements. The increasingly powerful company was emerging as a wild card that could, in theory, be played by one or more of the kingdoms in Nepal during local struggles, potentially opening the entire Himalayan region to British penetration. =End= The Malla dynasty ruled the Kathmandu Valley until Prithvi Narayan Shah of the Gorkha Kingdom invaded it in 1768-69 CE with the Battle of Kirtipur. The last Malla kings were Jaya Prakash Malla of Kantipur (i.e. Kathmandu), Tej Narsingh Malla of Lalitpur and Ranajit Malla of Bhaktapur. Prithvi Narayan Shah and his Gokhali troops surrounded the Kathmandu Valley. Jaya Prakash Malla was all alone. So, to render help, he called the East India Company, which was commanded by the British. There was a massive battle and at the end, the Gorkhali did win. With this, Jay Prakash Malla went to Patan. Then Tej Narasingh Malla and Jaya Prakash Malla fled to Bhaktapur. Similarly, the Gorkhali troops captured Patan and when it came to Bhaktapur, a fight ensued. This resulted in the victory of Prithvi Narayan Shah over Kathmandu Valley and marked the end of Malla period. Jaya Prakash Malla was killed by Prithvi Narayan Shah during the celebration of Indra Jatra. It was a time when all of the people were celebrating, and many of them were unconscious as they were drunk, which gave Prithvi Narayan Shah the advantage to assassinate his fellow rival. Legacy of Malla Dynasty The rivalry between the three kingdoms of the Kathmandu Valley found its expression not only in warfare but also in the arts and culture, which flourished in the competitive climate, quite similar to that of Renaissance Italy. The outstanding collections of exquisite temples and building in each city's Durbar Square are a testament to the huge amounts of money spent by rulers striving to outdo each other. The building boom was financed by trade, in everything from musk and wool to salt, Chinese silk and even yak tails. The Kathmandu Valley stood at the departure point for two separate routes into Tibet, via Banepa to the northeast and via Rasuwa and the Kyirong Valley near Langtang to the north-west. Traders would cross the jungle infested Terai during winter to avoid virulent malaria and then wait in Kathmandu for the mountain passes to open later that summer. Kathmandu grew rich and its rulers converted their wealth into gilded pagodas and ornately carved royal palaces. In the mid-17th century Nepal gained the right to mint Tibet's coins using Tibetan silver, further enriching the kingdom's coffers. In Kathmandu King Pratap Malla (r. 1641-74) oversaw that city's cultural high point with the construction of the Hanuman Dhoka palace, the Rani Pokhari pond and the first of several subsequent pillars that featured a statue of the king facing the protective temples of Taleju, who the Mallas had by that time adopted as their protective deity. The mid-17th century also saw a high point of building in Patan.Bindloss et al. Nepal. p34-35. The Malla era shaped the religious as well as artistic landscape, introducing the dramatic chariot festivals of Indra Jatra and Matsyendranath. The Malla kings shored up their position by claiming to be reincarnations of the Hindu god Vishnu. They also worshipped Kumari, a living goddess believed to be the reincarnation of goddess Taleju.Bindloss et al. Nepal. p35. The cosmopolitan Mallas also absorbed foreign influences. The Indian Mughal court influenced Malla dress and painting, presented the Nepalese with firearms and introduced a system of land grants for military services, a system which would have a profound effect in later years. In the early 18th century, during the reign of Pratap Malla, Capuchin missionaries passed through Nepal to Tibet, and when they returned home gave the West its first description of exotic Kathmandu. After the defeat of the Malla Kings, their surviving descendants left the valley and settled in different parts of Nepal.

The film was directed by John Mackenzie and stars Danny Aiello (as Ruby), Sherilyn Fenn (as Sheryl Ann DuJean a.k.a. Candy Cane), and Arliss Howard. It is based on a play written by British screenwriter Stephen Davis. Ruby was released three months after Oliver Stone's movie JFK. Plot The film begins with Jack Ruby narrating, \\"Lookin' back at it now. What can you say? It feels like it was a dream. Yeah, that's it, a dream. Maybe none of it never happened. Because when I look back on it today, this is the best sense I can make of it.\\" Then the scene shows a murder; a corpse, dressed in a suit, is being drained of blood, having been hung on a meat hook. It is readily apparent that the corpse has been tortured, and it is implied that the presentation of the body is intended to be a brutal message. The next scene switches location to the Carousel Club of Dallas, Texas in 1962, a burlesque club owned by Jack Ruby. It is a slow night at the club, with only a sparse audience for the featured performer, and few bar patrons. The featured dancer, named Telephone Trixie, is unprepared for the show, unenthusiastic, and well beyond her glory days. Ruby regretfully watches her lackluster performance and ruefully observes the disappointing state of his business. Near closing, Ruby leaves the Carousel through a rear/side exit in order to make a rendezvous with two corrupt officers from the Dallas Police Department in order to supply them with narcotics. The next scene shows an attractive young blond woman sitting in front of a mirror applying make-up to a facial bruise; the scene strongly suggests that her sleeping husband or significant other has been abusing her. The next set of scenes follows Ruby as he closes the Carousel Club and makes a stop at an all-night diner which is adjacent to a bus station. Inside the diner, Ruby observes the young blond from the previous scene and stops to speak with her and offer a meal and a place to stay. In the course of discussion between the young woman and Ruby, it is made clear that Jack is not making a sexual advance, and is instead offering lodging in a gesture of platonic friendship. Destitute, desperate, and homeless, the young Sheryl Ann DuJean then accompanies Ruby back to Carousel Club, where Ruby gives her lodging in an apartment in the area above the club. The next day, Ruby has a conversation on the state of Carousel with his bartender, who is established to be a young Cuban exile named Diego. Ruby's troubles are further amplified by the appearance cancellation of the next featured dancer who was scheduled to appear on stage. Having heard Ruby's conversation about the cancellation, Sheryl Ann offers to perform for Ruby during his police appreciation show that night. Ruby, reluctant to believe that the innocent and demure Sheryl Ann is stripper material, is desperate and left with no other choice than to allow her to dance. Sheryl Ann adopts the stage name Candy Cane and then takes the stage only to wow the law enforcement crowd with her skilled and enthusiastic performance. Even the jaded Jack Ruby is surprised by her expertise, and realizes she is experienced as a stripper. The crowd reacts enthusiastically, and things begin to look up for Jack Ruby as he has a showstopper as a featured dancer, and a chance at revitalizing his business. Ruby and Candy Cane come to understanding that they be truthful, and a friendship develops between the two. Shortly after the upswing in business, Jack is contacted by one of his former mob associates, named Louie Vitali, about performing a black bag job in Cuba which the murder victim, Action Jackson, seen in the opening scene, was originally assigned to. Ruby confers with Candy Cane and he ends up inviting her to go along with him to communist Cuba. Once in Cuba, Ruby meets with Vitali and they meet with the elderly and imprisoned Sicilian mobster Santos Alicante, who has been in jail in Cuba since the 1959 communist takeover after his casino hotel was closed down. Vitali tells Ruby that they are to spring Santos from Cuba to put him back in place in the US as part of a complex operation plan. However, after their visit, Vitali accompanies Ruby back to his and Candy's hotel room where he secretly tells him the real reason for this assignment; he wants Ruby to kill Santos because the people that Vitali works for feel that Santos has outgrown his usefulness to them. Vitali gives Ruby an 8 mm film camera that has a pistol encased in it to carry out the killing. But that evening, Ruby instead kills Vitali on the dock near the prison and springs Santos from his cell by bribing the guards, and then he, Santos, and Candy flee Cuba aboard Vitali's boat back to America. After arriving in New Orleans, Ruby makes contact with David Ferrie, an old friend from his days in Chicago, to supply him with the necessary papers enabling Santos to re-enter the country. Shortly after, Ruby and Candy return to Dallas, while Santos goes off on his own. Several months later, Ruby, still managing the Carousel Club in which Candy is now the star attraction, has an encounter one evening when Candy's estranged and abusive husband, Hank, shows up and confronts her after the show in her apartment, wanting her to return to him. Ruby beats up Candy/Sheryl Ann's husband and warns him never to come back to the club. The next day, a mysterious man, identifying himself only by his name of 'Maxwell', pays a visit to Ruby at the currently closed club to talk with him about the killing of Vitali and of the release of Santos from Cuba. With a clearly implied threat of arrest and incarceration, Maxwell wants Ruby to redeem himself to the people that Maxwell works for by being an informant for him on Santos, who has since opened up a new hotel and casino in Las Vegas since his return to the United States as well as Santos' affiliates. Maxwell supplies Ruby with a mini-tape recorder to assist, and Ruby makes the assumption that Maxwell works for the CIA, which Maxwell neither denies or admits. Ruby and Candy travel to Las Vegas and check into Santos' new hotel, where a gala event is taking place that involves a stage performance by singer Tony Montana. Ruby is also suspicious when a helicopter arrives and drops off the President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, who is attending the event. Candy attends the event with David Ferrie, who sits with her at the table where the President is sitting, while Ruby sits with Santos and several like-minded people who are clearly connected to organized crime. Recording the conversation, the men want Ruby to smuggle into Cuba \\"special cigars\\" for Fidel Castro to assassinate him for the loss of all their casinos and business since the 1959 takeover. When Ruby excuses himself to go outside, he meets with Maxwell in the hotel parking lot, where he drives Ruby outside the city and reveals another assignment for him to partake in the assassination of a prominent official, implying it to be Castro. The next day, Candy tells Ruby that the people that Santos works with want her to stay in Las Vegas to perform as a singer in their hotels, thanks to some presidential connections that she managed to get hold of. Ruby returns to Dallas alone, while he makes use of free time by shooting at watermelons and other targets from a distance in preparation for his next assassination assignment. Sometime later, Ruby talks with Lenny, an old friend of his, about assignments for CIA associates and Lenny tells Ruby that to take out a \\"target\\" relies on two or more rifle marksmen and a \\"patsy\\" or \\"fall guy\\" to be caught in order to place all the blame for the crime to divert suspicion away from the investigating authorities. Meanwhile, Diego the bartender meets with David Ferrie. They travel to New Orleans and make contact with Lee Harvey Oswald, whom they ask to talk about going in on a job. Back in Dallas, Ruby meets with Santos, Sam Giaccana, and their men at another meeting where Giaccana tells Ruby that his assignment to take out Castro has been canceled because another matter has come up. Giaccana tells Ruby that the CIA has been having troubles with President Kennedy over the Cuba issue and wanting to reveal the CIA's true nature. After Ruby leaves, Giaccana meets with Maxwell for a talk. Returning to his club, Ruby sees Candy there, who tells him that she quit her career tour which included performances for the President because she felt they were taking advantage of her and her charms. It is implied that Candy had shared some intimate time with Kennedy and possibly others. While Ruby and Candy decide to revise the club with a new classy act as a singing club, he begins to figure out what Maxwell and the mob associates are doing: planning a high- level assassination. Ruby tells his boss, Proby, that from his views and experiences in the past several months, the CIA and the Mafia work together to stage and carry out contract killings, and get away with it by subcontracting third parties to carry out the work. Proby has some doubts, but he tells Ruby to leave the matter alone for he cannot blow the lid on a complex conspiracy such as this. On November 22, 1963, JFK arrives in Dallas, where Maxwell meets with Oswald, Diego, and two other henchmen, where he tells them their assignments. While Ruby is at a newspaper office to file a new listing for his club, Candy is watching the President's limo convoy ride through the city. It is shown that Diego, with Oswald as the handler, shoots Kennedy from the sixth-floor window of the Dallas Book Depository, while the second assassin, and his handler, fire the fatal shot, killing Kennedy from the grassy knoll section near the building to the building. After watching the events on a TV set, a distraught Ruby returns to his club, where Proby is rummaging through his desk to look for the audio tape of the recording of the conversation Ruby had in Las Vegas with Santos and his associates, but the tape is gone. Ruby tells Proby, who has not heard about the assassination, that their enemies have won. The following day, David Ferrie pays a visit to Ruby at the club where they watch a TV broadcast about the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald and that he also was arrested for killing Officer Tippit, a regular customer at the club. Ferrie tells Ruby to forget that they ever met and that he shouldn't do anything stupid for he calls Ruby only a \\"small time hood\\". Ruby vows he will make the world understand. The next day, Ruby goes to the Dallas county jail where Oswald is being transferred and fatally shoots him. Ruby is immediately arrested by the police‚Äîjust as he wanted them to. In jail, Ruby refuses to give a statement to his lawyer about his motivation and demands that he be taken to Washington to testify before a Senate committee about what he knows. At Ruby's trial, he refuses to offer an insanity defense for the murder of Oswald and is convicted and sentenced to death. Ruby sees Maxwell as one of the spectators during the trial and knows that Maxwell had some hand in work behind the scenes that has led to his conviction. Ruby appeals the verdict, but aware that the conspirators are monitoring his visits, continues to demand that he be taken to Washington to testify, but he is refused. Several months later, while still in prison awaiting an appeal, Candy visits Ruby to offer him moral support for his actions, while he tells her not to visit him again and to move far away so the members of the conspiracy will not find her. After Candy leaves Ruby for good, he remains in jail while over the next several months, he believes that the conspirators are slowly killing him inside when he is forcibly given injections. In a final disclaimer, it is said that Ruby died from cancer in jail in 1967 and that his request to testify before a Senate hearing was never granted.

The film was released to mixed reviews from critics and currently holds a 45% \\"rotten\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 11 reviews from critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two out of four stars, commending Aiello's performance and ability to create a tortured and well-meaning character, but criticizing an overall lack of historical accuracy, which he felt affected the pace of the film.

Agase grew up in Illinois and attended the University of Illinois, where he was a standout as a guard starting in 1941. He was named an All-American in 1942. Agase then entered the U.S. Marines during World War II and played a season at Purdue while in training. He was again named an All-American in 1943. After his discharge from the Marines, he came back to Illinois and played a final season in 1946, after which he was named an All-American for a third time. Agase began his professional football career with the Los Angeles Dons of the All- America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1947, but was soon traded to the Chicago Rockets and then the Browns, where he remained until 1952. Cleveland won two AAFC championships and one National Football League championship while Agase was on the team. After retiring from football, Agase worked as an assistant coach for the Dallas Texans and, after a brief return to playing for the Baltimore Colts, Iowa State University. He was hired as an assistant at Northwestern in 1956 under head coach Ara Parseghian. Agase remained as an assistant until Parseghian left to coach at Notre Dame in 1963 and he was named the new head coach. Agase guided the Northwestern Wildcats to a 32‚Äì58‚Äì1 win-loss-tie record in nine seasons. He was named coach of the year by the Football Writers Association of America after guiding the team to a 6‚Äì4 record in 1970. Agase left to coach at Purdue in 1972, but none of his teams posted a winning record there, and he was fired in 1977. He then spent six years as athletic director at Eastern Michigan University before retiring. Agase died in 2007. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1963. Early life and college Agase was born in Chicago to an Assyrian father, Charles Agase (1883‚Äì1959), and an Armenian mother, Elsie Darwitt (1892‚Äì1971). Both were born in Persia. He attended Evanston Township High School, but only played on the school's varsity football team in his senior year. After graduating, he attended the University of Illinois and played college football there as a right guard in 1941 and 1942. In a 1942 game against the University of Minnesota, Agase scored two touchdowns for the Fighting Illini, becoming only the second guard in college football history to accomplish that feat. The first touchdown came in the second quarter, when Agase stripped the ball from Minnesota's Bill Daley and ran it back 35 yards. The second was a fourth- quarter fumble recovery in the end zone to give Illinois a 20‚Äì13 victory. In another game against Great Lakes Naval Training Station, a military team, Agase had 22 tackles. Under coach Ray Eliot, Illinois finished the season with a 6‚Äì4 win-loss record. Agase was named an All-American after the season. Agase entered the U.S. military in 1943 as America's involvement in World War II intensified. He was sent to Purdue University for training in the U.S. Marines and played on the school's football team along with enlistees from other schools. Purdue had won just one Big Ten Conference game the previous year, but the influx of trainees including Agase led to a reversal of fortune in 1943. Coached by Elmer Burnham, the Purdue Boilermakers won all of their games that year and were named Big Ten co-champions. Agase was again named an All- American. During the following two years, Agase served on active duty in the war. He participated in the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, where he received a Purple Heart after he was wounded in action. He rose to the rank of first lieutenant. Agase returned to Illinois in 1946 and rejoined a Fightining Illini team that posted an 8‚Äì2 record and was ranked fifth in the nation in the AP Poll at season's end. Illinois beat the UCLA Bruins in the 1947 Rose Bowl after the season. Agase was named an All-American for a third time, and received the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the most valuable player in the Big Ten. Professional football career Agase had been selected by the Green Bay Packers in the 1944 NFL Draft, but military service delayed his professional career. Although Green Bay still held the rights to him when he graduated from college, Agase instead signed in 1947 with the Los Angeles Dons of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Agase, however, played just three games for the Dons before he was traded in September 1947 to the Chicago Rockets, another AAFC team. The Rockets finished the season in last place in the AAFC's western division with a 1‚Äì13 record. The Rockets traded Agase and fellow lineman Chubby Grigg the following year to the Cleveland Browns, who had won the AAFC championship in each of the league's first two years of play. Led by quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie, Cleveland won the championship again in 1948, posting a perfect 14‚Äì0 record and beating the Buffalo Bills in the title game. Another championship followed in 1949, but the AAFC then dissolved and the Browns, along with two other teams, were absorbed by the NFL. Helped by a strong offensive line including Agase, center Frank Gatski and tackles Lou Groza and Lou Rymkus, Cleveland won the NFL championship in 1950. The team reached the NFL championship in 1951 but lost to the Los Angeles Rams. Cleveland lost 24‚Äì17 despite gaining more yards and more first downs than the Rams. \\"It was a very disappointing loss\\", Agase later said. \\"We weren't quite as sharp as we normally were on offense.\\" Coaching career Before the 1952 season, the Browns traded Agase to the Dallas Texans, a newly formed team set to start play that year. He ended his playing career and signed as a line coach with the Texans under head coach Jim Phelan. The Texans finished with a 1‚Äì11 record and folded after the season. Agase came out of retirement briefly after the Texans disbanded, joining the Baltimore Colts and playing as a linebacker for the 1953 season. The Colts finished the season with a 3‚Äì9 record, placing fifth in the NFL West division. =Iowa State and Northwestern= Agase was offered a job as an assistant coach for the Colts, but instead joined Iowa State University as its line coach in early 1954 on a $7,000-a-year salary. He and Iowa State head coach Vince DiFrancesca had played football together in high school. After two seasons at Iowa State, he signed as defensive line coach at Northwestern University. He worked under head coach Ara Parseghian, a former Cleveland teammate. In seven years under Parseghian at Northwestern, Agase rose to become the coach's top assistant. When Parseghian was offered the head coaching job at the University of Notre Dame at the end of 1963, he recommended Agase as his replacement. Agase got the job immediately after Parseghian left. Agase's first years as coach of the Northwestern Wildcats football team were unsuccessful. The team had losing records each season between 1964 and 1969. In 1970, however, the team finished with a 6‚Äì4 record, taking second place in the Big Ten Conference, and Agase was named the national coach of the year by the Football Writers Association of America. The Wildcats followed up with a 7‚Äì4 record in 1971, but fell to 2‚Äì9 in 1972. =Purdue= After nine seasons as the Northwestern coach, Agase accepted an offer at the end of 1972 to become head football coach at Purdue, one of the two schools for which he played. Taking the job was \\"not an easy decision to make\\", he said at the time, because he was happy at Northwestern. Agase coached at Purdue through the 1976 season. His teams never posted a winning record in his years there, although they did pull two noteworthy upsets of Top Ten teams, defeating #2 Notre Dame in South Bend in 1974 and #1 Michigan in West Lafayette in 1976. He was fired in early 1977 and took a job as athletic director at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan. He stayed in that job until 1982, when he unexpectedly resigned citing \\"personal reasons\\". Later life and death Agase remained active in college football by assisting Bo Schembechler as a volunteer at the University of Michigan until 1987, focusing on special teams. He was named to the Walter Camp Foundation all-century team in 1989 and the University of Illinois all-century team in 1990. Agase was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1963. While living in Tarpon Springs, Florida, Agase was an active member of George Young United Methodist Church, later renamed East Lake United Methodist Church. He died in 2007 at a hospital near his home in Tarpon Springs, Florida.

Sentenced to 10 years in prison, he escaped and fled to Odessa (part of Imperial Russia at the time), returning with money and new instructions.

The attempt, however, failed: the bomb placed under Argetoianu's train coach destroyed the empty half of the coach. On 8 December 1920, Goldstein, with the support Leon Lichtblau and Saul Ozias, organized another politically motivated bombing. Their improvised explosive device, made from an unexploded German 76 mm artillery shell from World War I, and placed in front of the Romanian Senate, killed Minister of Justice Dimitrie Greceanu and two senators (Demetriu Radu and Spirea Gheorghiu), and wounded the president of the Senate, Constantin CoandƒÉ.

Gill & Macmillan, 2002. is a small village and townland in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, 10 miles from Enniskillen. It is on the County Fermanagh/County Cavan border beside the village of Blacklion in the Republic of Ireland. It had a population (with Holywell) of 540 in the 2011 Census. It is situated within the Fermanagh and Omagh District. The Lough MacNean Tourism Initiative has been in operation since 2003, and is an economy building project, aimed at addressing tourism needs in the area while promoting cross- border relations. Belcoo Enterprise Ltd opened in 1992 in units shared with the Belcoo Historical Society, a doctor's surgery, a chiropodist and Lakeland Community Care. The Mullycovet corn mill, which functioned from 1830 until the 1920s, is being restored. The Indigenous Resources School of Transferable Skills aims to teach marginalised groups including the unemployed, New Age travellers, the disabled, to use natural materials as a learning facility.  History  The earliest mention of the village is in the old Ulster Saga \\"\\" also known as \\"\\" (Massacre of Belcu Brefne). This tells the tale of a trap set for the great Ulster hero Conall Cernach by a Breifne chief named Belcu Brefne. However Conall manages to reverse the trap and causes Belcu's sons to kill Belcu by mistake. The place where the tale occurs was later named Belcu or sometimes Belcon in honour of Belcu. Isaac Butler in his book \\"A Journey to Lough Derg\\" written in c. 1749 states- See \\"Dabhach Ph√°draig: St Patrick's Holy Well, Belcoo, County Fermanagh\\", by Mairead O'Dolain, in the Clogher Record, Volume 18, No. 1, pp.103-116. (viewable on JSTOR). A modern interpretation however states that the name of the village derives from the meaning mouth and or meaning narrowing, referring to the village's position on a narrow neck of water (river) between Upper and Lower Lough MacNean. This interpretation is given support, firstly in the 14th century Book of Magauran where it is mentioned several times as Cunga, secondly in an Inquisition held at Dromahair on 22 July 1607 which described the boundaries of County Leitrim inter alia as- and so to Beallacowngamore, and then to Beallucowngabegg, and thirdly by the name of the place on the 1609 Ulster Plantation map where it is named 'Kiliconge', i.e. Coille Cunga meaning \\"The Wood of the Narrow Strip of Land\\". The townland to the immediate north of Belcoo continues this interpretation as it is called Drumcoo, i.e. The Hill of the Narrow Strip of Land. Another often used derivation is i.e. where is the word for hound. Hence the village name would mean \\"The Mouth of the Hound\\". M√°ire MacNeill in her book \\"The Festival of Lughnasa\\", 1962, gives a local Belcoo folktale about balefire coming out of a hound's mouth before it is killed by Saint Patrick. This tale is also found in Glangevlin folktales.Supplement. Seanchas Ghleann Ghaibhle: Glangevlin Folk-Lore, by √âamonn √ì Tuathail, in B√©aloideas Iml. 4, Uimh 4 (1934), pp. i, iii‚Äìv, vii‚Äìxxxviii, page 16. In the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the English Army erected a fort at Belcoo which can be seen on the Down Survey maps of 1655. When the Irish surrendered at Cavan on 27 April 1653, paragraph 7 of the Articles of Surrender stated-\\"That Collonel Reily with the partie now with him on the west side of Loughern lay downe their armes, and deliver such forts in the islands, with all the amunicion and provision therein that is in his powre, at or before the 18 May next, at Crohan, and Collonel Hugh Me Guier's regiment to lay downe their armes the 18 May next, at 'Belcowe fort', in the county of Fermanagh, and all others of his partie included in these articles are to lay downe their armes in the severall counties where their quarters are, in such places as the Governors of the several counties shall apoynt.\\"Gilbert, John T. A Contemporary History of Affairs in Ireland from 1641 to 1652 p374 The fort was still in existence in 1700, as an entry in the Calendar of Treasury Books dated 1 June 1700 states there was \\"1 foot soldier at Belcoe who receives an allowance of ¬£14 per annum in respect of fire and candle for the Barracks\\" In Seamus Pender's \\"A Census of Ireland, Circa 1659\\", the village is called \\"Belcow\\". In 1718, John Dolan of Fermanagh wrote- About ye middle of Lough Earn there is but a small arm like a large river for about an English mile and over this arm is a fine large ford called Belcoo, whereon stands a barrack on ye north side; and on ye south side of this a skirt of ye county Cavan borders ye said lough. Near Belcoo is a holy well consecrated by St Patrick wherein are miracles yearly wrought upon devout persons by performing their stations with true devotion are often restored to sight and limb and of other distempers by virtue of ye said water and by ye grace of God, (pp. 134-136, viewable on JSTOR).'An Early History of Fermanagh', ed. by P. √ì Maolag√°in, in Clogher Record, Vol. 1, No. 3 (1955), pp. 131-140 and Vol. 2, No. 2 (1958), pp. 280-292 In his book \\"Upper Lough Erne\\", written in 1739, Reverend William Henry states, \\"Lough Macnane ... is contracted into a narrow, deep canal, in which form it flows through a flat meadow for half a mile to the redoubt of Bellcoe, where is a good ford and a new bridge across it. From the ford, the lake, expanding again, continues for three miles more\\". Matthew Sleater's Directory of 1806 states \\"Belcoo-bridge (which leads to Garrison in Fermanagh County) over a river containing the two lakes called Lough Macnean, which extends along this road 6 miles\\". About two miles north-east of Belcoo is Gardenhill, an old derelict homestead. It is located on the side of a hill in Gardenhill townland, just off the sideroad from Belcoo to Boho. Parts of this old homestead possibly date from the early years of the Plantation of Ulster in the early seventeenth-century. It was rented, and later owned, by the Hassard family for around 300 years. Gardenhill is privately owned and is not open to the public. = 20th century = With the Partition of Ireland in 1921, Belcoo became a border village. On 28 March 1922, during the Irish War of Independence, a column of fifty Irish Republican Army volunteers crossed from County Cavan and seized the Royal Irish Constabulary barracks in Belcoo after a three-hour battle. Fifteen RIC officers were captured and marched across the border and held until 18 July.McKenna, Guerrilla Warfare in the Irish War of Independence, pp.266‚Äì267 Belcoo was one of several Catholic border villages in Fermanagh that would have been transferred to the Irish Free State had the recommendations of the Irish Boundary Commission been enacted in 1925. See also The Troubles in Belcoo, which includes a list of incidents in Belcoo during the Troubles resulting in two or more fatalities.  Transport  Restored level crossing gates, platform and station building, now a private residence. Belcoo is situated on the A4 road from Enniskillen, at the point where it reaches the border with the Republic of Ireland and becomes the N16 to Sligo. Buses on the Enniskillen to Bundoran Ulsterbus Service 64, operated by Translink, stop here. The village formerly had a small railway station on the railway line serving Sligo and Leitrim and Enniskillen. In 1878 a stationmaster's house and six houses were built for railway workers and their families and the following year the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway line opened with Belcoo station serving both Belcoo and Blacklion. Belcoo railway station opened on 18 March 1879, and closed on 1 October 1957. The last trains ran through the station on 20 September 1957. Bus √âireann calls at Belcoo on the service Sligo-Manorhamilton-Enniskillen Expressway route 66.  2011 Census On Census Day (27 March 2011) the usually resident population of Belcoo / Holywell Settlement was 540 accounting for 0.03% of the NI total. * 100.00% were from the white (including Irish Traveller) ethnic group; * 89.44% belong to or were brought up in the Catholic religion and 7.22% belong to or were brought up in a 'Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)' religion; and * 12.04% indicated that they had a British national identity, 61.67% had an Irish national identity and 25.74% had a Northern Irish national identity*. * 24.42% had some knowledge of Irish; * 3.08% had some knowledge of Ulster-Scots; and * 1.73% did not have English as their first language.

It was developed by Koren and neuroscientist Michael Persinger to study creativity, religious experience and the effects of subtle stimulation of the temporal lobes. Reports by participants of a \\"sensed presence\\" while wearing the God helmet brought public attention and resulted in several TV documentaries. The device has been used in Persinger's research in the field of neurotheology, the study of the purported neural correlations of religion and spirituality. The apparatus, placed on the head of an experimental subject, generates very weak magnetic fields, that Persinger refers to as \\"complex\\". Like other neural stimulation with low-intensity magnetic fields, these fields are approximately as strong as those generated by a land line telephone handset or an ordinary hair dryer, but far weaker than that of an ordinary refrigerator magnet and approximately a million times weaker than transcranial magnetic stimulation. Persinger reports that many subjects have reported \\"mystical experiences and altered states\\" while wearing the God Helmet. The foundations of his theory have been criticized in the scientific press. Anecdotal reports by journalists,Wired magazine article academicsOnline video excerpt, see 2:00 to 3:26 and documentaristsIncomplete filmography for Dr. M.A. Persinger have been mixed and several effects reported by Persinger have not yet been independently replicated. One attempt at replication published in the scientific literature reported a failure to reproduce Persinger's effects and the authors proposed that the suggestibility of participants, improper blinding of participants or idiosyncratic methodology could explain Persinger's results. Persinger argues that the replication was technically flawed, but the researchers have stood by their replication. Only one group has published a direct replication of one God Helmet experiment. Other groups have reported no effects at all or have generated similar experiences by using sham helmets, or helmets that are not turned on, and have concluded that personality differences in the participants explain these unusual experiences.  Development  The God Helmet was not specifically designed to elicit visions of God, but to test several of Persinger's hypotheses about brain function. The first of these is the Vectorial Hemisphericity Hypothesis, which proposes that the human sense of self has two components, one on each side of the brain, that ordinarily work together but in which the left hemisphere is usually dominant. Persinger argues that the two hemispheres make different contributions to a single sense of self, but under certain conditions can appear as two separate 'selves'. Persinger and Koren designed the God Helmet in an attempt to create conditions in which contributions to the sense of self from both cerebral hemispheres is disrupted. The second experimental hypothesis was that when communication between the left and right senses of self is disturbed, as they report it is while wearing the God Helmet, the usually-subordinate 'self' in the right hemisphere intrudes into the awareness of the left-hemispheric dominant self, causing what Persinger refers to as \\"interhemispheric intrusions\\". The third hypothesis was that \\"visitor experiences\\" could be explained by such \\"interhemispheric intrusions\\" caused by a disruption in \\"vectorial hemisphericity\\". Persinger theorises that many paranormal experiences, feelings of having lived past lives, felt presences of non-physical beings, ghosts, muses, and other \\"spiritual beings\\", are examples of interhemispheric intrusions (an idea originally proposed in 1976 in Julian Jaynes' bicameralism hypothesis). The God Helmet experiments were also intended, though not specifically designed (see above), to validate the idea that religious and mystic experiences are artifacts of temporal lobe function.  The device  Persinger uses a modified snowmobile helmet that incorporates solenoids placed over the temporal lobes. This device produces magnetic fields that Persinger describes as \\"weak but complex\\" (1 microTesla). The pattern of fluctuation in these magnetic fields is derived from physiological sources, for example patterns that appear in EEG traces taken from limbic structures. The purpose of exposing magnetic fields patterned after neurophysiological sources, such as the burst-firing profile of the amygdala, is to enhance the probability of activating the structure from which the signal was derived. The sessions are conducted with the subject seated in an acoustic chamber. The acoustic chamber is also a Faraday cage, shielding out all EMF emissions and radiation except the Earth's magnetic field. Persinger reports that this shielding allows him to use the apparatus to investigate the effects of geomagnetism on the human brain. = Comparison with TMS = Neither the God Helmet, nor technologies derived from it, are examples of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which uses magnetic fields on the order of one million times stronger than those used in Persinger's lab. Despite this, Persinger reports similar effect sizes with his apparatus. The magnetic fields employed in TMS and in Persinger's experiments are also very different. TMS uses single, paired, and repetitive pulses of high intensity to penetrate the cranium. In contrast, Persinger's apparatus uses weak complex magnetic signals patterned after physiological processes, such as one derived from limbic burst firing.  Experiences  Most reports from Persinger's lab consist of people sensing \\"presences\\"; people often interpreted these to be that of angels, a deceased being known to the subject, or a group of beings of some kind. There have also been reports in which the participant has experienced what they perceive as God. Persinger reports that \\"at least\\" 80 percent of his participants experience a presence beside them in the room, and others report less evocative experiences of \\"another consciousness or sentient being\\". = Anecdotal reports = The scientist and science writer Richard Dawkins, appearing in the BBC science documentary series Horizon, did not have a 'sensed presence' experience,Video footage, see 3:04-7 and 3:32-43 but instead felt at times 'slightly dizzy', 'quite strange' and had sensations in his limbs and changes in his breathing. He summarised his experience as follows: \\"It pretty much felt as though I was in total darkness, with a helmet on my head and pleasantly relaxed\\". Persinger explained Dawkins' limited results in terms of his low score on a psychological scale measuring temporal lobe sensitivity.BBC Article In contrast, the experimental psychologist, and former parapsychology researcher, Susan Blackmore said: \\"When I went to Persinger's lab and underwent his procedures I had the most extraordinary experiences I've ever had‚Ä¶ I'll be surprised if it turns out to be a placebo effect.\\" Jack Hitt, a journalist from Wired magazine, visited Persinger's lab in 1999 and expressed confusion over Persinger's post-stimulation debriefing (\\"One question: Did the red bulb on the wall grow larger or smaller? There was a red bulb on the wall? I hadn't noticed.\\") and reported: \\"Many other questions suggest that there were other experiences I should have had, but to be honest, I didn't. In fact, as transcendental experiences go, on a scale of 1 to 10, Persinger's helmet falls somewhere around, oh, 4. Even though I did have a fairly convincing out-of-body experience, I'm disappointed relative to the great expectations and anxieties I had going in.\\"  Replication attempts and debate  In December 2004 Nature reported that a group of Swedish researchers led by Pehr Granqvist, a psychologist at Uppsala University in Sweden, had attempted to replicate Persinger's experiments under double-blind conditions, and were not able to reproduce the effect. The study was published in Neuroscience Letters in 2005. Granqvist et al concluded that the presence or absence of the magnetic field had no relationship with any religious or spiritual experience reported by the participants, but was predicted entirely by their suggestibility and personality traits. Persinger, however, took issue with the Swedish attempt to replicate his work. \\"They didn't replicate it, not even close,\\" he says. He argued that the Swedish group did not expose the subjects to magnetic fields for long enough to produce an effect. Granqvist et al. respond that Persinger agreed with their proposed methodology beforehand and they stand by their replication. The theoretical basis for the God helmet, especially the connection between temporal lobe function and mystic experiences, has also been questioned. Only one group unconnected to Persinger's lab has so far succeeded in replicating the effects of one of Persinger's early studies. They reported that their experiment had ruled out suggestibility as an explanation for Persinger's effects, and that analysis of their subjects‚Äô verbal reports revealed significant differences between the speech of subjects and controls, as well as less robust effects for suggestion and expectation. Other groups have subsequently found that individual differences such as strong belief in the paranormal and magical ideation predict some alterations in consciousness and reported \\"exceptional experiences\\" when Persinger et al's experimental set-up and procedure are reproduced, but with a sham \\"God helmet\\" that is completely inert or a helmet that is turned off. These groups have concluded that psychological factors must have played an important role in prior experiments.  Related devices and studies  Persinger and colleagues also developed a device nicknamed \\"The Octopus\\" which uses solenoids around the whole brain, in a circle just above subject's ears. Commercial versions of the God helmet, Octopus and associated devices are sold by Persinger‚Äôs research associate Todd Murphy, and he reports that his devices are able to modulate emotional states in addition to enhancing meditation and generating altered states. One experiment found no changes in emotional responses to photographs whether the device was on or off, Persinger and colleagues report significant changes in subjects' EEG during stimulation with a Shakti system. In one report by Persinger's lab, published in the fringe journal NeuroQuantology, these changes were correlated with an out-of-body experience. One published attempt to test Persinger's theories regarding the psychological effects of environmental magnetic fields, used whole-body exposure to magnetic fields and ultrasound in freely-moving participants to create a \\"haunted room\\" within which it was hoped subjects would sense a \\"presence\\". The study found that reports of unusual experiences were unrelated with the presence or absence of \\"complex\\" environmental electromagnetic fields similar to Persinger's. They concluded that the effects were likely due to suggestibility, though they did not directly measure it.

It may be made from soft leather, canvas, or satin, and has flexible, thin full or split soles. Traditionally, women wear pink shoes and men wear white or black shoes. Skin colored slippers‚Äîwhich are unobtrusive and thus give the appearance of dancing barefoot‚Äîare worn in modern ballets and sometimes modern dancing by both men and women. Typically, in a ballet class, male dancers wear ballet slippers throughout the class whereas female dancers wear ballet slippers at the beginning and then may change into pointe shoes. Construction Ballet shoes traditionally have a leather sole which does not reach all the way to the edges of the shoe. A modern development is the split sole, which provides greater flexibility and emphasizes the shape of the foot when pointed. They are usually made from soft leather, canvas or satin. Leather shoes are long- lasting. Canvas shoes are less expensive but wear faster than average leather ballet shoes. Satin shoes are often used for performances but can wear out very quickly. Shoes are secured with the use of elastic, most often with a single band across the arch of the foot, or with two bands that cross in an \\"X\\" shape at the top of the arch. In the case of double band shoes, some ballet slipper manufacturers will attach one end of each band to the shoe as part of the production process, and leave it to the purchaser to attach the free ends of the bands for optimal fit.  History  Women began to dance ballet in 1682, twenty years after King Louis XIV of France ordered the founding of the Royal Academy of Dance. At that time, the standard women's ballet shoe had heels. Mid 18th century dancer Marie Camargo of the Paris Op√©ra Ballet was the first to wear a non-heeled shoe. After the French Revolution, heels were completely eliminated from standard ballet shoes, as they still are.

A View of Church Road and The Golden Gates Tower (build c. 1841) Nearby towns and cities: Chippenham, Calne, Devizes Nearby villages: Studley, Lacock, Pewsham, Sandy Lane History Derry Hill has grown out of the ancient settlement of Studley. In the 18th century, there were several small settlements along the London to Bristol road, near the north-west corner of Bowood House Park; among them, a settlement known as Red Hill, possibly squatters' cottages. Most houses now standing in the village are built in the 19th or 20th century, with some 19th-century ones built on 18th-century house sites. The village traditionally provided houses for the Bowood estate workers. The estate's Christ Church has helped the village develop in the early 19th century. Later, in 1843, the school was built, again with help from the Bowood estate. Previously to the school being built, classes for the village children were held in various locations around the village. In addition to these facilities a village hall and reading room was built. The street lighting was installed in 1878. The main development has taken place since the early-1970s, when a new housing estate, consisting of about 220 houses, was built in the fields immediately to the north of village‚Äîbetween the old road, leading to the Devizes road, and the present A4 road. Until then, the village was essentially one road; as a result, the population grew sharply, requiring the school's extension. Further stages of development took place around the village in the 1990s. A new village hall was built in 2000, and named the Lansdowne Hall in memory of the 8th Lord Lansdowne, who had died in 1997. A small building called the Well House was restored by the Wiltshire Historic Buildings Trust in 2002‚Äì2003.Colin Johns, Wiltshire Historic Buildings Trust 1967‚Äì2007 (2007) ‚Äì full text online, p. 29 In late-2006 a housing development of 25 new homes commenced on village land adjacent to the A4 national route, and a small number of large, individual new homes were also built during 2005‚Äì2006. The original hamlet of Derry Hill, now known as 'Old Derry Hill', lies at the foot of the hill, between the A4/A342 junction and the Lysley Arms, previously known as the Swan. Amenities The village has a village shop called the 'Village Stores', a Church of England parish church (built in 1840), a primary school, a pre-school, a pub known since 1838 as the Lansdowne Arms (its present building dating back to 1843), and a modern village hall (built in 2000). Local government Derry Hill lies within the Parish of Calne Without, which also includes the villages of Studley and Sandy Lane. At the former district level it was part of North Wiltshire District Council until 2009 (based in Chippenham) and at county level is part of Wiltshire, now a Unitary Authority. The village is in the North Wiltshire parliamentary constituency. Church Derry Hill Christchurch is on Church Road, next to the Primary School. It was erected for the parish of Derry Hill, Bowood, Pewsham and Sandy Lane in 1839‚Äì1840. The Church was built to a design by T.H. Wyatt and D. Brandon, in the Late Perpendicular Gothic style, in dressed stone, and decorated inside. There were three banks of pews (556 seats) in a wide nave with a small sanctuary. The West tower with a needle spire was provided by the 3rd Lord Lansdowne, at a cost of ¬£111. Later, ca.1862, an organ was provided. Before the choir stalls were built in 1953‚Äì1954, the choir had sung from the gallery. Other improvements to the church in the 20th century included re-seating the nave in 1936, and replacing the stone roof tiles with slate, together with other general repairs, in 1961‚Äì1962. Also, in the 1960s, the layout of pews was altered to the current configuration of two banks separated by a central isle. The church was used regularly by the Lansdowne family for weddings and funerals when their private chapel was too small. Regular services taking place at the church include Matins, Holy Communion, and the family service on Sundays. Additionally, the Church sometimes hosts events such as concerts in order to raise funds. In 1994, the Derry Hill vicarage was united with that of Bremhill and Foxham, with one vicar covering both parishes. The parish registers from 1840 (baptisms and burials) and 1842 (marriages), other than those in current use, are held in the Wiltshire and Swindon Record Office. Primary school A school aided by the National Society was built at Rag Lane in 1843, and until 1892 there was a second school at Buck Hill. The Rag Lane school was replaced by a new larger building (with teacher's house) to the west of the church in 1872. The school was taken over by Wiltshire County Council in 1905, and in 1906 the attendance was 152. Children of all ages were educated until 1930, when those over 11 transferred to Calne. Numbers fell, with 61 attending in 1955, then increased following housebuilding; an extension was completed in 1999. Today Derry Hill C of E Primary School has voluntary aided status. In 2011, a teacher at the school was jailed for possessing and making indecent images of children.

The regiment would see action at the Battle of Monmouth and the Battle of Rhode Island. The regiment was disbanded on January 1, 1781, at New Windsor, New York.  Origins  In the years before the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775, the Province of Massachusetts Bay had a volunteer militia corps known as the Governor's Company of Cadets. Based in Boston, the company was disbanded in 1774 after its commander, John Hancock, was dismissed by Governor Thomas Gage. A number of its members left the city when the Siege of Boston began, and reformed themselves as an independent company under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Jackson after the British evacuated the city in March 1776. The company petitioned the Continental Congress to be included in the Continental Army, and on January 12, 1777, Jackson was given a colonel's commission and authorization to raise an \\"Additional Continental regiment\\". Recruitment was conducted primarily in the Boston, but the regiment eventually had members from as far off as Connecticut. The unit's surgeon from 1779 onward was Dr. James Thacher, who kept an extensive journal of his war experience.  Service history  The regiment left Boston in October 1777 to join General George Washington's Main Army outside Philadelphia. In 1778 it was with that army as it followed the British across New Jersey, and served with distinction in the June 28, 1778 Battle of Monmouth. The regiment was then sent to Providence, Rhode Island, where it played a major role in the August 29, 1778 Battle of Rhode Island. It remained in Rhode Island in 1779, but was despatched to Boston as part of a mobilization made in response to the British seizure of Castine, Maine. The regiment was not part of the disastrous Penobscot Expedition that Massachusetts mounted to drive the British out, but it had been boarded onto transports and was en route to the area when the expedition dissolved following the arrival of British reinforcements. It was disembarked at Kittery, where it assisted in bringing in the remnants of the expedition that arrived there overland. Following the British withdrawal from Newport in October 1779, the regiment was sent to New Jersey, where it spent a difficult winter. It was involved in a failed attack on Staten Island in January that was aborted when surprise was lost. The regiment then fought in the June 23, 1780 Battle of Springfield. On July 24, 1780, the regiment was adopted into the Massachusetts Line and renamed the 16th Massachusetts Regiment. It was disbanded as part of a major reorganization of the army on January 1, 1781. Colonel Jackson was given command of the 4th Massachusetts Regiment, and later commanded the 1st American Regiment, the last major Continental Army unit.

It is part of Asian cinema, which in turn is part of world cinema. \\"World cinema\\" is used in the English-speaking world to refer to all foreign language films. The most significant film industries that are categorized as East Asian cinema are the industries of Mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The term is sometimes grouped with Southeast Asian cinema which include the likes of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines due to the popularity and similarities of the cinemas between both regions. The largest market producers in East Asia are Mainland China, Japan and South Korea. East Asia is highlighted in green on this map, which also includes South Asia (orange) and Southeast Asia (blue). Styles and genres The scope of East Asian cinema is huge and covers a wide array of different film styles and genres. However, East Asian cinema shares a common cultural background and is particularly famous in the West for: * Martial arts films (notably the various styles of Hong Kong action cinema such as period Kung Fu, action comedies and Wuxia) * Jidaigeki (Japanese period films, especially Samurai films) * J-Horror (Japanese horror film) * K-Horror (Korean horror film) * Anime (Japanese animation) * Korean drama (Korean style telenovela and soap opera film) * Heroic bloodshed (Hong Kong action films) and other gangster films (usually centred on Chinese Triad crime organisations) * Tokusatsu (Japanese science fiction including Kaiju monster films) History =1890s‚Äì1950s= Unlike the European film industries, the East Asian industries were not dominated by American distributors, and developed in relative isolation from Hollywood cinema; while Hollywood films were screened in East Asian countries, they were less popular than home-grown fare with local audiences. Thus, several distinctive genres and styles developed. =1950s: global influence= East Asian cinema has ‚Äì to widely varying degrees nationally ‚Äì had a global audience since at least the 1950s. At the beginning of the decade, Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon and Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu both captured prizes at the Venice Film Festival and elsewhere, and by the middle of the decade Teinosuke Kinugasa's Gate of Hell and the first part of Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai Trilogy had won Oscars. Kurosawa's Seven Samurai became a global success; Japanese cinema had burst into international consciousness. By the end of the decade, several critics associated with French journal Cahiers du cin√©ma published some of the first Western studies on Japanese film; many of those critics went on to become founding members of the French nouvelle vague, which began simultaneously with the Japanese New Wave. =1960s and 1970s= However, by the late 60s and early 70s, Japanese cinema had begun to become seriously affected by the collapse of the studio system. As Japanese cinema slipped into a period of relative low visibility, the cinema of Hong Kong entered a dramatic renaissance of its own, largely a side effect of the development of the wuxia blending of action, history, and spiritual concerns. Several major figures emerged in Hong Kong at this time ‚Äì perhaps most famously, King Hu, whose 1966 Come Drink With Me was a key influence upon many subsequent Hong Kong cinematic developments. Shortly thereafter, the American-born Bruce Lee became a global icon. Influence and impact As the popularity of East Asian films has endured, it is unsurprising that members of the Western film industry would cite their influences (notably George Lucas, Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese citing Akira Kurosawa; and Jim Jarmusch and Paul Schrader's similar mentions of Yasujir≈ç Ozu), and ‚Äì on occasion ‚Äì work to introduce less well- known filmmakers to Western audiences (such as the growing number of Eastern films released with the endorsement \\"Quentin Tarantino Presents\\"). =Remakes: East and West= Another sign of the increasing influence of East Asian film in the West is the number of East Asian films that have been remade in Hollywood and European cinema, a tradition extending at least as far back as Western remakes of Akira Kurosawa films, such as John Sturges' 1960 The Magnificent Seven (based on Seven Samurai), Sergio Leone's 1964 A Fistful of Dollars (based on Yojimbo) and Martin Ritt's 1964 The Outrage (based on Rashomon), continuing through present-day remakes of J-Horror films like Ring and Ju-on: The Grudge. The influence also goes the other way. A number of East Asian films have also been based upon Western source material as varied as the quickie Hong Kong film remakes of Hollywood hits as well as Kurosawa's adaptations of works by William Shakespeare (The Bad Sleep Well, Throne of Blood, and Ran), Maxim Gorky (The Lower Depths) and Ed McBain (High and Low).

Biography Bulldozer formed in 1980 by bassist Dario Carria and guitarist Andy Panigada.Bulldozer , MusicMight, accessed on 2 May 2013. They were joined by Erminio Galli on drums. They were forced to split up in 1981 due to national service commitments, but reformed in 1983 with Alberto Contini taking over bass and vocal duties and Don Andras playing drums. This line-up recorded the Fallen Angel demo (later to be re-issued as a 7\\"), their debut, The Day of Wrath, and their follow-up, The Final Separation. The Day of Wrath was produced by Algy Ward of Tank fame (yet another bass-driven thunderous power trio band) and the influence can clearly be heard. The Final Separation signaled the abrupt interruption of the deal with Roadrunner Records, which failed to promote the album effectively and moreover selected a different image from the one suggested by the band as its cover art. The photo was deemed cartoonish and ineffective by the band and the whole affair brought to the signing of a new contract with Italian label Metalmagic, a sub-division of Discomagic. Rob Cabrini was brought in on drums for IX (1987). This line-up recorded Neurodeliri (1988) and was captured live in Poland in 1990 for Alive... in Poland. Their final release was the posthumous Dance Got Sick! EP, which, although mainly put together by Contini as a \\"joke\\", enjoyed a huge success in Japan, prompting him to move to that country to work in music production. In 2004, Bulldozer's song \\"Whiskey Time\\" was included in the Peaceville Records compilation Fenriz Presents... The Best of Old-School Black Metal, assembled by Darkthrone's drummer Fenriz. In November 2006, Bulldozer's five albums were collected together by Polish label Metal Mind Productions on the box set Regenerated in the Grave; the box set, hosting bonus tracks and a 32-page booklet, was limited to 2,000 copies. In 2007, Italian power metallers Labyrinth, while touring Japan, hosted Contini onstage for a rendition of Bulldozer's classics. The crowd's ecstatic appreciation of the songs sparked the first thoughts of reunion. As of 2008, according to statements from both Alberto Contini and Andy Panigada, Bulldozer had reunited.Italian thrash giants BULLDOZER reunite, MetalCracker, accessed on 2 May 2013. Contini announced that they would start to work on a new album in August 2008.

Fifteen people were killed, with the last body being recovered early on 5 January. Eight children are known to have died. Thirty- two people were injured. Weather conditions in the area were extremely severe, an avalanche having killed three people nearby earlier in the day. The rescue was temporarily halted on 3 January due to fears that the walls of the ice rink could collapse, endangering firefighters, police and rescue workers. However it resumed in the early hours of the next morning. The accident provoked outrage in the town as it emerged that officials had halted the training session of an ice hockey team inside the rink due to fears that the wall could collapse. Prior to the disaster, officials had planned to close the ice rink on Monday 2 January as snowfall was continuing. However, as many meteorologists pointed out, the weather and snow conditions were not unusual for the time of the year as the town lies in a popular winter sport area of Southern Germany. Local officials examined the collapsed roof on Monday and suggested that the accumulated snow was below the limit for the roof.

The band was formed in 1992 by Matthew North and the core of the band was sealed in 1994 with the arrival of vocalist Andrew Racher. The band were prolific in the mid-1990s British gothic scene and gained a large underground following: their debut single, \\"Jessica\\", sold out of its first pressing in just a few weeks Kerrang! magazine's review comparing Racher's vocals to Dave Vanian of The Damned. \\"Jessica\\" was the only release to have a drummer (John Macklin, from the progressive rock band Legend) and to be produced by Steve Paine (also from Legend). All Living Fear were described by Mick Mercer in his Hex files book as \\"The hardest working band in this section\\" (ref UK Bands) Mick Mercer The Hex Files Page 79 All Living Fear toured extensively in the UK, picking up support slots with major UK goth bands including Nosferatu, Inkubus Sukkubus, James Ray's Gangwar, Spear of Destiny and Flipper. All Living Fear played the first ever Whitby Gothic Weekend and have played it several times since. The band's first album, The Widow's Blame, had a two-page review in Sound on Sound magazine. This album and its follow-up, Minimum Resistance, both sold out of their initial pressings and subsequent pressings were released through Resurrection Records. Racher left in 1998 and was replaced by Paul Roe, under whose influence the band took a more rock- orientated direction. A third album, Into the Light, was released before the band split, with North and Roe going on to form Corrosion. In 2001 Racher and North reformed All Living Fear and released a fourth album, Home Too Soon, which they promoted with support slots for Wayne Hussey, The Damned and All About Eve. In November 2007 the Dangernoise label released 15 Years After, a double CD comprising new recordings of some of the band's tracks, some unreleased songs, new material and remixes. It featured guest performances from Arthur Brown (with whom North had worked extensively), Julianne Regan, Nick Pynn, Christian Riou (Claytown Troupe) and Steve Bronski (Bronski Beat). In August 2009, Racher announced he was leaving the band after almost 15 years' involvement, in order to spend more time with his family. The band continue with North as vocalist and Guitar, Niall Parker on Bass, Steve Williams (Complicity, Christian Death, Altered States) on Guitar and Nevla (Rome Burns) on Guitar. In 2010 Matthew Announced he was forming a new band Secrets For September and in 2012 via Facebook that the band would reform for its 20th Anniversary for some shows in the Autumn including the Whitby Gothic Weekend this ended up being a new version of the band fronted by North and also released a new album 'Coming Home' with a cameo performance from Roger O'Donnell of The Cure on the last track. North joined the Mike Westbrook Uncommon Orchestra in 2014 they released the album 'A Bigger Show' produced by Jon Hiseman in 2016. North Released his debut solo album Stimm THINKING? still DREAMING in 2017 on Dangernoise records. In a post to Facebook on 10 December 2016 the band announced a reunion of the mid 90s duo format of Matthew North and Andrew Racher to play live for the band's 25th anniversary.

It was one of the few units in the Continental Army to serve through the entire war, from the siege of Boston to the disbanding of the Continental Army on November 3, 1783. The unit went through several reorganizations and name changes, like most regiments of the Continental Army. It became known as the \\"Black Regiment\\" because it had a large number black soldiers in its ranks. It is regarded by some as the first black military unit, despite the fact that its ranks were not exclusively black. Regimental history =Varnum's Regiment (1775)= The 1st Rhode Island was initially formed by the Colonial government before being taken into the Continental army. The revolutionary Rhode Island Assembly authorized the regiment on 6 May 1775 as part of the Rhode Island Army of Observation. The regiment was organized on 8 May 1775 under Colonel James Mitchell Varnum, and was therefore often known as \\"Varnum's Regiment.\\" It originally consisted of eight companies of volunteers from Kent and Kings Counties. Varnum marched the regiment to Roxbury, Massachusetts in June 1775, where it took part in the siege of Boston as part of the Army of Observation. It was adopted into the Continental Army by act of Congress on 14 June 1775. It was expanded to ten companies on 28 June, and was assigned to General Nathanael Greene's Brigade in General George Washington's Main Army on 28 July. General Washington officially took command of the Continental Army upon his arrival in Cambridge, Massachusetts on 3 July 1775. The soldiers of Varnum's Regiment had enlisted until the end of 1775, like all others in the Continental Army, and the Regiment was discharged on December 31, along with the remainder of the Army. =9th Continental Regiment (1776)= The Continental Army was completely reorganized at the beginning of 1776, with many regiments receiving new names and others being disbanded. Enlistments were for one year. Varnum's Regiment was reorganized with eight companies on 1 January 1776 and re-designated as the 9th Continental Regiment. Under Colonel Varnum, the regiment remained near Boston until the British evacuated the city in March. It was then ordered to Long Island and took part in the disastrous New York and New Jersey campaign, including the Battle of Long Island and the Battle of Harlem Heights, retreating from New York with the Main Army. The Continental Army was reorganized at the end of the year, as was the case in 1775, but soldiers were now given the option of enlisting for \\"three years or the war\\", unlike the previous practice of enlisting only until the end of the year. =1st Rhode Island Regiment (1777-80)= The Continental Army was reorganized once again in 1777, and the 9th Continental Regiment was re- designated as the 1st Rhode Island Regiment. Colonel Varnum was promoted to brigadier general on February 27, 1777 and was succeeded by Colonel Christopher Greene, a distant cousin of General Nathanael Greene. Under Colonel Greene, the regiment successfully defended Fort Mercer at the Battle of Red Bank on 22 October 1777 against an assault by 2,000 Hessians. 1781 watercolor drawing of American soldiers from the Yorktown campaign, showing a black infantryman from the 1st Rhode Island Regiment on the far left The \\"Black Regiment\\" (1778-81) Blacks had been barred from military service in the Continental Army from November 12, 1775 until February 23, 1778. Rhode Island was having difficulties recruiting enough white men to meet the troop quotas set by the Continental Congress in 1778, so the Rhode Island Assembly decided to pursue a suggestion made by General Varnum to enlist slaves in the 1st Rhode Island Regiment. Varnum had raised the idea in a letter to George Washington, who forwarded it to the governor of Rhode Island without explicitly approving or disapproving of the plan.Lengel, General George Washington, p. 314. On 14 February 1778, the Rhode Island General Assembly voted to allow the enlistment of \\"every able-bodied negro, mulatto, or Indian man slave\\" who chose to do so, and voted that \\"every slave so enlisting shall, upon his passing muster before Colonel Christopher Greene, be immediately discharged from the service of his master or mistress, and be absolutely free.\\"Lanning, African Americans in the Revolutionary War, p. 205. The owners of slaves who enlisted were to be compensated by the Assembly in an amount equal to their market value. A total of 88 slaves enlisted in the regiment over the next four months, as well as some free black men. The regiment eventually totaled about 225 men; probably fewer than 140 of these were black.Lanning, African Americans in the Revolutionary War, pp. 75‚Äì76. The 1st Rhode Island became the only regiment of the Continental Army to have segregated companies of black soldiers; other regiments that allowed black men to enlist were integrated. The enlistment of slaves had been controversial, and no more non-white men were enlisted after June 1778. The unit continued to be known as the \\"Black Regiment\\" even though only white men were recruited to replace losses, a process which eventually made it an integrated unit.Lanning, African Americans in the Revolutionary War, p. 78. Battle of Rhode Island The regiment fought in the Battle of Rhode Island in August 1778 under the command of Major Samuel Ward, Jr., as Colonel Greene had been assigned as a brigade commander for the campaign. It played a fairly minor role, defending a redoubt on West Main Road where it successfully repelled three charges by the Hessians. Repeated attacks from British regulars and Hessian forces failed to break the line of the Patriot forces and allowed the successful retreat of Sullivan's army. Historian Sidney Rider notes that the Hessians charged three times and were repulsed each time. According to Rider, the Hessian Colonel \\"applied to exchange his command and go to New York, because he dared not lead his regiment\\" into battle again, \\"lest his men should shoot him for having caused them so much loss.\\" The First Rhode Island suffered three killed, nine wounded, and eleven missing. After a day of battle, General Sullivan decided that his forces were insufficient and ordered an orderly withdrawal during the night. His soldiers left their camp fires burning to make the Hessians think that they were still in place. The retreat lasted a total of four hours, with six Continental brigades retreating. Sullivan praised the Rhode Island Regiment for its actions, saying that they bore \\"a proper share of the day's honors.\\" General Lafayette proclaimed the battle as ‚Äúthe best fought action of the war.‚Äù The regiment saw little action over the next three years, since the focus of the war shifted to the south. It remained in Rhode Island to defend against a possible attack by the British forces in Newport, and was later sent to Westchester County in New York where the Continental Army was located. =Rhode Island Regiment (1781-1783)= On 1 January 1781, the regiment was consolidated with the 2nd Rhode Island Regiment and was re-designated as the Rhode Island Regiment. The regiment spent the early months of 1781 in an area of the Hudson River Valley called by some historians the \\"Neutral Zone\\". Campaign in the Neutral Zone The \\"Neutral Zone\\" was an area in the Hudson River Valley described as ‚Äúa desolate, sparsely populated buffer zone between the forces of the English to the South and the Americans to the North.‚Äù People who continued to live in the area had to deal with ‚Äútheft, murder, and destruction‚Äù by renegade groups, such as the ‚Äúcowboys‚Äù or the ‚Äúskinners.‚Äù These renegade groups ‚Äúcloaked their plundering under an alleged allegiance to one of the combatants.‚Äù To whichever side the renegade groups leaned, they would forage for goods to sustain ‚Äúboth men and beasts of burden.‚Äù The constant foraging and raiding in the neutral zone, especially by the British supporting ‚Äúcowboys,‚Äù (loyalist militia) caused Major-General Heath to command Colonel Greene and the Black Regiment to defend Pine's Bridge on the Croton River from ‚Äúmarauding Cowboys‚Äù who frequently made incursions from their base in Morrisiania (South Bronx), under the command of loyalist leader Brigadier General James Delancy. Battle of Pines Bridge On the 14th May 1781, Colonel Delancey and his unit of loyalist militia, De Lancey's Refugee Corps, assaulted Pine's Bridge (near present day Yorktown, New York) and caught Colonel Greene and the Rhode Island Regiment by surprise. Delancey's troops killed Colonel Greene, Major Ebenezer Flagg and eight African-American soldiers of the Rhode Island Regiment. The black troops were reported to have ‚Äúdefended their beloved Col. Greene so well that it was only over their dead bodies that the enemy reached and murdered him.‚Äù Colonel Greene and Major Flagg were buried at the First Presbyterian Church in Yorktown. =Last years= Following the death of Colonel Greene, Lieutenant Colonel Jeremiah Olney took command of the regiment. Under Olney's command, the regiment took part in the Siege of Yorktown in October 1781 which proved to be the last major battle of the Revolution. After Yorktown, the regiment moved with the Main Army to Newburgh, New York where its primary purpose was to be ready to react if British forces in the city went on the offensive. On January 22, 1783, the regiment was placed under command of Colonel Marinus Willett of the New York Militia, along with other units, to capture Fort Ontario in the town of Oswego, New York on the shore of Lake Ontario. On February 8, the force of about 500 soldiers, with 120 horse-drawn sleighs, left Fort Herkimer near Utica. Although the expedition was able to get within a mile of Fort Ontario, the attack was called off at the last minute as the moon was not due to set with enough time before daybreak to make a surprise attack. After the expedition, the Rhode Island Regiment returned to Newburgh, where it remained for the remainder of its service. =Rhode Island Battalion (1783)= On March 1, 1783, the regiment was reorganized into six companies and designated as the Rhode Island Battalion (or \\"Olney's Battalion\\"). On June 15, the Rhode Island Regiment veterans were discharged at Saratoga, New York, and the remaining soldiers of the battalion who were enlisted for three years, were organized into a small battalion of two companies. The British evacuated New York on November 25, and the Rhode Island Battalion disbanded on December 25 at Saratoga, New York. It was one of the few units in the Continental Army to have served through the Continental Army's entire existence. Disbandment A black soldier's pay slip for service to the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War The Rhode Island Regiment served its final days in Saratoga, New York under the command of Major William Allen. The regiment was left waiting in Saratoga for months, with low supplies and a terrible snowstorm, until Major William Allen and Adjutant Jeremiah Greenman printed the discharge certificates on December 25, 1783. The discharged troops were \\"dumped back into civilian society,\\" according to one historian, with only the white soldiers being guaranteed 100 acres of bounty land from the federal government, as well as a pension. The Rhode Island General Assembly had already guaranteed the black soldiers their freedom after the war, and the Rhode Island General Assembly passed an act on February 23, 1784 which forbade \\"any person born in Rhode Island after March 1, 1784 from being made a slave.\\" The act also stipulated that children born to slaves were to be supported financially by the Rhode Island town in which they were born. During the same meeting, Colonel Olney presented the colors of Rhode Island's Continental Regiment to the General Assembly, and they have been housed in the State House ever since. Olney had promised his men his \\"interest in their favour,\\" and he continued to advocate for his former troops' right to remain free and to have the government pay them the wages or pensions that they deserved. In June 1784, 13 black veterans of the Rhode Island Regiment hired Samuel Emory to present their claims for back pay to the War Department Accounts Office, in order to help alleviate the financial difficulties that most black veterans faced after the war. In response, the Rhode Island Assembly passed a special act for these soldiers on February 28, 1785 which called for \\"the support of paupers, who heretofore were slaves, and enlisted into the Continental battalions.\\" Therefore, any \\"Indian, negro or mulatto\\" who was sick or unable to support himself must be taken care of by the town council where he lived. Most black veterans remained in Rhode Island, although many moved onto the 100 acres of Bounty Land that they were promised in New York or Ohio. Most veterans who survived into their 50s or 60s were in desperate poverty, including the whites, because of the economic depression that occurred after the Revolution.

Haiku consists of three sections (all in a single vertical line in Japanese): the first and third segments each have five morae (which are not the phonological equivalent of syllables), while the second has seven. Original haiku masters included such figures as Edo period poet Matsuo Bash≈ç (ÊùæÂ∞æËä≠Ëïâ); others influenced by Bash≈ç include Kobayashi Issa and Masaoka Shiki. Classical West Asian literature Modern Asian literature The polymath Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali poet, dramatist, and writer who was an Indian, became in 1913 the first Asian Nobel laureate. He won his Nobel Prize in Literature for notable impact his prose works and poetic thought had on English, French, and other national literatures of Europe and the Americas. He also wrote the Indian anthem. Later, other Asian writers won Nobel Prizes in literature, including Yasunari Kawabata (Japan, 1966), and Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe (Japan, 1994). Yasunari Kawabata wrote novels and short stories distinguished by their elegant and spartan diction such as the novels Snow Country and The Master of Go.

Playing for the Dalai Lama. Funk rock is a fusion genre that mixes elements of funk and rock. James Brown and others declared that Little Richard and his mid-1950s road band, The Upsetters, were the first to put the funk in the rock and roll beat, with a biographer stating that their music \\"spark[ed] the musical transition from fifties rock and roll to sixties funk.\\" Funk rock's earliest incarnation on record was heard in the late 1960s through the mid-1970s by acts such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience (later work / Band of Gypsys), Eric Burdon and War, Redbone, Rick Derringer, David Bowie, Aerosmith, Wild Cherry, Average White Band, Gary Wright, Trapeze, The Bar- Kays,https://www.allmusic.com/.../black-rock-gotta-groove-mw00001192... Black Merda, Parliament-Funkadelic, Betty Davis and Mother's Finest. During the 1980s and 1990s funk rock music experienced a surge in popularity, with bands such as Tom Tom Club, Pigbag, INXS, Talking Heads, Devo, the Fine Young Cannibals and Cameo dabbling in the sound. Groups including Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rage Against the Machine, Incubus, Mr. Bungle, Primus and Faith No More also notably combined funk rock with metal, punk, hip hop and experimental music, leading to the emergence of the genre known as funk metal or \\"punk-funk.\\" Characteristics Funk rock is a fusion of funk and rock. Many instruments may be incorporated into the music, but the overall sound is defined by a definitive bass or drum beat and electric guitars. The bass and drum rhythms are influenced by funk music but with more sonic intensity, while the guitar can be funk- or rock-influenced, usually with distortion, which is similar to overdrive or fuzz. Genre history =1960s and 1970s= Jimi Hendrix was the first well-known recording artist to combine the rhythms and riffs of early funk with his rock sound. Perhaps the earliest example is his \\"Little Miss Lover\\" (1967). The live album Band of Gypsys features funky riffs and rhythms throughout (especially the songs \\"Who Knows\\" and \\"Power of Soul\\") and his unfinished album also included a couple of funk rock songs such as \\"Freedom\\", \\"Izabella\\" and \\"Straight Ahead.\\" George Clinton has been considered the godfather of this genre since 1970. Clinton created the name \\"P-Funk\\" for the innovative new concepts of funk that he culled from former members of James Brown's band (such as Maceo Parker, Bootsy Collins and Fred Wesley) and new young players such as Eddie Hazel. His groups, Funkadelic and Parliament, practically defined funk since the release of the influential funk rock Funkadelic classic Maggot Brain (1971). Later funk rock albums by the group include Cosmic Slop, Standing on the Verge of Getting It On, Hardcore Jollies and Let's Take It to the Stage. Later albums such as One Nation Under a Groove and Electric Spanking of War Babies had a bit more radio-friendly sound but still preserved much of group's funk rock approach. This work served as the primary influence on an entire generation of funk and hip hop artists from the Red Hot Chili Peppers to Snoop Dogg. Other pioneers evolved in the 1970s in the form of British rock band Trapeze and post-punk act A Certain Ratio, and American artists Rick Derringer, Redbone, The Bar-Kays, Shotgun, Black Nasty and Mother's Finest. \\"We called ourselves funk rock,\\" recalled Mother's Finest singer Glenn \\"Doc\\" Murdock. \\"I think we invented that. We even had a house where we all lived and we named it 'Funk Rock, Georgia.' We felt that we were headlining that whole genre. We played with Lynyrd Skynyrd and AC/DC. Those bands had a lot of funk in their music. The real problem for us was when we played in black clubs. They told us we were too loud.\\" Grand Funk Railroad pioneered the bass driven hard rock funk style in 1970 so well portrayed in their song \\"Inside Looking Out\\" and later picked up by Rage Against the Machine. Also singer-model Betty Davis recorded important funk rock albums. The iconoclast composer and guitarist Frank Zappa demonstrated the merge of styles in albums like Overnite Sensation, in themes such as \\"I'm the Slime\\", covered decades later by Funkadelic. Funk rock acts were not favored by R&B; recording companies. For example, guitarists of Chic wanted to be a glam funk rock band like Kiss, but they eventually became a disco act after being turned down by recording companies. Despite its considerable influence on later popular music, funk rock was not a very visible phenomenon during the 1970s. Only a few funk rock acts could be seen on record charts, notably David Bowie (\\"Fame\\" and Young Americans, 1975), Aerosmith (\\"Last Child\\", 1976), The Rolling Stones (\\"Hot Stuff\\", 1975), Gary Wright (\\"Love Is Alive\\", 1976) and Wild Cherry (\\"Play That Funky Music\\", 1976). When Glenn Hughes left Trapeze and joined Deep Purple along with David Coverdale, Deep Purple's next two albums contained elements of funk and soul. When Ritchie Blackmore left Deep Purple in 1975, the band's next album Come Taste the Band with Tommy Bolin was even more funky than its predecessor Stormbringer. However, Deep Purple broke up in 1976 and Tommy Bolin died from a drug overdose. British guitarist Robin Trower's albums In City Dreams and Caravan to Midnight, produced by veteran R&B; producer Don Davis and featuring former Sly & The Family Stone bassist Rustee Allen, are also pioneering funk rock albums. In the late 1970s Iggy Pop released Bowie-produced LP The Idiot. =1980s= From the start of the 1980s, funk musicians Ricky Sander, Ottenheim James, and Cameo as well as new wave band Blondie and post-punk band Talking Heads each created their own brand of funk rock. One famous disco & rock song of the period was \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" (the beat is Chic's big hit \\"Good Times\\") by British rock icons Queen. Also in the 1980s, some synth-funk and synthpop bands such as Thomas Dolby, Scritti Politti, Howard Jones (hit with Things Can Only Get Better) made the basic funk beats along with elements of new wave which makes this a basic synth-funk song. The funk rock genre's representatives from the 1980s to present day include INXS,https://articles.latimes.com > ... > Collections the Fine Young Cannibals, Jane's Addiction, Fishbone, Faith No More, Living Colour and Terence Trent D'Arby. With Prince leading the way, the Minneapolis sound greatly contributed to creating, expanding and defining the funk rock style, with Minnesota-based artists such as The Time, Morris Day, Jesse Johnson, Alexander O'Neal, Andre Cymone, The Family, St.Paul Peterson, Apollonia 6, Vanity 6, Brownmark, Mazarati and producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis all working in the funk rock genre. Red Hot Chili Peppers's second and third albums (which were released 1985 and 1987 respectively, and featured guitarist Hillel Slovak) are seen by many fans as the more funk-oriented albums of their collection. This is often characterized by a driving bass-line which is played over a sparse guitar track occasionally punctuated by metal-like riffs and solos (such as the solo in the middle of \\"Backwoods\\"). Seattle rock band Mother Love Bone is also known to have funk-like grooves in their music. An example of this can be heard in their song \\"Holy Roller.\\" =1990s= Keziah Jones, Seal, and Stevie Salas released funk rock albums. And in the early 1990s, several bands combined funky rhythms with heavy metal guitar sounds, resulting in \\"funk metal,\\" where the emphasis is in using much heavier distorted guitar sounds in the mix. Funk rock employs more of a lighter, \\"crunchier\\" distorted guitar sound, and the musical emphasis tends to be more beat-driven with prominent bass lines; more rhythmic in the R&B; sense. One of the best examples of the fusion can be heard on the critically acclaimed Blood Sugar Sex Magik album, released in 1991 by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Other notable 1990s artists in the funk rock genre, although not widely known in North America, include guitarist Stevie Salas and funk metal bassist TM Stevens. The latter's 1995 album Boom! is an excellent example of bass-heavy songs mixed with rhythmic guitar riffs. Lenny Kravitz is one of the most prominent musicians today in the fusion of rock riffs and funk rhythms, as exampled in tracks such as \\"Tunnel Vision,\\" \\"Always on the Run,\\" and \\"American Woman.\\" Rock band Incubus's early sound was rooted in funk music, heavily influenced by earlier funk/metal fusion artists such as Faith No More and Primus. During the making of his acclaimed studio album Voodoo (2000), neo soul musician D'Angelo was influenced by the funk rock sound of P-Funk, Jimi Hendrix and other such artists, while his hit single \\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\\" has been noted by critics for containing elements of and similarity to the Maggot Brain sound of Funkadelic. Jane's Addiction have included many funk based routines in tracks. Irish band Republic of Loose are also noted for their funk rock sound which has earned them several awards and critical acclaim. Some Britpop bands experimented with funk, mainly in terms of bass lines, including Blur. =2000s‚Äìpresent= The wave of Britpop revival/baggy revival bands in the 2010s, such as Peace, experimented with funk. Peace's second album Happy People features numerous elements of funk. In 2010, a group called I Set The Sea On Fire formed in Sheffield, incorporating elements of funk and other genres into their music. In 2014, experimental rock band Swans released an album with heavy funk rock grooves and elements to critical acclaim titled To Be Kind.

Bin Qasim Town was formed in 2001 as part of The Local Government Ordinance 2001,https://web.archive.org/web/20081013065059/http://www.nrb.gov.pk/city_district/index.html and was subdivided into 7 union councils. The town system was disbanded in 2011, and Bin Qasim Town was re-organized as part of Karachi Malir District in 2015.  Location  Bin Qasim Town was located in the southeastern part of Karachi along the Arabian Sea and the Indus River delta. The town and the adjacent Port Qasim were named after Muhammad bin Qasim, an Arab general who conquered large parts of Sindh in the eighth century CE. Bin Qasim was bordered by Gadap Town to the north, Thatta District and the Indus River to the east, the Arabian Sea to the south and the Malir River and the towns of Landhi, Malir, and Korangi Cantonment to the west. The town had a population of about 315,000 at the 1998 census, of which 97% were Muslim and include several ethnic groups ‚Äì Sindhis form majority in the town. The other ethnic groups inhabiting the town included Balochs, Kashmiris, Seraikis, Pakhtuns, Brahuis, Punjabis, Memons, Bohras and Ismailis.  History  The federal government introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \\"third tier of government\\" (administrative divisions) and replaced it with the fourth tier (districts). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former Karachi Division, and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including Bin Qasim Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation system was reintroduced. In 2015, Bin Qasim Town was re-organized as part of Karachi Malir district.  Neighbourhoods of Bin Qasim Town   Trade and industry  The port of Bin Qasim was built in the 1970s to relieve pressure on the Port of Karachi and is today the second largest port of Pakistan. The port is surrounded by a large industrial area which includes the Pakistan Steel Mills complex in Gulshan-e-Hadeed, Pakistan Machine Tool Factory (PMTF) and the Zulfiqarabad Oil Terminal as well as the nearby industrial estate in Landhi Town.

Located on the roof of One Times Square, the ball is a prominent part of a New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square commonly referred to as the ball drop, where the ball descends down a specially designed flagpole, beginning at 11:59:00 p.m. ET, and resting at midnight to signal the start of the new year. In recent years, the festivities have been preceded by live entertainment, including performances by musicians. The event was first organized by Adolph Ochs, owner of The New York Times newspaper, as a successor to a series of New Year's Eve fireworks displays he held at the building to promote its status as the new headquarters of the Times, while the ball itself was designed by Artkraft Strauss. First held on December 31, 1907, to welcome 1908, the ball drop has been held annually since, except in 1942 and 1943 in observance of wartime blackouts. The ball's design has been updated over the years to reflect improvements in lighting technology; the ball was initially constructed from wood and iron, and lit with 100 incandescent light bulbs. The current incarnation features a computerized LED lighting system and an outer surface consisting of triangular crystal panels. These panels contain inscriptions representing a yearly theme. Since 2009, the current ball has been displayed atop on Times Square year-round, while the original, smaller version of the current ball that was used in 2008 has been on display inside the Times Square visitor's center. The event is organized by the Times Square Alliance and Countdown Entertainment, a company led by Jeff Strauss, and is among the most notable New Year's celebrations internationally: it is attended by at least 1 million spectators yearly, and is nationally televised as part of New Year's Eve specials broadcast by a number of networks and cable channels. The prevalence of the Times Square ball drop has inspired similar \\"drops\\" at other local New Year's Eve events across the country; while some use balls, some instead drop objects that represent local culture or history. Events =Event organization= Spectators celebrate the arrival of 2013. Oswaldo San Andres and Lillianne Perez join Michael Bloomberg in activating the drop for 2007. To facilitate the arrival of attendees, Times Square is closed to traffic beginning in the late afternoon on New Year's Eve. The square is then divided into different viewing sections referred to as \\"pens\\", into which attendees are directed sequentially upon arrival. Security is strictly enforced by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), even more so since the 2001‚Äì02 edition in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Attendees are required to pass through security checkpoints before they are assigned a pen, and are prohibited from bringing backpacks or alcohol to the event. Security was increased further for its 2017‚Äì18 edition due to recent incidents such as the truck attack in New York on October 31, and the 2017 Las Vegas shooting; these included additional patrols of Times Square hotels, rooftop patrol squads and counter-snipers, and the installation of reflective markers on buildings to help officers identify the location of elevated shooters. For 2018‚Äì19, the NYPD announced its intent to use a camera-equipped quadcopter to augment the over 1,200 fixed cameras monitoring Times Square, but it was left grounded due to the rainy weather. =Festivities= Festivities formally begin in the early evening, with the 20 second \\"6 Hours to Go\\" countdown followed by the raising of the ball at 6:00 p.m. ET where a guest turns on a switch to light the ball along with the playing of Fanfare for the Common Man by The New York Philharmonic. Party favors are distributed to attendees, which have historically included large balloons, hats, and other items branded with the event's corporate sponsors. At that time, five hourly countdowns to the top of each hour are held until midnight, along with live music performances by popular musicians. Some of these performances are organized by, and aired on New Year's Eve television specials broadcasting from Times Square. The climax of the festivities is the drop itself, which occurs at 11:59:00 p.m., and is ceremonially \\"activated\\" by a special guest (joined on-stage by the current mayor of New York City) Bill de Blasio; formerly Rudy Giuliani from 1996-97 until 2001-02 and Michael Bloomberg from 2002-03 until 2012-13, selected yearly to recognize their community involvement or significance, by pressing a button on a smaller model of the ball. Since 1996, the button itself does not actually start the drop; that is done from a control room, synchronized using a government time signal.

The individual pieces of confetti are meant to be larger than normal confetti in order to achieve an appropriate density for the environment. Some of the pieces are inscribed with messages of hope for the new year, which are submitted via a \\"Wishing Wall\\" put up in Times Square in December (where visitors can write them directly on individual pieces of confetti), and via online submissions. =Cleanup= Workers clearing trash from Times Square following the festivities. After the conclusion of the festivities and the dispersal of attendees, cleanup is performed overnight to remove confetti and other debris from Times Square. When it is re-opened to the public the following morning, few traces of the previous night's celebration remain: following the 2013‚Äì14 drop, the New York City Department of Sanitation estimated that it had cleared over 50 tons of refuse from Times Square in eight hours, using 190 workers from their own crews and the Times Square Alliance. History = Early celebrations, first ball (1907‚Äì1908) = The first New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square was held on December 31, 1904; The New York Times owner, Adolph Ochs, decided to celebrate the opening of the newspaper's new headquarters, One Times Square, with a New Year's fireworks show on the southern roof of the building to welcome 1905. Close to 200,000 people attended the event, displacing traditional celebrations that had normally been held at Trinity Church. However, following several years of fireworks shows, Ochs wanted a bigger spectacle at the building to draw more attention to the area. The newspaper's chief electrician, Walter F. Palmer, suggested using a time ball, after seeing one used on the nearby Western Union Building. Ochs hired sign designer Artkraft Strauss to construct a ball for the celebration; it was built from iron and wood, electrically lit with one hundred incandescent light bulbs, weighed , and measured in diameter. The ball was hoisted on the building's 70 foot flagpole with rope by a team of six men. The ball would begin to drop at 10 seconds before midnight, once it hit the roof of the building, the ball was designed to complete an electric circuit to light a 5-foot-tall sign to light up on all four sides of the building, indicating the new year, and trigger a fireworks show. The first ever \\"ball drop\\" was held on December 31, 1907, welcoming the year 1908. In 1913, only eight years after it moved to One Times Square, the Times moved its corporate headquarters to 229 West 43rd Street. The Times still maintained ownership of the tower, however, and Strauss continued to organize future editions of the drop. For the 1917-18 event, cold air from Canada blew towards America, eventually hitting New York. This resulted in the 1918 party becoming the coldest New Year's Eve ever at 1 degree. The coal shortage also caused the square to go dark. However, the ball still dropped, and lighted. = The second and third balls (1920‚Äì1998) = The original ball was last used for the 1919-20 event in favor of a second design; the second ball remained in diameter, but was now constructed from iron, weighing . The ball drop was placed on hiatus for New Year's Eve 1942-43 and 1943-44 due to wartime lighting restrictions during World War II. Instead, a moment of silence was observed one minute before midnight in Times Square, followed by the sound of church bells ringing being played from sound trucks. At the 1949-50 event, at 10 minutes before midnight, a fuse blew, which caused the front of the ball to go out. Workers turned off the ball, lowered it, turned it around, sent it back up, and the event continued as usual. The ball was pushed back up during the 1953-54 because of strong winds, and at the 1954-55 event, a kid got tied up in the ropes, causing the ball to stop its descent midway down the pole. Despite these two mishaps, the new year still arrived. The second ball was last used for the 1954-55 event in favor of a third design; which was now 6 feet in diameter, constructed from aluminum, and weighed . During the 1955-56 event, there was another fuse blow. This time it caused the ball to go out a few seconds before midnight, and the \\"1956\\" sign did not light up until 12:15 AM. For the 1981-82 event, the ball was modified to make it resemble an apple with red bulbs and a green \\"stem\\", alluding to New York's nickname, \\"the Big Apple\\". For the 1987-88 event, organizers acknowledged the addition of a leap second earlier that day (leap seconds are appended at midnight UTC, which is five hours before midnight in New York) by extending the drop to 61 seconds, and by including a special one-second light show during the extra second. The original white bulbs returned to the ball for the 1988-89 event, but were replaced by red, white, and blue bulbs for the 1990-91 event to salute the troops of Operation Desert Shield. The third ball was revamped again in 1995 for 1996, adding a computerized lighting system with 180 halogen bulbs and 144 strobe lights, and over 12,000 rhinestones. Lighting designer Barry Arnold stated that the changes were \\"something [that] had to be done to make this event more spectacular as we approach the millennium.\\" The drop itself became computerized through the use of an electric winch synced with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's time signal; the first drop with the new system was not without issues, however, as a glitch caused the ball to pause for a short moment halfway through its descent. After its 44th use in 1999, the third ball was retired and placed on display at the Atlanta headquarters of Jamestown Group, owners of One Times Square. = Into the new millennium (1999‚Äì2007) = On December 28, 1998, during a press conference attended by New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, organizers announced that the third ball would be retired for the arrival of the new millennium, and replaced by a new design constructed by Waterford Crystal. The year 2000 celebrations introduced more prominent sponsorship to the drop; companies such as Discover Card, Korbel Champagne, and Panasonic were announced as official sponsors of the festivities in Times Square. The city also announced that Ron Silver would lead a committee known as \\"NYC 2000\\", which was in charge of organizing events across the city for year 2000 celebrations. A full day of festivities was held at Times Square to celebrate the arrival of the year 2000, which included concerts and hourly cultural presentations with parades of puppets designed by Michael Curry, representing countries entering the new year at that hour. Organizers expected a total attendance exceeding two million spectators. The fourth ball, measuring in diameter and weighing , incorporated a total of over 600 halogen bulbs, 504 triangle-shaped crystal panels provided by Waterford, 96 strobe lights, and spinning, pyramid-shaped mirrors. The ball was constructed at Waterford's factory in Ireland, and was then shipped to New York City, where the lighting system and motorized mirrors were installed. Many of the triangles were inscribed with \\"Hope\\"-themed designs changing yearly, those themes were ‚ÄúStar of Hope‚Äù, ‚ÄúHope for Abundance‚Äù, ‚ÄúHope for Healing‚Äù, ‚ÄúHope for Courage‚Äù, ‚ÄúHope for Unity‚Äù, ‚ÄúHope for Wisdom‚Äù, ‚ÄúHope for Fellowship‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHope for Peace‚Äù. The \\"Hope for Healing\\" theme was used in 2002 in remembrance of the September 11 terrorist attacks three months earlier: 195 of the ball's panels were engraved with the names of countries and emergency organizations that had taken casualties during the attacks, and the names of the World Trade Center, The Pentagon, and the four flights that were involved in the attacks. In December 2011, the \\"Hope for Healing\\" panels were accepted into the permanent collection of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. = Present day (2008‚Äìpresent) = In honor of the ball drop's centennial anniversary, a brand new fifth design debuted for New Year's Eve 2008. Once again manufactured by Waterford Crystal with a diameter of , but weighing , it used LED lamps provided by Philips (which can produce 16,777,216 or 224 colors), with computerized lighting patterns developed by the New York City- based lighting firm Focus Lighting. The ball featured 9,576 energy-efficient bulbs that consumed the same amount of electricity as only 10 toasters. The 2008 ball was only used once, and was placed on display at the Times Square Visitors Center following the event. For 2009, a larger version of the fifth ball was introduced‚Äîan icosahedral geodesic sphere lit by 32,256 LED lamps. Its diameter is twice as wide as the 2008 ball, at , and contains 2,688 Waterford Crystal panels, with a weight of . It was designed to be weatherproof, as the ball would now be displayed atop One Times Square nearly year-round following the celebrations. Yearly themes for the ball's crystal panels continued; from 2008 to 2013, the ball contained crystal patterns that were part of a Waterford series known as \\"World of Celebration\\", which included \\"Let There Be Light\\", ‚ÄúLet There Be Joy‚Äù, ‚ÄúLet There Be Courage‚Äù, ‚ÄúLet There Be Love‚Äù, ‚ÄúLet There Be Friendship‚Äù, and \\"Let There Be Peace\\". For 2014, all the ball's panels were replaced, marking a new theme series known as \\"Greatest Gifts\\", beginning with \\"Gift of Imagination\\". The numerical sign indicating the year (which remains atop the tower along with the ball itself) uses Philips LED lamps. The \\"14\\" digits for 2014 used Philips Hue multi-color LED lamps, allowing them to have computerized lighting cues. On September 23, 2020, it was announced that the 2020-21 ball drop would be held without the crowd due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, making this the first time that Times Square NYE would be held in a different form since 1942-43. While details were not yet revealed (beyond that only a \\"limited number of honored guests\\" will be in attendance), Times Square Alliance president Tim Tompkins stated that organizers were preparing \\"significantly new and enhanced virtual, visual and digital offerings to complement whatever limited live entertainment or experiences‚Äîstill in development‚Äîwill take place in Times Square.\\" =Weather at midnight= According to National Weather Service records, since 1907‚Äì08, the average temperature in nearby Central Park during the ball drop has been . The warmest ball drops occurred in 1965‚Äì66 and 1972‚Äì73 when the temperature was . The coldest ball drop occurred in 1917‚Äì18, when the temperature was and the wind chill was . Affected by a continent-wide cold wave, the 2017‚Äì18 drop was the second-coldest on record, at and after wind chill. The third coldest ball drop occurred during the 1962-63 event, when the temperature was 11 ¬∞F (-11 ¬∞C) and the wind chill was -17 ¬∞F (-27 ¬∞C) Snow has fallen seven times, with the earliest being the 1926-27 event, and the most recent being the 2009‚Äì10 event, and rain/drizzle has fallen sixteen times, with the earliest being the 1918-19 event, and the most recent being the 2018‚Äì19 event. The snowiest ball drop occurred during the 1948-49 event, when 4 inches of snow fell, and the rainiest occurred during the 2018-19 event, when 1.02 inches of rain fell. Broadcasting ABC News' presence at Times Square for ABC 2000 Today As a public event, the festivities and ball drop are often broadcast on television. A host pool feed is provided to broadcasters for use in coverage, which for 2016‚Äì17 consisted of 21 cameras. Since 2008-09, an official webcast of the ball drop and its associated festivities has been produced, streamed via Livestream.com. The event is covered as part of New Year's Eve television specials on several major U.S. television networks, which usually intersperse on-location coverage from Times Square with entertainment segments, such as musical performances (some of which held live in Times Square as part of the event). By far the most notable of these is Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve; created, produced, and originally hosted by the entertainer Dick Clark until his death in 2012 (with Regis Philbin filling in for its 2004-05 broadcast), and currently hosted by Ryan Seacrest, the program first aired on NBC in 1972 before moving to ABC, where it has been broadcast ever since. New Year's Rockin' Eve has consistently been the most-watched New Year's Eve special in the U.S. annually, peaking at 25.6 million viewers for its 2017‚Äì18 edition. Following the death of Dick Clark in April 2012, a crystal engraved with his name was added to the 2013 ball in tribute. Across the remaining networks, NBC broadcasts NBC's New Year's Eve (formerly New Year's Eve with Carson Daly), which features The Voice host Carson Daly, while Fox has presently aired a New Year's special hosted by comedian and media personality Steve Harvey since 2017‚Äì18. Spanish-language network Univision broadcasts ¬°Feliz!, hosted by Ra√∫l de Molina of El Gordo y La Flaca. On cable, CNN carries coverage of the festivities, known as New Year's Eve Live, currently hosted by Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen (the latter first replacing Kathy Griffin for 2018). Fox News carries All-American New Year, which was most recently hosted by Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Bill Hemmer from Times Square. = Past broadcasts = Beginning in the 1940s, NBC broadcast coverage from Times Square anchored by Ben Grauer on both radio and television. Its coverage was later incorporated into special episodes of The Tonight Show, continuing through Johnny Carson and Jay Leno's tenures on the program. NBC would later introduce a dedicated special, New Year's Eve with Carson Daly, hosted by former MTV personality Carson Daly. From 1956 to 1976, CBS was well known for its television coverage of the festivities hosted by bandleader Guy Lombardo, most frequently from the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, featuring his band's signature rendition of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" at midnight (which in contemporary times has traditionally been played at midnight in Times Square). After Lombardo's death in 1977, CBS and the Royal Canadians, now led by Victor Lombardo, attempted to continue the special. However, Guy's absence and the growing popularity of ABC's New Year‚Äôs Rockin‚Äô Eve prompted CBS to eventually drop the band entirely. In 1979 the Royal Canadians were replaced by a new special, Happy New Year, America, which ran in various formats with different hosts (such as Paul Anka, Donny Osmond, Andy Williams, Paul Shaffer, and Montel Williams) until it was discontinued after 1996. CBS, except for coverage during a special episode of Late Show with David Letterman for 1999, and a special America's Millennium broadcast for 2000, has not broadcast any national New Year's programming since. For 2000, in lieu of New Year's Rockin' Eve, ABC News covered the festivities as part of its day-long telecast, ABC 2000 Today. Hosted by then-chief correspondent Peter Jennings, the broadcast featured coverage of New Year's festivities from around the world as part of an international consortium. Jennings was joined by Dick Clark as a special correspondent for coverage from Times Square. MTV had broadcast coverage originating from the network's Times Square studios at One Astor Plaza. For 2011, MTV also held its own ball drop in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, the setting of its popular reality series Jersey Shore, featuring cast member Snooki lowered inside a giant \\"hamster ball\\". Originally, MTV planned to hold the drop within its studio in Times Square, but the network was asked by city officials to conduct the drop elsewhere. For 2019, prominent video game streamer Ninja hosted a 12-hour New Year's Eve broadcast on Twitch from Times Square, streaming matches of Fortnite Battle Royale with himself and special guests from a studio in the Paramount Building. Ninja made an on-stage appearance in Times Square during the festivities outside, where he attempted to lead the crowd in the floss, (a dance routine made popular by Fortnite) but failed to do so as there was little movement.

The center is responsible for the appropriate use of history and military records throughout the United States Army. Traditionally, this mission has meant recording the official history of the army in both peace and war, while advising the army staff on historical matters. CMH is the flagship organization leading the Army Historical Program. CMH is also behind the National Museum of the U.S. Army (NMUSA), which is under construction at Fort Belvoir and projected to open in 2020. Mission The center traces its lineage back to historians under the Secretary of War who compiled the Official Records of the Rebellion, an extensive history of the American Civil War begun in 1874. A similar work on World War I was prepared by the Historical Section of the Army War College. The modern organization of the army's historical efforts dates from the creation of the General Staff historical branch in July 1943 and the subsequent gathering of a team of historians, translators, editors, and cartographers to record the official history of World War II. They began publication of the United States Army in World War II series, which numbers 78 volumes, in 1946. Since then, the center has produced detailed series on the Army's role in the Korean and Vietnam Wars and has begun a series on the U.S. Army in the Cold War. These works are supplemented by monographs and other publications on a mix of topics. Since its formation, the center has provided historical support to the Army Secretariat and Staff, contributing background information for decision making, staff actions, command information programs, and public statements by army officials. It has expanded its role in the areas of military history education, the management of the army's museum system, and the introduction of automated data-retrieval systems. The center's work with army schools ensures that the study of history is a part of the training of officers and noncommissioned officers. Much of this educational work is performed at field historical offices and in army museums. Historical activities Under the direction of the chief of military history and his principal adviser, the army's chief historian, CMH's staff is involved in some 50 major writing projects. Many of these efforts involve new research that ranges from traditional studies in operational and administrative history to the examination of such areas as procurement, peacekeeping, and the global war on terror. Those works under way and projected are described in the Army Historical Program, an annual report to the Chief of Staff on the Army's historical activities. All center publications are listed in the catalog Publications of the United States Army Center of Military History, which explains how to access them. In addition, army historians maintain the organizational history of army units, allowing the center to provide units of the Regular Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve with certificates of their lineage and honors and other historical material concerning their organizations. The center also determines the official designations for army units and works with the army staff during force reorganizations to preserve units with significant histories, as well as unit properties and related historical artifacts. CMH also serves as a clearinghouse for the oral history programs in the army at all levels of command. It also conducts and preserves its own oral history collections, including those from the Vietnam War, Desert Storm, and the many recent contingency operations. In addition, the center's end-of-tour interviews within the Army Secretariat and Staff provide a basis for its annual histories of the Department of the Army. As tangible representations of the service's mission, military artifacts and art enhance the soldier's understanding of the profession of arms. CMH manages a system of more than 120 army museums and their holdings, encompassing some 450,000 artifacts and 15,000 works of military art.Directory of Active Army and National Guard Museums The center also provides professional museum training, staff assistance visits, teams of combat artists such as those deployed under the Vietnam Combat Artists Program, and general museum support throughout the army. Current projects include the establishment of a National Museum of the United States Army at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and a complementary Army Heritage and Educational Center at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. Paintings by Adolf Hitler stored at the center. The paintings were cited in Price v. United States. The Chief of Military History is responsible for ensuring the appropriate use of military history in the teaching of strategy, tactics, logistics, and administration. This mission includes a requirement that military leaders at all levels be aware of the value of history in advancing military professionalism. To that end, the center holds a biennial history conference and workshop; publishes Army History, a professional bulletin devoted to informing the larger military history education community; and supplies readings for the army school system, including the ROTC community, and texts and other support for the army's staff ride program. In this effort, the chief of military history is assisted by a historical advisory committee that includes leading academic historians and representatives of the army school system. Staff rides enable military leaders to retrace the course of a battle on the ground, deepening their understanding of the recurring fundamentals of military operations. As one of the army's major teaching devices, staff rides are particularly dependent on a careful knowledge of military history. Center historians lead rides directed by the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff and attended by senior members of the army Staff. It administers the army's Command History Program, to provide historical support to army organizations worldwide. In addition, since the first Persian Gulf War, the center has coordinated the deployment of military history detachments and the collection of historical data during peacekeeping and wartime operations, including those in northern Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Fellowships and publications To stimulate interest in military history in the army and the nation, CMH sponsors professional programs. * Fellowships: To encourage and support dissertations in military history by graduate students, the center offers up to four dissertation fellowships each academic year. These fellowships carry a $9,000 stipend and access to the center's facilities and expertise. Although the fellowship program broadly defines the history of war on land, it selects winners with a preference for topics on the history of the U.S. Army. * Publications: The center has over 600 titles in its catalog. It is responsible for writing the official history of the U.S. Army. It is able to facilitate research, provide graphics and editorial support, and carry manuscripts through to publication. *The center also publishes a quarterly history journal, Army History, known from 1983-1988 (No. 1 - No. 12) as The Army Historian. This award-winning magazine currently has a print run of over 10,000 copies and has been in circulation since 1983. Historical services to the public CMH's art and documents collections, library, and reference services are available to private researchers. Official priorities permitting, its historians, curators, and archivists advise researchers on military history and stand ready to share their expertise concerning the location of sources. The Collections Branch of the Museum Division arranges temporary loans of paintings and drawings from the Army Art Collection to private organizations that agree to display the art publicly in accordance with Army regulations. The army's museums and historical holdings throughout the country and abroad are generally open to the public, and their curators are available to answer reference questions. As a secured facility, requests for an appointment at Fort Lesley J. McNair must be made at least a week in advance.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s Manak was generally regarded as the best Punjabi singer in the world. His high pitched strong voice was unique, and instantly recognisable. A statue of Manak has been erected in Ludhiana near his residence as a tribute.  Early life  Manak was born as Latif Mohammed on 15 November 1951 to Nikka Khan, in the village of Jalal in Bathinda district of Indian Punjab. Sardar Partap Singh Kairon (then Chief Minister of Punjab) penned the name Kuldip Manak, after being amazed by the quality of his voice at a school prize giving. He completed his education from Jalal Government High School, where he was a keen hockey player. He had an inclination towards singing from an extremely young age. He was constantly persuaded by his ustad to graft in his raags and perform on stage. In his early career he became the baadshah of kaliyan. He had lyrics written by famous writers such as Debi Maksoospuri, Dev Threekewala and Jandu Litranwala. His most known tracks were gadeya millade sohne yaar, tere tille ton and dulleya ve tokra. Manak learnt the hazuri raagi methods of gaiki. Family Manak's father, Nikka Khan, was a singer himself. Manak had two brothers: Siddqui, a devotional singer, and Rafiq, who was also briefly noted. Kuldeep Manak's ancestors were the Hazoori Raagis (designated cantors) of Kirtan for Maharaja Hira Singh of Nabha. He was married to Sarabjeet Kaur with whom he had two children, a boy named Yudhvir Manak and a girl named Shakti Manak. Yudhvir is following in his father's footsteps as a singer. Career Manak learned music under Ustad Khushi Muhammad Qawwal in village Bhuttiwala at Muktsar. He left Bathinda and went to Ludhiana to pursue his career as a singer and started singing with the duo Harcharan Grewal and Seema. When they came to Delhi, a music company official spotted Manak and asked him to record the song \\"jija akhian na maar ve main kall di kurhi\\" (written by Babu Singh Maan Mararawala) with Seema. In 1968, at the age of 17, he was given the chance to record the song with Seema. His first record features this song along with \\"laung karaa mittra, machhli paunge maape\\" (written by Gurdev Singh Maan). This record was a runaway success. He did sing duets with Satinder Kaur biba, younger sister of famous Punjabi singer Narinder biba; one of the duets was \\"Nale baba lasee pee gia nale de gia duanee khotee\\". Later, he started an office at Bathinda along with writer Dilip Singh Sidhu of Kanakwal, but did not stay there for long and returned to Ludhiana. The first folk song sung by Manak was \\"maa Mirze di boldi\\", followed by \\"ohne maut nu waajan maarian\\". The writer and lyricist, Hardev Dilgir (also known as Dev Threekewala) spotted Manak at one of his live performances and penned many Lok Gathavan (English: old folk stories) for him. Dev Threekewala and Manak were very close to each other. His first EP, Punjab Dian Lok Gathawan, was released by HMV in 1973 which included the songs \\"Jaimal Phatta\\", \\"Heer Di Kali\\" (Teri Khatar Heere) (kali), \\"Raja Rasalu\\" and \\"Dulla Bhatti\\" (Dulleya ve tokra chukayeen aanke). All were written by Hardev Dilgir and the music was composed by Ram Saran Das. This was followed by another Lok Gathawan album in 1974 which included \\"Gorakh da Tilla\\" and \\"Allah Bismillah teri Jugni\\". In 1976 his first LP, Ik Tara, was released, which included the kali \\"Tere Tille Ton\\", \\"Chheti Kar Sarwan Bachcha\\" and \\"Garh Mughlane Dian Naaran\\" and more. Other albums included: * Mitran di jacket de (1973) * Heer di doli (1977) * Sahiban Bani Bharaawan Di (1978) * Sahiban Da Tarla (1979) * Maa Hundhi Ae Maa (1980) * Akhan ch Najaiz Vikdi (1980) * Ichhran Dhaahan Maardi (1981) * Mehroo Posti (1982) * Sarwan Bhagat (1983) * Jugni Yaaran Di (1983) * Mundri vagah ke maari (1984) * Bhul Jaan Waaliye (1984) * Nachna pia (1985) * Ja ni tera kakh na rahe * Ranjha heer di bukal * Heer maardi leraan * Dilla De Sodya * Baba lassi peegeya * Kadna rumaalde geya ve * Sanu nachke vikha * Singh Soorme (1978) including Banda Singh Bahadur * Ghare chal kadun rarkan * Dil milyan de mele * Karo na yaar maar mitro * Dil nahion lagda * Gidhe wich too nachdi * Yaar ve teri yaari * Loko vaddeya gandasseyan de naal * Laila Laila mukh ton Majnu * Hakaan maardi * The One * Bhull ke jhuthe yaaran nu * Ranjha jogi hoya * Do Gabhru Punjab De Manak's voice was versatile as within one album he sang in many different pitches and tones to reflect a song's meaning. For example, on the album Sahiban da Tarla the songs \\"Sahiban da Tarla\\", \\"Yaari Yaaran di\\" and \\"Teri aan ma Teri Ranjha\\" are all sung with different pitches.  Film  He also acted and sung in many Punjabi films such as Saidan Jogan (1979) with the song \\"sathon naee majhin chaar hundian\\", and Lambardaarni (1980) with \\"yaaran da truck balliye\\". In Balbiro Bhabi (1981) he was actor, singer and composer. He sang \\"ajj dhee ik raje di\\", in the 1983 film Sassi Punnu.  Politics  Manak took part in the parliament elections of 1996 as an independent member from Bathinda, but did not win.  In popular culture  On 25 December 2012, a tribute single was released by Aman Hayer under Moviebox Records with the title \\"The Folk King\\" (subtitled \\"Ustaad Kuldeep Manak Ji Tribute\\"), featuring a number of artists interpreting his songs. The track was first played and performed at the Britasia Music Awards 2012 by Angrej Ali who started the song with \\"Vaar Banda Bahadur\\", with which Ustaad Kuldeep Manak Ji used to start his shows with. The final song sung in this tribute was \\"Tere Tille Ton\\" by Jazzy B, a close student of Ustaad Kuldeep Manak Ji. Manak's songs were featured in the movie Punjab 1984 starring Diljit Dosanjh and Pavan Malhotra as a tribute to him. The main character, Shivjeet, is an avid fan of Manak and his songs are played at suspenseful moments of the film.

Cegielski has produced 52 machines in years 1974-1977 and 2 modified in 1985. History The 302D (class SP47) and 303D type (class SU46) locomotives are heavily improved version of 301Db type (class SP/SU45) diesel locomotive. Both of them has similar shape, but SP47 is a bit longer because of its 2116SSF diesel engine. SU46 uses similar diesel engine as SP/SU45, but traction motors are totally different (this was enforced by usage of 3 kV electrical heating). Construction of SU46 was stopped in 1977, most likely due to communist government decisions. In 1985 additional two units of this class were built (numbers 053 and 054). They are slightly modified version of previous locomotives. Operation Order of this locomotive was connected with increasing in 1970s demand on freight and passenger services on non- electrified railway lines. SU46 has a very universal characteristic - it was possible to use them in passenger service and freight. Today they are used in service on west Polish border (passenger and goods) and in Warmia and Masuria (goods train). Previous they were used also in passenger service on Hel Peninsula.

It was owned and operated by mechanic Bud Moore and ran out of Spartanburg, South Carolina. While the team was a dominant force in the 1960s and 1980s, the final years were tumultuous due to lack of sponsorship and uncompetitive race cars. History =1960s= Bud Moore Engineering debuted in 1961, at a qualifying race for the Daytona 500. The team won its debut with Joe Weatherly driving the No. 8 Pontiac. Weatherly drove for the team for most of the season, and won eight races. Bud Moore Engineering became one of the first multi-car teams in NASCAR history, fielding the No. 18 for five races. Bob Welborn, Fireball Roberts, Cotton Owens, and Tommy Irwin drove that car. In 1962, Weatherly returned and had a phenomenal year, winning five races and that year's Grand National championship. David Pearson drove the second car(No. 08) at Atlanta Motor Speedway, finishing 11th. 1963 saw Weatherly and Moore repeating as champions, despite winning only three races and running just over half of the schedule. Welborn returned to the second car(No. 06) at Charlotte Motor Speedway, finishing 29th, Weatherly was considering retirement going into 1964, and he drove only a couple of races for Moore, until tragedy struck. While racing Moore's No. 8 Mercury at Riverside International Raceway, Weatherly began setting up for Turn 6 when he lost control and struck the concrete barrier, then slid across the racetrack where his car came to a stop. Weatherly was dead when workers got to his car. He died when his car hit the barrier, as his head slid out the window and hit the wall, suffering major head injuries. Moore retired No. 8 and switched to No. 1, and hired Billy Wade, the 1963 NASCAR Rookie of the Year, to drive. Wade had a strong year, winning four consecutive races and finishing fourth in points. Bobby Johns, Johnny Rutherford, and Darel Dieringer also saw time in the car, with Dieringer winning at Augusta Speedway. Wade himself died in a tire test at Daytona International Speedway. Moore retired No. 1 and fielded the Nos. 15 and 16 for Earl Balmer and Dieringer, respectively. Dieringer had another win and a third-place points finish, while Balmer had three top-fives. After that season, Moore cut down to Dieringer's car and ran a limited schedule, with Dieringer nailing down two more victories. At the end of the season, Dieringer moved on and Moore had a rotation of drivers in his No. 16, Bobby Allison, Gordon Johncock, Sam McQuagg, Cale Yarborough, and LeeRoy Yarbrough all drove, most of whom finished in the top-ten one. In 1968, Cale returned for one race, and Tiny Lund drove for thirteen races, finishing in the top ten seven times. BME only ran one race in 1969, with Don Schissler finishing 36th at the inaugural Talladega 500. =1970s= Bud Moore Engineering took a three-year hiatus until 1972, when David Pearson piloted the No. 15 Ford to a 26th-place finish at Riverside. LeeRoy Yarbrough, Dick Brooks, and Donnie Allison also drove that year. In 1973, Bobby Isaac climbed on board with Sta-Power Industries sponsoring. Isaac had six top-ten finishes until the Talladega 500, when he radioed in to Moore and told him he was quitting. When he got out of the car, Isaac announced he was retiring. Some reports surfaced saying Isaac quit because voices in his head had told him to. His replacement was an unpolished rookie named Darrell Waltrip, who had a top-ten at Darlington Raceway. In 1974, George Follmer drove the car with R.C. Cola as sponsor, but was released after Riverside, and Buddy Baker drove for the rest of the year, and won two poles. Baker stayed on for 1975, and won four races and finished 15th in the championship standings. Baker won one race in 1976 and finished seventh in the points, but did not visit victory lane in 1977. He left at the end of the year. Baker's replacement was Bobby Allison. Allison won five races each over the next two seasons, including the 1978 Daytona 500, and finished second and third in the points, respectively. By the end of the 1970s, Bud Moore Engineering had returned to prominence. =1980s= Rudd in Moore's No. 15, from 1984 After Allison won four races in 1980 and finished sixth in points, he left for other opportunities. He was replaced by Benny Parsons, who won three races and finished tenth in points. He too, decided to move on after that season. Moore hit paydirt in 1982 by hiring a hotshot young superstar named Dale Earnhardt and signed Wrangler Jeans as primary sponsor. Earnhardt had one win in his first year, and finished 12th in points. After only improving slightly the next year, Earnhardt departed for Richard Childress Racing, and was replaced by Ricky Rudd (who was driving the No. 3 Childress car that Earnhardt was going to be driving, both with the same Wrangler sponsorship). After a demoralizing start that resulted in Rudd flipping over several times in a crash in the Bud Shootout, Rudd won at Richmond and finished seventh in points. Armed with new sponsor Motorcraft, Rudd won five more races from 1985-1987, and had a best points finish of fifth. After 1987, Rudd departed for King Racing, rookie Brett Bodine replaced him. Compared to the teams' previous success, Bodine's performance was disappointing, and he left to replace Rudd at King. =1990s= In 1990, Moore chose Morgan Shepherd to be his new driver. Shepherd had a strong year, winning the Atlanta Journal 500 and finishing a career-best fifth in points. When Shepherd dropped seven points in the standings in 1991, he left for Wood Brothers Racing, and Moore selected Geoff Bodine, older brother of Moore's former driver Brett, to be his new pilot. Despite two wins and eleven top-ten finishes, Bodine finished just 16th in points. Bodine won Moore's last race in 1993 at Sears Point, which was one of Bodine's last races for the team as he purchased the late Alan Kulwicki's AK Racing team five days prior to this victory and was going to become an owner-driver, and took over that car at Dover in September of that year. Lake Speed, who had been announced as the new driver for 1994 on September 3, 1993, took over for Bodine at that Dover race, and his best finish was an 11th at the Mello Yello 500. Speed returned in 1994, this time with Ford as the sponsor. He had four top five finishes and an eleventh-place finish in points. At the end of the year, Speed departed for Melling Racing, and popular veteran Dick Trickle took over. After a dismal season that yielded just one top-ten, Trickle left the team. Wally Dallenbach Jr. signed on with Hayes Communications in 1996, but only had three top-ten finishes. He and Hayes left the team at the end of the year. =Final years= After the disappointment of 1996, Bud Moore Engineering did not make a race in 1997, when an attempt to make the Daytona 500 with Larry Pearson failed. In 1998, Moore began developing three-time ARCA champion Tim Steele for a run at Winston Cup with sponsorship from Nike and Sony. Steele had been recovering from injuries sustained in a crash at Atlanta, and with the help of his father and sponsor Rescue Engine Formula, Steele would seek Rookie of the Year honors in 1999. Soon though, the deal fell apart. Loy Allen Jr. attempted the Brickyard 400, but failed to qualify. The team did start two races with Ted Musgrave, both races resulting in DNF's. After a failed attempt with Jeff Green to qualify for the 1999 Daytona 500, Moore was approached by a California family, Robert, Sue, and Randy Fenley, who were operating a successful NASCAR West Coast team and wanted to expand into Cup. Moore sold the operation to them but remained on board as a consultant. They attempted their first race at that year's Brickyard 400 as the No. 62 with Big Daddy's BBQ Sauce as sponsor. Jeff Davis and Lance Hooper shared the driving duties, but they did not qualify for the race. Nevertheless, the team began preparing for 2000. Late in the year, the team announced they would hire Derrike Cope would drive the No. 15 until the end of 2001. Although no sponsor was named, the team assured Cope that there was enough financial stability for him to run for the entirety of his contract. Cope qualified at Lowe's Motor Speedway for the team in 1999, finishing 35th. Things looked promising for 2000, as Cope had a strong Speedweeks. However, the team soon started to skip races because of financial difficulties. Things went from bad to worse as Moore left the team. Soon afterwards, Cope quit the team in disgust because he felt that he was lied to when he was told the organization was financially secure. Musgrave drove at Talladega and finished 35th. After that, the team moved to North Carolina and hoped to run the ARCA series until they could afford to compete in NASCAR again. That never came to be and the team soon shut down and sold its equipment. Moore's old shop in Spartanburg was purchased by Converse College as a storage facility.

Competition from the McClatchy-owned Anchorage Daily News forced it out of business in 1992. History The Anchorage Times was founded by Ted Needham and L. Frank Shaw as the Pioneer-News. The first issue, an advertisement-heavy \\"extra\\" edition, was published on May 27, 1915, and distributed without charge. The headline story was \\"Status of the New Townsite.\\" It was the first newspaper published in the town, which was not yet formally known as \\"Anchorage.\\" Regular weekly publication, as the Cook Inlet Pioneer and Knik News began on June 5, 1915, and daily publication began in October using equipment purchased from the defunct Cordova Daily Alaskan. The paper was sold to Charlie Herron in the spring of 1916, and on May 24 changed its name to The Anchorage Daily Times & Cook Inlet Pioneer.Bent Pins to Chains: Alaska and its Newspapers, p. 316 On May 29, 1917, it became the Anchorage Daily Times. In December 1924, it was sold to cover debts to a group headed by Bank of Alaska president Edward A. Rasmuson and Jacob B. Gottstein.Bent Pins to Chains: Alaska and its Newspapers, p. 321 =Bob Atwood takes the reins= In June 1935, 28-year-old Robert Bruce Atwood, Edward Rasmuson's son-in-law, arrived in Anchorage from Worcester, Massachusetts. Atwood had been brought to Alaska by Rasmuson to assume the position of editor-publisher of the paper, which at that time had a circulation of 650. He would hold the position until 1990. During the war years, Anchorage's population swelled from less than 8,000 to over 43,000, overtaking Fairbanks as Alaska's largest city, and making the Times Alaska's largest daily newspaper. In 1947, Alaska territorial governor Ernest Gruening appointed Atwood to chair the Alaska Statehood Committee. In Atwood's hands, the Anchorage Daily Times became a prominent voice for statehood. =Competition= Fourth Avenue in Anchorage in 1953, looking east from near I Street. The offices of the Times are several buildings down on the right. The Times would remain in that location until its closing, greatly expanding its offices and plant during the 1970s. That latter building stands today as the administrative headquarters of the Alaska Court System. A rival, the Anchorage Daily News, began publishing in 1948, having begun as a weekly two years earlier. Although initially more of an editorial challenge than a competitive threat, the contest would influence the course of both newspapers over the next few decades. In 1974, the Times and the Daily News entered into a joint operating agreement in order to reduce costs. Later that year, the Times would begin issuing a Sunday edition. The Daily News had been publishing Sundays since 1965. The Anchorage Daily Times was renamed the Anchorage Times in 1976. In 1977, the Daily News filed suit against the Times, claiming violations of the joint operating agreement. Atwood countered that the Daily News was really to blame for their own troubles, citing the discontinuation of subsidies to the paper by Ted Field, the son of Daily News publisher Kay Fanning and heir to the Marshall Field fortune. The papers reached an out-of-court settlement in 1978, and the agreement was terminated in 1979. In the short term, this was a setback for the struggling Daily News, which was compelled to seek outside investors. The Sacramento-based McClatchy newspaper chain, bought the Daily News that same year. McClatchy's investment fueled an all-out circulation war. By 1984, readership of the Times had fallen behind that of the Daily News. In an interview with the Alaska Journal of Commerce, Times editor and assistant publisher, Bill Tobin, traced the paper's ultimate failure to the late '80s, and to publisher Robert Atwood's resistance of the morning format. The Times remained an afternoon paper, whereas the Daily News had been publishing a morning edition since 1964. =Veco and the Voice of the Times= In 1989, Atwood sold the Times to Veco Corporation, an oilfield service company seeking to invest its profits from the clean-up efforts following the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The new management was not able to turn the paper around, and after two and a half years and claimed losses of $10 million, a decision was made to shut down operations. The paper's assets were sold to McClatchy, and the last issue of the Anchorage Times was published on June 3, 1992. A ten-year deal was inked to maintain the editorial voice of the defunct paper by way of a half-page Voice of the Times section opposite the Daily News editorial page. In 2002, this deal was renewed for another five years. On May 10, 2007, several days after Veco CEO and Voice of the Times publisher Bill Allen pleaded guilty to political bribery charges, the Daily News announced that it would terminate the agreement at the end of that month. In June, the Voice of the Times began publishing an exclusively online edition. In October 2008, the Voice of the Times announced that it would stop publishing, with a probable final date of November 1, 2008. Known Editors * Frank L. Shaw (or L.F.

In the collection of the Library of Congress. The Book of Urizen is one of the major prophetic books of the English writer William Blake, illustrated by Blake's own plates. It was originally published as The First Book of Urizen in 1794. Later editions dropped the \\"First\\". The book takes its name from the character Urizen in Blake's mythology, who represents alienated reason as the source of oppression. The book describes Urizen as the \\"primeaval priest\\" and tells how he became separated from the other Eternals to create his own alienated and enslaving realm of religious dogma. Los and Enitharmon create a space within Urizen's fallen universe to give birth to their son Orc, the spirit of revolution and freedom. In form the book is a parody of the Book of Genesis. Urizen's first four sons are Thiriel, Utha, Grodna and Fuzon (respectively elemental Air, Water, Earth, Fire, according to Chapter VIII). The last of these plays a major role in The Book of Ahania, published in 1795. Background In autumn 1790 Blake moved to Lambeth in south London. In the studio of his new house he wrote what became known as his \\"Lambeth Books\\", which included The Book of Urizen. In all these books, Blake completed their design composition, their printing and colouring, and their sales from that house.Bentley 2003 pp.122-124 Blake included early sketches for The Book of Urizen in a notebook containing images created between 1790 and 1793.Bentley 2003 p. 142 The Book of Urizen was one of the few works that Blake describes as \\"illuminated printing\\", one of his colour printed works with the coloured ink being placed on the copperplate before the page was printed.Bentley 2003 pp. 149 The Book of Urizen was printed from 1794 until 1818 and was larger than his America, A Prophecy. Only eight copies of the work survive, with many variations between them of the plate orders and the number of plates. All the surviving copies were colour-printed.Bentley 2003 p. 154 Poem Copy G, plate 7. Urizen is cast out from eternity The story deals with a struggle within the divine mind to establish and define both itself and the universe. It is a creation myth that begins before creation:Bentley 2003 p. 152 The creator is Urizen, a blind exile who was kept from eternity and who establishes a world that he could rule. As such, he creates laws:Bentley 2003 pp. 152-153 Copy G, plate 21. Los, Enitharmon, and Orc are depicted; Los with his usual attribute of the hammer However, Urizen suffers a fall when he creates a barrier to protect himself from eternity:Foster 1988 p. 423 He is chained by Los, the prophet, from whom Urizen had been rent:Bentley 2003 p. 153 Los forges a human image for Urizen in the course of seven ages, but pities him and weeps. From these tears Enitharmon is created, who soon bears the child of Los, Orc. Orc's infant cries awaken Urizen, who begins to survey and measure the world he has created. Urizen explores his world and witnesses the birth of his four sons, who represent the four classical elements. From these experiences Urizen's hopes are crushed: In response, he creates a web of religion, which serve as chains to the mind.Bentley 2003 pp. 153-154 Themes Copy G, plate 9. \\"Los howld in a dismal stupor, Groaning! gnashing! groaning! Till the wrenching apart was healed But the wrenching of Urizen heal'd not...\\" The Book of Urizen is a creation myth that is similar to the Book of Genesis. Blake's myth surrounding Urizen is found in many of his works, and can trace back to his experiments in writing myths about a god of reason in the 1780s, including in \\"To Winter\\".Bentley 2003 p. 79 In the work, Urizen is an eternal self-focused being who creates himself out of eternity. This creation is taken up again in The Four Zoas with a primal man, Albion, being the original form. In this work, it is only Urizen, the representation of abstractions and is an abstraction of the human self. From himself he first divides unknown shapes that begin to torment him. He also turns against the other Eternals and believes himself holy. In contemplating himself, he is able to discover sins and records them in a book of brass that are a combination of Newton, the laws of Moses, and deism that force uniformity. The rest of the Eternals in turn become indignant at Urizen's turning against eternity, and they establish the essence of the sins within living beings. This torments Urizen, who falls into a sleep, which allows Los to appear. Los' duty within the work is to watch over Urizen, and Urizen is seen as an eternal priest while Los takes the position of eternal prophet.Bloom 1993 pp. 71‚Äì75 Parts of the story were later revised in The Book of Los and The Book of Ahania, two experimental works.Bentley 2003 p. 156 The focus on Urizen emphasises the chains of reason that are imposed on the mind. Urizen, like mankind, is bound by these chains. The point of both The Book of Urizen and the retelling in The Book of Los is to describe how Newtonian reason and the enlightenment view of the universe combine to trap the human imagination. In the Newtonian belief the material universe is connected through an unconscious power which, in turn, characterises imagination and intellect as accidental aspects that result from this. Additionally, imagination and intelligence are secondary to force. This early version of a \\"survival of the fittest\\" universe is connected to a fallen world of tyranny and murder in Blake's view.Frye 1990 pp. 254‚Äì255 The poem portrays Orc and his three-stage cycle, whose stages are connected to historical events, although the latter are removed in The Four Zoas.Frye 1990 p. 220 In the beginning is the fall of Urizen, the Satanic force, in a similar way to Milton's Satan. Creation, however, was the fall. Urizen is the representation of abstraction, which is a passive and mental force disconnected from reality. Los, in the fallen world, enters the world as the fire of imaginative energy. However, he too falls and becomes mechanical and regular. Los is the creator of life systems and of the sexes, which leads to the creation of his partner Enitharmon. Eventually, human forms are created and Orc is born as an evolution of life.Frye 1990 pp. 254‚Äì258 Critical response Harold Bloom claimed that the poem \\"is Blake's most powerful illuminated poem before the great abandoned Four Zoas and the epics that followed it.\\"Bloom 1993 p. 71 See also * List of most expensive books and manuscripts Notes References * Bentley, G.

In the centre of the village (known locally as The Diamond) three main roads lead to Magherafelt, Portglenone and Toome. It had a population of 1,063 people in the 2001 Census and is within Mid-Ulster District. Bellaghy is home to a well-preserved 17th century fortified house, Bellaghy Bawn, which is now a museum. It is also known as the birthplace, childhood home and resting place of poet Seamus Heaney (1939‚Äì2013), who won the Nobel Prize for Literature. There is an arts centre in the village dedicated to Heaney.Roslyn Sulcas, \\"Ireland Celebrates the Life and Legacy of Nobel Prize-Winning Poet\\", New York Times, 17 October 2016  History  There had long been Gaelic settlements in this area. Archaeological evidence has been found in the village of a Gaelic ringfort. In the early 17th century, Bellaghy became one of many towns planned, built and settled under the authority of the Vintners Company of London, as part of the English Plantation of Ulster. In 1622, according to a manuscript of a Captain Thomas Ash, Bellaghy consisted of a church, a castle, a corn mill and twelve houses. Bellaghy Bawn in 2007 During the Plantation, English colonials built a fortified house in the village. It had surrounding walls and two circular towers at opposite corners. This is the best-restored example of a fortified house to be found anywhere in Northern Ireland. Recent excavations have revealed that the fortified house was built on the site of a former Gaelic ringfort. During the 1641 rebellion the house was attacked by Irish rebels, but it remained intact. Many other houses in the village were burnt to the ground. Locally it was called \\"The Castle\\" and is located on Castle Street. The refurbished house was opened to the public in 1996 as \\"Bellaghy Bawn\\". It is a museum featuring exhibitions on local history. In May 1922, during the Irish War of Independence, the Irish Republican Army launched an attack on Bellaghy Royal Irish Constabulary barracks, killing an RIC officer and wounding three others. An IRA volunteer was also killed and three captured.Lawlor, Pearse. The Outrages: The IRA and the Ulster Special Constabulary in the Border Campaign. Mercier Press, 2011. pp.268-269 People Seamus Heaney, who became a Nobel Prize-winning poet, was born as the eldest of nine children at Mossbawn, his family's farm in Bellaghy. He later lived in Dublin but is buried in the graveyard of St Mary's Catholic Church, Bellaghy. The village has an arts centre dedicated to him, known as the Seamus Heaney HomePlace. The centre features talks, poetry readings, and performances. It has exhibits of photographs, texts, and poems to show the influence of place on his language. Others to hail from the village include World Outdoor Bowls champion Margaret Johnston, computer engineer Fred Kennedy \\\\- who made an important contribution to the Apollo 11 moon landing - and international footballer Sarah McFadden. Two Bellaghy natives, Francis Hughes and his cousin Thomas McElwee, died participating in the 1981 Irish hunger strike during the Troubles. They were protesting at the treatment by the British and supporting political change in Northern Ireland.

He is an officer of S.H.I.E.L.D. and is one of the most experienced members of Nick Fury's team, known for his marksmanship with rifles and impressive physique. He is recognized for his trademark bowler hat. Neal McDonough appeared as the character in the 2011 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Captain America: The First Avenger, the 2013 Marvel Studios short film Agent Carter (post-credits) and also in 2015 in the fifth episode of the first season of Marvel's Agent Carter. Publication history Dum Dum Dugan first appeared in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #1 (May 1963), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Dum Dum Dugan received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89 #2. Fictional character biography Dum Dum Dugan was originally portrayed as a British citizen in Sgt Fury #1, but later retconned to be born in Boston, Massachusetts. During World War II, while working as a circus strongman, Dugan helps Nick Fury and Sam \\"Happy\\" Sawyer escape the Nazis during a mission, recounted in issue #34. Dugan joins the British Army, and when Sawyer is charged with creating Fury's First Attack Squad, formally listed as \\"Able Company\\" and nicknamed the Howling Commandos, Sawyer invites Dugan to transfer into the US Army and become Fury's second-in-command. Dugan's exceptional strength saves the day in several of his adventures in the Sgt. Fury comic books. Dugan is an enlisted man with the rank of corporal, and wears the chevrons of his rank on the front top of his trademark bowler hat throughout World War II. Dugan leaves the U.S. Army before the Korean War, but rejoins during the war as Second Lieutenant under the promoted First Lieutenant Fury, once again as his second-in-command of the reformed Howling Commandos.

Dugan's exact rank is not stated, but he is addressed as \\"Captain\\" at one point. He remains with Fury when Fury goes into the CIA and later into the original S.H.I.E.L.D. Different accounts state that Dugan and other members of Fury's Howling Commandos receive the Infinity Formula to explain how they all remain youthful and active despite being all into their 60s and 70s in the modern era. Other stories contradict this artificial maintenance of youth by Dugan as merely dyeing his hair and suffering a heart attack.Captain America (Vol 1) #284 Later on in life, he is placed in charge of internal security on the S.H.I.E.L.D.

After the events of Civil War and as Tony Stark takes over as director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Dugan turns in his letter of resignation, stating that he does not approve of the changes Stark has made, or the way he runs the organization. Dugan's resignation is not accepted however, as he is too vital to S.H.I.E.L.D.; despite his disapproval of Stark's leadership, Stark still trusts Dugan, and Dugan alone, with the command of a weapon that could send an abandoned Manhattan into the Negative Zone, destroying the island and anyone inside during World War Hulk, stating that Hulk and the Warbound are too dangerous a global threat to leave Manhattan free. Stark trusts that Dugan will know the appropriate time to execute the plan, if at all. Dugan never used the weapon. Dugan later proved his worth and loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D during a confrontation with Maria Hill, where he forced her to confront the fact that she was apparently willing to take actions that would allow innocent people to die while still sticking to 'the book' because the alternative was to disobey orders, informing her that some situations weren't in 'the book'.Iron Man #26 Inspired by Dugan's words, Hill ended up putting her career on the line by locking down the United Nations under S.H.I.E.L.D. martial law so Stark could escape a tribunal and track down the Mandarin, with Dugan providing Stark with a version of the Silver Centurion armor after his Extremis abilities were deactivated.Iron Man #28.

Armimex was established in 1992 as a specialised company for trade with special and dual‚Äìuse equipment, by a decree of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria. It is a public limited company incorporating the 23 main military factories in Bulgaria as shareholders.  Establishment of the company  Because of the deep political and economic changes and the abrogation of the Warsaw Pact on March 2, 1992, the main Bulgarian arms trading company during the communist period‚ÄîGIU (Main Engineering Department) -- was liquidated with a Regulation 21 by the Council of the Ministers. The GIU‚Äôs liquidation procedures continued into 1994, without any proper resolution of its debt. On April 16, 1992, a new state- owned trading company, Armimex LLC, was established, representing the interests of the largest military enterprises in Bulgaria. The company incorporated 23 of Bulgaria‚Äôs largest defence industry companies as shareholders: VMZ, Arsenal, Optikoelektron, Beta, Samel-90, and Arkus among others. It has both a board of directors appointed by the shareholder companies and a supervisory council appointed directly by the government. It received part of the assets of GIU, but is not its successor in the juridical sense. Armimex also became the holder of Russian production licenses given to Bulgaria. Armimex incorporated a vast array of activities, including import, export and re-export of military and civilian products, training of foreign specialists, repair and overhaul, engineering activity in establishing enterprises and production facilities, as well as investment activity and the rendering of technical assistance. The export list of Armimex consisted of military equipment for all services of the armed forces including armament, ammunition, armoured vehicles, engineering equipment and explosives, aiming and surveillance equipment, communication and electronic warfare equipment, radar equipment, naval craft, equipment, et cetera. Along with that, the export list of the company consisted of constantly increasing share of military items by NATO standards. During the 1990s the company made some significant arms deals in Nigeria, Yemen, Bangladesh and other countries. The Israeli plane brought down in Mombassa, Kenya in 2002 by Al Qaeda was shot at with Bulgarian SAM \\"Strela\\". Their identification number showed that they were produced at the Armaments plant in Sopot in 1991-93. They were exported to Yemen by Armimex in 1993. The deal amounted to about USD 8 million and it was between the Ministry of Defence of Yemen and the Bulgarian Ministry of Defence.  Sting Operation  Armimex became infamous after the successful US operation against a big illicit arms deal. In March 1995 a broker in Florida met with a Lithuanian national of Russian origin, Alexander Darichev. The broker explained he was a member of a Colombian drug cartel, and was looking for sophisticated weaponry. Darichev presented himself as a broker of weapons and weapon systems with contacts in government agencies in Russia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and elsewhere. Representing a company, Armimex, in Bulgaria that was apparently licensed to manufacture Russian weapon designs, Darichev offered a whole range of weaponry, from automatic rifles to shoulder-launched surface- to-air missiles. The client showed an interest in the Russian anti-aircraft missiles, including Strela 2M, Strela 3M and Igla systems, which are designed to destroy low-flying airplanes or helicopters. If the deal went through successfully, Darichev and a partner of his, Aleksandr Pogrebezskij of Lithuania, hoped also to be able to procure nuclear warheads. During several meetings in the following months between the broker and Darichev, a complex mechanism was set up, using front companies and government officials on both sides of the Atlantic. The Lithuanians wanted the deal to look legitimate. In Florida, the agent of the Colombian narcotics traffickers set up a company called Phoenix International. In April 1996, one year after the first meeting, the US-based broker went to Russia to examine the weapon systems. In the following months, a company and several bank accounts on the Isle of Man were opened, in order to facilitate the financial end. The value of the missile contracts totalled over $3 million; upon delivery of two sample missile systems, a first payment of $50,000 would be made. The money was then to be channelled through a US account at Prudential Securities in the name of another company, Alita Corporation. In December 1996, Pogrebezskij instructed Prudential Securities in Florida to transfer the money to New York. Two days later, $49,800 was transferred from Prudential Securities in New York to Snoras Bank in Vilnius, Lithuania. The Lithuanians had arranged for the transport of the missiles, through the services of Angelo Zeini, the Cypriot owner of merchant ships who had offered his vessel, the M/V AI Fares, to smuggle the missile systems into the USA. Zeini would send the ship to Bulgaria to pick up the weapons systems and use false paperwork, provided by the Lithuanians, indicating that the ship would be transporting 15 forty-foot containers of machinery and general cargo to Puerto Rico. One container, with the missile systems, would be commingled with the others in order to pass inspection at the Straits of Gibraltar. Because Armimex could sell these kinds of weapons only to governments, Darichev and Pogrebezskij arranged to acquire an end-user certificate from the Republic of Lithuania, signed by and bearing the seal of the Lithuanian Minister of Defense. The client was also reassured that if the missile systems were to be used, they could not be traced and that the Lithuanian Ministry of Defence would issue a false letter of receipt upon delivery of the weapons in Puerto Rico. In July 1997 the negotiations came to an end. At a meeting in a hotel in Miami, US agents arrested Pogrebezskij and Darichev. What the Lithuanians had not realised was that their US brokers were not representing Colombian narcotics traffickers: they were undercover US customs agents from Miami, exposing the first credible post‚ÄìCold War plot to smuggle tactical nuclear weapons into the USA. The customs agents had wanted to continue their investigation up to the point of actually purchasing the nuclear devices, but only the missile part of the deal had been permissible under US national security regulations. After his arrest, Darichev cooperated with the US District Court Attorney and made monitored calls to the Bulgarian company Armimex confirming that 40 shoulder-to-air missiles were indeed waiting to be shipped to Phoenix Arms International. The US Justice Department also determined that the Lithuanian Minister of Defense had in fact signed the end-user certificates. He later resigned. Darichev and Pogrebezskij were convicted on charges of smuggling, money laundering and conspiracy. As in many such prosecutions in the United States, they were given only a four-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. In June 2003, the Sofia City Court ruled Armimex bankrupt, terminating its operation and ordering a liquidation of its assets.

She was the first propeller-driven gunboat in the world.  History  During the First War of Schleswig, 1848-1850 between Denmark and the two duchies, the Schleswig-Holstein navy comprised three paddlewheelers with sail rigging, a schooner and 12 gunboats; their task was to protect the coast against Danish raids. Von der Tann 1849. Painting by L√ºder Arenhold, 1891 Initially called Gunboat No. 1, Von der Tann was the most modern of these ships. Her steam engine, built by August Howaldt at Schweffel und Howaldt's works in Kiel, gave her and a top speed (under steam) of six knots. She carried the rigging of a three-mast schooner, with a very tall funnel behind the main mast. Her armament comprised two 64-pounder guns mounted on swivels fore and aft plus four three-pounder howitzers. Vilhelm Melbye: Von der Tann aground at Neustadt. (The Hekla seen in the background) During the night of 20/21 July 1850, Von der Tann had captured a Danish freighter in the bay of L√ºbeck, but was not permitted to enter the neutral port of Travem√ºnde which belonged to the Free Hanseatic City of L√ºbeck. When Von der Tann attempted to enter the port of Neustadt in Holstein, she was engaged by Danish naval forces, the ships Heckla and Valkyren. During the ensuing battle, Von der Tann accidentally ran aground just outside Neustadt harbor. The ship was abandoned and set on fire by her crew, but was later repaired and put back into service. In 1853, after the end of the First War of Schleswig, Von der Tann was taken over by the Danish navy and renamed St√∏ren. She was decommissioned and scrapped in 1862. The engine was reused in the gunboat Hauch.  Legacy  A model and some pieces of wreckage are on display at the Ostholstein-Museum in Neustadt. A later ship of the same name was the Imperial German battlecruiser . Both were named after the Bavarian general Ludwig Freiherr von und zu der Tann-Rathsamhausen who, as a young officer, had organized and commanded the militia of Schleswig.

Ahania is the Emanation, or female counterpart, of Urizen, Zoas of reason, in William Blake's mythology. She is the representation of pleasure and the desire for intelligence. Although Urizen casts her out as being the manifestation of sin, she is actually an essential component in Blake's system to achieving Divine Wisdom. She is a figure of the goddess of wisdom. It is through her that the sons and daughters of Urizen are born. In the original myth, her son Fuzon rebels against his father and is responsible for separating Urizen and Ahania. In his later version, Ahania is separated from Urizen after he believes that she is sinful. Character Ahania represents pleasure and is connected to the Zoas Urizen, who represents reason. They are divided because Urizen is unable to understand the necessity of pleasure for the mind. In Blake's early myth, Ahania and Urizen are united until their son Fuzon separates the two by cutting his father's loins apart. She is labeled as Sin by Urizen and hidden away with her only capable of lamenting her fate.Damon 1988 pp. 7‚Äì8 Ahania is the representation of a wisdom goddess, as she is an emanation of Urizen, who is connected to the head.Bloom 1993 p. 32 In Blake's later myth, she provides Urizen with twelve sons and three daughters, which represent the Zodiac and the three parts of the body. However, Urizen believes that Ahania has too much influence and denies her the ability to come to the marriage of Los and Enitharmon. In return, she becomes cold and distant. Eventually, Los and Enitharmon bring Ahania to hear Enion's wailing.Damon 1988 p. 8 After Enion reveals the fallen world to Ahania, she represents intellectual desire and has a sexual element. Although she is cast off as being sinful, she is necessary for Divine Wisdom and is essential for any act of creation.Bloom 1993 p. 85 Urizen tells her that he is afraid that Orc, the one that would overthrow him, would be born, and Ahania describes her vision of a dark future. Urizen, upset, separates from her because she is not obedient enough for him. In despair, she enters the Caverns of the Grave. She returns on the Last Judgment when Urizen stops trying to control everything. This action allows Urizen to regain his previous form. In the feast after the Final Judgment, she is reunited with Urizen. Appearances Ahania is described in The Book of Ahania (1795), which gives her origins. She was originally part of Urizen until her son, Fuzon, rebelled against Urizen and cut apart his loins. This established her as a separate entity, and Urizen named her Sin. The work ends with Fuzon's death by the hands of Urizen. Eventually, this version was overwritten in Vala, or The Four Zoas. The later version describes her more as his shadow counterpart and as the mother of their many children. Urizen is a jealous lover, which causes her to despair. Eventually, she is separated from Urizen when she hears Enion's lament. Ahania appears in Milton a Poem, and she is described as lamenting after she is cast out. In Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion, Ahania is described as a shade when Los is able to see the four Emanations.Damon 1988 pp. 8‚Äì9 Notes References * Bloom, Harold.

Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix.  Discovery  The type species Xuanhanosaurus qilixiaensis was named by Dong Zhiming in 1984. The generic name refers to Xuanhan County in Sichuan, while the specific name is derived from the town of Qilixia. The holotype specimen, IVPP V.6729, was found in China's Lower Shaximiao Formation. It consists of a partial skeleton without a skull.Dong, Z. (1984). \\"A new theropod dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic of Sichuan Basin\\". Vertebrata PalAsiatica 22(3):213-218  Description  alt= Xuanhanosaurus was approximately 4.5 meters (15 ft) in length, with a weight of 250 kilograms (550 lb). Xuanhanosaurus had powerful forelimbs, over 65 cm long; this, along with the retention of the fourth metacarpal in the hand, led Dong to suggest that Xuanhanosaurus might have walked on all four legs. If so, it would be the only known four-legged meat-eater among dinosaurs. Later paleontologists have not agreed with Dong's original assessment. They think this dinosaur walked on its hind legs as other theropods did, pronation of the lower arm being impossible. The strong arms could instead have been useful in catching prey.  Phylogeny  Assigned by Dong to the Megalosauridae, Xuanhanosaurus was found by Roger Benson in 2009 to belong to a primitive lineage of the Megalosauroidea. A more recent study by Benson and colleagues in 2010 found that it was more likely to be the most primitive known member of the Metriacanthosauridae family. Supporting Information In 2019, Rauhut and Pol recovered Xuanhanosaurus outside of Metriacanthosauridae, as the basalmost member of Allosauroidea.

Inherent safety contrasts with other processes where a high degree of hazard is controlled by protective systems. As perfect safety cannot be achieved, common practice is to talk about inherently safer design. ‚ÄúAn inherently safer design is one that avoids hazards instead of controlling them, particularly by reducing the amount of hazardous material and the number of hazardous operations in the plant.‚Äù Heikkil√§, Anna-Mari. Inherent safety in process plant design. An index-based approach. Espoo 1999, Technical Research Centre of Finland, VTT Publications 384. Origins The concept of reducing rather than controlling hazards stems from British chemical engineer Trevor Kletz in a 1978 article entitled ‚ÄúWhat You Don‚Äôt Have, Can‚Äôt Leak‚Äù on lessons from the Flixborough disaster,Kletz, T.A., (1978) Chemistry and Industry pp, 287‚Äì292 ‚ÄúWhat You Don‚Äôt Have, Can‚Äôt Leak‚Äù and the name ‚Äòinherent safety‚Äô from a book which was an expanded version of the article.Kletz, T.A., (1984) Cheaper, Safer Plants or Wealth and Safety at Work ‚ÄìNotes on Inherently Safer and Simpler Plants IChemE Rugby, UK A greatly revised and retitled 1991 versionKletz, T. A., (1991) Plant Design for Safety ‚Äì A User-Friendly Approach, Hemisphere, New York mentioned the techniques which are generally quoted. (Kletz originally used the term intrinsically safe in 1978, but as this had already been used for the special case of electronic equipment in potentially flammable atmospheres, only the term inherent was adopted. Intrinsic safety may be considered a special subset of inherent safety.) In 2010 the American Institute of Chemical Engineers published its own definition of IST.Center for Chemical Process Safety and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, Final Report: Definition for Inherently Safer Technology in Production, Transportation, Storage, and Use (July 2010) 1-54.https://www.aiche.org/sites/default/files/docs/embedded- pdf/ist_final_definition_report.pdf Principles The terminology of inherent safety has developed since 1991, with some slightly different words but the same intentions as Kletz. The four main methods for achieving inherently safer design are: *Minimize:Kletz originally used the term intensification, which is understood by chemical engineers to involve smaller equipment with the same product throughput Reducing the amount of hazardous material present at any one time, e.g. by using smaller batches. *Substitute: Replacing one material with another of less hazard, e.g. cleaning with water and detergent rather than a flammable solvent *Moderate:Kletz originally used the word attenuation Reducing the strength of an effect, e.g. having a cold liquid instead of a gas at high pressure, or using material in a dilute rather than concentrated form *Simplify: Eliminating problems by design rather than adding additional equipment or features to deal with them. Only fitting options and using complex procedures if they are really necessary. Two further principles are used by some: *Error tolerance: Equipment and processes can be designed to be capable of withstanding possible faults or deviations from design. A very simple example is making piping and joints capable of withstanding the maximum possible pressure, if outlets are closed. *Limit effects by design, location or transportation of equipment so that the worst possible condition produces less danger, e.g. gravity will take a leak to a safe place, the use of bunds. In terms of making plants more user-friendly Kletz added the following: *Avoiding knock-on effects; *Making incorrect assembly impossible; *Making status clear; *Ease of control; *Software and management procedures. The opportunity to adopt an inherently safer design is ideal at the research and conceptual design stages; such opportunity decreases and the project cost increases if changes are made during the subsequent design stages. Once a conceptual design is completed, the other safety strategies should be applied along with the inherently safer design concept. However, in this case, the project cost would significantly increase to have the same risk level at the same reliability relative to if ISD was adopted during the conceptual design stage. Official status Inherent safety has been recognised as a desirable principle by a number of national authorities, including the US Nuclear Regulatory CommissionFederal Register: May 9, 2008 (Volume 73, Number 91) 10 CFR Part 50 Regulation of Nuclear Power Plants; Draft Statement of Policy and the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE). In assessing COMAH (Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations) sites the HSE states ‚ÄúMajor accident hazards should be avoided or reduced at source through the application of principles of inherent safety‚Äù. The European Commission in its Guidance Document on the Seveso II Directive states ‚ÄúHazards should be possibly avoided or reduced at source through the application of inherently safe practices.‚Äù In California, Contra Costa County requires chemical plants and petroleum refineries to implement inherent safety reviews and make changes based on these reviews. After a 2008 methyl isocyanate explosion at the Bayer CropScience chemical production plant in Institute, West Virginia, the US Chemical Safety Board commissioned a study by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) how the concept of ‚ÄúInherent Safety‚Äù could be applied, published in a report and video in 2012. After the Bhopal disaster in 1984, the US state of New Jersey adopted the Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act(TCPA) from 1985. In 2003 its rules were revised to include inherently safer technologies (IST). In 2005, the New Jersey Domestic Security Preparedness Task Force established a new ‚ÄúBest Practices Standards‚Äù program, in which it required chemical facilities to conduct inherently safer technologies (IST) reviews. In 2008, the TCPA program was expanded to require all TCPA facilities to conduct IST reviews on both new and existing processes.40 N.J.R. 2254(a), May 5, 2008 The State of New Jersey created its own definition of IST for regulatory purposes and stretched the definition of IST to include passive, active, and procedural controls. Under Executive Order 13650Wikisource:Executive Order 13650 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been considering a proposal to ‚Äúnationalize‚Äù the New Jersey inherently safer technologies program, inviting comments until end of October 2014.

The plan was to replace him with Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March. Overview Mortimer was the great-grandson of Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, second surviving son of King Edward III, and his claim to the throne was thus superior to that of Henry V and his father, Henry IV, who derived their claim from Henry IV's father, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, third surviving son of Edward III. Moreover, Edmund Mortimer's father, Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, had been widely considered heir presumptive to King Richard II, who had no issue, and Edmund Mortimer himself had been heir presumptive to Richard II while a young child.; . The three ringleaders of the plot were Edmund Mortimer's brother-in-law, Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge; Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham (whose uncle Richard le Scrope had been executed for his part in a 1405 revolt); and Sir Thomas Grey, whose son, Thomas, had been betrothed in 1412 to Cambridge's only daughter, Isabel.; . The nominal principal, the Earl of March, informed King Henry of the plot on 31 July, stating that he had only just become aware of it. Richard, Scrope, and Grey were promptly arrested. The trial took place in Southampton; traditionally it is claimed that trial took place on the site now occupied by the Red Lion Inn, but there are no contemporary records of this. Grey was beheaded on 2 August and the two peers on 5 August, both in front of the Bargate. Satisfied, Henry sailed for France on 11 August. Scrope's involvement in the conspiracy surprised contemporaries, and continues to puzzle historians, as he was a royal favourite. Ian Mortimer claims Scrope had merely insinuated himself into the confidence of Cambridge and Grey to betray the conspiracy, just as Edward, Duke of York had done with the Epiphany Rising in 1400, but was forestalled by Edmund Mortimer's revelation of the conspiracy to the King on 31 July. Pugh, however, finds Scrope's exculpatory statements at trial unconvincing, and states that Scrope never pretended that he had intended to inform the King of the conspiracy.. Pugh also contends that \\"there was no plot in 1415 to assassinate Henry V and his three brothers and that heinous charge, by far the most sensational in the indictment, was fabricated to ensure that Cambridge, Grey and Scrope did not escape the death penalty as a well-deserved punishment for the various other offences that they undoubtedly had committed\\".. Aftermath With the death of the Duke of York, the Earl of Cambridge's elder brother, at the Battle of Agincourt later that year, Cambridge's son Richard Plantagenet became heir to the title, which would eventually be returned to him after Henry V's death. Through his mother, he also inherited the Mortimer claim to the throne on the Earl of March's death; later in life Richard would use this claim to try to dethrone King Henry VI. Dramatisation The Southampton Plot is dramatised in Shakespeare's Henry V, in which it is portrayed as a French-financed betrayal of the king to stop Henry's invasion plans. It is also portrayed in the anonymous play, The History of Sir John Oldcastle (c.1600) and in William Kenrick's Falstaff's Wedding (1760).

Ewen was a founding member of the Non-figurative artist's association of Montr√©al, along with Claude Tousignant, Jean-Paul Mousseau, Guido Molinari, and Marcel Barbeau. Moving to London, Ontario in the late 1960s, Ewen became central to the emerging London Regionalism being championed by Jack Chambers and Greg Curnoe. It was in London that Ewen developed the carved-plywood style that would become his hallmark. Biography William Paterson Ewen was born in 1925 in Montreal, Quebec. Interested in art from a young age, he began by sculpting small figures in wax, and at thirteen petitioned his mother to hang art on the previously unadorned walls of the Ewen residence. Beginning in 1944, Ewen served in a reconnaissance regiment on the Western Front (World War II), but was not involved in active combat. Upon his return to Canada, he enrolled in McGill University. He studied geology, but after his first year he began to struggle with depression, and sought relief in copying magazine covers and sketching the landscape around Canadian Officers' Training Corps at Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier where he had re-enlisted for the summer. When he returned to school in the fall, Ewen signed up for a figure-drawing course taught by John Goodwin Lyman. The experience was, as Ewen recalls it, unpleasant. The next year he transferred to the School of Art and Design at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, where he studied under Goodridge Roberts, Arthur Lismer, Marian Dale Scott, William Armstrong, Moses Reinblatt, and Jacques de Tonnancour. Ewen sometimes recalled this period, caught up in Goodridge's orbit and the \\"sympathetic atmosphere,\\" of the program, as \\"the happiest days of [his] life.Ewen, ‚ÄúPaterson Ewen, March, 1976,‚Äù 341, and Matthew Teitelbaum, Paterson Ewen: The Montreal Years (Saskatoon: Mendel Art Gallery, 1987), 36. In 1949, Ewen married the influential painter, sculptor and choreographer Fran√ßoise Sullivan, with whom he had four sons. Sullivan was an important member of Les Automatistes, and Ewen would often attend Automatiste events and \\"sit without taking part in the conversation all that much, but of course it was very enriching [for him].\\" Ewen's graduation that same year marked the end of his veteran's allowance, and so he went to work, first making hats, then selling rugs at Ogilvy's. He eventually found a position with Sullivan's father as an assistant secretary to the chief administrator at the municipal rent control board, where he remained until taking an employment supervisor position at Bathurst Containers in 1956. When Sullivan and Ewen separated in 1966, and Ewen once again grappled with major depression. In 1968 he moved to Kitchener, Ontario in order to be closer to his sister Marjorie, and immediately checked himself into the Westminster Veteran's Hospital for intensive treatment, including electroconvulsive therapy. Ewen felt that the treatment was helpful, and that it restored him to \\"a state of good physical and mental health,\\"Paterson Ewen interview by Robert McKaskell, London, Ontario, spring 1976, cited in Teitelbaum,Paterson Ewen, 115. though he continued to struggle with his mental health and his relationship to alcohol. He went on to teach at H. B. Beal Secondary School until he was awarded a Canada Council grant in 1971. The grant allowed him to take a studio in Toronto, and this is where he developed his signature style, gouging landscapes out of massive plywood sheets with an electric router. When Ewen returned to Toronto, his Beal Secondary job had gone to someone else, but there was an opening at the University of Western Ontario. Ewen would spend 14 years at UWO as a painting instructor. This is where he met architecture student Mary Handford, who became his wife in 1995.  Career  Ewen's career began with explorations of the landscape.The influence of James Wilson Morrice, and his professor Goodridge Roberts can be seen in Ewen's early works, completed while he was still attending the School of Art and Design. During this period Ewen was, in his own words, \\"a pretty straightforward figurative painter influenced by the Post-Impressionists.\\"Paterson Ewen interview by Greg Curnoe, March 18, 1969, cited in Teitelbaum, Paterson Ewen, 99. This began to change around 1949, when Fran√ßoise Sullivan's influence and the Automatiste milieu pushed Ewen towards abstraction. This tension between surface and figurative form can be seen in paintings like Interior, Fort Street, Montr√©al [#1] (1951). Ewen showed very little until 1955, when he began exhibiting abstract works. This new way of painting balanced the psychic automatism of les Automatistes with the rising star of hard-edged geometric Plasticiens like Molinari and Tousignant, both of whom Ewen shared a studio with in the mid-1960s. During this period, Ewen was also influenced by Camilla Gray's work on Russian Constructivism, the monochromes of Paul-√âmile Borduas, and the work of Northwest Coast artistsThis refers broadly to works by Tlingit, Haida, Heiltsuk, Nuxalk, Tsimshian, Kwakwaka'wakw, Nuu-chah-nulth artists, but the ROM's collection has a specific history with Kwakwaka'wakw arts spoliated from Alert Bay in 1921 under the Canadian government's Potlatch ban. on display at the Royal Ontario Museum. In 1971 Ewen moved to London, and there found inspiration in the growing London Regionalism movement, which emphasized specificity of place and time. Once again, Ewen's methods changed dramatically, rejecting abstraction in favour of dynamic, figurative \\"phenomscapes.\\" This way of looking at landscape allowed Ewen to revisit his boyhood interests in geology and space. The new pieces were physically large, often using several standard 4' x 8' sheets of plywood side by side. Ewen used a router to tear into the surface, sometimes re-attaching objects to the plane with hardware. These shallow topographies were then painted with huge, rolling forces, gestures towards what Roald Nasgaard called \\"a strategy to make landscape painting vital again.\\"Adele Freedman, ‚ÄúPhenomenology,‚Äù Canadian Art4, no. 4 (Winter 1987): 61. Ewen described this way of working as cathartic: > I enjoyed the physicality of it, particularly after the meticulousness of > the hard-edge painting. It was like a kind of therapy. I may not have felt > the tension and anger pouring out of me when I did it, but it felt awfully > good afterwards.Cited in Graham, ‚ÄúTwenty-Four Sketches,‚Äù 26. These were the works that solidified Ewen's place in the annals of Canadian art. He worked on many series in this mode, returning again, and again to the ever-changing natural world. No subject is more integral to an understanding Ewen's work, and perhaps Ewen himself, than the moon, whose phases he painted endlessly. As John G. Hatch writes: \\"by tying the moon‚Äôs many faces to constant change in the natural world, Ewen made sense of his own moods and affirmed his connection to the universe.\\"  Selected exhibitions  * 2000: Palazzo Grassi, Venice: Cosmos: From Goya to De Chirico, From Friedrich to Kiefer * 1996: Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto: Ewen: Earthly Weathers, Heavenly Skies (major retrospective) * 1982: Venice Biennale  Selected collections  * National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa * Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto * Mus√©e d'art contemporain de Montr√©al * Montreal Museum of Fine Arts * Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art, Toronto * MIT List Visual Artistiiscis centres of the west  Selected publications  * Hatch, John G.

Records of bottle-kicking date to the late 18th century, but the custom is thought to originate much earlier, from before the Christian era. Origin and history Local lore claims that the custom began when two ladies of Hallaton were saved from a raging bull by a startled hare, distracting the bull from its charge. They showed their gratitude to God for sending the hare by donating money to the church on the understanding that every Easter Monday, the vicar would provide a hare pie, twelve penny loaves, and two barrels of beer for the poor of the village. The Hallaton villagers would fight each other for the food and drink, and on one occasion, the residents of the neighbouring village of Medbourne joined the fray and stole the beer. The Hallatonians cooperated to retrieve the spoils, thus beginning the village rivalry that still exists. Other explanations of the custom's origin include the idea that the tradition harks back to England's pagan past, when hares were sacrificed to the goddess ƒíostre. Bottle-kicking has been an annual tradition for over 200 years. The tradition has been cancelled only twice in that time: once in 2001 because of concerns over foot-and-mouth disease, and also in 2020 due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Legend has it that the rector of Hallaton, opposed to the tradition because of its pagan origins, tried to ban the event in 1790. However, he relented the next day, after the words \\"No pie, no parson\\" appeared scrawled on the wall of the vicarage overnight.  Procession and hare pie scramble The event starts with a parade through the villages of Medbourne and Hallaton. Locals carry a large hare pie and the three \\"bottles\\", which are actually small kegs or barrels. Two of the bottles are filled with beer; the third, called \\"the dummy\\", is made of solid wood and painted red and white. The pie is blessed by the Hallaton vicar before being cut apart and thrown to the crowd for the \\"scramble\\". The rest is placed in a sack to be carried up the nearby Hare Pie Hill. The bottles are then taken to the Buttercross (a conical structure with a sphere on top, used for keeping butter and cheese cool when the village was a market town) on the village green to be dressed with ribbons. Here, the penny loaves are distributed to the crowd. The order of events in 2009 was as follows: 9.30am: Parade through Medbourne, traditionally held to ‚Äòwake‚Äô the villagers. 10am: Tug-of-war match between Ashley and Medbourne in the field behind The George pub in Ashley. 11am: Church service in Hallaton at 11am. 1.45pm: Hare Pie parade from the Fox Inn, Hallaton, to the church gates. About 2.50pm: Parade departs to the bottle kicking field, with the pie handed out to the crowd. 3.15pm: ‚ÄòKick-off‚Äô http://www.harboroughmail.co.uk/custompages/custompage.aspx?pageid=78241 Game There are virtually no rules to the bottle-kicking, except that there is no eye-gouging, no strangling, and no use of weapons. In the early afternoon, the hare pie is spread on the ground at a dip at the top of Hare Pie Bank, which is possibly the site of an ancient temple. Each bottle is then tossed in the air three times, signalling the start of the competition. Each team tries to move the bottles, on a best-of-three basis, across two streams one mile (1.6 km) apart, by any means possible. The contest is a rough one, with teams fighting to move the bottles over such obstacles as ditches, hedges, and barbed wire. Broken bones are not unheard-of, and emergency services are generally on standby. After the game, participants and spectators return to the village. Those players who put in an especially good effort (for example, carrying a barrel across the goal stream or holding on to a barrel for quite some time) are helped up onto the top of the ten-foot-tall Buttercross, and the opened bottle is passed up for them to drink from before being passed around the crowd. The festive day normally draws to a close with participants and spectators retiring to the pub for drink and banter. Locals say a visiting grandson took the basics of bottle-kicking back to his university in rugby, creating the modern game of rugby. The rugby ball also mimicks the shape of the small beer keg (bottle) used in the pagan event.

She was one of the best known female photographers of the early 20th century. Initially she influenced and was influenced by Edward Weston while working in the pictorial style, but she independently developed a strong eye for patterns and design that transformed some of her photographs into modernist abstract art. She lived a mostly uncompromising lifestyle in Los Angeles that alternated between her photography and the creative Hollywood community of the 1920s and 1930s. In later life she abandoned photography, and she died unrecognized for her photographic accomplishments.  Life and career  Mather was born in Salt Lake City, Utah the second of four children born to Gabriel Lundberg Youngreen and Ane Sofie Laurentzen. Her parents were Danish immigrants who had been converted to the Mormon faith by a missionary in Denmark. Her mother died while giving birth to the fourth child in 1889Warren 2011, 19 When she was born, Mather was named Emma Caroline Youngreen.Warren 2001, 12 After her mother died she was sent to live in another part of town with her maternal aunt, Rasmine Laurentzen. Laurentzen was the live-in housekeeper for local judge Joseph Cole Mather, and the then Emma Caroline was listed in census records as either a \\"boarder\\" or \\"student\\".Warren 2011, 23 In 1906 Mather moved to San Francisco, perhaps in response to calls for aid after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Within two years after moving she changed her name, assuming the last name of her former landlord and the first name of her maternal grandmother, Margrethe Laurentzen. She never explained the reason for her name change to anyone, although photography historian Beth Gates Warren speculated that it might have been due to distancing herself from an affair with a physician that began in Salt Lake City.Warren 2011, 25 In 1912 Mather moved to Los Angeles, where, according to her friend Billy Justema, she made a living primarily as a prostitute for several years.Justema, 6-7 Soon after moving there she joined the Los Angeles Camera Club and also became involved with a circle of self-styled anarchists who were followers of Emma Goldman. Within a year she was part of a growing Bohemian movement in the city that included actors, artists, writers and advocates for social and political change. Her interest in photography quickly blossomed, and by the following year at least one of her photographs had been exhibited in camera club salons in both America and Europe.Warren 2001, 10 She met photographer Edward Weston in the autumn of 1913 when she went to his studio in nearby Tropico. Mather and Weston found they had many of the same photographic interests, and by both Weston's and Mather's accounts the two became intensely involved with each other within six months after they met. At the time, Mather was described as \\"maddening to the eye, the heart and whatever might be left of reason...distinctly marvelous and infuriating as an individual.\\"Nancy Newhall, quoted in Warren 2011, 56-57 Soon after they met Mather proposed that Weston, she and a small circle of friends that included Fred R. Archer form a new camera club, the Camera Pictorialists of Los Angeles. The club eventually became very influential, but Mather and Weston dropped out after only a year.Wilson, 69 By that time Weston had begun to receive widespread national and international acclaim, and Mather's relationship with him became more intense as his fame grew. In 1916 Mather moved to a boarding house in the Bunker Hill neighborhood, where she was said to become involved with a woman referred to only as \\"Beau\\"Warren 2001, 16 Justema believes \\"Beau\\" was Mather's lover and patron, to the extent that soon after the two met Mather opened her first professional photography studio.Justema, 8 Although Mather's earliest known photograph dates from 1913, until she opened her studio there is very little record of her photographic output. During her early years Mather worked in the pictorialist style. One of the first images she created after opening her studio was a soft-focus portrait, Miss Maud Emily, which was later published in Photograms of the Year. She also undertook a series of portraits for the avant-garde magazine The Little Review, including poet Alfred Kreymborg and heiress Aline Barnsdall. Her involvement with the Bohemian circle in Los Angeles also expanded, and through these connections she became friends a growing circle of celebrities and intellectuals like Charlie Chaplin, Max Eastman and Florence Deshon. By 1918 she was working regularly with Weston, and the two exchanged both stylistic ideas and photographic techniques. That same year she completed a series of portraits of the Chinese poet Moon Kwan that utilized strong shadows as artistic elements. Weston had first experimented with shadows as a dramatic design element in his portrait of Eugene Hutchinson in 1916, but Mather formalized this approach into a continuing stylistic element in her portraits for many years after that. This style was so unusual at the time that one critic wrote \\"The appreciation of this form of composition‚Ä¶is at present with the writer purely an intellectual one, like that of some of the newer forms in music and painting. Presumably the next generation will accept arrangements like this instinctively. Such is the way in which art grows.\\"Frank Roy Fraprie, quoted in Warren 2001, 22 In 1921 Mather's and Weston's joint photographic interests reached the point that they entered into a semi-formal partnership. For most of that year they created a series of about a dozen photographs that they jointly signed ‚Äì the only time in Weston's career that he was known to have shared credit with another photographerWarren 2001, 28 One reviewer referred to the two photographers as an \\"art partnership,\\" although there are some indications that Mather might have taken at least some of the photos on her own and signed both names on the prints During this same period she made several stunning portraits of Weston, including full-frame close-ups that capture his somewhat soulful expression. The next year marked the beginning of an artistic style change for both Mather and Weston. There is no direct indication of who influenced whom, but photographer Imogen Cunningham, who knew both Weston and Mather well, said that in artistic matters, Mather was the teacher and Weston was the pupilJustema, 9 Both moved rather quickly away from the pictorial style and started to make more sharply focused photographs with bolder lines and angles. Her work from this period reflected a \\"daring, confident and sophisticated understanding of space\\"Jasud, 58 that few others working at the same time ever achieved. In 1923 Weston became infatuated with photographer Tina Modotti and decided to travel to Mexico with her. Before he left he took a series of nude studies of Mather in the sand dunes at Redondo Beach, California. These images that bear a close resemblance to his more famous nudes of his second wife Charis Wilson taken 13 years later. After Weston left, Mather immediately expanded her career with a new group of portraits of famous artists, musicians and writers, including Pablo Casals, Rebecca West, Eva Gauthier, Ramon Novarro, Konrad Bercovici, and Richard Buhlig. Her portraits were said to appear \\"deceptively simple, made with a great economy of detail‚Ä¶[but also with] great sensitivity and precision [that] cuts through to the essence of the subject.\\" Semi-nude [Billy Justema in a Kimono] by Mather (1923) It was during this same period that she became close friends with and repeatedly photographed the budding artist Billy Justema. Justema was nearly 20 years younger than Mather, and they formed a mutually beneficial and platonic relationship that lasted many years. Justema said that Mather \\"would nurture and shield me, thoroughly and unwittingly corrupt me, and‚Ä¶set up standards of ethical behavior and artistic excellence,\\" while Mather thrived on the new and changing circle of talented musicians and artists that Justema brought to her home. One of her most famous images, Semi-Nude, a strong horizontal image of Justema's abdomen and contorted hands wrapped loosely by a boldly patterned kimono, was made soon after the two met. This is the earliest example of a strong decorative element in Mather's work, and she would use this stylistic device repeatedly as she continued to develop for own artistic vision. Mather and Justema jointly applied for a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1928 for a proposal they called \\"The Expos√© of Form\\". In the application they described photographs they had been working on together, with Mather as the photographer and Justema the designer, that included images of hands, eggs, melons, waves, bathroom fixtures and seashells. Later Weston would also explore these same subjects. The application was not approved, and for the next two years Mather's interest in photography declined. In 1930 Justema moved to San Francisco and through his connections was able to secure a one- person exhibition for Mather at the M.H. De Young Memorial Museum. She mounted a collection of significant new photos for the exhibition, based on a theme of strong patterns made up of repeated combinations of common objects like combs, fans, shells, clocks and chains. One of her more provocative images from this series was a collection of glass eyes, laid out in a neat rows and each staring in a slightly different direction. When the exhibition opened, one reviewer referred to her (although erroneously) as \\"Margrethe Mather, San Francisco modernist.\\"Warren 2001, 36 After the exhibition Mather returned to Los Angeles and developed a long-lasting relationship with George Lipton, described as \\"a garrulous, hard-drinking man\\" she first met back in the early anarchist days. Lipton ran an antiques shop, and Mather worked part-time for him while pursuing her photography. Her health gradually declined over the next decade, and her interest in photography faded at the same time. In the early 1940s she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, an affliction that at that time was highly debilitating and degenerative. By then she and Lipton had developed a mutually caring relationship, although the true extent of it was never disclosed. Mather died on Christmas Day 1952.

The remains of Xinjiangovenator were found in the Lianmuqin Formation of Wuerho, Xinjiang, China, and were first described by Dong Zhiming in 1973. The genus is based on a single specimen, an articulated partial right lower leg, containing the tibia, three pieces of the fibula, the calcaneum and the astragalus. This specimen, IVPP V4024-2, is the holotype of the genus. The holotype was originally thought to be another specimen of Phaedrolosaurus. However, Phaedrolosaurus is based only on a non-diagnostic tooth, so the hindlimb bones were given their own genus by Oliver Rauhut and Xu Xing in 2005. The type species is Xinjiangovenator parvus. The generic name is derived from the autonomous region of Xinjiang and Latin venator, \\"hunter\\". The specific name parvus means \\"small\\" in Latin. The lower leg (tibia plus ankle bones) has a length of 312 millimeters (12.3 inches). Gregory S. Paul estimated in 2010 that Xinjiangovenator individuals had a length of 3 meters and a mass of 70 kg.Paul, G. S. (2010). The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs. Princeton University Press, p. 100. Rauhut & Xu (2005) established two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) that could be used to characterize Xinjiangovenator. First, the lateral condyle (outer ankle joint) at the lower end of the tibia extends further backwards than the outer edge of the portion of the tibia near the knee. Secondly, the proximal part of the fibula (near the knee) has a longitudinal groove along its front edge.  Classification  Rauhut & Xu (2005) originally placed Xinjiangovenator within the coelurosaur subgroup Maniraptora using a phylogenetic analysis. It was considered to be more closely related to paravians such as dromaeosaurids and birds, rather than oviraptorosaurians and therizinosaurs. This placement was justified by the presence of a tall and wide ascending process of the astragalus bone. In addition, the fibular condyle of the femur expanded backwards and the fibula tapered drastically towards the ankle. These characteristics were also found to be present in the coelurosaur Bagaraatan, and Rauhut & Xu (2005) suggested that Xinjiangovenator and Bagaraatan were sister taxa. The 2010 description of Zuolong by Jonah Choiniere, James M. Clark, Catherine Forster, & Xu Xing found a different position for Xinjiangovenator in their phylogenetic analysis. Due to its fragmentary nature, Xinjiangovenator was found to have an unstable position within Coelurosauria. Some, but not all, of the phylogenetic trees found Xinjiangovenator as the sister taxon to Ornitholestes based on the proximal part of the tibia being just as wide along its front edge as its rear edge. When Xinjiangovenator was removed from the analysis, Ornitholestes was found to be a basal maniraptoran.

This is similar to the nine-day series of dawn Masses leading to Christmas Eve practiced in Puerto Rico called Misa de Aguinaldo. The Simb√°ng Gabi Masses in the Philippines are held daily from December 16-24 and occur at different times ranging from as early as 03:00 to 05:00 PST. On the last day of the Simbang Gabi, which is Christmas Eve, the service is instead called Misa de Gallo (Spanish for \\"Rooster's Mass\\"). It has an important role in Philippine culture. History The Simbang Gabi originated in the early days of Spanish rule over the Philippines as a practical compromise for farmers, who began work before sunrise to avoid the noonday heat out in the fields. It began in 1669. Priests began to say Mass in the early mornings instead of the evening novenas more common in the rest of the Hispanic world. This cherished Christmas custom eventually became a distinct feature of Philippine culture and became a symbol of sharing. =Spanish Era agricultural practices= The Philippines is an agricultural country known for its rice, coconut and sugarcane plantations. Many tenant farmers (also known as sacadas, campesinos, and casamacs) toiled all day with one break during noon when the heat would be at its peak. Losing an hour due to the unbearable temperatures, farmers worked hard and budgeted their time out of fear of the local encargado, who administered land for the Spanish feudal lord or encomendero/hacendero. In between the planting and harvest seasons is a lull in the corv√©e forced on natives. Those who were old enough to provide manual labor were gathered under the tributo system where men would have to work for free for the Spanish colonial government's building projects. The women also had their share of work tending to their vegetable gardens (tumana) and as household staff for the elite. When the Christmas season would begin, it was customary to hold novenas in the evenings, but the priests saw that the people would attend despite the day's fatigue. As a compromise, the clergy began to say Masses in the early morning while it was still dark before people went out to work the land. Cuisine During the Spanish Era and early American Period, the parishioners would mostly have nothing to offer during Mass except sacks of rice, fruits and vegetables and fresh eggs. The Church would share the produce with the congregation after the service. After Mass, Filipinos buy and eat holiday delicacies sold in the churchyard for breakfast. Bibingka, (rice cakes cooked above and below) and puto bumbong (steamed purple rice pastries, seasoned with butter, grated coconut, and brown sugar) are popular, often paired with tsokolate (hot chocolate from local cacao) or salab√°t (ginger tea). Today, local delicacies are readily available in the church's premises for the parishioners. The iconic puto bumb√≥ng, bibingka, suman and other rice pastries are cooked on the spot. Lat√≠k and yema are sweets sold to children, while biscuits like urar√≥ (arrowroot), barquillos, lengua de gato and otap (ladyfingers) are also available. Kape Barako (a very strong coffee grown in the province of Batangas), hot tsokolate, or salabat are the main drinks, while soups such as arr√≥z caldo (rice and chicken porridge) and papait (goat bile stew from the Ilocos region) are also found. The rice-based foods were traditionally served to fill the stomachs of the farmers, since rice is a cheap and primary staple. The pastries were full of carbohydrates needed by colonial Filipinos for the work they undertook in the rice paddies and sugar mills. Current Practices The Mass usually begins at four o‚Äôclock in the morning.\\"Misa de Gallo.\\" Christmas in the Philippines. http://www.tourisminthephilippines.com/city/Tacloban/christmas-in-the- philippines/christmas-in-the-philippines-misa-de-gallo.html Retrieved 2 June 2013 Pope Sixtus V ordered that Mass be heard before sunrise since it was the harvest season,\\"Going to Mass at Christmas.\\" Filipinas Heritage Library. http://www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph/news/40-filipiniana/112-going-to-mass-at- christmas Retrieved 2 June 2013 and the farmers needed to be in the fields right after the celebration. White is the liturgical colour authorised solely for Masses celebrated within the context of the novena; violet is used for any other Masses said during the day, as these are still considered part of the Advent season. Filipinos celebrate this Mass with great solemnity and the Gloria is sung. Simbang Gabi is also celebrated in malls. Recently, however, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle discouraged the celebration of the Mass at malls, except when a mall has its own chapel. Evening celebrations of the Simb√°ng Gabi which begins at the 15th of December and ends on the 23rd, (erroneously described as \\"anticipated Simbang gabi\\" since Vigil or anticipated Masses are only applicable for Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation), are scheduled especially in urban areas. However, the propers and readings used for these Masses are those which are prescribed for the day. Although practiced in some parishes, \\"Anticipation\\" of the propers and readings prescribed for the next day is prohibited. A well-known folk belief among the Filipinos is that if a devotee completed all nine days of the Simb√°ng Gabi, a request made as part of the novena may be granted.\\"The Origin and Meaning of the Simbang Gabi Novena.\\" Catholic San Francisco. http://www.catholic-sf.org/news_select.php?id=59339 Retrieved 2 June 2013 Similar to the Spanish tradition of lighting small oil lamps on Christmas Eve, Filipinos adorn their homes with par√≥l, which are colourful star-shaped lantern. This is believed to have originally been used by worshippers to light their way to church in the early morning, as well as to symbolise the Star of Bethlehem. Par√≥ls continue to be popular yuletide decorations in the Philippines, as iconic and emblematic as Christmas trees are in the West. To give the faithful a chance to experience how the Simbang gabi was celebrated during Spanish times, groups which celebrate the Traditional Latin Mass also celebrate the Simbang gabi in candlelight and with locally composed centuries old music for the Mass. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-X0m0w5mVM See also * Christmas in the Philippines * Rorate Coeli  References  External links *Simbang Gabi at the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila Category:Catholic devotions Category:Christmas in the Philippines Category:Mass in the Catholic Church ","title":"Simbang Gabi"},{"id":"3597982","text":"Caulfield East is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 10 km south-east from Melbourne's central business district.

Early life Unger was born in London, England, to Lillian Maud and James Unger. Unger served in the British Army, was enrolled as a London bobby, and worked as an insurance clerk and a repo man before emigrating to Canada in 1968 at the suggestion of one of his sisters. In Mississauga, Ontario he began his career as a cartoonist at the Mississauga Times newspaper. In 1974, as Herman became popular, Unger moved from Mississauga to Ottawa, Ontario, bringing his parents and brother from Britain. Retirement and return Unger moved to the Bahamas in 1984 and retired as a cartoonist in 1992. Unger's friends encouraged him to give up retirement. He said he would not have suggested it himself, but he liked the idea. On 2 June 1997, Herman made a comeback under the United Media umbrella. \\"It gives me the opportunity to bring them up to date and to introduce Herman to a new generation,\\" he said in the 31 May 1997, edition of the Detroit News. He did not expect to return to full-time cartooning but planned to add new material.

Intraca uses the humour of popular cartoons and motivational quotes to inform and boost employees with \\"positive daily business messages\\" on their computers. Herman characters are also found on workplace posters promoting safety and improved production. Books In 1990, Herman became the first newspaper cartoon syndicated in East Germany. Shortly afterward, Unger produced a new book, Herman: Over the Wall. He joked, \\"Six months later the (Berlin) Wall came down; I think that's what did it.\\" Awards Unger received the National Cartoonists Society's Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award twice (1982, 1987). Death Unger died in his sleep at his residence in Saanich, British Columbia after a period of ill health. He was predeceased by his brother Bob, who was a major influence for the Herman comic.

History SM31 class had been designed for shunting heavy freight trains in large freight stations, works and harbours. The design was elaborated in Fablok in 1973, mainly on the basis of SM42 locomotive. Production of this series lasted between 1976 and 1981, as well as between 1983 and 1985. In this period PKP bought 167 items of this series machines. A total number of ca. 200 locomotives was produced, with the rest of them servicing Polish industry, chiefly mining. Also first two prototypes (SM31-001 and SM31-002) were sold to industrial works, and the last one locomotive for PKP was re-bought from the industry (SM31-170). As the main purpose of this series was shunting heavy freight trains, after its introduction PKP possessed shunters suited for all purposes. For extremely light trains mainly SM03 locomotives were used. Medium light trains were shunted by SM30 series, medium weight trains were left for SM42 engines. The last thing to be done was the introduction of heavy shunter able to work in severe climatic conditions, what did not happen before SM48 were brought to Poland. Today SM31 locomotives are mainly to be found on Upper Silesia railway tracks, pulling heavy freight trains from works to marshalling yards in ≈Åazy, Jaworzno, Szczakowa, Tarnowskie G√≥ry and Rybnik. Other engines are deployed at the stations of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Nowy SƒÖcz, Pozna≈Ñ, Szczecin and Wroc≈Çaw.  Technical data  SM31 is a Co-Co locomotive, what means it runs on two bogies, each equipped with three axles. Bogies are similar in construction to those used in SU45 and SU46 locomotives. This gives SM31 locomotive good performance on highland tracks. Being a typical shunter, SM31 has one crew compartment of the same height as machine and electric compartments. The engine (V8 compression- ignition engine) is in fact a developed version of SM42 locomotive engine, with its total power raised by ca. 50%. The engine propels main alternator, which gives power to six 196 kW traction motors.  Nicknames  Trumna (En.: Coffin) - from locomotive's angular shape.

Dawson was the site of two separate coal mining disasters in 1913 and 1923. Dawson is located about 17 miles northeast of Cimarron, New Mexico. Dawson was a coal mining company town founded in 1901 when rancher John Barkley Dawson sold his coal-rich land in northern New Mexico to the Dawson Fuel Company. The Dawson Railway was built connecting the town to Tucumcari, New Mexico. The mines were productive, and by 1905 the town boasted a population of nearly 2,000, later reaching around 9,000. History The Coke Ovens in Dawson, 1920 In 1906, the mines were purchased by the Phelps Dodge Corporation. The corporation needed to attract workers to the remote location, so they built homes for the miners, along with numerous other facilities including a hospital, department store, swimming pool, movie theater, and a golf course. With these amenities, Phelps Dodge was able to maintain a stable employment rate despite the inherent dangers of mining and the isolation of northern New Mexico. Many of the miners were recent immigrants. In total, the Dawson coal operations had ten mines, numbered 1 ‚Äì 10 in the immediate vicinity of Dawson. The mines are generally referred to as \\"Stag Canyon #\\", a reference to the operating company, but they are also often referred to as \\"Dawson Mine #\\", in reference to their locale. Different web pages which use GNIS data have the Dawson Mine No. 5 as being located eight miles north of the other mines. In looking at other source documents found in Google Books, this appears to be an error. The actual Dawson Mine No. 5 was located along the Vermejo River, near the town of Lauretta. Several of these mines were connected to the coal processing and loading facilities in Dawson by means of an electric powered narrow gauge (36 inch gauge) railroad. This railroad was apparently 6,600 feet in length, running along Rail Canyon from the entries of Mines 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. Mines 5 and 7 also connected to this line through underground connections to the other mines, but they also had their own tipples. Cars would be loaded inside the mines, taken outside and then transported in trains of cars to the facilities in Dawson proper. This line served the No 1 & 2 Tipple, located in Rail Canyon. Mines 8, 9 and 10 are located to the SW of the town of Dawson, and early research indicates that they had their own mine tipple for coal cleaning and loading into standard gauge railroad cars for delivery to customers. These three mines also had an electric powered railroad inside the mines which led to their own tipple, but they apparently were not connected to the other mines. The coal was cleaned of non-combustible debris and sorted into general sizes for different uses. In addition to the coal processing facilities, there also were coking ovens which processed the coal, transforming it into coke which was used for metal processing by Phelps Dodge at other facilities. The coking ovens produced carbon monoxide gas, which was captured and then burned to create steam for generating electricity for mine machinery and electric lighting, both in the mines and in the towns around the mines. The Dawson Railway was purchased by Phelps Dodge at the same time and made part of its El Paso and Southwestern Railroad system. The EP&SW; was later purchased by the Southern Pacific Railroad, which also purchased long term contracts for the coal production from Dawson. The SP used steam locomotives which were mostly fueled by oil, but the operating division located at Tucumcari utilized coal fueled steam engines, the only group of such locomotives on their roster. =Disasters= On October 22, 1913, Dawson suffered its first major disaster. Stag Canyon Mine No. 2 was shaken by an explosion that was felt two miles away in the town proper. Relief teams rushed in from surrounding communities and as far away as Pittsburg, Kansas, and Rock Springs, Wyoming, but of the 286 men who arrived to work in the Stag Canyon mine that morning, only 23 survived. One of survived miners was George Mavroidis, born in Crete. title=Georgios Maro√Ødis in the New York, Passenger and Crew Lists (including Castle Garden and Ellis Island), 1820-1957access-date=7 March 2020 He witnessed 16 men around him losing their lives before he himself lost consciousness. He woke up the next morning in the mine office. title=Buried Unsung: Louis Tikas and the Ludlow Massacre access-date=7 March 2020 Phelps Dodge sent a special train from El Paso, Texas, with doctors and nurses, but to no avail. Of the worker casualties, 146 were Italian and 36 were Greek. Two rescuers died during the rescue effort. It was later determined that the explosion was caused by a dynamite charge set off while the mine was in general operation, igniting coal dust in the mine. This was in violation of mining safety laws. The other mines remained productive after the disaster in Mine No. 2. Then, on February 8, 1923, Stag Canyon Mine No. 1 suffered an explosion. A mine car derailed, knocking down timbers and the electric trolley cable causing sparks, igniting coal dust in the mine. 123 men were killed in this explosion, many of them offspring of the men who died in 1913. =Shutdown= Dawson did not become a ghost town until 1950, when the Phelps Dodge Corporation shut down the mines. At closure, Mine 6 was the largest producer, and several other mines had been previously closed out because of declining demand. The closures were also due in large part to the completion of the twenty-five year coal contract with the Southern Pacific Railroad. The entire town was sold or razed, with some of the miners' houses moved to other locations. The Southern Pacific branch to Tucumcari was lifted at about the same time, but was later rebuilt by the Santa Fe Railroad, continuing up the canyon to the York Canyon mines. These mines were initially operated by Kaiser Steel, with their output being transported to their steel mill at Fontana, California. The York Canyon mine was operated by several different companies, finally closing in the early 2000s. Present day The town of Dawson is now largely gone, with only a few buildings remaining. The tall smoke stacks of the coking ovens were eventually demolished in the early 2000s because they represented a liability to the current owner of the property. The only significant landmark remaining in Dawson is the cemetery, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. The cemetery is filled with iron crosses painted white marking the graves of many miners who died in the mines. Other markers show the burial locations of other residents of Dawson. Dawson can be reached by taking Route 64 approximately 12 miles east of Cimarron and then heading north onto A38 at the striped sign and proceeding on that road for another 5 miles. After A38 crosses the adjacent railroad tracks a second time, turn onto the dirt road on the right (which proceeds east of A38 for approximately 1000 feet) to reach the site of the Dawson cemetery. The ruins of Dawson can be seen by continuing north on A38, which turns into Barus Road and then splits into Lauretta Road and Rail Canyon Road.

He left his wife and their child Marie-Luise and returned to the United States. He remained in contact with his wife at least until 1908. In 1912 (?) he married a second time (Evelyn Van Norman, from Canada). There is no evidence that he got divorced from his first wife. He was employed at Johns Hopkins (1892‚Äì94) and at Stanford (1894‚Äì98). He resided in New York after 1901. In 1907 he became staff lecturer at the Woman's Art School of Cooper Union. Columbia appointed him extensGeoorgeion lecturer on art in 1912. He wrote: The English Rising in 1450 (1892). He edited and translated Muther's History of Painting (two volumes, 1909) and revised Fergusson's History of Architecture (two volumes, 1910).

She served as a Labor Party Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1994 until 2003, representing the electorate of Parramatta. Harrison succeeded her first husband, Andrew Ziolkowski, who died in office. Private life Harrison is the daughter of Edwin Harrison and Faye Ware. Harrison's brother, Steve, was a union official and joint secretary of the Australian Workers' Union. Harrison has a sister, Jennifer. The death of her first husband came at a very difficult time for her and her brother, who also suffered the loss of their grandparents in the same week. Early years Harrison studied law at Macquarie University, in Sydney. At university she became heavily involved in student politics, and was chairman of the university Students' Union. It was at university that she met her future husband Ziolkowski, who was on the Students' Council and editor of the university newspaper, Arena. She joined the Labor Party in 1984, and was active in Young Labor. After university, she became secretary of the Parramatta branch of the ALP. She married Ziolkowski on 30 November 1985. New South Wales state politics In July 1993, Ziolkowski advised Leader of the Opposition, Bob Carr, that he had been diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer of the oesophagus. When her husband died in 1994, Harrison was endorsed by the Labor Party as candidate for a by-election for the seat of Parramatta. She was criticised by her opponent, Liberal candidate, Wendy Jones, for running for office instead of staying at home and looking after her son Tristan, then aged 7. Harrison won the 1994 Parramatta by-election without being forced to preferences, earning a swing of nine percent towards her party. Harrison was re-elected at the 1995, and 1999 elections. With strong interests in netball, running and fishing, Harrison was appointed Minister for Sport and Recreation in 1995. She lost her portfolio following the 1999 State election. During 2002, Harrison (along with NSW Speaker John Murray) was sued before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for A$800,000 by former staffer Anne Stonham, who claimed that her contract was \\"unfair\\" and she had been overworked. The court subsequently found in favour of Harrison. Another staffer, John Cairn, accused Harrison of keeping photographs of her enemies in a locket around her neck. In the lead-up to the 2003 State Election, it was reported that, :Right-wing party bosses want to replace former sports minister Gabrielle Harrison in Parramatta with Tanya Gadiel, a member of the staff of Police Minister Michael Costa. ..... Mrs Gadiel [does not] have the support to win local rank-and-file preselection ballots. Harrison conceded that she had lost support among her branch members and subsequently announced on 20 December 2002 that she would not be seeking re-endorsement as the Labor candidate in the 2003 State election. Gadiel was endorsed as Labor candidate for Parramatta in a bitter pre-selection. Post politics Harrison lives with her second husband Ron Bonham, her son Tristan, and Bonham's daughter. In late 2002, she told media that she was looking forward to a quiet life.

It is \\"the longest continually running major birth cohort study in the world and is one of the longest-running studies of human development. \\" History The 1946 birth cohort study (which became known later as National Survey of Health & Development) was set up by J. W. B. Douglas less than a year after the end of the second world war. The original promoters of this survey had been the Population Investigation Committee with help from the Royal College of Obstetricians and some funding from the Nuffield Foundation and the National Birthday Trust Fund. The survey began with interviews of 13 687 mothers who had given birth in the England, Wales and Scotland during a week in March 1946 (91% of births that week). Originally this survey was intended as a one-off project and was designed to answer questions such as;why had the national fertility rate in Britain been consistently dropping?; were the costs of giving birth a deterrent to having children?; and how well were the existing midwifery and obstetric medical services in Britain working? Unknown to the project initiators, this project coincided with the start of the post-World War II baby boom so the question of low fertility rates was not explored. The initial results showed enormous differences in birth outcomes between different classes in Britain - for example, the babies from mothers in the lowest social class were 70% more likely to be born dead than in the highest social class. The results from this survey influenced the decisions made when setting up the British National Health Service in 1948. The survey continued with a sample (which excluded illegitimate children and twins) of 5 362 of the children using regular follow-ups to explore the impact of a National Health Service on health and to explore differences in child development by factors like social class, health and education. As of 2016 it has continued and has itself developed into a study of ageing. The regularly updated information about this cohort also enables comparison with data from other longitudinal studies in Britain and elsewhere. The mission of the Unit is to realise the scientific potential of the NSHD as a world class, interdisciplinary life course study by: * Scientific discovery of life course influences on normal and healthy ageing * Transfer of knowledge to policymakers, health practitioners, and other research users * Promotion of healthy ageing The NSHD was formerly based at the London School of Economics (under the direction of Dr. James Douglas and at the University of Bristol), and then the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London (under the direction of Professor Michael Wadsworth). In 2016, the survey was operating under the MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing (which was established in 2008) and based in Bloomsbury, London, England, directed by Professor Diana Kuh. Members of the 1946 birth cohort held 65th and 70th birthday party celebrations in 2011 and 2016.

It is often described as a combination of the card games Speed and Solitaire.  Names  The game is of English origin and is recorded as Racing Demon as early as 1933 in the magazine Punch with accounts soon following in American publications from 1934 onwards under the name Pounce. Today proprietary Racing Demon cards are produced for it, consisting of ordinary 52-card Anglo-American pattern packs with different coloured backs. It had reached America by the 1960s, where it was also initially known as Racing Demon, but later became known as Nerts. The game also goes under many other names including: PeanutsNerts / Pounce / Racing Demon at www.pagat.com. Retrieve 27 Dec 2019. Pounce, Racing Canfield, Scramble, Squeal and Scrooge. The game's name can also be spelt Nertz. History Card game expert David Parlett says the game, originally called Racing Demon, was created in the 1890s, but is now known as Pounce internationally and Nerts in the US. The National Nertz Association (U.S.) blog says it is unaware of any known inventor or specific date of creation for the game, but that it has been around since the 1940s.NNA: Nertz History. Blogspot. 2010. If one were to attempt to play Nerts alone, one would essentially be playing Canfield, a variant of the classic Klondike Solitaire (also called Patience). For this reason Hoyle's Rules of Games describes Pounce as \\"Canfield played by two or more players\\".\\"Canfield\\" (p.198) in Hoyle's Rules of Games (3rd edition) by Philip D. Morehead (ed.), 2001. Description Nerts is a competitive form of Patience or Solitaire in which players or teams race to get rid of the cards in their \\"Nerts pile\\" by playing them in sequences from aces upwards, either into their personal area or in a communal central area. Each player or team uses their own deck of playing cards throughout the game. The number of players or teams that can play in a game is limited only by the number of decks and the amount of space available.  Pounce (1934)  The rules described by Breen for Pounce in 1934 may be summarised as follows: Each player has a shuffled pack of cards. The top thirteen are placed face up in front of the player as the 'pounce pile'. Then four cards are placed in a row face up beside it. Cards are taken, three at a time, from the remaining stock and used to build on any Aces in the middle or on the four cards in the row. Cards must be built in alternating colour and descending order. The first player to shed all his pounce pile wins by shouting \\"Pounce!\\" The winner scores 1 for every card in the middle of the table and 10 for pounce. The others score 1 for every card in the centre, but lose 2 for each card remaining in the pounce pile. Mechanics A game of Nerts is typically played as a series of hands. Between hands, scores are tallied and the cards are sorted and given back to the players or teams that played them. After the cards are returned, the decks are shuffled and set up for the next hand and the process is repeated until a player wins. During a hand, players do not take turns: instead, they play simultaneously, and may play cards onto one another's Lake cards. There are four areas that a player or team uses: the Lake, the River, the Stream, and the Nerts pile.Heart of the Matter Online NERTZ! A Fun Family Game, 2010. The Lake is the central area, used to score points, which any player or team may use by building suited piles in ascending order without doubles. The River is a 4-columned personal area that a player or team uses by cascading and/or playing cards from columns of alternating color and descending order (like the tableau piles in Solitaire). The Stream is a pile that is continually flipped (usually in groups of three cards at a time) in search of cards to play into the Lake or River. The Nerts pile is a 13-card pile that players try to get rid of cards from one at a time, from the top of the pile, into available Lake or River destinations. The first player or team to successfully get rid of their Nerts pile calls or shouts \\"Nerts\\". Once \\"Nerts\\" is called all play for that hand stops. In a hand, players or teams earn points determined by a formula using the number of cards played into the Lake subtracted by twice the number of cards remaining in the Nerts pile. Awarding 10-point bonuses to players or teams that call Nerts is a fairly common practice. Generally a game is played to a set score like 100 points, in which case players will play as many hands as needed until a winner emerges. Sometimes the endgame condition is when the difference between the highest score and the lowest score exceeds some value, such as 100. On occasion, players keep tallies of games won instead of adding hand scores and then use the tallies to determine a winner. It is also common for players or teams to receive negative hand and game scores. Organization = USA = In the USA the National Nertz Association website has published an \\"Official Nertz Rulebook\\". Pagat, the leading card game website, has also posted rules for the game of Nerts. Not every Nerts player plays by exactly the same rules, so when playing with others, one may notice some elements of this game such as the terms, game-play, scoring, set-up, shuffling and dealing procedure, and penalty procedure may be different. Commercial versions Nerts-inspired retail game sets include Ligretto, Dutch Blitz, Solitaire Frenzy, Wackee Six, Nay Jay! and Perpetual Commotion, sharing the same basic elements with some differences. All games have piles that players race to get rid of as the hand objective, and use more than 54 cards. They all have both communal and personal areas, all use the same-suit (or color), ascending builds for Lake piles and the alternating-suit (or color) builds for River Piles. They are all also played in real-time. =Electronic Nerts= The first known electronic Nerts game was Nertz! The Card Game by John Ronnander and Majicsoft for the Atari ST system and was released for purchase in 1995.NNA: Nertz Products of the Past. Blogspot. 2010. It was capable linking nine Atari systems for a large human multiplayer experience and also had an option in which two players could play on a single system. Since then many others have produced electronic Nerts-style games in an attempt to bring the Nerts experience to consoles, PCs, and mobile apps. The first Nerts game offered to PC's was eNerts released in 2000 by John Drake. One could purchase and download this game for the Windows OS from the eNerts website. eNerts offered users matches against AI opponents with adjustable difficulty settings. In 2007 Solitaire Showdown was added to the list of free games available to play on Windows Live Messenger (then MSN Messenger). To play this game one would challenge a friend from their messenger friend list to a heads-up match. In 2008, Games.com (or AOL Games) added a free online Nerts game called Solitaire Race to their list of games. In this game one could play up to four human or computer opponents. In the same year, two other Nerts PC games, available as software, were released which were Nertz Solitaire and Nerts High Speed Card Game. Nertz Solitaire was a game based on the NERTZ LLC decks using squirrel characters as opponents. This PC game only offered AI opponents and was available for download and purchase online only. Nerts High Speed Card Game was also available for download and purchase online only but this game offered both human and AI opponent capabilities.

Topography The main spine of the Central Fells runs south from Bleaberry Fell to High Raise, before turning sharply east en route for Blea Rigg and Loughrigg Fell. A secondary ridge projects southward from High Raise, terminating in the Langdale Pikes. These are a high rocky parapet looking down upon the valley of Great Langdale, fringing an area of moorland behind. This upland plateau has its highpoint in Thunacar Knott. Recent surveys give the fell a height of 723 metres (2,372 feet), a significant increase to the 2,351 feet given by Alfred Wainwright in his Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells. The fell is situated in Great Langdale in the midst of one of the most popular areas for walking in the district, surrounded by the much-loved Langdale fells of Harrison Stickle, Pike of Stickle, Loft Crag and Pavey Ark. Despite this, Thunacar Knott is often by-passed by walkers because of its uninspiring appearance, being just a slight rise on the moorland between Harrison Stickle and High Raise. Indeed, many people do not regard it as a separate fell, considering it just the outlying highest point of the spectacular Pavey Ark cliffs. Wainwright‚Äôs comments on the fell are not positive, saying: ‚ÄòThunacar Knott is completely unphotogenic‚Ä¶this uninspiring characteristic extends to the whole fell, which is quite deficient in interest.‚Äô Geology Drift deposits cover most of the fell, but in the summit area there are outcrops of the underlying Seathwaite Fell Formation. This consists of volcaniclastic sandstone with interbeds of tuff, lapilli-tuff and conglomerate.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 series maps: Sheet 38: BGS (1998) Ascents Many walkers feel compelled to climb Thunacar Knott in order to complete their list of ‚ÄòWainwright‚Äô fells and they usually do this while climbing the more popular neighbouring fells. The usual starting point is the New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel in Great Langdale and the route goes via Stickle Ghyll, Stickle Tarn and Pavey Ark. Thunacar Knott can also be climbed from Stonethwaite in Borrowdale, via Langstrath and the Stake Pass.Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): Summit The summit of the fell has a small tarn and two tops. The southern top is the highest point while the northern top has the more significant cairn and is often regarded as the true summit.

Professional career Isaac Curtis made the starting lineup as a rookie and had a superb season, recording 45 receptions for 843 yards, an average of 18.7 yards per catch, and nine touchdowns. . In Curtis' second season, he caught 30 passes for 630 yards (a 21.1 yard-per-catch average) and a career-best 10 touchdowns. Curtis' most productive season was in 1975, when he caught 44 passes for 934 yards for a league-leading and career-best 21.2 yard-per-catch average, along with scoring seven touchdowns.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/players/C/CurtIs00.htm He had another big year in 1976, with 41 receptions for 766 yards and six touchdowns, including a career-long 85-yard touchdown reception. In 1977, Curtis was limited by injury to 20 catches in eight games, but bounced back in 1978 with a career-best 47 receptions along with 737 yards and three touchdowns.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/players/C/CurtIs00.htm He continued to play a major part in the Bengals' passing games until his 11th and final NFL season, 1984, when he had 12 receptions. Curtis was a Pro Bowl selection four times (1973‚Äì1976) and was selected second team All-Pro for three consecutive seasons (1974‚Äì1976). Curtis helped lead the Bengals to a Super Bowl appearance in the 1981 season and had a solid performance in Super Bowl XVI, catching three passes for 42 yards. Years after his retirement, his quarterback Ken Anderson said that Isaac Curtis was \\"The Jerry Rice before Jerry Rice\\". In his 12 NFL seasons, Curtis totaled 416 receptions for 7,101 yards and 53 touchdowns, while also gaining 76 rushing yards on 25 carries. His 17.1 yards per catch average is a Bengals record and his 7,101 receiving yards was a franchise record until broken by Chad Johnson on September 16, 2007. His 53 touchdown receptions were a Bengals record until surpassed by Carl Pickens in the late 1990s. The Isaac Curtis rule \\"The Isaac Curtis rule\\" should not be confused with the \\"Mel Blount rule\\", which was a stricter revision of \\"The Isaac Curtis Rule\\". Because Isaac Curtis had world-class speed, there were not defensive backs who could keep up with him and all teams would double and sometimes even triple cover him. In 1973 in his first year, the Bengals won the Central Division and faced the eventual Super Bowl Champions, the Miami Dolphins. Don Shula's defensive backs did not have the speed to cover Curtis and Shula decided that he would have them push, bump, and hold him down the field. After that game, NFL defenses, including the Steelers, started doing the same thing to stop Curtis. Paul Brown wanted the rule changed, telling the NFL Competition Committee, \\"What good is it for us to have performers, if they aren't allowed to perform.\\" \\"The Isaac Curtis Rule\\" states that a defender is allowed to block a receiver within five yards of the line of scrimmage. After the initial yards, any contact will be considered holding, which is a five-yard penalty and an automatic first down. \\"He changed the game,\\" said former Bengals teammate and wide receiver Cris Collinsworth. \\"There's no question because no one could keep up with him. They put in the five-yard bump rules and all that crazy stuff that it all eventually became\\".http://www.bengals.com/news/article-1/Bengals-like-Ike-to-make-draft- call/2a40b4b3-af45-4269-bca0-d527c1e45f25 After football Curtis is a sales executive for Winegardner and Hammons, Inc., a hotel management company in the Cincinnati suburb of Blue Ash.

This method of detecting the mental limit in conditions such that it can be abandoned, results in a rethinking of classical and modern themes that opens up a wide range of philosophical fields. Principal among these are: (1) the act of being of the physical universe (metaphysics); (2) the quadruple con-causality (or essence) of the physical universe (philosophy of nature); (3) the act of being of the human person (transcendental anthropology); (4) the manifestation of the human person through her essence (anthropology of the human essence). In addition to this, his works cover a wide range of fields including psychology, neuroscience, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, social ethics, political economy and business theory. Throughout his more than forty books, Polo engaged with both Classical and Medieval thinkers such as Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and William of Ockham, as well as Modern and Contemporary philosophers such as Descartes, Kant, Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, and Nietzsche. In dialogue with the great thinkers of the history of philosophy, Polo sought to further the achievements of traditional philosophy as well as rectify and correct the project of Modern philosophy. Already during his lifetime, interest in his philosophy gave rise to numerous conferences and study workshops, including two international congresses; the publication of more than twenty books and 200 scholarly articles; dozens of doctoral dissertations; and two philosophical Journals dedicated specially to his thought. Life =Early life (1926‚Äì1949)= Leonardo Polo was born in Madrid, February 1, 1926. He attended elementary school at the French High School (Liceo franc√©s) of Madrid, and started his secondary education in Madrid, just as the Spanish Civil War was beginning in 1936. At this time, during the Spanish Civil War, his father held the position of Vice-mayor of the city. When the Republican government urged civilian to leave the capital city of Spain, Polo's family moved to Albacete, where he spent his first two years of secondary education. During the years 1936-1937, his father, a lawyer by profession, held the position of Chief Prosecutor for the city of Albacete. At the end of the Spanish Civil War, the family returned to Madrid, except for his father, who was forced into exile first to Nicaragua and then to Chile, where he died in 1946. Upon the return of his family to Madrid, Leonardo Polo continued his secondary education at the Cardinal Cisneros Institute. However, the change of the 1934 plan of studies for that of 1938 forced him to repeat the second year of studies that he had already done in Albacete. During this period, he read the book Fundamental Philosophy by the Spanish philosopher Jaime Balmes. He was fifteen years old at the time. The basic idea that he drew from this work was of the importance of the first principles, that these could not just be one, and that philosophy must be understood from the point of view of these first principles (in a doctoral course about the Logos in 1995, he would say, \\"philosophy is the knowledge of principles by principles\\"). The importance given to the first principles then led him to the Summa Theologiae of Thomas Aquinas, and more specifically Question 45, which presents creation as an accidental relation. This led Polo think that Thomas Aquinas could be corrected and expanded on this point, since if creation has to do with what is first, if it is extra nihilum, if created act of being is being insofar as being, then the relation with the Creator cannot be an accident, but rather a relation of principles. Polo would later make numerous references to Aquinas in his works, especially with regard to the real distinction between essence and act of being and the need to expand this distinction and apply it to the study of the human person in what Polo would eventually call a transcendental anthropology. At school he also read Ortega y Gasset, Aquinas, and Xavier Zubiri (including the first edition of Naturaleza, Historia y Dios published in 1942). In later years, Polo would also be able to attend lectures by Zubiri on the concept in Madrid and another by Ortega y Gasset on Toynbee. After secondary school in 1945 and obtaining an extraordinary prize in the State exam, Polo decided to study law. This decision was influenced by family events. At the end of the Spanish Civil War, his uncle, Agust√≠n Barrena, was left in charge of a law firm in which his father and his uncle Luis had once worked. A career in law offered him the opportunity of joining the firm with his uncle and to continue a family tradition, in spite of his own personal inclinations toward more theoretical subjects, and more concretely, toward he study of mathematics. Mathematics did not, however, seem to have much of a future in a country that had just come out of a civil war. For this reason, he studied law for four years. = Discovery of the mental limit and early philosophical studies (1952‚Äì1966)= In 1949, recently graduated, he started practicing law and, as he would later recount, he had to decide between making money by doing law (something which bored him) or to follow his inclinations toward theory and research. To his uncle's great disappointment, he chose the latter, and enrolled in doctoral courses of law. Of these courses, he remembers the one given by Garc√≠a Valdecasas, professor of civil law, with whom he held conversations about Hegel. Upon finishing his doctoral course work, Polo was faced with the choice of doing a doctoral dissertation, but also with the problem of how to make a living during those years dedicated to research. One possibility was to seek a teaching position; and he in fact prepared for a few professorial exams even though in the end he did not pursue them. The topic of research that interested him was the development of an existential interpretation of natural right. During this time his readings centered around Hegel's Philosophy of Right, Heidegger's Being and Time, Kant's Critique of the Practical Reason, Spinoza's Ethics, as well as a number of works by Aristotle and Leibniz. It was at this time that Polo began enrolling in classes of philosophy. It was spring of 1950 when Polo became aware the existence of what he calls the mental limit. He describes detecting this limit in these terms: :‚Äú‚Ä¶ it suddenly occurred to me, period. I was thinking about thinking and being, and about what being had to do with thinking; then I realized that we cannot arrive at being if one does not abandon the supposition of the object, because the supposition makes the object limited and a limited knowledge cannot be a knowledge of being if this is taken in the transcendental sense.‚Äù (from an interview to Prof. Dr. Juan Cruz in ‚ÄúAnuario Filos√≥fico‚Äù XXV/1 (1992), ¬ß 46. * https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181715/http://dspace.unav.es/handle/1721.1/687] You can read that interview here). In other words, to become aware of the mental limit of the need to abandon it is to notice that :\\"one cannot separate, I repeat, being from being, it is not possible to take hold of it objectively because in this way it is \\"des-realized\\"; but if being is not real, it is nothing. The intentional consideration of being is a quid pro quo. Being agrees with itself, but, being known intentionaliter is, as the Scholastics would say, an extrinsic denomination. When I know the idea, I do not in any way affect what I know, because the idea of what I know is in my mind as intelligible in act and in reality as intelligible in potency. The real distinction between essence and being makes the question all the more serious, because if being and essence were the same, then knowing something of the essence would be knowing something of being.\\" (from the same interview, ¬ß 47). Polo describes his discovering in this way: i) \\"A is A, supposes A\\", and ii) \\"Thought being does not think\\". According to the first proposition, there is no intellectual increase in the reality of A when we think it objectively. Mental objects are invariably supposed. Following the tradition that comes from Medieval Philosophy, suppositio is the fact that the significative reference is not indefinite. In this way, the reference of A stops, because what is in the realm of the mind is A as an object. \\"A\\" is \\"already\\" thought, \\"A\\" is already \\"given\\", \\"there is already\\" A, \\"what is immediately open to a mental act is an object\\". That is the supposition of A. One can think more, better, but according to a new mental act. You cannot increase the intellection of A with the same act you have already thought. That act stops in A. The act does not prosecutes to new objectivity, in other words, a mental act always refers to an object, in which it stops. According to this fact, says Polo, the Kantian constructivism of mental objects, and the hegelian dialectic method are misguided attempts. The second sentence \\"Thought being does not think\\" explains a different meaning of the mental limit. While mental activity and objectivity are different, they are inseparable. Without the first one, there is no possibility of the second one: there is no way of finding an idea that could think itself. The intentionality of mental acts always refers to objects where it is impossible to find the known existence. This formulation involves a criticism to the subject-object identity, and a rectification of Heidegger's existentialism. After two years of basic course work in philosophy, Polo received an opportunity to continue work in his research regarding the existential character of natural right with a research fellowship in Rome that he received from the Higher Council for Scientific Research (headed at that time by Alvaro D'Ors), which had just started a branch in Rome (the Spanish Juridical Institute in Rome). In Rome he had contact with eminent jurists like Del Vecchio and Capograssi. During these years in Rome (from the end of 1952 to September 1954), Leonardo Polo continued to develop the insight that he had received in 1950. A first phase of this involved the topic of his doctoral dissertation, \\"The existential character of Natural Right.\\" However, posing the topic of the existential character of law required resolving a series of more fundamental questions, many of which were related to the intuition of 1950 and which became a long introduction that eventually became a work in itself and which would lead to his research away from the juridical sciences and more toward philosophy. Polo spent these Roman years reading, thinking intensely, and, above all, writing. German philosophy, Kant and the German Romantics, as well as Hegel and Heidegger, whom he had already known in his younger years, were a major focus of his study during this time. A result of the activity in Rome is a large volume titled The Real Distinction, which he did not publish as such, but would later serve as a staging base for later publications. The formulations that Leonardo Polo had made with regard to his 1950 intuition became more consistent through the intellectual dialogue with the Idealist philosophers and with Heidegger's existentialism. For example, Polo's reading of Heidegger and of his concern for the \\"existent\\", his critic of idealism and his philosophical approach, would lead Polo to his characterization of the human persons as \\"being additionally\\" [adem√°s]. This being additionally, which according to Polo Heidegger did not see, expresses that the human person is not limited to her thinking, nor even to her acting, but rather is additionally to thinking and action. To be additionally is \\"to open oneself intimately to be always constantly overflowing\\" (La libertad, doctoral course, Pamplona, 1990, pro manuscripto). In 1954, Polo returned from Rome and began working at the recently founded University of Navarre, where he first taught Natural Law and then later (after the beginning of the School of Arts and Letters in 1956) Fundamentals of Philosophy and History of Philosophical Systems. At the same time, he continued his studies of philosophy at the Central University in Madrid as an external student, since his work teaching at Navarre prevented him from attending class. Technical issues forced Polo to transfer his studies to the University of Barcelona. Here he finished a short research work on Karl Marx's anthropology under the direction of Jorge P√©rez Ballestar. After receiving his degree from Barcelona in 1959, Polo transferred back to Madrid for the doctoral program and began work on his doctoral dissertation with Antonio Mill√°n-Puelles. In 1961, Polo obtained a doctoral degree after presenting his dissertation on Descartes. In this work, he presents Descartes as a voluntarist, something uncommon at the time for Spanish academic circles, who considered Descartes more as a rationalist. This dissertation was prepared for publication and appear under the title \\"Evidencia y realidad en Descartes\\" (Evidence and Reality in Descartes) in 1963. At this time, as preparation for his application for academic positions at universities, Polo prepared a series of publications base on the thick volume The Real Distinction, which he had written in Rome. Fruit of this work were El accesso al ser (The Access to Being) and El ser I (Being I), published in 1964 and 1966, respectively. =Years of silence (1966‚Äì1982)= Polo's first two books were, unfortunately, widely misunderstood in Spanish intellectual circles. Few were able to understand the complexity of the thematic and methodical dimensions of his proposal and its technical vocabulary. His assertion that freedom is a personal transcendental was also misunderstood. In doing so, some thought that Polo was a thinker on the Hegelian tradition. Of the four thematic areas which he thought had become available when overcoming our mental limits, Polo only wrote about the first (\\"Being I: Extramental Existence\\"). The original plan consisted of four parts: \\"Being II\\" would have studied the extramental essence (analysis of the persistence of extramental being in four predicamentales causes); \\"Being III\\" would have studied the being of human person, and \\"Being IV\\" would have dealt with the essence of man. Nevertheless, he remained silent for fifteen years and did not publish anything aside from a couple of papers. These are years of intense study and exchanges with colleagues. Polo taught at the University of Granada for two years (1966-1968). After that he moved back to the University of Navarra, where in 1972 he extensively revised Being III and Being IV, writing a new version of his Philosophical Anthropology, which also remained unpublished. From 1978 he started teaching in universities of South and Central America every year. Polo understood that for those countries education was a means of finding a way out of poverty, mainly because without division of labour, which is central to any modern society, education becomes impossible. Hence he promoted research and high standards in teaching in every university of South and Central America which he visited. Universities that he more frequently visited include Universidad Panamericana in Mexico, Universidad de Piura in Peru, and Universidad de la Sabana in Colombia. =Years of maturity (from 1982 to his death in 2013)= In 1982 Polo broke his silence in a paper called \\"The intellectual and the intelligible\\". There he makes explicit the Aristotelian roots of his proposal, highlighting the continuity of his philosophy with the Aristotelian tradition. He saw it as a \\"continuation of the study of knowledge just at the stage in which Aristotle left it\\". To that aim he set out to write his Theory of Knowledge in 5 volumes, the last two of which correspond to Being II. In 1999 and 2003 he published his third and definitive work on philosophical anthropology (the former Being III and IV from 1972, and the old \\"Real Distinction\\" from 1952 being the previous versions), which came to light under the title Transcendental Anthropology I (1999) and II (2003). These years of maturity have seen the publication of more than twenty books in a varied range of topics. Polo continued working in Pamplona (Spain) until his death in 2013. Different universities and institutions worldwide (like the \\"Institute of Philosophical Studies 'Leonardo Polo'\\" in M√°laga (Spain)) have organized meetings and symposia about his thought, and research is conducted and being spread to the present throughout books and articles which find their inspiration in his work. Works His most important works are: Evidencia y realidad en Descartes (Evidence and Reality in Descartes), published in 1963, El acceso al ser, (Access to Being), in 1964, El ser I: La existencia extramental (Being I: Extramental Existence), in 1966, Curso de Teor√≠a del Conocimiento, (Course of Theory of Knowledge), published in four volumes between 1984 and 1996), Hegel y el posthegelianismo (Hegel and Posthegelianism), in 1985, Antropolog√≠a Trascendental I: La persona humana (Transcendental Anthropology I: Human Person), in 1999 and Antropolog√≠a transcendental II: la esencia del hombre (Transcendental Anthropology II: Human Essence) in 2003. =El acceso al ser= This book expounds Polo's metaphysical method. Aristotle considered metaphysics the highest possible science because it deals with being, which is the ultimate constituent of everything. Modern metaphysicians, such as Descartes and Kant, understood that many of the pitfalls of metaphysics were caused by the lack of a rigorous method. Polo is sympathetic with Descartes and Kant about the need for such a method, but reflects that in metaphysics the method has to take us to grasp the being or existence of entities as such. If instead of that, our method leaves unresolved the question 'what is being?', its achievements will lead to perplexity. For Polo, such is the situation of Modern metaphysicians. When perplexed, the metaphysician finds himself in an awkward position, for he becomes blind to his own cognitive limits, and consequently has to put up with the suspicion that something in his system is missing without knowing exactly what. Polo's response to perplexity gravitates on the need to overcome such limits. His method consists in acknowledging such limits without denying them. To take thinking to its limit is the only way in which this can be detected and laid bare for scrutiny. Only in that way such limits will become apparent to the philosopher. The task of El acceso al ser is to illuminate the mind's cognitive limits for knowing in such a way that these can be effectively overcome. He calls this method 'the abandonment of mental limit'. With this a new and unsuspected perspective opens up. Being does not appear as perplexical as it might have appeared to philosophers like Hegel. The abandonment of the limit exposes the being of the universe as it is. This can be seen, on the one hand, as a kind of persistence; on the other, as a principle of continuity which provides the basis for the principle of non-contradiction. But looking at the universe one does not know why things are in the first place or why it exists. The reason is that the universe depends on a different principle called identity, and which is essentially God. Disconnect the world with that identity, and a large part of reality will lose its sense, for there is a third principle, the so-called transcendental causality which links up persistence and identity by placing the latter as creator of the former. In this way, Polo thinks that Access to Being brings metaphysics back in its right historical track. Some medievals, and particularly Aquinas, conceived being as a transcendental, non-reducible notion. This method looks to do justice to their views. =Curso de Teor√≠a del Conocimiento= This book is based on transcripts taken from the epistemology lectures which Polo delivered in the University of Navarra throughout the 80s, and that he corrected later on. The work contents are carefully distributed in four volumes, the last of which is divided in two parts. They are a much later and mature work in which Polo brings his discoveries in line with Aristotle's philosophy and systematises his views for the first time. Starting from perceptual knowledge, it discusses internal faculties such as imagination, the abstraction and the following steps to the highest cognitive level, which is rational knowledge. As part of his concern for the method, Polo formulates a number of axioms which specify what is a cognitive act. The first and most relevant of these is the 'axiom of the act', which establishes that knowledge is active, as a consequence of which knowledge is an intentional and perfect act. Knowledge secures that character over real and constitutive existing acts such as those constituting a planet or a tiny virus. Knowledge, following Aristotle, is energeia or perfect act which in itself does not consist in any kind of substance, nor fits into the categories of space and time, as all existing objects do (see Aristotle's theory of potentiality and actuality). Polo devises an epistemic difference between operations and habits of the mind. Habits are powerful cognitive acts which bring particular insights into real objects, whereas operations analyse and exploit the cognitive achievement of habits in successive stages as much as they can. As operations come to an end, only further habits can bring new light to them. In this way, the distinction between them grows bigger and more articulated the further the we progress beyond perceptual knowledge. Habits are a direct exercise of the abandonment of the limit. While we all use some of them in ordinary life, i.e. so to be able to speak, not every one makes use of the highest available habits, which according to Polo illuminate unprecedented problems of philosophy such as the nature of first principles as examined in El acceso al ser. Yet habits are sustained by a good many operations. The distinction between operations and habits runs across all cognitive faculties and helps to bring concepts, linguistic and numerical abilities and judgements into a new light, out of which we know, i.e. that after the first abstracted object the path of reasoning faces a junction: it can either 'generalise', to organise abstract objects into families, as we do in any classification of items into categories and subcategories, or it can follow a 'rational' path, exploring thus the promising connection between concepts and reality in order to make a judgement upon the universal or particular nature of a thing. Polo not only gives evidence of his views by discussing rival theories; he contrasts his views with that of Kant, Hegel and Heidegger. Kant's epistemology, while succeeding in systematising knowledge, presents perceptual knowledge as passive and so fails to comply with the requirements of axiom A, which asserts that knowledge is active. For Kant: :\\"perceptual knowledge is passive and yet the intellect is active. But if the intellect is active and perception is passive, the relation between both, if active, must be transitive. A transitive movement has suddenly crept into knowledge (...) as a kind of actio in passo, something which for Aristotle is paradigmatic of a physical action\\" (2nd ed. 1987, 70-1). Similarly, the second volume of Polo's epistemology discusses a good deal of the concept of abstract objects for Heidegger, whereas the last volume explores the philosophical basis of 20th century physics. =Transcendental Anthropology= Polo had expressed in private conversations that his voluminous Theory of Knowledge had shed much light into his method, but that his work would be incomplete if he were not to canvass the habits which yield knowledge of the human essence and its singular act of being. That is precisely the core of his Transcendental Anthropology (Antropolog√≠a Trascendental), a science he believes is a transcendental philosophy of man ‚Äì not taking 'transcendental' as synonym with a priori and opposed to 'empirical', as Kant would have taken it, but signifying the primacy of persons' being -. Polo believes that throughout the centuries philosophical anthropology has been trumped by metaphysics. Say that metaphysics concerns the study of the universe and that philosophical anthropology focus on man. If we take man to be a bare metaphysical being in the sense in which Aristotle, Aquinas and some other medieval philosophers considered and defined it as a 'rational substance', we will find extremely hard to explain free will. For the notion of substance is intrinsically tied up to metaphysical necessity, so that its substance can be characterised as being per se or needing not the input of any other to subsist. Of course that does not imply that the being of that substance is absolutely necessary, because no creature can cause itself to be. Human freedom, however, is incompatible with necessity. Modern philosophers understood it only too well when they asserted that man's essence consisted in spontaneity. This is certainly a feature of free will. In any choice, I may be bound by a limited number of alternatives on offer, but at the crucial point I am totally free to choose any of the alternatives regardless of my own inclinations. Freedom awaits us in any act of choice manifesting the radical openness of the will. For Polo, 'various distinctions must be settled in the first transcendental, that is, in the act of being (esse)' (I, p. 69). It is a mistake to call man 'free' once it has being called a 'substance', be it rational or not, for man is not a free-willed substance but a free-willed being. Thus, the distinction between the universe and man needs to be scaled up so as to work on a transcendental order. Human beings are different from comets, plants and animals not in external or accidental features, but at the level of what Aquinas would call actus essendi (act of being). For Polo, the difference between the universe and man is this: Man is a co-being which co-exists with other co-existences. Man is the being existentially open to other acts of being: it co-exists with the being of the universe, with other human persons and, most importantly, with God. In its openness to others lies the dual character of its being, which makes the existence of a lonely person a metaphysical absurdity. The ontological limits of a person do not have the sharper edges of other creatures‚Äô beings. We conceive degrees of perfection in instruments such as a boiler depending on a variety of reasons, i.e. on how it fulfils or achieves some desirable purpose for which the instrument was crafted. A similar thing can be said of animals, in what they add up to sustaining biological life. The human being is equally open to perfection, but that increase, which is equally ruled by some purpose, is inherent to its act of being. Inasmuch as human beings co-exist with other co-beings, and especially with God, free will can grow. Thus Polo conceives freedom not as sheer spontaneity, autonomous independence or lack of physical and psychological constraints, but in a new an unexpected sense: as being radically open to other beings. We may be tempted to think that a person‚Äôs relation with God is strictly causal, but that is only the case of the universe which in Access to Being was characterised as persistence. A person‚Äôs unique dependence on God is the root of her freedom and hence, of an inward openness built on self-knowledge and self-giving. The person‚Äôs call to openness is at the same time a call to be ontologically ever-more, that is, to be more human in accord with the moral, ethical, and practical implications of what is a 'good' person by nature, and which can only be found in an Aristotelian, non-utilitarian frame of objective values. Polo proposes that 'openness', 'freedom', 'intellection' and 'love' are \\"human transcendentals.\\" This means that there can only be a human being when these four properties are in place, although the number of these human transcendentals is not restricted to these four. What is important is that human transcendentals allow an anonymous being to co-exist and to be recognised among other co-existences like her. In this way, Polo overturns the classic doctrine of transcendentals, for which properties such as 'being', 'one', 'truth', 'good' and 'beauty' are universal and all-embracing, including human beings. But he argues that since persons are able to actively acquire those intrinsically static qualities and be intimately transformed by their achievement, human transcendentals substantially differ from the classic set of transcendentals.

According to these chronicles, he is the first recorded King of Sri Lanka. His reign is traditionally dated to 543‚Äì505 BCE. According to the legends, he and several hundred of his followers came to Lanka after being expelled from an Indian kingdom. In Lanka, they displaced the island's original inhabitants (Yakkhas), established a kingdom and became ancestors of the modern Sinhalese people.  Sources and variations of the legend  Broadly, there are four distinct versions of the legend that explains the origin of Sinhalese people. In all the versions, a prince comes to the island of Lanka, and establishes a community that gives rise to the Sinhalese race. The Mahavamsa and Dipavamsa name the prince as Vijaya, while the other two legends have different names for the prince. ; Mahavamsa version : In this version, Vijaya's grandmother is a princess, whose ancestry is traced to the Vanga and Kalinga kingdoms (present-day Bengal and Odisha). She bears two children with Sinha (\\"lion\\"), who keeps them in captivity in a forest. After the princess and her two children escape from the captivity, her son Sinhabahu kills Sinha. Prince Vijaya is the son of the lion-killer Sinhabahu, who is the founder of a new kingdom called Sinhapura. Vijaya becomes the prince-regent of Sinhapura, but is exiled with 700 of his followers to Lanka, because of his evil deeds. The Mahavamsa version of the legend contains a contradiction: it states that during an earlier visit to Lanka, the Buddha expelled all the Yakkhas (Yakshas) of Lanka to another island called Giridipa. However, it later states that Vijaya encountered Yakkhas when he landed in Lanka, and a Yakkhini (female Yakkha) named Kuveni became his queen. Kuveni helps Vijaya destroy the Yakkha city of Sirisavatthu, and has two children with him. However, Vijaya has to marry a Kshatriya princess to be a legitimate ruler. Therefore, he marries the daughter of a Pandu king, who also sends other women as brides for Vijaya's followers. Kuveni and her two children leave for the Yakkha city of Lankapura, where she is killed by the Yakkhas for betraying them. Vijaya dies without an heir. Panduvasudeva, the son of his twin brother Sumitta, arrives from India, and takes charge of Vijaya's kingdom. The community established by Vijaya gives rise to the Sinhalese race. ; Dipavamsa version : This version predates the Mahavamsa version. It is similar to the Mahavamsa version, but doesn't mention Kuveni (and other Yakkhas) or the South Indian princess. ; Xuanzang's account : In Xuanzang's account, the princess abducted by the Sinha (lion) comes from South India. There is no mention of Vanga, Kalinga or Lala. She and her two children escape from Sinha's captivity to their native kingdom in South India. Her son Chih-sse-tseu (\\"lion-catcher\\" i.e. Sinhabahu) later kills his father Sinha. He is given a reward, but also expelled and put on a ship, for the act of parricide. He lands on Ratnadeepa (Lanka, the \\"island of gems\\"), and settles there. He starts attacking naval merchants, who come to the island looking for gems. He captures the children of these merchants, and spares their lives, thus creating a community. Chih-sse-tseu himself has children (although their mother is not named), and his descendants divide people into classes, giving rise to the caste system. They also wage wars, expanding their territory. The community established by Chih-sse-tseu gives rise to the Sinhalese race. There is no mention of Yakkhas in this version. ;Valahassa Jataka version : This Jataka version is depicted in the Ajanta cave paintings of India (Simhala Avadana in Cave XVII). In this version, the prince who comes to the island is a merchant prince named Sinhala, who is the son of Sinha (\\"lion\\"). He and his 500 followers sail for the Ratnadeepa island, where they hope to find gems in the Sirisavatthu city. They get shipwrecked, but are saved by the Yakkhinis, who prey on the shipwrecked merchants. The Yakkhinis pretend to be the widows of the merchants who earlier visited the island. Sinhala marries the chief Yakkhini, but then discovers their true identity. He and 250 of his men escape from the island on a magical flying horse (Valahassa). The chief Yakkhini follows them to his paternal kingdom, and presents herself to his father Simha, as a woman wronged by the prince. Simha gives her shelter, but she devours him and the rest of his family, except the prince. She then returns to Ratnadeepa, where she devours the remaining 250 of Sinhala's followers. Sinhala succeeds his father as the king, and leads a military expedition to Ratnadeepa. He defeats the Yakkhinis, and establishes the kingdom of the Sinhalese. The Mahavamsa version, the most detailed of the above-mentioned versions, is described below.  Ancestry  The king of Vanga (historical Bengal region) married a princess (named Mayavati in some versions) of the neighbouring Kalinga (present-day Odisha). The couple had a daughter named Suppadevi, who was prophesied to copulate with the king of beasts. As an adult, Princess Suppadevi left Vanga to seek an independent life. She joined a caravan headed for Magadha, but it was attacked by Sinha (\\"lion\\") in a forest of the Lala (or Lada) region. The Mahavamsa mentions the \\"Sinha\\" as an animal, but some modern interpreters state that Sinha was the name of a beastly outlaw man living in the jungle. Lala is variously identified as the Rada / Rarh region of Bengal (a part of the present-day Indian state of West Bengal ) , or as Lata (a part of the present-day Gujarat). Suppadevi fled during the attack, but encountered Sinha again. Sinha was attracted to her, and she also caressed him, thinking of the prophecy. Sinha kept Suppadevi locked in a cave, and had two children with her: a son named Sinhabahu (or Sihabahu; \\"lion-armed\\") and a daughter named Sinhasivali (or Sihasivali). When the children grew up, Sinhabahu asked his mother why she and Sinha looked so different. After his mother told him about her royal ancestry, he decided to go to Vanga. One day, when Sinha had gone out, Sinhabahu escaped from the cave along with Suppadevi and Sinhasivali. The three reached a village, where they met a general of the Vanga Kingdom. The general happened to be a cousin of Suppadevi, and later married her. Meanwhile, Sinha started ravaging villages in an attempt to find his missing family. The King of Vanga announced a reward for anyone who could kill Sinha. Sinhabahu killed his own father to claim the reward. By the time Sinhabahu returned to the capital, the King of Vanga had died. Sinhabahu was made the new king, but he later handed over the kingship to his mother's husband, the general. He went back to his birthplace in Lala, and founded a city called Sinhapura (or Sihapura). He married his sister Sinhasivali, and the couple had 32 sons in form of 16 pairs of twins. Vijaya (\\"victor\\") was their eldest son, followed by his twin Sumitta. The location of Sinhapura is uncertain. It is variously identified with Singur, West Bengal ( a place situated within the Rada or Rarh region ) or Singhpur (near Jajpur) / Sinhapura, Odisha . Those who identify the Lala kingdom with present-day Gujarat place it in present-day Sihor. Yet another theory identifies it with the Singupuram village near Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh.  Arrival in Sri Lanka  A section of the mural from Ajanta Caves 17, depicts the \\"coming of Sinhala\\". Prince Vijaya is seen in both groups of elephants and riders. Prince Vijaya arrival place modern day view seascape (Tambapanni point) Vijaya was made the prince-regent by his father, but he and his band of followers became notorious for their violent deeds. After their repeated complaints failed to stop Vijaya's acts, the prominent citizens demanded that Vijaya be put to death. King Sinhabahu then decided to expel Vijaya and his 700 followers from the kingdom. The men's heads were half-shaved and they were put on a ship that was sent forth on the sea. The wives and children of these 700 men were also sent on separate ships. Vijaya had his followers landed at a place called Supparaka; the women landed at a place called Mahiladipaka, and the children landed at a place called Naggadipa. Vijaya's ship later reached Lanka, in the area known as Tambapanni, on the same day Gautama Buddha died in northern India. Those who believe that Vijaya set out from the west coast of India (i.e. Sinhapura was located in Gujarat) identify the present-day Sopara as the location of Supparaka. Those who believe that Sinhapura was located in Vanga-Kalinga region identify it with places located off the eastern coast of India. For example, S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar speculates that Supparaka might have been same as Sumatra. According to Mahavamsa, after reaching heaven, the Gautama Buddha requested the lord of gods (identified as Indra) to protect Vijaya in Lanka, so that Buddhism could flourish there. Indra handed over the guardianship of Lanka to the lotus-colored god (Upulvan), who came to Lanka in the guise of an ascetic to protect Vijaya. Wilhelm Geiger identifies the lotus-colored god with Vishnu; uppala being the blue lotus. Senarath Paranavithana identifies him with Varuna. Vijaya tied a protective (paritta) thread on the hands of all his followers. Later, a Yakkhini (a female Yaksha) appeared before Vijaya's followers in form of a dog. One of the followers thought that the presence of a dog indicated the existence of a habitation, and went chasing her. After following her for some time, he saw a Yakkhini named Kuveni (or Kuvanna), who was spinning thread. Kuveni tried to devour him, but Vijaya's magical thread protected him. Unable to kill him, Kuveni hurled the follower into a chasm. She did the same thing to all the 700 followers. Meanwhile, Vijaya came to Kuveni's place, looking for his men. Vijaya overpowered her, and forced her to free his men. Kuveni asked Vijaya to spare her life, and in return, swore loyalty to him. She brought, for Vijaya and his followers, food and goods from the ships of the traders whom she had devoured earlier. Vijaya took Kuveni as his consort.  Establishment of the Tambapanni kingdom  As Vijaya and Kuveni were sleeping, he woke up to sounds of music and singing. Kuveni informed him that the island was home to Yakkhas, who would kill her for giving shelter to Vijaya's men. She explained that the noise was because of wedding festivities in the Yakkha city of Sirisavatthu. With Kuveni's help, Vijaya defeated the Yakkhas. Vijaya and Kuveni had two children: Jivahatta and Disala. Vijaya established a kingdom, which was named Tambapanni (\\"copper-red hands\\"), because the men's hands were reddened by the red soil of the area. The members of the community established by Vijaya were called Sinhala after Sinhabahu. Vijaya's ministers and other followers established several new villages. For example, Upatissa established Upatissagama on the bank of Gambhira river, north of Anuradhagama. His followers decided to formally consecrate him as a king, but for this he needed a queen of Aryan (noble) descent. Vijaya's ministers, therefore, sent emissaries with precious gifts to the city of Madhura, which was ruled by a Pandu king. (Madhura is identified with Madurai, a city in South India; Pandu is identified with the Pandyas). The king agreed to send his daughter as Vijaya's bride. He also requested other families to offer their daughters as brides for Vijaya's followers. Several families volunteered, and were adequately compensated by king with gifts. The Pandu king sent to Lanka his own daughter, other women (including a hundred maidens of noble descent), craftsmen, a thousand families of 18 guilds, elephants, horses, waggons, and other gifts. This group landed in Lanka, at a port known as Mahatittha. Vijaya then requested Kuveni, his Yakkhini queen, to leave the community, saying that his citizens feared supernatural beings like her. He offered her money, and asked her to leave their two children behind. But Kuveni took the children along with her to the Yakkha city of Lankapura. She asked her children to stay back, as she entered the city, where other Yakkhas recognized her as a traitor. She was suspected of being a spy, and killed by a Yakkha. On advice of her maternal uncle, the children fled to Sumanakuta (identified with Adam's Peak). In the Malaya region of Lanka, they became husband-wife and gave rise to the Pulinda race (identified with the Vedda people; not to be confused with the Pulindas of India). Meanwhile, Vijaya was consecrated as the king. The Pandu king's daughter became his queen, and other women were married to his followers according to their rank. He bestowed gifts on his ministers and his father-in- law. He gave up his evil ways, and ruled Lanka in peace and righteousness.  Last days  Vijaya had no other children after Kuveni's departure. When he grew old, he became concerned that he would die heirless. So, he decided to bring his twin brother Sumitta from India, to govern his kingdom. He sent a letter to Sumitta, but by the time he could get a reply, he died. His ministers from Upatissagama then governed the kingdom for a year, while awaiting a reply. Meanwhile, in Sinhapura, Sumitta had become the king, and had three sons. His queen was a daughter of the king of Madda (possibly Madra). When Vijaya's messengers arrived, he was himself very old. So, he requested one of his sons to depart for Lanka. His youngest son, Panduvasdeva, volunteered to go. Panduvasdeva and 32 sons of Sumitta's ministers reached Lanka, where Panduvasdeva became the new ruler. Significance Within Sri Lanka, the legend of Vijaya is a common political rhetoric used to explain the origin of the Sinhalese, and is often treated as a factual account of historical events. Sinhalese scholars such as K. M. de Silva have used the legend to propose an Indo-Aryan origin for the Sinhalese, thus distinguishing them from the Dravidian Tamils. At the same time, some Sinhalese authors have also used the myth to oppose Tamil secessionism, arguing that the Sinhalese and the Tamils are one race, because their ancestors included the maidens sent by the Pandyan king of Madurai. Some Tamil nationalists, on the other hand, have claimed that their ancestors were the Yakkhas massacred by Vijaya. Tamil authors like Satchi Ponnambalam have dismissed the legend as fiction aimed at justifying Sinhalese territorial claims in Lanka. The various genetic studies on Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamils have offered differing conclusions. R.L. Kirk (1976), for example, concluded that the Sinhalese are genetically closest to the East Indian population of Bengal. N. Saha (1988), however, disagreed with Kirk's findings and concluded that the Sinhalese display a close genetic affinity with the Tamils.

In defense against Ottoman Empire expansion, he lost most of his personal holdings. He was the last male descendant of the Kurjakoviƒá family from the noble tribe of Gusiƒá, and after his death the estates went to Nikola III Zrinski who married his sister Jelena Kurjakoviƒá. Karloviƒá is positively remembered in the Croatian folk poetry.  Early life  Ivan was born c. 1485 in Udbina, as the son of Karlo Kurjakoviƒá, and Dorothea Frankopan. After his father's death in 1493, he inherited vast estates of the family, including ≈æupanijas Krbava, Odorje, Hotuƒça, Lapac, part of Lika and several fortified cities in near ≈æupanijas, as well the title of the Count of Krbava. During his lifetime, in a similar fashion to other Croatian and European noblemen, had an anachronistic tendency to trace his family ancestry to Roman patricians, in his case to Titus Manlius Imperiosus Torquatus, a thesis which was also wrongly argued by Mikl√≥s Istv√°nffy and Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá, and hence he and his sister Klara named themselves as \\"Torkvat\\".  History  At the time his estates were on the first front of the Ottoman Empire conquest. In the fighting he tried to rely on the help of Hungarian-Croatian King, the House of Habsburg, Republic of Venice or even agreements of paying tribute with the Ottomans in 1506 and 1511. In 1500, defeated Ottoman army near Gradac (today Graƒçac). In the Hungarian succession crisis, he supported Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor against Hungarian- Croatian King Vladislaus II of Hungary in 1506. Between 1505 and 1509 he owned town Mutnik and market town Belaj (today village Bilaj near Gospiƒá). In 1508, temporary fought against Maximilian I's army in the hinterland of Venice, when on return successfully defended Mutnik from Croatian noblemen, and was possibly helped by the Ottoman forces. Between 1509 and 1524, made several Condottieri contracts with Venice to defend the Republic's estates in Dalmatia. In 1510, refused to be one the military commanders in a campaign to free Dalmatia from Venetian authority, but due to lack of finances the war did not happen. In 1513, as Vice-Ban and Captain of Croatia and Dalmatia (1512‚Äì1513), with Petar Berislaviƒá, then Ban of Croatia, and other noblemen defeated the Ottomans at the Battle of Dubica. However, in 1514 the Ottomans raided his estates in Krbava and Lika, as well fought against in Bosnia. In 1517, as the situation was becoming more desperate, tried to replace his estates with forts in Lombardia under Venetian authority, and once again in the mid-1520s, but it was rejected with only a promise of financial help. In 1519, Stjepan Posedarski, a humanist, chaplain and envoy of Karloviƒá from the Posedarski branch of the Gusiƒá tribe, in the name of Karloviƒá delivered anti- Ottoman speech Oratio Stephani Possedarski habita apud Leonem decimum pontificem maximum pro domino Ioanne Torquato comite Corbauie defensore Crouacie to Pope Leo X. In it, Karloviƒá was represented as a true defender of his and other lands, in the name of faith, freedom, and survival, who is losing faith defending the Holy Church and asking for help. The speech was noted in the West but had little success. Cetin Charter (1527), with the second seal from left belonging to Karloviƒá. In 1521, in the name of a group of Croatian nobility unsuccessfully negotiated with the Ottomans. In the same year was named as Ban of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia, and trying to organize a defense against the Ottomans decided to only engage in field battles as could not get support for the defense of royal towns, and as such could not prevent Siege of Knin, fall of Skradin and Ostrovica Fortress. He regularly received military and financial help from Archduke Ferdinand I, but most importantly did not by Hungarian-Croatian King Louis II. As he steadily impoverished fighting and noblemen did not accept to increase revenue with new taxes in 1523, he renounced from the position of Ban in 1524. In December 1526, he attended Croatian Election in Cetin along with several other most important Croatian noble magnates, where on 1 January 1527 signed a charter with which was elected Ferdinand I from the House of Habsburg as the King of Croatia, regarding them as the only house which could help against the Ottoman invasion. The election was part of a succession crisis and civil war as lower nobility in Hungary and Slavonia supported John Z√°polya, but Karloviƒá mostly stayed neutral during the war, and after the death of Christoph Frankopan, contributed to reconciliation between conflicting sides in 1530. In 1527, along Ferenc Batthy√°ny, was again named as Ban of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia, on which position remained until his death in 1531. As the Ottomans conquered his forts Obrovac, Udbina, Komiƒá, and Mrsinj-grad, from Ferdinand I received estates of Medvedgrad, Lukavec and Rakovec in Turopolje. In 1528, near Belaj commanded a Croatian army with some Carniolan forces which defeated several thousand Ottomans who were preparing to raid into Carniola. In the next year led the Croatian forces to help at Siege of Vienna (1529).  Death  Ivan Karloviƒá died on 9 August 1531, in Medvedgrad. He was buried in the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Remete, Zagreb, Croatia. As he did not have any descendants in marriage with the niece of cardinal Tam√°s Bak√≥cz, according to the inheritance contract with Nikola III Zrinski from 1509, who married his sister Jelena Kurjakoviƒá, the estates were inherited by Zrinski family. At the time, Karloviƒá had 22 forts and cities in three ≈æupanijas and two ≈æupas, of which most prominent were Udbina, Krbava, Kurjak-grad, Turan, Poƒçitelj, Podlapƒçec (Podlapac), Mrsinj-grad, Lovinac, Gradac (Graƒçac), Novigrad, Zvonigrad, Zelengrad, Kliƒçevac (Kliƒçevica), Bag, Obrovac and Stari Obrovac. His sister Jelena was the mother of the future Ban of Croatia and hero of the Siege of Szigetv√°r (1566), Nikola IV Zrinski. Karloviƒá nephews Nikola and Ivan Zrinski in 1541 took care to carve the inscription on the tombstone, saying \\"Sepultus genere Spectabilis militiaque praeditus magnificus dominus Torquatus, comes Corbaviae regnorumque Croatiae et Sclavoniae banus mole sub hac tegitur\\", however the inscription with the coat of arms got lost over the centuries. In a 16th century Glagolithic document his seal and coats of arms were described to have a goose on a shield, above them letters I. C., meaning Joannes Caroli. In 1736, Hungarian polymath Samuel Timon described the alleged coat of arms on the tombstone, and according to it in 1802 K√°roly Wagner described the color, but they were inspired by 17th-century armorials like Opus Insignium Armorumque (1687‚Äì1688) by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor.  Legacy  In the folk tradition, the fortified towns in ruin like Komiƒá, Kozja Draga, and Mazin are still called as Karloviƒáa dvori (\\"Karloviƒá's palaces\\"). Karloviƒá is the main character of the novel Ivan Hrvaƒáanin (1926) by Fran Biniƒçki. = Folk poetry = Karloviƒá is also remembered in the folk poetry including bugar≈°tica (for example Kad se Ivan Karloviƒá vjerio za kƒáer kralja Budimskoga), and of the Molise Croats in Southern Italy, Burgenland Croats in Austria, and Bosniaks, probably the descendants of his former subjects. He is mentioned as Ivan or Jivan Karloviƒá, Ive Karloviƒáev, Ivan Dovice, did Karloviƒá, Karlo Viƒáa, and Ivan Hrvaƒáanin. In Molise are preserved several fragmented variations of an old song in Shtokavian-Chakavian with Ikavian accent, while longer variation can be found in Chakavian with Ekavian-Ikavian accent. He is generally featured as a noble and good master, tireless warrior against the Ottomans. On the other hand, in Molise has a negative connotation, depicted as being feared by girls picking flowers in a meadow. The story about girls being feared of intercourse with heroes is a common folk theme where heroes identity is less significant as the songs were preserved and performed in wedding customs. There his true identity was forgotten and possibly was related to the fear and danger during the Ottomans conquest, but his mention is indicative for the date of migration and ethnic identity of the community in Molise.

He was a member of the Portland Spy Ring. Early life Houghton was born in Lincoln, England. He left school at 14 to become an errand boy and later joined the Royal Navy. By the end of World War II, he was a master-at-arms (chief petty officer). After the war, he joined the civil service and in 1951 was attached to the staff of the naval attach√© of the British embassy in Warsaw, Poland. Houghton dabbled in the black market, starting with coffee and moving on to medical drugs (in his memoirs, Houghton admits to the former but denies the latter). That made him money and acquaintances but also led him to heavy drinking and the attention of the Polish Secret Police. Houghton's wife complained of domestic abuse, and there were concerns that he was mixing with the wrong people. In 1952, he was ordered home. Houghton and his wife separated in 1956 and later divorced. Spying career Meanwhile, he had become involved around 1955 with Ethel Gee, known as \\"Bunty\\", a filing clerk who also worked at the base. Houghton had his access to secret papers restricted around 1956 as he had taken secret papers out of the strong-room without the consent of his superiors. By this time, Houghton was passing secrets to Polish spies, who sent them to the Soviets. He was appointed to the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment at Portland, where the Royal Navy would test equipment for undersea warfare. He persuaded Gee, apparently telling her of his connection to the Russians to assist him in gaining access to documents for which he did not have clearance. Gee passed them to Houghton, and he would photograph them. On the first Saturday of each month, Houghton would go to London, sometimes with Gee, and exchange packages with a contact who they knew as Gordon Lonsdale, in reality Konon Molody, a KGB agent. Houghton's drinking did not stop, and he was living far beyond his salary, which brought him under suspicion. MI5 placed him under surveillance and found other members of what was to be called the Portland Spy Ring. In his book Spycatcher, Peter Wright claimed that Houghton first came to MI5's attention when a Polish mole, codenamed Sniper, reported he had information about a Russian spy in the British Navy. According to Wright, Sniper did not know the name of the spy but said that it sounded like Huiton. Sniper also obtained documents that had been sent by the spy, helping MI5 to determine who had access to the documents. The information from Sniper said the spy had been sent home from Warsaw for drunkenness, pointing to Houghton. Houghton and Gee were arrested with Lonsdale (his real identity was not yet known) by Special Branch officers on 7 January 1961 near the Old Vic theatre. The other members, Morris and Lona Cohen (whose cover names were Peter and Helen Kroger) were also arrested. All of whom were spies for the Soviets. Houghton claimed at his trial that he had been blackmailed by the Poles and the Russians into spying for them. In Poland, he had had an affair with a female black marketeer and was told that she would go to prison if he did not provide secrets. Threats were also made against Gee and his former wife, and he claimed that he was twice attacked by thugs. Houghton claimed that the information that he gave was newspaper cuttings and matters that were already in the public domain. Later life On 22 March 1961, Houghton and Gee were both sentenced to fifteen years in prison. They were released early on 12 May 1970, and they married in 1971. Around this period, Houghton wrote Operation Portland: The Autobiography of a Spy, which was published in 1972 by Hart-Davis. Houghton died in obscurity in Poole, Dorset in 1985, a year after Ethel. He left an estate valued for probate at ¬£114,071 (equivalent to ¬£ in ).  In popular culture  A representation of Houghton and the Portland spy case was filmed in 1964, under the title Ring of Spies starring Bernard Lee as Houghton. The film used many of the actual locations of the case.

In 2008, there were approximately 5,800 assistant United States attorneys employed by the United States Government. Although many are \\"prosecutors\\", not all assistant U.S. attorneys work in Criminal Divisions, and may work in Civil, Appellate, or other divisions. they earned a starting base salary of $55,204, adjusted significantly for local cost of living. Assistant United States attorneys working in a criminal division generally handle large case loads; however, as most federal prosecutions end in plea bargains, they will typically try only two and six cases annually. Special Assistant United States Attorney Federal law authorizes the Attorney General to appoint Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys, known as SAUSAs, \\"to assist United States attorneys when the public interest so requires.\\" In addition to designating non- federal employees, the SAUSA designation is also given to prosecutors who are employed by another agency, such as the Social Security Administration, United States Postal Service, or Federal Bureau of Investigations, but work alongside AUSAs because of their expertise. They are paid by that agency and seconded to the United States Attorneys Office for a set period of time. This designation may also be given to an AUSA who is seconded to a different district or from Main Justice to a specific office. Appointing local prosecutors or enforcement attorneys to assist in a joint investigation and prosecution has been criticized for having the potential for conflicts of interest, selective and vindictive prosecution, as well as dual and successive prosecution.

It is distinct from the king cobra which belongs to the monotypic genus Ophiophagus. The Indian cobra is revered in Indian mythology and culture, and is often seen with snake charmers. It is now protected in India under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972). Taxonomy The generic name and the specific epithet naja is a Latinisation of the Sanskrit word ' () meaning \\"cobra\\". The Indian cobra is classified under the genus Naja of the family Elapidae. The genus was first described by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768. The species Naja naja was first described by the Swedish physician, zoologist, and botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The genus Naja was split into several subgenera based on various factors, including morphology, diet, and habitat. Naja naja is part of the subgenus Naja, along with all the other species of Asiatic cobras, including Naja kaouthia, Naja siamensis, Naja sputatrix, and the rest. Naja naja is considered to be the prototypical cobra species within the subgenus Naja, and within the entire genus Naja. All Asiatic species of Naja were considered conspecific with Naja naja until the 1990s, often as subspecies thereof. Many of the subspecies were later found to be artificial or composites. This causes much potential confusion when interpreting older literature. The Indian cobra or spectacled cobra, being common in South Asia, is referred to by a number of local names deriving from the root of Nag (‡§®‡§æ‡§ó) (Hindi, Marathi) (‡™®‡™æ‡™ó)(Gujarati), Moorkhan, ‡¥Æ‡µÇ‡¥∞‡µç‚Äç‡¥ñ‡¥®‡µç‚Äç (Malayalam), Naya-‡∂±‡∂∫‡∑è (Sinhalese), ‡∞®‡∞æ‡∞ó‡±Å ‡∞™‡∞æ‡∞Æ‡±Å (Nagu Paamu) (Telugu), ‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤ó‡≤∞ ‡≤π‡≤æ‡≤µ‡≥Å Nagara Haavu (Kannada), Nalla pambu (‡Æ®‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤ ‡Æ™‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ) (Tamil) \\"Phetigom\\" (Assamese) and Gokhra (‡¶ó‡ßã‡¶ñ‡¶∞‡ßã) (Bengali).\\"‡¨ó‡≠ã‡¨ñ‡¨∞ ‡¨∏‡¨æ‡¨™/‡¨®‡¨æ‡¨ó ‡¨∏‡¨æ‡¨™\\" in (Odia) Description Spectacle pattern on a cobra's hood False eyes of the binocellate cobra Albino Naja naja The Indian cobra varies tremendously in colour and pattern throughout its range. The ventral scales or the underside colouration of this species can be grey, yellow, tan, brown, reddish or black. Dorsal scales of the Indian cobra may have a hood mark or colour patterns. The most common visible pattern is a posteriorly convex light band at the level of the 20th to 25th ventrals. Salt- and-pepper speckles, especially in adult specimens, are seen on the dorsal scales. Specimens, particularly those found in Sri Lanka, may exhibit poorly defined banding on the dorsum. Ontogenetic colour change is frequently observed in specimens in the northwestern parts of their geographic range (southern Pakistan and northwestern India). In southern Pakistan, juvenile specimens may be grey in colour and may or may not have a hood mark. Adults on the other hand are typically uniformly black in colour on top (melanistic), while the underside, outside the throat region, is usually light. Patterns on the throat and ventral scales are also variable in this species. The majority of specimens exhibit a light throat area followed by dark banding, which can be 4‚Äì7 ventral scales wide. Adult specimens also often exhibit a significant amount of mottling on the throat and on the venter, which makes patterns on this species less clear relative to patterns seen in other species of cobra. With the exception of specimens from the northwest, there is often a pair of lateral spots on the throat where the ventral and dorsal scales meet. The positioning of these spots varies, with northwestern specimens having the spots positioned more anterior, while specimens from elsewhere in their range are more posterior. Many specimens exhibit a hood mark. This hood mark is located at the rear of the Indian cobra's hood. When the hood mark is present, are two circular ocelli patterns connected by a curved line, evoking the image of spectacles. The Indian cobra is a moderately sized, heavy bodied species. This cobra species can easily be identified by its relatively large and quite impressive hood, which it expands when threatened. This species has a head which is elliptical, depressed, and very slightly distinct from the neck. The snout is short and rounded with large nostrils. The eyes are medium in size and the pupils are round. The majority of adult specimens range from in length. Some specimens, particularly those from Sri Lanka, may grow to lengths of , but this is relatively uncommon. Indian spectacled cobra (Naja naja) A 6.5\\" ft cobra captured in a village near Patnagarh, Odisha, India =Scalation= Dorsal scales are smooth and strongly oblique. Midbody scales are in 23 rows (21‚Äì25), with 171‚Äì197 ventrals. There are 48‚Äì75 divided subcaudals and the anal shield is single. There are seven upper labials (3rd the largest and in contact with nasal anteriorly, 3rd and 4th in contact with eye) and 9-10 lower labials (small angular cuneate scale present between 4th and 5th lower labial), as well as one preocular in contact with internasals, and three postoculars. Temporals are 2 + 3. =Similar species= The Oriental rat snake Ptyas mucosus is often mistaken for the Indian cobra; however, this snake is much longer and can easily be distinguished by the more prominent ridged appearance of its body. Other snakes that resemble Naja naja are the banded racer Argyrogena fasciolata and the Indian smooth snake Coronella brachyura. Also, the monocled cobra (Naja kaouthia) may be confused with Naja naja; however, the monocled cobra has an \\"O\\"-shaped pattern on the back of the hood, while the Indian cobra has a spectacles-shaped pattern on its hood. Distribution and habitat Indian cobra in its habitat Silent film showing an African chamaeleon and an Indian cobra by Raymond L. Ditmars (?) Collection EYE Film Institute Netherlands. The Indian cobra is native to the Indian subcontinent and can be found throughout India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and southern Nepal. In India, it may or may not occur in the state of Assam, some parts of Kashmir, and it does not occur in high altitudes of over and in extreme desert regions. In Pakistan, it is absent in most of Balochistan province, parts of North-West Frontier Province, desert areas elsewhere and the Northern Areas. The most westerly record comes from Duki, Balochistan in Pakistan, while the most easterly record is from the Tangail District in Bangladesh. As this species has been observed in Drosh, in the Chitral Valley, it may also occur in the Kabul River Valley in extreme eastern Afghanistan. There's been at least one report of this species occurring in Bhutan. The Indian cobra inhabits a wide range of habitats throughout its geographical range. It can be found in dense or open forests, plains, agricultural lands (rice paddy fields, wheat crops), rocky terrain, wetlands, and it can even be found in heavily populated urban areas, such as villages and city outskirts, ranging from sea level to in altitude. This species is absent from true desert regions. The Indian cobra is often found in the vicinity of water. Preferred hiding locations are holes in embankments, tree hollows, termite mounds, rock piles and small mammal dens. Reproduction Indian cobras are oviparous and lay their eggs between the months of April and July. The female snake usually lays between 10 and 30 eggs in rat holes or termite mounds and the eggs hatch 48 to 69 days later. The hatchlings measure between in length. The hatchlings are independent from birth and have fully functional venom glands.  Venom  The Indian cobra's venom mainly contains a powerful post-synaptic neurotoxin and cardiotoxin. The venom acts on the synaptic gaps of the nerves, thereby paralyzing muscles, and in severe bites leading to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. The venom components include enzymes such as hyaluronidase that cause lysis and increase the spread of the venom. Envenomation symptoms may manifest between fifteen minutes and two hours following the bite. In mice, the SC range for this species is 0.45 mg/kg ‚Äì 0.75 mg/kg. The average venom yield per bite is between 169 and 250 mg. Though it is responsible for many bites, only a small percentage are fatal if proper medical treatment and anti-venom are given. Mortality rate for untreated bite victims can vary from case to case, depending upon the quantity of venom delivered by the individual involved. According to one study, it is approximately 20‚Äì30%, but in another study involving victims who were given prompt medical treatment, the mortality rate was only 9%. In Bangladesh it's responsible for most of the snake bite cases.

The Hindu god Shiva is often depicted with a cobra called Vasuki, coiled around his neck, symbolizing his mastery over \\"maya\\" or the world-illusion. Vishnu is usually portrayed as reclining on the coiled body of Adishesha, the Preeminent Serpent, a giant snake deity with multiple cobra heads. Cobras are also worshipped during the Hindu festival of Nag Panchami and Naagula Chavithi. = Snake charming = The Indian cobra's celebrity comes from its popularity as a Nipaie of choice for snake charmers. The cobra's dramatic threat posture makes for a unique spectacle, as it appears to sway to the tune of a snake charmer's flute. Snake charmers with their cobras in a wicker basket are a common sight in many parts of India only during the Nag Panchami or Naagula Chavithi festival. The cobra is deaf to the snake charmer's pipe, but follows the visual cue of the moving pipe and it can sense the ground vibrations from the snake charmer's tapping. Sometimes, for the sake of safety, the cobra will either be venomoid or the venom will have been milked prior to the snake charmer's act. The snake charmer may then sell this venom at a very high price. In the past Indian snake charmers also conducted cobra and mongoose fights. These gory fight shows, in which the snake was usually killed, are now illegal.Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960. indialawinfo.com =Heraldry= Indian cobras were often a heraldic element in the official symbols of certain ancient princely states of India such as Gwalior, Kolhapur, Pal Lahara, Gondal, Khairagarh and Kalahandi, among others.Heraldry of Madhya Pradesh. hubert-herald.nl Gallery Image:Cobra hood.jpgIndian cobra displaying an impressive hood Image:Indian Binocellate Cobra.JPGBinocellate cobra Image:Cobra home.JPGIndian cobra outside a home in Yelandur, Karnataka, South India Image:The Common Indian Cobra or Spectacled Cobra 35.JPGThe ocellation of the spectacled cobra File:Common Cobra Vomiting.JPGCobra regurgitating bones and hair References External links * Serpents in Indian culture An article on Biodiversity of India website.

The capitol, a 21-story Art Deco tower, is located in Bismarck at 600 East Boulevard Avenue, and is the tallest habitable building in the state. On a campus that also houses many other government buildings, the capitol building and the surrounding office buildings house the state's legislative and judicial branches, as well as many government agencies. The State Capitol is largely surrounded by state government buildings. The parks, walking trails, and monuments on the grounds provide a great deal of information about the state's history, making it one of the city's tourist attractions. Six buildings occupy the grounds; constructed as the government grew. Not all state agencies are housed on the grounds, however: a large number are spread throughout the city in other facilities. The state facility management division developed plans for a massive expansion and improvement of the grounds in 2000, but very little of the plan had been implemented by 2012. History The territorial capitol as designed by the Minneapolis architectural firm of Caulkins and Telford in 1883 The First State Capitol building - 1903 wing The first capitol building was constructed between 1883 and 1884 to house the territorial government, and after statehood, two additions were erected: the Senate wing (1894, south side), and the House wing (ca. 1903, north side). On the morning of December 28, 1930, smoke was spotted coming from the northeast part of the original building, and despite the fire department being summoned within minutes of the fire being noticed, it was already too late to save the structure. Even as the fire raged through the upper portions of the building, efforts were made by citizens and state employees to rescue what was possible before everyone was ordered out of the building mid-morning. It was later determined to likely have originated in a pile of oily rags in a janitor's closet on the top floor of the main part of the building, as work had been underway to clean and varnish the legislators' desks in preparation for the upcoming legislative session. North Dakota Secretary of State Robert Byrne saved the original copy of the state's constitution, but suffered cuts and burns on his hands while breaking a window to reach the document. Another state employee, Jennie Ulsrud, burned her hands when she attempted to save records in the state treasurer's office. Governor George F. Shafer came back from his visit to St. Paul, Minnesota while the fire was still burning. Upon arrival, he immediately assembled a team of state legislators and officials to discuss plans for coping with the loss of records and work space. As soon as it was safe to enter the interior of the still smoldering building, 40 state prison inmates were used to salvage the various departments' vaults and other items from the ruins (some vaults were burned, but most were found to be intact when opened). The Legislature met temporarily in Bismarck's War Memorial Building and the City Auditorium, an annex being constructed to link the two. State offices were spread out across all available space across town, including an entire floor of the Patterson Hotel downtown. Such was the need for space that the unburned lower floors of the original capitol's 1903 wing were even repaired and returned to use. The disaster required the construction of a new building during the Great Depression. The tower and wing were built between 1931 and 1934, at a cost of $2 million. Governor George F. Shafer broke ground for the building on August 13, 1932. Workers on the building were paid only 30 cents an hour and, after multiple worker strikes, the capitol grounds were administered by martial law in June 1933. The state sold half of the original capitol campus to defray the cost of construction. Artist Edgar Miller was brought in to do much of the interior design and decoration as well as the bas-relief sculptures on the facade which depict the human history of North Dakota. The new 19-story capitol was expected to provide ample space for years to come, however it quickly filled as the state government expanded. The Liberty Memorial Building, completed in 1924, was able to house some of the additional workers, but more space was needed by 1955 when construction began for the State Office Building. The building originally housed the Bismarck Junior College, but the Legislature purchased it in 1959. The 1960s was a period of rapid development of the grounds. In 1960, the new governor's residence replaced the old residence which was deteriorating. In 1980, expanding State Historical Society of North Dakota moved into the new North Dakota Heritage Center and in 1968, the North Dakota Department of Transportation occupied the building designed to provide it more office space. The Transportation Building is the last constructed on the campus to date, although a Judicial Wing was added onto the base of the capitol tower between 1977 and 1981. While the space needed by state government has increased since the original construction of the Capitol in the 1930s, the state's population has decreased. Layout The state capitol grounds has six buildings: the capitol building, the Department of Transportation Building, the North Dakota Heritage Center, the Liberty Memorial Building, the governor's residence, and the State Office Building. Additionally, the campus holds Myron Atkinson Park and the Capitol Park. Through the center of the grounds is the Capitol Mall, a large open field of grass with walking paths lined by American Elm trees. The Mall was the site of the state's snow angel world record breaking in 2007, with 8,962 people sprawled out on the snow-covered mall; a picture was taken from the top of the Capitol tower. Buildings =State Capitol= The capitol building is a tall, 21-story, Art Deco skyscraper designed by North Dakota architects Joseph Bell DeRemer of Grand Forks and W. F. Kurke of Fargo in conjunction with the noted Chicago firm of Holabird and Root,North Dakota State Capitol Master Plan, p. 1-3 It is the tallest building in North Dakota and is known as the Skyscraper on the Prairie. This tower houses the office of the governor and the offices of multiple state agencies and departments. At the tower's base, in the west wing, the two chambers of the legislature meet when in session while the state supreme court meets in the east wing. The 18th floor of the Capitol is an observation deck with the highest vantage point in the state. The south side of the Capitol building features a drive-through tunnel which leads to an entrance to the building. This was accessible by public vehicles until 2001 when it was closed due to security measures after the September 11, 2001, attacks. Today, only pedestrians are able to enter the tunnel. In 1988, U.S. President George H. W. Bush presented and dedicated an American Elm tree near the Capitol steps in commemoration of the state's Centennial of 1989. The many windows on the capitol building's tower are used for several ongoing traditions. During the Christmas season, red and green shades are drawn over the windows and lights are turned on in certain offices to make a pattern that resembles a Christmas tree. During the New Year's Eve, office lights are turned on to spell out the new year; the first two numbers of the new year are given on the top half, and the last two numbers on the bottom. This tradition began during the 1970s, and is now done on all four sides of the building; the Christmas tree tradition began as early as the 1940s. Tours of the capitol building are available on weekdays. Weekend tours are available Memorial Day through Labor Day. Tours include stops throughout both the building's legislative and judicial wings as well as an elevator ride to the top of the tower. Judicial Wing The judicial wing serves as a hub for the state supreme court and its support staff, as well as office space for state agencies like the Department of Health and the Department of Human Resources. The design for the building began in May 1977, construction began in April 1979 and it was finished completely and occupied by 1981. The size of the Judicial Wing is and was built at a cost of $10.5 million. The dedication for the addition was held on November 15, 1981, with both Governor Allen Olson and former Governor Arthur A. Link present at the ceremony. Included in the wing is the Capitol lunchroom, which serves food to state employees and even the general public on weekdays. Prior to the 2017 Legislative Assembly, two new committee rooms were added in the Judicial Wing (in a space vacated by the Information Technology Department). These rooms are used by various legislative committees when the Assembly is in session, and by the Judicial branch when the Legislature is not meeting. =Liberty Memorial Building= The Liberty Memorial Building is home to the State Library, as well as offices for the Special Education Unit of the Department of Public Instruction. The building's construction was authorized by the state's legislature in 1919 in response to an increase of governmental departments and the project was finished by 1924 with a cost of $350,000. The building originally housed the State Historical Society Museum, the Adjutant General, the State Library Commission, and the supreme court until the State Library occupied it. The building is the oldest facility still on the capitol grounds and was renovated in 1982 to conform with modern building codes. =Department of Transportation building= The Department of Transportation Building The North Dakota Department of Transportation Building is home to the central office of the state's transportation department, as well as small divisions of other agencies. The building was completed in 1968 with materials that harmonize visually with the earlier structures. Before it was consolidated in this building, the Department of Transportation, known then as the State Highway Department, occupied several buildings around the campus including the State Office Building and the capitol. The building contains of space and is just to the east of the capitol tower. While above ground the building is separated from the tower, it is connected to the Judicial Wing by a tunnel accessible only to state employees. =North Dakota Heritage Center= The North Dakota Heritage Center building is home to the Heritage Center museum which stores and displays artifacts from around the state. The building also is home to office space for the North Dakota State Historical Society which operates the museum. Planning for the building began as early as 1963 and upon completion of the structure in 1981, the State Historical Society moved from the Liberty Memorial Building into its new Heritage Center quarters. The facility consists of and provides exhibit areas as well as storage, meeting rooms, and offices. In 2006, state officials revealed a massive expansion plan for the center. The construction cost approximately $50 million and nearly doubled the size of the complex adding three large galleries to the east of the existing structure, as well as a new main entry fronting State Street. The building consisted of and the expansion added . Funding for the project consisted of twenty percent private, twenty percent federal, and sixty percent state. In addition to the new gallery area, the expansion includes a 50-seat digital auditorium, climate-controlled storage areas, a caf√©, a children's gallery, expanded visitors service and store, and the Corridor of History, a -wide walkway spanning the length of the expansion with a glazed southern exposure on one side and digital murals on the other. =State Office Building= The State Office Building, on the complex's southeast corner, contains the Water Commission, in addition to several divisions of the office of the Attorney General: the Civil Litigation Division and the Natural Resources and Indian Affairs attorneys. Built in 1955, the structure housed the Bismarck Junior College until 1961 when the legislature authorized its purchase. Since then, it has been home for various state agencies. During the 1991-1993 biennium, the building underwent massive renovation and was re-faced with an exterior that blended more harmoniously with the complex's other buildings. At , the building is the smallest of the those housing offices. =North Dakota Governor's Residence= The previous Governor's Residence Prior to 1960, North Dakota's First Family lived in a house off the capitol grounds. In 1960, the state constructed a residence near 4th Street on the west side of the campus to replace the outdated residence. After an extensive remodeling effort managed by then-first-lady Nancy Schafer in 2000, the residence had more than of floor space and eighteen rooms. In 2015, the legislature authorized a new residence adjacent to the current facility that would address security and accessibility issues. This state offered the structure to anyone who would relocate it, but received no bids, so it was demolished. The new structure had an anticipated cost of $5 million with a requirement $1 million be raised by private donations. The governor's family occupied the new residence in March 2018. Outdoor facilities =Parks= Two parks, the Myron Atkinson Park and the Capitol Park occupy space on the capitol grounds. The Myron Atkinson Park, named after the Bismarck attorney Myron Atkinson, is east of State Street. Pedestrians can access the park via a tunnel. The Capitol Park is at the northwest corner of the grounds at the intersection of 4th Street and Divide Avenue and includes a playground with trees and shrubs planted by the Farwest Rotary Club. =Arboretum Trail= The Arboretum Trail is a walking trail winding through a wooded area on the west side of the grounds. Walkers pass 60-million-year-old petrified tree stumps from the Amidon, North Dakota, area, as well as 75 different species of trees and shrubs which are labeled with ground plaques. Various statues and memorials are also on the trail. The trail was created in 1985 in anticipation of the state's centennial and as an opportunity for state employees and the public to exercise while learning about various trees and the history of the buildings on the grounds. Many area schools take their students to the trail for nature walks and students have used the various trees for leaf collections. This damaged some of the trees, so signs that forbid leaf picking were posted. =Prairie Trail= The Prairie Trail runs north of the Capitol's Judicial Wing, taking pedestrians into an area filled with examples of grasses and wild flowers which are typical of native prairie. In 2006, the trail was expanded to take walkers from the corner of State Street and Divide Avenue south into the main grounds area. The original trail was dedicated with a plaque in 1987 and the wild grassland surrounding the trail was registered as a state Natural Area by the Parks and Recreation Department. Statues and monuments Sakakawea statue by Leonard Crunelleon, North Dakota State Capital grounds =Pioneer Family= The Pioneer Family statue is one of the most prominent on the grounds, as it is on the southern end of the mall in the foreground of the capitol tower. The statue was sculpted in 1946 by Avard Fairbanks and dedicated to honor the memory of the great northwest. =All Veterans Memorial= The All Veterans Memorial is a large monument south of the Heritage Center, along a walking path. The memorial is to all North Dakotans who served in the armed forces during the first 100 years of statehood was finished and dedicated on June 10, 1989. The names of 4,050 men and women who died in the nation's wars are inscribed on the bronze tablets displayed under a large block of stone supported by columns. The monument is lit during the night. Stone benches are available for seating. =Other statues= Other statues on the capitol grounds include Sakakawea, John Burke, Cort√©s, Buffalo, Pioneers of the Future, Purple Heart Memorial, Peace Officers Memorial, French Gratitude, and USS North Dakota bowplate.

In 1948 he received undergraduate degrees in physics and mathematics, and in 1951 he received a Ph.D. in physics. From 1951 to 1953, he was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Illinois, where he developed an important theory on the transfer of spin polarization; once the theory had been confirmed and demonstrated by other scientists, it became known as the Overhauser Effect. He was on the faculty at Cornell University from 1953 to 1958, and then left to join the research staff at Ford Motor Company. Overhauser remained at Ford until 1973, when he joined the faculty at Purdue University. He remained at Purdue as the Stuart Distinguished Professor of Physics for the rest of his career. Overhauser died in 2011 in West Lafayette, Indiana. He was 86. Honors and awards * Received National Medal of Science, 1994 * Elected to the National Academy of Sciences, 1976 * Oliver E.

San Miniato is a town and comune in the province of Pisa, in the region of Tuscany, Italy. San Miniato sits at an historically strategic location atop three small hills where it dominates the lower Arno valley, between the valleys of Egola and Elsa rivers. It used to carry the additional sobriquet al Tedesco (\\"to the German\\") to distinguish it from the convent of San Miniato al Monte in Florence, which is about to the northeast. History In medieval times, San Miniato was on the via Francigena, which was the main connecting route between northern Europe and Rome. It also sits at the intersection of the Florence- Pisa and the Lucca-Siena roads. Over the centuries San Miniato was therefore exposed to a constant flow of friendly and hostile armies, traders in all manner of goods and services, and other travelers from near and far. Archaeological evidence indicates that the site of the city and surrounding area has been settled since at least the paleolithic era. It would have been well known to the Etruscans, and certainly to the Romans, for whom it was a military post called \\"Quarto\\". The first mention in historical documents is of a small village organized around a chapel dedicated to San Miniato built by the Lombards in 783. By the end of the 10th century San Miniato boasted a sizeable population enclosed behind a moat and protected by a castle built by Otto I. In 1116, the new imperial vicar for Tuscany, Rabodo, established himself at San Miniato, supplanting Florence as the centre of government. The site came to be known as al Tedesco, since the imperial vicars, mostly German, ruled Tuscany from there until the 13th century. The first walls, with defensive towers, were thrown up in the 12th century during the time that Italy was dominated by Frederick Barbarossa. Under his grandson, Frederick II, the town was further fortified with expanded walls and other defensive works, including the Rocca and its tower. During the latter years of the 13th century and the entire 14th century, San Miniato was drawn into the ongoing conflict between the Ghibelline and Guelph forces. Initially Ghibelline, it had become a Guelph city by 1291, allied with Florence and, in 1307, fought with other members of the Guelph league against the Ghibelline Arezzo. By 1347 San Miniato was under Florentine control, where it remained, but for a brief period from 1367-1370 when, instigated by Pisa, it rebelled against Florence, and for another brief period between 1777 and 1779 during the Napoleonic conquest. It was still part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany when the Duchy was absorbed into the newly formed Kingdom of Italy in 1860. Main sights The city is enclosed within a well-preserved medieval precinct. Main landmarks include: * The Tower of Frederick II, built by Frederick II in the 13th century on the summit of the hill at an elevation of , overlooking the entire Valdarno. Here was imprisoned his chancellor Pier delle Vigne until he committed suicide. During World War II it was destroyed by the German Army to prevent the Allies from using it as a gun sighting tower, but was reconstructed in 1958 by architect Renato Baldi. * The Duomo (Cathedral), dedicated to both Sant'Assunta and Santo Genesio or Saint Genesius of Rome. It was originally a Romanesque building, but it has been remodelled several times and exhibits Gothic and some Renaissance architectural elements. The fa√ßade incorporates a number of colorful majolica bowls. The interior has Latin cross plan with a central nave with two side aisles. The cathedral's campanile, a fortification annexed in is called the Matilde Tower and features an asymmetrical clock. * The Diocesan Museum, next to the cathedral. This museum- gallery contains works by Filippo Lippi, Jacopo Chimenti, Neri di Bicci, Fra Bartolomeo, Frederico Cardi (known as Cigoli) and Verrocchio. * Palazzo dei Vicari, built by Emperor Otto IV during the 12th century, the palazzo incorporates one of the oldest known crenellated turrets. The interior has a number of interesting frescoes. It is now an hotel. * Palazzo Comunale. This 14th-century building is still San Miniato's Town Hall. Its great hall was decorated by Cenno di Francesco Cenni. It also features a small oratory, containing a 16th-century altarpiece. * The church of San Francesco. Originally built in the early 13th century with a Romanesque fa√ßade, its interior features Gothic style chapels and frescoes from the 14th and 15th centuries. * The church of San Domenico was originally constructed in the 14th century, but has an incomplete fa√ßade. Its interior contains terracotta works by Luca della Robbia, a fresco attributed to Masolino da Panicale and a burial monument sculpted by Donatello. Next to the fa√ßade begins the Via Angelica, a tunnel that connected the countryside to the city. * Convent of San Francesco. Purportedly founded by Saint Francis of Assisi himself in 1211 when he visited the city, the Convent stands behind the city higher up on the hill. Other buildings and monuments worth seeing include the Bishop's Sanctuary, with a Baroque fa√ßade in the design of an amphitheater, designed by Cigoli and the Sanctuary of the Crucifix, recently restored, the desanctified Chiesa di San Martino, which has done duty as a convent, and then a prison, but which will now be used for conventions. There are also a number of Renaissance palazzi, built by such aristocratic families as the Roffia, Grifoni, Formichini and the Bonapartes, ancestors of Napoleon. White truffles During the last three weeks of November, San Miniato hosts a festival devoted to the gastronomically precious white truffle which is harvested in the area around the city. The white truffle is more highly valued than the black truffles found in Umbria and the Marche, and commands very high prices, reflected in the cost of restaurant dishes that incorporate truffles. In 1954 a record-breaking truffle found close to the nearby village of Balconevisi weighed in at and was sent to the United States of America as a gift for President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Current (2019) prices for white truffle in the town are 2500 euros per kilo for first quality and 1800 euros per kilo for second quality.

Lck is a tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates tyrosine residues of certain proteins involved in the intracellular signaling pathways of these lymphocytes. It is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases.  T cell signaling  Lck is most commonly found in T cells. It associates with the cytoplasmic tails of the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors on T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells, respectively, to assist signaling from the T cell receptor (TCR) complex. When the T cell receptor is engaged by the specific antigen presented by MHC, Lck acts to phosphorylate the intracellular chains of the CD3 and Œ∂-chains of the TCR complex, allowing another cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase called ZAP-70 to bind to them. Lck then phosphorylates and activates ZAP-70, which in turn phosphorylates another molecule in the signaling cascade called LAT (short for Linker of Activated T cells), a transmembrane protein that serves as a docking site for a number of other proteins, the most important of which are Shc-Grb2-SOS, PI3K, and phospholipase C (PLC). Additionally, upon T cell activation, a fraction of kinase active Lck, translocates from outside of lipid rafts (LR) to inside lipid rafts where it interacts with and activates LR-resident Fyn, which is involved in further downstream signaling activation. The tyrosine phosphorylation cascade initiated by Lck and Fyn culminates in the intracellular mobilization of calcium (Ca2+) ions and activation of important signaling cascades within the lymphocyte. These include the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway, which goes on to activate certain transcription factors such as NFAT, NF-Œ∫B, and AP-1. These transcription factors regulate the production of a plethora of gene products, most notable, cytokines such as Interleukin-2 that promote long-term proliferation and differentiation of the activated lymphocytes. In addition to significance of Lck and Fyn in T cell receptor signaling, these two src kinases have also been shown to be important in TLR-mediated signaling in T cells. The function of Lck has been studied using several biochemical methods, including gene knockout (knock-out mice), Jurkat cells deficient in Lck (JCaM1.6), and siRNA-mediated RNA interference.  Structure  Lck is a 56-kilodalton protein. The N-terminal tail of Lck is myristoylated and palmitoylated, which tethers the protein to the plasma membrane of the cell. The protein furthermore contains a SH3 domain, a SH2 domain and in the C-terminal part the tyrosine kinase domain. The two main phosphorylation sites on Lck are tyrosines 394 and 505. The former is an autophosphorylation site and is linked to activation of the protein. The latter is phosphorylated by Csk, which inhibits Lck because the protein folds up and binds its own SH2 domain. Lck thus serves as an instructive example that protein phosphorylation may result in both activation and inhibition.  Substrates  Lck tyrosine phosphorylates a number of proteins, the most important of which are the CD3 receptor, CEACAM1, ZAP-70, SLP-76, the IL-2 receptor, Protein kinase C, ITK, PLC, SHC, RasGAP, Cbl, Vav1, and PI3K.  Inhibition  In resting T cells, Lck is constitutively inhibited by Csk phosphorylation on tyrosine 505. Lck is also inhibited by SHP-1 dephosphorylation on tyrosine 394. Lck can also be inhibited by Cbl ubiquitin ligase, which is part of the ubiquitin-mediated pathway. Saractinib, a specific inhibitor of LCK impairs maintenance of human T-ALL cells in vitro as well as in vivo by targeting this tyrosine kinase in cells displaying high level of lipid rafts. Masitinib also inhibits Lck, which may have some impact on its therapeutic effects in canine mastocytoma.  Interactions  Lck has been shown to interact with: * ADAM15, * CD2, * CD44, * CD4, * COUP-TFII, * DLG1, * NOTCH1, * PIK3CA, * PTPN6, * PTPRC, * UNC119, * SYK, * UBE3A, and * ZAP70.

Accessed March 23, 2008. in which disc jockeys are given wide latitude in what they may play, similar to the freeform format but with the proviso that some kind of rock music is almost always played.Fritz E. Froehlich, Allen S. Kent, Carolyn M. Hall (eds.), \\"FM Commercialization in the United States\\", The Froehlich/Kent Encyclopedia of Telecommunications, CRC Press, 1991. . p. 179. It enjoyed the height of its popularity in the late 1960s and 1970s. The name for the format began being used circa 1968, when serious disc jockeys were playing \\"progressive 'music for the head and discussing social issues in between records.Mike Olszewski, Radio Daze: Stories from the Front in Cleveland's FM Air Wars, Kent State University Press, 2003. . p. xi. During the late 1960s, as long playing records began to supplant the single in popularity with rock audiences, progressive rock stations placed more emphasis on album tracks than their AM counterparts. Throughout the 1970s, as FM stations moved to more structured formats, progressive radio evolved into album-oriented rock (AOR).William Safire, quoting Stephen Holden, \\"On Language: Don't Touch That Dial\\", The New York Times, September 7, 1986. Accessed August 23, 2007. Origins When FM broadcasting licenses were first issued by the FCC, broadcasters were slow to take advantage of the new airwaves available to them because their advertising revenues were generated primarily from existing AM broadcasting stations and because there were few FM radio receivers owned by the general public. This void created an opportunity for the disenchanted youth counterculture of the 1960s to express itself by playing music that was largely ignored by mainstream outlets. In this sense, progressive rock radio was more of a social response than a product marketed to fill a need. This change coincided with the greater emphasis on albums as opposed to singles in the rock market. Hugely popular albums such as The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Arlo Guthrie's Alice's Restaurant did not contain any singles, so there was clearly a need for a radio format that would explore beyond the Top 40. This in turn led to rock artists placing greater emphasis on long or experimental album tracks, knowing they could still receive radio airplay. Definition The progressive rock radio format should not be confused with the progressive rock music genre. While progressive rock music was certainly played on progressive rock stations, a number of other varieties of rock music were also played. Generally everything from early Beatles and early Dylan on forward was fair game. Progressive rock radio was generally the only outlet for fringe rock genres such as space rock, jazz fusion, and quiet, acoustic- based folk rock and country rock (often played on weekend mornings). Progressive stations were also known for having \\"turntable hits\\", songs by obscure artists that did not sell much and were not hits by any conventional measure, but which listeners kept calling up and requesting;Bobby Borg, The Musician's Handbook: A Practical Guide to Understanding the Music Business, Watson-Guptill, 2003. . p. 191. Sweet Thursday's \\"Gilbert Street\\" was a good example on the East Coast. The progressive rock radio format grew out of the freeform radio format,Sara Pendergast, Tom Pendergast, St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, St. James Press, 2000. and, sharing the key characteristic of disc jockeys having the freedom to play what they chose, has sometimes been referred to as \\"freeform rock radio\\" or \\"freeform progressive radio\\"Todd Leopold, \\"Whatever happened to rock 'n' roll radio?\\", CNN.com, February 7, 2002. Accessed August 24, 2007. or simply \\"FM rock radio\\". But as they evolved there were key differences between the freeform and progressive rock formats: * Freeform could play any genre of music; progressive rock generally limited itself to (various kinds of) rock. * After its early days, freeform tended towards small or \\"underground\\" stations in non-commercial or niche markets;Jesse Walker, Rebels on the Air: An Alternative History of Radio in America, NYU Press, 2001. . pp. 71-100. progressive rock could and did handle big-signal stations in large markets. * Progressive rock was intended to be as fully commercially viable as any other mainstream radio format; freeform usually shunned such ambitions. * The progressive rock format had a large impact on the commercial rock music industry at the time; the freeform format generally did not.

The figure of Hammonia as symbol of Hamburg first appears in art and literature in the 18th century. Up until the Protestant Reformation, the city's patroness had been the Virgin Mary. A tall and beautiful goddess who watches over Hamburg, she is usually shown wearing a crown in the form of a city wall surmounted by towers; she may also hold the city's coat of arms, a ship's anchor, etc. She is said to represent the Hanseatic values of Hamburg: freedom, peace, prosperity, harmony, welfare and trade.  Hammonia in art  = Hammonia in literature and music = Hamburg‚Äôs Anthem, the Hamburg-Lied or Hamburg-Hymne was written in 1828 by Georg Nikolaus B√§rmann. Deutschland: Ein Winterm√§rchen (Germany: A Winter‚Äôs Tale) by Heinrich Heine includes her. The goddess is in Heines encounter the fat, tipsy and sentimental daughter of Charlemagne and a \\"haddock queen\\". Hammonia also figures large in Wolf Biermann's Deutschland Ein Wintermaerchen. = Hammonia in sculpture = St. Georg On 10 July 1878 the Hanseatic Building Society unveiled the 17m tall Hansa-Fountain (Hansa- Brunnen) at Hansaplatz in St. Georg as a present to the City of Hamburg. The fountain was designed by architects Heinrich Joseph Kayser and Karl von Gro√üheim, the statue of Hammonia (including minor statues of Archbishop Ansgar, Adolf III of Holstein and Schauenburg, plus the Emperors Constantine and Charlemagne) were created by German sculptor Engelbert Peiffer. In 1888 a Hammonia statue and that of a young Germania were raised on the Brook‚Äôs Bridge (Brooksbr√ºcke) to welcome Emperor Wilhelm II as he opened the Hamburg's Free Port. Shortly after the end of World War II, both statues disappeared without a trace. It took almost 60 years for the city to see the return of their patron goddess: since 2003 a new statue of Hammonia has overlooked the port, and this time she is accompanied by Europa. Both sculptures were created in 2003 by German sculptor J√∂rg Plickat. Hammonia class ships was also the name of a class of ocean-going vessels owned by the Hamburg-American Line, a predecessor of the modern Hapag-Lloyd. Ships of this class included the SS Germania (I) (1863), the SS Germania (II) (1870), the SS Frisia (1872), the SS Pomerania (1873), the SS Hammonia (I) (1855‚Äî the earliest ship of this class and therefore the one that all the subsequent ships are \\"classed\\" as), the SS Hammonia (II) (1866), and the SS Silesia, among possibly as many as five or six others built as late as 1965 and one, the most recent vessel, a freighter, still in service. Several of the earlier Hammonia class ships carried trans- atlantic passengers and played a role in German immigration to the United States.

The six young men were convicted in August 1948 by an all-white jury of the murder and sentenced to death. Their case was taken up as a major civil rights case, because of injustices after their arrests and questions about the trial. The Civil Rights Congress and the NAACP had legal teams that represented three men each in appeals to the State Supreme Court. It found fault with the court's instruction to the jury, and remanded the case to a lower court for retrial, which took place in 1951. That resulted in a mistrial, requiring a third trial. Four of the defendants were acquitted. Ralph Cooper pleaded guilty, implicating the other five in the crime. Collis English was convicted of murder, but the jury recommended mercy ‚Äì life in prison rather than execution. The civil rights groups appealed again to the State Supreme Court, which found fault with the court, and remanded the case to the lower court for retrial of the two defendants who were sentenced to life. One was convicted in 1952 and the other pleaded guilty; both were sentenced to life. Collis English died in late December that year in prison. Ralph Cooper was paroled in 1954 and disappeared from the records. Crime On the morning of January 27, 1948, the elderly William Horner (1875‚Äì1948) opened his second-hand furniture store as usual, at 213 North Broad Street in Trenton. His common-law wife worked with him there. A while later, several young African-American men entered the store. One or more killed Horner by hitting him in the head with a soda bottle; some also assaulted his wife. She could not say for sure how many men were involved with the attack, saying two to four light-skinned African-American males in their teens had assaulted them. Arrests The Trenton police, pressured to solve the case, arrested the following men: Ralph Cooper, 24; Collis English, 23; McKinley Forrest, 35; John McKenzie, 24; James Thorpe, 24; and Horace Wilson, 37, on February 11, 1948. All were arrested without warrants, were held without being given access to attorneys, and were questioned for as long as four days before being brought before a judge. Five of the six men charged with the murder signed confessions written by the police. Trial The trial began on June 7, 1948, when the State of New Jersey opened its case against the six based on the five signed confessions obtained by the Trenton police. There was no other forensic evidence, and Horner's widow could not identify the men as the ones in her store. The defendants were assigned four attorneys, one of whom was African American. On August 6, 1948, all six men were convicted and sentenced to death. All six had provided alibis for that day and had repudiated their confessions, signed under duress. An appeal was filed and an automatic stay of execution granted. Appeal In the process of appeal, the Communist Party USA took on the legal defense of half the defendants, with Emanuel Hirsch Bloch acting as their attorney. The NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) defended the other three men, seeking to get their convictions overturned. Among the NAACP attorneys were Thurgood Marshall, who led many legal efforts by the organization; he later was appointed as the first African American to the Supreme Court of the United States; Clifford Roscoe Moore, Sr., later appointed as U.S. Commissioner for Trenton, New Jersey, the first African American appointed to such a position since post-Civil War Reconstruction; and Raymond Pace Alexander, later to be appointed as a judge in Pennsylvania. In 1949 the State Supreme Court remanded the case to the lower court for retrial, ruling that the jury had been improperly charged in the first case. In the course of the trial, the defense teams revealed that evidence had been manufactured. The medical examiner in Trenton was found guilty of perjury. Outcome After a mistrial, four of the men were acquitted in a third trial. Collis English was convicted. Ralph Cooper pleaded guilty, implicating the other five in the crime. The jury recommended mercy for these two men, with prison sentences rather than capital punishment. These two convictions were also appealed; the State Supreme Court said the court had erred again. It remanded the case to the lower court for a fourth trial in 1952. English suffered a heart attack (myocardial infarction) soon after the trial and died in December 1952 in prison. Cooper served a portion of his prison sentence and was released on parole in 1954 for good behavior. Legacy Because of legal abuses in the treatment of suspects after the arrests, the case attracted considerable attention. The Civil Rights Congress and the NAACP generated publicity to highlight the racial inequities in the railroading of the suspects, their lack of access to counsel, the chief witness' inability to identify them, and other issues. Figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois to Pete Seeger, then active in leftist movements, joined the campaign for publicity about obtaining justice in the trials of these men. Albert Einstein also protested the injustice. Commentary and protests were issued from many nations. The accused *Ralph Cooper (1924-?), pleaded guilty in the 4th trial and was sentenced to life. After being paroled in 1954, he disappeared from records. *Collis English (1925‚Äì1952).

Genes in the T-box family are transcription factors that play important roles in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. To carry out these roles, proteins made by this gene family bind to specific areas of DNA called T-box binding element (TBE) to control the expression of target genes.  Gene  The TBX1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 22 at position 11.21, from base pair 18,118,779 to base pair 18,145,669.  Function  The T-box 1 protein appears to be necessary for the normal development of large arteries that carry blood out of the heart, muscles and bones of the face and neck, and glands such as the thymus and parathyroid. Although the T-box 1 protein acts as a transcription factor, it is not yet known which genes are regulated by the protein.  Clinical significance  Most cases of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are caused by the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22. This region of the chromosome contains about 30 genes, including the TBX1 gene. In a small number of affected individuals without a chromosome 22 deletion, mutations in the TBX1 gene are thought to be responsible for the characteristic signs and symptoms of the syndrome. Of the three known mutations, two mutations change one amino acid (a building block of proteins) in the T-box 1 protein. The third mutation deletes a single amino acid from the protein. These mutations likely disrupt the ability of the T-box 1 protein to bind to DNA and regulate the activity of other genes. Loss of the TBX1 gene, due to either a mutation in the gene or a deletion of part of chromosome 22, is responsible for many of the features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Specifically, a loss of the TBX1 gene is associated with heart defects, an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), distinctive facial features, and low calcium levels, but does not appear to cause learning disabilities. Mutation in TBX1 causes predisposition to hernias.

At 99.13 metres long, she was the 45th largest yacht in the world as of 2018. History Originally the boat served as a Canadian anti-submarine River-class frigate called HMCS Stormont, launched in 1943. HMCS Stormont served as a convoy escort during the Battle of the Atlantic and was present at the Normandy landings. Onassis purchased the Stormont after the end of World War II, as it was one of the many surplus naval vessels. Purchasing the ship at scrap value of US$34,000, Onassis then spent an additional US$4 million to convert the vessel into a luxurious superyacht, named after his daughter Christina. Upon Onassis' death, she donated the yacht to the Greek government as a presidential yacht, renamed Argo. Article and pictures of Christina O's exterior and interior. Allowed to decay, the vessel was purchased in 1998 by fellow Greek shipping magnate John Paul Papanicolaou, an Onassis family friend who secured it in a government- sponsored auction. He spent $50 million to retrofit the ship, and restored the name of the vessel in memory of his departed friend, Christina. Today, Christina O features the coupling of unique style with modern comfort after a complete refit in 2015, and various improvements in 2017. Yacht conversion Christina O in her previous life as HMCS Stormont HMCS Stormont was purchased as war surplus from the Canadian government for $34,000 in 1947 and converted to a yacht in Germany. The conversion made full use of the navy ship's size and powerful naval engineering systems to create large, ornate interiors and elaborate luxuries: such as a mosaic swimming pool that drained and rose to deck level to create a dance floor. Christina O set a new standard for lavish personal yachts, especially as she was rebuilt amidst the austerity of post- war Europe.Dan Conlin, \\"Christina O: From Snowy Nova Scotia to the Sunny Mediterranean, How a Canadian Frigate Became the World's Most Famous Super Yacht\\", The Marine Curator: Artifacts, Images and History from the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic 5 July 2013 The yacht was remodelled by architect C√§sar Pinnau, and the children's dining room was designed and painted by the illustrator Ludwig Bemelmans. After her marriage to Onassis two decades later, Jacqueline Onassis selected the pastel color scheme and decor in all of the cabins. Papanicolaou hired Naval architect Costas Carabelas to spearhead the vessel's 1998 refit, who engaged interior architect Apostolos Molindris, the firm Decon to manage construction and the Croatian shipyard Viktor Lenac to carry it out. Notable passengers Apart from Onassis' mistress Maria Callas and his wife Jackie, he entertained celebrities such as Winston Churchill, Richard Burton, Grace Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Rudolf Nureyev, Greta Garbo, Frank Sinatra and John F. Kennedy.

Rechristened the Argo, she was allowed to decay and was eventually put up for sale at US$16 million in the early 1990s. She went unsold. In 1996, an attempted sale to American Alexander Blastos fell through when his deposit check bounced; he was later convicted of wire fraud as a result. In 1998 she was purchased by Greek shipowner John Paul Papanicolaou, an Onassis family friend who had sailed on her as a child. He reverted her name back to Christina O, in tribute to the late Christina Onassis, who had died in 1988, and undertook a major refurbishment between January 1999 and April 2001 that cost over $50 million. Amenities Christina O has a master suite, eighteen passenger staterooms, and numerous indoor and outdoor living areas, all connected by a spiral staircase. Compared to a typical 21st-century superyacht, her staterooms are small and Christina O lacks the indoor boat storage that is now standard; however, the number of living areas is large, and the amount of outdoor deck space is very generous. The aft main deck has an outdoor pool with a minotaur-themed mosaic floor that rises at the push of a button to become a dance floor.

The principle states that the teachings of the major religions are part of a single plan directed from the same God. It is one of the core teachings of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, alongside the unity of God, and the unity of humanity. The Bah√° º√≠ teachings state that there is but one religion which is progressively revealed by God, through prophets/messengers, to mankind as humanity matures and its capacity to understand also grows. The outward differences in the religions, the Bah√° º√≠ writings state, are due to the exigencies of the time and place the religion was revealed. Displays at the information centre of the Lotus Temple in New Delhi, India The Bah√° º√≠ writings state that the essential nature of the messengers is twofold: they are at once human and divine. They are divine in that they all come from the same God and expound his teachings. In this light they are seen as one and the same. At the same time they are separate individuals (their human reality) and known by different names. Each fulfills a definite mission, and is entrusted with a particular revelation. Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, claimed to be the most recent, but not the last, in a series of divine educators which include Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, and others. Unity of religion The Bah√° º√≠ teachings state that religion has been revealed progressively from the same God through different prophets/messengers, who at different times through history and in different locations come to provide the teachings of God. In this way the Bah√° º√≠ teachings see that religion has the same foundation, and that the various religions are \\"different stages in the eternal history and constant evolution of one religion\\". Symbols of many religions on a pillar of the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois, U.S. The Bah√° º√≠ concept of progressive revelation states that God is regular and periodic in revealing his will to mankind through messengers/prophets, which are named Manifestations of God. Each messenger in turn establishes a covenant and founds a religion. This process of revelation, according to the Bah√° º√≠ writings, is also never ceasing, The general theme of the successive and continuous religions founded by Manifestations of God is that there is an evolutionary tendency, and that each Manifestation of God brings a larger measure of revelation (or religion) to humankind than the previous one. The differences in the revelation brought by the Manifestations of God is stated to be not inherent in the characteristics of the Manifestation of God, but instead attributed to the various worldly, societal and human factors; these differences are in accordance with the \\"conditions\\" of the time the messenger came and the \\"spiritual capacity\\" of humanity. The Bah√° º√≠ teaching states that while certain aspects of religious teachings are absolute, others are relative; for example all religions would prescribe honesty and denounce theft, but each religion may have different laws related to social institutions such as divorce. These differences in the teachings of the various religions are seen in the Bah√° º√≠ teachings to be needed since human society has slowly and gradually evolved through higher stages of unification from the family to tribes and then nations. Thus religious truth is seen to be relative to its recipients and not absolute; while the messengers proclaimed eternal moral and spiritual truths that are renewed by each messenger, they also changed their message to reflect the particular spiritual and material evolution of humanity at the time of the appearance of the messenger. In the Bah√° º√≠ view, since humanity's spiritual capacity and receptivity has increased over time, the extent to which these spiritual truths are expounded changes. Unity of the prophets The Manifestation of God is a concept in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith that refers to what are commonly called prophets. The Manifestations of God are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God are the only channel for humanity to know about God, and they act as perfect mirrors reflecting the attributes of God into the physical world. Bah√° º√≠ teachings hold that the motive force in all human development is due to the coming of the Manifestations of God. In Bah√° º√≠ belief all of the Manifestations of God are from the same God and have the same spiritual and metaphysical nature, and that there is absolute equality between them. The differences between the various Manifestations of God and their teachings, Bah√° ºu'll√°h explained, are due to the varying needs and capacities of the civilization in which they appeared, and not due to any differences in their level of importance or nature. The Manifestations of God are taught to be \\"one and the same\\", and in their relationship to one another have both the station of unity and the station of distinction. In this sense, the Manifestations of God all fulfill the same purpose and perform the same function by mediating between God and creation. In this way each Manifestation of God manifested the Word of God and taught the same religion, with modifications for the particular audience's needs and culture. Bah√° ºu'll√°h wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes they can be seen as the spiritual \\"return\\" of all the previous Manifestations of God. The Bah√° º√≠ belief in the oneness of the Manifestations of God does not mean, however, that the same individual soul is born again at different times and in different physical bodies. In the Bah√° º√≠ view, the various Manifestations of God were all different personalities and had separate individual realities. Instead their equality is due to that Manifestation of God manifested and revealed the qualities of God to the same degree. There is no definitive list of Manifestations of God, but Bah√° ºu'll√°h and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° referred to several personages as Manifestations; they include Adam, Noah, Krishna, Moses, Abraham, Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus and Muhammad. The B√°b, as well as Bah√° ºu'll√°h, were included in this definition. Thus religious history is interpreted as a series of periods or \\"dispensations\\", where each Manifestation brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed. Bah√° º√≠s do not claim that the Bah√° º√≠ revelation is the final stage in God's direction in the course of human spiritual evolution. The Bah√° º√≠ writings contain assurances that after 1000 years, another Manifestation of God will appear to advance human civilization. Views on truth, dualism, and non-dualism Bah√° º√≠ ringstone symbol, representing the world of God, the world of the Manifestations of God and creation. One of the fundamental principles of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith is that religious truth is not absolute but relative. The teachings of the different world religions are seen as 'facets of one truth'. Bah√° º√≠ texts include statements of a dualist nature (e.g. in the Book of Certitude) and statements of a monist nature (e.g. in the Seven Valleys and the Hidden Words). Moojan Momen, in his translation of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s commentary on the tradition \\"I was a Hidden Treasure\\", states that the differences between dualist and monist views are reconciled by the teaching that these opposing viewpoints are caused by differences in the observers themselves, not in that what is observed. This is not a 'higher truth/lower truth' position. God is unknowable. For man it is impossible to get any knowledge of God or the Absolute, because any knowledge that one has, is relative. Theological differences about God are caused by imagination, as God's essence can not be described. Less stress is given to metaphysical subjects, while ethics and social action are emphasized. Ian Kluge holds a different view than Momen, which he calls 'relationalism' (associated with the process philosophy as described by A.N. Whitehead and his successors). Kluge states that the Bah√° º√≠ teachings do not accept an ontological monism and that not all views can be correct.Kluge, Ian (2008). Relativism and the Bah√° º√≠ Writings. in Lights of Irfan, Volume 9, pages 179-238. Irfan Colloquia, Wilmette, IL, USA.Kluge, Ian (2009). Some Answered Questions: A Philosophical Perspective, in Lights of Irfan, Volume 10. Peter Terry also disagrees with Momen, noting that the quotation about relativism refers to progressive revelation: \\"... that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process...\\". He also states that monism and dualism are both not compatible with the three main divisions in Bah√°'√≠ cosmology: the world of God, the world of the Manifestations of God and the World of Creation.Terry, Peter (2018). The Oneness of Reality: A Response to Moojan Momen‚Äôs ‚ÄúRelativism as a Basis for Baha‚Äôi Metaphysics‚Äù. Keven Brown concludes that the \\"realities of things are manifestations of the first thing to emanate from God, the Primal Will\\", but they are \\"not manifestations of the unknowable and inaccessible Godhead\\", and that according to the Bah√° º√≠ teachings the \\"true meaning of union (or knowing) in the mystic quest is not union with (or knowing) the Essence of God (which is impossible to attain), but recognition of the Manifestation of God for the day in which one lives\\".Brown, Keven (2001).  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Response to the Doctrine of the Unity of Existence. Journal of Bah√° º√≠ Studies, 11:3-4. Nader Saiedi describes the B√°b's explanations about the dual stations of the \\"Point\\", another term for the Primal Will of God. Roland Faber has discussed the subject from a non-dualist Buddhist perspective.Faber, Roland (2017). Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the Luminous Mind: Bah√° º√≠ Gloss on a Buddhist Puzzle, in Lights of Irfan 18. Syncretism Bah√° º√≠s follow Bah√° ºu'll√°h, a prophet whom they consider a successor to Zoroaster, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, Krishna and Buddha. This acceptance of other religious founders has encouraged some to regard the Bah√° º√≠ religion as a syncretic faith. However, Bah√° º√≠s and the Bah√° º√≠ writings explicitly reject this view. Bah√° º√≠s consider Bah√° ºu'll√°h's revelation an independent, though related, revelation from God. Its relationship to previous dispensations is seen as analogous to the relationship of Christianity to Judaism. They regard beliefs held in common as evidence of truth, progressively revealed by God throughout human history, and culminating in (at present) the Bah√° º√≠ revelation. Bah√° º√≠s have their own sacred scripture, interpretations, laws and practices that, for Bah√° º√≠s, supersede those of other faiths.Stockman, Robert (1997). The Baha'i Faith and Syncretism. Call to the world's religious leaders In 2002 the Universal House of Justice wrote a letter to the world's religious leaders, addressing the disease of sectarian hatreds, calling on all religious movements to \\"rise above fixed conceptions inherited from a distant past.\\"Universal House of Justice: Letter to the World's Religious Leaders (2002). In 2005 the document One Common Faith was published, primarily intended for a Bah√° º√≠ audience, in which it identifies as a major challenge for the Bah√° º√≠ community the inculcation of the principle of the oneness of religion and the overcoming of religious prejudices.

Written by Casey Robinson, the newspaper drama was based on The Bloody Spur by Charles Einstein, which depicts the story of \\"Lipstick Killer\\" William Heirens. Five decades after the film's release, critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, \\"Fritz Lang (M) directs his most under-appreciated great film, more a social commentary than a straight crime drama.\\" Plot The film opens with a vicious killer attacking an innocent woman in her apartment. The scene switches over to the old man, Amos Kyne (Robert Warwick), news media mogul, who is on his death bed (in his office) talking to Edward Mobley (Dana Andrews), the TV anchorman for Kyne Inc. The discussion entails what will happen to the media empire after Kyne's death with Mobley turning the top job down more than once. Mobley informs the old man that he is about to go on the air live in four minutes and walks over to a TV set in the room and turns it on, still talking to the old man, who doesn‚Äôt answer. Mobley looks back and sees Kyne slumped over dead. After Kyne's death, the corporation goes to his son, Walter Kyne (Vincent Price), who his father resented and has never allowed into the business. Due to his lack of knowledge, and not wanting to take on all the work at the top by himself, Walter Kyne decides to create a new second-in-command position of Executive Director. He challenges the men in charge of Kyne's three divisions--wire- service chief Mark Loving (George Sanders), newspaper chief Jon Day Griffith (Thomas Mitchell), and television chief \\"Honest\\" Harry Kritzer (James Craig)--to solve the crime and catch the serial killer who has been dubbed the \\"Lipstick Killer\\": whoever can do it will get the new job. The job is a very lucrative prize, and in order to secure it, Griffith attempts to ally with Mobley, who doesn't want to get involve. Loving manipulates star writer Mildred Donner (Ida Lupino) to cozy up to and get information out of Mobley. Kritzer uses a different method: he is having a secret affair with Walter Kyne's wife, Dorothy (Rhonda Fleming), and uses her as his confidante and to sweet-talk her husband in his behalf. To help conceal the affair, Dorothy has rented an apartment that coincidentally happens to be adjacent to that of Loving's secretary, Nancy Liggett (Sally Forrest). Mobley becomes engaged to Nancy Liggett and receives inside information from his police friend, Lt. Kaufman (Howard Duff). After a second murder, the two men devise a plan to set a trap by using Nancy as the bait, with Mobley taunting the Lipstick Killer (John Drew Barrymore) on TV in order to bring him out into the open. Taking the bait, the Lipstick Killer follows Nancy to her apartment to attack her, but fails to gain entrance. Mrs. Kyne happens to arrive just then and enters her apartment. The killer takes advantage of the open door and succeeds in attacking her. She fights him off and runs screaming to Nancy‚Äôs apartment. The killer runs away, and a chase unfolds until the police catch him. Through Kaufman, Mobley provides the scoop to Griffith, who makes sure to release it first in an extra-edition newspaper and only then on the Kyne wire service, but still ahead of any competitors. In all the commotion, Dorothy is recognized at the secret apartment and the adulterous affair is exposed. \\"Honest\\" Harry Kritzer wins the promotion because of the threat of blackmail against Kyne. As Mobley and Griffith discuss the aftermath of these events in a bar, Mobley announces that he has resigned. Kyne comes in and Mobley tells him what he thinks of him. The movie ends with Mobley and Nancy having gotten married in Florida, and learning in a local paper of an unexpected shakeup in the Kyne organization. Kritzer is out, the promotion has gone to Mitchell--and Mobley is to be promoted in turn to replace him. The happy couple kiss, ignoring a ringing telephone.

The script was originally known as News is Made at Night. It was made for United Artists. The city in the film is supposed to be New York, but the film was shot in Los Angeles. In so doing, they used the Pacific Electric Belmont trolley tunnel under downtown LA and interurban cars with steps and trolley poles to represent the heavyweight cars of the New York City Subway rolling stock, which are drastically different in appearance. Several props‚Äîsome of which featured a large K in a circle‚Äîwere recycled from Citizen Kane, which RKO had made 15 years earlier, and may have prompted the use of the name \\"Kyne.\\" The film was reportedly sold outright to RKO for a profit of $500,000. Reception On its release, film critic Abe Weiler liked the film, especially the acting. He wrote: \\"Since it is full of sound and fury, murder, sacred and profane love and a fair quota of intramural intrigue, a viewer is left wondering if the tycoons of the giant Kyne publishing combine ever bother to cover such mundane stories as the weather. But while this journalistic jamboree is more flamboyant than probable, a tight and sophisticated script by Casey Robinson and a clutch of professional performances make While the City Sleeps a diverting and workmanlike fiction.\\" Decades after the film's release, it continues to attract critical attention. In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100. Time Out film reviews wrote of the film, \\"Lang makes inspired use of glass-walled offices, where all is seen and nothing revealed, and traces explicit parallels between Andrews and the murderer. Lang's most underrated movie.\\" Emanuel Levy wrote in 2019, \\"One of Fritz Lang‚Äôs best noir crime films of the 1950s, 'While the City Sleeps' is significant film in anticipating future trends of the genre.\\" Home media Unavailable on home video for many years following a VHS release in the 1990s, in 2010 While the City Sleeps became available on DVD in the UK by Exposure Cinema. In 2011 it was released in the U.S. on DVD-R by the Warner Archive Collection (WAC). Internet review site DVD Beaver compared these releases, citing the Exposure release as superior due to the Warner Archive release being \\"Single-layered and significantly softer. It also has some brightness boosting.\\" The reviewer, Gary Tooze, also states that \\"There are no extras, not even the trailer that is available on [the] Exposure disc\\". The Exposure Cinema release is open-matte, while the Warner Archive release is in Superscope. Warner Archive released a region-free Blu-ray on March 13, 2018, about which Tooze concludes, \\"I love the film, but the HD - superior in quality - is a part of an underwhelming package - yet we must own it with no signs of a more complete Blu-ray release in the future, unless it comes from the UK or France.\\" See also *List of American films of 1956 References Further reading * External links  * Category:1956 films Category:1950s psychological thriller films Category:1950s serial killer films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Film noir Category:Films about journalists Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Fritz Lang Category:Films scored by Herschel Burke Gilbert Category:Films set in New York City Category:RKO Pictures films Category:American serial killer films ","title":"While the City Sleeps (1956 film)"},{"id":"3598428","text":"The Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association (IEMA) was a United States-based non-profit organization dedicated to serving the business interests of leading retailers that sell Interactive entertainment software (including video games, multimedia entertainment, peripherals and other software). Member companies of the IEMA collectively accounted for approximately seventy-five percent of the $10 billion annual interactive entertainment business in the United States. The association was established in 1997 by Hal Halpin, its president and founder, and counts among its member companies the largest retailers of games including Walmart, Target Corporation, Blockbuster Entertainment and Circuit City. The IEMA also sponsored an important annual trade show in the promotion of the business of the video game industry called the \\"Executive Summit\\". In April 2006, the Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association merged with the Video Software Dealers Association to form the Entertainment Merchants Association (EMA).About EMA official site Ratings The IEMA was largely responsible for the acceptance and industry wide adoption of the self-regulatory ESRB ratings system, having endorsed it and subsequently required software publishers to rate all games in order to have their product sold on store shelves. The IEMA had also worked with parallel trade groups in the business including the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) in defeating laws that would prohibit the sale of Mature-rated games to minors. The group instead voluntarily committed to carding policies and procedures, requiring Government-issued photo identification, for all M-rated games - in much the same way that movie theatres voluntarily ask for ID for admittance to R-rated movies. Box standardization The IEMA played a major role in improving, from a retailer's perspective, the way most PC games are packaged. In 2000, many retailers were becoming disenchanted with the salability of PC games as compared with their more profitable console game counterparts as products. Oversized software boxes were blamed for a lack of productivity per square foot (the profitability of a particular item sold at retail based upon its foot print). The IEMA worked with leading game publishers in creating the now-standard IEMA-sized box, essentially a double-thick DVD-sized plastic or cardboard box, which effectively increased the profitability per square foot by over 33% and appeased merchants and developers alike. PC identification mark In creating the new box size the IEMA found itself in the unlikely position of platform guardian (where each console platform had a first-party publisher to oversee standardization matters, PC games by their very nature did not). As such, the industry pressured the organization to develop a platform identification mark which would unify the display and focus the customer's brand perception. Again the IEMA worked with publishers to create a new standard \\"PC\\" icon, and would provide its use on a royalty-free basis to the industry. Charitable work As part of the contract that computer game publishers must sign in order to use the PC icon(s), they agreed to provide three finished copies of each game that they create which uses one or more of the trademarks, as is standard practice. The IEMA chose to use the influx of new software to re-launch the video game industry's first charitable organization, Games for Good. GfG essentially acts as a repository for the games business. It receives in donated items and redistributes them to partner charities: children's hospitals, shelters, schools and other appropriate non- profit institutions. Representation In addition to its roles above the IEMA handled lobbying and legislative efforts with regard to First Amendment matters which concern its members. Association executives routinely testified before State and Federal agencies and committees on behalf of the game industry, as well as providing representation to the media and speaking on behalf of channel-oriented perspectives at trade shows and conferences. The IEMA worked on both inter and intra-industry matters for its members including RFID, Source-tagging, Organized Retail Crime Loss prevention, digital distribution. Controversy The IEMA had been accused of not following through on promises made with regard to stemming the sale of Mature-rated games to minors. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as well as special interest groups including the National Institute on Media and the Family (NIMF) have performed sting operations on IEMA member company stores and found that retailers continue to sell M-rated games to children. Critics claim that the organization makes public statements that are meant to appease law-makers and the press but does not follow through with penalties imposed upon members which run afoul of their commitment. They would furthermore like to see the IEMA more directly involved with its membership in educating store-level staff about the ESRB ratings system. Others have praised the association for its swift response to the 2005 Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Hot Coffee minigame controversy, in which the rating for the game was changed from \\"M\\" to \\"AO\\" (Adults Only). Upon receiving notification of the change, all IEMA retailers removed the product from store shelves within 24 hours.

The daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth I's Secretary of State, she became the wife of Sir Philip Sidney at age 16. Her second husband was Queen Elizabeth's favourite, Robert Devereaux Earl of Essex, with whom she had five children. Two years after his execution in 1601, she married Richard Burke, Earl of Clanricarde, and went to live with him in Ireland. Family and first marriage She was the only surviving child of Sir Francis Walsingham, Secretary of State for Queen Elizabeth I, and Ursula St. Barbe. A lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth, she married Philip Sidney in 1583, a match arranged by her father over the objections of the Queen, possibly because she did not like the prospect of two close councillors forming a power block (Sidney was nephew to Robert, Earl of Leicester). Sidney was appointed Governor of Flushing and left to attend his duties in the Netherlands, but pregnant with her first child, Frances waited until she had given birth. Her daughter was born in 1585 and named Elizabeth after the Queen, who had forgiven the couple and was one of the godparents. In June 1586 Frances left England for the Netherlands to meet her husband. On 22 September, Sidney was injured at the battle of Zutphen, and the wound became infected. Frances, again pregnant, nursed him, but he died on 17 October. She brought his body back to England, where he was given a hero's funeral, but miscarried their child.  Second marriage  In 1590 Frances' father died, leaving her with an annuity of ¬£300; she married again, to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to whom her previous husband had left his \\"best sword.\\" The match may have been arranged by her father and took place before he died, however it caused great displeasure to the Queen, (although she forgave them relatively quickly) partly because the couple had not asked for permission beforehand. Frances had three children who survived infancy with her second husband, these were named Frances, Robert and Dorothy. Her husband Robert was executed in 1601 after participating in an attempted coup against the Queen. Frances attempted to see the queen to plead on his behalf, but was not permitted to see her.

It then became a regiment of the Continental Line on January 1, 1776, designated the 10th Continental Regiment, and a regiment of the Connecticut Line on January 1, 1777, again designated the 6th Connecticut. The regiment saw action at the siege of Boston, the Battle of Long Island, the New York Campaign, and its colonel and company of light infantry served in the Corps of Light Infantry at the Battle of Stony Point. The regiment was merged into the 1st Connecticut Regiment on January 1, 1783, at West Point, New York and disbanded on November 16, 1783. History The 6th Connecticut Regiment, a provincial regiment, was raised on May 1, 1775, under the command of Col. Samuel Holden Parsons. In June, under the \\"1st establishment\\" of the Continental Army, it joined Gen. George Washington at the Siege of Boston. In August, to promote cohesion among the various colonial units, regiments were given precedence by Washington and the 6th Connecticut was also designated the \\"13th Regiment of Foot.\\" In September, in the \\"2nd establishment\\", Congress re-authorized the Continental Army for the year 1776, with Connecticut allocated to supply five regiments, to be numbered in the \\"Continental Line\\" as of January 1, 1776, and to serve until December 31, 1776. The 6th Connecticut became the 10th Continental Regiment on January 1, with Parsons as its colonel. On August 9, 1776, Parsons became a brigadier general in the Continental Armyand John Tyler, who had been appointed lieutenant colonel of the 10th Continentals on January 1, became its colonel.John Adams letter to Parsons, Aug 11, 1776 During this period another regiment known as the \\"Connecticut State Regiment\\" was authorized by Connecticut on June 20, 1776, for home defense with William Douglas, then a captain of the 1st Connecticut Regiment, appointed as its colonel. The state regiment was raised at New Haven by Douglas and in Middletown by Return Jonathan Meigs, a major of the 2nd Connecticut Regiment then on parole after being captured during Arnold's Invasion of Canada. The Continental Army was authorized under the \\"3rd establishment\\" on January 1, 1777, with enlistments to last for the duration of the war. Connecticut was now allocated to supply eight regiments of infantry. The 10th Continental Regiment became the 6th Regiment of the Connecticut Line on January 1, with Douglas appointed as it new colonel. Meigs, then lieutenant colonel of Sherburne's Additional Continental Regiment, returned to take command of the 6th Connecticut on May 12, 1777, when Douglas became ill. Douglas died on May 28 and Meigs was commissioned as colonel of the 6th Connecticut on September 10, with his date of rank retroactive to May 12. The Raid on Sag Harbor was launched on May 21, 1777 but due to a storm and rough seas the raiding party put back to shore at Guilford, Connecticut to wait out the storm. Then on May 23, 1777, three weeks after the Battle of Ridgefield, Col. Meigs and 170 men from New Haven left Guilford, Connecticut, in 13 whale boats and two armed sloops, bringing with them an extra sloop in which to bring back prisoners. This raid was planned as a reprisal for the British Brig. Gen. William Tryon's raid on Danbury, Connecticut, whose action had cost the life of General David Wooster of New Haven. Landing on Long Island they marched across to Sag Harbor, surprised the garrison, burned a dozen vessels, destroyed a large quantity of military stores, killed several of the enemy and took 90 prisoners, without losing a man. For this action, Col. Meigs was voted a Sword by Congress, which now hangs in the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.Gen. Parsons letter to Gen. Washington, May 25, 1777 After the Sag Harbor raid, the 6th Connecticut went to Peekskill, New York, to join the other regiments of the Connecticut Line. The Connecticut Line wintered at West Point during the winter of 1777-1778. While there, they constructed the \\"Meigs Redoubt\\" and other fortifications in the area. In the summer of 1778, the Connecticut Line was encamped with the Main Army under General Washington at White Plains, New York, near the site of the 1776 battle. It was here that the Connecticut Line was divided into two brigades, which stood until January 1, 1781. The 6th Connecticut was placed in the 1st Brigade under Parsons. From White Plains, they took up winter quarters at Redding, Connecticut. The troops built huts and settled in. Maj. Gen. Israel Putnam took command of all forces at Redding. In the early part of 1779, the 6th Connecticut was encamped on the Highlands across from West Point. When Tryon raided Connecticut in July, the Connecticut Line was sent to defend its own state, but arrived after Tryon and his men had left. The Connecticut Line was then called on to provide a number of Light Infantry Companies to join with Brig. Gen. \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne. Being a light infantry regiment, the 6th Connecticut filled the role perfectly and was sent, under Col. Meigs, to join with General Wayne. On July 15, 1779, this force successfully stormed the British fort at Stony Point on the Hudson River. From Stony Point, the 6th Connecticut was stationed with the Connecticut Line around West Point where it worked again on fortifications in the area. Maj. Gen. Baron Von Steuben praised the Connecticut Line for their proficiency on performing his manual of arms exercises. The Morristown huts in New Jersey were the site of winter quarters for the two Connecticut Brigades in the winter of 1779-80. While the troops were in Morristown, the Connecticut troops protested their conditions and mutinied. Col. Meigs quelled this mutiny with reason and affection and with no loss of life. A letter from General Washington commended him for this action. The Connecticut Line spent the summer of 1780 along the Hudson and while in Orange Town, New Jersey, heard of the treason of Connecticut's own Brig. Gen. Benedict Arnold and his flight to the British on September 25. The 6th Connecticut Regiment was ordered to West Point to defend any attack the enemy might have planned. There was no attack and Connecticut Line went into winter quarters near West Point. In 1781, the 6th Connecticut was consolidated with part of the 4th as the Continental forces wound down their forces pending the outcome of peace talks in Paris. Peace came two years later in September 1783 with the signing of the Treaty of Paris.

It was founded in 1884 by Charles Barstow Wright and Bishop John A. Paddock. It has an indoor pool; three gyms; science, design and technology labs; art and music studios; theater; outdoor gardens; play areas; athletic fields and open spaces. The school is an accredited member of National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS), and a member of Northwest Association of Independent Schools (NWAIS), National Coalition of Girls' Schools (NCGS), the International Boys' Schools Coalition (IBSC), and the Educational Records Bureau (ERB). Annie Wright is also a certified International Baccalaureate (IB) World School offering IB curricula throughout the schools. History Annie Wright Schools were founded as Annie Wright Seminary by Right Reverend John Adams Paddock and Charles Barstow Wright, who named it for Charles's daughter Annie, to educate the daughters of the pioneers.DEATH OF FORMER TACOMA RESIDENT, in the Tacoma Times; published May 17, 1904 (via Chronicling America) In 1884, Annie Wright Seminary opened its doors to 46 students from the Washington Territory, Oregon, British Columbia and Hawaii. At that time, there were ten members of the faculty. The first school catalog outlined the offerings of Annie Wright Seminary: \\"For board, furnished room, tuition in English branches and Latin, and laundry service, $350 a year.\\" By the early 1900s, it became apparent that the school building was becoming too small to meet demand. A new location and building were desired to give the school its much needed space. Property was purchased on North Tacoma Avenue where the cornerstone of a new building was laid on June 9, 1924. Construction of the school was completed in time for the start of the 1924‚Äì25 school year and the doors opened to students September 18, 1924. Mary McCarthy wrote of her time at Annie Wright Seminary in her memoirs Memories of a Catholic Girlhood and How I Grew. In 2009, Annie Wright Schools became an International Baccalaureate World School,http://ibo.org/school/003923/ offering the IB Diploma Programme, with the first diploma recipients in 2011. In 2015, the school was authorized to offer the IB Primary Years Programme in Preschool through Grade 5. As of 2017, Annie Wright Schools qualified for the Middle Years Programme as well. In January 2017, Annie Wright Schools announced the decision to launch an Upper School for Boys, which opened on August 30, 2017, with 15 ninth grade boys, and currently has 68 boys attending after 3 years. In June 2018, Annie Wright Schools broke ground on two projects: a new academic building for the boys' upper school and a third gym which will have an underground pool. The academic building opened for the first day of school on August 28, 2019. Tacoma Mayor Victoria Woodards officially opened the building at a community ceremony on Friday, September 6. The new gym and pool opened in December 2019.

Family Sir Thomas Grey, born 30 November 1384 in 'le Midyllgathouse‚Äô at Alnwick Castle,; ; . seat of the Percys, Earls of Northumberland, came from a family long prominent among the nobility in the border region of Northumberland.. He was the eldest son and heir of Sir Thomas Grey (135926 November 1400) of Heton near Norham, Northumberland, by his wife, Joan Mowbray (d. 1410), sister of Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk,. and daughter of John de Mowbray, 4th Baron Mowbray (d. 17 June 1368), and Elizabeth de Segrave, daughter and heiress of John de Segrave, 4th Baron Segrave. Through his mother, a granddaughter of Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk (d. 1399), Sir Thomas Grey was a descendant of King Edward I. His paternal grandparents were the soldier and chronicler Sir Thomas Grey of Heton, and Margaret, daughter and heiress of William de Pressene of Presson.; ; .

A Soldier's Life  Grey's father, Sir Thomas Grey (1359‚Äì1400), and Sir Thomas Erpingham, were among those chosen allies of Henry Bolingbroke to witness the abdication of King Richard II in Westminster Hall on 29 September 1399.. Grey was only 16 years of age when he succeeded his father in 1400, and was shown great favour in the early years of the reign of Henry IV, including the grant of the wardship of his own inheritance while he was under age. By August 1404 he had been retained for life by Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, but by May 1408 was in the service of Henry, Prince of Wales. Grey's part in the Southampton Plot was attributed by Grey himself to 'poverty and covetousness'.. In 1412 Grey betrothed his 12-year-old son and heir, Thomas Grey, to Isabel, the 3-year-old daughter of Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge. The marriage took place on 18 February 1413. As part of the marriage settlement, Grey acquired the lordship of Wark-in-Tyndale at a 'bargain price', which was nonetheless more than he could afford, leading Pugh to conclude that Grey was Cambridge's 'dupe', 'whose intrigues brought them both to disaster'.. Grey, Cambridge, and Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham, were the ringleaders of the failed Southampton Plot of 1415, which was a plot to assassinate King Henry V at Southampton before he sailed to France and to replace him with Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March.The historian Pugh contends that \\"there was no plot in 1415 to assassinate Henry V and his three brothers and that heinous charge, by far the most sensational in the indictment, was fabricated to ensure that Cambridge, Gray and Scrope did not escape the death penalty as a well-deserved punishment for the various other offences that they undoubtedly had committed\\". . On 31 July 1415 Mortimer revealed the plot to the King at Portchester Castle, near Portsmouth.. The conspirators were promptly arrested and executed. Sir Thomas Grey was beheaded at the North Gate of Southampton on 2 August 1415.; . The Southampton Plot is dramatized in Shakespeare's Henry V, and in the anonymous play, The History of Sir John Oldcastle.  Family  Sir Thomas Grey married, before 20 February 1408, Lady Alice Neville, the daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, by his first wife Margaret (d.1396), daughter of Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford, by whom he had four sons and four or five daughters:; . * Sir Thomas Grey (1404 - d. before 1426), who in 1412, at eight years of age, was betrothed to Isabel, then three years of age, only daughter of Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge,. and Anne Mortimer; they had one son.Burke's Peerage & Baronetage, 106th Edition, Charles Mosley Editor-in- Chief, 1999, page: 15, 1222 * Sir Ralph Grey (d. 17 March 1442), who married Elizabeth, daughter of Henry FitzHugh, 3rd Baron FitzHugh, and Elizabeth Grey, and left children.; . * Sir John Grey.. * William Grey (d.1478), Chancellor of Oxford University, Bishop of Ely, and Lord High Treasurer.; * Eleanor who married Sir John Arundel.The Visitations of the County of Cornwall, 'Arundell of Lanherne,' with additions by Lieutenant-Colonel J.

It was published in 1795, illustrated by Blake's own plates. The poem of the book consists of six chapters. The content concerns Fuzon, a son of Urizen, a Zoa or major aspect in Blake's mythology. Ahania of the title is Urizen's female counterpart. Background During autumn 1790, Blake moved to Lambeth, Surrey. He had a studio at the new house that he used while writing his what were later called his \\"Lambeth Books\\", which included The Book of Ahania in 1795. Like the others under the title, all aspects of the work, including the composition of the designs, the printing of them, the colouring of them, and the selling of them, happened at his home.Bentley 2003 pp. 122-124 The Book of Ahania was one of the few works that Blake describes as \\"illuminated printing\\", one of his colour printed works with the coloured ink being placed on the copperplate before printed.Bentley 2003 pp. 149 Both The Book of Los and The Book of Ahania were the same size, produced at the same time, and were probably etched on opposing sides of the same copper-plates. Both works were the only ones by Blake to have intaglio etchings instead of relief etchings.Bentley 2003 p. 156 Likewise, both works were colour-printed, where the various coloured inks were directly applied to the etching instead of added in later.Bentley 2003 p. 158 Although separate copies of individual plates exist, only one complete version of the Ahania exists, which is in the collection of the Library of Congress.The William Blake Archive, retrieved 20 October 2009 Frontispiece to Ahania, showing Urizen destroying his emanation Ahania Poem The story begins with Fuzon rebelling against Urizen, his father: After the verbal attack, Fuzon attacks Urizen with fire and declares himself God. This leads to the creation of the tree of mystery by Urizen by accident followed by the nailing of Fuzon's body to it: The poem continues with Ahania lamenting her disconnection from Urizen: Blake's pencil sketch for the above plate. Note that the image is reversed by the printing process Themes The Book of Ahania, along with The Book of Los, serves as an experimental revision of The Book of Urizen, and the poem takes its name from the Emanation of Urizen that he discarded.Bloom 1993 p. 79 The end of The Book of Urizen describes the end of the African civilization, which is the third of seven cycles and describes the Garden of Eden story. The book closes with Orc being cursed as the serpent, and The Book of Ahania discusses the next cycle happening within Asia. The work parallels Exodus, and it describes how the Orc figure and the Urizen figure struggle for dominance over the Israelites. The Orc figure is connected to the pillar of fire that is seen at night and Urizen is the pillar of cloud during the day that, in Blake, confuses them. However, Urizen is able to finally defeat Orc when the Israelites accept the ten commandments. This leads to a death of the Israeli culture symbolised by the serpent on Moses's pole, which is also symbol of Orc's death. This is finalised with the Israelites returning from their revolution against Egypt to a state that is exactly like that under Egypt.Frye 1990 pp. 213‚Äì214 The story of Orc and Urizen is an allegorical tale in which the young destroy the old, with Urizen representing the sterile, old figure that can only destroy and not create. However, in The Book of Ahania, Urizen is able to have a son, Fuzon, which is the embodiment of fire and an Orc figure. This connects the Orc and Urizen figures. Fuzon/Orc is also connected to many Biblical and Classical individuals, including Esau, the rival of Jacob who was forced to wander the desert. Another individual is David's son Absalom who rebelled against the traditional Jewish theological system. He was stabbed with a spear and hanged by his hair. Other individuals include Samson, Baldar, Odin, and Jesus.Frye 1990 pp. 214‚Äì215 As a whole, The Book of Ahania describes themes and ideas that are later brought up again in The Four Zoas. Ahania, the manifestation of intellectual desire, is sexual in a fallen state and dismissed by Urizen as sinful. However, as picked up in the later work, Ahania is necessary for a divine wisdom to be attained.Bloom 1993 p. 85 The work also portrays Ahania as a solitary individual that spends her time lamenting. In regards to the story, her lament is in response to the fighting between Urizen and Fuzon, which is similar to the grieving widow, Lorma, within the Ossian poems. This is taken up once again in Europe a Prophecy.Mee 2002 pp. 81‚Äì82 The Book of Ahania was the first work of Blake's to mention his Tree of Mystery. The Tree symbolically connects Christianity with Druidic belief, and makes the argument that Christianity is a continuation of previous customs. The image is also connected to Edmund Burke's describing of the English nation as connected to the English oak. Those, like Blake, that were revolutionary minded believed that the tree should be cut down and a Tree of Liberty should replace it. The Druidic imagery was also continued in the work in the image of human sacrifice through the form of the crucifixion which comes when Urizen nails the dead Fuzon to the Tree of Mystery. In this aspect, the tree is similar to the tree that was sacred to Odin and grew throughout the universe. Blake uses this pagan connection to undermine the authority of Christianity, which was likewise done by those like Thomas Paine, other radicals. The tree as image attacking both traditional government and orthodox Christianity is used by many radicals.Mee 2002 pp. 7, 97‚Äì100 Notes References * Bentley, G. E. (Jr). The Stranger From Paradise.
