It is served by the F train at all times and the <F> train during rush hours in the peak direction. History This station opened at 3:00 a.m. on March 16, 1919, as part of the opening of the first section of the BMT Culver Line. The initial section began at the Ninth Avenue station and ended at the Kings Highway station. The line was operated as a branch of the Fifth Avenue Elevated line, with a free transfer at Ninth Avenue to the West End Line into the Fourth Avenue Subway. The opening of the line resulted in reduced travel times between Manhattan and Kings Highway. Construction on the line began in 1915, and cost a total of $3.3 million. Trains from this station began using the Fourth Avenue Subway to the Nassau Street Loop in Lower Manhattan when that line opened on May 30, 1931. The Fifth Avenue Elevated was closed on May 31, 1940, and elevated service ceased stopping here. On October 30, 1954, the connection between the IND South Brooklyn Line at Church Avenue and the BMT Culver Line at Ditmas Avenue opened. With the connection completed, all service at the stations on the former BMT Culver Line south of Ditmas Avenue, including this one, were from then on served by IND trains. From June 1968 to 1987, express service on the elevated portion of the line from Church Avenue to Kings Highway operated in the peak direction (to Manhattan AM; to Brooklyn PM), with some F trains running local and some running express. During this time period, this station was used as a local station. Express service ended in 1987, largely due to budget constraints and complaints from passengers at local stations. Express service on the elevated Culver Line was ended due to necessary structural work, but never restored. From June 7, 2016, to May 1, 2017, the southbound platform at this station was closed for renovations. The Manhattan-bound platform was closed for a longer period of time, from May 22, 2017 until July 30, 2018. Station layout Platform level This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms with the center track not normally used. Both platforms have beige windscreens, green canopies, and brown roofs that run along the entire length except for a small section at the north end where they only contain mesh fences. The station's name and direction signs are in the traditional white helvetica lettering on black plates. =Exits= This station has two entrances/exits, both of which are elevated station houses beneath the tracks. The full-time side is at the south end and has a single staircase from each platform, waiting area that allows free transfer between directions, turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs to the northern corners of Avenue N and McDonald Avenue. The unstaffed station house on the north end also has a single staircase from each platform, waiting area, and two staircases going down to McDonald Avenue just south of Avenue M. However, only two HEET turnstiles (it formerly had a booth) provide entrance/exit from the station and the staircase landing on the Coney Island-platform has a single exit-only turnstile that allows passengers to exit without having to go through the unstaffed station house.

The source relates Razhden's death as a martyr during the war of Sassanids against Vakhtang I.Thomson, Robert W. (1996), Rewriting Caucasian History, pp. 217, 220. Oxford University Press, . Razhden was a guardian or tutor (·Éõ·Éê·Éõ·Éê·Éõ·É´·É£·É´·É£, mamamdzudzu) of Balendukht, a daughter of the king of the Persians, whom he accompanied to Iberia on the occasion of her marriage with Vakhtang. Razhden converted to Christianity and entered Vakhtang‚Äôs service, proving himself an able soldier. He was eventually taken captive by the Persians and tortured to death for refusing to reject Christianity. Vakhtang later built the church of Nikozi at the site of Razhden's burial and installed a bishop there. According to the \\"History of King Vakhtang Gorgasali\\", Vakhtang also built a church in St. Razhden's honor in the suburb of Ujarma. Hagiography The church of Nikozi In the 1720s, the brief medieval narrative of Juansher was transformed into hagiography by the Georgian catholicos Besarion Orbelishvili, who refurbished the story with further details. According to Besarion, the captive Razhden was pressured by the king of the Persians himself into denouncing his Christian faith. Briefly freed, through the mediation of Georgian nobles, to bid a farewell to his family, Razhden voluntarily returned to captivity and was handed over to a Persian commander in Tsromi, in Iberia, where he was eventually crucified, along with five criminals, and shot with arrows. Besarion also authored a canon to St. Razhden, while another Georgian catholicos of the 18th century, Anton I, included a rewritten passion of Razhden in his collection of Georgian martyrdoms in the 1760s.

History Kempston Rural was formed in 1896 when the old parish of Kempston was split into two parts - Kempston urban district (now the town of Kempston), and Kempston Rural parish. Historically Kempston was a large but lightly populated parish, with a decentralised population pattern. The typical parish in pre-Industrial England had one main village, perhaps complemented by a few hamlets, but in Kempston the settlement around the church - Church End - has never had more than a dozen or so houses, so it has never dominated the parish. When urban growth arrived in Kempston in the 19th century it was concentrated in the eastern parts of the parish, around the neighbouring ends of East End and Up End (i.e. the area around the High Street and St John Street) and in Kempston New Town, close to the boundary of Bedford. Geography Kempston Rural is to the west of the town of Kempston, and comprises approximately the western half of the historical ecclesiastical parish of Kempston. The parish includes the small hamlets (\\"ends\\" in local parlance) of Box End, Church End, Gibraltar, Green End, West End and Wood End. These five ends each have a dozen or more houses, up to a hundred or so, with Box End and Wood End being the largest and most identifiable of the settlements. The narrow south western extension of the parish was once known as Bourne End or Kempston Bourne, but the hamlet is now represented only by Meadow Farm. Other semi-forgotten \\"ends\\" in Kempston Rural - now represented by just a house or two - include Crow End and Littleworth End, in the Western part of the parish, and Moor End and Mill End, both of which lie to the north of Box End, towards Bromham. Not all of \\"rural\\" Kempston is in Kempston Rural: there is one \\"end\\" of the old parish - Kempston Hardwick - which is now within the boundaries of the Stewartby civil parish, and the rural land either side of Ridge Road at the Bury and Bell End Farm, is in Kempston Urban. For local election purposes Kempston Rural is in Turvey Ward, which also includes the civil parishes of Stagsden and Turvey. The area is represented on Bedford Borough Council by Mark Smith, elected in May 2007. All Saint's Church at Church End, was originally the parish church for the whole of Kempston, and is the most notable historical building in either part of Kempston.

FCC, was a series of cases heard and adjudicated by the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals from 2003 to 2010. A civilian activist group, Prometheus Radio Project, challenged new media ownership rules put forth by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during its 2002 Biennial Review. The majority ruled 2-1 to throw out the attempt by the FCC to raise the limits of cross-ownership of media, and determined that a \\"diversity index\\" used by the FCC to weigh cross-ownership (of radio, television and newspapers) employed several \\"irrational assumptions and inconsistencies.\\" Many elements were remanded to be fixed or better explained to assure they were in the public interest. The dissenting opinion by Chief Judge Anthony Joseph Scirica contested that the majority were simply employing their own assumptions, and that the FCC should be allowed to use its mandated expertise and make adjustments as necessary.373 F.3d 372, *; 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 12720, **; 32 Comm. Reg. (P & F) 962 The Court also ruled that section 202 (h) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not contain a \\"deregulatory presumption,\\" and that the burden rested with those seeking to modify or eliminate the existing rules. The FCC was ordered to reconfigure how it justifies raising ownership limits, and after the Supreme Court later turned down an appeal, the decision stood.[545 U.S. 1123; 125 S. Ct. 2904; 162 L. Ed. 2d 310; 2005 U.S. LEXIS 4811; 73 U.S.L.W. 3719] In 2010, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals revisited the case once again, following changes made by the FCC, and lifted the stay of the new rules, allowing the agency to move forward with increases in media-ownership limits.[2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 20436] Prior history of media ownership rules =2002 Biennial review and 2003 report and order= As required by changes made in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC undertook its 2002 biennial review of current media ownership rules. During this evaluation, followed by publication in the 2003 Report and Order, the FCC decided to amend the current set of rules. Under Chairman Michael Powell, the Commission sought to significantly relax media ownership regulations. The two main priorities of localism and diversity were retained.Report and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2002 Biennial Regulatory Review ‚Äî Review of the Commission's Broadcast Ownership Rules and Other Rules Adopted Pursuant to Section 202 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, MB Docket 02-277;  Cross ownership  The FCC decided to eliminate the two separate limits on ownership of different media outlets in local markets, and replace them with one multi-tiered rule. Considering the old rule prohibiting common ownership of a broadcast television station and a newspaper in the same market, and the rule limiting the amount of television and radio station cross-ownership depending on the size of the market, the FCC instituted a new three tier cross-ownership rule. In small markets, cross- ownership is prohibited. In mid-sized markets an entity can own a newspaper and either (a) one television station and 50% of radio stations, or (b) up to 100% of the radio stations. In large markets, cross ownership is unrestricted. The FCC determined this change was the best course of action for four reasons. 1) advertisers do not consider newspapers and television as close substitutes. 2) the previous ban did not allow efficient combinations that resulted in high ‚Äìquality products that ultimately supported localism. The element of localism, one in which the FCC deemed vital to public interest, was shown through statistics and empirical examples of grandfathered television stations owned by newspapers. On average, these stations had much more local content in their television news than their competitors. They also were shown to have higher quality, as judged through consumer support (ratings) and industry support (broadcasting excellence awards) 3) The FCC did not believe that it had enough evidence that ownership affected view point to the degree that a blanket ban was required. 4) The presence of other media, such as cable and internet, adequately fill the void for view point lost due to consolidation.  Diversity index  The FCC created this tool to help identify markets where cross-ownership limits should be retained. The index was based on the Herfindahl-Hirschman IndexAtkin, D., Lau, T. & Lin, C. (2006). Still on hold? A retrospective analysis of competitive implications of the Telecommunication Act of 1996, on its 10th year anniversary. Telecommunications Policy (30): p. 87. (HHI), which is used by the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice to measure market concentration. It is commonly used to assess a merger's effect on competition in a market. HHI is calculated by summing the squares of each firm's share of a given market. Therefore, a highly competitive market will have a lower score. Included in the Diversity Index are broadcast television, newspapers, radio, and internet. Based purely on popularity of each media source, the FCC assigned broadcast TV 33.8%, newspapers 20.2%, weekly periodicals 8.6%, radio 24.9%, cable internet 2.3%, and all other internet 10.2%. Within each media type, the number of outlets were assigned an equal market share. The summation of all media types for each owner was then squared and added to the index. Scores were determined for all markets with five or fewer television stations, all markets with 15 to 20 television stations, and ten randomly selected markets with between six and ten stations. The FCC then considered what would happen to scores under different ownership limit scenarios. In small sized markets, scores dramatically increased, showing the need for greater control.2003 Report and Order, Federal Register on September 5, 2003, at 68 FR 46285Cross-Ownership of Broadcast Stations and Newspapers, MM Docket 01-235 Due to events of the eventual court case, the Diversity Index never went into effect. Local television ownership rule The FCC modified local television ownership rules to allow tri-ownership in markets of 18 stations or more, and duo- ownership in all other markets, subject to a restriction on a combination of any of the four largest stations in any market. This change followed from a directive from the Telecommunications Act of 1996, in which Congress directed the FCC to examine its current rules which at the time prohibited common ownership of two stations with overlapping Grade B signal contours, known as the 'Single Market, Single Station Rule'.Rules and Policies Concerning Multiple Ownership of Radio Broadcast Stations in Local Markets, MM Docket 01-317Telecommunications Act of 19962002 Biennial Regulatory Review, 68 Fed. Reg. 46,286 (Aug. 5, 2003) Local radio ownership rule Following a 1992 change in which the FCC abandoned a one-to-a-market limit on radio station ownership, new ownership rules allowed ownership of multiple stations, with the exact number depending on market size, up to 25% of audience share. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 then directed the FCC to further relax ownership limits, allowing up to eight stations in a market (no more than five in the same FM or AM), and to review the rules biennially. Following the 2002 Biennial Review, the FCC decided to change the meaning of 'radio market' from a contour-overlap methodology, to a geography based method used by Arbitron. At the same time as switching to Arbitron Radio Markets, the FCC decided to begin including non-commercial stations when determining the size of the market. These two changes somewhat offset each other, since switching to geography reduced the size of markets, while adding non-commercial stations increased the size, however, on average, the net effect was a slight decrease in market size. In applying these new rules, current ownership configurations that would be found impermissible once new rules took effect were grandfathered their existing ties. The commission's goal was to create a system of rules that promoted five equal sized competitors in each market. They arrived at this benchmark using Game Theory. Examining this line of economic thinking, it was decided that five equal competitors was the correct amount for optimal competition in a single market.Federal Register on September 5, 2003, at 68 FR 46285 Prometheus Radio Project The Prometheus Radio Project was founded in 1998 by activists working within social change movements such as housing, environmentalism, health care, anti-war, and criminal justice reform. Beginning as a group of pirate radio stations, the group of LPFM radio stations worked together to serve local communities with diverse media views. They also pressured the FCC on various issues related to media reform, such as the Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC case. The stated mission of the group is to strengthen communities through media, and to \\"demystify media policy and technology and advocate for a more just media system.\\" The stated vision involves a free media that does not limit democracy, and puts media in the hands of the people. =Purpose of case= In 2003, the Prometheus Radio Group served as the main petitioners in a case against the FCC, where it brought 2003 FCC changes in media ownership rules to court petitioning for a judicial review, along with several other public interest and consumer advocacy groups. They encouraged the court to send the FCC back to the drawing board with a mandate to: 1) Re-examine the citizen testimony in the earlier proceeding, and open up new comment periods on the issue, including allowing for detailed examination of such issues as the addition of non-commercial stations to voice counts and the ill-conceived 'diversity index'. 2) Expand the scope of the \\"localism task force\\" to admit testimony relevant to ownership issues. 3) Clarify that \\"the dismal science\\" of economics is not the only empirical basis for examining issues of media policy\\".Prometheus Oral Arguments http://prometheusradio.org/node/44 Prometheus wanted to point out that economics could be a very weak reason for making decisions, while \\"Sociology, anthropology, and other sciences have quantitative and qualitative contributions to make in the policy process.

In court, Prometheus Radio Project requested a stay on the effective date of the FCC's new ownership rules as outlined in the FCC's 2003 Report and Order, and drafted in the 2002 Biennial Regulatory Review, pending judicial review. The alleged harms from great industry consolidation, were argued to be widespread and irreversible if they were allowed to occur, without harm to any parties if status quo was retained. Extensive oral arguments were heard September 3, leading to the court's decision.2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 18390 =Ruling= The stay was granted, with prior ownership rules ordered to be kept in place, pending a resolution of the proceedings. In doing so, the court considered four factors: the movant's likelihood of success on the merits; whether or not the movant would suffer irreparable harm if the request is denied; whether third parties will be harmed by the stay; and whether granting the stay will serve the public interest. The granting of the stay was based on the principle in administrative law to order status quo be maintained when a serious question is brought before the court, and little harm will befall other parties, while denial would cause irreparable injury on the movant.Susquenita Sch. Dist. v. Raelee, 96 F.3d 78, 80 (3d Cir. 1996)In re Penn Cent. Transp. Co., 457 F.2d 381, 384-85 (3d Cir. 1972) The harm to Prometheus Radio Project absent a stay would include the loss of an appropriate remedy if later the new ownership rules were determined to be invalid. At the same time, the harm to the FCC and other parties was determined to be minimal if a stay was granted. Therefore, the court ordered a judicial review of the merits, and deemed public interest in the outcome important enough to maintain status quo until that time. The stay in no way was the courts opinion siding with Prometheus Radio Group, merely delaying the rules taking effect giving time to be briefed and a resolution to be reached. Third Circuit of appeals (main case) On February 11, 2004, arguments began for the judicial review on the regulations in front of the court. A considerable amount of additional petitioners were added to the case on both sides of the issues, citizen petitioners and deregulatory groups. The 2-1 majority opinion was written by Judge Ambro and filed on June 24, 2004. In summation, the court found that the FCC is required to examine its rules, and determine if they are useful and serving the public interest, making adjustments as necessary. However, regardless of what they determine, the FCC must support each decision with a reasoned analysis. The majority found multiple areas in which they deemed FCC decisions irrational, inconsistent, or not well explained. For this reason they remanded these areas back to the FCC, and found in favor of the Prometheus Radio Group, halting the proposed changes in media ownership rules. =Majority opinion= The court evaluated the degree of each decision that the FCC made and determined whether each was based on sound reasoning, was well justified, and properly explained. I. Mootness and the national television ownership rule During the period that this case made it to trial, Congress passed the 2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which modified the Telecommunications Act of 1996, to change the national audience reach limit for television stations to 39%. Therefore, the challenge to the FCC's decision of raising the national limit from 35% to 45% became moot. UHF discount was a part of this argument, however, in the court's opinion it was considered in Congress' action, though not explicit, and not for the court to question.108th Congress (2003-2004) H.R.2673 II. Cross ownership rules The court examined the FCC's decision to replace the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rules in favor of new cross-media limits. This change had been attacked by groups on both sides, but the court determined that this was within the legal right of the FCC. The court did not, however, uphold the specific limits themselves because in its opinion the FCC did not provide reasoning to support the exact limits that the commission chose. With regards to the FCC's decision to change to the multi- tiered rules, the court agreed with deregulatory groups that it was no longer in the public interest to have blanket bans, agreeing that these bans hurt localism in the news product. The Court, however, did agreed with the FCC that some regulation was still necessary. This is in part because cable and internet were not considered complete substitutes to fill the void of consolidation. The court also dismissed claims that any regulation violated the First or Fifth Amendments. =Diversity index= The court deemed the FCC guilty of making irrational assumptions, and being inconsistent in their formulations of the Diversity Index. In the opinion of the court, the FCC gave too much weight to the internet as a media outlet, and was incorrect to assign outlets of the same media type equal market shares. This led to inconsistent cross-media limits from the Diversity Index results. Internet weight The court agreed with the FCC's decision to discount the effect of cable television, due to their concerns that cable does not effectively provide independent local news, but found that it was irrational to not discount the internet in the same manner. The FCC did not identify which websites were used as sources of local news, which was a problem because many of the local news websites were owned by local television stations and newspapers, thus not contributing to diversity. Same media equal market shares The court also disagreed with the FCC's assumption of equal market shares within the same type of media. The point was raised that the concept of equal share within the same media type was incongruent with entire approach to the Diversity Index, which assigns different weights to different media types. The court determined that this inconsistency was a problem. Empirical evidence also showed that the equal weight assumption could produce absurd results and comparisons in concentration of media. Result specific The court found the specific amounts of ownership allowed to be inconsistent, and impermissible. Some combinations newly allowed caused considerably greater consolidating change in Diversity Index scores than others that were disallowed. The Court found the fact that there was no explanation for the inconsistencies a considerable problem for the new cross- media limits. Therefore, while possessing the right to impose the limits, the FCC did not provide the necessary reasoning for the specific limits chosen, and must do so. =Public notice= The ruling also chastised the FCC for failing to make public the methodology behind the Diversity Index. While the FCC put out notice that it was considering a new metric for determining ownership limits, it never released how it was to be determined or allowed public opinion on the issue. The Court recommended that future metrics be made available before becoming final rule. III. Local television ownership rule With regards to the new local television ownership rule, the Courts upheld many of the regulatory changes made. The court agreed with allowing some consolidation by eliminating the \\"eight voices\\" rule, agreed with the decision to allow triopolies in large markets, as well as using the top-four station restriction. The court remanded for the FCC to justify its decision about a new waiver system for failing stations, in which they no longer had to post notice of the station's availability to out-of-market buyers. The majority did not believe that the FCC had adequately described its reasoning for the change, and stated their belief if would hurt minority ownership of media. They asked that along with a detailed explanation, a report on the impact of minority ownership be submitted. The Court also did not agree with the numerical limits imposed in the ownership. The premise of the equal share assumption was attacked, but its application in determining the situations where duopolies vs. triopolies are permitted created inconsistencies in which markets already saturated past the FCC's stated permissible rate would now legally become even more saturated. The inconsistencies caused by the specific numerical limits caused them to be remanded for reconsideration. IV. Local radio ownership rule In the 1950, Petitioners challenged the FCC's change to local radio ownership rules, limiting the number of stations a company may own in different sized markets, as well as retaining specific numerical limits. The court affirmed the decision to change the rules, but remanded the specific numerical limits, since it believed the specific numbers to be arbitrary. The decision to change the definition of local markets to a geography based system was supported by the Court. Despite attacks that the geography based system shrunk the size of markets, thus reducing the number of stations permitted, as well as that the inclusion of non-commercial stations made markets larger and allowed more stations to be owned, the court determined that the FCC justified its position in both regards, and that their justifications were sufficient. While the numerical limits for ownership were supported by the court, the fact that they simply retained the existing numerical limits was not. Both sides had issue with this, as the believed that it did not follow the reasoning of other steps the commission took, nor fit the mission of establishing five equal sized ownership groups for competitive reasons. The court remanded this decision, and asked for additional justification. The court also remanded the very thinking of the goal to achieve five equal sized competitors. It agreed both with the deregulation groups that claimed that evidence showed no actual or potential for equal sized competitors, as well as the Citizen Petitioners who showed that five competitors was incongruent with the Department of Justice's definition of competition. Since the FCC had used the DOJ standards to justify the television limits it imposed, it was deemed irrational to then ignore DOJ rules for radio limits. Finally, the Court agreed with the deregulation petitioners that the FCC failed to adequately support its decision to place AM/FM subcaps. While it makes sense that FM has technological advantages, it does not explain why there is a need for an AM sub-cap at all. The FCC did not respond to this criticism, and the court remanded it for amendment. V. Conclusion While the Court affirmed most of the FCC's new rules, several problems were highlighted and remanded due to the FCC's lack of justification, or irrationality behind certain rules. Most notably, the derivation of new Cross-Media limits based on the Diversity Index, and the modification of numerical limits on both local television and radio ownership suffered from the irrational assumption that media outlets of the same type make an equal contribution to diversity and competition, especially the internet. =Dissent by Judge Scirica= The dissenting voice of the court belonged to Judge Scirica. While he concurred with many of majority's rulings, he dissented with the decision to order a stay, vacate the regulations, and remand certain rules to the FCC. It was Scirica's opinion that the court upended the way that judiciary reviews agency rule making, as it was his belief that principles of deference be accorded to agency decision-making. He preferred to allow the FCC's media ownership rules to go into effect, as it is not the Court's role to second guess an agency acting within its delegated authority, and substitute its own policy judgment. He preferred to allow the commission the opportunity to monitor and evaluate its policies so that they can adjust them, and assign accountability to rest with the FCC. I. Diversity index and cross-media limits Judge Scirica quotes the earlier FCC v NCCB case in which the Supreme Court ruled that \\"diversity and its effects are‚Ä¶ elusive concepts, not easily defined let alone measured without making qualitative judgments\\".(436 U.S. at 796-97) He also points out that he sides with FCC in that the Diversity Index is not the final rule, nor sole consideration, and as such should be given deference unless specifically shown to be unreasonable. Therefore, any problems with the Diversity Index were insufficient to prevent the FCC rules from taking effect. II. Weight assigned to internet Judge Scirica notes the incredible challenges in determining the size and use of the internet. As it continues to rapidly grow, pinpointing exact numbers are very difficult. He does not agree with the premise that only news reported by 'news organizations' is news, and therefore many little groups, shops, and organizations use their websites to post local 'news'. Due to his disagreement on the definition of 'news', and the difficulty overall in pinpointing internet numbers, he does not believe there is sufficient enough proof that the FCC was incorrect in its determination, and as such should be given deference. III. Equal shares within same media Scirica admits that equal shares within the same media may not be the perfect methodology, but he points to the great constraints and constant changes that exist in determining market shares for different stations. In light of this point, as well as the difficulties in practice with other methods, he errors on the side of the Commission, and does not find this decision to be arbitrary, capricious, or reason to hold up the implementation of FCC rules. This causes him not to agree with the majority and take issue with either local television ownership rules or local radio ownership rules. He would not grant a stay of these new regulations, and rather believes the FCC should be given the chance to monitor their own policies and make adjustments as necessary. IV. Conclusion In conclusion, Judge Scirica noted the authority that the FCC had in this sphere. While not all elements perfect, he believed the Commission must be left to their best judgment, and allow them to take the responsibility to make changes as necessary. In his opinion none of the rules were egregious, or irrational. Therefore, the court should not substitute its own fears and opinions for those of the commission. He would affirm the FCC rules, denying the petitioner's request, and allow the new regulations to take effect immediately. Impact =Policy questions= The policy question addressed by the court had to with the responsibilities of the FCC when making changes to rules and regulations. The court confirmed that the leading principles of the FCC were to be localism and diversity, as well as the authority to impact an area so vital to the public, and scarce. The impact of the ruling was not that the FCC did not have the right or authority to regulate media ownership limits, but rather than in all cases where status quo is changed, it is the responsibility of the commission to articulate and prove that the changes are in the public interest, through rational analysis and explanation. The benefit of the doubt is given to the status quo, unless an agency can prove that changes result in positive effects for the public interest. Proving diversity was shown to be difficult because it is inherently different from welfare or efficiency. As Johannes Bauer and Steven Wildman noted in the Federal Communications Law Journal, \\"By no stretch of the imagination could it be said that new ownership policies were produced through application of a welfare calculus employed to identify new policy optima. The calculus simply did not exist. While the definition of economic surplus that would presumably be central to the efficiency component of such a calculus was conceptually clear and in principle measurable, the same could not be said for diversity.\\" The problem is that diversity is not a clear concept, and therefore difficult to prove.Johannes M. Bauer * and Steven S. Wildman, \\"Looking Backwards and Looking Forwards in Contemplating the Next Rewrite of the Communications Act\\", Federal Communications Law Journal June, 2006 58 Fed. Comm. L.J. 415 =Opinions= The Media Access Project, one of the additional petitioners in the case, summed up the victory as the court \\"effectively deciding that preserving democracy is more important than helping big media companies grow bigger.\\" They viewed it as a directly impacting people's First Amendment rights to freely express themselves and the views of their communities through local and national media outlets.\\"Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC, According to Aaron Perzanowski of the Berkeley Law Review, the case points to the need for Congress to step up its role in disputes of regulation. Rather than delegate the decisions to agencies and commissions, Congress needs to reassert itself as the final arbiter of media policy. Perzanowski bases this on a belief that \\"Media concentration, because it results in an ever-decreasing number of sources of publicly available information, poses a serious threat to the development of an informed public.\\"Perzanowski, Aaron. \\"Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC: the persistence of scarcity.\\" Berkeley Technology Law Journal 20.1 (2005): 743-764. LegalTrac. Web. 19 Apr. 2011. Stephanie DeClerk of the Arkansas Law Review believed that the outcome of the case would force the FCC to take a look at heading in a different direction, saying: \\"Hopefully, the FCC will begin to recognize the drawbacks of media ownership deregulation and will begin to \\"create new media rules for the [twenty-first] century that foster diversity and protect local media\\".Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC: Where Will the Media Deregulation Trend End?*, 58 Ark. L. Rev. 705 Writing in Communication Law and Policy, David Pritchard, Christopher Terry and Paul R Brewer did not agree with the ruling, or the premises behind the Citizen Activist groups. In a series of studies, they found that the proprietors of the cross-ownerships in their study permitted their media outlets to publish and broadcast a diversity of viewpoints. What is more, the slant of news and opinion in non-cross-owned media was not significantly different from that of cross-owned media. At least in the context of newspaper-broadcast cross- ownership, such findings undermine the premise that each media owner constitutes a single voice on important subjects such as presidential elections.ONE OWNER, ONE VOICE? TESTING A CENTRAL PREMISE OF NEWSPAPER- BROADCAST CROSS-OWNERSHIP POLICY, Communication Law and Policy Winter, 2008 13 Comm. L. & Pol'y 1 Daniel Ho and Kevin Quinn wrote an article in the Federal Communications Law Journal showing that consolidation of the media industry is not the danger many report it to be. Their results show stability in viewpoints for three conglomerate acquisitions. \\"In short, consolidation does not inexorably lead to convergence or divergence. Our article purposely adopts a broad view of empirical inquiry as encompassing both quantitative and qualitative research.\\"Daniel E. Ho and Kevin M.

L.J. 673 Following court cases =Supreme Court= Following the decision of the Third Court of Appeals against them, the FCC and the United States filed for the case to be heard by Supreme Court. Federal Communications Commission and United States, Petitioners v. Prometheus Radio Project, et al. (No. 04-1168.) was decided on June 13, 2005. The petition for writ of certiorari to the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit was denied. The Supreme Court was made up of Justices Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer at the time. Judge Breyer, however, did not take part in the decision or consideration of the petition. =Subsequent appeals= After the decision of the case, the FCC reevaluated all of the points that had been remanded. Following tweaks and modifications, along with justifying certain elements they had previously made, they returned to court to have the stay lifted. In 2009, the Third Court of Appeals revisited the case on April 14 (Nos. 08-3078 et al.) With judges Scirica, Ambro, and Fuentes once again on the bench, the court granted the foregoing motion to hold cases in abeyance pending further order of the Court. The opinion was issued by Chief Judge Scirica, and ordered the parties to show cause within twenty-one days why the stay that was ordered by the court in the original case, as well as the 2004 main case, should not be lifted. The parties were ordered to electronically submit briefs to make their case.[2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 2882] On June 12 the court reconvened on the case. After considering the briefs issued to the court by all parties, the opinion of the court was that the stay would remain in effect, pending further order of the Court. The court asked the parties to issue status reports by October 1, 2009, including whether the stay should be lifted at that time. The Court asked that all parties also promptly advise the Court if any new developments arose that would be material to the case.[2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 28819] Reversal After reviewing the status reports from previous cases, as well as additional reports in the interim, the Court met on March 23, 2010. During this session, the Court issued the opinion that after reviewing all updated information, the FCC had fulfilled its obligations on remanded portions, and the court decided to lift all stays entered by the court during the series of Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC cases. Under the schedule put forth by the court, Prometheus Radio Project and all intervenor petitioners had to file briefs by May 17, 2010. Thirty days after all petitioner briefs were received, the FCC was required to submit their brief. If necessary, Prometheus Radio Project had fourteen days following the FCC brief to file a reply brief. At that point the order of the court was to be considered final, and the stay on FCC media ownership rules fully lifted.

Historians have emphasized the importance of gunpowder technology, new styles of fortification to resist cannon fire, and the increased professionalization of the soldiers. Operations =Mediterranean campaigns= Henry II remitting the Order of Saint-Michel to Marshall de Tavannes after the Battle of Renty, on 13 August 1554 Henry II sealed a treaty with Suleiman the Magnificent in order to cooperate against the Habsburgs in the Mediterranean.Miller, p.2 This was triggered by the conquest of Mahdiya by the Genoese Admiral Andrea Doria on 8 September 1550, for the account of Charles V. The alliance allowed Henry II to push for French conquests towards the Rhine, while a Franco-Ottoman fleet defended southern France. The 1551 Ottoman Siege of Tripoli was the first step of the all-out Italian War of 1551‚Äì59 in the European theater, and in the Mediterranean the French galleys of Marseille were ordered to join the Ottoman fleet. In 1552, when Henry II attacked Charles V, the Ottomans sent 100 galleys to the Western Mediterranean, which were accompanied by three French galleys under Gabriel de Luetz d'Aramon in their raids along the coast of Calabria in Southern Italy, capturing the city of Reggio. In the Battle of Ponza in front of the island of Ponza, the fleet met with 40 galleys of Andrea Doria, and managed to vanquish the Genoese and capture seven galleys. This alliance would also lead to the combined Invasion of Corsica in 1553. The Ottomans continued harassing the Habsburg possessions with various operations in the Mediterranean, such as the Ottoman invasion of the Balearic islands in 1558, following a request by Henry II.Setton, pp. 698ff. =Land campaigns= On the Continental front, Henry II allied with German Protestant princes at the Treaty of Chambord in 1552. An early offensive into Lorraine, in the Second Schmalkadic War, was successful, with Henry capturing the three episcopal cities of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, and securing them by defeating the invading Habsburg army at the Battle of Renty in 1554. However, the French invasion of Tuscany in 1553, in support of Siena, attacked by an Imperial‚ÄêFlorentine army, was defeated at the Battle of Marciano by Gian Giacomo Medici in 1554. Siena fell in 1555 and eventually became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany founded by Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. A treaty in Vaucelles was signed on 5 February 1556 between Charles V and Henry II of France. After Emperor Charles' abdication in 1556 split the Habsburg empire between Philip II of Spain and Ferdinand I, the focus of the war shifted to Flanders. However, the truce was broken shortly afterwards. Pope Paul IV was displeased and urged Henry II to join the Papal States in an invasion of Spanish Naples. On 1 September 1556, Philip II responded by pre- emptively invading the Papal States with 12,000 men under the Duke of Alba, but French forces approaching from the north were defeated and forced to withdraw at Civitella in August 1557. The Spanish attempted to blockade Rome by occupying the port of Ostia, but were driven back by the Papal armies in a surprise attack. However, when French troops were unable to come to their aid, the Papal armies were left exposed and were defeated, with Spanish troops arriving at the edge of Rome. Out of fear of another sack of Rome, Paul IV agreed to the Duke of Alba's demand for the Papal States to declare neutrality. Emperor Charles V criticized the peace agreement as being overly generous to the Pope. Philip, in conjunction with Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy, defeated the French at St. Quentin. England's entry into the war later that year led to the French capture of Calais, and French armies plundered Spanish possessions in the Low Countries. Nonetheless, Henry was forced to accept a peace agreement in which he renounced any further claims to Italy. The wars ended for other reasons, including \\"the Double Default of 1557\\", when the Spanish Empire, followed quickly by the French, defaulted on its debts. In addition, Henry II had to confront a growing Protestant movement at home, which he hoped to crush. =Military technology= Oman (1937) argues that the inconclusive campaigns which generally lack a decisive engagement were largely due to an effective leadership and lack of offensive spirit. He notes that mercenary troops were used too often and proved unreliable. Hale emphasizes the defensive strength of bastion forts newly designed at angles to dissipate cannon fire. Cavalry, which had traditionally used shock tactics to overawe the infantry, largely abandoned them and relied on pistol attacks by successive ranks of attackers. Hale notes the use of old-fashioned mass formations, which he attributes to lingering conservatism. Overall, Hale emphasizes new levels of tactical proficiency. = Finance = In 1552 Charles V had borrowed over 4 million ducats, with the Metz campaign alone costing 2.5 million ducats. Shipments of treasure from the Indies totalled over two million ducats between 1552 and 1553. By 1554, the cash deficit for the year was calculated to be over 4.3 million ducats, even after all tax receipts for the six ensuing years had been pledged and the proceeds spent in advance. Credit at this point began costing the crown 43 percent interest (largely financed by the Fugger and Welser banking families). By 1557 the crown was refusing payment from the Indies since even this was required for payment of the war effort (used in the offensive and Spanish victory at the battle of St. Quentin in August 1557). French finances during the war were mainly financed by the increase in the taille tax, as well as indirect taxes like the gabelle and customs fees. The French monarchy also resorted to heavy borrowings during the war from financiers at rates of 10‚Äì16 percent interest. The taille was estimated in collection for 1551 at around six million livres. During the 1550s, Spain had an estimated military manpower of around 150,000 soldiers, whereas France had an estimated manpower of 50,000.  Peace of Cateau- Cambr√©sis (1559)  = Summary = The Peace of Cateau-Cambr√©sis (1559) consisted of two treaties: the first one was signed between Elizabeth I of England and Henri II of France on April 2; the second one was signed between Henri II of France and Philip II of Spain on April 3.Treccani encyclopedia The two treaties also defined the conclusion of the Imperial-French wars, and therefore the end of the Habsburg-Valois conflict as a whole, with the approval of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. The four monarchs did not meet in person; they were represented by ambassadors and delegations. Some Italian states also attended the conference. The peace was facilitated by the abdication of Charles V in 1556 and the division of the Habsburg empire between Spain and Austria: Philip II of Spain received the kingdoms of Spain, southern Italy (Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia) and the colonies in the Americas; and Ferdinand of Austria became ruler of the Holy Roman Empire extending from Germany to northern Italy, with suo jure control of the Danube monarchy. The Duchy of Milan and the Habsburg Netherlands were left in personal union to the King of Spain while continuing to be part of the Holy Roman Empire. With the end of the personal union of the Holy Roman Empire and Spain (\\"Habsburg encirclement\\"), France was open to peace talks. A truce was reached in Vaucelles around 1556, but it was broken shortly after. The condition of economic and religious turmoil in which the war resumed forced the parties to make peace in 1559. By the terms of the treaties, France ended military operations in the Spanish Netherlands and the Imperial fiefs of northern Italy bringing an end to most of the French occupation in Corsica, Tuscany and Piedmont. England and the Habsburgs, in exchange, ended their opposition to French occupation of the Pale of Calais, the Three Bishoprics, and a number of fortresses. For Spain, despite no new gains and the restoration of some occupied territories to France, the peace was a positive result as it confirmed its control of the Habsburg Netherlands, the Duchy of Milan, and southern Italy (Sardinia, Naples, Sicily). Ferdinand I left the Three Bishoprics under French occupation, but the Netherlands and most of northern Italy remained part of the Holy Roman Empire in the form of imperial fiefs. Furthermore, his position of Holy Roman Emperor was recognized by the Pope who had refused to do so as long as the war between France and the Habsburgs continued. England fared poorly during the war, and the loss of its last stronghold on the continent damaged its reputation. At the end of the conflict, Italy was therefore divided between viceroyalties of the Spanish Habsburgs in the south and formal fiefs of the Austrian Habsburgs in the north. The imperial states were ruled by the Medici in Tuscany, the Spanish Habsburgs in Milan, the Estensi in Modena, and an Italianized House of Savoy in Piedmont. The southern Kingdoms of Naples, Sicily and Sardinia were under direct rule of the Spanish Habsburgs. This situation continued until the European wars of succession of the 18th century, when northern Italy passed to the Austrian house of Habsburg-Lorraine and the south passed to the Spanish Bourbons. The Papacy in central Italy maintained major cultural and political influence during the Catholic Reformation initiated by the conclusion of the Tridentine council (resumed by the terms of the treaty). = Clauses = Map of Italy in 1559 after the Treaties of Cateau-Cambr√©sis According to the treaties signed in Le Cateau-Cambr√©sis: *Henry II of France renounced his hereditary claim to the Duchy of Milan (held by Spain and fief of the Holy Roman Empire) and recognised Spanish control over the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sicily, and the Kingdom of Sardinia. *France ceded the island of Corsica to the Republic of Genoa (fief of the Holy Roman Empire and allied with Spain). French and Genoese merchants were granted full access to each other's ports.Setton, 709. *France gave the Duchy of Savoy‚ÄìPiedmont (allied with Spain and fief of the Holy Roman Empire) back to Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy due to his victory at St. Quentin. Savoy declared neutrality between the Spain and France, and later moved its capital to Turin. *France retained five fortresses in Northern Italy, including those near Turin, Saluzzo and Pinerolo (Pignerol). *France retained the Three Bishoprics of Toul, Metz and Verdun (seized from Charles V during the Second Schmalkaldic War in 1552). *France retained the Pale of Calais (seized from England in 1558). *France retained Saint Quentin, Ham, Le Catelet and other places in northern France seized by Spain during the war. *The Republic of Florence (fief of the Holy Roman Empire and allied with Spain) absorbed the Republic of Siena (allied with France) into what became the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. *The March of Montferrat was given back to Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua (fief of the Holy Roman Empire and allied with Spain). * All signatories of the treaty needed to 'purge their lands of heresy'; in other words, all their subjects had to be forcefully reverted to Catholicism. When pressured by Spain to implement this obligation, Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy proclaimed the Edict of Nice (15 February 1560), prohibiting Protestantism on pains of a large fine, enslavement or banishment, which soon led to an armed revolt by the Protestant Waldensians in his domain that would last until July 1561. *Henri II of France and Philip II of Spain agreed in the treaty to ask the Pope and Emperor Ferdinand to reconvene the Council of Trent. The peace allowed Ferdinand to be recognized as Emperor by the Pope. Setton, 708. = Celebrations = Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy married Margaret of France, Duchess of Berry, the sister of Henry II of France. Philip II of Spain married Elisabeth, the daughter of Henry II of France. Henry died during a tournament when a sliver from the shattered lance of Gabriel Montgomery, captain of the Scottish Guard at the French Court, pierced his eye and entered his brain. The death of Henry II caused his 15-year-old son Francis II to take the throne, beginning a period of political instability that ultimately led to the French Wars of Religion.

Currents formally behave like Schwartz distributions on a space of differential forms, but in a geometric setting, they can represent integration over a submanifold, generalizing the Dirac delta function, or more generally even directional derivatives of delta functions (multipoles) spread out along subsets of M. Definition Let \\\\Omega_c^m(M) denote the space of smooth m-forms with compact support on a smooth manifold M. A current is a linear functional on \\\\Omega_c^m(M) which is continuous in the sense of distributions. Thus a linear functional :T\\\\colon \\\\Omega_c^m(M)\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} is an m-dimensional current if it is continuous in the following sense: If a sequence \\\\omega_k of smooth forms, all supported in the same compact set, is such that all derivatives of all their coefficients tend uniformly to 0 when k tends to infinity, then T(\\\\omega_k) tends to 0. The space \\\\mathcal D_m(M) of m-dimensional currents on M is a real vector space with operations defined by :(T+S)(\\\\omega):= T(\\\\omega)+S(\\\\omega),\\\\qquad (\\\\lambda T)(\\\\omega):=\\\\lambda T(\\\\omega). Much of the theory of distributions carries over to currents with minimal adjustments. For example, one may define the support of a current T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}_m(M) as the complement of the biggest open set U \\\\subset M such that :T(\\\\omega) = 0 whenever \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega_c^m(U) The linear subspace of \\\\mathcal D_m(M) consisting of currents with support (in the sense above) that is a compact subset of M is denoted \\\\mathcal E_m(M). Homological theory Integration over a compact rectifiable oriented submanifold M (with boundary) of dimension m defines an m-current, denoted by M: :M(\\\\omega)=\\\\int_M \\\\omega.\\\\, If the boundary ‚àÇM of M is rectifiable, then it too defines a current by integration, and by virtue of Stokes' theorem one has: :\\\\partial M(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{\\\\partial M}\\\\omega = \\\\int_M d\\\\omega = M(d\\\\omega). This relates the exterior derivative d with the boundary operator ‚àÇ on the homology of M. In view of this formula we can define a boundary operator on arbitrary currents :\\\\partial\\\\colon \\\\mathcal D_{m+1} \\\\to \\\\mathcal D_m via duality with the exterior derivative by :(\\\\partial T)(\\\\omega) := T(d\\\\omega)\\\\, for all compactly supported m-forms œâ. Certain subclasses of currents which are closed under \\\\partial can be used instead of all currents to create a homology theory, which can satisfy the Eilenberg‚ÄìSteenrod axioms in certain cases. A classical example is the subclass of integral currents on Lipschitz neighborhood retracts. Topology and norms The space of currents is naturally endowed with the weak-* topology, which will be further simply called weak convergence. A sequence Tk of currents, converges to a current T if :T_k(\\\\omega) \\\\to T(\\\\omega),\\\\qquad \\\\forall \\\\omega.\\\\, It is possible to define several norms on subspaces of the space of all currents. One such norm is the mass norm. If œâ is an m-form, then define its comass by : \\\\\\\\omega\\\\ := \\\\sup\\\\\\\\{\\\\langle \\\\omega,\\\\xi\\\\rangle\\\\colon\\\\xi \\\\mbox{ is a unit, simple, }m\\\\mbox{-vector}\\\\\\\\}. So if œâ is a simple m-form, then its mass norm is the usual L‚àû-norm of its coefficient. The mass of a current T is then defined as :\\\\mathbf M (T) := \\\\sup\\\\\\\\{ T(\\\\omega)\\\\colon \\\\sup_x \\\\vert\\\\omega(x)\\\\vert\\\\le 1\\\\\\\\}. The mass of a current represents the weighted area of the generalized surface. A current such that M(T) < ‚àû is representable by integration of a regular Borel measure by a version of the Riesz representation theorem. This is the starting point of homological integration. An intermediate norm is Whitney's flat norm, defined by : \\\\mathbf F (T) := \\\\inf \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf M(T - \\\\partial A) + \\\\mathbf M(A) \\\\colon A\\\\in\\\\mathcal E_{m+1}\\\\\\\\}. Two currents are close in the mass norm if they coincide away from a small part. On the other hand, they are close in the flat norm if they coincide up to a small deformation. Examples Recall that :\\\\Omega_c^0(\\\\mathbb{R}^n)\\\\equiv C^\\\\infty_c(\\\\mathbb{R}^n)\\\\, so that the following defines a 0-current: :T(f) = f(0).\\\\, In particular every signed regular measure \\\\mu is a 0-current: :T(f) = \\\\int f(x)\\\\, d\\\\mu(x). Let (x, y, z) be the coordinates in ‚Ñù3. Then the following defines a 2-current (one of many): : T(a\\\\,dx\\\\wedge dy + b\\\\,dy\\\\wedge dz + c\\\\,dx\\\\wedge dz) = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\int_0^1 b(x,y,0)\\\\, dx \\\\, dy.

This can be used as a countermeasure against various spoofing attacks where the attacker's packets contain fake IP addresses to make it difficult to find the source of the attack. This technique is often used in the denial-of-service attack, and this is a primary target of ingress filtering.  Problem  Networks receive packets from other networks. Normally a packet will contain the IP address of the computer that originally sent it. This allows devices in the receiving network to know where it came from, allowing a reply to be routed back (amongst other things), except when IP addresses are used through a proxy or a spoofed IP address, which does not pinpoint a specific user within that pool of users. A sender IP address can be faked ('spoofed'), characterising a spoofing attack. This disguises the origin of packets sent, for example in a denial-of-service attack. The same holds true for proxies, although in a different manner than \\"IP spoofing.\\"  Potential solutions  One potential solution involves implementing the use of intermediate Internet gateways (i.e., those servers connecting disparate networks along the path followed by any given packet) filtering or denying any packet deemed to be illegitimate. The gateway processing the packet might simply ignore the packet completely, or where possible, it might send a packet back to the sender relaying a message that the illegitimate packet has been denied. Host intrusion prevention systems (HIPS) are one example of technical engineering applications that help to identify, prevent and/or deter unwanted, unsuspected and/or suspicious events and intrusions. Any router that implements ingress filtering checks the source IP field of IP packets it receives, and drops packets if the packets don't have an IP address in the IP address block, to which the interface is connected. This may not be possible if the end host is multi-homed and also sends transit network traffic. In ingress filtering, packets coming into the network are filtered if the network sending it should not send packets from the originating IP address(es). If the end host is a stub network or host, the router needs to filter all IP packets that have, as the source IP, private addresses (RFC 1918), bogon addresses or addresses that do not have the same network address as the interface.Robert Gezelter (1995) Security on the Internet Chapter 23 in Hutt, Bosworth, and Hoytt (1995) \\"Computer Security Handbook, Third Edition\\", Wiley, section 23.6(b), pp 23-12, et seq. Networks Network ingress filtering is a packet filtering technique used by many Internet service providers to try to prevent source address spoofing of Internet traffic, and thus indirectly combat various types of net abuse by making Internet traffic traceable to its source. Network ingress filtering is a \\"good neighbor\\" policy which relies on cooperation between ISPs for their mutual benefit. The best current practices for network ingress filtering are documented by the Internet Engineering Task Force in BCP 38 and BCP 84, which are defined by RFC 2827 and RFC 3704, respectively. BCP 84 recommends that upstream providers of IP connectivity filter packets entering their networks from downstream customers, and discard any packets which have a source address which is not allocated to that customer. There are many possible ways of implementing this policy; one common mechanism is to enable reverse path forwarding on links to customers, which will indirectly apply this policy based on the provider's route filtering of their customers' route announcements.  Deployment  As of 2012, one report suggests that, contrary to general opinion about the lack of BCP 38 deployment, some 80% of the Internet (by various measures) were already applying anti-spoofing packet filtering in their networks.

Some scholars suggest it was established as an independent city-state from the middle of the tenth century BCE, maintained its autonomy for about a century until it was annexed in the third quarter of the ninth century by Hazael, the king of Aram. Et-Tell was also settled in the first century CE and is a candidate for the New Testament's town of Bethsaida. Location Geshur is identified with the area stretching along the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee and reaching south up to the Yarmuk River. Israeli archaeologists are holding this view and therefore place Geshur in what is now the southern Golan Heights.Rediscovered! The Land of Geshur, Moshe Kochavi, Timothy Renner, Ira Spar and Esther Yadin, BAR 18:04, Jul/Aug 1992 This location places it on one of the routes connecting the region of Bashan with the Phoenician coast. Tel Dover, located southeast of the Sea of Galilee on the Jarmuk (Yarmuk) River, may have been the kingdom's southern border. Surveys conducted within the Golan Heights have not discovered many settlements within the territory of Geshur. Religion Excavations of et-Tell have revealed evidence of the Geshurite religious practices including high places, decorated stelae, offering vessels, sacrificial animals and dedicatory inscriptions. This material culture reveals strong influences from neighbouring countries. Their religious worship appears to have centered around worship of the moon-god in the form of a bull which was common in southern Syria, whilst an Egyptian influence can be seen in their art and amulets. The bull stele from the city gate has alternatively been interpreted as either a symbol of the chief god Hadad, in charge of rainfall; the moon god, who brought about the swelling of the rivers; or a combination of the two. Cultic stele, Bethsaida, Iron Age II, 9th-8th century BCE. From The Israel Museum, Publisher: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 2005 The influence of the Israelite religion to the south may be seen in dietary practices and the selection of sacrificial animals. Historical sources =Hebrew Bible= The name \\"Geshur\\" is found primarily in biblical sources and has been taken to mean \\"stronghold or fortress\\". The Bible describes it as being near Bashan, adjoining the province of Argob () and the kingdom of Aram or Syria (; ). According to the Bible, it was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh which settled east of the Jordan river, but its inhabitants, the Geshurites, could not be expelled (). reports that David undertook raids against the Geshurites while stationed in Ziklag in the kingdom of Gath. In the time of David's rule over Israel, Geshur was an independent Aramean kingdom, and David married Maachah, a daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur (, ). Her son Absalom fled to his mother's native country after the murder of his half-brother and David's eldest son, Amnon. Absalom stayed there for three years before being rehabilitated by David (ib. , ). By the 9th century BCE the kingdom of Geshur had disappeared from history. =Amarna Letters= Two of the Late Bronze Age Amarna Letters (EA 256 and EA 364) identify 'the land of Garu', as a disputed territory in the Golan between the city states of Hazor and Ashtaroth. Some scholars believe that this 'Garu' is identical with the biblical Geshur, although this is contested by others who contend that it is based on a \\"hypothetical and disputed assumption\\". =Statue of Shalamaneser III= Some scholars believe the inscription on the broken statue of Shalmaneser III that describes cities captured by him may include the phrase \\"the Geshurite seized my feet. I received his tribute\\", although this is by no means certain. Archaeology =Capital at et-Tell= Archaeologists tend to agree that the capital of the kingdom was situated at et-Tell, a place also inhabited on a lesser scale during the first centuries BCE and CE and sometimes identified with the town of Bethsaida of New Testament fame. Imposing archaeological finds, mainly the Stratum V city gate, date to the post-Geshurite 8th century BCE, but there are indications, as of 2016, that the archaeologists are close to locating the 10th-century BCE, that is: Geshurite, city gate as well. The et-Tell site would have been easily the largest and strongest city to the east of the Jordan Valley during Iron II era. =Tel Hadar= Tel Hadar is a small site located on the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee which archaeological surveys have revealed as containing architectural features distinct from those of ancient Israel. Some archaeologists have suggested the site may have been under the control of Geshur. =Tel Dover= This small Iron I-IIa settlement located southeast of Galilee near the Yarmuk River may have marked the southern border of the kingdom.

John Holland was the son of a mariner, Philip Holland, a friend of Samuel Pepys who served as captain of during the Baltic Expedition of 1659. Holland was a merchant of the Staple, and probably a member of the Mercers' Company, London. He had partially retired when, on the suggestion of a Scottish friend, he projected the Bank of Scotland which was established by act of the Scottish parliament in 1695, in the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland. The new bank opened its first branches in 1696. Holland was elected the first governor, and ultimately possessed seventy-four shares. One of the directors was James Foulis, with whom Holland had been associated in a scheme for introducing the manufacture of Colchester baizes into Scotland in June 1693. The bank made at first slow progress, with opposition from the African Company, which started a banking business in defiance of the bank's charter, and from the Bank of England. Holland managed the bank successfully through the early difficulties. In recognition of his services, the company presented him with a silver cistern, which in his will he directed to be reserved as a family heirloom. With his son Richard he drew up a scheme for the establishment of a bank in Ireland. He died at Brewood Hall, Staffordshire, in 1722, and was buried in the church there.

It was one of thousands of French-American hybrid grapes developed by scientists to combat powdery mildew and phylloxera, which infiltrated France in the 18th century. The naturally resistant American grape Vitis labrusca was combined with Europe's Vitis vinifera to prevent the eradication of Europe's vineyards. It was introduced to Canada in 1946 and was registered in the United States in 1948. There is anecdotal evidence that it existed in Oregon prior to 1946. It largely disappeared within the next decade, due to its susceptibility to Tomato Ringspot Virus. = Offspring = Ventura grapes, a hybrid of Chelois and Elvira. In 1974, Chelois was crossed with Elvira (a white grape) to produce a hybrid called Ventura, designated as a white grape. The Ventura grape is very productive and cold hardy. Viticulture Chelois grapevines are vigorous and productive with an upright growth habit. The buds break late, reducing the risk of damage due to late frost. It ripens early. Secondary buds are capable of producing a small crop. To prevent over cropping, it may be necessary to thin clusters. Chelois is highly susceptible to Botrytis bunch rot, Eutypa die back, Phomopsis stem and leaf spot, and powdery mildew. It is also susceptible to crown gall, black rot, downy mildew and anthracnose, but to a lesser degree. It is moderately hardy in cold temperatures (-10 to -15 ¬∞F).

Cushing, daughter of Commander Cushing. The ship was commissioned on 28 August 1936, with Commander E. T. Short in command and reported to the Pacific Fleet. Cushing joined the search in the Hawaiian Islands and at Howland Island, for the missing aviator Amelia Earhart from 4 to 30 July 1937, then returned to San Diego, California for training exercises, tactics, and fleet problems. Except for brief periods of training at Pearl Harbor and one cruise to the Caribbean, she cruised the west coast from San Diego for exercises and training. World War II Undergoing overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor, Cushing sailed from San Francisco, California 17 December 1941 for convoy escort duty between the West Coast and Pearl Harbor until 13 January 1942. She sailed to Midway to serve on antisubmarine patrol from 18 January to 2 February, then returned to San Francisco 19 February to screen TF 1 off the California coast in training and patrol duty. On 1 August 1942, Cushing departed San Francisco for training exercises at Pearl Harbor, then to join the operations around Guadalcanal. Constantly on the move, she escorted vital resupply convoys to the bitterly contested island, and fought in the Battle of Santa Cruz of 26 October, when an outnumbered American force turned a Japanese flotilla back from their advance toward Guadalcanal. Fate Cushing screened transports safely into Guadalcanal on 12 November 1942, and was in the van of the force that moved out to intercept the Japanese fleet in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on the night of 13 November 1942. As the range closed, she suddenly sighted three enemy destroyers at . In the bitter gunfire which followed Cushing received several hits amidships, resulting in a gradual power loss, but she determinedly continued to fire her guns at the enemy, launching her torpedoes by local direction at an enemy battleship. Fires, exploding ammunition, and her inability to shoot any longer made the \\"abandon ship\\" order unavoidable at 0230. Her burning hulk was last seen from Guadalcanal at 1700 when she sank about southeast of Savo Island. Cushing lost about 70 men killed or missing; some men were rescued from the water, and many were wounded. Despite the loss, along with the task force, she had aided in saving Guadalcanal's Henderson Field from bombardment by the Japanese forces. Her hulk currently rests at the bottom of the waters around Savo Island, in an area around Guadalcanal known as \\"Ironbottom Sound\\". Awards Cushing received three battle stars for World War II service.

A Confederate States Army officer who at various times aligned with the Conservative Party of Virginia, the Readjuster Party and the Democratic Party, Riddleberger served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, which elected him for one term as U.S. Senator (from 1883 to 1889). Early life Riddleberger was born in Edinburg, Virginia in Shenandoah County to the former Susan Shyrock, whose father owned considerable land in Edinburgh. His father, Madison Riddleberger was a gunsmith and stagecoach driver who had moved from Botetourt County and joined the local militia as a private by 1835. The family included an elder sister Louisa C. Riddleberger Grandstaff (1832‚Äì1908) as well as a younger brother William Riddleberger (1847-1920). Another boy, Henry W Riddleberger died when Harrison was an infant. Harrison Riddleberger received enough schooling at the local private academies to begin working as a clerk in a local store when he was 15 (in 1858).John W. Wayland, A History of Shenandoah County, Virginia (Strasburg: Shenandoah Publishing House 1926; reprinted 1976) p. 554 Two years later, he organized a local cavalry company in Harrisonburg.Wayland p. 554 His father owned two slaves in the 1830 and 1840 federal censuses, and in the latter census the Riddleberger household also included a free black woman.1830 U.S. Federal Census for Shenandoah County, Virginia p. of 1840 U.S. Federal Census for Shenandoah County, Virginia p. of American Civil War During the spring of 1862 as American Civil War continued, Edinburgh became a base for Confederate Captain Turner Ashby during General Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign. Riddleberger volunteered for the Confederate Army and was commissioned a first lieutenant in the 10th Virginia Infantry on April 22, 1862, helping to lead Company C. He participated in the Second Battle of Bull Run, then was on sick leave in September and October 1862 and was accidentally shot in the foot on October 22, 1862. In January 1863, Riddleberger was sent as a recruiting officer to his native Shenandoah Valley. Terrence V. Murphy, 10th Virginia Infantry (Lynchburg: H.E. Hward, Inc., The Virginia Regimental Histories Series 1996) p. 169 and also acted as a scout for Union troop movements.Wayland p. 554 Riddleberger re-enlisted on November 21, 1863, bought a Confederate saddle and equipment, and rose to become Captain of company G of the 23rd Virginia Cavalry. However, on May 14, 1864, Union forces captured Capt. Riddleberger at Edinburg and sent him as a prisoner of war to Wheeling's Atheneum Prison. He spent most of the rest of the war as a P.O.W., being transferred to Camp Chase in Ohio, then Point Lookout, Maryland and historic Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland before being transferred back to Point Lookout, where he was released upon taking the oath of allegiance as the war ended.Richard B> Kleese, 23rd Virginia Cavalry (Lynchburg: H.E. Howard, Inc., The Virginia Regimental Histories Series 1996) p. 90 One account has him being transferred in a prisoner exchange in early 1865, but being recaptured less than a month later.https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Riddleberger_Harrison_H_1843-1890 Career After the war, Riddleberger again became a clerk in Woodstock, as well as taught school and began a newspaper, the Tenth Legion Banner. By 1870, intrigued by reading a copy of Blackstone's Commentaries while imprisoned at Camp Chase, Riddleberger began reading law under the guidance of former Confederate officer Henry C. Allen, the son of judge John J. Allen and whose grandfather had been a judge in Woodstock (and whose relative may have volunteered in Hardy County for cavalry service under Riddleberger). Riddleberger moved to Woodstock, the Shenandoah County seat, and began editing the Shenandoah Herald. Admitted to the Virginia bar, Riddleberger opened his legal practice in Woodstock.EV =Virginia politician and newspaperman= After reapportionment following the 1870 census, and re-enfranchisement of many Confederates, Riddleberger ran for one of what had become Shenandoah County's two seats in the Virginia House of Delegates. He won election and re- election as a Conservative, serving first alongside James W. Smoot, then John W. R. Monroe.Leonard pp. 515, 519 Until 1875, Riddleberger was on the Conservative Party's state committee, but he was a Democratic presidential elector in 1876.Wayland p. 556 In 1876, Riddleberger won election as the Commonwealth attorney (local prosecutor) for Shenandoah County, and won re- election once, serving until 1883.EV Although Riddleberger failed in his first attempt to win election to the state Senate in 1875,Wayland p. 554 in 1879, he was elected to the state Senate representing Shenandoah and Page counties and served one term (until 1882).Leonard pp. 531, 535 During this period Riddleberger also edited and published newspapers at Woodstock, first the Shenandoah Democrat and after 1880 the Virginian. Beginning in 1884, Riddleberger and his wife would own and publish the Shenandoah Herald. In the late 1870s, Riddleberger joined former Confederate general and railroad builder William Mahone (supported by the Richmond Whig newspaper) in forming a coalition of blacks, Republicans, and populist Democrats which became known as the Readjuster Party. The Readjusters dominated Virginia's politics for about 10 years, until a group of \\"Conservative\\" Democrats led by John S. Barbour, Jr. (who would succeed Riddleberger) took power in the late 1880s. Riddleberger was one of the Readjuster party's presidential electors in 1880, but pledged to vote for the Democratic candidate. Riddleberger's main legislative accomplishment was passage of debt readjustment legislation, a process that began in the spring 1880 state legislative session, even though as a delegate in 1872 Riddleberger had opposed repeal of the then-new debt funding legislation.Charles C. Pearson, The Readjuster Movement in Virginia (Yale 1917; reprinted 1969 by Peter Smith of Gloucester, Massachusetts) p.107 Virginia had issued bonds before the Civil War to construct railroads, canals and roads, many of them in the state's western portion and which were destroyed during the Civil War (hence the security for the bonds was also worthless). Legal cases concerning the size and proportion of this debt owed by West Virginia would continue for decades. Inexperienced Virginia legislators during the first postwar legislative sessions (such as Dr. Belew) has agreed to honor the debt at face value and unusually high interest rate, as well as to allow debt coupons to be used at face value to pay current state taxes. The bonds actually sold at a great discount (often to British and other overseas investors), and by the late 1870s many forged and counterfeit bonds and coupons existed. Meanwhile, Virginia's economy had collapsed after the war and was slow to recover, and the postwar state Constitution established public schools. For a decade, legislators had fought over whether to \\"adjust\\" the prewar debt, as well as how to pay for teachers and other state officials. Riddleberger's bill applied to the three-fifths of the total debt allocated to Virginia and would only allow 3% interest, as well as limited bondholders' ability to pay state taxes with the bonds' coupons. Although both houses passed the bill, governor Frederick W.M. Holliday (the former Commonwealth attorney for Frederick County and a \\"Funder\\") vetoed the measure. During the next gubernatorial election, Riddleberger sought his Readjuster party's nomination, but it went instead to fellow Confederate veteran William E. Cameron of Petersburg, Virginia, Mahone's friend. The Readjuster ticket swept all 3 statewide offices; Cameron defeated Confederate veteran (and future U.S. Senator) John W. Daniel to become Virginia's 39th governor. During the campaign, on October 15, 1881, Riddleberger twice attempted to duel with newly elected U.S. Congressman George D. Wise (from 1870-1879 the Richmond City Commonwealth Attorney) and the editor of the Richmond State newspaper over supposed Readjuster Party correspondence published in that newspaper. Dueling was illegal at the time, but no shots were fired during the first duel because of a lack of blasting caps. During the second duel, all three rounds missed. However, Riddleberger was arrested for dueling after giving a speech at a Readjuster meeting that evening. He was eventually released after posting $1000 bail and agreeing not to duel for a year. However, dueling would become the subject of two laws passed during the Readjuster dominated legislative session of 1881-1882. On December 21, 1881, as the new legislative session began with a significant Readjuster majority, legislators elected Riddleberger to the U.S. Senate (even though the seat would not become vacant for more than a year). During that legislative session, Riddleberger reintroduced his debt readjustment legislation as three bills, all of which became law after passage by both houses and Gov. Cameron's signature (although litigation concerning them would continue for awhile after Riddleberger succeeded John W. Johnson and served as U.S. Senator from March 4, 1883 until March 4, 1889). The \\"Riddleberger Debt Act,\\" provided for $21,035,377.15 in 3-percent fifty-year bonds, issued in exchange for the prewar bonds (which reduced the interest rate by half and principal by about a third), and prohibited paying state taxes with coupons.Morton p. 116 Readjusters also funded public education, abolished (temporarily) the poll tax, and for the first time tried to levy real taxes on railroads and other corporations.Raymond H. Pulley, Old Virginia Restored, 1870-1930 (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press 1968) pp. 37-38 The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the first \\"coupon-killer\\" bond act in 1883.Antoni v.

Morton, The Negro in Virginia Politics 1865-1902 (Charlottesville, University of Virginia Press 1919) p. 110 Riddleberger became chairman of the Committee on Manufactures (which later became the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation). He was not a candidate for reelection in 1888, since the Readjusters had lost their majority in 1883 (in an election shortly after a race riot in Danville), failed to regain it in 1884 and 1885 (after newly elected President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, removed prior Republican patronage employees). The new Democratic majority had accepted the debt reduction as well as free schools, but also put local election boards under statewide legislative control and selected Funder Major J.W. Daniel to succeed Mahone.Pulley pp. 44-46 Meanwhile, Riddleberger earned reputations for hard drinking and eccentricity in the Senate. In early 1885, Riddleberger became the only senator to vote against a resolution condemning an Irish separatist attack in London, and later became the only senator to vote against confirmation of Delaware's U.S. Senator Thomas Bayard as Secretary of State (because of his support for Britain's Irish policy). He also condemned the departing Senator Mahone as arrogant and stubborn and for the party's loss in 1884. While he continued to caucus with the Republicans in the Senate after Mahone's departure, Riddleberger returned to the Democratic party by the time his term expired in March 1889. Personal life Riddleberger married Emma Belew, one of the daughters of Dr. Peter Belew (1819-1904), who served in the state Senate after the Civil War, and had owned slaves before the conflict.seven slaves according to the 1850 U.S. Federal Census for District 58, Shenandoah County, Virginia p. 3 of 11 They had sons Frank Belew Riddleberger (1872‚Äì1965), Ralph Heiskel Riddleberger (1877‚Äì1949), Hugh Riddleberger (1880‚Äì1909) and Harrison Heath Riddleberger (1883‚Äì1941), as well as daughters Lelia Myrtle Riddleberger Magruder (1867‚Äì1939), Olive Mizpah Riddleberger (1870‚Äì1958) and Edna V.

The group was most active as a recording unit from the mid-1970s to 1986. Charlie never charted in the UK but had four minor hits in the US: \\"Turning To You\\" (1977) \\"She Loves to Be In Love\\" (1978), \\"Killer Cut\\" (1979) and \\"It's Inevitable\\" (1983). History The band was briefly called \\"Charlie Cuckoo\\" (after a racehorse), but soon became known simply as \\"Charlie\\". The original members were: *Terry Thomas - lead vocals, guitar *John Anderson - backing vocals, bass guitar *Steve Gadd - drums (not to be confused with American session drummer of the same name) *Martin Smith - backing vocals, guitar The band debuted as a recording act in 1973, issuing the non-charting single \\"I Need Your Love\\" on Decca in the UK. Although the band had a contract for four singles with Decca, only one more (\\"Knocking Down Your Door\\") was recorded, and it was never released. Three years later, Charlie released their first album Fantasy Girls. Thomas was Charlie's primary songwriter for this and all future albums, although he also collaborated with other band members from time to time. Charlie supported The Who at their 1975 Hammersmith Odeon Christmas shows and toured the UK in spring 1976 as a support act to the Dutch progressive rock band Focus to promote the album. Smith left after the first album and was replaced by the keyboard player Julian Colbeck. The group's second album, No Second Chance, began the practice of having a photograph of a female model as the album's cover. \\"Turning To You\\", from that album, was Charlie's first chart entry, peaking at #96 in the US. Thomas also produced the album, with John Anderson. All future Charlie releases were produced by Thomas, usually in association with one or more band members. Eugene Organ was added as a fifth member on guitar for the following two albums, Lines in 1978 and Fight Dirty in 1979. The band had its biggest hit in 1978 with \\"She Loves to Be In Love\\", which peaked at #54 in the US. In the following year, the band had another minor hit with \\"Killer Cut\\", which rose to #60 in the US. By this time, Shep Lonsdale had been added as an official sixth member, playing drums and percussion alongside Gadd on all of Fight Dirty. Colbeck and Organ left in 1980 amid some turmoil, after having finished recording of the group's planned fifth album, Here Comes Trouble. Colbeck wrote, \\"Finally, the touring band line-up of Terry Thomas, John Anderson, Eugene Organ, Steve Gadd, and myself ceased operations once Arista refused to release Here Comes Trouble, and our caring, sharing management company immediately cut off all our money in 1980. That's a whole other story but, for the record, our final gig was in 1979 at the Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island on Monday 29 October, alongside Foreigner.\\" Thomas commented, \\"Arista our new label in the U.S. wanted more songs - our company in the UK - Trident Audio Productions - refused to put us in the studio or spend any more money. The UK record company - Polydor - wouldn't release it until it had a U.S. release. Effectively Charlie had no record label and no money to live on. Eugene and Julian decided to leave.\\" In 1981, a reorganised Charlie issued the album Good Morning America for RCA Records. Produced by Thomas and John Verity, the band now consisted of Thomas, Anderson, Gadd, Verity (vocals, guitar, formerly with the band Argent) and second drummer Bob Henrit (also ex-Argent). (Lonsdale had moved on to work for the band Toto as a sound engineer, mixing their live shows.) The previously unissued Here Comes Trouble, recorded in 1980, was finally released in 1982, albeit only in continental Europe. In 1982, Verity left to pursue a solo career and Terry Slesser joined the group as the new lead singer, while Thomas, still a member of the band, began concentrating more on the instrumentation. In 1983, the group had its most successful hit single, \\"It's Inevitable\\", which peaked just inside the US Top 40 at #38. The MTV music video showed a rousing pie fight. On the American Top 40 countdown show from 20 August 1983, Casey Kasem informed listeners about a \\"slight discrepancy\\" on the previous show from 13 August. There \\"Pieces of Ice\\" by Diana Ross had been played as the song at #38 on the countdown but actually was at #45. The real #38 song would have been \\"It's inevitable\\" by Charlie. The accompanying album, Charlie, was a flop, however, and the band folded. In 1986, Thomas resurrected the band identity, while essentially working as a solo artist. For the 1986 Charlie album In Pursuit of Romance, Thomas is the only credited band member, though there are some contributions made by session musicians. Thomas wrote, \\"This was basically a contractual album - Steve had gone off to work with Iron Maiden as a drum tech and John had a job in the telecommunications industry. I ended up making the whole album by myself - it put me in the hospital!\\" After a long lay off, in 2009 Charlie released the first album of new material in 23 years, Kitchens Of Distinction. It began life as a Terry Thomas solo project, but as the finished product included contributions from Martin Smith and Julian Colbeck amongst others, the decision was made to credit the CD to Charlie. Gadd died on 27 March 2013, after a year-long battle with cancer. Charlie released what was billed as a final album, Elysium, in late 2015. The band then consisted of Terry Thomas (vocals, guitar), Andy Bloom (guitar), Elliot Thomas (guitar), Martin Smith (steel guitar), Julian Colbeck (keyboards), Charlie Barratt (bass guitar) and Steve Alexander (drums).

The name comes from the Irish tur, meaning \\"dry\\", with the suffix -lach, meaning \\"a place\\" (in an abstract sense). The -lach suffix is often mistakenly spelled and/or thought to refer to the word loch, the Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Scots word for \\"lake\\". The landforms are found in Irish karst (exposed limestone) areas. The features are almost unique to Ireland, although there is one example in Great Britain, Pant-y-Llyn at Cernydd Carmel near Llandeilo. They are of great interest to many scientists: geomorphologists are interested in how turloughs were formed, hydrologists try to explain what makes turloughs flood, botanists study the unusual vegetation which covers the turlough floor, and zoologists study the animals associated with the turloughs. The turlough at Carran, Co. Clare, Ireland in late May 2005. The water level is high following a spell of wet weather  Locations  Pant y Llyn turlough, South Wales Turloughs are mostly found on the central lowlands west of the Shannon, in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo, and Roscommon, although a few are also found elsewhere, e.g. in Limerick, Sligo, Longford, and Cork. Only three turloughs have been identified in Northern Ireland, namely Roosky, Green, and Fardrum Loughs located near Ely Lodge Forest in County Fermanagh. These constitute the most northerly turloughs in Ireland and have been collectively designated a Ramsar site and an Area of Special Scientific Interest. There is one turlough in South Wales, Pant y Llyn.  Seasonal pools  Most turloughs flood in the autumn, usually sometime in October, and then dry up some time between April and July. However, some turloughs in the Burren can flood at any time of year in a matter of a few hours after heavy rainfall, and they may empty again a few days later. Some turloughs are affected by the oceanic tide: in the summer, Caherglassaun Lough, situated 5 kilometres from Galway Bay, can be seen to flood and empty again twice every 24 hours. Most turloughs flood to a depth of about but some are much deeper: for example, some of the turloughs near Gort reach about deep in midwinter. Turloughs are variable in size: the largest turlough in Ireland, Rahasane turlough, which lies to the west of Craughwell in County Galway, covers about .  Formation  All of the turloughs are found in limestone areas. This is because limestone can be dissolved away by rainwater, which becomes mildly acidic by picking up carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere. The cracks or joints in the rock become widened to such an extent that eventually all of the rain falling on the limestone disappears underground, and the water moves through the rock openings ranging from cracks a few millimetres wide to large cave passages. The limestone is then said to be \\"karstified\\". To the east of the Shannon, the limestone is often covered by great thicknesses of glacial drift deposited during the last glacial period, but in many areas to the west of the Shannon where the limestone is pure and the drift cover is thin, there is no proper surface river network. In these areas, rainfall disappears underground, flows through openings in the rock and then rises at distant springs: large springs can be found to the west of the area, flowing into Lough Corrib and Galway Bay. In winter, when the underground water level (or water table) rises, and when the underground flow increases, and when the underground flow routes to the springs are not capable of dealing with the amount of water entering them, groundwater may appear temporarily at the surface in the form of a turlough. Many of the rivers seen in these areas today are largely artificial, constructed by drainage engineers from the nineteenth century up to the present day, often linking a series of turloughs. For example, much of the River Clare is artificial, and the middle section of its course used to be a huge turlough, the largest in Ireland at .  Swallow holes  Turloughs usually fill and empty at particular places on the floor of the depression; sometimes an actual hole or passage is visible but more often a hollow with stones in the bottom is all that can be seen, and it may not be easy to recognise when it is dry in midsummer. Some turloughs have a spring at one place and a sinkhole (also known as a \\"swallet\\") somewhere else on the floor where water drains away, but many turloughs fill and empty through the same hole. A few turloughs are filled by surface rivers and streams flowing into them as well as by water rising from underground. The water sinking in the swallow hole travels underground to re-emerge at a spring, which may be several kilometres away. In most rock types, groundwater flows very slowly (from just a few centimetres to a few metres per day), but in karstified limestone the volumetric flow rate can be quite rapid: water from the turlough may flow underground to a spring at a rate of or more.  Calcium carbonate deposits  Limestone is made up of the mineral calcium carbonate, and as water passes through limestone, it dissolves the calcium carbonate (this is what makes hard water and causes mineral deposits on the inside of kettles) as the calcium carbonate comes out of solution when the water is heated. Something rather similar happens in turloughs; water that has picked up a lot of calcium carbonate during its underground travel rises in the turloughs and then some of the calcium carbonate comes out of solution and forms a white deposit. If a turlough has emptied recently, a whitish coating on the vegetation on the turlough floor may be visible. When water comes to the surface in a turlough, it loses carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere and to plants, which use it for photosynthesis, and this loss causes a deposit of calcium carbonate on the surface. Sometimes a special whitish deposit with the appearance of sheets of paper is found in the turloughs when they dry up. This \\"algal paper\\" is made up of filaments of an alga that grows abundantly in warm weather and is then left to dry out in sheets when the turlough empties. In drainage ditches in a turlough, or in holes made with a soil auger, one may find a white- or cream-coloured deposit beneath the vegetation cover, or beneath a layer of peat. This is often called \\"white marl\\"; again, it is made of calcium carbonate. About half of the turloughs contain marl; it was deposited at a time several thousand years ago when these turloughs were not seasonal lakes but were flooded all year round.  Plant and animal life  Most turloughs have a springy, short-cropped turf of grasses, sedges, and herbs. In the Burren, the high-water mark is often shown by the shrubby cinquefoil () with its attractive yellow flowers, and meadow rue. Just below the high-water mark, dog violets are abundant and in some turloughs there may be a dense sward of the rare sky-blue turlough violet about one metre further down. Other characteristic plants of turlough sides include marsh orchids and speedwell. About halfway down the sides, and across the bottom of shallow turloughs, silverweed () may blanket almost all other plants. If the turlough has a marshy zone near the swallow hole there may be mint, watercress, pondweeds, aquatic buttercups, and knotgrass living a semiterrestrial existence. But most swallow holes when dry are represented by a jumble of rocks, clothed with blackish and dried aquatic mosses (, the turlough moss, and , usually found in streams). Many people think that turloughs have no animal life. However, frogs and newts may spawn there, and sticklebacks may survive in the larger turloughs, retreating into underground cracks in the rock when waters are low. Shrimps and water lice do the same, and where fish are absent there may be a rich fauna of delicate water fleas and fairy shrimps, some unknown elsewhere in Ireland. These hatch and grow fast, finding safety in the warm fish-free waters. Flatworms and snails are also often abundant; these pass the dry periods in spring mouths or marshy areas. Rahasane turlough in Galway has been described as the most important turlough in Ireland for birdlife.http://www.npws.ie/sites/default/files/protected- sites/synopsis/SY000322.pdf It is famous for its greater white-fronted geese, whooper swans, wigeon, teal, and many waders in winter.BirdLife International (2015) Important Bird Areas factsheet: Rahasane turlough. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 15/06/2015 Both Rahasane turlough and Coole Park are Important Bird Areas.  Draining of turloughs  Turloughs provide good summer grazing for cattle, sheep and horses, partly because of the annual deposition of lime-rich silt. However, for many years, farmers have seen the winter flooding as a waste of potential and they have attempted to find some means of draining the turloughs so that they can be used all year round. This has usually been achieved by digging an artificial channel through the turlough, capable of carrying away any water entering the turlough from surface or groundwater ‚Äì such channels have often been constructed as part of major arterial drainage schemes. At least a third of the turloughs in Ireland have already been drained and more are being drained each year. This has very serious environmental consequences, because the unique flora and fauna of the turlough cannot survive in the absence of seasonal flooding. Even for farmers, the benefits are not always as great as anticipated; the stopping of the annual limy silt deposition means that the soil may become impoverished and fertilisers must be used. Also, the poorly developed and delicate soil may not be able to withstand the presence of animals through the winter.

Rothermel) The Virginia Resolves were a series of resolutions passed by the Virginia House of Burgesses in response to the Stamp Act of 1765, which imposed a tax on the British colonies in North America and required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp. The act had been passed by the Parliament of Great Britain to help pay off some of its debt from its various wars, including the French and Indian War fought in part to protect the American colonies. The resolves claimed that in accordance with long established British law, Virginia was subject to taxation only by a parliamentary assembly to which Virginians themselves elected representatives. Since no colonial representatives were elected to Parliament, the only assembly legally allowed to raise taxes would be the Virginia General Assembly. Similarly angered, legislatures in nine other colonies later sent delegates to Stamp Act Congress in New York (October 9‚Äì25, 1765) to devise a unified protest against the tax. Virginia was not represented at the meeting as the General Assembly was prevented from participating by Lieutenant Governor of Virginia Francis Fauquier.  Origin  On May 29, 1765, Patrick Henry made one of his famous speeches before the Virginia House of Burgesses to encourage the passage of the resolutions. Henry said \\"Caesar had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III... (Henry was interrupted by cries from the opposition)‚Ä¶ may profit by their example. If this be treason, make the most of it.\\" When Patrick Henry paused after the vibrant portion of the speech, Speaker John Robinson stood and shouted, \\"Treason! Treason!\\". Patrick Henry at this point issued a semi-apology. Peyton Randolph later told his young cousin Thomas Jefferson who was standing in the doorways of the House quite frequently. \\"By God, I would have given 500 guineas for a single vote\\". The Burgesses generally voted along geographic lines with eastern Virginians opposing the resolves and central Virginians supporting them. Patrick Henry left Williamsburg, Virginia that night fearing the powerful members of the House would harass him with a warrant. The next day, with Patrick Henry gone and most conservative assembly members back in session, the assembly again set a vote with conservatives trying to have the Resolves struck from the record. However Henry's supporters managed to preserve the first four resolutions with only the more radical 5th Resolution being struck.Anderson, Fred. Crucible of War. Vintage Books. In late June the Newport Mercury was the first newspaper to publish the Virginia Resolves to the general public with several other newspapers following soon after. Notably none of the newspapers drew on the official House records and as a result the published resolutions included not only the 4 ratified resolutions but also the, already removed, 5th resolution. In fact the newspapers even went so far to include a 6th and 7th resolution the origin of which is still disputed. Some sources quote those two articles as being part of Henry's original manuscriptMorison, Sources and Documents, pp. 17-18 while others argue that their origin is completely unknown. A direct result of the publishing of the Virginia Resolves was a growing public anger over the Stamp Act and according to several contemporary sources the Resolves were responsible for inciting the Stamp Act Riots. Governor Thomas Hutchinson of Massachusetts stated that \\"Nothing extravagant appeared in the papers till an account was received of the Virginia Resolves.\\" Later Edmund Burke linked the resolves with the beginning of the opposition to the Stamp Act that would contribute to the American Revolution. Text of the Virginia Resolves The original text of the Virginia Resolves as adopted by the House of Burgesses on May 29, 1765 was as follows: John Pendleton Kennedy, ed., Journals of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, 1761-1765 (Richmond, Va., 1907) Additional resolutions When the Virginia Resolves were first published in colonial newspapers the articles cited not only the four officially adopted resolutions but also included the revoked fifth resolve plus two additional resolutions: *Resolved, That his majesty's liege people, the inhabitants of this colony, are not bound to yield obedience to any law or ordinance whatsoever designed to impose any taxation whatsoever upon them, other than the laws and ordinances of the general assembly aforesaid. *Resolved, That any person who shall by speaking or writing maintain that any person or persons other than the general assembly of this colony have any right or power to impose or lay any taxation whatsoever on the people here shall be deemed an enemy to this his majesty's colony. These two resolutions were never passed by the House of Burgesses, and it is not known for certain who authored them, although some sources claim that they were part of the original draft by Patrick Henry.

The screenplay by William M. Conselman was adapted from the children's novel of the same name by Annie Fellows Johnston, originally published in 1895. It focuses on the reconciliation of an estranged father and daughter in the years following the American Civil War. The film stars Shirley Temple, Lionel Barrymore, Evelyn Venable, John Lodge, Bill Robinson, and Hattie McDaniel. The Little Colonel was the first of four cinematic pairings between Temple and Robinson, and features the duo's famous staircase tap dance. The film was well received, and, in 1994, was available on videocassette in both black-and-white and computer-colorized versions. Plot Shortly after the American Civil War, southern belle Elizabeth Lloyd (Evelyn Venable) marries a northerner, Jack Sherman (John Lodge). Her father Colonel Lloyd (Lionel Barrymore) disowns her in anger and retaliation. Elizabeth and Jack move west where they become parents of a girl they name Lloyd Sherman (Shirley Temple). Six years later, Lloyd Sherman is made an honorary colonel in the Army. Elizabeth returns to the south with little Lloyd and settles in a cottage near Colonel Lloyd‚Äôs mansion while her husband Jack remains in the west prospecting for gold. When Colonel Lloyd discovers his daughter living in the neighborhood, he treats her with disdain. Little Lloyd learns of her parents‚Äô past from housekeeper Mom Beck (Hattie McDaniel), and, when she meets her grandfather for the first time, throws mud at him. The two eventually become contentious friends. Elizabeth‚Äôs husband returns from the west with a fever. He has lost everything in his prospecting venture, but the family is saved from complete ruin when the Union Pacific Railroad requests right of way across Jack‚Äôs western property. Jack's former prospecting partners have heard of the Railroad‚Äôs offer and try to swindle Jack. They resort to holding the Sherman couple hostage until the deed to their valuable property is located. Little Lloyd runs through the dark woods for her grandfather, but he refuses to help. He changes his mind when little Lloyd says she never wants to see him again. They arrive at the cottage just in time to save Elizabeth and Jack. The film ends with a brief Technicolor sequence featuring a 'pink party' for little Lloyd, her friends, and her reconciled family.

It was the first interracial dance pairing in Hollywood history and was so controversial that it was cut out in the Southern United States. The idea was actually first proposed by Fox head Winfield Sheehan after a discussion with D. W. Griffith. Sheehan set his sights on Robinson, but unsure of his ability as an actor, arranged for a contract that would be voided if Robinson failed the dramatic test. Robinson passed the test and was brought in to both star with Temple and to teach her tap dancing.Shirley Temple Black, Child Star: An Autobiography (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 90-91. They quickly hit it off, as Temple recounted years later: > Robinson walked a step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch > up, he shortened his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his > hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his > attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his > eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile.

During the filming, Temple drew the ire of veteran actor Lionel Barrymore when she prompted him for one of his lines after he forgot it, causing him to storm off in a fit of anger. Temple was sent off to apologize to Barrymore, but, instead of directly apologizing, told him she thought he was the best actor in the world and asked for his autograph, defusing the situation and bringing Barrymore onto the set.Shirley Temple Black, Child Star: An Autobiography (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 93-94. This film made brief usage of early Technicolor film, which required heavy usage of red-hued makeup for the actors. It would be the only time that Temple would wear makeup on the set of her Fox films.Shirley Temple Black, Child Star: An Autobiography (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 97. Release =Distribution= When screened for audiences in Southern states, to ensure the film's widest distribution, Fox removed the staircase scene where Temple and Robinson touch hands. =Critical responses= VHS cover Andre Sennwald in his New York Times review of March 22, 1935 thought the film \\"[a]ll adrip with magnolia whimsy and vast, unashamed portions of synthetic Dixie atmosphere\\". He further wrote that the film was \\"so ruthless in its exploitation of Miss Temple's great talent for infant charm that it seldom succeeds in being properly lively and gay\\".

As a child, he lived with his family on a farm in New Berlin, Wisconsin and attended school until he was twelve. Career Heil became qualified as an expert welder and traveled extensively in South America, installing welded steel track for streetcars. In 1901, he founded the Heil Company in Milwaukee, which fabricated steel tank cars. In 1933 he was appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt to head the state advisory board for the National Recovery Administration. Winning the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1938, Heil went on to defeat his Progressive opponent-incumbent Philip F. La Follette. As governor, he created the Department of Motor Vehicles out of five existing agencies and consolidated welfare and institutional programs under a single Department of Public Welfare. A controversial innovation was his creation of a Division of Departmental Research, designed to achieve greater efficiency in state administration. The United States entered World War II during Heil's second term, and a State Guard was created to replace the National Guard, which had been called to active duty. Often known as \\"Julius the Just,\\" as governor, the New York Times reported that Heil was known for clowning and silly antics. He was re-elected in 1940, but lost to Progressive Orland Steen Loomis in 1942, according to the New York Times, because of his unpopular labor record. After losing a third term as governor, Heil became president and later chairman of the board of the Heil Company. He toured the country to promote Wisconsin's dairy products. Death Heil died of heart failure in Milwaukee on November 30, 1949, (age 73 years, 129 days). He is interred at Wisconsin Memorial Park, Brookfield, Wisconsin.

A large number of billboards entice travelers along this sparse stretch of desert highway to stop, just to find out what the mysterious Thing might be. The object, supposedly a mummified mother and child, is believed to have been made by exhibit creator Homer Tate for sideshows. The Thing was purchased by former lawyer Thomas Binkley Prince in the mid-twentieth century, who quickly based a tourist attraction around the strange object. Although Prince died in 1969, the attraction was run by his wife Janet for many years. Today, the site is under the ownership of Bowlin Travel Centers, Inc. Despite its remoteness, the attraction has been popular; it has appeared in several tourist guides, and has been the subject of several news stories and reports. Location The Thing is located at just off I-10 at Exit 322 on a hilltop between Benson and Willcox, near Texas Canyon, at 2631 North Johnson Road, Dragoon, Arizona.  The exhibit  The Thing Inside the exhibit are a variety of items, including odd wood carvings of tortured souls by woodcarver Ralph Gallagher, the \\"Wooden Fantasy\\" of painted driftwood purchased from an Alamogordo, New Mexico collector, framed 1880s to early 1900s lithographs, historic engraved saddles, guns and rifles of historic Western significance, a Conestoga wagon from Oklahoma! (Southern Pacific 1673, also appearing in Oklahoma!, is located at the Tucson, Arizona, train station), a buggy without a horse, and a vintage American automobile from the 1930s. A sign by a 1937 Rolls-Royce mentions that it may have been used by Adolf Hitler, a supposition reiterated by the originator of the exhibit. Winding corridors and exhibit halls with painted monster footprints on the floors eventually lead to the \\"Thing\\", a mummified, likely female \\"Mother\\" of possibly Chinese or Native American descent who died in the 1880s to early 1900s, and a mummified \\"Child\\" age and descent unknown but inferred to be the son or daughter of the \\"Mother\\". They are presented in separate but closely linked displays, coffin, and small coffin, bedding, and scratched plexiglass covering. One story as to the origin of the \\"Thing\\" is that the \\"Mother\\" and \\"Child\\" were illegal border crossers who were found and slaughtered by unknown cowboy bandits during a shootout and found decades later as mummified bodies by a rancher in the area who sold them to the owner/originator of the \\"Thing\\". But in this story, the harshness of the truth will never be uncovered, and the \\"Thing\\" will remain a mystery. In August 2018, the Bowlin Travel Centers unveiled a brand new modern museum building and other updates to house, in some order or theme, most of the items formerly stored in the three sheds. The new owners have also added a new alien and dinosaur theme that visitors first encounter upon entering the museum. In addition to the upgrades, the cost of admission has also increased to $5 per person or $10 per family.Arizona Republic newspaper, 29 September 2018, pp. 1D & 6D, \\"Quirk Trip\\" by Scott Craven Origins The step-great-great-grandson of Homer Tate and the curator of the Arizona Historical Society-Pioneer Museum in Flagstaff has said that this was created by Homer Tate. Tate was famous for producing sideshow gaffes. Based out of Phoenix, Tate produced a variety of curiosities like faux shrunken heads. The roadside area was the creation of attorney Thomas Binkley Prince, who was born in Texas in 1913. Prince attended Arizona State University and became a lawyer, practicing law for a time in Phoenix, Arizona. But soon he and his wife Janet moved to the Mojave Desert on Highway 91 and opened their first Thing roadside attraction and curio shop, between Barstow and Baker. However, the expansion of the road into an interstate highway brought about the loss of the building, and in 1965 the Prince family packed up The Thing and moved to the current location in Arizona. Prince chose the location to be near Texas Canyon, a site that he had become \\"enchanted\\" with. A heart condition and several strokes led to Prince's death in 1969 at the age of 56. Janet ran the attraction for several years, but eventually relocated to Baltimore. The origin of The Thing was established by Syndicated columnist Stan Delaplane, who interviewed Janet Prince in 1956. Prince told him, \\"[A] man came through here about six years ago. He had three of [the bodies] he got somewhere. He was selling them for $50.\\" Today, the attraction is operated by an Albuquerque-based company, Bowlins, Inc., which owns several roadside trading posts throughout the Southwest. Advertisement and popularity The Thing is heavily advertised via billboards that dot the interstate. A popular, albeit untrue, legend states that the billboards stretch from New Orleans to Los Angeles. Mike Bowlin, the owner of the site in 1993, noted that the billboards realistically \\"start around El Paso to the east and somewhere on I-10 between Phoenix and Tucson to the west.\\" RoadsideAmerica.com claims that over 247 billboards, spread out over a span of 200 miles, advertise the attraction. Due to The Thing's popularity, it has appeared in many books, such as Doug Kirby's New Roadside America (1992), Weird Arizona (2007) and it once was featured in a Jane Pauley television special on NBC. It is also referenced in the song \\"The Church of Logic Sin and Love\\" (1992), by The Men.

Headstone viaduct Headstone Viaduct Headstone Tunnel, at the southern end of the viaduct, was opened to the public in May 2011 The Headstone Viaduct was built by the Midland Railway over the River Wye. The bridge, which stands near the Headstone Tunnel, is long. It had five span arches, some high at the centre. Initially, some slippage occurred, and remedial work was carried out in 1907‚Äì08. Whilst considered elegant today, with Grade II listed status being assigned to it in 1970, when it was built in 1863 it was seen as destroying the beauty of the dale. John Ruskin, considered to be Britain's leading cultural critic, harshly criticised the building of the railway: A proposal that never came to fruition was for another viaduct for the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway to cross both the valley and the Midland Line, some three hundred feet high.Dow, George, Great Central: volume III: Fay Sets the Pace, 1900‚Äì1922, Ian Allan, Shepperton, , page 153 Monsal Trail The viaduct is now part of the Monsal Trail.

The down line and platform was built on a shelf carved in the rock face, while the up was built on wooden trestles over the hillside. It closed in 1959 and nothing remains of the timber buildings. From Monsal Dale, the line proceeded through Cressbrook (471 yards) and Litton (515 yards) tunnels to Millers Dale on its way north.

Life His father was Daniel Burgess, who, after holding the livings of Staines and of Sutton Magna, Wiltshire, was appointed rector of Collingbourn Ducis, Wiltshire, through the influence of his brother Isaac Burgess, High Sheriff of the county, was ejected in 1662, and was probably the author of the sermon on Eccl. xii. 1, mentioned by Watts and Allibone. Burgess was placed under Richard Busby at Westminster School in 1654, and entered commoner of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1660. He studied hard, but did not graduate, declining to conform. The statement that he took orders at Oxford needs confirmation; deacon's orders he may have had, but more probably only the license of a presbytery. Leaving the university, he acted as domestic chaplain to Foyl of Chute, Wiltshire, and afterwards to Smith of Tedworth. In 1667, Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery, lord president of Munster, took him to Ireland, where he remained seven years. He was headmaster of the school founded by Lord Orrery at Charleville, co. Cork, and had pupils from the Irish nobility and gentry. He afterwards acted as chaplain to Lady Mervin, near Dublin. He was ordained by the Dublin presbytery. At Dublin he married. In 1674, his father's state of health took him to Marlborough; he preached there and in the neighbourhood, and was sent to Marlborough gaol. He came to London in his fortieth year (1685), and ministered to a large congregation at a hired meeting-place in Brydges Street, Covent Garden. He had influential friends; the Countess of Warwick chose him as tutor for her grandson, the future Lord Bolingbroke; in July 1688 Rotheram, one of the new barons of exchequer, took him as his chaplain on the Oxford circuit, and in 1695 he preached the funeral sermon for the Countess of Ranelagh. His congregation moved in 1695 to a meeting-house in Russell Court, Drury Lane, and in 1705 a meeting-house was built for him in New Court, Carey Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields. Before it was paid for, differences arose in his congregation, ending in a large secession from his ministry. On 1 March 1710 the Henry Sacheverell mob gutted Burgess's meeting- house, and made a bonfire of its pulpit and other fittings. The government offered a reward of ¬£100 for the apprehension of the rioters, and repaired the building. Burgess's fame as a preacher was great, and his exuberant animation was something new in the London pulpit. He was a conspicuous example of pith and vivacity at a time when a dry dignity was beginning to be exacted of preachers as a virtue. Jonathan Swift, who admits his ability, unjustly taxes him with mixing unction with ‚Äòincoherence and ribaldry'. Tom Brown, who takes his Indian to Russell Court, deals chiefly with the congregation, but his hint of Burgess's ‚Äòpop-gun way of delivery‚Äô is in harmony with his style of composition. It is full of epigram, terse, quaint, clear, and never meaningless or dull. Caulfield reproduces a curious contemporary print of Burgess and his congregation. Among current stories of his pulpit wit, the best is that which makes him say that the Jews were called Israelites because God did not choose that his people should be called Jacobites. His very sensible discourse on ‚ÄòFoolish Talking and Jesting described and condemned', is of moment in view of his own practice and repute. Briefly, he contends that ‚Äòno jesting is lawful but what is medicinal, and restorative of spirits for nobler thoughts‚Äô. In theology, he was Calvinistical. Burgess's last years were damped by the defection from his flock and by sickness. ‚ÄòIf I must be idle,‚Äô he said, ‚ÄòI had rather be idle under ground than idle above ground.' He died on 26 January 1713, and was buried on 31 January, in the church of St. Clement Danes. Matthew Henry preached his funeral sermon. Works Of Burgess's publications Bogue and Bennett give, after Henry, an imperfect list of thirty- two without gates, be inning with ‚ÄòSoliloquies, which he printed in Ireland, and ending with a Latin defence of nonconformity, ‚ÄòAppellatio ad Fratres exteros.' Among his works are: * ‚ÄòA Call to Sinners,' 1689, 8vo (Written at the request of Baron Rotheram, for the use of condemned criminals). * ‚ÄòSeasonable Words for English Protestants,‚Äô 1690, 4to. * ‚ÄòThe Characters of a Godly Man,' 1691, 8vo. * ‚ÄòEighteen Directions for Saving Conversion to God,' 1691, 8vo. * ‚ÄòThe Death and Rest, Resilrrection and blessed Portion of the Saints‚Äô (Dan. xii. 13), 1692, 12mo. * ‚ÄòA Discourse of the Death and Resurrection of good Men‚Äôs Bodies,‚Äô 1692, 8vo. * ‚ÄòThe Confirming Work of Religion,‚Äô 1693, 8vo. * ‚ÄòThe Sure Way to Wealth . . . evenwhile Taxes rise and Trades sink,' 1693, 8vo. * ‚ÄòRules for hearing the Word of God,' &c.;, 2nd ed. 1693, 8vo. * ‚ÄòHoly Union and Holy Contention, &,c.‚Äô 1695, 8vo. * ‚ÄòRules and Motives to Holy Prayer,‚Äô 1696, 8vo. * ‚Äò Causa Dei; or Counsel to the Rich,‚Äô 1697, 8vo. * ‚ÄòThe Golden Snuffers‚Äô [Ex. xxxvii. 23], 1697, 12mo Family His son, Daniel Burgess (died 1747), was secretary to Caroline of Ansbach, Princess of Wales, and in 1723 obtained a regium donum or government grant of 500 half-yearly for dissenting ministers.

In central Rotherham on the eastern bank of the River Don, it was a single-platform terminus that opened on 31 October 1838 and closed on 4 October 1952. History The original station building was a substantial stone affair on Westgate, from where passengers had to cross the tracks on a level pedestrian crossing to access the platform. At the end of the 19th century, this situation was remedied by giving the station access to Main Street and building a temporary wooden station building there with direct access to the platform. This became known by the townsfolk as the \\"Rabbit Hutch\\" and was subject of some local complaint as not being fit for a town as important as Rotherham. The old station building became the GPO and a labour exchange, and finally passed back into railway hands as a line control office.Pixton (2001) The river was crossed by a wooden bridge with seven spans over which the station platform extended, and then the line passed over the River Don Navigation on a three-arched bridge, the centre arch of which was long and made of iron.Drake (1840), p. 46 This section of canal was owned by the South Yorkshire Railway Company, which became part of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway in 1864, and in order for its line from Mexborough to Sheffield to pass under the Westgate line, the canal below Ickles lock was diverted to join the river, and part of the Eastwood Cut below Rotherham lock was diverted to the east in the same year. The original canal bed was then filled in, and the tracks were laid along its course.Hadfield (1973), pp. 413‚Äì414 It was in this section that, in 1871, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway built Rotherham Central. The line ran immediately south of Millmoor,the former ground of Rotherham United, leading to its southern stand being named the 'Railway End'. Following the opening of the North Midland Railway between Leeds and Derby, the new through Masbrough station, later Rotherham Masborough, was opened about half a mile from the town centre. A junction was laid connecting this north‚Äìsouth line to the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway at Holmes, giving the North Midland access to the Wicker terminal of the S&R; in Sheffield. The S&R; eventually became part of the Midland Railway following amalgamations in 1844. The fact that the Midland also operated the much larger Masborough station could have relegated Westgate to being a backwater, but Westgate was much more central, and the standard service pattern on the Midland line after 1870, was for some Sheffield‚ÄìNottingham, Sheffield‚ÄìDerby and Sheffield‚ÄìManchester local trains to start back from Westgate and run through Sheffield Midland, calling at all stations; this kept Westgate a busy and important station right up to its closure. Closure By the middle of the twentieth century, trains to Westgate still passed over the 1830s vintage wooden bridge to call at the supposedly temporary wooden station buildings. It was the need to replace the by now decrepit bridge that prompted BR to close the station on 4 October 1952. At the end of its life, passengers were not allowed on to the portion of platform on the bridge and trains were not allowed to stand on the bridge. Freight continued for a few years until the bridge was in no fit state to carry any trains and was demolished. The station lay derelict for nearly two decades, with the wooden buildings being used to store dismantled market stalls (the site of the town's market was opposite the station at the time), until 1970 when the site was cleared and new Post Office sorting centre built. In the late 1960s the remaining part of the railway alignment was severed by a new road, but west of this the branch still remains serving C F Booth's scrapyard, albeit now at ground level rather than on an embankment.

Word metric An important example of a length is the word metric: given a presentation of a group by generators and relations, the length of an element is the length of the shortest word expressing it. Coxeter groups (including the symmetric group) have combinatorial important length functions, using the simple reflections as generators (thus each simple reflection has length 1). See also: length of a Weyl group element. A longest element of a Coxeter group is both important and unique up to conjugation (up to different choice of simple reflections). Properties A group with a length function does not form a filtered group, meaning that the sublevel sets S_i := \\\\\\\\{g \\\\mid L(g) \\\\leq i\\\\\\\\} do not form subgroups in general.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange.  History  = Northern Upholstery = In 1969, aged 22, Graham Kirkham was married with two children, which he describes as great motivation. Having visited a few manufacturers in his daily work, he decided that making furniture was relatively easy and that by cutting out the warehouse dealers in the middle of the supply chain, he could sell direct to the public at lower prices. Kirkham rented a room above a snooker hall in Carcroft, and started making furniture upstairs and retailing it downstairs. = DFS = DFS, Wetherby (formerly Northern Upholstery) on the Thorp Arch Trading Estate, West Yorkshire In 1983, Graham Kirkham, of Northern Upholstery, purchased the business and the name of the Darley Dale based DFS, founded by the Hardy Family in 1969. Northern Upholstery was renamed DFS (although some branches of Northern Upholstery in Yorkshire retained their original name until the mid 1990s) and at the time, had a total of sixty three stores, employing 2,000 staff. In 1993, DFS was floated on the stock market as DFS Furniture Company plc and valued at ¬£271 million, with Kirkham and his family trusts owning just over half of the shares. This brought the Kirkham family to the attention of thieves, who in 1994, broke into the family home at Sprotbrough while they were on holiday. The burglars bound and gagged the housekeeper and made off with money and jewels worth ¬£2.4 million, later recovered, but still South Yorkshire's largest armed robbery. In 1998, DFS announced its first drop in profits in twenty eight years to the London Stock Exchange. The company reworked its advertising to feature younger models, and in 2000, DFS announced a 79 percent profit increase. But the revival was short lived, and in light of the continuing prevalence for private equity, Kirkham took the chain private again in 2004, leveraging his family's own 9.46% stake with ¬£150 million of family funds in an eventual ¬£496 million deal. Kirkham told the Yorkshire Post: \\"It's something that's caused me fitful sleep in the time I've been thinking about it. I've no hobby, this is my hobby ‚Äì it's what I do. I'm an entrepreneur. It's almost as if I can feel the adrenaline running through my veins.\\" On 3 April 2010, it was announced that DFS had been sold to private equity firm Advent International for a reported ¬£500 million. DFS then acquired two smaller British retailers which had been struggling in the market: Sofa Workshop in 2013 and Dwell in August 2014. On 6 March 2015, the company floated on the London Stock Exchange again as DFS Furniture plc. In October 2017, DFS announced they had purchased one of their competitors, Sofology (formerly Sofaworks and CSL) in a ¬£25 million deal. The acquisition was ratified by the Competition and Markets Authority in November 2017.  Marketing  For many years in the 1980s and 1990s, actor Tom Adams was the face of DFS's television advertisements. In December 2008, one television commercial by DFS was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, following complaints that the company had doctored the footage to inflate the perceived size of their sofas, relative to the actors.

Acquisitions * Furniture businesses of Wyefield Group (June 1999, ¬£1.5 million) = Sofa Workshop = Sofa Workshop is a furniture manufacturer and retailer of handmade furniture, offering both product and fabric customisation that DFS acquired in 2013. The furniture is handmade in Britain. As well as sofas and chairs, it also makes a range of accessories including footstools, cushions and made to measure curtains. Formerly based in Lodsworth, West Sussex, United Kingdom, it is now headquartered in Peasmarsh, Surrey. Sofa Workshop, founded by Andrew Cussins in 1985, opened its first store in Maidstone in 1986. In November 2002, Cussins sold the company to MFI Group for ¬£12.25 million. Seen by many as a poor marriage of brands due to different customer markets when MFI ceased selling lounge furniture, Sofa Workshop was sold. It was bought in October 2006, by the New Haven Group, which then appointed an administrator in May 2008. At that stage, the company had thirty one stores in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, employing 160 people. The company had revenue amounting to ¬£30 million in the year ending May 2008. On 31 December 2008, Sofa Workshop announced Leonard Curtis as a possible administrator. Leonard Curtis stated at the time that there had been expressions of interest in purchasing the company. It was reported on 31 January 2009 that Sofa Workshop had been sold. Leonard Curtis said ten of the company's thirty stores had been bought by Erewash Upholstery, which is controlled by a consortium of investors led by Andrew Cussins, who founded Sofa Workshop in 1985. Soon after the management buyout, Cussins moved on. Since the change of ownership, Sofa Workshop has re established itself as a furniture retailer in the United Kingdom, and has seen a 40% increase in profits in the year ending December 2010. Sofa Workshop Ltd now has twenty shops nationwide including a franchise shop in Chester. They are located in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Exeter, Bath, Bristol, Manchester, Guildford, Chichester, Cambridge, Harrogate, Gateshead, Kingston, Tunbridge Wells, Battersea, Chiswick, Newbury, Oxford, Westfield Stratford City, King‚Äôs Road, and Tottenham Court Road in London. In January 2012, they opened a second shop in Battersea, London as a dedicated Clearance Outlet. In October 2013, Sofa Workshop was acquired by DFS. However, it continues to trade as its own distinct business and brand as a part of DFS.

The left one carries the Monsal Trail. Millers Dale is a valley on the River Wye in Derbyshire. It is a popular beauty spot in the Peak District of England, much of the area being preserved as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Nearby is Ravenstor and Chee Dale, both popular with rock-climbers. Just to the north of the Dale lies the village of Wormhill and the lesser known valleys of Peter Dale and Monk's Dale, the latter being listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a nature reserve. The local landmark is the viaduct, first built by the Midland Railway in 1866. Increasing traffic meant that a second viaduct parallel to the first was built in 1905, increasing the number of tracks to four. Millers Dale railway station was at the junction where passengers for Buxton joined or left the trains between London and Manchester. The area is of great interest to geologists, particularly where the strata have been exposed by quarries and railway cuttings. In Station Quarry, which is owned by the Naturalists Trust, two layers of limestone can be seen, separated by a bed of shale. At one point there is a dip in the lower layer, possibly from a watercourse, millions of years ago. This is filled with the shale and a large limestone boulder can be seen within it. Elsewhere in the area there are signs of lava flows from long-ago volcanic activity. Northwards from Millers Dale the line entered the two Chee Tor tunnels (401 and 94 yards), separated by a bridge over the River Wye, then along a ledge cut into the rock face, before entering Rusher Cutting Tunnel (121 yards), crossing the Wye yet again by another viaduct. The line here was immensely difficult and expensive to construct, skirting, as it did, the base of the high ciff of Chee Tor. Chee number 1 was, until May 2011, sealed off for safety reasons, but it is now possible to walk through all three tunnels. Further on was the triangular junction for Buxton via Blackwell Mill, before continuing to Peak Forest. Large sections of the trackbed now form part of the Monsal Trail, a cycle and walking trail.

Biography Born in a displaced persons camp in Eschwege, Allied-occupied Germany, Gejdenson was the child of a Belarusian father and Lithuanian mother. Gejdenson grew up on a dairy farm in Bozrah, near Norwich. He attended Mitchell College for two years and finished his studies at the University of Connecticut. From 1970 to 1973, he worked for the FIA Company. He was elected as a Democrat to the Connecticut House of Representatives that same year and served two terms. He then worked as the president of the Montessori School in Norwich, Connecticut. Gejdenson won a seat in the United States House of Representatives in November 1980. During his tenure, there was strong disagreement whether or not Gejdenson was a strong advocate for the submarine manufacturing base located in his congressional district. Twice Gejdenson was offered a seat on the Armed Services Committee, but declined it. Gejdenson's supporters claimed the congressman didn't need to be on the committee to be effective. Gejdenson served as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Interior Committee (now House Resources Committee). In that capacity, he conducted oversight over the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Beginning in 1989, Gejdenson assumed the Chairmanship of the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (now International Relations Committee). Gejdenson focused his subcommittee's work on promoting American exports and streamlining export controls to facilitate high-tech exports. In 1999, Gejdenson became the Ranking Democratic Member of the full International Relations Committee, where he was a key player in writing legislation cracking down on international human trafficking and to authorize the activities of State Department. During his tenure, Gejdenson had a number of very close campaigns for re-election. He was nearly defeated by Republican Roberta Koontz in 1984 and again by State Senator Edward W. Munster in 1992. In 1994, as the Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives, a Gejdenson-Munster rematch produced only a 21-vote victory for Gejdenson. Munster formally challenged the result, which were upheld by the Republican-controlled House Government Reform and Oversight Committee by a vote of 2-1. Defeat In November 2000, Gejdenson lost his bid for re- election to the 107th Congress to State Representative Rob Simmons. Three major issues may have caused this defeat. In 1998, he had prominently written a counter-letter urging President Clinton to continue his peacemaking. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which had circulated a letter among Congressman to oppose putting any pressure on Israel, opposed his re-election despite the fact that he was Jewish. It was alleged that Gejdenson had moved out of the district. It was also alleged by author Jeffrey Benedict that Gejdenson had been an advocate of letting the Pequot Indians build the Foxwoods Casino. Post-Congress Gejdenson now resides in Branford, CT and is now involved in international trade with his own company, Sam Gejdenson International. He endorsed Joe Courtney in the 2006 election for the seat he once held, in which Courtney defeated Simmons in an extremely close race. Gejdenson is on the Board of Directors of the National Democratic Institute and was a Commissioner on the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom from 2012-2014.

Early in his career he co-authored chapters on the genetics of human growth and the effects of poverty on growth. The majority of this work appeared while he taught anthropology at the University of Michigan‚ÄìDearborn. Included among these are essays published mainly in edited European and Indian (Asia) works attacking ideas of genetic factors in determining development of height and body shape. Other publications include works on the computer game Civilization, Holocaustal images in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the American speculative fiction and socialist writer Mack Reynolds re-working of the Utopian fiction of Edward Bellamy, and Christian Romance fiction. Kapell has also published a number of essays in the journal Extrapolation, and elsewhere, on speculative fiction in the United States as intellectual history. His work in history is mainly focused American frontier ideology in the contemporary period, though he has also published on the representation of race in the Detroit media during World War II and the legal history of British colonial marriage law in Africa. Kapell was educated at Schoolcraft College, The University of Michigan‚ÄìDearborn, Wayne State University, all in Michigan, United States, and at Swansea University, Wales, UK. He is best known for his work in media studies and frontier ideology in American history. Frontier Ideology in American History Kapell's book Exploring the Next Frontier: Vietnam, NASA, Star Trek and Utopia in 1960s and 1970s American Myth and History, from the academic publisher Routledge, examines notions of the frontier in American culture during the 1960s and 1970s. It specifically covers the American cultural reactions to the Vietnam War through the work novelist of Joe Haldeman, the NASA lunar missions, the television show Star Trek and Gerard K. O'Neill's concept of space colonization called the \\"High Frontier.\\" Film and Television Studies He has published four edited academic volumes on popular culture, film, and television. The first, (with William G. Doty) is Jacking In to the Matrix Franchise: Cultural Reception and Interpretation (2004). The second is (with John Shelton Lawrence) Finding the Force of the Star Wars Franchise: Fans, Merchandise, and Critics (2006) and adds Wilhelm to his name. In 2010 Kapell published Star Trek as Myth: Essays on Symbol and Archetype at the Final Frontier and, working with British scholar Stephen McVeigh, Kapell edited The Films of James Cameron: Critical Essays in 2011. In 2015, with Ace G. Pilkington, Kapell edited The Fantastic Made Visible: Essays on the Adaption of Science Fiction and Fantasy From Page to Screen examining works by authors such as William Shakespeare, Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein and franchises such as Planet of the Apes and Snow White. All of the volumes provide multiple essays by academics and others on different cultural interpretations on the films and franchises under examination while Kapell's conclusion essays tend to emphasize myth. Game Studies Kapell‚Äôs 2013 edited book, Playing with the Past: Digital Games and the Simulation of History (Co-edited with Andrew B.R. Elliott; Bloomsbury) was called a ‚Äúgroundbreaking work in Media Studies and an essential text for the study of video games and the history of ideas‚Äù by C. Jason Smith in a pre-publication blurb. An examination of multiple digital (computer and console) games that confront historical narratives it contains chapters on Ancient, contemporary, Western and non-Western history, and utopian futures. It also examines different theories of historiographical understanding from multiple perspectives. His 2015 book, edited alone, is The Play Versus Story Divide in Game Studies: Critical Essays.

The United States Geographic Names System classifies Corryton as a populated place. It is included in Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Corryton zip code also encompasses the adjacent community of Gibbs (sometimes known as Harbisons Crossroads). Geography Corryton is situated near two mountains, House Mountain (the highest point in Knox County) and Clinch Mountain. It includes a grade school, a public library, community center, and several churches including Little Flat Creek Baptist Church (founded in 1797, making it the first Baptist church organized in Knox County), Corryton Church (formerly Corryton Baptist) and Rutherford Memorial United Methodist. History John Sawyers, a Revolutionary War veteran, settled in the vicinity of what is now Corryton in 1785. He subsequently built a small fort along the Emory Road. The community remained primarily agricultural until the construction of the Knoxville, Cumberland Gap and Louisville Railroad through the area in the late 1880s. The rail station that served the community was initially known as \\"Floyd.\\" In 1887, an entrepreneur named Corryton Woodbury purchased the station and adjacent lands, and laid out lots in hopes of establishing a new town, which he named after himself.

In plane geometry, Van Aubel's theorem describes a relationship between squares constructed on the sides of a quadrilateral. Starting with a given convex quadrilateral, construct a square, external to the quadrilateral, on each side. Van Aubel's theorem states that the two line segments between the centers of opposite squares are of equal lengths and are at right angles to one another. Another way of saying the same thing is that the center points of the four squares form the vertices of an equidiagonal orthodiagonal quadrilateral. The theorem is named after H. H. van Aubel, who published it in 1878.. The theorem holds true also for re-entrant quadrilaterals,Coxeter, H.S.M., and Greitzer, Samuel L. 1967.

In this case, the theorem holds true when the constructions are carried out in the more general way: *follow the quadrilateral vertexes in a sequential direction and construct each square on the right hand side of each side of the given quadrilateral. *Follow the quadrilateral vertexes in the same sequential direction and construct each square on the left hand side of each side of the given quadrilateral.

For example, in the ring of integers Z, (pn) is a primary ideal if p is a prime number. The notion of primary ideals is important in commutative ring theory because every ideal of a Noetherian ring has a primary decomposition, that is, can be written as an intersection of finitely many primary ideals. This result is known as the Lasker‚ÄìNoether theorem. Consequently,To be precise, one usually uses this fact to prove the theorem. an irreducible ideal of a Noetherian ring is primary. Various methods of generalizing primary ideals to noncommutative rings exist,See the references to Chatters‚ÄìHajarnavis, Goldman, Gorton‚ÄìHeatherly, and Lesieur‚ÄìCroisot. but the topic is most often studied for commutative rings. Therefore, the rings in this article are assumed to be commutative rings with identity. Examples and properties * The definition can be rephrased in a more symmetric manner: an ideal \\\\mathfrak{q} is primary if, whenever x y \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{q}, we have x \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{q} or y \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{q} or x, y \\\\in \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathfrak{q}}. (Here \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathfrak{q}} denotes the radical of \\\\mathfrak{q}.) * An ideal Q of R is primary if and only if every zero divisor in R/Q is nilpotent. (Compare this to the case of prime ideals, where P is prime if and only if every zero divisor in R/P is actually zero.) * Any prime ideal is primary, and moreover an ideal is prime if and only if it is primary and semiprime. * Every primary ideal is primal.For the proof of the second part see the article of Fuchs. * If Q is a primary ideal, then the radical of Q is necessarily a prime ideal P, and this ideal is called the associated prime ideal of Q. In this situation, Q is said to be P-primary. ** On the other hand, an ideal whose radical is prime is not necessarily primary: for example, if R = k[x,y,z]/(x y - z^2), \\\\mathfrak{p} = (\\\\overline{x}, \\\\overline{z}), and \\\\mathfrak{q} = \\\\mathfrak{p}^2, then \\\\mathfrak{p} is prime and \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathfrak{q}} = \\\\mathfrak{p}, but we have \\\\overline{x} \\\\overline{y} = {\\\\overline{z}}^2 \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{p}^2 = \\\\mathfrak{q}, \\\\overline{x} ot \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{q}, and {\\\\overline{y}}^n ot \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{q} for all n > 0, so \\\\mathfrak{q} is not primary. The primary decomposition of \\\\mathfrak{q} is (\\\\overline{x}) \\\\cap ({\\\\overline{x}}^2, \\\\overline{x} \\\\overline{z}, \\\\overline{y}); here (\\\\overline{x}) is \\\\mathfrak{p}-primary and ({\\\\overline{x}}^2, \\\\overline{x} \\\\overline{z}, \\\\overline{y}) is (\\\\overline{x}, \\\\overline{y}, \\\\overline{z})-primary. *** An ideal whose radical is maximal, however, is primary. *** Every ideal with radical is contained in a smallest -primary ideal: all elements such that for some . The smallest -primary ideal containing is called the th symbolic power of . * If P is a maximal prime ideal, then any ideal containing a power of P is P-primary. Not all P-primary ideals need be powers of P; for example the ideal (x, y2) is P-primary for the ideal P = (x, y) in the ring k[x, y], but is not a power of P. * If A is a Noetherian ring and P a prime ideal, then the kernel of A \\\\to A_P, the map from A to the localization of A at P, is the intersection of all P-primary ideals.Atiyah‚ÄìMacdonald, Corollary 10.21 * A finite nonempty product of \\\\mathfrak{p}-primary ideals is \\\\mathfrak{p}-primary but an infinite product of \\\\mathfrak{p}-primary ideals may not be \\\\mathfrak p-primary; since for example, in a Noetherian local ring with maximal ideal \\\\mathfrak m, \\\\cap_{n > 0} \\\\mathfrak{m}^n = 0 (Krull intersection theorem) where each \\\\mathfrak{m}^n is \\\\mathfrak{m}-primary. In fact, in a Noetherian ring, a nonempty product of \\\\mathfrak{p}-primary ideals Q_i is \\\\mathfrak{p}-primary if and only if there exists some integer n > 0 such that \\\\mathfrak{p}^n \\\\subset \\\\cap_i Q_i.

Blocked since the 1920s by two dams built by the BC Electric Railway at Stave Falls and one at Ruskin, the only free-flowing parts of the Stave today are the between Ruskin Dam and the Fraser and the from its source in Garibaldi Provincial Park to the head of Stave Lake. Prior to power development the total length of the river was c. . History The name Stave River was conferred in about 1828 by Hudson's Bay Company employees at Fort Langley, as the forests lining its banks were preferred for the production of staves used in the making of barrels for the export of fish. online at Google Books The native name for the river is forgotten, although modern-day Sto:lo and Kwantlen refer to it as Skayuks (\\"everyone died\\"), also the name given to one of three villages that were located in the delta marshlands of the lower reaches of the river at the time of non-native settlement (1870s onwards). The name is a reference to consequences of the successive smallpox plagues and other disease pandemics which destroyed the populations and cultures of the Fraser Valley. Terrain The lower Stave valley comprises over half the surface territory of the District of Mission although it remains mostly forested mountainside. The terrain of the lower valley is gentle though hilly, with dense oldgrowth and dense deciduous second growth in some areas. Marginal farms, mostly pastures carved out of the forests, can be found in the Silverhill, Silverdale and Stave Gardens areas. The Stave delta, formerly an oxbow lake, has been partly drained and dyked to form Silvermere Lake, part of a 1950s vintage real estate development; the oxbow's central island was transformed by the dredgings into a hill upon which the developer's private estate was built. It is now a Royal Canadian Mounted Police training facility. The waters of the lower Stave are semi-tidal, as the tidal bore on the Fraser River ends farther upstream at Mission City. During the spring freshet of the Fraser the volume and force of that river's flow blocks the Stave, causing it to back up and forming a lake between the Fraser and Ruskin Dam. North of Stave Lake the Stave's valley is intensely mountainous, containing some of the most rugged terrain in the province and also some of its highest rainfalls; access is extremely difficult. Overlooking Stave Lake at its north end are Mount Judge Howay, elevation , and Mount Robie Reid, elevation , and nearby are Robertson Peak at and many other summits. The upper Stave basin forms the southeastern part of Garibaldi Provincial Park, and adjoining it on its southeast is the Judge Howay Provincial Recreation Area - designated for recreation but highly inaccessible other than to seasoned mountaineers. Fishery The original salmon fishery was severely affected by the damming of the river but its lower stretches remain popular with sport fishermen, especially in search of steelhead. The hydro corporation has worked in cooperation with the federal Department of Fisheries to rework the gravel bars and channels below Ruskin Dam, but this has had only marginal effect relative to the former size of the salmon runs. Stave and Hayward Lakes have a kokanee population as well as other fish such as trout, and are sometimes stocked. Industry The Stave River's valley has been extensively logged. The only operating mills on its length are now near the Fraser at Ruskin but there are a few ruins of mills lining its western shore, including the remains of a very large cedar shake mill adjacent to the Stave Falls dam. Almost all of the mills on the Stave were focused on the production of shakes and some of its mills were among the highest-producing in the world. The north end of the lake can not be reached by road so the only option is by boat or air charter to a small bush strip. Hydropower developments There are Stave Falls Dam (1912), Ruskin Dam (1930) and the Alouette Dam (1928) on the shore of Stave Lake where a diversion from Alouette Lake comes through a low mountainside. On the upper Stave River, beyond the north end of Stave Lake there are two run- of-the-river hydroelectricity projects, Lamont Creek (28 MW) and Upper Stave River (33.5 MW) both built in 2010 by Cloudworks Energy Inc.Cloudworks Energy Inc. website a private company based around the BC government's Independent Power Projects (IPP's) legislation, which guarantees such producers sales to BC Hydro.

A 2008 Clarion-Ledger article reported the Jackson Academy board was aware that LaSalle University, where Taylor had obtained his doctoral degree, was a diploma mill, but decided to hire Taylor on the basis of his other accomplishments. In 2014, the school was selected as an Apple Distinguished School. =Racial segregation= For the 1965‚Äì1966 school year, 41% of Jackson Academy's tuition revenue came from grants provided by the state of Mississippi. In 1969, in Coffey v. State Educational Finance Commission the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi ruled that, since, in the court's opinion, Jackson Academy would refuse to admit qualified Black students, the tuition grant program violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.Coffey v. State Educational Finance Commission 296 F. Supp. 1389 (S.D. Miss. 1969) Jackson Academy's enrollment tripled in 1970 when a court ordered Jackson public schools to desegregate. Later in 1970, Jackson Academy lost its tax exempt status after the school declined to provide the IRS with documentation that the school had race blind admissions policy. In 1973, the FCC was asked to revoke WLBT's broadcasting license because the station's largest shareholder, William Mounger, also served as a Jackson Academy Vice President. The FCC filing stated that, since Mounger was affiliated with an institution that practiced racial segregation, he was not fit to hold a broadcasting license. In 1974, the FCC rejected the complaint as untimely since the evidence of Mounger's association with the school and the school's discriminatory practices was available from at least 1969.United States.

The school resumed classes in temporary facilities provided by local churches. Jackson Academy was forced to vacate the churches after a civil rights attorney filed a lawsuit to force the IRS to remove the churches' tax exempt status since the churches were aiding a racially segregated school. The attorney who filed the IRS complaint, Frank Parker, recalled that he received so many threats of violence that he had to leave Mississippi for several weeks. As of 1982, no African-Americans had ever applied to or attended Jackson Academy. The headmaster Glenn Cain explained \\"People of like kind educate better together.\\" In 1986, the school enrolled its first two Black students. Jackson Academy was the first segregation academy in the Jackson area to enroll black students. In 2001, Jackson Academy had its first black graduate.

It is between the Luton/Dunstable urban area (to the north), and Hertfordshire (to the south). The western border of the parish is Watling Street, to the west of which is Kensworth. The northern and eastern border are generally formed by the railway line and the M1. To the south-east of the parish is the parish of Slip End, and to the south is Markyate, in Hertfordshire. Caddington village and the nearby hamlet of Aley Green are in the south of the parish.The Aley Green pages listed under External links state that Aley Green is in the parish of Caddington. But the cemetery and the southern end of Mancroft Road, which are in the parish of Slip End, are sometimes also described as Aley Green (for example, in postal addresses and on Google Maps). The hamlet of Chaul End lies in the north of the parish, and at the border with Luton there is Caddington Park with Skimpot in its postal address. The Zouches Farm radio tower is situated in the north- west of the parish. History The place-name 'Caddington' is first attested in a list from circa 1000 AD of the manors of St Paul's Cathedral in the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where it appears as Caddandun. It appears as Cadandune in the Codex diplomaticus √¶vi Saxonici of circa 1053, and as Cadendone in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name means 'Cada's down or hill'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.80. The parish of Caddington was formerly partly in Hertfordshire and partly in Bedfordshire, but under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1888, confirmed in 1897, it was transferred wholly to Bedfordshire.British History Online: Caddington, accessed September 2017. A part of Caddington parish was transferred in 1877 to Markyate ecclesiastical district upon its formation from surrounding parishes. Caddington was once the centre of a thriving brick industry built around the rich source of clay. In 1908 there were two major brick fields. A \\"Caddington Blue\\" was a well-known engineering brick. Yet the assertion relating to the Caddington Blue is regarded by some as suspect: During the 1970s Bedfordshire County Council in conjunction with the Royal Commission On Historical Monuments (England), published the book Brickmaking: A History and Gazetteer.Brickmaking: A History and Gazetteer, Survey of Bedfordshire; Author: Alan Cox, Contributors: Bedfordshire (England) County Council, Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (England); Edition illustrated; Publisher: Bedfordshire County Council, 1979; ; 110 pages. The book identifies 17 specific sites within the Caddington locale which are credited with producing \\"Greys\\". The common name for the plum-coloured brick produced from the flinty brick earths excavated from an area from Kensworth through Caddington to Stopsley is \\"Luton Grey\\". Much of Caddington is now urban and there has been much residential development in recent years with the provision of local facilities such as shops, schools and a public hall. Caddington still retains its village green and nearby is the medieval parish church, restored in Victorian times. Manshead CE Academy (formerly Dunstable Grammar School and then Manshead School) relocated to Caddington in 1971. Markyate Priory, disestablished in 1537, was situated in Caddington. Caddington has had various schools such as Willowfield and Heathfield Lower Schools and Five Oaks Middle School but these have since been combined into Caddington Village School.

After the death of his grandfather in 1880, aged 13 he rejoined his parents in England, where he was educated at grammar schools in Bolton and Nottingham, where his father successively removed. After studying at University College in Nottingham, he taught in the high school at Ashton, Cheshire from 1888, where the Headmaster was the Rev. F. H. Mentha, MA. His influence over Campbell made him receptive to the Oxford Philosophy proclaimed by Dean Paget. This resulted in his confirmation in the Church of England and in his preparation for the priesthood. A boy at the school wrote of Campbell to his predecessor: > \\"We have got a curlywigged old fellow in your place, called Campbell, and I > think he must be a B.A., or M.A., or something because he wears a hat and > gown, and I don't know whether his hair is his own. He is going to try and > teach us Chemistry soon, but he seems to know only what he gets out of the > textbook...\\"Wilkerson, Albert H., The Rev. R J. Campbell ‚Äì The Man And His > Message Francis Griffiths, London (1907) pg 7 On 8 June 1889, he married Mary Elizabeth Campbell (n√©e Slack) (1861‚Äì1924), a member of his father's congregation at the United Free Methodist Church in Nottingham.Bateman, Charles T., R. J. Campbell, M.A. ‚Äì Pastor of the City Temple, London S.W. Partridge & Co, London (1903) pg 17 Their infant son, Charles Edgar Campbell, died in 1891. In 1892 Campbell went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated in 1895 in Honours in the School of Modern History and Political Science. He matriculated at Oxford as Reginald John Campbell, the names by which he was then commonly known. He graduated MA in 1902. During his time at Christ Church Campbell preached in the villages around Oxford.Wilkerson, pg 7 He was a non-smoker and a teetotaller. He had gone up to Oxford with the intention of becoming a clergyman in the Church of England, but in spite of the influence of Bishop Gore, then head of the Pusey House, and of Dean Paget (afterwards Bishop of Oxford), his Scottish and Irish Nonconformist blood was too strong, and at that time he abandoned the idea in order to take up work in the Congregational ministry, following in the footsteps of his grandfather, the Rev. James Campbell.Bateman, pg 25 He joined the Congregational Church which met in George Street, Oxford under the Rev A. R. Ezard. The City Temple The City Temple in Holborn On leaving Oxford he accepted a call to the small Congregational church in Union Street, Brighton, commencing his ministry there in the summer of 1895. Within a year Campbell filled the church, and to accommodate the crowds who came to hear him preach the Union Street church merged with another larger church in Queens' Square in Brighton. Marie Corelli always attended the Union Street services during Campbell's time there.Wilkerson, pg 12 He quickly became famous at Brighton as a preacher, so much so that in the Summer of 1902 Joseph Parker, whose health was declining, invited Campbell to assist him by preaching at the City Temple's Thursday mid-day services. Following Parker's death in November 1902 Campbell was chosen as his successor and was inaugurated as minister of the City Temple‚ÄîLondon's \\"cathedral of nonconformity\\"‚Äîon 21 May 1903.Clare, Albert 'The City Temple 1640‚Äì1940: The Tercentenary Commemoration Volume' Independent Press, Ltd., London (1940) pg 139 While his predecessor was theologically conservative, Campbell was emphatically not. A Socialist politically,Campbell: 'A Spiritual Pilgrimage', P. 131 his theology proved as radical as his politics. Seven thousand people attended the services on his first Sunday. He was expected to preach twice on Sundays and at the popular Thursday lunchtime services. His sermons, which addressed both issues of the day and doctrinal questions, were instantly published and attracted much attention both in Britain and in the United States. Picture postcards of Campbell were soon on sale alongside those of actresses and other celebrities of the day, and the R. J. Campbell Birthday Book containing his ‚Äòfavourite poetical quotations, portrait and autograph‚Äô could also be purchased.Willis, Mary A. The R J Campbell Birthday Book: Selections from the Sermons and Prayers of the Reverend R J Campbell, MA, with His Favourite Poetical Quotations Christian Commonwealth Co., London (1904) The publicity which attended his arrival in London rarely left him for the next dozen years.Robbins, Keith 'The Spiritual Pilgrimage of the Rev. R. J. Campbell' ‚Äì The Journal of Ecclesiastical History April 1979 30 : pp 261‚Äì276 At the City Temple he notably enhanced his popularity as a preacher, and became one of the recognized leaders of Nonconformist opinion. As his fame spread he was invited on a preaching tour of America and Canada. He left Southampton on 13 June 1903, arriving in New York on 20 June. He preached or spoke at venues in New York, Boston, and Chicago. At Ocean Grove he spoke to a crowd of 10,000. He also preached in Toronto and Montreal, visiting Niagara Falls on the way.Bateman, pg 130 Controversy 'Spy' in Vanity Fair, November 1904 Campbell was criticised for an article published in the National Review in October 1904 in which he described British working men as \\" ... often lazy, unthrifty, and improvident, while they are sometimes immoral, foul-mouthed, and untruthful\\". Crowds of angry and threatening working men gathered outside the City Temple on the Sunday following where they waited for Campbell. In an attempt to explain his meaning he appeared at a meeting of the Paddington and Kensington Trades and Labour Councils on 21 October 1904 during which he disavowed any intention of making an indiscriminate attack on the workers. Although he was severely heckled by his audience during the delivery of his speech, Campbell's courage in facing the unions and acknowledging the truth of the reports as to his previous comments was recognised and he was loudly cheered at the conclusion of his address.'The Rev R J Campbell ‚Äì The Workers Criticised' The Advertiser 24 October 1904 In the November 1904 edition of The Young Man Campbell explained himself further in an article called 'The Truth about the Working Man Controversy': > \\"...Two-thirds of the national drinking bill is incurred by the working man. > His keenest struggles are for shorter hours and better wages, but not that > he may employ them for higher ends. He is often lazy and untruthful. Unlike > the American worker, he has comparatively little aspiration or ambition....\\" > > \\"Let it be understood that, as here stated, they (his statements) are not > intended to apply to working men as a whole, but to large classes among > them, which classes, it is to be feared, constitute a majority.

R J Campbell and Working Men' The Sydney Morning Herald > 9 December 1904 Campbell with \`Abdu'l-Bah√° in 1911 Questions also soon began to be raised about the way that Campbell introduced Biblical criticism into his preaching,Campbell: 'A Spiritual Pilgrimage', P. 167 questioning the traditional ascription of books, and the origins of the text. As his sermons were published, this brought them to the notice of readers throughout the nation, and beyond.Campbell: 'A Spiritual Pilgrimage', P. 172 The theology held by Campbell and a number of his friends came to be known as 'The New Theology'.Campbell, 'The New Theology' (London, Chapman and Hall, 1907), P. v Unwisely, Campbell decided to answer his critics by issuing a volume entitled simply The New Theology, a restatement of Christian beliefs to harmonize with modern critical views and beliefs.Campbell, 'The New Theology' (London, Chapman and Hall, 1907). Though he later withdrew the book, copies remain in circulation Looking back on it later, he felt that he had gone too far. \\"It was much too hastily written, was crude and uncompromising in statement, polemical in spirit, and gave a totally wrong impression of the sermons delivered week by week in the City Temple Pulpit\\".Campbell: 'A Spiritual Pilgrimage', P. 188 Support for the Independent Labour Party and further controversy In the ensuing decade, Campbell continued to read and reflect on the literature regarding the historical Jesus. His study persuaded him that the historical Jesus was nothing like the Jesus of liberal Protestantism but was rather much more nearly the way he is portrayed in Catholic tradition. In July 1907 he declared his conviction that Socialism was the practical form of Christianity; subsequently, he was invited to stand as a Labour Party candidate for Cardiff in the forthcoming elections.'Preacher Turns Socialist: The Rev. R.J. Campbell is invited to stand for Parliament' ‚Äì The New York Times 1 August 1907 He was elected to the executive of the Fabian Society in 1908, but was apparently too busy to ever attend a single committee meeting. He shared a platform with Keir Hardie on several occasions, most notably at a great meeting in Liverpool in March 1907.Robbins, P. 272 His association with the Independent Labour Party, precursor of the Labour Party was particularly significant in South Wales, where his appearance at a meeting at Ystalyfera was influential in the political development of the future Labour politician James Griffiths. There were also groups who regarded themselves as 'Campbellites' in many South Wales communities and this caused divisions in some nonconformist chapels, for example at Bethel, Gadlys near Aberdare. In February 1911 he again caused a stir when he announced at a meeting of the Theosophical Society in London that he believed in reincarnation, and that he believed that when Jesus returned for the Second Coming he would be reincarnated.'Campbell expects to be Reincarnated; Pastor of London City Temple Believes This Will Occur on Christ's Second Coming' The New York Times 5 February 1911 On 5 September 1911 Campbell met \`Abdu'l-Bah√°, the eldest son and successor of Bah√°'u'll√°h,Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 2 the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and invited him to give a public address in the City Temple a few days later.'Reginald John Campbell' on the 'Bah√° º√≠ Tributes' website In October 1911, accompanied by his wife and daughter, Hilda May (1891‚Äì1935), he embarked on a three-month preaching tour of the United States. Return to Anglicanism R.J. Campbell in 1914 In the summer of 1915, after a tour of the trenches during World War I, Campbell underwent a deep personal crisis, seeing a need for greater Christian unity, and for himself a return to the Church of England. This crisis, which led him to turn from being a liberal Protestant to being a liberal Catholic, came largely from his earlier researches into Biblical Criticism and the historical Jesus, his conclusions leading him to the opinion that the Jesus of liberal Protestantism did not exist, and that the historical Jesus was much closer to that taught in Catholic doctrine.Campbell, 'A Spiritual Journey', P. 247 He wrote: > \\"It was the Christ of the Catholic Church that stood forth from the newer > criticism of the gospel sources, not the Christ of liberal Protestantism. > This was thrust forcibly upon my attention. The alternatives were obvious : > Either Jesus was what the Catholic Church said He was or He did not exist; > either He was the Man from heaven, a complete break with the natural order > of things, the representative of a transcendental order, supernatural, > super-rational super-everything, or He was nothing. This was scarcely the > Christ of Protestantism at all, whether liberal or conservative.\\"Campbell, > 'A Spiritual Pilgrimage', P. 250 He considered rewriting his book, The New Theology, keeping to the same sequence of subjects, but correcting all the points in which it was at variance with Catholic doctrine. Eventually, he felt that the book's title made such a move impossible, so instead, in March 1915, he decided to withdraw the book and purchased the publishing rights to prevent its possible re- issue.Campbell, 'A Spiritual Pilgrimage', P. 277 In October 1915 Campbell preached his last sermon at the City Temple and resigned from the Congregational church; a few days later he was received back into the Church of England by Bishop Gore at Cuddesdon. In October 1916 he was ordained as an Anglican priest,'Death of Dr Reginald J. Campbell' ‚Äì The Glasgow Herald ‚Äì 2 March 1956 and became attached to the staff of St Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham before appointment as Vicar of Christ Church, Westminster from 1917 to 1921, and then at Holy Trinity in Brighton from 1924 to 1930. On rejoining the Church of England, and at the request of some old Congregational friends, with whom he remained on good terms, he wrote an account of the development of his thought in A Spiritual Pilgrimage (1916). In 1919 he was granted the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from the University of Oxford.'Rev. R.J. Campbell D.D.' in British Preachers 1925: the Men and their Message Fleming H. Revell Company, London & Edinburgh (1925) p.12 His biography of David Livingstone was published in 1929.

Largely forgotten at the time of his death, in his latter decades he had deliberately kept out of the limelight, seeking to avoid the fame that had pursued him during his early career, and which, perhaps, he had sought, and to live quietly and in relative obscurity. R.J. Campbell died in 1956 at his home, \\"Heatherdene\\", in Fairwarp in East Sussex aged 89. The funeral service was led by George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester. He was buried with his first wife and daughter in a grave which also contained the ashes of his second wife in the churchyard of St Peter's Church at West Blatchington, near Hove in East Sussex.

The garden began in 1912 when Frederick Sayen (1885‚Äì1981) purchased the site with his wife, Anne Mellon (1886‚Äì1977), a daughter of the Mellon family. The Sayens built a \\"bungalow\\" home in the Arts and Crafts style, though with Victorian interior design, and surrounded it with plants and flowers acquired during world travels. The principal collections include species from China, Japan, and England. The Sayen site became municipal property in 1988, when Hamilton Township purchased the site from developer David Cellars.

Later that year Newbery became Commonwealth champion by winning the gold medal in the 1m springboard event at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. She won a silver medal two days later in the 3m springboard. At the 2000 Olympic Games Newbery finished fourth in the synchronised 3m springboard event. Four years later, she won a gold medal in the 10m platform event at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympic Games ahead of Lao Lishi of China and fellow Australian Loudy Tourky. In the 2005 Australia Day Honours Newbery was a recipient of the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM). Also in 2005, she was inducted into the Australian Institute of Sport 'Best of the Best'. Personal life Newbery took time away from diving for almost a year while pregnant with her first child. She gave birth to her son Jet in 2002. In May 2004, she married fellow diver Robert Newbery; they both competed for Australia at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics. Their second son, Ryder, was born in 2006. Post- diving career In 2009 Newbery told Australian magazine Woman's Day that she was admitting herself to a psychiatric hospital for severe depression. She had also made suicide attempts. In 2014, Newbery pled guilty to drug charges and was placed in a drug diversion programme after being arrested in possession of methamphetamines. In November 2018, Newbery was charged with six counts of theft, leading to a three-month prison sentence. Her sentence was suspended and she was released on parole.

The book is autobiographical, and it focuses on Canseco's days as a major leaguer, his marriages, his daughter, and off-field incidents including his barroom brawl in 2001. The book deals primarily with anabolic steroids, drawing upon the personal experiences of Canseco. He takes personal credit for introducing steroids to baseball and names former teammates Mark McGwire, Juan Gonz√°lez, Rafael Palmeiro, Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez, and Jason Giambi as fellow steroid users. He also believes he was blackballed by baseball when Bud Selig decided that the league needed to be cleaned up. One of Juiced's central precepts is that steroid use is not in and of itself a bad thing, as long as the person is being monitored by a physician and the dosages are small. Canseco believes that steroids cannot only improve the game of baseball but also improve and lengthen lives and that more research needs to be done on the topic. Canseco claims to discredit many of the myths regarding steroids, asserting that they do not break down a person's body if used correctly and can actually help a person recover quickly from injuries. During the A&E; Network's one-hour documentary, Jose Canseco: The Last Shot, Canseco said he \\"regrets mentioning players [as steroid users].

It stands on a chalk plateau at the edge of the Chiltern Hills, between 130 and 160 metres above sea level. The village green is at the centre of Chipperfield on the edge of the 117 acre Chipperfield Common. The rural parish includes the hamlet of Tower Hill. History Prehistoric activity in the area is testified by the presence of two tumuli on the common. Besides being burial mounds these may have designated the boundary of lands worked by Bronze Age communities in the Gade and Chess valleys.Explanatory sign beside tumuli on Chipperfield common. For centuries Chipperfield was an outlying settlement of Kings Langley consisting only of scattered houses. The first documentary evidence of the name is found in 1316, when Edward II bequeathed 'the Manor House of Langley the closes adjoining together with the vesture of Chepervillewode for Fewel and other Necessaries' to the Dominican Black Friars. The name is probably derived from the Anglo-Saxon ceapere meaning a trader together with feld meaning field. This suggests that there was some form of market or trading of goods here in early times. The Manor House, on the east side of the common, is a late medieval hall house but was extensively rebuilt by Thomas Gulston, before 1591. It is a Grade II* listed building. By the 1830s Chipperfield was large enough to warrant the building of both Anglican and Baptist churches and became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1848. For a number of years the Lords of the Manor were the Blackwell family who were benefactors to the village. Two of the family's sons were killed during World War One. Second Lieutenant Charles Blackwell (4th battalion, Royal Fusiliers) was wounded at the Second Battle of Ypres and died in France in July 1915. Lieutenant William Gordon Blackwell (8th battalion, Royal Fusiliers), the younger of the two brothers, was killed in action during the Battle of the Somme on 5 October 1916. As a memorial the Blackwell family gave the village the village club, which remained a club until recently. It has now been renamed Blackwells and is both a bar and cafe open to the public next to the common. The names of 38 local men who died in World War One are inscribed on the War Memorial on the village green and repeated on a memorial plaque inside the church. An additional name appears on a war grave in the churchyard. There are also the names of 10 men who died in World War Two.Chipperfield Memorials Roll of Honour, 11 January 2004 In 1936 Chipperfield Common was gifted to the local authority to be maintained in consultation with the people of Chipperfield.The Village Official website Since the end of World War II the village has dramatically expanded with housing estates built during the 1940s and an extensive council estate to the east of Croft Lane built in the 1960s. In 1963 Chipperfield was split off from Kings Langley and Chipperfield Parish Council was created.Village History At Chipperfield Village website. accessed December 2013 In 1959 the actor and comedian Peter Sellers purchased the Manor House on the east side of the common.

The common is criss-crossed by way-marked paths and contains eight veteran Spanish sweet chestnut trees (Castanea sativa), one having a girth of about 21 feet. They are estimated to date back to the 1600s and believed to be descended from specimens bought from Spain in the Middle Ages.Chipperfield Common At the Chipperfield Village website.

Accessed January 2014 The common has several ponds, notably the Apostles Pond, which has twelve willow trees surrounding it and was once a monastery fishpond. The village cricket club has a green and pavilion on the northern edge of the common. Two Brewers Inn stands adjacent to the common. It was founded by Robert Waller as an ale house in 1799, originally the middle one of a row of three cottages. It eventually took over its neighbours to make a long frontage on the green. A modern hotel extension has been built to the rear. The pub acquired fame as the training quarters for many notable 19th- century prize-fighters such as Jem Mace, Thomas Sayers and Bob Fitzsimmons who sparred in the Club Room and took their runs round the nearby Chipperfield Common.The Two Brewers pub Chipperfield History page Accessed October 2007 Facilities in the village include two more pubs, a shop, post office, Kia and Land Rover dealerships, a delicatessen, an Indian restaurant and two garden centres. Chipperfield has three churches: Church of England, Catholic and Baptist. It also has a primary school, St Pauls C of E, with strong ties to the church, which is located adjacent to the school. Next to the school is a village club called Blackwell's, and tennis courts owned by CTC. Every year, a pantomime is held in the Village Hall, which is organised by the Chipperfield Theatre Group. There is a lively range of musical activity in the village centred mainly on St Paul's Church, which boasts a fine three manual organ. The choir mounts several choral evensong services each year and a remarkable diversity of concerts, some with orchestra. The Festival of Lessons and Carols at Christmas is accompanied by organ and orchestra and attracts a packed church. Chipperfield Choral Society rehearses in the Village Hall and maintins a popular following at its concerts both at St Paul's and elsewhere, locally. The Cricket Club periodically hosts Jazz concerts. Chipperfield Corinthians FC football team play in the top division of the Herts County Senior League, with a reserve team in the Herts County Reserve and Development West League.

She is currently one of the main contributors to the theory of linguistic relativity. She is a Searle Scholar, a McDonnell Scholar, recipient of a National Science Foundation Career award, and an American Psychological Association Distinguished Scientist. She is Professor of Cognitive Science at UCSD. She previously served on the faculty at MIT and at Stanford.  Biography  Boroditsky was born in Belarus to a Jewish family.Lost In Translation: The Power Of Language To Shape How We View The World January 29, 2018, NPR When she was 12 years old, her family emigrated to the United States, where she learned to speak English as her fourth language.Lost In Translation: The Power Of Language To Shape How We View The World January 29, 2018, NPR As a teenager she began thinking about the degree to which language differences could shape an argument and exaggerate the differences between people. She received her B.A. degree in cognitive science at Northwestern University in 1996. She went to graduate school at Stanford University, where she obtained her Ph.D. in cognitive psychology in 2001. She worked under Gordon Bower who was her thesis advisor at Stanford. Boroditsky also conducted research at Stanford University. She became an assistant professor in the department of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT before she was hired by Stanford in 2004. Gordon Bower says: \\"It's exceedingly rare for us to hire back our own graduate students.. [s]he brought a very high IQ and a tremendous ability for penetrating analysis.\\"Lost In Translation: The Power Of Language To Shape How We View The World January 29, 2018, NPR At Stanford, she was an assistant professor of psychology, philosophy, and linguistics. Boroditsky is currently professor of cognitive science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). She studies language and cognition, focusing on interactions between language, cognition, and perception. Her research combines insights and methods from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology. Her work has provided new insights into the controversial question of whether the languages we speak shape the way we think (Linguistic relativity). She uses powerful examples of cross- linguistic differences in thought and perception that stem from syntactic or lexical differences between languages. Her papers and lectures have influenced the fields of psychology, philosophy, and linguistics in providing evidence and research against the notion that human cognition is largely universal and independent of language and culture. She was named a Searle Scholar and has received several awards for her research, including an NSF CAREER award, the Marr Prize from the Cognitive Science Society, and the McDonnell Scholar Award. In addition to scholarly work, Boroditsky also gives popular science lectures to the general public, and her work has been covered in news and media outlets. Boroditsky talks about how all the languages differ from one another, whether in grammatical differences or contain different sounds, vocabulary, or patterns. Boroditsky studies how the languages we speak shape the way we think. It was first detected by John Haviland that some languages, unlike English, do not use body-centered terms to describe position, but instead use cardinal directions, such as North, South, East and West. In order to speak a language using cardinal directions, one must stay oriented in order to speak the language. It was originally thought that humans were biologically incapable of being directionally oriented via cardinal directions and that only birds and animals were capable. Depending on the language one speaks, may or may not require one to be directionally oriented, in order to use terms of direction while speaking.  Research  Boroditsky is known for her research relating to cognitive science, how language affects the way we think, and other linguistic related topics. One of her main research topics focuses on how people with different linguistic backgrounds act or have different behaviors when exposed to certain events. On the individual level, Boroditsky is interested in how the languages we speak influence and shape the way we think. She has done studies comparing English to other native speakers of a different language and seeing the differences in the way they think and act given a certain scenario. For example, English and Russian differentiate between cups and glasses. In Russian, the difference between a cup and a glass is based on its shape instead of its material as in English. Another example of her work is how she highlighted the difference in the organization of time and space from English to Mandarin. In her article ‚ÄúDoes language shape thought? Mandarin and English speakers' conceptions of time‚Äù Boroditsky has argued for a weak version of linguistic relativity, providing a ground for it through her cross-language studies on verb tenses carried out with English and Mandarin speakers. She argues that English speakers conceive time in a way that is analogous to their conception of spatial horizontal movement, whereas native Mandarin speakers associate it with vertical movement. She has also stated that these differences do not totally determine conceptualization, since it is possible for the speakers of a language to be taught to think like the speakers of other languages do, without needing to learn any such language. Therefore, and according to Boroditsky, mother tongues may have an effect on cognition, but it is not determining.Boroditsky, Lera, \\"Does language shape thought? Mandarin and English speakers' conceptions of time\\" Psychological Science, 13(2), 185‚Äì188. A study published in 2000, observed that \\"the processing of the concrete domain of space could modulate the processing of the abstract domain of time, but not the other way around.\\" The frequent use of a mental metaphor connects it to the abstract concept and helps the mind to store non-concrete informations in the long-term memory. Boroditsky has also done research on metaphors and their relation to crime. Her work has suggested that some conventional and systematic metaphors influence the way people reason about the issues they describe. For instance, previous work has found that people were more likely to want to fight back against a crime \\"beast\\" by increasing the police force but more likely to want to diagnose and treat a crime \\"virus\\" through social reform.

History  = Origins = Both Japan's history of technology and mythology play a role in the development of its science fiction. Some early Japanese literature, for example, contain elements of proto-science fiction. The early Japanese tale of \\"Urashima Tar≈ç\\" involves traveling forwards in time to a distant future, and was first described in the Nihongi (720). It was about a young fisherman named Urashima Taro who visits an undersea palace and stays there for three days. After returning home to his village, he finds himself three hundred years in the future, where he is long forgotten, his house in ruins, and his family long dead. The 10th-century Japanese narrative The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter may also be considered proto-science fiction. The protagonist of the story, Kaguya-hime, is a princess from the Moon who is sent to Earth for safety during a celestial war, and is found and raised by a bamboo cutter in Japan. She is later taken back to the Moon by her real extraterrestrial family. A manuscript illustration depicts a round flying machine similar to a flying saucer. (cf. ) Science fiction in the standard modern sense began with the Meiji Restoration and the importation of Western ideas. The first science fiction of any influence to be translated into Japanese were the novels of Jules Verne. The translation of Around the World in Eighty Days was published in 1878-1880, followed by his other works with immense popularity. The word was coined as a translation of \\"scientific novel\\" as early as 1886. Shunr≈ç Oshikawa is generally considered as the ancestor of Japanese science fiction. His debut work Kaitei Gunkan (Undersea warship), published in 1900, described submarines and predicted a coming Russo-Japanese war. During the period between the world wars, Japanese science fiction was more influenced by American science fiction. A popular writer of the era was J≈´za Unno, sometimes called \\"the father of Japanese science fiction.\\" The literary standards of this era, and the previous, tended to be low. Prior to World War II, Japanese rarely if ever saw science fiction as worthwhile literature. Instead, it was considered a form of trivial literature for children. A character considered to be the first full-fledged superhero is the Japanese Kamishibai character ≈ågon Bat, who debuted in 1930, eight years before Superman. Another similar Japanese Kamishibai superhero was , who debuted in the early 1930s, also years before Superman. = After World War II = 1968 December issue of Hayakawa's S-F Magazine Manga artist Osamu Tezuka, who debuted in 1946, was a major influence on the later science fiction authors. Lost World (1948), Metropolis (1949), and Nextworld (1951) are known as Tezuka's early SF trilogy. Avant- garde author K≈çb≈ç Abe wrote works that are within science fiction genre, and he later had close relationship with SF authors. His Inter Ice Age 4 (1958-1959) is considered the first Japanese full-length science fiction novel. The era of modern Japanese science fiction began with the influence of paperbacks that the US occupation army brought to Japan after World War II. The first science fiction magazine in Japan, , was created in 1954 but was discontinued after only one issue. Several short-lived magazines followed Seiun in the Japanese market, but none experienced great success. Science fiction in Japan gained popularity in the early 1960s. Both the (since 1959) and the science fiction coterie magazine Uch≈´jin (1957‚Äì2013) began publication in this decade. The first Japan SF Convention was held in 1962. A writers' association, Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of Japan (SFWJ) was formed in 1963 with eleven members. Notable authors like Sakyo Komatsu, Yasutaka Tsutsui, Taku Mayumura, Ryo Hanmura and Aritsune Toyota debuted at the Hayakawa SF contest. Other notable authors, such as Shinichi Hoshi, Ryu Mitsuse, Kazumasa Hirai, Aran Kyodomari and Yoshio Aramaki, were also published Komatsu, Tsutsui, Mayumura, Hanmura and Toyota debuted by their application works at the Hayakawa SF contest. But Mitsuse and Hirai did not. These writers were well-known by the editors of SF magazine and SF-related people in those days. ref: ja:Hayakawa SF contest. . Though influenced by the West, their work was distinctively Japanese. For example, Kazumasa Hirai, Aritsune Toyota and Takumi Shibano wrote novels as well as plots for SF-anime and SF-manga, which are some of the most prominent examples of Japanese contributions to the genre of science fiction. The contributions of excellent translators such as Tetsu Yano, Masahiro Noda, Hisashi Asakura and Norio Ito introduced English science fiction to readers in Japan, and greatly influenced public opinion of science fiction. SF Magazine's first editor, Masami Fukushima was also an excellent novelist and translator. In visual media genre, film studio Toho spawned the Kaiju film genre in 1954 with Godzilla. Eiji Tsuburaya who directed the special effects for Toho's film formed his own studio and created Ultraman in 1966. Tezuka's manga Tetsuwan Atom (1952-1968) became the first Japanese TV animation series in 1963. = Infiltration and diffusion = Expo '70 Public interest in science fiction had risen notably in Japan by Expo '70. Komatsu's Nihon Chinbotsu (aka Japan Sinks, 1973) was a best-seller. Uch≈´ Senkan Yamato (aka Space Battleship Yamato), a work of anime placed in a science fiction setting, was aired, and Star Wars was screened in Japan in the late 1970s. The change in the nature of the science fiction genre in Japan that resulted from these events is often called \\"Infiltration and Diffusion\\" (Êµ∏ÈÄè„Å®Êã°Êï£ Shint≈ç to Kakusan). At this time, Hanmura's series and Hirai's Wolf Guy series became prototypes of later Japanese light novels through the works of Hideyuki Kikuchi, Baku Yumemakura, and Haruka Takachiho. In addition, new science fiction magazines such as Kis≈ç Tengai (Â•áÊÉ≥Â§©Â§ñ), SF Adventure (SF„Ç¢„Éâ„Éô„É≥„ÉÅ„É£„Éº) and SF H≈çseki (SFÂÆùÁü≥) were founded. A number of notable authors debuted in either SF Magazine or one of these new publications: Akira Hori, Jun'ya Yokota, Koji Tanaka, Masaki Yamada, Musashi Kanbe, Azusa Noa, Ch≈çhei Kanbayashi, K≈çsh≈´ Tani, Mariko Ohara, Ko Hiura, Hitoshi Kusakami, Motoko Arai, Baku Yumemakura, Yoshiki Tanaka and Hiroe Suga. In the 1980s, the audio-visual side of the Japanese science fiction genre continued to develop. Hayao Miyazaki's Kaze no Tani no Naushika (a.k.a. Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind) and Mamoru Oshi's Urusei Yatsura II: Beautiful Dreamer were first screened. On TV, real robot anime series, starting with Mobile Suit Gundam, were aired, and the science fiction artist group Studio Nue joined the staff of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Animators Hideaki Anno, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Takami Akai, and Shinji Higuchi, who had attracted attention by creating anime that had been exhibited at Daicon III and Daicon IV, established Studio Gainax. = Wintery age = Literary science fiction magazines started to disappear in the late 1980s when public attention increasingly switched to audio-visual media. The Hayakawa science fiction contest was also discontinued, removing a major outlet for the work of many writers. A number of science fiction and space opera writers, including Hosuke Nojiri, Hiroshi Yamamoto, Ryuji Kasamine, and Yuichi Sasamoto, began writing \\"light novel\\" genre paperback science fiction and fantasy novels, which are primarily marketed to teenagers. This period, during which literary science fiction declined, has been labeled \\"the Wintery Age\\" (ÂÜ¨„ÅÆÊôÇ‰ª£ Fuyu no Jidai). In the mainstream of science fiction, Yoshiki Tanaka published Ginga Eiyu Densetsu (a.k.a. Legend of the Galactic Heroes) series. The boundary between science fiction novels and light novels was blurred in the 1990s. Although Hiroyuki Morioka's Seikai no Monshou series is considered to be in the vein of the light novel, the series was published by Hayakawa Shobo as part of the mainstream science fiction world. On the other hand, light novel writers like Sasamoto and Nojiri have also published hard SF novels. As a continuation of infiltration and diffusion of science fiction into mainstream literature, Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe, who later received Nobel Prize in Literature, wrote two science fiction novels in 1990-1991. Haruki Murakami received World Fantasy Award for Kafka on the Shore in 2006, and his 2009 novel 1Q84 was a bestseller. Meanwhile, in visual fields, the new Gamera series (1995, 1996, 1999) directed by Shusuke Kaneko with visual effects by Shinji Higuchi, renewed the kaiju genre film. An anime television series Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995-1996), directed by Hideaki Anno, got phenomenal popularity. = 2000s = The 2000s (decade) saw a recovery in the market for literary SF. Science fiction books had solid sales compared to the overall decline of the publishing industry. SFWJ and Tokuma Shoten began the Japan SF Budding Writer Award contest in 1999, and Tokuma launched the quarterly magazine, SF Japan, in 2000 (ceased in 2011). Hayakawa started a new label, J Collection, in 2002. Kadokawa Haruki Corporation conducted Komatsu Saky≈ç Award contest in 2000 (ceased in 2009). A new Year's-Best anthology series, edited by Nozomi ≈åmori and Sanz≈ç Kusaka, started in 2008 by T≈çky≈ç S≈çgensha, and, from it, the Sogen SF Short Story Prize contest spun off in 2010. Among the finalists for the Komatsu Saky≈ç Award and debuting from J Collection, Keikaku It≈ç left a strong impression in his short career before dying of cancer in 2009. T≈ç Enj≈ç, crossing into mainstream literature, was nominated for the Akutagawa Prize, and eventually won it in 2012. Y≈´suke Miyauchi, who was a jury's special selection for the Sogen SF Short Story Prize in 2010, was nominated for the Naoki Award and won the Nihon SF Taisho in 2012 for his debut collection, . 65th World Science Fiction Convention was jointly held with the 46th Nihon SF Taikai in Yokohama, Japan, in 2007.  Sub-genres  = Kamishibai = Kamishibai is a form of street theater where oral storytellers illustrate their stories with painted art, which was popular in 1930s Japan. There were a variety of popular stories and themes in kamishibai, which are now seen in contemporary manga and anime. This includes one of the first superheroes, ≈ågon Bat (Golden Bat), who debuted in 1931. Another early kamishibai superhero was Prince of Gamma, who debuted in the early 1930s and anticipated elements of Superman, including a secret identity (his alter ego was a street urchin) and an extraterrestrial origin story. Both these early Japanese superheroes predate popular American superheroes such as Superman (1938 debut) and Batman (1939 debut). = Tokusatsu = Tokusatsu (Japanese: ÁâπÊíÆ, \\"special filming\\") is a Japanese term for live action film or television drama that makes heavy use of special effects. Tokusatsu entertainment often deals with science fiction. Tokusatsu has several sub-genres: *Kaiju monster films such as Godzilla, Gamera and Rodan *Tokusatsu movies science fiction films such as Warning from Space (1956), Invasion of the Neptune Men and The Green Slime *Tokusatsu superhero series Japanese television series such as Ultraman, Kamen Rider (Masked Rider), Super Sentai (Power Rangers) and Metal Hero (VR Troopers) *Mecha dramas such as Giant Robo and Ambassador Magma = Mecha = refers to science fiction genres that center on giant robots or machines (mechs) controlled by people. In Japan, mecha anime (also called \\"robot anime\\" in Japan) is one of the oldest genres in anime. There are two major sub-genres of mecha anime and manga: *Super robot („Çπ„Éº„Éë„Éº„É≠„Éú„ÉÉ„Éà s≈´pƒÅ robotto) Some of the first mecha featured in manga and anime were 'super robots'. The super robot genre features superhero-like giant robots that are often one-of-a-kind and the product of an ancient civilization, aliens or a mad scientist. These robots are usually piloted by Japanese teenagers via voice command or neural uplink, and are often powered by mystical or exotic energy sources. Examples include Mazinger Z (1972 debut), Getter Robo (1974 debut) and Gurren Lagann (2007). *Real robot („É™„Ç¢„É´„É≠„Éú„ÉÉ„Éà riaru robotto) The 'real robot' genre features robots that do not have mythical superpowers, but rather use largely conventional, albeit futuristic weapons and power sources, and are often mass-produced on a large scale for use in wars. The real robot genre also tends to feature more complex characters with moral conflicts and personal problems. The genre is therefore aimed primarily at young adults instead of children. Examples include Gundam (1979 debut), Macross (1983 debut) and Code Geass (2006 debut). = Cyberpunk = Japanese cyberpunk has roots in underground music culture, specifically the Japanese punk subculture that arose from the Japanese punk music scene in the 1970s. The filmmaker Sogo Ishii introduced this subculture to Japanese cinema with his punk films Panic High School (1978) and Crazy Thunder Road (1980), which portrayed the rebellion and anarchy associated with punk, and went on to become highly influential in underground film circles. Crazy Thunder Road in particular was an influential biker film, with a punk biker gang aesthetic that paved the way for Katsuhiro Otomo's influential cyberpunk franchise Akira. The Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of the manga series Akira, with its 1988 anime film adaptation later popularizing the subgenre. Akira inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and anime series such as Ghost in the Shell (1989), Battle Angel Alita (1990), Cowboy Bebop (1997) and Serial Experiments Lain (1998). = Steampunk = Japanese steampunk consists of steampunk manga comics and anime productions from Japan. Steampunk elements have consistently appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s, dating back to Osamu Tezuka's epic science- fiction trilogy consisting of Lost World (1948), Metropolis (1949) and Nextworld (1951). The steampunk elements found in manga eventually made their way into mainstream anime productions starting in the 1970s, including television shows such as Leiji Matsumoto's Space Battleship Yamato (1974) and the 1979 anime adaptation of Riyoko Ikeda's manga Rose of Versailles (1972). The most influential steampunk animator was Hayao Miyazaki, who was creating steampunk anime since the 1970s, starting with the television show Future Boy Conan (1978). His manga Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind (1982) and its 1984 anime film adaptation also contained steampunk elements. Miyazaki's most influential steampunk production was the Studio Ghibli anime film Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), which became a major milestone in the genre and has been described by The Steampunk Bible as \\"one of the first modern steampunk classics.\\" The success of Laputa inspired a wave of Japanese steampunk works, such as Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water (1990), Porco Rosso (1992), Sakura Wars (1996), Fullmetal Alchemist (2001), Howl's Moving Castle (2004) and Steamboy (2004). = Dieselpunk = Examples of Japanese dieselpunk include Hayao Miyazaki's manga Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind (1982) and its 1984 anime film adaptation, the anime film Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986) by Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and Squaresoft's Japanese role-playing game Final Fantasy VII (1997). = Isekai = is a subgenre of Japanese light novels, manga, anime and video games that revolve around a normal person from Earth being transported to, reborn or trapped in a parallel universe. While many isekai involve a fantasy world, a number of isekai instead involve a virtual world. The Digimon Adventure (1999 debut) and .hack (2002 debut) franchises were some of the first works to present the concept of isekai as a virtual world (inspired by video games), with Sword Art Online (also 2002 debut) following in their footsteps. Some isekai are set in a formerly virtual world that turns into a real one, such as in Log Horizon (2010 debut) and Overlord (2010 debut).

Raymond was among the first of a small band of Norman knights who landed on the South coast of Ireland before being reinforced by a larger force led by Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. He was active consolidating Norman rule over Ireland before he retired to his estates in Waterford where he died in the late 12th century. Family and youth Raymond grew up in Wales, and was a grandson of Princess Nest ferch Rhys, daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, the last independent Prince of South Wales.See. Orpen, Vol 1, pp 181‚Äì182. His father was William FitzGerald, Lord of Carew. Career On 1 May 1170 Raymond landed at Baginbun Head, a promontory fort which was easily defendable. He was sent by Strongbow to Ireland in 1170, and landed at Baginbun Head at the Hook Peninsula, near Waterford, where he was besieged in his entrenchments by the combined Irish and Ostmen, whom he repulsed. Although vastly outnumbered in this battle, (his cousin Gerald of Wales gives the numbers at 3000 Irish against Le Gros's forces of about 100 including 10 Knights) he won a resounding victory which he achieved by rounding up a nearby herd of cattle which his men had foraged and driving them headlong into the oncoming enemy ranks. The result was that about 1000 of the combined Galic and Hiberno-Norse force were either killed or captured. He was Strongbow's second in command and had the chief share both in the capture of Waterford and in the successful assault on Dublin. He was sent to Aquitaine to hand over Strongbow's conquests to Henry II of England, but was back in Dublin in July 1171, when he led one of the sallies from the town. Strongbow offended him later by refusing him the marriage of his sister Basilia, widow of Robert de Quincy. Raymond then retired to Wales and Hervey de Mountmaurice became constable in his place. At the outbreak of a general rebellion against the earl in 1174, Raymond returned with his uncle Meiler FitzHenry, after receiving a promise of marriage with Basilia. He brought about 450 men with him and relieved Strongbow who was under siege in Waterford. His marriage to Basilia finally took place in Wexford directly following this encounter. Reinstated as constable, he secured a series of successes including the capture of Limerick city in October 1175. Mountmaurice meanwhile obtained Raymond's recall on the ground that his power threatened the royal authority, but the constable was delayed by a fresh outbreak at Limerick, the earl's troops refusing to march without him. On the death of Strongbow, he acted as governor until the arrival of William FitzAldelm, to whom he handed over the royal fortresses. He was deprived of his estates near Dublin and Wexford, but the Geraldines secured the recall of FitzAldelm early in 1183, and regained their power and influence. In 1182 he relieved his half-uncle Robert Fitz- Stephen, who was besieged in Cork. In 1185, his first cousin Philip de Barry, son of William FitzOdo de Barry came to Ireland to assist in the recovery of some cantreds in the Kingdom of Desmond. Death and legacy 14th century tomb effigy of Raymond le Gros at Molana Abbey, now lost, as drawn by Daniel Grose (1766‚Äì1838) The time of his death is not certain. He was certainly alive when John of England came to Ireland in 1185. Gerald of Wales did not record his death in his Expugnatio Hibernica which was finished in 1189. His widow Basilia married Geoffrey FitzRobert at some time between 1198 and 1201. This time range has not been narrowed since then. See, for example, According to tradition he was buried in Molana Abbey. He is described by Giraldus Cambrensis as \\"very stout, and a little above the middle height; his hair was yellow and curly, and he had large, grey round eyes. His nose was rather prominent, his countenance high-coloured, cheerful, and pleasant; and, although he was somewhat corpulent, he was so lively and active that the incumbrance was not a blemish or inconvenience. Such was his care of his troops that he passed whole nights without sleep, going the rounds of the guards himself, and challenging the sentinels to keep them on the alert. . . He was prudent and temperate, not effeminate in either his food or his dress. He was a liberal, kind, and circumspect man; and although a daring soldier and consummate general, even in military affairs prudence was his highest quality.\\" Raymond is considered the soldier, whereas Strongbow was the statesman, of the conquest. Raymond is also remembered in song. The song contains a detailed hymn, and stylized him a hero:See, Martin, S. 300, note the 67th Dirrai vus de un Chevaler, Reymund le Gros l'o√Ø nomer.

Set in rural England, where King-Smith spent twenty years as a farmer, it features a lone pig on a sheep farm. It was adapted as the 1995 film Babe, which was a great international success. King-Smith won the 1984 Guardian Children's Fiction Award, a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers.

There have been dozens of English-language editions and translations in fifteen other languages, primarily in 1995 and later, sometimes with new illustrations.\\"Formats and Editions of The sheep-pig\\". WorldCat. Retrieved 4 August 2012. Plot The plot revolves around a young livestock pig, won at a fair by a local sheep farmer named Farmer Hogget. He has no use for pigs, so his wife intends to fatten up the \\"little porker\\" for Christmas dinner. In unfamiliar surroundings the little piglet is scared. However he meets Fly the sheepdog, who takes pity on him and comforts him. She asks what his name is, and he replies that his mother called all her children Babe. Fly and her puppies teach Babe the rules of the farm. Babe starts to learn how to herd sheep, first practising and failing with the ducks. However, he has the idea of herding the sheep by asking them politely rather than ordering them about like sheep-dogs do. Fly's puppies are soon sold and Fly is heartbroken, so Babe asks her if he could be her son. One day Farmer Hogget and Fly bring a sickly ewe named Maa back to the farm. When Babe meets Maa in the farm stable Maa helps Babe to realise that sheep are not as stupid as Fly has told him. Babe promises to visit Maa again when she is well. Some time later, when Babe visits Maa in the fields, he sees sheep rustlers stealing the sheep. Babe saves the sheep and herds them away from the rustlers' lorry. He also bites one of the rustlers in the leg and squeals so loudly that Mrs. Hogget telephones the police. When the patrol car comes up the lane, the rustlers drive away, with no sheep. Babe has saved the flock and Mrs. Hogget decides to reward him by sparing his life. Later on Farmer Hogget takes Babe with him up to the fields and, on a whim, asks the pig to round up the sheep. Just as Babe is asking the sheep politely Maa appears in the centre of the herd to tell the sheep about Babe. Hogget is astonished that the sheep are walking in perfect straight lines around their pen. From then on, Babe accompanies Farmer Hogget up to the fields every day. Hogget starts to think that since Babe is a worthy animal he could enter him into the sheepdog trials. He begins to train the pig in what he needs to do. One morning, when Babe heads up to the fields alone, he finds the sheep panicking because wild dogs and wolves are terrorising them. Babe runs back to the farm and alerts Fly. However, Babe discovers that Maa is critically injured and she dies before she can be helped. Hogget arrives on the scene, sees Babe with a dead sheep and believes that the pig may have killed her. He prepares to put Babe down by shooting him with his gun, in case he is a danger to the other animals. However Mrs. Hogget tells Farmer Hogget about the dogs who have attacked the sheep. Fly, unable to believe that Babe could do such a thing, goes to ask the sheep what really happened. She even forces herself to be polite to them, and so the sheep willingly tell her that Babe saved their lives. Babe is proven innocent and Farmer Hogget resumes his training, entering him into the county sheepdog trials. Before Babe goes for the trials, Fly manages to obtain a password from the sheep, so that Babe can speak to the sheep he'll be herding. On the day of the trials Babe and Fly go with Farmer Hogget to the grounds. Farmer Hogget appears with Fly but swaps her for Babe. He performs perfectly, without any commands from Farmer Hogget, and says the password to the sheep. At the end of his trial Babe and Farmer Hogget score full marks, and Farmer Hogget looks down at his sheep-pig and tells him, \\"That'll do, Pig.\\" The Sheep-Pig contains twelve short chapters, each one written in speech marks (\\" \\"): :1. \\"Guess my weight\\" :2. \\"There.

Life Macdonald was born on 15 February 1799 at Findo Gask in Perthshire, Scotland to Margaret Morison and Alexander Macdonald, a violinist. He was apprenticed as a stonemason with Thomas Gibson, who was then building the Murray Royal Asylum, outside Perth, and about this time he carved the arms of Robert Graeme on the front of Garvock House. Coming to Edinburgh with an introduction to the architect James Gillespie Graham,, who proved a helpful patron, he worked as an ornamental sculptor. On 26 February 1822 he entered the Trustees' Academy, Edinburgh, then on Picardy Place. In late 1822 he went to Rome to study, where he executed several busts, among others that of the John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl. In 1823, along with Gibson, Severn, and other artists, he founded the British Academy of Arts in Rome, of which he continued as a trustee until his death. After approximately four year he returned to Edinburgh, and there produced busts of Professor John Wilson and George Combe, the phrenologist. In 1829, he sent his bust of John Marshall, MP, to the Royal Academy, and he was a frequent contributor to the succeeding exhibitions. In the autumn of 1829, he exhibited in the Royal Institution, Edinburgh, his colossal group of ‚ÄòAjax bearing the dead body of Patroclus and combating ‚Äòan warrior‚Äô and other works; and he was second to his friend Charles Maclaren, editor of the ‚ÄòScotsman,‚Äò in his bloodless duel with Dr. James Browne, editor of the ‚ÄòCaledonian Mercury,‚Äô fought near Edinburgh in November 1829, which arose partly out of an article in the ‚ÄòMercury‚Äô (6 November) on Macdonald‚Äôs works and the ‚ÄòScotsman‚Äòs‚Äô criticisms upon them. In the same year he was elected a member of the Scottish Academy, where in 1832, he exhibited several busts, including those of J. Gibson Lochhart and the Earl Erroll; but be seldom contributed here, and resigned his membership in 1858. He appeared in the list of honorary members in 1867. At this time he is shown as living at 10 Cumberland Street in Edinburgh's Second New Town. In 1832 he returned to Rome, where he occupied a leading position as a sculptor, chiefly producing portrait busts, aided by his elder brother, John, and his son, Alexander. His bust of Philip Henry, fifth Earl Stanhope, is now at Chevening, Kent, and a copy is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. He also executed busts of Walter Scott (1831), Fanny Kemble, Sir David Baird. and James Gillespie Graham. Among his ideal works are ‚ÄòA Girl and a Carrier Pigeon,‚Äô 1835, and ‚ÄòEurydice,‚Äô 1849. His ‚ÄòUlysses recognised by his dog,‚Äô shown in the Paris Exhibition of 1855, was much admired, and became the property of Lord Kilmorey. He died in Rome. Several sculptors trained under him, including William Brodie.

He played collegiate baseball for Columbia Basin College. After two years there, he transferred to North Carolina State University as a shortstop. Orvella was drafted in 2003 in the thirteenth round of the MLB draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Early life Orvella grew up in Redmond, Washington playing many sports. He came from a sports family with his dad being a big golfer, and his mom a tennis player. As a kid and all the way up through high school, he played soccer, golf, basketball, and baseball. As a young boy, he played baseball and golf most, and he excelled in both. Orvella fell in love with baseball as a young boy. His father worked for a company with season tickets to the Seattle Mariners baseball games, and he was able to come along. As his father entertained clients in the luxurious box seats of the stadium, Chad sat in the cushioned chairs with his eyes fixed on the game. He went to fifteen or twenty games each year. Orvella began playing baseball at the age of four at the tee ball level for his little league. As he moved forward throughout his playing time, he constantly found himself on all the all-star teams. He was always one of the littlest guys on the team but didn't let that affect his play. He played his high school ball at Eastlake High School in Washington, and although wasn't recruited very heavily, he did get an offer he took from Columbia Basin College. College experience Orvella started his Junior College ball as a very small player, at about five foot eight, one hundred and fifty-five pounds. Being that he was so small he had to go the Junior College route. He had every intention as using it as a minor set back, and a stepping-stone to get into a bigger Division I baseball program. He received offers from almost every ACC program, and Texas. Ultimately, Orvella chose to take his talents to North Carolina State University in his junior year. He excelled at shortstop there and being that he had grown in size, he was showing bigger, stronger, and faster at the plate and in the field. In 2002, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. During his senior year, he pitched roughly ten to twelve innings, and the MLB scouts began to really take notice that he could pitch very well and play shortstop. When scouts approached him and asked him if he would enter the MLB draft as a pitcher, he said he would do anything to get to the next level. He was a hard throwing righty who repeatedly could pound the strike zone. All but one team wanted him to pitch at the next level. Minor League playing time Orvella was drafted in the thirteenth round of the 2003 MLB draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays as a shortstop. In late 2003, after his college ball was over, he reported to rookie ball in New York for the Hudson Valley Renegades. He brought along all his equipment to play shortstop, but upon his arrival was called into the office by the manager and told the team wasn't sure what they would do with him. He returned to the field after the meeting and was told to go throw a bullpen. In his first game, he came in for two innings of work and struck out five of six batters. The organization declared he would be a pitch for them. Orvella's pitching repertoire consists of a 95 mph fastball as well as a changeup and a slider.He threw fifteen innings that year before tearing his lateral meniscus in his right knee that put an end to the already short season. He returned in 2004, which would prove to be one of his best seasons. He started at low A level ball in Charleston, South Carolina. He made the all-star team at that level, and just after that game, he was promoted to High A ball. A month later he was promoted to AA ball in California and a month after that he was promoted to AAA ball in Durham, North Carolina. Following this extremely successful year he was awarded the 2004 minor league pitcher of the year. Major League playing time Orvella made his major league debut on May 31, , against the Oakland Athletics. After that time, he was sent back to AA where he would pitch thirty innings and allow only one run. He was called up to the MLB for the Devil Rays the day before Memorial Day and stayed with the MLB team for the rest of the year. He pitched so well that in 2006 he was the front-runner for the closer position. He pitched in AAA for two weeks before going back to the MLB team. That year he struggled to stay in the MLB and went up and down between AAA and MLB. He dominated AAA hitters, but his delivery to the plate was too slow for manager Joe Maddon, so when he tried to quicken it, he lost his accuracy and would get hit. This is what led to his up and down and led to not getting the role as closer. In 2007, he stayed in the Big Leagues for half a year as their left-handed specialist. Though he was a righty, there were no lefties in the bullpen and he was most effective against left-handed hitters. In 2008, he hurt his shoulder in spring training, which ended that season. He rehabbed and worked back to make an appearance in 2009. He spent his first half of the season with the Rays before he was released. He was picked up by The Kansas City Royals and finished the season with them. In 2010, he signed with the Angels but didn't last very long with them. After the surgery and rehab, he was never able to get his velocity back. Before hand he was throwing roughly ninety-five and after only about eighty-five on his fastball. This is ultimately what led to him getting released, and deciding to call it quits. His lone major league save came on June 12, 2005 in a Devil Rays extra inning victory over the Pirates. Orvella pitched the 13th inning, allowing 1 hit and 1 walk, but no runs to close out a Rays 7-5 victory. https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/PIT/PIT200506120.shtml Notables and life after baseball In his time pitching, he had three wins over Mariano Rivera and the Yankees. His very first pitch to Derek Jeter was a homerun. While in the Cape Cod leagues, there was a book written about him and his team called The Last Best League.

Prior to his election on the board, he ran third in an unsuccessful bid to unseat Sam Yorty for Mayor of Los Angeles in 1969. The nephew of Lewis Baxter Schwellenbach, Ward was born in Superior, Wisconsin, and grew up in Ephrata, Washington. Ward served as a Los Angeles County Supervisor from 1972‚Äì1980. As supervisor, Ward was an early advocate for passenger rail transportation in the county, something Los Angeles had lacked since the abandonment of the Pacific Electric Railway in the 1950s. Under Ward's aegis, L.A. County purchased eight rail cars from the El Camino in an attempt to bootstrap commuter rail in the greater Los Angeles area. Baxter Ward's initial effort failed, dubbed \\"Baxter's Choo-Choo\\" by its numerous contemporary critics, and although the purchased cars were used on Amtrak's San Diegan for six months in 1978, the criticism stuck, ultimately contributing to his 1980 election loss to Michael D. Antonovich. It is worth noting, however, that the original commuter rail route envisioned by Ward eventually did come to fruition in the form of Metrolink's Orange County Line, albeit some years after the end of his career as a Los Angeles County Supervisor. During the 1950s and early 60s he introduced a non-fiction documentary television show called Adventure Tomorrow with Dr. Martin L. Klein, which presented technology of the exciting years of the early Space Age. The program's producer, George Van Valkenburg described the series as covering anything that moves, flies or explodes. Ward also worked as a television news anchor first at KCOP-Channel 13, and then with KABC-Channel 7 in Los Angeles before he ran for Mayor. He ran for mayor of Los Angeles one last time in 1989 against Mayor Tom Bradley. Ward died in 2002, following a long battle with lung cancer. He was 82 years old.

The surrounding terrain of the village is mostly wooded. Pine Grove is very centralized to towns and communities that have necessary services for Pine Grove residents. Summary This hamlet is located in Norfolk County Ward 4 for municipal elections. Most students here attend either Walsh Public School (secular) or St. Michael's in Walsh (Roman Catholic) for their elementary and junior high school education. These students would eventually attend Delhi District Secondary School (secular), Simcoe Composite School (secular), Holy Trinity Catholic High School (Roman Catholic) or Valley Heights Secondary School (secular) for their high school education. Pine Grove contains a gas station, a car repair shop, and a ginseng farm. In addition to residential roads, Regional Road 1 (also known as McDowell Road) and Pine Grove Road (formerly known as Delhi Road) are the main automobile routes. The majority of Pine Grove residents read The Simcoe Reformer as their preferred newspaper, although the Brantford Expositor was delivered here until the mid-1990s. To the south of the community is a managed forest area; with plenty of wild grass, poison ivy and the threat of falling trees during times of high wind speeds. American robins can be commonly found along the residential streets in addition to New World orioles and various species of butterflies. Downy woodpeckers and American crows are also found in the managed forest area; first seen in that area in April 2019. In addition to a planned set of private driveways and local roads, County Road 1 (also known as McDowell Road) and Pinegrove Road (formerly known as Delhi Road) are the main automobile routes. The northern end of the community is an elite residential neighborhood with lavish mansions averaging around $600,000 while the southern end of the community is a typical working class residential community with single-family detached homes costing around $200,000.Property Details for 34 Lyndhurst Avenue, Pinegrove Ontario at Your Online Agents Neil Adcock's development company was responsible for developing the northern end from approximately 2006 to the present day; hydro was fully established sometime in 2012. Pine Grove is well-known for its quiet atmosphere; with a variety of car-friendly streets and reliable access to local restaurants within the towns of Simcoe, Delhi, Langton, Tillsonburg, and Brantford. The community is not known for having a vibrant nightlife and most residents here shop online using their wi- fi Internet. Groceries and cafe services have to be acquired by using private transportation or through expensive taxis. Pine Grove is not entirely pedestrian-friendly, as it is challenging to walk from one end of the community to the other for exercise.Depiction of Pine Grove, Norfolk County, Ontario at RE/MAX Cemetery A historic Baptist cemetery is located here. While it is no longer an active cemetery, the Pinegrove Baptist Cemetery hosts more than 60 locals who died in the early history of this community.Pinegrove Cemetery, Norfolk County, Ontario, Canada at YouTube Most of the people who are buried here were born in the 19th century and died prior to the Second World War; burials done in the 20th century are a rarity at this cemetery. Old-fashioned given names like Jennie, Bertha, Melvin, Rachel, Margaret, and Eleanor can be found in this cemetery. The most recent burial at this cemetery was Mrs. Leottia Neilson (n√©e Bint) who died in 1956; she was the wife of Mr. Thomas B. Neilson who died in 1922.Memorials in Pinegrove Baptist Cemetery at Find a Grave The oldest male person buried at the Pinegrove Baptist Cemetery was Mr. William Andrew Drew Birdsil (who died in 1854 in his 29th year) while the oldest female person buried at the Pinegrove Baptist Cemetery was Miss Eleanor Stewart (who died in 1865 in her 25th year). Climate The winter of 1975 was the only unusually mild winter in the region from 1897 to 1977. From the late 1990s onwards, winters became more mild due to changes in climate brought on by global warming. Pine Grove traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone, even with the recent mild winters and warmer dry summers. As in all communities, towns and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Pine Grove over the decades. The warmest summers that Pine Grover has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Should the sea levels rise by , Pine Grover is not located close enough to salt water to be affected directly by flooding. However, it would suffer indirectly from droughts due to the displacement of available freshwater resources and would have to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from hundreds of miles away. Many major cities near salt water already pipe in their water from freshwater sources hundreds of miles away like Los Angeles; which is located in the middle of a desert.

Seely () (born June 21, 1941) is an American academic and translator, and a scholar of Bengali language and literature. He has translated the works of Ramprasad Sen and Michael Madhusudan Dutt and written a biography of Bengali poet Jibanananda Das. He has also authored software packages related to Bengali. His latest book, Barisal and Beyond, was published in India in 2008. Life and work Clinton Seely studied at the Stanford University, where he majored in biology. Upon graduation in 1963, he joined the US Peace Corps, and travelled to the then-East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) as a Corps volunteer. There, for two years, he helped to teach biology at the Barisal Zilla School in the southern district of Barisal. He studied Bengali at a local missionary school. Seely's attachment to Bangladesh and its culture dates from this period. Upon his return to the US, he entered the University of Chicago's Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations. There he studied under the tutelage of Edward C. Dimock, Jr., a scholar of Bengali, and gained his master's degree in 1968. Around this time, Seely met the Bengali poet and journalist Jyotirmoy Datta at a writer's workshop in Iowa. Dutta encouraged him to take up poet Jibanananda Das as the subject of his doctoral research. Consequently, Seely returned to Bengal in 1969, this time arriving in Calcutta, the city where Das had studied for his university degrees, and where he had lived and worked intermittently later in his life, before finally settling in 1946. Seely's investigations took him far and wide, from the libraries of Calcutta to the very street where the poet was run over by a tram in 1954. He returned to Chicago in 1971, and commenced teaching Bengali. His Ph.D thesis, on the life and works of Jibanananda, was completed in 1976. The title of the doctoral dissertation was: Doe in Heat: A Critical Biography of the Bengali Poet Jibanananda Das (1899‚Äì1954). In the meantime, Seely had also completed his first work of translation ‚Äì Buddhadeva Bose's popular and controversial novel Raat Bhorey Brishti, which appeared under the English title Rain Through the Night in 1973. He turned his researcher's attention on to the 19th-century poet Michael Madhusudan Dutt. The translation of Dutt's epic poem Meghnad Bodh Kavya, a project that Seely began in the 1970s, would not be completed for another three decades. Seely retired from the University of Chicago in 2008.

The book was a seminal work for Goldmann. In it, he lays out his theory of the novel.  Explanation of the Text  = Goldmann's Thesis = ‚ÄúThe novel form seems to me, in effect, to be the transposition on the literary plane of everyday life in the individualistic society created by market production. There is a rigorous homology between the literary form of the novel...and the everyday relation between man and commodities in general, and by extension between men and other men, in a market society‚Äù (7). = Summary =  Influence of Luk√°cs and Girard  Goldmann gives us his newest hypothesis on the novel, detailed above in his thesis statement, but he does not explain this idea before giving us a thorough overview of the theory of the novel, as elucidated first by Luk√°cs and then by Ren√© Girard. According to Goldmann, the novel form as identified by both Luk√°cs and Girard follows a certain path: put in the most general terms, it chronicles the rupture between the hero and the world. In this respect, the novel differs from its close cousins, the tragedy and the folk tale. In tragedy, the rupture is entire; in the folk tale, the rupture is either nonexistent or accidental. The novelistic rupture occupies a middle ground between these two extremes. The hero experiences a rupture with his community because his is a quest for authentic values in a degraded world. Since the hero comes from this degraded world, however, he never fully breaks with the community‚Äîand is often reconciled with it at the end of the novel. Goldmann explains that there are three types of novels, which both Luk√°cs and Girard have identified: #Abstract realism: the hero has too narrow a vision to understand his complex world. #psychological novel: Concerned with the inner life of the hero. The hero is passive and far too ahead of his time to fit into the world. #Bildungsroman: This type of novel usually ends with a ‚Äúself- imposed limitation‚Äù as the hero gives up his search for authentic values. To clarify the differences between Girard and Luk√°cs, Goldmann offers a short summary and analysis of each theorist's insights into the form of the novel. Girard argues that the novel is the story of a degraded search in a degraded world. Moreover, an increase of ‚Äúontological sickness‚Äù leads to an increase in metaphysical desire in the novel. In other words, the hero, frustrated by his attempt to find concrete values in the world begins to turn toward the metaphysical, the otherworldly for satisfaction. The hero's quest, according to Girard, is distracted by mediators. These mediators put themselves between the hero and the authentic values for which he searches, thereby turning him away from these authentic values (a bit like Homer's sirens). There are two forms of mediation, external and internal. The external mediating agent is external to the world of the hero. Goldmann's example is the chivalric novels in Don Quixote that distract him from the search for authentic values. The internal mediator is an agent that belongs to the hero's world, such as another character in the novel. Degradation happens because the hero gets closer to the mediating agent, and thereby further away from authentic values and what Goldmann terms ‚Äúvertical transcendence.‚Äù While Girard and Luk√°cs agreed on many points, they also disagreed on certain key elements of the novel form. Goldmann asserts that this difference lies mainly in their analysis of the novel writer's position in relation to the world created in the novel. Luk√°cs terms this relationship irony, while Girard terms it humor. Both theorists agree that the novelist must supersede (take the place of) the consciousness of his heroes. They disagree, however, on the nature of this supersession. Girard argues that writing the work helps the writer rediscover authenticity. This is why most ‚Äúgreat‚Äù works end with the hero's similar conversion. Luk√°cs, on the other hand, has a more pessimistic view of the author's achievements. He argues that the writer cannot supersede so easily because the writer and his imagination are both products of a universally degraded world. Luk√°cs maintains that the writer's irony is also self- reflective, so that the novel actually emphasizes the degraded consciousness of the writer. The fate of the hero is equally unhappy for Luk√°cs: unlike Girard, who believes that the hero's conversion is the discovery of authentic values, Luk√°cs believes that the conversion of the hero is the discovery of the impossibility of authentic values. The Luk√°cs and Girard converge again, however, when they discuss the place of authentic values in the work. As Goldmann explains, the authentic values are not concretely present in the work; rather, they are only present abstractly in the mind of the writer. The writer cannot concretely place authentic values in the work because novels have no place for abstract ideas -- it would be like putting a square peg in a round hole. The problem becomes, then, taking the abstract/ethical part of the novel, which only exists in the writer's mind, and making it the essential element of a novel which cannot accommodate it. This means, of course, that the novel starts off degraded from the beginning because abstract authenticity cannot be represented in the novel). How is the hero to search for this authenticity? Sociology of the Novel Here Goldmann ends his discussion of the novel form and its perplexities, and moves on to discuss the perplexities of the sociology of the novel. The authenticity question will return after this short summary of the history of the novel in sociology. As Goldmann explains, the first part of novel writing, from its birth until approximately World War I, the novel was a social chronicle of the time period. If sociologists wanted to understand the time period in which the novel was written, they had only to look at the content of the novel, which provided information of customs, traditions, dress, mannerisms, technology, beliefs, etc. of the time. The belief was, and still is, that the novel reflects the time period in which it was written‚Äîit simply cannot help this. This assumption worked well until World War I. Many novels after this watershed moment simply did not support the belief that a novel's content can give clues about the society in which it was written. These new novels had absurd worlds and an abundance of reification (to treat something abstract as if it were a real thing), and were hardly reliable sources for understanding the society of the time. How to reconcile this new novel with the belief that novels mirror society?  The Structure of Modern Society  Sidenote: Another related problem that came up was why these novels only appeared after World War I. Marx was explaining reification in the late 19th century, after all, and his commentary related to events that happened even earlier. Why does reification only appear in novels in the 1910s? Goldmann, of course, provides an answer to this problem (he calls it a hypothesis). Rather than looking at the content of the novel, sociologists need to look at the form of the novel and its relation to the structure of individualistic modern society. Goldmann, in line with the novel-as-mirror-society ideology, says that he doubts the structure of the novel (degraded search for authentic values expressed through mediatization) was invented individually. More likely, it is a reflection of the social life of a group. This is where Goldmann introduces his thesis: ‚ÄúThe novel form seems to me, in effect, to be the transposition on the literary plane of everyday life in the individualistic society created by market production. There is a rigorous homology between the literary form of the novel...and the everyday relation between man and commodities in general, and by extension between men and other men, in a market society‚Äù (7). In other words, the novel form is representative of everyday life, specifically of life in an individualistic, market-driven society. Goldmann then launches into a neo-Marxist comparison between the pre-market and the market society. In the pre-capitalistic society, man judged commodities (clothing, tools, food) by its use value‚Äîthat is, its value to him as the person who was going to use it. Questions might include, ‚ÄúIs this a good shirt?,‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this wild boar edible?,‚Äù and so on. In a market society, however, the relationship between the man and the commodity is mediated by money. In this setup, man considers not the commodity's use value, but the mediator's exchange value. Questions might include ‚ÄúWhat can I get for this money?,‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow much am I worth in terms of money?‚Äù The authentic relationship between man and commodities disappears, and is replaced by these exchange values. ::Man ‚Üí Commodity ::Man ‚Üí Money ‚Üí Commodity Goldmann explains that use values have not disappeared entirely; rather, they are like authentic values in the fictional world: they are implied and abstract. Not all of society gears itself towards exchange values, however. Just as in the novel world a hero breaks with society because of his search for authentic values, so in the real world, some people stay oriented towards use values. These people do not fit in with the rest of society, and so they experience a rupture, much like the hero in the novel. Goldmann clarifies that individuals in society do aim at use values sporadically, but they fail. Considering the structure of the market-driven society in which we function, the novel form is not surprising (as it is representative of the social structure). The Novel and the Structure of Market Society Goldmann here restates and elaborates on his thesis: ‚ÄúThus the two structures, that of an important fictional genre and that of exchange proved to be strictly homologous, to the point at which one might speak of one and the same structure manifesting itself on two different planes. Furthermore, as we shall see later, the evolution of the fictional form that corresponds to the world of reification can be understood only in so far as it is related to a homologous history of the structure of reification‚Äù (8). In other words, we can only understand the evolution of the novel if we understand the structure of reification in the real world. Here Goldmann takes a short detour to answer a question that must now be plaguing every Marxist and non-Marxist reading the essay. Mainly, ‚ÄúHow was the novel form able to emerge from economic reality?‚Äù Both Marxists and non-Marxists have previously thought that the novel does not emerge directly out of social life, but out of a collective consciousness that is more abstract and more comprehensive than the particular moment in time in which the novel was written. This is how people thought novels developed: ::Social life ‚Üí Collective consciousness ‚Üí Literary form Goldmann noticed, however, that the collective consciousness did not seem to be the necessary intermediary in the new novel because the exchange structure seen in society and the novel form was not existent in the collective consciousness. Moreover, the novel form seems to be not the transposition of something in the collective consciousness, but a search for something missing and implicit in the collective consciousness. The result is a direct transposition of economic life into literary life (remember the values structures?). While some might consider this development bizarre, Goldmann has a ready answer to explain this development: Marx theorized that in market societies, the collective consciousness ultimately disappears as a separate identity because it becomes a direct reflection of economic life. So, how do we explain the economic structures->literary manifestations link outside of the collective consciousness? Goldmann blesses us with a four-point hypothesis. #Bourgeois society starts to think of money not as a mediator, but as an end point (an absolute value). #Some problematic characters remain in this society who do not fit in because they stay focused on the qualitative (use values). #The novel form is an expression of discontent and the desire for qualitative values in society as a whole, not just in individuals. #The emphasis on the individual in the capitalist market economy led to a development of the individual in novel form. Goldmann elaborates on this fourth assertion by reminding us that the novel form gives birth not just to an individual, but to a problematic individual. Here's how: :*The experience of the problematic individual in society (see #2 above). :*The contradiction of a bourgeois society that both values the individual and places extreme restrictions on him. The individual eventually disappears from real life and the novel when the economy changes from free competition to monopolies (this happens around 1900-1910). We thus have two novel periods for the new novel Goldmann is describing (this does not include the happy time when content and not form gave us insight into society). In the transitional period the writer attempts to replace biography with values. In the second, post-Kafka period, the writer gives up on replacing and attempts to write without a subject, thereby eliminating the search for values (we are still in this period says Goldmann in 1963). This disappearance of the subject can also be seen in the theater of absence exemplified by playwrights like Beckett and Adamov, as well as in non- representational art. The novel form is both critical and oppositional. It is critical of bourgeois society. It is an opposition to a time that could not fathom/did not have the vocabulary for conscious (read: Marxian) resistance to the status quo. Since the novel hero resists this state of affairs, the problematic hero actually is ‚Äúbound up certainly with history‚Äù‚Äîbut not consciously (13). Goldmann's argument that the novel reveals the unconscious values of the bourgeoisie, suggests the question, were there works that showed the conscious values and aspirations of the bourgeoisie? Goldmann suggests that one French novelist may have succeeded in a representation of conscious bourgeois values: Balzac. Individualism structured the consciousness of the bourgeoisie in its heyday, and Balzac is the one novelist who really shows the individualism value. In general, however, the conscious value system played a secondary role in the novels of the time. Goldmann offers no specific answers on this questions, but does offer us a 3-part hypothesis: #Valid artistic creation only happens when there is a search for transcendent, trans- individual values. Man is only authentic if he conceives himself part of a community. #The bourgeois society is the first ideology in history to deny transcendence; rationalism was its creed. This bourgeois ideology even ignores art in its extreme manifestations. #There was a second, ‚Äúinauthentic‚Äù novel form that draws on the collective consciousness. Goldmann suggests that Eug√®ne Sue or Alexandre Dumas, p√®re are examples of this form.  References  *Goldmann, Lucien. Towards a Sociology of the Novel. 1964. Trans. Alan Sheridan.

The term \\"ice machine\\" usually refers to the stand-alone appliance. The ice generator is the part of the ice machine that actually produces the ice. This would include the evaporator and any associated drives/controls/subframe that are directly involved with making and ejecting the ice into storage. When most people refer to an ice generator, they mean this ice-making subsystem alone, minus refrigeration. An ice machine, however, particularly if described as 'packaged', would typically be a complete machine including refrigeration, controls, and dispenser, requiring only connection to power and water supplies. The term icemaker is more ambiguous, with some manufacturers describing their packaged ice machine as an icemaker, while others describe their generators in this way. History In 1748, the first known artificial refrigeration was demonstrated by William Cullen at the University of Glasgow. Mr. Cullen never used his discovery for any practical purposes. This may be the reason why the history of the icemakers begins with Oliver Evans, an American inventor who designed the first refrigeration machine in 1805. In 1834, Jacob Perkins built the first practical refrigerating machine using ether in a vapor compression cycle. The American inventor, mechanical engineer and physicist received 21 American and 19 English patents (for innovations in steam engines, the printing industry and gun manufacturing among others) and is considered today the father of the refrigerator. In 1844, an American physician, John Gorrie, built a refrigerator based on Oliver Evans' design to make ice to cool the air for his yellow fever patients. His plans date back to 1842, making him one of the founding fathers of the refrigerator. Unfortunately for John Gorrie, his plans of manufacturing and selling his invention were met with fierce opposition by Frederic Tudor, the Boston ‚ÄúIce King‚Äù. By then, Tudor was shipping ice from the United States to Cuba and was planning to expand his business to India. Fearing that Gorrie‚Äôs invention would ruin his business, he began a smearing campaign against the inventor. In 1851, John Gorrie was awarded U.S. Patent 8080 for an ice machine. After struggling with Tudor's campaign and the death of his partner, John Gorrie also died, bankrupt and humiliated. His original icemaker plans and the prototype machine are held today at the National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. In 1853, Alexander Twining was awarded U.S. Patent 10221 for an icemaker. Twining‚Äôs experiments led to the development of the first commercial refrigeration system, built in 1856. He also established the first artificial method of producing ice. Just like Perkins before him, James Harrison started experimenting with ether vapor compression. In 1854, James Harrison successfully built a refrigeration machine capable of producing 3,000 kilograms of ice per day and in 1855 he received an icemaker patent in Australia, similar to that of Alexander Twining. Harrison continued his experiments with refrigeration. Today he is credited for his major contributions to the development of modern cooling system designs and functionality strategies. These systems were later used to ship refrigerated meat across the globe. Icemaker Patent by Andrew Muhl, dated December 12, 1871 In 1867, Andrew Muhl built an ice-making machine in San Antonio, Texas, to help service the expanding beef industry before moving it to Waco in 1871. In 1873, the patent for this machine was contracted by the Columbus Iron Works, which produced the world's first commercial icemakers. William Riley Brown served as its president and George Jasper Golden served as its superintendent. In 1876, German engineer Carl von Linde patented the process of liquefying gas that would later become an important part of basic refrigeration technology (U.S. Patent 1027862). In 1879 and 1891, two African American inventors patented improved refrigerator designs in the United States (Thomas Elkins ‚Äì U.S. patent #221222 and respectively John Standard ‚Äì U.S. patent #455891). In 1902, the Teague family of Montgomery purchased control of the firm. Their last advertisement in Ice and Refrigeration appeared in March 1904.Columbus Iron Works, 1853, Historic American Engineering Record, Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service, Department of the Interior In 1925, controlling interest in the Columbus Iron Works passed from the Teague family to W.C. Bradely of W.C. Bradley, Co. Professor Jurgen Hans is credited with the invention of the first ice machine to produce edible ice in 1929. In 1932 he founded a company called Kulinda and started manufacturing edible ice, but by 1949 the business switched its central product from ice to central air conditioning. The ice machines from the late 1800s to the 1930s used toxic gases such as ammonia (NH3), methyl chloride (CH3Cl), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as refrigerants. During the 1920s, several fatal accidents were registered. They were caused by the refrigerators leaking methyl chloride. In the quest of replacing dangerous refrigerants ‚Äì especially methyl chloride ‚Äì collaborative research ensued in American corporations. The result of this research was the discovery of Freon. In 1930, General Motors and DuPont formed Kinetic Chemicals to produce Freon, which would later become the standard for almost all consumer and industrial refrigerators. The Freon produced back then was chlorofluorocarbon, a moderately toxic gas causing ozone depletion. Principle of ice making All refrigeration equipment is made of four key components; the evaporator, the condenser, the compressor and the throttle valve. Ice machines all work the same way. The function of the compressor is to compress low-pressure refrigerant vapour to high-pressure vapour, and deliver it to the condenser. Here, the high-pressure vapour is condensed into high-pressure liquid, and drained out through the throttle valve to become low-pressure liquid. At this point, the liquid is conducted to the evaporator, where heat exchanging occurs, and ice is created. This is one complete refrigeration cycle. Consumer icemakers = Freezer icemakers = Icemaker (for hotel customers) Automatic icemakers for the home were first offered by the Servel company around 1953. They are usually found inside the freezer compartment of a refrigerator. They produce crescent-shaped ice cubes from a metal mold. An electromechanical or electronic timer first opens a solenoid valve for a few seconds, allowing the mold to fill with water from the domestic cold water supply. The timer then closes the valve and lets the ice freeze for about 30 minutes. Then, the timer turns on a low-power electric heating element inside the mold for several seconds, to melt the ice cubes slightly so they will not stick to the mold. Finally, the timer runs a rotating arm that scoops the ice cubes out of the mold and into a bin, and the cycle repeats. If the bin fills with ice, the ice pushes up a wire arm, which shuts off the icemaker until the ice level in the bin goes down again. The user can also lift up the wire arm at any time to stop the production of ice. Later automatic icemakers in Samsung refrigerators use a flexible plastic mold. When the ice cubes are frozen, which is sensed by a Thermistor, the timer causes a motor to invert the mold and twist it so that the cubes detach and fall into a bin. Early icemakers dropped the ice into a bin in the freezer compartment; the user had to open the freezer door to obtain ice. In 1965, Frigidaire introduced icemakers that dispensed from the front of the freezer door. In these models, pressing a glass against a cradle on the outside of the door runs a motor, which turns an auger in the bin and delivers ice cubes to the glass. Most dispensers can optionally route the ice through a crushing mechanism to deliver crushed ice. Some dispensers can also dispense chilled water. = Portable icemakers = Portable icemaker (for home use) Portable icemakers are units that can fit on a countertop. They are the fastest and smallest icemakers on the market. The ice produced by a portable icemaker is bullet-shaped and has a cloudy, opaque appearance. The first batch of ice can be made within 10 minutes of turning the appliance on and adding water. The water is pumped into a small tube with metal pegs immersed in the water. Because the unit is portable, water must be filled manually. The water is pumped from the bottom of the reservoir to the freeze tray. The pegs use a heating and cooling system inside to freeze the water around them and then heat up so the ice slips off the peg and into the storage bin. Ice begins to form in a matter of minutes, however, the size of ice cubes depends on the freezing cycle - a longer cycle results in thicker cubes. Portable icemakers will not keep the ice from melting, but the appliance will recycle the water to make more ice. Once the storage tray is full, the system will turn off automatically. = Built-in and freestanding icemakers = Built-in icemakers are engineered to fit under a kitchen or bar counter, but they can be used as freestanding units. Some produce crescent-shaped ice like the ice from a freezer icemaker; the ice is cloudy and opaque instead of clear, because the water is frozen faster than in others which are clear cube icemakers. In the process, tiny air bubbles get trapped, causing the cloudy appearance of the ice. However, most under-counter ice makers are clear ice makers in which the ice is missing the air bubbles, and therefore the ice is clear and melts much slower.  Industrial icemakers  Commercial ice makers improve the quality of ice by using moving water. The water is run down a high nickel content stainless steel evaporator. The surface must be below freezing. Salt water requires lower temperatures to freeze and will last longer. Generally used to package seafood products. Air and undissolved solids will be washed away to such an extent that in horizontal evaporator machines the water has 98% of the solids removed, resulting in very hard, virtually pure, clear ice. In vertical evaporators the ice is softer, more so if there are actual individual cube cells. Commercial ice machines can make different sizes of ice like flakers, crushed, cube, octagon, and tube. When the sheet of ice on the cold surface reaches the desired thickness, the sheet is slid down onto a grid of wires, where the sheet's weight causes it to be broken into the desired shapes, after which it falls into a storage bin. =Flake ice machine= Flake ice is made of the mixture of brine and water (max salt per ton of water), in some cases can be directly made from brine water. Thickness between , irregular shape with diameters from . The evaporator of the flake ice machine is a vertically placed drum-shape stainless steel container, equipped with the rotating blade which spins and scratches the ice off the inner wall of the drum. When operating, the principal shaft and blade spins anti-clockwise pushed by the reducer. Water is sprayed down from the sprinkler; ice is formed from the water brine on the inner wall. The water tray at the bottom catches the cold water while deflecting Ice and re-circulates it back into the sump. The sump will typically use a float valve to fill as needed during production. Flake machines have a tendency to form an ice ring inside the bottom of the drum. Electric heaters are in wells at the very bottom to prevent this accumulation of ice where the crusher does not reach. Some machines use scrapers to assist this. This system utilizes a low temperature condensing unit; like all ice machines. Most manufactures also utilize an E.P.R.V. (Evaporator pressure regulating valve.) Applications Sea water flake ice machine can make ice directly from the sea water. This ice can be used in fast cooling of fish and other sea products. The fishing industry is the largest user of flake ice machines. Flake ice can lower the temperature of cleaning water and sea products, therefore it resists the growth of bacteria and keeps the seafood fresh. Because of its large contact and less damage with refrigerated materials, it is also applied in vegetable, fruit and meat storing and transporting. In baking, during the mixing of flour and milk, flake ice can be added to prevent the flour from self-raising. In most cases of biosynthesis and chemosynthesis, flake ice is used to control the reaction rate and maintain the liveness. Flake ice is sanitary, clean with rapid temperature reduction effect. Flake ice is used as the direct source of water in concrete cooling process, more than 80% in weight. Concrete will not crack if has been mixed and poured in constant and low temperature. Flake ice is also used for artificial snowing, so it is widely applied in ski resorts and entertainment park. =Cube icemaker= Cube ice machines are classified as small ice machines, in contrast to tube ice machines, flake ice machines, or other ice machines. Common capacities range from to . Since the emergence of cube ice machines in the 1970s, they have evolved into a diverse family of ice machines. Cube ice machines are commonly seen as vertical modular devices. The upper part is an evaporator, and the lower part is an ice bin. The refrigerant circulates inside pipes of self-contained evaporator, where it conducts the heat exchange with water, and freezes the water into ice cubes. When the water is thoroughly frozen into ice, it is automatically released, and falls into the ice bin. Ice machines can have either a self-contained refrigeration system where the compressor is built into the unit, or a remote refrigeration system where the refrigeration components are located elsewhere, often the roof of the business. Compressor Most compressors are either positive displacement compressors or radial compressors. Positive displacement compressors are currently the most efficient type of compressor, and have the largest refrigerating effect per single unit (). They have a large range of possible power supplies, and can be , , or even higher. The principle behind positive displacement compressors utilizes a turbine to compress refrigerant into high-pressure vapor. Positive displacement compressors are of four main types: screw compressor, rolling piston compressor, reciprocating compressor, and rotary compressor. Screw compressors can yield the largest refrigerating effect among positive displacement compressors, with their refrigerating capacity normally ranging from to . Screw compressors also can be divided to single-screw type and dual-screw type. Dual-screw type is more often seen in use because it is very efficient. Rolling piston compressors and reciprocating compressors have similar refrigerating effects, and maximum refrigerating effect can reach . Reciprocating compressors are the most common type of compressor because the technology is mature and reliable. Their refrigerating effect ranges from to . They compress gas by utilizing a piston pushed by a crank shaft. Rotary compressors, mainly used in air conditioning equipment, have a very low refrigerating effect, normally not exceeding . They work by compressing gas using a piston pushed by a rotor, which spins in an isolated compartment. Condenser All condensers can be classified as one of three types: air cooling, water cooling, or evaporative cooling. * An air cooling condenser uses air as the heat conducting media by blowing air through the surface of condensers, which carries heat away from the high-pressure, high-temperature refrigerant vapor. * A water cooling condenser uses water as the heat conducting media to cooling refrigerant vapor to liquid. * An evaporative condenser cools the refrigerant vapor by using heat exchange between the evaporator pipes and the evaporated water which is sprayed on the surface of the pipes. This type of condenser is capable of working in warm environments; they are also very efficient and reliable. =Tube ice generator= Tube ice A tube ice generator is an ice generator in which the water is frozen in tubes that are extended vertically within a surrounding casing‚Äîthe freezing chamber. At the bottom of the freezing chamber there is a distributor plate having apertures surrounding the tubes and attached to the separate chamber into which a warm gas is passed to heat the tubes and cause the ice rods to slide down. Tube ice can be used in cooling processes, such as temperature controlling, fresh fish freezing, and beverage bottle freezing. It can be consumed alone or with food or beverages.  Global Applications and Impact of Refrigeration  As of 2019 there were approximately 2 billion household refrigerators and over 40 million square meters of cold-storage facilities operating worldwide. In the US in 2018 almost 12 million refrigerators were sold. This data supports the assertion that refrigeration has global applications with positive impact upon the economy, technology, social dynamics, health, and the environment. = Global Economic Applications = The refrigeration industry employs more than 2 million people worldwide, especially in the service sectors. Refrigeration is necessary for the implementation of many current or future energy sources (hydrogen liquefying for alternative fuels in the automotive industry and thermonuclear fusion production for the alternative energy industries). * The petro-chemical and pharmaceutical industries also need refrigeration, as it is used to control and moderate many types of reactions. * Heat pumps, operating based on refrigeration processes, are frequently used as an energy-efficient way of producing heat. * The production and transport of cryogenic fuels (liquid hydrogen and oxygen) as well as the long-term storage of these fluids is necessary for the space industry. * In the transportation industry, refrigeration is used in marine containers, reefer ships, refrigerated rail cars, road transport, liquefied gas tankers etc. = Global Health Applications = In the food industry, refrigeration contributes to reducing post-harvest losses while supplying safe, foods to consumers by enabling perishable foods to be preserved at all stages from production to consumption by the end-user. In the medical sector, refrigeration is used for vaccine, organs, stem cells‚Äô and others‚Äô storage, while cryotechnology is used in surgery and other medical research courses of action. = Global Environmental Applications = Refrigeration is used in biodiversity maintenance based on the cryopreservation of genetic resources (cells, tissues, and organs of plants, animals and micro-organisms); Refrigeration enables the liquefaction of CO2 for underground storage, allowing the potential separation of CO2 from fossil fuels in power stations via cryogenic technology.  The Environmental Dimension of Refrigeration  At an environmental level, the impact of refrigeration is due to: atmospheric emissions of refrigerant gases used in refrigerating installations and the energy consumption of these refrigerating installations which contribute to CO2 emissions ‚Äì and consequently to global warming ‚Äì thus reducing global energy resources. The atmospheric emissions of refrigerant gases are based on the leaks occurring in insufficiently leak- tight refrigerating installations or during maintenance-related refrigerant- handling processes. Depending on the refrigerants used, these installations and their subsequent leaks can lead to: ozone depletion (chlorinated refrigerants like CFCs and HCFCs) and/or global warming, by exerting an additional greenhouse effect (fluorinated refrigerants: CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs). From a consumption point of view, it is necessary to remember that households are responsible for about 26.2% of the global energy consumption. While the Montreal Protocol banned the use of CFCs followed by HCFCs, the global efforts aimed at reducing the environmental impact of refrigeration have taken three courses of action: # Reduction in direct emissions of fluorocarbons in the atmosphere based on better containment of refrigerants, # Refrigerant charge reduction and development of alternative refrigerants with negligible or no climate impact; # Reduction in energy consumption due to the increasing energy efficiency of refrigerating plants. = Alternative Refrigerants = In their continuous research of methods to replace ozone-depleting refrigerants and greenhouse refrigerants (CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs, respectively) the scientific community together with the refrigerant industry came up with alternative all- natural refrigerants which are eco-friendly. According to a report issued by the UN Environment Programme, ‚Äúthe increase in HFC emissions is projected to offset much of the climate benefit achieved by the earlier reduction in the emissions of Ozone depleting substances‚Äù. Among non-HFC refrigerants found to successfully replace the traditional ones are ammonia, hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide.  Ammonia  The history of refrigeration began with the use of ammonia. After more than 120 years, this substance is still the preeminent refrigerant used by household, commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. The major problem with ammonia is its toxicity at relatively low concentrations. On the other hand, ammonia has zero impact on the ozone layer and very low global warming effects. While deaths caused by ammonia exposure are extremely rare, the scientific community has come up with safer and technologically solid mechanisms of preventing ammonia leakage in modern refrigerating equipment. This problem out of the way, ammonia is considered an eco-friendly refrigerant with numerous applications.  Carbon Dioxide (CO2)  Carbon dioxide has been used as a refrigerant for many years. Just like ammonia, it has fallen in almost complete disuse due to its low critical point and its high operating pressure. Carbon dioxide has zero impact on the ozone layer and the global warming effects of the quantities required for use as a refrigerant are also negligible. Modern technology is solving such issues and CO2 is widely used today as an alternative to traditional refrigeration in several fields: industrial refrigeration (CO2 is usually combined with ammonia, either in cascade systems or as a volatile brine), the food industry (food and retail refrigeration), heating (heat pumps) and the transportation industry (transport refrigeration).  Hydrocarbons  Hydrocarbons are natural products with high thermodynamic properties, zero ozone-layer impact and negligible global warming effects. One issue with hydrocarbons is that they are highly flammable, restricting their use to specific applications in the refrigeration industry. In 2011, the EPA has approved three alternative refrigerants to replace hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in commercial and household freezers via the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program. The three alternative refrigerants legalized by the EPA were hydrocarbons propane, isobutane and a substance called HCR188C ‚Äì a hydrocarbon blend (ethane, propane, isobutane and n-butane). HCR188C is used today in commercial refrigeration applications (supermarket refrigerators, stand-alone refrigerators and refrigerating display cases), in refrigerated transportation, automotive air-conditioning systems and retrofit safety valve (for automotive applications) and residential window air-conditioners. = The Future of Refrigeration = In October 2016, negotiators from 197 countries have reached an agreement to reduce emissions of chemical refrigerants that contribute to global warming, re-emphasizing the historical importance of the Montreal Protocol and aiming to increase its impact upon the use greenhouse gases besides the efforts made to reduce ozone depletion caused by the chlorofluorocarbons. The agreement, closed at a United Nations meeting in Kigali, Rwanda set the terms for a rapid phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) which would be stopped from manufacturing altogether and have their uses reduced over time. The UN agenda and the Rwanda deal aims to find a new generation of refrigerants to be safe from both an ozone layer and greenhouse effect point of view. The legally binding agreement could reduce projected emissions by as much as 88% and lower global warming with almost 0.5 degrees Celsius (nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit) by 2100.

Located approximately northwest of central London and adjacent to the Greater London boundary, it is an urbanised parish with suburban residential development, some open land and light industry. Elstree and Borehamwood is a recent renaming of the ancient parish of Elstree, covering the settlements of Elstree and Borehamwood. Formed in 1894 as the Elstree Parish Council, the local council is Elstree and Borehamwood Town Council. One of the most populous civil parishes in England, at the 2011 census it had a population of 37,065. History Elstree was an ancient parish in the Cashio Hundred of Hertfordshire. In 1894 it became part of the Barnet Rural District and the Elstree Parish Council was formed. Barnet Rural District became Elstree Rural District in 1941. The parish was part of the review area of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London, however it did not form part of the proposed Greater London area.Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London: 1957‚Äì1960: Report, 1960, HMSO In 1974 the parish became part of the Borough of Hertsmere. The Local Government Act 1972 permitted parish councils to become town councils and provided a mechanism for the name of the parish to be changed if the district council was in agreement. The parish name was subsequently changed to Elstree and Borehamwood and the parish council became Elstree and Borehamwood Town Council. The boundaries of Elstree and Borehamwood were adjusted on 1 April 1993 when part of the village of Elstree was transferred from Greater London and the boroughs of Barnet and Harrow, to Hertfordshire. Government The local council is Elstree and Borehamwood Town Council. The council offices are located at Fairway Hall, Brook Close. The parish has thirteen councillors. It is divided into the five wards of Brookmeadow (electing 3 councillors), Cowley Hill (3 councillors), Elstree (2 councillors), Hillside (3 councillors) and Kenilworth (2 councillors). Geography The civil parish is . It is located approximately northwest of central London and is adjacent to the Greater London boundary in the south and east. It is predominantly residential development with some light industry and open land in the Metropolitan Green Belt. The parish includes the settlements of Elstree and Borehamwood, which are divided from each other by the Midland Main Line. For postal addresses, the parish is almost entirely within the Borehamwood post town and the WD6 postcode district. The Elstree telephone exchange building is within of Oxford Circus and subscriber numbers therefore use the 020 code. Transport Elstree & Borehamwood railway station is located between the two main settlements on the Thameslink route from Bedford to Brighton via Central London. Although outside Greater London, the railway station is in London fare zone 6 for Travelcard and Oyster card fares, and the area is served by London Buses routes 107 and 292, providing connections to Arkley, Chipping Barnet, Colindale, Edgware and New Barnet.

NES Open Tournament Golf is the second Nintendo published golf-based video game released for the NES, the first game being Golf. In addition to the Famicom version of Golf, there were two other Nintendo published golf-based video games released in Japan. These games were released in disk format on the Family Computer Disk System in 1987. These two games were Family Computer Golf: Japan Course and Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course. Like most Mario games released around the time, the first player played as Mario, and the second player played as Luigi. At certain points during gameplay, the Mario Bros. are offered advice by their caddies, Princess Toadstool (Peach) and Princess Daisy. Another non-playable character was Mario's old nemesis Donkey Kong, who now works as an accountant securing the prize money for Mario and Luigi. NES Open Tournament Golf is often thought to be nearly identical to the Famicom version Mario Open Golf based on the fact that they both feature identical graphics and gameplay. However, there are many differences between the two games. For starters, Mario Open Golf featured five playable courses whereas NES Open Tournament Golf only featured three. The background music between both games also differed, with the exception of a few tracks that were used in both games. The Famicom version, Mario Open Golf is significantly more difficult than the NES version. Most of the holes seen in Mario Open Golf are not found in NES Open Tournament Golf, though there are a few holes that exist in both versions without any modifications. If someone plays Mario Open Golf they will notice a handful of holes that look nearly identical to the holes in NES Open Tournament Golf, but with more obstacles. It is likely that some of these obstacles were removed from the western release of the game to make it less difficult. Gameplay NES Open Tournament Golf featured three different courses. Those courses were the US Course, Japan Course, and the UK Course. Although the Japan Course and UK Course are also playable courses in Mario Open Golf they do not contain the same holes. There are some holes in each course that are identical or nearly identical to holes found in NES Open Tournament Golf. For example, hole number one in the Australia Course is hole number nine in the US Course. Mario Open Golf featured five different courses. Those courses were the Japan Course, the Australia Course, the France Course, the Hawaii Course, and the UK Course. In addition to those five courses an Extra Course is also available. The Extra Course contains a mix of holes from the other five courses. Release Golf (Japan Course) This game was released for the Disk System on February 21, 1987. Family Computer Golf: Japan Course is very similar to the original Golf which was released for the Famicom in 1984. In this version of the game you can consistently see the bird's eye view of the course on the right-side of the screen, while the left side of the screen consistently showed a third-person view. Two modes of play are available in the game, stroke play and match play. Though the course designs are similar to those found in NES Open Tournament Golf, the controls are slightly different. You can choose between three different speeds at which you hit the ball, and you can also cycle between golf clubs. In this version however, the default club will always be a 1W, whereas in later games an appropriate club would be pre-selected for you. The scorecard in this game is nearly identical to the one found in NES Open Tournament Golf. This game came on a blue disk card, when most disks at the time were yellow. The blue disk indicated that it could be used in machines called a Disk Fax as part of a contest in Japan. Players' high scores were saved on the disk, and by using the name entry feature in the game to enter their personal data, players could send the data to Nintendo using the Disk Fax. The winners of the contest received a golden disk containing a more difficult version of the game. This game was released for the Disk System on June 14, 1987. Family Computer Golf: U. S. Course is similar to the original Golf and Mario Open Golf. In this version of the game a bird's eye view of the course is shown on the center of the screen, while the right side of the screen shows a third-person view. Once you were ready to hit the ball the bird's eye view transitioned to a screen with just the third-person view. This concept was slightly modified and used in Mario Open Golf which was released in September 1991. Mario Open Golf was one of the first titles released on Nintendo's arcade machine, the PlayChoice-10. Each machine had a mix of ten different NES games to choose from. For each token, players would be given a fixed amount of time to play any of the ten games on the PlayChoice-10. The dual-screen cabinet gave instructions on the top-screen, while the lower screen was used to show the actual game. The typical amount of time per token was 300 seconds, of which the player could switch in and out of different games if they so desired. The arcade machine's main circuit board had the ability to plug-in 10 different games, similar to the circuit board of an NES cartridge. PlayChoice games varied slightly from their original NES counterparts, as additional circuitry was needed to allow the game to run on the arcade machine. Mario Open Golf for the PlayChoice-10 was most similar to that of NES Open Tournament Golf, more so than Mario Open Golf for the Famicom. There were some differences from NES Open Tournament Golf, however, such as no tournament mode in Mario Open Golf. The PlayChoice-10 also featured the original Golf video game for the NES as one of the games in its library. It was also released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on July 5, 2012, and the Nintendo Switch Online service on October 10, 2018. Other media Mario Open Golf is one of the video games featuring in the manga titled Cyber Boy, by Nagai Noriaki, Published by Coro Coro Comic and Shogakukan, from 1991 to 1993. Mario's outfit from this game is an alternate costume for the character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, as well as in Super Mario Odyssey and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Platform 4 Rotherham Masborough Station in 1986. Rotherham Masborough railway station was the main railway station for Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England from the 1840s until 1987, when most trains were rerouted via Rotherham Central. It had four platforms, with a large sandstone station building on the eastern Platform Four, large iron and glass platform canopies, a fully enclosed footbridge and wooden waiting rooms on the other platforms. It closed in 1988, except for a few football specials. The station, designed by Francis Thompson, was opened by the North Midland Railway between Derby and Leeds, and named simply 'Masbrough', without the 'o', since Rotherham had not yet grown to surround the village. The station was renamed 'Masbrough & Rotherham' in 1896, 'Rotherham Masborough' in 1908 (misspelt by the railway company: the name of the district has always been 'Masbrough'), then simply 'Rotherham' in 1969. The line was the first main link between Yorkshire and London, via Birmingham or Rugby. In time, it became part of the main line to London St Pancras and the South West. Initially, it omitted Sheffield, the region's main settlement, by following a route along the Rother Valley, thus avoiding the difficult terrain on the prospective route south of Sheffield. At Masborough the line passed over the Sheffield & Rotherham Railway's Sheffield Wicker to Rotherham Westgate Station line and a large triangle junction was built allowing trains from the north and North Midland trains to travel into Sheffield from the north-east along the Don Valley. Immediately to the north of this junction stood Rotherham Masborough station. In the 1870, Sheffield was finally linked with Chesterfield, allowing Midland Main Line trains to call at the newly opened Sheffield railway station on their way north, passing back on to North Midland metals via the Sheffield & Rotherham. As late as the 1940s some long distance passenger trains still used the original Chesterfield - Rotherham old road, avoiding Sheffield and calling at Rotherham. Other ex- London expresses would slip a coach at Rotherham until this practice was discontinued nationally from the 1930s onwards. The corresponding up working would involve the coaches being worked to Sheffield by a local train and attached to a London express there. Up until the 1980s the odd London-Leeds express train would call at Masborough. During the 1960s rationalisation of railways, Rotherham Masborough became Rotherham's only station and eventually lost its 'Masborough' suffix. Short-sighted track and signalling rationalisation in the late 1970s meant that platforms 3 and 4 could not be used by Sheffield-bound trains without reversing, which made them effectively useless and removed much operational flexibility on the line as express trains could no longer easily pass/overtake local trains at Rotherham. By the 1980s railways in South Yorkshire were in a sorry state having lost most of their passengers. Rotherham in particular suffered from its remaining station being, at the time, just under half-a-mile from the town centre. As a result, a link was built from the former Sheffield & Rotherham Line nearby at Holmes, to the Great Central Railway line, allowing local trains to use a re-opened Rotherham Central station, at the same time reintroducing the flexibility for expresses to pass local trains that had been removed a few years earlier. Rotherham Masborough regained its suffix in the timetables (though not on the station signboards) and soldiered on for a few years with Sheffield-York trains stopping until eventual closure on 3 October 1988. Most of the station buildings, awnings and footbridge were demolished in the early 1990s but the platforms still remain, and the line through the station is still used by express and freight services. The main station building on the east side has been converted into an Indian restaurant.

The DIVARTY has operational service in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. History The unit was first constituted Nov. 19, 1917 as Headquarters Battery, 4th Field Artillery Brigade, and assigned to the 4th Infantry Division. The unit was organized for combat operations at Camp Greene, North Carolina from Dec. 15, 1917 to January 10, 1918. In the winter of 1918, the 4th Field Artillery Brigade departed for World War I in Europe. Upon returning stateside, the 4th Field Artillery Brigade was stationed at Camp Lewis, Washington, where it was inactivated Sept. 21, 1921. 4th Field Artillery Brigade was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 4th Field Artillery Brigade at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, Jan. 1, 1935, and then disbanded Nov. 14, 1939. Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 4th Field Artillery was reconstituted Sept. 10, 1940 as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 4th Division Artillery (DIVARTY). Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 4th Division Artillery was activated Oct. 1, 1940 at Fort Benning, Georgia. The unit participated in multiple campaigns of World War II. The 4th Division Artillery was inactivated March 5, 1946, at Camp Butler, North Carolina. On July 6, 1948, at Fort Ord, California, Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 4th Division Artillery, was again activated. April 1, 1957 at Fort Lewis, Washington, Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 4th Division Artillery was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 4th Infantry DIVARTY. By December 1970, the unit returned from South Vietnam to Fort Carson, Colorado. During that same year, the unit redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 4th Infantry Division Artillery (Mechanized). This redesignation named the Division Artillery the \\"Iron Gunners,\\" which complemented the \\"Ironhorse\\" Division. With the realignment and downsizing of the Army force, the unit was reassigned to Fort Hood, Texas on Dec. 15, 1995. On Dec. 16, 2004, the transformation and restructuring of the 4th Infantry Division Artillery marked the Army's first modular fires brigade. The brigade inactivated April 16, 2007, at Fort Hood, Texas because of the realignment of Army units. On May 6, 2015, the unit was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 4th Infantry Division Artillery at Fort Carson, Colorado, and unfurled its colors on Founders Field May 14, 2015.

His initial major publication, The American Monomyth, written with Robert Jewett, was published in 1977. Career The major contribution of The American Monomyth is a re-thinking of Joseph Campbell's famous classical monomyth from his 1949 book The Hero With a Thousand Faces. Campbell's monomyth described a universal narrative of the myth of the hero's journey which he claimed had disappeared in contemporary culture. Lawrence and Jewett described an American evolution of this mythological structure that reflected a deep antipathy to democratic institutions through the violent actions of a hero who remains separate from the community. This pattern varies significantly from Campbell's, that emphasizes the hero's return to the community with some kind of significant aid (\\"the boon\\") and a willingness to accept public leadership as a member of that community. Responding to the Star Trek fan movement of the late 60s and early 70s, they predicted the rise of entertainment-based systems of religious belief ‚Äì a reality that became even more evident with the Star Wars phenomenon. Lawrence and Jewett have since further expanded these initial ideas in two more books: The Myth of the American Superhero (2002),Findarticles.com which extends the analysis of the American Monomyth of American mass culture into areas such as videogames, and Captain America and the Crusade Against Evil: The Dilemma of Zealous Nationalism (2003), (with Jewett listed as first author) which traces the history of holy wars and uses the American Monomyth concept to understand the American reaction after the events of September 11, 2001. The three books work together to suggest a mythological analysis of American culture in ways that account for religion, political history, mass (or popular) culture and are well regarded both in the United States and in Europe where they are read as a means of understanding American foreign policy. In collaborating with Matthew Wilhelm Kapell, Lawrence has explored the idea of the \\"mythic franchise,\\" the core mythic story that is licensed for a myriad of commercial entertainment venues. In Matthew Kapell and William G. Doty's Jacking In to the Matrix Franchise: Cultural Reception and Interpretation (2005), he explores the kind of fascism that is symbolically conveyed by heroic figures such as Luke Skywalker of Star Wars (1977) and Neo in The Matrix series. Matthew Kapell and Lawrence's co- edited book, Finding the Force of the Star Wars Franchise: Fans, Merchandise, and Critics (2006), examines the myths, the stereotypes, sexualities, the toys, and the critical response to the two Star Wars trilogies. Lawrence's essay contribution suggests that George Lucas outgrew Joseph Campbell's aversion to political affirmations, especially in the final three films of the series. Lawrence has provided essays and filmographies for the Film and History League's publications Hollywood's White House: The American Presidency in Film and History (2003); there he suggests that Hollywood has begun to represent the president as a physical superhero in such films as Independence Day (1996) and Air Force One (1997); in Hollywood's West: The American Frontier in Film Television and History (2005), he analyzes The Lone Ranger as a juvenile franchise that has affected adult culture; in Landscape of Hollywood Westerns: Ecocriticism in an American Film Genre (2006), he has traced the little recognized subgenre of the Ecowestern. In collaboration with Morningside College professor Marty Knepper, Lawrence published The Book of Iowa Films in June 2014. The book is the only comprehensive history and discussion of over 400 Iowa movies from 1918 through 2013, including both Hollywood films and independent films. It covers films made in Iowa, films set in Iowa, films featuring traveling Iowans, as well as films that merely mention Iowa.

Seven Star Crags Cave river within the Seven Star Crags The Seven Star Crags () are located across from the center of Zhaoqing City, Guangdong, People's Republic of China. The crags are all situated in or around Star Lake directly across from Paifang square in downtown Zhaoqing. The area including the crags and Star Lake compromise 8 km2. The lake is partitioned into five separate sections divided with small strips of land and walkways. They form one of the most scenic locations in the province and are one of the main tourist draws of the city, the other being Dinghu Mountain. The crags are many times referred to as the little Guilin due to their striking visual similarity to Guilin's mountains. Description The limestone crags are naturally arranged in the same formation as the seven stars of the Big Dipper constellation. Legend has it that the pillars of limestone grew from stars that fell from the skies. There are a number of caves in this area and some contain underground rivers that are large enough to navigate by boat. One of the crags can be climbed, having steep stairs going up the side; at the top is a small pavilion for viewing the lake and neighboring crags. Boat tours of the crags and lake can be taken from the area West of Paifang Square. Star Lake has been designated a national park.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/guangdong/zhaoqing/2011-07/01/content_12817646_2.htm Numerous sculptures of Buddhist and Taoist idols are located around Star Lake. There is also a reserve for migratory birds within reach by boat ride. Beautiful views of the crags and lake can be seen by driving or walking on Xinghu West Road on the West of the lake and Xinghu Avenue on the East. Seven Star Crags consist of crags, lake and caves. The seven crags, seen like the Big Dipper at a distance, stand one after another around a vast expanse of dark green lake water. With the grotesque crags, fantastic caves and beautiful lakes, Seven Star Crags have long been reputed as a wonderful place boasting picturesque scenery of the West Lake in Hangzhou and the Hills in Guilin. There are 531 pieces of cliff inscription in this place. It is a major historical and cultural site under state protection.

KSS is a more severe syndromic variant of chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (abbreviated CPEO), a syndrome that is characterized by isolated involvement of the muscles controlling movement of the eyelid (levator palpebrae, orbicularis oculi) and eye (extra-ocular muscles). This results in ptosis and ophthalmoplegia respectively. KSS involves a combination of the already described CPEO as well as pigmentary retinopathy in both eyes and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Other symptoms may include cerebellar ataxia, proximal muscle weakness, deafness, diabetes mellitus, growth hormone deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and other endocrinopathies. In both of these diseases, muscle involvement may begin unilaterally but always develops into a bilateral deficit, and the course is progressive. This discussion is limited specifically to the more severe and systemically involved variant. Signs and symptoms Individuals with KSS present initially in a similar way to those with typical CPEO. Onset is in the first and second decades of life. The first symptom of this disease is a unilateral ptosis, or difficulty opening the eyelids, that gradually progresses to a bilateral ptosis. As the ptosis worsens, the individual commonly extends their neck, elevating their chin in an attempt to prevent the eyelids from occluding the visual axis. Along with the insidious development of ptosis, eye movements eventually become limited causing a person to rely more on turning the head side to side or up and down to view objects in the peripheral visual field. =Pigmentary retinopathy= Retinitis pigmentosa, mid stage KSS results in a pigmentation of the retina, primarily in the posterior fundus. The appearance is described as a \\"salt-and- pepper\\" appearance. There is diffuse depigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium with the greatest effect occurring at the macula. This is in contrast to retinitis pigmentosa where the pigmentation is peripheral. The appearance of the retina in KSS is similar to that seen in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (abbreviated DM1). Modest night-blindness can be seen in patients with KSS. Visual acuity loss is usually mild and only occurs in 40‚Äì50% of patients. =Cardiac conduction abnormalities= These most often occur years after the development of ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. Atrioventricular (abbreviated \\"AV\\") block is the most common cardiac conduction deficit. This often progresses to a Third-degree atrioventricular block, which is a complete blockage of the electrical conduction from the atrium to the ventricle. Symptoms of heart block include syncope, exercise intolerance, and bradycardia. =Cerebral folate deficiency= Kearns-Sayre patients are consistently found to have cerebral folate deficiency, a syndrome in which 5-MTHF levels are decreased in the cerebrospinal fluid despite being normal in serum. Treatment with folinic acid can in some cases alleviate the associated symptoms and partially correct associated brain abnormalities, especially if started early in the course of illness. The proposed cause of cerebral folate deficiency in the Kearns‚ÄìSayre syndrome is the failure of the mechanisms in the choroid plexus that are responsible for passage of folates from the serum to the cerebrospinal fluid. =Cause and prevalence= As characterized in Kearns' original publication in 1965 and in later publications, inconsistent features of KSS that may occur are weakness of facial, pharyngeal, trunk, and extremity muscles, hearing loss, small stature, electroencephalographic changes, cerebellar ataxia and elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid protein. Kearns‚ÄìSayre syndrome occurs spontaneously in the majority of cases. In some cases it has been shown to be inherited through mitochondrial, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive inheritance. There is no predilection for race or sex, and there are no known risk factors. As of 1992 there were only 226 cases reported in published literature. Although NIH and other studies estimate occurrence in the population to be 1-3 and some as high as 9 in 100,000 individuals but a failure to be referred to specialist centres and recognise the disease symptoms is common Genetics KSS is the result of deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that cause a particular constellation of medical signs and symptoms. mtDNA is transmitted exclusively from the mother's ovum. Mitochondrial DNA is composed of 37 genes found in the single circular chromosome measuring 16,569 base pairs in length. Among these, 13 genes encode proteins of the electron transport chain (abbreviated \\"ETC\\"), 22 encode transfer RNA (tRNA), and two encode the large and small subunits that form ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The 13 proteins involved in the ETC of the mitochondrion are necessary for oxidative phosphorylation. Mutations in these proteins results in impaired energy production by mitochondria. This cellular energy deficit manifests most readily in tissues that rely heavily upon aerobic metabolism such as the brain, skeletal and cardiac muscles, sensory organs, and kidneys. This is one factor involved in the presentation of mitochondrial diseases. There are other factors involved in the manifestation of a mitochondrial disease besides the size and location of a mutation. Mitochondria replicate during each cell division during gestation and throughout life. Because the mutation in mitochondrial disease most often occurs early in gestation in these diseases, only those mitochondria in the mutated lineage are defective. This results in an uneven distribution of dysfunctional mitochondria within each cell, and among different tissues of the body. This describes the term heteroplasmic which is characteristic of mitochondrial diseases including KSS. The distribution of mutated mtDNA in each cell, tissue, and organ, is dependent on when and where the mutation occurs. This may explain why two patients with an identical mutation in mtDNA can present with entirely different phenotypes and in turn different syndromes. A publication in 1992 by Fischel-Ghodsian et al. identified the same 4,977-bp deletion in mtDNA in two patients presenting with two entirely different diseases. One of the patients had characteristic KSS, while the other patient had a very different disease known as Pearson marrow pancreas syndrome. Complicating the matter, in some cases Pearson's syndrome has been shown to progress into KSS later in life. More recent studies have concluded that mtDNA duplications may also play a significant role in determining what phenotype is present. Duplications of mtDNA seem to be characteristic of all cases of KSS and Pearson's syndrome, while they are absent in CPEO. Deletions of mtDNA in KSS vary in size (1.3‚Äì8kb), as well as position in the mitochondrial genome. The most common deletion is 4.9kb and spans from position 8469 to position 13147 on the genome. This deletion is present in approximately ‚Öì of people with KSS Diagnosis An example of ragged red fibers A neuro-ophthalmologist is usually involved in the diagnosis and management of KSS. An individual should be suspected of having KSS based upon clinical exam findings. Suspicion for myopathies should be increased in patients whose ophthalmoplegia does not match a particular set of cranial nerve palsies (oculomotor nerve palsy, fourth nerve palsy, sixth nerve palsy). Initially, imaging studies are often performed to rule out more common pathologies. Diagnosis may be confirmed with muscle biopsy, and may be supplemented with PCR determination of mtDNA mutations. =Biopsy findings= It is not necessary to biopsy an ocular muscle to demonstrate histopathologic abnormalities. Cross-section of muscle fibers stained with G√∂m√∂ri trichrome stain is viewed using light microscopy. In muscle fibers containing high ratios of the mutated mitochondria, there is a higher concentration of mitochondria. This gives these fibers a darker red color, causing the overall appearance of the biopsy to be described as \\"ragged red fibers. Abnormalities may also be demonstrated in muscle biopsy samples using other histochemical studies such as mitochondrial enzyme stains, by electron microscopy, biochemical analyses of the muscle tissue (ie electron transport chain enzyme activities), and by analysis of muscle mitochondrial DNA. \\" = Laboratory studies = Blood lactate and pyruvate levels usually are elevated as a result of increased anaerobic metabolism and a decreased ratio of ATP:ADP. CSF analysis shows an elevated protein level, usually >100 mg/dl, as well as an elevated lactate level.  Management  Currently there is no curative treatment for KSS. Because it is a rare condition, there are only case reports of treatments with very little data to support their effectiveness. Several promising discoveries have been reported which may support the discovery of new treatments with further research. Satellite cells are responsible for muscle fiber regeneration. It has been noted that mutant mtDNA is rare or undetectable in satellite cells cultured from patients with KSS. Shoubridge et al. (1997) asked the question whether wildtype mtDNA could be restored to muscle tissue by encouraging muscle regeneration. In the forementioned study, regenerating muscle fibers were sampled at the original biopsy site, and it was found that they were essentially homoplasmic for wildtype mtDNA. Perhaps with future techniques of promoting muscle cell regeneration and satellite cell proliferation, functional status in KSS patients could be greatly improved. One study described a patient with KSS who had reduced serum levels of coenzyme Q10. Administration of 60‚Äì120 mg of Coenzyme Q10 for 3 months resulted in normalization of lactate and pyruvate levels, improvement of previously diagnosed first degree AV block, and improvement of ocular movements. A screening ECG is recommended in all patients presenting with CPEO. In KSS, implantation of pacemaker is advised following the development of significant conduction disease, even in asymptomatic patients. Screening for endocrinologic disorders should be performed, including measuring serum glucose levels, thyroid function tests, calcium and magnesium levels, and serum electrolyte levels. Hyperaldosteronism is seen in 3% of KSS patients. History The triad of CPEO, bilateral pigmentary retinopathy, and cardiac conduction abnormalities was first described in a case report of two patients in 1958 by Thomas P. Kearns (1922-2011), MD., and George Pomeroy Sayre (1911-1992), MD. A second case was published in 1960 by Jager and co- authors reporting these symptoms in a 13-year-old boy. Previous cases of patients with CPEO dying suddenly had been published, occasionally documented as from a cardiac dysrhythmia. Other cases had noted a peculiar pigmentation of the retina, but none of these publications had documented these three pathologies occurring together as a genetic syndrome. Kearns published a defining case in 1965 describing 9 unrelated cases with this triad. In 1988, the first connection was made between KSS and large-scale deletions of muscle mitochondrial DNA (abbreviated mtDNA) Since this discovery, numerous deletions in mitochondrial DNA have been linked to the development of KSS.

He is buried in the churchyard of Brechin Cathedral. The large obelisk marking his grave lies north west of the church. Family Lord Panmure married Patricia Heron Gordon on 1 December 1794. They had nine children, including: *Fox Maule Ramsay (1801-1874), later 2nd Baron Panmure and 11th Earl of Dalhousie. *Hon. Lauderdale Maule (1807-1854). Nevertheless, he was estranged from his wife, and quarrelled with his eldest son for siding with her. Patricia died in 1821, and on 4 June 1822, Maule married Elizabeth Barton. Through this connection he inherited the estates of Barnton, Edinburgh and rebuilt the main house Barton House to a design by David Hamilton.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker References External links * Category:1771 births Category:1852 deaths Category:Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom Maule, William Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Scottish constituencies Category:British MPs 1790‚Äì1796 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies Category:UK MPs 1802‚Äì1806 Category:UK MPs 1806‚Äì1807 Category:UK MPs 1807‚Äì1812 Category:UK MPs 1812‚Äì1818 Category:UK MPs 1818‚Äì1820 Category:UK MPs 1820‚Äì1826 Category:UK MPs 1826‚Äì1830 Category:UK MPs 1830‚Äì1831 Category:UK MPs who were granted peerages William ","title":"William Maule, 1st Baron Panmure"},{"id":"3021757","text":"Sir John Eric Erichsen, 1st Baronet (19 July 1818 ‚Äì 23 September 1896) was a Danish-born British surgeon.  Early life  Erichsen was born in Copenhagen, the son of Eric Erichsen, a member of a well-known Danish banking family. He attended Mansion house school, Hammersmith.  Surgical career  Erichsen began his medical studies at University College, London under Robert Liston. Going on to Paris, he witnessed his first colotomy under Amussat before returning to London as house surgeon. He devoted himself in the early years of his career to physiology, and lecturing on general anatomy and physiology at University College Hospital.John Eric Erichsen in 1853 In 1844 Erichsen was secretary to the physiological section of the British Association, and in 1845 he was awarded the Fothergillian gold medal of the Royal Humane Society for his essay on asphyxia. In 1848 he was appointed assistant surgeon at University College Hospital, and in 1850 became full surgeon and professor of surgery, his lectures and clinical teaching being much admired; and in 1875 he joined the consulting staff. In June 1876 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. By 1887, he held his most prestigious honor of president of the council of university college. His Science and Art of Surgery (1853) went through many editions, of which Marcus Beck had the 8th and 9th editions include Joseph Lister's antiseptic techniques and Pasteur and Robert Koch's germ theory. He rose to be president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1880. From 1879 to 1881 he was president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He was created a baronet in 1895, having been for some years surgeon-extraordinary to Queen Victoria. As a surgeon his reputation was world-wide, and he counts (says Sir W. MacCormac in his volume on the Centenary of the Royal College of Surgeons) among the makers of modern surgery. He was a recognized authority on concussion of the spine, and was often called to give evidence in court on apparent cases of railway spine. Erichsen is inaccuratelyDavid Henige, \\"Mis/Adventures in Mis/Quoting,\\" Journal of Scholarly Publishing 2001, 32(3), 123-136. credited with this statement from 1873: \\"There cannot always be fresh fields of conquest by the knife; there must be portions of the human frame that will ever remain sacred from its intrusions, at least in the surgeon's hands. That we have already, if not quite, reached these final limits, there can be little question. The abdomen, the chest, and the brain will be forever shut from the intrusion of the wise and humane surgeon.\\" (quoted in Christopher Cerf and Victor Navasky (eds.), I Wish I Hadn't Said That: The Experts Speak and Get it Wrong! (2000), 31. (Cf. Clarke's First Law, from Profiles of the Future ‚Äì see Wikipedia article, Clarke's Three Laws: \\"When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.\\") The correct quotation is \\"There cannot always be fresh fields for conquest by the knife. There must be portions of the human frame that will ever remain sacred from its intrusion ‚Äì at least, in the surgeon‚Äôs hand. That we have nearly, if not quite, reached these final limits there can be little question.\\" John Eric Erichsen, \\"The Tendencies of Modern Surgery,\\" The Medical Times and Gazette, 1873, 2, 375-379.John Eric Erichsen, Modern Surgery: Its Progress and Tendencies (London: H.K. Lewis 1873). p. 11. The final sentence in the inaccurately quoted statement actually comes from a biography of Joseph Lister, written well after Erichsen died, in which the following sentence appears: \\"Mr. Erichsen believed that the abdomen, the brain, and the chest would be for ever shut from the intrusions of a wise and humane surgeon.\\" Guy Theodore Wrench, Lord Lister, His Life and Work, (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1913), p. 281. Later writers falsely attributed these words by the biographer to Erichsen himself, but this is attribution is inappropriate: the text in Erichsen's 1873 address immediately following the quoted sentences mentions surgical procedures \\"from the base of the brain to the lowest organ in the pelvic cavity\\" as \\"triumphs of the surgeon's art.\\" A more complete reading of Erichsen's address suggests that his views were much more nuanced.Walton Martin, \\"The Future of Surgery,\\" Annals of Surgery 1929, 89(2), 161-175.  Personal life  Erichsen married Mary Elizabeth on 10 September 1842, eldest daughter of Captain Thomas Cole RN. She died childless in 1893. His personality has been described as \\"honourable and candid\\" and his appearance as \\"attractive\\". He was considered a gentleman and known for accepting his junior surgeon's advances. Erichsen died at Folkestone in 1896 and was buried in Hampstead Cemetery.

Description Like all morning glories the plant entwines itself around structures, growing to a height of tall. The leaves are heart-shaped and the stems are covered with brown hairs. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, predominantly blue to purple or white, and diameter. Distribution and habitat The plant is predisposed to moist and rich soil, but can be found growing in a wide array of soil types.Richard H. Uva, Joseph C. Neal and Joseph M. Ditomaso, Weeds of The Northeast, (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1997), Pp. 214-217. It is naturalized throughout warm temperate and subtropical regions of the world. Although it is often considered a noxious weed, Ipomoea purpurea is also grown for its beautiful purple and white flowers and has many cultivars. Common cultivars include I. purpurea 'Crimson Rambler' (red-violet blossoms with white throats), 'Grandpa Ott's,' 'Kniola's Black Knight,' and 'Star of Yelta' (blossoms in varying shades of deep purple with white or pale pink throats) and 'Milky Way' (white blossoms with mauve accents). Chemistry The triangular seeds have some history of use as a psychedelic; they, like Ipomoea tricolor may contain LSA. Effects are reported to be somewhat similar to those of LSD.Charles Savage, Willis W. Harman and James Fadiman, Ipomoea purpurea: A Naturally Occurring Psychedelic =Flower color= Acylated cyanidin glycosides can be isolated from violet-blue flowers of I. purpurea. These anthocyanins were all based on cyanidin 3-sophoroside-5-glucoside, acylated with caffeic acid and/or p-coumaric acid. Acylated pelargonidin glycosides can be isolated from the red-purple flowers of I. purpurea. The acylated anthocyanins were all based on pelargonidin 3-sophoroside-5-glucoside, acylated with caffeic acid and/or glucosylcaffeic acid. =Toxic treatments= Commercial morning glory seeds are commonly treated with toxic methylmercury which serves as a preservative and a cumulative neurotoxic poison that is considered useful by some to discourage recreational use of them. There is no legal requirement in the United States to disclose to buyers that seeds have been treated with a toxic heavy metal compound. According to the book Substances of Abuse, in addition to methylmercury, the seeds are commonly coated with a chemical that cannot be removed with washing that is designed to cause unpleasant physical symptoms such as nausea and abdominal pain. The book states that this chemical is also toxic.

It forms a projection towards the South Downs National Park and is generally included within Fareham's population as it is within its built-up area.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=1119884904 The village grew from the development of a clay quarry, the clay used to make chimney pots and bricks -- acclaimed Fareham red (bricks) used to build premium Victorian buildings such as the Royal Albert Hall in London, and Knowle Hospital near Fareham. Sometimes known as Fontley by locals (reflecting its probable longstanding alternate pronunciation, as it appears in church use and many other place names such as Mottisfont) the village is no longer a discrete settlement owing to post-World War II growth of Fareham, it is an exurb in rural surrounds separated from the town by the M27 motorway. Its brickworks is long closed and the chapel closed in 2018. Its former clay quarry is a fishing lake. The village pub, The Miner's Arms, echoes its mid-19th century spell as a near-independent community. Amenities =The Miner's Arms= The Miner's Arms is so called because the first landlord, George Feast, was the contractor for the railway tunnel (and also the narrow, humpback bridge). Feast imported a gang of Welsh miners to dig the tunnel, and one of the miners had the privilege of naming it. The pub soon became the hub of the village and was originally both a pub and bottle shop for the miners and, later, the local brick-makers; it was run by at least three or four generations of the Feast family throughout the height of the brickmaking industry. After the decline of the industry, many inhabitants moved to Portsmouth and Gosport for work. =Open space= Funtley has a park laid to grass with a children's playground, and a meadow managed for conservation by Fareham Borough Council. There is also a fishing lake with a public footpath. History =Fontley Iron Mills= Fontley House in Iron Mill Lane was home to Samuel Jellicoe from about 1784 until his death in 1812. He was the partner of Henry Cort of Fontley Iron Mills, adjacent. Cort was the inventor of the rolling mill and the puddling furnace, important for the production of iron during the Napoleonic Wars. Some of Cort's inventions were tried out at these mills. Cort's innovation was a new process for \\"fining\\" iron. This became essential once blast furnaces were used to extract iron from its ore. The \\"pig\\" iron produced was too impure for forging (though it could be cast): fining removed the impurities. The previous method of fining used a finery hearth fuelled with charcoal. By Cort's time wood for making charcoal had long become too scarce to enable the iron industry to expand: already many blast furnaces were using coke instead of charcoal. What Cort did was to burn coal in the furnace then \\"puddle\\" his impure iron, i.e. stir it with a long rod in the hot gas of the flames. The purified iron came out as spongy mass, and had to be consolidated (shingling). Another of Cort's innovations was to use grooved rolls in a rolling mill rather than a hammer to draw the iron out into a bar. This enabled the iron to be rolled into bars with a variety of cross- sections (square, circular, etc.). These two brilliant innovations were the most important ones for the iron industry in the Industrial Revolution.R. A. Mott (ed. P. Singer), Henry Cort: the great finer: creator of puddled iron (Metals Society, London 1983); Malcolm Low, Funtley Iron Mill - Henry Cort - copies available in reference sections of publication can be viewed in the Fareham Library and Westbury Museum, both at Fareham, Hampshire. The former ruins of this industrial revolution iron mill with smelter's yard showed where the ore was also smelted, local ironstone being used. ;Manorial history The place is the remnant piece of two manors in the hundred of Titchfield, Great Funtley and Little Funtley (or Funtley Parva/Pageham). The manors first appear in the Domesday Book. The wider hundred was mostly Titchfield parish. It was locally a mixture of forest and relatively short farming leases that belonged to the crown.https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol3/p217 Accordingly, in 1279 John of Brittany withdrew his suit (of court) (claim to outright or continued ownership) in respect of his manors of Crofton, Lee Markes, and Funtley, and as he did not appear the sheriff was ordered to distrain (in favour of the King) upon his land. It was among a handful of manors in Titchfield's parish, the church of which dates to 680 AD, and contributed to the early founding of Titchfield Abbey. The other manor vested in the Arundel family from 1241 to 1615, but who long-let it, successively to the de Hoyvilles, Uvedales, others, Sir Richard Corbett and then Rashleighs whose 19th century holders had it much divided (sold off in pieces). Some of the area of the former manors has contributed to modern-day Knowle, a hill- top, compact village. ;Railway tunnel Henry Feast began selling beer in Funtley in 1839. He was in court, held in the \\"Red Lion\\", Fareham, charged with keeping a disorderly beer house on 18 December 1839; he was convicted and paid a fine and costs totalling 40 shillings. Feast bought the property that became \\"The Miners' Arms\\" from Robert James, a merchant of Fareham, with a ¬£100 mortgage on 5 March 1840. The first time the name \\"The Miners' Arms\\" appears is on the 1841 Census return, where Feast is described as a labourer, probably working on the construction of the railway during the day, leaving the beer house and shop to be run by his wife and children. The Register of Licensees for beer shops and public houses starts in 1872 (previous records do not survive), and shows Feast as the owner and licensee in 1872 and 1873. Feast died 28 September 1874 aged 76; the previous year he conveyed everything to his eldest son George, who is recorded as the owner and licensee from 28 September 1874. George retained the property until 29 February 1892 when he sold it to Henry William Saunders. James Feast, son of George, became the licensee after the sale, and remained such until December 1913, when George Robert James Oakes succeeded him. After Saunders died, his wife Annie Elizabeth is described as the owner and mortgagee on the licence until 8 February 1905, when it shows his two sons Herbert Henry and Richard John Saunders as owners; presumably the mortgage had been settled. In 1921, the wall separating the bar and refreshment room was taken down to give the licensee supervision over both. Herbert Henry and Richard John, whose Wallington Brewery, had to sell everything on 31 March 1944. The reason is stated in \\"Fareham Past and Present\\".a publication by the Local History Group The buyer, Charles Hamilton and Co. Ltd, held the pub for 26 years until its sale to Bass Charrington on 1 July 1970. It came into the possession of George Gale and Co.

Life and career Granin started writing in the 1930s, while he was still an engineering student at the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute. After graduation, Granin began working as a senior engineer at an energy laboratory, and shortly after war broke out, he volunteered to fight as a soldier. One of the first widely praised works of Granin was a short story about graduate students titled \\"Variant vtoroi\\" (The second variant), which was published in the journal Zvezda in 1949. Granin had continued to study engineering and work as a technical writer before he achieved literary success, thanks to his Iskateli (The Seekers, 1955), a novel inspired by his career in engineering. This book was about the overly bureaucratic Soviet system, which tended to stifle new ideas. Granin served as a board member of the Leningrad Union of Writers, and he was a winner of many medals and honors including the State Prize for Literature in 1978 and Hero of Socialist Labor 1989. He continued writing in the post-Soviet era.

Lewis became the first presenter of the One O'Clock News on BBC One on 27 October 1986 when it was launched as part of the introduction of the channel's daytime schedule, replacing News After Noon. Subsequently, he presented other bulletins including the Six O'Clock News and Nine O'Clock News. He created a modicum of controversy in 1993 when he claimed that television should feature more \\"good news\\". He subsequently stated that he had been misunderstood on the matter. Lewis played a prominent role in the announcement of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on Sunday 31 August 1997. He was called into the BBC in the early hours of that morning to present short national bulletins during a late night viewing of Borsalino about the car accident in Paris. He returned home afterwards to get some sleep ‚Äì expecting the Princess to pull through ‚Äì only to be drafted in again in time for the special 6am bulletin covering Diana's death. During the marathon coverage which was simulcast on BBC1, BBC World as well as broadcasters around the world which took in the BBC news feed, Lewis was almost brought to tears following Tony Blair's \\"People's Princess\\" statement. His uninterrupted presenting stint ended mid-afternoon when Peter Sissons took over. On 26 April 1999, a few weeks before the BBC relaunched its news programmes, he presented the Six O'Clock news bulletin with Jennie Bond on the day his co-host Jill Dando was murdered outside her home in West London. He also appeared on rival ITN that evening to pay tribute to his dead colleague. He presented his last bulletin at the start of May 1999 from Edinburgh, reporting on Scottish devolution, signing off with, \\"And from me, it's goodbye.\\" Other television As part of the celebrations for ITN's 50th anniversary, he returned to television news to present a special edition of the ITV Evening News with Mary Nightingale in September 2005.

She was named for George Hamilton Perkins. Perkins was laid down 15 November 1934 at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington. She was launched 31 December 1935, sponsored by Mrs. Larz Anderson, commissioned 18 September 1936, with Lieutenant Commander Samuel P. Jenkins in command. Operational history Assigned first to Destroyers, Scouting Force then to Destroyers, Battle Force, Perkins was homeported at San Diego, California and operated in the eastern Pacific prior to World War II. At Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul, 7 December 1941, she reported for convoy escort duty on the 15th and on the 17th was en route to Pearl Harbor. By 15 January 1942 she was back at Mare Island for the installation of new radar equipment and on the 25th she returned to Hawaii. On 2 February she departed Pearl Harbor with , for the southwest Pacific. On the 14th she joined Australian, New Zealand and other U.S. ships in the ANZAC Squadron then charged with protecting the eastern approaches to Australia and New Zealand. Through the spring, she continued operations with that squadron, steaming at times with fast carrier forces as they plied the Coral Sea to strike at enemy encroachments, escorting refueling units to rendezvous areas, and screening larger ships of her own and combined forces as they blasted enemy positions from New Guinea to the Solomon Islands. Perkins steaming through heavy seas, 27 August 1937 On 1‚Äì2 May, the squadron joined with TF 11 and TF 17, then screened the carriers of those forces as their planes struck at Tulagi to open the Battle of the Coral Sea. Detached on the 7th, the squadron steamed to the Louisiade Archipelago to intercept a Japanese amphibious attack on Port Moresby via the Jomard Passage. That afternoon the ships were attacked by land-based planes, and in driving them off contributed to the diverting of the Japanese force, thus accomplishing the mission without engaging the enemy ships and setting the stage for the final action of the Battle of the Coral Sea‚Äîthe carrier battle on 8 May. As the carrier forces fought to a draw, the ANZAC squadron continued to patrol to the southeast of Papua. On the 10th the squadron headed for Australia and for almost two months Perkins escorted convoys and patrolled off harbor entrances along that country's Coral and Tasman Sea coasts. During this time, Perkins was one of several major Allied vessels in Sydney Harbour during the Japanese midget submarine attack of 31 May 1942. On 11 July she sailed for Auckland, thence to Noumea. Convoy escort duty between Suva and New Caledonia followed and in mid- August she was forced back to New Zealand for propeller repairs. On the 20th, however, she sailed for Pearl Harbor where repairs were completed and additional radar equipment and 40 mm guns were installed. In mid-November Perkins headed west again, arriving at Espiritu Santo on the 27th. Three days later she departed Segond Channel in Rear Admiral Carleton Wright's cruiser- destroyer force to intercept and destroy enemy forces attempting to reinforce their units on Guadalcanal. At 2315, five radar contacts were made and a few minutes later the Battle of Tassafaronga was engaged. Perkins loosed eight torpedoes, scoring none, then turned her guns on the beach. Undamaged in the encounter she turned toward Tulagi to assist the burning Pensacola, while Maury went to assist New Orleans. Continuing operations from Tulagi, she bombarded the Guadalcanal coast and served on escort assignments until January 1943. A brief availability at Noumea followed and by the 13th she was back at Tulagi for further escort and support missions. At the end of April Perkins joined TF 10 for tactical training and in May she returned to Australia to join the forces gathering for the thrust up the New Guinea coast to gain control of the Huon Peninsula. Into the summer the base at Milne Bay grew. At the end of June, Allied amphibious forces moved into Nassau Bay, just south of Salamaua, and into the Trobriands. Infantry units pressed toward Salamaua- Australians from Wau in the foothills of the Owen Stanley Range and Americans from Nassau Bay. PT boats punched at the enemy's Finschhafen-Lae supply line and AAF and RAAF planes bombed and strafed Japanese installations as far as Wewak and Madang. On 21 August Perkins, flagship of DesRon 5, led Smith, Conyngham, and Mahan out of Milne Bay to make a sweep of Huon Gulf then bombard Finschhafen. On the night of 22‚Äì23 August they accomplished their mission and brought naval gunfire back to the New Guinea campaign after its absence through 18 months of ground fighting. On 4 September Perkins bombarded the coast between the Bulu and Buso rivers, then covered Allied soldiers as they streamed ashore at Red Beach and headed toward Lae. On the 8th, she trained her guns on the isolated garrison at Lae and on the 15th the last remnants of that garrison pulled out. Salamaua, dependent on Lae, had already fallen and on the 16th Allied forces marched into Lae. Fate Finschhafen fell 2 October, the scouring of the river valleys commenced, and the increase in Allied traffic in Huon Gulf, together with the presence of Japanese submarines, brought Perkins back to escort duty. Reinforcements were escorted to Langemak Bay and to Scarlet Beach east of Satelberg. In November escort duties continued. Then, on 28 November 1943, she departed Milne Bay for Buna, steaming independently. Shortly before 0200 on the 29th a dark image emerged from the blackness and a few minutes later the Australian troopship Duntroon rammed her on the portside, amidships. Splitting in two, Perkins went down approximately 2 miles off Ipoteto Island. Nine personnel were killed, and a tenth seriously injured. A court of inquiry, held in San Francisco the following month, later held the captain of Perkins accountable for the incident, along with his executive officer and officer-of-the-deck. Honors Perkins earned 4 battle stars during World War II.

O'Rourke remained manager of the band until his death, negotiating the band's split with bass player and main songwriter Roger Waters. Life and Pink Floyd manager O'Rourke's father, Tommy O'Rourke, was a fisherman on the Aran Islands off the West of Ireland. He travelled to London for the premiere of the Robert Flaherty documentary film, Man of Aran, in which he appeared as a shark hunter. He settled in London, where Steve was born in the suburb of Willesden. O'Rourke trained as an accountant and went to work with Bryan Morrison Agency, which became a part of NEMS Enterprises, as a junior agent and book keeper. Initially O'Rourke booked gigs for Pink Floyd, while the band was managed by Peter Jenner and Andrew King. When Pink Floyd parted company with Syd Barrett in 1968, King and Jenner remained with Barrett, and O'Rourke took over managing the band. In the early 1970s, O'Rourke left NEMS, and founded his own company, EMKA Productions, named after his first daughter Emma Kate. (O'Rourke subsequently fathered another daughter and three sons). During post-production of the film Pink Floyd ‚Äì The Wall, he received a phone call in the office of Alan Parker, the film director. It was Roger Waters, requesting a meeting. On the way out of Parker's office, O'Rourke failed to see the closed glass doors, which he shattered. He was badly cut and concussed. When he opened his eyes, he saw Parker's secretary Angie picking glass out of his face. He ended up marrying her, having one son. This was his second marriage, as he previously eloped with a lady simply named \\"Linda\\". Linda stood by both Steve and the band through their formative years. She has two daughters and a son (all with Steve), lives in Surrey, and is a therapist. O'Rourke suffered a stroke and died in Miami, Florida, in 2003. His funeral service was held on 14 November 2003 at Chichester Cathedral in Sussex, England, where, as a tribute, Pink Floyd members David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason performed together in public for the first time since October 1994. They played \\"Fat Old Sun\\" and \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\", with Dick Parry playing the saxophone as he followed the coffin. David Gilmour's 2006 solo album On an Island was dedicated to O'Rourke's memory (as well as memories of tour manager Tony Howard and arranger/orchestrator Michael Kamen). Nick Mason's book Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd was also dedicated to O'Rourke. Racing career O'Rourke also built a highly successful parallel career as an enthusiastic gentleman racing driver ‚Äì a lifelong passion which he shared with the Floyd's drummer Nick Mason and, to a lesser extent, with David Gilmour. He adored historic racing with cars of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. His ambition to compete at the Le Mans 24 Hours was realised in 1979 when he finished twelfth in his Ferrari 512 BB. He returned to Le Mans in 1980, but after a tire exploded at nearly on the Mulsanne Straight, O'Rourke bought the spare tail of a retired sister Ferrari in the pit lane to finish. His car completed the race wearing green forward bodywork and a red tail. In 1981 he founded EMKA Racing and began competition in a BMW M1 with Derek Bell. For Le Mans he was joined by David Hobbs and Eddie Jordan. O'Rourke left the circuit on the night of the race to oversee a Pink Floyd concert in London, then flew back the next morning and jumped straight into the car for another two-hour driving stint. In 1982 he contested two rounds of the British Formula One Championship. His team later became supported by Aston Martin and he assisted in the construction of a Group C sportscar for Le Mans in 1983. The car saw success by 1985, when it briefly led the 24-Hours in the hands of co-driver Tiff Needell and finished ahead of the works-backed Jaguars, to O'Rourke's great amusement. However, the team folded soon after when Aston Martin left the project. In 1991 he and David Gilmour co-drove a Jaguar C-Type in the PanAmerican retro race through Mexico, surviving a dramatic crash with only a broken leg. The events were covered in La Carrera Panamericana‚Äîa film about the race, which included a soundtrack of previously released tracks and new tracks from Pink Floyd. In 1991 he resurrected EMKA Racing and begin varied participation in the British GT Championship, BPR Global GT Series and FIA GT Championship. He earned the British GT GT2 class drivers championship with co- driver Tim Sugden in 1997, then again in the GT1 class in 1998. However O'Rourke's greatest racing success came while co-driving a McLaren F1 GTR at Le Mans with Tim Sugden and Bill Auberlen to finish fourth overall. Having saved money by refusing the costly update pack for the McLaren, O'Rourke typically spent as much again on a huge party for all concerned in the EMKA team's success. From 2000 O'Rourke concentrated on the FIA GT Championship driving an until he was forced to retire from driving for health reasons; he then presided over the drivers Tim Sugden, Martin Short and factory Porsche driver Emmanuel Collard as they won at Pergusa and Anderstorp. Porsche responded by offering racing assistance to the EMKA factory for the 2004 season, to the delight of O'Rourke. O'Rourke's death soon after the end of the 2003 season led to the shutdown of EMKA Racing.

It lies south of Norwich city centre and north of Bungay. Its population has rapidly grown in the past 50 years. It covers an area of and had a population of 3,261 living in 1,403 households at the 2001 census, the population increasing to 3,802 at the 2011 Census. Poringland was previously also known as both East Poringland and Great Poringland, and was part of the ancient Hundred of Henstead. The place-name 'Poringland' is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as 'Porringhelanda', the meaning of which is uncertain. Some believe the name derives from 'Poor spring land', because it has poor soil, containing much clay. This village contains many public services. These include two pubs, a supermarket, estate agents, takeaways, a restaurant and various shops. The church of Poringland All Saints is one of 124 existing round-tower churches in Norfolk. The village sign, which stands close to the church and the village pond, depicts the artist John Crome, founder of the Norwich School of artists, working on his famous painting 'The Poringland Oak'. Cromes Oak Close in the village is named after the artist. Many of Crome's paintings are available to view at the Norwich Castle Museum. The original of the Poringland Oak hangs in Room 7 at Tate Britain. The village of Framingham Earl which borders Poringland, contains the local High School. The River Chet (Norfolk) rises in Poringland. The German writer W.G. Sebald lived in Poringland until his death in a car crash in 2001.

He played eight seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 2004 and 2013 for the Atlanta Braves, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, Toronto Blue Jays, and Miami Marlins. He played in the International Baseball League of Australia before his MLB debut in 2004.Flintoff and Dunn Alamanac Since 2015, he has worked as an analyst on the Braves Live! post-game show, which follows Atlanta Braves games on Fox Sports South and Fox Sports Southeast. Career Green attended Duluth High School in Duluth, Georgia, and Georgia Perimeter College. =Atlanta Braves= The Atlanta Braves selected Green in the 32nd round of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft. After spending four and a half seasons in the minors, he made his Major League debut on May 15, against the Milwaukee Brewers. His first hit came in his third at-bat of the game, in the top of the fifth inning against Brooks Kieschnick, which was an RBI single to center. He batted .273 with the Braves. On July 2, 2004, Green hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 12th inning to lead the Braves to victory over the Boston Red Sox. He played in two games for the Braves in the 2004 National League Division Series, but had no at-bats. =Tampa Bay Devil Rays= Prior to the season, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays received Green in a trade with the Braves in return for right-handed pitcher Jorge Sosa. He batted .239 in 111 games for the Devil Rays in 2005, and then after appearing in only 17 games with them in 2006, he was designated for assignment on May 17. Green with the New York Yankees. =New York Yankees= On May 24, 2006, the New York Yankees acquired him for cash considerations. They assigned him to their Triple-A squad, the Columbus Clippers. On July 2, , Green made his first start for the Yankees, at second base. He contributed at the plate and in the field, hitting his first Yankee home run and throwing out a runner at the plate on a strong relay throw. He elected to become a free agent on October 17, 2006. =Seattle Mariners= After starting the season with the Pittsburgh Pirates organization in 2007, Green was traded to the Seattle Mariners on June 20, , and assigned to their Triple-A affiliate, the Tacoma Rainiers. On September 4, Green was called up to the Major League club. He appeared in six games for the Mariners and had seven at-bats, without recording a hit. =Boston Red Sox= After spending the 2008 season back in the Yankees minor league system, he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Boston Red Sox, and won a spot on the opening day roster. After teammates Julio Lugo and Jed Lowrie were both placed on the disabled list early in the season, Green became the Red Sox's starting shortstop. After Lugo returned from the DL, he and Green were on a day-to-day playing rotation. On June 21, 2009, Green hit a first pitch walk-off home run to lead the Boston Red Sox to a 6-5 victory over the Braves. Green's only other career walk-off home run was coincidentally against the Red Sox while he was playing for the Braves. On August 27, 2009, Green made his Major League pitching debut against the Chicago White Sox. After starter Junichi Tazawa struggled in early innings, Red Sox manager Terry Francona told Green that he would pitch the eighth inning. Green went into the dugout cages and pitched to outfielder Rocco Baldelli, who reported that Green had a full repertoire of pitches, including a two-seam fastball, and surprisingly enough a slider. Green was confused at first as to why he was pitching the eighth, and who would be pitching the ninth. With the Red Sox not scoring enough runs to warrant a new pitcher, Francona made the decision to have Green pitch in the ninth inning as well.Green pitches in for Red Sox bullpen During his two innings of scoreless relief, Green walked 3 batters and allowed no hits and no runs on 35 pitches. He topped out at 90 mph on his fastball. He also threw one slider in the game.http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2009/08/28/greens_fresh_arm_lends_a_hand/ \\"Green's fresh arm lends hand\\" (Boston Globe, Aug. 28, 2009) Green was the first Red Sox position player to go at least two innings of relief and not give up a hit since 1944. Green was also the first Red Sox position player to pitch multiple innings in a game since David McCarty did it in 2004. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On January 11, 2010, Green signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. On April 4, 2010, he was the last man cut from the Major League roster out of spring training, and accepted his assignment to the Albuquerque Isotopes, the Dodgers' Triple-A franchise. He was promoted to the Dodgers on May 4, when Rafael Furcal was placed on the disabled list. On May 28, he was designated for assignment, and returned to the Isotopes. He was released by the Dodgers on June 16. =Toronto Blue Jays= On June 18, 2010, he signed a major league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. Mike McCoy was sent down to make room for him. On July 17, 2010, he was designated for assignment to make room for pitcher Shaun Marcum, and refused minor league assignment, electing to be a free agent. =San Diego Padres= On July 23, 2010, Green signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres. He played in 40 games for the Triple-A Portland Beavers, batting .264. =Baltimore Orioles= On December 10, 2010, Green was widely reported to have signed a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training with the Baltimore Orioles. However, subsequent reports clarified that he and the team had never reached a formal agreement. On January 28, 2011, he did formally agree to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. =Texas Rangers= On July 19, 2011, Green, along with cash, was traded to the Texas Rangers for minor league pitcher Zachary Phillips. =Miami Marlins= On December 13, 2011, Green signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins, with an invitation to spring training. He spent the bulk of the season with the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs before getting called up on Aug. 4, 2012 when Emilio Bonifacio was placed on the DL with a sprained left thumb. However, after going 3-for-21 in six games, Green sprained his left thumb as well and was placed on the disabled list on Aug. 16, 2012. He was outrighted off the Marlins' roster on Oct. 17, 2012, and elected free agency. Green signed a minor league contract on January 15, 2013, with an invitation to spring training.http://joefrisaro.mlblogs.com/2013/01/15/green-agrees-to- minor-league-deal/ He started the season with the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs. His contract was selected by the Marlins on April 18 when Adeiny Hechavarria was placed on the disabled list. He was designated for assignment on May 2, and assigned outright to the Zephyrs on May 5.

In general, the mixing may be constrained to occur under various prescribed conditions. In the customarily prescribed conditions, the materials are each initially at a common temperature and pressure, and the new system may change its volume, while being maintained at that same constant temperature, pressure, and chemical component masses. The volume available for each material to explore is increased, from that of its initially separate compartment, to the total common final volume. The final volume need not be the sum of the initially separate volumes, so that work can be done on or by the new closed system during the process of mixing, as well as heat being transferred to or from the surroundings, because of the maintenance of constant pressure and temperature. The internal energy of the new closed system is equal to the sum of the internal energies of the initially separate systems. The reference values for the internal energies should be specified in a way that is constrained to make this so, maintaining also that the internal energies are respectively proportional to the masses of the systems.Prigogine, I. (1955/1967). Introduction to Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, third edition, Interscience Publishers, New York, p. 12. For concision in this article, the term 'ideal material' is used to refer to either an ideal gas (mixture) or an ideal solution. In the special case of mixing ideal materials, the final common volume is in fact the sum of the initial separate compartment volumes. There is no heat transfer and no work is done. The entropy of mixing is entirely accounted for by the diffusive expansion of each material into a final volume not initially accessible to it. In the general case of mixing non-ideal materials, however, the total final common volume may be different from the sum of the separate initial volumes, and there may occur transfer of work or heat, to or from the surroundings; also there may be a departure of the entropy of mixing from that of the corresponding ideal case. That departure is the main reason for interest in entropy of mixing. These energy and entropy variables and their temperature dependences provide valuable information about the properties of the materials. On a molecular level, the entropy of mixing is of interest because it is a macroscopic variable that provides information about constitutive molecular properties. In ideal materials, intermolecular forces are the same between every pair of molecular kinds, so that a molecule feels no difference between other molecules of its own kind and of those of the other kind. In non-ideal materials, there may be differences of intermolecular forces or specific molecular effects between different species, even though they are chemically non-reacting. The entropy of mixing provides information about constitutive differences of intermolecular forces or specific molecular effects in the materials. The statistical concept of randomness is used for statistical mechanical explanation of the entropy of mixing. Mixing of ideal materials is regarded as random at a molecular level, and, correspondingly, mixing of non-ideal materials may be non-random. Mixing of ideal species at constant temperature and pressure In ideal species, intermolecular forces are the same between every pair of molecular kinds, so that a molecule \\"feels\\" no difference between itself and its molecular neighbors. This is the reference case for examining corresponding mixing of non-ideal species. For example, two ideal gases, at the same temperature and pressure, are initially separated by a dividing partition. Upon removal of the dividing partition, they expand into a final common volume (the sum of the two initial volumes), and the entropy of mixing \\\\Delta_{mix}S\\\\, is given by :\\\\Delta_{mix} S = -nR(x_1\\\\ln x_1 + x_2\\\\ln x_2)\\\\,. where R\\\\, is the gas constant, n\\\\, the total number of moles and x_i\\\\, the mole fraction of component i\\\\,, which initially occupies volume V_i = x_iV\\\\,. After the removal of the partition, the n_i = nx_i\\\\, moles of component i\\\\, may explore the combined volume V\\\\,, which causes an entropy increase equal to nx_i R \\\\ln(V/V_i) = - nR x_i \\\\ln x_i\\\\, for each component gas. In this case, the increase in entropy is entirely due to the irreversible processes of expansion of the two gases, and involves no heat or work flow between the system and its surroundings. =Gibbs free energy of mixing= The Gibbs free energy change \\\\Delta_{mix} G = \\\\Delta_{mix} H - T\\\\Delta_{mix} S\\\\, determines whether mixing at constant (absolute) temperature \\\\ T and pressure \\\\ p is a spontaneous process. This quantity combines two physical effects‚Äîthe enthalpy of mixing, which is a measure of the energy change, and the entropy of mixing considered here. For an ideal gas mixture or an ideal solution, there is no enthalpy of mixing (\\\\Delta_{mix} H \\\\,), so that the Gibbs free energy of mixing is given by the entropy term only: :\\\\Delta_{mix} G = - T\\\\Delta_{mix} S\\\\, For an ideal solution, the Gibbs free energy of mixing is always negative, meaning that mixing of ideal solutions is always spontaneous. The lowest value is when the mole fraction is 0.5 for a mixture of two components, or 1/n for a mixture of n components. The entropy of mixing for an ideal solution of two species is maximized when the mole fraction of each species is 0.5. Solutions and temperature dependence of miscibility =Ideal and regular solutions= The above equation for the entropy of mixing of ideal gases is valid also for certain liquid (or solid) solutions‚Äîthose formed by completely random mixing so that the components move independently in the total volume. Such random mixing of solutions occurs if the interaction energies between unlike molecules are similar to the average interaction energies between like molecules.Atkins & de Paula (2006), page 149.K. Denbigh, \\"The Principles of Chemical Equilibrium\\" (3rd ed., Cambridge University Press 1971) p.432 The value of the entropy corresponds exactly to random mixing for ideal solutions and for regular solutions, and approximately so for many real solutions.P.A. Rock \\"Chemical Thermodynamics. Principles and Applications.(MacMillan 1969) p.263 For binary mixtures the entropy of random mixing can be considered as a function of the mole fraction of one component. :\\\\Delta_{mix} S = -nR(x_1\\\\ln x_1 + x_2\\\\ln x_2) = -nR[x\\\\ln x + (1-x) \\\\ln (1-x)]\\\\, For all possible mixtures, 0 < x < 1, so that \\\\ln x and \\\\ln (1-x) are both negative and the entropy of mixing \\\\Delta_{mix} S\\\\, is positive and favors mixing of the pure components. Also the curvature of \\\\Delta_{mix} S\\\\, as a function of x is given by the second derivative \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\Delta_{mix} S}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\right)_{T,P} = -nR\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{x} +\\\\frac{1}{1-x} \\\\right) This curvature is negative for all possible mixtures (0 < x < 1), so that mixing two solutions to form a solution of intermediate composition also increases the entropy of the system. Random mixing therefore always favors miscibility and opposes phase separation. For ideal solutions, the enthalpy of mixing is zero so that the components are miscible in all proportions. For regular solutions a positive enthalpy of mixing may cause incomplete miscibility (phase separation for some compositions) at temperatures below the upper critical solution temperature (UCST).Atkins & de Paula (2006), page 186. This is the minimum temperature at which the -T \\\\Delta_{mix} S\\\\, term in the Gibbs energy of mixing is sufficient to produce miscibility in all proportions. =Systems with a lower critical solution temperature= Nonrandom mixing with a lower entropy of mixing can occur when the attractive interactions between unlike molecules are significantly stronger (or weaker) than the mean interactions between like molecules. For some systems this can lead to a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) or lower limiting temperature for phase separation. For example, triethylamine and water are miscible in all proportions below 19 ¬∞C, but above this critical temperature, solutions of certain compositions separate into two phases at equilibrium with each other.Atkins & de Paula (2006), page 187.M.A. White, \\"Properties of Materials\\" (Oxford University Press 1999) p.175 This means that \\\\Delta_{mix} G\\\\, is negative for mixing of the two phases below 19 ¬∞C and positive above this temperature. Therefore, \\\\Delta_{mix} S = -\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Delta_{mix} G}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P is negative for mixing of these two equilibrium phases. This is due to the formation of attractive hydrogen bonds between the two components that prevent random mixing. Triethylamine molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds with each other but only with water molecules, so in solution they remain associated to water molecules with loss of entropy. The mixing that occurs below 19 ¬∞C is due not to entropy but to the enthalpy of formation of the hydrogen bonds. Lower critical solution temperatures also occur in many polymer-solvent mixtures.Cowie, J.M.G. \\"Polymers: Chemistry and Physics of Modern Materials\\" (2nd edn, Blackie 1991) p.174-176 For polar systems such as polyacrylic acid in 1,4-dioxane, this is often due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between polymer and solvent. For nonpolar systems such as polystyrene in cyclohexane, phase separation has been observed in sealed tubes (at high pressure) at temperatures approaching the liquid-vapor critical point of the solvent. At such temperatures the solvent expands much more rapidly than the polymer, whose segments are covalently linked. Mixing therefore requires contraction of the solvent for compatibility of the polymer, resulting in a loss of entropy. Statistical thermodynamical explanation of the entropy of mixing of ideal gases Since thermodynamic entropy can be related to statistical mechanics or to information theory, it is possible to calculate the entropy of mixing using these two approaches. Here we consider the simple case of mixing ideal gases. =Proof from statistical mechanics= Assume that the molecules of two different substances are approximately the same size, and regard space as subdivided into a square lattice whose cells are the size of the molecules. (In fact, any lattice would do, including close packing.) This is a crystal- like conceptual model to identify the molecular centers of mass. If the two phases are liquids, there is no spatial uncertainty in each one individually. (This is, of course, an approximation. Liquids have a \\"free volume\\". This is why they are (usually) less dense than solids.) Everywhere we look in component 1, there is a molecule present, and likewise for component 2. After the two different substances are intermingled (assuming they are miscible), the liquid is still dense with molecules, but now there is uncertainty about what kind of molecule is in which location. Of course, any idea of identifying molecules in given locations is a thought experiment, not something one could do, but the calculation of the uncertainty is well-defined. We can use Boltzmann's equation for the entropy change as applied to the mixing process :\\\\Delta_{mix} S= k_B \\\\ln\\\\Omega\\\\, where k_B \\\\, is Boltzmann's constant. We then calculate the number of ways \\\\Omega \\\\, of arranging N_1\\\\, molecules of component 1 and N_2\\\\, molecules of component 2 on a lattice, where :N = N_1 + N_2 \\\\, is the total number of molecules, and therefore the number of lattice sites. Calculating the number of permutations of N\\\\, objects, correcting for the fact that N_1\\\\, of them are identical to one another, and likewise for N_2\\\\,, :\\\\Omega = N!/N_1!N_2!\\\\, After applying Stirling's approximation for the factorial of a large integer m: :\\\\ln m! = \\\\sum_k \\\\ln k \\\\approx \\\\int_{1}^{m}dk \\\\ln k = m\\\\ln m - m + 1 \\\\approx m\\\\ln m - m, the result is \\\\Delta_{mix} S = -k_B[N_1\\\\ln(N_1/N) + N_2\\\\ln(N_2/N)] = -k_B N[x_1\\\\ln x_1 + x_2\\\\ln x_2]\\\\, where we have introduced the mole fractions, which are also the probabilities of finding any particular component in a given lattice site. ::x_1 = N_1/N = p_1 \\\\;\\\\;\\\\text{and} \\\\;\\\\;x_2 = N_2/N = p_2\\\\, Since the Boltzmann constant k_B = R / N_A\\\\,, where N_A\\\\, is Avogadro's number, and the number of molecules N = nN_A\\\\,, we recover the thermodynamic expression for the mixing of two ideal gases, \\\\Delta_{mix} S = -nR[x_1\\\\ln x_1 + x_2\\\\ln x_2]\\\\, This expression can be generalized to a mixture of r\\\\, components, N_i\\\\,, with i = 1, 2, 3,\\\\ldots, r\\\\, : \\\\Delta_{mix} S =-k_B\\\\sum_{i=1}^r N_i\\\\ln(N_i/N) = -N k_B\\\\sum_{i=1}^r x_i\\\\ln x_i = -n R\\\\sum_{i=1}^r x_i\\\\ln x_i\\\\,\\\\\\\\! =Relationship to information theory= The entropy of mixing is also proportional to the Shannon entropy or compositional uncertainty of information theory, which is defined without requiring Stirling's approximation. Claude Shannon introduced this expression for use in information theory, but similar formulas can be found as far back as the work of Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs. The Shannon uncertainty is not the same as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics which is based on variance. The Shannon entropy is defined as: : H = - \\\\sum_{i=1}^r p_i \\\\ln (p_i) where pi is the probability that an information source will produce the i th symbol from an r-symbol alphabet and is independent of previous symbols. (thus i runs from 1 to r ). H is then a measure of the expected amount of information (log pi ) missing before the symbol is known or measured, or, alternatively, the expected amount of information supplied when the symbol becomes known. The set of messages of length N symbols from the source will then have an entropy of N*H. The thermodynamic entropy is only due to positional uncertainty, so we may take the \\"alphabet\\" to be any of the r different species in the gas, and, at equilibrium, the probability that a given particle is of type i is simply the mole fraction xi for that particle. Since we are dealing with ideal gases, the identity of nearby particles is irrelevant. Multiplying by the number of particles N yields the change in entropy of the entire system from the unmixed case in which all of the pi were either 1 or 0. We again obtain the entropy of mixing on multiplying by the Boltzmann constant k_B\\\\,. : \\\\Delta_{mix} S = -N k_B\\\\sum_{i=1}^r x_i\\\\ln x_i \\\\,\\\\\\\\! So thermodynamic entropy with \\"r\\" chemical species with a total of N particles has a parallel to an information source that has \\"r\\" distinct symbols with messages that are N symbols long. =Application to gases= In gases there is a lot more spatial uncertainty because most of their volume is merely empty space. We can regard the mixing process as allowing the contents of the two originally separate contents to expand into the combined volume of the two conjoined containers. The two lattices that allow us to conceptually localize molecular centers of mass also join. The total number of empty cells is the sum of the numbers of empty cells in the two components prior to mixing. Consequently, that part of the spatial uncertainty concerning whether any molecule is present in a lattice cell is the sum of the initial values, and does not increase upon \\"mixing\\". Almost everywhere we look, we find empty lattice cells. Nevertheless, we do find molecules in a few occupied cells. When there is real mixing, for each of those few occupied cells, there is a contingent uncertainty about which kind of molecule it is. When there is no real mixing because the two substances are identical, there is no uncertainty about which kind of molecule it is. Using conditional probabilities, it turns out that the analytical problem for the small subset of occupied cells is exactly the same as for mixed liquids, and the increase in the entropy, or spatial uncertainty, has exactly the same form as obtained previously. Obviously the subset of occupied cells is not the same at different times. But only when there is real mixing and an occupied cell is found do we ask which kind of molecule is there. See also: Gibbs paradox, in which it would seem that \\"mixing\\" two samples of the same gas would produce entropy. =Application to solutions= If the solute is a crystalline solid, the argument is much the same. A crystal has no spatial uncertainty at all, except for crystallographic defects, and a (perfect) crystal allows us to localize the molecules using the crystal symmetry group. The fact that volumes do not add when dissolving a solid in a liquid is not important for condensed phases. If the solute is not crystalline, we can still use a spatial lattice, as good an approximation for an amorphous solid as it is for a liquid. The Flory‚ÄìHuggins solution theory provides the entropy of mixing for polymer solutions, in which the macromolecules are huge compared to the solvent molecules. In this case, the assumption is made that each monomer subunit in the polymer chain occupies a lattice site. Note that solids in contact with each other also slowly interdiffuse, and solid mixtures of two or more components may be made at will (alloys, semiconductors, etc.). Again, the same equations for the entropy of mixing apply, but only for homogeneous, uniform phases. Mixing under other constraints =Mixing with and without change of available volume= In the established customary usage, expressed in the lead section of this article, the entropy of mixing comes from two mechanisms, the intermingling and possible interactions of the distinct molecular species, and the change in the volume available for each molecular species, or the change in concentration of each molecular species. For ideal gases, the entropy of mixing at prescribed common temperature and pressure has nothing to do with mixing in the sense of intermingling and interactions of molecular species, but is only to do with expansion into the common volume.Bailyn (1994), page 273. According to Fowler and Guggenheim (1939/1965),Fowler, R., Guggenheim, E.A. (1939/1965). Statistical Thermodynamics. A version of Statistical Mechanics for Students of Physics and Chemistry, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, pages 163-164 the conflating of the just- mentioned two mechanisms for the entropy of mixing is well established in customary terminology, but can be confusing unless it is borne in mind that the independent variables are the common initial and final temperature and total pressure; if the respective partial pressures or the total volume are chosen as independent variables instead of the total pressure, the description is different. Mixing with each gas kept at constant partial volume, with changing total volume In contrast to the established customary usage, \\"mixing\\" might be conducted reversibly at constant volume for each of two fixed masses of gases of equal volume, being mixed by gradually merging their initially separate volumes by use of two ideal semipermeable membranes, each permeable only to one of the respective gases, so that the respective volumes available to each gas remain constant during the merge. Either one of the common temperature or the common pressure is chosen to be independently controlled by the experimenter, the other being allowed to vary so as to maintain constant volume for each mass of gas. In this kind of \\"mixing\\", the final common volume is equal to each of the respective separate initial volumes, and each gas finally occupies the same volume as it did initially.Planck, M. (1897/1903). Treatise on Thermodynamics, translated with the author's sanction by Alexander Ogg, Longmans, Green and Co., London, Sections 235-236.Partington, J.R. (1949), pp. 163‚Äì164.Adkins (1968/1983), page 217.Callen, H.B. (1960/1985). Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics, second edition, Wiley, New York, , pages 69-70.Buchdahl, H.A. (1966). The Concepts of Classical Thermodynamics, Cambridge University Press, London, pages 170-171.Iribarne, J.V., Godson, W.L. (1973/1981), Atmospheric Thermodynamics, second edition, D. Reidel, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, , pages 48-49. This constant volume kind of \\"mixing\\", in the special case of perfect gases, is referred to in what is sometimes called Gibbs' theorem. It states that the entropy of such \\"mixing\\" of perfect gases is zero. Mixing at constant total volume and changing partial volumes, with mechanically controlled varying pressure, and constant temperature An experimental demonstration may be considered. The two distinct gases, in a cylinder of constant total volume, are at first separated by two contiguous pistons made respectively of two suitably specific ideal semipermeable membranes. Ideally slowly and fictively reversibly, at constant temperature, the gases are allowed to mix in the volume between the separating membranes, forcing them apart, thereby supplying work to an external system. The energy for the work comes from the heat reservoir that keeps the temperature constant. Then, by externally forcing ideally slowly the separating membranes together, back to contiguity, work is done on the mixed gases, fictively reversibly separating them again, so that heat is returned to the heat reservoir at constant temperature. Because the mixing and separation are ideally slow and fictively reversible, the work supplied by the gases as they mix is equal to the work done in separating them again. Passing from fictive reversibility to physical reality, some amount of additional work, that remains external to the gases and the heat reservoir, must be provided from an external source for this cycle, as required by the second law of thermodynamics, because this cycle has only one heat reservoir at constant temperature, and the external provision of work cannot be completely efficient. Gibbs' paradox: \\"mixing\\" of identical species versus mixing of closely similar but non-identical species For entropy of mixing to exist, the putatively mixing molecular species must be chemically or physically detectably distinct. Thus arises the so-called Gibbs paradox, as follows. If molecular species are identical, there is no entropy change on mixing them, because, defined in thermodynamic terms, there is no mass transfer, and thus no thermodynamically recognized process of mixing. Yet the slightest detectable difference in constitutive properties between the two species yields a thermodynamically recognized process of transfer with mixing, and a possibly considerable entropy change, namely the entropy of mixing. The \\"paradox\\" arises because any detectable constitutive distinction, no matter how slight, can lead to a considerably large change in amount of entropy as a result of mixing. Though a continuous change in the properties of the materials that are mixed might make the degree of constitutive difference tend continuously to zero, the entropy change would nonetheless vanish discontinuously when the difference reached zero.ter Haar & Wergeland (1966), p. 87. From a general physical viewpoint, this discontinuity is paradoxical. But from a specifically thermodynamic viewpoint, it is not paradoxical, because in that discipline the degree of constitutive difference is not questioned; it is either there or not there. Gibbs himself did not see it as paradoxical. Distinguishability of two materials is a constitutive, not a thermodynamic, difference, for the laws of thermodynamics are the same for every material, while their constitutive characteristics are diverse.Truesdell, C. (1969). Rational Thermodynamics: a Course of Lectures on Selected Topics, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, p. 6. Though one might imagine a continuous decrease of the constitutive difference between any two chemical substances, physically it cannot be continuously decreased till it actually vanishes.Partington, J.R. (1949), p. 164, who cites Larmor, J. (1929), Mathematical and Physical Papers, volume 2, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, p. 99. It is hard to think of a smaller difference than that between ortho- and para-hydrogen. Yet they differ by a finite amount. The hypothesis, that the distinction might tend continuously to zero, is unphysical. This is neither examined nor explained by thermodynamics. Differences of constitution are explained by quantum mechanics, which postulates discontinuity of physical processes.Land√©, A. (1955). Foundations of Quantum Mechanics: a Study in Continuity and Symmetry, Yale University Press, New Haven, p.10. For a detectable distinction, some means should be physically available. One theoretical means would be through an ideal semi- permeable membrane. It should allow passage, backwards and forwards, of one species, while passage of the other is prevented entirely. The entirety of prevention should include perfect efficacy over a practically infinite time, in view of the nature of thermodynamic equilibrium. Even the slightest departure from ideality, as assessed over a finite time, would extend to utter non-ideality, as assessed over a practically infinite time. Such quantum phenomena as tunneling ensure that nature does not allow such membrane ideality as would support the theoretically demanded continuous decrease, to zero, of detectable distinction. The decrease to zero detectable distinction must be discontinuous. For ideal gases, the entropy of mixing does not depend on the degree of difference between the distinct molecular species, but only on the fact that they are distinct; for non-ideal gases, the entropy of mixing can depend on the degree of difference of the distinct molecular species. The suggested or putative \\"mixing\\" of identical molecular species is not in thermodynamic terms a mixing at all, because thermodynamics refers to states specified by state variables, and does not permit an imaginary labelling of particles. Only if the molecular species are different is there mixing in the thermodynamic sense.Tolman, R.C. (1938).

The Latin inscription reminds the canons to remember the poor before they sat at down to eat The builder of the abbey was Bishop Peter des Roches of Winchester, a powerful politician, churchman and government official who founded several religious houses, including Netley Abbey (1236), also in Hampshire, Halesowen Abbey (1214) in Worcestershire and La Clart√©-Dieu (1236) in his native France. In 1222 the first inhabitants of the new monastery, under the leadership of Abbot Richard, arrived from Halesowen Abbey. They were not monks, instead they were canons regular belonging to the Premonstratensian order (also known as the 'white canons' from the colour of their robes and Norbertines from the name of their founder, St. Norbert). They lived communally, following a very strict interpretation of the Rule of St Augustine, but in addition to engaging in a life of study and prayer within their abbeys, they also had a pastoral mission and served as parish priests ministering to the spiritual needs of the laity. The order was well known for the austerity of the lives led by its members, something that made it ‚Äî as with the Cistercians ‚Äî especially popular with wealthy benefactors in the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries. Bishop Peter held one of the richest bishoprics in the mediaeval church and so was in a position to be generous in the endowment of his new abbey. He not only gave the manor of Titchfield itself but also extensive lands dotted around Hampshire, and this property was expanded by major grants from local aristocrats and King Henry III (who also granted the monastery important legal privileges in 1231), with the result that Titchfield was placed on a firm financial footing from the beginning. Abbey buildings With stone hard to come by in the county of Hampshire, the abbey was built mainly using stone brought in from neighbouring Dorset, the Isle of Wight and even as far afield as Caen in France. The abbey buildings were centred around the church, which was comparatively small and lacking in grandeur. It was cruciform in plan with a narrow, aisle-less nave, a short eastern arm, six side chapels in the transepts and a tower with bells. It was in some ways a rather old fashioned design and deliberately austere, perhaps reflecting the strict doctrines of the order at the period of construction. Though it was restored once after nearly falling to ruin, unlike many of their fellows the canons of Titchfield never succumbed to the desire to create an elaborate new church in the later middle ages and kept their original building until the end of monastic life at the abbey. North of the church stood a cloister surrounded on three sides by the domestic buildings of the house, including the chapter house, dormitory, kitchen, refectory, library, food storage rooms and quarters for the abbot. Though not large, the surviving ruins show that the abbey buildings were of very high quality with fine masonry and carving. As the Middle Ages progressed considerable investment was made to upgrade the domestic buildings to meet rising living standards, and it is probable that by the mid fourteenth century they were rather luxurious, as evidenced by the elaborate polychrome floor tiles (an expensive and high status product) still seen today all over the site. The central core of the monastery was surrounded by a walled precinct containing gardens, fishponds (several of which still survive close to the abbey buildings), Accessed 9 July 2008 orchards, barns, guesthouses, stables, a farmyard and industrial buildings. Entrance to the abbey was strictly controlled by several gatehouses. Monastic history Wriothesley's gatehouse - a vital symbol of seigneurial power for an early 16th-century courtier's house, cuts through the nave of the Premonstratensian canons' church, seen left and right of the tower. The choir, transepts and altar - now lost - were on the right of the picture The internal affairs of the abbey seem to have been largely quiet. It was generally well run over its history and maintained a good reputation for the life led by its canons. As with other Premonstratensian houses, Titchfield Abbey was visited once a year by the father-abbot from the parent house (in this case Halesowen Abbey); or instead, in certain years, by a commission of the General Chapter of Pr√©montr√©, the headquarters of the Premonstratensian Order. The abbey remained tolerably solvent for most of its existence, however, in common with many religious houses and secular lords it experienced severe financial difficulties in the latter half of the 14th century and the early 15th century due to the economic and social crisis resulting from the effects of the Black Death. The scale of the disaster can be judged by the fact that on the Titchfield estates in the plague years of 1348-1349 close to 60% of the tenants died, together with a vast number of animals, and when the plague returned in 1361-1362 the agricultural population took another massive hit. When John Poole, abbot of the mother house of Halesowen Abbey inspected Titchfield in summer 1420 he found the coffers empty, the abbey's accounts deeply in the red and the barns and storehouses nearly empty of food and fodder. Despite this, in the following years the canons managed to retrieve the situation and in the last years of its existence Titchfield was again prosperous. Inspections by senior abbots of the order from 1478 to 1502 noted that Titchfield was excellently managed, discipline was good and the finances were in order. The abbey's location near Southampton and Portsmouth made it a convenient stopping place for journeys from England to continental Europe and it hence received many important visitors. Richard II and Queen Anne stayed at the abbey in 1393, and Henry V was a guest on his way to Southampton to invade France in 1415. On 23 April 1445, the abbey church was the venue for a royal wedding; the marriage of Henry VI to Margaret of Anjou was celebrated there by William Ayscough, Bishop of Salisbury. Library Thomas Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, who gained control of the abbey after the Dissolution and made it his home The Premonstratensians placed great emphasis on scholarship and the canons of Titchfield possessed a very impressive library, the catalogue for which survives.D.N.Bell (ed.), The Libraries of the Cistercians, Gilbertines and Premonstratensians (London, 1992), pp.180-254 There were 224 volumes, each containing a number of different works bound together, as was common in the period, and some must have been very large to contain all the works recorded for them. The books were systematically organised by subject, shelf and location in the library room (probably the chamber between the chapter house and the church as this was the traditional location). There were books in Latin, English and French covering theology, church history, writings of the Fathers of the Church, medicine, law, philosophy, grammar, travel, legends, romances and records of the abbey. The canons also had another collection of more than 100 books used for services that they kept in the church. A library on this scale was huge for the period and is surprising for a minor house like Titchfield. It compares closely, for instance, with the holdings of the great royal foundation of Reading Abbey which had 228 volumes. Dissolution Henry VIII dissolved the abbey in 1537. In 1535 the abbey's income was assessed in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's great survey of church finances, at ¬£280 gross, ¬£249 net, so it avoided being destroyed in the first round of suppressions in 1536. However, several important courtiers, especially Thomas Wriothesley, desired to seize the abbey for themselves and put great pressure on the abbot, John Salisbury, Suffragan Bishop of Thetford to surrender on terms before he was made to by force. Abbot John bribed Wriothesley heavily to hold off, but when it was obvious to them that their abbey was doomed he and his canons took steps to secure their personal future by realising the assets for cash, including selling off the abbey's livestock, treasures and church plate. Titchfield finally fell in December 1537. The abbot proved a tough negotiator in the surrender, securing 100 marks a year as a pension for himself and comfortable incomes for his eight canons and three novices. Despite this, Abbot John remained in government favour, being made Dean of Norwich Cathedral in 1539, and later Bishop of Sodor and Man. He died in 1573. Place House After the Dissolution the abbey was converted into a Tudor mansion called Place House. This view shows it as it looked in 1733. Wriothesley won the battle to gain control of Titchfield and immediately began work to turn it into a mansion for himself, to be known as Place House. Within days of the departure of the canons the commissioners who had taken the surrender of Titchfield sent a report to Wriothesley detailing the state of his new property: The royal commissioners went on to note that the cost of converting the abbey into a house would be on the order of ¬£200, but the charges on the estate from paying the pensions of the canons and the abbot would be ¬£120 yearly. They recommended that the east end of the church and the tower be demolished during the conversion. Eleven days after the surrender of the abbey a consortium of local men led by a Mr Shelonde contracted to buy marble, altars, sculpture and other fittings from the church. It is also recorded that the tiled floors of the church were taken up and sold, however, only 10% of them were worth saving. Despite this selling-off of materials from the former abbey buildings, the bare stones left behind were vital building blocks for the new house, and Wriothesley supplemented this valuable resource with fresh Caen stone.St. John W H Hope, Making of Palace House 1538, Archaeological Journal, 1906 Vol. LXIII, pp. 235-240 In contrast to the parlous state of the abbey buildings, the commissioners remarked upon the impressive series of four fishponds to the north-west of the property. These measured \\"a mile in length to ford and harbour\\" and contained an estimated 100,000 \\"carpes, tenches, breams and pike.\\" Unlike his similar project at Beaulieu Abbey, which he had also been granted by King Henry, Wriothesley chose to convert the main abbey buildings, including the church, into his house. It was an imaginative scheme, built under the direction of master mason Thomas Bartewe, a prominent contractor for King Henry's contemporary fortification works along the South Coast. He constructed a spectacular castellated gatehouse with four octagonal turrets which was forced through the middle of the nave to provide the appropriate seigneurial emphasis needed for a classic Tudor courtyard house. The cloister became the central courtyard of the house (a magnificent fountain was placed in the middle), the old refectory, with the addition of a grand porch, became the great hall, while the rest of the abbey was turned into fine apartments for the family. The church tower was initially kept as part of the house but it was soon demolished on the advice of John Crayford, one of the king's commissioners who helped to oversee the reconstruction on behalf of Wriothesley. Crayford was anxious to see the tower pulled down as, if it was left standing, the chimneys would have to be raised some twenty feet higher - and at great cost - to avoid defacing the church tower with their smoke. Other features of the mansion included a private indoor theatre and a deer park. The resulting palatial dwelling attracted favourable notice from Wriothesley's contemporaries: in 1540, the traveller and historian John Leland noted in his Intinerary, Place House was considered sufficiently \\"embatelid\\" that it was regarded as a castle or fortified house, the building of which officially required a royal licence to fortify, something which Wriothesley neglected to secure. He obtained a pardon for this oversight in 1542. As the home of an important noble, the new mansion continued to play host to important guests. Wriothesley's son, the second Earl of Southampton entertained both Edward VI and his sister Elizabeth I. Under the fourth Earl, Titchfield was host to Charles I twice, once in 1625 in company with Queen Henrietta Maria, the second time in November 1647 when the king was on the run from Parliamentary forces after having escaped from the Isle of Wight. Charles II visited the next owner of the house, Edward, Earl of Gainsborough in 1675. From the Earls of Gainsborough Titchfield passed to the Dukes of Beaufort who lived at Place House until 1741, at which point the estate was sold to the Delme family. They lived there for another forty years until, in 1781, a decision was made to abandon the mansion and deliberately demolish much of it to create a romantic ruin. When this happened local people took stone from the abbey for their homes; evidence can be seen in walls and foundations of older houses in Titchfield village. Much, though, is inside the buildings; in The Bugle Hotel in Titchfield, for example, a big fireplace was salvaged from the ruins. Accessed 10 July 2008 Present day Though a great deal has been destroyed, there are still major remains of the abbey and Place House to be seen. In fact, the pulling down of Place House has revealed more of the abbey than would otherwise be visible. The nave of the church still stands to full height and with it Wriothesley's gatehouse. To the east of the gatehouse ruins, the barest outline of the former church can be seen, including the choir and transepts. Fragments of the cloister buildings survive, including the entrance arches to the chapter house and library in the east range. In the abbey's grounds, the fishponds have been maintained and are used regularly for fishing. In addition, to the west of the abbey, and outside of the wall ringing the English Heritage site, there is a fragment of an outlying abbey building, the use of which is not recorded. Substantial stretches of the late mediaeval tile floors survive to this day. An inscription which used to lie before the entrance to the canons' refectory, was later covered and preserved beneath the steps leading up to Wriothesley's banqueting hall. Two other patches of tiling survive to the north of the gatehouse. Following the expulsion of the canons, these were concealed beneath the spiral staircases installed in Wriothesley's reconstruction, and therefore escaped being torn out with the rest of the tiles along the cloister walk.P.M. Green and A.R. Green, Mediaeval Tiles at Titchfield Abbey, Hants., Afterwards Place of Palace House, Papers and Proceedings of the Hampshire Field Club & Archaeological Society, vol. 17 (1949). In winter, the tiles are covered over with sand by English Heritage staff in order to protect them from damage in the cold weather. The abbey has been the setting for concerts, including folk and blues festivals and open-air theatre and is now under the care of English Heritage. It is open to the public.

Originally the company was formed in order to publish computer magazines and books. Following the decline of the computer magazine market, the company expanded to publish fantasy and science fiction, comic books and graphic novels, manga and children's magazines. Computer magazines Compupress published the first Greek computer magazine: Computers For All (') - which celebrated its 300th issue in August 2009. In the past the magazine has licensed material from the well-known British magazines Personal Computer World, PC Plus and PC Answers. Having already migrated as an e-magazine to the iPad as well as the Adobe Digital Editions platforms in 2012, the magazine published its final paper issue (#344) in May 2013. The company also published Pixel, a Greek language home computing magazine during the era of the 8/16-bit micros (Sinclair ZX81, ZX Spectrum, VIC-20, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Amiga etc.). Pixel was one of the few Greek magazines to have a whole section dedicated to type- in programs. Pixel helped initiate a large number of young Greeks to the computer revolution of the 1980s. In September 1989, Compupress launched PC Master - similar to Pixel but with a focus on IBM Compatible computing. In 2007, the company launched Update an annual Business Software Guide aimed at the professional. Computer Fairs During the 1980s and 90s, the company organised a number of Consumer Fairs and Trade Shows related to computer technology. Among the various shows the company organised through the 1980s and 1990s, most prominent were the following: * The Computer Show * The DeskTop Publishing Show * The CAD/CAM Show * The Multimedia Show * The Internet Show Book Publishing Since the early 1980s, Compupress had sporadically published a number of computer books, however in 1991, the company decided to launch a branch dedicated solely to this function. Thus was Anubis Publishing formed. In addition to Greek translations of previously written books, Anubis also publishes original works. Anubis has published more than 200 computer books and has diversified into business book publishing. Since the 2000s, Anubis has been publishing translations of well-known science-fiction and fantasy books. Television In 1991, Compupress made a deal with ERT (Ellinik√≠ Radiofon√≠a Tile√≥rasi), the Greek National TV (at that time the only existing set of channels, given that there was still no private TV in Greece), through which it acquired the right to produce two 13-episode TV Shows promoting the use of computers and new technology. The first show, (Computers: Tools of the Year 2000) would deal with computers in the office and in everyday life while the second, (The Computer Show) would deal with computer games. Both shows would be fully financed by Compupress which would recuperate the costs by finding the required sponsors amongst the local computer companies. In 2008, celebrating 25 years of publishing \\"Computers For All\\", the magazine distributed videos of the two 17-year-old TV series on the covermounted DVD-ROM. CompuLink BBS and the Internet In 1992, Compupress launched CompuLink the largest Bulletin Board System in Greece. Initially CompuLink was just a large SCO UNIX-based BBS running CoSy (the same system used by the British CIX) The CompuLink team developed and/or purchased on-line services for target-groups relating to the various computer magazines the company was publishing. Amongst its services was a full-text searching facility for a large number of Greek magazines (apart from Compupress' own), a number of on-line games (most notably Air Warrior and Federation II), an online database with scientific and business news, online access to a daily newspaper custom-made according to each users' preferences etc. CompuLink was initially designed as an Athens-based system with approximately 100 local telephone lines and (for that time period) state-of-the-art modems at 2,400 - 9,600 baud. The BBS was successful enough to add local PoPs to other regions of Greece, and renamed itself the CompuLink Network. In April 1994, CompuLink Network became the first Greek commercial dial-up Internet provider. This area however proved to be extremely competitive as, in the following years, a number of major players (Otenet, FORTHnet etc.) entered the market. In 1999, Compupress decided to exit the Internet provider arena and sold CompuLink Network to a group of investors. A few years later the fledgling company declared bankruptcy. Digital Content In 2000, Compupress launched a new branch under the name of Digital Content (or DigiCon as it came to be known) in order to have an active presence in the area of web development and on-line services. Through this branch Compupress managed the web sites of its own magazines as well as a number of other web services. Amongst the services DigiCon developed and/or acquired were the following: * On-line games: The 4th Coming (T4C) * Auction sites: eBazaar * e-book publishing: e-bookshop * Content sites: GameWeb, CompuWeb Following the burst of the dot-com bubble, DigiCon became temporarily dormant, limiting its activity to the maintenance of the company's existing web sites. In 2008 Digital Content launched two new ad-driven content web sites: Pulp.gr, aiming at the pop-culture aficionado, and PCMaster.gr, a new and revamped site for the magazine's readers. In 2001, DigiCon launched e-bookshop.gr an e-book publishing site. Towards the end of 2015, following the folding of their last technology magazine, the company launched techzoom.gr soon to be followed by tour-market.gr, two sites dealing respectively in the technology and tourism industries. =Business and trade magazines= In the mid-eighties, the company created a branch named Business Press through which it published magazines in the business area. Amongst these most prominent were Information and Today‚Äôs Enterprise (), two publications that urged the Greek companies of that period to abandon older concepts and enter the informatics era. Both magazines did quite well for a few years but eventually folded during the early nineties. In 1989, Compupress published Touristiki Agora ('), a trade monthly in the area of the Greek tourism industry. Touristiki Agora currently publishes Meet In Greece which is the only English-language Conference Guide currently published in Greece. In 2001, the company launched Food Service, a trade monthly for the Food & Beverage market. =Science magazines= In the mid-nineties, Compupress launched Millennium a science monthly that licensed material from Discover magazine. It proved financially unviable and folded two years later. =Consumer technology magazines= In 2003, the company launched Digital Living, a monthly magazine licensing material from Future Publishing's Digital Home and Hi-Fi Choice and having a well known movie as a covermount DVD. Initially the magazine was successful, but in less than two years declining circulation forced it to fold. In November 2005, Compupress launched Mobile Magazine aimed at the mobile telephone users. By early 2006, the magazine had been incorporated as a supplement to Computers For All. In November 2005, the company also launched Play-On! a cross-console monthly for the video-games market which proved to be extremely short-lived. =Puzzle & crossword magazines= In the summer of 2005, Compupress launched the first Greek Sudoku puzzle magazine. Since then it has followed-up with a weekly, two biweeklies, as well as a couple of bimonthlies. In 2007, the company entered the local crossword magazine market launching the weekly Lytis (') which proved to be extremely short-lived. In 2010 Compupress returned to the cross-word market, launching a new weekly crossword magazine, a biweekly, three monthlies and three bimonthlies. =Military history magazines= In 2006, Compupress launched World Military History (') entering the -already crowded- Greek military history magazine arena. The initial success of the magazine created a series of special editions carrying DVDs concerning various military subjects. In 2008, responding to declining sales the magazine folded, however the thematic military \\"monographs\\" are still being published on a quasi-regular basis. =Fantasy and science fiction= During the late nineties, Anubis, the company‚Äôs book-publishing branch, turned to translating fantasy and science- fiction best-sellers in order to compensate for the declining computer-book sales figures. In the next few years the company gradually shifted its production from computer and business-related titles to fantasy and science- fiction. Amongst the authors that Anubis has introduced to the Greek public are Frank Herbert (Dune series), George R. R.

The deed in lieu of foreclosure offers several advantages to both the borrower and the lender. The principal advantage to the borrower is that it immediately releases him/her from most or all of the personal indebtedness associated with the defaulted loan. The borrower also avoids the public notoriety of a foreclosure proceeding and may receive more generous terms than he/she would in a formal foreclosure. Another benefit to the borrower is that it hurts his/her credit less than a foreclosure does. Advantages to a lender include a reduction in the time and cost of a repossession, lower risk of borrower revenge (metal theft and vandalism of the property before sheriff eviction), and additional advantages if the borrower subsequently files for bankruptcy. If there are any junior liens a deed in lieu is a less attractive option for the lender. The lender will likely not want to assume the liability of the junior liens from the property owner, and accordingly, the lender will prefer to foreclose in order to clean the title. In order to be considered a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the indebtedness must be secured by the real estate being transferred. Both sides must enter into the transaction voluntarily and in good faith. The settlement agreement must have total consideration that is at least equal to the fair market value of the property being conveyed. Sometimes, the lender will not proceed with a deed in lieu of foreclosure if the outstanding indebtedness of the borrower exceeds the current fair value of the property; in other cases, a lender will agree since it will likely end up with the property anyway through the costly foreclosure process. Because of the requirement that the instrument be voluntary, lenders will often not act upon a deed in lieu of foreclosure unless they receive a written offer of such a conveyance from the borrower that specifically states that the offer to enter into negotiations is being made voluntarily. This will enact the parol evidence rule and protect the lender from a possible subsequent claim that the lender acted in bad faith or pressured the borrower into the settlement. Both sides may then proceed with settlement negotiation. The Home Equity Theft Prevention Act in New York has created some confusion regarding this frequently-used method of settlement. It is unclear whether HETPA applies to deeds in lieu of foreclosure since there is no clear exclusion as there is for a referee's deed, for example. The 2-year right of rescission is not a risk that banks or title insurers are comfortable with, especially given the complexities of compliance, so many banks and title insurers in New York are not willing to work with deeds in lieu.

A native of Shkod√´r, he studied under Martin Gjoka and Zef Kurti, and he was also an alumnus of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. A virtuoso clarinetist he worked as a music teacher for most of his life and distinguished himself as the mentor of the four most important composers of classical music from northern Albania: √áesk Zadeja, Tish Daija, Tonin Harapi, and Simon Gjoni. Jakova was the director of the music band and of the House of Culture of Shkod√´r. Besides Mrika, Jakova also composed Sk√´nderbeu, another opera which premiered in 1968. Along the operas Jakova left to posterity many songs and other musical pieces, several of which are commonly believed to be Albanian folk music, rather they are Jakova's compositions. He was imprisoned by the Albanian communist regime for his brother's political opposition to it and was demanded to work more than he could bear. Despaired and stressed from the excessive demands on his work, he killed himself in 1969. His legacy is that of one of the most important Albanian composers of all times. Early life Prenk√´ Jakova was born on 27 June 1917 in Shkod√´r, northern Albania. His family's background was from Gjakova, from which originated the last name. His grandfather, Ded√´ Jakova, was a clarinetist at the Shkod√´r Jesuit College, whereas Prenk√´'s father, Kol√´ Ded√´ Jakova, was a commander in the Albanian army. Jakova went to elementary school in 1924‚Äì1929 and from there he pursued secondary studies in the Illyricum Lycee of his native city. When in high school, he switched from the classical concentration into the general gymnasium, which he finished in 1935. During his high school years he was part of the musical band of school and also, encouraged from his father, he started acting in the theatrical associations Bogdani and Vllaznia. Later, the school band became the city's band, and Jakova its clarinetist. During that period Jakova started to write musical motifs based on well known folk songs such as Delja rud√´ (), Hajredini (), Besa e nj√´ trimi (), and Shkoj e vi flutrim si zogu (). His two musical teachers were Martin Gjoka and Zef Kurti, probably the most important Albanian musicians of northern Albania at that time. Work At 18, Jakova was nominated artistic director of his school band and his first students were √áesk Zadeja, Tish Daija, Tonin Harapi, Simon Gjoni, Tonin Rrota, Zef Gruda, and many other famous Albanian composers. Jakova started to compose marches and other pieces. On 2 January 1936 he was sent to teach in B√´rdic√´ where he took care of the musical education of the children. There he learned to play the guitar. During the summer of 1939 he purchased an accordion and learned that too. At that point he was an advanced, sometimes virtuoso player of the clarinet, the guitar, and the accordion. In 1939 Jakova went to teach in Orosh, Mirdit√´ District, where he wrote a piece for accordion entitled \\"Mall\\" (), and later the song \\"Fyelli i Bariut\\" (), whose text is unknown to us today. This was the first song of Jakova whose text and music had been both composed by him, according to the tradition of the aheng from Shkod√´r (). In 1940 Jakova was transferred back to Shkod√´r where he started a cycle of songs for children and an operetta on two acts entitled \\"Kopshti i Xhuxhmaxhuxh√´ve\\" (). In the academic year 1941‚Äì42, Jakova was again transferred in Kat√´rkoll√´, a village close to Ulqin and Osho in the Kraj√´ region of Yugoslavia, to where he would commute with his bike from Shkod√´r, covering every day. In 1942 he went to study clarinet at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, Italy where he finished with excellent results. In 1944 Jakova was hired by the chorus of the First Partisan Brigade of the House of the Youth where he was named director. During this time he was arrested by the communist regime and held in prison because his brother had been an opponent of the regime, persecuted, and killed by the communists. His former alumni, √áesk Zadeja and Tonin Harapi witnessed that, once released from the prison, Jakova went back to work and started to go to work at 7 in the morning and go back home only by late night. The group gave performances not only in Shkod√´r but also in various cities of Yugoslavia, such as Ulqin, Cetinje, Titograd etc. In 1947, Jakova wrote a cycle of songs entitled \\"Dasma Shkodrane\\" (), with which he represented his city in a song festival in Tirana. During 1948‚Äì1951, Jakova worked as a music teacher in two schools of Shkod√´r and never quit for a single day practices of the chorus and the orchestra of the House of Culture of Shkod√´r. At that time he composed the song \\"Gruri i ri\\" () with a text of Dhimit√´r Shuteriqi, which was put on stage from Pjet√´r Gjoka along with other songs which were brought to the 1950 Festival in Tirana. At the beginning of the 1952 festival in Albania there were high quality soloists and good symphonic orchestras. In June 1952 poet Llazar Siliqi was put in charge to write a poetry on youth's work on a new hydroelectric power station, which was being built on the Mat river. The piece started as a song, but afterward it took a longer shape and was divided into two movements called Drit√´ mbi Shqip√´ri (), and was presented in 1952 in Tirana. The piece was nothing but the embryo of the first Albanian opera, Mrika, which was worked upon by Jakova in the following 6 years and eventually rehearsed on 2 May 1958, and put on stage on 12 November 1958. Rehearsing was done in the House of Culture, the Old Theatre and the new Migjeni Theatre in Shkod√´r. On 27 November the general rehearsal was given and on 1 December 1958 the opera premiered in the Migjeni Theatre, and after some performances in the city, on 27 and 28 December it showed in the theater of the Academy of Music and Arts of Albania, where Enver Hoxha, then Albania's premier, assisted it. At the end of the show Kadri Hazbiu, then Minister of Interior, thanked all the artists and raised a toast to Jakova. The event was considered important and Jakova received telegrams of congratulations from many of his peer composers all around the world for the success of his first opera. The extraordinary success of Mrika led to an encounter between Enver Hoxha and Jakova. Hoxha asked Jakova to write another opera, this time on Albanian national hero, Skanderbeg, but Jakova answered that \\"operas are not like loafs which can be put in the oven at any time\\". It is reported that Hoxha laughed at that response and that he immediately assured Jakova, that he personally would provide to all the necessary conditions to guarantee the opera's success. Sk√´nderbeu would indeed premiere 10 years after Mrika and was of a much better artistic quality then Mrika. Jakova worked very intensively on the music while at the same time he had other responsibilities as the director of the House of Culture and also teaching assignments. He spent several months only on the work of separating the Turkish music from the Arabic one, which was one of the elements of the opera, and many classical composers struggled with, because of the very distant relationship between classical music and oriental one. Wen Jakova finished the opera, he brought it to Tirana for an approval, but he was asked to review many parts of it. Jakova categorically refused to revise, eventually Fadil Pa√ßrami, then Minister of Culture, backed him up. Although Sk√´nderbeu was a great success, and Jakova was congratulated by Enver Hoxha, the vicissitudes of its realization had heavy consequences on Jakova's spirit. This occurred when Jakova's mother was paralyzed at home. The stress accumulated and the despair of a heavy life without recognition, brought him to attempt to kill himself on 9 September 1969, by throwing himself from the second floor of the House of Culture of Shkod√´r. He eventually died a few days later, on 16 September 1969 in a Tirana hospital, from the fatal wounds. The people of Shkod√´r, shocked and embittered for the great composer, organized an imposing funeral procession for Albania's greatest musician and composer of that time. The procession was unattended by public authorities, with the exception of the secretary of the Albanian League of Writers and Artists. The death ceremony was accompanied by the sounds of the musical band of the city of Shkod√´r, which Jakova himself had created. Legacy Jakova left a very important musical heritage. Beside the two operas there are dozens of songs, orchestral and choral pieces, movies' music, and operettas that he left to posterity. Jakova is considered as one of the most important Albanian composers of all times. He composed the operas Mrika in 1958 and Skanderberg in 1968, for which he is known as the creator of the Albanian national opera. His operas were influenced by traditional Italian opera, the belcanto style and Albanian folk song. Jakova has also become noted for many folk Albanian songs, which are so widespread, that there is an erroneous belief that they are traditional Albanian popular songs, whereas they are instead composed by Jakova. One of his most famous songs is Margjelo.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 492. The parish measures about east‚Äìwest and about north‚Äìsouth. It is bounded by the River Cherwell to the west, Aves ditch to the east, and field boundaries to the north and south. In 1959 the parish covered an area of . Prehistory Aves ditch is pre-Anglo-Saxon. It may have been dug as a boundary ditch. It still forms the eastern boundary of the parish. Harborough Bank, an Anglo-Saxon burial mound southwest of the village dates from the 6th century. Toponym The toponym \\"Heyford\\" is derived from Old English. It probably means \\"ford used at the time of the hay harvest\\". The earliest known record of it is a document from AD 995 now included in the Codex Diplomaticus Aevi Saxonici, which records it as Hegford. The Domesday Book of 1086 also records it as Hegford or Haiforde, and a charter from AD 1130 also records it as Haiford. An entry in the Book of Fees from 1242 records it as Heyford Magna. After the bridge over the Cherwell was built (see below) the village was called Heyford ad Pontem. It was called Heyford Purcell from about the middle of the 14th century, Nether Heyford after 1474 and sometimes Little Heyford. Some of these names were used concurrently. \\"Lower\\" distinguishes it from Upper Heyford which is about upstream along the Cherwell valley. There are both a Nether Heyford and a Little Heyford in Northamptonshire, so the current \\"Lower Heyford\\" reduces confusion. Manor Before the Norman Conquest of England the manor of Lower Heyford was held by Edwin, the son of a Saxon thegn. William the Conqueror granted the land to the powerful Geoffrey de Montbray, bishop of Coutances. The manor passed through various hands until 1533 when Sir Edward Baynton sold it to Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Corpus Christi College still owned the estate in the 1950s. Churches =Church of England= Inside the nave of St Mary's parish church. The south arcade is flanked by upper doorways to the former rood loft (left) and west gallery (right) Wufwig, Bishop of Dorchester consecrated a parish church at Lower Heyford in the 11th century. The current Church of England parish church of Saint Mary was built in the 13th century. It was largely rebuilt in a Decorated Gothic style in the first half of the 14th century, with north and south aisles joined to the nave by two-bay arcades. The east end of the south aisle is a chapel with niches for statues or figurative reliefs. In the 15th century the Perpendicular Gothic clerestory and south porch were added, and a rood screen with a rood loft for which a stair turret was inserted in the south aisle. An opening high in the wall west of the south arcade suggests that the nave once had a west gallery. This has been removed, as has the rood and rood loft, but the 15th-century wooden screen to the chancel survives. 15th-century chancel screen in St Mary's parish church, seen from the nave The building was twice restored in the 19th century: first in 1848 under the direction of Henry Jones Underwood, and then in 1867‚Äì68 directed by Charles Buckeridge. It is a Grade II* listed building. In the reign of Edward VI the west tower had a ring of four bells. It now has a ring of six, of which the second and fourth were cast in 1766 by Matthew III Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire. W&J; Taylor cast the fifth bell in 1825, presumably at their then foundry in Oxford. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the tenor bell in 1867 and the treble and third bells in 1925. The church is said to have had a 17th-century clock that was made in 1695 and removed during the 1867‚Äì68 restoration. St Mary's is now part of the Benefice of Cherwell Valley along with five other parishes: Ardley, Fritwell, Somerton, Souldern and Upper Heyford. =Quakers and Methodists= In the latter part of the 17th century Lower Heyford had also a Quaker congregation. Lower Heyford had a Methodist congregation by 1804, which soon had a chapel in the village and eventually became part of the United Methodist Church. A new chapel was built in Mill Lane in 1906, was still used for worship in 1955 but is now a private house. =Kingdom Hall= There is a Kingdom Hall at the east end of the village. It was built in the 20th century as the village hall, but sold to the Jehovah's Witnesses in the 2010s. Economic and social history Medieval road bridge over the River Cherwell Medieval pointed barrel vault of flood culvert next to Lower Heyford bridge Heyford Wharf on the Oxford Canal, with part of Heyford railway station in the foreground In the Middle Ages Lower and Upper Heyford had two watermills on the River Cherwell, and one was still in use in 1858. There has been a bridge over the River Cherwell between Lower Heyford, Rousham and Steeple Aston since at least 1255. The present bridge has nine arches and was noted by the early 16th-century antiquary John Leland. In the 1970s Jennifer Sherwood dated part of it to the 13th century, and its north side to either the 15th or 16th century. However, English Heritage dates the earliest parts of the present bridge to the 14th century, its alterations to the 17th century and its widening to the 19th century. The bridge is a Grade II* listed building and forms an important part of the view from the historic adjacent landscape garden of Rousham House. The stretch of the Oxford Canal between Banbury and Tackley was completed in 1787. It runs along the Cherwell valley and bounds Lower Heyford village on its north and west sides. Coal mined in Leicestershire and Warwickshire was unloaded on Heyford Wharf at Lower Heyford. An open field system of farming continued in the parish until 1802 when a land award from a Parliamentary Inclosure Act for the parish was made. In 1797 the road between Bicester and Enstone was made into a turnpike. Lower Heyford had two toll-gates: one at Heyford Bridge and the other at the east end of the village. The road was disturnpiked in 1876, is now the B4030 road and Heyford Bridge continues to carry its traffic. Heyford Wharf sent coal via the turnpike road to Bicester until 1850, when the Buckinghamshire Railway linked to on the London & North Western Railway. Construction of the Oxford & Rugby Railway between and began in 1845. By the time the line opened the Great Western Railway had taken it over. In Lower Heyford the railway runs parallel with the canal on the west side. The GWR opened Heyford railway station at Lower Heyford in 1850. The route is now the Cherwell Valley Line and Heyford station is served by Great Western Railway trains. Former parish school in Market Square In 1808 Lower Heyford had two dame schools, and by 1833 there were three more formal schools. A National School was built in Market Square and opened in 1867. The building was extended by the building of an extra classroom in 1894. In a reorganisation of schools in 1932, the National School became a junior school and senior pupils from Lower Heyford had to go to Steeple Aston. Lower Heyford school became a Church of England controlled school in 1952. It closed in 1974 and is now a private house. Amenities The Bell Inn in Market Square The Bell Inn is a late 17th- or early 18th-century building that has been a pub since at least 1819. In the 20th century it was controlled by Halls Oxford and West Brewery. It is now a free house. Lower Heyford has a playing field and sports pavilion in Freehold Street. The field was funded by the King George's Fields Foundation. Lower Heyford has a bowls club. In 2000 Lower Heyford Cricket Club was the champion of Oxfordshire Cricket Association League Division Four. The Heyfords Women's Institute serves both Lower and Upper Heyford. =Public transport= Hallmark Connections bus route 250 serves Lower Heyford, linking the village with Oxford via in one direction and Bicester via Upper Heyford in the other. The bus stops are outside the Kingdom Hall at the east end of the village. Buses do not serve Lower Heyford railway station. Buses run from Mondays to Saturdays, mostly at hourly intervals. There is no late evening service, and no service on Sundays or bank holidays.

Wanting more, they have captured the lemmings and created new puzzles, so they can watch the lemmings. Gameplay a level in Lemmings Revolution The main new element in this game is the change of the level design. All levels now consist of cylindrical columns, causing the lemmings to walk in large circles on the outer-most area. This essentially creates 2D levels that simply wrap around a cylinder from one side to the other. The levels no longer have an end at left or right, giving lemmings the ability to return to a location without retracing their route when encountering an obstacle. This whole concept was first shown in 8-bit era game Nebulus, one of the most famous platform games for the Commodore 64 and other contemporary computers. The levels are viewed from a single point, from which the player can rotate the level on its axis in either direction. This is similar to simply scrolling left or right in the original games. Zooming in and out is also possible at one single step. In zoomed mode is possible to move the camera at a fixed angle. All original eight skills from Lemmings return in this game, with the same usage. Also returning from previous games are the fast-forward button and the \\"nuke all\\" option. The level structure has also changed significantly. Once a level has been completed, two more levels become available, each slightly more difficult than the previous one. This creates a hierarchal, triangular structure, allowing more and more levels to become available as the game progresses. In this way it is possible to play through to the final column of levels while skipping some others. There are 102 levels in total. Reception The game has received average to positive reviews from the game critics. The highest score was 8/10, given by IGNIGN Review of Lemmings Revolution by Scott Steinberg, Retrieved May 26, 2000 and the critics PC Gameplay, Game Raiders, Computer Games Mag and Computer Games World.Lemmings Revolution for PC at Gamerankings The lowest score was 30/100 given by Frictionless Insight.Frictionless Insight Review of Lemmings Revolution Kevin Rice reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"As a puzzle game that can be quite complex, Lemmings Revolution isn't for everybody.

He was the Grand Prince of Pomorje (titular King) from 1195 until his death. He was the eldest (of three), but his father had instead chosen his younger brother Stefan as heir, as soon as his father died, he plotted against his brother, Stefan II Nemanjiƒá, and took the throne by force, in a coup assisted by the Kingdom of Hungary. He was defeated two years later, and was pardoned by his third brother, who became Saint Sava, and he continued to rule his appanage of Zeta unpunished. Life Vukan was born as the eldest son of Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja (r. 1166-1196) and his wife Anastasija. His younger brothers were Stefan Nemanjiƒá and Rastko Nemanjiƒá, and he also had two sisters. His father had managed to secure the independence from the Byzantine Empire after the death of emperor Manuel I (1180), and then conquered the traditional fiefs of Duklja, Travunija and Hum on the Adriatic coast. Nemanja gives Vukan, as heir apparent, appanages of the conquered lands, including Hvosno and Toplica around 1190 as Grand Prince.Fine, p. 7 (528) In an inscription dated 1195 in the church of St. Luke in Kotor, Vukan is titled as King of Duklja, Dalmatia, Travunia, Toplica and Hvosno.M. ƒÜirkoviƒá, Vuk To≈°iƒá, The Serbs, Wiley- Blackwell, 2004, p. 38 Nemanjiƒá Serbia, 1150‚Äì1217 Although Vukan was Nemanja's eldest son, Nemanja preferred to see his younger son Stefan Nemanjiƒá on the Serbian throne mostly because Stefan was married to Byzantine princes Eudocia, daughter of latter emperor Alexios III Angelos. It seems that Vukan reacted on this change in succession by declaring himself King of Duklja in 1195 probably due to the relationship of his family with old Dukljan royal house which was deposed by his father. Although he assumed royal title, Vukan remained to recognize Nemanja's authority. In 1196 at the State Council Nemanja abdicated in favor of Stefan and Vukan had to recognize his brother as the new ruler of Serbia. After the council Nemanja became monk Simeon and retreated to his monastery of Hilandar on holy Mount Athos. While Nemanja was alive Vukan didn't oppose Stefan's rule but as soon as Nemanja died in 1200 he started to plot against him in order to become Grand ≈æupan. He found help in Hungarian king Emeric (1196‚Äì1204) who at the time fought against the Second Bulgarian Empire and wanted Serbian assistance. With the help of Hungarian troops in 1202, Vukan managed to overthrow Stefan, who fled to Bulgaria, and Vukan was left to rule. In an inscription dating to 1202-1203, Vukan is titled as Grand ≈Ωupan Vukan, Ruler of all Serbian land, Zeta, maritime towns and land of Ni≈°ava.Konstantin Jirecek, Geschichte der Serben 1, Gotha 1911,p.289 In return for Hungarian help, Vukan became a Hungarian vassal and promised that he would convert his people to Catholicism if the Pope would give him royal title. However, as a Hungarian vassal, Vukan soon got involved in their conflict with Bulgaria. In 1203 Bulgarians attacked Serbia and conquered the eastern part of country with the city of Ni≈°. In the chaos that followed the Bulgarian attack, and using the Vukans's sympathies for Catholicism against him, Stefan managed to return to Serbia and overthrow Vukan in 1204 becoming grand ≈æupan again. On intervention of the third brother, archbishop Sava, Stefan spared Vukan and return him to his apanage in Zeta (Duklja) where he kept his title of king. He was mentioned for the last time in 1207. It is believed that he died soon after because his son ƒêorƒëe is mentioned as king in 1208. Until the end of his life, Vukan Nemanjiƒá remained a Catholic.Milenko Kre≈°iƒá; (2016) Vjerske prilike u Humskoj zemlji (Stonu i R√¢tu) u srednjem vijeku (Religious situation in the Hum land (Ston and Rat) during the Middle Ages), {Stefan Prvovjenƒçani zatra≈æio je 1217. i dobio od pape Honorija III.

Moreover, he represented the Punjabi Sikh community in the processes of negotiations that resulted in the independence of India, as well as the Partition of India in 1947. After independence, Baldev Singh was chosen to become the first Minister of Defence, hence becoming the \\"First Sikh Defence Minister\\" of any country in the world, and served in this post during the first Kashmir war between India and Pakistan. He is addressed often with the title of Sardar, which in Punjabi and Hindi means leader or chief. Early life and political career Baldev Singh was born on 11 July 1902 in village Dumna in the Rupar district of Punjab. His father was Sir Indra Singh, a reputed industrialist, and his mother was Nihal Kaur Singh (of village Manpur). He was educated initially at Kainaur and subsequently at the Khalsa College in Amritsar, and began working in his father's firm in the steel industry. He rose to the position of director of the firm. He was married to Hardev Kaur of village Jallanpur in Punjab. They had two sons, Sarjit Singh and Gurdip Singh. Baldev Singh won an election to the Punjab provincial assembly under the Government of India Act 1935 in 1937, as a candidate of the Panthic Party. He became closely linked with Master Tara Singh and the Shiromani Akali Dal. Cripps Mission and World War II When the Cripps Mission arrived in India in 1942 to offer Indians some form of self- government, Baldev Singh was chosen to represent the Sikh community in the talks, which also included the chief Indian political party, the Indian National Congress and Muslim League party. The Mission failed to make any progress. While the Congress Party launched the Quit India Movement, Baldev Singh and other Sikh leaders did not support it. Singh negotiated an agreement with Sir Sikandar Hyat Khan, the leader of the Unionist Muslim League to form a government in Punjab, and became the provincial Development Minister for a brief time in the summer of 1942. Cabinet Mission and government Baldev Singh was chosen again to represent the Sikh viewpoint to the Cabinet Mission Plan that had arrived to discuss proposals for Indian political independence. Singh reiterated the Sikh view that India should remain a united country with special protections for the rights of religious minorities. Singh also insisted that should partition become inevitable, the division of the Punjab should happen in a way to offer territorial protection to the Sikhs from Muslim domination. Although Baldev Singh and other Sikhs initially opposed the implementation of the Mission's 16 May scheme, on the grounds that it did not offer any protection to the Sikh community, Baldev Singh joined the new Viceroy's Executive Council, to be headed by Congress leaders Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhai Patel as the Sikh member. Singh became the Defence Member, a post erstwhile held by the British Commander in Chief of the Indian Army. However, by early 1947, it was clear that the interim government would not work, owing to the conflict between the Congress Party and the Muslim League. Partition of India Although Baldev Singh and other Sikhs initially opposed the implementation of the Mission's 16 May scheme, in the grounds that it did not offer any protection to the Sikh community, Baldev Singh joined the new Viceroy's Executive Council, to be headed by Congress leaders Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel as the Sikh member. Singh became the Defence minister. As defence minister Baldev Singh with C. Rajagopalachari and Chiefs of Staff On 15 August 1947, India became an independent nation and Baldev Singh became India's first Minister of Defence, under the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. Singh was also a member of the Constituent Assembly of India. Along with Vallabhbhai Patel, the Home Minister, Singh became responsible for leading the Indian Army's efforts to provide security, relief and refuge to over 10 million Hindus and Sikhs who were leaving the newly created Pakistan. Terrible violence broke loose on both sides of the frontier along the Punjab and Bengal, and to date it is estimated that over 1 million people were killed, with millions more suffering from usual acts of cruelty and great physical and personal trauma from the migration. The Army was caught unprepared, and itself was torn apart by the conflict. Thousands of Muslim officers were leaving for Pakistan. Riots had broken out in Calcutta, Delhi and Bombay. Patel and Singh led from the front, and despite a heavy toll, the Army finally re-asserted peace and rule of law all over India and the borders of Punjab and Bengal. They organized massive relief and aid operation for the millions of people arriving in India. Defence Minister Singh also led the preparations and planning for war in Kashmir, which had broken out with Pakistani tribesmen and some military officers had incursed into the state with the aim of annexing it into Pakistan. Over almost two years, the Indian Army would wage battle with the militants and the Pakistan Army at the highest altitudes in the world. The Army succeeded in pushing back the raiders from Srinagar and beyond the Baramulla Pass, but with Nehru's declaration of a cease-fire under the supervision of the United Nations, a considerable portion of territory now lay under the firm control of the Pakistani Army, and the Kashmir conflict was born. In September 1948, under the instructions of the Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel, Baldev Singh and his commanders prepared plans for Operation Polo, a week-long operation that annexed the princely state of Hyderabad into the Indian Union. Singh remained a close advisor to Patel on managing the Kashmir conflict and the issues of political integration of India. Baldev Singh was removed from the post of defense minister \\"As Nehru lost confidence in the political integrity of Baldev Singh.\\"Book Reminiscences of the Nehru Age by MO Mathai. Page 238. Vikas Publishing House PVT LTD. New Delhi. 1978 Later life In 1952, Baldev Singh was elected to the Parliament of India as a member of the Indian National Congress, in the first democratic elections under the new Constitution of India. However, he did not join the Nehru administration. Singh remained the major political representative of the Sikh concerns and was respected by the Akali Dal. He was re-elected to the Parliament in 1957. Singh died in Delhi after a prolonged illness in 1961. He was survived by his two sons, Sarjit Singh (1927‚Äì1993 AD) and Gurdip Singh. Sarjit Singh was the Co-operatives minister in the government of Parkash Singh Badal. He was married to Raj Mohinder Kaur and is survived by his son Tejbal Singh and his daughter Jaspreet Kaur. Gurdip Singh was married to Baljit Kaur and had 4 children. Baldev Singh had 6 great grandchildren. His nephew Ravi Inder Singh was the Speaker of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha.

The Museum's two historical tenement buildings were home to an estimated 15,000 people, from over 20 nations, between 1863 and 2011. The museum, which includes a visitors' center, promotes tolerance and historical perspective on the immigrant experience.  History  The building at 97 Orchard Street was contracted by Prussian-born immigrant Lukas Glockner in 1863 and was modified several times to conform with the city's developing housing laws. When first constructed, it contained 22 apartments and a basement level saloon. Over time, four stoop-level and two basement apartments were converted into commercial retail space, leaving 16 apartments in the building. Modifications over the years included the installation of indoor plumbing (cold running water, two toilets per floor), an air shaft, and gas followed by electricity. In 1935, rather than continuing to modify the building, the landlord evicted the residents, boarded the upper windows, and sealed the upper floors, leaving only the stoop-level and basement storefronts open for business. No further changes were made until the Lower East Side Tenement Museum became involved with the building in 1988. As such, the building stands as a kind of time capsule, reflecting 19th and early 20th century living conditions and the changing notions of what constitutes acceptable housing. In spite of the restoration, some parts of the upper floors are unstable and remain closed. The Tenement Museum The Tenement Museum was founded in 1988 by Ruth J. Abram and Anita Jacobson. The Museum's first key property, the tenement at 97 Orchard Street, was designated a National Historic Landmark on April 19, 1994. The National Historic Site was authorized on November 12, 1998. It is an affiliated area of the National Park Service but is owned and administered by the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. The site received a Save America's Treasures matching grant for $250,000 in 2000 for preservation work. In 2001 the museum was awarded the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence silver medal. In 2005, the museum was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. The National Defense Authorization Act for the 2015 fiscal year expanded the National Historic Site designation to also include the tenement at 103 Orchard Street. The Tenement Museum attracted some negative press in 2007 related to its employees seeking union membership as well as for its planned acquisition of the building at 99 Orchard Street through eminent domain in 2002. Exhibits, collections, and programs The museum's exhibits and programs include restored apartments and shops open daily for public tours, depicting the lives of immigrants who lived at 97 Orchard Street between 1869 and 1935 and 103 Orchard Street from the 1950s to the 1980s. The museum also provides a documentary film and offers tours with costumed interpreters for portraying the building's former residents, tastings of their communities' typical foods, and neighborhood walks. The museum's tours place the immigrants' lives in the broader context of American history. The museum also has an extensive collection of historical archives and provides a variety of educational programs. A new exhibition titled \\"Under One Roof\\" opened in December 2017. Located at 103 Orchard Street, above the Visitor's Center, the new exhibition explores the lives of a Holocaust refugee family, a Puerto Rican migrant family, and a Chinese immigrant family.  The Tenement House Act  There were many Tenement House Acts during the 1800s and 1900s. However, there were three particular Acts that changed the living conditions in housing today. Those three Tenement House Acts were: The Tenement House Act of 1867, The Tenement House Act of 1879, and The Tenement House Act of 1901 which is part of the New York State Tenement House Act. The first tenement house act was called The Tenement House Act of 1867, also known as \\"the Old Law\\". It was the country's first comprehensive housing reform law. The law required buildings to have fire escapes and at least one toilet for every 20 tenants, and to be connected to the city sewers if possible. However, many people (tenement owners) did not follow the law, so it had little effect. Then came the second Tenement House Act which was called The Tenement House Act of 1879, also known as \\"the Old Law\\" and was followed by the 1867 law. Many buildings were outlawing the construction of buildings like 97 Orchard Street that had interior rooms without windows. The 1879 law required all rooms to be open onto the street, the rear yard, or an air shaft, for the tenant to escape the building in an emergency. This led owners to the development of the \\"dumb-bell\\" tenement plan. Then came the third Tenement House Act which was called The Tenement House Act of 1901, also known as \\"The New Law.\\" The government noticed that many of the tenement buildings were extremely dangerous and unlivable. The 1901 law required buildings to include running water, gas, light, and ventilation. The Dumb-bell tenement plan was outlawed. Since the previous Tenement House Act had not helped change the housing conditions, the law allowed the Tenement House Department to inspect these buildings and enforce the new regulations.

It uses the .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6√ó70mm) cartridge, which remains supersonic up to a range of 1200‚Äì1500 m depending on the exact ammunition type and environmental conditions. The PGM 338 is intended to fulfill a long-range anti-personnel role, and fills the capability void between the lighter 7.62√ó51mm NATO (.308) anti-personnel sniper rifles, which do not have the sufficient maximum effective range to be effectively used at ultra long ranges, and the larger .50 BMG (12.7√ó99mm) anti-materiel rifles, which lack the portability of lighter systems. The PGM 338 was designed by Chris L. Movigliatti (when he worked for PGM Pr√©cision) of the Swiss AMSD company and is produced by PGM Pr√©cision of France. The rifle is distributed directly through PGM in France, Drake Associates, Inc. of the United States and Liemke Defence in Germany and other European countries. The PGM 338 main commercial competitors/equivalents on the high-end factory sniper rifle market are the Accuracy International Arctic Warfare and Sako TRG product lines. All these rifles are comparable performance-wise. Design details Like its larger brother - the PGM H√©cate II (chambered in .50 BMG), the PGM 338 is structured around a central rigid metal girder chassis, giving it a skeletal \\"barebones\\" appearance to minimize weight and simplify maintenance. The receiver is made from a high quality 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum alloy, while the steel bolt has three lugs that lock into a barrel extension. It also has overpressure vent holes allowing high- pressure gases a channel of escape in the rare event of a cartridge case head failure. The barrel was designed by the German firm Lothar Walther and is cold hammer forged. The match grade fluted barrel is mounted fully floated and sports an integrated muzzle brake with a 50% recoil reduction effectiveness. The barrel features a non-conventional 305 mm (1:12 in) right-hand twist rate optimized for firing 16.2 gram (250 grain) .338-calibre very-low-drag bullets (VLD). Longer, heavier VLD bullets, like the Sierra HPBT MatchKing 19.44 gram (300 grain) projectile require a 254 mm (1:10 in) rifling twist rate. The furniture (pistol grip and forearm) is made from a polymer material and is mounted to the frame. The buttstock is made from metal and has an adjustable shoulder pad for comfortable aiming and minimizing the effects of recoil on the operator. It is also adjustable for the length of pull and height, and can be folded to the left side of the receiver to reduce the overall dimensions of the rifle and make it more portable. An adjustable rear folding ground spike under the stock helps to keep the rifle in a stable position for extended periods of time and is most effective when coupled with the folding bipod support under the rifle barrel. A pistol grip is used for comfortable wielding of the weapon, especially during prolonged periods of time during which the operator must be immediately ready to open fire. The rifle has a fully adjustable two-stage trigger featuring an adjustable trigger pull weight of to that can be adjusted by an armourer and a fast lock time. The PGM 338 is fitted with a Picatinny rail so that it may be equipped with a wide range of commercial and NATO-standard optical sights, lights, night vision equipment and other tactical accessories. It also has an optional set of emergency iron sights to be used in case of the failure of the primary sight. PGM 338 rifle. Normally muzzle brakes are fitted to reduce recoil, jump and flash. The PGM factory muzzle brakes are however detachable if a user does not wish to use it. In order to preserve an optimal shooting comfort, the factory advises to avoid firing without the muzzle brake or silencer attached.PGM .338 LM User Manual The PGM 338 is primarily intended for anti-personnel sniper work at distances between 500 and 1400 m, and can consistently achieve an accuracy of about 0.5 MOA with match-grade ammunition when employed by a qualified marksman. At distances below 500 m, the .338 Lapua Magnum would be too powerful for anti-personnel use and cause overpenetration in most circumstances, unless deep material penetration is required. At distances beyond 1200 m, the standard .338 Lapua Magnum bullets enter the transonic velocity region, thus significantly degrading its accuracy, but remaining somewhat reliable up to 1500 m. The rifle is most often used with a 10-round box magazine, although larger capacity magazines are also available. Factory accessories are: PGM sound-suppressor, ergonomic wooden grip, kit consisting of a long Picatinny rail and side Picatinny rails, PGM telescopic sight mounts, PGM back-up iron sights, transport case with formed foam and a carrying sling.

This character is usually male and is generally anthropomorphic, although he may have some coyote-like physical features such as fur, pointed ears, yellow eyes, a tail and claws. The myths and legends which include Coyote vary widely from culture to culture. Coyote shares many traits with the mythological figure Raven. Coyote also is seen as inspiration to certain tribes. Mythology The word \\"coyote\\" was originally a Spanish corruption of the Nahuatl (Aztec) word for the animal, coyotl. Coyote mythlore is one of the most popular among Native American people. Coyote is in some lore said to be a trickster. =Coyoteway= Coyote is the tutelary spirit of \\"Coyoteway\\", one of the Navajo curing ceremonies which feature masked impersonators of divinities. The ceremony is necessary if someone in the tribe catches \\"coyote illness\\", which can result from killing a coyote or even seeing its dead body. During the ritual, the patient takes the part of the hero of a ceremonial myth and sits on a sandpainting depicting an episode from the myth. He or she \\"meets\\" Coyote, who appears in the form of a masked impersonator. The ceremony restores the patient's harmonious relationship with Coyote and the world and thus ensures a return to good health. =Other Native American tricksters= There are many Native American trickster characters, or many faces for the same archetypal figure. Kumokums is a trickster of the Modoc Indians of California. Nanabozho is an Algonquian trickster. Among tribes of the Midwest the trickster is sometimes the Great Hare. For many Plains Indians he is Ikotme the Spider. In the Pacific Northwest he is Raven. Great hare, Nanabush or Glooskap in the woodlands, Rabbit in the Southeast, Coyote on the Plains in the West, and Raven, Blue Jay or Mink on the Northwest coast. And in many parts of the country we find the trickster Coyote, Raven, and Iktome are particularly popular figures. By culture The coyote (Canis latrans), the animal on which the myths are based Coyote is a figure in the following cultural areas of the Americas, as commonly defined by ethnographers: =California= Coyote is featured in the mythology of numerous peoples from the area covered by the modern state of California, including the Achomawi and Atsugewi, the Dieguenos, the Gallinomero the Juaneno, the Karok, the Luiseno, the Maidu, the Miwok, the Pomo the Rumsen, the Shasta the Shastika, the Sinkyone, the Wappo, the Yana and the Yokut. In many of these stories he is a major sacred character with divine creative powers; in others he is a malevolent and often comical trickster. In some stories he combines both roles. A good example is a Maidu myth that says that at the beginning of time, a primal being called Earth Maker is floating on the infinite waters, when Coyote calls out to him. Together they sing to create the world. After it is completed, and Earth Maker has created the people, Coyote vows to spoil the world and introduce evil to it. Earth Maker orders the people to destroy Coyote, but despite their best efforts, Coyote uses supernatural trickery to outwit them. In the end, Earth Maker is forced to recognise that Coyote's power is equal to his own. A common theme is of Coyote benefitting the human community by organising the theft of fire, or of the sun, from the supernatural beings who have been keeping it for themselves; in these myths he is portrayed as a benefactor of the people. In a Shasta myth, Coyote saves the world from ten evil moons which have inflicted it with everlasting winter. In a Miwok myth, Coyote creates all animals, then calls them to a council to discuss the creation of human beings. Each animal wants people to be imbued with its own best qualities, causing an argument. Coyote mocks them all, vowing that human beings should have his own wit and cunning. Each animal makes a human model in its own likeness; but overnight Coyote destroys the other models, so that only his own model comes to life. A Maidu myth says that as the Creator was fashioning various creatures out of clay, Coyote tried to do the same. However, as he kept laughing, his efforts did not turn out well. The Creator suggested that if he stopped laughing, he might do better. Coyote denied laughing - thus telling the world's first lie.Leeming, David. \\"Coyote\\", Oxford Companion to World Mythology, Oxford University Press, USA, 2005 Some stories depict Coyote as the embodiment of evil lechery: a serial rapist who uses trickery to attack a variety of victims including, for example, his own mother-in-law and his sister. Such tales may have served to reinforce the community moral code, by using outrageous humour to portray examples of intolerable behaviour. Great Basin Coyote is featured in myths of the Chemehuevi, Paiute, Shoshone and Ute peoples. In this region most of the stories feature him as a malevolent and lecherous trickster. However, there are some echoes of his divine role as expressed in the myths of California, in particular obtaining fire for the people.  Origin of the Horse  One such myth from the Chemehuevi involves Coyote enlisting the help of other animals in order to achieve his goals. In the later half of a myth called \\"Coyote Went to get Basketry Material\\" Coyote enlists the help of the Black Spider and Parotsok^^itapitsi, an unknown bird species, to take revenge on the Sky-Down-feather-Brothers for killing his grandson. This myth also involves Coyote discovering the first horse, who happens to be his own grandson. It begins with Coyote's grandson being sent by his mother to go see Coyote and before the grandson leaves he is explicitly told not to enter a cave that lies between his mother's house and Coyote's house. However, after the grandson had traveled for some time it began to get dark and rain began to fall. Deciding to disobey his mother's instruction, the grandson spends the night and the subsequent morning in the cave. When the youth awakens, he finds that his head feels heavy, his hands now look completely different, and he is covered in hair. As he leaves the cave, he is approached by some mountain sheep who accompany him on his journey to his grandfather's house. When he reaches Coyote's home, Coyote sees them coming and notices that one of the mountain sheep is much bigger than the rest. He plans on killing the big one before Wolf tells him that that mountain sheep is actually his own grandson and urges him to not only not kill it, but also to feed the big mountain sheep bunchgrass. Coyote obliges and decides to settle for killing some of the smaller mountain sheep instead. After eating, his grandson goes off to spend the night with the other mountain sheep before returning in the morning. Once again, Coyote kills some of the smaller sheep and feeds the biggest one some bunchgrass. This same process repeats itself several times with Coyote gaining an enormous amount of meat. One morning, however, the big mountain sheep is spied by the two Sky-Down-feather-Brothers. The eldest, knowing who the big mountain sheep really is, plans on leaving him alone but the younger brother ignores his older brother's warning and decides to kill the big mountain sheep. After shooting the big mountain sheep the younger brother finds that his big catch has suddenly turned into a boy wearing moccasins. The two brothers then butcher the body and fly away. The following morning Wolf mourns the loss of their grandson and devises a plan for revenge. Wolf tells Coyote to hide almost all the water, have the Black Spider spin a web to fill the sky's hole, and to hide near the little water still uncovered with Parotsok^^itapitsi with a hot rock from a fire pit. Coyote agrees to this plan but before he sets it in motion, he goes to the spot where his grandson was killed where he finds some blood and a little bit of hair which he packs in a basket before leaving. Coyote asks the Black Spider to make a web out of cooked sinew and the spider agrees to help him. He then asks Parotsok^^itapitsi to accompany him at the edge of the water and shout when the Sky-Down-feather brothers try to fly away in order to keep them in place and he also agrees to do this. Eventually, both of the Sky-Down-feather- brothers get thirsty and search for some water to drink. The younger brother quickly spots the water where Coyote is hiding and suggests they land there to drink but the elder brother knows better and tells his brother that that is where Coyote is hiding, waiting for them. The brothers then try to trick Coyote multiple times by flying close to the water and saying, \\"Oh, Coyote, sitting by a roasting pit heating a stone!\\" Each time, Coyote almost reveals himself thinking he has been discovered but each time Parotsok^^itapitsi stops him telling him that the brothers are trying to trick him. Finally, the two brothers stop to drink and in that moment, Coyote throws the hot stone at them and Parotsok^^itapitsi shouts as they try to fly away and the brothers become trapped in the web blocking the sky's hole. Then, Black Spider climbs down the web and bites the brothers on their necks and they both fall back down to the ground. The story concludes with Coyote going to where he had left his grandson's remains only to find that his grandson had been revived and was gone. Coyote deduces that his grandson has become a horse due to the fact that all the grass in the surrounding area had been eaten. =Plateau= Myths and stories of Coyote are also found in the cultures of the Plateau area: the Chinookan (including the Wishram people and the Multnomah),Chinookan stories the Flathead,Flathead stories the Nez Perce,Nez Perce Stories the Nlaka'pamux, the Syilx (Okanagan), the St'at'imc, the Tsilhqot'in, and the Yakama.Other stories from Plateau tribes One story from the Chinookan describes Coyote's attempts to catch salmon. After repeated failures, Coyote defecates and his own feces begin to insult him. Eventually, his feces stop insulting him and offer detailed advice not only for catching the salmon, but also for preparing the fish once he has them. Coyote enjoys success for a while before he begins to fail once again. Coyote stops and, as before, defecates again. This batch of feces tells Coyote that there are even more aspects he has to take into consideration when fishing including specific instructions for specific geographic location. The story concludes with Coyote finally understanding how to fish properly but thoroughly exhausted. =Southwest= Coyote also appears in the traditions of the Jicarilla Apache. In the mythology of the Tohono O'odham people of Arizona, he appears as an associate of the culture-hero Montezuma. He also appears in a legend of the White Mountain Apache, \\"Coyote fights a lump of pitch\\" (a variant of the Tar-Baby theme), and in similar legends of the Zapotec and Popoluca of Mexico. Functional cognates Coyote is compared to both the Scandinavian Loki, and also Prometheus, who shared with Coyote the trick of having stolen fire from the gods as a gift for mankind, and Anansi, a mythological culture hero from Western African mythology. In Eurasia, rather than a coyote, a fox is often featured as a trickster hero, ranging from kitsune (fox) tales in Japan to the Reynard cycle in Western Europe. Claude L√©vi-Strauss, French anthropologist proposed a structuralist theory that suggests that Coyote and Crow obtained mythic status because they are mediator animals between life and death.L√©vi-Strauss, Claude. Structural Anthropology. Trans. Claire Jacobson. New York: Basic Books, 1963. (p. 224) In the modern world Coyote figures prominently in current efforts to educate young people about indigenous languages and cultures in North America. For example, the Secwepemc people of the Kamloops Indian Band in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada, have designated their recently opened native elementary school the Sk'elep (Coyote) School of Excellence, while educational websites such as one co-sponsored by the Neskonlith Indian Band of Chase, British Columbia prominently feature stories about Sk'elep. the Mobooks include two collections of contemporary Coyote tales, Elderberry Flute Song and The Other Side of Nowhere, which place Coyote in a number of different hawk Nation. Coyote also features as a character in the webcomic Gunnerkrigg Court, written by Tom Siddell, where he is portrayed with his trickster characteristics in full force and his status as a god and the implications not left forgotten. Coyote is also an important character in C. Robert Cargill's Dreams and Shadows series, playing a focal role in the manipulation of the storyline. He is presented as a manitou. One character of the Native American Tricksters that has survived into modern times is that of the Southeast version of the Coyote trickster. Usually called the Great Hare passed into modern American folklore as Brer Rabbit after West African slaves fused him with their own Hare trickster.

The family moved again to Mayfield Terrace in the south of the city when Robert was a teenager.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1859-60 He studied art at evening classes at the Board of Manufacturers in Edinburgh and at the life school of the Royal Scottish Academy, and began exhibiting at the RSA in 1867 showing an Arran landscape; this would be the first of no fewer than 143 paintings exhibited at the academy. By the end of the next decade he had begun to establish his reputation as a painter of battles. Following Comrades, his first foray into the military genre, he was elected an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy. The theme of this painting, a group of three soldiers, one of whom has fallen in the snow, was taken from his painting showing the retreat from Moscow which was shown the following year. He was made a full member following the enormous success of his 1881 painting The Thin Red Line which was inspired by his reading of Alexander Kinglake's book The Invasion of the Crimea. Three years later came Schoolmates depicting two highland officers in the heat of battle, one falling wounded into the arms of the other. In 1895 he was appointed Principal Curator of the National Gallery of Scotland, following the death of Gourlay Steell, and served in this role until 1907.The Concept of the Master in Art Education: by Matthew Potter He continued painting military scenes throughout the Great War, and his last military painting Backs to the Wall appeared in 1929. Gibb was also sought after also as a portrait painter and among his subjects were Henry M. Stanley, the African explorer, the Rev. Joseph Parker, D.D., Sir Arthur Halkett, Bart., and the artist's wife, the former Margaret Shennan, second daughter of the Lord Dean of the Guild, whom he married in 1885. The artist died at his residence at 2 Bruntsfield Crescent,Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1911-12 Edinburgh in 1932, and he was given a full military funeral with honour guard at his funeral in Warriston Cemetery in Edinburgh on 15 February. Although some claim his grave lies on a path edge south of the vaults (with no gravestone) this does not make complete sense as the family already had a burial plot in a south-west section (around 30m south of the alleged site). This was the burial place of his brother William in 1929. The lack of inscription to Robert is explained by his lack of family at the time of death.

Life A Garden'Canaries'Seagulls Moore was born at York on 4 September 1841, the thirteenth son and fourteenth child of well known portrait-painter William Moore and his second wife, Sarah Collingham. Several of his numerous brothers were educated as artists, including Henry Moore, R.A., the well-known sea painter. Albert Moore was educated at Archbishop Holgate's School, and also at St. Peter's School at York, receiving at the same time instruction in drawing and painting from his father. He made such progress that he gained a medal from the Department of Science and Art at Kensington in May 1853, before completing his twelfth year. After his father's death in 1851, Moore owed much to the care and tuition of his brother, John Collingham Moore. In 1855, he came to London and attended the Kensington grammar school till 1858, when he became a student in the art school of the Royal Academy. He had already exhibited there in 1857, when he sent A Goldfinch and A Woodcock. His early works shows the influence of Ruskin. In 1859 he was in France with the architect William Eden Nesfield. In 1861, he made a new venture with two sacred subjects, The Mother of Sisera looked out of a Window (Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle) and Elijah running to Jezreel before Ahab's Chariot (Private collection, Canada). Meanwhile, Moore had given signs of the remarkable skill which he afterwards displayed as a decorative artist. The 1860s saw Moore designing tiles, wallpaper and stained glass for Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Co., and working as an ecclesiastic and domestic mural painter. During this period his works began to take on a markedly neo- classical character, Moore making an extensive study of antique sculpture, particularly the Elgin marbles in the British Museum. His concern for decorative, color harmonies became apparent in his paintings of the mid 1860s onwards. His works, typically single female figures with formalized proportions, neo-classical drapery and floral accessories, established a major strand of the Aesthetic Movement. About 1860 he painted a ceiling at Shipley, followed by another at Croxteth Park, Lancashire. He spent the winter of 1862‚Äì3 in Rome with his brother John Collingham Moore. It was here that he painted Elijah's Sacrifice, (1863) which shows the influence of Ford Madox Brown and Edward Armitage. In 1863 he executed a wall painting for the kitchen of Combe Abbey for the Earl of Craven. Moore was a regular exhibitor at the Grosvenor Gallery from 1877 onwards. In 1864, he exhibited at the Royal Academy a group in fresco, entitled The Seasons, which attracted notice from the graceful pose of the limbs in the figures, and the delicate folds of the draperies. In 1865, Moore exhibited at the Royal Academy The Marble Seat, the first of a long series of purely decorative pictures, with which his name will always be associated. Henceforth he devoted himself entirely to this class of painting, and every picture was the result of a carefully thought out and elaborated harmony in pose and colour, having as its basis the human form, studied in the true Hellenic spirit. From the mid-1860s onwards, Moore increasingly began to paint works of female figures in differing states of consciousness, often sleep. This can be seen in works ranging from Lilies (1866) to Dreamers (1879‚Äì82) to Midsummer (1887). These paintings relate sensory, bodily experience with consciousness itself, in ways aligned with the ideas of contemporary physiological psychologists like George Henry Lewes. Such depictions suggest Moore‚Äôs interest in the contemporary science of mind and experience, and he pursued related themes until his death. The chief charm of Moore's pictures lay in the delicate low tones of the diaphanous, tissue- like garments in which the figures were draped. The names attached to the pictures were generally suggested by the completed work, and rarely represented any preconceived idea in the artist's mind. Among them were such titles as A Painter's Tribute to Music, Shells, The Reader, Dreamers, Battledore, Shuttlecock, Azaleas. In so limited a sphere of art, Moore found his admirers among the few true connoisseurs of art rather than among the general public. His pictures were frequently sold off the easel before completion, but it was not till late in his life that he obtained what may be called direct patronage. He executed other important decorative works, like The Last Supper and some paintings for a church at Rochdale, the hall at Claremont, the proscenium of the Queen's Theatre, Long Acre, and a frieze of peacocks for Mr. Lehmann. Moore was of an independent disposition, and relied solely on his own judgment in matters both social and artistic. His somewhat outspoken views proved a bar to his admission into the ranks of the Royal Academy, for which he was many years a candidate, and where his works were long a chief source of attraction. Though suffering from a painful and incurable illness, Moore worked up to the last, completing by sheer courage and determination an important picture just before his death, which occurred on 25 September 1893, at 2 Spenser Street, Victoria Street, Westminster. He was buried at Highgate cemetery. His last picture, The Loves of the Seasons and the Winds, is one of his most elaborate and painstaking works ; it was painted for Mr. McCulloch, and Moore wrote three stanzas of verse to explain the title. Moore's work is now represented in many important public collections, such as those of Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, and elsewhere. An exhibition of his works was held at the Grafton Galleries, London, in 1894. Several of his pictures are now in public collections throughout the United Kingdom and, in addition to those above, include Blossoms in the Tate, and a watercolor, The Open Book, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The British Museum in London has a group of his early drawings.

He held the office of Prime Minister of the Punjab among other positions. Early life He was born in Multan, Punjab into the Khattar family of Wah.See Sir Sikander Hyat Khan: The Soldier- Statesman of the Punjab, A Special Memorial Volume, Lahore: Government of the Punjab, 1943, pp. 10‚Äì12. His father was Nawab Muhammad Hayat Khan, a civil servant and close associate of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, and his grandfather was Sardar Karam Khan, who was killed fighting for the British in the Second Anglo-Sikh War. He was educated at school in Aligarh and later at Aligarh Muslim University, and for a short while was sent to study medicine at King's College London in the United Kingdom but was recalled home by his family circa 1915.See Sir Sikander Hyat Khan: The Soldier-Statesman of the Punjab, A Special Memorial Volume, Lahore: Government of the Punjab, 1943, pp. 10‚Äì12. During the First World War, he initially worked as a War Recruitment Officer in his native Attock districtSir Sikandar Hayat Khan: The Soldier-Statesman of the Punjab, p. 31. and later served as one of the first Indian officers to receive the King's Commission, with the 2/67th Punjabis (later the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment).See Field-Marshal Sir Archibald Percival Wavell, later Lord Wavell, in Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan: The Soldier-Statesman of the Punjab, pp. 33‚Äì34.During World War 2, when serving as the Premier of the Punjab, Sir Sikandar was given an honorary rank of Lieutenant-Colonel but this only temporary and in no way indicated actual military rank. See Wavell, above, p 34 As a result of his distinguished services in the Great War and later, the Third Afghan War, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, Military Division (MBE, Mil.) by the Government of British India.See 'The Handbook of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire', 1921 ed After 1920, Sir Sikandar turned his talents to business and by dint of his financial acumen and managerial skills, soon became a director or managing director of several companies, including the Wah Tea Estate, The Amritsar- Kasur Railway Company, The People's Bank of Northern India, The Sialkot- Narowal Railway, The ACC Wah Portland Cement Company, the Wah Stone and Lime Company, Messrs. Owen Roberts, the Punjab Sugar Corporation Ltd, Messrs. Walter Locke & Co, The Lahore Electricity Supply Co and many others.Dr. Iftikhar H. Malik, \\"Sir Sikandar Hayat: A Political Biography\\", Islamabad: NIHCR, 1985, p. 12. He also entered grassroots politics at this time, and remained an honorary magistrate and Chairman of the Attock District Board. Later, for a brief while he also remained the acting deputy-governor of the newly established Reserve Bank of India in 1935,He was also a member of its first Central board of directors, when the RBI was established in April 1935 on the recommendations of the Hilton-Young Commission of 1925‚Äì26. See the History section of the Official Website of the RBI http://www.rbi.org.in prior to returning to take on party leadership in the Punjab in 1936. Later life and career In 1921, Sir Sikandar was elected to the Punjab Legislative Council and his effective political role now began, as he became one of the main leaders of the Punjab Unionist Party(later known as the Unionist Party), an all-Punjab political party formed to represent the interests of the landed gentry and landlords of Punjab which included Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus. After an outstanding period of political enterprise between 1924 and 1934,During which time he was also the first Indian native to have the unique distinction of being twice appointed as acting governor of the Punjab, in 1932 and then again in 1933‚Äì34.Dr. Iftikhar H. Malik, pp. 41‚Äì46 for details he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division (KBE) in the 1933 New Year Honours list.also see Prof. Lajpat Nair, Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan: Politics, Paper, Proceedings of the Institute for Current Affairs, Lahore, October 1943. he in due course took over leadership of the Unionist Party from Sir Fazli Husein. Khan led his party to victory in the 1937 elections, held under the Government of India Act 1935 and then governed the Punjab as premier in coalition with the Sikh Akali Dal and the Indian National Congress. When Khan was the Unionist Premier, he extended the offer of Parliamentary Secretaryship to Ghazanfar Ali Khan, who became a strong backer of the Unionist Party in the assembly. This government carried out many reforms for the better of the Punjabi Zamindar or agrarian community. When Indian farmers faced a crash of agricultural prices and economic distress in the late 1930s, Sir Sikandar took further measures to alleviate their misery in the Punjab Inspired by the earlier example of his late father Nawab Muhammad Hayat Khan, who had played an instrumental role in helping the Punjab peasantry out of debt during the 1890s; see IH Malik, Sir Sikandar: A Political Biography aa \\\\- similar steps were also taken by A K Fazlul Huq, the premier of Bengal, in working to relieve the Bengali peasantry from crippling debts to private sources, using both legal and administrative measures. Khan opposed the Quit India Movement of 1942, and supported the Allied powers during World War II. Khan believed in politically co-operating with the British for the independence of India and the unity of Punjab.Ahmad, aa In 1937, soon after winning the general elections, confronted by internal pressure from many of his Muslim parliamentary colleagues and conscious of the need to maintain a balanced, equitable stance in a volatile and much-divided Punjabi political milieu,According to the first-hand account of Sir Penderel Moon, who was then serving under Khan as a British ICS officer, in discussions in 1937 and 1938, Sir Sikandar explained to him the vital need for (a) maintaining the unity and integrity of the Punjab as a whole, and (b) at the same time striking a 'fine balance' in ensuring the rights of all Punjabi communities and communal factions; and he opined that rather than let things slide into anarchy and chaos, he would try his level best to do his 'utmost' to keep talking and making necessary concessions to all sides. While well- intentioned, this was probably attempting too much in circumstances that were inevitably headed towards divisiveness and beyond his control. See Moon, Divide and Quit, London: Chatto & Windus, 1962, pp. 19‚Äì20. Khan decided to also negotiate with the Muslim elements under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah.See Syed Amjad Ali, Memoirs, Lahore, 1985, p 278: the author said that 'Thanks to the agreement reached between Jinnah and Sir Sikandar in Lucknow, the dream of Pakistan became real. All Pakistanis today should be thankful to these two great Muslim leaders and their wisdom', 192 ; and Wolpert 1999, aa, where Wolpert states that 'The Punjab was more than just a bare Muslim majority [like Bengal] ; the Punjab meant Pakistan, made Pakistan possible', pp 150-51 Khan and Jinnah signed the Jinnah-Sikandar Pact at Lucknow in October 1937, merging the Muslim elements of his powerful Unionist force with the All India Muslim League, as a move towards reconciling the various Muslim elements in the Punjab and elsewhere in India, towards a common, united front for safeguarding their community rights and interests.Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah of Pakistan, Karachi: Oxford University Press, 1999, pp. 150‚Äì151. Within the agreement, Khan announced he was \\"advising all the Muslim members of the Unionist Party in Punjab to join the League.\\" He was also later one of the chief supporters and architects of the Lahore Resolution, March 1940, calling for an autonomous or semi-independent Muslim majority region within the larger Indian confederation.Syed Amjad Ali, aa; and IH Malik, aa Sikandar Hayat Khan, however, opposed the partition of India and condemned \\"any reference to the 'Lahore Resolution' as the 'Pakistan Resolution'.\\" To Khan, the \\"partition meant disrupting the Punjab and the Unionist Party, and he was not prepared to accept this\\". Sir Sikandar's final days as Punjab's premier were extremely troublesome and marred by controversies and bitterness:Mansergh and Lumby (eds), Transfer of Power Documents, London, 1971, Vol. III, p. 431. since 1940 the Khaksars had been constantly giving trouble; he was having a rough time within the Muslim League with Malik Barkat Ali and others; and in the Legislative Assembly Bhai Parmanand and Master Tara Singh were questioning his increasingly inconsistent stance over Pakistan and Punjabi unity.Detailed review in the Civil and Military Gazette newspaper, 8 and 10 November 1942. Khan's legacy was challenged when Malik Khizar Hyat refused to comply with League demands in 1944, leading Jinnah to repeal the Sikandar-Jinnah Pact from 1937. Trying to yoke together an impossible 'political mosaic'Letter, Lord Linlithgow to Sir Leo Amery, 28 December 1942, British Library/IOR, Accession No. L/1/1/1427 took a drastic toll on Khan's health, probably resulting in his early fatality. In a letter from Viceroy Linlithgow to Sir Leo Amery dated two days after Khan's death, the Viceroy offered a lengthy personal evaluation of Khan: Khan died on the night between 25/26 December 1942, of a sudden heart failure, at his home. He is buried at the footsteps of the Badshahi Masjid in Lahore.Dr Iftikhar H. Malik, Sir Sikandar Hayat: A Political Biography, p. 97.

Definitions Europeanisation in political science has been referred to very generally as 'becoming more European like'.Tovias, A., ‚ÄúSpontaneous vs. legal approximation: The Europeanization of Israel‚Äù, European Journal of Law Reform, 2007, vol. 9, no. 3, pp. 485-500 More specifically than this, it has been defined in a number of ways. One of the earliest conceptualisations of the term is by Ladrech (1994, 69), who defines Europeanisation simply as ‚Äòan incremental process of re-orienting the direction and shape of politics to the extent that EC political and economic dynamics become part of the organisational logic of national politics and policy making.‚Äô This emphasises what is known as the 'top-down approach' to Europeanisation, in which change emanates from the impact of the Union on the national policy. The state is viewed as reactive to actions of the Union. Another definition that needs to be taken into account is from Radaelli, who describes Europeanisation as \\"a process involving a) construction, b) diffusion and c) institutionalisation of formal and informal rules, procedures, policy paradigms, styles, 'ways of doing things' and shared beliefs and norms which are first defined and consolidated in the EU policy process and then incorporated in the logic of domestic (national and subnational) discourse, political structures and public choices.\\"Michelle Cini, European Union Politics 2nd Edition (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007) p. 407. More recently, Moumoutzis (2011: 612) has revised Radaelli's definition, arguing that Europeanisation should be defined as 'a process of incorporation in the logic of domestic (national and sub- national) discourse, political structures and public policies of formal and informal rules, procedures, policy paradigms, styles, ‚Äúways of doing things‚Äù and shared beliefs and norms that are first defined in the EU policy processes'. From a 'bottom-up' approach Europeanisation occurs when states begin to affect the policy of the European Union in a given area. A more nuanced analysis posits that the institutional interaction of policy actors at the various levels of European governance leads to the re-definition of national, regional and other identities within a European context, where the multiple levels of governance in Europe are not seen as necessarily in opposition to one another.Robert Harmsen & Thomas M. Wilson (ed.s), Europeanization: Institution, Identities and Citizenship, (Atlanta: Rodopi, 2000) . An elected representative can, for example, see his loyalties and responsibilities as lying with Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, and Europe, or with Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Europe, for unitary states. Some scholars, including Samuel Huntington,Samuel Huntington, The Clash of Civilizations, Foreign Affairs, 1993. argue that citizens of European states increasingly identify themselves as such, rather than Portuguese, British, French, German, Italian, etc. An obvious area of change is in the institutions of Europe; the enlargement of the European Union and the gradual acquisition of authority over the national member governments in numerous areas is creating a centralised European polity. The Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union would be an example of this; in this case, the nations using the euro have passed control of their monetary policy to the European Central Bank. Another perspective of Europeanisation is the 'horizontal approach.' This approach takes into account the transfer of politics, policies and policy making between member states of the European Union. The transfer is based on a form of 'soft law' ‚Äî it is not enforceable but based on 'best practice' and mutual recognition. Whether Europeanisation is a continuing process that will eventually lead to a full European government or whether centralisation will be unable to overcome persisting national identities and/or increasing interest in localism is a matter of some debate.

History  =Early history= Once known as the Common Settlement, the area later known as Dogtown is divided between the city of Gloucester and the town of Rockport. Dogtown was first settled in 1693, and according to legend the name of the settlement came from dogs that women kept while their husbands were fighting in the American Revolution. The community grew to be 5 square miles, and was an ideal location as it provided protection from pirates, and enemy natives. By the early 1700s, the land was opened up to individual settlement as previously it had been used as common land for wood and pasturing cattle and sheep. It is estimated that at one point 60 to 80 homes stood in Dogtown at its peak population. In the mid-1700s as many as 100 families inhabited Dogtown which was stable until after the American Revolution. =Decline= Various factors led to the demise of Dogtown which included a revived fishing industry from Gloucester Harbor after the American Revolution had ended. The area had become safe again from enemy ships which allowed cargo to move in and out of the new fishing port. The success gave way to international shipping, including timber, and quarried rock. New coastal roads were built that also contributed to the Dogtown's demise as they ran past the town to Gloucester which at the time was booming. Most of the farmers in the town moved away by the end of the War of 1812 as Dogtown had become a risk for coastal bombardment. Dogtown eventually became an embarrassment with its dwindled reputation, and some of its last occupants were suspected of practicing witchcraft. One such inhabitant named Thomazine \\"Tammy\\" Younger was described as \\"Queen of the Witches\\" by Thomas Dresser. She intimidated people passing through so much that they left her fish and corn to allow them through. Another reputed witch associated with Dogtown was a woman named Peg Wesson, but she in fact had lived in Gloucester. As the last inhabitants died, their pets became feral, possibly giving rise to the nickname \\"Dogtown.\\" By 1828 the village was all but abandoned. The last resident of Dogtown was a freedman named Cornelius \\"Black Neil\\" Finson, who was found in 1830 with his feet frozen living in a cellar-hole. He was removed and taken to a poor house in Gloucester. The last structure in Dogtown was razed in 1845, ending what had once been a thriving community. =Open grazing land= After its abandonment, Dogtown was a mostly cleared open field with abundant boulders around. Nearby residents looked towards this land as a way to graze their farm animals. These animals were kept in private lots into the 1920s when the last of the plots were abandoned. In the decades that followed what was once open land eventually became a dense forest. =Babson Boulders= Most of the area of Dogtown is now a dense woodland, criss-crossed and bisected by trails and old roads. Dogtown Road off of Cherry Street in the western section (the Gloucester side) is lined with the remains of the cellar holes of the settlers, many of which are numbered in correspondence with names from John J. Babson's book of the history of Gloucester. Babson's grandson, Roger Babson, is known for, among other things, his commissioning of unemployed stonecutters to carve inspirational inscriptions on 36 boulders in Dogtown during the Great Depression. Babson also mapped and numbered the cellar holes left from the homes of Dogtown's former residents. Most of the land is held in trust by Gloucester and Rockport and is therefore protected in perpetuity. The current state of Dogtown affords rich recreation opportunities to hikers and bikers, dog-walkers, nature lovers, cross-country skiers, geologists and historians. The area is peppered with house-sized boulders, including one named \\"The Whale's Jaw,\\" which it resembled before collapsing after a picnic campfire got out of control in 1989. The northwest corner of Dogtown is known as the Norton Memorial forest and covers 121 acres. This land is named for Frederick Norton, a NASA physicist and MIT professor whose family owned land on the outskirts of Dogtown. Beginning in the 1930s, Norton planted more than a 100,000 trees and forty different species of ferns there, and also forged and maintained trails nearby.East, Elyssa.

Its native range stretches from tropical southern North America to northern South America. The name \\"manchineel\\" (sometimes spelled \\"manchioneel\\" or \\"manchineal\\"), as well as the specific epithet mancinella, is from Spanish manzanilla (\\"little apple\\"), from the superficial resemblance of its fruit and leaves to those of an apple tree. It is also known as the beach apple. A present-day Spanish name is ''''', \\"little apple of death\\". This refers to the fact that manchineel is one of the most toxic trees in the world: the tree has milky-white sap which contains numerous toxins and can cause blistering. The sap is present in every part of the tree: the bark, the leaves, and the fruit.Dean, Signe (21 February 2020) \\"This Tree Is So Toxic, You Can't Even Stand Under It When It Rains\\" Science Alert Distribution Manchineel is native to the Caribbean, the U.S.; in the state of Florida, The Bahamas, Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. The manchineel tree can be found on coastal beaches and in brackish swamps, where it grows among mangroves. It provides excellent natural windbreaks and its roots stabilize the sand, thus retarding beach erosion. Description Hippomane mancinella, the evergreen manchineel tree, grows up to tall. It has reddish-greyish bark, small greenish-yellow flowers, and shiny green leaves. The leaves are simple, alternate, very finely serrated or toothed, and long. Spikes of small greenish flowers are followed by fruits, which are similar in appearance to an apple, are green or greenish-yellow when ripe. The fruit is poisonous, as is every other part of the tree. =Toxicity= All parts of the tree contain strong toxins. Its milky white sap contains phorbol and other skin irritants, producing strong allergic contact dermatitis. Standing beneath the tree during rain will cause blistering of the skin from mere contact with this liquid: even a small drop of rain with the milky substance in it will cause the skin to blister. The sap has also been known to damage the paint on cars. Burning the tree may cause ocular injuries if the smoke reaches the eyes. Contact with its milky sap (latex) produces bullous dermatitis, acute keratoconjunctivitis and possibly large corneal epithelial defects. Although the fruit is potentially fatal if eaten, no such occurrences have been reported in the modern literature. Ingestion can produce severe gastroenteritis with bleeding, shock, and bacterial superinfection, as well as the potential for airway compromise due to edema. When ingested, the fruit is reportedly \\"pleasantly sweet\\" at first, with a subsequent \\"strange peppery feeling ... gradually progress[ing] to a burning, tearing sensation and tightness of the throat.\\" Symptoms continue to worsen until the patient can \\"barely swallow solid food because of the excruciating pain and the feeling of a huge obstructing pharyngeal lump.\\" In some parts of its range, many trees carry a warning sign - for example on Cura√ßao - while others are marked with a red \\"X\\" on the trunk to indicate danger. In the French Antilles the trees are often marked with a painted red band a few feet above the ground. Although the plant is toxic to many birds and other animals, the black-spined iguana (Ctenosaura similis) is known to eat the fruit and even live among the limbs of the tree. The tree contains 12-deoxy-5-hydroxyphorbol-6-gamma-7-alpha- oxide, hippomanins, mancinellin, and sapogenin, phloracetophenone-2,4-dimethylether is present in the leaves, while the fruits possess physostigmine. A poultice of arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) was used by the Arawak and Ta√≠no as an antidote against such poisons. The Caribs were known to poison the water supply of their enemies with the leaves. Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le√≥n died shortly after an injury incurred in battle with the Calusa in Florida‚Äîbeing struck by an arrow that had been poisoned with manchineel sap. =Usage= Despite the inherent dangers associated with handling it, the tree has been used as a source of wood by Caribbean furniture makers for centuries. It must be cut and left to dry in the sun to remove the sap. A gum can be produced from the bark which reportedly treats edema, while the dried fruits have been used as a diuretic. Conservation The manchineel tree is listed as an endangered species in Florida.

It was founded in Toru≈Ñ, Poland, on December 9, 1991, by the Redemptorist Tadeusz Rydzyk. The name \\"Maryja\\" is a traditional Polish form of the name \\"Mary\\", referring to the Virgin Mary. Programming and audience Radio Maryja's programmes consist of broadcasts from the station's news agency; frequent recitals of the rosary, the breviary, and the Chaplet of the Divine Mercy; the unction to the Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa; discussions on the Catechism of the Catholic Church; a daily transmission of the Mass; coverage of papal trips; and sociological and political programmes. It takes positions against feminism, gay rights, the ‚ÄúIslamisation‚Äù of Europe, Middle Eastern refugees and the EU, and promotes social conservatism. Radio Maryja's audience is reputed to consist mostly of rural and elderly listeners. The station says that it has \\"millions of listeners\\"; market research indicates approximately 1.2 million people daily. The station estimates that it is listened to by well over 10% of adults in Poland; the most comprehensive market research by Radio Track for the whole of Poland (June‚ÄìJuly 2005) shows a 2.5% \\"share of listening time\\". The Economist has summarized that, \\"The church in Poland is divided between Vatican loyalists, who often oppose close involvement in politics, and energetic dissidents linked to Radio Maryja, a hardline broadcaster. This once had huge clout, articulating the feelings of Poles alienated by the country's brisk, materialist business culture and the decay in moral norms. But Radio Maryja's audience has shrunk in the past decade to no more than 2% of all current listeners.\\" Ownership and finances The Radio Maryja headquarters in Toru≈Ñ. Statue of John Paul II in front of the Radio Maryja headquarters, by Giennadij Jerszow 2014. The station is owned by the Warsaw Province of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, and is financed through donations from its audience. This is an unusual characteristic in Poland, where most radio stations are either publicly funded or dependent on advertising revenue. Due to a concordat with the Holy See that grants certain privileges to the Church, Radio Maryja is not bound by normal accounting rules as it is regarded as being Church-operated. Thus, Radio Maryja is not required to disclose the exact sources of its financing or enterprises, and does not pay taxes. Radio Maryja has disclosed that it is financed by Jan Kobyla≈Ñski, a Uruguay-based billionaireIPN - review of the media and by Edward Moskal, the chairman of the Polish American Congress.Radio Maryja - Katolicki G≈Ços w Twoim Domu In February 2011, the local district court of Toru≈Ñ issued a fine of 3,500 zlotys to Fr Rydzyk, finding that he illegally used Radio Maryja broadcasts to raise funds for his television station, Telewizja Trwam; his University of Social and Media Culture; and a geothermal drilling project run by Fundacja Lux Veritatus. Fr Rydzyk denounced the verdict, calling it an \\"injustice\\" and saying that Polish law ran \\"contrary to natural law.\\" To date, he has refused to pay the fine. In August 2012, a political controversy transpired when Anna Sobecka, a Law and Justice MP and close ally of Rydzyk's, applied to pay the fine from her own pocket despite not having the authorization to do so. The district court of Toru≈Ñ requested that the police investigate her action. Later in 2012 Radio Maryja was fined by the National Broadcasting Council for ‚Äúhidden advertising‚Äù.More mess for Radio Maryja , New Poland Express, 6th April 2012 Enterprises related to Radio Maryja include the television station Trwam (\\"I Persist\\"); a daily newspaper Nasz Dziennik (\\"Our Daily\\"); the Nasza Przysz≈Ço≈õƒá (\\"Our Future\\") Foundation; the Lux Veritatis Foundation (\\"The Light of Truth Foundation\\"); and the Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Kultury Spo≈Çecznej i Medialnej (\\"The College of Social and Media Culture\\") in Toru≈Ñ. Criticisms and controversies Radio Maryja sparked many controversies and is frequently being criticized both in Poland and abroad.Controversial Catholic Radio Maryja enters politics , Radio Polonia, 05.01.2007 Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, the former secretary general of the Episcopate of Poland, said that Radio Maryja is \\"a real and growing problem\\", adding that the station \\"offers a reduced view on Christianity\\" that is \\"extremely compromising and shameful, sick and dangerous.\\" =Reaction from religious institutions= The Holy See expressed concern over the station, with the Episcopate of Poland warning Radio Maryja about engaging in \\"political broadcasting\\".Episcopate warns Radio Maryja on 'political broadcasting‚Äô , Polskie Radio, January 1, 2007 Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz of Krak√≥w and the country's then Primate, Cardinal J√≥zef Glemp, have urged fellow bishops to take immediate action against the station. In 2002, the Primate ordered Radio Maryja to close its operations in his archdiocese. Press commentators suggested that a schism could occur, but a group of Polish bishops rejected those speculations, which they said \\"bore no relation to reality\\". In 2005, Cardinal J√≥zef Glemp said that Radio Maryja was causing a rift in the Church.Poland's Primate lambasts Radio Maryja In 2006, the papal nuncio to Poland, Archbishop J√≥zef Kowalczyk, wrote to Polish bishops requesting their aid \\"to overcome difficulties caused by some transmissions and the views presented by Radio Maryja.\\" He also warned of sanctions against activity ‚Äúconsidered unlawful or damaging to the Church‚Äù. According to the official Vatican web page, \\"Radio Maryja, a nation-wide radio system organised by the Redemptorist Fathers, became much more involved in spreading risky politics than in spreading the Gospel.\\" Pope Benedict XVI warned Radio Maryja to quit engaging in politics.Polish Populists: Papal Reprimand for Catholic Radio, Spiegel , 2006 The Polish bishops remain divided over Radio Maryja, given its considerable influence among its primary audience of the elderly rural poor.Polish Cardinal condemns priest accused of anti-Semitism on radio , Voice of America, September 5, 2007 While some bishops have criticized Radio Maryja for spreading opinions incompatible with the official teaching of the Catholic Church, http://www.warsawvoice.pl/archiwum.phtml/2123/ others voice support for the station.Poland‚Äôs Radio Maryja Known For Its Bigotry, and Its Influence, The Jewish Daily Forward , 2010Cardinal calls for sacking of radio priest, The Tablet, 2007 Critics say that the Polish bishops have been divided over Radio Maryja for a long time.

In January 2000, Radio Maryja aired an interview between Ryszard Bender, a historian from the Catholic University of Lublin, and Dariusz Ratajczak, a convicted Holocaust denier who said that Auschwitz was a labor camp rather than an extermination camp.

According to a U.S. State Department report from 2008, \\"Radio Maryja is one of Europe‚Äôs most blatantly anti-Semitic media venues.\\"Contemporary Global Anti-Semitism , a report provided to the United States Congress, U.S. Dept. of State, March 13, 2008 A report of the Council of Europe stated that Radio Maryja has been \\"openly inciting to antisemitism for several years.\\"Poland_CBC_3 In 2011 the Polish Broadcasting Authority Commission examined two programs on Radio Maryja and reprimanded the station for its antisemitic statements and \\"nationalistic racism\\".Accusations of antisemitism on Radio Maryja , CFCA The Simon Wiesenthal Center initiated a petition condemning Radio Maryja's alleged anti- Semitic statements.See a video of Rabbi Marvin Hier talking about the \\"Jew- hating\\" Father Rydzyk In January 2017, a report published by the Anti- Defamation League in the U.S. accused Radio Maryja of \\"25 years of anti- Semitism\\". In 2017, Rydzyk ‚Äì with the help of the head of the From The Depths foundation Jonny Daniels ‚Äì invited a group of Israeli politicians, including Knesset Deputy Speaker Yehiel Bar and Israeli Minister of Communications Ayoub Kara), to a Radio Maryja commemorative ceremony in the city of Torun devoted to the theme of \\"Remembrance and Hope\\". The event was held in the Chapel of Remembrance, situated in the Temple of Our Lady the Star of New Evangelization and St. John Paul II and was ostensibly held to honor Polish Righteous Among the Nations who had saved Jews from the German death camps during World War II. The visit of the Israeli delegation came under strong attack by some commentators, notably in the Israeli media, who accused the members of the delegation of turning a blind eye to Radio Maryja's and its director's long history of antisemitism.. =Involvement in politics= Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski, the former Prime Minister of Poland, was a regular guest on Radio Maryja,Poland: Democracy and the Challenge of Extremism as were other rightist or far-right politicians such as Andrzej Lepper, Roman Giertych, and Zbigniew Ziobro. When it became aware of the station's service to conservative parties, the Holy See demanded that it \\"drop the politics.\\" Asked whether Fr Rydzyk would himself form a party, Bishop Pieronek replied that he could not imagine a priest starting a political organization.Warsaw Voice - Wa≈Çƒôsa at War Pieronek drew an analogy saying that Hitler also took advantage of religion for his political purposes with the use of the motto \\"Gott mit uns\\".Bishop Attacks PiS , Newzar Radio Maryja strongly opposed Poland joining the European Union in 2004. The station promoted the political program of the Law and Justice party, which together with Lech Kaczy≈Ñski sought to introduce capital punishment in Poland and throughout Europe. Support for the death penalty contrasts strongly with the mainstream teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. In February 2006, Law and Justice signed a key agreement with two other political parties. To the fury of the Polish press, only Rydzyk and journalists from Telewizja Trwam ‚Äì who actively supported Law and Justice during the election ‚Äì were allowed in the room during the signing. The President of the Polish National Broadcasting Council, El≈ºbieta Kruk, stated that she had no authority to act in regard to these complaints, as she had been appointed by the Polish President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, a member of Law and Justice. Critics asserted that the government feared alienating Radio Maryja's dedicated audience, which makes up a significant fraction of Law and Justice's political base. In March 2006, Polish literary critic and television personality Kazimiera Szczuka satirized a girl who frequently recites prayers on Radio Maryja, not knowing that the girl used a wheelchair. Despite Szczuka's public apology, the Polish Broadcasting Council found her guilty of \\"insulting a disabled person and mocking her religion.\\" The station on which she had appeared was fined the equivalent of $125,000; according to the Polish press, the highest fine the Council had ever levied. The sole dissenting member of the Council, Wojciech Dziomdziora, speculated that Radio Maryja's ties with Law and Justice was \\"the real reason\\" for Szczuka's punishment, noting that Szczuka was made to pay the stiff fine while Radio Maryja was allowed to disparage other religions with impunity. Following international criticism in 2006, the Holy See‚Äôs Warsaw Nuncio, Archbishop J√≥zef Kowalczyk, with respect to the stations's involvement in politics, called on the Polish bishops to ensure that the station respected ‚Äúthe appropriate autonomy of the public sphere‚Äù. Poland's bishops‚Äô conference fashioned an agreement whereby it would assume partial control of a new programme council at Radio Maryja. In September 2012, Radio Maryja and TV Trwam organized a \\"Poland awake!\\" demonstration with Law and Justice to protest the centrist government's purported attempt to silence both stations by not including them on the country's digital television multiplex. The demonstration led to renewed criticism of the station's politicized message from high-ranking Catholic clergymen. Bishop Piotr Jarecki, a vice president in the Commission of the Bishops' Conferences of the European Community, said in an interview that the stations' action was \\"not in accordance with the doctrine of the Church,\\" and said that they were \\"entering a dangerous path of confusion and turmoil.\\"Biskup Piotr Jarecki wystƒÖpi≈Ç przeciwko PiS i TV Trwam .\\" Dziennik. 25 October 2012 =Remarks about President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski and wife= In 2007, Polish first lady Maria Kaczy≈Ñska met with fifty female journalists for International Women's Day; the women signed a statement to protest a tightening of Poland's already strict abortion laws. Rydzyk caused controversy when he described the meeting as a \\"cesspool\\". Later, the newsmagazine Wprost published a recording from one of Rydzyk's lectures in which he allegedly called Kaczy≈Ñska \\"a witch who should perform euthanasia on herself.\\" He also said that President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski \\"cheated\\" him, and called him \\"a swindler who had bowed to pressure from the Jewish lobby.\\" Rydzyk suggested the tapes were doctored and called the story \\"fictitious\\". Archbishop Jozef Michalik said that no disciplinary action would be taken against the director of Radio Maryja: \\"You can't judge a person from just one statement, or on the basis of some lack of tact.\\" In 2012, Radio Maryja, which has long criticized Freemasonry, broadcast an interview saying that the plane crash which killed President Kaczy≈Ñski two years earlier ‚Äì among \\"many other acts\\" ‚Äì was the result of a Masonic plot against the Law and Justice party.Ekspert ojca Rydzyka: Smole≈Ñsk to akt mason√≥w! , Fakt.pl, 27 August 2012 [Retrieved 1 September 2012] Supporters and their response to criticism Enthusiasts of the station say that Radio Maryja is a target of the media which have waged a \\"smear campaign\\"Radio Maryja as the target of the media , Sunday - Catholic Magazine, \\"Niedziela\\" 17/2006 and that bigoted statements transmitted by the station are very rare and originate from its listeners rather than employees. The former cabinet of Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski openly supported Radio Maryja. In December 2006, Kaczy≈Ñski joined the 15th anniversary celebrations of Radio Maryja and praised the station as a source of \\"comfort and hope\\". Support for Radio Maryja is often voiced in \\"Nasz Dziennik\\", which is related to the station.

The term MOO is used in two distinct, but related, senses. One is to refer to those programs descended from the original MOO server, and the other is to refer to any MUD that uses object-oriented techniques to organize its database of objects, particularly if it does so in a similar fashion to the original MOO or its derivatives. Most of this article refers to the original MOO and its direct descendants, but see Non-Descendant MOOs for a list of MOO-like systems. The original MOO server was authored by Stephen White, based on his experience from creating the programmable TinyMUCK system. There was additional later development and maintenance from LambdaMOO founder, and former Xerox PARC employee, Pavel Curtis. One of the most distinguishing features of a MOO is that its users can perform object-oriented programming within the server, ultimately expanding and changing how the server behaves to everyone. Examples of such changes include authoring new rooms and objects, creating new generic objects for others to use, and changing the way the MOO interface operates. The programming language used for extension is the MOO programming language, and many MOOs feature convenient libraries of verbs that can be used by programmers in their coding known as Utilities. The MOO programming language is a domain-specific programming language.  Background  MOOs are network accessible, multi-user, programmable, interactive systems well-suited to the construction of text-based adventure games, conferencing systems, and other collaborative software. Their most common use, however, is as multi- participant, low-bandwidth virtual realities. They have been used in academic environments for distance education, collaboration (such as Diversity University), group decision systems,Evard, R. (1993, November) Collaborative networked communication: MUDS as systems tools. Proceedings of the Seventh Systems Administration Conference (LISA VII), pp. 1-8, Monterey, CA. and teaching object-oriented concepts;Towell, JF (2000) MOO: An active-learning environment for teaching object-oriented concepts in business information systems curricula, Journal of Information Systems Education, 11(304) 147-150. but others are primarily social in nature, or used for role-playing video games, or simply to take advantage of the programming possibilities. They have also been used in scientific studies of virtual presence.Towell, JF, & Towell, ER (1997). Presence in text-based networked virtual environments or \\"MUDS,\\" Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments 6(5) 590-595.Shiano, DJ (1999). Lessons from LambdaMOO: A social, text-based virtual environment, Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments 8(2), 127-139 article .Towell, JF & Towell, ER (2001) 34th Meetings of the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Science (HICSS-34), Maui, Hawaii. Most commonly, MOOs are connected to by users using a client which speaks the telnet protocol, which provides a stay-alive connection with the host, to relay output and send commands. Some however have developed web interfaces, or other such methods; however this commonly limits interaction that the user can have, usually to the point they have no interaction, but instead can browse objects and discover typical information. Developments in cross-MOO networking have also led to the creation of SunNET, a hubless network allowing cross-MOO communication and add extra possibilities to cross-MOO development, including networked channels. Another network called GNA-NET, designed by Gustavo Glusman of BioMOO connected seventeen mostly education sites. Most of these MOOs hosted online classes or other early versions of distance education. Every MOO stores the content and state of all its objects within a persistent object database, which keeps objects from being lost by a reset of the MOO server software or the computer hosting it. New MOOs have to choose a starting database from which to set their MOO up, or they can use a minimal one which contains only the necessary objects to start a MOO. There are a handful of such MOO \\"core\\" databases which serve as foundations of code and utilities from which to start your MOO, including LambdaCore (from LambdaMOO), MinimalDB (considered the minimum necessary code and utilities to work usefully in a MOO), JHCore (from Jay's House Moo), and enCore (from LinguaMOO). Every object in the MOO is assigned a number, and may be referred to by this number, prefixed with a #, as well as its name when the user is in the object's presence. Administrators, also known as Wizards, who can manage the MOO, and assign certain global names to these objects, which are prefixed with $, a process known as corifying. They also feature parenting systems, and every object will have a parent, commonly eventually leading to Root Class, otherwise known as #1. #0 is also reserved as a special system object which is responsible for managing the list of global names, incoming network connections, and other information related to the operation of the system.  History  MOO, along with all of its nephews, started out with text based adventure games. With the advent of the internet, MUD was formed as a networked version of one of those games. Eventually it developed into a tree of different types of MUD, with MOO becoming one of them. Stephen White (also known by the handles \\"Ghondahrl\\" and \\"ghond\\") wrote the first version of the MOO server, which was released on May 2, 1990, and used for the operation of a server called \\"AlphaMOO\\". Pavel Curtis, an employee of Xerox PARC and also known by his handles \\"Lambda\\", and \\"Haakon\\", took the basic design, language, and code, fixed bugs and added features to release the second version, called \\"LambdaMOO\\" on October 30, 1990. According to Jill Serpentelli in her paper Conversational Structure and Personality Correlates of Electronic Communication: :Curtis went on to explain how the transition occurred from AlphaMOO to LambdaMOO. After fixing bugs in the system, rewriting some of the code, adding more programming capability, and writing documentation, he had created what he termed \\"a truly separate entity\\" from the original AlphaMOO. He dubbed this new system LambdaMOO, after one of his names on the system and, according to Curtis, \\"because it's a key word in some of the other non-mud research that I do.\\" The new system was announced as open for public access on UseNet (a world-wide bulletin board system) in February 1991 (Curtis, personal communication). MOO was originally developed as a MUD server in the same general style (sharing much of the command syntax and community conventions) as TinyMUD. There are currently two distributions of the MOO server code. The more popular of the two, the LambdaMOO server, is named such as indication of the close historical and continuing association of the MOO server code with the first public MOO, LambdaMOO. It is this LambdaMOO version of MOO that gained popularity in the early 1990s, and it remains the most widely used distribution of MOO. Pavel Curtis continued to maintain the server for several years. Other early contributors to the LambdaMOO server included users Tim Allen (\\"Gemba\\"), \\"Gary_Severn\\", Roger Crew (\\"Rog\\"), Judy Anderson (\\"yduJ\\"), and Erik Ostrom (known as \\"Joe Feedback\\"). Later, Erik Ostrom maintained the server, and the server is now maintained by Ben Jackson and Jay Carlson and has a LambdaMOO SourceForge.net project. =Social behavior on MOOs= Behavior on social MOOs and role-playing MOOs has been shown to differ. For example, an early study looked at whether users engaged in gender-switching (that is, adopting a different gender online). The majority of participants (60 percent) in social MOOs had never engaged in gender-switching, while the majority (56.7 percent) in role-playing MOOs had done so. However, most of those engaged in gender-switching did so on average only 10 percent of the time. The study also found that the primary barrier to gender-switching was the belief that it is dishonest and manipulative.  Current projects based on MOO  * Stunt is a backward compatible fork of the latest MOO server code. It adds multiple inheritance, anonymous objects, native HTTP support, JSON parsing and generation, a native map datatype, and better cryptography primitives. * Codepoint is an effort to extend LambdaMOO to support Unicode characters. Originally the project was started by H. Peter Anvin using libucd, a small library that implements features of the Unicode Character Database without being unwieldy. The project is now being developed by James C. Deikun, Robert Leslie, and Kenny Root with the goal of eventually integrating it into the main LambdaMOO distribution. * ToastStunt is a fork of the Stunt server intended primarily to add new features. These include 64-bit integers, SQLite support, Perl-compatible regular expressions, background threaded functions, Argon2id hashing, telnet IAC capturing, profiling support, performance improvements, and dozens of additional built-in functions and improvements.  Non-descendant MOOs  Some servers use \\"MOO\\" style object-oriented characteristics without being descended from the original MOO server, in the sense that they use little or none of that server's source code and use internal languages that are more or less incompatible with the MOO programming language. None of them have attained the popularity of LambdaMOO or its relatives. Stephen White went on to write a new and similar system called CoolMUD, although it never obtained the same wide userbase as MOO. Another, later, attempt at a programmable object-oriented MUD server was ColdMUD, written by Greg Hudson and later maintained by Brandon Gillespie under the name \\"Genesis\\". One unusual MOO with no real relationship to the original MOO is called mooix. mooix is unique among MUDs in that it uses the underlying UNIX operating system to handle all of the multitasking and networking issues. Several unique side effects result from this, one of which is that the MOO can be programmed in any language. mooix was written after a failed attempt by Joey Hess to write a MOO entirely in Perl, called perlmoo. There are a number of MOOs written in Python, including POO, MOOP and ErisMUD. MOO is often used in programming games, such as PointSet.  Access  Participants (usually referred to as users) connect to a MOO using telnet or some other, more specialized, client program. Upon connection, they are usually presented with a welcome message explaining how to either create a new character or connect to an existing one. Almost every command is parsed by the server into a call on a MOO procedure, or verb, which actually does the work. Thus, programming in the MOO programming language is a central part of making non-trivial extensions to the database and hence the virtual reality.  Administration  All MOOs provide a flag called Wizard; when set on a player, the player gains the ability to view and modify nearly everything in the MOOs database. Such players are called Wizards, and usually form the basis for MOO administration. Designated owners of a MOO are sometimes referred to as Archwizards. These wizards can restrict access to the MOO, as well as make news postings and monitor logs. Wizard permissions are needed for modification and even execution of verbs and properties for which the user does not own, or is not publicly readable/writable. All verbs and properties within objects have the appropriate flags, with the user can change to determine its current state. They can also assign global names to any object. Builders are players who are given the limited ability to create objects and areas in a MOO, whereas programmers can also program on the MOO.  Notable examples  =Social MOOS= * LambdaMOO was created alongside the server, and has continued despite server development having slowed. It was the first public MOO. * JaysHouseMOO was a social MOO started by Jay Carlson at Minnesota State University at Mankato in 1992. It had the first gopher server implemented in MOO language. It was also noted by Netscape as having a web server as well. During the 90's, it was considered the hangout of the MOO programmer elite. Notable among them were former and current LambdaMOO code maintainers Roger Crew, Erik Ostrom, Jay Carlson, and Ben Jackson. * ' (The Digital Subway) founded in 1994 as part of De Digitale Stad (The Digital City of Amsterdam) and one of the first Dutch MOOs. * BayMOO is a social MOO founded in October 1993. It is based on loosely on San Francisco and its surrounding areas. For part of its life it was hosted at SFSU. BayMOO also hosted FactoryNet a custom MOO for NIST. In December 1994 it was one of the MOOs chosen to host Aerosmith's four-day \\"Cyberspace Tour\\" which was co-sponsored by EFF. Earlier that year it had also hosted a meeting of the Cypherpunks. Part of SunNET and GNA-NET intermoo networks. * IDMOO is a New York-based MOO that was started by some programmers from LambdaMOO and PMCMOO who felt that MOO spaces were becoming too dominated by societal conventions developed for nonvirtual spaces. IDMOO was online for several years in the late 1990s and is notable for having hosted an early virtual BDSM community and the Plaintext Players. * SchoolNet MOO started in the mid 1990s and was funded by SchoolNet until 1998, when it was renamed to MOO Canada, Eh? SchoolNet MOO was particularly popular in the Ottawa, Canada region due to its use by Virtual Ventures at Carleton University, and a member of Actua (known as YES-VACC at these times) as a computer programming educational platform for youths of ages 8‚Äì18.\\"SchoolNetMOO Lesson Plan\\" 14 August 1998 =Research MOOs= * MediaMOO is designed for professional media researchers now hosted at Northern Illinois University's Department of English. It was originally created in 1993 by Amy Bruckman at the Epistemology and Learning Group at the MIT Media Lab. In its heyday around 1996, MediaMOO had over 1000 members, was governed by an elected council, and hosted frequent meetings, including the Tuesday Cafe, a weekly discussion of members of the Computers and Writing community. It is still accessible, though largely inactive, and is no longer supervised by Bruckman. =Educational MOOs= * Diversity University, the first dedicated educational MOO, created by Jeanne McWhorter in 1993. *Postmodern Culture MOO (PMC2 or PMCMOO) was a MOO hosted by the Institute for Advanced Technologies in the Humanities (IATH) at University of Virginia that was very active in the mid-1990s. It featured discussions of postmodern culture within elaborately programmed spaces, including a segment of Nighttown from James Joyce's novel Ulysses. Some archives remain online.PMC2 Archives * ', a constructionist learning educational MOO designed for teaching children ages 9 to 13. It was developed by Amy S. Bruckman in 1996 as her doctoral dissertation work, and cited among \\"the most notable MOO research in education\\". It closed in 2007 after 11 years online. * BioMOO was a professional MOO started by Gustavo Glusman and Jaime Prilusky at the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1993. It was a virtual place for Biology researchers to meet to brainstorm, hold colloquia and conferences, and explore the serious side of MOOs as a medium. These professional activities were recognized in an article entitled \\"Cyberspace Offers Chance To Do 'Virtually' Real Science\\" published in the journal Science.Anderson, Christopher \\"Cyberspace Offers Chance To Do 'Virtually' Real Science\\" 264, 900-901, Science, 1994.

Prilusky and Glusman also released in 1994 the File Utilities Package, a MOO server modification enabling direct but controlled access to the underlying file system. Glusman also developed the intermoo GNA Network. * LinguaMOO is an educational MOO dedicated to general studies of arts and humanities, created in 1995 by Cynthia Haynes of the University of Texas at Dallas and Jan Rune Holmevik of the University of Bergen. Many educational MOOs use the enCore system, derived from LinguaMOO, for their MOO database core.

He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Tennessee in Physical Education. Vega has served a school administrator for the West New York School District. Since 1987, he has been Athletic Director for his alma mater, Memorial High School.Hudson County Freeholder - District 7: Silverio A. Vega , Hudson County, New Jersey. Accessed January 12, 2008. Vega had served as a Legislative Aide to New Jersey State Senator Bernard Kenny. Previously, Vega had been appointed to the Board of Adjustments and the Rent Control Board by the Town of West New York, and to the Board of Trustees of the Hudson County Schools of Technology (formerly Hudson County Vocational-Technical). Vega was a Commissioner for the Town of West New York, serving as Public Safety Director from 1995 until 2006. Previously, Vega was the director of the Department of Revenue & Finance, from 1991 to 1995. After Albio Sires was elected to fill the seat in New Jersey's 13th congressional district that had been vacated by Bob Menendez, Sires stepped down from his positions as Mayor of West New York and in the General Assembly, where he represented the 33rd legislative district. Vega was chosen to replace Sires as mayor of West New York. The Democratic district committee voted on November 21, 2006 to choose Vega to replace Sires in the Assembly, with Vega taking office on December 11, 2006.\\"Vega is eager for challenge in WNY, Trenton\\", Jersey Journal, November 28, 2006 =Freeholder= Chairman Vega represented the freeholder interests for the Hudson County Schools of Technology as a Member of the Hudson County Board of School Estimate, and for the Community College as a Member of the Hudson County Community College Board of School Estimate. He also serves as Chairman of the following committees: Finance, Budget and Administration; Insurance Commission; Public Safety and Department of Corrections; and as Alternate on the New Jersey Association of Counties (NJAC). He serves as a Member on the Economic Development and Housing Committee. Before being named to the Assembly, Vega represented District 7 on the Hudson County, New Jersey Board of Chosen Freeholders. District 7 includes the Town of Guttenberg, the Township of Weehawken and the Town of West New York.

Dr. Roque's movement, also known as the \\"Together We Can\\" campaign,Roque, Dr. Felix. Together We Can, accessed May 11, 2011. was given a period of 160 days to collect signatures from 25% of the registered voter population. Together We Can Pending a successful recall petition, Dr. Roque intended to run against Mayor Vega during the upcoming Mayoral elections.Gibson, Denise. \\"Papers filed with West New York clerk to recall Vega, 4 others\\", NJ.com, June 9, 2009 Roque was spurred to this action by the town's high taxes.Sanabria, Santo. \\"Roque slate wins by large margin\\", The Union City Reporter, May 15, 2011, Pages 1 and 7. On April 27, 2010, official court proceedings began regarding the case of Committee To Recall Silverio A. Vega; Gerald A Lange; Lawrence Riccardi; Alberto Rodriguez, Michelle Fernandez-Lopez From The Office Of Commissioner Against Carmela Riccie, In The Capacity Of Recall Election Official of The Town Of West New York. During the first day of trial, appointed judge Hon. Maurice Gallipoli, adhered to the fact that the recall committee had successfully acquired more than enough signatures required to initiate a recall based on the testimony and lengthy analysis of the single witness Carlos Diego J. Perez Monasterio. Numerous challenges were raised by the defense with the inclusion of resident's signatures not matching the Statewide Voter Registration Database which prompted Judge Gallipoli to grant the Recall Committee a second day of proceedings to fix affidavit forms required to include the names of the 110 registered voters deemed invalid by Town Clerk Carmela Riccie.Arrue, Karina L. \\"Judge allows WNY recall effort time to fix forms\\", NJ.com, April 28, 2010 During the second day of trial, after the acceptance of the fixed affidavit forms, the 110 registered voter's signatures were granted to the committee only to have a number of other issues introduced by the defense with the supporting testimony of Town Clerk Carmela Riccie. These new challenges disallowed the submission of over 400 valid signatures into the total therefore reducing the number below the mark needed to initiate the recall. The lack of a timed evidence submission to the contrary by the committee's attorney, Arthur Neiss, into court prompted Gallipoli to disallow any testimony that would have reinstated the number of signatures in question back in the final total. Based on this decision to disallow any new testimony, Judge Gallipoli ruled that regardless of the amount of signatures above the number required, the committee was being penalized for the failure to comply with the case management order. 444 signatures that would otherwise had been counted, were to be deducted from the grand total. This proved to be the fatal blow in the Committee's, case which reduced all totals below the needed mark and being granted a dismissal by Judge Gallipoli.Arrue, Karina L. \\"A 'NO' VOTE: WNY recall effort is nixed in court, but Roque says he'll run\\" , NJ.com, April 30, 2010 =2011 election= On May 10, 2011, Vega and his Board of Commissioners lost the election to Roque and his commissioners, surprising many in the community. Vega's spokesman and political consultant Paul Swibinski attributed the election results to the raising of taxes in February 2009, while other sources felt that results were attributable to the fact that the Hudson County Democratic Organization did not assist Vega in fending off Roque's challenge.

It was the sixth console game in the Ridge Racer series, but unlike the previous mainline entries, which were released for PlayStation consoles, this entry was released exclusively for the Xbox 360. Gameplay Like previous Ridge Racer titles, the focus of gameplay is on placing first out of 14 in numerous 3-lap races across several tracks and numerous cars. In most races, the player can earn up to three nitrous boosts by successfully drifting around corners without crashing, which can then be used to give the player a short burst of speed. Some races are labeled as \\"no-nitrous,\\" which prevent the player from earning any nitrous during the race, though the player can optionally enable nitrous. If the player wins using this option, the race is considered complete, but noted for breaking the no-nitrous rule. Some races are also Duels between the player and a boss opponent, who is usually equipped with a much better car than the player can select from. Ridge Racer 6 introduces a career-mode \\"World Xplorer,\\" a branching-tree arrangement of races in which the player can only attempt races next to a race that has already been successfully completed. The layout of the races in the Xplorer is such that the position of a race will indicate what class of car can be used (horizontal position) and the difficulty of the course (vertical position). Rewards can be obtained by completing certain races or completing all races that enclose an area on the Xplorer, and usually offers new cars but also include additional variations of the tracks (mirroring and reverse) or new branches added to the tree. A player can also engage in quick races and time challenges for any track and car that has been unlocked. There are thirty new circuits available including \\"Surfside Resort\\" and \\"Harborline 765.\\" Also, there are around 130 cars (including 10 special). Online multiplayer is possible with up to 14 players racing against each other and downloadable content is available via Microsoft's Xbox Live service. Players can download another player's \\"ghost\\" replay from Xbox Live and attempt to beat it. Like other Ridge Racer games, this iteration goes beyond cars to feature other outlandish vehicles as well, called \\"special machines\\" in the game. These include a hovercraft (Assoluto Pronzione), a tripod supercar (Himmel 490B) and an oversized SUV that can be very loud (Danver Bass Cruiser). The game, as with all games in the Ridge Racer series, contains copious numbers of references to other Namco games, such as Pac-Man, Soulcalibur, and Ace Combat. The game also features a Full Motion Video opening, starring series mascot Reiko Nagase. In Japan, Namco announced that it expected to sell 500,000 copies of Ridge Racer 6 for the Xbox 360, although far fewer copies were actually sold. Ridge Racer 7 for the PlayStation 3 is something of a \\"director's cut\\"/\\"final version\\" of Ridge Racer 6, but with major differences such as new vehicles that were not seen in Ridge Racer 6 such as Sinseong, a Korean brand. There are 15 circuits available, each of which can also be raced in reverse, making a total of 30 circuits. The circuits are split into 5 groups of 3, where the 3 tracks in the same group will overlap. Ridge Racer 6 Direct Audio Ridge Racer 6 was the second game after Ridge Racer (PSP) that marked the rejoining of both old and new Namco sound teams ‚Äîincluding Shinji Hosoe, Ayako Saso, Nobuyoshi Sano, and Takayuki Aihara ‚Äî who worked on the first three Ridge Racer games between 1993-1995 as well as those who worked on R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 (1998) under sound director, Hiroshi Okubo. Due to high demand from fans, Ridge Racer 6 Direct Audio was released under SuperSweep Records on 14 January 2009. It contains the 16 songs listed above, as well as the ending song \\"Chasing All My Dreams\\" by Hiroshi Okubo and other tunes from the game. Other soundtracks, including those from Ridge Racer (PSP) and R: Racing Evolution, are available for download through the Xbox Live Marketplace. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, one nine, one eight, and one nine for a total of 34 out of 40. VideoGamer.com called it \\"the closest I've seen to an arcade racer on a home console, in both looks and playability.\\" GameSpy praised the game's \\"killer graphics\\" and \\"great presentation,\\" though it took issue with its \\"stuttering framerate in split-screen multiplayer.\\" GameSpot called it \\"a slick, fast-moving racing game with interesting handling characteristics.\\" However, Jolt Online Gaming said the game \\"offers neither the palm-moistening, heart-racing action of a really great arcade racer, nor the challenge and satisfying controls of a decent simulation.\\" X-Play said it was \\"the jalopy of the group.

Some transfer switches are manual, in that an operator effects the transfer by throwing a switch, while others are automatic and trigger when they sense one of the sources has lost or gained power. An Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) is often installed where a backup generator is located, so that the generator may provide temporary electrical power if the utility source fails. Operation of a transfer switch As well as transferring the load to the backup generator, an ATS may also command the backup generator to start, based on the voltage monitored on the primary supply. The transfer switch isolates the backup generator from the electric utility when the generator is on and providing temporary power. The control capability of a transfer switch may be manual only, or a combination of automatic and manual. The switch transition mode (see below) of a transfer switch may be Open Transition (OT) (the usual type), or Closed Transition (CT)). For example, in a home equipped with a backup generator and an ATS, when an electric utility outage occurs, the ATS will tell the backup generator to start. Once the ATS sees that the generator is ready to provide electric power, the ATS breaks the home's connection to the electric utility and connects the generator to the home's main electrical panel. The generator supplies power to the home's electric load, but is not connected to the electric utility lines. It is necessary to isolate the generator from the distribution system to protect the generator from overload in powering loads in the house and for safety, as utility workers expect the lines to be dead. When utility power returns for a minimum time, the transfer switch will transfer the house back to utility power and command the generator to turn off, after another specified amount of \\"cool down\\" time with no load on the generator. A transfer switch can be set up to provide power only to critical circuits or to entire electrical (sub)panels. Some transfer switches allow for load shedding or prioritization of optional circuits, such as heating and cooling equipment. More complex emergency switchgear used in large backup generator installations permits soft loading, allowing load to be smoothly transferred from the utility to the synchronized generators, and back; such installations are useful for reducing peak load demand from a utility. Types =Open transition = An open transition transfer switch is also called a break-before-make transfer switch. A break- before-make transfer switch breaks contact with one source of power before it makes contact with another. It prevents backfeeding from an emergency generator back into the utility line, for example. Safely Installing Your Standby Electric Generator, Flathead Electric Cooperative, Inc.; Jul. 2006; accessed Dec 2006 One example is an open transition automatic transfer switch (ATS). During the split second of the power transfer the flow of electricity is interrupted. Another example is a manual three position switch or circuit breaker, with utility power on one side, the generator on the other, and \\"off\\" in the middle, which requires the user to switch through the full disconnect \\"off\\" position before making the next connection. =Closed transition = A closed transition transfer switch (CTTS) is also called a make-before-break transfer switch. A typical emergency system uses open transition, so there is an inherent momentary interruption of power to the load when it is transferred from one available source to another (keeping in mind that the transfer may be occurring for reasons other than a total loss of power). In most cases this outage is inconsequential, particularly if it is less than 1/6 of a second. There are some loads, however, that are affected by even the slightest loss of power. There are also operational conditions where it may be desirable to transfer loads with zero interruption of power when conditions permit. For these applications, closed transition transfer switches can be provided. The switch will operate in a make-before-break mode provided both sources are acceptable and synchronized. Typical parameters determining synchronization are: voltage difference less than 5%, frequency difference less than 0.2 Hz, and maximum phase angle between the sources of 5 degrees. This means the engine driving the generator supplying one of the sources generally must be controlled by an isochronous governor. It is generally required that the closed transition, or overlap time, be less than 100 milliseconds. If either source is not present or not acceptable (such as when normal power fails) the switch must operate in a break-before-make mode (standard open transition operation) to ensure no backfeeding occurs. Closed transition transfer makes code-mandated monthly testing less objectionable because it eliminates the interruption to critical loads which occurs during traditional open transition transfer. With closed transition transfer, the on-site engine generator set is momentarily connected in parallel with the utility source. This requires getting approval from the local utility company. Typical load switching applications for which closed transition transfer is desirable include data processing and electronic loads, certain motor and transformer loads, load curtailment systems, or anywhere load interruptions of even the shortest duration are objectionable. A CTTS is not a substitute for a UPS (uninterruptible power supply); a UPS has a built-in stored energy that provides power for a prescribed period of time in the event of a power failure. A CTTS by itself simply assures there will be no momentary loss of power when the load is transferred from one live power source to another. Generac Power Systems Inc., accessed Dec 2006 =Soft loading = A soft- loading transfer switch (SLTS) makes use of a CTTS, and is commonly used to synchronize and operate onsite generation in parallel with utility power, and to transfer loads between the two sources while minimizing voltage or frequency transients. Pybus, Dennis; Finding Surplus Electric Power in Traditional sources; Electricity Today, Issue 5, 2001, p. 36 et seq. Accessed Apr. 2014 ASCO Series 7000 Soft Load Power Transfer Switches (product literature). Accessed May. 2017 Magnum Closed Transition Soft Load Transfer Switches (product literature). Eaton / Cuttler-Hammer. Accessed Apr. 2014 =Static transfer switch (STS)= A static transfer switch uses power semiconductors such as Silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs) to transfer a load between two sources. Because there are no mechanical moving parts, the transfer can be completed rapidly, perhaps within a quarter-cycle of the power frequency. Static transfer switches can be used where reliable and independent sources of power are available, and it is necessary to protect the load from even a few power frequency cycles interruption time, or from any surges or sags in the prime power source.Roger C. Dugan et al., Electrical Power Systems Quality Second Edition,Mc Graw Hill, 2002 , page 72  Home use  Homes with standby generators may use a transfer switch for a few circuits or the whole home. Different models are available, with both manual and automatic transfer. Often small transfer switch systems use circuit breakers with an external operating linkage as the switching mechanism. The linkage operates two circuit breakers in tandem, closing one while opening the other. Manufacturers of transfer switches can provide installation guides to select the size of switch and provide recommended installation procedures.

Individually known as Fox, Vulture, and Shark, their respective real names were originally Warren Lawford, Armand Lydecker, and Gunther Hardwick - though these have changed over the decades. Publication history The Terrible Trio first appeared in Detective Comics #253 and were created by Dave Wood and Sheldon Moldoff.Detective Comics #253 (March 1958) Fictional character history The Terrible Trio were originally three famous inventors in Gotham City, who sought new challenges by starting a criminal career. As a gimmick, they dress up in business suits while wearing cartoon masks of animals. From this, they become known as the Fox, the Shark and the Vulture. Tapping into their respective areas of expertise, they base their technology on their respective animal themes. The Trio were recurrent foes of Batman and Robin for years, but they have also battled G'nort,Green Lantern Corps Quarterly #5 (December 1992) and, more recently, the new Doctor Mid-Nite. A second group of Terrible Trio were a young group of thugs who took on the identities of Batman's old foes. Batman soon realized that one of the members was Lucius Fox's son, Timothy Fox (the Vulture). He and two other friends co- opted the identities of the original Trio and tried to rob guests of Bruce Wayne's penthouse, but they were subdued and captured by Batman.DC Retroactive: Batman - The 70s #1 (September 2011) =Doctor Mid-Nite= thumb In the Doctor Mid-Nite miniseries, the three have moved their operations to Portsmouth instead of Gotham, and have become the industrial leaders Fisk, Shackley, and Volper, heads of the investment firm Praeda Industries (Praeda meaning \\"spoils\\" or \\"booty\\", and sharing a root with the word \\"predator\\"). In this story, the Trio adopt their guises as part of rituals they perform to bring good fortune to their endeavors, calling upon the spirits of earth, air, and water. The trio attempt to cause simultaneous disasters to much of the city and its coast, leaving only the property in the worst sections of the city - which they owned and could then resell to enormous profit. As part of their plan, the Trio also operate as drug lords, selling the Venom-based steroid A39 to create an army of superstrong zombie-like soldiers. When Doctor Cross begins investigating their affairs they attempt to kill him, but succeed only in apparently blinding him (unbeknownst to them, he gains the abilities that would make him Doctor Mid-Nite). Doctor Mid-Nite foils their plans for the city, and the members of the Trio are caught and sentenced to a total of 800 years in prison. =Detective Comics= In Detective Comics #832 (April 2007), the presumed-to-be-deceased Shark is named as Sherman Shackley. In this issue, the Fox's last name is Fisk and the Vulture's last name Volper, though no first names are given for either character. Here, the Shark, in an attempt to reinvent himself after suffering a psychotic breakdown - presumed to be due to substance abuse - that caused him to 'divorce' himself from his role in the Trio, fakes his own death by pulling out his own teeth and putting them in a recently deceased corpse - putting a shark's teeth in his mouth instead - and attempts to murder his partners under the alias of the 'Fourth Man', only to be stopped by Batman who deduced the truth, as nobody else could know that much about the Trio. The Trio wind up in Arkham Asylum, where the Fox and the Vulture switch their allegiance to Warren White -- the \\"Great White Shark\\" -- who informs Shackley that he cannot be the Shark anymore and that he is taking his place. =DC Rebirth= In the DC Rebirth reboot, a new Terrible Trio is introduced in Gotham Academy: Second Semester. This Trio are three Academy students who are part of a secret society dedicated to the Academy's ghost Amity Arkham. Their leader is Amanada Lydecker (Fox), the descendant of the Dutch architect Ambroos Lydecker, who designed both the Academy and Arkham Asylum to honor Amity and who signed his work \\"Vos\\" (the Dutch word for \\"fox\\"). The other two members are Wendy Lawford (Shark) and Reiner Hardwick (Raven, rather than Vulture), who both immediately surrender when challenged by the Detective Club.Gotham Academy: Second Semester #10 (August 2017) Other versions =Marvel Family= A different version of the Terrible Trio appeared in Marvel Family #21. They are three monsters summoned from the Netherworld by three carnival brothers, after they can not hire the Marvel Family, but steal a book of magic instead. They draw a circle and summon a Satyr, a Hydra, and Argus, planning to exhibit them and placing them in a cage. What they do not realize is that the monsters have to return in 24 hours unless three replacements are sent. The monsters use their strength to break out of the cage and are able to fight their way past the Marvels who have come to investigate the spellbook's robbery, planning to send the brothers instead of themselves. However, the Marvels are able to defeat them in the second battle, then take them back to the circle. They transform into their civilian forms to meet the brothers, but when returning to the circle, they are bound and gagged by the monsters who plan to send them back to the Netherworld. However, when lightning comes down to transport them, it instead transforms them into the Marvel Family who send the monsters back. The brothers then reveal they took footage of the fight and can use it to make money.Marvel Family #21 In other media =Television= * In Batman: The Animated Series, the Terrible Trio are bored, spoiled rich men versions of Warren Lawford (voiced by Bill Mumy), Armand Lydecker (voiced by David Jolliffe), and Gunther Hardwick (voiced by Peter Scolari). Each of them inherited family fortunes: Lawford gets his from oil, Lydecker's father owned an aerodynamics firm, and Hardwick's father was a shipping magnate. The three turn to crime out of boredom, assuming the identities of Fox, Vulture, and Shark, reflecting the elements that gave them their fortunes. Managing to outwit the Batman and Robin in their first two encounters, they are ultimately defeated and jailed after the trio tries to kill Warren's girlfriend Rebecca Fallbrook who has discovered their identities after they injure her father Sheldon during a robbery of his house. Warren believes he will only get off with a light sentence, but is sentenced to serve his long sentence at Stonegate Penitentiary, most likely for the attempted murders towards the Fallbrooks. In the last scene, Warren is ushered into his cell at Stonegate. He takes in the cockroach-infested sink and his leering, hulking cellmate. Warren backs away in terror only to bump into the bars, which have slammed shut behind him. The Batman. * The Terrible Trio appear in The Batman episode \\"Attack of the Terrible Trio.\\" This version of the Terrible Trio are university students and social outcasts named David (voiced by David Faustino), Justin (voiced by Googy Gress), and Amber (voiced by Grey DeLisle). Instead of costumes, they mutated by using formulas stolen from Dr. Kirk Langstrom's computer. David remade the formula and put it into dissolving patches. After applying one each, David became a therianthropic Fox, Justin became a therianthropic Shark (resembling a hammerhead shark), and Amber became a therianthropic Vulture. Throughout the episode, their schemes were mostly for amusement and vindication, rather than financial gain. One recurring theme was turning other college students (including the ones that have bullied them) into therianthropes against their will. Since Barbara Gordon went to the same college, she, as Batgirl, assisted Batman in combating them. After receiving a blood sample from one of their victims, Langstrom is able to provide an antidote for the mutagen. After some difficulty, Batman and Batgirl administer the antidote to Justin and Amber respectively as Justin is arrested by the security guards while Amber is taken down by Batgirl. David was accidentally covered in a mutagenic fluid meant for several other students when Batman destroyed the mutagen detonator. This turned him into a horned griffin-like creature. After being electrocuted by the stadium sign and presumably cured, David was sent to prison with Justin while Amber was presumably sent to a women's prison. Batman commented to Batgirl that they would have a hard time fitting in there, just like in college, as David and Justin are later seen in the prison cafeteria cowering between two tough inmates at their cafeteria table. * The Terrible Trio appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Return of the Fearsome Fangs\\" with Fox voiced by Phil Morris, Vulture voiced by Edoardo Ballerini, and Shark having no dialogue. This version of the Terrible Trio are bored millionaires who become martial artists wearing masks of their totem animals. They studied at the Wudang Temple alongside Batman and Bronze Tiger. As members of the Shadow Clan, they plan to steal the Wudang Totem from the temple, first killing off the last line of defense: Master Wong Fei. Batman and Bronze Tiger end up battling them to protect the Wudang Temple. When the Terrible Trio obtains the Wudang Totem, they turn into monstrous versions of the animals they represent. Attempting to take over Hong Kong, they are stopped by Batman and Bronze Tiger who use the Wudang Totem's powers to likewise become monstrous versions of their own totem animals. * The Terrible Trio appeared on promotional artwork released for Harley Quinn, set to air on DC Universe. =Video games= * In Batman: Arkham City, one of the Riddler's riddles references the Terrible Trio: \\"Air, sea or land. It would be criminal to not hire these guys, wouldn't it?\\" However, the Riddle is answered by scanning the Falcone Warehousing & Storage sign. * In Batman: Arkham Knight, throughout the city are signs for \\"Hardwick Tours\\", which is a reference to Shark (Gunther Hardwick). =Miscellaneous= * The Terrible Trio appear in issue #11 of the Batman: The Brave and the Bold comic series.

Brown. It premiered on September 14, 1998 and ran through the 2012‚Äì13 television season for a total of fifteen seasons. Joe Brown was the second highest paid daytime television personality behind Judge Judy during the time the show was running. During the entirety of his series run, he was the longest serving African American television arbitrator; this record is now held by Greg Mathis of Judge Mathis, which premiered the year after Brown's program and is still on the air into its 22nd season as of 2020. The first-run syndication series entered its fifteenth and final season on September 10, 2012, also regularly airing in high-definition for the first time beginning in that same season as well. Production history Judge Joe Brown is the first African-American man to preside over a courtroom television show and the first African-American person to preside over a long-running courtroom series. However, former New York prosecutor Star Jones is the first African-American person to preside over a court show (Jones & Jury 1994‚Äì1995). With all of its seasons having aired consecutively, solely under Judge Joe, Judge Joe Brown was the second longest running television jurist for many years prior to his cancellation, just behind Judge Judy Sheindlin. While there are court shows that outnumber both Judge Joe Brown and Judge Judy in seasons within the judicial arena, namely Divorce Court and The People's Court, they are also programs with multiple lives and multiple \\"judges\\" in their histories. The set of Judge Joe Brown was directly beside the set of Judge Judy within the same facility, Sunset Bronson Studios. After Judge Joe Browns 2013 cancellation, however, the space was used for the courtroom series Paternity Court for a season (2013‚Äì14), followed by the court show created by Judge Judy Sheindlin Hot Bench (2014‚Äìpresent). As Judge Judy was and still is, Judge Joe Brown was both produced by Big Ticket Television and syndicated by CBS Television Distribution (CTD), the successor company to their previous distributors: Worldvision Enterprises, Paramount Domestic Television, and CBS Paramount Domestic Television. The show was syndicated in the US, and aired during daytime hours. Reruns currently air weekday mornings on Bounce TV. It aired on CTV in Canada and Fox8 in Australia. Like the majority of television court shows, Judge Joe Brown is a form of binding arbitration. The show's producers maintain the appearance of a civil courtroom. =Ratings= As far as ratings in the legal/courtroom genre go, Brown's program ranked in second place during its entire run, typically just above The People's Court and significantly below Judge Judy. Consequently, Judge Joe Brown was the highest rated male- arbitrated television series during its run. Adjudicating approach According to Roger M. Grace, editor of the Metropolitan News-Enterprise, for the most part, Brown had a languid and perfunctory nature about him, particularly while gathering all the facts and trying to figure out the case. Occasionally, however, once he suspected a party of being guilty, Brown had become particularly cantankerous as shown in his irritated, quarrelsome communication. Brown had also subjected these litigants to harsh tirades and judgmental commentary. At several intervals throughout many of the cases, Brown had been seen up on his feet in the midst of a tirade, pacing and raging around the bench area. In these moments, he'd also been known to sit atop the desktop of his bench to add emphasis to his long, angry tirades. The harshest of Brown's tirades had generally been delivered to men whose behavior he regarded as particularly irresponsible or egregious. In these moments, Brown flinged out his personal values and guidance at men, such as: \\"Grow up and be a man\\", \\"You don't know nothing about manhood\\", \\"Quit acting like you haven't got any home training\\", \\"Be a civilized human being and stop trying to be cool\\", \\"Quit acting like a thug\\", \\"Take responsibility\\", and \\"Have a sense of class and decency.\\" Brown had been criticized for these behaviors for \\"lacking self-control.\\" Brown tended to allow \\"victimized\\" or \\"wronged\\" litigants ample opportunity to also berate \\"guilty\\" litigants, often delighting in this and listening in amusement; moreover, he allowed audience applause and laughter at the guilty litigant's expense so that the whole courtroom was against the guilty party. With brasher litigants than other courtroom programs, however, perhaps due to the nature of the cases or at least Brown's approach, guilty litigants on Judge Joe Brown had been known to act out. On past episodes, many litigants who were perceived as guilty by Brown and treated accordingly had not hesitated to chuck items around the courtroom (such as water), disrespect the judge, or threaten the other party or spectators. In fact, in February 2010, Brown himself was sued by one of his former television show litigants for alleged slander and fraud, but won the case because of the waivers the court show had its litigants sign prior to the televised proceedings. On the series, Brown had typically responded to most of the aforementioned behaviors by telling the litigants they'd be receiving a ticket or demanding that the litigant be arrested and thrown in jail for violating a statute that requires proper behavior and decorum in arbitration. Recurring roles The program also featured a news reporter and bailiff. Holly Evans was the bailiff from 1998 to 2006. Sonia Montejano replaced her for the rest of the run in 2006. Jacque Kessler was the show's news reporter from 1998 to 2010. Former Fox Sports and current MLB Network freelance reporter Jeanne Zelasko succeeded Kessler as the reporter in 2010. Ben Patrick Johnson was the show's announcer from 1998 to 2005. Rolonda Watts succeeded him as announcer in 2005. Popular musicians Coolio, Ike Turner, and Rick James have all been litigants on the show. As of 2014, Sonia Montejano now serves as the bailiff on the new panel court series Hot Bench, while Rolonda Watts now announces the long running series, Divorce Court. Salary It was reported in mid-2012 that Brown was the second highest paid daytime television personality, earning $20 million a year, only second to Judge Judy, who earns $45 million a year. In April 2013, however, following the show's cancellation, Brown disputed these reports claiming that CTD was only paying him $5 million a year. Cancellation As reported on February 27, 2013, by Broadcasting & Cable, CTD had told Brown that the salary amount they were paying him‚Äìof $20 million (though Brown disputed this, claiming that CTD had never given him a salary of any more than $5 million)‚Äîwould be cut in the wake of his declining ratings, license fees, and advertising revenues. Ratings for Judge Joe Brown were declining during its last several seasons on the air. In the 2013 February sweeps, the show was down 20% to a 2.4 live plus same day rating from a 3.0 last year according to Nielsen Media Research. Brown refused to do the show under the new terms. Rather, he shopped his program to other distributors. Station executives told Broadcasting & Cable they were less than happy to be learning about the dissension at the end of February 2013 when their options for replacing the show were limited. CTD announced on March 26, 2013 that they would be cancelling the court show and cease distributing the series after its summer 2013 reruns. The final CTD-produced episodes were taped on March 14, 2013. Fox station owners (that had contracted to air the program) were reportedly not interested in a CTD-chosen replacement judge. Brown later called out CTD for their treatment of him, claiming they had reneged on contract agreements, cheated him out of money, failed to give him sufficient advertising in favor of concentrating their advertisements in Judge Judy, and engaged in several other unjust, underhanded and unethical business practices.

The park is home to the country's largest collection of outdoor murals, as well as various sculptures, earthworks, and an architectural piece dedicated to the cultural heritage of the community. Because of the magnitude and historical significance of the murals, the park was designated an official historic site by the San Diego Historical Site Board in 1980, and its murals were officially recognized as public art by the San Diego Public Advisory Board in 1987. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013 owing to its association with the Chicano Movement, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016.. Chicano Park, like Berkeley's People's Park, was the result of a militant (but nonviolent) people's land takeover. Every year on April 22 (or the nearest Saturday), the community celebrates the anniversary of the park's takeover with a celebration called Chicano Park Day.  Background  The area was originally known as the East End, but was renamed Logan Heights in 1905. The first Mexican settlers there arrived in the 1890s, followed soon after by refugees fleeing the violence of the Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910. So many Mexican immigrants and Mexican- Americans settled there that the southern portion of Logan Heights eventually became known as Barrio Logan. The original neighborhood reached all the way to San Diego Bay, with waterfront access for the residents. This access was denied beginning with World War II, when Naval installations blocked local access to the beach. The denial of beachfront access was the initial source of the community's resentment of the government and its agencies. This resentment grew in the 1950s, when the area was rezoned as mixed residential and industrial. Junk dealers and repair shops moved into the barrio, creating air pollution, loud noise, and aesthetic conditions unsuitable for a residential area. Resentment continued to grow as the barrio was cleaved in two by Interstate 5 in 1963 and was further divided in 1969 by the elevated onramps of the San Diego-Coronado Bridge. At this time, Mexicans were accustomed to not being included in discussions concerning their communities and to not being represented by their officials, so no formal complaint was lodged. This attitude began to change as the Civil Rights Movement unfolded in parallel with park development efforts. As various community campaigns coalesced under the banner of the Chicano Movement (for the right to organize and collectively bargain, led by C√©sar Ch√°vez and Dolores Huerta of the United Farm Workers, the rights to the full benefits guaranteed to veterans, led by Dr. Hector P. Garcia of the American G.I. Forum, the right to equal and pertinent education, led by the student group MEChA which issued the Plan de Santa Barbara, for the rights of Mexicans guaranteed under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, (especially land grants and bilingual education) under Reies Tijerina, and for recognition of the historic contributions of Mexican-Americans and the validity of Mexican culture) so too did the political awareness and sense of empowerment grow in Barrio Logan. Community residents had long been demanding a park. The City Council had promised to build a park to compensate for the loss of over 5,000 homes and businesses removed for the construction of the freeway and bridge, as well as for the aesthetic degradation created by the overhead freeways supported by a forest of gray concrete piers. In June 1969, the park was officially approved and a site was designated, but no action was taken to implement the decision.  The takeover  The final straw came on April 22, 1970. On his way to school, a community member, San Diego City College student, and Brown Beret member named Mario Solis noticed bulldozers next to the area designated for the park. When he inquired about the nature of the work being undertaken, he was shocked to discover that, rather than a park, the crew was preparing to build a parking lot next to a building that would be converted into a California Highway Patrol station. Solis went door- to-door to spread the news of the construction. At school, he alerted the students of Professor Gil Robledo's Chicano studies class, who printed fliers to bring more attention to the affair. At noon that day, Mexican-American high school students walked out of their classes to join other neighbors who had already congregated at the site. Some protesters formed human chains around the bulldozers, while others planted trees, flowers, and cactus. Solis is reported to have commandeered a bulldozer to flatten the land for planting. Also, notably, the flag of Aztl√°n was raised on an old telephone pole, marking a symbolic \\"reclamation\\" of land that was once Mexico by people of Mexican descent. There were many young people and families at the protest. When the crowd grew to 250, construction was called off. The occupation of Chicano Park lasted for twelve days while community members and city officials held meetings to negotiate the creation of a park. During that time, groups of people came from Los Angeles and Santa Barbara to join the occupation and express solidarity. The Chicano Park Steering Committee was founded by Josephine Talamantez, Victor Ochoa, Jose Gomez, and others. Not trusting the city and fearing that abandoning the land would be tantamount to conceding defeat, an agreement was finally reached and the Steering Committee called for an end to the occupation of the land while stationing informal picketers on the public sidewalks around the disputed terrain to provide residents with information regarding the project. They maintained that the park would be re- occupied if negotiations failed. At a meeting on April 23, a young artist named Salvador Torres, recently returned to the barrio from the College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, shared his vision of adorning the freeway support pillars with beautiful artworks and a green belt with trees and other vegetation that would stretch all the way to the waterfront. For this reason, he is sometimes referred to as \\"the architect of the dream.\\" Finally, on July 1, 1970, $21,814.96 was allocated for the development of a 1.8 acre (7,300 m¬≤) parcel of land.  Park establishment  While the creation of the park was actually begun on the day of the takeover, with minor landscaping improvements being undertaken by the occupiers, the murals that brought the park to prominence were not begun until 1973. Adding unplanned murals and splashes of color did start in 1970, however, with Guillermo Aranda, Mario Acevedo, Victor Ochoa, Tomas Castaneda and others working on the freeway retaining walls and pylons. With few exceptions, the artists and their organizations raised the money necessary to purchase muriatic acid to wash the columns, rubber surface conditioner to prepare them, and paints. Victor Ochoa, a founding member of the Chicano Park Steering Committee, recalls that on March 23, 1973 he brought 300 brushes and there were nearly 300 people helping to paint all weekend. The Centro Cultural de la Raza in San Diego's Balboa Park served as a training area for many of the muralists. Many non-Chicanos also participated including Anglo artist, Michael Schnorr. Eventually a core of about 16 artists were dedicated to finishing the murals with many well-known Chicano artists and groups participating, such as members of the Royal Chicano Air Force. Over time, more vegetation was planted to create a cactus garden. The first group of graffiti took nearly two years to complete. The murals at Chicano Park act as a way to transmit the history and culture of Mexican-Americans and Chicanos. Murals have many themes including addressing immigration, feminist concerns and featuring historical and civil rights leaders. In 1978, there was a \\"Mural Marathon\\" which took place from April 1 through April 22. During those twenty-one days, approximately 10,000 square feet of murals were painted. Other additions to the park have been piecemeal, as the comprehensive \\"Master Plan\\" put forth by the artists was never adopted by the city. The park has expanded, and currently reaches almost \\"all the way to the bay\\", a phrase used as the rally cry to extend the park in a 1980 campaign. The Cesar E. Ch√°vez Waterfront Park was begun in 1987 and completed in 1990, finally restoring beach access to the community. With the exception of three city blocks that are not part of the park, the original goal of creating a community park with waterfront access has been achieved. On Saturday, April 24, 2010, there was a 40th Anniversary Celebration held at Chicano Park with the theme being: \\"40 A√±os de la Tierra Mia: Aqu√≠ Estamos y No Nos Vamos.\\" An 80-foot-wide community sign for the park was planned to go up by 2014. In 2014, the park had lights installed so that it would be well-lit at night- time, to create a more family-friendly atmosphere.  Landmark and historical status  Because of the magnitude and historical significance of the murals, the park was designated an official historic site by the San Diego Historical Site Board in 1980, and its murals were officially recognized as public art by the San Diego Public Advisory Board in 1987. Josephine Talamantez and Manny Galaviz submitted the proposal that successfully added Chicano Park to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013 due to its association with the Chicano Movement. In 1997, Josephine Talamantez began the process of placing Chicano Park with its artwork and murals on the National Register in order to prevent the city of San Diego from damaging the murals while retrofitting Coronado Bridge. After years of work, Chicano Park was officially designated as a National Historic Landmark in December 2016. Talamantez is currently working towards opening a Chicano Park Museum and Cultural Center inside a nearby city-owned building that used to house the Cesar Chavez Continuing Education Center.  Mural restoration  Mural restoration projects began in 1984, and the murals have been restored almost continuously ever since. A large-scale restoration project took place in 2012 with many of the original artists returning to work on the art. The murals were fully restored by 2013 in time for the 43rd Anniversary Celebration.  Controversy  Since its inception, there have been disputes within the community about who decides who gets to paint the murals, what imagery should be represented, who is responsible for the restoration of the murals, etc. But conflicts between the community artists and city and state officials have been much greater. Conflicts have also arisen between supporters and opponents of the park on political grounds. *A few months after the park takeover in 1970, three Brown Berets, who helped lead it, were indicted and ultimately convicted of plotting to bomb the education building at City College. The charges were criminal syndicalism, distributing bombs and one was charged with soliciting murder. One of them, David Rico, is today still a member of the Chicano Park Steering Committee and president of the Brown Berets de Aztlan. *In 1979, a San Diego grand jury investigation forced the Chicano Federation and the Chicano Park Steering Committee to vacate the building next to the park due to financial and other abuses uncovered during the investigation. The grand jury also recommended that the Chicano Federation be separated from the Chicano Park Steering Committee due to undue influence being exercised by the Steering Committee members on the Federation. *A demand for a kiosk, called the Chicano Park kiosko and based on traditional community centers in Mexican villages, was fulfilled in 1977, but only after a great deal of bureaucratic wrangling and disputes over the style of architecture to be used. Councilman Jess Haro wanted the architecture to be in the Spanish style, while the barrio residents wanted an indigenous style of architecture. The community won out, and today the kiosko resembles a Mayan temple. *An effort to have the barrio re-zoned as solely residential provoked the ire of the neighborhood junk dealers, who vandalized the murals, especially the \\"Barrio S√≠, Yonkes No\\" mural created to commemorate the effort. *In the mid-1990s, Caltrans decided to retrofit the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge to make it earthquake safe. Fearing that the murals would be damaged or destroyed, the community mobilized to stop the project to protect the murals from what they viewed as official insensitivity to the history and culture the murals represented. Eventually, a compromise was reached whereby the murals would be boarded over with plywood to protect their surfaces from damage during the retrofitting process, and would be restored to their previous condition afterward. * A 2003 plan to renovate the park was stalled when Caltrans objected to the word \\"Aztl√°n\\", which for years had been spelled out in rocks on the park's grounds. Calling the term \\"militant\\", they claimed that using federal funding for the project would violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by showing preference to Mexicans and Mexican Americans. However, Caltrans district director Pedro Orso, after consultations with civil rights experts from within the agency and from the Federal Highway Administration, decided that the word did not violate the law, and the $600,000 grant was allowed to go through. * Chicano Park was added to the list of National Historic Landmarks by Obama's Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell on December 23, 2016. * Conservatives have objected to murals depicting or referring to communist and socialist leaders such as Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and Salvador Allende. * On September 3, 2017 Blogger, Roger Ogden, a critic of the park organized a \\"Patriot Picnic\\" at the park for a group of five persons to discuss among themselves the \\"anti-American\\" features of some murals. Over 500 attended the counter-demonstration to prevent the private group from accessing the park. Ogden and his small group were eventually escorted out by dozens of police for their own safety, due to the threat from the angry crowd of park supporters. * On the morning of February 3, 2018 a second \\"Patriot Picnic\\" was organized by an anonymous group, calling itself \\"Bordertown Patriots\\", with the intention of flying the U.S. flag in the center of the park. Ogden was again involved, as were a number of \\"patriot\\" figures such as Joey Gibson. Hundreds of people came to again prevent the group from entering the park. Two of the \\"patriots\\" were arrested, one for possession of an alleged \\"billy club\\" and another was cited for public urination in the free speech zone, where the group was confined with no facilities for hours. Police also arrested Frederick Burnett Jefferson, who was subsequently convicted of felony assault on a badly-injured police officer, as well as two felony counts and one misdemeanor count of resisting arrest Jefferson was sentenced to seven years in prison on August 31, 2018. That same night he was found dead in his jail cell. An investigation is underway. While in jail he had also been implicated via DNA in a rape in Maryland and faced another trial.  Anniversary days  Every year around April 22, Chicano Park marks an anniversary celebration to \\"celebrate the takeover of the area.\\" The Park hosts traditional music as well as modern bands. Ballet folklorico, lowrider car exhibits and art workshops have also been a part of these celebrations. * 40th Anniversary Theme: 40 A≈àos de the Tierra Mia: Aqu√≠ Estamos y No Nos Vamos * 43rd Anniversary Theme: Chicano Park: Aztlan's Jewel & National Chicano Treasure * 44th Anniversary Theme: La Tierra Es De Quien La Trabaja: The Land Belongs To Those Who Work It...  Park use  The park hosts many different events and groups throughout the year. Different groups who practice and perform Aztec dance use Chicano Park to prepare for ceremonies and other events.

A Lancastrian, Hitch was bowling for a club in Cambridgeshire when he was spotted by Surrey's batsman Tom Hayward and recommended to The Oval. From his debut in 1907, he quickly established himself as one of the fastest bowlers in first-class cricket, and his rumbustious lower-order batting and general enthusiasm made him a favourite with the crowds. In 1908 he took 58 wickets including 13 in a remarkably heavy win against Kent at the Oval, but it was not until the latter part of 1910 that Hitch entered the public eye. His aggressive hitting brought him such innings as 74 against Middlesex on a difficult wicket, whilst at Northampton he made 54 and took 9 for 101 - bowling unchanged with Razor Smith throughout both innings apart from one over. However, it was Hitch's brilliant close catching that garnered the critics' attention and helped Smith to a bag of wickets unrivalled for Surrey except by Tom Richardson in his great days between 1893 and 1897. Hitch photo portrait In the abnormally dry summer of 1911, Hitch was the third-highest wicket-taker in England (with 151) but it was generally felt he should have done better and was not as accurate as a top-class bowler should be. Nonetheless, Hitch toured Australia in 1911-12 and played for England both then and during the 1912 Triangular Tournament. He also played Tests against Warwick Armstrong's all-conquering Australian cricket team both home and away in 1920-21 and 1921. But in seven matches Hitch took only 11 wickets, and his most notable achievement was an innings of 51 in just 40 minutes at The Oval in 1921. 1912 - a summer in which fast bowlers generally had an impossible task just to get a foothold - saw Hitch against Essex at Leyton produce some of the fastest and most difficult bowling in the history of the game - probably at a speed of around . In 1913, Hitch improved his accuracy enough to take 174 wickets, including seven hauls of ten in a match, and be a Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1914. He maintain this form in 1914 and 1919 but fell off as a bowler afterwards as he lost some of his terrific speed, but compensated in 1921 by scoring over a thousand runs at an average over thirty. His batting feats included 74 in 35 minutes against Nottinghamshire and his highest score of 107 against Somerset at Bath in 1922 was made in just 70 minutes. As well as being a superb bowler and dangerous batsman, he was a brilliant fielder, especially at short leg. After retiring in 1925, Hitch played Lancashire League cricket for four years before becoming coach at Glamorgan. He also served as a first-class umpire during this period.

The battle ended in a victory for the armies of Spain and France over the Kingdom of Sardinia but it did not advance the victors' campaign. Prelude The battle of Cuneo was brought about by a difference in Franco-Spanish policy during the middle part of 1744. Spain wished for an advance along the coast of Italy through Genoa to occupy the lands around Parma, which it already had been decided were going to be the future realm of Infante Philip, the third son of King Philip V of Spain and his wife, Elisabeth Farnese. The chief aim of France was to humble Piedmont-Sardinia and to force her to detach herself from Austria, or better yet, force her to drop out of the war entirely. The French commander, the Prince of Conti, would not accept the Spanish plan of attack because he thought it was unsound, while the Spanish queen would brook no opposition to what she believed should be the key thrust of the joint Bourbon armies. In the end, a compromise was negotiated. Spain's plan was not to be followed until after the humbling of Piedmont-Sardinia, after which the joint armies would march into Lombardy to secure the Infante Philip his new realm. Franco-Spanish advance to Cuneo The principal plan for invading Piedmont was devised by Lt-Gen Pierre Joseph de Bourcet, who was France's leading expert in alpine warfare. The main problem for any army invading Piedmont was the problem of surmounting the alpine passes that guarded its approaches. Even a small number of defenders could effectively block an advance. De Bourcet's reasoning was that with a numerical superiority of 33,000 to 25,000 the best result would be obtained by separating the attacking force into several columns, which would then attack outlying outposts in a multi-pronged advance. Using infiltration tactics, it would be easy to envelop the Piedmontese positions, allowing attacks to be launched where most unexpected. Finally, by putting pressure along the whole front it was reasoned that the Piedmontese defence perimeter would crack at some point, and then the columns could re-unite and push through the gap. With this in mind, the Franco-Spanish army began to regroup in the Dauphin√© region in June. Once concentrated, the attacking columns lay on a front between Brian√ßon and St. Etienne. On 5 July the Franco-Spanish army broke camp and headed in nine separate columns towards the heart of Piedmont. Despite bickering between Conti and La Mina, the Franco-Spanish army experienced several early triumphs. Entering the Stura valley, the route passed through a 6 m defile known as the Barricades. Following De Bourcet's advice, troops to the north and south of the position emerged throughout the mountains onto the rear of the Piedmont position, and rather than being caught in a trap the Piedmontese evacuated the valley without a fight. In accordance with instructions, the Franco-Spanish army now converged on the Stura Valley in order to take advantage of the gap in Charles Emmanuel's defences. The Franco-Spanish army triumphed again on 19 July when it won the Battle of Casteldelfino; to cap it all, the town of Demonte, the last outpost before Cuneo, surrendered to Conti on 17 August 1744.

With King Frederick of Prussia advancing into Bohemia, Charles Emmanuel knew that the bulk of the troops needed for the defence of Cuneo would have to come from his own domains. With that in mind he held back his army of 25,000 near Saluzzo to await developments. To safeguard Cuneo he appointed Major-General Leutrum ‚Äì who had performed well at Campo Santo ‚Äì to command the garrison, and called out the kingdom's militia, which could act as a superb guerrilla force. The siege of Cuneo began on the night of 12/13 September. Conti's plan involved three armies - one to besiege, one to oppose Charles Emmanuel's Army and another to patrol the surrounding lands. Although Leutrum showed great ingenuity ‚Äì lighting the sky to illuminate the trenches for his cannon and continuously mounting sorties ‚Äì by 28 September Conti's army was closing in on the fortress. It was at this point that the King of Sardinia decided to act. Charles Emmanuel's plan Charles Emmanuel had already decided that with his opponents' numerical superiority, a more ambitious plan was needed to relieve Cuneo. With this in mind the King proposed five separate aims for his army: *1. A pitched battle with the Franco-Spanish army. *2. To send in supplies to Cuneo and evacuate the wounded. *3. To attack Bourbon outposts around Cuneo. *4. For Leutrum to lead a sortie to destroy the siege works east of the Gesso river. *5. For his militia to attack the Franco-Spanish lines of communication in the Stura Valley. The brilliance of this plan was that as long as the first aim kept Conti and La Mina preoccupied with the main Sardinian army and completely unaware of the other four aims, then the King would not need to win the coming battle. With the other aims fulfilled and winter and the snow closing in, the French and Spanish would be forced to disengage from the siege and retreat into France. The King of Sardinia was playing for time. The battle Late in September, Charles Emmanuel advanced his army from Saluzzo towards Cuneo while at the same time Conti moved his army towards the Piedmontese. By the close of day on September 29, Conti occupied a position between Caraglio and Madonna dell'Olmo, whilst on the morning of 30 September Charles Emmanuel moved his army into position opposite Conti's. The engagement began around noon when the Croats (on loan from Austria) in the Sardinian army charged towards Madonna dell'Olmo. The Croat attack, however, was repulsed by the Spanish and even Charles Emmanuel's grenadiers could make no headway. On the opposite flank the French could not get to grips with the Piedmontese because of a ditch and some barricades barring the way. In the centre, however, Conti made excellent use of his artillery, which provided cover for a French infantry attack. The battle for the centre lay in the balance until Charles Emmanuel, realising that he would not be able to capture Madonna dell'Olmo, ordered an orderly retreat. By nightfall the two armies had disengaged. Out of a total number of 25,000, the King of Sardinia had lost 4,400 men, whilst the Bourbon losses were a little over half their enemies at 2,700 men killed or wounded. Furthermore, Conti still had his army intact. Aftermath Although victory had gone to the Franco-Spanish army, it became apparent that evening that Charles Emmanuel's brilliantly conceived plan had fulfilled most of its objectives. Although the Bourbon outposts around Cuneo were intact, the siege works had been destroyed, the garrison re-supplied and reinforced, and Conti's communications had been cut. Further problems followed when it began to rain on the first of October, the trenches flooded and roads were wiped out. At a council of war on 11 October it was decided that with winter approaching and the Franco-Spanish Army even further from their goal, the army should retreat before the winter snows closed the passes behind them. By 19 November the Franco-Spanish army had recrossed the Alps. On 20 November it began to snow.

OISC immigration advisers Although guidance notes and numerous online resources are available to help people applying to immigrate to the United Kingdom, some may also seek professional legal advice. In contrast to most areas of legal advice in the United Kingdom, immigration advice services are regulated. Unless an immigration adviser is regulated by another approved regulator (for example a solicitor, a barrister or a legal executive) they must be regulated by the OISC, if they are providing advice from the United Kingdom. All those in the UK providing Immigration Advice and Services must comply with the OISC's Code of Standards. \\"Immigration advice\\" is advice given relating to a specific application to enter or remain in the UK. \\"Immigration services\\" are those given when representing someone in relation to an immigration matter, for example, to the United Kingdom Visas & Immigration (UKVI) or a court or tribunal. Responsibilities The OISC is responsible for: *Admitting immigration advisers into its Regulatory Scheme, *Maintaining and publishing the register of advisers, *Prosecuting those that operate illegally outside of the Scheme, *Regulating immigration advisers in accordance with the Commissioner‚Äôs Code of Standards, *Receiving complaints about immigration advisers irrespective of whether or not they are regulated by the OISC, and *Promoting good practice in the immigration advice sector. The OISC maintains and publishes a register of those advisers that it has found fit and competent to provide immigration advice and services. Legal advisers regulated by the OISC must complete a detailed regulation process. They can be regulated at 3 levels of competence: *Level 1 ‚Äì Initial advice *Level 2 ‚Äì Casework *Level 3 ‚Äì Advocacy and representation The Commissioner may refuse or withdraw permission to practice if they believe that an adviser is not fit and competent to provide immigration advice and services. The Commissioner may also take other disciplinary action against advisers found in breach of the OISC Code of Standards.

The document outlines several demands made of Israel, including the need for reparations to be made to Palestinians. It further states that \\"No solution is acceptable if it does not guarantee the Palestinians‚Äô and Israelis‚Äô right to self-determination, independence, and sovereignty\\" and calls for \\"a peace treaty‚Ä¶ between the two states of Palestine and Israel guaranteeing the full sovereignty and territorial integrity of each including recognized borders, water rights, and other resources.\\" > The Genuine Hope: Two sovereign and fully democratic states This scenario > envisages the total withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied territories > including East Jerusalem according to United Nations resolutions 242 and > 338.

Based on the 1985 South African Kairos Document, Palestinian clergy called to the churches of the world for \\"a moment of truth: a word of faith, hope and love from the heart of the Palestinian suffering.\\" Program ;Community Building Program Sabeel's Community Building Program seeks to educate the public about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to foster \\"a sense of solidarity\\", and to contribute to the community's spiritual growth. ;Youth Program Sabeel's Youth Program \\"provides opportunities for young people from different churches to meet and get to know each other\\" and \\"educates and empowers youth to be future Church and Civic leaders\\". ;Women's Program Sabeel's Women's Program \\"encourages networks of women, fosters inclusivity, broadens knowledge of existing support resources, and educates women on their spiritual history and their responsibility as Christian women\\". ;Witness Visits Sabeel offers regular \\"witness visits\\" to the Holy Land for Christian clergy. The trips provide them with an opportunity to meet, talk, and worship with Palestinian Christians and others who oppose the Israeli occupation. The clergy members are able to experience \\"the Separation Wall, illegal settlements, checkpoints, confiscated and demolished homes, refugee camps, and environmental degradation\\". ;Wave of Prayer Each Thursday at noon in Jerusalem, Sabeel holds an ecumenical Communion service that is open to the community. ;Cornerstone Sabeel also publishes a quarterly English-language newspaper Cornerstone, which \\"highlights Sabeel's ministry activities both locally and internationally as well as theological reflections on contemporary social and political events\\". Friends of Sabeel Sabeel describes Friends of Sabeel ‚Äì North America (FOSNA) as \\"a nonprofit, tax-exempt Christian ecumenical organization seeking justice and peace in the Holy Land through non-violence and education\\". It works in the U.S. and Canada to support the vision of Sabeel. It cultivates the support of American churches through co- sponsored regional educational conferences, alternative pilgrimage, witness trips, and international gatherings in the Holy Land. Friends of Sabeel chapters also exist in Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Ireland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Australia. In 2010, Friends of Sabeel-North America circulated a list of ten companies to boycott titled ‚ÄúAll I want for Christmas is an End to Apartheid,‚Äù stating that ‚ÄúWhile there are many Israeli and multinational companies that benefit from apartheid, we put together this list to highlight ten specific companies to target.‚Äù #Ahava #Delta Galil Industries #Motorola #L'Oreal / The Body Shop #Dorot Garlic and Herbs #Estee Lauder #Intel #Sabra #Sara Lee #Victoria's Secret  Mixed Support from different Christian denominations  Sabeel has sent representatives to several denominational gatherings in the United States and has advocated for divestment resolutions, which it sees as a non-violent approach to resisting the occupation. It has met with some success. The Presbyterian Church (USA) has passed divestment resolutions based on information provided by Sabeel. All of the major mainline denominations, including the United Church of Christ, the United Methodist Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Episcopal Church, have discussed divestment and the possibility of using the money in their pension funds and endowments to exert pressure for peace in the Middle East. In February 2006, the World Council of Churches (WCC) commended the actions of the Presbyterian Church (USA) and urged other member churches worldwide to consider economic measures to end Israel‚Äôs occupation. Salpy Eskidjian Weiderud, former special consultant to the Geneva-based WCC General Secretary on Palestine and Israel, has noted that support for divestment by the WCC governing body came in the backdrop of a history of \\"bold statements since 1948 on its Israel/Palestine policy\\", and was a way of ensuring \\"that it is not in any way contributing financially to what it says is illegal or immoral.\\" The Episcopal Church, The United Church of Christ and others have passed Sabeel-influenced resolutions urging Israel to dismantle the separation barrier and end its occupation of the Palestinian territories. Other groups within these denominations have rejected and opposed these resolutions. Rev. David Runnion-Bareford of the Biblical Witness Fellowship issued an apology to Jews after the United Church of Christ issues their 2005 resolution. He also accused \\"an ad hoc group made up of Sabeel representatives and UCC officials\\" of becoming unduly involved in the resolution process. The PCUSA resolution also created much controversy, leading to a 2006 Synod renouncing the resolution that was made under the consultation of Sabeel. Criticism In addition to the mainline opposition groups that have formed as a result of Sabeel's activity, there have been other groups that have opposed either Sabeel's goals or their manner of speaking their message. In some cases, groups have accused Sabeel of extremism and antisemitism. Sabeel's most vocal critics are listed below with their most significant criticisms also listed. =Coe College= The chair of the Department of Philosophy and Religion at Coe College (Iowa), which had co-sponsored a campus conference with a group of American supporters of Sabeel, acknowledged in a letter to a local rabbi that anti-Semitic remarks had been made at the conference. The chair wrote \\"We regret any harm that may have been caused by such anti-Semitic statements\\", but later told journalists covering the story that his letter was not an apology, and that it was deliberately vague because he was unsure exactly which comments could be considered anti-Semitic.Anti-Semitic remarks made at Presbyterian college event =Stephen Roth Institute= The Israeli Stephen Roth Institute claimed that Sabeel \\"commonly engages in blatant propaganda seeking to isolate and demonize Israel, while delegitimizing the right of the Jewish state to exist.\\" Stephen Roth Institute For The Study Of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism - Annual Reports - Country Report, Canada 2005 Sabeel responded that \\"It accepts the presence of Israel in the land that was once Palestine and asks that the two peoples be allowed to live together in this land as equals with full rights for people of both groups.\\"., FAQ, Friends of Sabeel_North America, 2013 =Dexter Van Zile, CAMERA, and Judeo-Christian Alliance= Dexter Van Zile, Christian Media Analyst for the pro-Israel media- monitoring group CAMERA, has accused Ateek of trafficking in the anti-Semitic canard of Jewish deicide: Van Zile bases these accusations on fragments from Ateek's 2001 Easter message, such as, ‚Äúin this season of Lent, it seems to many of us that Jesus is on the cross again with thousands of crucified Palestinians around Him ...The Israeli government crucifixion system is operating daily,\\". Similarly, in a February 2001 sermon, Ateek likened the occupation to the ‚Äústone placed on the entrance of Jesus‚Äô tomb. ... This boulder has shut in the Palestinians within and built structures of domination to keep them in. We have a name for this boulder. It is called the occupation.‚Äù Sabeel's comparisons of Palestinians to the crucified Jesus and Israel to his murderers is also rejected by the ADL as an \\"ugly and false deicide charge against all the Jewish people - a concept rejected by prominent historians and repudiated by the Roman Catholic Church and other Christian denominations.\\" The Judeo-Christian Alliance has also promoted Van Zile's paper, entitled \\"Sabeel's One State Agenda\\", claiming that Sabeel has failed to draw attention to the mistreatment of Christians by Muslim extremists in areas under the control of the Palestinian Authority. Van Zile also accused Ateek of breathing new life into what French historian Jules Isaac called the ‚Äúteachings of contempt‚Äù and having directed their \\"vile energy\\" toward the Jewish State. Sabeel disagrees with these characterizations of their beliefs and actions. They have published a statement affirming their belief that the ancient Jews were not responsible for the death of Jesus, and that neither Palestinians nor Israelis have a \\"vocation for suffering\\"http://coptorthodox.blogspot.com/2010/10/suffering-is-vocation-of- christians.html that requires either people to be stateless., FAQ, Friends of Sabeel‚ÄìNorth America, fosna.org, 2013 =Anti-Defamation League= The Anti- Defamation League (ADL), in a backgrounder article on Sabeel, accused the organization of \\"generating hostility towards Israel\\" citing \\"its use of theologically charged accusations\\" as belying \\"its professed passion for reconciliation.\\" The ADL further submitted that, \\"Sabeel rejects Zionism on theological grounds. It has promoted the idea that Zionism is based on a false reading of the Bible and that it stands for injustice and in opposition to God.\\" =Criticism of, and support for Old South Church= The Boston Globe's conservative columnist Jeff Jacoby criticized Boston's historic Old South Church, a congregation of the United Church of Christ, for hosting the Most Reverend Doctor Desmond Tutu as part of that church's Engaging Three Faiths spiritual dialog series, and Sabeel's Apartheid Paradigm in Palestine-Israel conference. Jacoby argued that \\"Sabeel and Ateek's denunciations of Israel have included imagery explicitly linking the modern Jewish state to the terrible charge that for centuries fueled so much anti-Jewish hatred and bloodshed\\" and that \\"In Ateek's metaphorical telling, in other words, Israel is guilty of trying to murder Jesus as an infant, of killing Jesus on the cross, and of seeking to prevent his resurrection.\\" Rabbi Arthur Waskow, director of the Shalom Center, and Rabbi Howard A. Berman, founder of Jewish Spirit have expressed support for, and are participants in Old South Church's Engaging Three Faiths series. During his presentation at Old South Church on October 28, 2007, Waskow raised concerns about Sabeel's use of crucifixion imagery in reference to Israel. Waskow said that in Latin America, Christian liberation theologians often \\"talk about the crucifixion of Jesus by the Roman Empire ... and from their view point of course the resurrection of the Christ as teaching of what it means to transcend imperial power, in the Latin American context it's clear that the empire you're talking about is America and it makes sense.\\" Waskow said that Sabeel may think it's doing the same thing when it talks about the crucifixion of Jesus, but \\"when you are doing it in the context of a Jewish state, when you're doing it in the context of 2000 years of Jewish suffering from the Christian dogma of deicide that the Jews killed God and the violence that has been visited on the Jewish community by people upholding that theology, to hear that strikes a nerve that has 2000 years of pain behind it and that has to be heard.\\" =Sabeel's Responses to Frequently Asked Questions= Sabeel has posted responses to questions about its policies and theology at http://fosna.org/faq . In October, 2010, the Anti-Defamation League issued its list of \\"the top 10 anti-Israel groups in America\\" http://fosna.org/content/adl-top-ten ADL's List of Top Anti-Israeli Groups, October, 2010 and included Friends of Sabeel‚ÄìNorth America (FOSNA) and Jewish Voice for Peace among them.

Tintin (; ) was a weekly Franco- Belgian comics magazine of the second half of the 20th century. Subtitled \\"The Magazine for the Youth from 7 to 77\\", it was one of the major publications of the Franco-Belgian comics scene and published such notable series as Blake and Mortimer, Alix, and the principal title The Adventures of Tintin. Originally published by Le Lombard, the first issue was released in 1946, and it ceased publication in 1993. Tintin magazine was part of an elaborate publishing scheme. The magazine's primary content focused on a new page or two from several forthcoming comic albums that had yet to be published as a whole, thus drawing weekly readers who could not bear to wait for entire albums. There were several ongoing stories at any given time, giving wide exposure to lesser-known artists. Tintin was also available bound as a hardcover or softcover collection. The content always included filler material, some of which was of considerable interest to fans, for example alternate versions of pages of the Tintin stories, and interviews with authors and artists. Not every comic appearing in Tintin was later put into book form, which was another incentive to subscribe to the magazine. If the quality of Tintin printing was high compared to American comic books through the 1970s, the quality of the albums was superb, utilizing expensive paper and printing processes (and having correspondingly high prices). Publication history =Early history: 1946 to 1949= Raymond Leblanc and his partners had started a small publishing house after World War II, and decided to create an illustrated youth magazine. They decided that Tintin would be the perfect hero, as he was already very well known. Business partner Andr√© Sinave went to see Tintin author Herg√©, and proposed creating the magazine. Herg√©, who had worked for Le Soir during the war, was being prosecuted for having allegedly collaborated with the Germans, and thus was without a publisher. After consulting with his friend Edgar Pierre Jacobs, Herg√© agreed. The first issue, published on 26 September 1946, was in French. It featured Herg√©, Jacobs, Paul Cuvelier and Jacques Laudy as artists, with their mutual friend Jacques Van Melkebeke serving as editor. (Due to suspicions of incivism left over from the war, Van Melkebeke was forced to step down as editor soon after.)Van Melkebeke entry, Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Accessed 16 December 2013. A Dutch edition, entitled Kuifje, was published simultaneously (Kuifje being the name of the eponymous character Tintin in Dutch). 40,000 copies were released in French, and 20,000 in Dutch. For Kuifje, a separate editor-in-chief was appointed, Karel Van Milleghem. He invented the famous slogan \\"The magazine for the youth from 7 to 77\\", later picked up by the other editions. (Van Milleghem gave Raymond Leblanc the idea for the animation studio Belvision, which became the largest European animation studio, producing ten feature-length movies, including a few featuring Tintin. It was Van Milleghem who also introduced Bob De Moor to the magazine and to Herg√©. De Moor became a regular in the magazine and the main artist in the Studio Herg√©.) In 1948, the magazine grew from 12 to 20 pages and a separate version for France was launched. A group of new young artists joined the team: the French √âtienne Le Rallic and Jacques Martin, Dino Attanasio and the Flemish Willy Vandersteen. For decades, Herg√© had artistic control over the magazine, even though he was sometimes absent for long periods and new work of his became rarer. His influence is highly evident in Vandersteen's Suske en Wiske for which Herg√© imposed a stronger attention to the stories, editing, and a change of art style. The Tintin- voucher In order to keep its readership loyal, Tintin magazine created a sort of fidelity passport, called the \\"Ch√®que Tintin\\" in France (Tintin- voucher) and \\"Timbre Tintin\\" in Belgium (Tintin-stamp), which was offered with every issue of the magazine, in every comic album by Le Lombard, and on many food products as well. These stamps could be exchanged for various gifts not available in commercial establishments. Other brands, mostly from food companies, affiliated themselves with the Tintin voucher system: they could be found on flour, semolina boxes, etc. A Tintin soda existed, and even Tintin shoes. The French Railways Company went as far as to propose 100 km of railway transportation for 800 stamps. Among the gifts, there were super chromos extracted from the magazine issues, or original art. At the time the vouchers were initiated, the magazine was selling 80,000 copies in Belgium and only 70,000 in France. Due to the success of the vouchers, the circulation in France quickly rose to 300,000 a week. The vouchers disappeared by the end of the 1960s. =The 1950s= In the 1950s new artists and series showed up: *Tibet with his humorous western Chick Bill and his detective series Ric Hochet *Raymond Macherot, with his fantasy series Chlorophylle and detective series Clifton *Maurice Mar√©chal - Prudence Petitpas. *Jean Graton with Michel Vaillant *Albert Uderzo and Ren√© Goscinny with Oumpah-pah The magazine became more and more international and successful: at one time, there were separate versions for France, Switzerland, Canada, Belgium and the Netherlands, with about 600,000 copies a week. The magazine had increased to 32 pages, and a cheaper version was created as well: Chez Nous (in French) / Ons Volkske (in Dutch), printed on cheaper paper and featuring mainly reprints from Tintin magazine, plus some new series by Tibet and Studio Vandersteen. =The 1960s= In the 1960s the magazine kept on attracting new artists. The editorial line was clearly bent towards humor, with Greg (as editor-in-chief and author of series such as the remake of Zig et Puce), Jo-El Azara (with Taka Takata), Dany (with Olivier Rameau) and Dupa (with Cubitus). Other authors joined the magazine, like William Vance (with Ringo and Bruno Brazil) and Hermann (with Bernard Prince). =The 1970s= In the 1970s the comics scene in France and Belgium went through important changes. The mood for magazines had declined in favor of albums in the late 1960s. In 1965, Greg was appointed chief editor. He transformed the editorial line, in order to keep the pace with the new way of thinking of the time. The characters gained psychological dimensions, real women characters appeared, and sex. New foreign artists series were added to the magazine. Moralizing articles and long biographies disappeared as well. These transformations were crowned with success, leading to the at the Lucca comics festival, awarded to the magazine in 1972 for the best publication of the year. Greg quit his chief editor position in 1974. The major new authors in the 1970s were: *Derib (Buddy Longway) *Franz (Jugurtha) *Cosey (Jonathan) *Gilles Chaillet (Vasco) *Jean- Claude Servais *Hugo Pratt (Corto Maltese) *Will Eisner (The Spirit) And more in the humor vein: *Turk & De Groot with Robin Dubois =The 1980s and 1990s= The 1980s showed a steady decline of popularity of Tintin magazine, with different short-lived attempts to attract a new audience. Adolescents and adults preferred (A SUIVRE), if they read comics at all, and younger children seemed less inclined to read comic magazines and preferred albums. Still, some important new authors and series started, including Grzegorz Rosi≈Ñski, with Thorgal, and Andreas, with Rork. At the end of 1980, the Belgian edition was cancelled, leaving the French edition remaining. In 1988, the circulation of the French version had dropped to 100,000, and when the contract between the Herg√© family and Raymond Leblanc finished, the name was changed to Tintin Reporter. Alain Baran, a friend of Herg√©, tried to revive the magazine. The magazine disappeared after six months, leaving behind a financial disaster. The circulation of the magazine dropped dramatically, and publication of the Dutch version Kuifje ceased in 1992, and the French version, renamed Hello B√©d√©, finally disappeared in 1993. International editions * A Portuguese version was published between 1968 and 1983. * A Greek version existed during 1969‚Äì1972. * An Egyptian (Arabic) version existed from 1971 to 1980. Spirou and Tintin rivalry From the beginning, Tintin magazine was in competition with Spirou magazine. As part of a gentleman's agreement between the two publishers, Raymond Leblanc of Le Lombard and Charles Dupuis of Dupuis, if one artist was published by one of the magazines, he would not be published by the other one. One notable exception, however, was Andr√© Franquin, who in 1955, after a dispute with his editor, moved from the more popular Spirou to Tintin. The dispute was quickly settled, but by then Franquin had signed an agreement with Tintin for five years. He created Modeste et Pompon for Tintin while pursuing work for Spirou. He quit Tintin at the end of his contract. Some artists moved from Spirou to Tintin like Eddy Paape and Liliane & Fred Funcken, while some went from Tintin to Spirou like Raymond Macherot and Berck.

Biography Meyer was born to a low- income Jewish family in Paris.Jewish Telegraph Agency: \\"Andre Meyer, Jewish Banker, Gives $2,500,000 to New York University\\" October 29, 1965 As a boy, he began following the workings of the stock market and out of necessity left school at age sixteen to work as a messenger at the Paris Bourse. Ambitious, he used his time to study the intricacies of stock trading and because of personnel shortages created by so many young French men serving in the military in World War I, he was able to get a job with Baur & Fils, a small Paris bank. By 1925, his performance with the bank made him noticed by Raymond Philippe who arranged for him to get an offer from the prestigious investment bankers Lazard Fr√®res and within a few years Meyer was made a partner, succeeding to Raymond Philippe. At Lazard, Andr√© Meyer organized SOVAC (Societ√© pour la Vente √† Cr√©dit d'Automobiles), a finance company that in the late twenties introduced the concept of automobile financing for consumers. It made Lazard Fr√®res a significant force in consumer credit as well as in product leasing. As well, from 1927, representing Lazard along with Paul Frantzen and Raymond Philippe, Andr√© Meyer was elected to Board of Directors of the failing automobile giant Citro√´n. They took charge of company expenditures and substantially reduced operating costs while putting together a financial restructuring plan that saved the company from liquidation. For his service to the economy of France, the government awarded him with the Legion of Honor. Married with two children, Meyer, who was Jewish, and his family were forced to flee France following the Nazi occupation during World War II. He came to Lazard Fr√®res' New York City office with Chairman Pierre David-Weill (1900‚Äì1975) and following the Allied Forces liberation in 1944 David-Weill returned to France and Meyer was appointed head of the American operations, a position he would occupy for the rest of his life. Andr√© Meyer, called \\"the most creative financial genius of our time in the investment banking world\\" by David Rockefeller, became one of the most important people in American business with an influence that extended around the globe. Known as \\"The Picasso of Banking,\\" he introduced innovative financing techniques to post-War American business. During the 1960s, Meyer was responsible for making Lazard Fr√®res the top mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) firm in the U.S. He put together prodigious deals through leveraged buyouts for companies such as International Telephone & Telegraph Company (ITT) who grew to become the ninth largest industrial corporation in the United States. Although he personally was publicity-shy, Andr√© Meyer was an advisor to the Kennedy family and a lifelong friend and advisor to Jackie Onassis. He was a friend and advisor to other high-profile public figures such as William S. Paley at CBS and Katharine Graham at The Washington Post'. He was also a close confidant of U.S, President Lyndon Johnson, consulting at the Oval Office several times a year during Johnson's tenure. An avid collector of art objects, Meyer's eclectic assemblages included paintings by Claude Monet, Marc Chagall, and Pablo Picasso, sculptures, Louis XIV furniture, and original music scores. In 1961, he gave artwork to Museum of Modern Art in New York, including a major work by Paul C√©zanne. Following his death, the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired his collection of 19th century European art. His collection of music scores began with works by Georg Muffat and Jean-Philippe Rameau, and expanded to include scores by Georg Frideric Handel, Fran√ßois Couperin, Antonio Vivaldi, Vincent L√ºbeck, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Christoph Willibald Gluck, a sketchleaf of Ludwig van Beethoven once owned by Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, Johann Kuhnau, Domenico Scarlatti, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Johann Christian Bach, and Carl Friedrich Abel. When his collection was sold by Sotheby's on 16 and 17 October 2012, they noted that the collection contained beautifully bound 16th and 17th century scores by composers whose manuscripts rarely come up at auction anymore including Orlande de Lassus, Claudio Monteverdi, Jacques Arcadelt, Crist√≥bal de Morales, Luca Marenzio, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Marco da Gagliano, Girolamo Frescobaldi, Jacopo Peri & Ottavio Rinuccini, and Antonio Cesti, among others.Sotheby's, London, De la collection musicale Andr√© Meyer: Manuscrits, Imprim√©s et Oeuvres d'Art, Paris 16 & 17 Octobre 2012, 11. Andr√© Meyer maintained a vacation home in Crans-sur-Sierre, Valais, Switzerland and while there in the summer of 1979, he fell ill. He died of circulatory problems in the Nestl√© Hospital in Lausanne, and was interred near his closest friend and business partner Pierre David-Weill in the Jewish section of the Cemetery of Montparnasse in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, France. Legacy Felix Rohatyn credits Meyer as his mentor.

He is a Democrat. Donnelly attended private schools in Suffolk County. He graduated from Catholic Memorial High School in West Roxbury, in 1963. He received a Bachelor of Science from Boston University in 1970. He was a teacher and coach in the Boston public schools. He was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, 1973‚Äì1978, where he served as assistant majority leader in 1977‚Äì1978. Donnelly was elected as a Democrat to the 96th and to the six succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1979 ‚Äì January 3, 1993), but was not a candidate for renomination in 1992 to the 103rd Congress. While in Congress, Donnelly served on the Committee on Public Works and Transportation and, beginning in 1985, on the Committee on Ways and Means. During his tenure in Congress, Donnelly authored, along with Congressman Bill Archer of Texas, legislation to repeal the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-360) after the law became politically unsustainable. The law's political unsustainability reached its peak when the chairman of the committee that drafted the law was chased from his district office by angry senior citizens protesting it. The enactment of the Donnelly legislation restored the Medicare program to its pre-1988 status. Donnelly's second major accomplishment in Congress was the enactment of the so-called \\"Donnelly Visa\\" program, which authorized 5,000 visas annually for citizens of countries that had been historically under-represented in the United States' immigration system that primarily relies on family reunification. The primary beneficiaries of the Donnelly Visa program, in its early years, were Irish nationals ‚Äì many of whose families lived in Donnelly's South Boston district. Congress reauthorized the program in 1990; today, it is known as the Diversity Visa (DV) program and authorizes 50,000 visas annually to nationals of countries statistically deemed under-represented in the current immigration system. Donnelly's original intent was for the program to benefit Irish nationals but the reach of the program is far broader today. As a Knight of Columbus, he helped defeat an effort to tax fraternal insurance companies which would have diminished their ability to make charitable contributions. In 1994, he was named United States Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago. He served in this capacity until 1997. In 1998, he ran for Governor of Massachusetts, finishing third in the Democratic primary behind state Attorney General Scott Harshbarger and former state Senator Patricia McGovern.

Billikopf had a long and distinguished career in public service work. He served as superintendent of the United Jewish Charities in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Kansas City, Missouri, before becoming the executive director of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, chairman of the National Labor Board for the Philadelphia region during the first years of the New Deal. He served as impartial chairman of both the Ladies' Garment industry and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in Philadelphia. He later represented the department stores of Philadelphia in their labor relations. He was also a member of the board of trustees of the New School for Social Research, and president of the board of trustees of Howard University. In 1937 and 1938 he dedicated himself full-time to bringing European Jewish refugees into the United States. Following World War II he served on the Clemency Board in Washington which was established to review court martial sentences. Early life and education The son of Louis (Layzer) Bielikov and Glicke Katzenellenbogen, Billikopf emigrated to the United States from Vilnius, Lithuania (then part of Russia) in 1895 and settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he attended local schools. His intelligence was quickly noted by his teachers, so the majority of his public education was devoted to helping him master the English language.The Jewish South., January 14, 1898 At the age of 15 he became a regular contributor to the Richmond, Virginia weekly publication, The Jewish South, calling himself \\"Jacob Billikopf (the Russian boy)\\". He attended the University of Richmond before transferring to the University of Chicago in 1903 where he received his undergraduate degree, Ph.B., Bachelor of Philanthropy. He achieved some fame as a chess prodigy.http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/prodigies.html Social service career In 1907, Billikopf moved on to Kansas City, Missouri, where he became superintendent of the United Jewish Charities, while contributing to the establishment of public baths, night schools, a municipal loan agency and free public legal aid. During this period he befriended philanthropist William Volker, when Kansas City was gripped by high unemployment and crime rates, as well as overcrowded jails. Billikopf, Volker, and attorney Frank P. Walsh served on a volunteer, nonpolitical committee dedicated to undertaking action to resolve these social debacles. Their proposal, to create a Board of Pardons and Paroles to supervise the correctional institutions and to handle the pardons and paroles of municipal inmates, was adopted in 1908. Out of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, in 1910, grew the Board of Public Welfare, the first of its kind in the country. Billikopf was a board member and Volker the president. The board oversaw provision of social services and family aid, free legal advice, a loan agency and the inspection of factories and work places. Beginning in 1913, when he was only thirty, he was included in Who‚Äôs Who In America. In 1914, the NAACP recruited Billikopf and other Jewish leaders for its board. In 1916 Billkopf was elected President of the National Association of Jewish Workers.Kansas City Journal, May 11, 1916 In 1917 Billikopf left Kansas City and came to New York City where he became the executive director of the American Jewish Relief Committee which raised $20,000,000 for the aid of displaced European Jews after World War I. In 1920 he settled in Philadelphia, where he became the first full-time Director of the Federation of Jewish Charities, known today as the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia.Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia, History https://www.jewishphilly.org/about-us/history He also held positions with many public and private welfare agencies, most notably as president of the National Conference of Jewish Social Service.

While in Philadelphia, he married Ruth Marshall, daughter of famed Jewish leader and lawyer, Louis Marshall.

Today the word garage has both senses; for example, Jay Leno's Garage is a series about his collection and other interesting collections, not merely the buildings that contain them. A residential garage (, ) is a walled, roofed structure for storing a vehicle or vehicles that may be part of or attached to a home (\\"attached garage\\"), or a separate outbuilding or shed (\\"detached garage\\"). Residential garages typically have space for one or two cars, although three-car garages are used. When a garage is attached to a house, the garage typically has an entry door into the house, called the person door or man door, in contrast with the wider and taller door for vehicles, called the garage door, which can be raised to permit the entry and exit of a vehicle and then closed to secure the vehicle. A garage protects a vehicle from precipitation, and, if it is equipped with a locking garage door, it also protects the vehicle(s) from theft and vandalism. Most garages also serve multifunction duty as workshops for a variety of projects, including painting, woodworking, and assembly. Some garages have an electrical mechanism to automatically open or close the garage door when the homeowner presses a button on a small remote control, along with a detector that stops movement of the garage if something is in the way of closing. Some garages have enough space, even with cars inside, for the storage of items such as bicycles or a lawnmower; in some cases, there may even be enough space for a workshop or a man cave. Garages that are attached to a house may be built with the same external materials and roofing as the house. Garages that are not connected to the home may use a different style of construction from the house. Often in the Southern and rural United States garages not attached to the home and made from a timber frame with sheet metal coverings are known as \\"pole barns\\", but usually serve the same purpose as what is called a garage elsewhere. In some places, the term is used synonymously with \\"carport\\", though that term normally describes a structure that, while roofed, is not completely enclosed. A carport protects the vehicle to some degree from inclement weather, but it does not protect the vehicle from theft or vandalism. The word garage, introduced to English in 1902, originates from the French word garer, meaning shelter.The Shorter Oxford Dictionary (1973) By 1908 the architect Charles Harrison Townsend was commenting in The Builder magazine that \\"for the home of the car, we very largely use the French word 'garage', alternatively with what I think the more desirable English equivalent of 'motor house. Today the word is polysemic because it can refer to a collection of vehicles as well as the building that contains them.  Residential garage insulation  In northern climates, temperatures inside an uninsulated attached residential garage can decrease to freezing levels during the winter. Temperatures inside an uninsulated attached garage in temperate climates can reach uncomfortable levels during summer months. Extreme temperatures can be a source of energy waste and discomfort in adjoining living areas, due to heat transfer between the garage and those areas. Homes with an attached garage often experience this \\"interface\\" problem. Insulating the outside of the building against the elements without extending the insulation to the wall separating the garage from the house, and/or the other garage walls and roof, can be a costly mistake.\\"How to make your home energy efficient\\"; Howstuffworks.com  In Australia  Australian homes typically have a two, one and a half or double car garage, with some newer houses having a triple garage, with one double door and one single door. Prior to the 1970s most of them were detached from the house, usually set further back with the driveway leading up past the side of the house, common with old fibreboard houses, but not uncommon with earlier brick houses. The most common doors on these garages were either two wooden barn style doors with a standard sized access door on the side of the garage, or the B&D; Rolla Door, which is described below. The most common garage door to date in Australia is the B&D; Rolla Door, having been around since 1956 and still in heavy use today. They are a corrugated flexible but strong sheet steel door, sliding up tracks and rolling around a drum mounted above the door opening on the inside of the garage. These come in manual and remote controlled electric (known as the Control-a-Door), with conversion kits available. Locking is provided by a key lock in the centre of the door moving two square sliding lock bars in and out of holes in the door tracks, locking and unlocking it, or by the solenoid lock in the automatic motor. Newer homes feature more American styled tilting panel lift doors which slide up onto a track on the ceiling via a motor and chain drive. Since the late 1970s most if not all garages are attached, and throughout the 80's it became more common to have an access door into the home from the garage where design permitted, whereas it is commonplace now. Most older unit (apartment) blocks in Australia have garages on the ground floor accessible through a common hallway and access doors, all leading into a common driveway. Newer ones now have underground parking. Australia has strict guidelines in place when building a home and the garage size must conform to the Australian Standards. The minimum size for a single garage is 3.0 m √ó 5.4 m (9.8 ft √ó 17.7 ft) and a double is 5.4 m √ó 5.4 m (17.7 ft √ó 17.7 ft). However, to comfortably fit two cars in a double garage it is typical to have a size of 6.0 m √ó 6.0 m (19.7 ft √ó 19.7 ft).  In the United Kingdom  Up- and-over garage door Insulation of sectional garage door British homes featuring a garage typically have a single or double garage either built into the main building, detached within the grounds (often in the back garden), or in a communal area. Traditionally, garage doors were wooden, opening either as two leaves or sliding horizontally. Newer garages are fitted with metal up- and-over doors. Increasingly, in new homes, such doors are electrically operated. Typically, a small British single garage is , a medium single garage is , and a large single garage is . Family sedans have become bigger than they were in the past, so the larger size has become a preferred option. A typical large family car like the Ford Mondeo is about , meaning that even with the larger size garage, it is necessary to park to one side to be able to open the driver's door wide enough to enter or exit the vehicle. In the early days of the motor car, a garage played an important role in protecting the vehicle from the weather (particularly so as to reduce rust). It was also the case that early motor cars started more easily when they were warm, so that keeping them in a garage rather than outside made it easier to get the engine going in the morning. Modern motor cars, however, are very well protected against rust, and modern engines start with no difficulty even in very cold conditions. =Early history= The common term for these structures in the first decades of the 20th century was motor house. Many garages from before 1914 were pre- fabricated, typically by companies such as Norwich manufacturer Boulton & Paul Ltd. The style was usually in keeping with that of the house and its locale, however, they were mainly of timber construction and few have survived. E. Keynes Purchase, \\"honorary architect\\" to what was to become the Royal Automobile Club, did a lot of work on them and recommended in The Car Illustrated in 1902, that they be of brick construction with cement floor, an inspection pit, good electric lighting and a pulley system for removing parts of the car (in the early days of motoring many car owners were mechanical and engineering enthusiasts). The architecture of garages was ignored in the architectural journals despite famous architects such as Edwin Lutyens, Richard Barry Parker and Edgar Wood all designing garages for their wealthy clients. Charles Harrison Townsend was one of the few architects who put pen to paper (in The Builder in 1908) on the subject and recommended that the walls be glazed brick for ease of washing, air gratings to be low (petrol fumes are heavier than air), and drains half open to avoid build-up of gases. By 1910 corrugated iron and asbestos were being used instead of wood and garages became less imposing. From 1912 speculatively built houses in London were being built with motor houses.  In North America  A modern one-car garage, in the United States Many garage doors open upward using an electric chain drive, which can often be automatically controlled from inside the resident's vehicle with a small radio transmitter. Garages are connected to the nearest road with a driveway. Interior space for one or two cars is normal, and garages built after 1950 usually have a door that connects the garage directly to the interior of the house (an \\"attached garage\\"). Earlier garages were often detached and located in the back yard of the house, accessed either via a long driveway or from an alley. In the past, garages were often separate buildings from the house (\\"detached garage\\"). On occasion, a garage would be built with an apartment above it, which could be rented out. As automobiles became more popular, the concept of attaching the garage directly to the home grew into a common practice. While a person with a separate garage must walk outdoors in every type of weather, a person with an attached garage has a much shorter walk inside a building. Around the start of the 21st century, companies began offering \\"portable garages\\" in the United States. Typically, these garages are made of metal, wood or vinyl and do not connect to the house or other structure, much like the garage built before 1950. This portable garages usually have a strongly reinforced floor to hold a heavy vehicle. Garages are also produced as composite fabric garages with metal frames that are lightweight and portable garage compared to traditional brick-and-mortar or metal garage structures. Over the past fifteen years, the portable garage has further evolved into a modular garage or a partially prefabricated structure. The modular garage comes from a factory that assembles the garage in two sections and combines the two sections on location. Partially prefabricated garages are often larger and might even include an attic space or a second floor. Sections of the garage are preassembled and then setup on site over a few days time. The Amish have become popular builders of portable, modular and partially prefabricated garages. Over the last decade, garage flooring products have become more readily available to the general public. In fact, the volume of garage flooring on the market today can serve as a source of frustration and confusion for homeowners. Generally speaking, these products can be broken into the following categories: garage floor mats, garage floor tiles, coatings (including epoxy, urethanes and hybrids), sealers and densifiers as well as garage floor containment systems. Notable garages The first planned private garages appeared long before 1900. Early examples of planned public garages appeared at the same time. The first recorded public parking garage in the US (Electric Vehicle Company Garage,Shannon Sanders McDonald: The parking garage. Design and evolution of a modern urban form, Washington 2007, p. 16 Chicago) was built in 1898, in the UK (Christal Palace Garage,Kathryn A. Morrison, John Minnis: Carscapes: The Motor Car, Architecture and Landscape in England, New Haven/London 2012, p. 167 London) in 1900 and in Germany (Gro√ügarage der Autom√ºller G.m.b.H.,Ren√© Hartmann: Die Hochgarage als neue Bauaufgabe ‚Äì Bauten und Projekte in Berlin bis 1933 (Magisterarbeit), Technische Universit√§t Berlin 2009 Berlin-Wilmersdorf) in 1901. Possibly the oldest existing garage in the United Kingdom is in Southport Lancashire. It was the first motor house or garage to be depicted in an English motoring journal and was in The Autocar of 7 October 1899. It was owned by Dr W.W. Barratt, a local doctor and motoring pioneer and specially designed for his house at 29 Park Crescent Hesketh Park. A two-storey building that matched the style of the house; the ground floor garage having a concrete floor, heating, electric lighting, an engine pit and was fully equipped. The motor house is now in residential use. One of the oldest surviving private garages in Germany today is the 1903 finished Automobil-Remise (automobile carriage house) of Villa Esche by Henry van de Velde in Chemnitz. Carl Benz, the inventor of the automobile, had a tower built for himself in 1910, on the first floor a room for studying, on the ground floor car parking space. It still exists in Ladenburg, Germany.

She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She also writes about baseball, but is not to be confused with a writer of the same name who specializes in Asian cookbooks. Life and career Tan first wrote professionally as a teenager. She wrote a monthly column for Superteen magazine and also wrote features for Teen Machine, two popular teen titles published by the conglomerate Sterling's Magazines. Her aspiration was to be a science fiction writer, and she idolized Roger Zelazny, Marion Zimmer Bradley, and Ray Bradbury. She attended Brown University and received her BA in linguistics and cognitive science in 1989. Shortly thereafter, she took a job at Beacon Press in Boston. At the same time, she discovered the leather community via the newsgroup alt.sex.bondage and the science fiction/fantasy fan community through conventions like Arisia and Gaylaxicon. She was one of a cabal of five conspirators who began hosting BDSM play parties at science fiction conventions (known as \\"asb parties\\" after the newsgroup). The first one was at the July 1991 Gaylaxicon in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, followed soon after by a party at Philcon in November that drew hundreds of participants. Later, other eager fans took up the duties and Tan ceased hosting these parties. alt.sex.bondage was also the first place Tan published her erotic science fiction writing, posting stories and vignettes with some regularity in 1991 and 1992.\\" By 1992 she decided to leave her job at Beacon Press to pursue a master's degree in writing at Emerson College. On her final day of work at Beacon, she returned home to find her first acceptance letter for the publication of a story waiting in her mailbox. It was for the story \\"A True Story\\", which was accepted into the anthology Herotica 4, edited by Susie Bright. Tan played baseball in a women's league in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, known as the Pawtucket Slaterettes, but retired after the 2007 season. She holds a black belt in tae kwon do, receiving her second degree (dan) in June 2009, and is a certified technician in Okazaki Restorative Massage. She was also a longtime BDSM/leather community activist, joining NLA: New England in 1991, founding the Fetish Fair Fleamarket in 1992 and going on to direct almost 50 Fetish Fair Fleamarket events throughout New England (Boston, Providence, and other cities) as well as those in Houston, Atlanta, and Charlotte, NC. She served on the board of the New England Leather Alliance (NELA), and was given the Woman Of The Year Award from the National Leather Association International in 2001, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Leather Association International in 2004. She was also awarded the Pantheon of Leather President's Award in 2011. She retired from formal involvement with BDSM community activism in 2013, citing health reasons, but continues to speak, teach workshops and classes, and appear at BDSM and leather/fetish events as a writer and educator.

Circlet's first book was a chapbook of Tan's erotic science fiction stories, entitled Telepaths Don't Need Safewords. Mate by Lauren P. Burka soon followed, as did a host of small anthologies like SexMagick, TechnoSex, and Worlds of Women. Tan received her master's degree in professional writing and publishing in 1994 from Emerson and devoted herself to writing and running Circlet Press full-time thereafter. By June 2009, Circlet Press had published over fifty titles, most of them erotic science fiction with occasional forays into related genres. Circlet branched into digital publishing in 2008, and released nearly 100 ebook titles between 2008 and the end of 2013. As editorial director of Circlet Press, Tan was the creator of the press's later imprints, Clasp Editions to publish sf/f erotic romance, and Gressive Press, for exploring sexuality outside the \\"big binaries\\" (gay/straight, male/female) with themes of bisexuality, transgender issues, and other sexualities not easily labeled. Publishing history Tan herself has had her work published in a variety of outlets. Her stories have appeared in Ms. Magazine, Penthouse, Asimov's Science Fiction, Absolute Magnitude, Best American Erotica, Best Lesbian Erotica, Nerve.com, and many, many other places. Her collection of short stories, Black Feathers, appeared in 1998 from HarperCollins. A follow-up collection of erotic short stories, White Flames, was published in 2008 by Running Press. Tan moved into writing erotic romance ebooks in 2009 with the publications of Mind Games and The Hot Streak from Ravenous Romance. Her erotic romance novel series known as the Magic University series was published in ebook form by Ravenous Romance and in trade paperback by Red Silk Editions, an imprint of Red Wheel Weiser.

Slow Surrender, published by Hachette/Grand Central Publishing, was the first of a trilogy in the newly created romance category of \\"BDSM billionaire\\" (created by the publishing industry in the wake of the runaway success of 50 Shades of Grey by E.L.

It is located at 6500 Quander Road, Alexandria, Virginia 22307 and is part of Fairfax County Public Schools. History Entrance of West Potomac High School West Potomac High School was formed by combining the student bodies and staff of Groveton and Fort Hunt High Schools in 1985. The Fairfax County School Board, citing costs and declining enrollment as causes, decided to close Fort Hunt and combine the schools on Groveton's site under a new name. The school's facilities have been expanded significantly since the merger, with two wings added to the main building over the intervening years. The old Groveton High School on Popkins Lane (opened in 1956) houses the Bryant Alternative High School; the site of Fort Hunt High school (opened in 1963) became Carl Sandburg Middle School, which is the middle school that feeds into West Potomac. The new Groveton High School was built on the site of the former Bryant Intermediate School and opened in 1976. In its inaugural year, the school adopted the motto \\"The Tradition Begins Now.\\" After several years, it was modified to \\"Excellence is a Tradition\\". A rivalry with neighboring Mount Vernon High School exists because of their close proximity. Historically Groveton and Ft. Hunt were rivals, Groveton also was an athletic rival with nearby T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria; their football games for a very long time were only scheduled on Saturday afternoons rather than Friday nights partly because the field at T.C. Williams had no lights. The 1971 Groveton vs T.C. Williams game was portrayed in the movie Remember the Titans. The West Potomac school mascot is a wolverine. The school's colors are blue, white, and silver. Demographics In the 2017‚Äì18 school year, West Potomac High School's student body was 38.65% White, 16.31% Black, 34.76% Hispanic or Latino, 6.75% Asian and 3.53% Other.

It was formed in 1894 when the parish of Wokingham was split into two parts ‚Äî one rural and one urban. The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census is 7,011. The parish originally curved around Wokingham proper from north to south in a west-facing crescent. The area to the north is called Ashridge (anciently called Hertoke). This is the region of Wokingham parish which was, until 1844, officially a detached part of Wiltshire. However, in more recent years, this area has been transferred to the parish of St Nicholas Hurst. The area to the south of Wokingham is modern Wokingham Without. It consists of the ecclesiastical parish of St. Sebastian's, formed in 1871, divided into two sections. The largely rural north includes the hamlets of Heathlands (alias St Sebastians), Holme Green and Gardeners Green. The southern end of the parish is more urbanized, and includes Ravenswood (anciently called Bigshot) and what is really an extension of the Crowthorne urban area. Ludgrove School at Wixenford is actually just in Wokingham Without, rather than Wokingham.

A right-arm fast bowler, he played 15 Test matches and 29 One Day Internationals for Zimbabwe between 1996 and 2002. After being dropped from the international side after the 2002 Champions Trophy, he took up work as a cricket commentator for television, and he has remained in that line of work since. His nickname \\"Pommie\\" arises from his pseudo-accent that he claims to have picked up during his brief studies in England. However, his formative school years were undertaken in Zimbabwe, a fact that his intonation and pronunciation of certain words and phrases betray. Given a qualification of twenty innings, Mbangwa has the lowest batting average (2.00) of all Test cricketers. However, , he is one of nine Zimbabweans to have taken 30 Test wickets, and of those only Heath Streak and David Brain took them at a lower average. Mbangwa's rise to prominence was all the more remarkable as he had no family background in cricket. A little short of the top pace, he was primarily a line-and-length bowler, using both seam and swing, with the away-swinger his stock ball. He spent a year at school in England, and in 1996 he went to Madras for coaching by Dennis Lillee; on his return he was offered a place in the Plascon Academy in South Africa, which he attended from April to September 1996. A surprise choice for the Zimbabwe tour of Pakistan in 1996‚Äì97, he made his Test debut after the first choice bowlers were injured but made the most of his opportunity, taking the vital wickets of Ijaz Ahmed and Wasim Akram. But thereafter he struggled to maintain consistency, and his lack of pace meant that he was easy picking for international batsmen. He drifted in and out of the side, before disappearing from the international scene. In 2001 he started television commentary, where his quiet thoughtful views were well received, and in 2005 he ended a brief foray into coaching by committing full-time to his TV career. He was one of international cricket's genuine No. 11s.

Nurdeen Deuraseh and Mansor Abu Talib (2005), \\"Mental health in Islamic medical tradition\\", The International Medical Journal 4 (2), p. 76-79 The term is cognate with the Hebrew word nephesh, ◊†÷∂◊§÷∂◊©◊Å. In the Quran, the word nafs is used in both the individualistic (verse 2:48) and collective sense (verse 4:1), indicating that although humanity is united in possessing the positive qualities of a nafs, they are individually responsible for exercising the agencies of the \\"free will\\" that it provides them. Much of the popular literature on nafs, however, is focused on the Sufi conceptions of the term. According to the Sufi philosophies, the nafs in its unrefined state is \\"the ego\\", which they consider to be the lowest dimension of a person's inward existence ‚Äî his animal and Satanic nature. Nafs is an important concept in the Islamic tradition, especially within Sufism and the discipline of gnosis (irfan) in Shia Islam. Quranic concept The triliteral root n≈´n fƒÅ sƒ´n (ŸÜ ŸÅ ÿ≥) occurs 298 times in the Quran, in four derived forms: #once as the form V verb tanaffasa (ÿ™ŸéŸÜŸéŸÅŸéŸëÿ≥Ÿé) #once as the form VI verb yatanƒÅfasi (ŸäŸéÿ™ŸéŸÜŸéÿßŸÅŸéÿ≥Ÿê) #295 times as the noun nafs (ŸÜŸéŸÅŸíÿ≥) #once as the form VI active participle mutanƒÅfis≈´n (ŸÖŸèÿ™ŸéŸÜŸéŸ∞ŸÅŸêÿ≥ŸèŸàŸÜ) The noun nafs has important instances in the Quran such as the following: \\"O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves...\\" Quran Surah Al-Maaida ( Verse 105 ) The major theme of the word nafs as used in the Quran is to instill a sense of individual responsibility through a strong emphasis on the choices made by the individual (as in 5:105), while at the same time reminding humanity of its common origins (verse 4:1). The Quran affords much importance to the nafs of an individual, highlighting the agency of free will and intelligence, without which neither responsibility nor accountability can exist. The Quran does not attribute to the nafs any inherent properties of good or evil, but instead conveys the idea that it is something which has to be nurtured and self-regulated, so that it can progress into becoming 'good' and 'inwardly meaningful' through its thoughts and actions. The Quranic conception of the nafs therefore has an extremely modernistic undertone, much like Nietzsche's conception of \\"√úbermensch\\" or 'Superman', as suggested by Muhammad Iqbal, a prominent Muslim scholar and philosopher, who went as far as to accuse Nietzsche of borrowing the term from Islamic thought. Iqbal stated: \\"It is probable that Nietzsche borrowed it (√úbermensch) from the literature of Islam or of the East and degraded it by his materialism.\\" Sufism's conception of nafs =Three principal stages= There are three principal stages of nafs in Sufistic Wisdom, also mentioned in different verses of the Quran. The Sufis call them \\"stages\\" in the process of development, refinement and mastery of the nafs. An imprint of the Theosophical Publishing House. =The inciting nafs (an-nafs al- æammƒÅrah)= In its primitive stage the nafs incites us to commit evil: this is the nafs as the lower self, the base instincts. In the eponymous Sura of the Quran, Yusuf says \\"Yet I claim not that my nafs was innocent: Verily the nafs incites to evil.\\" Islam emphasizes the importance of fighting the inciting nafs in Quran as well as in hadith. One tradition holds that Muhammad said after returning from a war, \\"We now return from the small struggle (Jihad Asghar) to the big struggle (Jihad Akbar)\\". His companions asked, \\"O prophet of God, what is the big struggle?\\" He replied, \\"The struggle against nafs.\\" This stage is generally divided into the levels al nafs al-hayawaniyya and al nafs al-iblissiyya. Al nafs al-hayawaniyya (\\"the animal state\\") describes the self, which runs after material possessesion, sensual desires and animalistic pleasures. Al nafs al-iblissiyya is even lower than the animal state, because the self seeks to replace God in the love for itself.Oliver Leaman The Qur'an: A Philosophical Guide Bloomsbury Publishing 2016 page 84 The Quran enjoins the faithful \\"to hinder the nafs from lust\\", and another traditional narration warns that \\"the worst enemy you have is [the nafs] between your sides.\\" Rumi warns of the nafs in its guise of religious hypocrisy, saying \\"the nafs has a rosary and a Koran in its right hand, and a scimitar and dagger in the sleeve.\\" Animal imagery is often used to describe the nafs. A popular image is a donkey or unruly horse that must be trained and broken so that eventually it will bear its rider to the goal. Rumi compares the nafs to a camel that the hero Majnun, representing the intellect ('Aql), strains to turn in the direction of the dwelling-place of his beloved. =The self-accusing nafs (an- nafs al-luwwƒÅmah)= In Sura al-Qiyama the Quran mentions \\"the self-accusing nafs\\". This is the stage where \\"the conscience is awakened and the self accuses one for listening to one‚Äôs ego. One repents and asks for forgiveness.\\" See google book search Here the nafs is inspired by one‚Äôs heart, sees the results of one‚Äôs actions, agrees with one's brain, sees one's weaknesses, and aspires to perfection. =The nafs at peace (an-nafs al-mu·π≠ma æinnah)= In Sura al-Fajr the Quran mentions \\"the nafs at peace\\". This is the ideal stage of ego for Muslims. On this level one is firm in one‚Äôs faith and leaves bad manners behind. The soul becomes tranquil, at peace. At this stage, followers of Sufism have relieved themselves of all materialism and worldly problems and are satisfied with the will of God. Four additional stages of nafs In addition to the three principal stages, another four are sometimes cited: =The Inspired Nafs (an-nafs al-mulhamah)= This stage comes between the second (The self-accusing Nafs ) and the third (the Nafs at peace) principal stages. It is the stage of action. On this level \\"One becomes more firm in listening to one‚Äôs conscience, but is not yet surrendered.\\" Once one have seen one's weaknesses and have set one's targets, this ego inspires one to do good. The Sufis say that it is important that whenever one think of good, one must immediately act upon it. Abbas Bin Abdul Muttalib lays down three rules: #Ta'Jeel or Swiftness. A good deed must be done immediately and there should be no laziness. #Tehqeer or Contempt. One must look at one's good acts with contempt otherwise one will become self-righteous. #Ikhfa or Secrecy. One must keep one's good acts secret otherwise people will praise one and it will make one self-righteous. According to the Quran, charity should be given both secretly and openly. In Muhammad Asad's translation of the Quran, 14:31 reads: \\"[And] tell [those of] My servants who have attained to faith that they should be constant in prayer and spend [in Our way], secretly and openly, out of what We provide for them as sustenance, ere there come a Day when there will be no bargaining, and no mutual befriending.\\" =The pleased nafs (an-nafs ar- ra·∏çƒ´yyah)= This stage comes after the third principal stage. On this level \\"one is pleased with whatever comes from Allah and doesn‚Äôt live in the past or future, but in the moment.\\" \\"One thinks always: ‚ÄòIlahi Anta Maqsudi wa ridhaka matlubi‚Äô. One always sees oneself as weak and in need of Allah.\\" =The pleasing nafs (an-nafs al-mar·∏çƒ´yyah)= On this level the two Ruhs in man \\"have made peace\\". \\"One is soft and tolerant with people and has good Akhlaq (Arabic: ÿ£ÿÆŸÑÿßŸÇ), good manners.\\" =The pure nafs (an-nafs a·π£-·π£ƒÅfƒ´yyah)= On this level \\"one is dressed in the attributes of the Insan Kamil, the perfected man, who is completely surrendered and inspired by Allah.\\" One is \\"in full agreement with the Will of Allah\\". =Full sequence of nafs development= Therefore, the full sequence of the seven stages of the development of the nafs is as follows: # The inciting nafs (an-nafs al-  æammƒÅrah) # The self-accusing nafs (an-nafs al-luwwƒÅmah) # The inspired nafs (an-nafs al-mulhamah) # The nafs at peace (an-nafs al-mu·π≠ma æinnah) # The pleased nafs (an-nafs ar-ra·∏çƒ´yyah) # The pleasing nafs (an-nafs al-mar·∏çƒ´yyah) # The pure nafs (an-nafs a·π£-·π£ƒÅfƒ´yyah) Dervishes from the Jerrahi school of Sufism are encouraged to study a text describing these stages of nafs as a nested series of cities. Characteristics of nafs In its primitive state the nafs has seven characteristics that must be overcome: #Pride (Takabbur) #Greed (Tamaa) #Jealousy (Hasad) #Lust (Shahwah) #Backbiting (Gheebah) #Stinginess (Bokhl) #Malice (Keena) See also *The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam *Islamic psychological thought *Lataif-e-sitta *Seven deadly sins Notes References *The three rules of Abbas Bin Abdul Muttalib and the section on Characteristics of nafs are translations from the Persian text Shahid ul Wojood, written two hundred years ago. *Hadith External links * Quran Search: Al-Islam.org Category:Shia theology Category:Self Category:Sufi philosophy Category:Sufi psychology Category:Islamic terminology ","title":"Nafs"},{"id":"3022456","text":"Pacific Palisades is an American soap opera that aired on Fox during prime time from April to July 1997.

The Muslim interpretation of the Holy Spirit is generally consistent with other interpretations based upon the Old and the New Testaments. Further, the Quran refers to r≈´·∏• as Ruh al-qudus (, \\"the holy spirit\\" or \\"spirit of holiness\\") and al-ruh al-amin (\\"the faithful/trustworthy spirit\\"). The holy spirit is more commonly known as archangel Gabriel ( the messenger to all the prophets. In Sufism, r≈´·∏• (; plural arwah) is a person's immortal, essential self ‚Äî pneuma, i.e. the \\"spirit\\" or \\"soul\\". The Quran itself does not describe r≈´·∏• as the immortal self.Jane I.

Rowson BRILL 2017 p. 7 Further, it appears to be a metaphorical being, such as an angel. In one instance, r≈´·∏• refers to Jesus.

Quranic commentators disagreed in their identification of Gabriel with various uses of the word r≈´·∏•. The Arabic phrase al-Qudus () translates into English as \\"Holiness\\" or \\"Sanctity\\".Lane's Arabic Dictionary, p. 2497. al-Qudd≈´s \\"the All-Holy\\" is one of the 99 Names of God in Islam., = In the Quran = The phrase r≈´·∏• al-qudus, commonly translated as the \\"holy spirit\\" or the \\"spirit of holiness\\", occurs four times in the Quran, in Surah Al-Baqarah verse 87and 253, Al-Ma'idah verse 110, and An-Nahl verse 102. In three instances, it is described as the means by which God \\"strengthened\\" Jesus, and in the fourth it is identified as the one brought down God's truth to his prophet. Some Muslim commentators connected this expression with the \\"faithful/trustworthy spirit\\" (al-ruh al-amin) who is said to have brought down the Quran in verse , and identified with Gabriel. Other Muslim commentators viewed it as identical with the created spirit described in other Quranic verses as the means by which God brought Adam to life (e.g., ), made Mary conceive Jesus and inspired angels and prophets (e.g., ). The spirit who together with \\"the angels\\" descends and ascends to God (, , ) was also identified with Gabriel in Quranic commentaries. Thus, the figure of Gabriel became a focus of theological reflection on the content of revelation and the nature of cognition itself, with distinctions articulated between reason, prophetic revelation, and mystical knowledge. =In Shia Islam= In Shia Islam, r≈´·∏• is described as \\"a creature (khalq) of God, grander than Gabriel or Michael\\", who was sent to inform and guide Muhammad and is now with the Imams. In some Shia traditions, ruh al-qudus (spirit of holiness) is one of the five spirits possessed by the Imam. Unlike the other four spirits, it is always vigilant and available to inform the Imam on any issue. There is disagreement on whether ruh is an angel. =As interpreted to refer to the Archangel Gabriel= The term R≈´·∏• al- Qudus is also an epithet referring to the Archangel Gabriel,T√∂z√ºn Issa Alevis in Europe: Voices of Migration, Culture and Identity Routledge 2016 who is related as the Angel of revelation and was assigned by God to reveal the Qur ºan to the prophet Muhammad and who delivered the Annunciation to Mary.What is meant by the Holy Spirit in the Qur'an? Islam Awareness In the two suras in which the Qur'an refers to the angel Gabriel, it does so by name., However, some ahadith and parts of the Qur ºan may arguably lend support to the alternative view. It appears to be indicated by the Quran in sura Maryam, ayat 16‚Äì21, that it was the angel Gabriel who gave to Mary the tidings that she was to have a son as a virgin: It is narrated in hadith that the angel Gabriel accompanied Muhammad during the Mi'raj, an ascension to the heavens in which Muhammad is said to have met other messengers of God and was instructed about the manner of Islamic prayer (sujud). (Bukhari .) It is also held by Muslims that the angel Gabriel descends to Earth on the night of Laylat al-Qadr, a night in the last ten days of the holy month of Ramadan, which is said to be the night on which the Qur ºan was first revealed.  As soul  God is believed to endow humans with r≈´·∏• and nafs (, psyche, i.e. ego or \\"(inner) soul\\"). The r≈´·∏• \\"drives\\" the nafs, which comprises temporal desires and sensory perceptions. The nafs can assume control of the body if the r≈´·∏• surrenders to bodily urges. The nafs is subject to bodily desire, whereas the r≈´·∏• is a person's immaterial essence, beyond the emotions and instincts shared by humans and other animals; r≈´·∏• makes the body alive.

Biography He was born in New York City and graduated Columbia University in 1869 and Columbia Law School in 1871. He practiced law in New York until 1876, when he moved to Richmond, Indiana, and married Mary Taylor Reeves.Foulke 1922, p. 1-29. Foulke became involved in local politics and was elected to the Indiana State Senate from 1882 to 1886. As a senator, he introduced bills to reform the state‚Äôs civil service system.Foulke 1919, p. 14-15. In addition, he investigated abuses against inmates and employees at the state hospital for the insane.Foulke 1919, p. 16-34. He served on the Platform Committee of the Progressive Party. In 1889 he was asked by the National Civil Service Reform League to investigate the U.S. Federal civil service. President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Foulke a Commissioner in the Civil Service Commission in 1901.Foulke 1922, p. 107-108. He was a critic of the Ku Klux Klan, which had strong membership in Richmond, and was threatened with flogging for his views. He was also one of the early presidents of the American Woman Suffrage Association, the first president of the Proportional Representation League, and (for five years) president of the National Municipal League.Foulke 1922, p. 84-99. As a writer, Foulke wrote on a number of diverse subjects. In 1898, he published a biography of Oliver Hazard Perry Morton. Later, he translated the medieval History of The Lombards by Paul the Deacon. Other works include Biographical Introduction to Some Love Poems of Petrarch (1916). Foulke was a major supporter of the Richmond Group of artists and was one of the founders of the Richmond Art Museum in 1898. He loaned paintings for early exhibitions and donated many works in the museum's permanent collection. Some of his poems include Honor to France. Foulke wrote two memoirs: Fighting the Spoilsmen (1919), where he recounted his career in fighting for civil service reform. There followed a more general reminiscences, A Hoosier Autobiography (1922). Friend of Russian Freedom Foulke was interested in Russia and Russian history since the 1880s. He was scared by the encroachments of Russian Empire in Central Asia and in the Far East. He supposed that Russian ambitious foreign politics would be a great menace to \\"free Institutions\\". In 1887 he published a pamphlet \\"Slav or Saxon\\", showing aggressive intentions of Tsarist regime. In that time he also protested against the ratification of Russian- American Extradion treaty, but all efforts were in vain. In 1893 the treaty was ratified. In 1903 Foulke became the president of the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom. The society was reestablished in Boston by Alice Stone Blackwell. As Foulke recalled, \\"this association had no very definite organisation, but acted as occasion offered\\". Foulke and other notable Americans (Blackwell, Wald, Howe, Addams), who endorsed Russian revolutionists and liberals in their fighting against the autocracy, encouraged Russian emigre Breshko-Breskovskaya in 1904-1905, when she arrived in the USA for tapping moral support and some money. In popular culture Foulke appears as a supporting character in Harry Turtledove's alternate history novel series Southern Victory.

Origin  In 1573, a company of Foot Guards was raised. In 1599, a guard regiment, called His Highness' Guard Regiment of Foot, or the Regiment Nassau, was created. A second guard regiment, the Regiment of Foot Guards, was raised in 1643, into which the Company of Foot Guards was incorporated. When Prince Willem III became Stadtholder, the Regiment of Foot Guards lost its guard status and became a line regiment; the Company of Foot Guards was transferred to a new guard regiment raised in 1672, named His Highness' Guard Regiment of Foot. This regiment lost all its commanders in the battle of Seneffe (August 11, 1674); the commander of the Regiment Nassau, Major-general Van Solms, amalgated both regiments into one guard regiment, the Nassau Regiment becoming the 1st battalion, and His Highness' Guard Regiment of Foot becoming the 2nd battalion. The regiment was renamed His Majesty's Guard Regiment of Foot in 1689. From 1688 to 1699 it served as William III of Orange's Guards regiment. Under King William III, the regiment served in England as his personal guard. During this time, it was also known as the \\"Blue Guards\\", because of the Nassau blue coats with yellow/orange cuffs and lining. After Willem III died in 1702, the regiment was renamed the Dutch Guards. The uniform became dark blue with poppy red lining and cuffs; white metal buttons on the coat, and white lace loops; waistcoat and breeches became white. This uniform was worn throughout the 18th century. In 1699, William negotiated the second partition treaty (with France) in coordination with the Dutch Estates General and Betnick but left the English Parliament out of the loop. In revenge, they stopped funding his Dutch Guards, and he contemplated abdication: \\"I am so angry (William to Heinsius) about what is happening in the House of Commons in the matter of the troops, that I can hardly concentrate my thoughts on anything else. I foresee that I shall have to come to extreme decisions and that I shall see you in Holland earlier than I had intended\\".Marc Geerdink- Schaftenaar, For Orange and the States. The Army of the Dutch Republic, 1713-1772 part 1: Infantry. 2018 Helion and Company.  Campaigns and battles  Notable campaigns in which the guards fought included the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì97) in which distinguished themselves at the Battle of the Boyne, battle of Fleurus and the siege of Limerick (1690). After the death of William III in 1702, the regiment went back to the Netherlands and during the War of the Spanish Succession (1702‚Äì1712) was the backbone of the Dutch army. In that war, the Dutch army was the second largest in Europe. In particular, the Dutch pioneered the development of platoon fire, which allowed infantry formations to fire continuously, which gave the Dutch an advantage in firepower over armies not using the platoon fire system. The Blue Guards of the Allied armies under the command of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, a British general, and distinguished themselves in the Battles of Malplaquet and Oudenaarde. They were not present at the Allied victory of Blenheim, but they greatly distinguished themselves at the Battle of Ramillies, under the command of Colonel Wertmuller, storming two French held villages on the Allied left. They also fought bravely and suffered heavy losses at Malplaquet, fighting under the command of the Prince of Orange on the Allied left flank. During the War of the Austrian Succession, they took part in the campaign in Germany in 1743, the Battles of Fontenoy and Rocoux and the defence of Brussels and of Bergen op Zoom. After the war, the Republic maintained a policy of strict neutrality. The Dutch Guards came into action once again during the campaigns of 1793 and 1794 against the armies of Revolutionary France. Disbanding After the Dutch Republic had been invaded by the French troops in 1795 and the Stadtholderate had come to an end, the Republic was reformed and became the Batavian Republic. The Dutch Guards and other guard units, as representatives of the Ancien R√©gime, were disbanded the same year.

It has a land area of . Politically, the island is administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Flora and fauna Desecheo, which has no known bodies of surface water, reaches a maximum elevation of 715 ft (218 m) and has an annual precipitation, on average, of 40.15 in (1020 mm). The lack of surface water limits its flora to thorny shrubs, small trees, weeds and various cacti, including the endangered higo chumbo (Harrisia portoricensis). Fauna includes various species of seabirds, three endemic species of lizard (Ameiva desechensis, Anolis desechensis and Sphaerodactylus levinsi), introduced goats and rats, and a population of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) introduced from Cayo Santiago in 1967 as part of a study on adaptation. Before the introduction of rhesus monkeys the island was the largest nesting colony of the brown booby, however, no species presently nests on the island. Geology Although politically part of Puerto Rico, along with the islands of Mona and Monito, Desecheo is not geologically related to the main island. It is believed that the island has been isolated, at least, since the Pliocene. However, the island is part of the Rio Culebrinas formation which suggests that it was once connected to Puerto Rico. History No evidence of Pre-Columbian human settlement of the island has been uncovered. Christopher Columbus was the first European to visit the island during his second voyage to the New World; however, it was not named until 1517 by Spanish explorer Nu√±ez Alvarez de Arag√≥n.Desecheo - Welcome to Puerto Rico.org. Retrieved on August 14, 2006. During the 18th century the island was used by smugglers, pirates and bandits to hunt imported feral goats. During World War II, and until 1952, the island was used as a bombing range by the United States Armed Forces. From 1952 to 1964 the United States Air Force used Desecheo for survival training. In 1976 administration of the island was given to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and in 1983 it was designated as a National Wildlife Refuge. In 2000 it received a Marine reserve designation and fishing is allowed within 1/2 mile around the island.Guia Informativa para la Pesca Recreativa en Puerto Rico (aka, Reglamento de Pesca de Puerto Rico).

Accessed 24 March 2016. Conservation and Restoration In the early 1900s, Desecheo NWR was still a major nesting ground for thousands of seabirds. Approximately 15,000 Brown Boobies, 2,000 Red-footed Boobies (Sula sula), 2,000 Brown Noddies (Anous stolidus), 1,500 Bridled Terns (Onychoprion anaethetus), and hundreds of Magnificent Frigatebirds (Fregata magnificens), Laughing Gulls (Larus atricilla), and Sooty Terns (Onychoprion fuscatus) nested here. Invasive mammals, including goats and rats, began to impact Desecheo NWR early in the 20th century. Around and during the time of World War II, the island was used as an artillery range by the US Air Force. That and the invasive species‚Äô damage to Desecheo's ecosystem have been severe, and by the turn of the millennium, virtually no seabirds were using the refuge. In response, in 2016 the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Island Conservation, and other key partners, including the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Bell Laboratories and Tomcat, worked together to remove invasive rats from the island. One year later, Desecheo Island was declared free of invasive species, and signs of recovery were observed, including Audubon's Shearwaters sighted on the island for the first time and new Bridled Tern nests discovered. In addition, 72 Federally Threatened Higo Chumbo cactus, (Harrisia portoricensis), were found and measured pre (2003-2010) and post eradication (2017). In 2017, individuals with flowers and huge yellow fruits were observed which is a good sign for the overall reproductive status of the population. Diving Because of a healthy reef and clear waters, with common visibility ranging from , Desecheo is a very popular place for diving fans. Although diving is permitted around the island, the refuge is closed to the public due to the presence of unexploded military ordinances. Trespassers are subject to arrest by Federal law enforcement officers. Amateur radio As a separately administered area, under Amateur Radio rules Desecheo is considered a distinct \\"entity\\" for DXCC award purposes. Several DXpeditions have gone to the island, which has the ITU prefix KP5 (although since there is no permanent mailing address there the Federal Communications Commission does not actually grant this callsign). The Fish & Wildlife Service currently restricts such operations. The first approved DXpedition in fifteen years was allowed on the island between February 12 and 26, 2009, making 115,787 contacts. Attempts to allow public access to Desecheo and the island of Navassa, which is located between Haiti and Jamaica, were made in the U.S. Congress, but the bill failed to reach the floor of the House of Representatives prior to the end of the 109th Congress, rendering the proposal dead.

Early life Latifa Bint Alaya El Arfaoui was born in Manouba, Tunisia. In 1983, shortly after her father died, Latifa and her family took a trip to Egypt to rest and mourn. During that time, she met composer Baligh Hamdi, who advised her that she ought to move to Egypt for the sake of her career. However Latifa wanted to concentrate on her education. She returned to Tunisia to finish her high school final exams. Due to financial issues, she could not go back to Egypt, so she attended college in Tunisia, studying Dutch literature for a year and a half. Her family decided to help her make her dream come true by sending her to Egypt, so she quit college in Tunisia and joined the Arab Academy of Music in Egypt, from which she earned her bachelor degree. She is preparing for her master's degree. Composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab happened to hear her on the radio. Two days later he went to the Academy to find out more about her, leaving Latifa speechless as she discovered he wanted to speak with her. At the time she primarily performed long Tarab songs, but she was interested in doing something new. She began to work with composer Ammar El Sherei and poet Abdulwahab Muhammed, whom she met during her first visit to Egypt. Albums Many of Latifa's early albums (1984s) have Arab style. The album Mesa Al Jamal (\\"Evening Of Beauty\\") made Latifa Bint Alayah Al Arfaoui famous in Egypt. \\"Akthar Min Roohi\\" (\\"More than My Soul\\"), was released in 1986. She began singing Arab pop songs with music by Ammar El Sherei and lyrics by Abdulwahab Muhammed. The album was hugely successful all over the Arab world. The songs had very original ideas and distinctive styles, and Latifa began making her songs shorter and adding different influences such as tango music. She also shot a music video for the single \\"Ew'ah Tegheer\\" (\\"Don't Be Jealous\\") which was extremely popular. The huge success of this album allowed Latifa Bint Alayah Al Arfaoui to buy half the shares of her producer's company and studio, La Reine. Since then, she has co-produced all her own albums and music videos. In 1997, Latifa released the album Al Ghinwa (\\"The Song\\") considered follow up to \\"Akthar Min Roohi\\" from a previous album. Latifa then decided to perform a new style of songs called Qasa'ed Fos'ha. Her next album, 1998's Taloomoni Al Donya (\\"The World Blames Me\\"), featured Latifa singing lyrics written by the poet Nizar Qabbani.http://www.latifaonline.net/v4/Ar/bio/aff/?MBR+,tUUP1ERXhVPSJUT- AM.QjM9-gM.Izc3VmbfRWamIESW-QM.

The album was distributed by Universal Music France, and it was the first album in which Latifa performed in another language. The Franco-Arab song \\"Inchallah\\" made the Elle Magazine top 5. In the Arab World, \\"Inchallah\\" (\\"God willing\\"), Kerehtak (\\"I Hated You\\") and Wadeh (\\"Clear\\") were popular singles. The 2002 variety album Desert Roses and Arabian Rhythms II featured Latifa performing an Arab Mawwal in the song \\"Take Me I'm Yours,\\" and singing a small part in both Arabic and English with Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook of the band Squeeze. Latifa won the World Music Award 2004 for best selling artist in the Middle East and North Africa because of the album Ma Etrohsh Ba'ed (\\"Don't go away\\") produced in the year 2003 by Alam El Phan(Mazzica TV). In 2004, Latifa produced an album distributed by Warner Brothers France, titled Les Plus Belles Chansons De Latifa (\\"Latifa's Best Songs\\").

A version of the character appeared in the fifth season of The Flash, played by actor Kyle Secor. This version is Thomas Snow who is the father of Caitlin Snow. Icicle also appeared on the first season of the DC Universe streaming service show Stargirl as Jordan Mahkent, the main antagonist and leader of the Injustice Society, played by Neil Jackson while Hunter Sansone appears as his son Cameron Mahkent. Publication history The Joar Mahkent version of Icicle first appeared in All-American Comics #90 and was created by Robert Kanigher and Irwin Hasen. The Cameron Mahkent version of Icicle first appeared in Infinity, Inc. #34 and was created by Roy Thomas, Dann Thomas, and Todd McFarlane. Fictional character biographies =Dr. Joar Mahkent= When noted European physicist Dr. Joar Mahkent arrived in America with his latest scientific discovery, spectators at dockside were astonished to witness the luxury liner upon which Mahkent was traveling suddenly frozen solid in Gotham Harbor. Investigating this phenomenon, the original Green Lantern (Alan Scott) was shocked by the sight of Dr. Mahkent shot dead in his stateroom, apparently the victim of Lanky Leeds, a notorious racketeer who was reportedly traveling on the same ship. Thus, when the bizarrely costumed criminal known as the Icicle appeared upon the scene later that same day, wielding a unique weapon capable of instantly freezing solid any moisture in the air, Green Lantern presumed he was actually Lanky Leeds, who had stolen Doctor Mahkent's invention. After several frustrating encounters, Green Lantern ultimately unmasked the Icicle as Joar Mahkent himself, who had, in fact, murdered Lanky Leeds, using his cold ray gun to temporarily disguise Leeds' face as his own. Attempting to escape from Green Lantern, the Icicle leaped off a 20-story building and apparently plunged to his death in the Gotham River far below.All American Comics #90. DC Comics. Actually, the Icicle survived his fall into the river, and returned to plague the Emerald Gladiator time and time again, eventually becoming a member of the Wizard's second Injustice Society of the World which succeeded in briefly hypnotizing the Justice Society of America. During their Patriotic Crimes, the Icicle stole the Washington Monument. Later he was a founding member of the Crime Champions of Two Earths, along with the Wizard and the Fiddler, which teamed up with a trio of crooks from Earth-1 after the Fiddler accidentally discovered a way to travel between worlds. The Icicle committed a million-dollar robbery on Earth-2 and escaped Hourman and Doctor Fate. He was defeated by Doctor Fate while robbing a museum on Earth-1. The Justice League and the Justice Society were captured and imprisoned in cages in space by the Crime Champions though, but escaped with the help of the Green Lanterns. All the villains were then captured. The Icicle met his death during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, when he and several other supervillains attempted to invade the laboratory of the renegade Oan known as Krona. The storyline Batman: Hush revealed that, as young children, Bruce Wayne and Thomas Elliot witnessed a fight between Alan Scott and the Icicle during a visit in Metropolis, which inspired both of them to consider the importance of the tactical expertise that they would use in their future costumed careers. Joar Mahkent has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the Hall of Justice. =Cameron Mahkent= Cameron Mahkent has no need for a 'cold gun', as his father's prolonged exposure to the weapon altered his genetics, allowing him to biologically pass down to his son the ability to freeze objects and people or to lower the temperature of a room or other area. Cameron's skin pigmentation was also affected, making him appear to be albino.Infinity Inc. #34. DC Comics. Cameron became the second Icicle shortly before joining the Wizard's Injustice Unlimited group. It was during the period of the DC mini-series Legends (1986), the people of America were turned against their heroes, and a law was made that no one could operate as a crimefighter legally wearing a costume. This did not affect the villains much, as they were already breaking the law. For the new Icicle, it proved an opportune time to join with other super-criminals. He joined the Wizard in his new Injustice Society ‚Äì called Injustice Unlimited. The group overcame the security at the International Trade Conference in Calgary, Alberta, Canada... namely Infinity, Inc. and a contingent of the Global Guardians and forced the heroes to help in some mayhem. The Icicle was given the mission of finding and retrieving the man-monster called Solomon Grundy. He took with him the still hypnotized Icemaiden and Jade and they traveled to the Arctic Circle. They were successful in the mission and brought back the white behemoth to Calgary, just in time to interfere with the escape plans of the Wizard. The plan of blackmailing the wealthy businessmen went haywire when Hourman (Rick Tyler) revived and freed himself. In the confusion of the battle, however, Cameron was able to escape.Infinity Inc. #35-37 (1987). DC Comics. Only weeks later he again joined with Artemis and Hazard, as well as the new Harlequin, the Dummy and Solomon Grundy. The Dummy wanted to head a revived Injustice Unlimited and planned to murder the members of Infinity Inc. to make a name for themselves. Their first target - Skyman - was successfully killed by the Harlequin and then Icicle went after Brainwave Jr. After believing the mental mutant dead the Icicle returned to his cohorts. A plan was hatched to bring all the remaining Infinitors to Stellar Studios and kill them, a plan defeated only by the unwillingness of Hazard to cooperate, and the sudden reappearance of Brainwave Jr. and Jade (both of whom had been thought dead). The Icicle nearly killed Brainwave Jr. in hand-to-hand combat but was knocked out by Jade. In the end Cameron was given over to law enforcement.Infinity Inc #51-53 (1988). DC Comics. Later, after he engaged in battle against the second Star-Spangled Kid, S.T.R.I.P.E. and Starman, he joined the new Injustice Society at the invitation of Johnny Sorrow, who released him from his prison cell. During Stealing Thunder, when the Ultra-Humanite remade the world after acquiring control of Johnny Thunder's Thunderbolt, he was forced to help the 'reserve JSA'- consisting of Captain Marvel, Hourman, the third Crimson Avenger, Power Girl, Sand and Jakeem Thunder- against the Ultra-Humanite, since they were the only other people free in the world created by the Ultra-Humanite. He was later offered a position in the JSA by Sand but turned him down saying that he only fought with Sand for his own reasons. Cameron does not care about his father's Golden age villainous legacy. He became a villain, not because of legacy, but because he's not a nice guy. He is a far more ruthless foe than his predecessor. He has begun a relationship with his teammate, the Tigress. As part of the Superman/Batman \\"Public Enemies\\" arc, the Icicle is part of a multi-villain attack on Superman and Batman in Washington D.C.. Despite working with other cold themed villains such as Killer Frost and Captain Cold and having the backing of President Lex Luthor, the Icicle and all the villains are soundly defeated. During the Infinite Crisis storyline, Cameron popped up as a member of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains. One Year Later, he is approached by Mirror Master to join the Suicide Squad for a mission. On the cover of Justice League of America #13 (Vol. 2), it shows Icicle as a member of the new Injustice League, though this was not corroborated by the story. He can seen as the member of Libra's Secret Society of Super Villains. Icicle and Tigress appear in the \\"Hourman and Liberty Belle\\" Second Feature in JSA All Stars. The story involves them alternately working with and against the heroic couple in a quest to locate a magical artifact. He and Tigress are expecting a baby, which appears to threaten Tigress' health. Icicle is trying to 'raise' money for expensive treatments.JSA 8--Page Giant 2011. DC Comics. In 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity.

Robin says \\"Holy Icicles!\\" and then Icicle shoots his freeze ray, but Superman deflects it right back at him with hands. * A character based on Icicle appears in the Justice League animated series: Dr. Blizzard (voiced by Corey Burton). In the episode \\"Legends\\", he is a member of the Injustice Guild. * Both versions of Icicle appear on Smallville in the two-part episode \\"Absolute Justice\\": Cameron Mahkent (played by Wesley MacInnes) and Joar Mahkent (played by Gardiner Millar). Cameron is responsible for the death of the Star-Spangled Kid/Sylvester Pemberton and Sandman under Amanda Waller's orders. After killing Doctor Fate, Cameron went to see the bed-ridden vegetative Joar. After revealing his plans, he pulled the plug on his father before donning Doctor Fate's helmet. Crashing into the Watchtower, he started a fight with Hawkman, Stargirl, Clark Kent and Green Arrow before being attacked by the repowered Martian Manhunter. Due to the Martian Manhunter's ability to phase through objects, Cameron's powers were useless and the members of the JSA and Justice League defeated Cameron. Hawkman delivered the finishing blow with the mace, knocking Fate's helmet off and returning Cameron to normal. Cameron was subsequently imprisoned in a heated room in Checkmate facility. There, Waller revealed that his attacks against the JSA had accomplished exactly what she had intended‚Äîbringing the team back together, part of a plan to save the world from \\"a coming apocalypse\\". When Cameron protested that this was not what he had signed up for, Waller shot and apparently killed him, as a \\"welcome\\" to the Suicide Squad. * Both versions of Icicle appear in the Young Justice animated series with Cameron Mahkent (called Icicle Jr.) voiced by Yuri Lowenthal and Joar Mahkent voiced by James Remar. Cameron first appeared in \\"Independence Day\\" is shown causing havoc on a bridge in Star City until he is taken down by Green Arrow and Speedy. In \\"Terrors\\", Joar appears where he, his son, and the ice-based villains (Killer Frost, Captain Cold and Mr. Freeze) specifically plan to start a breakout in Belle Reve. Icicle Jr. mentions to the disguised Superboy that his father acts as a jerk to him. Once the breakout and takeover has been done, Icicle Sr. has his son and Superboy had to break through the walls to the Women's side. Superboy convinces Icicle Jr. to \\"show some initiative\\". During this time, Icicle Jr. unwittingly aids Superboy and even helps fight off several villains, including starting a fight with Mr. Freeze. Shortly after, he discovers who Superboy really is and states \\"dad's gonna kill me\\". It turns out that Icicle Sr. was in cahoots with Hugo Strange as both are shown to be associated with the Light (Project Cadmus' Board of Directors). In \\"Beneath\\", Icicle Jr. appears in Bialya with Psimon, Mammoth, Shimmer, and Devastation where they assigned to guard a shipment of children to The Light's partner. When Devastation brings down Wonder Girl, Icicle Jr. tells her that she isn't alone. While Psimon and Miss Martian have a psychic battle, he tries to kill Miss Martian, saying his heart got broken after Belle Reve. Before Icicle can kill, Psimon is defeated by Bumblebee, allowing Miss Martian to defend herself by hurling Icicle Jr. into a wall. He is later seen at the end of the episode relatively unharmed. In \\"Darkest\\", Icicle Jr. is sent with Aqualad, Tigress, and the Terror Twins on a mission to attack Impulse and Blue Beetle. He manages to freeze Blue Beetle until he breaks free. When the Blue Beetle scarab takes control, he manages to knock down Icicle until Aqualad and Tigress subdue Blue Beetle. Icicle Jr. joins Aqualad, Tigress, and the Terror Twins into retreating back to Black Manta. * Icicle appears in Robot Chicken DC Comics Special, voiced by Tom Root. * A variation unrelated to any of the comics' iterations appears in season five of The CW's live-action series The Flash, portrayed by Kyle Secor. This version is Dr. Thomas Snow, the father of Caitlin Snow. The first half of season five sees Caitlin looking for her father, who had supposedly died 20 years earlier, after discovering that his death certificate was faked. In the episode \\"The Icicle Cometh\\", Caitlin, the Flash, and Cisco Ramon find Thomas and learn that he was attempting to find a cure for his and Caitlin's ALS gene, which resulted in them both getting ice powers. However, he claimed that unlike his daughter, who developed a split personality called \\"Killer Frost\\", he never developed one and is dying; with a serum based on Caitlin's D.N.A. being the only cure. Eventually, it is discovered that he did develop an alternate personality, later dubbed \\"Icicle\\", who was in control of Thomas's body the entire time and that he needed the serum to kill his other self. Icicle's plan is foiled when Killer Frost reemerges and destroys the serum, forcing him to flee. Icicle returns in the episode \\"Snow Pack\\", intending to eliminate Caitlin and her mother Carla's human sides. Just as Icicle is about to kill Caitlin, Thomas suddenly finds the strength to return to his human form. When Caitlin is attacked by the supervillain Cicada, Thomas sacrifices himself to save Caitlin and dies in her arms. ** Though he does not appear in \\"The Icicle Cometh,\\" Cameron Mahkent's name was used on Thomas' death certificate as the ME who signed off on his death. * A version of Joar Mahkent named Jordan Mahkent appears in the DC Universe series Stargirl, portrayed by Neil Jackson. This version is portrayed as the leader of the Injustice Society of America who lost his wife Christine (portrayed by Amanda Lavasanni) due to an illness and is supported in his campaign by his parents Sofus and Lily (portrayed by Jim Franco and Kay Galvan respectively). In the pilot episode, ten years prior to the series, Icicle led the ISA's attack on the Justice Society of America's headquarters; fatally wounding their leader Starman himself. In the years since, he settled down in Blue Valley as a businessman in his civilian identity and became the founder of Blue Valley business, The American Dream. In the episode \\"S.T.R.I.P.E.\\", Icicle meets with Injustice Society member Steven Sharpe to discuss the rise of Starman's successor, Stargirl. In his self-titled episode, Icicle engaged Stargirl and S.T.R.I.P.E. in battle, which led to the murder of fellow ISA member Wizard's son. When Icicle's associate confronted him about what happened, he froze him. In the episode \\"The Justice Society,\\" Icicle meets with the ISA to determine how to handle Stargirl after she starts rebuilding the JSA. In the two-part season one finale, \\"Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.\\", Icicle leads the ISA in enacting \\"Project: New America\\", but Stargirl's JSA foil their plans. After sustaining damage while fighting her and S.T.R.I.P.E., he was shattered by Mike Dugan using his dad's truck. ** Cameron Mahkent also appears in the show, portrayed by Hunter Sansone, with Roger Dale Floyd portraying him as a child. He appears as a student at Blue Valley High School and classmate of Stargirl's. In the episode, \\"The Justice Society,\\" he develops his cryokinetic powers after using his breath to extinguish a candle during a memorial dinner for Christine. =Film= * The Cameron Mahkent version of Icicle was also reportedly featured in David S.

It was the first of six Wignacourt towers to be built, and it was completed in 1610. It replaced the role of Ta' Tabibu farmhouse which was previously known as Dejma Tower. An artillery battery was added a century later in 1715. Today the tower is a museum. Wignacourt Tower was the second tower to be built in the Maltese islands, after Garzes Tower on Gozo. It was also the first tower to be built on the main island. As Garzes Tower was demolished in 1848, Wignacourt Tower is now the oldest surviving watchtower in Malta. History Wignacourt Tower with St Paul's Bay beyond, Malta, by Milson Hunt in 1806 The battery of Wignacourt tower By the end of the 16th century, Malta's harbour area was extensively fortified. However, the rest of the islands was virtually undefended, and the coastline was open to attacks by Ottomans or Barbary corsairs. This began to change in the early 17th century, when Martin Garzez, Grand Master of the Order of Saint John, allocated funds for the building of Garzes Tower on Gozo. Garzes' successor, Alof de Wignacourt, set out to build a series of towers around the coastline, which were personally funded by him and came to be known as the Wignacourt towers. The first tower was built to protect St. Paul's Bay, and was called Wignacourt Tower after the Grand Master. On 7 November 1609, plans and a model of the tower were presented to the Order's council. The first stone of was blessed and laid on 10 February 1610, and the accompanying ceremony was personally attended by Wignacourt himself. The tower cost 6748 scudi, 7 tari and 10 grani to build. Although there are claims that the tower was designed by Vittorio Cassar, he disappears from the Order's military records in around 1603. Cassar died in around June 1609, before work on the tower began. The architect of Wignacourt Tower was probably an unknown Maltese capomastro. The tower was the only major fortification in the north of Malta until the construction of Saint Agatha's Tower in 1649. It had Qawra Tower (built 1638), Buƒ°ibba Battery (built 1715) and Mistra Battery (built 1761) in its line of sight. A coastal battery was added to the tower in 1715 to house two 18-pounder guns. Buttressing was added to the lower half of the structure in around 1761. After Malta fell under British rule, the tower began to be used as a police station. A postal agency was located within the police station between 1891 and 1921, and during this period a postmark reading \\"St. Paul's Bay\\" was used. The police station closed in 1931, and from 1937 to 1963 the tower was occupied by the Post and Telephone Department. The tower's original entrance was on the first floor, and it was approached by a drawbridge from a flight of stone steps. The steps were removed in the 1950s when the road in front of the tower was widened. An entrance was added on the ground floor. The wheel of the drawbridge still exists, as well as the door and its key of the main entrance.https://dinlarthelwa.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/08/Vigilo-47.pdf Present day Marble plaque at the tower commemorating its restoration by Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa In 1967 the government issued a call for tenders for the lease of the tower, and it was leased to Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa in 1970. It was restored between 1973 and 1976. During restoration, the tower's turrets were completely rebuilt. A marble plaque with the following inscription was installed above the ground floor entrance: Since 1998, the tower has been a museum, and its exhibits include models of various fortifications found in the Maltese islands, reproductions of items used by the tower's occupants in the 17th and 18th centuries, old photos and a restored cannon. In 2010, the 400th anniversary of the tower was celebrated by the St. Paul's Bay Local Council, the Festa Committee and Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa by a series of events including re-enactments, tours, discussions and traditional Maltese folklore. The tower was restored and cleaned once again in 2015. In popular culture *The tower was depicted on a postage stamp issued by MaltaPost in 2006.

According to Sufi cosmology, God's reason for the creation of this cosmos and humankind is the \\"manifestation\\" and \\"recognition\\" of Himself as it is stated in Hadith Qudsi ‚Äì \\"I was a hidden Treasure; I desired to be recognized so I created the creature\\". Emanation Islamic Sufis describe the Divine Descent and the creation of universe and humankind in the following stages, when Noor-e-Ahadi (Light of One), coming out of His self-isolated oneness, intended to manifest Himself in multiplicity. These stages are also termed as ‚ÄúTanzalat-e-Satta. Many saints have explained these Tanzalat-e-Satta in their books. Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi has discussed them in his Arabic book called Tohfa Mursala. They are also discussed in the exegesis of Fusoos-ul-Hikam, a book by Ibn Arabi. * Alam-i-HaHoot (Realm of He-ness): The level of HaHoot refers to HaHooiyat (The Unknowable and Incomparable world). It is an Arabic term which pertains to the Divine's Essence prior to manifestation. The spiritual stage related to it is called Ahdiyat (Alonehood). This is the Realm of pre- existence and a level of non creation. According to sufis, this state of Ahdiyat is incapable of being conceived, incapable of interpretation and is beyond all logical bounds. At this stage Allah is all alone and hidden in his own veil and cannot be exemplified with anything. Nothing exists here, neither the universe nor the creation. Here the Zaat (Divine essence) and neither His attributes are revealed or manifested. * Alam-i-Yahoot (Realm of First Manifestation): The spiritual stage pertaining to YaHoot is referred to as Wahdat (Oneness). YaHoot is the first level of manifestation of \\"Hoo\\". When the Divine Essence desired to manifest, He manifested Himself in the form of Noor-e-Mohammad (Light of Muhammad). Since YaHoot is a world of Oneness, so it clarifies that Noor of Mohammad is a manifestation of God‚Äôs Essence and is not a separate entity. This is the first step towards Divine descent. The creation has not started yet. Here Hoo is called Allah which in Arabic means \\"the worshippable one\\", because there is a being in the form of Noor of Mohammad who worships Allah. And the level is called yaHoot because there is an entity who would address Hoo as YaHoo (O‚ÄôHoo). * Alam-i-LaHoot (Realm of Absolute Unity): The world of LaHoot is related to the level of Wahdiyat (Unity). Here the soul of Mohammad is manifested from the Noor of Mohammad. Since this is a world of Unity so at this level Noor of Allah and Noor of Mohammad are in the same form. Therefore, the soul of Mohammad is in fact the soul of Allah called Rooh-e-Qudsi (The Divine Soul). At this level the whole universe and its creation is hidden in Noor-e-Mohammad and is anxious to manifest itself. The above three levels are the levels of Unity and non-creation. The presence of Hoo in HaHoot, YaHoot and LaHoot indicates Absolute Unity. The creation takes place in the coming levels of Jabrut, Malakut and Nasut. * Alam-i-Jabrut (Realm of Power): Jabrut is an Arabic term which means 'bridge' or anything that connects two things. It is called Jabrut because it connects the above three levels of non-creation and the coming levels of creation. The level of Jabrut is related to the level of creation of souls of human beings. Here Allah created the souls of human beings from Rooh-e-Qudsi. The soul of human beings created from Rooh-e-Qudsi is called Rooh-e-Sultani (the Kingly soul). The Divine attributes like knowledge, wisdom etc. which were present in totality in Rooh-e-Qudsi at the above non-creation levels got divided into human beings. Rooh-e-Sultani has attributes of angels because angels were created at the same level. Here Rooh-e-Qudsi got concealed in the Rooh-e- Sultani. * Alam-e-Malakut (Realm of Intelligence): This level refers to the world of symbolic forms. At this level the souls took a recognizable but immaterial and intangible form for the first time. Here Rooh-e-sultani got concealed in the cover of Rooh-Noorani (the soul of celestial light). The souls of animals, plants and all non-living things were also created at this level. Due to the creation of souls of animals at this level the human soul adopted beastal qualities like lust,greed, covet etc. * Alam-i-Nasut (Realm of Physical bodies): The level of Nasut refers to the physical world of material bodies. The stage where foundations of the tangible world of matter are laid. Here Rooh-e-Noorani got concealed in the cover of Rooh-e-Hewani (the soul directly related to the physical body) which was the breathed into the physical bodies of flesh and bones and non-living things. The process of human creation got completed here and Allah manifested Himself completely in Humans by concealing in the covers of Rooh-e-Qudsi, Rooh-e-Sultani, Rooh-e-Noorani and Rooh-e-Hewani.

Sacks wrote of the inspiration he took from Picker's music in the preface to his book, Island of the Color Blind, saying he \\"owe[d] a special debt to Tobias Picker's version of The Encantadas, and that \\"whenever, in the writing, memory failed me, listening to the piece operated as a sort of Proustian mnemonic, transporting me back to the Marianas and the Carolines\\".Oliver Sacks, The Island of the Colorblind, Illustrated Edition, (New York: Vintage, 1998), p. xxi.

A return performance at SXSW 2004 followed, during which the band was courted by former Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra, and subsequently signed on with his Alternative Tentacles imprint, who released 2005's Brokers Banquet. Recorded at Bubble Studios by Chris 'Frenchie' Smith (ex-Sixteen Deluxe, Young Heart Attack), and mixed by Mark Hutchins, Brokers Banquet, which parodied the Rolling Stones' Beggars Banquet cover art, featured a more hard-edged 'rock' influence, combined with the tongue-in-cheek lyrics and punk-fueled aggression of the first album. Along with the more aggressive sound came a transition from a four-piece to a five- piece line-up, with bassist Preston Hetherington switching over to second guitar, and the band recruiting Ricky the Intern from the 'Zero Skills Employment Agency' (according to their bio) on bass. With last-minute addition Trey Robles (ex-Hard Feelings) on drums, the band toured the East Coast in Spring of 2005, hitting renowned punk-rock enclave CBGB in New York City, as well as recording a live broadcast for XM Satellite Radio at the invitation of Lou Brutus of the station's Fungus 53 channel.

Directed by Mike Vardy, the serial, based on Michael Dobbs's 1995 novel of the same name, was adapted for television by Andrew Davies. It details the conclusion of Francis Urquhart's reign as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Plot The serial opens with Prime Minister Francis Urquhart shooting his gun dog, now too old to perform her duties ‚Äì a scene which establishes the theme of the ending of a career. Shortly afterwards, Urquhart attends the fictional state funeral of Margaret Thatcher.Margaret Thatcher's death, in the real world, did not happen until 2013, about 18 years after the series aired. He publicly praises Thatcher as his mentor, but privately begrudges her record as the longest-serving prime minister in recent history,The serial refers to Thatcher as Britain's longest-serving Prime Minister, when she was actually the seventh-longest serving. The novel does not contain this mistake, as it accurately refers to Thatcher as the longest- serving post-war Prime Minister. a record that Urquhart himself is soon to surpass. To \\"leave my mark on the world\\", Urquhart champions a treaty resolving the Cyprus dispute while secretly working to bring offshore oil deposits under the control of the Turkish authorities on the island so that a Turkish-British consortium will have the drilling rights; an executive of the consortium has promised to provide for Urquhart's retirement fund in return. Urquhart also has a personal connection to Cyprus: as a nineteen-year-old British Army lieutenant serving there in 1956, he killed two young EOKA guerrillas while trying to get information from them. Urquhart has frequent nightmares and flashbacks of this event, and also of the murders of Mattie Storin and others, shown in the previous series. On a motorway near London, Urquhart's car is rammed by another car containing three drunken louts. The attackers are unlawfully killed by his security staff. Urquhart sustains minor head injuries in the collision, but his life is not endangered. When Elizabeth arrives at hospital, he is delirious and confuses the incident on the motorway with the incident in Cyprus. Tom Makepeace, Urquhart's Foreign Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, chairs a cabinet meeting while Urquhart is in hospital; Urquhart considers Makepeace ‚Äì the actual negotiator of the Cyprus treaty ‚Äì as a potential challenger, although he does not take the threat very seriously, considering him \\"not a fighter\\" but \\"a sentimental dreamer\\". The brother of the murdered Greek Cypriot guerrillas, who witnessed their deaths, lives in London and recognises Urquhart as the soldier who killed them. He asks his daughter Maria to investigate while secretly considering taking vengeance on Urquhart. Maria's search of government records finds a report on the incident written by Urquhart, but his name is redacted. Upon being approached by Maria, Urquhart arranges for documents revealing his involvement to be excluded from a coincidental declassification of British records relating to Cyprus. But he also confides the truth to Elizabeth. Meanwhile, Urquhart appoints ambitious backbencher Claire Carlsen as his Parliamentary Private Secretary. Claire also happens to be Makepeace's lover. She subsequently plays the two men against each other. Encouraged by Claire, Urquhart enrages Makepeace by making a speech in the House of Commons suggesting that Britain should not adopt the European currency, but that Europe should instead adopt English as its official language. When Urquhart seeks to appoint Makepeace to the Department of Education in a cabinet reshuffle, Makepeace resigns from the government, crosses the floor, and emerges as the prime minister's main adversary in Parliament. He also challenges Urquhart for the leadership of the Conservative Party and forces him into a second ballot. Meanwhile, Claire advises Maria to take her case to Makepeace, who repeatedly raises the cover-up in parliament. At Makepeace's suggestion, Claire purloins the unedited report on the Cyprus killings from the secret government archive where it is stored. However, Urquhart's bodyguard, Corder ‚Äì informed by the archive clerk ‚Äì seizes the document from her. Makepeace's leadership challenge has attracted enough support to convince Urquhart that his position is in jeopardy. He decides to leak information regarding the oil deposits in order to stir up a conflict in Cyprus as \\"our Falklands\\" to unite Britain under his leadership. When Greek nationalists kidnap a British diplomat and the Greek Cypriot President, Urquhart deploys British troops to retrieve them. Though the troops successfully rescue the hostages, the intervention later results in the death of civilians, including young schoolgirls, largely because of the prime minister's drastic orders. Urquhart's support plummets, and when he proves unwilling to accept responsibility for the deaths or express sympathy for the victims, many MPs openly call on him to resign. While Urquhart appears defiant, his wife is worried, and she consults Corder for advice on how to save him. Corder advises \\"drastic measures\\", and informs her that he has sent a copy of Mattie Storin's tape, revealing Urquhart's role in her death, to Makepeace. Makepeace confronts the prime minister and announces that he will publish the tape, but not before Urquhart has achieved his aim of surpassing Margaret Thatcher's record. After this, Urquhart again meets Maria. The incriminating Cyprus report has been sent to Maria's father anonymously ‚Äì presumably by Corder ‚Äì and Maria vows to publish it. After this, Urquhart despairs, but Elizabeth consoles him: \\"We can be safe still!\\" and hints at a ploy by Corder. At the unveiling of the Margaret Thatcher memorial, on the day when Urquhart surpasses her record, a sniper in Corder's services appears on a rooftop and shoots the prime minister (and Maria's father, who had approached Urquhart with a pistol). Elizabeth had arranged for his assassination as the only way to preserve his reputation (and the retirement fund). Urquhart dies in her arms, while Corder offers his services to Makepeace, the apparent successor.

It also led to Michael Dobbs demanding that his name be removed from the credits. * The episode length was reduced from 1 hour to 50 minutes. Novel differences In the novel, but not in the television series: * Urquhart does not kill Georgios and Euripides Pasolides in a lone operation but, as an officer, is responsible for their deaths. * Urquhart successfully thwarts the attempt to build a statue in honour of Margaret Thatcher. (Its erection is a theme‚Äîof political mortality‚Äîrunning through the television series.) * Makepeace does not openly challenge Urquhart for the leadership of their party but leads a popular movement against the Prime Minister. * Urquhart faces losing a general election and he is urged to resign by his Cabinet Ministers to keep his undefeated record. * Mattie Storin's murder is not mentioned and the information is not revealed to Makepeace. * Urquhart is not suspected as the murderer of Georgios and Euripides Pasolides until all is revealed at the end. * Urquhart is not assassinated on Corder's orders, but allows the brother of the men he killed in Cyprus to shoot him, making himself a martyr in the process. * Makepeace does not succeed Urquhart but is tarred by association with Urquhart's assassin as planned. * It is unclear whether Urquhart beats Margaret Thatcher's record in office as the longest-serving post-war prime minister.

Directed by Paul Seed, the serial was based on the Michael Dobbs' 1993 novel of the same name and adapted for television by Andrew Davies. The opening and closing theme music for the TV series is entitled \\"Francis Urquhart's March\\", by composer Jim Parker. The series details the conflict between British Prime Minister Francis Urquhart and a newly crowned king as well as the run-up to the general election. The book and TV serialisation follow on from the TV version of the first part of the trilogy. To Play the King (and the final part The Final Cut) reflect upon the end of the first series, which differed somewhat from the plot of the original novel. Plot The newly crowned King (Michael Kitchen) is displeased with the Conservative government led by Prime Minister Francis Urquhart (Ian Richardson) and becomes involved in politics in a way that Urquhart finds unacceptable for a constitutional monarch. At their first meeting, the King expresses concern about Urquhart's social policies, which he argues have led to greater problems for urban areas. Tensions escalate when Urquhart moves his leftist Environment Secretary to a job in Strasbourg after rejecting his proposals to regenerate inner cities. The King's Assistant Press Secretary, Chloe Carmichael, leaks the outcome of the meeting to the press, which rankles Urquhart. Fearing the King will weaken his position, Urquhart obtains \\"regal insurance\\" from Princess Charlotte, the former wife of a royal family member. Urquhart's underling, party chairman Tim Stamper, persuades her to divulge lurid details about the Monarchy to Sir Bruce Bullerby, the editor of the Daily Clarion tabloid, on condition the information is published after her death. Urquhart also begins regularly meeting with the King's ex-wife, repeatedly assuring her that he has no intention of disturbing the Monarchy, implying he would support the early accession of her teenaged son as King. The King and his staff produce a public service announcement implicitly denouncing how Urquhart's policies have affected Britain and covertly rally Opposition leaders to join forces against the Prime Minister. Irked by this intransigence, Urquhart calls an early election. His wife, Elizabeth, introduces him to a pollster named Sarah Harding and persuades him to choose her as a political advisor. Urquhart is impressed with Harding's intelligence and starts to favour her over Stamper, who becomes increasingly bitter over his reluctance to promote him to a senior position. Urquhart eventually begins an affair with Harding, which puts a strain on her marriage. Through all this, he continues to be haunted by his murder of Mattie Storin; unbeknownst to him, someone possesses Mattie's tape recording of her own death. Corder, Urquhart's bodyguard and security advisor, puts the King and other enemies under surveillance. After a brief abduction by some homeless thugs, Harding is told to \\"ask 'im about Mattie Storin\\". Despite her feelings for Urquhart, Harding begins to question his version of events about the tragedy. She meets John Krajewski, a former colleague of Mattie's who is now a paranoid freelance journalist. Corder and his staff execute Krajewski and blame it on Irish republican terrorists. Meanwhile, Urquhart threatens the King with Charlotte's memoirs, saying that he will be forced to publish them if the King continues publicly to oppose him. The King, however, refuses to be blackmailed. Urquhart engages in secret meetings with the King's ex-wife, who urges him not to back down. He also blackmails Bullerby into publishing Charlotte's memoirs in the Daily Clarion, threatening to release images of his sexual relationship with the princess. While the royal scandal succeeds in hurting the King's popularity, the polls reverse when Conservative MP John Staines is arrested for sex with a minor. A furious Urquhart blames Stamper for the fallout, having put Staines in the public arena moments before his arrest. Mycroft, the King's closeted advisor, begins fearing his sexual orientation may damage the King's standing, having seen Staines in a gay bar with an underage boy before the arrest. Mycroft eventually decides to come out to the King's press corps, at the same time announcing his resignation. The deadly explosion of a tower block, as a result of a tenant's tapping into the gas main, puts the King's arguments about social problems back into the public domain. Urquhart announces his intention of having unemployed youth from the estates conscripted into the Armed Forces, re-enacting a form of peacetime national service. The King organises a bus tour visiting disadvantaged council estates to show his concern, refusing to include a security detail. Urquhart arranges for Corder to have the King abducted by thugs during his tour of an estate in Manchester. The Parachute Regiment, secretly shadowing the King's tour on Urquhart's orders, rescues him from possible harm. The King is seen as foolish for his negligence in the matter of security, and Urquhart seems like a hero for having protected him. Meanwhile, Corder discovers that Stamper has passed information on Mattie's murder to Harding as insurance. With urging from Elizabeth, Urquhart orders Corder to assassinate them. The Conservatives subsequently win the general election with a 22-seat overall majority. With his policies vindicated by the electorate, despite the King's public opposition, Urquhart demands his abdication. Harding's car explodes when she is en route to meet Chloe, while Stamper's car explodes outside New Scotland Yard. The media interpret the car bombings as Provisional IRA attacks. The end credits of the final episode roll with images of the crowning of the new teenaged king, showing that Urquhart had succeeded in obtaining the abdication of the previous king. At the end of the credits, Urquhart smirks at the camera and triumphantly says, \\"God Save the King\\", ending the series. Breaking the fourth wall As in House of Cards, Urquhart occasionally speaks directly to the audience. He takes the viewer into his confidence, and at the end of the series, as at the end of the first, he challenges the viewer to condemn him. Novel differences In the novel, but not in the television series: * The storyline follows on directly from those of House of Cards, in that Urquhart has just taken over as Leader of the Conservative Party. (In the television series Urquhart is well-established as prime minister.) * Tim Stamper takes over as Party Chairman at the beginning of the novel rather than as the plot unfolds as it is Urquhart's plan to call a snap election to increase his party's parliamentary majority. * After Urquhart stops his business interests expanding, Ben Landless becomes an opponent of Urquhart and an ally of the king. (Landless does not appear in the television series.) * Chloe Carmichael was created for the television adaptation. * Sarah Harding does not appear. Her character is represented by Sally Quinn, an American who also feeds information about Urquhart to Ben Landless. * Tim Stamper does not betray Urquhart and therefore is not murdered. * Mattie Storin's and Roger O'Neill's murders are not directly mentioned nor used as a plot device. * It is implied that Urquhart is responsible for his and his wife's childlessness. Indeed, their relationship is less close than in the television series. When Landless threatens to expose Elizabeth's affair, Francis implies that he will divorce her to gain sympathy and to cling to power. * The King willingly abdicates ahead of the general election, indicating that he will stand against Urquhart. In fact, he insists on his abdication being handled before Urquhart can call the election. Rather than feeling confident that the King has been politically neutered, Urquhart is left feeling that the ground is slipping beneath him. In 2013, the novel was reissued along with the rest of the trilogy, to coincide with the launch of the American version of House of Cards, with Dobbs having rewritten portions of the novel in order to restore continuity between the three novels and to bring it more in line with the mini-series. Changes made include: *The beginning and ending of the novel now reflect the mini-series, though with some changes. Urquhart has been prime minister for nearly two years while the King has only just assumed the throne following the death of the Queen at the start of the revised novel. He only decides to go after the King at the persuasion of his wife, who notices that Urquhart had grown bored with power and needed a new enemy to thwart. *The ending has the King being forced to abdicate, following Urquhart's electoral success, after Urquhart informs him that he plans on using all of the resources at his disposal to destroy the Royal Family if he does not abdicate the throne. *Furthermore, there is an additional scene with the King's teenage son and Urquhart, after his father's abdication, where the newly crowned King informs Urquhart that \\"nothing lasts forever\\", in relations to Urquhart's own power and position as prime minister. This leads to the final chapter of the revised novel, where Urquhart ponders his legacy and whether or not he would be remembered as a bully who forced the King of England to abdicate. *Corder and Tim Stamper are given additional page time, with their past with Urquhart revealed. *Corder's characteristics are changed to make him more in line with Edward Meechum, his counterpart character in the US adaptation of the show. In particular, it is stated that his loyalty to Urquhart is due to Urquhart vouching for him after an unstated incident early on in his tenure with the Urquharts, where the Chief Whip saved his job. Similarly, Stamper's betrayal and death from the TV series is not imported into the revised novel. * Mattie Storin's death is mentioned by several minor journalist characters, with it implied that many feel Urquhart did indeed kill her but that due to his power and reach, no one dare publicly accuse him.

The five types of Anchor Beer available in Hainan Island, China =Anchor Beer (Hainan, China)= Asia Pacific Breweries opened the first mass production brewery on Hainan Island in the capital city of Haikou in 1997. The new brewery produced Tiger Beer and the now discontinued budget ‚ÄòAoke‚Äô but mainly focused on Anchor Beer. For almost a decade Anchor Beer was the dominant beer on Hainan Island. From 2007 realizing the potential revenues from the booming tourist industry in Hainan, the Tsingtao Beer Company made successful efforts to reduce Anchor‚Äôs monopoly and as of 2014 outside of the capital Haikou, most small shops stock primarily Tsingtao. As of 2014 there are several unique Anchor Beer types available only in Hainan. These include: Anchor Red Crown 4.4% (similar in taste and branding to Anchor Smooth), Anchor Lite 4.0%, Anchor ‚ÄòClassic‚Äô 4.0%, Anchor Ice 4.0% and Anchor 97 4.0%. In addition to the Anchor Beer family the brewery in Haikou also produces Heineken and two versions of ‚ÄòHainan Beer‚Äô. One a 3.2% budget version and the other a 4.0% ‚Äòpremium‚Äô version with a bright blue logo tailored for tourists and the growing number of international resorts. In late 2015 the company launched 'Anchor Radler' in Hainan Island. A light 1.8% beer mixed with lemon. Sold in 300ml bottles the target market appears to be trendy clubs and afternoon drinkers. The logo is exactly the same as the Radler logo used on Bintang Radler, which also comes in 300ml bottles only. 8 of the 10 beers brewed by APB in Hainan.

Founded by longtime Hainan expatriate James Farquhar, the first APB challenge took place following a 'Hash House Harrier' event in Sanya on June 22, 2009. APB Hainan produces 5 types of Anchor Beer, 2 types of Tiger Beer (regular Tiger and Tiger Crystal), 2 types of Hainan Beer and Heineken, totaling 10 different beers. Only two are available in cans (Anchor Red Crown and Anchor Lite), only some in 330 ml bottles but all in 600 or 550 ml \\"big\\" bottles. The APB challenge is to find and drink all 10 types of the big-bottle versions in one day. From 2012 the challenge has become increasingly difficult as some product lines (Anchor 97 and Anchor ‚ÄòClassic‚Äô) are only available in rural villages outside of the main population centers of Haikou and Sanya. Distribution * APB has breweries in Singapore, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, China, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Sri Lanka, Laos and Mongolia. The company has a strong market share in several countries within the Asia Pacific Region, primarily in Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. In China, official announcement has been made to build a new brewery in a city named Jia Shan, in Zhejiang province, less than an hour drive from the Shanghai city. Estimated operation date will be end of 2015. This is to cope with the high double digit sales volume growth every year for Heineken beer in China. * In Malaysia, Tiger Beer is produced and marketed by Guinness Anchor Berhad (GAB). * In the UK, Tiger Beer can be found in more than 8,000 premium bars/clubs and distribution outlets in its major cities.

The second part is a series of prayers in which the pharaoh assumes parts of nature and deities, but mostly of the sun god. Developed in the Eighteenth Dynasty, it also praises the king for his union with the sun god, as well as other deities.

It is located in Downtown Toronto at the intersection of Yonge Street and Bloor Street at the east end of the Mink Mile. Brookfield Properties owns and operates the centre. The centre is composed of a 35-storey office tower, a Hudson's Bay department store and a retail concourse. Description The tower stands at 135 metres in height. It contains 35 floors and , and its address 2 Bloor Street East, at the northeast corner of the intersection of Yonge and Bloor Streets. The extensive retail concourse is anchored by a flagship store of Hudson's Bay/The Bay (known as the \\"Toronto, on Bloor Street\\" store at 44 Bloor Street East), the main brand of HBC. The mall contains over 45 specialty shops, boutiques, services and eateries. The complex also includes the Marriott Hotel, an RBC Royal Bank branch, apartments, and condominiums. The centre has space for 1,200 cars in its underground and above-ground parking lots, multiple entrances located on Yonge, Bloor Streets, Park Road and Asquith Avenue and is surrounded by several parks and the Yorkville neighborhood which is known for upscale shopping. The building is connected to the Bloor-Yonge subway station, the TTC's major east-west/north-south transfer point. There are also below-grade connections to the Holt Renfrew Centre and Cumberland Terrace, which continues westward to 60 Bloor Street West and Manulife Centre. The pedestrian tunnels stretches along Bloor Street West to the Bay subway station, making this Toronto's largest underground network after PATH. History Completed in 1974, the International style office skyscraper has served as the headquarters for the retailer Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), and to this day it is still the main tenant although the company relocated its head office to the Simpson Tower in 1978. In 2013, it was announced that the 342,000 square foot Hudson's Bay/The Bay store could undergo a $100 million renovation to become the Canadian flagship location of Saks Fifth Avenue, the American luxury department store chain which is now also owned by Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). However, it was subsequently announced that HBC would instead be renovating its flagship Hudson's Bay store at Yonge and Queen to include a 150,000 square foot Saks Fifth Avenue, and would leave the Yonge and Bloor location as a Hudson's Bay store. In August 2014, the centre became the subject of controversy when its property manager, Brookfield Properties Ltd, admitted to regularly confiscating bicycles that were locked to a pole on a municipal right of way on Bloor St. outside of the mall. Many Torontonians are accusing the centre of theft and the City of Toronto has assigned by-law officers to investigate.

He had a unique illustration style based upon his early recreation of wood engraving illustrations with pen and ink. His skill as a draftsman and style made him a popular magazine illustrator in the early 20th-century. He was one of the first modern ex libris designers in the United States. Using watercolor, Booth created book illustrations, such as James Whitcomb Riley's The Flying Islands of the Night. During World War I, he created posters for recruitment, fundraising, and other efforts. As Art Deco style illustrations became popular, his work in latter years was found in commercial publications and catalogs. Although he \\"believe[d] in schools to a certain extent\\" at one point in his career, he co- founded the Phoenix Art Institute and was an educator for 21 years. He was inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame. Early life and education Jay Franklin Booth was born in 1874 and raised on a farm near Carmel, Indiana. His parents, Susan Wright and John Thomas Booth, had eight children. Booth, the third child, attended the Quaker Academy at Westfield. Franklin Booth, illustration for McClure's Magazine by 1914 As a boy, he was determined to become an artist. He studied pictures in books and magazines, including Scribner's and Harper's. His unusual technique was the result of his having scrupulously copied magazine illustrations which he thought were pen- and-ink drawings, but were, in fact, wood engravings. As a result, this led him to developing a style of drawing composed of thousands of lines, whose careful positioning next to one another produced variations in density and shade. The characteristics of his art were his scale extremes with large buildings and forests looming over tiny figures, decorative scrolls and borders, classic hand lettering and gnarled trees. He expressed his view of formal education, \\"I believe in schools to a certain extent, yet I think a knowledge of art is not a thing held in trust by any, but is, rather, universal and comes to them who hunger and thirst after it.\\" He took a correspondence course in art while he lived in Indiana, and studied for three months each at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Art Students League of New York. Career Franklin Booth, Nicholson Bookplate, by 1910 His skilled draftsmanship and unique style made him a popular illustrator. He was considered \\"the best pen-and-ink man in America\\" by an editor of a leading magazine. Despite the laboriousness of his technique, Booth's compositions were characterised by a grand sense of space. As a result, his drawings were often well-matched to poetic or editorial entries. With the advent of the \\"clean, smooth, and continuous lines\\" of the Art Deco style illustrations, his works in latter years were found in commercial publications and catalogs. Booth's first illustrations, created for his verses, appeared in the Indianapolis News, and he was on the staff there from 1899 to 1904. He then traveled to Rome, Paris and Spain. Beginning in 1904 or 1905, he worked on the New York Daily News. He also worked briefly at newspapers in Boston and Washington as an illustrator. Creator of the Nicholson plate, engraved in copper, he was one of the first modern ex libris designers in the United States. He created a gift bookplate for the Indiana State Library. Franklin Booth, illustration for Harper's Magazine, 1912 Booth's illustrations appeared in popular magazines, like Scribner's, Good Housekeeping, Collier's, Harper's Magazine, and The Saturday Evening Post. He illustrated James Oppenheim's short stories for American magazine by 1914. Booth created advertising art for organizations, such as Rolls-Royce, Whitman's Candy, Bulova Watches, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, Paramount Pictures, and Estey Organ. He also created illustrations for several Victor-Victrola record covers. Franklin Booth, Liberty Bonds poster, World War I, 1914-1918 Booth contributed to World War I by illustrating recruitment posters, US savings bonds envelopes, booklets and death certificates for American soldiers who perished in France and Belgium, and work for the Red Cross. Franklin Booth, illustration for Flying Islands by James Whitcomb Riley, 1913 He illustrated books like James Whitcomb Riley's The Flying Islands of the Night (1913), which included multiple plates of his watercolor images. \\"It includes Booth's open compositions and attention to classical forms, with skies filled with soft quiet washes of hues in place of fields of tone.\\" The book, A Hoosier Holiday (1916), chronicled the two-week automobile trip that Booth took with Theodore Dreiser from New York to Terre Haute, Indiana, Riley's hometown. It included 30 or 32 charcoal sketches of cities, small towns, and rural settings that Booth made along their voyage in Booth's Pathfinder touring car. It was the first book about travel via automobile. He illustrated Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper (1917); Meredith Nicholson's The Poet, and Five-Foot Book Shelf, one of the Harvard Classics editions. In 1925, he co-founded the Phoenix Art Institute and was an educator there for 21 years. An edition of his work, \\"Sixty Reproductions from Original Drawings\\", was published in 1925 by Robert Frank. In 1934 and 1935, he wrote a series of articles about the art of illustration for the Professional Art Quarterly. Franklin Booth, A Continent Is Bridged, an illustration for the 25th anniversary of transcontinental telephone service. Other contributions include illustrating the annual Telephone Almanac by 1940. \\"A Continent Is Bridged\\", an illustration by Franklin Booth, was drawn for the Atlantic Telephone & Telegraph Company for the observance of the twenty-fifth anniversary of transcontinental telephone service in 1940. He created illustrations‚Äîlike of a black-eyed susan and box turtle‚Äîfor several stamps for a 1941 wildlife conservation series by the National Wildlife Federation.

The village is located to the east of the A44 which started as a Saltway linking Droitwich to Oxford. To the south is Pershore and five miles east is Worcester. The parish is bound to the east by the Bow Brook. The parish, according to the 2011 census, has 87 households with 220 residents. The village has existed since Roman times with the parish boundaries being formed during the Anglo-Saxon period and have remain until today. The Domesday Book mentions local land owners notably the Bishop of Worcester who granted Aston Manor to the Cistercian Nuns in 1255. The nuns were referred to as the \\"White Ladies\\" which combined with the word ‚ÄúAston‚Äù, derived from the Anglo-Saxon term for ‚ÄúEast Farm‚Äù, forming the name of ‚ÄúWhite Ladies Aston\\". The parish Church of England church is dedicated to St John the Baptist.  History  = Pre Roman and Roman Times = The A44 (Evesham Road) and Edward's Lane are ancient saltways dating back to the Iron Age. These saltways linked Droitwich to Oxford after branching from the saltway from Droitwhich to Worcester at Martin Hussingtree. The A44 (Evesham Road) saltway to the west and Edward's Lane to the north formed parts of the parish boundaries. = Anglo-Saxon = During the Saxon times the village was referred to as ‚ÄúEastun‚Äù, ‚ÄúEstun‚Äù and ‚ÄúAston‚Äù as the term for ‚ÄúEast Farm‚Äù in relation to the Cathedral of Worcester. Located in the parish was a mound named after Oslaf, a Bernician prince fighting King Penda. This mound became the meeting place for the Oswaldslow Hundred Court after its creation in 964 A.D. and was renamed after Oswald.Mason St Wulfstan of Worcester p. 4 Now known as Low Hill. The boundaries of the parish date back to Saxon times. The eastern boundary is the Bow Brook, formalised in 974 AD by King Edgar granting land to the east of the Bow Brook to Pershore Abbey establishing a permanent boundary with the parish of Peopleton. In 976 the western boundary was changed as the result of the ruling of the Hundred Court where by a local farmer was accused of illegally farming land to the western side of the saltway. The ruling was in his favor, as a result the parish was expanded to include the area of Snaetch's Hill to the west of the saltway. Today known as Sneachill. As the result of a land dispute between Bredicot and Churchill the Bredicot boundary charter of 983 A.D. defined the northern boundary between Bredicot and Aston Episcopi as, ‚Äúalong the dyke to the salt way‚Äù. The boundary of the parish of White Ladies Aston In 984 the south west and southern boundary of the parish was defined by Bishop Oswald as: > \\"'From Snaet's [Snaetch's] Spring above the Marsh along the Rommes Valley to > the Salt Street (Saltway), thence southward past Oswald's Low to the > Salters' Well (Egdon) and along the dyke to the Saw Brook and along this > brook to the Bow Brook and along the Bow Brook to the Wood Ford at > Beornwynn's Valley. = Norman =  Domesday Book entries - 1086  Worcestershire was divided between major landowners with the Church of St. Mary's, Worcester, holding all the land in Oswaldslow and all the ancient dues and rights of the church confirmed at this time Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester, was the Tenant- in-chief. In the Domesday Survey, in 1086, the settlement of Aston was recorded under two tenants. The northern section, called Aston Episcopi, formed part of the Manor of Northwick. The Domesday Book entry for the Manor of Aston Episcopi states > Ordric holds 3 hides and 1 virgate of this manor at (White Ladies) Estun. He > has 3 ploughs; 5 villagers and 4 smallholders with 4 ploughs. The value was > 20s; now 40s. The southern section, called Nether Aston, formed part of the Manor of Warndon which was held by Urse D'Abitot who leased it to Robert de Bracy. The Domesday Book entry for the Manor of Nether Aston states > Urso also holds 1 hide and 3 virgates at Warndon and (White Ladies) Estun, > and Robert from him. He has 2 ploughs, with 2 slaves. Meadow, 16 acres; > woodland 2 furlongs long and as wide: it is in the Forest. The value is and > was 16s  Founding of the Church  In 1204 Robert de Everay made a gift of two palfreys to the Bishop of Worcester. This action won Robert the right to present a candidate for the office of vicar to the parish of Aston Episcopi and it was understood he intended to build a stone church this resulted in the St John the Baptist church which is still present to this day.  The Forest Law of 1217  For people who broke Forest Laws the punishment were severe. Under the 1217 Charter of King Henry III the Forest Laws were removed from Aston parish. The village is located in the north of the Horewell Forest. As a result of this Charter villagers could hunt and gather wood with impunity. This change came about because of the deforestation of the area around Aston caused by a greater need for farm land. Over this time the area changed dramatically in appearance, unlike the neighboring village of Churchill which lay within the Forest of Feckenham and as a result the villagers of Churchill where still subject to the old laws. = The Manor of Aston Episcopi from the 12th Century to 17th Century = In 1120 part of Aston Episcopi manor was given by Bishop Theulf to Robert de Evercy. A descendant of the same name obtained a recognition of his right to build a stone church at Aston in 1204. Walter de Cantilupe, Bishop of Worcester, in 1242 acquired additional land for Aston Episcopi from the Manor of Aston Bruley owned by the de Bruley family. In 1255 part of the revenue from Aston Episcopi was granted to the eight Cistercian Nuns running the newly formed Whistones Priory in Barbourne, Worcester. The nuns were of the Cistercian Order and wore white habits so creating the village name, White Ladies Aston. During the Reformation of Henry VIII Whistones Nunnery was dissolved in October 1536. The dissolution of the nunnery might have caused another change in the name of the manor but the name White Ladies Aston remained. This manor was granted on 14 July 1544 to Richard Andrews and John Howe, and on 30 July they sold it to Thomas Hill. A descendant of Thomas Hill, Francis Hill died in 1611 leaving a daughter Alice, wife of Richard Andrews, who sold the manor, in 1612, to Robert Berkeley of Spetchley and the lands continue under Berkeley ownership today. The rest of the Manor of Aston Episcopi was retained by the bishop and remained in the possession of the see of Worcester until 1648. It was then sold by the Parliamentary trustees to Thomas Rawlins, Edmund Giles and Christopher Giles but was restored to the see at the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 and remained in the hands of successive bishops until the death of Henry Pepys when it is transferred to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. = The Manor of Aston Bruley from the 12th Century to 17th Century = Robert de Bruley is recorded as holding the land of Nether Aston in 1185 and it being referred to as Aston Bruley. In the 13th century the marriage of William de Bruley to Beatrice Beauchamp of Warwickshire. The lands in the area continued in the Bruley Family until the middle of the 15th century, when by marriage it became the property of the Danvers Family, then to the Hubaud or Hubold Family. In 1558 the manor was sold to William Solley. The Solley family was still in possession of the manor in 1610 at the point when the Manor of Aston Bruley ceased to exist. By the time of the English Civil Wars (1642 ‚Äì 1651) the property was in the possession of the Symonds Family who were Roundheads and energetic supporters of Parliament during the English Civil War. = Aston Hall Farm during the English Civil War = Aston Hall Farm pre 1830s John Good and Charles Berkeley of Spetchley mustered at Aston Court to join Prince Rupert in the Royal Cavalry before advancing to support King Charles I at the Battle of Newbury in 1643. By the time of the English Civil Wars the former Manor of Aston Bruley contained a very fine black and white timbered house of Aston Hall Farm. Aston Hall Farm was where Oliver Cromwell, General of the Parliamentary Forces, spent the night of 30th August 1651 with his friend Mr. Justice Symonds in advance of the Battle of Worcester 3rd September 1651. At the other end of the village, at Aston Court, an archaeological dig has produced evidence that Parliamentary troops plundered the farm, in 1651 before the Battle of Worcester, when the Royalist Good family refused to provide the Parliamentary troops with billets. On the 31st he moved to Forward Headquarters at Mr. Justice Berkeley's estate at Spetchley. On 3rd September the Battle of Worcester began. Oliver Cromwell advanced from Nunnery Wood, attacked the city and routed the Royalist force. Charles II was forced to flee from the City of Worcester out of the back door of his lodgings at Rowland Berkeley House (now the King Charles House) and eventually the country, and remained in exile until he returned as King Charles II in 1660. = Aston Hall Farm in the 18th Century = In 1707 Thomas Symond, of Aston Hall Farm, and John Palmer were leaders of the desperate band of ruffians who terrorised their neighbours in White Ladies Aston, Upton Snodsbury and Libbery. The Berrow's Journal later described the incident > In the night of the 7th November, 1707, Mrs Palmer of Upton Snodsbury and > her maid servant were murdered, and the house burnt down by a gang of > desperate villains, at the head of whom was Mr. Palmer, her only son, and > Mr. Symonds, whose sister Palmer had married. They were captured, tried and executed at Red Hill in Worcester. The lands leased by Mr. Symonds and Mr. Palmer in White Ladies reverted to Worcester Cathedral and Bishop Lloyd set up a trust, to be known as Bishop Lloyd's Charity, to receive the revenues. These were devoted to the foundation of two Charity Schools, one for boys and one for girls on one site in Trinity Hall, Worcester. The house and some land was later purchased by Thomas Henry Bund who later sold all his land in the parish to Mr. Berkeley of Spetchley in around 1836. = The Village and the Agricultural Revolution = Prior to 1825 the area around White Ladies Aston operated as an open field system containing medieval ridge and furrow field patterns. In 1825 the Enclosure (Inclosure) Act was passed that legally enforced the enclosing of parcels of land into fields of rectangular shapes, surrounded by hedges or fences, these can still be seen in the countryside today. = The Coming of the Railway = On 24 June 1840, on the north western edge of White Ladies Aston, the newly built Spetchley station was located on the recently constructed Birmingham and Gloucester Railway. Spetchley served as the main station for Worcester and passengers alighting here were taken by horse and carriage into the city. Mr. I.K. Brunel opening the station said, \\"The arrival of this modern facility will increase the prosperity of the whole area‚Äù. In the 1851 census 5 villagers were recorded as working for the railway company. The station was closed to rail passengers on 1 October 1855 with the opening of a new railway line into Worcester, the station remained open as a goods yard finally closing in 1963 as a result of the Beeching Report. In contrast to the closures of railway stations in the 1960's, on Sunday 23rd February 2020, a new railway station was opened in the area at Stoulton, Worcestershire Parkway.

Primarily a drummer, he also plays keyboard and guitar on occasion. He was the drummer in Malfunkshun from 1980 to 1988, featuring Andrew Wood of Mother Love Bone on vocals and Kevin Wood on guitar. He had previously been in the band Maggot Brains, but joined Malfunkshun when their drummer, David Hunt, quit the band after the first show. Hagar has also performed in Satchel with Shawn Smith, and in Brad with Smith and Stone Gossard (from Pearl Jam and formerly Mother Love Bone). Early life Regan Hagar became involved with music in Commodore Junior High School on Bainbridge Island, Washington, where he played the snare drum. Hagar met future Malfunkshun band-mate Andrew Wood there, when Hagar was in grade eight and Wood was in grade seven. He got into punk and began playing a full drum kit in high school and played for Maggot Brains. When he was fourteen years old, he and Andrew Wood became friends. Hagar created his first album cover design at fifteen for World Full of Hate from The Fartz, a punk Seattle band whose line-up included Duff McKagan on drums prior to McKagan being in the LA glam rock band Guns n Roses. Also in high school, he designed T-shirts and posters for bands with Andrew Wood. He is a self-taught graphic artist. Musical career =Malfunkshun= Andrew Wood asked him to join Malfunkshun after seeing Hagar working at the Showbox Theatre. Hagar worked hanging flyers and taking tickets for Showbox Theatre in exchange for free tickets to go to shows. Malfunkshun's three members (Kevin Wood, Andrew Wood, and Hagar) all used stage names and wore white make-up, similar to the members of the band Kiss. Hagar chose the name Thundarr because of Thor the Norse thunder god, and how drums relate to thunder. Malfunkshun dissolved in 1988 to become Lords of the Wasteland, which featured Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament in their lineup, with Andrew Wood and Regan Hagar. Hagar was replaced by Greg Gilmore on drums as the band transitioned into Mother Love Bone. Hagar says that he was actually happy that Gilmore took his place in the band, because he had a lot of respect for Gilmore. In 2006 Regan Hagar recorded an album as From The North with Shawn Smith, Kevin Wood, and Cory Kane. This was a music project that used new music alongside lyrics left by Andrew Wood after his death. Regan left the band in 2011. =Brad= Regan Hagar is the original drummer for the band Brad, which has been active since 1992 and has released six albums. Hagar continues to drum for the band. Although Stone Gossard and Shawn Smith usually write the songs, Hagar has made contributions such as \\"Tea Bag\\", which was released on their 2012 album United We Stand. The song was written and recorded at an earlier date. Hagar was also a member of the Brad offshoot band, Satchel, which has since refolded back into Brad. =The Little Ships= Based in Seattle, US and Stratford-upon-Avon, England, Regan joined the transatlantic band in early 2015. Their debut album, Alone Together, is due for release in the summer of 2016. Other pursuits =Assistant tour manager= In 2009, Regan Hagar began working as assistant tour manager for Neil Young. Although he initially thought it would just be for the summer, he worked the whole tour while Neil Young was recording the album Fork in the Road. Hagar says that it was an inspiration to work with Young, and to watch him make the record while on tour. =Graphic designer= Hagar also works as a freelance graphic designer and has worked on many album's artwork. He took up graphic design to help support his family, since being a musician was not very profitable. Initially his career as a graphic designer was overlooked because people thought of him as a musician. He created the album art for Eddie Vedder's ukulele album \\"Ukulele Songs\\", which was released in 2011. Hagar became involved with Vedder's band Pearl Jam's art design after he designed Lance Mercer's book 5x1‚ÄîPearl Jam Through the Eye of Lance Mercer. Hagar says that he likes to listen to the music of the album for which he is creating the art, to make sure the connection between the songs and the artwork is intact. It is important to him, he says, since he spent a lot of time looking at album art while listening to the albums.

The direct image functor :f_*: \\\\operatorname{Sh}(X) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Sh}(Y) sends a sheaf F on X to its direct image presheaf, which is defined on open subsets U of Y by :f_*F(U) := F(f^{-1}(U)), which turns out to be a sheaf on Y, also called the pushforward sheaf. This assignment is functorial, i.e. a morphism of sheaves œÜ: F ‚Üí G on X gives rise to a morphism of sheaves f‚àó(œÜ): f‚àó(F) ‚Üí f‚àó(G) on Y. = Example = If Y is a point, then the direct image equals the global sections functor. Let f: X ‚Üí Y be a continuous map of topological spaces or a morphism of schemes. Then the exceptional inverse image is a functor f!: D(Y) ‚Üí D(X). = Variants = A similar definition applies to sheaves on topoi, such as √©tale sheaves. Instead of the above preimage f‚àí1(U) the fiber product of U and X over Y is used.  Higher direct images  The direct image functor is left exact, but usually not right exact. Hence one can consider the right derived functors of the direct image. They are called higher direct images and denoted Rq f‚àó. One can show that there is a similar expression as above for higher direct images: for a sheaf F on X, Rq f‚àó(F) is the sheaf associated to the presheaf :U \\\\mapsto H^q(f^{-1}(U), F).

The genus gives its name to its family, the Macraucheniidae or \\"robust litopterns\\". Like other litopterns, it is not closely related to any living mammal, being most closely related to the group containing horses, rhinos and tapirs (the Perissodactyla), from which litopterns diverged approximately 66 million years ago. The oldest fossils in the genus date to the late Miocene, around seven million years ago, and M. patachonica disappears from the fossil record during the late Pleistocene, around 20,000-10,000 years ago. M. patachonica is one of the last and best known member of the family and is known primarily from the Luj√°n Formation in Argentina, but is known from localities across southern South America. Another genus of macraucheniid Xenorhinotherium was present in northeast Brazil and Venezuela during the Late Pleistocene. The type specimen was discovered by Charles Darwin during the voyage of the Beagle. In life, Macrauchenia may have resembled a humpless camel, though the two taxa are not closely related. It fed on plants in a variety of environments across what is now South America. Among the species described, M. patachonica and M. ullomensis are considered valid; M. boliviensis is considered a nomen dubium; and M. antiqua (or M. antiquus) has been moved to the genus Promacrauchenia.  Taxonomy  218x218px Macrauchenia fossils were first collected on 9 February 1834 at Port St Julian in Patagonia (Argentina) by Charles Darwin, when HMS Beagle was surveying the port. As a non-expert he tentatively identified the leg bones and fragments of spine he found as \\"some large animal, I fancy a Mastodon\\". In 1837, soon after the Beagle's return, the anatomist Richard Owen identified the bones, including vertebrae from the back and neck, as from a gigantic creature resembling a llama or camel, which Owen named Macrauchenia patachonica. In naming it, Owen noted the original Greek terms (, large or long), and (, neck) as used by Illiger as the basis of Auchenia as a generic name for the llama, Vicugna and so on. The find was one of the discoveries leading to the inception of Darwin's theory. Since then, more Macrauchenia fossils have been found, mainly in Patagonia, but also in Bolivia, Chile and Venezuela. The related genus Cramauchenia was named by Florentino Ameghino as a deliberate anagram of Macrauchenia. = Evolution = Skull and neck vertebrae of M. patachonica Illustration of the skull of Macrauchenia It is likely that Macrauchenia evolved from earlier litopterns Theosodon or Promacrauchenia, or a similar species. Litopterna was one of the five (four in some classifications) ancient orders of endemic South American mammals collectively called Meridungulates. Their relationships with other mammal groups outside South America have been poorly understood, as their early evolutionary history would have been in Western Gondwana, and outside of South America this area is now Antarctica. When South America separated from Antarctica in the Eocene, meridungulate orders survived in South America in isolation. Most flourished in the Paleogene and then diminished. Formerly, North American paleontologists considered them inferior to Northern Hemisphere taxa and to have been outcompeted to extinction in the Great American Biotic Interchange after the establishment of the Central American land bridge. However, more recent evidence shows that three of the meridungulate orders declined long before, just as happened to early mammal groups elsewhere. Litopterns and notoungulates continued, evolving into a variety of more derived forms. While toxodontid notoungulates expanded into North America during the GABI, litopterns remained confined to South America. Macrauchenia was among the last surviving meridungulates, along with litopterns such as Neocaliphrium and the large notungulates Toxodon and Mixotoxodon. These last endemic South American hoofed animals died out at the end of the Lujanian (10,000-20,000 years ago).Alberto L. Cione, Eduardo P. Tonni, Leopoldo Soibelzon: The Broken Zig-Zag: Late Cenozoic large mammal and tortoise extinction in South America. In: Revista del Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales. 5, 1, 2003, , S. 1‚Äì19, online Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA extracted from an M. patachonica fossil from a cave in southern Chile indicates that Macrauchenia (and by inference, Litopterna) is the sister group to Perissodactyla, with an estimated divergence date of sixty-six million years ago. Analysis of collagen sequences obtained from Macrauchenia and Toxodon reached a similar conclusion and extended membership in the sister group clade to notoungulates.  Description  Size of M. patachonica compared to a human Restoration with a moose-like nose Macrauchenia had a somewhat camel-like body, with sturdy legs, a long neck and a relatively small head. Its feet, however, more closely resembled those of a modern rhinoceros, with one central toe and two side toes on each foot. It was a large animal, with a body length of around and a weight up to , about the size of a black rhinoceros.http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/16838?show=full (in Spanish) One striking characteristic of Macrauchenia is the openings for the nostrils on top of the head, above and between the eyes. Increasingly retracted nostrils are an evolutionary trend in later litopterns. Because mammals with trunks show the nostrils in a similar position, a popular hypothesis is that Macrauchenia had a trunk similar to a tapir or an inflated snout like that of the saiga antelope, perhaps to keep dust out of the nostrils. Classic images and toys familiar to many people show the animal with a short trunk. However, a recent study comparing the skulls of tapirs and various other herbivorous extant and extinct mammal species instead saw similarities with the skulls of moose, suggesting that Macrauchenia and other macraucheniids such as Huayqueriana did not possess trunks. The snout of Macrauchenia is completely enclosed by bone, and the animal has an elongated neck that allowed it to reach upward; no living mammal with a proboscis has these features. An alternative hypothesis is that these litopterns were high browsers on tough and thorny vegetation, and retracted nostrils allowed them to reach leaves without being impaled in the nose. Sauropod dinosaurs (reconstructed as high browsers on conifer needles and cycads) have similar snouts, and living giraffes and gerenuks, high browsers on thorny vegetation, have more retracted nostrils than related taxa with other feeding habits. One insight into Macrauchenia's habits is that its ankle joints and shin bones may indicate that it was adapted to have unusually good mobility, being able to rapidly change direction when it ran at high speed. Macrauchenia is known, like its relative Theosodon, to have had a full set of 44 teeth.  Paleobiology  A 1913 restoration by Robert Bruce Horsfall depicting M. patachonica with an elephantine trunk Macrauchenia was a herbivore, likely living on leaves from trees or grasses. Carbon isotope analysis of M. patachonica's tooth enamel, as well as analysis of its hypsodonty index (low in this case; i.e., it was brachydont), body size and relative muzzle width suggests that it was a mixed feeder, combining browsing on C3 foliage with grazing on C4 grasses. A dental microwear, occusal enamel, and carbon isotope analysis of Macrauchenia and Xenorhinotherium found that both were grazers on C3 grasses. The genus was widespread, found in environments that ranged from dry to humid, from southern Chile to northeastern Brazil and the coast of Venezuela. Fossils of M. ullomensis have been found in Bolivia at altitudes up to 4000 meters. Habits and diet may have varied depending on the environment, but in plant feeders an elongated neck is usually an adaptation to allow high browsing on trees and shrubs. As the genus was not confined to forest, it was probably able to exploit more marginal environments by mixing high browsing with low browsing and grazing. A site in northern Chile preserved the remains of five subadults associated together, which suggests Macrauchenia may have lived in small herds or family groups. Restoration of M. patachonica without a trunk When Macrauchenia first arose, it could have been preyed upon by the largest of native South American mammal predators, the sabertoothed sparassodontid Thylacosmilus. The largest phorusrhacid birds may also have been able to prey on juveniles. After the GABI, the primary predator on adults would have been the very large sabertoothed cat Smilodon populator and giant short-faced bears. Dire wolves and jaguars may also have hunted Macrauchenia, particularly juveniles. It is presumed that Macrauchenia dealt with its predators primarily by outrunning them, or, failing that, kicking them with its long, powerful legs. The large size of adults would have limited their vulnerability to most predators. Its potential ability to twist and turn at high speed could have enabled it to evade pursuers; both Thylacosmilus and S. populator were ambush hunters likely unable to run down prey over distance if the prey evaded the first attack.

An England and Great Britain international , Long is regarded by many as one of the finest British players of his generation. He began his career with the Wigan Warriors, and also played for the Widnes Vikings and Hull FC, but is best known for his time playing for St. Helens in the Super League with whom he won a total of four Super League championships and five Challenge Cups, as well as numerous individual accolades including the Man of Steel award, and three Lance Todd Trophies. In 2017, he joined rugby union side Orrell RUFC in his first cross code move. Following his retirement as a player, Long began a coaching career. He is currently assistant coach of Harlequin FC, and the Samoa national rugby league team. Early life Between the ages of eleven and thirteen Long attended St Joseph's Catholic Comprehensive School in Horwich but moved to the Deanery High School on Frog Lane in Wigan because the former only played football, not rugby.Longy page 35 Playing career =1990s= After signing from local amateur side, Wigan St Judes, Long started his career at Wigan. After Wigan released him from his contract, Long moved to Widnes, where he attracted the attention of several of the European Super League's top clubs. He was signed by St Helens in 1997 to replace the departing Bobbie Goulding. In the 1997 post season, Long was selected to play for Great Britain from the interchange bench in two matches of the Super League Test series against Australia. Long played for St. Helens from the interchange bench, kicking two goals in their 1999 Super League Grand Final victory over Bradford Bulls. =2000s= Long twice set the St. Helens record for the number of points scored in a Super League season, gaining 284 points in 1999 and 352 points in 2000.

This is an algebraic analogue of the notion of a local isomorphism in the complex analytic topology. They satisfy the hypotheses of the implicit function theorem, but because open sets in the Zariski topology are so large, they are not necessarily local isomorphisms. Despite this, √©tale maps retain many of the properties of local analytic isomorphisms, and are useful in defining the algebraic fundamental group and the √©tale topology. The word √©tale is a French adjective, which means \\"slack\\", as in \\"slack tide\\", or, figuratively, calm, immobile, something left to settle.:fr: Tr√©sor de la langue fran√ßaise informatis√©, \\"√©tale\\" article  Definition  Let \\\\phi : R \\\\to S be a ring homomorphism. This makes S an R-algebra. Choose a monic polynomial f in R[x] and a polynomial g in R[x] such that the derivative f' of f is a unit in (R[x]/fR[x])_g. We say that \\\\phi is standard √©tale if f and g can be chosen so that S is isomorphic as an R-algebra to (R[x]/fR[x])_g and \\\\phi is the canonical map. Let f : X \\\\to Y be a morphism of schemes. We say that f is √©tale if and only if it has any of the following equivalent properties: # f is flat and G-unramified.EGA IV4, Corollaire 17.6.2. # f is a smooth morphism and unramified. # f is flat, locally of finite presentation, and for every y in Y, the fiber f^{-1}(y) is the disjoint union of points, each of which is the spectrum of a finite separable field extension of the residue field \\\\kappa(y). # f is flat, locally of finite presentation, and for every y in Y and every algebraic closure k' of the residue field \\\\kappa(y), the geometric fiber f^{-1}(y) \\\\otimes_{\\\\kappa(y)} k' is the disjoint union of points, each of which is isomorphic to \\\\mbox{Spec } k'. # f is a smooth morphism of relative dimension zero.EGA IV4, Corollaire 17.10.2. # f is a smooth morphism and a locally quasi-finite morphism.EGA IV4, Corollaire 17.6.2 and Corollaire 17.10.2. # f is locally of finite presentation and is locally a standard √©tale morphism, that is, #:For every x in X, let y = f(x). Then there is an open affine neighborhood of y and an open affine neighborhood of x such that is contained in and such that the ring homomorphism induced by f is standard √©tale.Milne, √âtale cohomology, Theorem 3.14. # f is locally of finite presentation and is formally √©tale. # f is locally of finite presentation and is formally √©tale for maps from local rings, that is: #:Let A be a local ring and J be an ideal of A such that . Set and , and let be the canonical closed immersion. Let z denote the closed point of Z0. Let and be morphisms such that . Then there exists a unique Y-morphism such that .EGA IV4, Corollaire 17.14.1. Assume that Y is locally noetherian and f is locally of finite type. For x in X, let y = f(x) and let \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal O}_{Y,y} \\\\to \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal O}_{X,x} be the induced map on completed local rings. Then the following are equivalent: # f is √©tale. # For every x in X, the induced map on completed local rings is formally √©tale for the adic topology.EGA IV4, Proposition 17.6.3 # For every x in X, \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal O}_{X,x} is a free \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal O}_{Y,y}-module and the fiber \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal O}_{X,x}/m_y\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal O}_{X,x} is a field which is a finite separable field extension of the residue field \\\\kappa(y). (Here m_y is the maximal ideal of \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal O}_{Y,y}.) # f is formally √©tale for maps of local rings with the following additional properties. The local ring A may be assumed Artinian. If m is the maximal ideal of A, then J may be assumed to satisfy . Finally, the morphism on residue fields may be assumed to be an isomorphism.EGA IV4, Proposition 17.14.2 If in addition all the maps on residue fields \\\\kappa(y) \\\\to \\\\kappa(x) are isomorphisms, or if \\\\kappa(y) is separably closed, then f is √©tale if and only if for every x in X, the induced map on completed local rings is an isomorphism.  Examples  Any open immersion is √©tale because it is locally an isomorphism. Covering spaces form examples of √©tale morphisms. For example, if d \\\\geq 1 is an integer invertible in the ring R then : \\\\text{Spec}(R[t,t^{-1},y]/(y^d - t)) \\\\to \\\\text{Spec}(R[t,t^{-1}]) is a degree d √©tale morphism. Any ramified covering \\\\pi:X \\\\to Y has an unramified locus : \\\\pi: X_{un} \\\\to Y_{un} which is √©tale. Morphisms :\\\\text{Spec}(L) \\\\to \\\\text{Spec}(K) induced by finite separable field extensions are √©tale ‚Äî they form arithmetic covering spaces with group of deck transformations given by \\\\text{Gal}(L/K). Any ring homomorphism of the form R \\\\to S=R[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n]_g/(f_1,\\\\ldots, f_n), where all the f_i are polynomials, and where the Jacobian determinant \\\\det(\\\\partial f_i/\\\\partial x_j) is a unit in S, is √©tale. For example the morphism \\\\mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}[x,t,t^{-1}]/(x^n - t) is etale and corresponds to a degree n covering space of \\\\mathbb{G}_m \\\\in Sch/\\\\mathbb{C} with the group \\\\mathbb{Z}/n of deck transformations. Expanding upon the previous example, suppose that we have a morphism f of smooth complex algebraic varieties. Since f is given by equations, we can interpret it as a map of complex manifolds. Whenever the Jacobian of f is nonzero, f is a local isomorphism of complex manifolds by the implicit function theorem. By the previous example, having non-zero Jacobian is the same as being √©tale. Let f : X\\\\to Y be a dominant morphism of finite type with X, Y locally noetherian, irreducible and Y normal. If f is unramified, then it is √©tale.SGA1, Expos√© I, 9.11 For a field K, any K-algebra A is necessarily flat. Therefore, A is an etale algebra if and only if it is unramified, which is also equivalent to :A \\\\otimes_{K}\\\\bar{K}\\\\cong\\\\bar{K}\\\\oplus ...\\\\oplus\\\\bar{K}, where \\\\bar K is the separable closure of the field K and the right hand side is a finite direct sum, all of whose summands are \\\\bar K. This characterization of etale K-algebras is a stepping stone in reinterpreting classical Galois theory (see Grothendieck's Galois theory).  Properties  * √âtale morphisms are preserved under composition and base change. * √âtale morphisms are local on the source and on the base. In other words, f: X\\\\to Y is √©tale if and only if for each covering of X by open subschemes the restriction of f to each of the open subschemes of the covering is √©tale, and also if and only if for each cover of Y by open subschemes the induced morphisms f_{(U)} : X \\\\times_Y U \\\\to U is √©tale for each subscheme U of the covering. In particular, it is possible to test the property of being √©tale on open affines V=\\\\operatorname{Spec}(B)\\\\to U=\\\\operatorname{Spec}(A). * The product of a finite family of √©tale morphisms is √©tale. * Given a finite family of morphisms \\\\\\\\{f_\\\\alpha : X_\\\\alpha \\\\to Y\\\\\\\\}, the disjoint union \\\\coprod f_\\\\alpha : \\\\coprod X_\\\\alpha \\\\to Y is √©tale if and only if each f_\\\\alpha is √©tale. * Let f : X \\\\to Y and g : Y \\\\to Z, and assume that g is unramified and gf is √©tale. Then f is √©tale. In particular, if X and X' are √©tale over Y, then any Y-morphism between X and X' is √©tale. * Quasi-compact √©tale morphisms are quasi-finite. * A morphism f : X \\\\to Y is an open immersion if and only if it is √©tale and radicial.EGA IV4, Th√©or√®me 17.9.1. * If f : X \\\\to Y is √©tale and surjective, then \\\\dim X = \\\\dim Y (finite or otherwise). Inverse function theorem √âtale morphisms :f: X -> Y are the algebraic counterpart of local diffeomorphisms. More precisely, a morphism between smooth varieties is √©tale at a point iff the differential between the corresponding tangent spaces is an isomorphism. This is in turn precisely the condition needed to ensure that a map between manifolds is a local diffeomorphism, i.e. for any point y ‚àà Y, there is an open neighborhood U of x such that the restriction of f to U is a diffeomorphism. This conclusion does not hold in algebraic geometry, because the topology is too coarse. For example, consider the projection f of the parabola :y = x2 to the y-axis. This morphism is √©tale at every point except the origin (0, 0), because the differential is given by 2x, which does not vanish at these points. However, there is no (Zariski-)local inverse of f, just because the square root is not an algebraic map, not being given by polynomials. However, there is a remedy for this situation, using the √©tale topology. The precise statement is as follows: if f : X\\\\to Y is √©tale and finite, then for any point y lying in Y, there is an √©tale morphism V ‚Üí Y containing y in its image (V can be thought of as an √©tale open neighborhood of y), such that when we base change f to V, then X\\\\times_Y V\\\\to V (the first member would be the pre-image of V by f if V were a Zariski open neighborhood) is a finite disjoint union of open subsets isomorphic to V. In other words, √©tale-locally in Y, the morphism f is a topological finite cover. For a smooth morphism f : X\\\\to Y of relative dimension n, √©tale-locally in X and in Y, f is an open immersion into an affine space \\\\mathbb A^n_Y. This is the √©tale analogue version of the structure theorem on submersions.  See also  *Purity (algebraic geometry)  References   Bibliography    *J. S. Milne (2008).

The game is based on the life of Oda Nobunaga. Historical background The game's time frame is roughly between the years 1550 to 1590. Contrary to many stories and portrayals that depict him as a villain or demon, Nobunaga is depicted in a more virtuous and ultimately tragic light, making Kessen III rather unusual in relation to other video games based in the same era. It is a heavily fantasized and romanticized depiction of his life, although unlike games such as the Samurai Warriors series it goes into more specific historical details. For example, the existence of the Ashikaga shogunate and Nobunaga's relationship is covered herein but completely omitted from the Samurai Warriors games. The game paints a positive picture on Nobunaga's life, and then enters a \\"what if\\" scenario showing what might have happened if he had survived the betrayal by Akechi Mitsuhide. It describes Nobunaga regaining his power base, and then defeating shogunate forces led by the Akechi Clan and other clans of Western Japan on the shores of Ky≈´sh≈´, with Nobunaga presumably becoming the new leader. Tokugawa Ieyasu is in this game, presented as Nobunaga's mild-mannered and dedicated ally, but is shown flying into a rage when he learns that Nobunaga survives his betrayal, believing that he was going to carry out Nobunaga's destiny. Toyotomi Hideyoshi is also shown, under the name of Hideyoshi Hashiba. His unlikely charisma inspires his troops after he is wrongly told of Nobunaga's death, which leads his friend to comment, \\"Maybe he would be the one to unite Japan, if Lord Oda was dead.\\" The game also allows battles against other notable daimy≈çs, such as Uesugi Kenshin and Takeda Shingen. There is a certain level of inaccuracy, due not only to the fantasy element, but also due to the appearance of Miyamoto Musashi, who had not yet been born when Nobunaga committed seppuku. Gameplay mechanics Kessen III refines the mechanics of the previous games even further while introducing new core elements. The flow of the game begins with the player selecting a mission from those available on the map. After being briefed on the mission's details, the player then selects which units to bring into the battle before issuing basic marching orders. During the battle itself, the player is in control of an individual unit and can switch between friendly units at any time, while the other units are controlled by artificial intelligence. Battle commences when friendly and enemy units encounter one another and unit health is measured by the number of troops remaining in the unit. Troops also have specific skills related to their particular type (cavalry, spearmen, ninja, etc.) and officers can learn powerful special skills and abilities such as defensive strategies or attack magic that can turn the tide of battle. All officers have access to a special skill called \\"rampage.\\" When used, the action zooms in around that officer, and the player enters a short, timed mini-battle against troops from an enemy unit. During a rampage, the player can earn bonus experience, gold, and restore lost troops to the unit by picking up the proper items dropped by defeated soldiers. After 100 soldiers are defeated, the enemy unit's officer appears, and if the player can defeat them, the officer under the player's control may receive even further bonuses. Battles end when the primary objective has been achieved. These objectives may include wiping out all enemy units, destroying a specific target, escorting a unit to a particular location, or making an escape. Grades on performance in battle are given at the end of each stage, and are based on how many enemy officers were defeated, the number of friendly officers were kept in battle, and the effective use of troop skills. Better grades yield items that can be used to outfit friendly officers, or gold to buy such items from merchants between battles. Battles are typically lost when Nobunaga's unit is defeated, time runs out, or a special mission requirement could not be completed. Cinematics The storyline of Kessen III is very detailed and makes frequent use of cinematic sequences rendered using both the game's own graphics engine and full motion video. These sequences are typically played at the start and end of each chapter, before and after battles, and during special events that take place during the course of a fight. Reception Kessen III was met with positive to average reception upon release; GameRankings gave it a score of 75.04%, while Metacritic gave it 73 out of 100.

In 2004, Practical Bible was renamed Davis College in his honor. Early life On Melandy Hill in Afton, New York, Davis was born to Union Civil War veteran Charles Davis and his wife, Hulda Davis. Davis was the oldest of two children, his younger brother being Alonzo F. Davis. After a few years in Afton and North Sanford, New York, Davis moved to Binghamton, New York. =Religious revelation= During his time in Binghamton, New York, Davis became a very devout Christian. In 1893, he went to the Chicago Bible Institute (now the Moody Bible Institute) where he served Mr. Moody's table. Heading back to New York after his time in Chicago, Davis stopped in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where a small set of evangelical meetings turned into a large revival meetings throughout the city. =Marriage and children= Davis married Etta Carr on June 19, 1894. Their son Gordon Carr was born June 29, 1896 followed by his brother Charles Justus in 1897. Career as an educator =Revival meetings= Davis conducted meetings in the following years of his life all over the east coast of the United States including: Binghamton, Baltimore, Maryland, Brooklyn, and New York. He also went to England. =Bible school= In the spring of 1900, Davis wanted to start a Bible school to train young men and women to become pastors, missionaries, pastor‚Äôs wives, and many other parts of the Christian ministry. In the summer of 1900, the classes of the Practical Bible Training School began in Lestershire (now Johnson City), New York. Davis became one of the teachers and the Superintendent of the school. Davis chose a long-time friend John R. Clements to be the first president of the college. The school moved to Harrison Street soon after the first classes and in 1911 the school moved to its present location on Riverside Drive in the village of Johnson City, New York. =PBTS= In 1914, the Practical Bible Training School was prospering and Dr. Davis became the President of the School. In 1922 the student body formed the Students League of Many Nations one of the first Multicultural ministries in America. It would travel to every state in the union, and even opened the United States Congress in prayer on multiple occasions, one of these times with the President of the United States. Later years On November 22, 1931, John and Etta lost their son, Charles. The next year in 1932, several faculty and staff left to form Baptist Bible Seminary (now in Clark Summit, Pennsylvania). =Death= On Saturday, March 17, 1934 after a stroke and several other health problems, Davis died in his bed. Over 4,000 people attended his funeral on the Knoll behind the school.

The system was developed by Siemens, who call the project SIPEM (SIemens PEople Mover). Two installations exist, one at the Dortmund university campus, the other at the D√ºsseldorf Airport. While Siemens is no longer actively marketing the system, and will no longer carry out turnkey projects, new installations are still possible in collaboration with the Dortmund operating company. Since 2011 Air Train International has been marketing the system in China and as of May 2013 there are proposals to build lines in Shanghai and Wenzhou. A number of other Chinese cities are also studying the system. Technical description The cabins are centrally controlled and do not need a driver. The system can operate on a schedule or on-demand, whereby a passenger requests a carriage by pushing a button, similar to summoning an elevator. The maximum speed is 50 km/h. The system allows forking by a system of switches in the carrier. = Suspension and propulsion = The carrier is a hollow rectangular box girder with a slit in the bottom through which the cabin is suspended at the running gear, whose two axles carry the load with a rubber wheel on both sides providing both suspension and propulsion. Two wheels run horizontally along the top and bottom of the interior side walls of the carrier box, providing horizontal guidance. Thus, the designation as a monorail system is to be taken with a grain of salt, meaning just that there is a single axis of suspension. 400-volt three-phase current is taken from four conductors at the side wall. Above those, a cable provides continuous wireless data connection between the train and the control center. All contact between the suspended cabin and the fixed system is enclosed in the interior of the carrier box, protected from the elements. In this sense, the SIPEM suspension system is similar to the one used by the earlier SAFEGE system (which was developed in France and which is used on two networks in Japan), but is much narrower, both the carrier box as well as the open slit for the suspension. The cabin is suspended below two motorized bogies, which are enclosed in the carrier girder. Each bogie is equipped with two 31 kW electric motors, providing a peak motive power of 124 kW. Each running gear is equipped with two motors, which are connected in parallel via their armature circuits.

The interior height for standing passengers is 2.003 m. It has two 1.350 m wide automatic sliding doors at each side. The Dortmund cabin provides seating for 16 and standing room for 29 passengers, while the D√ºsseldorf airport version provides space for 15 and 32, respectively. The cabin shell weighs 4955 kg. The complete car weighs 8455 kg, with bogies weighing 1750 kg each. It can carry a useful load of up to 4923 kg and has a maximum gross weight of 13378 kg. =Switching= Switching is done with the help of the horizontal guiding wheels, where short blades on both sides of the common section of the carrier move as a canal of the same width as the carrying box to the left or right, while a long blade between the two forking guideways moves right or left to provide the horizontal guidance into the intended direction. History In 1973, the Federal Ministry made DM 22 million (‚Ç¨11,250,000) available for the research and promotion of this system. A test line was opened on 21 July 1975 in D√ºsseldorf by the former transport minister Hans Matthoefer with a length of 180 metres (approx. 200 yards). In 1976, the system was extended by 1.5 km (a little less than a mile). =Dortmund= The first publicly funded overhead railway has run since 1984 at the University of Dortmund, where it initially just connected the north and south campuses with a single line. However, many stations have 2 platforms with a track either side permitting carriages to pass each other in opposite directions. This stretch was opened on 2 May 1984 by Dr. Heinz Riesenhuber, and comprised of track and two trains. The cost was approximately DM 24,000,000 (‚Ç¨12,270,000), of which 75% was funded by the German Federal Government, 20% by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and 5% by the city of Dortmund. The longest span between support pillars is 38.5 metres (126.3 ft), where it crosses the university road, which bisects the two campuses. Just beyond the road the H-Bahn crosses through a nature reserve at its maximum elevation of about 16 metres (approx. 50 feet) above ground. In order to prevent passengers getting close to the track at stations, there are platform edge doors between the platform and the track. As soon as the vehicles arrive in the station, doors in the partition open automatically, along with the train car doors. In 1993, following a three-year construction period, a new 900 m (0.56 mile) long branch was opened, along with two new stations, one in Eichlinghofen and another at the S-Bahn station at Dortmund university. This construction included technology considered to be the first of its kind in Germany. The existing system was renovated, and equipped with technology which allowed determining the train's location with a much higher precision -- within 3 cm (1.2 in). These changes allowed for a higher speed, and trains can now also follow each other more closely. Three new carriages were supplied by Siemens. An extension into the nearby technology park was opened on 19 December 2003, which means the current network, including this final extension, has a length of 3.162 km (approx. 2 miles). The building of this section cost around ‚Ç¨15,500,000. Line 1 operates between the Technology Park and Eichlinghofen, and during the day carriages arrive every ten minutes, stopping at the university and the S-Bahn stop, where there is a connection every twenty minutes to Dortmund city centre, and Bochum. Two trains serve line 1. Line 2 is the original line between the North and South campuses of the university, and is served by a third train. A reserve fourth vehicle is available, and there is also a maintenance vehicle. Further extensions to the H-Bahn network were being considered, but were not cost-effective enough: *Between the university and the central bus and train station of Dortmund. *Eastward from the university, as far as to the M√§rkische Strasse, southeast of downtown Dortmund. =D√ºsseldorf Airport= Skytrain D√ºsseldorf Airport A nearly identical monorail system called SkyTrain transfers passengers at D√ºsseldorf Airport.

For 21 years it was held in the gardens of Ingrams's home at Garsington Manor in Oxfordshire. Since 2011 the festival is held in Wormsley Park, the home of the Getty family near Stokenchurch in Buckinghamshire, England. After Ingrams's death in 2005 Anthony Whitworth-Jones became its General Director until 2013 when Douglas Boyd became Artistic Director.  Opera at Garsington  A characteristic feature of Garsington Opera's programming has been the combination of well known operas with discoveries of little known works. These have included the British premieres of Richard Strauss' Die √§gyptische Helena, Rossini's La gazzetta and L'equivoco stravagante, and Vivaldi's L'incoronazione di Dario.Michael Church, A royal opera to Garsington manor is born, The Independent, 2 June 2008. Retrieved 2 June 2008. The festival also gave the first British professional productions of Haydn's La vera costanza, Strauss' Die Liebe der Danae, Jan√°ƒçek's ≈†√°rka, and Tchaikovsky's Cherevichki. Performances take place in the specially designed seasonal Opera Pavilion from within which it is possible to view the surrounding landscape. This maintains the link with the outside, a tradition at Garsington Opera. The performances begin in the early evening, allowing for a long dinner during the interval, similar to Glyndebourne Festival Opera, and evening dress is suggested.Glyndebourne Festival Opera Visitors' Information ; Garsington Opera Visitors' Information Operas are often performed in their original language with English surtitles. In 2017 the Philharmonia Orchestra became a resident orchestra at the Festival, playing for one production per season, with the Garsington Opera Orchestra continuing to play three productions per year. From 2020 the Philharmonia Orchestra will be joined by The English Concert as the two resident orchestras, sharing the four productions annually. History =Garsington Manor= Garsington Manor photographed in 1865 by Henry Taunt In 1982, financier Leonard Ingrams (brother of Richard Ingrams, the founder of Private Eye) and his wife Rosalind bought Garsington Manor and soon realised the opportunities it offered for outdoor performance. The family became well known for organising this annual season of opera in the manor gardens.The Daily Telegraph. Obituary: Leonard Ingrams. 8 April 2005. Retrieved 2 June 2008. Garsington Manor saw its opera first performance in 1989 when Opera 80 performed Le nozze di Figaro in aid of the Oxford Playhouse. The success of the performance led to the founding of Garsington Opera soon afterwards by Leonard Ingrams. In 1990, the company's first season comprised Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte and the British premiere of Haydn's Orlando paladino. Ingrams asked the Guildhall Strings to play for his new company, and within a few years Garsington Opera had its own orchestra whose core remained the Guildhall Strings. From 1993 Garsington Opera was staging three opera productions. As demand for the opera grew, a purpose-built raked seating structure for around 500 people was created by architect Robin Snell. The auditorium was noted for its natural acoustic and good sight-lines. The stage was partly covered by a PVC fabric canopy completed in 1995 but was open to the gardens behind. Each year at the end of the season the entire edifice was dismantled and the fabric returned to Architen Landrell, the canopy's designers, for maintenance and storage.Garsington Opera House , Architen Landrell. Retrieved 2 June 2008. Ingrams also used the barn at Garsington Manor for an annual series of chamber music concerts. He installed into the barn the panelling from the old auditorium at Glyndebourne which was then being thrown out when the new auditorium at Glyndebourne was built. The barn was also used as the restaurant during the opera season, and opera guests could dine in it during the interval. The operas were performed on the stone loggia which overlooks the flower garden, designed and planted by Lady Ottoline Morrell when she owned the Manor during and after the First World War and entertained her famous Bloomsbury guests there e.g. T.S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Betrand Russell, W.B.Yeats. Sound-proofing screens were later erected around the theatre in response to complaints from a group of Garsington residents living near the Manor. In 1996, they won ¬£1,000 compensation for noise disturbance caused by the operas. When the award was overturned on appeal, local resident Monica Waud led her neighbours in a civil disobedience campaign during the 1997 performance of Haydn's Le Pescatrici. The protesters simultaneously began cutting their lawns with electric lawnmowers and diesel tractors, trimming their hedges, and turning on their hoses. Car alarms were set off and as a grand finale a private plane piloted by Miss Waud's companion flew overhead.Sarah Lyall, From the Opera's Neighbors, a Reply (Fortissimo), The New York Times, 7 July 1997.

In 2007, the Metropolitan Opera in New York staged Garsington's production of Die agyptische Helena, which Leonard Ingrams had put on in 1997. In April 2008, when it became clear that the opera needed more space, the Ingrams family gave notice that the Manor would not be able to host performances after the 2010 season, although the family would continue its support for the company.Andy Bloxham, Opera festival has to find new stage, The Daily Telegraph, 1 May 2008.

Founded in 1949, the university was the first upper- education institution to concentrate solely on teacher training. The name \\"Srinakharinwirot\\" was given by the King Bhumibol Adulyadej to honour his Mother Princess Srinagarindra (transliterated as ). The name, additionally, comes from Sanskrit word Sri meaning \\"glory\\", Nagara (Nakhon) meaning \\"city\\" and Vir≈çdha (Wirot) meaning flourishing; thus the meaning of \\"The Glorious (University) of the City\\". Srinakharinwirot University has two campuses; Prasarnmit Campus in Bangkok's Watthana District and Ongkharak Campus in Nakhon Nayok Province's Ongkharak District. Other minor campuses include Bhodivijjalaya College‚Äôs campuses in Sa Kaew Province and Chiang Mai Province‚Äôs Mae Chaem District. The university originally had 8 regional campuses; Prasanmitr, Pathumwan, Bang Saen, Phitsanulok, Maha Sarakham, Songkhla, Bang Khen and Phala Suksa (lit. Physical Education). The Prasanmitr campus remains the headquarter of the university, whilst Pathumwan Campus now exists as its teaching school, Patumwan Demonstration School. Some were later established as new universities; Burapha University (formerly Bang Saen Campus), Naresuan University (formerly Phitsanulok Campus), Mahasarakham University (formerly Mahasarakham Campus) and Thaksin University (formerly Songkhla Campus). The Bang Khen Campus was closed, moving to the main Prasarnmitr Campus, its former land is now occupied by the Phranakhon Rajabhat University. Lastly, the Phala Suksa Campus was closed and moved to Ongkharak Campus, being renowned as Faculty of Physical Education. The university's motto \\"Education is Growth\\" resembles the initial aim of teacher training and is illustrated through the logo resembling the exponential graph, meaning the exponential growth. History The university had its beginnings when the Higher Teacher Training School at Prasarnmit was founded in 1949. Prasarnmit was the first of its kind in the country's history. In 1953, it became the College of Education, having authority to grant a bachelor's degree in Education in the subject majors taught in Thai primary and secondary schools. Subsequently, programs at both the bachelors and masters levels were developed. In 1964, branch campuses were established for the regions of the country. The following were eventually created: Prasarnmitr Building in 1980 *Phitsanulok campus, for the north, now Naresuan University *Maha Sarakham campus, for the northeast, now Mahasarakham University *Bangsaen campus, for the southeast, now Burapha University *Songkhla campus, for the south, now Thaksin University Additional central campuses were also established: *Pathumwan campus, now merged with Prasarnmit campus *Physical Education campus, now merged with Faculty of Physical Education, Ongkharak campus *Bang Khen campus, now merged with Prasarnmit campus A teacher trainee of Srinakharinwirot University in the past In 1974, the College of Education became a comprehensive university by a royal decree of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who granted the university the name of Srinakharinwirot (See-na-ka- reen-wee-rot), which means 'the glory of the city'. The university offered undergraduate degrees in education, humanities, social science, science, physical education, and graduate degrees in education. In the higher education development plan Phase Five (1982-1986), a faculty of medicine was added; in Phase Seven (1992-1996), engineering, fine arts, and dentistry; and in Phase Eight (1997-2001), pharmacy, health science, and nursing. SWU Prasanmit has developed to be a metropolitan university focusing on graduate studies. SWU Ongkaruk has focused on the development of health science, technology, environment and community services. Over the years, the regional campuses grew in size and became separate universities. However, they preserve an unofficial tie with Srinakarinwirot University and regard the Bangkok university as their \\"mother campus\\".

It houses the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and the viceregal suite of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario and offices for members of the provincial parliament (MPPs). The building is surrounded by Queen's Park, sitting on that part south of Wellesley Street, which is the former site of King's College (later the University of Toronto), and which is leased from the university by the provincial Crown for a \\"peppercorn\\" payment of CAD$1 per annum on a 999-year term. The building and the provincial government are both often referred to by the metonym \\"Queen's Park\\". Characteristics The building's exterior is defined by its characteristic pink-hue sandstone. Designed by Richard A. Waite, the Ontario Legislative Building is an asymmetrical, five-storey structure built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, with a load-bearing iron frame. This is clad inside and out in Canadian materials where possible; the 10.5 million bricks were made by inmates of the Central Prison, and the Ontario sandstone‚Äîwith a pink hue that has earned the building the colloquial name of The Pink Palace‚Äîcomes from the Credit River valley and Orangeville, Ontario, and was given a rustic finish for most of the exterior, but dressed for trim around windows and other edges. There can also be seen over the edifice a multitude of stone carvings, including gargoyles, grotesques, and friezes. The exterior is punctuated with uncharacteristically large windows, allowed by the nature of the iron structure. The 1909 North Wing was built by noted Toronto architect George Wallace Gouinlock and E.J. Lennox added two floors to the west wing. The main fa√ßade fronts south, with the central axis of the building an extension of that for University Avenue, meaning that the Legislative Building creates a terminating vista for the north end of that main thoroughfare. The Legislative Chamber is directly on this axis, in the centre of the building, and is lit by the three large and prominent arched windows above the main portico. This block is flanked by two domed towers, the west of which was originally intended to hold a clock, but was fitted with a rose window instead, after funds for the clock were never amassed. The asymmetry of the south face was not originally as strong as it is at present; the west wing was designed to have three storeys under a pyramidal roof, as the east wing is still formed nowadays. After the fire of 1909, however, the west side of the Legislative Building was repaired and expanded, with an added fourth floor that bears wall dormer windows in a long, gabled roof. At the far termini of the east‚Äìwest axis, the wings each turn at right angles and extend north, enclosing a three-sided courtyard, in which sits the 1909 block, a free-standing, four storey structure that is rectangular in plan. Inside, a central hall runs between the main entrance at the south and a grand staircase directly opposite, from the mid-landing of which is accessed the parliamentary library in the 1909 block. At the top landing of this stair is the lobby of the legislative chamber, with the door to which centrally aligned in the south wall. From this core, wide corridors extend east and west, each bisected by a long and narrow atrium lined with ornate railings; the east wing is decorated more in the Victorian fashion in which it was built, with dark wood panelling, while the west wing corridor is more Edwardian Neoclassical in style, the walls lined with white marble, and reflecting the time in which it was built. To the south of the Legislative Building is an open area with extensive tree cover, which is often used for public gatherings and demonstrations. The provincial ministries are housed in the separate Ontario Government Buildings complex to the east, comprising the Hearst, Macdonald, Mowat, and Whitney Blocks. The building is featured on both the front and back covers of Rush's 1981 album Moving Pictures. Lieutenant Governor's Suite East view from the Dining Room within the Lieutenant Governor's Suite At the north-west corner of the building is the Lieutenant Governor's Suite, which has housed the office of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario since 1937, when Ontario sold the province's Government House to the Government of Canada. The space was previously used as the Cabinet dining room and the Speaker's apartment. The suite is a three-storey complex, with its own ceremonial staircase and elevator entrances where members of the Canadian Royal Family and visiting dignitaries are greeted. A rose garden, donated by the Monarchist League of Canada in honour of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 1977, sits on the west side of the building across the driveway. Inside are reception rooms, a state dining room, staff offices, and a kitchen, arranged around a central stair hall. The furnishings and chandeliers throughout the suite came from the last government house, Chorley Park, and paintings come from the Government of Ontario Art Collection and the Toronto Public Library. Special art exhibitions are also commissioned from time to time. The Music Room is the largest space in the viceregal suite, and is the site of New Years' Lev√©es, swearing-in ceremonies for cabinet ministers, and presentations of and investitures for provincial honours. =Portraits= The suite is also home to portraits of some the past Lieutenant Governors of Ontario as well as: * Queen Elizabeth II and The Duke of Edinburgh, and the Lieutenant Governor * large portrait of Upper Canada's first Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe by painted Sir Edmund Wyly Grier (loan from the Toronto Public Library.) History =Early structures= Legislature of Upper Canada was completed in 1794, although it was later destroyed after the Battle of York in 1813. The present Ontario Legislative Building is the seventh such structure to serve as Ontario's parliament building. Either Navy Hall or the Freemasons Hall in Newark, Upper Canada (today Niagara-on-the- Lake, Ontario), served as the first legislature, where the initial meeting of the House of Assembly occurred on 17 September 1791. Only three years later, however, construction began on a dedicated parliament building in York (now Toronto), as it was felt by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe that the presence of a provincial capital directly across the border from the United States was too great a risk, especially as the relations between the US and Britain were then tense. By June the complex, located at the intersection of Front and Parliament Streets, was completed, and the humble wood structures were dubbed the Palace of Parliament (The structure resembled two military barracks). The relocation to York did not ensure the protection of the capital, however, and the Palace of Parliament was destroyed by fire on 27 April 1813, as a consequence of an attack on the city in the War of 1812. The House of Assembly then met once in the ballroom of the York Hotel (between King and Front Streets), and regularly, from then until 1820, at the home of Chief Justice of the Court of the King's Bench William Henry Draper, which was located at the present intersection of Wellington and York Streets. The new parliament buildings was a two-storey Georgian architecture structure, put up on the site of the previous structure, stood only for four years, succumbing to an accidental fire on 30 December 1824. In 1832, the third parliament building for Upper Canada was completed. It was used by the legislature until 1840, when the colony united with Lower Canada to form the Province of Canada. From then until 1829, the House of Assembly gathered at the newly built York General Hospital, located on the south-east corner of the block bounded by King, Adelaide, John, and Peter Streets; a move that delayed the hospital's opening until the legislative body moved on to the old Court House, which stood on the north side of King Street, between Toronto and Church Streets. In 1832, a new structure was built on Front Street, west of Simcoe Street, and served continuously as the third parliament building of Upper Canada until the province was united with Lower Canada in 1840, after which the joined assembly was relocated by the then Governor General, Charles Poulett Thomson, Baron Sydenham, to the general hospital building in Kingston. The House of Assembly moved in and out of the Front Street building over the ensuing years, relocating for brief periods to Montreal and Quebec City, even at one point adopting a perambulation system that saw parliament relocate between Toronto and Quebec every four years. With mounting displeasure over the transient nature of the Canadian parliament, and an inability on the part of politicians to agree as to where to locate the legislative building, Queen Victoria was asked to make a selection; over all the other cities in the Province of Canada, she chose Bytown (later Ottawa) in 1857. Today, the site of the first parliament buildings in York is a parking lot for a car wash, a car rental company and a car dealership. Archaeological excavations at the site in 2000 undercovered evidence of the buildings. Subsequently, the property was bought by the Ontario Heritage Trust which operated a Parliament Interpretive Centre at the site from 2012‚Äì2015. The dig was covered up to await future plans for the site. =Queen's Park building= On 1 July 1867, however, the province joined with two others in confederation and was split into the present-day provinces of Ontario and Quebec, meaning that new legislatures were established for each of the two new provincial entities. Toronto was chosen as the capital of the former, and the legislative assembly moved back to the same Front Street property that had been home to the House of Assembly for the Province of Canada, despite the structure having been damaged by fire in 1861 and 1862. By 1880, a request was made for designs for a new parliament building for the province of Ontario, and, when none of the entries was found to be less than , the legislature approved during 1885 a budget of for the chosen scheme by Richard A. Waite. Queen's Park and Ontario Legislative Building, c. 1890s. The building was officially opened in 1893. Construction then commenced in 1886, and the Ontario Legislative Building was (though still incomplete) officially opened on 4 April 1893 by the then Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, George Airey Kirkpatrick. The final cost was tallied at approximately , and the design was criticised by some as \\"too American\\". This left the old parliament building on Front Street vacant, and it stood as such for nearly a decade before it was demolished from 1900 to 1903. The site was then sold to the Grand Trunk Railway, which used the former parliamentary land for freight sheds and marshalling yards. The location is now occupied by the Canadian Broadcasting Centre, a public square, and a number of high-rise buildings. With an increasing population in the province, it became necessary in 1909 to add a wing to the north side of the Ontario Legislative Building, enclosing the courtyard. As construction was underway, on 1 September men repairing galvanised roofing on the west wing accidentally sparked a fire that eventually destroyed the interior of that part of the edifice, including the legislative library. It then took until 1912 for repairs and reconstructions to be made, and the new wing to be completed. Further expansions of the parliamentary infrastructure were from then on built across the east side of Queen's Park Crescent, with the Whitney Block built in 1925, the Macdonald and Hepburn Blocks completed in 1968, the Mowat and Hearst Blocks in 1969. Security Security within the Legislative grounds is provided by the Legislative Security Service, which took over from the Ontario Provincial Police. Some members have been armed with handguns since 2016. The 75-member unit reports to the Sergeant-at-Arms and patrols both Queen's Park and Whitney Block. Most officers of the unit are ranked as Special Constables or Agents.

The first comic book marketed with a variant cover was the 1986 first issue of The Man of Steel, which featured two different covers by writer/artist John Byrne. Variant covers became more common during the \\"speculator boom\\" of the 1990s, when more collectors became interested in the storage and preservation of their comic books with the goal of future financial gain rather than reading the comics themselves. History The first comic book marketed with a variant cover was the 1986 first issue of The Man of Steel, which featured two different covers by writer/artist John Byrne. One featured a full shot of Superman ripping open the shirt comprising part of his civilian clothing to reveal the Kryptonian \\"S\\" emblem on his chest, along with a shot of the spaceship that brought him to Earth escaping Krypton. The other cover featured a closeup of Superman's chest as he rips open his shirt.Cronin, Brian (April 24, 2008). \\"Comic Book Questions Answered: What Was the First Variant Cover?'. Comic Book Resources. =The speculator boom of the 1990s= In reaction to the boom, comic book publishers began to market specifically to the collectors' market. Knowing that many collectors are completists, buying, for example, every issue featuring a certain character, publishers began to produce comics with multiple covers, and completists and speculators alike bought them by the millions. The variants often depended on whether the copy was sold through the direct market or at a newsstand. X-Men #1, from 1991, is the best-selling comic book of all time, with sales of over 8.1 million copies and nearly $7 million, according to a public proclamation by Guinness World Records at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con.Cantor, Michael (Producer); Schreiber, Liev (Narrator) Superheroes: A Never-Ending Battle. PBS. October 15, 2013. The sales figures were generated in part by publishing the issue with five different variant covers, designated #1A, #1B, #1C, #1D, and #1E. The first four covers show different characters from the book that form a single image when laid side by side, and a fifth, gatefold cover of that combined image, large numbers of which were purchased by retailers, who anticipated fans and speculators who would buy multiple copies in order to acquire a complete collection of the covers. Not every issue with variant covers sold well, but that did not dissuade the publishers. Variant covers graced the covers of titles from Marvel, DC, Valiant, and Image, as well as numerous small-press publishers. In 1993, DC Comics shipped the first printing of Superman #75, featuring the climax of \\"The Death of Superman\\" storyline, in a black polybag with a Superman armband inside. Collectors who wanted to keep their copy pristine but also read the story either bought multiple copies or subsequent printings (which had the same cover but not the polybag and fan incentives). Likewise, second printings of other issues with \\"gimmick covers\\" typically shipped without the gimmick. Jim Lee, now one of the co-founders of Image Comics, published variant cover comic books through his Wildstorm Studios imprint. Gen13 #1 bore 13 different covers, each with a character in an homage to a comic book, advertisement, or movie poster. DV8 #1 bore eight different covers, one a group shot and the rest representing the seven deadly sins. =Chase covers= Due to shortages caused by production errors, some variant covers came to be known as \\"chase covers\\", as many scrambled to find them, much as baseball card collectors sought chase cards. Publishers created chase covers by issuing variants in ratios designed to make one variant rare. They also began to produce retailer-incentive copies - identical to the retail version, but with covers usually printed or embossed in silver or gold - with one retailer-incentive shipping for every 25 or 50 copies of the regular issue that the retailer ordered. Some smaller publishers such as Verotik created expensive adult-only variants depicting nudity. Additionally, comic book conventions gave attendees convention-exclusive variants as part of their convention packages. =Post-boom= DC Comics In the years since the boom ended, with the remaining readers and publishers left in shell-shock, publishers generally shied away from producing comics that appeared to be directed at collectors, variant covers among them. Recently, however, variant covers have made a comeback. The 2004 limited series Identity Crisis from DC Comics was so popular that every issue went through multiple printings, each with a different cover. Some fans who had already bought the first printing bought the variants to complete their collection. Seeing this, other publishers tried to duplicate the success. For instance, for every set number of issues a retailer ordered of New Avengers #1-6, they received a retailer- incentive issue featuring art by a heavily promoted Marvel artist. In addition to retailer incentives, publishers again publish simple variants, though usually in equal proportions. Since Identity Crisis, second printings usually have a different cover, often merely the alteration or removal of color. Marvel Comics After the boom, Marvel Comics used variant covers on various occasions. When the Marvel Zombies universe first appeared in 2005's Ultimate Fantastic Four #21, the popularity spawned a limited series featuring several variant covers by Arthur Suydam. These variants reproduced classic Marvel Comics covers with an added zombie motif. To celebrate the inauguration of Barack Obama, Amazing Spider-Man #583 presented an all-new story teaming up President Obama and Spider-Man in \\"Spidey Meets the President!\\" The title featured five variant covers. In honor of Wolverine's 35th anniversary in 2009, Marvel released numerous Marvel titles with Wolverine Art Appreciation variant covers. The covers were done in styles reminiscent of Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dal√≠, and Andy Warhol. The first issues to feature a Wolverine Art Appreciation variant cover were Captain Britain and MI13 #12, Amazing Spider- Man #590, Hulk #11, Uncanny X-Men #508, and Secret Warriors #3. The Amazing Spider-Man (1963) No. 666 holds the record for the single issue with the most variants at 145 different covers. Outside of comics The practice of issuing variant covers has spread to some magazines, notably TV Guide, which has its own collector's market. TV Guide has published variants for various TV series, including Smallville,Comics Buyer's Guide #1485. May 3, 2002. Cover Dawson's Creek and Friends. Notes A varying number, decreasing from 20 issues for #1 to 15 issues for #6, itself revised from an earlier, more complicated formula.

Topological analogue/informal discussion In algebraic topology, the fundamental group œÄ1(X,x) of a pointed topological space (X,x) is defined as the group of homotopy classes of loops based at x. This definition works well for spaces such as real and complex manifolds, but gives undesirable results for an algebraic variety with the Zariski topology. In the classification of covering spaces, it is shown that the fundamental group is exactly the group of deck transformations of the universal covering space. This is more promising: finite √©tale morphisms are the appropriate analogue of covering spaces. Unfortunately, an algebraic variety X often fails to have a \\"universal cover\\" that is finite over X, so one must consider the entire category of finite √©tale coverings of X. One can then define the √©tale fundamental group as an inverse limit of finite automorphism groups. Formal definition Let X be a connected and locally noetherian scheme, let x be a geometric point of X, and let C be the category of pairs (Y,f) such that f \\\\colon Y \\\\to X is a finite √©tale morphism from a scheme Y. Morphisms (Y,f)\\\\to (Y',f') in this category are morphisms Y\\\\to Y' as schemes over X. This category has a natural functor to the category of sets, namely the functor :F(Y) = \\\\operatorname{Hom}_X(x, Y); geometrically this is the fiber of Y \\\\to X over x, and abstractly it is the Yoneda functor represented by x in the category of schemes over X. The functor F is typically not representable in C; however, it is pro-representable in C, in fact by Galois covers of X. This means that we have a projective system \\\\\\\\{X_j \\\\to X_i \\\\mid i < j \\\\in I\\\\\\\\} in C, indexed by a directed set I, where the X_i are Galois covers of X, i.e., finite √©tale schemes over X such that \\\\\\\\#\\\\operatorname{Aut}_X(X_i) = \\\\operatorname{deg}(X_i/X).J. S. Milne, Lectures on √âtale Cohomology, version 2.21: 26-27 It also means that we have given an isomorphism of functors :F(Y) = \\\\varinjlim_{i \\\\in I} \\\\operatorname{Hom}_C(X_i, Y). In particular, we have a marked point P\\\\in \\\\varprojlim_{i \\\\in I} F(X_i) of the projective system. For two such X_i, X_j the map X_j \\\\to X_i induces a group homomorphism \\\\operatorname{Aut}_X(X_j) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Aut}_X(X_i) which produces a projective system of automorphism groups from the projective system \\\\\\\\{X_i\\\\\\\\}. We then make the following definition: the √©tale fundamental group \\\\pi_1(X,x) of X at x is the inverse limit : \\\\pi_1(X,x) = \\\\varprojlim_{i \\\\in I} {\\\\operatorname{Aut}}_X(X_i), with the inverse limit topology. The functor F is now a functor from C to the category of finite and continuous \\\\pi_1(X,x)-sets, and establishes an equivalence of categories between C and the category of finite and continuous \\\\pi_1(X,x)-sets. Examples and theorems The most basic example of a fundamental group is œÄ1(Spec k), the fundamental group of a field k. Essentially by definition, the fundamental group of k can be shown to be isomorphic to the absolute Galois group Gal (ksep / k). More precisely, the choice of a geometric point of Spec (k) is equivalent to giving a separably closed extension field K, and the fundamental group with respect to that base point identifies with the Galois group Gal (K / k). This interpretation of the Galois group is known as Grothendieck's Galois theory. More generally, for any geometrically connected variety X over a field k (i.e., X is such that Xsep := X √ók ksep is connected) there is an exact sequence of profinite groups :1 -> œÄ1(Xsep, ) -> œÄ1(X, ) -> Gal(ksep / k) -> 1\\\\. =Schemes over a field of characteristic zero= For a scheme X that is of finite type over C, the complex numbers, there is a close relation between the √©tale fundamental group of X and the usual, topological, fundamental group of X(C), the complex analytic space attached to X. The algebraic fundamental group, as it is typically called in this case, is the profinite completion of œÄ1(X). This is a consequence of the Riemann existence theorem, which says that all finite √©tale coverings of X(C) stem from ones of X. In particular, as the fundamental group of smooth curves over C (i.e., open Riemann surfaces) is well understood; this determines the algebraic fundamental group. More generally, the fundamental group of a proper scheme over any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is known, because an extension of algebraically closed fields induces isomorphic fundamental groups. =Schemes over a field of positive characteristic and the tame fundamental group= For an algebraically closed field k of positive characteristic, the results are different, since Artin‚ÄìSchreier coverings exist in this situation. For example, the fundamental group of the affine line \\\\mathbf A^1_k is not topologically finitely generated. The tame fundamental group of some scheme U is a quotient of the usual fundamental group of U which takes into account only covers that are tamely ramified along D, where X is some compactification and D is the complement of U in X. For example, the tame fundamental group of the affine line is zero. = Affine schemes over a field of characteristic p = It turns out that every affine scheme X \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{A}^n_k is a K(\\\\pi,1)-space, in the sense that the etale homotopy type of X is entirely determined by its etale homotopy group. Note \\\\pi = \\\\pi_1^{et}(X,\\\\overline{x}) where \\\\overline{x} is a geometric point. =Further topics= From a category-theoretic point of view, the fundamental group is a functor :{Pointed algebraic varieties} -> {Profinite groups}. The inverse Galois problem asks what groups can arise as fundamental groups (or Galois groups of field extensions). Anabelian geometry, for example Grothendieck's section conjecture, seeks to identify classes of varieties which are determined by their fundamental groups. studies higher √©tale homotopy groups by means of the √©tale homotopy type of a scheme. The pro-√©tale fundamental group have introduced a variant of the √©tale fundamental group called the pro-√©tale fundamental group. It is constructed by considering, instead of finite √©tale covers, maps which are both √©tale and satisfy the valuative criterion of properness. For geometrically unibranch schemes (e.g., normal schemes), the two approaches agree, but in general the pro-√©tale fundamental group is a finer invariant: its profinite completion is the √©tale fundamental group.

It operated domestic and international cargo services, and charter passenger services throughout the US, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean, as well as wet and dry leasing. Its main base was in Orlando Sanford International Airport.  History  The airline was established in 1983 by Alinda and Jim Wikert as Jet East International, flying one Boeing 727-100 on a contract from DHL. They started operations that same year. At its peak, the company was flying freight with over 20 Boeing 727s and passengers in several Douglas DC-9s from hubs in Austin, Texas, Indianapolis, Indiana, Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Brussels, Belgium when it was purchased by Orchard Capital in 2000. Express One also leased two Boeing 727-200 jetliners in passenger configuration to a new start-up air carrier, Western Pacific Airlines. According to the April 2, 1995 edition of the Official Airline Guide (OAG), Express One International was operating scheduled passenger service round trip between Las Vegas (LAS) and Minneapolis/St. Paul (MSP) with Boeing 727-200 aircraft.http://www.departedflights.com, April 2, 1995 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Las Vegas-Minneapolis/St. Paul flight schedules By the end of the 1990s, the company's fleet had grown to some 28 aircraft, and charter operations were flown between Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA. It also flew to Asia for the U.S. government.Orlando Business Journal 30 July 2004 2001 was a difficult year for the company, and by July, several key contracts expired without renewal. A severe blow was dealt in August 2001 when the United States Postal Service cancelled its contracts with its existing carriers, and turned these duties over to FedEx. The company saw a short reprieve when Emery Worldwide suddenly eliminated their own airline in favor of using contract carriers, and Express One received a short-term contract to carry freight until the end of 2001. Having secured little new business by the end of the year, the company removed most of their aircraft from service, and furloughed the vast majority of their employees to conserve resources. However, this was not enough to prevent them from filing for bankruptcy, and ceasing operations by mid-2002. In 2002, a group of six investors, headed by Richard C. Byers and Larry Brinker, purchased all the company's common stock, assets, training programs, and intellectual properties, as well as their name, logo, property, and operating certificate, and the company was moved to Orlando Sanford International Airport in Florida. In July 2004, the airline acquired Central Florida Air Maintenance to serve as the home maintenance base. In February 2008, Express One and Joseph Kuchta were debarred from government contracting as a result of collusive bidding conduct and fraud.

The next street to the west is Sycamore Street, then Main Street. Cincinnati began with the settlement of Columbia, Losantiville, and North Bend in the Northwest Territory of the United States beginning in late December 1788. The following year Fort Washington, named for George Washington, was established to protect the settlers. It was chartered as a town in 1802, and then incorporated as a city in 1819, when it was first called \\"Queen of the West\\". Located on the Ohio River, the city prospered as it met the needs of westward bound pioneers who traveled on the river. It had 30 warehouses to supply military and civilian travelers ‚Äî and had hotels, restaurants and taverns to meet their lodging and dining needs. Cincinnati became the sixth largest city in the United States, with a population of 115,435, by 1850. Before the Civil War, it was an important stop on the Underground Railroad. Due to the Defense of Cincinnati, there was never a shot fired in the city during the Civil War. Important industries throughout its history include meatpacking, iron production, steamboat repair and construction, carriage manufacturing, woodworking, cloth production, and engines. During World War I and II, Cincinnatians rallied to serve in the military, manufacture and produce supplies needed by the military, conserve scarce goods, buy Liberty Bonds, and donate to relief funds. There were increased opportunities for women and blacks during World War II, which ultimately shifted their social position after the war. The city is now a regional and national headquarters for many organizations. Early history =Native Americans= Artists conception of the SunWatch Indian Village of the Fort Ancient people From about 900 to 1600 CE, during the Late Prehistoric Period, a cultural group called the Fort Ancient people lived in southwest Ohio. Shawnee, as well as Siouan speakers such as the Mosopelea and Tutelo are believed by some scholars to be their descendants, were hunter- gatherers who established villages during the summers and followed and hunted animal populations in the winter throughout the Ohio River Valley. Men hunted and protected their tribes, while women gathered food and farmed crops. They constructed wigwams for lodging in the villages. Like other tribes in Ohio‚Äîthe Ojibwe, Miami and Lenape people‚Äîtheir language is of the Algonquian languages family. View from the Shawnee Lookout Archeological District, which may be the largest continuously occupied hilltop Native American site in the United States. Their way of life changed, beginning in the mid-1600s, as people of European descent encroached on their hunting and summer lands and became competitors of Europeans and other Native American tribes in the ensuing fur trade of British and French fur traders. Their options for redress were to search for unoccupied land, destroy colonial settlements, or fight. Many Shawnee and other tribes were driven out of Ohio beginning in the 1640s by the Iroquois Confederacy who hunted deer, beaver, and other fur-bearing animals. The Shawnee supported the French during the French and Indian War (1754-1763). There were continued land disputes and treaties in the 18th century. Members of the Ojibwa, Lenape, Ottawa, Wyandotte and Shawnee tribes formed an alliance with the Miami tribe, led by Little Turtle in the fight for their land. Ultimately, after the Battle of the Wabash (1792) and Battle of Fallen Timbers (1794), eleven tribes signed the Treaty of Greenville in 1794 which forced them to relinquish most of their land. =Symmes Purchase= Symmes Purchase, elongated strip in blue, within a map of Ohio With the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, the country expanded westward to frontier land north of the Ohio River and within the confines of the Northwest Territory. In 1786, Benjamin Stites traveled to the Little Miami Valley and noticed that there was fertile land for settlement and conveyed that information to eastern speculators. Hearing of the possibilities, a Continental Congress delegate John Cleves Symmes, purchased one or two million acres in 1787 from the Congress of the Confederation that was called Symmes Purchase. Also called the Miami Purchase, the land between the Great and Little Miami Rivers, ultimately became Warren, Butler, and Hamilton Counties. Of Symmes Purchase, Stites purchased 10,000 acres, 800 acres of which he sold to Mathias Denman. Denman's land was along the Ohio River and across from the mouth of the Licking River. =Three initial settlements= Replica of a flatboat that delivered pioneers to the three settlements: Columbia, Losantiville, and North Bend that would become Cincinnati. Pioneers came on flatboats along the Ohio River to settle what would become Cincinnati, located between the Little Miami and Great Miami rivers on the north shore of the Ohio River. The city began as three settlements: Columbia, Losantiville, and North Bend. Columbia, a mile west of the Little Miami River, was settled when a group of 26 people led by Benjamin Stites arrived on November 18, 1788. Stites had arranged parties of pioneers from New Jersey and Pennsylvania. They settled at the present site of Lunken Airport, where they built a blockhouse and log cabins, partially using wood from their flatboats. More people arrived over time, and more cabins were built. They struggled to get enough food to feed themselves and the new arrivals, but they did what they could by fishing, hunting, making a flour out of bear grass, farming, and acquiring some food from traders from Pittsburg. Of the three settlements, Columbia grew the fastest at first. It was initially the center of trading and the granary of the area. The first Protestant church (Baptist) in the Northwest Territory was erected in Columbia. On December 28, 1788, eleven families with 24 men landed across from Licking River at what would be Sycamore Street and at present-day Yeatman's Cove. Losantiville, the central settlement, was named by the original surveyor, John Filson, who scouted the area on September 22, 1788 with Mathias Denman, and Colonel Robert Patterson. The name which means \\"The city opposite the mouth of the river\\" is composed of four terms, each of different language. Denmen died in October 1788, perhaps killed by Native Americans. The group, led by Patterson, who founded Lexington, Kentucky, originated in Limestone (now Maysville, Kentucky). When they arrived, Israel Ludlow became the settlement's surveyor and he laid out the town in a grid plan, which went from Northern Row (now Seventh Street) to the river, where land was set aside for a public landing. Its eastern and western borders are now Central Avenue and Broadway. Before April 1, 1789, 30 lots were given to people so the settlement would grow. It was attractive for its town layout along the waterfront. Aside from what they attained through hunting and fishing, they grew corn, beans, squash, cucumbers, and pumpkin. The town soon had a tavern and ferry service that carried people across the Ohio River to Kentucky. A justice of the peace, William McMillan was installed. By 1790, there were 700 people in the town due to an influx of new settlers and military troops posted at Fort Washington. Symmes wrote that Losantiville, then a settlement of forty two-story log houses, \\"assumes the appearance of a town of some respectability\\". North Bend blockhouse illustration from Henry Howe, Historical Collections of Ohio, 1847. North Bend on the Great Miami and a few miles west of Losantiville was founded by Symmes in February 1789. He had arranged a group of pioneers from Limestone, Kentucky that included soldiers and his family members to travel to the area. Like the people of Columbia and Losantiville, North Bend settlers struggled to get enough food initially. North Bend provided 24 lots to new settlers by May 1789. =Fort Washington= Symmes and St. Clair were concerned about Native American tribes, who would provide resistance to settlement by whites. There were over 260,000 square miles of the Northwest Territory‚Äîincluding the present-day states of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin‚Äîthat were protected by just 300 soldiers of the First Infantry Regiment. Native American tribes of the Ohio Valley were hostile to the encroachment by white people and there were \\"back-and-forth raids\\" among the cohabitating peoples. Most of the Native Americans in the Northwest Territory received aid from the British and generally sided with them‚Äîand they were not party to the Treaty of Paris (1783) that ceded land to the United States. In 1789, Fort Washington was constructed under the direction of General Josiah Harmar and was named in honor of President George Washington. It was built in the north-east corner of Losantiville and served all of the Northwest Territory for five years. During that time, 613 troops under the command of St. Clair were lost during a battle with Miami chief Little Turtle. The Treaty of Greenville was signed in 1795 after Major General Anthony Wayne won the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The fort, no longer needed, was torn down in 1808. =Society of Cincinnati= Cincinnatus statue at Sawyer Point Park On January 4, 1790, Arthur St. Clair, the governor of the Northwest Territory, changed the name of the settlement to \\"Cincinnati\\" in honor of the Society of the Cincinnati, of which he was president, possibly at the suggestion of the surveyor Israel Ludlow. The society gets its name from Cincinnatus, the Roman general and dictator, who saved the city of Rome from destruction and then quietly retired to his farm. The society was composed of Continental Army officers of the Revolutionary War. =Early settlers= Among the settlers, rabbit and deer pelts were used to barter for goods. Cincinnati was populated by Revolutionary War soldiers who were granted lands in the state. This included men like John Cleves Symmes who acquired large parcels of land and sold off tracts for a profit. Some former officers were given large parcels of land in payment for their service. There were also civilians that came to the area seeking an opportunity for a successful life based upon the purchase of affordable land. Hamilton County was established on January 4, 1790 by Arthur St. Clair. Tensions between pioneers and Native Americans increased over time, and Hamilton County issued a proclamation forbidding reckless shooting and barring the sale of liquor to Native Americans. All men were subject to military duty and people made preparations to defend their settlements. In addition, more soldiers arrived at Fort Washington. Some people moved to safer Kentucky communities in 1790. Winthrop Sargent The frontier town had houses of ill-repute and a number of taverns, neither of which were regulated and were frequented by the fort's soldiers. Winthrop Sargent, the Northwest Territory Secretary beginning in 1787 and for a time was acting governor, found the city's residents were \\"licentious\\" and \\"extremely debauched\\". He issued a proclamation in 1790 to ban the sale of liquor to soldiers. There was not support, though, from the townspeople to regulate business at bordellos and taverns. He was \\"so despised by his own men that his home was the subject of artillery practice while he was away.\\" A sheriff was hired and a court was established, but the sheriff was generally unable to maintain control within Cincinnati. This was due to drunkenness of the fort's soldiers and tensions with the Shawnee and other local Native Americans. Often the military established martial law to maintain order. The population of the settlement grew, and a wide range of businesses were established by 1795, including furniture manufacturers, a butcher, a brewer, and a French pastry chef. To meet the needs of pioneers and soldiers heading west on the Ohio River, there were 30 warehouses that supplies the needs of the travelers. Cincinnati was chartered as a town on January 1, 1802. Cincinnati established James Smith as the first town marshall; the following year the town started a \\"night watch\\". There were about 1,000 civilian residents in 1803, the military abandoned Fort Washington. By 1820, there were nearly 10,000 residents. The introduction of steam navigation on the Ohio River in 1811 helped the city grow. The Miami and Erie Canal figures prominently in this 1841 lithograph view of Cincinnati In addition to providing supplies for travelers, in the early 19th century there was a wide range of service-based businesses‚Äîincluding restaurants, taverns, and hotels‚Äîto meet traveler's needs. Transportation on the Ohio River also assisted in the city's growth. Crops were sent to one of Ohio's major markets, New Orleans, along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Transportation costs were reduced for shipping crops or goods from western Ohio to Cincinnati due to the Miami and Erie Canal. Steamboats were repaired and built in the city. It became a meatpacking center, where livestock was slaughtered and butchered and sold in Cincinnati or shipped. Cincinnati became known as the \\"Porkopolis\\" when it became the pork-processing center of the country. Incorporation and pre-Civil War The corporate seal of the City of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. The area was settled in 1788, the settlements became the town of Cincinnati, and it was chartered as a city in 1819. This version of the seal was in use by 1861. It was chartered as a city by an act of the General Assembly that passed February 5, 1819, and took effect on March 1 of that year. The same year, Cincinnati began publishing city directories, listing the names of the residents, their occupations, and their residential addresses. These old directories remain a valuable resource for people seeking information about early residents. The Medical College of Ohio was founded by Daniel Drake in 1819. It was the sixth-largest city in the country, with a population of 115,435, by 1850. In 1850 it was the first city in the United States to establish a Jewish Hospital. =Police and fire services= In 1819, when Cincinnati was incorporated as a city, the first city marshal, William Ruffin, was appointed. In May 1828, the police force consisted of one captain, one assistant, and five patrolmen. By 1850, the city authorized positions for a police chief and six lieutenants, but it was 1853 before the first police chief, Jacob Keifer, was appointed and he was dismissed after 3 weeks. Cincinnati accompanied its growth by paying men to act as its Cincinnati Fire Department in 1853, making the first full-time paid fire department in the United States. It was the first in the world to use steam fire engines. =Abolitionists and the Underground Railroad= Charles T. Webber, The Underground Railroad, 1893, Cincinnati Art Museum Cincinnati was an important stop for the Underground Railroad in pre-Civil War times. It bordered a slave state, Kentucky, and is often mentioned as a destination for many people escaping the bonds of slavery. There are many harrowing stories involving abolitionists, runaways, slave traders and free men. Allen Temple African Methodist Episcopal Church Allen Temple African Methodist Episcopal Church was founded in 1824 as the first Black church in Ohio. It was an important stop on the Underground Railroad for many years. It seeded many other congregations in the city, across the state, and throughout the Midwest. Lane Theological Seminary was established in the Walnut Hills section of Cincinnati in 1829 to educate Presbyterian ministers. Prominent New England pastor Lyman Beecher moved his family (Harriet and son Henry) from Boston to Cincinnati to become the first President of the Seminary in 1832. Lane Seminary is known primarily for the \\"debates\\" held there in 1834 that influenced the nation's thinking about slavery. Several of those involved went on to play an important role in the abolitionist movement and the buildup to the American Civil War. Hammatt Billings, \\"The Fugitives are Safe in a Free Land\\" for Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). It shows characters of George Harris, Eliza, Harry, and Mrs. Smyth. Abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe lived in Cincinnati for part of her life. She wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin, first published on March 20, 1852. The book was the best-selling novel of the 19th century (and the second best-selling book of the century after the Bible)http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-uncletomscabin/intro.html Introduction to Uncle Tom's Cabin Study Guide and is credited with helping to fuel the abolitionist cause in the United States prior to the American Civil War. In the first year after it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold. In his 1985 book Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, Thomas Gossett observed that \\"in 1872 a biographer of Horace Greeley would argue that the chief force in developing support for the Republican Party in the 1850s had been Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\" The Harriet Beecher Stowe House in Cincinnati is located at 2950 Gilbert Avenue, and it is open to the public. The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, located in downtown Cincinnati on the banks of the Ohio River, largely focuses on the history of slavery in the U.S., but has an underlying mission of promoting freedom in a contemporary fashion for the world. Its grand opening ceremony in 2002 was a gala event involving many national stars, musical acts, fireworks, and a visit from the current First Lady of the United States. It is physically located between Great American Ballpark and Paul Brown Stadium, which were both built and opened shortly before the Freedom Center was opened. =Race relations before the Civil War= Underground Railroad map, which shows the northerly route from Cincinnati. Situated across the Ohio River from the border state of Kentucky, which allowed slavery, and slavery was illegal in Ohio, Cincinnati was a natural destination or part of a northerly route for people escaping slavery. Anti-slavery tracts and newspapers were published in Cincinnati to send to the South. There were some people that were concerned that blacks would compete with them for jobs. Tension built when people perceived that blacks were infringing on opportunities available to white or becoming powerful. For instance, Irish immigrants believed that blacks were taking their job opportunities in 1829. The Cincinnati Riots of 1829 broke out in July and August 1829 as whites attacked blacks in the city. Many of the latter had come from the South to establish a community with more freedom. Some 1200 blacks left the city as a result of rioting and resettled in Canada. Blacks in other areas tried to raise money to help people who wanted to relocate to Canada. The riot was a topic of discussion in 1830 among representatives of seven states at the first Negro Convention, led by Bishop Richard Allen and held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As the anti-slavery movement grew, there were more riots in 1836, when whites attacked a press run by James Birney, who had started publishing the anti-slavery weekly The Philanthropist. The mob grew to 700 and also attacked black neighborhoods and people.\\"The Pro-Slavery Riot in Cincinnati\\", Abolitionism 1830-1850, Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, University of Virginia, 1998-2007, accessed 14 Jan 2009 Another riot occurred in 1841.Carter G. Woodson, Charles Harris Wesley, The Negro in Our History, Associated Publishers, 1922, p. 140 (digitized from original at University of Michigan Library), accessed 13 Jan 2009 Irish and German immigrants settled in Cincinnati and beginning in the 1830s there were some people who did not accept people of other backgrounds. They were targeted by the temperance movement because they were perceived to be heavy drinkers. See Cincinnati Nativist Riots of 1855. =Nicknames= Cincinnati was first called \\"Queen of the West\\" in 1819 by Ed. B. Cooke who wrote \\"The City is, indeed, justly styled the fair Queen of the West: distinguished for order, enterprise, public spirit, and liberality, she stands the wonder of an admiring world.\\" It was published in the Cincinnati Advertiser and the Inquisitor. The following year the city's residents were call it The Queen of the West or The Queen City. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote of the vineyards in Cincinnati of Nicholas Longworth in the last stanza of his poem Catawba Wine in 1854: ::And this Song of the Vine, ::This greeting of mine, ::The winds and the birds shall deliver, ::To the Queen of the West, ::In her garlands dressed, ::On the banks of the Beautiful River. The nickname \\"Porkopolis\\" was first published about 1840, but had its beginning in 1825 when banker George W. Jones, who had often talked of the number of hogs roaming the streets for slaughter, received a paper mache pig and was dubbed to have been from Porkopolis. In 1840, there was more than $3 million of packed pork produced by 1,200 men in 48 packing houses in Cincinnati. Twenty years later, there were twice the number of men involved in the business. Chicago became the major meat packing center of pigs and took over the nickname by 1875. Cincinnati also is known as the \\"City of Seven Hills\\". The hills form a crescent from the east bank of the Ohio River to the west bank: Mount Adams, Walnut Hills, Mount Auburn, Vine Street Hill, College Hill, Fairmount, and Mount Harrison. Civil War During the American Civil War, many people in the area were \\"Southern sympathizers\\" due to Cincinnati's commerce with slave states and history of settlement by southerners from eastern states. Of the people who served in the military, most enlisted with the Union Army, but a large number who served for the Confederates. Some residents participated in the Copperhead movement in Ohio. Cincinnati played a key role as a major source of supplies and troops for the Union Army; It also provided housing for soldiers and their families, both of which were good for the city's economy. The United States Christian Commission, United States Sanitary Commission, and other charities came to the area to assist soldiers and their families. It served as the headquarters for much of the war for the Department of the Ohio, which was charged with the defense of the region, as well as directing the army's offensive into Kentucky and Tennessee. In July 1863, the Union Army instituted martial law in Cincinnati due to the imminent danger posed by the Confederate Morgan's Raiders. Bringing the war to the North, they attacked several outlying villages, such as Cheviot and Montgomery. A mural depicting the \\"Squirrel Hunters\\", local militia from Ohio, marching in Defense of Cincinnati (1862). During the American Civil War, an eight-mile line of defense was built by Cincinnatians along the Ohio River to protect the city. One of the batteries, Battery Hooper, became the site of the James A. Ramage Civil War Museum in Fort Wright, Kentucky. Due to the efforts of the Black Brigade of Cincinnati and the Defense of Cincinnati, forces established to defend Cincinnati did not need to fire a shot during the Civil War. Post Civil War and late 19th century history City of Cincinnati, 1872, a steel engraving by A. C. Warren With nearly 300,000 people, it was the state's largest city, and it was the country's densest population with an average of 37,143 people per square mile. The city had an art academy, art museum, Music Hall, opera house, Exposition Building, and a public library. There were about 130 magazines and newspapers produced in the city. There were more than 200 churches, five hospitals, and college education attainable through University of Cincinnati. In 1888, Cincinnati German Protestants community started a \\"sick house\\" (\\"Krankenhaus\\") staffed by deaconesses. It evolved into the city's first general hospital, and included nurses' training school. It was renamed Deaconess Hospital in 1917.Ellen Corwin Cangi, \\"Krankenhaus, Culture and Community: The Deaconess Hospital of Cincinnati, Ohio, 1888-1920,\\" Queen City Heritage (1990) 48#2 pp 3-14 Thirteen governors for the state of Ohio came from Cincinnati: Charles Anderson, Richard M. Bishop, John Brough, Ethan Allen Brown, Salmon P. Chase, Jacob Cox, William Dennison Jr., Joseph B. Foraker, Rutherford B. Hayes, George Hoadly, Othniel Looker, Edward Noyes, and Thomas L. Young. =Sports= The Cincinnati Red Stockings, a baseball team whose name and heritage inspired today's Cincinnati Reds, began their career in the 19th century as well. In 1868, meetings were held at the law offices of Tilden, Sherman, and Moulton to make Cincinnati's baseball team a professional one; it became the first regular professional team in the country in 1869. In its first year, the team won 57 games and tied one, giving it the best winning record of any professional baseball team in history. =Commerce= In 1879, Procter & Gamble, one of Cincinnati's major soap manufacturers, began marketing Ivory Soap. It was marketed as \\"light enough to float.\\" After a fire at the first factory, Procter & Gamble moved to a new factory on the Mill Creek and renewed soap production. The area became known as Ivorydale.Writers' Program, Cincinnati: A Guide to the Queen City and its Neighbors, Washington, D.C.: Works Project Administration Cincinnati was the first municipality to own a railroad, the Cincinnati Southern in 1880. In 1887, industries in Cincinnati produced more than 200 million dollars in goods and employed 103,325 people. It had become \\"an important industrial, political, literary, and educational center in both Ohio and the United States\\" by 1890. By the end of the 19th century, its leading industries were iron production, woodworking, cloth production, and meatpacking. Cincinnati had a monopoly in the late 19th century because local manufacturers were able to build inexpensive carriages that opened the market to a larger pool of potential customers, such as farmers who would otherwise use a farm wagon for pleasure travel but were able to afford the inexpensive carriages. 20th and 21st century The city's population did not increase much over the 20th century. In the 1880s there were 300,000 people and in 2000 there were 365,000 people living within 77 square miles. But, there are more than 1.8 million people living in Cincinnati's suburbs. Within the greater Cincinnati area, there are more than 100 art galleries, including the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati Art Museum, and Taft Museum of Art. The city's theaters include Aronoff Center for the Arts, the Playhouse in the Park, the Showboat Majestic, the Emery Theatre, the Taft Theatre, and the University of Cincinnati ‚Äì College-Conservatory of Music. The city also has the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. =World War I= Liberty Bond poster, 1917. During World War I (1914‚Äì1918), 25,000 men from Cincinnati served in the military. Cincinnati's citizens and children found many ways to support the war effort, such as \\"adopting\\" 1,200 fatherless French children, collecting tin foil, planting war gardens, establishing home guards to pick up local responsibilities by the militia, rolling bandages and knitting tens of thousands of articles of clothing. The Cincinnati Training Battalion was established so that men that expected to be drafted could get a head start on training. Jewish men beyond draft age prepared to serve in Palestine. Local plants retrofitted their factories to produce items required by the war or increased production to turn out needed supplies. As a result, Cincinnati turned out munitions, camping equipment for soldiers, battleship parts, clothing and food for soldiers, and other necessary goods. Millions of dollars were raised for Liberty Loans; relief funds for Armenia, Belgium and France, the Red Cross; thrift stamps; and the YMCA. Women took positions formerly held by men and African-Americans moved to Cincinnati from the South. Doctor Ernst Kunwald, former conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, entering the Federal Building, Cincinnati, Ohio, as a prisoner of war Anti- German sentiment raised to a fevered pitch, though, during the war. Rumors were spread about German-American businesses. The conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Ernst Kunwald, was interned under the Alien and Sedition Acts. Professor Emil Heerman, the concertmeister, was released into the custody of the Conservatory of Music after he was arrested; He invested 75% of his income in Liberty Bonds, which helped restore much of his reputation. The city's library removed pro-German books and the public schools discontinued German language classes. =World War II= Women made 37mm antitank shells for the war in 1942 at Aluminum Industries, Inc. in Cincinnati. Due to isolationism and disillusion that the world was not \\"safe for democracy\\" after World War I, many people were initially reluctant to become involved in World War II (1939‚Äì1945) until the attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941). Others, though, had seen for a while that it is the best interest of the United States to become in the war. Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, said \\"My first feeling was of relief that the indecision was over and that a crisis had come in a way which would unite all our people.\\" During the war, the regional draft boards registered 81,000 men in October 1940. Volunteers and those who were drafted reported to Fort Thomas in Kentucky. Almost 100,000 men and women from the area served in the war. Women served in support roles, like radio operator and driver. African-Americans served in segregated units, like the 93rd Infantry Division. The war provided opportunities for blacks and women to progress in ways that they were unable to before the war. For instance, generally the workforce was made up of single women. During the war, women were needed in military positions and in civilian positions to staff the production effort. More black men were accepted into the military to meet manpower needs or worked in plants. People from the area also served in the diplomatic corps or in federal agencies. In Cincinnati, 2,000 manufacturers, with more than 180,000 employees, rallied to provide goods required by the military. The largest subcontractor, Wright Aeronautical Corporation, produced engines for military planes. The war effort required goods like food, soap, clothing, glycerine-some of which required some modification to meet the military's needs, such as ties made out of khaki-colored material. Some completely changed the products they produced, like switching from making women's clothing to producing parachutes. Tank turrets and armor plates were made by Mosler Safe, a metal working plant. Cincinnati was positioned with a number of options for transporting raw materials and goods, including the railroad through Union Terminal, barges on the Ohio River, airplanes at Lunken Field. As in World War I, Cincinnatians rallied to support the war. They planted victory gardens, organized bond drives, bought bonds, and retooled factories. Goods were collected that were needed for the war, such as rubber and various types of scrap metal (e.g., copper, iron, etc.). There were also conservation efforts that helped ensure that necessary goods were available to meet the military's needs. Local boards issued ration books for scarce consumable products, like butter, meat, sugar, coffee, gasoline, and tires. A defense council was established in May 1941 to plan for civilian protection and was lead by Phillip O. Geier, the president of the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce. =Modern urban development= In 1902, the world's first reinforced concrete skyscraper was built, the Ingalls Building. After World War II, Cincinnati unveiled a master plan for urban renewal that resulted in modernization of the inner city. Since the 1950s, $250 million was spent on improving neighborhoods, building clean and safe low- and moderate-income housing, provide jobs and stimulate economic growth. Cincinnati skyline, 2005. This view is from the Southwest, from Devou Park in Covington. Near the center of the skyline is the 49-story Carew Tower. The City of Cincinnati and Hamilton County developed the Banks - an urban neighborhood along the city's riverfront including restaurants, clubs, offices, and homes with skyline views. Groundbreaking took place on April 2, 2008. Adjacent is Smale Riverfront Park, a \\"front porch\\" to Ohio. A 3.6-mile streetcar line running through downtown and Over the Rhine was completed in 2015 and called the Cincinnati Bell Connector. =Commerce= American Financial Group, Cinergy, Kroger, Macy's, Inc., Procter & Gamble, E. W. Scripps Company, and Totes Isotoner are among the corporations that have their regional or national headquarters in the city. =Sports= Riverfront Stadium In 1935, major league baseball's first night game was played at Crosley Field. In 1970 and 1975, the city completed Riverfront Stadium and Riverfront Coliseum, respectively, as the Cincinnati Reds baseball team emerged as one of the dominant teams of the decade. In fact, the Big Red Machine of 1975 and 1976 is considered by many to be one of the best baseball teams to ever play the game. Three key players on the team (Johnny Bench, Tony P√©rez, and Joe Morgan), as well as manager Sparky Anderson, were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, while a fourth, Pete Rose, still holds the title for the most hits (4,256), singles (3,215), games played (3,562), games played in which his team won (1,971), at-bats (14,053) and outs (10,328) in baseball history. The Cincinnati Bengals football team of the NFL was founded in 1968 by legendary coach Paul Brown. The team appeared in the 1981 and 1988 Super Bowls. FC Cincinnati, Cincinnati's professional soccer team, was founded in 2015 as a member of the United Soccer League, now known as the USL Championship, and played its first season in 2016. During tis three seasons in a division II league, the club received international recognition for its consistent record- breaking attendance numbers and historic 2017 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup run. The team's ownership group was granted a Major League Soccer franchise that started play under the FC Cincinnati name in 2019; the USL team accordingly ceased operations after the 2018 season. =Boy Scouts= \\"The Sons of Daniel Boone\\", a forerunner to the Boy Scouts of America, began in Cincinnati in 1905. Because of the city's rich German heritage, the pre-prohibition era allowed Cincinnati to become a national forerunner in the brewing industry. =Media= During experimentation for six years (until 1939), Cincinnati's AM radio station, WLW was the first to broadcast at 500,000 watts. In 1943, King Records (and its subsidiary, Queen Records) was founded, and went on to record early music by artists who became highly successful and influential in Country, R&B;, and Rock. WCET-TV was the first licensed public television station, established in 1954. Cincinnati is home to radio's WEBN 102.7 FM, the longest-running album-oriented rock station in the United States, first airing in 1967. In 1976, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange became the nation's first all- electronic trading market. =Race relations= There have been many incidents of race-based violence before and after the Civil War with the most notable and most recent one being the 2001 Cincinnati Riots. =Disasters= Cincinnati has experienced multiple floods in its history. The largest being the Ohio River flood of 1937 where the hydrograph measured a river depth of 80 feet‚Äî55 feet above normal levels. On December 3, 1979, 11 persons were killed in a crowd crush at the entrance of Riverfront Coliseum for a rock concert by the British band The Who. The Cincinnati Area F5 tornado - photo taken near Bridgetown Being in the Midwest, Cincinnati has also experienced several violent tornadoes. Of the 1974 Super Outbreak tornadoes, a F5 crossed the Ohio River from northern Kentucky into Sayler Park, the westernmost portion of the city along the Ohio River. The tornado then continued north into the suburbs of Mack, Bridgetown and Dent before weakening. The parent thunderstorm went on to produce another violet F4 that touched down in Elmwood Place and Arlington Heights before leaving the city limits and tracking toward Mason, Ohio. Three people lost their lives, while over another 100 were injured in both of these tornadoes. In the early morning hours of 9 April 1999, another violent tornado grazed the Cincinnati Metro, in the suburb of Blue Ash. It was rated an F4 killing 4 residents.

Analysis The molecular structure of asphaltenes is difficult to determine because the molecules tend to stick together in solution. These materials are extremely complex mixtures containing hundreds or even thousands of individual chemical species. Asphaltenes do not have a specific chemical formula: individual molecules can vary in the number of atoms contained in the structure, and the average chemical formula can depend on the source. Although they have been subjected to modern analytical methods, including the well known SARA analysis by TLC-FID SARA Method, mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance, the exact molecular structures are difficult to determine. Given this limitation, asphaltenes are composed mainly of polyaromatic carbon ring units with oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur heteroatoms, combined with trace amounts of heavy metals, particularly chelated vanadium and nickel, and aliphatic side chains of various lengths.Asomaning, S. (1997). Heat exchanger fouling by petroleum asphaltenes. Ph.D. Thesis, University of British Columbia Many asphaltenes from crude oils around the world contain similar ring units, as well as polar and non-polar groups, which are linked together to make highly diverse large molecules.G.A. Mansoori, (2009). Int. J. Oil, Gas and Coal Technology 2 141. Asphaltene after heatingJ.H.

SpeightJ.G. Speight, (1994). in the book Asphaltenes and Asphalts, 1, Developments in Petroleum Science, 40 edited by Yen T. F. and G. V. Chilingarian, (Elsevier Science, New York ). Chapter: Chemical and physical studies of petroleum asphaltenes reports a simplified representation of the separation of petroleum into the following six major fractions: volatile saturates, volatile aromatics, nonvolatile saturates, nonvolatile aromatics, resins and asphaltenes. He also reports arbitrarily defined physical boundaries for petroleum using carbon-number and boiling point. Geochemistry Asphaltenes are today widely recognised as dispersed, chemically altered fragments of kerogen, which migrated out of the source rock for the oil, during oil catagenesis. Asphaltenes had been thought to be held in solution in oil by resins (similar structure and chemistry, but smaller), but recent data shows that this is incorrect. Indeed, it has recently been suggested that asphaltenes are nanocolloidally suspended in crude oil and in toluene solutions of sufficient concentrations. In any event, for low surface tension liquids, such as alkanes and toluene, surfactants are not necessary to maintain nanocolloidal suspensions of asphaltenes. The nickel to vanadium ratio of asphaltenes reflect the pH and Eh conditions of the paleo- depositional environment of the source rock for oil (Lewan, 1980;1984), and this ratio is, therefore, in use in the petroleum industry for oil-oil correlation and for identification of potential source rocks for oil (oil exploration). Occurrence Heavy oils, oil sands, bitumen and biodegraded oils (as bacteria cannot assimilate asphaltenes, but readily consume saturated hydrocarbons and certain aromatic hydrocarbon isomers ‚Äì enzymatically controlled) contain much higher proportions of asphaltenes than do medium-API oils or light oils. Condensates are virtually devoid of asphaltenes. Measurement Because the ratio of electron spins per gram is constant for a particular species of asphaltene then the quantity of asphaltene in an oil can be determined by measuring its paramagnetic signature (EPR). Measuring the EPR signature of the oil at the wellhead as the oil is produced then gives a direct indication of whether the amount of asphaltene is changing (e.g. because of precipitation or sloughing in the tubing below). In addition, asphaltene aggregation, precipitation or deposition can sometimes be predicted by modeling or machine learning methods and can be measured in the laboratory using imaging methods or filtration. Production problems Asphaltenes impart high viscosity to crude oils, negatively impacting production, also the variable asphaltene concentration in crude oils within individual reservoirs creates a myriad of production problems. Heat exchanger fouling Asphaltenes are known to be one of the largest causes of fouling in the heat exchangers of the crude oil distillation preheat train. They are present within micelles in crude oil, which can be broken down by reaction with paraffins under high temperature. Once the protective micelle has been removed polar asphaltenes agglomerate and are transported to the tube walls, where they can stick and form a foulant layer. Asphaltene removal Chemical treatments for removing asphaltene include: # Solvents # Dispersants/solvents # Oil/dispersants/solvents The dispersant/solvent approach is used for removing asphaltenes from formation minerals. Continuous treating may be required to inhibit asphaltene deposition in the tubing. Batch treatments are common for dehydration equipment and tank bottoms. There are also asphaltene precipitation inhibitors that can be used by continuous treatment or squeeze treatments.Understanding paraffin and asphaltene problems in oil and gas wells , Petroleum Technology Transfer Council, South Midcontinent Region, July 16, 2003 Workshop in Smackover, Arkansas at the Arkansas Natural Resources Museum See also * Tholin References External links *An in-depth article on asphaltenes from OilfieldWiki.com, the oilfield encyclopedia *Article regarding asphaltene fouling by Irwin A.

Design and development The K 8 was derived from the earlier Ka 6 design as a simple single-place sailplane with air brakes using construction techniques similar to the Schleicher K 7, simplified for amateur construction from kits. Emphasis was on rugged construction, good climbing ability in thermals and good handling characteristics. The prototype K 8 made its first flight in November 1957 and over 1,100 were built in three main versions. The original K 8 had a very small canopy. Side windows for improved visibility were introduced in the next version, and the K 8B, by far the most numerous variant, has a larger one-piece blown Plexiglas canopy. The K 8C features a longer nose, larger main wheel located ahead of the center of gravity and deletion of the larger wooden nose skid resulting in a roomier cockpit. The cantilever high wings are single-spar structures of pine and plywood, with a plywood leading edge torsion box and fabric covering aft of the spar; the forward sweep is 1¬∞ 18' and dihedral is 3¬∞. There are Schempp-Hirth air brakes in the upper and lower surfaces and the wooden ailerons are plywood covered. The cantilever tail unit is of similar construction to the wings, with ply- covered fixed surfaces and fabric-covered rudder and elevators, and a trim tab in the elevator is an optional fitting. The fuselage is a welded steel-tube structure, with fabric covering over spruce longerons and a glass fibre nose cone. There is a non-retractable and unsprung monowheel, with optional brake, and a nose skid mounted on rubber blocks in front of it, plus a steel skid at the tail. Operational history Karl Striedieck of the United States made a 767 km / 476.6 mile ridge flight in a K 8B to establish a world out-and-return record in 1968. Motor glider variants A motor glider conversion of the K 8B was developed by LVD (the Flying Training School of the Detmold Aero Club) similar to their conversion of a Scheibe Bergfalke IV known as the BF IV-BIMO, in which a Lloyd LS-400 piston engine mounted in the fuselage drives a pair of small two-blade pusher propellers rotating within cutouts in each wing near the trailing edge. Another motorglider conversion was used by \\"Vestjysk Sv√¶veflyveklub\\" in Denmark: it had a small Wankel rotary engine mounted in a nacelle on an aluminium stick above the main spar. The engine was started with a recoil starter like a lawn mower. The high RPM of the device made it extremely unpopular: the propeller tips created a permanent sonic boom, that made the plane extremely noisy. The harassed citizens of Esbjerg nicknamed the plane 'the flying circular saw' and the engine was removed.

In mathematics, the discriminant of an algebraic number field is a numerical invariant that, loosely speaking, measures the size of the (ring of integers of the) algebraic number field. More specifically, it is proportional to the squared volume of the fundamental domain of the ring of integers, and it regulates which primes are ramified. The discriminant is one of the most basic invariants of a number field, and occurs in several important analytic formulas such as the functional equation of the Dedekind zeta function of K, and the analytic class number formula for K. A theorem of Hermite states that there are only finitely many number fields of bounded discriminant, however determining this quantity is still an open problem, and the subject of current research. The discriminant of K can be referred to as the absolute discriminant of K to distinguish it from the relative discriminant of an extension K/L of number fields. The latter is an ideal in the ring of integers of L, and like the absolute discriminant it indicates which primes are ramified in K/L. It is a generalization of the absolute discriminant allowing for L to be bigger than Q; in fact, when L = Q, the relative discriminant of K/Q is the principal ideal of Z generated by the absolute discriminant of K. Definition Let K be an algebraic number field, and let OK be its ring of integers. Let b1, ..., bn be an integral basis of OK (i.e. a basis as a Z-module), and let {œÉ1, ..., œÉn} be the set of embeddings of K into the complex numbers (i.e. injective ring homomorphisms K ‚Üí C). The discriminant of K is the square of the determinant of the n by n matrix B whose (i,j)-entry is œÉi(bj). Symbolically, :\\\\Delta_K=\\\\det\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cccc} \\\\sigma_1(b_1) & \\\\sigma_1(b_2) &\\\\cdots & \\\\sigma_1(b_n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_2(b_1) & \\\\ddots & & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_n(b_1) & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\sigma_n(b_n) \\\\end{array}\\\\right)^2. Equivalently, the trace from K to Q can be used. Specifically, define the trace form to be the matrix whose (i,j)-entry is TrK/Q(bibj). This matrix equals BTB, so the discriminant of K is the determinant of this matrix. Examples *Quadratic number fields: let d be a square-free integer, then the discriminant of K=\\\\mathbf{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d}) is :: \\\\Delta_K=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{ll} d &\\\\text{if }d\\\\equiv 1\\\\pmod 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4d &\\\\text{if }d\\\\equiv 2,3\\\\pmod 4. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\end{array}\\\\right. :An integer that occurs as the discriminant of a quadratic number field is called a fundamental discriminant.Definition 5.1.2 of *Cyclotomic fields: let n > 2 be an integer, let Œ∂n be a primitive nth root of unity, and let Kn = Q(Œ∂n) be the nth cyclotomic field. The discriminant of Kn is given byProposition 2.7 of :: \\\\Delta_{K_n} = (-1)^{\\\\varphi(n)/2} \\\\frac{n^{\\\\varphi(n)}}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{pn} p^{\\\\varphi(n)/(p-1)}} : where \\\\varphi(n) is Euler's totient function, and the product in the denominator is over primes p dividing n. *Power bases: In the case where the ring of integers has a power integral basis, that is, can be written as OK = Z[Œ±], the discriminant of K is equal to the discriminant of the minimal polynomial of Œ±. To see this, one can choose the integral basis of OK to be b1 = 1, b2 = Œ±, b3 = Œ±2, ..., bn = Œ±n‚àí1. Then, the matrix in the definition is the Vandermonde matrix associated to Œ±i = œÉi(Œ±), whose determinant squared is :: \\\\prod_{1\\\\leq i :which is exactly the definition of the discriminant of the minimal polynomial. *Let K = Q(Œ±) be the number field obtained by adjoining a root Œ± of the polynomial x3 ‚àí x2 ‚àí 2x ‚àí 8\\\\. This is Richard Dedekind's original example of a number field whose ring of integers does not possess a power basis. An integral basis is given by {1, Œ±, Œ±(Œ± + 1)/2} and the discriminant of K is ‚àí503., pp. 30‚Äì31, p. 64 *Repeated discriminants: the discriminant of a quadratic field uniquely identifies it, but this is not true, in general, for higher-degree number fields. For example, there are two non-isomorphic cubic fields of discriminant 3969. They are obtained by adjoining a root of the polynomial or , respectively. Basic results *Brill's theorem: The sign of the discriminant is (‚àí1)r2 where r2 is the number of complex places of K.Lemma 2.2 of *A prime p ramifies in K if and only if p divides ŒîK .Corollary III.2.12 of *Stickelberger's theorem:Exercise I.2.7 of :: \\\\Delta_K\\\\equiv 0\\\\text{ or }1 \\\\pmod 4. *Minkowski's bound:Proposition III.2.14 of Let n denote the degree of the extension K/Q and r2 the number of complex places of K, then :: \\\\Delta_K^{1/2}\\\\geq \\\\frac{n^n}{n!}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)^{r_2} \\\\geq \\\\frac{n^n}{n!}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)^{n/2}. *Minkowski's theorem:Theorem III.2.17 of If K is not Q, then ŒîK > 1 (this follows directly from the Minkowski bound). *Hermite‚ÄìMinkowski theorem:Theorem III.2.16 of Let N be a positive integer. There are only finitely many (up to isomorphisms) algebraic number fields K with ŒîK < N. Again, this follows from the Minkowski bound together with Hermite's theorem (that there are only finitely many algebraic number fields with prescribed discriminant). History Richard Dedekind showed that every number field possesses an integral basis, allowing him to define the discriminant of an arbitrary number field.Dedekind's supplement X of the second edition of Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet's Vorlesungen √ºber Zahlentheorie The definition of the discriminant of a general algebraic number field, K, was given by Dedekind in 1871. At this point, he already knew the relationship between the discriminant and ramification. Hermite's theorem predates the general definition of the discriminant with Charles Hermite publishing a proof of it in 1857. In 1877, Alexander von Brill determined the sign of the discriminant. Leopold Kronecker first stated Minkowski's theorem in 1882, though the first proof was given by Hermann Minkowski in 1891. In the same year, Minkowski published his bound on the discriminant. Near the end of the nineteenth century, Ludwig Stickelberger obtained his theorem on the residue of the discriminant modulo four.All facts in this paragraph can be found in Relative discriminant The discriminant defined above is sometimes referred to as the absolute discriminant of K to distinguish it from the relative discriminant ŒîK/L of an extension of number fields K/L, which is an ideal in OL. The relative discriminant is defined in a fashion similar to the absolute discriminant, but must take into account that ideals in OL may not be principal and that there may not be an OL basis of OK. Let {œÉ1, ..., œÉn} be the set of embeddings of K into C which are the identity on L. If b1, ..., bn is any basis of K over L, let d(b1, ..., bn) be the square of the determinant of the n by n matrix whose (i,j)-entry is œÉi(bj). Then, the relative discriminant of K/L is the ideal generated by the d(b1, ..., bn) as {b1, ..., bn} varies over all integral bases of K/L. (i.e. bases with the property that bi ‚àà OK for all i.) Alternatively, the relative discriminant of K/L is the norm of the different of K/L. When L = Q, the relative discriminant ŒîK/Q is the principal ideal of Z generated by the absolute discriminant ŒîK . In a tower of fields K/L/F the relative discriminants are related by :\\\\Delta_{K/F} = \\\\mathcal{N}_{L/F}\\\\left({\\\\Delta_{K/L}}\\\\right) \\\\Delta_{L/F}^{[K:L]} where \\\\mathcal{N} denotes relative norm.Corollary III.2.10 of or Proposition III.2.15 of =Ramification= The relative discriminant regulates the ramification data of the field extension K/L. A prime ideal p of L ramifies in K if, and only if, it divides the relative discriminant ŒîK/L. An extension is unramified if, and only if, the discriminant is the unit ideal. The Minkowski bound above shows that there are no non-trivial unramified extensions of Q. Fields larger than Q may have unramified extensions: for example, for any field with class number greater than one, its Hilbert class field is a non- trivial unramified extension. Root discriminant The root discriminant of a number field, K, of degree n, often denoted rdK, is defined as the n-th root of the absolute value of the (absolute) discriminant of K. The relation between relative discriminants in a tower of fields shows that the root discriminant does not change in an unramified extension. The existence of a class field tower provides bounds on the root discriminant: the existence of an infinite class field tower over Q() where m = 3¬∑5¬∑7¬∑11¬∑19 shows that there are infinitely many fields with root discriminant 2 ‚âà 296.276. If we let r and 2s be the number of real and complex embeddings, so that n = r + 2s, put œÅ = r/n and œÉ = 2s/n. Set Œ±(œÅ, œÉ) to be the infimum of rdK for K with (r', 2s') = (œÅn, œÉn). We have (for all n large enough) : \\\\alpha(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma) \\\\ge 60.8^\\\\rho 22.3^\\\\sigma and on the assumption of the generalized Riemann hypothesis : \\\\alpha(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma) \\\\ge 215.3^\\\\rho 44.7^\\\\sigma . So we have Œ±(0,1) < 296.276. Martinet has shown Œ±(0,1) < 93 and Œ±(1,0) < 1059. proves that for totally real fields, the root discriminant is > 14, with 1229 exceptions. Relation to other quantities *When embedded into K\\\\otimes_\\\\mathbf{Q}\\\\mathbf{R}, the volume of the fundamental domain of OK is \\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta_K} (sometimes a different measure is used and the volume obtained is 2^{-r_2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta_K}, where r2 is the number of complex places of K). *Due to its appearance in this volume, the discriminant also appears in the functional equation of the Dedekind zeta function of K, and hence in the analytic class number formula, and the Brauer‚ÄìSiegel theorem. *The relative discriminant of K/L is the Artin conductor of the regular representation of the Galois group of K/L. This provides a relation to the Artin conductors of the characters of the Galois group of K/L, called the conductor-discriminant formula.Section 4.4 of Notes References =Primary sources=   * * =Secondary sources=    * Further reading * Category:Algebraic number theory ","title":"Discriminant of an algebraic number field"},{"id":"3022977","text":"Polaris Fashion Place is a two level shopping mall and surrounding retail plaza serving Columbus, Ohio, United States. The mall, owned locally by Washington Prime Group, is located off Interstate 71 on Polaris Parkway in Delaware County just to the north of the boundary between Delaware and Franklin County. The mall features seven anchor stores: H&M;, JCPenney, Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Von Maur, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Field & Stream, as well as an outdoor promenade which includes Forever 21 and Barnes & Noble. The mall is part of the much larger 1200 acre POLARIS Centers of Commerce real estate development in northern Columbus. This development includes the McCoy Center, the Polaris Founder's Park along with over a hundred other commercial and residential developments. History Glimcher Realty Trust began construction on Polaris Fashion Place in June 2000. The mall opened in November 2001 with 146 inline tenants. The developers chose to include several tenants which were lacking in the market, including four of the seven anchor stores: Kaufmann's, The Great Indoors, Lord & Taylor (whose store was the only location in Ohio) and Saks Fifth Avenue. The other three anchors were J.C. Penney, Sears and Lazarus; all three relocated from Northland Mall, which closed on October 31, 2002 following the loss of its remaining inline tenants and the Northland Mall was demolished in February 2004. In 2003, the Lazarus store was dual-branded as Lazarus-Macy's, and then to just Macy's in 2005. After the 2006 acquisition by Federated Stores (now Macy's, Inc.) of Kaufmann's parent company, May Corporation, the Kaufmann's store was shuttered and sold to Glimcher for redevelopment. In 2007, the store was demolished for an outdoor expansion comprising Barnes & Noble, Forever 21 and several restaurants, including Benihana, The Cheesecake Factory and Dave & Buster's. This concourse opened in 2008. Lord & Taylor closed in 2004 and was replaced a year later with Von Maur, whose location at the mall is also the first in the state. On February 22, 2012, Sears Holdings Corporation announced it would be closing all 9 of its Great Indoors stores as the part of extensive restructuring plan, including the Polaris Fashion Place location.

The character most often appears in X-Men stories in the Marvel Universe. Sharon first appeared in New Mutants vol. 1 #19 (1984). She was created by Chris Claremont and Bill Sienkiewicz. Her last appearance was in Uncanny X-Men #298 (March 1993). Fictional character biography Sharon's first meeting with mutants associated with the X-Men, was when the New Mutants brought in Dani Moonstar to the Mid-County Medical Center. Sharon was employed in the emergency room as a nurse. A short time later, Sharon and police officer Tom Corsi were abducted by a creature called the Demon Bear, who had mauled Dani Moonstar during a battle outside the Xavier Institute earlier that night. The Demon Bear attempted to transform Friedlander and Corsi into his demonic slaves. After the New Mutants defeated the bear, Tom and Sharon were returned to their natural human form, with a couple of physical changes: the two of them acquired features similar to Native Americans (previously they were both White Americans), along with being enhanced to the level of being perfect human specimens. After her initial encounter with the New Mutants, Sharon joined the staff at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, as a nurse and confidante. She stayed in the capacity of a nurse for a while. Sharon and Tom Corsi had a brief romantic interest in each other, which was later used against them by Empath, one of the Hellions. Empath used his power over human emotions to make their romantic feelings into obsessive ones, distracting them while he manipulated Magneto into a deep depression. At this time, Magneto was assuming duties as headmaster of Xavier's school and guardianship over the New Mutants. While Magneto was still vulnerable, Emma Frost transferred the New Mutants to her school. Sharon stayed on at Xavier's School for some time, until the New Mutants found themselves in Asgard; Sharon and Tom appeared less frequently in the X-titles by then. Eventually, Sharon was a resident of Muir Island with Moira MacTaggert. Fantastic Four Vs. X-Men #2 (March, 1987) In her last appearance, some time later, Sharon made herself a quiet life. She was at a school for the handicapped, called Our Mother of the Sacred Heart. The school found itself under attack by a new of group of Acolytes. These villains mistakenly though a powerful mutant child was attending the school. Sharon was killed by the Acolyte Joanna Cargill when she was struck in the jaw thus snapping her neck in the process. Her final act was to send a mental call for help to Professor X.\\"Uncanny X-Men\\" #298 (March, 1993) Powers and abilities Sharon had minor increased strength due to her transformation by the Demon Bear as well as minor increased speed and reflexes.

They are known for their controversial song \\"Jesus\\" (aka \\"Jesus Entering from the Rear\\"), which was featured on Alternative Tentacles' infamous Let Them Eat Jellybeans compilation, and for their provocative album covers. The Feederz have strong Situationist tendencies, verging into communism and anarchism. Their songs were highly critical of government, consumerism and religion. Lead singer Frank Discussion is also known for his \\"subvertisements\\" or \\"derailments\\", an adaptation of the situationist tactic of detournement, as well as what he calls \\"interventions\\" whereby one detournes physical events by intervening with an out-of-place element in the physical world, a tactic expressed as simply as placing disparate items in unsuspecting people's shopping carts, thereby raising the action beyond the level of mere prank to a conscious tactic used to undermine society and to express a unified critique of it. He is also known for being one of the developers of \\"antistasiology\\", defined as the comparative study of various types of tactics, strategies and organizational structures used by various resistance movements, historically and currently.  History  Discussion and Clear Bob (Dan Clark) formed the Feederz in 1977. Art Nouveau (John Vivier) later joined as a drummer. Before performing publicly, the Feederz issued a press release that the local media mistook as a terrorist communique. At their first show, Discussion caused a panic by firing blanks from an AR-15 rifle into the audience. In 1980, the band released their first recording, the four-song EP Jesus. In 1982, Discussion wrote \\"Bored with School\\", a diatribe against school and work posing as an announcement from the Arizona Department of Education, and distributed 5,000 copies to local high schools. He fled Arizona to escape arrest for this incident and settled in San Francisco. Clark later recorded with Eddy Detroit and Victory Acres/Joke Flower. The Jesus EP was reissued in 1983 by Placebo Records. In 1984, Discussion reformed Feederz with Mark Roderick (credited as \\"Mark Edible\\") and D.H. Peligro (as \\"Darrin Henley\\"), with whom he recorded Ever Feel Like Killing Your Boss?. In Situationist style, the album sleeve was covered in sandpaper. In 1986, Teachers in Space was released, with Jayed Scotti replacing Peligro on drums. Scotti, a partner of Winston Smith, created album art for bands such as the Dead Kennedys, MDC and Crucifucks. The cover of Teachers in Space featured a photo of the Challenger disaster. Later in the decade, Discussion again disbanded the Feederz, but by then their orbit of influence had expanded, including Kurt Cobain among their fans. A fan's post to the Nirvana newsgroup, alt.music.nirvana, revealed that Cobain had taken a bumper sticker from the Feederz' Teachers in Space LP and stuck it on his all-black Fender Stratocaster, made famous at the 1991 Reading Festival in England, where Nirvana performed with Sonic Youth. The sticker read: \\"Vandalism: Beautiful as a rock in a cop's face\\". In small type underneath were these words: \\"Courtesy of Feederz: Office of Anti-Public Relations\\". (This bumper sticker message would become the title of Feederz' comeback release more than a decade later.) Cobain's use of this guitar in the 1991: The Year Punk Broke film later that year indirectly lent even more exposure to the Feederz (until Cobain smashed it into pieces at a Paris show the following spring). Feederz reformed in 2002 and released Vandalism: Beautiful as a Rock in a Cop's Face, engineered by Jack Endino. This lineup included Ben Wah on drums and Denmark Vesey on bass, both from Seattle. They toured throughout 2003. Discussion and Wah both relocated to Los Angeles in 2003-2004, and continued the band, playing with bassist Brant Boling, until 2007, when they played their last show at Mondo- Video-A-Go-Go. In 2017, Feederz once again reformed, with Discussion joined by early members Clark and Peligro. The trio recorded four songs with producer Cris Kirkwood of Meat Puppets, two of which were released by Slope Records on April 15 as the WWHD: What Would Hitler Do? EP.

She longed for home and wrote of a happier time, unspecified in the novel apart from a reference to living in the 1930s. Smith was already an established playwright and later became famous for writing the children's classic The Hundred and One Dalmatians. The novel relates the adventures of an eccentric family, the Mortmains, struggling to live in genteel poverty in a decaying castle during the 1930s. The first person narrator is Cassandra Mortmain, an intelligent teenager who tells the story through her journal. It is a coming- of-age story in which Cassandra passes from being a girl at the beginning to being a young woman at the end. In 2003 the novel was listed at number 82 in the BBC's survey The Big Read.\\"The Big Read\\". BBC. April 2003, retrieved 26 October 2012  Plot  The novel takes place between April and October in a single year in the 1930s. The Mortmain family is genteel, poor, and eccentric. Cassandra's father is a writer suffering from writer's block who has not published anything since his first book, Jacob Wrestling (a reference to Jacob wrestling with the angel), an innovative and \\"difficult\\" modernist novel that sold well and made his name, including in the United States. Ten years before the novel begins he took out a forty-year lease on a dilapidated but beautiful castle, hoping to find either inspiration or isolation there. Now his family is selling off the furniture to buy food. The widowed Mortmain's second wife, Topaz, is a beautiful artist's model who enjoys communing with nature, sometimes wearing nothing but hip boots. Rose, Mortmain's elder daughter, is a classic English beauty pining away in the lonely castle, longing for a chance to meet eligible and preferably rich young men. She tells her sister Cassandra that she wants to live in a Jane Austen novel. Cassandra, the younger daughter and the first-person narrator of the novel, has literary ambitions and spends a lot of time developing her writing talent by \\"capturing\\" everything around her in her journal. Stephen, the handsome, loyal, live-in son of the Mortmain late maid, and Thomas, the youngest Mortmain child, round out the cast of household characters. Stephen, a \\"noble soul,\\" is in love with Cassandra, which she finds touching but a bit awkward. Thomas, a schoolboy, is, like Cassandra, considered \\"tolerably bright\\". Things begin to happen when the Cottons, a wealthy American family, inherit nearby Scoatney Hall and become the Mortmains' new landlords. Cassandra and Rose soon become intrigued by the unmarried brothers Simon and Neil Cotton. Neil, who was raised in California by their English father, is a carefree young man who wants to become a rancher in the United States. Simon, who grew up in New England with his mother, is scholarly and serious, and loves the English countryside. Simon is the elder brother and therefore the heir, and is already much wealthier than Neil, so, although Rose is not attracted to him, she decides to marry him if she can, declaring that she would marry the Devil himself to escape poverty. At their first meeting the Cottons are amused and interested by the Mortmains. When they pay a call the very next day, however, the inexperienced Rose flirts openly with Simon and makes herself look ridiculous. Both brothers are repelled by this display and, as they walk away, Cassandra overhears them resolving to drop all acquaintance with the Mortmains. After an amusing episode involving a fur coat, however, all is forgiven and the two families become good friends. Rose decides that she really is taken with Simon, and Cassandra and Topaz scheme to get Simon to propose to her. Simon falls in love with Rose and proposes to her. Rose and Topaz go to London with Mrs Cotton to purchase Rose's wedding trousseau. While everyone else is away Cassandra and Simon spend the evening together, which leads to their kissing. Cassandra becomes obsessed with Simon, but suffers feelings of guilt since he is Rose's fianc√©. Cassandra concludes that she must tactfully deflect Stephen's offer of love, and encourage him in his emerging career as a model and a film actor. She joins forces with Thomas to help their father overcome his writer's block by the drastic expedient of imprisoning him in a medieval tower; copes with her own increasing attraction to Simon; and records everything in her journal. Meanwhile, unnoticed by everyone but Stephen, Rose and Neil have been falling in love. To conceal their budding romance they pretend to hate each other. When they eventually elope Simon is left heartbroken, but Cassandra becomes hopeful. Before Simon leaves to go back to the United States, he comes to see Cassandra. In spite of her feelings for him, Cassandra deflects the conversation at a moment when she thinks he may be about to propose to her, in the belief that he is still in love with Rose. The book closes on an ambiguous note, with Cassandra reminding herself that Simon has promised to return and closing her journal for good by reasserting her love for him. References and allusions =Prose works= Novels mentioned in I Capture the Castle include A la recherche du temps perdu by Proust and War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy. At one point in the book Rose and Cassandra begin, but do not finish, a bedtime conversation about whether Jane Austen or Charlotte Bront√´ is \\"better\\". The Vicar describes Cassandra as \\"Jane Eyre with a touch of Becky Sharp\\", the latter being the leading character in Vanity Fair. Edgar Allan Poe's short story \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" is also mentioned. Also Cassandra mentions having read What Maisie Knew, thinking it to be a children's book. Villette, also by Charlotte Bront√´ is referenced when Cassandra considers \\"confessing\\" to the Vicar as a means of soothing her mind. =Theatre= Cassandra compares Stephen to Silvius, a character in Shakespeare's As You Like It. Simon compares Cassandra to Portia, a character in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice when he quotes the line, \\"Oh, wise, young judge.\\" =Biblical episodes= Biblical episodes, mainly Jacob's Ladder and Jacob Wrestling, are apparently referred to in Mr Mortmain's successful novel Jacob Wrestling, though the content of that novel is never clearly represented to the reader. Cassandra calls it \\"a mixture of fiction, philosophy and poetry\\". Samson and Delilah also play a small part in I Capture the Castle, as Cassandra compares Simon and Rose to them. When he starts to try to write a new book Mr Mortmain considers the theme of Noah's Ark, but finally decides not to use a biblical theme again. =Tales and legends= \\"H√©lo√Øse\\" and \\"Abelard\\" are respectively the names of the family's dog and cat. Also cited are the \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Hansel and Gretel\\". =Verse= Stephen plagiarises from numerous poets in an attempt to impress Cassandra, including Algernon Charles Swinburne, then tries to imitate Robert Herrick in his first attempts at original verse. John Keats, G. K. Chesterton, Thomas Nashe and Percy Shelley are also quoted. Cassandra also mentions Chaucer and William Langland and the round \\"Sumer is icumen in\\" when, during an impromptu luncheon in the village with Simon, Neil and Rose, school children begin singing it. =Art= At a dinner party guests describe each other in terms of famous artists. Topaz is called a work by William Blake, Rose is said to resemble Emma, Lady Hamilton, the muse of the painter George Romney, Simon says that Cassandra is like \\"Girl with a Mousetrap,\\" a painting by Joshua Reynolds, and Mrs Fox-Cotton is said to be a work by Salvador Dal√≠ \\"with snakes coming out of her ears\\". =Music= Simon introduces Cassandra to the works of Claude Debussy: \\"Clair de lune\\", \\"La cath√©drale engloutie\\", \\"La terrasse des audiences du clair de lune\\". She also listens to J. S. Bach's \\"Sheep May Safely Graze\\" which she later searches for amongst the Vicar's collection of records. Simon and Cassandra dance to the song \\"Lover\\" before he kisses her. The song then takes on a special significance for her, and she hears it again when Neil and Rose are dancing together in London.

Education He was a graduate of the University of Richmond, and then studied at the Art Students League of New York, under Boardman Robinson, where he later taught. In 1931-2 he studied type design and punch-cutting under Rudolf Koch at the Design School Offenbach in Germany. In 1935 he studied illustration at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. The University of Richmond awarded him an honorary D.F.A. in 1968. In 1970 his work in the graphic arts was recognized by the Rochester Institute of Technology, with the presentation of their Goudy Award. Career After running his studio in New York City for several years, Chappell traveled to Germany just before World War II to work at Stempel on the typeface Trajanus. He returned to the United States at the onset of the war, having seen only initial proofs. He first saw the completed typeface in Swedish design magazines during the war. He later devoted himself to book design and illustration and was closely associated with the firm of Alfred A. Knopf for which he designed many books. He also did illustrations for Random House, Harper & Row, and Doubleday. He was a typography consultant to both the Book of the Month Club and American Type Founders.Friedl, Ott, and Stein, p. 167. He was Artist-in-Residence at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. John Updike and Chappell worked together on books for children on music, including \\"The Magic Flute\\" (1962), \\"The Ring\\" (1964) and \\"Bottom's Dream\\" (1969). His design for the E. P. Dutton re-issues of A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh books are considered to be particularly elegant.

The mine is located in the Salt Range, Potowar pleateau, which rises from the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It is Pakistan's largest, the world's 2nd largest. The mine is famous for its production of pink Khewra salt, and is a major tourist attraction, drawing up to 250,000 visitors a year. Its history dates back to its discovery by Alexander's troops in 320 BC, but it started trading in the Mughal era. The main tunnel at ground level was developed by Dr. H. Warth, a mining engineer, in 1872 during British rule. After independence, the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation took over the mine, which still remains the largest source of salt in the country, producing more than 350,000 tons per annum of about 99% pure halite. Estimates of the reserves of salt in the mine vary from 82 million tons to 600 million tons.  Geology The Khewra Salt Mine is excavated within the base of a thick layer of highly folded, faulted, and stretched Ediacaran to early Cambrian evaporites of the Salt Range Formation. This geological formation consists of a basal layer of crystalline halite, which is intercalated with potash salts. This basal layer is overlain by gypsiferous marl, which is covered by interlayered beds of gypsum and dolomite with infrequent seams of oil shale. These strata are overlain by of Neoproterozoic to Eocene sedimentary rocks that have been uplifted and eroded along with the Salt Range Formation to create the Salt Range at the southern edge of the Pothohar Plateau. The Ediacaran to early Cambrian evaporites of the Salt Range Formation have been thrust southward over Neoproterozoic to Eocene sedimentary rocks by many kilometers, which tectonically incorporated fragments of the underlying younger strata within these evaporites. The Salt Range is the southern edge of a well-described fold-and-thrust belt, which underlies the entire Pothohar Plateau and developed south of the Himalayas as a result of ongoing collision between India and Eurasia.Jaum√©, S.C. and Lillie, R.J., 1988.

Palynomorphs (organic microfossils) have been used to make inferences about the ages of the Salt Range Formation and its salt layers that are exposed within the Khewra Salt Mine. For example, while working with Geological Survey of India in the 1930s and 1940s, Birbal Sahni reported finding evidence of angiosperms, gymnosperms, and insects inside the mine which he regarded as originating from the Eocene period. However, on the basis of additional geologic data, later research has concluded that these palynomorphs were contaminants.Schindewolf, O.H. and Seilacher, A., 1955.

The Khewra Salt Mine is also known as Mayo Salt Mine, in honour of Lord Mayo, who visited it as Viceroy of India. The salt reserves at Khewra were discovered when Alexander the Great crossed the Jhelum and Mianwali region during his Indian campaign. The mine was discovered, however, not by Alexander, nor by his allies, but by his army's horses, when they were found licking the stones. Ailing horses of his army also recovered after licking the rock salt stones. During the Mughal era the salt was traded in various markets, as far away as Central Asia. On the downfall of the Mughal empire, the mine was taken over by Sikhs. Hari Singh Nalwa, the Sikh Commander-in-Chief, shared the management of the Salt Range with Gulab Singh, the Raja of Jammu. The former controlled the Warcha mine, while the latter held Khewra. The salt quarried during Sikh rule was both eaten and used as a source of revenue. In 1872, some time after they had taken over the Sikhs' territory, the British developed the mine further. They found the mining to have been inefficient, with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made the movement of labourers difficult and dangerous. The supply of water inside the mine was poor, and there was no storage facility for the mined salt. The only road to the mine was over difficult, rocky terrain. To address these problems the government levelled the road, built warehouses, provided a water supply, improved the entrances and tunnels, and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt. Penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling.  Location  Entrance to the mine Khewra Salt Mine is situated in Pind Dadan Khan Tehsil of Jhelum District. Located about 160 km (100 miles) from Islamabad and Lahore, it is accessed via the M2 motorway, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) off the Lilla interchange while going towards Pind Dadan Khan on the Lilla road. The mine is in mountains that are part of a salt range, a mineral-rich mountain system extending about 200 km from the Jhelum river south of Pothohar Plateau to where the Jhelum river joins the Indus river. Khewra mine is about 288 meters (945 feet) above sea level and about 730 meters (2400 feet) into the mountain from the mine entrance. The underground mine covers an area of 110 km2 (43 sq. miles).  Production  Display of daily salt production Estimates of the total reserves of salt in the mines range from 82 million tons to over 600 million tons. In raw form it contains negligible amounts of calcium, magnesium, potassium, sulfates, and moisture; it also contains iron, zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, and lead as trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Khewra salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent. In the early years of British rule, the Khewra mine produced about 28,000 to 30,000 tons per annum; it increased to about 187,400 tons per annum for the five fiscal years ending 194647 and to 136,824 tons for the two years ending 194950 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth. The mine's output was reported in 2003 to be 385,000 tons of salt per annum, which amounts to almost half of Pakistan's total production of rock salt. At that rate of output, the tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years. The mine comprises nineteen stories, of which eleven are below ground. From the entrance, the mine extends about 730 meters (2440 ft) into the mountains, and the total length of its tunnels is about 40 km (25 miles). Quarrying is done using the room and pillar method, mining only half of the salt and leaving the remaining half to support what is above. The temperature inside the mine remains about throughout the year. The narrow gauge Khewra Salt Mines Railway track laid during the British era is used to bring salt out of the mine in rail cars. Khewra salt is Pakistan's best known rock salt. It is used for cooking, as bath salt, as brine and as a raw material for many industries, including a soda ash plant set up by AkzoNobel in 1940. Salt from Khewra mine is also used to make decorative items like lamps, vases, ashtrays and statues, which are exported to the United States, India and many European countries. The use of rock salt to make artistic and decorative items started during the Mughal era, when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it. Warth introduced the use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from the rock salt, as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics. In 2008 the Government of Pakistan decided to sell off seventeen profitable organisations including Khewra salt mines, but the plan was shelved. The mine is now operated by the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation, a government department.  Tourism  A small Masjid made of salt bricks inside the Khewra salt mine complex Khewra Salt Mine is a major tourist attraction, with around 250,000 visitors a year, earning it considerable revenue. Visitors are taken into the mine on the Khewra Salt Mines Railway. There are numerous pools of salty water inside. The Badshahi Masjid was built in the mining tunnels with multi-coloured salt bricks about fifty years ago. Other artistic carvings in the mine include a replica of Minar-e-Pakistan, a statue of Allama Iqbal, an accumulation of crystals that form the name of Muhammad in Urdu script, a model of the Great Wall of China and another of the Mall Road of Murree. In 2003 two phases of development of tourist facilities and attractions were carried out, at a total cost of 9 million rupees. A clinical ward with 20 beds was established in 2007, costing 10 million rupees, for the treatment of asthma and other respiratory diseases using salt therapy. The \\"Visit Pakistan Year 2007\\" event included a train safari visit of Khewra Salt Mine. In February 2011 Pakistan railways started operating special trains for tourists from Lahore and Rawalpindi to Khewra. For this purpose the railway station of Khewra was refurbished with the help of a private firm. Other visitor attractions in the mine include the 75-meter-high (245-foot-high) Assembly Hall; Pul-Saraat, a salt bridge with no pillars over a 25-meter-deep (80-foot-deep) brine pond; Sheesh Mahal (Palace of Mirrors), where salt crystals are light pink; and a caf√©.  Other projects  Students of the Mine Survey Institute gathered inside a tunnel The Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation established the Mine Survey Institute at Khewra in 1971. The institute conducts mine surveys, organises mining-related courses for the miners and has establishes the Khewra Model High School and the Khewra Women College. More recently the miners won an important environmental case against the mining company for the provision of unpolluted drinking water.General Secretary, West Pakistan Salt Miners Labor Union Khewra, Jhelum v. The Director, Industries and Mineral Development, Punjab, Lahora, Human Rights Case No. 120 of 1993, (1994) S.C.M.R. at 2061. The water available to the residents of Khewra had been polluted by salt, coal and other nearby mining activity. This case is internationally recognised as important with regard to the relationship between humanity and the environment.http://www.unhchr.ch/environment/bp4.html UNHCR paper on Human Rights and the environment In 2003, while the Government of Pakistan was looking for ways to increase the country's strategic store of oil to 90 days, the PMDC put forward a proposal to use the Khewra mines to store strategic oil reserves. Scientific reports confirmed the feasibility of this proposal, but it was turned down.  Flooding in 2010  In 2010, during torrential rain all over Pakistan, water from a nearby nullah entered the mine, reaching a depth of two feet (60 cm) and blocking the exits, after which the mine was closed. It was subsequently reopened and remains open.  Gallery  File:A Mosque Made Up of Salt Rocks.JPGA mosque has been built inside the salt mines.

ARES is an acronym for Agile Responsive Effective Support. Development In 1981, U.S. Army Aviators Jim Kreutz and Milo Burroughs undertook a study for a low cost battlefield attack aircraft (LCBAA), as they felt the close air support aircraft available were inadequate to support the U.S. Army operations. They decided that a fixed-wing aircraft with excellent maneuvering capabilities at very low altitudes and resistance to stall would be necessary. Burt Rutan joined their study to design an aircraft to meet the requirements with a two-phase program. The first phase was the preliminary design of LCBAA, while in the second phase the Long EZ aircraft was modified to serve as a technology demonstrator. The original layout was of a low wing canard configuration, aircraft powered by a pusher turboprop, and built around a 30 mm Gatling gun capable of destroying light armored vehicles. It was decided that as much military hardware as possible would be used in the design. When a Pentagon official promised that they would evaluate his aircraft if he built it, he built a demonstrator aircraft in 1986. By this time the aircraft had changed significantly. It retained the general configuration, but now had a single Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D-5 turbofan engine rather than a turboprop as the propeller was vulnerable to debris kicked up by the nosewheel. A GAU-12/U 25 mm rotary barreled cannon was mounted in the aircraft to the right of the nose in a concave recess under the cockpit. The concave recess trapped gun exhaust gases, creating a pressure buildup in the recess which pushing the aircraft's nose to the left, cancelled the recoil of the large cannon, which otherwise pushed the nose to the right. To prevent exhaust gases from the gun entering the engine intake and reducing engine performance, the engine intake was located on the left side of the nose, opposite the cannon making the aircraft asymmetric. Thrust was redirected to the centerline via a series of ducts, which also reduced the infrared signature. After Beechcraft sold Scaled Composites back to Rutan, he chose to complete the project with company funds. This aircraft was renamed ARES, and first flew on February 19, 1990, piloted by Scaled Composites test pilot Doug Shane. Since then it has flown more than 250 hours, and met its original design specifications for performance and range. In 1991 under US Air Force contract, the ARES 25 mm cannon was installed and during testing the cannon performed well but the ARES remains a private project. After an appearance in the movie Aces: Iron Eagle III as a fictional Me 263 fighter, the aircraft has become a commercially available research test bed. The aircraft was stored in December 2000 at the Mojave Spaceport until Scaled Composites became a Northrop Grumman subsidiary and flown again on March 7, 2008.Flight International, 4‚Äì10 March 2008, p. 17. Design The ARES is of canard configuration to enable safer flight at low altitude. The foreplane provides pitch control and is designed so that it reaches critical angle of attack sooner than the main wings, protecting the aircraft from stall while full roll control is retained. The foreplane has a wingspan of 19.2 feet (5.85 m) and is unusual in being swept 7 degrees forward from its attachment point behind the cockpit. The main wing has a span of 35 feet (10.7 m) and a reference area of 191 sq. ft. (17.7 m2), not including the strakes. It is swept aft 16 degrees at the leading edge. The strakes are swept 49 degrees at the leading edge. These strakes, combined with a wet wing center-section area, form the bulk of the 2,200 lb (1000 kg, approximately 333 U.S. gallons) fuel capacity. The wing has conventional ailerons on the outboard trailing edge, and spoil-flaps (similar to the dive-brake flap) on the inboard trailing edges. The ailerons are actuated by push-rods, and the spoil-flaps are hydraulically operated. Directional stability is provided by twin boom-mounted fins, each of . area. Each has a cable-actuated rudder at its trailing edge. The rudder actuation system also drives the full-time mechanical nosewheel steering for ground operations. The engine inlet is another major unique feature of ARES. Since gun gas ingestion posed significant problems in other aircraft development programs (like A-10), the configuration of ARES was designed to avoid this problem: the engine inlet is entirely contained on the left side of the aircraft, and the gun is installed on the right side. The inlet has a circular cross section, and is straight into the fan face. The engine is mounted slightly transversely in the fuselage, with an 8-degree misalignment from the aircraft's longitudinal axis. The engine exhaust is turned back to the longitudinal axis by a curved composite tailpipe. A composite tailpipe was to help get the gun recoil reaction closer to the aircraft lateral center of gravity (CG) location, the gun is sub-merged as deeply as practical into the right side of the fuselage. Also, the fuselage is not centered about the aircraft centerline, but is offset to the left by three inches. This results in the firing barrel of the gun being only about 18 inches from the lateral CG. This minimizes the yaw movement caused by the recoil of the gun. The aircraft fuselage is almost completely made of fiberglass composite material installed over the foam core. The fabrication technique of composite aircraft fuselages has been perfected by Scaled Composites in previous aircraft. To assure a low cost and high reliability of the components ARES primarily includes off-the-shelf aircraft systems. The engine is the Pratt and Whitney Canada JT15D with 2,900 lb (13.2 kN) of thrust at sea level. The hydraulic system, used for spoiler flaps and landing gear actuation, uses a Piper Malibu hydraulic pump, which operates at 1500 psi. Instrumentation for the demonstrator consists mainly of standard general aviation equipment. In addition there is a head-up display which currently displays only a fixed reticle to aim the gun but is capable of displaying the complete data range of an F-16. The pilot sits in a Universal Propulsion Company SIIIS-3ER ejection seat with zero-zero capability. The fuel system consists of auxiliary wing tanks feeding an armored, fuselage-mounted main tank, which sits just forward of the engine and behind the firewall. The main tank can feed the engine in all attitudes. This tank is continuously refilled from the main wing tanks with no fuel management duties required of the pilot. By feeding the main tank from the two auxiliary wing tanks, the size of the fuel tank in the fuselage was effectively halved, creating a large space behind the pilot empty of any tanks or other aircraft systems. This bay had no dedicated function on the demonstrator, but was intended to be left available for any additional equipment which the Army might wish to install in the production version. The main flight controls are completely mechanical and the engine has a backup mechanical fuel control so the aircraft can retain control even if the electrical system fails. The controls were specially designed to minimize the forces on the stick. Besides the GAU-12 gun, there are additional pylons to carry another ordnance (Hydra 70 FFAR, for example). The ARES has very good turning performance as a result of low wing loading. Its turn rate is 32 degree/second at 6G and 36 degree/second at 7G (the structure is limited to 8G). The corner speed is 210 kt (390 km/h) the stall speed is 78 kt (145 km/h). Due to high fuel volume and good cruising efficiency the aircraft can have a range of 1200 nautical miles (2200 km) at altitude and long endurance.Kreutz, Jim, \\"Low Cost Battlefield Attack Aircraft\\", Sky Blue Aviation, 1989, unpublished.

He is considered one of Japan‚Äôs most influential wrestlers for his work in the 1980s and 1990s and is known as the first wrestler to popularize the Sasori-Gatame, better known in English as the Scorpion Deathlock or Sharpshooter. After leaving NJPW in 2002, he formed Fighting World of Japan Pro Wrestling (WJ), but eventually returned to New Japan in October 2005 as a site foreman, booker and part-time wrestler. Choshu once again left NJPW in 2010 and primarily worked in Tatsumi Fujinami‚Äôs Dradition, as well as his own self-produced Power Hall events as a freelancer.  Early life  Choshu was born Kwak Gwang-ung (), the youngest of four children in Tokuyama, Yamaguchi Prefecture to a Japanese mother and Korean father. His father left Korea's Chungcheongbuk-do for Japan in 1939 and worked as a garbage man for much of his life. Choshu has said that he faced discrimination from teachers in elementary school due to his Korean heritage. He took part in baseball and judo as a teenager and after training in the judo department at Giyang Junior High School, he moved to the wrestling department of Yamaguchi prefecture's Sakurakaoka High School as a special student. He eventually came in second place in the 73kg class of the Nagasaki National Freestyle wrestling tournament, which attracted attention from university wrestling officials and he later enrolled at Senshu University School of Commerce on a wrestling scholarship.  Amateur wrestling career  Kwak joined the amateur wrestling team at Senshu University shortly after enrolling and was teammates with Mitsushi Hirasawa, the father of future NJPW wrestler Mitsuhide Hirasawa. In 1971, he won the All Japan Student Wrestling Championship in the 90kg class. Thanks to his victory in the tournament, Kwak was selected to represent Japan in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. Officials however refused to let him compete for Japan on account of him being part Korean. Nevertheless, South Korea instead invited him to join their freestyle team and he represented South Korea as a wrestler. Gwang-ung ended the tournament with a record of 1 win and 2 losses, and was disqualified due to the penalty points system. When he returned to Japan, Kwak became captain of the Senshu wrestling team in his fourth year at university and won the Freestyle and Greco-Roman 100 kg class tournaments at the All Japan Championship in 1973.  Professional wrestling career  = Early years (1974‚Äì1987) = He debuted in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in August 1974 against El Greco. In the mid-1970s, Choshu was sent to North America to gain experience. Wrestling under his real name (Mitsuo Yoshida, sometimes referred as \\"Mitsu\\"), he appeared in George Cannon's \\"Superstars of Wrestling\\" promotion in Windsor, Ontario as a heel, managed by Superstar (or Supermouth) Dave Drasen. Choshu had a brief feud with the top fan favorite of Cannon's promotion, Luis Martinez. The ring name at the time of debut was Mitsuo Yoshida (ÂêâÁî∞ ÂÖâÈõÑ), but from April 1977 after returning from overseas training, he adopted his famously known ring name Riki Choshu after Choshu (Èï∑Â∑û) in honor of the Choshu Forces, another name for his hometown Nagato.„ÄéTHE WRESTLER BEST 1000„ÄèP136Ôºà1996Âπ¥„ÄÅÊó•Êú¨„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æÔºâ In the 4th World League match, which he participated in when he returned to Japan, he finished third with Nikolai Volkoff, behind winner Seiji Sakaguchi and runner-up The Masked Superstar.. Choshu was the first \\"traitor heel\\" in a Japanese promotion. In 1983, upset at not being selected for the inaugural tournament for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, he turned on Tatsumi Fujinami during a match and formed his own stable, Ishin Gundan (Revolutionary Army), which was the core for the later Japan Pro-Wrestling (JPW) promotion that \\"invaded\\" All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). = New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1987‚Äì1998) = Upon returning to NJPW in 1987, Choshu was a part of the Takeshi Puroresu Gundan. After NJPW split ties with Takeshi Kitano over the December 27 Sumo Hall riot, Choshu slowly climbed back up into the main event picture. In June 1988, he won his first IWGP Tag Team Championship with Masa Saito, with whom he had also partnered during a brief stint in the American Wrestling Association (AWA). At the same time, he feuded with Tatsumi Fujinami over the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. On May 27, the match ended in a no contest, in which the title was held up. Fujinami won the rematch on June 24. In July 1989, he won his first IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Salman Hashimikov of the Soviet Union. The same month, he would also win his second IWGP Tag Team title with young up-and-comer Takayuki Iizuka. Two more IWGP Heavyweight title reigns would follow between August 19, 1990 and January 4, 1992. In August 1996, he won the G1 Climax, winning every single match in the tournament. In 1997, he won his third IWGP Tag Team title with Kensuke Sasaki. In January 1998, he retired from the ring; for his retirement match, he wrestled five matches in one night, winning four out of five matches, defeating Tatsuhito Takaiwa, Yutaka Yoshie, Jushin Thunder Liger and Kazuyuki Fujita, only to fall to his former tag team partner Takashi Iizuka. He would focus on booking matches for NJPW after that. = Comeback (2000‚Äì2019) = Retirement did not last long, as Atsushi Onita challenged Choshu to a barbed wire deathmatch in 2000. Choshu accepted and wrestled Onita in a deadly squash, where Choshu ended up winning. He then balanced wrestling and booking for NJPW, until his departure in 2002, stemming from the departures of Keiji Mutoh and Satoshi Kojima, among others, to AJPW, which caused his position of head booker taken away. After leaving NJPW, he formed Fighting World of Japan Pro Wrestling in 2003, which would later be changed to Riki Pro, after the failure of some of their big shows. He ran Riki Pro until 2005 when he returned to NJPW as a site foreman, booker, and wrestler. In 2007, Choshu joined the Legend stable with Masahiro Chono, Jyushin Thunder Liger, and AKIRA. Choshu also promotes an occasional series of events called \\"LOCK UP\\", which feature talent from New Japan and other promotions. New Japan supported this financially until 2008 before withdrawing. In 2012, Choshu was booked in a series of matches for LEGEND The Pro Wrestling and Dradition. On June 26, 2019, Choshu teamed with Tomohiro Ishii and Shiro Koshinaka in a 6-man tag against Tatsumi Fujinami, Keiji Mutoh, and Togi Makabe. Fujinami's team won when Makabe pinned Choshu. In the post-match, Choshu officially announced his retirement from pro-wrestling.Power Hall 2019 Main Event https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M4d3DPIYT0  Other media  Choshu appears as a gang member in the 2017 video game Yakuza Kiwami 2, alongside Genichiro Tenryu, Keiji Mutoh, Masahiro Chono and Tatsumi Fujinami.

Q.B.) is the superior court of the Canadian province of Alberta. The Court of Queen's Bench in Calgary was relocated to the Calgary Courts Centre in 2007. The Court of Queen's Bench has been located at the Law Courts building in Edmonton since the 1970s. History The court originates from the old Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories. Two years after Alberta became a province in 1905, the court was reorganized as the Supreme Court of Alberta and several lower district courts possessing a more limited jurisdiction. In 1921, the Supreme Court was reorganized to have an independent trial division (Supreme Court of Alberta Trial Division), and an independent appellate division (Supreme Court of Alberta Appellate Division), the precursor to the Court of Appeal of Alberta. It was not until June 30, 1979, that the Supreme Court Trial Division received its current name as the \\"Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta\\". The district courts created in 1907 were amalgamated into the District Court of Northern Alberta and the District Court of Southern Alberta in 1935, merging altogether into the District Court of Alberta in 1975. In 1979, it merged for the last time, this time back with the Supreme Court, into the Court of Queen's Bench. Structure The court consists of a chief justice of the court, two associate chief justices (one in Edmonton and one in Calgary), and several judges including those judges who have elected supernumerary status after many years of service and after having attained eligibility for retirement (typically at age 65). A justice of the Court of Appeal of Alberta is an ex officio justice of the Court of Queen's Bench and may sit on that court. Likewise, a justice of the Court of Queen's Bench may sit on a panel of the Court of Appeal, by invitation of the chief justice of Alberta. The chief justice of Alberta and the chief justice of the Court of the Queen's Bench are distinct offices. The former is the chief justice of the province and sits on the Court of Appeal, while the latter is the chief justice of a court and sits on the Court of Queen's Bench. The province is divided into 11 districts with court sitting in 13 different locations (some districts have a primary and a secondary location). In 2010 the locations were: *Calgary *Drumheller *Edmonton *Fort McMurray *Grande Prairie *High Level *Hinton *Lethbridge *Medicine Hat *Peace River *Red Deer *St. Paul *Wetaskiwin Jurisdiction As a superior court, it has inherent jurisdiction and therefore, may hear matters despite absence of specific statutory delegation. Thus, it operates as a civil and criminal trial court, hears surrogate matters, as well as certain appeals from the Provincial Court of Alberta. Appeals from the court lie with the Court of Appeal. Civil procedure before the court are set out in the Alberta Rules of Court. Appointments Although provincial superior courts are administered by the provinces, they are considered to be Section 96 courts (from Section 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867). Therefore, appointments to the court are within federal jurisdiction and made by cabinet. Styling The Court of Queen's Bench Act sets out the styling convention of the court in Section 2(2). During the reign of a queen, it is known as the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. Should the monarchy be vested in a king, it will be known as the Court of King's Bench of Alberta.

Plot summary The book opens with a fictional historical overview/flashback to events of Homer's Odyssey, but alters the original plot. In the present day, Dirk Pitt, his son Dirk Pitt, Jr., his daughter Summer Pitt, and friend Al Giordino are involved in the search for the source of a brownish contamination in the ocean's waters, which leads to a diabolical plot that they must unravel and ultimately topple. As this is occurring, discoveries relating to the \\"true\\" tale of the Odyssey are made. The villain is the mysterious billionaire businessman Specter, a huge man who disguises his identity by wearing sunglasses, a hat, and a scarf over his face. The book also features a significant event between Dirk Pitt and Congresswoman Loren Smith. He and Al retire from their life of daredevilry and settle down. Pitt asks for the hand of Loren who also steps down. Pitt assumes the responsibility of head of NUMA as Admiral Sandecker accepts the Vice Presidency. This marks a change in Dirk Pitt Sr. series, as confirmed by his next novel, which features Dirk Pitt Jr. as the primary protagonist. As with every Dirk Pitt novel, this one features a classic car, in this case a Marmon V-16 Town Car. A custom-built 1952 Meteor DeSoto hot rod modified with a engine is briefly mentioned. Trivia Cussler dedicated Trojan Odyssey to his wife, who died due to cancer in 2003. The main antagonist in the novel shares his alias (\\"Specter\\") with the father of the antagonists in Inca Gold. Loren's father mysteriously came back to life and attended the wedding, long after being killed and his body stashed on a sunken aircraft in a remote Colorado lake as depicted in Vixen 03.

Life and career Born in Buffalo, South Carolina, Don Reno grew up on a farm in Haywood County, North Carolina. He began playing the banjo at the age of five. His father gave him a guitar four years later; and in 1939 13-year-old Reno joined the Morris Brothers in performing at a local radio station. He left one year later to join Arthur \\"Guitar Boogie\\" Smith,Trischka, Tony, \\"Sonny Osborne\\", Banjo Song Book, Oak Publications, 1977 with whom he would years later record \\"Feudin' Banjos\\". In 1943 he received an offer from Bill Monroe to become a member of the Bluegrass Boys, but chose instead to enlist in the United States Army. Trained as a horse soldier at Fort Riley, Kansas, he was sent to the Pacific Theater to fight on foot. He eventually served in Merrill's Marauders and was wounded in action. Influenced by old-time banjo player Snuffy Jenkins and others, Reno developed his own two finger \\"single-string\\" style, typically using either his index or middle finger along with his thumb, to pick a single string repeatedly, that allowed him to play scales and complicated fiddle tunes note- for-note. The Reno style encompasses much more than just single-string picking; double-stops, double-time picking, triple-pull offs‚Äîall of these, and other techniques make Reno's playing recognizable. According to his son, Don Wayne Reno, \\"My dad told me more than once that the reason he started his own style of banjo picking was this: When he came out of the service, many people said 'You sound just like Earl Scruggs.' He said that really bothered him considering he never played a banjo while he was in the service, and when he returned to the U.S., he continued to play in the style he had always played before.\\" In 1948, Reno became a member of the Blue Grass Boys. Two years later, with Red Smiley, he formed Reno and Smiley and the Tennessee Cutups, a partnership that lasted fourteen years. Among their hits were \\"I'm Using My Bible For A Road Map\\", \\"I Wouldn't Change You If I Could\\" and \\"Don't Let Your Sweet Love Die\\". Included in this lineup was his son, Ronnie Reno, who played mandolin. Videos from those days are shown regularly on Ronnie's show on RFD- TV. In 1964, after the retirement of Red Smiley, Reno and guitarist Bill Harrell formed Reno & Harrell. Red Smiley joined Reno and Harrell in 1969, remaining with them until his death in 1972. From 1964-71, he also performed with Benny Martin. In the 1970s he played with The Good Ol' Boys, composed of Frank Wakefield on mandolin, David Nelson on guitar, Chubby Wise on fiddle, and Pat Campbell on bass. Reno began performing with his sons Don Wayne and Dale in later years. Death Don Reno died in 1984 aged 58 of a \\"circulatory ailment.\\" He is buried in Spring Hill Cemetery, Lynchburg, Virginia. In 1992 he was posthumously inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor.

Ei Group plc is headquartered in Solihull, West Midlands. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by Stonegate Pub Company in March 2020. History Ei Group's offices in Solihull The company was founded by Ted Tuppen, initially with 300 pubs from Bass, as Enterprise Inns in 1991. The company listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1995. The group made a series of acquisitions including 1,864 former Laurel Pub Company pubs from Whitbread in 2002 and 4,054 pubs with the acquisition of the Unique Pub Company in 2004. Enterprise Inns had over 9,000 pubs on completion of the acquisition of the Unique Pub Company and it formed part of the FTSE100 Index at that time. However, the decline in the UK pub trade led to its removal from the FTSE100 in 2008. In the face of the level of its debts the company stopped paying dividends to shareholders in 2009. Ted Tuppen stood down as Chief executive in February 2014Interim Management Statement and Enterprise Inns rebranded to Ei Group in February 2017. In July 2019 Stonegate Pub Company announced its intention to acquire Ei Group for ¬£1.27 billion. That same month and year, Stonegate pursued the acquisition of Ei Group in a ¬£3 billion deal which will \\"add almost 4,000 new pubs to Stonegate Pub Company‚Äôs 765 existing locations\\". Operations The pubs are operated by tenants, which means that the company collects rent from individuals who operate and often live in the pubs. They also operate (in most, but not all cases) what is known as a beer tie. This means that tenants renting public houses from them are under contract to buy beer, ciders, RTDs and other alcoholic drinks from Enterprise Inns only. Under some leases tenants are required to also purchase other products, such as soft drinks, wines and spirits from Enterprise, although this is not as widespread as the beer tie. Reflections on business practice On 12 May 2009, The Guardian newspaper reported how \\"Enterprise Inns counts cost of bad pub landlords\\": the recession had forced the pubco to take action against more than 100 \\"poor quality and underperforming licensees\\" since last autumn. It is spending ¬£1.4m a month on financial assistance to help those in distress, on top of the ¬£700,000 a month cost of freezing the price of five lager and ale brands. Chief executive Ted Tuppen told The Guardian: \\"If people are genuinely struggling and will work with us, we are providing an awful lot of help\\". The cost of these programmes was however contributing to a slump in profits.The Gauardian: \\"Enterprise Inns counts cost of bad pub landlords\\". Retrieved 14 June 2009 On 13 May 2009, the House of Commons published a report regarding a monopolies inquiry into pub groups.House of Commons. Business and Enterprise Committee: Pub Companies. Retrieved 6 July 2009 The report \\"raises a series of questions about the pub company (pubco) tied pub business model and calls on the Government to act urgently, in particular, to refer the matter to the Competition Commission. It challenges the pubcos which operate a tie to prove its benefits by giving lessees the choice between a tied or free of tie lease.\\"MPs publish report on pub companies Retrieved 6 July 2009 The report also raises issues regarding the actual conduct of pubcos in dealing with struggling tenants. Committee chairman Peter Luff, MP says: \\"The report explicitly acknowledges that 'not all the problems of the pub industry come from the tied pub model. It is clear there are many pressures on any retail business ... Nonetheless, our inquiry found alarming evidence indicating there may be serious problems caused by the dominance of the large pub companies.'\\" According to an article in Private Eye, the select committee asked 1,000 publicans for their opinions regarding their experiences working with Britain's largest pubcos, which includes Enterprise Inns. The Eye states that the committee's findings had \\"at last shed light on an industry in freefall, with 40 pubs closing [in the UK] every week. Pubcos are essentially greedy property companies with a cuddly name ‚Äì and they own nearly half the country's pub freeholds.\\"Private Eye. Pubs: All tied and emotional. Retrieved 6 July 2009 The Committee commissioned its own independent survey as part of the inquiry, to determine whether the negative evidence it initially received from lessees was typical of feelings in the industry. > \\"The survey results, printed with the Committee's evidence, underpinned the > Committee's findings. 64 per cent of lessees did not think their pubco added > any value and while a fifth had had a dispute with their pubco, few (18 per > cent) were satisfied with the outcome. The Committee was astonished to learn > that 67 per cent of the lessees surveyed earned less than ¬£15,000 pa and > over 50 per cent of the lessees who had turnover of more than ¬£500,000 pa > earned less than ¬£15,000 ‚Äì a 3 per cent rate of return. The lessees may > share the risks with their pubco but they do not appear to share the > benefits. The report therefore concludes that problems which were identified > by the Trade and Industry Committee four years ago remain. An imbalance of > bargaining power between lessees and pubcos persists and the arrangements > for assessing rents remain opaque. Rental assessment should be the basis for > negotiation, but incumbent lessees often risk the loss of their home as well > as their business if they cannot reach agreement, the report says.\\" The Eye says the committee found that pubco tenants are initially attracted to run pubs by low entry costs, but soon find that making a decent living is very difficult. Tenants' leases oblige them to buy alcoholic drinks from nominated suppliers at up to twice the open-market price. If a struggling tenant leaves, another tenant can be found to replace them. In the years of booming property prices this practice was successful, but is much less so now, as evidenced by the number of pub closures. The Guardian reported that MPs found an imbalance of power that can amount to \\"downright bullying\\" between the big pubcos, such as Enterprise Inns and Punch Taverns, and their tenants.MPs urge monopolies inquiry into pub groups. Retrieved 6 July 2009 In 2008, one tenant who felt forced to close the pub he ran with his wife said: > \\"We told Enterprise [Inns] we were struggling and needed some help; they > didn't come forward with any. If we were late paying bills we would get > threatening phone calls. They could have put a hold on the rent or given us > a discount until we managed to get business back up. If we didn't pay bills > on time they wouldn't deliver the beer and when they did deliver it they > would charge us for carriage. Instead of helping us they were making it > worse.\\"Huddersfield Examiner: Another local closes. Retrieved 06-14-2009 The MPs are said to also want a ban on pubcos selling pub premises with restrictive covenants that prevent them being used as pubs in the future. Ted Tuppen explained the need for covenants to the committee by saying there are too many pubs in some areas and Enterprise used restrictive covenants \\"because, genuinely, we think these are pubs that have lived their life\\". However, he admitted that 70% of Enterprise sales have such covenants in place. The select committee was not generally impressed by the pubcos' senior executives, rebuking them for having given \\"partial\\" and even \\"false\\" evidence to the committee. The committee recommended that \\"the tying of beers, other drinks and ancillary products should be severely limited to ensure that competition in the retail market is restored.\\" The Eye notes that select committee chairman Peter Luff \\"may be looking to right the wrong created by the Thatcher government's disastrous \\"Beer Orders\\" of 1989, in which he was involved.\\"Private Eye.

Planning problems are specified in the hierarchical task network approach by providing a set of tasks, which can be: # primitive (initial state) tasks, which roughly correspond to the actions of STRIPS; # compound tasks (intermediate state), which can be seen as composed of a set of simpler tasks; # goal tasks (goal state), which roughly corresponds to the goals of STRIPS, but are more general. A solution to an HTN problem is then an executable sequence of primitive tasks that can be obtained from the initial task network by decomposing compound tasks into their set of simpler tasks, and by inserting ordering constraints. A primitive task is an action that can be executed directly given the state in which it is executed supports its precondition. A compound task is a complex task composed of a partially ordered set of further tasks, which can either be primitive or abstract. A goal task is a task of satisfying a condition. The difference between primitive and other tasks is that the primitive actions can be directly executed. Compound and goal tasks both require a sequence of primitive actions to be performed; however, goal tasks are specified in terms of conditions that have to be made true, while compound tasks can only be specified in terms of other tasks via the task network outlined below. Constraints among tasks are expressed in the form of networks, called (hierarchical) task networks. A task network is a set of tasks and constraints among them. Such a network can be used as the precondition for another compound or goal task to be feasible. This way, one can express that a given task is feasible only if a set of other actions (those mentioned in the network) are done, and they are done in such a way that the constraints among them (specified by the network) are satisfied. One particular formalism for representing hierarchical task networks that has been fairly widely used is TAEMS. Some of the best-known domain-independent HTN- planning systems are: * Nonlin, one of the first HTN planning systems.Nonlin * SIPE-2 * O-Plan, Open Planning ArchitectureO-Plan * UMCP, the first provably sound and complete HTN planning systems.UMCP * I-X/I-PlanI-X/I-Plan * SHOP2, a HTN-planner developed at University of Maryland, College Park.SHOP2 * PANDA, a system designed for hybrid planning, an extension of HTN planning developed at Ulm University, Germany. PANDA * HTNPlan-P, preference-based HTN planning.HTNPlan-P HTN planning is strictly more expressive than STRIPS, to the point of being undecidable in the general case. However, many syntactic restrictions of HTN planning are decidable, with known complexities ranging from NP-complete to 2-EXPSPACE-complete, and some HTN problems can be efficiently compiled into PDDL, a STRIPS-like language.

The two-disc set includes songs from 1980 to 2005. A third disc which was a DVD live concert which was recorded in mid-2005 called \\"Live in Lisbon\\" was included in North America for a limited time. All the songs are in chronological order of their release, except the last song on the first disc on the North American edition, which was released in 1999. The album's enclosed booklet has notes about the process of the recordings and the credits for each track.  Release and reception  Anthology, co-produced by Adams, Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange and Bob Clearmountain, peaked at number 65 on the Billboard 200. The album was released on October 18, 2005, peaking at number 4 on the Canadian Album Chart and at number 29 on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified two times platinum in Canada and gold in the United Kingdom.  Version differences  On the first disc, the North American edition has \\"The Best of Me\\" as the last track, while the International edition moved the song to the second disc, and had \\"All I Want Is You\\" instead. On the second disc, the North American edition has two songs from his album Room Service and a re-recorded version of \\"When You're Gone\\" with Pamela Anderson instead of Melanie C. While the international edition replaces the two Room Service Tracks with a new song \\"I'm Not the Man You Think I Am\\" (from the movie Colour Me Kubrick) and \\"Don't Give Up\\" (a collaboration with Chicane), and the original version of \\"When You're Gone\\" with Melanie C instead of the new version.

It appears as the final track on the second disc in the North American release of the album (and second-to- last in international versions). Originally this song was to be the final song of the album of the same name but was scrapped.

It sits in the Wetherby ward of Leeds City Council and Elmet and Rothwell parliamentary constituency.  Overview  According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 1,715, which had fallen to 1,650 by the time of the 2011 census. Bramham is located south of Wetherby, midway between Leeds and York and about south of Harrogate in the so-called Golden Triangle. Bramham is a part of the Wetherby Ward of Leeds Metropolitan Council and is at the north-eastern edge of West Yorkshire where it borders North Yorkshire at Tadcaster, away. Bramham was in the Elmet constituency until the 2010 general election when it became part of the newly created Elmet and Rothwell constituency and the local Conservative M.P. is Alec Shelbrooke. Bramham Park (at ), to the south-west of the village, is home to the Leeds Festival, an annual music and arts festival, which is held over the August Bank Holiday weekend each year. Etymology The name Bramham is first attested in the Domesday Book in the forms Bramha‚Äô, Brameha‚Äô, and Braham. It comes from the Old English words br≈çm ('broom') and hƒÅm ('village, homestead'), and thus once meant 'homestead characterised by broom'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017), p. 26.  History  Bramham is at the crossroads of the east-west Roman road from York through Tadcaster to Ilkley and the north-south Great North Road, now the A1 road, giving it a history that goes back to the Romans. All Saint's Church, which dates back to Norman times. The Old English place name elements -ham and - are characteristic of the earliest English-speaking settlements in England, associated with the growth of Anglo-Saxon culture in post-Roman Britain.Bethany Fox, 'The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland', The Heroic Age, 10 (2007), ¬ß18. Running north south and following approximately, the Magnesian Limestone belt, a line of - (Collingham \\"homestead of Cola's folk\\") and -ham (Bramham \\"homestead amongst the broom\\") names can be identified, which also coincide with the distribution of seventh-century burials. Bramham is recorded in the Domesday Book as the Manor of Bramham and the Holder in 1066 was Ligulfr. The amount of land to be taxed (geld) was 12 carucates and there were eight ploughs in the village. By 1086, Bramham was held by Nigel from Count Robert of Mortain and Demesne ploughs (for lord‚Äôs needs) were three. There were 15 villeins or tenant farmers holding a total of 5.5 ploughs between them. An estimate of the total population of Bramham in 1086 was 68. Bramham's value in 1066 was 160 shillings but only 50 shillings in 1086 after the Harrying of the North, indicating quite a severe levels of destruction. Bramham was a mill site in 1086. In comparison, Wetherby had a population of 41 and was valued at only 20 shillings in both 1066 and 1086. The oldest part of All Saints Parish Church in Bramham was built in about 1150 by the Normans. The church consists of nave, aisles, and chancel, with tower and short spire; and has a fine pointed doorway. The churchyard is oval in shape and therefore Anglian in origin. Older houses in the centre of the village are constructed of Magnesian Limestone quarried in the parish. Stone from Bramham was used for the pendants and hanging ornaments on the vaults and ceilings of York Minster, and in records of the building of the Minster, Bramham stone is specially referred to as being used for this purpose. The Bramham limestone was transported to York by water from Tadcaster or Cawood. Memorial Stone at the site of the Battle of Bramham Moor, which took place in 1408. The Battle of Bramham Moor was fought, in the snow, on 19 February 1408. Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, who with other nobles had rebelled against King Henry IV, was met here by Sir Thomas Rokeby; the rebels were cut to pieces and Percy was killed, his head, with its silver locks, being carried off and set on a stake on London Bridge. There is a memorial stone marking where the Earl of Northumberland fell and was killed at Blackfen Wood, Bramham, but the stone was moved from the actual site of the battle some years ago. A plaque erected to denote the significance of the stone has been vandalised and nowadays is difficult to find or decipher. In 2008, to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the battle, an information board and a two-sided limestone memorial stone bearing \\"Bramham\\" and \\"Site of Battle\\" signs was erected on Paradise Way, the new local access road, which crosses the battlefield site. It is known that English Civil War soldiers who died during the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644, a few miles to the north-east, are buried in the churchyard at Bramham. Records show that three soldiers rest there: Samuell Allan, Robert Johnson and Thomas Mirole. Prior to the battle, Cromwell is reputed to have trained his Ironsides on Bramham Moor, and to have recruited local young farmers whose riding skills made them ideal cavalry soldiers. By 1686, Bramham was a staging post on the London to Edinburgh coaching route and had a population of 291, which was higher than that of Wetherby at only 279. In 1801, the population of Bramham was around 800, reaching 1,300 by 1861. However, a significant decline led to the population falling back to 950 in 1901. The population has gradually been increasing since then, although the 1861 peak was only overtaken in 1981. By 2001, the village had a population of about 1,750, about a quarter of whom were under the age of 19 and well over half (62%) were under the age of 44, making it a village of young people. There were 674 households, a growth of 20% on the 1991 census. Arthur Mee's The King's England: Yorkshire West Riding, first printed in 1941, describes Bramham: During the First World War there was an aerodrome at Bramham Moor at Headley Bar, which opened on 18 March 1916. The aerodrome was set in of land of which was occupied by station buildings. Initially, \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" flights, 33 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps were based at the new aerodrome with \\"A\\" flight detached to nearby York Racecourse. Following a bombing raid on York on 2 May 1916 by Zeppelin airships, the airfield on York Racecourse was closed, and 33 Squadron at RFC Bramham Moor became responsible for the air defence of Leeds, Sheffield and York against further Zeppelin attack. 33 Squadron's aircraft were the RAF BE 2c and BE 2d biplanes, these later being replaced by the much better FE 2b biplane. In early 1918, after the RAF was formed, RFC Bramham Moor became known as RAF Tadcaster. In July 1918, a group of American pilots and ground staff were based at Bramham Moor for training. When the USA had entered the First World War in 1917, their pilots had gone straight into action with a lack of combat experience and had suffered heavy losses. It was subsequently decided that all American pilots should pass through the British training schools such as the one at Bramham. After the First World War, with a reduced need for warplanes, the aerodrome was closed down in December 1919. One large hangar remains, as a listed building, among the barns of Headley Hall Farm. During the Second World War, dummy aeroplanes were left on the old runway so that from the air, it looked like an operational airfield. For many years, the village had a rural emphasis although as the Great North Road grew in importance, the number of coaching inns and stables increased to service the passing trade. Over the years, a significant amount of employment has been provided by the local estates, particularly Bramham Park and the other grand houses in the village. In the late 20th century there was a decline in employment in agriculture that coincided with the growth of the village as home to a significant number of commuters. As a result, the village has become increasingly diverse in nature. A large part of the village is included in a conservation area and all the land outside the present built area is currently designated green belt. The army officer, ethnologist and anthropologist General Augustus Pitt Rivers was born in Bramham cum Oglethorpe on 14 April 1827.  Present-day  =Description= Part of Bramham as viewed from the western outskirts of the village near the A1. The annual report by the chairman of the Parish Council in 2004 states: = Education = Bramham Primary School, just outside the parish boundary, provides the village's primary education, mainly feeding Boston Spa Comprehensive School. = Healthcare = Bramham's Medical Centre is situated on Clifford Road, near the centre of the village. Hospital treatment is usually provided by hospitals in Leeds or Harrogate. Bramham has an ambulance station, however Yorkshire Ambulance have considered moving the station to Wetherby, since the upgrade to the A1(M) has meant the Bramham site no longer has efficient access to the motorway. = Community activities = The Red Lion Community-based activities take place in Bramham Village Hall, and include groups and classes for drama, dance and fitness, Guides and Brownies, youth, and ramblers, and provides for church functions, senior citizens, parties, Bramham in Bloom, the NSPCC, and the Yorkshire Countrywomen's Association. Entertainment has included bands from the US and Sweden, comedian Dominic Holland, an evening with Indian musicians, and New Year's Eve parties. Bramham Community Action Group was established in 2005 and is implementing elements of a Parish Plan. In 2006 the group organised the Bramham Gala, which was held on the playing fields on Aberford Road. This was the first time the event has been held for over 20 years. Bramham Gala took place again in June 2007 and is now scheduled as a yearly event. Since 2003 the Leeds Music Festival has been held on the three days of the August Bank Holiday weekend in the grounds of Bramham Park. Under an agreement between Leeds City Council, the Parish Council, the promoter (Festival Republic), and the Bramham Park Estate. A number of free tickets are available to residents of the parish who make a financial contribution to the Bramham Community Fund, and to residents of Bardsey and Clifford. Festival Republic, formerly Mean Fiddler, specified that the Community Fund should be used to benefit the residents of the village, and Bramham's local community groups. The Fund has made grants of over ¬£300,000 reports the Secretary of the Fund (December 2017) There are two public houses: The Red Lion and The Swan. The Red Lion's darts and pool teams play in the Wetherby and District Pub League. The Swan has a dominoes team. A former public house, the White Horse, closed in 2010 and is now a private residence. Village signpost along Toulston Lane on the way to Tadcaster. = Sport = Bramham Football Club was founded in 1907, and plays home games at Freely Lane. It has two teams in the Harrogate and District League. The club reformed in 2005, and won the Barkston Ash Cup in 2005 and the Harrogate and District League Division One title in 2006, and again in 2007. Bramham FC also has Junior and Girls football teams. Bramham and Clifford Cricket Club has one team in the local Wetherby and District League (division 4) and a Thursday evening team in the Whixley Evening League. It plays at Rhodes Lane in nearby Clifford village. The Bramham Horse Trials are held at Bramham Park every June and form one of the UK's leading 3-day horse riding events, attracting international competitors. In 2006, over 35,000 visitors attended the event. Bramham International Horse Trials was voted the best event in the British Equestrian Trade Awards in February 2006. Levi Whitehead of Bramham was the fastest runner in England in his day. He ran in 19 minutes, and when 96 walked four miles an hour. He died, aged 100, in 1787. Neil Hudson is the current founding member of the Bramham dodgers dodge ball team - winning 5 major accolades, most recently at Crewes tournament during the May bank holiday of 2017.  Bramham College  Bramham College was a public school opened in January 1843 when Dr. Benjamin Haigh leased Bramham Biggin plus of parks and gardens. The college was extended to include a hall, theatre, gymnasium and cloisters, and a Grecian-style refectory with a glass dome. The College gained a good reputation and during its short life and attracted the sons of leading Yorkshire families. It closed after falling into decline following a severe epidemic of cholera in 1869. Several pupils died and are buried next to their headmaster under the yew tree at the eastern end of Bramham churchyard. Former pupils of Bramham College formed Bradford Football Club in 1863, and in 1880 joined Bradford Cricket Club at Bradford Park Avenue.  Bramham Moor Hunt  The Bramham Moor Hunt was founded in the 1740s by George Fox Lane, the son-in-law of Robert Benson, 1st Baron Bingley (1676‚Äì1731) who had built Bramham Park in the late 17th century. George Fox Lane was Member of Parliament for York from 1742 to 1761 and was created Lord Bingley in 1762. His only son Robert Fox Lane pre- deceased him and, in 1792, the Bramham Park estate came to James Fox (1758‚Äì1821), the nephew of George Fox Lane. James 'Jemmy' Fox was a scholar, a raconteur and, for a time, Member of Parliament for Horsham. He was a horseman who devoted himself to the estate and organised the Bramham Moor Hunt, collecting the hounds into a pack and hunting on set days over recognised hunting country. The hunting man's toast, \\"The Bramham Moor and five-and- twenty couple\\", was initiated by Jemmy Fox. It was Fox's idea to reverse the 'Fox Lane' name he had adopted to 'Lane Fox'. In 2002, the Bramham Moor Hunt merged with the Badsworth Hunt to become the Badsworth and Bramham Moor Hunt. The Bramham fox hounds, which, for many years, had been kennelled at Hope Hall, Bramham moved to Thorpe Audlin, near Pontefract. The Badsworth and Bramham Moor Hunt is active in areas that the two separate hunts covered previously. During the Second World War, two Hunt-class destroyers of the Royal Navy were named after the two hunts; HMS Badsworth and HMS Bramham respectively. A LNER Class D49 locomotive, \\"The Bramham Moor\\", was built in April 1932 by the London & North Eastern Railway's Darlington Works as number 201 (later British Railways 62736), typically hauling seven to ten coach trains on moderate length (50‚Äì100 mile) journeys in the north-east of England and remained in service until June 1958 when it was scrapped. Location grid TV Between 1979 and 1986, Bramham with fellow nearby Luddenden was used as filming locations for external scenes in the 1980s ITV Yorkshire Television situation comedy series In Loving Memory, starring Dame Thora Hird and Christopher Beeny.

It was created by Castle Thorn Software. In 2009 NeXeon Technologies partnered with Castle Thorn to support development of the game,http://nexeontech.com/index.php?page=press&id;=press_2 but in mid-2014 NeXeon announced they would shut down the game server due to severe population decline. The game created a tight-knit gaming community of around 50 people aging between 12-60 which continues today. Description The game was set in the 23rd century whereby the players undertake the one of several roles across four playable factions. The player is set on a ship on their own, or with several other real players from around the world, and take the role aboard a starship such as the Helmsman, Tactical Officer or even the Captain of the ship. The player can walk around the ship as one of 5 races depending on their faction and customize the ship to his or her liking. The ships can then partake in combat with the NPC Pirate faction, or in PvP with other factions or player pirates. The game itself is an online persistent sandbox where there anything can happen at any time. A hostile player ship can sneak up on another player and attack at any time, in any solar system. Typically combat takes place in the vast endless plane of 'Hyperspace' the method used to travel between star systems. When the player logs off, the world still develops, civilians will still have their colonies growing, ships will still fly towards a destination while offline, and players can still be attacked if their ship is moving. There are over 17,000 star systems in StarQuest Online, and approximately 100,000 individual planets. Star positions were taken from Hipparcos satellite data for positional accuracy . Each planet was then created using a stellar dust accretion program based on the mass of each star. There are over 150 non-player character (NPC) races, and many other alien creatures inhabiting these worlds. Players can choose from three unique races when creating their characters. Several different classes of starships are available for players to command, explore, and battle with . Main bridge of UAS starship. StarQuest Online went live on September 21, 2007 after more than two years of beta testing. After a free thirty-day trial period, players are required to pay a fee of $9.99 per month. Gameplay and game dynamics Players were able to do things like command ships, and set up colonies. There are no pre-programmed game environments, and no instance dungeons. Therefore, actions, victories, or colonies set up by players will remain, and affect game outcomes. StarQuest Online was one of the only space-based MMORPG http://news.mmosite.com/content/2009-02-03/20090203011351702,1.shtml where individual players can work together as crewmen on the same vessel, operating different control stations on the bridge. Administrators provide some scripted missions. However, players are fully able to create their own organizations, colonies and other structures within the game. The main organization within the games is the United Systems Alliance, which is the \\"official\\" player organization. Players may choose to create characters which are independent of the Alliance, but several alien empires are fully controlled by non-player characters. Starships require several players to function. Almost all starships have a real-world schedule to function, and cannot be used at all without at least one of the players present who serves as a senior officer in the game. Exception to this rule is civilian owned shipping which may by its nature vary a great degree.

Besides, the movement was labelled as ‚Äúamorphous‚Äù. The Issarak was formed around 1945 and composed of several factions each with its own leader. Most of the Issarak bands fought actively between the end of the Second World War in 1945 and Cambodia‚Äôs independence in 1953. Initial objectives of the Khmer Issarak was to fight against the French in order to gain independence. Later, overthrowing the Cambodian government became some Issarak bands' agenda. Moreover, the term Issarak originally referred to non-communist, but in the early 1950s the Vi·ªát Minh guided-guerrillas called themselves Issaraks for the sake of unifying other non-communist forces.  The Issarak  Poc Khun, a highborn Khmer founded a movement in Bangkok in 1944, and called it Khmer Issarak. It is the first time that the term \\"Khmer Issarak\\" was used. Some of the early founded Issaraks were backed by the Thai authoritative government. From the end of the Second World War to 1948, the Thai government had a policy to support a large number of guerrilla forces, which operated along the Thai frontier and in the two Thai ruled provinces, Battambang and Siem Reap. Among those groups which were aided by Thailand, some of the members later established right-wing and left-wing bands, including Son Ngoc Minh, Sieu Heng and Tou Samouth. These guerrillas formed a government in exile in Bangkok in 1945. After 1948, several of the Thai sponsored Issaraks dissolved or cooperated with the Phnom Penh government, which led by Prince Sihanouk. Soon afterwards, the Vietnamese guided-Issaraks formed the Khmer Issarak Association, continuing armed struggles against the Khmer authorities. In the 1950s, the Viet Minh controlled-Issarak groups eventually transformed into communist organizations, for instance, the Khmer People‚Äôs Revolution Party (KPRP). Several significant figures in the Democratic Kampuchea who participated in the Cambodian Civil War, were closely related to the Viet Minh influenced-Issaraks. During the first decade of armed struggles, there was some coordination between factions. However, in most cases, different bands fought independently. Even in 1953, a year when Cambodia gained independence, the anti-French war was still led by disparate leaders, divided geographically and ideologically. After the Geneva Conference in 1954, due to the agreement, most of the Viet Minh guided- Issaraks exiled to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) or turned underground and formed communist organizations. At the same time, as Cambodia had already gained independence from the French, most of the nationalist Issaraks and some of the communist groups disarmed themselves. Several powerful Issarak leaders such as Dap Chhuon and Prince Norodom Chantaraingsey allied with the Sihanouk government in different periods of time. The Khmer Issarak movement faded eventually. Non-Communist Issarak Groups During the independence movement, non-communist Issaraks that were based in the northwest dominated the anti-French war which lasted for around 10 years. Those Issarak groups fought throughout the entire state. The non-communist guerrillas often coordinated battles with the Viet Minh-led Issarak forces. Among the non- communist bands, Poc Khun, Dap Chhuon, Prince Chantaraingsey‚Äôs were the most prominent. Furthermore, short-term goal of the Thai-supported Issarak movement was to conduct propaganda against French colonialism in the ceded provinces, which under Thai control from 1941-1946. Nevertheless, the ultimate purpose of the movement was to gain full independence for the French Indochina colony. However, in the rightist military coup in Thailand in November 1947 the Pridi administration was overthrown,and the new Thai government reduced support its and forced the Issaraks to come back to Cambodia. There were two consequences of the return of Thai Prime Minister Phibun. First of all, with Thailand cutting its assistance the Viet Minh became one of the few sources that the Issarak groups could rely on. Secondly, a permanent split in the Cambodian independent movement between communists and non-communists took place. Due to a large number of guerrilla groups being unwilling to work with the Viet Minh, some of them set up strong bases and became warlords, but the majority dissolved. =Poc Khun= The first time that the term \\"Khmer Issarak\\" was employed was in 1944, after the new Thai Prime Minister Khuang Aphaiwong who took office under the guide of Pridi and his Free Thai movement. Soon a movement called Khmer Issarak was founded by Poc Khun, who used to work in the Publicity Department in Bangkok. Poc Khun was born in a high-ranking aristocratic family in Phnom Penh and coincidentally was the uncle of Prince Monireth‚Äôs wife. In August 1946, Poc Khun was the leader of the Khmer Issarak in Battambang province, and was elected as a representative to the House of Representatives from a district in Battambang. He continued to hold office until 1947, even after the province was returned to Cambodia. =Dap Chhuon= Before the right wing coup in Bangkok in late 1947, a jointly Khmer Issarak- Viet Minh commanded guerrilla group was founded in the Thai capital in February. Dap (Sergeant) Chhuon became the commander of the group. Chhuon was a former Cambodian militia member and an active Issarak. With Thai support, he had organized anti-French guerrilla forces in the ceded provinces since 1943. Chhuon believed in supernatural power and often conducted \\"magical\\" ceremonies before his battles. By early 1948, Chhuon was the leader of Viet Minh- associated Khmer People‚Äôs Liberation Committee. Although Dap Chhuon‚Äôs army was initially jointly run with the Viet Minh, and he was the president of KPLC, Chhuon himself was not a communist neither his soldiers received Viet Minh training. In 1949, Dap Chhuon rallied with Sihanouk, the negotiation taking a year to reach agreement. In exchange for the submission, Chhuon received administrative and military carte blanche over Siem Reap, which became his fief very soon. After rallying with the King, Chhuon had been appointed as director of security, for the sake of overseeing the 1955 election, and minister of interior in 1957. Ten years after his submission, Chhuon, who was the governor of Siem Reap and military commander of the northwest, was accused of attempting to overturn Sihanouk‚Äôs government, and later he was shot by a killer sent by Lon Nol near Siem Reap in February 1959. Communist Issarak Groups Unlike Dap Chhuon and his army, who were not communist, Sieu Heng, Long Bunruot, Son Ngoc Minh and Tou Samouth, were significant communist fighters in Cambodia and their guerrillas were heavily influenced by the Viet Minh. In provinces close to Vietnam, Vietnamese ideologies, organizations and units played critical roles in developing the anti-French resistance. Political schools were set up by the Indochina Communist Party (ICP) in those bordering provinces. Most of the students were Cambodian who were recruited by the Vietnamese, and they were taught about Marxism-Leninism and significance of cooperating with the Vietnamese. However, as Khmer communist organizations had to subordinate to the victory of the First Indochina War, only at most 5700 soldiers fought the French with the Vietnamese in Cambodia. =Sieu Heng= Sieu Heng was commander of communist Khmer Issaraks, who became a communist in 1945. He led the military resistance against the French in the 1950s but dropped out of politics afterward. After Son Ngoc Minh left for Hanoi in the mid-1950s, Heng was in charge of communist movements inside Cambodia. Around 1955 election, Heng became a secret agent to Sihanouk and later openly defected to the government, with providing information about revolutionaries to Lon Nol. At the same time, he claimed that ‚Äúmaking revolution was impossible‚Äù. In 1975, Heng was killed by his wife‚Äôs nephew, Long Bunruot. =Long Bunruot= Long Bunruot, joined the Thai Communist Party in 1946, when he was a student at Thammasat University in Bangkok. After the independence in 1953, Long Bunruot remained revolutionary and continuously fought against the Sihanouk government as an Issarak leader. At the end of the civil war, he became the second vital figure of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), and better known as Nuon Chea. =Son Ngoc Minh= Achar Mean, a Khmer monk took his name later as Son Ngoc Minh, in order to link with the former Cambodian Prime Minister Son Ngoc Thanh and the Viet Minh leader Ho Chi Minh. Son joined the ICP in 1945. He was the first Cambodian who joined the Vietnamese dominated organization. After commanding the Cambodian communist to fight the French in the First Indochina War, Son moved to northern Vietnam in 1955 and died in 1972. In 1950, as a representative of the Cambodia communist, Son Ngoc Minh met Viet Minh‚Äôs representatives with Sieu Heng, Tou Samouth and others at Hatien, southern Vietnam, which near Cambodian border. He analysed the revolutionary situation in Cambodia and stated due to the weak ‚Äúprinciple force‚Äù, Cambodia could hardly have a revolution. Later, the ‚ÄúFirst National Congress of Khmer Resistance‚Äù was held in Cambodia, on the meeting, Khmer Issarak Association and People‚Äôs Liberation Central Committee (PLCC) was founded. Minh was the president of the PLCC, which consisted of all former ICP members. Two months later, as the Viet Minh guided-Issarak controlled one third of the Cambodian territory, Minh declared Cambodia‚Äôs independence, three years before Sihanouk‚Äôs government gained independence from France. =Tou Samouth= Achar Sok was an outstanding Buddhist scholar and active communist, who took a revolutionary name of Tou Samouth in 1948. At the time of his assassination, he was the secretary of the CPK‚Äôs central committee, interior minister of the Committee of Liberation of the Southeast. Years before his assassination in 1962, Tou Samouth was a patron of a young French educated Khmer, who work as Tou Samouth‚Äôs secretary. The young man was Saloth Sar, better known as Pol Pot after the establishment of Democratic Kampuchea. Legacy of the Issarak movement =The KPLC= On 1 February 1948, the Issarak movement formed the Khmer People's Liberation Committee with Chhuon as its president. Five of its eleven leaders were sympathetic to the Vietnamese, which eliminated certain elements of the Issarak movement. Though Chhuon was nominally anti-communist, the organisation also had two important Viet Minh supporters: Sieu Heng, who was the head of the ICP North-Western branch, and his nephew Long Bunruot. By this time the Viet Minh was leading a concerted attempt to foster Issarak's anti-colonialism and to turn it into support for communism in general, and Vietnamese communism in particular. This was especially the case on the eastern side of the country, where guerrilla cells were often commanded by Vietnamese. On the other side of the country, Son Ngoc Minh returned from Thailand with enough weapons to equip a fairly large company. In 1947 he established the Liberation Committee of South-West Kampuchea (this is particularly of note, because by the end of the civil war of 1970-75 the south-west had one of the most powerful and well organised communist armies in Cambodia, and which would form the main core of Pol Pot's support). By late 1948 many areas of the country were under the effective control of powerful Issarak organisations. By 1949, however, the Issarak movement in this form was coming to an end: the French began to exploit the greed of some Issarak leaders by giving them colonial positions, while others went off to join more radical organisations. Chhuon's KPLC expelled Sieu Heng and the majority of the other leftists, and remodelled itself as the Khmer National Liberation Committee, with Prince Chantaraingsey as its military commander. Tou Samouth and the other leftist Issaraks formed the United Issarak Front, which had heavy Vietnamese involvement. Chhuon went over to the French, while Chantaraingsey eventually left the KNLC and aligned with the right-wing, anti-monarchical Khmer nationalists, the Khmer Serai, under Son Ngoc Thanh. The Khmer Issarak were notorious for their violence during this period, known for torture, banditry and summary executions. =Foundation of the Democratic Kampuchea= Not only would the guerrilla tactics and organisation of the Issarak forces be mimicked by the communist forces during the Cambodian Civil War, but many later communists were first introduced to the concepts of Marxist-Leninism whilst involved with the Issaraks. In the eastern area of Cambodia, the leaders of those Viet Minh-influenced forces remained largely unchanged up to and beyond the establishment of Democratic Kampuchea. Until purged by Pol Pot in 1976, their forces not only wore differing uniforms to those of Pol Pot loyalists, but were noted to be exemplary in their treatment of the civilian population and to retain a certain degree of loyalty to Sihanouk.

The Poor Poet, by Carl Spitzweg, 1839. (Neue Pinakothek) Attic in Berlin, Germany. An attic (sometimes referred to as a loft) is a space found directly below the pitched roof of a house or other building; an attic may also be called a sky parlor or a garret. Because attics fill the space between the ceiling of the top floor of a building and the slanted roof, they are known for being awkwardly shaped spaces with exposed rafters and difficult-to-reach corners. While some attics are converted into bedrooms, home offices, or attic apartments complete with windows and staircases, most remain difficult to access (and are usually entered using a loft hatch and ladder). Attics are generally used for storage, though they can also help control temperatures in a house by providing a large mass of slowly moving air. The hot air rising from the lower floors of a building is often retained in attics, further compounding their reputation as inhospitable environments. However, in recent years attics have been insulated to help decrease heating costs, since, on average, uninsulated attics account for 15 percent of the total energy loss in average houses.Attic Insulation retrieved 24 October 2016 A loft is also the uppermost space in a building but is distinguished from an attic in that an attic typically constitutes an entire floor of the building, while a loft covers only a few rooms, leaving one or more sides open to the lower floor. Etymology The word \\"attic\\" is derived from the Attica region of Greece and comes from Attic style architecture. The term referred to \\"a low decorative fa√ßade above the main story of a building\\" and, as used in the phrase \\"attic order\\", had originally indicated a small decorative column above a building's main fa√ßade.\\"attic\\" (etymology). etymonline.com Ventilation Louvered attic vent in a gable.Modern building codes permit both vented and unvented attics in all climates, if a building is otherwise correctly constructed. However, unoccupied attics should usually be ventilated to reduce the accumulation of heat and moisture that contribute to mold growth and decay of wood rafters and ceiling joists. In cold climates ventilation also helps to prevent ice-dams on the roof and leaks that they cause. In hot climates, ventilation reduces cooling loads. Sometimes an insulated roof with an internal vapor barrier is preferable to a ventilated attic. In areas with wildfire hazards, sparks can enter attic vents, so houses are safer without vents. Areas with wind-driven rain, fog or sea-spray might also prefer houses with insulated roofs instead of vents. A habitable attic, or a habitable room without an attic may use an insulated roof so that moist air from the habitable area cannot condense on the roofing materials. Also, a building with a complex roof or many piercings between the conditioned area and the attic might control condensation better or more cheaply with an insulated roof and a vapor barrier. One common code requirement is that the total area of attic vents be equal to or greater than 1/150 of the floor area of the attic, with 50 percent or more of the vent area located in the upper portion of the attic. Vents and louvers should face away from prevailing winds to keep out driven rain. Soffit vents under the eaves normally provide the low vents. Louvered vents in gables can provide the high vents in small houses or short gables. If a ridge is open, some metal roofing systems can install ridge vents along the entire ridge line of the roof. Various types of turbine ventilators and exhaust fans can assist with attic ventilation and decrease the required area of passive ventilators.

The neighborhood is surrounded by Druid Hill Park, the Whitelock Community, and Lower Park Heights. Included within its boundaries are Frederick Douglass High School, and Mondawmin Mall. The Baltimore Metro Subway serves the neighborhood, with a station at Mondawmin Mall that is also a hub for many bus routes. Location The neighborhood is bounded by Longwood Street and Hilton Parkway to the west, Liberty Heights Avenue and Druid Park Drive to the north, Druid Hill Park and Fulton Avenue to the east, and North Avenue to the south. It occupies part or all of the zip codes 21215, 21216, and 21217. Description Mondawmin is perhaps the most diverse square mile in Baltimore in terms of social class. It is a historically African American community composed of young professionals, retirees, and working people, where each block has its own character. Some streets are lined with trees and marble steps, front porches and gardens. The neighborhood clusters around Mondawmin Mall, an urban shopping mall, and features schools ranging from elementary to four-year college, green space on wide boulevards and small streets, convenient small businesses, many active churches and dedicated neighborhood associations. Mondawmin is a community rich in character and history.

Nearby professional and college institutions include Urban Medical Institute, Coppin State University, and one of two campuses of Baltimore City Community College. The neighborhood is five minutes by car from the nearest light rail station; the area is also served by the Maryland Transit Administration's Mondawmin Shuttle Bug bus. It is exploring a more comprehensive regional shuttle system. Housing stock Most of the neighborhood's residential areas consist of brick rowhouses. Those built before World War II have large front porches and in some cases Victorian styling. Those built after the war tend to be two-story brick structures on wider lots than generally found in the inner city. A few single dwellings near the Walbrook neighborhood reflect their origins as summer homes built in the early 20th century. History The area was estate countryside in the 19th century, characterized by large homes built by prominent city residents on the hilly countryside several hundred feet above the Inner Harbor area. Mondawmin takes its name from the estate owned by Dr. Patrick Macaulay (1795‚Äì1849), physician, city councilman, B&O; Railroad director and patron of the arts. Tradition relates that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow visited Dr. Macaulay, who asked him what to name his home, then surrounded by corn fields. The poet allegedly looked around and replied, \\"Why not Mondamin, after the Indian corn god?\\" (Mapmakers later added a \\"w\\" to the name, and it stuck.) The area known as Southern Mondawmin prides itself on a long history of stable homeownership. Many residents moved into the community in the late forties and early fifties as the area developed as the cultural and education center for African Americans. Robert W. Coleman, one of the community's renowned residents, established the first school for the blind for African Americans, at a time when public facilities and schools were segregated. Because of those early pioneers and the stability of the community, Southern Mondawmin was never designated as an urban renewal area. While the community has changed over the past 15 years, residents, churches, businesses, and community associations are diligently working to return the area to its early luster. Recently, Southern Mondawmin was chosen by Baltimore city's government as one of six Healthy Neighborhoods. Parts of the community are included as part of the empowerment zone.

In certain light environments glossy displays provide better color intensity and contrast ratios than matte displays. The primary disadvantage of these displays is their tendency to reflect any external light, often resulting in an undesirable glare.Thatcher, Michelle. \\"Counter the glare on your glossy display\\". CNET. October 23, 2006. Retrieved December 3, 2007.  Technology  Some LCDs use an antireflective coating to reduce the amount of external light reflecting from the surface without affecting light emanating from the screen as an alternative to matte display.\\"PixelBright LCDs\\". ScreenTek. Retrieved December 3, 2007.  Disadvantages  Because of the reflective nature of the display, in most lighting conditions that include direct light sources facing the screen, glossy displays create reflections, which can be distracting to the user of the computer. This can be especially distracting to users working in an environment where the position of lights and windows is fixed, such as in an office, as these create unavoidable reflections on glossy displays.  Adverse health effects  Ergonomic studies had shown that prolonged work in the office environment with the presence of discomforting glares and disturbances from light reflections on the screen can be a cause of mild to severe adverse health effects, ranging from eye strain and headaches to photosensitive epileptic episodes. These effects are usually explained by physiology of human eye and human visual system. The image of light sources reflected in the screen can cause the human visual system to focus on that image, which is usually at a much farther distance than the information shown on the screen. This competition between two images that can be focused is considered to be the primary source of such effects.  Advantages  In controlled environments, such as darkened rooms, or rooms where all light sources are diffused, glossy displays create more saturated colors, deeper blacks, brighter whites, and are sharper than matte displays. This is why supporters of glossy screens consider these types of displays more appropriate for viewing photographs and watching films. Johnson, Joel. \\"LCD Monitors: Glossy vs. Matte\\" .

Leonard Ingrams was the youngest of four sons. His parents were Leonard St Clair Ingrams, who served in the Secret Service during the Second World War, and Victoria (n√©e Reid). His mother was very musical and he started to learn the violin at the age of six. Later he played in the National Youth Orchestra under Sir Malcolm Sargent. He was educated at Stonyhurst College, where he was inspired by Peter Levi, and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He gained a double first in Classical Moderations and Greats. Subsequently he taught classics at Queen Mary College, University of London from 1965 to 1967. In 1967 Leonard Ingrams joined Barings as an international financier. After postings to Paris, Cologne and Hamburg, in 1974 he was posted to Saudi Arabia. After five years living in Jeddah he and his family moved to Italy where he studied the viola under Bruno Giuranna in Siena. After this short break (of less than a year) he then went back to Saudi Arabia and lived in Riyadh, where he worked as Supreme Financial Advisor to the Saudi Arabian Government. In 1984 he came back to England and started to work as a Director at Flemings. After working for Flemings for about 10 years he went back to the Middle East to work in Bahrain (1995-1999), before returning to England permanently and setting up his own investment consultancy: L.V.Ingrams & Co. In 1982, Ingrams and his wife moved to Garsington Manor on the edge of the village of Garsington east of Oxford, England. He later became well known for founding Garsington Opera in 1989, an annual season of opera in the manor gardens, designed by Lady Ottoline Morrell during the First World War. Under his musical directorship the opera company became known for world class productions. Ingrams would travel extensively to seek out singers for particular roles, and under his leadership the Garsington Opera orchestra was established, with its core from the Guildhall Strings. Ingrams married Rosalind Moore in 1964, after she had also graduated in Classics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford and was beginning her Masters' thesis on Rubens under the supervision of Edgar Wind. Leonard Ingrams died suddenly after a heart attack at the age of 63 in 2005. The couple had a son and three daughters. Ingrams also has a surviving elder brother, Richard Ingrams, one of the founders of the satirical magazine Private Eye.

Beazley shot Luttig in the head twice in his garage on April 19, 1994 to steal his Mercedes Benz. Beazley also shot at Luttig's wife, but he missed and she survived the assault by playing dead. Beazley carried out the crime with two accomplices, Cedrick and Donald Coleman, who later testified against him. Both were sentenced to 80 years in prison. The case of Beazley, the eldest son of Ireland and Rena Beazley of Grapeland, Texas, is notable because Napoleon was just under 18 years of age (17 years, eight and one-half months old, to be exact) at the time of the offense and because his victim was the father of a United States federal judge, J. Michael Luttig. During his appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court, three of the nine justices recused themselves because of their personal ties to Judge Luttig, leaving six justices to review the case. Justice Antonin Scalia recused himself because Luttig had clerked for him, while Justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas recused themselves because Luttig had led the successful efforts to gain them (Thomas and Souter) U.S. Senate confirmation to the Supreme Court. On June 3, 1997, Beazley filed an application for state writ of habeas corpus with the state trial court of conviction. On September 5, 1997, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing. On October 31, 1997, the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law denying habeas relief. On January 21, 1998, the Court of Criminal Appeals accepted findings, but they turned down relief. On October 1, 1998, Beazley filed a petition for habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. On September 30, 1999, SCOTUS denies relief. On October 26, 1999, the district court turned down reconsideration. On December 28, 1999, the district court allowed Beazley to make an appeal. On June 1, 2000, Beazley filed his brief on appeal to the Fifth Circuit. On February 9, 2001, the Fifth Circuit issued a published opinion asserting the denial of habeas relief. On March 15, 2001, the Fifth Circuit turned down Beazley's petition for rehearing. On March 30, 2001, Beazley's execution was determined to be on Aug. 15, 2001 by the District Court of Smith County, Texas. On June 13, 2001, Beazley petitioned for certiorari review from the denial of federal habeas relief. On June 28, 2001, Beazley applied for a stay of execution from the U.S. Supreme Court. On August 13, 2001, the United States Supreme Court turned down Beazley's application for stay of execution. On August 15, 2001, the Court of Criminal Appeals granted a stay of execution on the day of Beazley's execution. On October 1, 2001- The United States Supreme Court turns down certiorari review. On April 17, 2002, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals vacates the stay of execution. On April 26, 2002, Beazley's execution was determined to be on May 28, 2002 by The District Court of Smith County, Texas. On May 7, 2002, Beazley files a petition for clemency with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. On May 13, 2002, Beazley files a supplemental petition for clemency. On May 17, 2002, Beazley along with 3 others file 1983 suit in the U.S. District Court pleading inadequate representation. (That same day, U.S. District Judge Hayden Head declined to hear the lawsuit. A notice of appeal was filed.) On May 21, 2002, the Fifth Circuit administered an opinion asserting the lower court's judgment, turning down injunctive relief. On May 22, 2002, Beazley petitions for certiorari review to the United States Supreme Court. On August 13, 2001, the Court voted 3-3 on Beazley's request for a stay of execution. The tie vote resulted in the Fifth Circuit's decision standing, and effectively rejecting Beazley's request for a stay. On May 28, 2002, the Court voted unanimously 6-0 to reject Beazley's request for a writ of habeas corpus. Beazley's execution sparked a fierce debate between opponents and supporters of the death penalty, particularly with respect to juvenile offenders. Some organizations, such as Amnesty International, argued in favor of clemency due to his age (Beazley was at the time of the offense 3¬Ω months from his 18th birthday) and their opposition to the death penalty in general. Beazley was one of the last juvenile offenders to be executed in the United States. In 2005, the Supreme Court (in Roper v. Simmons) banned the practice of executing offenders who were under the age of 18 when they committed their crimes..

He is the author of a satirical poem entitled The Ring (ca. 1410). He may be identical to an advocate to the bishop of Konstanz, mentioned in 1395. He may be of the family of the former rulers of Wittenwil in the Thurgau, who became destitute and abandoned their castle in 1339. Throughout the early 15th century, most bearers of the name lived in the Toggenburg, probably including one of the scribes of the Cgm 558. The Ring is a poem of 9699 lines, preserved in a single manuscript, apparently an autograph of Wittenwiler's. Each line is marked with either red or green ink. In the prologue (verse 40f.) Wittenwiler explains that the red line marks \\"serious\\" material, while the green marks t√∂rpelleben (literally \\"village life\\", in the sense of \\"rusticity, peasantry, buffoonery\\"), but the actual division between \\"red\\" and \\"green\\" material is far from straightforward. The protagonists are Bertschi Triefnas and M√§tzli R√ºerenzumph, two peasant lovers of Lappenhausen, a fictitious village in the Black Forest. The handsome Bertschi woos the ugly M√§tzli with knightly pretensions. The wedding involves a \\"peasant tournament\\" and escalates into wild brawling, leading to a war between villages and the destruction of Lappenhausen.

Traditionally, local telephone service was provided by small companies based in given cities and towns as opposed to larger, national or international companies. Telephone calls outside of the local area provided for by these companies were patched through long-distance networks that were, until de-regulation, operation mainly by AT&T.; Some providers of local services were regional Bell operating companies, but not all local telephone companies were a regional Bell operating company or tied to one at the local level, especially after de- regulation of 1996. After de-regulation, these regional Bell operating companies continued providing the same technical services despite being under a different type of corporate structure. Many communities in the United States had local telephone companies and in rural areas, up until around the early 1980s (perhaps later in some cases) party lines were commonplace. The local telephone company was responsible for providing equipment and services to their customers in most cases although over time, as technology changed, so did the nature of the technical services thus provided. At one time telephones were leased from the local phone company rather than sold outright to customers. Many customers had rotary telephones that were leased prior to the 1980s. Customers in some instances ended up paying tenfold the value of their phones as they leased them for decades‚Äîthough the lease system was not set up to encourage this situation. Local telephone companies also provided PBX (Private Branch Exchange) services for local businesses that needed these switchboard and internal telecommunications services. Local telephone companies more recently become involved in providing Internet by DSL and dial- up services. Local telephone wires terminate at the central office (telephone exchange), a structure containing the hardware needed to switch calls among local lines and long-distance networks. Thus, when a call was placed by a customer outside the local calling area, the central office would switch the call to the respective long-distance network. As technology advanced, central offices offered more services and their technical abilities improved. Services such as Caller ID, call return call-waiting, three-way calling, and voice-mail were first offered via central office-based technology although later PBXs also provided them. The role of the local phone company includes serving a given community and interfacing with the large long-distance carriers. Prior to the advent of cell phones, most phone calls were made via landlines and local companies were thereby involved in some capacity in this communication. Deregulation and especially cell phones have reduced the need for local telephone services while Digital subscriber line Internet service and other services give local companies new roles in the telecommunications industry.

Hydathodes occur in the leaves of submerged aquatic plants such as Ranunculus fluitans as well as herbaceous plants of drier habitats such as Campanula rotundifolia. They are connected to the plant vascular system by a vascular bundle. Hydathodes are commonly seen in water lettuce, water hyacinth, rose, balsam, and many other species. Hydathodes are made of a group of living cells with numerous intercellular spaces filled with water, but few or no chloroplasts, and represent modified bundle-ends. These cells (called epithem cells) open out into one or more sub-epidermal chambers. These, in turn, communicate with the exterior through an open water stoma or open pore. The water stoma structurally resembles an ordinary stoma, but is usually larger and has lost the power of movement. Hydathodes are involved in the process of guttation, in which positive xylem pressure (due to root pressure) causes liquid to exude from the pores. Some halophytes possess glandular trichomes that actively secrete salt in order to reduce the concentration of cytotoxic inorganic ions in their cytoplasm; this may lead to the formation of a white powdery substance on the surface of the leaf. Hydathodes are of two types: # passive hydathodes, formed when a leaf vein terminates in an epithem (an area of thin- walled parenchyma). # active hydathodes, formed when epidermal cells lose water actively.

Produced by RT√â Cork, and broadcast on RT√â One for around 30 minutes, it is presented by Anne Cassin and Mary Kennedy. Nationwide focuses on human interest stories and cultural events across the country. In 2019, Mary Kennedy stepped down from presenting Nationwide, as she reached the mandatory retirement age set by RT√â. Blathn√°id N√≠ Chofaigh took over presenting duties alongside current presenter Anne Cassin in January 2020. Format Nationwide serves a similar purpose to the occasional RT√â attempts to regionalise news and human interest content in the past, albeit without the increased technology and transmission costs, which would likely require total re-engineering of the country's transmission and cable television networks. Nationwide itself was the sole programme regionalised in recent times, but this has now ceased. History Nationwide began broadcasting in 1993. It is the brainchild of Michael Ryan, who presented for many years until he retired from RT√â in 2011. On occasion he was replaced by news reporter Flo McSweeney. In its early years, Nationwide was largely made up of regional stories from RT√â's local news correspondents. The series was presented from a studio from 1993 until 2000 when the series began to tour towns and cities around the country. The original series studio came from the city of Waterford, as Micheal Ryan was RT√â Regional correspondent in the 1990s. The series then moved to Cork and became an RT√â Cork production. During its original run it was broadcast every second Sunday, pre-record in a room rented by Micheal Ryan from a Photographer in Waterford City, later it would move to RT√â's Cork Studios. By the end of the 1990s the series was being broadcast 3 night a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 19:00 and the presentation of the show took place in local towns and cities across the country. Cartoonist Terry Willers had a regional paper slot every Friday up until the end of the 1990s. Ryan was joined in 2004 by Mary Kennedy as a co- presenter. Ryan retired from Nationwide in 2011, with the announcement that Anne Cassin would replace him as co-presenter after the ending of her current role as presenter of a Dublin-based series called Capital D. As part of its 20th anniversary, RT√â commissioned Brian Byrne to compose a new theme for Nationwide. The music was recorded by the RT√â Concert Orchestra. New opening credits were created by Nobo's Niall √ì hOisin and Niall Campion with footage filmed by RT√â Cameraman Paul Deighan. Correspondents Alastair Jackson, Ciaran Malluly, Helen McInerney, Rowan Hand, Mary Fannin, Deirdre McCarthy, and Zainab Boladale.

Convoy PQ-12 sailed from Reykjav√≠k for Murmansk on 1 March, escorted by the battlecruiser , the battleship , the cruiser and six destroyers under command of Vice-Admiral Alban Curteis. Convoy QP-8 left Murmansk on the return route at about the same time, expecting to pass PQ-12 near Bear Island. Additional naval forces, the battleship , the aircraft carrier , the cruiser and six destroyers, sailed from Scapa Flow on 6 March to join Vice-Admiral Curteis near Jan Mayen Island. Tirpitz left F√¶ttenfjord on 5 March, in response to a report from a spotter plane and was joined by Admiral Otto Ciliax and an escort of three destroyers on the following day. In turn, the German movements were reported by a British submarine. Despite using her destroyers to sweep for the convoys, Tirpitz missed QP-8. A slow freighter, Izhora, was caught by the destroyers and sunk after reporting the attack. The German and British forces and the two convoys managed to move around each other in the vicinity of Bear Island without meeting or being seen by spotter aircraft. Advice from German High Command and the British Admiralty added to the confusion of the commanders on the spot. Eventually, on 9 March, aircraft from Victorious spotted and shadowed the German flotilla, despite being attacked by Tirpitz's aircraft. The consequent air attacks were unsuccessful but encouraged the Germans to return to Norway. The two convoys reached port safely but the incident had demonstrated the threat that convoys faced. In March and April, 1942, RAF Bomber Command made three unsuccessful attacks on Tirpitz.

Built in 1960 and demolished in 1992‚Äì93, the arena had a capacity of 4,000 people. It was named after Paul Sauv√© (March 24, 1907 ‚Äì January 2, 1960), a Quebec Premier with the Union Nationale. The arena hosted some of the most important events in modern Quebec political history. It was the site of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois election victory celebrations on November 15, 1976 and on April 13, 1981. Additionally, it was the site of two of the most important moments of the 1980 referendum. On May 14, 1980 Pierre Trudeau delivered his \\"first among equals\\" speech that was his major contribution to the campaign battle, and Ren√© L√©vesque delivered his passionate concession speech on May 20, 1980. The Paul Sauv√© Arena was, most popularly, the home to Quebec professional wrestling. In the mid-1960s, Johnny Rougeau and partner Bob Langevin created \\"Les As de la Lutte\\" (Wrestling Aces) and made the arena its main venue for wrestling shows, which ran from 1965 to 1975. The arena was also home to a founding franchise in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. The Rosemont National played two seasons (from 1969 to 1971, finishing 8th and 9th) before moving to Laval. In the late 1960s the Montreal Canadiens lacrosse team played in the arena, and rock concerts including those performed by Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and Eric Burdon and The Animals. Finally, boxing was always a big draw, and the arena saw many memorable fights. On a more prestigious note, it also hosted preliminary volleyball matches at the 1976 Summer Olympics. Before decay, costs and low attendances doomed the arena, it was used for curling hall, and later a bingo hall, a gymnasium, a bowling alley, and trade shows.

Despite this difficult beginning, MacColl's intellectual exertions enabled himself - and his younger brother Hugh (see below) - to succeed in obtaining an education of sorts. MacColl claimed Jacobite descent and seems to have espoused High Anglican theological beliefs from a very early age. His native language was Scots Gaelic. MacColl won a place at Trinity College, Glenalmond, for the Scottish Episcopal ministry. He was ordained a priest of the Episcopal Church in 1857. In May 1858 he approached William Ewart Gladstone in a letter warning him about measures against High Church bishops in the Scottish Episcopal Church, but also alluded to his own extremely precarious financial circumstances.** MacColl tenaciously refused to let this correspondence die and eventually managed to meet Gladstone. From this slender beginning there developed a lifelong friendship and political alliance. Throughout the rest of MacColl's life, Gladstone secured preferment, most of it fairly modest, for his prot√©g√©. However MacColl never rose very high in the Anglican Church, mainly, no doubt, because of his refusal to compromise his Anglo-Catholic theological views. Gladstone's first piece of assistance was to facilitate the young MacColl's transfer from Scotland to London and the Church of England. MacColl was received as a priest of the Church of England in 1859, and then entered on a succession of curacies in the Church of England, in London and at Addington, Bucks. He also served between 1864 and 1867 as the Chaplain of the British Embassy in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Naples. After his arrival in London, MacColl began to publish articles immediately, writing with increasing proficiency. His earliest writings were almost entirely on ecclesiastical and theological matters. In 1875, he published a blockbuster on disputes within his church entitled \\"Lawlessness, Sacerdotalism and Ritualism\\". It was an extremely skilful attack on the Protestant establishment in the Church of England and made his name. Most of MacColl's writings centre on the question of the \\"Real Presence\\" of the Blessed Sacrament and the related issue of Apostolic succession of clergy. Despite limited knowledge of foreign languages, he also maintained contact with continental Roman Catholic dissidents after the First Vatican Council, such as the Croatian, Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer of Diakova, and Dr Ignaz von D√∂llinger in Munich, acting as a discreet intermediary between them and Gladstone. Both Strossmayer and Dollinger were strongly interested in the \\"Eastern Question\\" and the ending of Turkish rule in the Balkans. This, as well as similar currents of opinion in the Liberal Party, may have been responsible for MacColl's own interest in combatting Turkish political power during the last three decades of his life. From 1876 onwards, MacColl was an active defender of the Christian inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire, writing a series of vitriolic attacks on Turkey and its friends in Britain in letters to newspapers, articles in reviews, and publishing several books. All of these productions were closely researched, usually relying on British \\"Blue Book\\" collections of consular despatches, though always written with an eye to making a case for the prosecution. In August 1876, soon after the exposure of the killings of up to 15,000 Bulgarians the previous spring by Circassian irregulars in the Ottoman army, MacColl and Canon Liddon of St. Paul's travelled to Vienna and Serbia on a fact-finding tour. During a boatride on the River Sava, then the frontier between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire, the two clergymen claimed to have seen an impaled human corpse. Though their testimony could not be independently confirmed, and was challenged by the local British Consul who suggested that the object in question might have been only a bag of beans, MacColl and Liddon used this sighting as proof of the iniquity of Turkish rule in the Balkans. This fitted in with a theme in their sermons that those in Britain (such as Gladstone's arch-opponent Benjamin Disraeli) who did not actively oppose Turkish rule were themselves guilty of its sins. In his private correspondent with Gladstone after the Bulgarian atrocities, MacColl urged the Liberal leader to denounce the Ottomans and is perhaps partly responsible for the powerful speeches Gladstone made on the issue in the last months of 1876 and early 1877. MacColl published two major works during these years on the issue himself. \\"The Eastern Question: Its Facts and Fallacies\\" appeared in the spring of 1877 and ran through five editions. \\"Three Years of the Eastern Question\\" followed in the early autumn of 1878 immediately after the Congress of Berlin had ended. After returning to power Gladstone rewarded MacColl with the living of St. Georges, Botolph Lane, in 1871, and with a canonry of Ripon in 1884. The latter posting aroused the active opposition of Queen Victoria who had not forgotten or forgiven MacColl's virulent campaign against the Ottoman Empire in 1876-78 after the 'Bulgarian Agitation'. The living at Ripon was practically a sinecure. MacColl maintained a large house at Kirby Overblow, south of Harrogate, and continued to devote himself to political pamphleteering and newspaper correspondence, the result of extensive European travel, a wide acquaintance with the leading personages of the day, strong views on ecclesiastical subjects from a high-church standpoint, and particularly on the politics of the Eastern Question, the uprising in Crete, then still an Ottoman province, the cause of the Armenians and Islam. In the first years of the twentieth century, MacColl was an active opponent of Muslim spokesmen such as Syed Ameer Ali and the Turkish writer Halil Halid and sometimes admonished them on doctrinal points of their religion, arguing for instance that the Sultan of Turkey was not the Caliph of all Muslims. He was on close terms with the King of Greece, George I, and leaders of the Armenian movement and during the Turkish-Greek War of April 1897, he visited Athens to confer with the King, conveying the monarch's private views both to Gladstone and also to the Conservative Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury. In 1904 MacColl married Consuelo Albinia Crompton-Stansfield. He died in London on 5 April 1907. In his will, MacColl left his library to the Gladstone collection at Hawarden. MacColl had a younger brother, Hugh MacColl. Early on in their friendship, he had tried to persuade Gladstone to pay for Hugh to be educated at Oxford. However this project was frustrated when Hugh refused to agree to become an Anglican priest as Gladstone insisted and so went without a university education. Despite this setback, Hugh MacColl nevertheless became one of the most significant figures in the history of symbolic logic before Gottlob Frege.

It was initially very similar to LimeWire in appearance and functionality, but over time developers added more features, including support for the BitTorrent protocol. In version 5, support for the Gnutella network was dropped entirely, and FrostWire became a BitTorrent-only client.  History  FrostWire, a BitTorrent client (formerly a Gnutella client), is a collaborative, open-source project licensed under the GNU General Public License. In late 2005, concerned developers of LimeWire's open source community announced the start of a new project fork \\"FrostWire\\" that would protect the developmental source code of the LimeWire client. FrostWire has evolved to replace LimeWire's BitTorrent core for that of Vuze, the Azureus BitTorrent Engine, and ultimately to remove the LimeWire's Gnutella core to become a 100% BitTorrent client powered by the libtorrent library through FrostWire's jLibtorrent Java wrapper library since August 2014. = Gnutella client = The project was started in September 2004 after LimeWire's distributor considered adding \\"blocking\\" code in response to RIAA pressure. The RIAA threatened legal action against several peer-to-peer developers including LimeWire as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.. The second beta release of FrostWire was available in the last quarter of 2005. = Multiprotocol P2P client = Since version 4.20.x, FrostWire was able to handle torrent files and featured a new junk filter. Also, in version 4.21.x support was added for most Android devices. = BitTorrent client = Since version 5.0 (2011), FrostWire relaunched itself as a BitTorrent application, so those using the Gnutella network either have to use version 4, or switch to another client altogether. =Preview before download= Since version 6.0, FrostWire adds preview files before download. =Adware and malware= Since around 2008 some members of the FrostWire community began to notice the distribution of the optional Ask.com toolbar in the Windows installers.http://forum.frostwire.se/viewtopic.php?f=4&t;=4834 On September 9, 2015 the official knowledge base claimed that FrostWire no longer distributes the Ask.com toolbar, and provided instructions on how to remove it.http://support.frostwire.se/hc/en-us/articles/200057329-How-do-I-uninstall- the-Ask-Toolbar- Around 2019, Frostwire has been noted to install other adware and malware, such as the browser hijacker WebDiscover.  FrostWire 4 Legacy Software based in the original FrostWire source (gnutella enabled) still exists, for example WireShare, a gnutella client that forked from the original FrostWire/LimeWire source in 2010, with the purpose of keeping the Gnutella network alive and to maintain a continuation of the original project (without adware, spyware and backdoors). FrostWire for Android FrostWire/FrostWire Plus for Android (also known as FrostWire Downloader) is a native Android-based BitTorrent client, with additional support for downloading videos and music from YouTube. The application is based on the P2P BitTorrent network, with support for downloading music, movies, applications, as well as other content. The application also has support for downloading music from the cloud-based service SoundCloud, and includes a featured Music Library & Music Player. The most recent version, 2.1.9 build 637, was made available on March 5, 2020. Features Features present in FrostWire include: * True In-App Search (Cloud Downloader + BitTorrent Client). FrostWire currently directly searches the following sources: YouTube, SoundCloud, Archive.org, PirateBay.org (finishing and list all). Results matching user's keywords are shown inside the app, separated into tabs by file type (Audio, Video, ....).

It has carried the name RAF Biggin Hill in preservation, though it never carried this in service. Number 5110 was built in 1935 by the Vulcan Foundry. It was built with a low-degree superheat domeless boiler and still carries a domeless boiler. Fifteen Guinea Special The locomotive was one of three members of the class to haul the Fifteen Guinea Special, British Railways' last steam- hauled passenger train, on 11 August 1968. It took the first leg from Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Victoria at the beginning of the tour before running from Manchester Victoria to Liverpool Lime Street with the returning train at the end of the day's tour. This locomotive was used in place of sister engine 45305 which had been selected for this duty, but had been failed with a collapsed firebox brick arch the night before the run, and had been withdrawn prematurely as a result. Use in preservation After hauling the Fifteen Guinea Special, 45110 was purchased straight from service for preservation by David Porter of the ‚ÄúFlairavia Flying Club‚Äù at Biggin Hill Airport. It moved temporarily to the former BR Ashford shed, and then to the Severn Valley Railway in 1970; it was subsequently bought by the SVR, and has since been based at the line's locomotive depots at Bridgnorth and Bewdley. Between 1994 and 1998, when the engine itself was undergoing a major overhaul at Bridgnorth, 45110's tender was used behind LMS Stanier Mogul 42968 (then in LMS livery as 2968), whilst its own Fowler tender had a twisted frame problem ironed out. Following a return to service on 11 August 1998, the engine was main line registered, and did haul several main line steam specials on the national rail network, but after failing twice on a railtour to Stranraer in May 2000, the engine was confined to heritage rail operation only. It was hoped to have run 45110 on the 2008 recreation of the Fifteen Guinea Special, but this was not possible as the engine was due to come out of ticket on 11 August, the same day as the Fifteen Guinea Special re-run, and so a competition was offered by Steam Railway magazine to drive the engine on 11 August. Despite this, the engine was given an extension to its 10-year boiler ticket up to the end of August, at the end of which, the loco was withdrawn after 10 years of service. In 2009-10, 45110 was placed on static display at Barrow Hill Roundhouse to take advantage of the available under cover storage. It was planned that the locomotive would remain at Barrow Hill for up to two years on loan from the Severn Valley Railway, which would see its return to the SVR in 2011-12, but in 2010 the engine's tender was recalled back to the SVR to be used once again behind 42968, after the 2-6-0's own tender developed wheelflats. 45110's tender remained in use behind 42968 until early 2012, when 42968 regained its own tender for the last year of its own 10 year boiler ticket, which expired in January 2013. 45110 returned to Bridgnorth on 30 September 2013, entering The Engine House at Highley on 6 October 2013 in place of 4930 Hagley Hall, which had just been moved to Bridgnorth for the start of a major overhaul. 45110 briefly left the Engine House in order to appear as a static exhibit at Kidderminster in August 2018 in an event marking 50 years since the end of BR steam, returning to the Engine House in September 2018. In March 2019 the locomotive was moved into store at Kidderminster.

His gang's most notorious robbery was probably $3,500 in currency, $500 in diamonds, hundreds of dollars' worth of jewelry and 700 pounds of gold dust, nuggets and bullion from a special treasure coach called the \\"Monitor\\" belonging to the Homestake Mine in October 1878.

Some historians attribute that particular gang's leadership to Charles Carey, who was subsequently hanged at the Jenny Stockade. Vigilantes went on an outlaw hunting spree following the ambush and robbery of the Monitor at Canyon Springs Station. Lame Johnny was later apprehended and hung in June 1879 by a group of vigilantes that quite likely included Daniel Boone May, who was a stage coach \\"messenger\\" (hired guard,) gunman, and part-time lawman in the Black Hills area. May was an outrider on the coach carrying Lame Johnny to Custer City for trial. According to the stage driver and accompanying lawman Whispering Smith, May mysteriously disappeared just before the stage was stopped at gunpoint by a lone masked men. Lame Johnny was dragged from the coach, and the stage was sent on its way. According to some sources, Lame Johnny was threatened with hanging by the vigilantes if he didn't tell them the location of his ill-gotten treasure.

Sases, also known as Gondophares IV Sases, (ruled for at least 26 years during the mid-1st century CESee main Indo-Parthian page for references to Robert Senior's modern chronology), was an Indo-Parthian king who ruled in northwestern parts of India in modern Pakistan. He is only known from coins. Sases apparently succeeded Abdagases in Sindh and Gandhara, and at some point during his reign assumed the name/title Gondophares, which was held by the supreme Indo-Parthian rulers. His coins show the Greek deity Zeus, forming a benediction sign (possibly Vitarka mudra), and incorporate the Buddhist symbol of the triratana. With the modern datings supplied by Robert Senior, Gondophares IV is a likely candidate for several possible historical references to Indo-Parthian kings of the 1st century AD. Traditionally, these references have been thought to be about Gondophares I, as earlier scholars did not realise that \\"Gondophares\\" became a title after the death of this king, just as the name of the first emperor, Augustus, in the Roman Empire, was used by all later emperors as a title. Tradition of a visit by St. Thomas Buddhist reliquary with coinage, apparently of Sases.Metropolitan Museum of Art Item 38116 Sases inscribed a Buddhist triratna with his tamgha on some of his coins. Detail of the coins from the reliquary, showing the tamgha (top left) as well as triratna symbols (top right, top bottom). Also visible here. Tamgha of Gondophares-Sases (20-45 CE), also shared by Abdagases and most of the Gondopharids. One Gondophares is connected to St Thomas in early Christian traditions embodied in the Acts of Thomas. In it Thomas was sold in Syria to Habban, an envoy of Gondophares, and travelled in slavery by sea to India, was presented to Gondophares to undertake the erection of the building the king required: :\\"According to the lot, therefore, India fell unto Judas Thomas... And while he thus spake and thought, it chanced that there was there a certain merchant come from India whose name was Abbanes, sent from the King Gundaphorus, and having commandment from him to buy a carpenter and bring him unto him.\\" Acts of Thomas, I, 1-2 Acts of Thomas :\\"Now when the apostle was come into the cities of India with Abbanes the merchant, Abbanes went to salute the king Gundaphorus, and reported to him of the carpenter whom he had brought with him. And the king was glad, and commanded him to come in to him.\\" Acts of Thomas I, 17 Thomas instead spent all the king's money on alms, and as a consequence was imprisoned by him. Allegedly, Gondophares ultimately rehabilitated Thomas and recognized the validity of Christianity. Passing on to the realm of another king, named in the Syrian versions as \\"Mazdai\\" (thought to refer to the Kushan king Vasudeva), he allegedly suffered martyrdom before being redeemed. St Thomas thereafter went to Kerala and baptized the natives, whose descendants form the Saint Thomas Christians.James, M. R. (1966) \\"The Acts of Thomas\\" in The Apocryphal New Testament, pp. 365-377; 434-438. Oxford. The magnificent cathedral at Troyes in France is famous for its exquisite architecture and magnificent stained glass windows, one of which, apparently, has a representation of the famous Indo-Parthian king Gondophares.Bivar, A. D. H. (2007). \\"Gondophares and the Indo-Parthians,\\" p. 30. In: The Age of the Parthians. Edited by Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis and Sarah Stewart. Ib. Tauris, New York. . The material of much of the Acts as well as some of its unmistakably unorthodox theology, made its historicity dismissible for many centuries. \\"Gondophares\\" was dismissed as an invention. Then in 1854 General Alexander Cunningham reported (Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal vol.xxiii. pp. 679‚Äì712) that since the British had been in Afghanistan an estimated 30,000 coins bearing Greek and Indian legends had been found in Afghanistan and the Punjab. The mintings covered three centuries after the conquests of Alexander: coins in the hoards were minted for Scythian conquerors and for Parthian kings such as Gondophares, who thereby emerged from pious legend into history (Medlycott 1905), even though most of these coins belonged to the first Gondophares. Cunningham said that these coins were \\"highly interesting\\" on account of \\"the strong probability that this Gondophares is identical with the king Gandaforus who put Saint Thomas to death\\". He went on to say: > The great power of Gondophares, and discovery of a coin of Artabanus > countermarked with the peculiar monograph of all the Gondopharian dynasty, > make it highly probable that the Indo-Parthian Abdagases was the same as the > Parthian chief, whose revolt is recorded by Tacitus (Annal.

Gondophares with Nike standing behind, crowning him. It has also been suggested that one Gondophares may be identical with Phraotes, a Greek- speaking Indo-Parthian king of the city of Taxila, met by the Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana around 46 CE according to the Life of Apollonius Tyana written by Philostratus. The Gondophares who fits this date is Gondophares IV Sases. Like the Acts of Thomas it is doubted if there is any truth in the story given by Philostratus, and most scholars see Phroates as a stock name deployed by Philostratus in what is otherwise an opportunity for him to deploy his sophist training.Bracey, R \\"Pilgrim's Progress: The Acts of Thomas and the Life of Apollonius of Tyana\\" Kushan History References Category:Indo-Parthian Kingdom Category:1st-century monarchs in Asia Category:1st-century Iranian people ","title":"Sases"},{"id":"3023424","text":"The azure damselfly (Coenagrion puella) is a species of damselfly found in most of Europe. It is notable for its distinctive black and blue colouring. They are commonly found around ponds and lakesides during the summer. Morphology =Adults= Males Adult male azure damselflies have a head and thorax patterned with blue and black. They have an azure blue abdomen patterned with black markings. The marking on the second segment of the abdomen is U-shaped, separated from the segment's narrow terminal black band. (This distinguishes it from the variable damselfly where the U-shape is joined to the terminal band with a black line.) Segments three to five are blue with broader black terminal bands, lacking the forward-pointing projection the upper surface which adult male common blue damselfly has. Segment six has a similar pattern but with more restricted blue and a broader area of black, and segment seven is mostly black, with just a narrow blue area at the base. Segment eight and much of segment nine are sky-blue, forming a noticeable contrasting patch, but there are small dark markings on the rear upper side of segment nine, which adult male common blue damselfly does not possess.

It relied on black-and-white film footage, and may be considered a precursor to the later Thames Television World at War production. Only 47 episodes of the original series (1960-1973) survive whereas the later series (1987-89) survives complete. The series ran weekly from 1960 to 1973 and from 1987 to 1989. The format was a studio commentary, supported by newsreel clips that had been shown in cinemas 25 years ago that week. The final series concentrated on 1939. The years to 1964 focused on the build-up to the Second World War, mixed with more lighthearted fare. The series continued mostly with war footage from 1964 to 1970. A measure of comic relief was provided by wartime cartoons, especially by Osbert Lancaster for the Daily Express, with captions read by actors. The presenters were: * James Cameron ‚Äì 1960 to 1961 * Brian Inglis ‚Äì 1961 to 1973 * Bernard Braden ‚Äì 1987 to 1989 One wartime newsreel which found a new audience was \\"Hoch der Lambeth Valk\\".

It is located at an altitude of 925 m, in the Serra da Mantiqueira, a mountain range which runs mostly along the border of the state of S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais. It has a mild climate, being also a busy tourism spot, similarly to its close neighbours, the cities of Lind√≥ia and √Åguas de Lind√≥ia. History Serra Negra was founded on 23 September 1828, but at least a century before that the region was already inhabited and was on the passageway between S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais. It was elevated to the status of city on 21 April 1885. At the end of the 19th century, the region received a large influx of European immigrants, mostly Italians, who came to work on coffee farms. Mineral water sources were discovered by Luiz Rielli in 1928 and the city became a much sought-after spa town (it is known as the \\"City of Health\\").

Group C was a category of motorsport, introduced by the FIA in 1982 and continuing until 1993. Group C applied to sports car racing, with Group A for touring cars and Group B for GTs. It was designed to replace both Group 5 special production cars (closed top touring prototypes like Porsche 935) and Group 6 two-seat racing cars (open-top sportscar prototypes like Porsche 936). Group C was used in the FIA's World Endurance Championship (1982‚Äì1985), World Sports-Prototype Championship (1986‚Äì1990), World Sportscar Championship (1991‚Äì1992) and in the European Endurance Championship (1983 only). It was also used for other sports car racing series around the globe (All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, Supercup, Interserie). The final year for the class came in 1993. Broadly similar rules were used in the North American IMSA Grand Touring Prototype series (GTP). History The Porsche 956 was a dominant car in its many factory and customer built forms in the early 1980s. The roots of the Group C category lie in both FIA Group 6 and particularly in the GTP category introduced by the ACO at Le Mans in the mid-1970s. GTP was a class for roofed prototypes with certain dimensional restrictions, but instead of the more usual limits on engine capacity, it placed limits on fuel consumption. The FIA applied the same concept in its Group C rules. It limited cars to a minimum weight of 800 kg and a maximum fuel capacity of 100 litres. With competitors restricted to five refueling stops within a 1000 kilometer distance, the cars were effectively allowed 600 litres per 1000 kilometers. The FIA hoped this would prevent manufacturers from concentrating solely on engine development; in the late 1970s, a few manufacturers (especially Porsche and Lancia) had dominated sports car racing by simply increasing turbocharger boost pressure, especially in qualifying trim ‚Äî the 3.2 L Porsche 935 was capable of more than 800 hp. Engines had to be from a recognized manufacturer which had cars homologated in the FIA's Group A Touring Car or Group B GT Car categories. While the consumption requirement meant that cars needed to conserve fuel early in the race, manufacturer support for the new regulations grew steadily with each make adding to the diversity of the series. With the new rules, it was theoretically possible for large naturally aspirated engines to compete with small forced induction engines. In addition, all races were to be contested over at least 1000 km ‚Äî usually lasting more than six hours ‚Äî so it was possible to emphasize the \\"endurance\\" aspect of the competition as well. Ford (with the C100) and Porsche (with the 956) were the first constructors to join the series. The traditional turbocharged boxer engine in the 956 was already tested in the 1981 version of the Group 6 936. Eventually, several other makes joined the series, including Lancia, Jaguar, Mercedes, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda and Aston Martin. Many of these also took part in the IMSA championship, as its GTP class had similar regulations. With costs increasing, the FIA introduced a new Group C Junior class for 1983. This was intended for privateer teams and small manufacturers and it limited cars to a minimum weight of 700 kg and a maximum fuel capacity of 55 liters. With competitors limited to five refueling stops within a 1000 kilometer distance, the cars were effectively allowed 330 liters per 1000 kilometers. As in Group C, engines had to be from a recognized manufacturer which had cars homologated in Group A or Group B. Although it was originally expected that C Junior cars would use two-litre normally aspirated engines, in practice most cars used either the 3.5l BMW M1 engine or the new 3.3l Cosworth DFL, but, like in the main class, a variety of solutions was employed by each individual manufacturer. Alba with a small, lightweight turbo, Tiga, Spice and Ecurie Ecosse with Austin-Rover and later Cosworth-powered cars were among the most competitive in this class. The low cost of these cars even led to the notion of their use in national championships, such as the short-lived British BRDC C2 Championship. Group C Junior was formally renamed Group C2 for 1984. Rise and fall Jaguar XJR-8 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, 2008. By 1989, the Group C series popularity was nearly as great as Formula One. When C1 cars were found to be breaking over the 400 kilometres per hour mark at Le Mans' Mulsanne Straight ‚Äî the WM-Peugeot recorded the highest during qualifying for the 1988 event ‚Äî the FIA revolutionized the class by attempting to turn it into a formula series to replace the C2 category (after they proved to be unreliable at endurance races). The new formula restricted the performance of cars built to the original rules (such as the Porsche 962 used by many privateers) and benefited teams using F1-sourced 3.5 L engines ‚Äî these latter teams being effectively the large manufacturers alone, as the new formula cars were more expensive than the C1 cars. What followed was the quick downfall of Group C, as the new engines were unaffordable for privateer teams like Spice and ADA. A lack of entries meant the 1993 Championship was canceled before the start of the first race. However, the ACO still allowed the Group C cars to compete (albeit with restrictions) at 24 Hours of Le Mans. Nevertheless, the race still witnessed protests against the new state of affairs, as spectators placed cloth banners in fences expressing their feelings. The 1994 24 Hours of Le Mans was the last one in which Group C cars were permitted. A new category formed especially by race organizers also saw modified Group C cars without roofs. In fact, a former C1 car disguised as a road-legal GT car which was entered in the GT1 category, the Dauer 962 Le Mans, and won the race after transmission problems by a leading Toyota 94C-V. The 962 was subsequently banned; the Toyota was later given a special dispensation to race in the Suzuka 1000km, and a few C1 racers were allowed to compete in the newly formed Japanese GT Championship ‚Äî this would be its final year of competition. Many of the modified open top Group C cars continued to compete until they wrecked, broke, or retired out of competitiveness; notable among these was the Porsche WSC-95 which won the and Le Mans races, using the monocoque of the Jaguar XJR-14 and Porsche 962 mechanicals (engine, transmission, etc.). Group C series The FIA's Group C formula was designed primarily for the World Endurance Championship which included the 24 Hours of Le Mans. However, several smaller series also adapted the Group C regulations. The Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft allowed Group C cars to compete alongside various other types of cars from the 1982 season until 1985, when the series was reformed as the Supercup. Under the new Supercup series, only Group C cars would be allowed to compete. This series lasted until 1989. In Great Britain, the Thundersports championship combined a variety of cars with the C Junior (later C2) class of cars. This too was later replaced with a C2 only series known as the BRDC C2 Championship, and lasted until 1990. The European Interserie championship also allowed Group C cars to compete, although they did not use the same class structure. In Japan, the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship was created in 1983, while the Fuji Long Distance Series also began allowing Group C cars for the first time. It was not until 1989 however that the series concentrated solely on the Group C formula. Both championships lasted until 1992, when they were cancelled along with the World Sportscar Championship.

It was first released in Argentina on 26 October 1992 by Sony Music Argentina. Considered one of the most core examples of a shoegazing album (and Hispanic shoegaze's high point by critics and fans alike), this is a very modern album that might have been accepted in anglophone music, and was quite visionary for those years. The album also maintained the drastic change of musical style previously experienced in their 1990 album, Canci√≥n Animal. This album may also be considered one of the most mature and evolutionary deeds of the band. A highly experimental record, the album failed to reach its predecessor's popularity due to many factors, including lack of support from the band's label. It also alienated many fans, who had a hard time trying to cope with the unexpected shift in the band's musical style. Nonetheless, a few songs received a fair amount of radio airplay, including \\"Primavera 0\\" and \\"Luna Roja\\". The release of Dynamo prompted a nationwide tour, including a six night residency at Arena Obras Sanitarias, then known as the \\"Temple of Rock\\" by the local press. The band invited several up-and-coming bands from the alternative scene such as Babas√≥nicos, Juana La Loca and Martes Menta to fill the support slots at those concerts, thus giving exposure to a scene that would become influential (and in some cases commercially successful) over the years. In this respect it can be argued that in spite of an apparent commercial failure (it went Double Platinum within a few weeks), Soda Stereo were never as influential on the development of new bands as in the Dynamo era. It also established the band as a sort of forefathers of the 90s alternative scene in Argentina, even when their role was mostly as propagandists of sorts.http://www.allmusic.com/album/r176493 Dynamo - Soda Stereo  AllMusic Background and recording Following the release of Soda Stereo's critically acclaimed fifth studio album Canci√≥n animal in 1990, Soda was propelled to international recognition, particularly with their rock anthem \\"De m√∫sica ligera\\", which received vast airplay across Argentina. Shortly after the album's release, Soda embarked on an 81-show tour around Latin America and Spain, called Gira Animal. In 1991, lead singer, guitarist and frontman Gustavo Cerati began a musical partnership with Daniel Melero of Argentine band Los Encargados, a longtime friend of Cerati's, previous collaborator of Soda Stereo's and lover of electronic music. Cerati found the change in genre especially constructive for composing songs and began honing the art of sampling, buying an Akai MPC and composing sample-based songs with Melero in Estudios Supers√≥nico. This partnership would eventually culminate in the release of the Rex Mix EP (1991), as well as a Cerati-Melero collaboration, Colores santos, in 1992, both of which draw heavy sonic influence from electronic music, the Madchester scene in the United Kingdom, and neo- psychedelia. Guitarist and singer Gustavo Cerati (pictured) performing with Soda Stereo in Mexico City, 1993 Exasperated by their old material, Soda had already begun working on new music towards the tailend of the Gira animal tour, after a brief pause in touring. Cerati said, \\"We made the decision to distance ourselves a little, to do other things, to open our heads a little bit, to travel and to get together when it was right. That's how it was.\\" On top of Cerati's aforementioned influences coming into songwriting sessions, Soda also grew interested in alternative rock, impressed by the works of British shoegazing and dream pop bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Ultra Vivid Scene, Sonic Youth, Ride, Primal Scream, Spiritualized, and Lush. Immediately following the culmination of the tour in May of 1992 by way of six shows in Spain, Soda Stereo began work on a new album, tentatively titled Gol, but renamed Dynamo after Melero made a comment about old bicycles having dynamos. Two of the three songs composed exclusively by Cerati, \\"En remolinos\\" and \\"Primavera 0\\", had allegedly already been written by the time the group returned to Buenos Aires. According to Cerati, much of the album's material was composed in jams and rehearsals, with the audio recorded in stereo and saved onto DAT's. Other songs, such as \\"Texturas\\", were based on old songs from the band's beginnings. Eventually, Cerati states, \\"twenty-something\\" songs were written for the album. Many of the rejects for Dynamo ended up on other albums; the song \\"Rombos\\", from Cerati's solo album \\"Amor Amarillo\\" (1993), was first written by Cerati for Dynamo, and documentary footage by Boy Olmi taken from the recording sessions shows Cerati playing the song to Bosio on his MPC. Other songs, such as \\"Zona de promesas\\", \\"√Ångel el√©ctrico\\", and \\"Planeador\\", ended up on subsequent Soda projects. Recording began in August 1992 in Estudios Supers√≥nico in Buenos Aires, near Belgrano. Most of the lyrics were written in-studio, to the melodies. Meticulous about the album's sound, Cerati wished to \\"deform\\" the album sonically by constructing shoegaze- reminiscent walls of sound, while keeping the vocals in the foreground and executing powerful choruses characteristic of Soda's \\"heroic\\" trademark sound. In turn, he dominated the atmosphere of the studio vision-wise. In keeping with the album's electronic theme, songs such as \\"Camale√≥n\\", \\"Sweet sahumerio\\", \\"Ameba\\", \\"Nuestra fe\\", and \\"Claroscuro\\" were built around loops, synthesisers, and samplers such as Cerati's MPC60. Cerati, Bosio, and Melero contributed extensively to the album's artistic production. The recording sessions for the album took a notably experimental direction compared to past albums; for inspiration, the crew recorded raga rock track \\"Sweet sahumerio\\" by holding an impromptu yoga class in the studio with Cerati's personal yoga trainer, and for the first time, enlisted the help of a local Hindu music band for instrumentation, including tabla, tambura, and sitar. Track 5, \\"Camale√≥n\\", was recorded in an unusual setup, with Cerati on bass guitar and Bosio on electric guitar (minus the solo at the end). Recording for the album culminated the following month with the recording of fifth single \\"Claroscuro\\". Composition =Music= Dynamo showed a complete turnaround in the band's sound, headed towards a more alternative style. It is primarily a shoegaze album, while at the same time founded on neo-psychedelia, dream pop, noise rock, alternative dance and electronic music. It is often compared to My Bloody Valentine's seminal album Loveless. Some critics refer to Dynamo as a kind of \\"hispanic Loveless\\". While both share multiple musical traits, Loveless was conceived in a culture that was experiencing a rise of alternative genres; Dynamo in turn, was released in the highly conservative Latin American music scene. Along Souvlaki by Slowdive and Nowhere by Ride, Dynamo is considered an essential part of the shoegaze movement. Release Dynamo was released in October 1992 in Latin America on cassette, compact disc, and vinyl. The Gira Dynamo began on 27 November 1992 with a presentation on the Argentine talk show Fax, and venue shows began in December 1992 in Buenos Aires. Legacy While Dynamo was not particularly favored commercially upon its release, it is today considered a cult classic and was one of the first shoegazing albums by any Latin American artist. is considered the Hispanic shoegaze's maximum referent. Soda Stereo was a pioneer band in the wave of experimental alternative music within Latin America, in which Dynamo turned to be considered a benchmark and influential album for many musicians and bands in Latin rock, not just for the experimentation and influences that permeated throughout the record, but also because of the virtuosity, musical complexity and growth achieved by the band during the realization of this album.

The train consisted of an ex-LMS Stanier Class 8F 2-8-0 No. 48188 hauling 33 wagons and a brake van. Accident On the outward trip from Stockport to Buxton that day, Driver Axon had noticed a leak from the supply to the locomotive steam brake and had requested and received fitter's attention at the Buxton depot. On the return trip from Buxton to Stockport, the repair did not hold and the supply pipe broke away from the steam brake disabling the locomotive steam brake and whistle. This filled the locomotive cab with scalding steam and prevented Driver John Axon and Fireman Ron Scanlon from reaching the controls. Before radios, engines used whistles to communicate with each other which was obviously not possible if the cab was filled with scalding steam and, even more to the point, if the steam whistle is not functional. Thus the crew of the banking engine at the rear of Driver Axon's train remained unaware of the problems at the front and unfortunately kept pushing Driver Axon's train towards Dove Holes summit. Driver Axon told his Fireman Scanlon to jump off and attempt to apply wagon brakes but, due to the speed the train was travelling, he only managed to apply a few before the train reached the summit and began accelerating down the 1 in 58 gradient towards Chapel-en-le-Frith. As the crew of the banking engine reached the summit to let the train continue under its own power, they were alarmed to see Axon's train accelerating away from them, and the guard frantically applying the brakes to his van. George Cross and its ribbon bar At the time of the locomotive failure, Driver Axon could have jumped clear of the then slow-moving train. However, aware of the danger that his train posed to life further down the line, he stayed with his accelerating train despite the scalding steam on the footplate, trying to close the regulator in the hope that this would mitigate the effects of a collision. In the end, he only managed to partly close it, and screw down the engine's tender brakes, but sadly this had negligible effect. Warned by the Dove Holes signalman, the staff at Chapel-en-le-Frith were able to evacuate a two-car DMU, but had no time to warn the crew of a Rowsley-to-Stockport freight. The runaway smashed into the rear of it killing both the train's guard and Axon. Recognition Axon was posthumously awarded the George Cross on 7 May 1957. His George Cross was donated to the National Railway Museum in 1978. He was also awarded the Order of Industrial Heroism.Bob Burrows, \\"The Ultimate Sacrifice: 11 February 1957\\", Infamous Cheshire (2006), p. 51-52. He was the subject of a famous 1957 radio ballad (The Ballad of John Axon), the first of the series, written by Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger and produced by Charles Parker. A CD released in June 2008, 'Primary Transmission' by the artist Broadcaster on Red Grape Records, included the song 'Johnny' which is based on samples from the Ballad of John Axon and set to new music. On 19 February 1981, a British Rail Class 86 electric locomotive number 86261 was named Driver John Axon, GC at a ceremony at Euston Station, London. In February 2007, a DMU Class 150 train (150273) was named 'Driver John Axon, GC' at Buxton. This name has now passed onto a Class 156 DMU, 156460. A plaque commemorating the events was unveiled, to be mounted at Chapel-en-le Frith station. The plaque is now mounted on the station buildings at Chapel-en-le- Frith facing onto the southbound platform.

It is the center of Shchuchyn District. The population is nearly 15,000 (2010). History ≈†ƒçuƒçyn Coat of Arms The first known official written mention of Shchuchyn is recorded in 1436, but its foundation as a settlement dates back to 1537, when 'Shchuchyn was mentioned in the Book of Acts of the Lithuanian Metrica (the Book of Lithuanian vital records), kept in the Governmental archive in Lithuania. Ownership of Shchuchyn passed from one noble family to another: The Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family, then the Drutskiya-Liubetskis, the Scipions, and others ruled Shchuchyn in turn. In the 15th‚Äì18th centuries, Shchuchyn became a member of the Lida council of the Vilnius office of voivode. In the first half of the 17th century, Shchuchyn was governed by the outsider marshal of the Lithuanian principality, Scipio de Campo. Shchuchyn was an average-sized privately owned village in terms of population. A Catholic Monasterial Order was established 1726 in Shchuchyn by the resolution of the Sejm. The Board of Shchuchyn was considered to be one of the biggest in Belarus. Shchuchyn was subject to ruin and ravage more than once in its history. The biggest was in the time of the North War, after the town was seized by the Swedish king Karl XII. After the third partition of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Shchuchyn became a part of the Russian Empire. In June 1812 Shchuchyn was occupied by French troops. And again in 1915, by the German Kaiser. In 1919 the Red Army attempted to seize Belarusian land by taking and fortifying the Martinkantsy - Shchuchyn - Shchara - lake Vygonovskoe line. However, the superior defence forces of the \\"Land of Grodnenskaya\\", together with Poland, forced the Red Army back. In 1939, Western Belarus, together with Shchuchyn, went under the control of the Soviet authorities. In World War II, Shchuchyn was occupied by German troops. During the Nazi occupation from 25 June 1941 until 13 July 1944 the Nazi forces killed about 2180 Jews from the Shchuchyn ghetto with the majority of them killed on 10(9) May 1942.http://www.yahadmap.org/#village/shchuchin-scucyn-szczuczyn-grodno- belarus.454–ê–¥–∞–º—É—à–∫–æ –í. –ò., –ë–∏—Ä—é–∫–æ–≤–∞ –û. –í., –ö—Ä—é–∫ –í. –ü., –ö—É–¥—Ä—è–∫–æ–≤–∞ –ì. –ê. ¬´–°–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫ –æ –º–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ö –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—É–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏—è –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ –æ–∫–∫—É–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–π —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∏ 1941-1944¬ª. ‚Äî –ú–Ω.: –ù–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤ –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—å, –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –ø–æ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–∞–º –∏ –¥–µ–ª–æ–ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤—É –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—å, 2001. ‚Äî 158 —Å. ‚Äî 2000 —ç–∫–∑. ‚Äî In 1962, Shchuchyn was granted town status.  Air base  Until the collapse of the Soviet Union Shchuchyn was a home of one of the biggest Soviet air bases with over 5,000 personnel assigned to it in the 1990s. The history of the Soviet air force presence in the city goes back into 1941 with a wing of Polikarpov I-16. The air base hosted different types of the Soviet planes throughout the years, such as IL-28, MiG-15, MiG-19, An-14, MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-25, and others. Most famously in the early 1990s it was a home of about 40 MiG-25BM defense- suppression aircraft, which represents the vast majority of this modification of MiG-25 ever produced. The base was controlled by the 95th air wing. The base's runway is 2,500 meters long.  Industry  Important industry: JSC ‚ÄúShchuchyn plant ‚ÄúAvtoprovod‚Äù (found in 1958), JSC \\"Shchuchyn butter-cheese factory\\" and a bread factory.  Education  Primary and secondary education: three primary schools (each school combines grades one through twelve), a vocational technical school (VTS), a gymnasium. Also there are six government run daycare centres.

Cars  =Fisker Tramonto= Tramonto at the alt= The Fisker Tramonto is a hand-built sports car, launched in 2005. Original production was scheduled to be limited to 150 pieces worldwide, but only 15 were ever built. It used the base architecture of the Mercedes-Benz SL, retaining the engineering and safety features of the original car. However, unlike the original, the Tramonto had a slimmer back end, a longer hood line and no visual bumpers. This look was created using a variety of different materials. The interior of the Tramonto was hand trimmed and hand stitched using Italian leather. Each car was built in California and was individually numbered. The Tramonto used the hand-built AMG power plant and customers had the choice of 8-cylinder or 12-cylinder engines. The Tramonto has a 0-62 mph (100 km/h) time of 3.6 seconds for the V-8 and 3.2 for the V-12. The top speed is for the V8 and over 205 mph for the V-12. The only Tramonto V-12 built (car 15 of 15) had an output of and of torque. =Fisker Latigo CS = Fisker Latigo CS at the 2005 Frankfurt International Auto Show. The Fisker Latigo CS, the second design from Fisker Coachbuild, was initially shown at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show, and was subsequently launched in 2007 with production limited to 150 worldwide. It uses the base architecture of the BMW 6 Series and M6. As in the Tramonto, all electronic and safety systems remain untouched. The car is built in California using the most advanced materials in carbon fiber, aluminum, stainless steel and magnesium alloy. The Latigo CS interior is hand trimmed and hand stitched using Italian furniture leather and each car is individually numbered. Fisker uses the V-10 BMW power plant to power the Latigo CS.

He was known for his cartoons in the British press, and for his lifelong work to inform the general public about good buildings and architectural heritage. The only child of a prosperous family, Lancaster was educated at Charterhouse School and Lincoln College, Oxford; at both he was an undistinguished scholar. From an early age he was determined to be a professional artist and designer, and studied at leading art colleges in Oxford and London. While working as a contributor to The Architectural Review in the mid-1930s, Lancaster published the first of a series of books on architecture, aiming to simultaneously amuse the general reader and demystify the subject. Several of the terms he coined as labels for architectural styles have gained common usage, including \\"Pont Street Dutch\\" and \\"Stockbrokers' Tudor\\", and his books have continued to be regarded as important works of reference on the subject. In 1938 Lancaster was invited to contribute topical cartoons to The Daily Express. He introduced the single column-width cartoon popular in the French press but not until then seen in British papers. Between 1939 and his retirement in 1981 he drew about 10,000 of these \\"pocket cartoons\\", which made him a nationally known figure. He developed a cast of regular characters, led by his best-known creation, Maudie Littlehampton, through whom he expressed his views on the fashions, fads and political events of the day. From his youth, Lancaster wanted to design for the theatre, and in 1951 he was commissioned to create costumes and scenery for a new ballet, Pineapple Poll. Between then and the early 1970s he designed new productions for the Royal Ballet, Glyndebourne, D'Oyly Carte, the Old Vic and the West End. His productivity declined in his later years, when his health began to fail. He died at his London home in Chelsea, aged 77. His diverse career, honoured by a knighthood in 1975, was celebrated by an exhibition at the Wallace Collection marking the centenary of his birth and titled Cartoons and Coronets: The Genius of Osbert Lancaster. Life and career =Early years= Lancaster was born in London in 1908, the only child of Robert Lancaster (1880‚Äì1917) and his wife, Clare Bracebridge, n√©e Manger.Lucie-Smith, p. 184 His paternal grandfather, Sir William Lancaster, rose from modest beginnings to become the chief executive of the Prudential Assurance Company, Lord of the manor of East Winch, Norfolk, and a philanthropist in the field of education.\\"Sir W.

The family maintained a staff of servants, including a cook and a nurse.Lancaster (1963), p. 13 Such was the mixed nature of London in the early years of the 20th century that a short distance away were the deprived and dangerous Notting Dale and the Portobello Road, where, as Lancaster recalled in his 1953 memoirs, it was said to be impossible for a well-dressed man to walk and emerge intact.Lancaster (1963), p. 2 From an early age Lancaster was aware of the variety of classes, nationalities, and social attitudes around him.Lancaster (1963), pp. 12‚Äì15 In 1918 Lancaster was sent to St Ronan's preparatory school, Worthing. The r√©gime at the school leaned heavily towards sport, in which he was neither interested nor proficient. The headmaster, Stanley Harris, was a celebrated amateur footballer and occasional first class cricketer, but he was reasonably tolerant of Lancaster's disdain for games, and on the whole Lancaster enjoyed his time at the school. His education there was, he later commented, of more importance to him than anything he learned later in his school and university career.Knox, p. 16 He left St Ronan's in 1921, aged thirteen, and went to Charterhouse, where his father and uncles had all been sent.Knox, p. 18 There he was shocked by the bullying and bad language,Boston, pp. 44‚Äì45 but in addition to its sporty, philistine \\"bloods\\",Boston, pp. 44 and 47 the school had an intellectual and aesthetic tradition. Lancaster's biographer Richard Boston writes, \\"The hearty Baden- Powell, for example, was offset by Ralph Vaughan Williams and Robert Graves, while talented Carthusian artists had included Thackeray, Leech, Lovat Fraser and Max Beerbohm\\".Boston, p. 47 The art master, P.J.(\\"Purple\\")Johnson, encouraged Lancaster, insisting that a sound technique was a prerequisite for effective self-expression in drawing or painting; in that respect the boy's time at the school was valuable, though otherwise the headmaster found him \\"irretrievably gauche... a sad disappointment\\".Boston, p. 46 Lancaster shared Beerbohm's view that being an old boy of the school was more pleasurable than being a pupil there. Lincoln College, Oxford At the age of seventeen Lancaster passed his final school examinations and gained entrance to Lincoln College, Oxford, to study history. He persuaded his mother to allow him to leave Charterhouse at once, giving him several months between school and university, during which he enrolled on a course of life classes at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London.Knox, p. 22 In October 1926 he started at Oxford. There, as at Charterhouse, he found two camps in which some students chose to group themselves: the \\"hearties\\" presented themselves as aggressively heterosexual and anti-intellectual; the \\"aesthetes\\" had a largely homosexual membership.Catto, Evans and McConica, pp. 98‚Äì99 Lancaster followed his elder contemporary Kenneth Clark in being contentedly heterosexual but nonetheless one of the aesthetes, and he was accepted as a leading member of their set.Clark, pp. 73‚Äì74; and Boston, p. 54 He cultivated the image of an Edwardian dandy, with large moustache, a monocle and check suits, modelling his persona to a considerable degree on Beerbohm, whom he admired greatly.Boston, pp. 53‚Äì54 He also absorbed some characteristics of the Oxford don Maurice Bowra; Lancaster's friend James Lees-Milne commented, \\"Bowra's influence over Osbert was marked, to the extent that he adopted the guru's booming voice, explosive emphasis of certain words and phrases, and habit in conversation of regaling his audiences with rehearsed witticisms and gossip.\\" Lancaster's undergraduate set included Stephen Spender, Randolph Churchill, and most importantly John Betjeman, who became a close friend and lifelong influence.Boston, p. 59 Lancaster tried rowing with the Oxford University Boat Club, but quickly discovered he was no more suited to that than he had been to field games at school.Knox, p. 25 He joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), acted in supporting roles, designed programme covers, wrote, and choreographed.Knox, p. 27 He contributed prose and drawings to Isis and Cherwell magazines, engaged in student pranks, staged an exhibition of his pictures, attended life classes, and became established as a major figure in the Oxonian social scene.Knox, pp. 27‚Äì28 and 33‚Äì34 All these diversions led him to neglect his academic work. He had made things more difficult for himself by switching from the history course to English after his first year, a decision he regretted once confronted with the rigours of compulsory Anglo- Saxon, which he found incomprehensible.Knox, p. 33 Making a belated effort, he extended his studies from the usual three years to four, and graduated with a fourth-class degree in 1930.Knox, pp. 33‚Äì34 =1930s= Slade School of Fine Art, London, where Lancaster studied from 1931 to 1933 Lancaster's family believed that art was a suitable hobby but an unacceptable profession; they agreed that the best career for him would be the law. He dutifully attended a crammer and joined the Middle Temple, but repeatedly failed his law examinations. His studies were abruptly bought to an end by his health. A chest ailment was diagnosed as possibly tubercular, and he was sent to a sanatorium in Switzerland. After three months he was declared fit, and following a holiday in Venice ‚Äì a lifelong love and aesthetic influence ‚Äì he returned to England in 1931. He abandoned all thoughts of becoming a lawyer and enrolled full-time at the Slade School of Art in London.Knox, p. 35 At the Slade, Lancaster enjoyed most of his classes, but particularly those in stage design run by Vladimir Polunin, who had been Diaghilev's chief scene-painter and had worked with Picasso.Haskell and Clarke, p. 149; and Boston, p. 73 Among Polunin's students was Karen Harris, daughter of the banker Sir Austin Harris. Lancaster fell in love with her;Boston, p. 73 his feelings were reciprocated, but she was only seventeen and her parents thought her too young to marry. At first they were cautious about Lancaster's suitability as a husband and provider, but they came to approve of him. He and Karen were married in June 1933.Boston, p. 78 They had two children: Cara (born 1934) and William (born 1938); the former became a stage manager, the latter, an anthropologist.Smith, David. \\"Timeless appeal of the classic joke\\" , The Observer, 23 November 2008; Boston, p. 41; and Knox, p. 47 John Betjeman, Lancaster's lifelong friend and fellow campaigner Lancaster earned a living as a freelance artist, producing advertising posters, Christmas cards, book illustrations and a series of murals for a hotel. In 1934 he secured a regular post with The Architectural Review, which was owned by a family friend and of which Betjeman was assistant editor.Knox, p. 38 The magazine had a reputation as \\"the mouthpiece of the modernist movement\\", employing leading proponents such as Ern≈ë Goldfinger and Nikolaus Pevsner.Boston, Richard. \\"A few home truths for Dr Pevsner\\", The Guardian, 18 November 1991, p. 36 Despite describing the Bauhaus style as \\"balls\\", Lancaster was not anti-modernist, but he joined Betjeman and Robert Byron in advancing the countervailing value of more traditional architecture.Knox, p. 39 Chief among his many activities for The Architectural Review was reviewing books, particularly those on art. His biographer James Knox comments that Lancaster's taste was already assured, appreciating the diverse gifts of contemporary artists including Edward Burra, Giorgio de Chirico, Edward Wadsworth and Paul Nash.Knox, p. 40 Knox singles out as Lancaster's most lasting contribution to the magazine a series of illustrated satires on planning and architecture, under the title Progress at Pelvis Bay. The collected articles were turned into a book, under the same title, published in 1936. It lampooned greedy and philistine property development in a typical seaside resort. Reviewing the book in The Observer, Simon Harcourt-Smith wrote, \\"Mr Lancaster spares us no horrifying detail of the borough's development... [his] admirable drawings complete the picture of progress and desolation. I hope that every local authority and real-estate developer will be compelled to read this ghoulish little book.\\"Harcourt-Smith, Simon. \\"Improving England: Progress or Destruction?\\", The Observer, 15 November 1936, p. 9 Lancaster followed this with Pillar to Post (1938), a lighthearted book with roughly equal amounts of text and drawings, aiming to demystify architecture for the intelligent lay person.Knox, p. 41 The architectural scholar Christopher Hussey remarked on the author's inventive coinage of terms for period styles such as \\"Banker's Georgian\\", \\"Stockbrokers' Tudor\\" and \\"By-pass Variegated\\", and described the book as both perceptive and shrewd.Hussey, Christopher. \\"What is Architecture?: Man and his Buildings\\", The Observer, 30 October 1938, p. 9 In 1938 Lancaster agreed to help Betjeman write a series of articles for The Daily Express. He became friendly with the paper's features editor, John Rayner, who responded positively to Lancaster's praise of \\"the little column-width cartoons\\" popular in the French press but not, so far, seen in British papers.Boston, p. 107 Rayner dubbed them \\"pocket cartoons\\" after the pocket battleships then much in the news, and invited Lancaster to contribute some. The first appeared on 3January 1939. The early cartoons accompanied the \\"William Hickey\\" gossip column; later they were promoted to a front-page slot, where they remained a regular feature, with only brief interruptions, for more than forty years, totalling about 10,000.Knox, p. 47; and Boston, p. 107 The popularity of Lancaster's cartoons led to attempts by other papers, including The Times, to lure him away from the Express, but he resisted them.Boxer, Mark. \\"Pocket-size Belgravia\\", The Observer, 3 August 1986, p. 21 Although he thought the Express's proprietor, Lord Beaverbook, \\"an old brute\\" and \\"a bastard\\", he found him \\"an ideal employer as far as I was concerned: he left one's work absolutely alone\\".Fallowell, Duncan. \\"The Times Profile: Sir Osbert Lancaster\\", The Times, 11 October 1982, p. 8Boston, p. 116 =Second World War= Shortly after the outbreak of war, Lancaster joined the Ministry of Information.Boston, p. 119 He spoke good French and German, and because of that and his journalistic experience, he was recruited by the section handling British propaganda overseas.Knox, p. 48 Several other prominent figures were members of the section and there were many clashes of egos and few tangible achievements.Donnelly, p. 70... quite a considerable band of stalwarts pledged to maintain the highest traditions of undergraduate life of the roaring Twenties\\".Quoted in Fallowell, Duncan. \\"The dandy cartoonist who spoke for Britain\\", The Daily Express, 20 September 2008, p. 2group= n}} In July 1941, Lancaster was transferred to the Foreign Office's news department. His duties included giving daily news briefings to other public servants and the British press, monitoring German propaganda broadcasts, and drawing caricatures for leaflets in German, Dutch and French for aerial drops in enemy-held territory.Knox, pp. 49‚Äì50 In addition to his official duties Lancaster was art critic for The Observer between 1942 and 1944, and continued to contribute the pocket cartoons to the Express; from 1943 he also drew a large weekly cartoon for its sister newspaper, The Sunday Express, under the pen-name \\"Bunbury\\". Despite the wartime shortage of paper, the publisher John Murray produced a collection of the pocket cartoons every year from 1940 to 1944.Lucie-Smith, p. 184 In December 1944, the war approaching its end, Lancaster was posted to Greece as press attach√© to the British embassy in Athens. After the occupying Germans had withdrawn, opposing factions brought the country to the brink of civil war. Fearing a communist takeover, the British government supported Georgios Papandreou, prime minister of the former government-in-exile, now precariously in power in Athens, backed by British troops.Horne, p. 240 When Papandreou's police fired on a civilian demonstration in full view of the world's press, British support for him came under international pressure.Horne, p. 242; and Boston, p. 133 The British embassy, at which Lancaster arrived on 12 December, was the target for gunfire from various anti-government groups, and he joined the ambassador (Reginald Leeper), the British Minister Resident in the Mediterranean (Harold Macmillan) and a staff virtually under siege.Horne, pp. 247‚Äì248 Pantanassa Monastery, Mystras about which Lancaster wrote in Sailing to Byzantium (1969) Following an initiative by Macmillan and the personal intervention of Winston Churchill, a new government took office in Athens acceptable to all sides, and peace was briefly restored, in January 1945.Kuniholm, pp. 223‚Äì225; and Horne, pp. 239‚Äì240 Lancaster's task was then to restore trust and good relations between Britain ‚Äì its government, embassy and military ‚Äì and the international press corps. In this he was generally thought to have succeeded.Boston, p. 151 After that, he took the opportunity of travelling in the country beyond Athens during the months before civil strife returned in 1946. He explored Attica, Boeotia and Arcadia, and also visited Thessaly, Epirus and some of the islands.Knox, p. 57 He fell in love with Greece,Hillier, Bevis. \\"Lancaster, Sir Osbert (1908‚Äì1986)\\" , Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, retrieved 3 February 2018 which he revisited repeatedly throughout the rest of his life.Knox, p. 85 During his excursions in 1945 and 1946 he sketched continually, and the results were published with his accompanying text as Classical Landscape with Figures in 1947. Boston describes it as \\"an unflinching but lyrical account of the conditions of post- war Greece\\"; The Times called it \\"a fine work of scholarship\\" as well as \\"an outstanding picture book\\". =Postwar= During the three years between his return from Greece and the end of the decade, Lancaster published two more books, one a comic story originally written for his children, The Saracen's Head, and the other a further satirical book about architecture and planning, Drayneflete Revealed.Lucie-Smith, pp. 126‚Äì128 In 1947‚Äì48 he was the Sydney Jones Lecturer in Art at Liverpool University, following earlier appointees including Sir Herbert Read, W. G. Constable, Frank Lambert and H. S. Goodhart- Rendel.\\"Sydney Jones Lecturer\\", Liverpool Daily Post, 23 November 1945, p. 2 The 1951 Festival of Britain gave Lancaster new opportunities to expand his artistic scope. Despite the hostility to the festival shown by his main employer, Beaverbrook, Lancaster was a major contributor.Turner, pp. 99 and 107‚Äì108 He and his friend John Piper were commissioned to design the centrepiece of the Festival Gardens on the south bank of the Thames. Boston describes it as \\"a 250-yard succession of pavilions, arcades, towers, pagodas, terraces, gardens, lakes and fountains, in styles that included Brighton Regency, Gothic and Chinese\\".Boston, p. 219 The main site of the festival, around the new Royal Festival Hall, was intended to convey the spirit of modernist architecture; the gardens were designed to evoke the atmosphere of Georgian pleasure gardens, such as Vauxhall and Ranelagh.Knox, p. 60 The gardens attracted about eight million visitors during the 1951 festival.Boston, p. 220 The Manchester Guardian called them \\"a masterpiece... fantasy on fantasy, red and gold and blue and green, a labyrinth of light- hearted absurdity\\".\\"The Lighter Side of London's Festival\\", The Manchester Guardian, 29 May 1951, p. 5 Lancaster's association with Piper led to a second departure in his professional career: stage design. In connexion with the Festival of Britain, Sadler's Wells Ballet mounted a new work, Pineapple Poll by John Cranko, and approached Piper to design it. He could not take the commission and recommended his colleague. This was an opportunity Lancaster had keenly awaited since he was eleven, when his mother took him to see Diaghilev's production of The Sleeping Beauty. He recalled \\"the dazzling beauty of the Bakst sets and the intensity of my own response... There and then I formed an ambition that was not destined to be fulfilled for more than thirty years\\".Lancaster (1967), p. 17 Cranko's exuberant ballet was an immediate success ‚Äì \\"the hit of the season\\", in Knox's phrase ‚Äì and turned Lancaster into one of the country's most sought-after theatre designers.Knox, p. 133 During the rest of the 1950s and the 1960s his costumes and scenery were seen in new productions at Covent Garden, Glyndebourne, the Old Vic, Aldeburgh and in the West End. Although he had provided drawings for a few books by other authors in the 1930s it was not until after the war that Lancaster was continually in demand as an illustrator.Knox, p. 175 He illustrated or designed covers for a wide range of books, both fiction and non-fiction. His commissions included drawings for works by friends such as Nancy Mitford, Alan Moorehead and Anthony Powell; for best-sellers including C.Northcote Parkinson and P.G.Wodehouse; and for other modern authors including Ruth McKenney, Violet Powell, Simon Raven and Virginia Graham. He also illustrated new editions of classic works by authors from Shakespeare to Beerbohm and Saki.Knox, pp. 175‚Äì185 =Later years: 1960‚Äì1986= Daily Express building in Fleet Street In Osbert: A Portrait of Osbert Lancaster, Boston comments that after the dramatic events in Athens his subject's later life was uneventful and industrious with \\"a somewhat dismaying dearth of rows, intrigues, scandals or scrapes to report.\\"Boston, p. 164 The Lancasters had a Georgian house in Henley-on-Thames, and a flat in Chelsea, where they lived from Mondays to Fridays.Boston, p. 173 He worked at home in the mornings, on illustrations, stage designs, book reviews and any other commissions, before joining his wife for a midday dry martini and finally dressing and going to one of his clubs for lunch. After that he would walk to the Express building in Fleet Street at about four in the afternoon. There he would gossip with his colleagues before sitting at his desk smoking furiously, producing the next day's pocket cartoon. By about half-past six he would have presented the cartoon to the editor and be ready for a drink at El Vino's across the road, and then the evening's social events.Boston, pp. 175‚Äì179 Karen Lancaster died in 1964. They were markedly different in character, she quiet and home-loving, he extrovert and gregarious, but they were devoted to each other, and her death left him devastated.Boston, p. 77 Three years later he married the journalist Anne Scott-James; they had known each other for many years, although at first she did not much like him, finding him \\"stagey\\" and \\"supercilious\\". By the 1960s they had become good friends, and after Karen died the widowed Lancaster and the divorced Scott-James spent increasing amounts of time together. Their wedding was at the Chelsea Register Office on 2January 1967.\\"Osbert Lancaster\\", The Daily Telegraph, 3 January 1967, p. 13 After their marriage they kept his Chelsea flat, and lived at weekends in her house in the Berkshire village of Aldworth, the house in Henley having been sold.Boston, pp. 229‚Äì230 Tate Gallery portico, saved from demolition after campaigning by Lancaster and others Though generally a commentator rather than a campaigner, Lancaster made an exception for the protection of Britain's architectural heritage, where he became a leader of public opinion.Knox, pp. 68‚Äì69 The historian Jerry White has written that the demolition of the Euston Arch in London in 1962 alerted the general public that \\"without vigilance and sturdy resistance, London was in danger of losing its landmarks one by one, in the interests of either profit or a misconceived public weal\\".White, p. 68 Lancaster had been pressing this point since before the war. In 1967 he was appointed to the Greater London Council's Historic Buildings advisory committee, joining Betjeman, Pevsner and Sir John Summerson.\\"The Times Diary\\", The Times, 28 June 1967, p. 10 They played a major role in defeating the Labour government's plans to demolish the front of the Tate Gallery. In 1973, with Betjeman and others of like mind Lancaster campaigned against the Conservative government's imposition of entry charges to hitherto free galleries and museums; the charges caused admissions to drop drastically, and were soon abolished.Campbell, p. 391 In June 1975 Lancaster was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours.\\"Birthday Honours\\", The Times, 14 June 1975, p. 4 He and his wife collaborated on The Pleasure Garden (1977), a history of the British garden. Although great gardens such as Stowe were given full coverage, her text and his drawings did not neglect more modest efforts: \\"The suburban garden is the most important garden of the 20th century and there is no excuse other than ignorance for using the word 'suburban' in a derogatory sense\\".Scott-James and Lancaster, p. 112 The following year Lancaster was made a Royal Designer for Industry (RDI) by the Royal Society of Arts, a distinction in which his predecessors had included the artist and architect Hugh Casson; the typographer Eric Gill; Charles Holden, London Transport's architect; Barnes Wallis, the wartime engineer; and a modernist architect with whom Lancaster had vigorously crossed swords, Sir Basil Spence. There would not be another theatre designer RDI until Stefanos Lazaridis in 2003.\\"Past Royal Designers\\" , Royal Society of Arts, retrieved 13 February 2018 In 1978 Lancaster suffered the first of a series of strokes, and his health began a slow decline. He designed no more for the theatre, drew his last pocket cartoon for the Express in May 1981,Pocket Cartoon, The Daily Express, 8 May 1981, p. 2 and published his last collection, The Life and Times of Maudie Littlehampton the following year. Lancaster died at his Chelsea flat on 27 July 1986, aged 77. He was buried with previous generations of his family in the churchyard at West Winch.Knox, p. 73 A memorial service was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden in October 1986.\\"Memorial services: Sir Osbert Lancaster\\", The Times, 3 October 1986, p. 18 Works =Architectural history and comment= Lancaster's illustration of \\"Baroque\\", with curled columns and fanciful statuary In 2008 the architectural historian Gavin Stamp described Lancaster's Pillar to Post (1938) ‚Äì later revised and combined with the sequel Homes Sweet Homes (1939) ‚Äì as \\"one of the most influential books on architecture ever published ‚Äì and certainly the funniest\\".Stamp, p. 44 Lancaster felt that architects and architectural writers had created a mystique that left the lay person confused, and in the two books he set out to demystify the subject, with, he said, \\"a small mass of information leavened by a large dose of personal prejudice.\\"Lucie-Smith, p. 146 From an early age Lancaster had been fascinated by architecture. He recalled his first trip to Venice and the \\"staggering\\" view of San Giorgio Maggiore from the Piazzetta, and as a young man he went on what he described as \\"church crawls\\" with Betjeman.Knox, p. 105 His concern for architectural heritage led him to write and draw what Knox describes as \\"a series of architectural polemics in the guise of disarming 'picture books'\\". Harold Nicolson said of Lancaster's work in this sphere, \\"Under that silken, sardonic smile there lies the zeal of an ardent reformer... a most witty and entertaining book. But it is more than that. It is a lucid summary of a most important subject\\".Nicolson, Harold. \\"The worst fifty years in English architecture\\", The Daily Telegraph, 28 October 1938, p. 8 Four of Lancaster's books are in this category: Progress at Pelvis Bay lampoons insensitive planners and avaricious developers; Pillar to Post illustrates and analyses the exteriors of buildings from ancient times to the present; Homes Sweet Homes does the same for the interiors. Drayneflete Revealed is in the same vein as Progress at Pelvis Bay. In all these Lancaster employs something of the technique he prescribed for stage design: presenting a slightly heightened version of reality. The twisted columns in the \\"Baroque\\" section are not drawn directly from actual baroque buildings, but are the artist's distillation of the many examples he has seen and sketched. By such means, he set out to make the general public aware of good buildings, and \\"the present lamentable state of English architecture\\". Lancaster's sketches and paintings in and around Greece are rarely satirical; they are a record of his love for, and careful scrutiny of the country. When his contempt for tyranny prevented him from visiting Greece while it was under military rule he went instead to Egypt, Sudan, Lebanon and Syria, always with a large sketchbook, in which he wrote and drew. From these sketches he produced Classical Landscape with Figures (1947), Sailing to Byzantium: An Architectural Companion (1969) and, in a different vein, Scene Changes (1978), in which he ventured into writing poetry to accompany his drawings.Lucie-Smith, p. 56; and Knox, pp. 86‚Äì99 Dilys Powell, a well-known Hellenophile, wrote that Lancaster was \\"one of the few who could make a joke about the Greeks without giving offence; he was devoted to Greece; he was born to celebrate her\\". =Cartoons= The regular cast of the pocket cartoons, led by Maudie Littlehampton, in round glasses; Mrs Rajagojollibarmi talking to Willy Littlehampton, top right; Great-Aunt Edna in front of them; the Canon on the back row, glowering; Father O'Bubblegum at the drinks table, where Maudie's bibulous Uncle Eustace (rose in buttonhole, nose in glass) has preceded him. Although the Beaverbrook papers were editorially right-wing, Lancaster was never pressured into following a party line. His inclination was to satirise the government of the day, regardless of party, and he felt that his overtly partisan colleagues such as David Low and Vicky were constrained by their political allegiances.Boston, p. 112 He wrote, \\"It is not the cartoonist's business to wave flags and cheer as the procession passes; his allotted role is that of the little boy who points out that the Emperor is stark naked\\".Quoted in Knox, p. 203 In the late 1940s Lancaster developed a repertory company of characters in whose mouths he put his social and political jokes. The star character was Maudie, Countess of Littlehampton, who managed to be shrewd and flighty simultaneously. She began as what her creator called \\"a slightly dotty class symbol\\", but developed into \\"a voice of straightforward comment which might be my own\\".Knox, p. 203 Maudie's political views were eclectic: \\"on some matters she is far to the right of Mr Enoch Powell, and on others well to the left of Mr Michael Foot\\".Lancaster (1984), p. 246 Her comments on the fads and peculiarities of the day caught the public imagination; the art historian Bevis Hillier calls her \\"an iconic figure to rank with Low's Colonel Blimp and Giles's Grandma\\".Hillier, Bevis. \\"A Laughing Cavalier\\", The Spectator, 4 October 2008, p. 33 Various candidates have been proposed as the model for Maudie, but Lancaster maintained that she was not based on any one real person.Knox, p. 67 Other regular characters included Maudie's dim but occasionally perceptive husband Willy; two formidable dowagers: the Littlehamptons' Great-Aunt Edna, and Mrs Frogmarch, a middle-class Tory activist; Canon Fontwater, a personification of the Church Militant; Mrs Rajagojollibarmi, an Asian politician; and Father O'Bubblegum, Fontwater's Roman Catholic opposite number; they are seen in the illustration to the right, from the 1975 collection Liquid Assets. Lancaster's younger contemporary Mark Boxer remarked on the way some characters such as the Canon had developed \\"square characteristics to fit into the shape of the cartoon box\\". In his wartime cartoons Lancaster often caricatured Mussolini and Hitler; later he rarely portrayed current politicians, although Knox includes a few pocket cartoons from the 1960s in which General de Gaulle, Harold Wilson and others appear.Knox, pp. 212 and 222 Richard Nixon featured in a few pocket cartoons during the Watergate scandal; in one he is drawn standing by a flushing lavatory, saying innocently, \\"Tapes? What tapes?\\"Lancaster (1975), p. 40 The novelist Anthony Powell commented that Lancaster, having carefully invented and stylised his own persona ‚Äì \\"bristling moustache, check suits, shirt and tie in bold tints\\" ‚Äì created similarly stylised characters for his cartoons, achieving \\"the traditional dramatic effectiveness of a greatly extended cast for a commedia dell'arte performance\\".Powell, Anthony. \\"Osbert Lancaster\\", The Daily Telegraph, 29 July 1986, p. 15 =Stage design= La fille mal gard√©e (1960), providing \\"an idealized, pastoral context\\" Lancaster's career designing for the theatre began and ended with Gilbert and Sullivan. His first costumes and scenery were for the Sadler's Wells Ballet's Pineapple Poll (1951), John Cranko's ballet with a story based on a Gilbert poem and music by Sullivan.\\"Sadler's Wells Ballet\\", The Times, 14 March 1951, p. 2 His last were for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer (1973). In between, he designed more productions for the Royal Ballet, as well as for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Old Vic and the West End. It was a matter of mild regret to him that of the twenty plays, operas and ballets that he designed between the two, only one was for a thoroughly serious piece, Britten's Peter Grimes, for the Bulgarian National Opera in Sofia in 1964.\\"Sir Osbert Lancaster\\", The Times, 29 July 1986, p. 18 Three of Lancaster's theatre designs have remained in use in 21st-century productions, all by the Royal Ballet: Pineapple Poll, La fille mal gard√©e and Copp√©lia.\\"Copp√©lia\\", Royal Opera House. Retrieved 30 January 2020 In an article on the second in 2016, Danielle Buckley wrote, \\"Lancaster's surrealist and stylized designs for Fille amplify the story's pantomime quality, and the exaggerated burlesque of its comedy ‚Äì but the backdrops of fields that roll into the distance, bundles of hay, dreamy skies and village cottages provide the idealized, pastoral context that the story needs\\".Buckley, Danielle. \\"How La Fille mal gard√©e creates pastoral magic through 'Marmite' cartoons\\" , Royal Opera House, 7 October 2016, retrieved 11 February 2018 Buckley adds that Lancaster's designs have been criticised for locating the ballet in no particular time or place ‚Äì \\"except, that is, of a 1960s London view of idyllic country life\\". Lancaster's stated view was that stage sets and costumes should reflect reality, but \\"through a lens, magnifying and slightly over-emphasising everything which it reflects\\".Lucie-Smith, p. 169. Sir Geraint Evans commented on how Lancaster's designs helped the performer: \\"[His] design for Falstaff was superb: it gave me clues to understanding the character, and reflected that marvellous, subtle sense of humour which was present in all his work.\\"Quoted on cover p. iv of Lucie-Smith Character and views Lancaster's old-fashioned persona, together with his choice of a countess as his principal cartoon mouthpiece, led some to assume his politics were on the right of the spectrum. But despite what he described as his strong traditionalist feelings he was a floating voter: \\"I've voted Tory and Labour in my time and I think once, in a moment of total mental aberration, voted Liberal.\\" He distrusted the Conservatives for what he saw as their persistent bias in favour of property developers and against conservation.Bryant, Arthur. \\"Our Note Book\\", Illustrated London News, 23 January 1965, p. 8 He rarely let his own views show obviously in his cartoons, but his hatred of political oppression was reflected in his portrayal of fascist, communist and apartheid regimes, and he refused to go to his beloved Greece while the military junta was in power from 1967 to 1974.Knox, p. 213 In religion he described himself as \\"a C of E man... with that embarrassment induced in all right-thinking men by any mention of God outside church.\\" Legacy, honours and reputation =Exhibitions= Apart from an exhibition as an undergraduate, Lancaster had four large-scale shows of his works. The first was in Norwich in 1955‚Äì56, when Betjeman opened an exhibition covering the range of Lancaster's output, including posters from the 1930s as well as cartoons, stage designs, watercolours and architectural drawings.\\"Mr Osbert Lancaster's Exhibition\\", The Times, 5 December 1955, p. 12 In 1967 a London show concentrated on his costumes and scenery, with examples of work from plays, ballets, opera and, exceptionally, film (Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, 1965).Knox, Valerie. \\"Merry-go-Round\\", The Times, 15 May 1967, p. 9 In 1973, at the instigation of Roy Strong, the National Portrait Gallery mounted \\"The Littlehampton Bequest\\", for which Lancaster painted portraits of Willy Littlehampton's supposed ancestors and offspring, in the style of artists down the centuries, from Holbein to Van Dyck and Lely, and then to Reynolds and Gainsborough and on to Sargent and Hockney. Strong wrote an introduction to the book Lancaster published of the collected portraits.Howard, Philip. \\"Drayneflete's priceless portraits on display\\", The Times, 6 March 1974, p. 14; and Ratcliffe, Michael. \\"A bequest to the nation\\", The Times, 29 November 1973, p. viii To mark the centenary of Lancaster's birth, The Wallace Collection staged an exhibition titled Cartoons and Coronets: The Genius of Osbert Lancaster from October 2008 to January 2009. It was curated by James Knox, the editor and author of a lavishly- illustrated biography and catalogue with the same title as the exhibition. \\"Exhibitions and Displays\\" , Wallace Collection, retrieved 13 February 2018 =Honours= Lancaster's honours included his knighthood, his CBE in the 1953 Coronation Honours and an honorary D.Litt from Oxford, as well as honorary degrees from Birmingham (1964), Newcastle upon Tyne (1970), and St Andrews (1974). =Reputation= In 2008, the year of Lancaster's centenary, Peter York called him \\"A national treasure... arguably Britain's most popular newspaper cartoonist, certainly our most effective, popular architectural historian and illustrator and one of the most inspired 20th-century theatre, opera and ballet designers.\\" But York added that in recent years Lancaster had been largely forgotten: \\"People under 40 don't know him\\", as they still knew Betjeman from his many television programmes.York, Peter. \\"Osbert Lancaster: The original style guru\\" , The Independent, 19 September 2008 The Oxford Companion to English Literature called Lancaster \\"a writer, artist, cartoonist, and theatre designer, whose many illustrated works gently mock the English way of life: he was particularly good at country‚Äêhouse and upper‚Äêclass architecture and mannerisms, but also had a sharp eye for suburbia.\\"\\"Osbert Lancaster\\" , The Concise Oxford Companion to English Literature, Oxford University Press, retrieved 2 February 2018 The obituary in The Times described him as \\"the most polite and unsplenetic of cartoonists, he was never a crusader, remaining always a witty, civilized critic with a profound understanding of the vagaries of human nature.\\" Sir Roy Strong wrote that Lancaster's cartoons were those \\"of a gentleman of the old school... He never crossed into the brilliant savagery of Gerald Scarfe or Spitting Image. The one-liners in his pocket cartoons were Cowardesque\\". Although he was much praised at the time ‚Äì Anthony Powell said, \\"Osbert kept people going by his own high spirits and wit\\" ‚Äì Lancaster was conscious that the work of a political cartoonist is ephemeral, and he did not expect longevity for his topical drawings.Strong, Roy. \\"Knight of laughter\\", The Times, 27 September 2008, p. 27 His legacy as a pocket cartoonist has been the genre itself; his successors in the national press have included Mel Calman, Michael Heath, Marc, Matt and Trog. Despite the topical nature of Lancaster's cartoons, they remain of interest to the historian; Lucie-Smith quotes a contemporary tribute by Moran Caplat: \\"No social history of this [20th] century will be complete without him. He has joined the handful of artists who, over the last three hundred years, have each in their time mirrored our nation.\\" The Times said of Lancaster's stage designs, \\"When the history of Glyndebourne comes to be written, high in the roll of honour will stand the name of Osbert Lancaster, who has the great gift of designing d√©cor that invigorates every opera\\".Quoted in Knox, p. 133 But although theatre designs are less ephemeral than topical cartoons, in general they have a practical lifetime measured in years or at most a few decades.Boston, pp. 224‚Äì225Higgins, Charlotte. Why is opera so expensive? , The Guardian, 29 November 2001 The survival of Lancaster's costumes and scenery for Pineapple Poll and La fille mal gard√©e into the 21st century is exceptional, and most of even his highest-praised productions for repertory works have been succeeded by new designs by artists from Hockney to Ultz.Lucie-Smith, pp. 173‚Äì174; and Christiansen, Rupert ‚ÄúFalstaff at Glyndebourne , The Daily Telegraph, 26 May 2009 Lancaster's prose style divided opinion. Betjeman teased him that it was \\"deliciously convoluted\\"; Boston and Knox both echo this view. But Beaverbrook's right-hand man, George Malcolm Thompson, said of Lancaster, \\"The annoying thing at the Express was that he was not only the only one who could draw; he could also write better than anyone in the building.\\"Quoted in Boston, p. 178 Lancaster's most enduring works have been his architectural books. Pillar to Post and its successors have been reissued in various editions, and at 2018 are in print as a boxed set entitled Cartoons, Columns and Curlicues, containing Pillar to Post, Homes Sweet Homes and Drayneflete Revealed.\\"Cartoons, Columns and Curlicues\\" , WorldCat, retrieved 18 February 2018 Reviewing the new edition in The Irish Times, Niall McGarrigle wrote, \\"The books are of their time, of course, but their legacy is part of the strong heritage culture that we rightly fight for today\\".McGarrigle, Niall. \\"Osbert Lancaster drew inspiration for acidic cartoons from built environment ‚Äì Cartoonist's sharp, satirical and funny works are republished in new edition\\" , The Irish Times, 16 April 2016 Alan Powers wrote in The Financial Times, \\"At least old buildings are now cherished rather better, and the house fronts around Lancaster's birthplace in Notting Hill are jollied up in his favourite pinks and mauves... now we understand that the compact streets and houses of the past provide the best opportunity for social encounters and save energy, and that even bad buildings can make us smile.
