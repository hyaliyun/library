History  The Office of Comptroller General of the Republic (Oficina de la Contraloría General de la República) was designed partially following the recommendations of a Mission of US economic advisers led by Edwin Walter Kemmerer. The office was finally established during the administration of Carlos Ibáñez in 1927. The first head of the office was the lawyer Pablo Ramírez who simultaneously served as Minister of Finance. In 1943 the office was upgraded to an autonomous government organ through an amendment to the constitution (Law 7,727) and was retained as such in the constitution of 1980.  Functions  Charged with serving as the government's auditor, it must take part in the approval or rejection of the revenue and investment accounts of public funds, scrutinizes the collection and expenditure of government funds by the National Treasury, the municipalities, and other state services as determined by law. The office also performs a legality review function called \\"toma de razón\\". Exercising this ex-ante review power, the comptroller scrutinises, on constitutional and legal grounds, executive decisions and regulations prior to their official publication or communication. In practice, this checking procedure may represent an effective veto point in the Chilean administrative process. Another aspect of the legal control function of the office consists in its power to issue legally binding opinions on issues concerning the laws that govern administrative bodies and procedures. Both public entities and private parties can request the office to clarify any point of law arising from the functioning of public services. The access to the office is therefore remarkably broad. In practice, the exercise of the interpretive power has entailed that many practitioner use the office as an administrative tribunal which work alongside the ordinary judiciary in the country.  Transparency  Over the years, the agency gained a reputation for insisting on strict conformity to the law, instilling respect in career officials and elected officials alike. 2009 the General Accounting Office of the Republic was ranked fourth in the VI Barometer of Access to Public Information, study reflecting the perception the media has in terms of transparency and cooperation of various Agencies of public importance in the country. In 2008 the position of the Contraloría was five places lower.

Samuels (December 3, 1919 – October 26, 1984), an American statesman, industrialist, civil rights activist and philanthropist who served as U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce and Director of the Small Business Administration under President Johnson, and special advisor to the campaign for president by John F. Kennedy and the administration of President Carter.  Early life and background  Samuels was raised in upstate New York in Canandaigua, the son of Howard and Barbara Samuels. His father Howard J. Samuels served as U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce under President Lyndon B. Johnson and was Director of the Small Business Administration and founded Kordite, now known as Pactive. In 1974 his father ran for Governor with Mario Cuomo as his Lieutenant Governor ultimately losing to Hugh Carey. Samuels was active in his father's campaign as a young adult. Bill Samuels attended MIT where he earned undergraduate degrees in political science, economics, and engineering. He later graduated from Harvard Law School. Samuels built an education company, APC Skills, for entry level workers, with divisions in Brazil, Europe, Mexico, and Asia that merged in 1987 with the Alexander Proudfoot company. In 1988, it became a publicly traded company on the London exchange (symbol MMC). Subsequently, he built ACTV, a public company on the NASDAQ (symbol IATV) which was responsible for 50 patents on intellectual property specifically for interactive television which led to a sale of the company to an affiliate of Liberty Media. Samuels currently partners with this brother Howard C. Samuels in his drug treatment center in Los Angeles, known as the Hills Treatment Center. Samuels lives with his daughter, Kitty, and his wife, Marie, in downtown NYC.  1970s activism  In 1971, Samuels became involved in the anti-war movement and raised money for the 1971 Vietnam Veterans Against the War March on Washington. Samuels participated in a lawsuit against the 1972 Democratic National Convention along with Shirley Chisholm and others, that argued that the one man, one vote Supreme Court ruling required one Democrat, one-vote apportionment of delegates at the 1972 Democratic Convention. The lawsuit failed. He was also a founding member of the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP) which was involved with promoting social investment.  Political career   Legal advocacy  Samuels filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Gramercy Park Trust in 2001 after groups of fourth and fifth grades were removed from the park. The lawsuit ended with a large financial settlement for the students for the treatment they had received.  New York State Senate Democratic campaign  Samuels founded the Blue Tiger Democrats in 2004, a research project that did projects in Michigan and New York on how to use civic engagement to reconnect the Democratic Party to its communities between election cycles. In 2005 Samuels turned his attention to reforming Albany and provided the initial funding for a liberal blog that runs issue and advocacy campaigns known as the Albany Project.Worker, Howard. \\"The Albany Project: New York's Biggest Liberal Blog Catches Attention.\\" Yahoo News. July 26, 2008.Anderson, Phillip \\"Hey, NYS! We're Bringing Back The Albany Project.\\" Daily Kos. October 21, 2014. In 2006 and 2007, Samuels was a speaker at the Milken Institute Global Conference. His speeches focused on how to make political parties and the process more respected. In 2006, he was named by Eliot Spitzer as Vice Finance Chairman for the New York Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, and became Chairman in 2008, regaining control of the New York State Senate for the Democratic Party for the first time in decades. However, the new Democratic leadership soon lost their majority when Democratic Senator Pedro Espada defected to the Republican Party.  2010 Lieutenant Governor campaign  In April 2010, Bill Samuels announced his campaign for lieutenant governor, independent of Andrew Cuomo. Samuels' goal was to leverage the position's ceremonial role as State Senate President to achieve what he believed to be fundamental change in Albany through pillars of reform: Fiscal reform, Redistricting reform, Campaign finance reform, ethics reform. However, after discussions with the Andrew Cuomo campaign, and Cuomo's promise to change the old culture of how Albany was run and to support an early Constitutional Convention vote in 2011, Samuels ended his campaign in order to focus his energy on his effort to oust corrupt Senator Pedro Espada and bring reform to Albany.http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2010/06/05/samuels-drops-lg-bid-indy- party-backs-wilson-for-comptroller Nevertheless, Cuomo kept none of his promises.  Independent Expenditure Committee  Samuels formed the New Roosevelt Initiative, an independent expenditure committee concerned with New York's fiscal practices, ethics rules, redistricting policies, and campaign finance practices.New Roosevelt: About Bill In 2009, New Roosevelt hired Benjamin Kallos, now a New York City Councilman, as Executive Director. Samuels and New Roosevelt were among the first to call for unity behind Gustavo Rivera who he endorsed in July 2010.http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/29275/samuels-goes-all-in- for-rivera/ New Roosevelt opened an office in the Bronx, built a field organization, did eight direct mailings and organized a large get out the vote effort. On September 15, 2010, Gustavo Rivera defeated the disgraced incumbent Espada by a margin of nearly 2 to 1.http://thealbanyproject.com/diary/8793/pedro-tossed Since the election, Senator Pedro Espada has been convicted of civil and criminal charges. Common Cause honored him with the Common Cause Democracy in Action award at their annual awards dinner on Tuesday November 29, 2011. = Constitutional change = In January 2012, Samuels, concerned with what he believed to be Cuomo's lack of commitment to fundamentally changing how Albany functions, launched the Citizens Committee for an Effective Constitution at EffectiveNY.org that was devoted to raising awareness of New York State constitutional changes that he believed would increase transparency and end corrupt practices. EffectiveNY.org focuses on a wide range of needed reforms from high-profile issues like campaign finance and redistricting to those that are often unknown but equally important, like the message of necessity. The effort was bipartisan, with Samuels, an active Democrat, teaming up with Republican Assembly Minority Leader Brian Kolb and Professor Gerald Benjamin from SUNY New Paltz. In 2017 the voters will decide if there should be a Constitutional Convention. Samuels’ father, Howard Samuels, had created a similar bi-partisan organization by the same name in 1965 that proposed many of the same recommendations for reform that remain undone today.https://newspaperarchive.com/oneonta-star/1967-08-10/ In preparation for the 2017 referendum on a Constitutional Convention, Samuels started www.nypeoplesconvention.org, a website dedicated to mobilizing voters to change a \\"badly antiquated constitution.\\" The website features analyzes of numerous reforms that Samuels believes needs to be added to the state's constitution. = Redistricting = Samuels helped finance a losing lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the gerrymandered New York State Senate lines following the 2000 Census.  2014 Lieutenant Governor campaign  In an effort to get Cuomo to endorse progressive stands,Vielkind, Jimmy \\"Bill Samuels finally falls in behind Cuomo.\\" Politico New York.

The clips were published under the title Stari obrazi (Old Faces) by someone who signed himself as stariobrazi (oldfaces). The publication happened during the term of the Prime Minister Borut Pahor, just before the early 2011 Slovenian parliamentary election on 4 December. The first of the clips published was dated to 31 January 2008, when Janez Janša was the Prime Minister. The second and the third clip was dated to 23 April 2009, respectively 23 April and 30 April 2009, when Borut Pahor was the Prime Minister. The original recordings were produced in audio and video. They were stored on DVDs and locked in a safe available only to authorised personnel. They were also available at home to three people via the Spectiva remote viewing software, but due to their low quality, the probability of Spectiva being the source of the leaked data has been estimated as low, and it was not used during the term of Pahor's government. Spectiva could be misused until July 2009. It seems most probable that the recordings originated from the recording room or were transferred with additional equipment from the press room of the government; till 2009, sessions were broadcast live there so that extracts of resolutions could be made by the authorised personnel. Marjan Miklavčič, an expert in intelligence services and a lecturer at the University of Maribor, compared the publication to WikiLeaks. He particularly stressed that it was not known which data had been stolen and whether they could be used for extortion. Iztok Prezelj, who lectures on intelligence at the University of Ljubljana, stated that the publication showed a parallel state to exist in Slovenia. Miklavčič confirmed that all the data publicly available indicate the thesis about a parallel state to be correct. Content The ministers of Janša's government, Andrej Vizjak and Mojca Kucler Dolinar, were discussing the wages of judges. The recordings of Pahor's sessions showed the Foreign Minister Samuel Žbogar reporting about the pressures from the European Union on Slovenia regarding the Slovenian blockade of Croatian entry to the Union and the Interior Minister Katarina Kresal discussing the acquisition of water cannons for the Slovenian Police. Investigation On 9 December, it was reported that the Slovenian Police had started investigation about the clips. On 14 December, the Government spokesperson Darijan Košir explained that in 2006, government areas were renovated. He said that the recorded sessions were held at Gregorčič Street 20 (; Government and Presidential Palace) and the recording room was at Gregorčič Street 25. The buildings were connected with of cable. The system could be abused at several points. The works at Gregorčič Street 25 were carried out by the construction company SCT, and the computer infrastructure was set up by the companies ADM and TSE. Košir told that all the people with access to the data were thoroughly checked. On 12 December, after the Secretariat filed a criminal complaint, the Police requested an internal report from the Secretary-General Kamnar. On 15 December, TSE denied having spotted any anomalies in the computer system since it had been installed. They told that all their employees were checked and that they never received any instruction that would allow for an illegal access. They also pointed out that the Government was responsible for the security of the system after it had been taken over. The telephone number of ADM was unavailable. Rumors about a slow investigation due to long preparation of report by the Secretary-General appeared. Both the minister of interior and the Secretary-General denied this. On 11 January 2012, an inspectional surveillance, ordered by the Information Commissioner Nataša Pirc Musar, was carried out by the Inspectorate for Protection of Personal Data at the Secretary–General. As of 27 January 2012, the findings were not available yet. The results will influence the decision of the Government about the destruction of the original session recordings. On 26 January 2012, the Secretariat-General of the Government issued a report about an internal investigation that failed to find the perpetrator. However, it was found out that the clips were carefully chosen and taken out of context, giving them a different meaning than they would have in the whole. They were alienated after they had been processed in the recording room. This significantly narrowed the number of supply locations and the circle of possible suspects. The highest risk was associated with the human factor. The Secretariat–General identified the crimes of betrayal of secrets, misuse of position, unauthorized image recording, and an information system attack. Due to lack of jurisdiction of the Government, further investigation would be carried out by the Police. On 27 January 2012, Helena Kamnar, the Secretary-General of the Government, unofficially told for media that three people had access to the Spectiva remote viewing software, and could also watch the sessions from their home. Kamnar also explained that it was possible to find out who had access in which period but had no information due to the Police having confiscated one of the computers. On 28 January 2012, she told that according to the information she had received from the person who allocated the right to use the system, the three people were Janez Janša, the former Secretary-General Božo Predalič, and the former Secretary-General Milan M. Cvikl. They only had the possibility to use it in their respective terms. Predalič told that he used it perhaps twice, because he was present at Janša's sessions and did not have the option to use it during Pahor's sessions. Cvikl told that he refused to use it as it seemed redundant to him and due to security reasons even demanded it to be uninstalled. The confiscated computers were returned to the Secretary-General on 31 January 2012. The next morning, Kamnar found the doors of the secretary open and reasoned that someone had broken in. Nothing was stolen. The Government officially denied any evidence that a criminal act had happened. There were guesses whether the two events could be related, but Kamnar decided there would be no investigation, as the possibility of it being successful was slim and she was to be replaced by the new government. Since February 2012, the government is again led by Janša, and the Secretary-General is again Predalič. On 27 March 2012, the information commissioner reported that the measures for the safeguarding of the recordings were inadequate. Although the places where the recording device was situated and the recordings were kept were guarded, there were no revision marks on them, which would enable the tracing of their production, usage, viewing and processing. The law on the protection of personal data was not broken. In September 2012, the pre-trial procedure had not been completed yet by the Police. Response by the Government On 7 December, the Secretary-General of the Government filed a criminal complaint against the unknown perpetrator and notified about the incident the Criminal Police Directorate and the Office for the Protection of Classified Information. On 8 December, the Slovenian government demanded the removal of the clips from YouTube. On 9 December in the evening, when the publication was reported for the first time by media, there were three clips remaining of the allegedly original five although none had been removed by the host. YouTube had removed the clips on 15 December 2011, after a copyright- related demand by the Slovenian Computer Emergency Response Team (SI–CERT). However, on the same day they appeared again, albeit shorter. They were removed again in less than 24 hours. The clips were republished by users who downloaded them after they have been found by media. The original perpetrator as well as the uploaders were unknown. The decision about the destruction of the original governmental recordings has not been made yet, pending the results of an inspectional surveillance. After the incident, the recordings were not produced until 26 January. Since then, they have been made only in audio and have been destroyed immediately after extracts had been made. They are not transmitted via cable to another building anymore. In April 2012, the deputy of the Secretary-General stated that the affair cannot repeat itself, because the government had implemented the traceability of users of governmental session video recordings. Previous leakages A tone clip of a closed government session was inadvertently leaked to the website of the Government already on 2 July 2009. It showed Katarina Kresal, the former Minister of the Interior, and Irma Pavlinič Krebs, the former Minister of Public Administration, in a wrangle about the number of the policemen in Slovenia, and had a large echo in the public. Krebs later commented: \\"I didn't know that our areas have ears.\\" References Category:2011 in Slovenia Category:2012 in Slovenia Category:Classified documents Category:Government of Slovenia Category:2011 controversies Category:YouTube controversies Category:2011 YouTube videos Category:Political controversies in Slovenia Category:National security in Slovenia Category:Signals intelligence Category:December 2011 events in Europe ","title":"2011 Slovenian YouTube incident"},{"id":"34006687","text":"Richard Bignell may refer to: *Richard Bignell, member of the Doctor Who Restoration Team *Richard Bignell, British Rugby Union footballer, currently playing for Moseley Rugby Football Club *Richard Bignell, former head master of Exhall Grange School in Coventry, United Kingdom See also * Bignell (disambiguation) ","title":"Richard Bignell"},{"id":"34006688","text":"Asmundson is a surname.

Plot 75-year-old Dr. Nathaniel Shellner has led an extraordinary life as a psychiatrist, working with traumatized patients fleeing war zones in refugee camps, earning himself a Nobel Prize for his work. After having one child, Leonard, with his wife, Lillian, the Shellners elect to adopt the remainder of their family from the camps where Dr. Shellner worked. Ultimately, the Shellners incorporated three children from all over the world into their family – Tommy, Julie, and Harry. As Dr. Shellner lies on his death bed on a frigid, icy day on the fringes of New York City in suburban New Jersey, the family convenes at the house where the couple raised the children for a final, bittersweet farewell to a sensational and inspiring public figure. Or, that's the idea, until all hell breaks loose after Tommy arrives and accuses his father of adopting his children, not out of concern for their future well-being, but to use them for some warped psychological experiment. The proceedings from Tommy's accusation forward during the remainder of the evening offer a cocktail of incidents between the family members own interpersonal issues and a relentless exploration of the clues Tommy manufactures as evidence of his father's alleged wrongdoing. The allegations not only stun the family, they stir up anger and resentment, not only because of Dr. Shellner’s failing health, but also because he has been held up as a paragon of selflessness and virtue not only within the family but from all his public recognition and numerous awards he was festooned with. As Tommy relentlessly pursues his own 'evidence' of his father's ostensible experiments with his children's minds and feelings, he simultaneously stirs up a whole load of simmering resentments, shifting alliances, and old traumas form the family's internal relations and dynamics.

He inherited Hachberg-Sausenberg when his father died in 1352. As he was a minor at the time, his uncle Otto I acted as regent. When Rudolf II came of age, he and Otto I ruled jointly, until Otto's death in 1384. Rudolf III is considered the most important of the Margraves of Hachberg-Sausenberg.Fritz Schülin: Rötteln- Haagen, Beiträge zur Orts-, Landschafts- und Siedlungsgeschichte, Lörrach 1965; p. 65. Reign   Construction activities  Rudolf III initiated a number of construction projects. Two gatehouses, one large building and a tower were added to his residence Rötteln Castle in 1360. In 1387 and 1392, other large buildings were added. In 1401, he built a church in the village of Rötteln (now the Evangelical Church). In 1418, he expanded this church to the main church of his territory. Rudolf's tomb and the tomb of his second wife, Anna, both in this church, are considered major examples of Gothic art in the Upper Rhine.Karl Seith: Die Burg Rötteln im Wandel ihrer Herrengeschlechter, Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte und Baugeschichte der Burg, Röttelbund e.V., Haagen, undated  Expansion of the country's sovereignty  During his long reign, Rudolf was able to extend his country's sovereignty significantly: * In 1365, he exchanged the village Huttinger against Höllstein (with the Bishop of Basel) * In 1366, he received a share of Sausenberg from his uncle Otto I * In 1368 he purchased the villages of Weil am Rhein, Wintersweiler, Welmlingen, plus some manors in Haltingen and the city and district of Otlikon from Knight Konrad of Münch.Regesten der Markgrafen..., Vol. 1, deed number h690 He also purchased Dossebach from William of Hauenstein and his son Henman of Hauenstein * In 1394, Bishop Conrad of Münch, enfeoffed him with a fief in BreisgauRegesten der Markgrafen..., Vol. 1, deed number h799 and h800 * In 1400, he purchased the Lordship of Neuenstein, including the villages of Gersbach, Schlechtbach, Raitbach, Kürnberg and Schweigmatt.Regesten der Markgrafen..., Vol. 1, deed number h857 Neuenstein Castle had been enfoeffed to the monastery of St. Blasien, but in 1401, the monastery renounced its rights on the castle.Regesten der Markgrafen..., Vol. 1, deed number h859  Marriage and issue  Rudolf III first married Adelheid of Lichtenberg and later Anne of Freiburg-Neuchâtel. On 13 February 1387, Rudolf closed a marriage contract with Konrad of Freiburg and Else of Neuchâtel for Konrad's 13-year-old sister Anna. Her dowry would be , in the form of the city and district of Sennheim valued at 7500 florins, Istein Castle, valued at 3000 florins, 1500 florins in cash, on the condition that he would use it to create manors in the area between Hauenstein, the forest and the mountains on both sides of the river, within one year after the wedding.Regesten der Markgrafen von Baden und Hachberg, vol. 1, deed number h751 With Anne, he had seven sons and six daughters. One son and three daughters fell victim to the plague in 1420. His son Otto (1388–1451) was Bishop of Constance from 1411 to 1434 as Otto III of Hachberg and was the host of the Council of Constance in 1415. As such, he was involved in the burning at the stake of the Czech reformer Jan Hus. The only other son to survive him, was the youngest, William, who succeeded him in 1428.

More than 30 two-reel \\"Shorty\\" titles were released between 1914 and 1917. All featured Hamilton as the \\"Shorty\\" character, a cowboy with a trained horse--his \\"remarkably intelligent horse, Beauty.\\" The films were initially produced by Thomas H. Ince, many were written by the veteran screenwriter C. Gardner Sullivan. (\\"The feature picture at the Bijou Theatre for the remainder of the week is the Broncho two-reel film, 'Shorty and Sherlock Holmes,' the latest release of the well known Shorty stories by C. Gardner Sullivan and Thomas H. Ince.\\") The 1915 \\"Shorty's Ranch\\" was the last entry from the original producers, and after a year the series was revived by Monogram Pictures in January 1917. Directors in the series included Francis Ford and Jay Hunt. Aside from the trained horse, Hamilton's co-stars in the \\"Shorty\\" pictures included Enid Markey, Betty Burbridge, and Charles Ray. The films placed \\"Shorty\\" into a series of improbable comic adventures: inheriting a harem, posing as a judge, joining the Secret Service, going to college, and confronting a wide range of characters including loan sharks, ghosts, and moonshiners. In March 1917, a newspaper reviewer of the latest \\"Shorty\\" film wrote the following about Hamilton: > Shorty Hamilton is a fascinating little chap who makes you want to clasp him > by the hand and call him friend. He is a gifted actor who can make you laugh > or lift you to the extreme pinnacle of nervous anticipation in the same > breath.

It is the administrative center of the Dekese territory of Kasai province. History Dekese was founded as a colonial post by Alexandre Delcommune around 1888. The territory is isolated. Roads are impassable and radio reception is very poor. The region suffered badly during the Second Congo War. In December 2001 there was an Ebola scare. Uganda, which was occupying the area, decided to screen all soldiers on their return home. The Kinshasa government asked the World Health Organization to help open a humanitarian corridor so they could also use the general hospital and medical personnel of Dekese. However, the illness had a much lower death rate than Ebola, with most of the victims being children under five and adults over 55, and appeared to be a respiratory disease. In October 2006 an outbreak of monkeypox was reported. The isolation of the region made it difficult to fight the epidemic. The territory suffered from continued communal conflicts. In 2010, of 176 such conflicts reported in the former Kasaï Occidental province, 38 were in Dekese Territory. In May 2011, after the governor of Kasai Occidental had been removed from office and a few days before the election of his successor, 40 soldiers arrived in Dekese, first in the town and then spreading out into the territory. They committed abuses including arbitrary arrests, looting and rape of women and minors. The purpose seemed to be to disrupt the elections. Transportation Dekese has an associated airport nearby.

Intentionally causing a helmet-to-helmet collision is a penalty in most football leagues, including many high school leagues. Despite its long association with American football, this type of contact is now considered to be dangerous play by league authorities due to the potential of causing serious injury. Major football leagues, such as the National Football League (NFL), Canadian Football League (CFL), and NCAA, have taken a tougher stance on helmet-to-helmet collisions after the US Congress launched an investigation into the effects repeated concussions have on football players and the new discoveries of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Other possible injuries include head traumas, spinal cord injuries, and even death. Helmet manufacturers are constantly improving their designs in order to best protect their users against injuries from such collisions. The crackdown on helmet-to- helmet collisions has resulted in reappraisals of the sport. An image of two helmets smashing together—which had been a staple for 20 years—was dropped in 2006 from Monday Night Football on ESPN. The NFL also ordered Toyota Motor Company to stop using a similar helmet collision in its advertisements. Rules by league * The Canadian Football League prohibits the use of the helmet to butt, ram, or spear an opponent. Players are penalized for what is not deemed to be an 'acceptable' football play. * In the NCAA, helmet-to- helmet collisions have been banned for years, but they were illegal only when intentional. In 2005, the NCAA took the word \\"intentional\\" out of the rules in hopes of reducing these incidents even further. Beginning with the 2013 season, players who are flagged for such hits are automatically ejected from the game in addition to a 15-yard penalty, under the new \\"targeting\\" rule, subject to a replay review. If the ejection occurred in the second half or in overtime, the player must also sit out the first half of his team's next scheduled game. This rule was revised in 2014 to overturn the yardage penalty in addition to the ejection if the player's hit is not flagrant. The rule was again revised in 2016 to allow replay officials to call penalties if they were missed by on-field officials and overturn incorrect penalties. http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/14930750/replay-officials- given-greater-input-targeting-penalty-calls-next-season The NCAA is currently proposing to modify the policy again to allow players to remain in the game if there is insufficient evidence for replay officials to confirm or overturn a call, but the 15 yard penalty would still be enforced. https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2017/02/15/college-footballs- rules-committee-consider-middle-ground-targeting-calls/97968808/ Beginning with the 2019 season, players who are penalized for three or more targeting fouls in the same season will receive a one-game suspension in addition to any ejection penalties. * In the NFL, helmet-to-helmet hits are banned, with a penalty of 15 yards for violations. In 2010, the NFL placed its policies pertaining to these incidents under review, considering heavy fines and suspensions. In 2017, the NFL adopted the NCAA's \\"targeting\\" rules, which will not only penalize players, but will review the play and automatically throw any offenders out from the game. The first suspension under this rule occurred on December 13, 2011: James Harrison received a single game's suspension after such a hit caused Cleveland Browns quarterback Colt McCoy to suffer a concussion. Opposition to helmet-to-helmet collision bans Despite the safety concerns, in 2010, some professional football players criticized bans on helmet-to-helmet collisions on the basis that gridiron football is a game that is supposed to be composed of the world's biggest and best athletes, and placing such restrictions \\"waters down\\" the game. The NHL is also fighting the narrative that concussions cause CTE.  Effects  Helmet to helmet collisions can cause major problems on and off the field. The main effect of helmet to helmet collisions is concussions. There are about 3.8 million sports related concussions in the United States every year, but up to half of them are not reported. Experiencing a concussion increases one's likelihood of getting another. Head-to-head collisions and resulting concussions may occur in a variety of sports, including football, hockey and lacrosse.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Congleton, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield, and the diocese of Chester. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church replaced a \\"tin tabernacle\\" that was sold for £150 and moved to Hassall Green, where it survives as St Philip's Church. The new building was constructed between 1894 and 1896 by the Lancaster firm of architects, Austin and Paley, the church having been designed in 1884 by Hubert Austin. At this time only the east bay of the north aisle was built. The aisle was completed in 1936–37, at which time the architect was Henry Paley. It had been planned for the tower, which rises only to the height of the nave, to be higher and for a spire to be added, but this was never achieved. Architecture Exterior St Mary's is constructed in red sandstone with tiled roofs. Its plan consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a north and south porch, a chancel with an organ loft and vestry to the southeast, and a west tower. The tower has diagonal buttresses, and a semi-octagonal stair turret to the south. On its west side is a four-light window. On the south side of the church is a porch with a statue of Mary Magdalene above the doorway. To the right of this are five windows, one with two lights, the others with three lights, all containing Decorated-style tracery. Along the clerestory are five two-light windows. The windows on the north side of the church are similar, but those along the aisle all have three lights. On the south wall of the chancel are three two-light windows. The east window has six lights. Interior Between the nave and the aisle are five-bay arcades carried on elliptical piers. On the north side of the chancel is a two-bay arcade. In the south wall of the chancel are a sedilia and a piscina. The reredos and chancel screen date from 1926. The font is square with chamfered corners. The stained glass includes windows from the early 20th century designed by G. P. Hutchinson for Powells, a window by Karl Parsons dated 1926 depicting Saint Michael and Gabriel, and two windows by Heaton, Butler and Bayne dating from about 1915 and from about 1920. The three-manual organ was built in 1905 by Steele and Keay, with alterations by Rushworth and Dreaper in 1945, and by Ward and Shutt in 1978.

It was established in the spring of 1856, in the vicinity of modern Noyo. Its area was 25,000 acres (100 km2) and its boundary extended north from what is now Simpson Lane at to Abalobadiah Creek and east from the Pacific Ocean to a north–south line passing through the summit of Bald Hill. Report of the commissioner of the General Land Office, U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1870, pp.43-44 History Mendocino Indian Reservation circa 1856-1866 The area of the reservation was home to Native Americans, most of whom belonged to the Pomo tribe. They were hunter-gatherers who lived along the northern coast of California. In 1855 an exploration party from the Bureau of Indian Affairs visited the area looking for a site on which to establish a reservation and, in the spring of 1856, the Mendocino Indian Reservation was established at Noyo. Yuki, (Ukiah or Yokiah), Wappo, Pomo, Salan Pomo, Southern Pomo(Kianamaras or Gallinomero), Whilkut (Redwood) and others lived on this reservation. In the summer of 1857, First Lieutenant Horatio G. Gibson, then serving at the Presidio of San Francisco, was ordered to take Company M, 3rd Regiment of Artillery to establish a military post one and one-half miles north of the Noyo River on the Mendocino Indian Reservation. The official date of the establishment of Fort Bragg was June 11, 1857. Its purpose was to maintain order on the reservation, and protect the Indians and reservation lands from settlers. In January 1859 Gibson and Company M, 3rd Regiment of Artillery left Fort Bragg to be replaced by Company D, 6th Infantry Regiment. They stayed for two years and continued to build up the post. Following the 1858–1859 Wintoon War, the defeated Whilkut people were sent to the Mendocino Indian Reservation. Over the next year they deserted the reservation to return to their homeland in the Bald Hills and the escalating hostilities of the Bald Hills War. Anthony Jennings Bledsoe, Indian wars of the Northwest: A California sketch, Bacon & Company, San Francisco, 1885, pp.228-280 In June 1862, Federal troops had been withdrawn to the East to fight in the American Civil War, being replaced by Company D, 2nd California Infantry, that was ordered to garrison the post and remained until 1864.

He was closely associated with the Nazis, and with Adolf Hitler personally. Schachleiter first became closely associated with the NSDAP, and with Hitler, in late 1922. Originally from Mainz, he served as the long-time abbot of the Emmaus monastery in Prague before being forced out of that position in late 1918 following the establishment of the new Czechoslovak state. After brief stays at several Austrian monasteries, including St. Florian near Linz, by early 1920 he was at Munich's St. Boniface's Abbey. By September 1922 he was noticed for the radicalism of his anti-Semitic agitation and his involvement with groups like the volkisch Bund Bayern und Reich. He cultivated connections with members of Munich's Catholic elite, including w:de:Karl Alexander von Müller, professor of history at the University of Munich, and Helene Raff, whose father was the composer Joachim Raff. With Muller he discussed politics and Gregorian chant. Through these connections he first met Hitler in late 1922; the pair were observed by both Muller and Ernst Hanfstaengl engaging in lively and lengthy conversation. It was the beginning of a relationship that ended only with Schachleiter's death in 1937. The meeting opened the way for Schachleiter to play an important propagandist role on behalf of the NSDAP in the summer of 1923. Following the commemorative activities of 10 June 1923—which included a massive rally in honour of Albert Leo Schlageter, staged on Munich's Konigsplatz and attended by 20-30000 activists—a Catholic memorial Mass was held immediately after the rally in St. Boniface Abbey, organised exclusively by the NSDAP, which was presided over by Schachleiter. Hanfstaengl had sketched out for Hitler the symbolic impact a related Catholic-Nazi Mass for Schlagater would have on Munich's Catholic population—Schachleiter could also consecrate the standards of the SA. Hitler quickly agreed. Schachleiter delivered a eulogistic sermon that was remembered as having a powerful impact—a young and devoutly pious Heinrich Himmler joined the NSDAP in the wake of Schachleiters eulogy.Catholicism and the Roots of Nazism, Hastings p.133 A year later however, Schachleiter was writing to Oswald Spengler lamenting the impact of Erich Ludendorff and his anti-Catholic followers on the movement: following the refounding of the NSDAP in early 1925 the stronghold of the Nazi movement in Bavaria would no longer be Munich but rather the Protestant regions of Mittel- and Oberfranken. Schachleiter increasingly distanced himself from the NSDAP in the mid-1920s, although he maintained an idealised image of Hitler personally. Schachleiter continued for years to be angry at Ludendorff's anti- Catholic crusade following the putsch of November 1923. After maintaining his weekly Schola Gregoriana at the Allerheiligen-Hofkirche in Munich until 1930, he then moved to a newly built country house in Bad Feilnbach where he was still living when Hitler came to power in 1933. In late spring Schachleiter wrote to Cardinal Faulhaber: \\"It seems to me to be a catastrophe that the Holy Church stands aloof from the new freedom movement, whose triumph I foresaw, and that the massive uprising of the volk, which is now lifting our poor fatherland out of its misery and shame, may well go down in history as a triumph of Protestantism.\\" Derek Hastings, p.170 Faulhaber forbade Schachleiter from performing Masses within the archdiocese, and Schachleiter reluctantly refused Hitler's request for him to come to Berlin on 20 March 1933 to perform a personal Mass for the fuhrer. Hitler visited in mid-May to personally congratulate Schachleiter on his 50th anniversary as a Benedictine. His invitation to sit among the Nazi dignitaries at the Nuremberg party rally in 1934, which he accepted, (and an enduring image through Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will), showed him \\"on the sidelines as the Nazis' striking, yet thoroughly secularized, performative aesthetic played out before him.\\" Hastings, p.172 From 1933-1936 Schachleiter spent much energy campaigning against what he saw as peripheral Nazi personalities directing the Nazis in an anti-Catholic and anti-Christian direction—and particularly the ideology advanced by Alfred Rosenberg. Schachleiter regarded this as a restraint on a renewal of wide-ranging Catholic support for the NSDAP. Schachleiter eventually wrote more than two dozen appeals to a variety of Nazi officials, including Hans Lammers, but was ignored. In September 1936 he admitted privately to a friend that, \\"a believing Christian can no longer participate [in the NSDAP]; they do not want believing Christians in the party.\\" Publicly he continued to profess loyalty to the Führer and to the church.Hastings, p.173 Following his death in June 1937 the Nazis ordered a state funeral arranged by Bavarian minister-president Ludwig Siebert. A year later the editorial leadership of the Beobachter refused attempts to publish official commemorations. According to historian Derek Hastings, by 1937 Schachleiter's vision of a renewed Catholic-Nazi synthesis had become increasingly marginal.

Part of a series of storms to impact the group of islands early that year, Pat was first identified as a tropical depression on February 6 well to the northeast of the Samoan Islands. The storm steadily organized as it moved generally southeast, becoming a tropical cyclone on February 8\\\\. Turning to the south, intensification began in earnest and the system acquired hurricane-force winds within 48 hours of being named. The wide system displayed annular characteristics and a wide eye. Pat reached its peak strength early on February 10 as a severe tropical cyclone with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) and a barometric pressure of 960 mbar (hPa; 28.35 inHg). Hours later it struck Aitutaki, producing gusts in excess of 185 km/h (115 mph) on the island. Hostile wind shear then prompted rapid weakening of the cyclone. The system degraded below gale-intensity on February 11, just 24 hours after it peaked, and was last noted early on February 12\\\\. Battering Aitutaki with wind gusts in excess of 185 km/h (115 mph), Cyclone Pat devastated the island. Approximately 78 percent of homes were damaged, with 72 structures destroyed. The electrical grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost. Agriculture also experienced tremendous impact, with most crops completely lost. Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US$13.7 million; however, casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported. Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm, with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government. A reconstruction plan was enacted by the Cook Islands within a month and subsequently funded by New Zealand. Owing to its destructive effects, the name Pat was later retired and replaced with Pili. Meteorological history Between January and March 2010, the Australian monsoon trough extended unusually far east over the southern Pacific Ocean. With above-average sea surface temperatures, stemming from a moderate-strength El Niño, multiple low pressure systems were able to develop across the region. An unusual spree of tropical cyclogenesis in rapid succession ensued, including four hurricane-strength storms: Oli, Pat, Rene, and Tomas. On February 6, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) began monitoring a tropical depression, dubbed 09F, well to the northeast of the Samoan Islands. Embedded within a well-developed trough, the system displayed curved convective banding features. Environmental conditions in the area, including low wind shear, high ocean heat content, and upper-level outflow, favored cyclogenesis. Additionally, an active Madden–Julian oscillation phase moving into the region was expected to bolster development. Steady improvement of the system's convective structure ensued and early on February 7, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. The low trekked generally east-southeast in response to a near-equatorial ridge anchored to the north. The storm's appearance continued to improve and Dvorak classifications rose to T2.5, indicating gale-force winds were likely present. Accordingly, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system at 18:00 UTC and dubbed it Tropical Cyclone 14P. Forecasters noted, however, that the small size of the cyclone could lead to erroneously low Dvorak estimates. The FMS followed suit six hours later and assigned the name Pat to the cyclone, assessing it as a Category 1 on the Australian cyclone scale. Convection became increasingly symmetric on February 8, and a small eye feature appeared on microwave satellite imagery. Spanning no more than , the developing storm began a gradual turn to the south as steering currents shifted from the equatorial ridge to a subtropical ridge. Based on increasing Dvorak numbers, the JTWC assessed Pat to have reached hurricane-intensity by 06:00 UTC on February 9. The eye feature became more pronounced throughout the day, with convection consolidating inward and becoming more symmetric. Accordingly, the FMS accordingly upgraded Pat to a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone by 18:00 UTC. The system became annular in nature on February 10, characterized by a lack of prominent banding features and uniform convection which surrounded its wide eye. Pat reached its peak intensity at 06:00 UTC that day as it began turning to the southwest. Maximum winds were estimated at 140 km/h (85 mph) alongside a barometric pressure of 960 mbar (hPa; 28.35 inHg). At the same time, the JTWC assessed Pat to have been a Category 2-equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with one-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). Weakening began shortly thereafter as wind shear over the system increased. Pat passed directly over the island of Aitutaki between 12:00 and 18:00 UTC. The low-level center of Pat began decoupling from convection late on February 10 once it cleared Aitutaki. The storm rapidly weakened amid strong shear, with the center being left completely exposed early on February 11\\\\. A solitary band remained along the south side of the storm by that time, and the FMS no longer considered it a tropical cyclone after 06:00 UTC. The lone band of convection dissipated later that day and with no residual thunderstorm activity, the skeletal low turned westward in response to westerly flow. The JTWC maintained Pat as a tropical storm until 18:00 UTC and as a tropical depression until its dissipation early on February 12. Preparations 250px Starting on February 7, tropical cyclone alerts and later gale warnings were issued for the northern Cook Islands under the anticipation of gale-force winds impacting populated islands. The first of these islands were Manihiki, Rakahanga, and Suwarrow. As the storm moved southward, the advisories shifted accordingly. Strong wind warnings were raised for Pukapuka, Nassau, and Penryhn on February 8; however, they were dropped later that day as Cyclone Pat moved away. Alerts on potential gales in the southern Cook Islands also began on February 8, including the islands of Atiu, Aitutaki, Manuae, Mitiaro, and Takutea. Gale warnings for Aitutaki, Palmerston, and Rarotonga began on February 9 and extended to Mauke the next day. Early on February 10, a hurricane warning was issued for Aitutaki. With the core of Pat's destructive winds forecast to pass close to or over the island, sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) and gusts of 185 km/h (115 mph) were anticipated. The aforementioned warnings were allowed to expire once Pat cleared the Cook Islands on February 11 and was no longer a threat. Emergency centers were prepped across the northern Cook Islands on February 8. The Cook Islands Chapter of the Red Cross took early action with Cyclone Pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on February 9\\\\. Volunteers from the organization assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on Aitutaki. Anticipating high winds, residents tied down homes with rope and wire and boarded up windows with shutters. Similar preparations took place on Rarotonga, though the main concern there was storm surge. Government offices and schools there were closed on February 11. Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters. Authorities later announced that they were under-prepared for Cyclone Pat. The lack of an official process during an emergency was cited as a core issue. Impact Passing directly over Aitutaki on February 10, Pat produced wind gusts in excess of 185 km/h (115 mph) making it one of the most powerful storms ever experienced by residents on the island. It is also considered among the most damaging on the island. Aitutaki Mayor Tai Herman claimed the winds to be much stronger, with gusts up to 240 km/h (150 mph) during the worst of the storm. These winds were above building codes at the time, which required structures to be able to withstand winds of . Numerous trees and power lines fell amid the powerful winds, cutting power to the entirety of the island and severing communications. According to the Government of the Cook Islands, 78 percent of the homes on the island sustained damage. Of the 277 affected homes, 59 sustained minor damage, 51 moderate, 95 major, and 72 were destroyed. Severity of damage correlated with the age of each home, with buildings over 25 years old suffering the greatest impact. Collateral damage took place when debris from damaged or destroyed structures became airborne and struck other buildings. Hardest hit were the villages of Nikaupara and Tautu. Costs to homes amounted to NZ$15 million (US$10.6 million). One building at the Seventh Day Adventist church primary school collapsed while another sustained severe damage. Although damage occurred at Vaitau School, it was utilized as an evacuation shelter. The primary school and college in Araura also suffered damage. The island's electrically run water supply was substantially effected. A total of 568 homes lost access to clean water, with many waters tanks damaged or destroyed. Aitutaki's only hospital fared well through the storm, with some roof damage and flooded rooms. Infrastructural losses totaled to NZ$2.3 million (US$1.6 million), mainly stemming from the power grid. The agricultural sector sustained extensive damage, amounting to US$1.5 million, with some crops experiencing a total loss. The severity of damage raised concerns about food security in the months after the storm. Particularly hard-hit was the mango crop, which was to be harvested two weeks after Pat struck. Approximately 60–75 percent of the coconut trees and 75 percent of java plum, mango, and kapok trees sustained damage. Most trees had at least one branch torn off and in most cases, multiple branches. Additionally, the blue lorikeet (Vini peruviana), a bird native to French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, population suffered dramatic losses due to the storm, with the population on Aitutaki dropping by more than 50 percent. All told, losses from Pat amounted to US$13.7 million. However, Dr. Russell Howorth from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) stated that damage reached US$8.2 million. In comparison, the collective damage from cyclones in the Cook Islands since 1955 was US$47 million according to the SPC. In contrast to the severity of damage, no fatalities and only eight minor injuries took place. Fearing similar damage to Aitutaki, a pre-emptive state of emergency was issued for Rarotonga. This was soon lifted as Pat ultimately spared Rarotonga and little damage took place there. Gale-force winds and heavy rains impacted Rarotonga and Palmerston islands. Large swells affected the uninhabited Penrhyn atoll, interfering with a study of marine turtles. Aftermath Infrared satellite image of Cyclone Pat as it passed over Aitutaki on February 10 Immediately following Pat's passage, the Government of the Cook Islands declared Aitutaki a disaster zone. In accordance with the FRANZ agreement, the Government of New Zealand made an initial donation of NZ$350,000 for recovery efforts prior to the formal request for assistance on February 13\\\\. Following said request, New Zealand prepped a C-130 Hercules aircraft with emergency supplies and New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) personnel which arrived in Aitutaki on February 15\\\\. The aircraft made four trips in all which provided several tonnes of aid to the island. The NZDF priority was repair of schools and hospitals, though they assisted the Red Cross with clearing debris, restoring power, and setting up temporary shelters for affected residents. The lack of access to clean water prompted significant concern, and a water and sanitation expert from the Australian Red Cross flew in on February 12 to assist with restoration efforts. Immediate provisions of 600 water bottles were sent to the island on February 16. The Red Cross subsequently began pumping and filtering water, using a truck to distribute it to the island's villages. Through September 24, they provided over 100,000 litres of clean water. Distribution of 2,050 collapsible containers and 200 hygiene kits lessened dependency on the Red Cross's water pump. An extensive repair and recovery plan was enacted by the Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with more than two-thirds of it not being funded by the final plan report on March 4\\\\. Of the NZ$15 million (US$10.6 million) in home damage, NZ$7.2 million (US$5.1 million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5 million (US$3.9 million) grant to assist in this effort. Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes, with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ$6 million (US$4.2 million) for this project. Finalization of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June, with some residents still living in tents. Farmers were provided with NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies to jump-start agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor. By February 17, 80 percent of the grid was restored; however, only 10 percent homes were actually connected. The presence of dead vegetation left behind by the storm created fire hazards across the island, prompting the government to issue a ban on burning. The Seventh Day Adventist church primary school resumed classes on February 15 despite losing a building. All other schools suspended activities until February 22; however, the approach of Tropical Depression 11F delayed this until the following day. On February 23, the European Union provided US$110,000 in emergency funds to the Cook Islands. Habitat for Humanity later sought to assist in the rebuilding process in April, with a funding goal of NZ$300,000 (US$210,000). Depression set in among members throughout the storm-battered community once the rebuilding process began. Fears of possible emigration stemming soon arose. Mayor Tai Herman feared that survivors would consider selling their homes and leave the Cook Islands altogether. Even Prime Minister Jim Marurai was reported to be left in shock by the scale of damage. The government enacted a three-month psychological support plan accordingly to help residents cope with the disaster and maintain social integrity among victims. Through September, 265 people took advantage of this program.

Rattanakosin Island () is a historic area in the Phra Nakhon District in the city of Bangkok, Thailand. It is bordered by the Chao Phraya River to the west and various canals to the east that were dug to serve as moats for what was originally the fortified city center. Situated on the eastern convex bank of a meander in the Chao Phraya River, the island is the site of the Grand Palace and Bangkok's City Pillar Shrine, among other places of historical significance. History King Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I) founded the city as the capital of his new Rattanakosin Kingdom in 1782. Before Bangkok became the capital of Thailand, the capital city was Thonburi. The old city straddled the Chao Phraya, but was mainly settled on the western bank where the royal palace and other institutions were situated. The eastern bank was mostly home to Chinese and Vietnamese (forced) settlers. When Phutthayotfa Chulalok established himself as king, he re-established the capital on the eastern bank, relocating the prior settlers to the area between Wat Sam Pluem and Wat Sampheng. (The area is now Bangkok's Chinatown.) Fortifications were ordered to be rebuilt, and canals extended to form moats around the fortified city. The inner moat, created by connecting Rong Mai Canal and Talat Canal, is now known as Khlong Khu Mueang Doem (lit. old city moat canal). Khlong Rop Krung (canal encircling city) was merged from Bang Lamphu and Ong Ang Canals. The area enclosed by Khlong Khu Mueang Doem and the river is referred to as Inner Rattanakosin, while Outer Rattanakosin refers to the originally less developed area between the two canals. Two further small canals known as Khlong Lot (tube/straw canal) connect the inner and outer moats.

LLNA has largely superseded the guinea pig maximisation test and the Buehler test. It is considered more scientific and less cruel (lower number of animals; less suffering) and has found broad scientific and regulatory acceptance. The principle underlying the LLNA is that skin sensitizers induce growth of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes draining the site of application. Lymphocyte proliferation can be measured by radiolabeling (quantifying tritiaded thymidine), bioluminescence (quantifying ATP content in lymphocytes) or immunoassay (ELISA utilizing an antibody specific for BrdU). The test material is applied to the ears of mice. Optionally, a tracer substance such as 3H-Methyl-thymidine or BrdU is injected intraperitoneally for lymphocyte incorporation. The animals are euthanized and their lymph node cells are removed and analyzed. The ratio of tracer incorporation in lymph nodes from dosed animals is compared to control animals, giving a stimulation index (SI). When the stimulation index exceeds 3 (SI > 3), a relevant sensitizing potential is assumed. In contrast to the classical guinea pig tests, the LLNA provides a quantitative measurement of sensitizing potency of a tested chemical. The LLNA may not be appropriate for certain metallic compounds, surfactants, high-molecular-weight proteins, strong dermal irritants, and materials that do not sufficiently adhere to the ear for an acceptable period of time during treatment. There is no absolute conformity in the sensitizing potential of a substance in mouse, guinea pig and human.  Regulatory  The OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals guideline No. 429 of 23 July 2010.http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-429-skin- sensitisation_9789264071100-en The REACH Regulation, Annex VII, paragraph 8.3 states \\"The Murine Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) is the first-choice method for in vivo testing. Only in exceptional circumstances should another test be used. Justification for the use of another test shall be provided.\\" According to European Guideline OECD 406 Skin Sensitization, the LLNA or the MEST (Mouse ear swelling test) can be used as a first stage in the assessment of skin sensitization potential. If a positive result is seen in either assay, a test substance may be designated as a potential sensitizer, and it may not be necessary to conduct a further guinea pig test. However, if a negative result is seen in the LLNA or MEST, a guinea pig test (preferably a GPMT or BT) must be conducted.

The song has a Bo Diddley beat and was partly inspired by the music sung by a chain gang Otis heard while he was touring. The lyrics are about a man who became famous for doing a dance with his hands, but the song has been accused of glorifying masturbation, though Otis has always denied it.Otis, Johnny, Johnny Otis:The Capitol Years, COL CD 2773, Collectables Records, Narberth PA, 2000, liner notes It has since been covered by numerous artists, including The Strangeloves, Eric Clapton, Cliff Richard, Kim Carnes, George Thorogood and The Grateful Dead. Clapton's 1974 version was also released as a single and also reached the Billboard Top 40, peaking at #26. Thorogood's 1985 version reached #25 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Lyrics and music The Johnny Otis original version of the song produced by Tom Morgan has an infectious Bo Diddley beat, in addition to resemble precisely to the hit \\"Bo Diddley\\" of Bo Diddley much of it provided by drummer Earl Palmer.Scherman, Tony, Backbeat: The Earl Palmer Story, forward by Wynton Marsalis, Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington D.C., 1999 Johnny Otis biographer George Lipsitz describes Jimmy Nolen's guitar riff on the song as \\"unforgettable\\". The music was based on a song Otis had heard a chain gang singing while touring, combined with work Otis did as a teenager when he was performing with Count Otis Matthews and the West Oakland House Stompers. The lyrics tell of a man named Willie who became famous for doing a hand jive dance. In a sense, the story is similar to that of Chuck Berry's \\"Johnny B. Goode\\", which tells of someone who became famous for playing the guitar and was released two months before \\"Willie and the Hand Jive\\". The origin of the song came when one of Otis' managers, Hal Ziegler, found out that rock'n'roll concert venues in England did not permit the teenagers to stand up and dance in the aisles, so they instead danced with their hands while remaining in their seats. At Otis' concerts, performers would demonstrate Willie's \\"hand jive\\" dance to the audience, so the audience could dance along. The dance consisted of clapping two fists together one on top of the other, followed by rolling the arms around each other. Otis' label, Capitol Records, also provided diagrams showing how to do the hand jive dance. Despite the song's references to dancing, and despite the demonstrations of the dance during performances, would-be censors believed that the song glorified masturbation. As recently as 1992, an interviewer for NPR asked Otis \\"Is 'Hand Jive' really about masturbation?\\" Otis was frustrated by this misinterpretation. Other versions Cliff Richard recorded the song in 1960 and The Strangeloves included it on their 1965 album I Want Candy. The Youngbloods released a version of the song on their 1971 album, Good and Dusty.The Youngbloods, Good and Dusty Retrieved June 12, 2015 Johnny Rivers included the song on his 1973 album Blue Suede Shoes. Eric Clapton did \\"Willie and the Hand Jive\\" on his 1974 album 461 Ocean Boulevard. Clapton slowed down the tempo for his version. Author Chris Welch believes that the song benefits from this \\"slow burn\\". Billboard described it as a \\"monster powerful cut\\" that retains elements from Clapton's previous single \\"I Shot the Sheriff.\\" However, Rolling Stone critic Ken Emerson complains that the song sounds \\"disconcertingly mournful\\". Other critics praised Clapton's confident vocals. Author Marc Roberty claimed that on this song, \\"Eric's vocals had clearly matured, with fluctuations and intonations that were convincing rather than tentative as in the past.\\" Clapton's version of the song was released as a single in 1974 and reached #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #28 in the Netherlands. It also reached #31 on the RPM magazine's top singles chart in Canada and peaked at #99 on the Oricon singles chart in Japan. Clapton included the song on his compilation album Time Pieces: Best of Eric Clapton. Clapton often played the song live, and it appeared on the live DVD One Night Only Live.

East Asia East Asia high-speed railway network China The Shanghai Maglev Train, a turnkey Transrapid maglev project, imported from Germany, is capable of an operational speed of 430 km/h and of a top speed of 501 km/h. It has connected Shanghai and Pudong International Airport since March, 2004. In April 2007, China opened several high speed rail lines between major cities, providing a network of 6,003 km, making it the world's largest high speed rail network. By 2012, China will have a 110,000 km rail network. Of that amount 13,000 km will be high speed rail, some line capable of going over 350 km/h, making CRH the largest, fastest, most technologically advanced high speed rail system in the world. However, the Maglev line has suffered from low ridership, and various expansion plans (e.g. to Hangzhou) remain stalled. The Qinshen Passenger Railway (Qinhuangdao-Shenyang), China's first conventional high- speed line between, opened in 2003 with a maximum speed of 200 km/h (to be increased to 300 km/h). The Beijing-Tianjin high-speed rail, the first in China to support 300+ km/h, opened in August 2008. The Shitai Passenger Railway (Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan) started operating on 1 April with a speed of 250 km/h. The construction of the 1,318-km Beijing-Shanghai Express Railway started in April 2008; tracklaying began in July 2010. Additional lines are also under construction so that by 2015, the high-speed railway network in China will be larger than the combined length and capacity of the rest of the world. On December 9, 2009, China test-ran the world's longest high speed railway line - the Wuhan-Guangzhou High-Speed Railway, which reduces the travel time for the nearly 1000 km from Guangzhou to Wuhan to just over 3 hours. The maximum speed on this test run was 394 km/h. Commercial operation of Wuhan-Guangzhou High-speed railway between Guangzhou North station and Wuhan station started on December 26, 2009, at a maximum speed of 350 km/h. The last section of the railway between Guangzhou North station and Guangzhou South station was opened on January 30, 2010. Japan Map of Shinkansen lines except Hakata-Minami Line and Gala-Yuzawa Line Japan might be considered the pioneer of modern high-speed railways. Pioneering modern high speed rail, it also has the most heavily travelled, and was the largest network (in km) in operation until China opened 6,000 km of high speed lines all at once in April 2007. Construction began in 1959, and in 1964, the world's first line, Tōkaidō Shinkansen opened to the public, then operating at a speed of 210 km/h. A maximum speed of 443 km/h was recorded in a test run in 1996. Japan is an extremely densely populated country; more than 70% of the land surface is mountainous and thus uninhabitable or unsuitable for road travel and parking. In fact, drivers must prove they have a parking space before they can buy a car. With such a population density, the only practical possibility for transport across the country is rail. The recognition of the interrelationship between land development and the high-speed rail network led, in 1970, to the enactment of a law for the construction of a nationwide Shinkansen railway network. By 1973, the Transport Minister approved construction plans for five additional lines and basic plans for twelve others. Despite the approval, financial considerations intervened; the cost of the five lines (five trillion yen, or roughly 18 billion U.S. dollars at the 1973 exchange rate), combined with the oil crisis and the recession of the 1970s and early 1980s resulted in some lines being cancelled and others delayed until 1982. The hosting of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano provided Japan with a valuable opportunity to showcase its technological skills with the opening of a new rail line extension, the Nagano Shinkansen from Tokyo to Nagano. The national rail system (JNR), which included Shinkansen was broken up and privatized beginning in 1987 with the aim of more efficient and profitable operations in the passenger rail sector. Incremental improvements to the high-speed rail technology are being undertaken, and the network continues to be expanded. Tilting trains have been introduced to take curves faster; meanwhile, aerodynamic redesigns, stronger engines and lighter materials, air brakes, typhoon and earthquake precautions, and track upgrades are among the developments. As a result of improvements, the travel time from Tokyo to Shin- Osaka (the first route opened) has decreased from 4 hours in 1964 to 2 hours 25 minutes in 2007. A Japanese consortium led by the Central Japan Railway Company have been researching new high-speed rail systems based on magnetic levitation since the 1970s. Although the trains and guideways are technologically ready and over 100,000 people have ridden them, high costs remains as barriers. Test trains SCMaglev MLX01 on the Yamanashi Test Line have reached speeds of 581 km/h (crewed), making them the fastest trains in the world. These new maglev trains are intended to be deployed on new Tokyo- Osaka Shinkansen maglev route, called the Chuo Shinkansen. On May 2011, JR Central announced the company will start operation of maglev route from 2027 between Tokyo-Nagoya followed by Nagoya-Osaka route by 2045. Projected travel time for Tokyo-Nagoya (286 km) is 40 minutes. South Korea KTX network map in January 2018 South Korean KTX high-speed rail, which runs on a dedicated line, became operational in April 2004, and was the third nation outside Western Europe to have high speed intercity service, after Japan and the US. The maximum speed of the KTX, which derives its technology directly from France's Alstom TGV, is 300 km/h. A journey from Seoul to Daejeon that previously took around 90 to 120 minutes now takes only 49, and the time from Daejeon to Daegu (Dongdaegu St.) has been similarly reduced. Passengers can save up to 2 hours on journeys from Seoul to Busan. Since service began, there have been many complaints about the trainsets, citing general discomfort, together with seating that faces opposite the direction of travel. However, rail demand rose 25% in the second three months of service (April–June 2004). Rail revenue in general increased more than 91% from the previous year with 33% more seats offered. Recent observations indicate a growth trend and increasing public acceptance of the service. Daily ridership is now in the range of 85,000 passengers. Diversions from other modes show wide variability, according to customer surveys. KTX enticed 56% from existing rail services, 17% from air, 15% from express buses, and 12% from highways. With the development of the HSR-350x, South Korean media argue that Korea came to be the fourth nation to develop high-speed rail independently, and the seventh nation to acquire the technology. However, the statistics should vary according to the multiple definitions of a high speed rail. The \\"High Speed Rail 350x\\" went under development by South Korean engineers several years before the French technology-transfer program. The train is a product of nearly 10 years of research and development by the Korean company Rotem and the National Rail Technology Institute of Korea. Called the \\"Korean G-7\\" (a direct reference to Korea's ambitions of joining the technological prowess of G-7 nations) this technology is currently in its test-run phase and is scheduled for initial passenger operation through the Seoul-to-Gwangju sector by 2007. The proposed train would run faster than the TGV, at 350 km/h as opposed to 300 km/h.Trains - cityglance.org The Korean G-7 incorporates several technologies the French TGV doesn't, including an aluminum body, digital traffic control, and a pressure compensation system. When operational the Korean G-7 will also allow passengers to rotate their seats, giving them the choice of a forward-facing or a rear-facing seat, in response to the many complaints about the fixed one-directional seating arrangements on the KTX. In July 2006, the South Korean government announced their plan to develop an upgraded version of the G-7 called HEMU(Highspeed Electric Multiple Unit-400㎞/h eXperiment) train system by 2011. Rotem, a member of the Hyundai group, also manufactures magnetic levitation trains. They were first introduced in the 1993 Daejon International Expo. Taiwan Taiwan High Speed Rail Network Taiwan High Speed Rail, also known as the THSR, is Taiwan's high-speed rail network, running approximately from Taipei to Kaohsiung, and began operations on January 5, 2007. Adopting Japan's Shinkansen technology for the core system, the THSR uses the Taiwan High Speed 700T train, manufactured by a consortium of Japanese companies, most notably Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The total cost of the project is currently estimated to be US$15 billion, and is one of the largest privately funded transport schemes to date. Express trains capable of travelling at up to Taiwan High Speed Rail Link - Mott MacDonald Project Page travel from Taipei City to Kaohsiung City in roughly 90 minutes as opposed to 4.5 hours by conventional rail, although local service THSR trains take approximately two hours when stopping at all stations en route. On June 3, 2007, THSR served 5 million cumulative passengers, and on September 26, 2007, the 10 millionth passenger boarded.Taipei Times - archives In the month of September 2007, THSRC carried 1.5 million passengers, growing further to 1.66 million in November and 2 million in December 2007,Taipei Times - archives the latter translating to about 65,000 passengers daily. In the first year of operation, ending December 31, 2007, THSRC's trains were 99.47% on-time, and carried 15.55 million passengers. Thirteen Taiwan High Speed Rail stations were planned in the western corridor, with eight stations already open in Taipei, Banciao, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan, and Zuoying. Five more stations (in Nangang, Miaoli, Changhua, Yunlin, and Kaohsiung) will be built in future years.

Plot Krazy Kat is pulling a box filled with apples, and is trying to sell them. Unfortunately, most people around are low in cash and are too depressed to eat anything because of bad economic times. Moments later, he finds a customer in a spiffy horse. The spiffy horse pays Krazy a check with a considerable amount. Delighted by this, Krazy tries to deposit it in the bank. After getting into a tussle with individuals trying to snatch it, Krazy finds himself chasing his check as it is getting blown away. After an airborne trip, the check finds its way back into the pockets of the spiffy horse. The spiffy horse then advises Krazy to be happy before putting a smiling mouth on the feline's frowning face. As a result, Krazy is happy and that he pretty much forgotten his problems. Krazy continues the spiffy horse's work in putting smiling mouths on others, thus inverting their moods. Over time, the public's depression is gone and somehow their financial problems also follow. Krazy, the spiffy horse, and a hare go on to parade across the country, promoting their encouragements to be happy. Eventually, Krazy is seen walking up the steps of some capitol where he is greeted by Uncle Sam.

This commenced in October 1941, though some goods had been moved prior to this under the \\"cash and carry\\" agreement. The route was affected by the start of hostilities between Japan and the US in December 1941, but was not interrupted as Japan and the Soviet Union maintained a strict neutrality towards each other for the duration of the conflict, changing only in August 1945. Due to this neutrality the goods could be moved only in Soviet-flagged ships, and, as they were inspected by the Japanese, could not include war materials. The route was therefore used to transport foods, raw materials and non-military goods such as lorries and other road vehicles, railway locomotives and rolling stock. It was also the most practical route for goods and materials produced in the US western states. During the conflict the Pacific Route saw a steady stream of goods moved from the west coast of the United States and overall accounted for some 50% of all Lend-lease goods to the Soviet Union.Ruge p.272 The route closed in September 1945 with the end of the conflict and the cessation of the Lend-Lease scheme. Ships Pacific Route cargo to Vladivostok was transported exclusively aboard independently routed Soviet ships. Twenty-seven United States cargo ships built about 1919 were transferred to the Soviet Far Eastern State Shipping Company (FESCO) as Lend- Lease in 1942. Older Soviet ships excluded from the JW convoys of faster Liberty ships to minimize travel time through the dangerous Barents Sea were suitable for the Pacific route, and were later augmented by Liberty ships supplied to the Soviet Union. Routing The operations of the Pacific Route were organized by Leonid Belakhov, Deputy Commissar and Chief Political Officer of the Soviet Merchant Fleet (MorFlot). Goods were moved from US west coast ports (principally Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Columbia River ports) and moved via the Great circle route across the Pacific, skirting the Aleutians and the Kuriles. From there they passed via the Perouse strait to Vladivostok. When the Perouse strait was frozen, Soviet ships traveled south of Kyushu and entered the Sea of Japan through the Tsushima Strait to reach Vladivostok.Blair p.378 Cargoes including military goods avoided Japanese inspection during the summer months by partially unloading in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to reduce their draught to cross the shallow Amur River estuary and enter the Sea of Japan via the Strait of Tartary. The total distance was 6,000 miles and took 18–20 days From Vladivostok nearly 400,000 railway car loads of goods were transhipped via the Trans-Siberian Railway to the industrial heart of the Soviet Union, a further 5,000 miles. A branch of the Pacific Route began carrying goods through the Bering Strait to the Soviet Arctic coast in June, 1942. From July through September convoys of shallow draught ships and icebreakers assembled in Providence Bay, Siberia to sail north through the Bering Strait and west along the Northern Sea Route. Total westbound tonnage through the Bering Strait was 452,393 in comparison to 8,243,397 tons through Vladivostok.Vail Motter pp.481&482 Part of this northern tonnage was fuel for the Alaska-Siberia Air Route airfields described below. Provisions for the airfields were transferred to river vessels and barges on the estuaries of large Siberian rivers. Submarine danger Even though Japan had been at war with the USA since December 1941, it was anxious to preserve good relations with the USSR, and, despite German complaints, usually allowed Soviet ships to sail between the USA and Soviet Union's Pacific ports unmolested. This contrasts with Germany and Britain's behavior, whose navies would often destroy or capture neutrals' ships sailing to their respective adversaries. As a result, during most of the war the Pacific Route became the safest path between the USA and the USSR. Nonetheless, several Soviet ships were torpedoed by submarines in the western Pacific. Japanese submarine I-180 probably sank Pavlin Vinogradov in the Alaska Gulf on 22 April 1944; and the United States Navy sank six. sank Angarstroy in the East China Sea on 1 May 1942. sank Ilmen and Kola off Kyushu on 17 February 1943. Kola was the former United States flagged Pacific Northwest Orient Line Satartia transferred as Lend-Lease on 14 December 1942. Both ships were lighted, but Sawfish was unaware of the Soviet winter routing change. Sawfish was later able to identify five other ships as Soviet, and let them pass. In July launched torpedoes at a ship known to be \\"Russian\\" but alleged to have been improperly marked. The torpedoes missed.Blair p.671 Soviet Lend-Lease Liberty ship Odessa was torpedoed near Akhomten Bay on 4 October 1943. Odessa was repaired, but was sunk in the area three days later, and is thought to have launched the torpedo. On 3 March 1944 torpedoed a ship off Kamchatka \\"positively identified\\" as Florida Maru. The torpedoes sank Belorussia.Blair p.575 sank Ob in the Sea of Okhotsk on 6 July 1944. sank Transbalt near the Perouse strait on 13 June 1945 because the ship was unlighted and allegedly \\"not following a designated Russian route.\\"Blair p.839 The air route The Pacific Route was augmented by the Alaska-Siberia Air Route (ALSIB), which was used to fly combat aircraft and goods from North America to Siberia and beyond. This route was safe from Japanese interference, as it was undertaken by Soviet pilots based in western Alaska. ALSIB was used to deliver nearly 8,000 aircraft, air cargo, and passengers from 7 October 1942 to the end of hostilities. Warehousing Lend-Lease shipments were supported by holding and reconsignment points in Auburn, Washington and Lathrop, California where cargo that could not be promptly moved overseas was held until called to the ports. These facilities constructed with Lend-Lease funds contained single- story warehouses, long and wide, with platforms for loading and unloading railway tracks running the full length of each side and a platform for handling truck freight at one end. Nearby open storage areas were available for freight unloaded from railway cars with cranes. These 600-acre sites employed thousands of civilians and hundreds of Italian prisoners of war and included shops, roundhouses, a mess hall, fire station, dispensary, cafeteria, bachelor officers’ quarters and administration buildings. Fuels, explosives and refrigerated cargoes were handled elsewhere.

In 1995, The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) conducted the first survey to assess Internet usage among different demographic groups (what the study deemed the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have-nots\\" of American society). After U.S. President Bill Clinton adopted the phrase \\"the digital divide\\" in his 2000 State of the Union address, researchers began to track trends in ICT access and usage across these different groups. The effort by the United States' government to close the digital divide has included private and public sector participation, and has developed policies to address information infrastructure and digital literacy that promotes a digital society in the United States. Although the digital divide in America has decreased considerably, there are still certain groups of Americans with limited access, with correlations to race, income, geographic location, and age. Demographic breakdown Infographic from the White House on the digital divide in the US Gender By 2001, women had surpassed men as the majority of the online United States population. When controlling for income, levels of education, and employment, it turns out that women are clearly more enthusiastic ICT users than men. Free access to a pdf of the study. The 2009 Census data suggests that potential disparities in gendered connectivity have become nearly non-existent; 73% of female citizens three years and older compared to 74% of males could access the Internet from their home. Women in the United States are taking advantage of the freelance employment opportunities the Internet offers. For example, a report in 2018 stated that women make up the majority of online shop owners on Etsy, and the majority of hosts on Airbnb. Although more women in the United States use the Internet than men, there still remains significant gender gaps in content creation and website development. For example, a 2013 survey found that about 27% of Wikipedia editors from the U.S. were female.Hill, Benjamin Mako; Shaw, Aaron (2013-06-26). Sánchez, Angel (ed.). \\"The Wikipedia Gender Gap Revisited: Characterizing Survey Response Bias with Propensity Score Estimation\\". PLoS ONE. 8 (6): e65782. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0065782.

In 2009, a Wikimedia Foundation survey revealed that 6% of editors who made more than 500 edits were female, with the average male editor having twice as many edits.WP:Clubhouse? An Exploration of Wikipedia's Gender Imbalance (PDF) Archived from the original (PDF) on 18 April 2015 Age Older generations of Americans have consistently reported the lowest level of access to the Internet per age cohorts.Yi, Zhixian. 2008. \\"Internet Use Patterns in the United States.\\" Chinese Librarianship: an International Electronic Journal 25. In 2019, 59% of Americans age 65 and older had access to broadband at home compared to about 80% of other age groups (77% of Americans age 18-29, 77% of Americans age 30-49, and 79% of Americans age 50-64). Although older generations still hold the lowest amount of Internet usage age-wise, the United States has seen a dramatic increase in Internet users at the age of 65 and older over time. From 2000 to 2015, the number of senior citizens connected to the Internet increased by 44%. Device ownership has drastically increased for Americans age 65 and older over the years but still remains consistently lower than that of all American adults. Data from Pew Research Center shows that smartphone ownership increased from 11% in 2011 to 24% in 2016 (compared to the American average of 35% and 77%, respectively) and tablet ownership increased from 1% in 2010 to 32% in 2016 (compared to 3% and 51%, respectively). In terms of device usage, seniors tended to describe their smartphones as \\"freeing\\" and \\"connecting\\" and are more likely to use tablets and e-readers. Race and ethnicity Rising trends in connectivity of Whites, Hispanics, and African Americans Generally, racial minorities have demonstrated lower levels of access and knowledge ICTs and of owning infrastructure to utilize the connection. In 2000, 50% of Whites had access to the Internet compared to 43% of Hispanics and 34% of African Americans.Lenhart, Amanda, Lee Rainie, Mary Madden, Angie Boyce, John Horrigan, Katherine Allen, and Erin O'Grady. 2003. \\"The Ever-Shifting Internet Population: A new look at Internet access and the digital divide.\\" Pew Internet and American Life Project. Between 2000 and 2010, the racial population of Internet users became increasingly similar to the racial makeup of the United States population, demonstrating a closing racial divide. In 2019, 79% of Whites had access to broadband compared to 61% of Hispanics and 66% of African Americans. English-speaking Hispanics have been the fastest rising ethnic cohort in terms of Internet usage. In 2010, 81% of English- dominant Latinos, 74% bilingual Latinos, and 47% Spanish-dominant Latinos used the Internet. Even though the rate of dominant Spanish-speaking Latinos was lower at the time, it rose significantly from 36% in 2009.Livingston, Gretchen. 2010. \\"Latinos and Digital Technology, 2010.\\" Pew Hispanic Center African Americans are behind Whites in Internet access, but the gap is most evident within the senior population: in 2003, 11% of African Americans age 65 and older reported using the Internet, compared to 22% of senior Whites. Also in 2003, 68% of 18- to 24-year-old African Americans and 83% of 18- to 24-year-old Whites had Internet access. A similar gap is noted in the 55- to 64-year-old range with 58% of Whites and 22% of African Americans accessing the Internet. In 2019, there was virtually no digital divide in ownership to smartphones by race/ethnicity: 82% of Whites, 79% of Hispanics, and 80% of Blacks had access to smartphones. States and Regions Internet connectivity varies widely state by state in the U.S. both in terms of broadband coverage and Internet speed. For example, in 2019, New Jersey ranked the highest in Internet connectivity with the fastest average Internet speed (52.0 mbps) and highest percentage of broadband coverage (99%), and Montana ranked the lowest with the slowest average Internet speed (20.3 mbps) and lowest percentage of broadband coverage (69%). Internet connectivity also varies by region. In 2016, U.S. Census data showed that nonmetropolitan areas in the South have the lowest percentages of households with computers or Internet connection and Metropolitan areas in the West have the highest percentages. \\"Computer and Internet Use in the United States: 2016\\" (PDF). U.S. Census Bureau. Aug 2018. Retrieved Feb 28 2020. Southern states tend to have higher poverty levels that correlate with low levels of Internet connectivity. For example, in 2016, Arkansas and Mississippi reported the lowest levels of broadband use (71% of households) and both states have low median incomes compared to the rest of the country. Income In 2016, roughly half of all households with an income less than $25,000 owned a desktop or laptop computer. Over 90% of all households with an income over $100,000 owned a desktop or laptop computer. The same relationship can be seen for households owning smartphones, tablets, and Internet/broadband subscriptions. In 2019, Pew Research Center came out with a report that stated while Internet usage has increased in lower-income households (with annual incomes of less than $30,000), these households are more likely to be smartphone-only Internet users. This can leave them at a disadvantage when applying for jobs or doing other tasks traditionally formatted for a larger screen. As for its effects on school-age children, in 2015, over a quarter of lower-income students did not have access to broadband Internet at home, leaving them to rely on either smartphones or public library access to complete online homework. In a 2020 report by Common Sense Media, it was reported that 30% of American children in grades K-12 lacked access to broadband Internet and several key types of devices (computers, laptops, tablets), and this was exacerbated for children from lower-income homes. This lack of access can leave them at a disadvantage for accessing educational resources, particularly when distance and remote learning has become popular due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A reverse divide is also apparent in the choices that parents make for their children and teenagers. Kids in poor families spend more time using digital devices for entertainment and less time interacting with people face-to-face compared to children and teenagers in well-off families. Wealthy families choose child care options and schools that limit or ban screen time. This has led to concerns that wealthy families are buying face-to-face human interaction for their children, with all the benefits that brings to them, while other children will be left with the poor substitute of an artificial game. Educational attainment In 2018, data showed that households where the house owner has a bachelor's degree or higher, desktop/laptop computer ownership exceeds 93%. However, in households where the house owner did not graduate high school, that figure sharply drops to 45%. The reverse divide is related to education. According to a New York Times article in 2018, the more educated parents are, and especially the more parents know about how computers work, the more likely they are to ban or sharply limit the use of computers, tablets, smartphones, and other digital devices for their children. Reasons given for trends and gaps Schematic visualization of Pipeline Model described by Shaw & Hargittai Shaw and Hargittai (2018) explain that inequities in participatory activity on the Internet (such as on Wikipedia) can be represented as a pipeline model. The steps in their model include: (1) being aware of the site, (2) visiting the site, (3) understanding that it is possible to edit, contribute, or participate on the site, and (4) actually contributing on the site. Thus, gaps in digital knowledge and skills produce gaps in online participatory activity. In 2018, Jen Schradie examined how different factors drive the digital divide in online participation or digital engagement between lower and higher socio- economic groups. Schradie, Jen. \\"The Digital Production Gap: The Digital Divide and Web 2.0 Collide.\\" Poetics, Vol. 39, No. 2. April 2011, p. 145-168 (PDF) She discusses what she calls ASET resources: access, skills, empowerment, and tools. She asserts that lower-class individuals and organizations have less ASETs, and because of this, have less resources to participate online (such as building a robust online presence or navigating an online space). For example, her research describes that having consistent internet access was a challenge for people who can barely make ends meet. The lack of resources creates feelings of disempowerment. Schradie explains that middle to upper-class individuals not only tended to have more ASETs, but often feel more entitlement and confident in their ability to use digital media. Data suggest that race, income, and education are intertwined, especially when it comes to the digital divide. Using the ASETs model above, those who are White, higher-income, and more highly-educated typically have more ASETs. As a result, these groups tend to have higher digital connectivity. Other research suggests that a part of the digital divide has been driven by language differences, with those with lower English ability have traditionally had less Internet connectivity and usage. Means of connectivity Infrastructure The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) distinguishes between broadband or high-speed Internet access and dial- up Internet access. Broadband access includes using DSL, cable modems, fiber, wireless, satellite, or BPL. As of 2019, approximately 27% of U.S. adults did not have access to broadband Internet at home. Additionally, people use different physical mediums that can connect to the Internet such as desktop computers, laptops, cell phones, iPods or other MP3 players, Xboxes or PlayStations, electronic book readers, and tablets such as iPads. Since 2013, Pew Research Center has been tracking the percentage of the American population who they call \\"smartphone-only Internet users\\" who do not have home broadband but own a smartphone. This percentage has grown from 8% in 2013 to 18% in 2019. Smartphone-only Internet users are more likely to be adults who are younger (22% of Americans ages 18-29), Hispanic (25%) and Black (23%), from households with annual incomes of less than $30,000 (26%), and with less than a high school degree (32%). According to a 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center in 2019, smartphone ownership in the United States varies greatly among generations: * Millennials (born in 1981-1996): 93% * Generation X (born 1965-1980): 90% * Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964): 68% * Silent Generation (born 1945 and earlier): 40% Location If Internet is inaccessible from the home, one can often find Wi-Fi connections at restaurants and coffee shops, schools, and libraries. A survey by Pew Research in 2016 found that 23% of Americans 16-years-old and older used wi-fi at a public library. According to the American Library Association (ALA), 98% of public libraries in the United States in 2015 offered free wi-fi. In a 2011 ALA survey, it was shown that the quality of that Internet access can vary, with connections to the community's poverty level and community type.\\"2010-2011 Public Library Funding and Technology Access Survey: Survey Findings and Results\\" (PDF). American Library Association. June 21, 2011. Retrieved Feb 23, 2020. Rural libraries were much less likely to report having fiber optic Internet connections, while a majority of urban libraries reported having it. Rural libraries were also less likely to have connectivity speeds higher than 6.0 mbps. In 2010, nine out of every ten libraries surveyed by the ALA reported that providing services to job seekers was one of the most important services free Internet services provided. Other important services included providing government information such as tax forms, and educational information to school-aged children. Over the past few years, some public libraries in the United States have started to lend out hotspots to patrons. Purpose of connectivity Internet activities ever performed by percentage. Activities the Internet is utilized for on a daily basis as percentages. As new applications and software are developed, the Internet has increasingly become utilized to complete a variety of both professional work and personal tasks. To the right of this section are two tables describing the most recent data on the types of activities U.S. citizens utilize the Internet for compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau and presented in its final Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012. 41% of Blacks and 47% of English-speaking Hispanics send and receive email on cell phones, as compared to 30% of Whites. Significant differences between the racial groups include sending and receiving instant messages, using social networking sites, watching videos, and posting photos or videos online.Smith, Aaron. 2010. \\"Mobile Access 2010.\\" Pew Internet & American Life Project. A 2013 study found that \\"African Americans are more likely than other segments of the population to use the Internet to seek and apply for employment, and are more likely to consider the Internet very important to the success of their job search.\\" Lack of connectivity Physical, financial, psychological, and skill-based barriers exist in terms of Internet access and Internet skills for different demographics: 25% of American adults live with a disability that interferes with daily living activities. 54% of adults living with a disability still connect to the Internet. 2% of adults say they have a disability or illness that makes it more difficult or impossible for them to effectively and efficiently use the Internet. Aversion to the Internet influences an individual's psychological barriers to Internet usage, affecting which involving which individuals connect and for what purpose. Comfort displayed toward technology can be described as comfort performing a task concerning the medium and infrastructure by which to connect. Technological infrastructure sometimes causes privacy and security concerns leading to a lack of connectivity.Rhodes, Lois. \\" Barriers to Access.\\" Evaluating Community Technology Centers. May 2002. Individuals who exhibit computer anxiety demonstrate fear towards the initial experience of computer usage or the process of using a computer. From this, many researchers conclude that increased computer experience could lead to lower anxiety levels. Others suggest that individuals demonstrate anxiety toward specific computer tasks, such as using the Internet, rather than anxiety toward computers in general.Rockwell, Steven C., Loy Singleton. 2002. \\"The Effects of Computer Anxiety and Communication Apprehension on the Adoption and Utilization of the Internet.\\" The Electronic Journal of Communication 12, no. 1 & 2. Communication apprehension influences propensity to use only Internet applications that promote engagement in communication with other people such as Skype or iChat. Overcoming the digital divide in the United States Information infrastructure Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on February 13, 2009 which was signed it into law four days later by President Barack Obama. A portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act designated approximately $7.2 billion in investments to expand broadband access nationwide, improve high-speed connectivity in rural areas and public computer centers, and increase Internet capacity in schools, libraries, public safety offices, and other public buildings.The White House. Issues: Technology - Broadband.Executive Office of the President of the United States - National Economic Council. \\"Recovery Act Investments in Broadband: Leveraging Federal Dollars to Create Jobs and Connect America\\". December 2009. (PDF) According to a joint report from The Alliance for the Public Technology and the Communications Workers of America released in July 2008, states developed initiatives before there had been any national-wide action aimed to actively develop an information infrastructure and start to catch up to other countries in respect to the number of households with broadband internet. Broadband initiatives by the states can be broadly classified into seven different types: * \\"Broadband Commissions, Task Force, or Authority established through legislation or executive order that directs public and private stakeholders to assess the state of high-speed Internet deployment and adoption in the state and recommend policy solutions. * Public-Private Partnerships convened through executive order or statute to broadband availability, identify unserved and underserved areas, assess supply and demand-side barriers, create local technology teams to implement programs to increase computer ownership, digital literacy, aggregate demand, and accelerate broadband build-out. * Direct Funding Programs to support the build-out of advanced networks in unserved and underserved areas by leveraging private sector funds to make network investment – and thus Internet service – more affordable * State Networks operated by public agencies or the private sector connecting schools, universities, libraries and state and local government agencies to reduce costs by aggregating demand. In some cases, public agencies serve as anchor tenants to make middle-mile broadband build- out to underserved communities more economic. At least 30 states have established state networks * Telehealth networks linking rural clinics with specialists in hospitals and academic institutions. At least 25 states support state telehealth networks. * Tax Policy with targeted tax incentives for investment in broadband equipment. * Demand-Side Programs to promote computer ownership, digital literacy, and development of community-based applications and services.\\"  Notable Initiatives  In 1993, the U.S. Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure was established and administered a report called A Nation of Opportunity that planned access to ICTs for all member of the population and emphasized the government's role in protecting their existence.United States Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure. 1996. A nation of opportunity: Realizing the promise of the information superhighway. Washington, DC. Founded in 1996, the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation attempts to enhance children's and their parents' computer knowledge, program application usage, and ability to easily navigate the Internet. In 2010, the City of Boston received a 4.3 million dollar grant from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The grant will attempt to provide Internet access and training to underserved populations including parents, children, youth, and the elderly. Starting in 1997, Cisco Systems Inc. began Cisco Networking Academy which donated equipment and provided training programs to high schools and community centers that fell in U.S. Empowerment Zones. Since 1999, a non-profit organization called Computers for Youth has provided cheaper Internet access, computers, and training to minority homes and schools in New York City. Currently, the agency serves more than 1,200 families and teachers per year. The Tomorrow's Teachers to Use Technology established by the Department of Education was given almost $400 million between 1999 and 2003 to train teachers in elementary and secondary schools to use ICTs in the classroom. In 2000, Berkeley, California established a program that facilitated digital democracy in allowing residents to contribute opinions to general city plans via the Internet. The National Science Foundation gave EDUCAUSE (a non-profit that attempts to enhance education with ICTs) $6 million to focus on providing ICTs to Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Tribal Colleges and Universities. In 2000, President Clinton allocated $2.34 billion to provide low-income families at-home access to computers and the Internet, to install broadband networks in underserved communities, and to encourage private donation of computers, businesses or individuals to sponsor community technology centers, and technology training. An additional $45 million was added to emphasize provision of ICTs to underserved areas. In 2003, the Gates Foundation contributed $250 million to install more than 47,000 computers and train librarians in almost 11,000 libraries in all 50 states. In 2004 in Houston, Texas, a non-profit organization called Technology for All (TFA) established a free broadband Wi-Fi network in an underserved community, Pecan Park. An additional grant in 2010 assisted TFA, in collaboration with Rice University, in upgrading their Wi-Fi network to a new long-range version, a \\"Super Wi-Fi\\" in order to enhance network speed and computer quality. In June 2004, Hon. Gale Brewer (D-Manhattan), Chair of the Select Committee on Technology in Government (now the Committee on Technology) in conjunction with a graduate student Digital Opportunities Team at CUNY Hunter College, supervised by Professor Lisa Tolliver in the Departments of Urban Affairs and Planning), published a study and recommendations titled Expanding Digital Opportunity in New York City Public Schools: Profiles of Innovators and Leaders Who Make a Difference. The report was one of numerous initiatives and events implemented by the Select Committee, which includes roundtables, conferences, hearings, and collaborative partnerships. In 2007, projects called One Laptop per Child, Raspberry Pi and 50x15 were implemented in attempting to reduce the digital divide by providing cheaper infrastructure necessary to connect. In 2007, the use of \\"hotspot\\" zones (where people can access free Wi-Fi) was introduced to help bridge access to the Internet. Due to a majority percentage of American adults (55) connecting wirelessly, this policy can assist in providing more comprehensive network coverage, but also ignores an underprivileged population of people who do not own infrastructure, so still lack access to the Internet and ICTs. The Broadband Access ($76 billion) and Community Connect ($57.7 million in grants) programs administered by the US Department of Agriculture (2007) and the e-Rate program administered by the Federal Communications Commission are the pillars of national policies intended to promote the diffusion of broadband Internet service in rural America. Since 2008, organizations such as Geekcorps and Inveneo have been working to reduce the digital divide by emphasizing ICTs within a classroom context. Technology used often includes laptops, handhelds (e.g. Simputer, E-slate), and tablet PCs. In 2011, Congresswoman Doris Matsui introduced the Broadband Affordability Act, which calls for the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to subsidize broadband Internet service for low-income citizens, assisting in closing the gap between high-income and low-income households. The Act would expand the program to offer discounted internet service to lower-income consumers living in both urban and rural areas. The bill was introduced on June 14, 2011, but was not enacted and died in the 112th Congress. In 2014, Congressmen Bill Foster introduced the ‘‘Closing the Digital 5 Divide for Students Act of 2014’’, which amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 and is aimed at providing affordable internet for residents in low-income housing. It was last referred to the House Committee on Financial Services in 2015. Implications Social capital The majority of research on civic engagement and social capital shows that the Internet enhances social capital in the United States, but others report that after controlling for background variables, civic engagement between users and non-users is not significantly different.Putnam RD. 2000. Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community. New York: Simon & Schuster Of those who do believe that the Internet promotes social capital, a longitudinal study in Pittsburgh found that Internet usage increased rates of individual participation in community activities as well as levels of trust. Additionally, these increased levels of involvement were greater for participants who had previously been the least involved.Kraut R., M. Patterson, V. Lundmark, S. Kiesler, T. Mukophadhyay, and W. Scherlis. 1998. \\"Internet paradox: A social technology that reduces social involvement and psychological well-being? American Psychology 53:1011–1031. Of those who use the Internet in the United States, studies have found that these individuals tend to be members of community social networks, participate in community activities, and exhibit higher levels of political participation.Gibson RK, PEN Howard, S. Ward. 2000. \\"Social capital, Internet connectedness, and political participation: A four-country study. Pappres. 2000 International Political Science Association Meeting Quebec, Canada. Economic gains The United States is the world leader in Internet supply ecosystem, holding over 30% of global Internet revenues and more than 40% of global Internet net income. Its lead primarily stems from the economic importance of and dependence the United States places on the Internet, since the Internet makes the United States' economic activity faster, cheaper, and more efficient. The Internet provides a large contribution to wealth: 61% of businesses who use the Internet in the United States saved $155.2 billion as a result of ICTs as more efficient means toward productivity. In 2009, the Internet generated $64 billion in consumer surplus in the United States. In the United States, the Internet promotes private consumption primarily through online shopping. In 2009, online purchases of goods and services totaled about $250 billion, with average consumption per buyer equaling about $1,773 over the year. That same year, the Internet contributed to 60% of the United States' private consumption, 24% of private investment, 20% of public expenditure, and 3.8% of the GDP. Between 1995 and 2009, the Internet has contributed to 8% of the GDP's growth in the United States. Most recently, the Internet has contributed to 15% of the GDP's growth from 2004–2009. The American government can also communicate more quickly and easily with citizens who are Internet consumers: e-government supports interactions with American individuals and businesses. Additionally, widespread use of the Internet by businesses and corporations drives down energy costs. Besides the fact that Internet usage does not consume large amounts of energy, businesses who utilize connections no longer have to ship, stock, heat, cool, and light unsellable items whose lack of consumption not only yields less profit for the company but also wastes more energy. Online shopping contributes to less fuel use: a 10-pound package via airmail uses 40% less fuel than a trip to buy that same package at a local mall, or shipping via railroad. Researchers in 2000 predicted a continuing decline in energy due to Internet consumption to save 2.7 million tons of paper per year, yielding a decrease by 10 million tons of carbon dioxide global warming pollution per year.

Meu Mundo Ficaria Completo (In English: \\"With You... My World Would Be Complete\\") is a studio album by Brazilian singer Cássia Eller, released in 1999. The idea of recording a more \\"relaxed\\" album came after Eller listened to her son saying that she wouldn't sing, but yell (thanks to her rock 'n' roll style of interpretation). At first, the album would feature only songs by producer Nando Reis, but he suggested she used songs of her own, given that her previous album (Veneno AntiMonotonia) was already a compilation of songs written by someone else (Cazuza). It was during the sessions for this album and for Reis's solo album Para Quando o Arco-Íris Encontrar o Pote de Ouro that songs such as \\"O Segundo Sol\\" and \\"All Star\\" emerged. According to Reis, however, the first day of sessions was \\"a disaster\\" and Eller left the studio \\"infuriated\\". On the following day the producer even proposed that he resigned from his position, but Eller asked him to stay and they resumed work on the album. In order to record \\"O Segundo Sol\\" (\\"The Second Sun\\"), they contemplated inviting Neil Young's supporting band Crazy Horse. Songwriter Reis says he's known of many theories of what the \\"second sun\\" could be; according to him, the track originated in a conversation he had with a friend who told him in a confident manner that, according to her beliefs, a second sun would eventually rise, to which he jokingly replied asking how didn't NASA know about that. Later, he regretted his behavior and wrote the song thinking of the importance of respecting different beliefs. Eller's mother, Nanci Ribeiro, sings with her on \\"Pedra Gigante\\". Ribeiro was a singer before marrying Eller's father and taught her daughter how to sing. Reis once said the third strophe of \\"O Meu Mundo Ficaria Completo (com Você)\\" is about Eller.  Reception  Alvaro Neder called this her best album to date, and it was nominated for several Latin Grammys. The album went gold.

WBAN supports a variety of real-time health monitoring and consumer electronics applications. The latest international standard for WBAN is the IEEE 802.15.6 standard which aims to provide an international standard for low power, short range, and extremely reliable wireless communication within the surrounding area of the human body, supporting a vast range of data rates for different applications. Short-range, wireless communications in the vicinity of, or inside, a human body (but not limited to humans) are specified in this standard. It uses existing industrial scientific medical (ISM) bands as well as frequency bands approved by national medical and/or regulatory authorities. Support for quality of service (QoS), extremely low power, and data rates up to 10 Mbps is required while simultaneously complying with strict non-interference guidelines where needed. This standard considers effects on portable antennas due to the presence of a person (varying with male, female, skinny, heavy, etc.), radiation pattern shaping to minimize the specific absorption rate (SAR) into the body, and changes in characteristics as a result of the user motions.IEEE P802.15.6-2012 Standard for Wireless Body Area Networks Security The IEEE 802.15.6 standard aims to provide the confidentiality, authentication, integrity, privacy protection, and replay defense. All nodes and hubs must choose three security levels: unsecured communication (level 0), authentication but no encryption (level 1), and authentication and encryption (level 2). During the security association process, a node and a hub need to jointly select a suitable security level. In unicast communication, a pre-shared or a new MK is activated. A Pairwise Temporal Key (PTK) is then generated that is used only once per session. In multicast communication, a Group Temporal Key (GTK) is generated that is shared with the corresponding group. All nodes and hubs in a WBAN have to go through certain stages at the MAC layer before data exchange. A security association is a procedure to identify a node and a hub to each other, to establish a new Master Key (MK) shared between them, or to activate an existing MK pre-shared between them. The security association in the IEEE 802.15.6 standard is based on four key agreement protocols that have security problems. There are some interesting proposals in the published academic literature which resolve the security and privacy problems of the current security association procedures of IEEE 802.15.6 in a suitable manner, however, the fact that such proposals have yet not being included with in the standard by IEEE is incomprehensible.

Early years Kjell Nupen had his professional breakthrough very early. At just 17 years old, he was admitted to Statens Kunstakademi. Since he was believed to be 18, his admission caused some difficulties but he finally could start after being given an exemption. He experienced success early on, and at the age of just 19, his art was bought by Riksgalleriet, Nasjonalgalleriet and Norsk Kulturråd. His younger artistic years were coloured by radical political expressions influenced by the turbulent political times that existed in Europe. During his time in Düsseldorf he embraced the idea, so present at the academy, that art should mean something. (Paintings from this time: Situation (Ulrike M), from 1976 and Fargelagt idyll from 1979) This has resulted in a few symbols he has immersed himself in over the years, such as: The boat (endless journey), Car wrecks (Nature morte), Eagle in flight, Tree trunks (Homestead), Lighthouse (Sentimental journey), and the Munch moon (Homage to Edvard Munch). Later years and death During the 1980s the people disappeared from his pictures and were replaced by motifs from nature. His later paintings are focused on themes such as quietness and belonging to or lack thereof. His references to Edvard Munch, Matisse, and Eadweard Muybridge can be seen in many of his paintings (Homage to E.M., Interiør, eksteriør and Flygende over vann) He became especially known for the colour Nupen blue. He died on March 12, 2014, from cancer at the age of 58. Besides being a figurative painter he was a respected graphic artist. Most of his paper art is within etching, lithography and wood-block print. In this field he has worked as mentor for several other artists. His art can be found in museums and major art collections both in and outside Norway. Major works in public Fountain in Otterdalsparken, Kristiansand Though Kjell Nupen did see himself as a painter first and foremost, he worked with many different mediums such as granite, ceramic, glass, steel and bronze. Besides having many exhibitions in and outside Norway, he has done several major projects in the public, such as: Otterdalsparken in Kristiansand (also called Nupenparken), Silkeborg Danmark, Statoil Stavanger, Søm Church in Kristiansand, Ansgarkapellet in Kristiansand, Geilo Kulturkirke in Geilo, Olsvik Church in Bergen, Telemark sykehus in Porsgrunn, the city hall of Viborg in Denmark, Helsfyr Atrium in Oslo, Husnes torv in Husnes, Forum Jæren in Bryne and Broerenkerk, a church from 1504 in Zwolle in the Netherlands - now unconsecrated and changed into a major book and culture centre.

He studied art and literature during his education in Breslau and Berlin before distinguishing himself during a cholera epidemic in which he tended to the ill. Bojanowski founded several orphanages and libraries for the poor and even worked in them to provide for those people. But his main desire was to enter the priesthood: ill health blocked this once and his own death prevented his second attempt after his deteriorating health forced him to stop his ecclesial studies. His beatification cause opened decades after his death and culminated on 13 June 1999 after Pope John Paul II beatified him in Warsaw on the occasion of his apostolic visit to the nation. Life Bojanowski's signature. Edmund Bojanowski was born in Poland on 14 November 1814 to the nobles (szlachta) Walentego Bojanowski and Teresa Umińska. Both his parents were devout in their faith which proved a critical influence on his deep religious convictions formed from childhood. In 1819 he became ill and appeared to die but seemed to return to life a short while later despite doctors declaring that there were slim chances the child would recover. His parents considered this a form of miraculous healing based on their constant petitions for intercession from above. It was upon his recuperation that the child vowed to dedicate his life to the Blessed Mother. Bojanowski continued to suffer ill health throughout his lifetime and it was due to this that he could not attend school and had to be tutored at home. In 1835 he developed tuberculosis during the course of his education. He later continued his studies at the Breslau college (1832-35; where he studied art and literature) and also at the college in Berlin (1836-38; studied art and music but did not complete his philosophical studies). But Bojanowski was far too frail at this time to join the priesthood; this was a vocation that he would attempt again later in life. Bojanowski also translated works from Serbian to Polish during this time. The current period proved one of cultural change and exploration to which he himself contributed through the publication of a historical account of Serbia as well as a contribution of his own poems. He was known to spend hours in Eucharistic adoration and often meditated on Sacred Scripture. He made his Confession once a week and made annual retreats in order to undergo the Spiritual Exercises. His interest in people led him to collect stories as well as songs and proverbs from the rural areas and publish them in \\"The Friend of the People\\". Bojanowski also became involved in providing books for schools as well as establishing new libraries and creating orphanages for poor children. During the cholera epidemic during the period 1848-49 he tended to the sick while helping to medicate and comfort them. Due to the rampant sickness he saw around him he helped organize a new hospital (Dom Miłosierdzia). He helped to fund hospices and orphanages. He deemed service to the poor as an important task and due to this was able to found a religious order of nuns known as called the Congregation of the Sisters Servants of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mother of God. This later led to the creation of separate religious orders in Poznań as well as other cities such as Wrocław. In 1867 he authorized the founding of the Congregation of the Poor Servants of the Mother of God which Mother Magdalen of the Sacred Heart led in England. Bojanowski later decided to attempt an education for the priesthood once more in 1869 in Gniezno; but his health continued to deteriorate to the point where he later died 7 August 1871 in Górka Duchowna without becoming ordained as a priest as he had wished for. Religious orders Bojanowski either founded or co-founded four separate religious congregations: * Sisters Servants of Mary Immaculate * Sisters Servants of the Holy and Immaculate Virgin Mary * Little Servant Sisters of the Immaculate Conception * Sisters Servants of the Mother of God Beatification Monument in Luboń-Żabikowo. Stained glass window in the Saint Adalbert church in Poznań. The beatification process opened in Poznań some decades after his death and was closed at a solemn Mass that Archbishop Antoni Baraniak led on 24 October 1960. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints granted their validation to this diocesan investigation on 8 March 1991 prior to receiving the Positio dossier for additional assessment later in 1996. Historians advising the C.C.S. confirmed their approval to the cause on 22 October 1996 as did the congress of theologians on 16 December 1997. The C.C.S. members also voiced their approval some months later on 21 April 1998. Pope John Paul II declared Bojanowski as Venerable on 3 July 1998 after confirming his heroic virtue. Bojanowski was beatified following papal recognition of a miracle (a healing) attributed to his intercession. The investigation into the alleged miracle took place in the diocese of its origin prior to that investigation receiving the needed validation from the C.C.S. on 15 October 1993. Medical experts confirmed the miraculous nature of the healing on 4 June 1998 as did theologians months later on 9 October and the C.C.S. members later that 15 December. John Paul II granted final approval for the miracle less than a week later on 21 December. John Paul II beatified Bojanowski in Warsaw on 13 June 1999 during his apostolic visit to Poland. The pope - during the beatification itself - referred to Bojanowski as a \\"good man with a big heart\\" who became an \\"exceptional example of generous and industrious work for man\\".

Due to the amount of money changing hands depending on rank, and prize money, there had been reports of (corruption, bout-fixing) in professional sumo for years before it was finally definitively proven to exist in 2011. The hierarchical structure of the sport, in which a minority of top-ranked wrestlers have great advantages in salary, privileges and status over the lower-ranked wrestlers that make up the majority of sumo participants, may have contributed to the use of match-fixing in order to prolong careers for top-ranked wrestlers and assist in the distribution of promotions.Hongo, Jun, \\"Sumo-rigging born of necessity?\\", Japan Times, February 9, 2011, p. 3.Kyodo News, \\"Ex-sumo attendant says match-fixing nothing new\\", Japan Times, February 10, 2011, p. 1. Previous speculation In 2002, Steven Levitt and Mark Duggan published a paper using econometrics in order to suggest that corruption in sumo exists. Popularized in Levitt's book Freakonomics, the study found that 70% of wrestlers with 7–7 records on the final day of the tournament (i.e., seven wins and seven losses, and one fight to go) won. The percentage was found to rise the more times the two wrestlers had met, and decrease when the wrestler was due to retire. The study found that the 7–7 wrestlers won around 80% of the time when statistics suggest they had a probability of winning only 48.7% of the time against their opponents. Like Benjamin, the authors concluded that those who already have 8 wins collude with those who are 7–7 and let them win, since the 8-win wrestlers had already secured their ranking. A possible counter-argument to the Freakonomics conclusion is that a 7–7 rikishi was highly motivated to win his last match to gain promotion, rather than demotion, while the 8–6 rikishi had already guaranteed his promotion, so was not as motivated. The authors revealed a more damning statistic, however. According to their research, the next tournament in which the two wrestlers met, there was a significant advantage to the 8–6 wrestler over the 7–7, regardless of the performance of either wrestler. The previously 7–7 wrestler would win only 40% percent of the rematches with the 8–6 wrestler. The authors suggested that winning 80% in the first match and then only 40% in the rematch (and back to the expected 50% in subsequent matches) between the same wrestlers suggested a rigging of the bouts. Additionally, the authors found that after allegations of rigging by the media, 7–7 wrestlers won only 50% of their matches against 8–6 wrestlers instead of 80%. Previous allegations When the former sumo wrestler Kōnoshin Suga, also known as Onaruto stablemaster, and his supporter Seiichiro Hashimoto came forward with allegations of match rigging, drug use, sexcapades, tax evasion, and close ties to the mafia, both were found dead in the same hospital, hours apart on April 14, 1996, though there was no proof of poisoning.Johnson, David T., \\"Sumo will change or die\\", Japan Times, February 17, 2011, p. 13.

In 2000, in both speeches and a tell-all book, former wrestler Keisuke Itai stated that up to 80% of sumo bouts were fixed. In 2007, Shūkan Gendai reported that yokozuna Asashōryū had been paying wrestlers to throw matches to him. A court later ordered Kodansha, the journal's publisher, to pay ¥44 million to the Japan Sumo Association over the allegations. In September 2008 Wakanohō, a wrestler who had been expelled for cannabis use, claimed he was forced to accept bribes to forfeit sumo matches. He implicated ōzeki Kotoōshū, then jūryō wrestler Kasuganishiki and later ōzeki Kaiō and Chiyotaikai. He would later retract these claims, but then changed his position in 2011 yet again, when definitive allegations of match- fixing came to light. 2011 investigation In February 2011, Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and National Police Agency announced that an investigation into allegations of baseball gambling by sumo wrestlers and officials had discovered cell phone text messages indicating that some matches had been fixed.Buerk, Roland, \\"Japan's sumo hit by match-fixing claims\\", BBC News, 2 February 2010. Retrieved February 4, 2010. Allegedly, 14 wrestlers or stablemasters were involved.

As a result of the independent investigation, the board of directors of the Japan Sumo Association (JSA) decided in an extraordinary meeting to cancel the March 2011 tournament in Osaka. The last time a Grand Tournament had been canceled was in 1946, when repairs to the old Ryōgoku Kokugikan, which had been extensively damaged in World War II, were not completed in time. Also, a regional exhibition tournament in Akita Prefecture on August 8, 2011 was cancelled. In the end, 23 wrestlers in total were judged guilty of match- fixing and all were expelled. The JSA's investigative panel stated in May 2011 that match-fixing appears to have been widespread. The panel stated that it would be difficult to discover, however, the full extent of the problem.Kyodo News, \\"Sumo panel concedes match-fixing deep-rooted\\", Japan Times, May 20, 2011, p. 2. Uncovering the problem is made even more difficult by the presence of a separate form of collusion (koi ni yatta mukiryoku-zumo) which refers to a wrestler going lightly on an opponent without the exchange of money. In sumo culture especially, individual gain must be subordinated to the rights of the group, meaning that certain wrestlers have appeared duty-bound by their organization's style to help popular or senior wrestlers in need. The wrestlers not listed above who admitted to match-fixing and accepted expulsion are as follows: Asōfuji, Hakuba, Hoshihikari, Kasugaō, Kiyoseumi, Kirinowaka, Kōryū, Kotokasuga, Kyokunankai, Masatsukasa, Mōkonami, Sakaizawa, Shimotori, Shirononami, Tokusegawa, Toyozakura, Wakatenro, and Yamamotoyama. Two more wrestlers, Sōkokurai and Hoshikaze never admitted any involvement and were forcibly expelled several days later. Sōkokurai was later exonerated and reinstated. See below for more information. Policies to combat match- fixing Soon after the match-fixing scandal, in March 2011, an 8-member committee commissioned by the JSA put forth six recommendations, later expanded to eight, for preventing future match-fixing: # Strengthening the investigative panel. # A system of regulations for conduct in dressing rooms (where much of the match-fixing collusion was alleged to have taken place) as well as strengthening of existing regulations. # Establishing a hotline for anonymous reporting of match-fixing. # Adopting expanded regulations for disciplining of wrestlers for intentional \\"lethargic sumo\\" (a long used euphemism for letting one's opponent win). # Guidance and training for stable owners. # Guidance and education for wrestlers. # Considering the establishment of new system exempting wrestlers on injured leave from pay deduction or demotion (this was an acknowledgement that the pressure of being demoted and losing significant salary after injury was a contributing factor in many cases of match-fixing). # Consideration of a policy to encourage a resurgence in competitive spirit in sumo. Court cases Two of the wrestlers implicated by the JSA, Hoshikaze and Sōkokurai, never admitted any wrongdoing and were expelled when they refused to submit resignation papers. Both wrestlers, in separate cases took the JSA to court. Hoshikaze lost his court case in May 2012 and an appeal was denied in October of that year, with a final appeal also denied in October 2013. Sōkokurai succeeded in his case, and the JSA decided not to appeal. Sōkokurai was reinstated and re-appeared on the banzuke for the July 2013 tournament with his prior rank restored.

The regiment was raised in September 1914, and assigned to the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. The regiment fought against the forces of the German Empire and the Ottoman Empire, in Egypt, at Gallipoli, on the Sinai Peninsula, and in Palestine and Jordan. After the armistice the regiment eventually returned to Australia in March 1919. For its role in the war the regiment was awarded sixteen battle honours. During the inter-war years, the regiment was re-raised as a part-time unit based in New South Wales, adopting the designation of the \\"New South Wales Mounted Rifles\\". It was later converted to a motor regiment during the early years of the Second World War before being redesignated as an armoured car regiment. Nevertheless, it was disbanded in early 1943 without having been deployed overseas. During the post war years, the regiment was re-raised as part of the Citizens Military Force, and in 1956 was converted into an infantry unit, and in 1960 was subsumed into the Royal New South Wales Regiment. Formation The 6th Light Horse Regiment was raised at Sydney in September 1914 as part of the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force, and comprised twenty-five officers and 497 other ranks serving in three squadrons, each of six troops.Gullett 1941, p. 54. Each troop was divided into eight sections, of four men each. In action one man of each section, was nominated as a horse holder reducing the regiment's rifle strength by a quarter.Horner and Williams, Chapter: Setting up the Light Horse Its personnel were mostly recruited from the state of New South Wales. Once formed the regiment was assigned to the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, serving alongside the 5th and 7th Light Horse Regiments. All Australian Light Horse regiments used cavalry unit designations, but were mounted infantry armed with rifles, not swords or lances,Gullett 1941, p. 29. and mounted exclusively on the Australian Waler horse.Gullett 1941, p. 38. The regiment was issued a wallaby fur puggaree, which was distinctive to other units. Operational history Gallipoli trooper of the 6th Light Horse Regiment In December 1914, only three months after being raised the regiment sailed for Egypt arriving on 1 February 1915. When the Australian foot infantry left Egypt to take part in the Gallipoli campaign, the light horse regiments were left behind, the authorities believing mounted troops would not be needed in the campaign. The band of the 6th Light Horse played So Long written by Australian composer May Summerbelle as the infantry sailed. However, casualties amongst the Australian infantry were so severe it was decided to send the light horsemen without their horses, as infantry reinforcements. The 6th Light Horse landed on the peninsula on 20 May 1915. They were attached to the 1st Division, and made responsible for the defence of the right flank of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps position. During the campaign they fought mainly defensive actions around the Anzac Cove beachhead, until being withdrawn in December 1915 as part of the Allied evacuation from the peninsula. Sinai and Palestine Campaign On their arrival back in Egypt, the 6th Light Horse, still part of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, were assigned to the newly formed ANZAC Mounted Division. By April 1916, they were positioned to defend the Suez Canal from an Ottoman incursion. In August, the regiment took part in the battles of Romani and Katia, following up the retreating Ottoman forces into the Sinai desert. The regiment spent the next few months patrolling the desert, until fighting in the unsuccessful first and second battles of Gaza. This was followed by the successful battle of Beersheba in October 1917. After the battle the regiment took part in the pursuit of the Ottoman forces, which eventually resulted in the capture of Jerusalem. The 6th Light Horse then took part in an operation along the River Jordan, which ended with the capture of Aman and Es Salt. The Ottoman Empire surrendered soon after that and before returning home the regiment was sent back to Egypt to provide internal security as riots broke out there. In June 1919, the regiment sailed for Australia. Their casualties for the First World War amounted to 111 dead and 461 wounded. The 6th Light Horse in Palestine 1916 The 6th Light Horse Mount Scopus 1918 Perpetuation In 1921, Australia's part-time military forces were re-organised to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF following its demobilisation.Grey 2008, p. 125. Through this process, the 6th Light Horse was re-raised as a Citizens Forces unit within the 2nd Military District in the state of New South Wales, drawing lineage from the 9th Light Horse (New South Wales Mounted Rifles), which had been formed in 1912 and which traced its origins back to the 2nd Australian Light Horse Regiment (New South Wales Mounted Rifles) that had been formed in 1903 as part of the amalgamation of Australia's colonial forces into the Australian Army after Federation.Festberg 1972, p. 43. This unit remained in existence throughout the inter-war years, and at the outbreak of the war the regiment was assigned to the 6th Cavalry Brigade.Finlayson 2012, p. 194. In December 1941, it was converted into a motor regiment, adopting the designation of the \\"6th Motor Regiment (New South Wales Mounted Rifles)\\". In September 1942, the regiment was re-designated the \\"6th Australian Armoured Car Regiment\\". The regiment was deemed surplus to requirements and, as part of a gradual demobilisation of the Australian Army, on 19 February 1943, it was disbanded without having seen operational service during the war. In the post war period, Australia's part-time force was re-raised and in 1949 the regiment was reformed with the designation of the \\"6th Motor Regiment (New South Wales Mounted Rifles)\\". It was corps-allocated to the Royal Australian Armoured Corps at the time, but on 1 July 1956 was re-roled as an infantry unit and transferred to the Royal Australian Infantry Corps, adopting the designation of the \\"6th New South Wales Mounted Rifles\\".Festberg 1972, p. 37. In 1960, the regiment was subsumed into the Royal New South Wales Regiment, forming a company-sized element of that regiment's 2nd Battalion when it was reorganised along Pentropic lines.Festberg 1972, p. 27.

Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. The aircraft is noted because the designer died while test flying the aircraft, due to a design flaw. Design and development The Model A was designed as a very low-cost aircraft to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules, including the category's maximum empty weight of . The aircraft has a standard empty weight of . It features a strut-braced parasol-wing, a single-seat, open cockpit, conventional landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration. The aircraft is made predominately from wood, with some steel and aluminum also used. The fuselage is formed as a wooden geodetic lattice structure. Its span wing is supported by a single lift strut per side, with jury struts and cabane struts. The aircraft is covered in doped aircraft fabric. The pilot is accommodated in the open cockpit, with an optional windshield. The powerplant, specified as a single cylinder, two stroke, carburetted Zenoah G-25 aircraft engine, is mounted behind the pilot and behind the wing, above the fuselage. The main landing gear legs are built from wood laminations. The wings and tailplane can be removed in 20 minutes by two people to permit ground transportation by trailer or for storage. The controls are conventional, but limited in pitch and roll authority, bringing a recommendation by reviewer Andre Cliche not to fly the Model A in windy or turbulent conditions. The designer was flight testing the prototype Model A when it suffered wing aeroelastic flutter. Ritz was killed in the subsequent crash. The flutter was traced to the aileron hinge design, which was later modified to address the issue.

It helps large organizations connect mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers to the company network, and to simplify the information technology (IT) tasks associated with buying, deploying, securing and maintaining such devices. History XcelleNet originally developed the product that would eventually become Afaria, releasing the first version, called SessionXpress, in 1997. It was the first product of the company’s Net-Essentials product suite, and allowed system administrators to remotely manage client systems, including disks, files and sessions. XcelleNet renamed the product to RemoteWare Express later that same year (1997), to CONNECT:Manage in 1999, and finally to Afaria in 2000. Sterling Commerce acquired XcelleNet in 1998, renaming the software CONNECT:Manage (and the group Sterling Commerce Managed Systems Division), but then divested itself a year later. XcelleNet, Inc. became an independent, privately held company in February 2000, and released version 3.5 of the product in May 2000, as Afaria for Handhelds, and version 4.0 in June 2000 as Afaria. Network Computing magazine awarded its Editors Choice award to Afaria version 3.4 in July 2000, and version 4.51 in February 2002. Sybase acquired XcelleNet in 2004. In 2012, Sybase Afaria became SAP Afaria, following the acquisition of Sybase by SAP. Market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC) first recognized Afaria as the leader in mobile device management in June 2001, and has continued to do so every year since, through 2011. In 2011, Gartner identified Afaria as one of the top mobile device management platforms in the first Gartner Magic Quadrant report on the mobile device management market. In the Gartner Quadrant for MDM of June 2014 SAP Afaria is in the Challengers Quadrant. * Version 7.0 SP7: Released October 2015 (as SAP Afaria SP7) * Version 7.0 SP6: Released September 2015 (as SAP Afaria SP6) * Version 7.0 SP5: Released August 2014 (as SAP Afaria SP5) * Version 7.0 SP4: Released December 2013 (as SAP Afaria SP4) * Version 7.0 SP2: Released December 2012 (as SAP Afaria SP2) * Version 7.0: Released April 2012 (as SAP Afaria) * Version 6.6: Released September 2010 * Version 6.5: Released November 2009 * Version 6.0: Released December 2008 * Version 5.0: Released November 2003 * Version 4.0: Released June 2000 (as Afaria) * Version 3.5: Released May 2000 (as Afaria for Handhelds) * Version 3.0: Released October 1999 * Version 2.0: Released February 1999 (as CONNECT:Manage) * Version 1.2: Released October 1997 (as RemoteWare Express) * Version 1.0: Released February 1997 (as SessionXpress) Design features SAP Afaria uses a session-based approach when it communicates with mobile devices in the field. This allows it to circumvent issues related to intermittent connections caused by roaming devices that might lose their network connectivity during a data transmission in progress. SAP Afaria organizes its tasks into worklists and sendlists. These are called channels. When a device, or \\"client,\\" connects to the server (called a transmitter), the channels execute their tasks. Administrators manipulate the tasks in the channels using a graphical interface with a tree structure. To download the device component of the software (called provisioning), an organization’s IT department sends an SMS or SMTP email to each device with a link to the Afaria server. End users (or IT) can click the link to start the download. Or users download the client from an online distribution platform and enter a short code that enrolls the device and applies policies. Usage Companies commonly use SAP Afaria to manage a large number of company-owned or employee-owned mobile devices that employees use for work. Due to the increasing popularity of smartphones and other mobile devices in the general population, many people now bring their own devices (BYOD) to work. Companies are finding that they must support the use of employees' personal mobile devices in conjunction with corporate email and other applications. An organization that does so benefits from the increased engagement and productivity of its workforce, as employees are able to more easily respond to work tasks when they’re away from the office. Mobile network operators and service providers are two other types of companies that frequently employ mobile device management software such as SAP Afaria.  Security  Several security issues in SAP Afaria were identified. While the total number of those vulnerabilities is relatively small, most of them critical and can be used to access the system. According to security researcher Dmitry Chastukhin, one of the vulnerabilities allowed attackers to take control of all mobile devices connected to it with by mimic a command sent from the server to a mobile client. This command is sent in the form of an SMS message, signed by a SHA256 hash.

N.p., 14 Apr 2011. Web. 28 Nov 2011. A person with this disorder is unable to non-verbally perceive others' emotions in social situations, limiting normal social interactions. The condition causes a functional blindness to subtle non-verbal social-emotional cues in voice, gesture, and facial expression. People with this form of agnosia have difficulty in determining and identifying the motivational and emotional significance of external social events, and may appear emotionless or agnostic (uncertainty or general indecisiveness about a particular thing). Symptoms of this agnosia can vary depending on the area of the brain affected. Social-emotional agnosia often occurs in individuals with schizophrenia and autism. It is difficult to distinguish from, and has been found to co-occur with, alexithymia.Schmitz, Bettina, and Michael Trimble. The Neuropsychiatry of Epilepsy. 1st. London: Cambridge University Press, 2002: 110-111. Presentation Damage to the right temporal occipital region in humans has been associated with the inability to recognize the faces of loved ones, friends, and pets (considered a form of prosopagnosia).Joseph, Rhawn. \\"Agnosia.\\" Brain-Mind. Academic Press, 2000. Web. 28 Nov 2011. This limits the ability to appropriately interact with familiar people, potentially severely damaging interpersonal relationships. People with social-emotional agnosia may distance themselves from interacting with other people and prefer isolation. Maternal behavior is also severely affected, causing mothers to fail to recognize their children as their own.\\"The amygdala theory of autism.\\" Neuroscience and Biobehavioural Reviews. 24 (2000): 367-368 In human children, deficits in imitating and responding to peer social interactions have been observed. Children with this agnosia have also been found to have hyperorality, an increased tendency to investigate objects with their mouths, which is also a common symptom of Klüver-Bucy syndrome. Causes Social-emotional agnosia is mainly caused by abnormal functioning in a particular brain area called the amygdala. Typically this agnosia is only found in people with bilateral amygdala damage; that is damage to amygdala regions in both hemispheres of the brain.Joseph, Rhawn. \\"Agnosia.\\" Brain-Mind. Academic Press, 2000. Web. 28 Nov 2011 It can be accompanied by right or bilateral temporal lobe damage. The amygdala dysfunction causes the inability to select appropriate behaviors in a specific social context. Symptoms can include reduced aggression, fearfulness, competitiveness, and social dominance.Corbett, Blythe, and David Amaral. \\"The Amygdala, Autism and Anxiety.\\" Novartis Foundation Symposium. 251 (2002): 8-10. Those with social- emotional agnosia have difficulty discerning the emotional meaning and significance behind objects, which causes a loss of fondness and familiarity. Bilateral amygdala damage has also been associated with social unresponsiveness, leading to an avoidance of social interactions and a preference for isolation from their own species. Evidence suggests that damage to the amygdala and the limbic system (specifically the amygdala-hypothalamus pathway) results in the loss of the core ability to recognize and interpret the mental states of others, a vital ability in social interactions. The amygdala evokes highly personal emotional memories and the loss of this function causes hypo-emotionality, a general lack of emotion when presented with different stimuli.Joseph, Rhawn. \\"Cognitive & Emotional Neural Networks the Hippocampus, Amygdala, & Memory .\\" Brain-Mind. N.p., 1996. Web. 28 Nov 2011. Hypersexuality has also been observed in those with disconnection in the amygdala-hypothalamus pathway.Joseph, Rhawn. \\"Environmental Influences on Neural Plasticity, the Limbic System, Emotional Development and Attachment: A Review.\\" Human Sciences Press, Inc.. 29.3 (1999): 198. Temporal lobe epilepsy has been shown to cause bilateral amygdala damage which could result in symptoms similar to social-emotional agnosia, but the precise relationship between the two disorders is unknown. Diagnosis Classification Social-emotional agnosia is generally diagnosed through the use of two tests, the Faux Pas Test and the Strange Stories Test. Both of these tests are used to show deficits in theory of mind, the recognition of mental states of others. For people with social-emotional agnosia, it is mainly the emotional states that are difficult for them to recognize. Studies have shown that subjects with amygdala damage perform poorly on both the Faux Pas test and the Strange Stories test.Schmitz, Bettina, and Michael Trimble. The Neuropsychiatry of Epilepsy. 1st. London: Cambridge University Press, 2002: 114-115. =Faux Pas test= The Faux Pas test measures how socially adept one is in certain situations. For this test, a faux pas is considered a statement or action that accidentally offends another person. During the test, the subject or patient is told of various social situations and later asked if one of the people in the story would be offended in the situation. A person with impaired social skills would have difficulty in detecting the faux pas made by characters in the stories. =Strange Stories test= The emotional aspect of social-emotional agnosia is usually assessed with the Strange Stories test. The subject or patient is presented with two sets of stories: social stories that refer to people's emotional states, and physical stories that refer to physical behaviors. Those with deficits in determining others' emotional states will answer questions regarding the emotional stories incorrectly, but will answer questions regarding the physical stories correctly (showing that their comprehension of the stories is not impaired, but instead that their comprehension of emotional states in others is impaired). =Other tests= Another test that could be used to diagnose emotional deficits is the Facial Recognition Test, where subjects are presented a number of pictures of faces with a variety of expressions, and are asked to determine what emotion they are depicting.Valerie, Stone, Simon Baron-Cohen, and Robert Knight. \\"Frontal lobe contributions to theory of mind.\\" Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience. 10.5 (1998): 640-656. Web. 9 Dec. 2011. Differential diagnosis The constellation of symptoms in social- emotional agnosia can also be seen in a number of different behavioral disorders. =Autism or Asperger's syndrome= Both autism and Asperger's syndrome show deficits in understanding others' mental states, including the recognition of emotional expressions. Damage to the amygdala has also been implicated for these disorders, which can explain why the symptoms appear to overlap. =Klüver–Bucy syndrome= Although rare in humans, Klüver–Bucy syndrome has many symptoms that are strikingly similar to those seen in social-emotional agnosia. The amygdala and temporal lobes have been implicated in the pathology of Klüver–Bucy syndrome as well, leading to docility, hyperorality, and in some rare cases hypersexuality. Unlike patients of social-emotional agnosia, people with Klüver–Bucy syndrome also tend to demonstrate visual agnosia (inability to recognize visual stimuli) and have difficulties with visual perception. Research Numerous studies with rhesus monkeys have been performed to see the effects of bilateral amygdala removal. In rhesus monkeys, bilateral destruction of the amygdala has been shown to significantly disturb the ability to behave in a socially normal manner with deficits in detecting the motivational and emotional states of other monkeys. Monkeys with amygdala damage that are reintroduced to their colony willfully exclude themselves from social interaction and isolate themselves from the group. Primate mothers with amygdala lesions appear to lose maternal affection towards their offspring. They seem to consider the offspring a foreign object, sometimes going so far as to harm or throw around the juvenile monkeys. There have been additional studies with rhesus monkeys researching Klüver–Bucy syndrome, which shows similar pathologies and symptoms to social-emotional agnosia (see Related disorders for human comparison). Monkeys with Klüver–Bucy syndrome demonstrated a loss of fear and aggression, hyperorality, and hypersexuality. Unlike the previously mentioned studies regarding amygdala lesions, these monkeys demonstrated problems with visual perception.Salloway, Stephen, Paul Mallory, and Jeffrey L. Cummings.

Biography Birth, early work (1985–2002) Alexeyev was born on 9 March 1985 in Yartsevo, Smolensk Oblast, Russia. His father is a musician and his mother is a chemist. His parents divorced in 1994. When he was about eight or nine years old, Alexeyev first began to write poetry, and at the age of ten became interested in music. In the winter of 1995–96 he enrolled in music school, studying classical guitar. In 1997 he moved with his mother to the city of Belgorod, where he twice won the regional competition for classical guitar: 1st place in 1998 and 2nd in 2000. When Alexeyev was 13 he formed his own rock band. His idols were Nirvana and The Prodigy. In 2001 Alexeyev graduated music school and in 2002 he graduated high school with a \\"gold medal\\". That summer, the musician went to the Russian State Humanities University, and therefore had to leave his band and move to Moscow. Formation (2003–2006) Settled in an RSHU dormitory, Ivan started his solo career. In 2003, he organized the alternative rock band \\"Protivo Gunz\\", composed of non-resident students. It was in his dormitory period that he perfected his mastery of the hip-hop freestyle, and composed most of his demos as Noize MC. The tracks became popular among young people, thanks to the Internet. From 2003 to 2005 Noize MC participated in various freestyle battles, and other clubs and network hip-hop competition. He regularly won prizes in battles, and the group \\"Protivo Gunz\\"toured Moscow and performed in clubs, bars, and outdoor areas. In March 2005, Noize MC won against the famous rapper Young MC, in the final freestyle Battle at the festival of street culture \\"Snickers Guru Clan.\\" Noize MC was invited by the organizers to become a judge and presenter at another large street festival, called \\"Snicckers Urbania\\". In May of this year, Ivan Alexeyev moved out of the dormitory into a rented room on the street Old Arbat. The band \\"Protivo Gunz\\" regularly appeared in impromptu street concerts. Some concerts were interrupted by police. In the summer of 2005 and 2006, Noize MC went with \\"Snickers Urbania\\" on Russia. With the money, the studio recorded songs that were released in various rap compilations. In summer 2006, Noize MC signed to \\"Respect Productions\\" as a solo artist, but continued to sing with the band \\"Protivo Gunz\\". On 9 September 2006 his rock band won the Russian competition \\"Urban Sound\\". Rise in popularity (2007–2008) As the grand prize for winning \\"Urban Sound\\", Protivo Gunz was filmed in a low-budget video for \\"Pesnya dlya radioefira\\" (an old song from the solo repertoire of Ivan Alexeyev), which was shown on the TV channel \\"Muz-TV\\". At the insistence of the label, the artist was specified as Noize MC in the final output. In November 2006, the track appeared on the radio station \\"DFM\\". In March 2007, Muz-TV showed retakes from the making of the music video. The Estonian music video was directed by Hindrek Maasik. 13 April 2007 a contract was signed between Noize MC and Respect Productions, and the Russian subsidiary of Universal Music Group. Music journalists regarded the signing of the contract as a significant event not only for the artist, but for Russian hip-hop as well. \\"This event is not easy to overestimate,\\" said analyst portal Rap.ru. \\"We have seen an underground artist become an artist with an international label name.\\" There was originally a plan to release a Noize MC debut album jointly with Respect Production and Universal Music Russia, but several months later the previous label artist completely handed over rights to Universal Music Group. At the same time, Noize MC won the largest Russian Internet competition – \\"7th official hip-hop battles portal Hip-Hop.Ru\\", which took place from October 2006 to April 2007. He participated in battles with over 3,000 Russian rappers from around the world. A video of one battle \\"Za Zakrytoj dver'u\\" went public in September 2007. The director was again Hindrek Maasik. In the autumn, Noize MC's work was widely broadcast on radio stations and music channels, taking 10th place of \\"100 Best Songs MTV-2007.\\" In the summer of 2007, Ivan Alexeyev starred in a leading role in the project production center Pavel Lungin – the movie \\"Rozygrysh\\", a remake of the 1976 popular picture of Vladimir Menshov. Ivan played Igor Glushko, a senior in high school and young musician, who moved to Moscow from the Tyumen region after the death of his parents. Noize MC also composed the soundtrack to the film. The premiere took place on 22 May 2008. A music video for the song \\"Moyo More\\" was filmed based on the movie, and is being shown on the channel A-ONE .

The population was 75 at the 2010 census. Once the main rail shipping point in Millard County, Oasis declined in importance after the establishment of Delta, now the county's largest city. Geography Oasis is located in the eastern Sevier Desert of Millard County, approximately southwest of Salt Lake City. Oasis lies some southwest of Delta, and just east of the village of Deseret, with which it has always been closely associated. About north is Gunnison Bend Reservoir, the last impoundment of the Sevier River. The area consists of irrigated farmland on the edge of harsh desert, an oasis east of Swasey Mountain. Climate According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Oasis has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated \\"BSk\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Oasis, Utah History The Utah Southern Railroad Extension reached the Oasis area in October 1879, and by 1880 a settlement had begun to develop. Originally named Deseret Station, it became known as Oasis by 1885. In the early years, a small dam near Deseret provided all the irrigation water. Then in 1886, the Oasis and Riverside Canal Company and the Gunnison Bend Canal Company were organized, with ambitious plans to expand the cultivation of the surrounding land. The canal projects took years longer than expected, but supported steady population growth. In the meantime, Oasis's main economic activity was as a railroad station. The precious metal mines of Frisco and Joy provided substantial freight traffic to the shipping point at Oasis. The station served communities as distant as Baker, Nevada, away. It also made an attractive location for shearing sheep, shipping livestock, and outfitting ranches. A small commercial center began to develop, with a general store, hotel, restaurant, saloon, bank, and other small businesses. In 1891, the Deseret Ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints was divided into three congregations, for Hinckley, Deseret, and Oasis. It is from this time that Oasis is usually regarded as a separate community, an outgrowth of Deseret. The location for the town that became Delta was chosen at a 1905 meeting of the Melville Irrigation Company held in Oasis. Originally named Burtner, the new town boomed. The Oasis Land and Water Company was organized in 1908 to develop water and land west of Burtner, but it failed due to flooding and financial problems in 1910. The Burtner project, on the other hand, was wildly successful, selling thousands of acres per month. In the 1910 census, Burtner's population was nearly double that of Oasis. Homesteaders streamed into the makeshift railroad depot, which by 1911 was the busiest in the county. That year Burtner was renamed Delta, and the railroad built a new Delta Station, the largest south of Salt Lake City. The centrally located Delta permanently supplanted Oasis in prominence. Its railroad business gone, Oasis returned to agricultural industries. Alfalfa seed, lumber, and sugar beets were important products. A few businesses rounded up and trained Mustang horses for sale. A creamery was established in 1913. A coal-fired power plant was built in Oasis in the 1920s. Small and inefficient, it served Deseret, Hinckley, and Delta until 1930. The last years of the 1920s were hard on the entire region. Drought, insects, and frost damaged crop yields, and numerous farms closed down under financial difficulties. The Oasis State Bank went out of business in 1928. Continuing drought conditions in the 1930s severely reduced the available irrigation water, and large tracts of farmland in the Oasis area had to be abandoned. In June 1983, about 400 people in the Deseret–Oasis area were evacuated when the Gunnison Bend dam and the DMAD dam above it failed due to that year's excessive spring runoff. Some of water inundated a large area with Oasis approximately in the center, leaving about of farmland with no means of irrigation that year. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 75 people living in the CDP. There were 28 housing units. The racial makeup was 78.7% White, 4.0% American Indian and Alaska Native, 14.7% from some other race, and 2.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 17.3% of the population.

It was among the most significant Russian archaeological findings of the late 20th century. In 2012 she was moved to a special mausoleum at the Republican National Museum in Gorno-Altaisk.  Introduction  The mummified remains of the “Ice Maiden,” a Scytho-Siberian woman who lived on the Eurasian Steppes in the 5th century BC, were found undisturbed in a subterranean burial chamber. Natalia Polosmak and her team discovered the Ice Maiden during the summer of 1993, when she was a senior research fellow at the Russian Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography in Novosibirsk. It was Polosmak's fourth season working on the Ukok Plateau where the Institute was continuing its research into the early habitation of southern Siberia. Nearly two decades later, there are few English language sources available for the important discovery: Polosmak's National Geographic article from October 1994, and a BBC documentary (1997) featuring Polosmak and members of her team are the most informative and accessible. The Ice Maiden was a representative of the Pazyryk culture that thrived between the 6th and 2nd centuries BC in the Siberian steppe. The Ice Maiden's tomb was found on the Ukok Plateau near the border of China, in what is now the Autonomous Republic of Altai. The plateau, part of the Eurasian Steppes, is characterized by a harsh, arid climate. The area is known by the local people as the “second layer of heaven,” one step above ordinary people and events. p. 87. Present day Altai herdsmen still bring their sheep and horses to the plateau during winter because the fierce wind blows the snow off the grass and provides grazing land for the animals despite the freezing temperatures.  Discovery and excavation  The Ukok Plateau Polosmak and her team were guided by a border guard, Lt. Mikhail Chepanov, to a group of kurgans located in a strip of territory disputed between Russia and China. p. 95. A kurgan is a burial mound filled in with smaller sediment and covered with a pile of rocks; typically, the mound covered a tomb chamber, which contained a burial inside a log coffin, with accompanying grave goods. Such burial chambers were built from notched wood logs to form a small cabin, which may have resembled the semi-nomads’ winter shelters. The Ice Maiden's tomb chamber was constructed in this way, and the wood and other organic materials present have allowed her burial to be dated. A core sample from the logs of her chamber was analyzed by a dendrochronologist, and samples of organic matter from the horses’ stomachs were examined as well, indicating that the Ice Maiden was buried in the spring, at some point during the 5th century BC., p. 97. Before Polosmak and her crew reached the Ice Maiden's chamber, they hit upon a second later burial in the same kurgan positioned on top of the Maiden's wooden tomb chamber. The contents included a stone and wood coffin containing a skeleton, along with three horses. Polosmak believes that this secondary burial was that of an outside group, perhaps of subordinate peoples, who considered it honorable to bury their dead in Pazyryk kurgans., p. 96. A shaft dug into the kurgan indicated that this later grave had been robbed, another means by which water and snow entered and seeped into the Ice Maiden's hollow burial chamber. The water collected, froze, and formed an ice block within the chamber which never fully thawed because of the steppe climate, permafrost, and the rocks piled on top of the mound which deflected the sun's rays. The contents of the burial remained frozen for 2400 years, until the time of Polosmak's excavation.  Tomb chamber  Inside the Maiden's tomb chamber was her coffin, which was made of a solid larch wood tree trunk decorated with leather appliqués depicting deer figures. The chamber also contained two small wood tables with tray-shaped tops, which were used to serve food and drink. Horsemeat and mutton had been placed on the tables; the residue of a dairy product, perhaps yogurt, was found in a wooden vessel with a carved handle and stirrer; and some kind of beverage was served in a horn cup to sustain her on her journey. The Ice Maiden and her horses were oriented with their heads toward the east, as was the case in other Pazyryk burials. She was between 20 and 30 years old at the time of her death. The cause of the Ice Maiden's death was unknownTranscript of the BBC/NOVA documentary \\"Ice Mummies: Siberian Ice Maiden\\", Nov. 24, 1998 until 2014, when new research suggested breast cancer, combined with injuries sustained in a fall, as likely culprits. The finding of cannabis in a container near the body led to the supposition that the drug was used to relieve the chronic pain that the woman would have suffered.14 October 2014 Siberian Times article by Anna Liesowska on MRI study She may have had the elevated status of a priestess in her community based upon the items found in her chamber. The Ice Maiden's preserved skin has the mark of an animal-style deer tattoo on one of her shoulders, and another on her wrist and thumb. She was buried in a yellow silk tussah blouse, a crimson-and-white striped wool skirt with a tassel belt, thigh-high white felt leggings, with a marten fur, a small mirror made from polished metal and wood with carved deer figures, and a headdress that stood nearly three feet tall. The size of the headdress necessitated a coffin that was eight feet long. The headdress had a wooden substructure with a molded felt covering and eight carved feline figures covered in gold. There were remains of coriander seeds in a stone dish that may have been provided for the Maiden's medicinal use.  Controversy  The excavation of the Ice Maiden was carried out with great care, although in some ways it has been seen as problematic, due to the methods used to melt the ice and remove the artifacts and body from the coffin. The mummy also suffered deterioration during her transport from the site to the lab (even when she was in a refrigerated space) which resulted in her tattoos fading. Upon discovery of the tomb, the ice mummy was reported to have opium on her. A dispute developed between the Russian authorities and the local inhabitants regarding the Ice Maiden, as local intelligentsia mythologised her as the nomadic progenitor of the Altaian people. Within the context of broader efforts by the Russian Federation's government to undermine regional political agency and, as a result, the cultural sovereignty of the Altai, the Ice Maiden became a focal symbol of Altaian identity. A local journalist described the issue: For 19 years after her discovery, she was kept mainly at a scientific institute in Novosibirsk, but in September 2012, the mummy was returned to the Altai, where she is kept in a special mausoleum at the Republican National Museum in the capital Gorno- Altaysk. Future excavations of the site have since been forbidden, even though it is suspected more artifacts are inside the tomb. DNA research by the Russian Academy of Sciences found clear differences in the Ice Maiden's genetic material and that of modern Altaian communities, which led archaeologists to claim that the mummy was European and that Altaians were recent migrants to the region. This was used as a reason to keep the mummy in Novosibirsk, and in 2004 the archaeologists who had refused to repatriate the Ice Maiden to the Altai because of her supposed European heritage were awarded the prestigious State Prize of the Russian Federation. Claims regarding the Ice Maiden's European or Altaian descent are, however, considered the products of indigenous Altaian cultural identity and political autonomy being undermined by a broad \\"Russian\\" nationalism.

Their aim was to indoctrinate young people into the ideologies of the Nazi Party. They were for young people aged 14 to 18 years old and were single sex, with three schools for girls and the rest for boys. Selection for admission to the schools was rigorous; pupils were chosen for their political dedication and physical fitness, as opposed to their academic prowess. Activities focused on political indoctrination rather than academic studies. The SS often selected future officers from the schools. The AHS should not be confused with numerous schools renamed \\"Adolf Hitler School\\" after Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933, such as the former Martin Luther School in Marburg, the Werner Heisenberg High School in Heide, the Nordstadt School in Pforzheim, the Paul Werner High School in Cottbus, or the Goethe School in Flensburg. There was also a similar network of boarding schools called the National Political Institutes of Education (\\"Napolas\\"). Context The founding was based on plans laid out by Hitler Youth leader, Baldur von Schirach and Robert Ley. It was Ley's intention to erect a \\"Gauburg\\" (citadel) in every Gau, and subsequently create an entire NSDAP school system, transforming the state-supported National-Political Educational Institutes. Resistance to this plan from education minister Bernhard Rust stalled the original project until 1941, when the Adolf Hitler Schools gained the support of the German Labor Front. Until 1941, the schools were collocated with the similarly financed Order Fortresses and oversight for the schools' structure was provided by the Reich Youth Leadership. At the behest of Reichsführer-SS, Heinrich Himmler, some of the training methods at certain Adolf Hitler Schools were blanketed in secrecy. The AHS were expected to provide an example for the Nazi educational revolution. Selection of pupils Only pupils who were pre-selected from the Hitler Youth were admitted. This was followed by a two-week selection process at a camp, where the candidates were evaluated according to specified criteria, standards that included but were not limited to: *Leadership qualities, like proving that they excelled as leaders among their peers *Racial purity via an evaluation of their physical attributes and proof of Aryan genealogical ancestry \\"uncontaminated\\" by non-Aryan races *Medical examinations to establish absolute health *Excelling in competitions designed to test their strength and toughness, like forced marches, war games, gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, and other feats of courage *Strict observance by Hitler Youth leadership of a candidates' social fitness through contests and their social adaptability during leisure time History The first AHS opened on 20 April 1937 (Hitler's forty-eighth birthday) in Pomeranian Crössinsee, and while the Hitler Youth's (HJ) leadership envisioned fifty such schools with in excess of 15,000 students, as late as the end of 1943 only ten schools were operational with a meager 2,027 pupils in attendance. Economic considerations related to the war effort strained the planned budget for the schools. Overall the curriculum at the AHS represented an outright rejection of previous educational ideas since it was anti-traditional, anti-knowledge, anti- Gymnasium, and anti-parent in disposition. While the AHS original educational plan was intended to entirely transform schooling in Nazi Germany, it proved not much more than a duplicate model to the Education Institutes' boarding schools. HJ leaders and Order Fortress teachers operated as overseers and despite the rigid discipline at the schools, all HJ ranks addressed one another using the informal/familiar \\"Du\\", and instead of regional Gauleiter supervising schools in their respective territories, authority was given to Hitler Youth commanders. Frequently, the students were the children of proven Nazi parents but selection was not restricted to this group; however, once a child was selected, there was no withdrawal under any circumstances. Chosen for their racial attractiveness, fitness for sports and drill, as well as political reliability, the candidates disposition or \\"character\\" was developed to reflect \\"honor, bravery, and devotion to the Führer.\\" Historian Lisa Pine asserts that, \\"These institutions represented a microcosm of the Nazi Weltanschauung by fostering the leadership principle, promoting competitiveness, and emphasizing life as a struggle and survival of the fittest.\\" Hitler described the aims of the AHS in the following terms: ::We are bringing talented youngsters, the children of the broad mass of our population. Workers' sons, farmers' sons, whose parents could never afford to put their children through higher education...Later on, they will join the Party, they will attend the Ordenburg, they will occupy the highest positions. We have a goal which may seem fantastic. We envisage a state in which each post will be held by the ablest son of our people, regardless of where he comes from. A state in which birth means nothing, but performance and ability mean everything. Scholarship lagged significantly behind as a criterion for success at these schools, namely since time-honored curricula and teacher qualifications were sacrificed for Nazi commitment. Starting in 1941, the AHS became the \\"Reich Schools of the NSDAP\\"; thereafter, several AHS were housed in emptied sanatoriums or other available cloister schools, and strict regional student assignments ceased with German-speaking pupils from Nazi- occupied territories being admitted. Proving oneself as \\"the best\\" superseded educational success, but despite this fact, pupils received a diploma and the Education Ministry certified students for university study following matriculation from AHS. Some AHS graduates took up leadership positions in the Children's Country Evacuation, and after 1943, many were assigned as flak helpers. Some portion of the training at the AHS explicitly remained military in nomenclature, designed to prepare the AHS graduates for a future role in the Nazi military apparatus—training that endured until the end of the Third Reich itself.

It was the first European settlement in the territory of modern Argentina and was destroyed by Amerindians two years later.Abad de Santillán, pp. 104–108 Antecedents Discovery of the Río de la Plata by Juan Díaz de Solís. He was later attacked and killed by Charrúas. The voyage of Juan Díaz de Solís explored the Río de la Plata, along the coast of Uruguay. In 1516, Solís disembarked on the Uruguay coast shortly after entering the Uruguay River, along with six other men. The local Charrúas saw them and killed them in a swift surprise attack. A boy, Francisco del Puerto, was spared because of his young age. The remaining sailors left and returned to Europe.Abad de Santillán, p. 97 Del Puerto, who was left behind, lived for ten years among the indigenous people. He was rescued by a subsequent European voyage led by Sebastian Cabot. Del Puerto told Cabot rumors of a \\"white king\\" and a mountain of silver that was located north of the Paraná River. Cabot considered the tale to be true, and dropped his initial orders (to seek a path to the Indies shorter than the one found by Magellan-Elcano) in order to look for the mountain.Abad de Santillán, pp. 104–105 The rumor was ultimately proved to be false; there were no precious metals in the La Plata basin. But the European belief in the rumor was one of the reasons for the name of Argentina.\\"Rio de la Plata\\" Encyclopædia Britannica Online Establishment The Sancti Spiritu fort was built next to the Carcarañá River, in what is currently Santa Fe Province. The Spanish enjoyed the warm climate, and Cabot built a house nearby. They got help from the Amerindians, and the priest Francisco García provided religious support. The Amerindians were initially friendly towards the Spanish.Abad de Santillán, pp. 106–107 Cabot left the fort on December 23, in a ship with 130 men, in a quest to find the empire of the White King. He left the other 32 men at the fort. The expedition was a harsh one and the Amerindians were forced into obedience. As a result, they left and did not provide any more food. Many Spaniards did not agree with the actions of Cabot and attempted to mutiny, but after Francisco García revealed their plan, their leader was executed.Abad de Santillán, p. 107 The voyage stopped near the Paraguay River, after hearing there were new ships in the area. Miguel Riflos led some further explorations with 30 men, but most of them died during a mutiny of Del Puerto against Núñez de Balboa, caused by personal enmity. The new ships, which intercepted Cabot before his return to Sancti Spiritu, were led by Diego García de Moguer, who had taken part in the old voyage of Solís. They discussed the validity of exclusive navigation rights on the river, but finally agreed to return to the fort, join forces, request Spanish aid and embark on a second expedition against the White King. Destruction Destruction of the Sancti Spiritu fort Cabot sent three groups of scouts to the west, to seek more information about the White King, but then left the fort without waiting for their return. However, Cabot returned to the fort almost immediately, as he learned that the indigenous peoples in Paraguay and around the fort had become hostile to the Spaniards and had organized a rebellion against them. Cabot and Moguer returned to the fort, where Gregorio Caro had relaxed military discipline. They ordered him to kill a hundred Amerindians as a deterrent, and Cabot abused the cacique Yaguari. The measures were not effective, and the Amerindians became more hostile. Military discipline was still relaxed, despite the return of Cabot.Abad de Santillán, pp. 107–108 Cabot organized a punitive expedition to Paraguay, again leaving Caro in charge of the fort. Cabot confirmed that the Amerindians were about to attack the fort, but continued to the north, trusting that Caro would be able to defend it. The attack came on the night of September 1, 1529. The Amerindians set the fort on fire while all the soldiers were sleeping. When they woke up, realizing defense would be useless, they tried to board the two ships and flee. Most of them were killed and one of the ships was destroyed before it could leave.Abad de Santillán, p. 108 The survivors joined Cabot and García who immediately returned to help. By the time they returned, all remaining Spaniards were dead, and the fort had been burned and razed to the ground. Completely defeated, they left the Americas and returned to Europe. Consequences The destruction of Sancti Spiritu ended the period of Spanish exploration of Argentina, leading to the period of colonization. The rumors of the White King and the silver mountain continued to raise interest in Spain and Portugal. Spain sent Pedro de Mendoza to colonize the area before Portugal could do so. This led to the establishment of the city of Buenos Aires, near the mouth of the River Paraná. Ruy Díaz de Guzmán wrote a history of Sancti Spiritu in his book La Argentina (1612). The book included the story of a woman named Lucía Miranda, involved in a love triangle with a Spaniard and a cacique. Miranda's relationships were said to have inadvertently helped the success of the Amerindians' attack on the fort. The story was repeated by later chroniclers and historians, but it is now known that it was fictitious: there was no woman among the crew of Sebastian Cabot.Abad de Santillán, p. 105 See also * Colonial Argentina References Bibliography * Category:Colonial Argentina Category:Former populated places in Argentina Category:Fortifications in Argentina Category:History of Santa Fe Province Category:Populated places established in 1527 Category:1527 establishments in the Spanish Empire Category:1527 establishments in South America Category:1529 disestablishments in South America Category:1529 disestablishments in the Spanish Empire Category:16th century in the Viceroyalty of Peru ","title":"Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)"},{"id":"34008420","text":"Mohamed Youssef Ibrahim (; born 23 January 1947) is a former minister of interior in the Egyptian Government.

The team was retroactively selected as the co-national champion by two selectors, the National Championship Foundation and Parke H. Davis. Lafayette's national championship this season was one of the most surprising and dramatic in the early history of college football. Lafayette began its season by tying Princeton 0–0, the first tie in their series, and defeated West Virginia three times in three days by a combined score of 56–0. At 4–0–1, Lafayette was set to meet the Penn Quakers on October 24 at Franklin Field. Penn, coached by George Washington Woodruff, was in the midst of a 34-game winning streak and was only guaranteeing Lafayette $150 for a game that would net $10,000. As an intense media war surrounded the game, Lafayette enrolled Fielding H. Yost, a tackle from West Virginia, who Lafayette had defeated in the final game of their series on October 17. With Yost, Charles Rinehart, and the inventor of the football helmet George Barclay on the field, Lafayette won 6–4. It was the first victory of a \\"small school\\" over one of the Big Four (Harvard–Yale–Penn–Princeton). Penn won its next 31 games. Lafayette closed its season with an 18–6 win over Navy. Following the season, Lafayette was recognized as national champions along with Princeton (10–0–1) and was the first national champion outside the Harvard–Yale–Princeton–Penn rotation prevalent during that era. However, absent from their 1896 schedule was the annual rivalry with Lehigh, which cancelled two games scheduled for November in protest over the eligibility and amateur status of Barclay, who had played professional baseball the previous summer.

NME rated Growing Pains a 7/10, saying that \\"DP-U don’t give the most fleeting of shits about anything even remotely modern. Having said that, seeing as most of the attention focused on them thus far has focused on their being either (kindly) grunge revivalists or (unkindly) Nirvana copyists, it’s worth making clear that ‘Growing Pains’ is significantly better than either description suggests. Sure, there’s more than a hint of the Cobain in the ragged guitars and slightly self-centred lyrical conceits, but rather than just aping Nirvana they instead share similar influences – particularly Pixies and Melvins – as well as update the mid-’90s college rock sound that Archers Of Loaf, Guided By Voices and Built To Spill made their own.\\"https://www.nme.com/reviews/dinosaur-pile-up/11607 The Guardian gave the album 4/5 stars, saying, \\"Growing Pains is part Nirvana with the confrontation dialled down, part Foo Fighters with the punkishness turned up. It's great, rowdy fun, though, and nothing gets in the way of the tunes: Never That Together keeps teasing the listener with a brief lift from the Beatles' Please Please Me, and former singles Mona Lisa, My Rock'n'Roll and Traynor should have been hits.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/30/dinosaur-pile-up-growing- pains-cd-review AddictMusic.com gave the album 3/5 stars and have stated, \\"On the album there is only one track that leaves the relentless guitar chugging behind and opts for a softer direction – ‘Hey You’. It is a shame because ‘Hey You’ is very beautiful, and shows the guys do have musical talent. More importantly it shows they are not afraid to deviate from their archetypal sound, yet for some reason they choose not to\\". The review also lists 'Birds and Planes', 'Never That Together' and 'Maybe Its You' as favorites and says, \\"Dinosaur Pile-Up have huge potential and they are definitely ones to look out for in the future, but ‘Growing Pains’ is just a little too repetitive to make it more than just another alt-rock album.\\"http://www.addictmusic.co.uk/reviews/album-reviews/dinosaur-pile-up- growing-pains-friends-vs-records-04102010/ Track listing All songs written and composed by Matt Bigland.

Air travel with firearms and ammunition involves a number of laws, regulations and practices that travelers with firearms or ammunition must comply with and should be familiar with before travel. The main rules are set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), but there are a number of local variations between airlines and local laws that sometimes are conflicting. Ammunition categories are used to define firearm ammunition types considered safe for transport. The UN Division system and UN Number system categorizes any explosive material by the speed of burning and amount of explosive. The United Nations has also instituted a categorisation system specifically for handgun ammunition. Both these systems can be used together to define safe amounts of ammunition that can be carried on various modes of transport, including civilian scheduled flights.  IATA airline scheduled flight permissions and approvals  The phrase Div. 1.4S, UN 0012 or UN 0014 denotes the categories of ammunition that the IATA permits to be carried on passenger flights. In simple terms, each passenger may carry up to 5 kg of weapons cartridges of less than 19.1 mm caliber being either blanks or with solid projectiles, in their checked baggage. The IATA published the minimum requirement for an airline for the carriage of dangerous goods in a table, where ammunition of the following nature can only be carried subject to the following permissions and approvals:  Local deviations from the IATA rules  Local gun laws may deviate from IATA rules by prohibiting it with some types of weapons or having special rules for transport that sometimes conflict with IATA regulations. Airlines may also have their own rules and procedures that sometimes conflict with each other, with IATA rules or even local laws and regulations. For example, some jurisdictions require the firearm and ammunition to be transported in separate cases, while other jurisdictions require them to be transported in the same case. This may, depending on jurisdiction, be solved by using two or more separate cases fitted inside a common larger case. Some jurisdictions even require integral parts of the firearm to be disassembled and put into two separate cases. Travelers are therefore encouraged to check all relevant regulations depending on where they travel, both in regards to the departure, destination and any stopovers.Packing Firearms and Ammunition - Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Permits or licenses may be required.6 Tips for Air Travel With Firearms and Ammunition  Newsmax.com  General ammunition fire safety  Firearm cartridges in general are regarded as being constructed such that they pose little danger during fires.

Nativism and anti-anarchism at the turn of the 20th century, the red scare in the 1920s, and further communist fears in the 1950s each shaped United States nationality law. Though ideological exclusions on entry were largely eliminated in 1990, ideological bars arising from each of these time periods still exist in American naturalization law. This long history has resulted in a naturalization statute that requires naturalization applicants to be \\"attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States\\" (a requirement that has existed since the earliest US immigration laws) and forbids them from adhering to several more specific ideological principles such as totalitarianism, communism, and anarchism. History of ideological qualifications for naturalization The vast majority of the earliest immigrants to the American colonies were English Protestants.Tilner, p. 5.Bennett, p. 2. A greater diversity of immigrants began to enter the colonies in the 1680s, and prior colonists were often intolerant of these newcomers.Tilner, p. 6 Some colonies instituted oaths of allegiance and from time to time banished persons with unpopular views.Leonard Levy, p. 16-61. Nonetheless, no colonies screened newcomers based on their political beliefs. Beginning in the 1790s, immigration began to be seen in a more threatening light.Tilner, p. 9. The 1798 Alien Act arose from fears of foreign radicals infiltrating the new nation.Tilner, pp. 10-11. The law empowered the President to expel aliens \\"judge[d] dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States\\" or suspected of \\"treasonable or secret machinations.\\"A Bill Concerning Aliens, 5th Cong., 2d Sess. § 9 (1798) Though this power was never exercised before the Act's expiration, the Act established the foundations for later exclusions of aliens on an ideological basis.Tilner, pp. 12-13. Haymarket riot increased nativist fears of subversive aliens, which ultimately led to ideological restrictions on immigration. In the early to mid-1800s, anti- alienism faded from view, and immigration policy was relatively liberal.Preston, p. 22. However, anti-immigrant sentiment resurged in the late 1800s as the United States faced an era of economic turmoil.Tilner, p. 15. The strength of socialist and anarchist groups grew in the 1870s and 1880s, causing nativists to fear radicalism among the lower classes.Tilner, pp.15-16.Preston, p. 25. They attributed this radicalism to the influence of foreigners, particularly the strange-seeming new immigrants from southern and eastern Europe.Tilner, p. 16. The 1886 Haymarket riot marked the culmination of nativist fears of subversive aliens.Tilner, pp. 17-19. The 50th Congress of 1887-1889 saw 52 proposals for immigration restrictions.Tilner, 19. Though Congress passed a tightened immigration statute in 1890, the new law failed to exclude anarchists on an ideological basis.Tilner, 21-22. When President William McKinley was assassinated in 1901 by an American anarchist with a foreign-sounding name, a new wave of xenophobia was unleashed.Preston, pp. 30, 34. Calls to exclude anarchists from immigrating intensified, and Theodore Roosevelt's first Congressional address urged the exclusion of aliens who even espoused anarchist beliefs.35 Cong. Rec. 82, 84. At least nine anti-anarchist bills were introduced in the first session of the 57th Congress, and several Constitutional amendments were proposed that would have permitted the suppression of anarchism.Tilner, p. 28. The effort came to fruition in the Immigration Act of 1903, the first act barring immigration solely on the basis of political belief. The 1903 Act rarely was invoked to exclude anarchists.Tilner, p. 35. Between 1903 and 1921, 38 alien anarchists were barred from immigrating. In 1908, the Department of Commerce and Labor undertook a national survey of police chiefs, attempting to identify radicals who might be targeted for deportation. Only a handful were discovered. This lack of enforcement may be explained both by the decline of the anti-nativist movement during this period of relative prosperity, and by the lack of anarchists seeking entry—the anarchist movement was on the decline worldwide, and the anarchist movement that had existed in the US was primarily driven by native-born anarchists.Tilner, p. 36 The primary effect of the Act was symbolic; it \\"constituted 'the small beginnings of a permanent and portentous federal policy.\\" After a decade of relative tranquility in immigration law,Tilner, p. 37. the outbreak of World War I fueled anti-alien sentiments yet again; this time, German immigrants were targeted.Tilner, p. 39. Pushed by the anti-alien fervor, Congress even more restrictive immigrations statutes in 1917 and 1920; these statutes barred even more groups on the basis of ideology. \\"Sabotage and destruction of property were added to the list of forbidden beliefs, deportation, unbounded by any statute of limitations, had been introduced as a means, separate and distinct from exclusion, of controlling alien radicalism; teaching and advising had joined belief and advocacy as grounds for exclusion or deportation; membership in, or affiliation with, [forbidden] organizations ... had become grounds for exclusion and deportation; [and] writing, publishing, circulating, distributing, printing, ... displaying [or possessing for the purpose of distribution] written materials advocating forbidden doctrines had become grounds for exclusion or deportation....\\"Tilner, pp. 50-51. The 1920 Act was passed at the tail end of the First Red Scare.Tilner, p. 51. In the following years of relative political calm, public demands for the removal of foreign radicals waned, and fewer radicals were in fact deported. As the US sank into the Great Depression in the early 1930s, however, alien radicals—now communists rather than anarchists—were again targeted. Various proposals were introduced in Congress to ban communist immigrants.Tilner, p. 52. World War II intensified anti-alien sentiment, and the Smith Act passed Congress in 1940. It banned present and former belief, advocacy, and membership as well as present.Tilner, p. 53. In 1941, Congress additionally authorized consular officers to deny visas to any person the officers had reason to believe would \\"engag[e] in activities which will endanger the public safety\\" and granted the president the power to deport or bar entry to aliens when required by the \\"interests of the United States.\\"Tilner, pp. 54-55. As the Cold War began in the late 1940s and early 1950s, intolerance of foreigners increased further.Tilner, p. 56. In 1950, amidst hysteria and fear of communists, the Internal Security Act was passed into law. It expressly excluded communists, totalitarians, and fascists from the US for the first time.Tilner, p. 61. Unlike the 1903 Immigration Act, which excluded only a few dozen anarchists, the Internal Security Act barred thousands foreigners from entering the US, at least on a temporary basis. When immigration laws were overhauled in the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act, these exclusions—along with all prior exclusions, such as those for anarchists—were recodified. The McCarran-Walter Act also explicitly allowed the deportation of naturalized citizens who engaged in subversive activities. In 1987, the passage of section 901 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act temporarily stopped many deportations based on speech or association, namely those \\"any past, current or expected beliefs, statements, or associations which, if engaged in by a United States citizen in the United States, would be protected under the Constitution of the United States.\\"8 U.S.C. § 1182. Several aspects of the Act, however, limited its protections. Its exemptions allowed regulation of some otherwise protected speech, and in 1988 the protections provided by the act were limited to nonimmigrant aliens, leaving resident aliens without protection.Cole, p. 22. Congress went even further with the Immigration Act of 1990. It limited the exclusion of aliens to those whose \\"entry or proposed activities within the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.\\"Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 8 U.S.C.). Furthermore, aliens cannot be excluded on the basis of their beliefs and activities that would be lawful in the US unless such activity \\"would compromise a compelling\\" foreign policy interest. These amendments addressed only the exclusion and deportation of aliens, however, leaving ideological restrictions on naturalization untouched. Current ideological restrictions on naturalization Candidates of various backgrounds taking the Oath of Allegiance at a naturalization Ceremony at the College of DuPage. Several ideological requirements for naturalization remain under U.S. law. First is the requirement that the applicant be \\"attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same.\\"8 U.S.C. § 1427(a). This is essentially a political test,David Levy, § 7:46. though it \\"should be construed ... in accord with the theory and practice of our government in relation to freedom of conscience.\\"Schneiderman, 320 U.S. at 135 (quoting U.S. v. MacIntosh, 283 U.S. 605, 635 (1931) (Hughes, C.J., dissenting)). The statutory requirement is elaborated in the Code of Federal Regulations, which provides: \\"Attachment implies a depth of conviction which would lead to active support of the Constitution. Attachment and favorable disposition relate to mental attitude, and contemplate the exclusion from citizenship of applicants who are hostile to the basic form of government of the United States, or who disbelieve in the principles of the Constitution.\\"8 C.F.R. § 316.11(a) (2009). Even still, the ideological requirement is \\"nebulous\\";Tauchen, 183 F.2d at 268 (\\"Attachment to the Constitution is an especially nebulous concept, not easy of definition.\\"). it begs the questions of what the \\"basic form of government of the United States\\" is and what the key \\"principles of the Constitution\\" are to which the applicant must subscribe. In Schneiderman v. United States (regarding deportation of CPUSA California state party leader William Schneiderman), the case to develop the attachment requirement in the most detail, the court evaluated the circumstances of a young man whose naturalization was allegedly fraudulent for his failure to satisfy the attachment requirement. The man had been a member of two communist organizations at the time of his naturalization.Schneiderman. Upon questioning, he stated that he \\"subscribed 'to the philosophy and principles of Socialism as manifested in the writings of Lenin'\\" but \\"denied that he ... advocated the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force\\" and \\"considered membership in the Party compatible with the obligations of American citizenship, believing that \\"socialism could be achieved here by democratic processes.\\"Schneiderman, 320 U.S. at 127. The court held that the government had not proved that the man failed to satisfy the attachment requirement. The opinion's broad language emphasized the compatibility of dissident political views with attachment to the constitution. \\"The constitutional fathers, fresh from a revolution, did not forge a political strait-jacket for the generations to come\\", wrote Justice Frank Murphy.Schneiderman, 320 U.S. at 137. The Court observed that Article V of the United States Constitution provides an amendment process without specifying a limit on the scope of amendments and that \\"the many important and far-reaching changes made in the Constitution since 1787 refute the idea that attachment to any particular provision or provisions is essential, or that one who advocates radical changes is necessarily not attached to the Constitution.\\" It further cautioned that \\"sincerity of desires to improve the constitution should not be judged by conformity to prevailing thought\\", because the freedom of thought is the utmost Constitutional value.Schneiderman, 320 U.S. at 138. Beyond the general attachment provision, there are several supplementary specific ideological bars.8 U.S.C. § 1424. These exclusions affect anarchists,8 U.S.C. § 1424(a)(1) communists,8 U.S.C. §§ 1424(a)(2), 1424(a)(3), 1424(a)(5), 1424(a)(6) totalitarians, and advocates of assassination,8 U.S.C.A. §§ 1424(a)(4)-(6) government overthrow by force, destruction of property, and sabotage. The bars apply only to applicants who espoused forbidden views or were members of forbidden groups in the 10 years prior to applying for naturalization; earlier beliefs or membership are not disqualifying.8 U.S.C.A. § 1424(c). Other exemptions from the bar include involuntary membership, membership without awareness of the group's aims, membership under the age of 16, and membership for the purpose of the obtaining food rations or other essentials of living.8 U.S.C.A. § 1424(d). The nature of the conduct or belief that invokes the bar differs among these ideologies. For communists and totalitarians, the prohibited activities are membership and affiliation with relevant organizations,8 U.S.C.A. § 1424(a)(2). the advocacy of relevant doctrines,8 U.S.C.A. § 1424(a)(3). the publishing of relevant doctrines,8 U.S.C.A. § 1424(a)(5). and the association with organizations that advocate or publish relevant doctrines.8 U.S.C.A. § 1424(a)(3), 1424(a)(6). The bar on communism forbids the advocacy of the establishment of communism in the United States, whereas the bar on totalitarianism forbids the advocacy of the establishment of totalitarianism anywhere in the world.David Levy, § 7:69. For advocates of assassination, government overthrow by force, destruction of property, and sabotage, the prohibited activities are advocacy,8 U.S.C.A. § 1424(a)(4). writing and publishing materials that advocate, and membership in an organization that publishes such materials.8 U.S.C.A. § 1424(a)(6). For any membership-related bar to come into operation, a court must find that the membership was a \\"meaningful association\\".Polites, 364 U.S. at 436.Rowoldt.Galvan.INS Interp. 313.2(b). Simply putting one's name on party rolls is insufficient. The individual must have affiliated with the party for primarily political reasons, and his activities in the party must evidence the individual's \\"awareness of the Party's political aspect\\".Gastelnum-Quinones. Courts have found a lack of meaningful association in cases where members of trade unions or political movements are unaware the organizations are dominated by the communist party,In re Pruna.In the Matter of C——. and even in cases where communist party members attended party meetings, paid dues, or ran the party's bookstore. Ideological requirements and the First Amendment In other contexts, regulations of speech based on content or viewpoint are presumptively invalid under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, being evaluated using the \\"most exacting scrutiny.\\"Turner, 512 U.S. at 642. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has explicitly upheld viewpoint- discriminatory statutes in the context of immigration law, though its statements about the free speech rights of aliens have been \\"various and contradictory.\\"Pellegrino. The constitutionality of the 1903 Act was upheld by the Supreme Court in United States ex rel. Turner v. Williams.Tilner, p. 32. The court concluded that Congress \\"possesses the plenary power to exclude aliens on whatever ground [it] deems fit.\\"Tilner, p. 33. Similarly, in Kleindienst v. Mandel, the Supreme Court cited Congress's plenary power over immigration laws as the basis for applying an extremely deferential standard of review to the statutory exclusion of communist aliens from the United States.Kleindienst.

Background Juan Daniel F. Molero recovered from a bout of amnesia incurred as a result of a sandboarding accident by reviewing home video footage shot by himself, his father, and his grandfather in various formats. He subsequently took the old and new footage and created a feature film of the events, with one-third of the final film recorded just after the accident. Using a \\"chaotic\\" editing technique which combined footage from SVHS-C, MiniDV tapes, cellphone videos and an 8mm home movie archive, the 84-minute film simulates the amnesia and recovery by Molero in 2009. Synopsis Reminiscencias deals with the creation and loss of memory and identity though an autobiographic exploration based on the filmmaker's own 2009 instance of amnesia. Molero had to use home movies shot by his father and grandfather, as well as digital footage shot by himself and video clips from his cell phone to determine his own past and find his identity. Reception Indiewire observed that while \\"many avant-garde films feel derivative\\", Molero's was an original, in that its \\"combination of abstractions and concrete reality--achingly gorgeous and poignant--is unique.\\" They also offered that the film was a \\"singular observation of life in Peru\\", shown through its interviews of indigenous Peruvian people, the filmmaker's \\"observations of life in urban Lima\\", and his offering of Peru's natural settings.

He trained at Point Cook in 1926, and following graduation accepted a Short Service Commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF) as there were no places available in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at the time. After four years service in Egypt and Palestine, he returned to Australia and was commissioned into the Citizen Air Force, flying with No. 1 Squadron at Laverton, where he gained flying instructor qualifications. Soon after, he was employed by Guinea Airways as an aircraft captain, and spent five years in Papua and New Guinea (PNG), gaining fame as the rescuer of the Archbold expedition. Koch was transferred to the RAAF Active Reserve upon going to PNG. He joined Qantas a year before World War II broke out, employed predominantly on the Singapore route. He was unfortunate to be the captain of the only Qantas aircraft known to be shot down during that war, when the Short Empire flying boat Corio was lost off Timor (Circe disappeared in 1942, possibly also shot down, and Corinna was destroyed by enemy action on the water at Broome, Western Australia). Post war he was recruited by Lester Brain at the formation of Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), specifically to be Senior Pilot DC4 Skymaster. At 45, he retired from active flying to become Inspector of Safety and Accidents, TAA.  Early career  Aubrey Koch was born at Ulverstone, Tasmania on 2 October 1904, the son of R. W. Koch, later the Building Surveyor of Hobart, and Elinor (Burton) Koch. He was educated at Clemes College, Hobart, and began an Engineering Degree at the University of Tasmania. He was a keen rower, and was in the bow for the 1925 winning crew in the inter-varsity eights in Brisbane. Aviation called, however, and he entered RAAF Point Cook for pilot training in 1926, graduating at the end of the year. He was one of six graduates from his course selected for a Short Service Commission in the RAF. The others were L. C. L. Murray, E. H. Irving, G. Selk, F. Townsend, and C. H. A. Colman. No. 216 Squadron RAF Vickers Victorias at Ismailia (A. A. Koch) Koch was initially sent to England for training and assessment, where he flew the Avro 504, the Armstrong Whitworth Siskin, and the Bristol Fighter. He then accepted a posting to the Middle East, and was attached to No. 208 Army Cooperation Squadron, RAF, at Heliopolis, Egypt. There he was operational on the Bristol Fighter, and in August and September 1929 was involved in the suppression of the Hebron riots. Whilst on leave in Australia in 1929, Koch met with Lieutenant Colonel Horace Brinsmead, Controller of Civil Aviation, who advised him to gain experience on larger aircraft. However, his application for posting to a twin-engine squadron was refused. In May 1930, the Squadron re-equipped with Armstrong Whitworth Atlas. Koch was also allowed to convert to the Vickers Vimy at No. 216 Squadron, and flew as second pilot on Vickers Victoria aircraft. He returned to Australia at the end of 1930, arriving in Melbourne on 15 December. In Egypt, Koch had continued his interest in rifle shooting and photography. Employment in public transport aviation was difficult to find in 1931, but Koch was able to continue flying with the Citizen Air Force at No. 1 Squadron, Laverton. He flew as second pilot without pay for Australian National Airways in 1931, to gain experience, and was lucky not to be aboard the ill-fated Southern Cloud, when family commitments prevented him taking his position. In mid-1933 he was appointed instructor with the Australian Aero Club, based at Essendon Aerodrome. In November 1933, he was recruited by Guinea Airways as an aircraft captain, and was to spend the next five years in Papua and New Guinea. He flew the Junkers W 34, the Junkers G 31, and the Ford Tri-Motor during this time, gaining much experience with sea operations when the W34 was float equipped. He gained some fame from his efforts to deliver supplies to the second (1936–37) Archbold Expedition. The expedition had become isolated when its own aircraft was accidentally destroyed in Port Moresby harbour, and was thought to be camped in the Blucher Mountains near the headwaters of the Strickland River, low on supplies and without fuel for its generators. Koch, operating out of Mt Hagen in a Ford fitted with long range tanks, found the party and resupplied it by parachute with food and gasoline. Among his many photographs taken during this period are several of the last known days of Amelia Earhart at Lae aerodrome.\\"The Earhart Project\\" http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Research/Bulletins/27_LaeGallery/27_LaeGallery.html He married Clarice Grant on 1 June 1933, in Melbourne;Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, registration #4621, Clarice Edna Grant/Albert Aubrey Koch the couple were to have a daughter and two sons.New South Wales Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, #44858/455 David Aubrey Koch, 31 October 1939  World War II  Koch finally achieved his ambition of joining what was then known as Qantas Empire Airways (QEA) with an appointment on 4 July 1938. The Singapore service commenced on 2 August 1938 (the westbound service was \\"officially\\" opened on 4 August). In the arcane language of QEA, he was promoted from \\"Extra Mate\\" to \\"Senior Mate\\" in October 1940. This allowed him to fly as relief Captain on the Singapore service. He was soon promoted to \\"Master\\", and in June 1943 to \\"Extra Master\\". QEA was intimately involved in the war effort almost from its beginning, and in late 1940 was contracted to fly 19 PBY5 Catalinas from Honolulu to Australia on behalf of the RAAF. By a convenience, the crews were regarded as civilians (to meet American diplomatic niceties) for this operation, but on other RAAF contracts, particularly to combat zones, they were seen as serving in the RAAF Reserve. Brain, Koch and P.G. Taylor flew the final delivery flight of the Catalina ferry, arriving in Sydney on 24 October 1941, for the first time via Suva, Fiji. This crew determined to commemorate their mission by flying the first airmail delivery between Fiji and Australia, and to that end they had a large number of \\"First Day Covers\\" (but without Airmail stamps) endorsed by the Suva Post Office prior to departure, and by the Sydney Post Office on arrival (some examples of what became collector's items are held by the Qantas Museum). They also transported 200 pounds weight of ordinary mail on behalf of the Fiji postal authorities.Bennett-Bremner, Front Line Airline, p. 26 This plan led to a serious contretemps with Pan American, which had the contract to convey the air mail from Fiji but was not due to start operations until 9 November 1941. Imperial Airways Short Empire Capella c. 1940 (A. A. Koch) Koch returned to the East Indies operation, and on 30 January 1942, when in command of Corio, he was shot down off Timor by seven Japanese Zeros whilst carrying out a relief flight to Surabaya, Dutch East Indies. Of the eighteen people on board, five survived.Gunn, Challenging Horizons, QANTAS 1939–1954 p. 49 Koch was wounded by gunfire in the left leg and left arm, and broke his right leg in the subsequent crash landing.Bennett-Bremner, Front Line Airline, p. 55 Despite the injuries, he swam about five miles to the shore where he was looked after by local people, until the Dutch Navy found the survivors some days later, and rescued them with a Dornier flying boat. Some three weeks later, he was in Darwin hospital on the day of the first Japanese raid on Darwin. By good fortune, the QEA flying boat Camilla survived the raid, and Koch was flown to Sydney for treatment. He was unfortunate again on 22 April 1943 when, in command of Camilla on an RAAF contract involving the transport of military personnel to Port Moresby, he found himself unable to proceed due to bad weather, and was forced to attempt a night landing on the open ocean when off the coast of New Guinea. Due largely to the inexperience of his co- pilot, the aircraft broke up on landing, and 13 out of the 31 people on board did not survive. Koch spent about 18 hours in the sea before being rescued at the chance passage of a local steamer.Bennett-Bremner, Front Line Airline, p.166 A. B. Corbett, the Director-General of Civil Aviation, recommended to his Minister that in view of the circumstances no Court of Inquiry be held—in effect Koch was exonerated.Corbett, Report on Loss of QANTAS Empire Flying Boat VH-ADU.  Post-war career  In 1946, the Australian Government determined to nationalise commercial air operations in the belief that air transport was primarily a public service, but was prevented from doing so by a High Court decision. It therefore formed a government airline to compete with the private carriers, which was to be administered by the Australian National Airways Commission, and would operate as Trans Australia Airlines (TAA). Lester Brain was headhunted from Qantas and was appointed General Manager of the new airline. One of his first appointments was that of Captain Aubrey Koch to be Senior Pilot DC4 Skymaster.

Formation  The union was formed when the Victorian Liquor Trades Union merged with other state-based unions representing brewery workers in 1910. The union grew rapidly, incorporating workers from kindred industries, and in 1968 merged with the Hotel Club Restaurant and Caterers' Employees' Union of New South Wales. The New South Wales branch was the largest state branch of the union (with 68 percent of the union's membership in 1976).

For the past five years she has collaborated with some twenty other colleagues in the John Templeton Foundation-sponsored Flame of Love Project (www.godlyloveproject.org) to develop a model of “Godly Love” that demonstrates the dynamic process in which experiences of the divine contribute to a better understanding human benevolence.

Overview The weapon developed on its own initiative, out of competition and technical tasks. The weapon has no bolt, but a stationary breech and movable barrels with its own gas cylinders with piston connected to the next barrel. Upon firing one barrel, the next one was forced backwards, and thus caused the next barrel to move forward. When firing operates a feeding device that channels rounds into the barrels, with the spent cartridges ejected from both sides. The barrels move back and forth the full length of the cartridge.

The railroad was operated by U.S. Rail Partners until 2013, when the Colebrookdale Railroad Preservation Trust took over. Operations The Eastern Berks Gateway Railroad operates the long Colebrookdale Spur between Boyertown and Pottstown. In Pottstown, it interchanges with the Norfolk Southern Railway. The railroad is operated by the Colebrookdale Railroad Preservation Trust. The tracks the railroad operates on are owned by Berks County. The inaugural run of a passenger service geared towards railfan tourism took place on January 17, 2014. The passenger line was ready for regular operation in October 2014 and is operated as the Colebrookdale Railroad. History The Colebrookdale Railroad started building the railroad line between Boyertown and Pottstown in 1865 to serve the iron ore industry along the Manatawny Creek and trains started running in 1869. The line, which featured both freight and passenger service, originally continued further north to Bechtelsville and Barto before service was later cut back to Boyertown. The Colebrookdale Railroad was leased by the Reading Railroad who operated the line until 1976, when it became a part of Conrail. Conrail planned to abandon the line, but the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation acquired the line and hired operators. The line was operated by the Anthracite Railway, the Blue Mountain & Reading Railroad, and Penn Eastern Rail Lines. In March 2001, Berks County acquired the line for $155,000 to keep it active; the line was soon sold to Penn Eastern Rail Lines. The Colebrookdale Spur was abandoned by the East Penn Railroad (the successor to Penn Eastern Rail Lines) in 2008. The Berks County Redevelopment Authority reactivated the line, with the Eastern Berks Gateway Railroad appointed to operate the line beginning in October 2010. The railroad is working on developing freight traffic on the line. The Eastern Berks Gateway Railroad was owned by U.S. Rail Partners, which is based in Illinois. At the end of 2013, the Colebrookdale Railroad Preservation Trust took over operations of the Eastern Berks Gateway Railroad from U.S. Rail Partners. In 2011, a tourist railroad was proposed to operate on the line. Tourist passenger operations began in early October 2014 with a series of \\"soft\\" trips, intended to work out any operational issues before the full and widely advertised grand opening on October 18.

His rule over Weibo was originally largely independent, but toward the end of his life increasingly integrated with the Later Liang state, in large part due to his massacre of his unruly headquarters guard corps, which lessened the danger of an overthrow but also decreased the strength of the Weibo army and forced its reliance on the Later Liang state.  Background  Luo Shaowei was born in 877, during the reign of Emperor Xizong. His family was from Guixiang (), one of the two counties making up Weibo's capital Wei Prefecture (). At the time of his birth, his father Luo Hongxin was not yet the military governor of Weibo, but was likely an officer in the Weibo army.New Book of Tang, vol. 210. In 888, the Weibo soldiers mutinied against the military governor Le Yanzhen, due to their anger at the mistreatment by Le's son Le Congxun (), forced Le Yanzhen into retirement as a Buddhist monk, and initially supported the officer Zhao Wenbian (趙文㺹) to succeed Le Yanzhen. When Le Congxun, who was then at Xiang Prefecture (相州, in modern Handan), attacked with his own army, Zhao refused to engage Le Congxun, so the soldiers killed him and supported Luo Hongxin instead. Luo Hongxin subsequently defeated and killed Le Congxun, and then killed Le Yanzhen as well. He took over as military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. At some port during Luo Hongxin's rule, Luo Shaowei became the deputy military governor. When Luo Hongxin died in 898, the soldiers supported him to succeed Luo Hongxin. He initially took the title of acting military governor, which then-ruling Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor) confirmed. Later in the year, Emperor Zhaozong commissioned him full military governor,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. and created him the Prince of Changsha.  As military governor   During Tang  Luo Shaowei was said to be decisive and intelligent in his youth, and capable of administration. At some point, Emperor Zhaozong gave him the honorary title of acting Taiwei (太尉, one of the Three Excellencies). In 899, Liu Rengong the military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), who had ambitions of taking over the entire region north of the Yellow River, attacked Weibo with his son Liu Shouwen the military governor of Yichang Circuit (義昌, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei). Liu Rengong first captured Weibo's Bei Prefecture (貝州, in modern Xingtai, Hebei) and slaughtered its population, and then headed for Wei Prefecture. Luo sought aid from Luo Hongxin's long-time ally Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), who sent his generals Li Si'an () and Zhang Cunjing () to aid Luo. Li subsequently defeated Liu Rengong and forced him to withdraw. (During Liu's attack, Luo also sought aid from Zhu's archenemy Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), notwithstanding his father's previous enmity with Li Keyong;Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Li Keyong sent his nephew Li Sizhao to aid Weibo, but before Li Sizhao actually arrived, Lulong forces had already been repelled by Xuanwu forces, so Luo cut off relations with Hedong again.) Late in the year, Emperor Zhaozong gave Luo the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). In 901, Emperor Zhaozong gave Luo the greater honorary chancellor title of Shizhong ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. In 904, Zhu, who had Emperor Zhaozong under his physical control, forced Emperor Zhaozong to vacate the imperial capital Chang'an and move the capital to Luoyang. Zhu ordered his allied circuits to contribute in constructing palaces and various imperial restitutions in Luoyang, and Luo sent his army to build the imperial ancestral temples at Luoyang. In response to this, later in the year, Weibo Circuit was renamed Tianxiong Circuit. Also that year, Luo's noble title was upgraded from Prince of Changsha to Prince of Ye.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. In 905, Li Gongquan (), an officer of the Tianxiong headquarters guard corps (牙軍, Ya Jun), was plotting a mutiny. When Luo discovered this, Li Gongquan burned some of the headquarters buildings and pillaged the city, and then fled to Yichang Circuit.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. Li Gongquan's mutiny caused Luo to become increasingly apprehensive of the headquarters guard corps, which had a 200-year history and had long been key players in the overthrows of past military governors.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 39. He thus secretly informed the situation to Zhu and requested Zhu's aid in destroying the headquarters guard corps. In 906, Zhu sent a 70,000-men army commanded by Li Si'an, claiming to be ready to attack Yichang in conjunction with troops from Weibo and Chengde (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) Circuits to punish it for accepting Li Gongquan. At that time, it happened that Zhu's daughter, who had married Luo's son Luo Tinggui (), had died. Zhu sent his officer Ma Sixun () into the city with an apparently small contingent, claiming to be preparing for Zhu's daughter's funeral — but was in fact a much larger contingent, with soldiers hidden in the containers supposedly containing funereal supplies. Luo then secretly sent soldiers to damage the headquarters guard corps' bows and armors. That night, Luo and Ma jointly attacked the headquarters guard corps. When the headquarters guards tried to fight back, their bows and their armors had been damaged, and therefore they could not fight back and were slaughtered, along with their families, some 8,000 households. The slaughter of the headquarters guard corps shocked and angered the other Tianxiong troops, despite Luo's attempt to explain to them the reasons. A group of soldiers supported the officer Shi Renyu (), who took over Gaotang (高唐, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong) and claimed the title of acting military governor. He sought aid from Hedong and Yichang. However, he was quickly defeated and killed by Zhu's officers Li Zhouyi () and Fu Daozhao (), before those circuits could aid him. Still, even with Zhu's aid, it took Luo half a year to quell all of the mutinies. During that period, with the Xuanwu army present and Luo forced to supply it well, the Tianxiong supplies were exhausted. It was aid that the destruction of the headquarters guard corps ended much of the threat against Luo's rule, but the fighting abilities of the Tianxiong army was thereafter permanently damaged. Luo, in regret, stated, \\"Even with all the iron from the six prefectures and 43 counties of this circuit, I could not have forged a greater error.\\" Later that year, when Zhu launched a punitive campaign against Yichang, Luo became the main supplier for his army. He also built a mansion for Zhu at Wei Prefecture, supplying luxurious items for Zhu. After Zhu was forced to abandon the campaign due to a rebellion by Ding Hui the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), he returned to Wei Prefecture in spring 907 and stayed there for some time to recover from an illness. Luo, fearing that Zhu was contemplating seizing Tianxiong, met Zhu and suggested to Zhu that he should seize the Tang throne. Zhu declined at that time, but was secretly thankful to Luo. Later in the year, he forced Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai to yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266.  During Later Liang  The new Later Liang emperor bestowed the title of acting Taifu (太傅, \\"the emperor's teacher\\") on Luo Shaowei. Meanwhile, the Later Liang regime, while recognized by most regional governors, was unrecognized by several key warlords — Li Keyong, Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), Yang Wo the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), and Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). Liu Rengong and Liu Shouwen did not take clear actions to recognize or not to recognize the new regime. Later in the year, though, after Liu Rengong was overthrown and put under house arrest by another son, Liu Shouguang, Liu Shouguang submitted to the Later Liang emperor. Liu Shouwen thereafter attacked Liu Shouguang, trying to free their father, but his campaign stalemated. Luo, believing that this would be an opportune time to persuade Liu Shouwen to submit to Later Liang, wrote him to persuade him to do so. Liu Shouwen agreed, and thereafter submitted to Emperor Taizu as a subject. In 909, Luo suffered a paralysis in his limb(s), and wrote Emperor Taizong, in an explicit offer to surrender physical control of the circuit: Emperor Taizu was touched, and, while appreciative of Luo's offer, commissioned his second son Luo Zhouhan (Luo Tinggui having died earlier) as the deputy military governor and put Luo Zhouhan in temporary command, stating to Luo Shaowei's messenger: Luo Shaowei did not recover, however, and died in 910. Emperor Taizu made Luo Zhouhan acting military governor, and later full military governor. Luo Shaowei was said to be capable in writing. He had a large book collection, and he established schools at the circuit. Whenever he held feasts for his staff, he would write poems. As he admired the poetry of Luo Yin, a staff member of a fellow Later Liang vassal, Qian Liu the Prince of Wuyue, he sent Luo Yin gifts and referred to Luo Yin as a kinsman (as they were both surnamed Luo). Luo Yin returned the favor by sending his poems to Luo Shaowei. Therefore, when Luo Shaowei collected his own poems into a collection, he entitled the collection, The Collection of My Thefts from Jiangdong (). (Jiangdong refers to the region south of the Yangtze River, where Wuyue was.)

Biography He was one of ten children born to a military family. His father, Thomas, was an equerry to Queen Victoria. It is not clear why the family was in France, but they lived there until 1830, when the July Revolution forced them to leave. After travelling a bit, they settled in Jamaica, where his father owned sugar plantations. He attended the Manning's School in Jamaica and continued at a military academy in Wiesbaden.Brief biography @ the Companion to Tasmanian History. In 1852, he obtained a commission in the Honourable Artillery Company of London and later in the 31st Royal Monmouth Light Infantry. After advancing to the rank of Captain, he resigned his commission to take a civil service position with the British Post Office. In 1858, he married a widow, Henrietta Bunce (1824-1893). They had two sons, one of whom died in infancy, and two daughters. Shortly after the wedding, they settled in southern England, where he sailed and began painting. There is no record of an education in the arts, so it may be assumed that he was self-taught. In 1875, perhaps trying to emulate his father's career as a planter, he took up a land grant in Kittoland, an English settlement in the state of Paraná, Brazil, but found the environment unamenable. The following year, he took up a similar land grant in northeastern Tasmania on the Ringarooma River. He soon abandoned that enterprise too, moving to Sorell, where he held a number of municipal positions including Bailiff of Crown Lands, Inspector of Nuisances and Superintendent of Police. In 1881, he surrendered all of those offices and moved to Wellington Hamlets, a suburb of Hobart, to devote himself entirely to art. In 1899, his views of Mount Wellington and Hobart, some based on photographs by John Watt Beattie, were chosen for Australia's first set of pictorial stamps. In the course of an almost seventy-year career, he produced over 3,000 paintings in various formats and media. His estate was very modest and it is only in recent years that interest in his paintings has revived.

Soon after, he worked as an assistant cameraman in numerous silent film productions, including Fritz Lang's Destiny (Der müde Tod, 1921). From 1925 he worked as co-cinematographer with Heinrich Gärtner, and in the comedy film Die tolle Lola. In 1927, he served as executive director of photography. Mondi initially worked primarily with director Richard Eichberg. In 1935, he joined the permanent staff Veit Harlan. In addition to numerous comedies and entertainment films, Mondi also shot some propaganda films, including the anti-Semitic production Jud Süß (1940). Despite this, Mondi was hired in 1946 by DEFA, the East German state-owned film studio, as one of its chief cameramen. In this capacity he made in 1950 the first DEFA color film Heart of Stone. In the fifties he moved to the West German and Austrian film industry. Here he worked especially for several colorful productions by the director Ernst Marischka, especially the popular Sissi trilogy. He also worked for television in the series Förster Horn.

He started his business by selling domestic chicken eggs door to door. At that time, domestic chicken eggs were not popular in Indonesia, thus his goods were purchased only by expatriates, who lived in Kemang (an area in South Jakarta, Indonesia), as well as few people in Indonesia who had lived abroad before. Over time, the domestic chicken eggs began to be popular so that Sadino's business grew significantly. Sadino then expanded his business by selling chicken meat. He released two books containing his unique view of doing business. People admire his unique view which he called \\"Stupid Learning\\", that we do not need to be smart to start doing business, instead we can use our dullness to start doing business. He illustrates a stupid man will start doing business as soon as an idea pops into his head, while an educated man will spend his time thinking which ideas need to be applied, and then at the end none of his ideas become reality. Sadino also emphasizes that theory without practice is nothing. Furthermore, he also has a unique trademark that he usually wears short-sleeved shirts and shorts on most occasions. Even when he met Suharto, a former Indonesian president, he stuck with his style of dress. Background Bob Sadino was born in an affluent family. He was the youngest among his four siblings. When his parents died, Sadino was still 19 years old. He inherited all his family properties since his siblings were considered to have prosperous lives. Sadino then spent his money to travel around the world. He stopped at the Netherlands and settled there for approximately 9 years. In the Netherlands, he worked at Djakarta Lloyd in Amsterdam and also in Hamburg, Germany. Sadino also met his wife, Soelami Soejoed, in the Netherlands. The Return to Indonesia In 1967, Sadino and his family returned to Indonesia. He brought along his two Mercedes cars. He sold one of his cars to buy a plot of land in Kemang, South Jakarta, and he kept the other car. After had been living in Indonesia for a long time, Sadino decided to quit his job because he had the determination to work independently. His first self-employed job was as a taxi driver of his Mercedes. Unfortunately he got in a car accident, which resulted in his car being badly damaged. Due to lack of money, Sadino switched to becoming a mason. His salary at that time was only IDR 100 (equal to US$0.01 or 1 cent). He experienced a great depression due to the pressure in his life. Resurrection One day, Sadino's friend recommended him to do poultry business focusing in domestic chicken (imported chicken) eggs to fight his depression. Sadino was interested and began to develop a chicken farm. At that time local chicken (native chicken, smaller than domestic chicken) still dominated Indonesia market. Sadino was the one who first introduced domestic chicken and their eggs in Indonesia. Sadino sold domestic eggs door to door. At that time, domestic chicken eggs were not popular in Indonesia so that his goods were only purchased by immigrants(such as Americans, Europeans), who resided in Kemang, as well as few people who had lived abroad. Over time, domestic chicken eggs began to be known throughout Indonesia so that Sadino's business grew rapidly. Sadino then expanded his business by selling chicken meat. Besides introducing the domestic chicken eggs, he also was the first man to apply hydroponic farming system in Indonesia. In the early 1985, the average sales per month of Sadino's companies was 40-50 tons of raw meat, 60-70 tons of processed meat, and 100 tons of fresh vegetables. Books Bob Sadino likes to share his knowledge. \\"I do not want to bring anything when I die, my knowledge should be shared with this world,\\" he said. He has released two books to date, Mereka Bilang Saya Gila! wrote by Edy Zaqeus and Belajar Goblok dari Bob Sadino wrote by Dodi Mawardi Mereka Bilang Saya Gila! (en: They Said I'm Crazy!). This book is not his biography, but a book of provocation that encourages people, especially those who have a bachelor's degree, to want to make a paradigm shift. The paradigm says that theory without practice is nonsense or nothing. Furthermore, he says the movement of entrepreneurship is the trigger of Indonesian revival. The book also reveals Sadino's original concepts about the world of entrepreneurship, education revolution, business art, and discussion of the ideal of leadership in the eyes of a true entrepreneur. Belajar Goblok dari Bob Sadino (en: Stupid Learning from Bob Sadino). This book consists of four Bob Sadino's main ideas, such as the following expression: \\"A smart man usually has smart ideas, maybe even too many ideas, and in the end none of his ideas become reality. While a stupid man may has only one stupid idea and that idea is his only choice and then he apply it.\\" The writing of this book is entirely inspired by the figure of a unique, and controversial Bob Sadino. Sadino also said, \\"If you want to be an entrepreneur, you better not think and plan like a smart person, instead, 'just do it' like a moron.\\" Style of Dress Sadino is often visited by Indonesian presidents, such as Suharto, Megawati Sukarnoputri and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. For most people, when they meet an important person, they will always try to look good and wear neat clothes. This is such a contrary to Bob Sadino who does not hesitate to wear shorts when he meets important persons. As if the shorts is his trademark. Even when invited by the MPR, he still preferred to wear shorts to the point where he was scolded by the staff to \\"dress nicely\\".

Nasmyth (1993). \\"CLB5 and CLB6, a new pair of B cyclins involved in DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\" Genes & development 7(7a): 1160. S-phase cyclin binding to Cdk1 directly stimulates DNA replication as well as progression to the next phase of the cell cycle.Stuart, D. and C. Wittenberg (1998). \\"CLB5 and CLB6 are required for premeiotic DNA replication and activation of the meiotic S/M checkpoint.\\" Genes & development 12(17): 2698. Structure Clb5 and Clb6 are two of the six B-type cyclins in budding yeast, which contain a short, hydrophobic amino acid sequence that allows targeted degradation and phosphorylation of some proteins that regulate DNA replication. This degradation occurs in late mitosis and is regulated by the anaphase promoting complex (APC). Clb1-6 all target and activate the single yeast cyclin- dependent kinase, Cdk1. Clb6 is encoded by 380 amino acids (44.1kDa), and is 49.7% identical to Clb5. Clb5 is 435 amino acids (50.4 kDa). The hydrophobic box motif is found on the C terminus of both cyclins, and includes the conserved FLRRISK sequence characterizing B-type cyclins. Function Clb5 and Clb6 are part of a regulatory network that initiates DNA replication during S-phase. Clb5 and Clb6 levels rise during G1 (earlier than other B-type cyclins) and stay high throughout S and M phases. During S-phase, Clb5 and Clb6 are simultaneously expressed with other genes encoding proteins required for individual DNA strand replication and separation. Clb5 and Clb6 differentially bind to Cdk1, and this activation directly promotes firing of the various origins of replication. Clb5, in particular, has unique hydrophobic section of amino acids that allows specific interactions with proteins in the pre-replication complex bound on the DNA and helps localize Clb5 to DNA replication origins. Clb5 and Clb6 also assist in spindle pole body duplication during S-phase, primarily when Clb3 and Clb4 are inactivated. However, the spindle pole body duplication and its interactions with Clb5 are not well understood. In contrast to the other B-type cyclins, that negatively regulate SCB-binding factor (SBF) and MCB-binding factor (MBF), Clb5 and Clb6 can activate the G1/S transition in the absence of the G1 cyclins Cln1,2,3. These gene regulatory proteins control G1/S genes, and their negative regulation assists in shutting off expression of G1 cyclins during S-phase. Finally, Clb5-Cdk1 has been shown to be important for the phosphorylation of Cdh1 in yeast, and Clb5 destruction promotes dephosphorylation of Sic1. Destruction of Clb5 and Clb6 is usually mediated by APC-Cdc20. Studies have also shown that cells lacking Clb5 and Clb6 have dramatically reduced sporulation efficiencies. Interactions Sic1 Regulation Clb5 and Clb6 levels are high at the beginning of S-phase, though they initially rise in G1. Upon commitment to cell division, G1/S cyclin levels rise, bind Cdk1, and immediately form active complexes. Clb5 and Clb6 are also expressed and bind Cdk1, but are inactive based on control from the Clb-specific Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1. G1/S cyclin-Cdk complexes promote the destruction of Sic1 and allow activation of Clb5- and Clb6-Cdk1 complexes. As the yeast cell transitions through G1, there is a large, inactive pool of Clb5 and Clb6-Cdk1 complexes. After activation, Clb5 and Clb6 can stimulate DNA replication, but also phosphorylate Sic1, targeting it for destruction. Thus, Clb5 and Clb6 are engaged in a positive feedback loop to promote their own activation during this period of the cell cycle. APC Interaction An important regulatory event during G1 is the inactivation of the anaphase promoting complex (APC- Cdh1). Clb5 and Clb6 activation assists in APC-Cdh1 inactivation, although the complete mechanism is unclear. It is hypothesized that Clb5 and Clb6 are somewhat resistant to APC-Cdh1 degradation since they are primarily regulated by APC-Cdc20. Mutations Mitosis There are specific origins of replication that are activated in either the early or late stage of the cell cycle. Directed mutational studies targeting the Clb5 and Clb6 encoding genes have shown that both can activate origins usually replicated early in the cell cycle, but only Clb5 can activate late-stage origins. In cells without Clb5, S-phase is extended because late-stage origins are required to be replicated through the gradual spread of replication forks rather than Clb5-stimulated replication.Epstein, C. B. and F. R. Cross (1992). \\"CLB5: a novel B cyclin from budding yeast with a role in S phase.\\" Genes & development 6(9): 1695. Cells without Clb6 have little to no phenotypic changes since Clb5 can activate both types of origins. In double mutants for Clb5 and Clb6, the onset of S-phase (rather than the length) is significantly delayed, but will eventually occur as a side result of the buildup of other mitotic cyclins (Clb1-4). S-phase length is normal in these double mutants. Meiosis Similar studies have shown a significant difference between mitosis and meiosis progression in cells lacking Clb5 or Clb6, primarily that meiosis S-phase cannot occur properly without Clb5. These mutant cells segregate their unreplicated DNA, which is lethal, and fail to activate the MEC1-DNA M-phase checkpoint, which usually inhibits cell cycle progression if DNA has not been replicated. The inability of Clb1-4 to compensate for the lack of Clb5 activity could potentially be explained by timing and accumulation arguments. In this hypothesis, cyclin concentrations must rise and accumulate to proceed to the next stage of the cell cycle. In mitotic growth, Clb1-4 levels rise immediately after Clb5 and Clb6 levels, allowing rapid accumulation. In meiotic growth, the interval before Clb1-4 levels rise following Clb5 and Clb6 expression is lengthened, allowing less time for accumulation and the resulting high levels required for recovery. There is also evidence that Clb5 mutant cells are less likely to have DNA recombinations from double strand breaks (DSB), which may be a side effect of this Clb5 regulation.Smith, K. N., A. Penkner, et al. (2001). \\"B-type cyclins CLB5 and CLB6 control the initiation of recombination and synaptonemal complex formation in yeast meiosis.\\" Current Biology 11(2): 88-97. Differences between Clb5 and Clb6 There are “subtle and poorly understood” functional differences between these two cyclins. Clb5 activates early and late phase origins of replication, whereas Clb6 only activates late phase origins. Functionally, Clb5 also has a mitotic destruction box that has been implicated in various proteolytic functions. Clb5 has also been shown to rescue Cln1-3 triple mutants, which is unique among B-type yeast cyclins.

These include: * Mount Royal, Albert Road, 1887, now the Australian Catholic University; * Agincourt, Albert Road, 1890, now Jesmond Nursing Home * Institute for Blind Women, Albert Road, 1891, now the Catholic Institute of Sydney; * Inglenook Margaret Street, 1893 (demolished); * Swanton Victoria Street, 1914 (demolished); * Alterations to Strathfield Council Chambers, Homebush Road, 1913; * First floor extensions to Strathfield Council Chambers, Homebush Road, 1921–23; * Strathfield Town Hall, Redmyre Road, 1923; Kent served as an Alderman on Strathfield Council from 1903 until 1905. He designed and built Kelmswood, at 88–94 Redmyre Road in 1893 as his private residence, on the corner of Redmyre Rd and Florence St. Around 1916, Kent moved across the road to 86 Redmyre Road, and called the new house Kelmswood. Kent's original house is now called Woodstock and has been converted to apartments. Family In 1886, Kent married Mary Louisa Elbury Jefferis, the daughter of the Reverend James Jefferis of the Pitt Street Congregational Church. They had two daughters, Gladys and Louise (Lulu), and a son, Geoffrey. Architecture Early work Presbyterian Ladies College, Croydon Farmers and Graziers Warehouse, Ultimo Griffiths Teas, Wentworth Avenue, Surry Hills Bebarfalds, now Woolworths, Sydney When Kent was unable to find employment after graduation from university, he sought advice from John Fairfax. With a recommendation from Fairfax, Kent managed to secure work with master builder John Young. During this time he worked on the construction of the Department of Lands building, St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney and the Garden Palace that was built for the International Exhibition of 1879. He went into private practice in 1882 and his first commission was the design of Eldon Chambers in Pitt Street, Sydney, for Josiah Mullens. In 1886, Kent designed Caerleon in Bellevue Hill, New South Wales for the Fairfax family, only to have it redesigned by Maurice B Adams in the Queen Anne Style (this made it the first Queen Anne home in Australia). Accepting the inevitable changes, Kent agreed to supervise the construction of his made-over design, but was then outraged when Adams exhibited the design in London as his own work.Edquist, Harriet Pioneers of Modernism – The Arts and Crafts movement in Australia, The Miegunyah Press, (Melbourne, 2008) pp 15 In 1890, Kent designed the main school building at the Presbyterian Ladies College, Sydney.State Heritage Register An important early residential design was Lincluden at 12 Fairfax Road, Bellevue Hill, New South Wales, for Sir Thomas Anderson Stuart. The home was constructed 1896–97 and is heritage-listed.State Heritage Register In 1895, Kent designed his first major warehouse. The Farmers & Graziers No. 1 Woolstore building is a 3 & 4-storey Federation style warehouse constructed of face brickwork with sandstone detailing and timber windows and doors. It has in recent years been converted into residential apartments.Department of the Environment Kent and Budden In 1899, Kent entered into partnership with his former student, Henry Budden and the firm became known as Kent & Budden. Buildings of this partnership include: * New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company Limited, wool store, 330 Wattle Street and 89 Jones Street, Ultimo, 1906; * Cheyne, 21 Redmyre Road, Strathfield 1906; Strathfield Heritage https://strathfieldheritage.org/streetnames/redmyre-road- strathfield/cheyne-21-redmyre-road-strathfield/ * Emu Creek, Emu Creek Road, Walcha, 1908;State Heritage Register * Kent House, Liverpool Street, Sydney (1912), now heritage-listed.State Heritage Register * Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children at Camperdown (with Stuart Bros of Annandale)1930 'A Great Architect Retires.', Construction and Local Government Journal (Sydney, NSW : 1913 – 1930), 23 April, p. 17, viewed 16 March 2015, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article133476573 Kent Budden & Greenwell In 1913, Henry Kent and Henry Budden were joined in partnership by Carlyle Greenwell. Greenwell had served his articles with Kent & Budden and after attending Sydney Technical College and the University of Sydney he had completed a Bachelor of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. The partnership of Kent Budden & Greenwell was dissolved in 1919, having produced 150 buildings. Budden and Greenwell continued to work in partnership until 1922. Buildings by Kent Budden & Greenwell include: * Griffith Teas, Wentworth Avenue, Surry Hills in 1915. Kent and Massie Kent and H H Masie became partners in 1919 and practiced together until Kent's retirement in 1930. Massie was a member of an influential banking, commercial and sporting family. Kent & Massie secured many commercial commissions including Bebarfalds,Dictionary of Sydney later Woolworths Limited, in George Street, Sydney. Another of their buildings was Pilgrim House, in Pitt Street (1928). It is heritage-listed. Principal client for Kent and Massie was the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, now NAB.

In the context of a biological system, bifurcation theory describes how small changes in an input parameter can cause a bifurcation or qualitative change in the behavior of the system. The ability to make dramatic change in system output is often essential to organism function, and bifurcations are therefore ubiquitous in biological networks such as the switches of the cell cycle. Biological networks and dynamical systems Biological networks originate from evolution and therefore have less standardized components and potentially more complex interactions than networks designed by humans, such as electrical networks. At the cellular level, components of a network can include a large variety of proteins, many of which differ between organisms. Network interactions occur when one or more proteins affect the function of another through transcription, translation, translocation, or phosphorylation. All these interactions either activate or inhibit the action of the target protein in some way. While humans build networks with some concern for efficiency and simplicity, biological networks are often adapted from others and exhibit redundancy and great complexity. Therefore, it is impossible to predict quantitative behavior of a biological network from knowledge of its organization. Similarly, it is impossible to describe its organization purely from its behavior, though behavior can indicate the presence of certain network motifs. Figure 1. Example of a biological network between genes and proteins that controls entry into S phase. However, with knowledge of network interactions and a set of parameters for the proteins and protein interactions (usually obtained through empirical research), it is often possible to construct a model of the network as a dynamical system. In general, for n proteins, the dynamical system takes the following formStrogatz S.H. (1994), Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, Perseus Books Publishing where x is typically protein concentration: : \\\\dot{x_1} = \\\\frac{dx_1}{dt} = f_1(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) : \\\\vdots : \\\\dot{x_i} = \\\\frac{dx_i}{dt} = f_i(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) : \\\\vdots : \\\\dot{x_n} = \\\\frac{dx_n}{dt} = f_n(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) These systems are often very difficult to solve, so modeling of networks as a linear dynamical systems is easier. Linear systems contain no products between xs and are always solvable. They have the following form for all i: : f_i = a_{i1}x_1 + a_{i2}x_2 + \\\\cdots + a_{in}x_n \\\\, Unfortunately, biological systems are often nonlinear and therefore need nonlinear models. Input/output motifs Despite the great potential complexity and diversity of biological networks, all first-order network behavior generalizes to one of four possible input-output motifs: hyperbolic or Michaelis–Menten, ultra-sensitive, bistable, and bistable irreversible (a bistability where negative and therefore biologically impossible input is needed to return from a state of high output). Examples of each in biological contexts can be found on their respective pages. Ultrasensitive, bistable, and irreversibly bistable networks all show qualitative change in network behavior around certain parameter values – these are their bifurcation points. Basic bifurcations in the presence of error 278x278px Nonlinear dynamical systems can be most easily understood with a one-dimensional example system where the change in some quantity x (e.g. protein concentration) abundance depends only on itself: : \\\\dot{x} = \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x) \\\\, Instead of solving the system analytically, which can be difficult or impossible for many functions, it is often quickest and most informative to take a geometric approach and draw a phase portrait. A phase portrait is a qualitative sketch of the differential equation's behavior that shows equilibrium solutions or fixed points and the vector field on the real line. Bifurcations describe changes in the stability or existence of fixed points as a control parameter in the system changes. As a very simple explanation of a bifurcation in a dynamical system, consider an object balanced on top of a vertical beam. The mass of the object can be thought of as the control parameter, r, and the beam's deflection from the vertical axis is the dynamic variable, x. As r increases, x remains relatively stable. But when the mass reaches a certain point – the bifurcation point – the beam will suddenly buckle, in a direction dependent on minor imperfections in the setup. This is an example of a pitchfork bifurcation. Changes in the control parameter eventually changed the qualitative behavior of the system.  Saddle-node bifurcation  278x278pxFor a more rigorous example, consider the dynamical system shown in Figure 2, described by the following equation: \\\\dot{x} = -x^2 + r where r is once again the control parameter (labeled ε in Figure 2). The system's fixed points are represented by where the phase portrait curve crosses the x-axis. The stability of a given fixed point can be determined by the direction of flow on the x-axis; for instance, in Figure 2, the green point is unstable (divergent flow), and the red one is stable (convergent flow). At first, when r is greater than 0, the system has one stable fixed point and one unstable fixed point. As r decreases the fixed points move together, briefly collide into a semi-stable fixed point at r = 0, and then cease to exist when r < 0\\\\. In this case, because the behavior of the system changes significantly when the control parameter r is 0, 0 is a bifurcation point. By tracing the position of the fixed points in Figure 2 as r varies, one is able to generate the bifurcation diagram shown in Figure 3. Other types of bifurcations are also important in dynamical systems, but the saddle-node bifurcation tends to be most important in biology. Real biological systems are subject to small stochastic variations that introduce error terms into the dynamical equations, and this usually leads to more complex bifurcations simplifying into separate saddle nodes and fixed points. Two such examples of \\"imperfect\\" bifurcations that can appear in biology are discussed below. Note that the saddle node itself in the presence of error simply translates in the x-r plane, with no change in qualitative behavior; this can be proven using the same analysis as presented below.Figure 4. Unperturbed (black) and imperfect (red) transcritical bifurcations, overlaid. u and p are referred to as x and r, respectively, in the rest of the article. As before, solid lines are stable, and dotted unstable.  Imperfect transcritical bifurcation  A common simple bifurcation is the transcritical bifurcation, given by {dx \\\\over dt} = rx - x^2 and the bifurcation diagram in Figure 4 (black curves). The phase diagrams are shown in Figure 5. Tracking the x-intercepts in the phase diagram as r changes, there are two fixed point trajectories which intersect at the origin; this is the bifurcation point (intuitively, when the number of x-intercepts in the phase portrait changes). The left fixed point is always unstable, and the right one stable. Figure 5. Ideal transcritical bifurcation phase portraits. Fixed points are marked on the x-axis, each trajectory in a different color. The direction of the arrows indicates which direction they move as r increases. The red point is unstable, and the blue point is unstable. The black dot at the origin is stable for r < 0, and unstable for r > 0. Now consider the addition of an error term h, where 0 < h << 1\\\\. That is, {dx \\\\over dt} = rx - x^2 -h The error term translates all the phase portraits vertically, downward if h is positive. In the left half of Figure 6 (x < 0), the black, red, and green fixed points are semistable, unstable, and stable, respectively. This is mirrored by the magenta, black, and blue points on the right half (x > 0). Each of these halves thus behaves like a saddle-node bifurcation; in other words, the imperfect transcritical bifurcation can be approximated by two saddle-node bifurcations when close to the critical points, as evident in the red curves of Figure 4. = Linear stability analysis = Figure 6. Imperfect transcritical bifurcation phase portraits. Five values of r are shown, given relative to the two critical points. Note that the y-intercept value is the same as h, or the magnitude of the imperfection. The green and blue points are stable, while the green red and magenta are unstable. The black dots indicate semistable fixed points. Besides observing the flow in the phase diagrams, it is also possible to demonstrate the stability of various fixed points using linear stability analysis. First, find the fixed points in the phase portrait by setting the bifurcation equation to 0: \\\\begin{align} {dx\\\\over dt} = f(x) &= rx - (x)^2 - h \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &= rx^* - (x^*)^2 - h \\\\end{align} Using the quadratic formula to find the fixed points x*: \\\\begin{align} x^* & = {-r \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{r^2 - 4(-1)h} \\\\over 2(-1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = {r \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{r^2 +4h} \\\\over 2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\approx {r \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{r^2} \\\\over 2} \\\\end{align} where in the last step the approximation 4h << r 2 has been used, which is reasonable for studying fixed points well past the bifurcation point, such as the light blue and green curves in Figure 6. Simplifying further, \\\\begin{align} x^* & \\\\approx {r \\\\pm r \\\\over 2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\begin{cases} 0, & \\\\text{fixed point closer to origin} \\\\\\\\\\\\ r, & \\\\text{fixed point further from origin} \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} Next, determine whether the phase portrait curve is increasing or decreasing at the fixed points, which can be assessed by plugging x* into the first derivative of the bifurcation equation. \\\\begin{align} f'(x) & = r - 2x \\\\\\\\\\\\ f'(0) & = r = \\\\begin{cases} >0 , & \\\\text{if } r > 0 \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{unstable (magenta)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ <0 , & \\\\text{if } r < 0 \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{stable (green)}\\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\\\\\ f'(r) & = -r = \\\\begin{cases} <0 , & \\\\text{if } r > 0 \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{stable (blue)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ >0 , & \\\\text{if } r < 0 \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{unstable (red)}\\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} The results are complicated by the fact that r can be both positive and negative; nonetheless, the conclusions are the same as before regarding the stability of each fixed point. This comes as no surprise, since the first derivative contains the same information as the phase diagram flow analysis. The colors in the above solution correspond to the arrows in Figure 6. 428x428px  Imperfect pitchfork bifurcation  The buckling beam example from earlier is an example of a pitchfork bifurcation (perhaps more appropriately dubbed a \\"trifurcation\\"). The \\"ideal\\" pitchfork is shown on the left of Figure 7, given by {dx \\\\over dt} = rx - x^3 and r = 0 is where the bifurcation occurs, represented by the black dot at the origin of Figure 8. As r increases past 0, the black dot splits into three trajectories: the blue stable fixed point that moves right, the red stable point that moves left, and a third unstable point that stays at the origin. The blue and red are solid lines in Figure 7 (left), while the black unstable trajectory is the dotted portion along the positive x-axis. As before, consider an error term h, where 0 < h << 1, i.e. Figure 8. Ideal pitchfork bifurcation phase portraits. Fixed points are marked on the x-axis, each trajectory in a different color. The direction of the arrows indicates which direction they move as r increases. The red and blue points are stable, and there is a third unstable fixed point at the origin, indicated by the black dot. For r = rcrit = 0, the black dot also indicates a semi-stable point that appears and splits into the other three trajectories as r increases. {dx \\\\over dt} = rx - x^3 + h Once again, the phase portraits are translated upward an infinitesimal amount, as shown in Figure 9.Tracking the x-intercepts in the phase diagram as r changes yields the fixed points, which recapitulate the qualitative result from Figure 7 (right). More specifically, the blue fixed point from Figure 9 corresponds to the upper trajectory in Figure 7 (right); the green fixed point is the dotted trajectory; and the red fixed point is the bottommost trajectory. Thus, in the imperfect case (h ≠ 0), the pitchfork bifurcation simplifies into a single stable fixed point coupled with a saddle-node bifurcation. A linear stability analysis can also be performed here, except using the generalized solution for a cubic equation instead of quadratic. The process is the same: 1) set the differential equation to zero and find the analytical form of the fixed points x*, 2) plug each x* into the first derivative f'(x) = {d \\\\over dx}{dx \\\\over dt}, then 3) evaluate stability based on whether f'(x^*) is positive or negative. Figure 9. Imperfect pitchfork bifurcation phase portraits. Four different values of r relative to rcrit are shown. Note that the y-intercept value is the same as h, or the magnitude of the imperfection. The red and blue points are stable, while the green one (previously hidden at the origin) is unstable. As in Figure 5, the black dot indicates a semi-stable point that appears and splits into the red and green ones as r increases.  Multistability  Combined saddle-node bifurcations in a system can generate multistability. Bistability (a special case of multistability) is an important property in many biological systems, often the result of network architecture containing a mix of positive feedback interactions and ultra-sensitive elements. Bistable systems are hysteretic, i.e. the state of the system depends on the history of inputs, which can be crucial for switch-like control of cellular processes.David Angeli, James E. Ferrell, Jr., and Eduardo D.Sontag. Detection of multistability, bifurcations, and hysteresis in a large class of biological positive-feedback systems. PNAS February 17, 2004 vol. 101 no. 7 1822-1827 For instance, this is important in contexts where a cell decides whether to commit to a particular pathway; a non-hysteretic response might switch the system on-and-off rapidly when subject to random thermal fluctuations close to the activation threshold, which can be resource- inefficient. Specific examples in biology Figure 10. GFP expression in individual cells induced by GAL promoter activation follows a bimodal distribution (left), i.e. cells are either expressing strongly or not at all. The right panel demonstrates the hysteresis of the system: activation (bottom) occurs at a threshold of around 20 µM TMG (lactose analog), while deactivation (top) is at around 4 µM. Networks with bifurcation in their dynamics control many important transitions in the cell cycle. The G1/S, G2/M, and Metaphase–Anaphase transitions all act as biochemical switches in the cell cycle. For instance, egg extracts of Xenopus laevis are driven in and out of mitosis irreversibly by positive feedback in the phosphorylation of Cdc2, a cyclin-dependent kinase. In population ecology, the dynamics of food web interactions networks can exhibit Hopf bifurcations. For instance, in an aquatic system consisting of a primary producer, a mineral resource, and an herbivore, researchers found that patterns of equilibrium, cycling, and extinction of populations could be qualitatively described with a simple nonlinear model with a Hopf Bifurcation.Gregor F. Fussmann, Stephen P. Ellner, Kyle W. Shertzer, and Nelson G. Hairston Jr. Crossing the Hopf Bifurcation in a Live Predator–Prey System. Science. 17 November 2000: 290 (5495), 1358–1360. Galactose utilization in budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) is measurable through GFP expression induced by the GAL promoter as a function of changing galactose concentrations. The system exhibits bistable switching between induced and non-induced states.Song C, Phenix H, Abedi V, Scott M, Ingalls BP, et al. 2010 Estimating the Stochastic Bifurcation Structure of Cellular Networks. PLoS Comput Biol 6(3): e1000699. Similarly, lactose utilization in E. coli as a function of thio-methylgalactoside (a lactose analogue) concentration measured by a GFP-expressing lac promoter exhibits bistability and hysteresis (Figure 10, left and right respectively).Ertugrul M.

Born on 13 July 1740,Dodge, Monckton Monckton was the fourth son of John Monckton, 1st Viscount Galway, although the second by his second wife, Jane Westenra of Rathleagh, Queen's County, Ireland. His older half-brother Robert Monckton (1726-1782) became a high ranking general officer in the British army, as later did his nephew, Henry, the son of his brother Edward Monckton, a nabob and Member of Parliament.

In the aftermath, Cornwallis made a rapid retreat to his base at New Brunswick, New Jersey.Fischer, 343 Philadelphia Campaign This view from Osborne's Hill is what the 2nd Grenadiers saw before stepping off. Power lines on the left mark Birmingham Road. At the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September 1777, Monckton led the 2nd Grenadier Battalion, which was formed from 15 grenadier companies taken from the regiments of foot. As the British advanced south from Osborne's Hill, the left flank of the 2nd Grenadiers touched the Birmingham road while the 1st Grenadiers deployed on their right.McGuire (2006), 205 The battalion struck Thomas Conway's 3rd Pennsylvania Brigade, driving it back.McGuire (2006), 235 Near sunset, the advancing 2nd Grenadiers walked into a trap set by George Weedon's fresh Virginia brigade, which was deployed on a reverse slope with its right flank thrown forward so as to take the British line in enfilade. Once he found his troops in a tight spot, Monckton asked Hessian Captain Johann von Ewald to ride back and summon reinforcements. Ewald located James Agnew who brought his 4th Brigade up on Monckton's left. Supported by two 6-pound cannons, the British finally dislodged the Americans as darkness fell, but not before the 64th Foot lost 47 casualties.McGuire (2006), 255-259 The grenadiers also suffered serious losses at Brandywine. Of the 10 British officers killed in the engagement, seven were from the two grenadier battalions, and an additional seven grenadier officers were wounded,McGuire (2006), 226 including Medows, shot in the arm.McGuire (2006), 231 On 26 September 1777, the British army marched into the rebel capital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One witness remembered Monckton leading both British grenadier battalions.McGuire (2007), 14 His circle of friends among the British officers included Sir George Osborn, 4th Baronet, William Harcourt, Richard FitzPatrick, and Sir John Wrottesley, 8th Baronet.McGuire (2007), 49 On 4 October the Battle of Germantown was fought. Monckton double- timed his grenadiers from their barracks in Philadelphia to the field of action. On the way they passed the slower-moving Hessian grenadiers.McGuire (2007), 75 Led by Cornwallis, the grenadiers arrived just as the American attack collapsed. They led the pursuit up Germantown Road as far as Chestnut Hill.McGuire (2007), 120-121 Death at Monmouth Grenadier, 40th Foot In March 1778, Secretary of State for the American Colonies George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville sent orders permitting the evacuation of Philadelphia. Worried about being trapped in the Delaware River by a French fleet, the new British commander Henry Clinton determined to move most of his army to New York by land.Morrissey, 32 The naval transports were packed with most of the army's women and children, 3,000 loyalist civilians, sick soldiers, and the unreliable Ansbach-Bayreuth mercenaries. The transports set sail early on 18 June 1778. That day, Philadelphia was abandoned and Clinton's army marched east to Haddonfield, New Jersey.Morrissey, 33 From there Clinton's army marched in a northeasterly direction via Mount Holly, Bordentown, Allentown, and Imlaystown. Wilhelm von Knyphausen's leading division reached Monmouth Court House on 26 June to be joined shortly by Cornwallis' division. After his army rested on the 26th and 27th, Clinton planned to move northeast to Sandy Hook where naval transports would take his army to New York.Morrissey, 34-37 Meanwhile, Washington moved his army northeast from Valley Forge, Pennsylvania and crossed the Delaware at Coryell's Ferry. On 23 June, the American army reached Hopewell, New Jersey and moved east to intercept Clinton. After some hesitation, Washington appointed his second-in-command, Charles Lee to lead his advance guard.Morrissey, 40-41 At 4:00 AM on 28 June 1778, Knyphausen's division began its march from Monmouth Court House, followed at 8:00 AM by Cornwallis' division. Lee failed to scout the terrain and told his subordinates that he had no plan of battle other than to act according to circumstances. He only began moving forward at 7:00 AM with 5,000 troops and 10 cannons. When Lee arrived near the British positions, Clinton turned back to assist his covering party with strong rear guard forces, including the two grenadier battalions. After some attacks miscarried, Lee's division retreated with Clinton in pursuit.Boatner, 719-721 Eleazer Oswald's cannons probably fired the case shot that killed Monckton. At length, Lee's withdrawing troops met Washington's main body moving forward. Washington relieved Lee of command, but apparently relented and allowed Lee to cobble together a defensive line with the troops at hand. He placed Varnum's Brigade, then under the command of Jeremiah Olney behind a hedgerow. A detachment under Henry Livingston, Jr. took position on Olney's left. Farther to the left, Anthony Wayne directed soldiers led by Walter Stewart and Nathaniel Ramsey into some woods. Lee's chief of artillery, Eleazer Oswald placed two cannons on Olney's right and two more in support of Wayne's troops.Morrissey, 65 Stewart and Ramsey ambushed the 1st Guards Battalion as it passed by. Though their commander Colonel Henry Trelawney and 40 men were hit, the Brigade of Guards and two companies of the 1st Grenadier Battalion rushed the woods. In a hard-fought action, the Americans were flushed from the trees and set upon by the 16th Light Dragoons in the open. Stewart was wounded and Ramsey wounded and captured as their commands raced to cross a bridge to the west side of the ravine.Morrissey, 69 The 16th Light Dragoons tried to charge the hedgerow but Olney's men repulsed them with a blast of gunfire. Clinton personally led forward the 2nd Grenadiers and one wing of the 1st Grenadiers, calling out, \\"Charge, grenadiers, never heed forming.\\" Case shot from Oswald's guns ripped into the grenadiers from a range of , but they stormed the hedgerow anyway, driving back Olney's men. During the desperate action, Washington's chief of artillery Henry Knox ordered Oswald to pull back. Covered by Olney's brigade, he managed to get across the bridge without losing any guns. The action was so chaotic that a party of 16 grenadiers found themselves amid Olney's brigade, but the Americans were so focused on getting away that they paid no attention to their enemies. Sometime during the action at the hedgerow, a British officer saw Monckton fall, struck by grape shot. He detailed some of his soldiers to retrieve his commander, but apparently this was not done. After the battle some men of the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment found Monckton.Morrissey, 69-70 The mortally wounded officer was taken to the Old Tennent Church where he died the same day. Oddly, Clinton did not mention Monckton in his report of the battle. However, Hessian Adjutant General Carl Leopold Baurmeister wrote, \\"Colonel Monckton was killed, a great loss indeed.\\" Monckton is buried in the Old Tennent Cemetery in Manalapan, New Jersey. The inscription on his grave marker reads, > Lt. Col. Henry Monckton who on the plains of Monmouth 28 June 1778 sealed > with his life his duty and devotion to his king and country. This memorial > erected by Samuel Fryer whose father a subject of Great Britain sleeps in an > unknown grave. Because he was found by men of the 1st Pennsylvania, a legend grew up that Monckton was killed while attacking that regiment late in the battle. It was supposed that they not only recovered his body but the colors of his regiment. In fact, the grenadier battalions carried no colors and Monckton fell around noon.Morrissey, 76 In one account, Monckton's mortal wounding and the loss of the colors came late in the day at the hands of Anthony Wayne's troops in front of Washington's main position.Boatner, 724 In another account, Monckton exhorted his men before the fatal attack saying, \\"On to the day!\\" Meanwhile, on the American side, Wayne urged his soldiers, \\"Steady! Steady boys! Wait for the word and pick off the king's birds.\\"Preston, 331 Notes References  * Category:British military personnel killed in the American Revolutionary War Category:British Army personnel of the American Revolutionary War Category:Younger sons of viscounts Category:1740 births Category:1778 deaths Category:Sherwood Foresters officers Category:Burials at Old Tennent Cemetery, Manalapan, New Jersey ","title":"Henry Monckton"},{"id":"34010532","text":"The Simono were an indigenous people who lived in what is now part of the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon and the U.S. state of Texas from at least the 16th century in the 18th century. In the late 1580s or maybe slightly earlier the pressure of the Spanish incursion caused the Simoni to migrate north of the Rio Grande and join forces with the Yojuane as part of the greater Jumano league. By 1709 the Simono were living in eastern Texas along the Rio Brazos in an area known as the Rancheria Grande. In that year a hunting party of Simoni as well as Yojuane and Tusonibi encountered the expedition of Isidro de Espinosa and tried unsuccessfully to get him and his associates to come to the Rancheria Grande and meet with the rest of their families. By the 1740s when most of the Yojuane moved to the San Gabriel River missions the Simoni seem to have lost their separate identity and become subsumed within the Yojuane people.

The bonding process produces joints with a uniform composition profile, tolerant of surface oxides and geometrical defects. The bonding technique has been exploited in a wide range of applications, from the production and repair of turbine engines in the aerospace industry to the atomic nuclear power plantsMazar Atabaki, M. \\"Microstructural evolution in the partial transient liquid phase diffusion bonding of Zircaloy-4 to stainless steel 321 using active titanium filler metal\\".

Metalurgija. 16(4) (2010), 255-268 Process The process differs from diffusion bonding in which diffusion occurs when a melting point represent element from an interlayer moves into lattice and grain boundaries of the substrates at the bonding temperature. Solid state diffusional processes lead to a change of composition at the bond interface and the dissimilar interlayer melts at a lower temperature than the parent materials. Thus a thin layer of liquid spreads along the interface to form a joint at a lower temperature than the melting point of either of the parent materials. This method differs from brazing in that it is \\"isothermally solidifying\\". While holding the temperature above the filler metal melting point, interdiffusion shifts the composition away from eutectic, so solidification occurs at the process temperature. If sufficient interdiffusion occurs, the joint will remain solid and strong well above the original melt process temperature. This is why it is termed \\"transient liquid phase.\\" The liquid solidifies before cooling. Interlayer In this technique it is necessary to select a suitable interlayer by considering its wettability, flow characteristics, high stability to prevent reactions with the base materials, and the ability to form a composition having a remelt temperature higher than the bonding temperature. The joining technique dates back to ancient times.Hawthorne, J.G., Smith, C.S. \\" On divers arts, the treatise of theophilus\\". Chicago: University of Chicago Press.

It was nominated for the 2010 Goya Award for Best Spanish Language Foreign Film.  Synopsis  A story that exposes a clash between neighbors, and how these neighbors deal with their differences. The movie opens with a scene of a sledge hammer creating a hole on a wall that serves as a divider between the houses of two men. On one side of the screen is pure darkness, while light sheds through the hole on the wall on the other side. This contrast of light and darkness symbolizes the two different worlds of the protagonists. Leonardo(Rafael Spregelburd) is a rich and successful designer with a passion for architecture. On the other hand, Victor (Daniel Aráoz) is a used car salesman who is rough around the edges. The conflict of the movie arises when Leonardo discovers that Victor is building a window on the dividing wall. Leonardo claims that this window is illegal and that it violates his privacy because it is openly facing his living room; however, Victor declares that he just needs a little bit of sunlight, which Leonardo has received plenty of in his glass home. Throughout the movie, the men argue back and forth about the window and the problem seems irresolvable.

They were associated with the Jumano and are sometimes identified as having been part of the Jumano people. The Toboso were associated with the inhabitants of La Junta de los Rios near Presidio, Texas. However their living further south and more exposed to Spanish slaving raids led to them having a different reaction to Spanish explorers. For example while the Indians at La Junta, often collectively called Jumanos, welcomed Antonio Espejo's expedition in 1583, the Toboso fled from his expedition in terror.Elizabeth John, Storms Brewed in Other Men's Worlds (College Station: Texas A&M; University Press, 1975) p. 32 The Toboso began to attack Spanish controlled and Tarahumara inhabited missions and mines to their west in the 1640s. Later many of the Toboso were taken to the missions around Monterrey, Mexico. While there they learned Spanish. A large number of the Toboso left the missions and rejected Christianity. The Toboso were classed as \\"ladinos\\" Indians by the Spaniards, a term meaning \\"cunning\\" and indicating they knew the Spanish way of life and used it to be more effective in fighting the Spanish.Anderson, The Indian Southwest, 1580-1830: Ethnogenesis and Reinvention (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1999) p. 24-25 The Toboso also made significant raids against the Tarahumara missions and ranches in the 1690s.Edward H. Spicer, Cycles of Conquest (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1962), p. 30, 34 In the 1680s the Jumano at La Junta were so little aligned with the Toboso that Juan Sabeata was still willing to cooperate with Juan de Retana after Retana spent some time fighting against the Toboso.John, Storms Brewed in Other, p. 182-183 The Toboso were organized by bands. The number of bands decreased over time. In the 1680s there were 12 bands. As of 1693 the Spanish identified only four Toboso bands, the Osatayogliglas, Guazapayogliglas, Chichitames, and Sisimbles.Anderson, The Indian Southwest, p. 25 By 1800 the Toboso who remained in modern Mexico had been essentially absorbed into Hispanic culture.Spicer, Cycles of Conquest, p. 39 However other Toboso migrated to coastal Texas where they resided in and near Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio from 1807 until at least 1828.

They were closely associated with the Jumano and may have also been related to the Tonkawa. They have no connection to the Yowani in Texas, a Choctaw band. Etymology It has been proposed on little evidence that the tribe got its name because one of its members when asked who they were replied \\"yo Juan\\".Anderson, The Indian Southwest, p. 277 Language Many scholars starting with Herbert E. Bolton have held the view that the Yojuane spoke the Tonkawa language or a language related to it. However Gary Anderson argues that the Yojuane spoke the same language or a related language to the Jumano Indians and that this was a Uto-Aztecan language, largely based on the ability of Nahuatl speakers to converse with the Jumano and Yojuane when they first met as part of the Spanish expeditions.Anderson, The Indian Southwest, p. 276-277 History The Yojuane were first mentioned by Spanish chroniclers about 1690. At this time they were led by a man named Cantana who had been on occasion to Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain, essentially modern Chihuahua. Cantana was closely connected with the Jumano of La Junta de los Rios although it is less clear where his people lived at the time. According to Gary Anderson the Yojuane numbered about 1000 at this time. However these included the Cholemes and Cabezas, peoples who seemed to be distinct.Anderson, The Indian Southwest, p. 35 Also associated with the Yojuane were the Simonos and Tusonibis or Tosonibis who had recently fled from Nuevo Leon to join the Yojuane due to the Spanish incursion into that area.Anderson, The Indiana Southwest, p. 277 In 1709 when Isidro de Espinosa met a hunting party of Yojuane the Simonos and Tusonibis were still distinct groups but also hunting with the part.Barr, Peace Came in the Form, p. 46 In the 1740s the Yojuane along with their allies the Deadoses, Mayeyes and Ervipiames asked for Franciscan missions to be established for them. They later moved into missions along the San Gabriel River, moving south and west of the Rancheria Grande.John, Storms Brewed, p. 277 and Anderson, The Indian Southwest, p. 85 In March 1749 there were only 74 Yojuane people counted at the Mission San Francisco Xavier along the San Gabriel River, but there may have been others who were not in the mission.Anderson, The Indian Southwest, p. 86 In 1759 a Yojuane camp was attacked by an expedition of Spaniards and Apaches, with by some accounts a third of the population killed, another third escaping and a third taken as captives.John, Storms Brewed, p. 699 Other sources suggest that 55 Yojuanes were killed and 149, all women and children, were taken captive. Many of the captives died of small pox while those who survived were made into slaves.Barr, Peace Came in the Form, p. 189 (See Battle of the Twin Villages) Among these was a boy who was sold to a Spanish soldier who gave the child the name Miguel Perez. Perez became a Hispanicized Indian of San Antonio but he continued to maintain contact with the Yojuanes. In 1786 Perez was recruited to convince the Yojuanes and their Tonkawa allies to go to war with the Lipan Apache. Perez was able to convince the Yojuane such a war was advisable, and they joined with the Tawakonis, Iscanis, and Flechazos in attacking the Apaches.John, Storms Brewed, p. 699 Notes Sources *Anderson, Gary Clayton.

In the 1980s the Instituto Nacional del Indigena (INDI) resettled the Tomáraho in a community called Puerto Esperanza with the Ebytoso.Mendoza, Marcela. \\"The Aesthetics and Performance of the Ishir of Paraguay.\\" A Contre Corriente. Vol. 5, Number 1. Feb 2007: 310–413. Retrieved 11 Dec 2011.  Name  The Chamacoco are also known as the Ishiro, Yshiro, Jeywo, Yshyro, Xamicoco, Xamacoco, or Yshyr people. Their autonym is Ishír. The term ɨshɨr (also spelled Ishir or Yshyr) properly means 'person', but now is also used with the meaning of 'indigenous' in opposition to the Paraguayan people, who are called Maro.Ciucci, Luca 2013. Chamacoco: breve profilo antropologico e linguistico. Quaderni del Laboratorio di Linguistica della Scuola Normale Superiore n.s. 12  Population  According to the 2002 census the population yshyr in Paraguay that identified themselves as ysyr was 1571 people, mainly located in the district of Fuerte Olimpo in Paraguay, being the largest migrant group which is in the district Ygatimí (85 in 2002). According to data from the brazilian Social and Environmental Institute (ISA), in 1994, 40 individuals were living in the Indian Reservation of Kadiwéu in Brazil.Atlas pueblos indigenas During the 80's, the yshyr were displaced from their lands and relocated by the National Indigenous Institute of Paraguay (INDI) confining them to small riparian areas. In 1986 the tomáraho were moved from San Carlos to Potrerito, to land belonging to the ybytoso, and later were given land in Maria Elena.  Language  A Yshyr speaker, recorded in the United States for Wikitongues. Yshyr (chamacoco) people speak the yshyr, a Zamuco language. The designation \\"chamacoco\\" is probably related to \\"chamóc\\" or \\"zamúc,\\" the ethnonym for the group of the Zamuco Family. The language is called Yshyr ahwoso (also spelled ɨshɨr ahwoso) by the speakers. Yshyr language was studied and described by the Jesuits in the eighteenth century, and includes the dialects tomáraho (or tomaraxa), ybytoso (or ebitoso) and orio.Glosario de lenguas indígenas sudamericanas, Edgardo Civallero, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba In 1930 it was estimated that about 2000 people spoke some variety of language. The speakers of the variants ybytoso and orio were estimated at 800 in 1970, while fewer than 200 people spoke Tomáraho in that times. The yshyr language is considered endangered by the UNESCO and could disappear in a few generations, under pressure from the culturally dominant languages in the region, like Spanish and guaraní. The language shows remarkable morphological similarities with Ayoreo.Ciucci, Luca 2009. Elementi di morfologia verbale del chamacoco. Quaderni del Laboratorio di Linguistica n.s. 8Ciucci, Luca 2013.

History  Map of settlements in the Paraguay River Several ysyr groups lived in the Gran Chaco in the nineteenth century, both inside the territory, and settled on the banks of the Paraguay River. The ybytosos (or ebitosos) have lived for centuries along the Paraguay River, the tomárahos, lived inside the Gran Chaco and until the 1970s were believed to be hostile.Chase Sardi, Miguel (1971). La Situación Actual de los Indígenas del Paraguay Suplemento Antropológico, Vol. 6, Nos. 1–2. Universidad Católica, Asuncion, 1971. During the Chaco War (1932–35), the yshyr fight with Paraguayan soldiers against the Bolivians, but when the war ended, they lost their territories and had to negotiate ethnic survival with the Paraguayan settlers. The remaining tomáraho were living in debt slavery in the remote San Carlos logging camp—and were dying from disease, neglect, and starvation. Whereas the ebytoso had abandoned their rituals as a result of pressure from evangelical missionaries belonging to the New Tribes Mission, the tomáraho still practiced the boys initiation ceremony and had retained a detailed knowledge of myth and shamanism.Renshaw, Jonathan (2007). Article University of Pittsburgh Press “Now our territory is that of the company”, a tomáraho man said, “we live there but it isn’t ours; it does not belong to us and has become an enemy place that is killing us off. Before we were brave and strong, but cohabitation with Paraguayans has tamed us” The Tomáraho worked in the logging camps of the tannin company Carlos Casado and barely survived, ill and malnourished. Their first contact with the ebytoso was in 1981, when Bruno Barrás and Guillermo Mallero, Ishir from Fuerte Olimpo, walked to San Carlos to carry out the first National Indigenous Census. When Escobar visited the tomáraho in 1985 they numbered only 87 people. These groups are now on the verge of disappearing due to the poverty resulting from the transformation of their habitat, degradation of natural resources, and the pressure out of the expansion of economic activity. Young people move to the cities of Paraguay and Brazil, abandoning their beliefs and often denying their origin to avoid being victims of discrimination. In 2009, only three ybytoso communities had legal status and own land, the tomáraho community and has legal status and allocated land without legal property (DGEEC, 2004) with a total of 25,828 hectares. The largest populations are in Puerto Diana and Puerto Esperanza, the smallest in Puerto Caballo.Atlas de las Comunidades Indígenas en el Paraguay (2004) DGEEC - Dirección General de Estadística, Encuestas y Censo de Paraguay  Economy  Traditionally, the Chamacoco were hunter-gatherers. Currently, they farm and raise animals, such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows, horses, and poultry. They work as ranch hands, day laborers, and domestic servants. They create crafts for sale such as baskets, wood carvings, and other creations. Yshyr dissident groups, known as \\"yacareceros\\" are engaged in alligator poaching, a prohibited activity, to survive. \\"contingents of fifteen to twenty men leave in canoes up the river, and interns by the marshlands of río Negro. They hunt for a month, sleeping in their boats and exposed to all dangers: brazilian rangers , most of them ex-convicts, use to shoot to kill before asking\\".Martín Caparrós \\"La Selva Esmeralda\\" First magazine year 4 Nr. 44, May 1990  Mythology  While stories told by ybytoso differ from that from Tomáraho in many respects, the \\"Big Myth\\" yshyr can be summarized as follows: On the occasion of traveling through the jungle, a group of yshyr women met the ahnapzöro (or anapsoro), powerful and terrible gods, strange- looking, that had no factions in their faces. Each of them had different unique characters, covered with feathers, hair, or strange colors. The ahnapsoro lived then with yshyr, and taught them to hunt, use tools, and initiated them in their ritual ceremonies.Escobar, Ticio (2007).The Curse of Nemur: In Search of the Art, Myth, and Ritual of the Ishir. University of Pittsburgh Press. Pittsburgh, PA After a while the coexistence of men and gods became difficult, reaching a crisis with the death of some young people in the harsh initiation ceremonies. Then Eshönewörta (or Ashnuwerta), a leading ahnapzoro, showed the yshyr the vulnerability of the ahnapzoro, so they could kill them by beating them at the ankle, as that there they had there throat. In a short time all the anapsor had been exterminated. only two survived the slaughter: Eshönewörta and the fearsome Nemur, who escaped. When Nemur felt the human drawing up on him, they were already in the place called Karcha Balut he scooped up a snail from the soil or pulled it from his body's thick plumage (depending on the versions) and with an extravagant gesture produced a raging river that sprouted out of its shell. The man and the anapser, separated by the river known today as the Paraguay river, \\"exchange words\\" for the last time. \\"You can run, but your destiny is to remain forever alone\\", pronounces Syr, standing on the riverbank. \\"Your people are numerous\\", replies Nemur from the opposite bank, \\"but they will be forever obliged to follow the words. If they fail, sickness, hunger, and enemies will decimate then until the last Kytymaraha (name of the clan of Syr) is extinguished\\". There is another mythical institution that promotes the balanced use of natural resources: the figure of the Master of the Animals. Every animal has its master its balut, spokesperson, who simultaneously facilitates hunting and severely sanctions its excess. Notes Further reading *Escobar, Ticio.

It was written by David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf, the creators of the series, and directed by Marc Buckland. Synopsis Opening quote: \\"The wolf thought to himself, what a tender young creature. What a nice plump mouthful...\\" After presenting a quote by The Brothers Grimm, the cold open shows a girl in a red sweatshirt running through the woods. She is attacked by a wolf-like creature, after she stops to check out a small figurine lying on the ground. Later that morning, police officer Nick Burkhardt (portrayed by David Giuntoli), and his partner Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby), are discussing Nick's plans to propose to his girlfriend. A woman walks by and while looking at Nick, her face changes to that of a non-human creature. Hank appears not to notice anything. They are then called to investigate the murder of the runner. After visiting the murder scene, Nick and Hank are working at a station of the Portland Police Department. There is a man being processed by another detective, and when Nick looks at him, his face momentarily changes into that of a beast. Nick is again the only one who sees this transformation. Later that night, Nick comes to his home to find his girlfriend, to whom he is preparing to propose, Juliette Silverton (Bitsie Tulloch), conversing with his aunt, Marie Kessler (portrayed by guest star Kate Burton), who had just come to town with a trailer. Nick finds out that Marie is dying of breast cancer, and she informs him that he is one of the last in a long line of people called Grimms, who can see beasts reminiscent of those about which The Brothers Grimm wrote. She is later attacked by one of those beasts, and Nick manages to shoot the creature who, upon dying, transforms back to a human. Badly injured, Marie gives Nick a key, which he is supposed to protect with his life. At the hospital, Marie informs Nick more about his family and the Grimms, and she informs him that all he needs to know is in her trailer. He goes in the trailer that night and finds a various assortment of weapons and a book, which details encounters with various creatures and descriptions of what they are. When attempting to inform his aunt that he has previously seen some of the creatures about which he had read, he finds out she had slipped into a coma. Nick then is informed of a case in which a young girl wearing a red sweatshirt is attacked by a beast in the woods. He connects this to the previous case. At the crime scene, he follows a trail that leads him to the house of a man, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), whom he arrests after seeing his face change. Monroe is found to be clean and then released, but Nick, being suspicious, returns to Monroe's house. After a scuffle, he has a conversation with Monroe, who turns out to be a reformed Blutbad, the same type of creature as the one that attacked the girls. Monroe agrees to help Nick solve the case. After following the scent of another Blutbad, Monroe leads Nick to the Blutbad's cabin in the woods. Monroe begins transforming against his own will and, fearing that he might attack either Nick or the girl, retreats. Nick calls in Hank to investigate the cabin, and the two of them enter the cabin. Hank is initially dismissive of Nick's thoughts, as the Blutbad appears to be a simple postman named Errol Ditmarsch. However, upon exiting the cabin, Hank realizes that Ditmarsch was humming the same song found on the dead girl's iPod: Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) by The Eurythmics. They return to the cabin only to find the lights out, and nobody there. Then Ditmarsch attacks Hank in morphed form, but as he runs out of the cabin, Hank opens fire on him. Nick then tries to interrogate Ditmarsch about the girl's whereabouts, but Ditmarsch only says \\"Grimm...\\" before dying from his wounds. Nick and Hank return to the cabin, and Nick finds a secret passage to the cellar room, under the rug. As both of them enter the cellar room, they find the missing girl and return her to her home. At the hospital, the woman who transformed in front of Nick at the beginning of the episode arrives with a syringe. Realizing who she is, Nick intervenes and gets injected with the syringe instead of Marie. The woman escapes the hospital and meets up with Captain Renard; both of them had conspired to kill Marie. When Renard asks if Marie is dead, the woman says that because Nick was there to save Marie, Marie lived. Renard then tells her that they will have to try the attempt again in the hopes that Nick is not there and Marie is not conscious when they do so. As they drive away, Marie opens her eyes, having fully awakened from the coma. The episode's plot is reminiscent of Little Red Riding Hood. Production Development David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf, who had worked together before on projects such as Angel, conceived the show. Grimm was pitched to NBC as \\"The Brother’s Grimm in the Modern World.\\" The pilot episode was greenlit by NBC in January 2011, and filming began in Portland, Oregon, in March of the same year. Intending to make the set version of the Portland Police Department look as real as possible, the Grimm crew received permission to utilize actual police uniforms (except for the badges). Casting David Giuntoli and Silas Weir Mitchell were the first to be cast, portraying Nick Burkhardt and Monroe, respectively. Russell Hornsby, who portrays Nick's partner, Hank, and Bitsie Tulloch, portraying Nick's girlfriend on the show, were next to be cast. Sasha Roiz was later cast as Captain Renard. Ratings and reception Initial response from the Portland film industry was favorable. Grimm was the third TV series to be produced in Portland, and potential success seemed like a way to bring \\"bigger things\\" to the area. Before the episode premiered on television, promotional screenings were held, and the entire episode was released on social media websites. After a screening at Comic-Con, IGN did a preliminary review of the pilot, noting that \\"the monster effects were much better here than they were in [Angel or Buffy the Vampire Slayer]\\". The series premiere of Grimm was viewed by 6.56 million people, earning a 2.1/6 18-49 rating on the Nielson ratings scale. This means that 2.1 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 6 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. Grimm had the highest non-sports rating on a Friday for any network since New Year's Eve of 2010. Reviews of the episode ranged from mixed to positive. IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, stating that it \\"is grounded in reality, and no costumes or settings tiptoe into an unbelievable place.\\" Newsday, stating that the pilot \\"is a well-made, entertaining TV confection,\\" gave the episode a B rating. The Wall Street Journal said Grimm \\"may be onto something good. It can be genuinely scary (the pilot has a \\"Lovely Bones\\" vibe that's not for children). But it has wit too, and avoids camp.\\" In a comparison with the Once Upon A Time, a show similar in genre to Grimm, The Hollywood Reporter gave Grimm the upper hand based on the pilot episode, calling Grimm \\"more grown-up in its approach than Once Upon a Time because it's more violent and less hokey.\\" However, in a comparison between the two shows by The New York Times, Once Upon a Time was seen as better, being described as \\"having the richer premise and more interesting characters\\".

The episode was written by co-executive producer Sarah Goldfinger and executive producer Naren Shankar, and was directed by Holly Dale. Plot Opening quote: \\"The enchantress was so hard-hearted that she banished the poor girl to a wilderness, where she had to live in a miserable, wretched state.\\" A couple is wandering through the woods when they're captured by a drug dealer. That night, when he prepares to kill them, he is murdered by a creature while they escape. While Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) investigate, Nick discovers buckshot, a hair and a female Blutbad wandering before fleeing. He asks Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) (who is decorating his house for Christmas) to help him. They go to the woods where they find the female blutbad as and chase her before she disappears, they then find her her treehouse, which they climb up to and discover she is living there. Meanwhile, Bud (the man who previously fled scared after realizing Nick was a Grimm) tells two of his friends about Nick's origin. They're skeptical but they realize he's right when they pass his house at night. When Nick arrives home, they flee. Meanwhile, Sgt. Wu (Reggie Lee) tells Hank that the DNA of the hair matches a previous case Hank worked on, about a missing girl, Holly Clark. The dealer's brothers want their brothers body and they eventually kidnap the man from the woods, as he may have taken part in their brother's death. Nick determines that the female Blutbad is Holly Clark. Monroe comforts her while Nick gives the news to Hank. Hank and Sgt. Wu interrogate neighbour James Addison (Ted Rooney). Once they take him to the station, Nick finds camping gear in the treehouse which belongs to Addison, he then calls Hank to let him know what he has found. Upon learning this, Hank then tells Addison who tries attacking him, before Hank arrests him. The brothers arrive at the treehouse, thinking Monroe is responsible for the dealer's death. While he tries to explain, Nick and Holly manage to defeat the brothers. Nick takes Holly back home while Captain Renard (Sasha Roiz) makes an announcement to the media about her rescue. The episode ends as Holly points out Addison as her prime captor while her eyes turn red. Reception Viewers The episode was viewed by 5.16 million people, earning a 1.5/5 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, marking a 5% decrease in viewership and ranking first in its timeslot and for the first time, ranking first for the night in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 1.5 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. Critical reviews \\"Let Your Hair Down\\" received positive reviews. Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.0 out of 10 and wrote \\"This episode shows that the supernatural can be blended in with a soft touch. Holly was a Blutbad, sure, but more importantly she was a lost girl. She survived alone in the woods for years because of her wolf-ness; she was able to come back to reality because of connecting with Monroe. The fairy tale aspect was relevant to the story, but it didn't take center stage. The emotional and scary parts of her ordeal were able to shine through. It was an ideal mix.\\" The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Grimm has too many threads to follow right now, and it's painted itself into a corner where even a few great scenes that move the episodic plot along and tease out some details of the creature world leaves something out, and tonight that was the slow crawl of the season-long arc. There is very little narrative drive beyond a weekly case and some background information from Eddie Monroe. Once Upon A Time finds itself in a position where it's using flashbacks to serve a constant drive forward in an ongoing story, and not focusing as much on the episodic conflicts. Grimm is getting too bogged down in the Law & Order case-of-the-week and not providing enough in serialization. It's still in a state of flux, and doesn't quite know what it wants to be. I'm along for the ride, and any episode that features Silas Weir Mitchell in a bigger role can't be all bad, but 'Let Your Hair Down' is a warning sign that Grimm has too many plates in the air, and if it isn't careful, they're all going to come tumbling down and make a huge mess.\\" TV Overmind's Shilo Adams wrote, \\"When I took on the role of writing about Grimm, I was a tad nervous. I’m not a huge watcher of procedurals and very rarely watch cop dramas in my free time, so I simply hoped that the show would toss in enough serial elements to keep me interested to go along with the expected legal wranglings of Portland, Oregon. After a sluggish start in terms of character beats, it looks like Grimm is on its way to being able to please fans of the serial and procedural elements of TV, if 'Let Your Hair Down' is any indication. Grimm may not stack up character moments like its genre show peers, but when it does decide to give you a peek behind the curtain, it's usually a whole lot of fun, as evidenced by last night's episode that gave just about everybody a moment or two to just be themselves.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.2 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Over the last two episodes, Grimm has found a storytelling pace that really works, and it's beginning to offer payoffs to plot elements laid out weeks ago. Now if only I can figure out if Juliette is an evil-doer and Renard would actually do something fairy tale-ish.\\" References External links * * Category:Grimm (season 1) episodes Category:2011 American television episodes ","title":"Let Your Hair Down (Grimm)"},{"id":"34011042","text":"Theodore W.

The Iranian government announced that the UAV was brought down by its cyberwarfare unit which commandeered the aircraft and safely landed it, after initial reports from Western news sources disputedly claimed that it had been \\"shot down\\". The United States government initially denied the claims but later President Obama acknowledged that the downed aircraft was a US drone. Iran filed a complaint to the UN over the airspace violation. Obama asked Iran to return the drone. Iran is said to have produced drones based on the captured RQ-170.

The government of the United States initially claimed that its forces in Afghanistan had lost control of a UAV on 4 December 2011 and that there was a possibility that this is the vehicle that crashed near Kashmar. According to unnamed U.S. officials, a U.S. UAV operated by the Central Intelligence Agency was flying on the Afghan side of the Afghanistan–Iran border when its operators lost control of the vehicle.U.S. officials, analysts differ on whether drone in Iran TV video is real. CNN.com. (8 December 2011) Retrieved 12 December 2011. There have been reports that \\"foreign officials and American experts who have been briefed on the effort\\" state that the crashed UAV was taking part in routine surveillance of Iranian nuclear facilities inside Iranian airspace. The drone appeared to be largely intact, except for possible minor visible damage on its left wing. Dan Goure, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, stated the largely intact airframe ruled out the possibility of an engine or navigational malfunction: \\"Either this was a cyber/electronic warfare attack system that brought the system down or it was a glitch in the command-and-control system.\\" At least one US source admitted that Iran could have interrupted the data-link and brought it to a soft landing. Some US officials stated the drone broke into three pieces during impact. They claimed that it was reassembled for display purposes and was painted by Iran to hide the damage. The U.S. Department of Defense released a statement acknowledging that it had lost control of a UAV during the previous week, claiming that it was \\"flying a mission over western Afghanistan\\" when control was lost. The statement did not specify the model of the aircraft. The U.S. government also stated that it was still investigating the cause of the loss. A Christian Science Monitor article relates an Iranian engineer's assertion that the drone was captured by jamming both satellite and land-originated control signals to the UAV, followed up by a GPS spoofing attack that fed the UAV false GPS data to make it land in Iran at what the drone thought was its home base in Afghanistan. Stephen Trimble from Flight Global assumes UAV guidance could have been targeted by 1L222 Avtobaza radar jamming and deception system supplied to Iran by Russia. In an interview for Nova, U.S. retired Lt. General David Deptula also said \\"There was a problem with the aircraft and it landed in an area it wasn't supposed to land\\". American aeronautical engineers dispute this, pointing out that as is the case with the MQ-1 Predator, the MQ-9 Reaper, and the Tomahawk, \\"GPS is not the primary navigation sensor for the RQ-170... The vehicle gets its flight path orders from an inertial navigation system\\". Inertial navigation continues to be used on military aircraft despite the advent of GPS because GPS signal jamming and spoofing are relatively simple operations. US acknowledgement On 5 December 2011, U.S. military sources confirmed that the remains of an RQ-170 had been captured by Iranian forces. Media reports indicated that various U.S. officials declined to confirm whether or not the drone in the video released by Iranian state television was authentic. On 8 December 2011, a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Washington Post that the U.S. cannot be certain the drone shown was real because the U.S. does not have access to it, but also stated that \\"We have no indication that it was brought down by hostile fire.\\" A second senior U.S. military official said that a major question is how the drone could have remained \\"virtually intact,\\" given the high altitude from which it is said to have crashed. U.S. Navy Captain John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, told a news conference on 8 December 2011 that Pentagon analysts were examining the video. Both Kirby and fellow spokesman George Little would not comment further on whether the U.S. military believed the drone was the one missing, both did say that the missing drone had not been recovered. Later that day, CBS reported that the US officials had confirmed in private the authenticity of the drone shown by the Iranians.U.S. official: Iran does have our drone. CBS News (8 December 2011). Retrieved 12 December 2011. On 6 December 2011, U.S. officials acknowledged that a drone crashed in or near Iranian airspace and that this belonged to the CIA and not to ISAF as was earlier stated. U.S. officials did not state that the drone shown on Iranian television was actually a real RQ-170 (which has been public knowledge since 2009), although a former U.S. official confirmed that the drone shown on the Iranian state media was a U.S. RQ-170, used for surveillance of Tehran's nuclear facilities. Complaint to UN Security Council On 9 December 2011, Iran lodged a formal complaint to the United Nations Security Council over the UAV violating its airspace. Iran's U.N. ambassador stated in the letter that \\"My government emphasizes that this blatant and unprovoked air violation by the United States government is tantamount to an act of hostility against the Islamic Republic of Iran in clear contravention of international law, in particular, the basic tenets of the United Nations Charter.\\" Request for return by the United States On 12 December 2011, U.S. administration asked Iran to return the captured U.S. drone. The day before, on 11 December, General Salami stated that \\"no nation welcomes other countries' spy drones in its territory, and no one sends back the spying equipment and its information back to the country of origin.\\" On 13 December 2011, Defence Minister of Iran, dismissed the request and said \\"Instead of apologising to the Iranian nation, it is brazenly asking for the drone back.\\" And the ministry spokesman, Mehmanparast, stated that \\"it seems he [Obama] has forgotten that Iran’s airspace was violated, spying operations were undertaken, international laws were violated and that Iran’s internal affairs were interfered with... . Instead of an official apology and admitting to this violation, they are making this request.\\" Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney criticised Obama's decisions on the drone, saying that, after the aircraft went down, the president should have ordered an air strike within Iran: \\"The right response to that would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it. You can do that from the air ... and, in effect, make it impossible for them to benefit from having captured that drone.\\" Instead, \\"he asked nicely for them to return it, and they aren't going to\\". On 17 January 2012, an Iranian company said it would send miniature, pink, toy versions of the captured drone to President Obama as a response to the request for sending the drone back. Reverse engineering of the drone On 10 December 2011, Iran announced that it intended to carry out reverse engineering on the captured RQ-170 Sentinel stealth aircraft. In April 2012, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed to have succeeded in extracting the entirety of the data collected by the drone and are currently in the process of building a replica of the aircraft. Iran claimed to have been approached by countries, including China and Russia, seeking information on the drone. Although U.S. officials expressed concern over the possibility of China or Russia receiving the drone's technology, they cast doubt on whether Iran could replicate the technology of the aircraft, as well as the amount of intelligence data available, due to the precautions installed for malfunctioning drones. On May 2014, Iranian state TV displayed what was claimed to be a reverse engineered RQ-170. Sources familiar with the RQ-170's design say that the Iranian RQ-170 is merely a static mock-up rather than a flyable aircraft. In November 2014 Iran claimed to have carried out a successful test flight of an aircraft based on reverse engineering of the RQ-170. The semi-official Tasnim news agency of Iran reported in September 2016 that a UAV named Sa'egheh, similar in appearance to the RQ-170 Sentinel, had been built. It was said to be able to carry four precision-guided bombs; range was not stated. The Israeli military shot down a Sa'egheh drone during the February 2018 Israel–Syria incident. Israeli medias reported that the UAV's design was indeed largely based on the RQ-170, IAF Brigadier General Tomer Bar said that the drone was quite advanced and emulated western technology.  Decoded footage obtained from captured US drone  On 7 February 2013, Iran released video footage allegedly from the RQ-170 stealth plane. They claim the footage shows the drone coming in for a landing at the Kandahar base. Commander of the Aerospace Division of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Brigadier General Amir-Ali Hajizadeh said in February that all the data on the downed drone was \\"fully decoded.\\" See also * Islamic Republic of Iran Air Defense Force * Yasir (UAV) – An Iranian UAV based on an American type that was captured in a similar incident * Saegheh (UAV), the design of which is alleged to be inspired by RQ-170 * June 2019 Iranian shoot- down of US drone References Category:2011 in international relations Category:2011 in Iran Category:21st-century military history of the United States Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Iran Category:Conflicts in 2011 Category:Iran–United States military relations Category:Lockheed Martin Category:Kashmar ","title":"Iran–U.S. RQ-170 incident"},{"id":"34011045","text":"The Star Experimental School () is a middle school in Wujin District, Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province.

It primarily links the coastal suburbs of the Clarkson- Butler region to the arterial highway Wanneroo Road in the east, and is the current (as of August 2017) northern terminus of the Mitchell Freeway. The road begins as a four-lane dual carriageway at Wanneroo Road, before intersecting with the Mitchell Freeway at Clarkson in the form of an elongated dogbone roundabout separated by a bridge crossing the Joondalup railway line. The road terminates at a roundabout with Marmion Avenue, where it becomes Anchorage Drive North, a local distributor road in the suburb of Mindarie. The speed limit begins at 60 km/h, increasing to 70 km/h at the dual carriageway. Direct access to the Nowergup Rail Depot is also provided by the road. History Hester Avenue was designed in the early 1970s as a new alignment of Quinns Road, an already-existing east-west road that directly linked Wanneroo Road to the coastal townsite of Quinns Rocks. It was named after Thomas Hester, an early settler and local land-owner in the area, whose name was also initially proposed for the adjoining suburb of Merriwa. The new alignment was first built in 1990 to coincide with the developments of Mindarie and Merriwa by Smith Corporation, running onto the original Quinns Road at the intersection of the future Connolly Drive. The portion of Quinns Road in between Marmion Avenue and Connolly Drive was then closed to general traffic and turned into a cul-de-sac in Merriwa, where it was renamed Palermo Court. Hester Avenue deviates south-westerly from the original Quinns Road from Connolly Drive onwards, where it runs directly into Mindarie. Quinns Road west of Marmion Avenue survives today as a local distributor road in Quinns Rocks, while the unaltered portion east of Connolly Drive now assumes the name Hester Avenue for its entire length. The road was built into a dual carriageway from Marmion Avenue to Hidden Valley Retreat, Clarkson, in 2003. In 2017 the Hester Avenue Bridge was demolished as part of the wider Mitchell Freeway Expansion. Main Roads have confirmed planning is underway for the extension of Mitchell Freeway from Hester Avenue to Romeo Road with works commencing in late 2020.

They are credited with investing considerable capital in religious institutions and charitable activities, as well as benefiting systems of patronage and considerable growth in cultural activities within the capital during this period. Family lineage The al-Jalili family traces their origins to the Diyarbakir Province. The first prominent Jalili, \\"Abdul Jalil\\" was a Christian employed in the Pasha’s household during the late seventeenth century. At this point the family had already established themselves firmly as notables within the Mosul elite, exerting both political and economic influence: Along with the al-Umari and Tasin al-Mufti families, the Jalilis formed an \\"urban-based small and medium gentry and a new landed elite\\", which proceeded to displace the control of previous rural tribes. Such families proceed to establish themselves through private enterprise, solidifying their influence and assets through rents on land and taxes on urban and rural manufacturing. Fortifying \\"a powerful political dynasty with the acquiescence of the central Ottoman government\\" families such as the Jalilis developed into ruling elites within a progressively stratified social hierarchy, leading to the development of increasingly exclusive breeding patterns and lineage. As Gertrude Bell recounted of one of the Jalilis during her travels through Iraq in 1910: Although the governing status of the Jalili family was curtailed by the Ottomans in 1834, in line with their breeding and integration within the Maslawi elite, the family still managed to maintain its influence both among the Maslawi people and the central Ottoman government framework. By the early 20th Century, the British still considered the Jalilis to be the \\"first family in Mosul,\\" albeit one that now \\"remained aloof from political or business circles.\\" Governorate of Mosul Development of Ottoman rule Although Mesopotamia had technically been integrated within the Ottoman Empire since 1533, when it was taken from the Safavids during the Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–55), until the reconquest of Baghdad in 1638 during the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639) the city of Mosul \\"was still a mere fortress, important for its strategic position as an offensive platform for Ottoman campaigns into Iraq, as well as a defensive stronghold and plaque tournante guarding the approaches to Anatolia and to the Syrian coast. Then with the Ottoman reconquest of Baghdad, the liwa’ of Mosul became an independent wilaya.\\" Despite being a part of the Ottoman Empire, during the four centuries of Ottoman rule Mosul was considered \\"the most independent district\\" within the Middle East, following the Roman model of indirect rule through local notables. \\"Mosuli culture developed less along Ottoman-Turkish lines than along Iraqi-Arab lines; and Turkish, the official language of the State, was certainly not the dominant language in the province.\\" In line with its status as a politically stable trade route between the Mediterranean and the Gulf the city developed considerably during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Similar to the development of the Mamluk dynasty in Baghdad, during this time \\"the Jalili family was establishing itself as the undisputed master of Mosul\\", and \\"helping to connect Mosul with a pre-Ottoman, pre-Turcoman, pre-Mongol, Arab cultural heritage which was to put the town on its way to recapturing some of the prestige and prominence it had enjoyed under the golden reign of Badr ad-Din Lu’lu’.\\" Jalili governors Appointed directly by the sultan to control the running of the province, the role of governor was the highest ruling authority within Ottoman Mosul. The governor was appointed with the rank of Paşa, and oversaw the extensive administrative framework required to ensure the continued development of local resources and trade, the collection of taxes and the provision of security within Mosul as well as key rural areas and villages surrounding the capital. By the mid-nineteenth century, the governor was in charge of a yearly budget of over four million piasters. Starting in 1726 with the appointment of Isma’il Pasha Jalili (the son of Abdul Jalil), the role of governor became almost exclusively that of the Jalilis until 1834, with governors including: # Isma’il Paşa: became first Jalili governor and contractor of provisions in 1726-7. # ‘Abdul Baqi ibn ‘Ubaid Aga Jalili: governor 1785-6, least popular of the Jalili governors. Descended from the ‘Ubaid Aga branch of the family, who were leaders of the janissaries. # Fattah Paşa Jalili: head of the Jalili household 1769-71, opposing the main household of the Hussein Paşa al-Jalili. # Hussein Paşa Jalili: first appointed to the office of governor in 1730. Reinstated seven times thereafter, until 1757-8. Major contractor on the eastern frontier. # Sa’dallah Paşa, son of Hussein Paşa: governor 1810-12. The Paşa who obtained his office by bribing Halet Efendi […]. # Hasan Paşa, son of Hussein Paşa: governor 1818. # Amin Paşa Jalili: first appointed in 1752. Reinstated five times until 1775. Served on the Russian front in the [Russo-Turkish War 1768–1774Turko-Russian war of 1768-74]. # Muhammad Paşa Jalili, son of Amin Paşa: his tenure, 1789-1806, was the longest continuous tenure of any Jalili governor. # Suleiman Paşa Jalili: first tenure as governor 1771-5. Reappointed three times after that. Last tenure in 1786-9. # ‘Abd al-Rahman Paşa, son of Abdallah Bey: governor 1821-2. # Mahmud Paşa, son of Muhammad Paşa: governor 1818-21. # Ahmad Paşa, son of Suleiman Paşa: governor 1812-17 and 1818-21. # Nu’man Paşa, son of Suleiman Paşa: governor 1806-8. # Abd al-Rahman Paşa, son of Mahmud Paşa: governor 1827-8. Shot dead by the rebels against Jalili rule. # Muhammad Amin Paşa, son of Uthman Beg Jalili: governor 1829. Successfully ousted by the rebels and their leader. Qasim Paşa, son of Hasan al-Umari then became governor. # Yahya Paşa, son of Nu’man Paşa: governor 1822-7. His rule marked the beginning of the end of Jalili rule. In 1826, sections of the city’s population, led by Qasim Umari rebelled.The genealogies of the Jalili and Umari families are based on . Ottoman centralization and end of Jalili governorate In the nineteenth century the Ottoman government started to reclaim central control over its outlying provinces. Their aim was to \\"restore Ottoman law, and rejuvenate the military\\" as well as reviving \\"a secure tax base for the government\\". Due to their social and economic influence, and the credibility they had secured with local constituents as indigenous Maslawi rulers who had reinvested substantial wealth back into the city's buildings and wider infrastructure, the Jalilis and other ruling elites were perceived by the central Ottoman government \\"as a threat to their interests\\". Consequently, the central Ottoman government proceeded to reassert their power by \\"neutraliz[ing] local families such as the Jalilis and their class.\\" In order to establish this process of neutralization in 1834 the practice of holding public elections for the position of governor was abolished, and the sultan began appointing new, non-Maslawi governors directly. As a result, new governors \\"would attain power and legitimacy not by their connections to the people of the city or their sponsorship of urban life and local economies, but exclusively from their appointments by the Ottoman Sultan.\\" This process started in 1834 with the appointment of Bayraktar Mehmet Pasha, who was to rule Mosul for the next four years. In line with its reintegration within central government rule, Mosul was required to conform to new Ottoman reform legislation, including the standardization of tariff rates, the consolidation of internal taxes and the integration of the administrative apparatus with the central government. Yet, despite their attempts to reclaim control over the Maslawi government apparatus, the city's most prominent families such as the Jalilis still retained significant influence \\"not only within local circles, but also within the central government apparatus.\\" After the reign of Bayraktar Mehmet Pasha, the Ottoman government (wishing still to restrain the influence of powerful local families) appointed a series of governors in rapid succession, ruling \\"for only a brief period before being sent somewhere else to govern, making it impossible for any of them to achieve a substantial local power base.\\" Without this power base, such Pashas remained dependent upon families such as the Jalilis to \\"intercede on their behalf\\" with local Maslawis in order for them to accomplish \\"even their most basic tasks of collecting taxes and providing security\\". Ironically, in \\"one of the last administrative changes of the reform era\\" in which proxy rule by appointed Pashas gave way to direct, centralized rule by Sultan Abdulhamid II, the deputies appointed to discharge Ottoman jurisdiction \\"once again hailed from traditional elite families in the city.\\" Socio-cultural developments in Jalili Mosul As stated by Percy Kemp, the rise to power of the Jalilis within Mosul led to a major shift in the religion, politics and culture of the capital: Included within this investment were \\"building projects, constructing schools, mosques, shops, and a large khan where merchants could stay [and] store their goods\\". This type of investment, designed not only to generate money on rents, but also to signify the family's \\"commitment to the city and its institutions\\" was not restricted to the Jalilis. Between 1700 and 1834, several other notable families involved in governing Mosul invested \\"large fortunes in public construction, building mosques, khans, markets, baths, and schools[, …] constructed at least 390 new shops [and] worked to create support in the city and to both display and legitimize their great wealth by their creation of new infrastructure\\". Education Education was a keystone for investment in Jalili Mosul, with over 20 schools offering \\"a wide spectrum of courses ranging from Coranic exegesis to arithmetic and from grammar to astronomy.\\" The establishment of new schools and mosques, and the reputation of its educators broadened Mosul's influence and eminence: Religion In Jalili Mosul religion played both a major role in education, and served as a significant nucleus for social tension. Mosul was populated by a significant diversity of religions, highlighted by the Jalilis themselves: an historically Christian family, who ruled on behalf of a Muslim Turkish sultan, in a predominantly Sunni Arabic city. Muslim beliefs within Mosul were heavily entrenched in the Sufic tradition: In line with this tradition arose a fundamentalist Sufic movement which affected both the people and the ruling elite, leading to several prominent figures (including Uthman Bey b. Sulaiman Pasha Jalili) publicly emphasizing their sufic identities and calling for the \\"purification of the religious experience under attack from the many abuses and superstitions which tarnished its image\\". Cultural production As well as religious tracts, Jalili Mosul was home to the widespread discussion of philosophy, history and literature, the recitation and creation of poetry, and the in-depth \\"study of language, philology and literary criticism, presented in numerous short treatises as well as in encyclopedic works dealing with allegory, metaphor, metonymy, rhetoric, grammar, syntax etc.\\". Over 20 historical works can be dated to Jalili Mosul, including \\"dynastic histories, annalistic histories, biographical dictionaries, hagiographies, regional histories and contemporary chronicles.\\" Generally, cultural activity centered around two key areas. Firstly, the coffee-houses (which numbered over 120 in Mosul), in which Janissary leaders would sit and liaise with royal envoys and elite families, form political alliances and trade contracts, and recite poetry and mawawil. Secondly, and most importantly, the majlis of the prince or notable in which \\"friends and clients assembled to listen to poetry and music\\". Indeed, in line with this cultural backdrop, poetry became by far the most prominent and widespread literary genre: Defence of Mosul against Nadir Shah In 1743 Maslawi forces, raised, organized and led by Hussein Pasha al- Jalili defeated the invasion of the Persian army of Nadir Shah. The event has been labeled as one of the most important events in 18th Century Middle Eastern history, not only due to its status as the only retreat suffered by the great Persian conqueror at the hands of his Ottoman adversaries, but as a defeat inflicted not by an Ottoman imperial army commanded by an Ottoman general, but by provincial forces. The invasion was part of an ongoing dispute between the Ottomans and the Persians over the possession of the area, which extended from the Ottomans’ first conquering of Mosul in 1515. Although in 1555 the Ottomans and Safavids signed the Treaty of Zuhab (or Qasr’i Shirin) in 1639, a peace accord based on accepting the legitimacy of each other's empires, in 1732 Nadir Shah launched a new initiative to reconquer Iraq, leading to four separate invasions between 1732 and 1743. Hussein Pasha al- Jalili's success in repelling Nadir Shah’s forces in 1743 helped lead to the conclusion of this initiative.

Barrack has been a close friend and ally of President Donald Trump and has represented Trump on television news segments.https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/19/donald- trump-cuts-off-tom-barrack-1467191 He also served as the chairman of the Presidential Inaugural Committee and was senior adviser to Trump's presidential campaign. Early life Barrack's grandparents were Lebanese Christians who immigrated in 1900 to the United States from Zahlé, Lebanon. Barrack was raised in Culver City, California, where his father was a grocer and his mother was a secretary.  Education  In 1969, Barrack graduated with a B.A. degree from the University of Southern California, where he participated on their varsity rugby team. Barrack then attended the USC Gould School of Law, where he was an editor of the Southern California Law Review, before receiving his J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law in 1972. Career His first job was at the law firm of Herbert W. Kalmbach, President Richard Nixon's personal lawyer. In 1972 the firm sent him to Saudi Arabia, where he soon became the squash partner of a Saudi prince. He then worked in the kingdom for the Fluor Corporation, and worked for Saudi princes. Shortly after, he helped open diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Haiti, then ruled by Jean-Claude Duvalier, at the request of investor Lonnie Dunn. In 1982, Barrack served as Deputy Undersecretary of the United States Department of the Interior under James G. Watt in the Reagan administration. The Secret Service would board its horses at Barrack's ranch when President Reagan was at his nearby Rancho del Cielo. Secretary Watt made his resignation announcement at Barrack's ranch. Barrack says he became disillusioned with government service after he was required to testify before a congressional committee due to a gift Barrack had paid to the purchaser of Edwin Meese's house. In 1987, Barrack was later a principal with the Robert M. Bass Group. In 1985, Barrack first dealt with Donald Trump when he sold Trump a one-fifth stake in the Alexander's department stores. In 1988, Trump agreed to pay Barrack $410 million for total ownership of the Plaza Hotel. He later lost both properties in bankruptcy. In 1990, Barrack founded Colony Capital, with initial investments by Bass and GE Capital, and later Eli Broad, Merrill Lynch, and Koo Chen-fu. Barrack achieved 50% profits in his first two years by focusing on distressed properties, including the federal Resolution Trust Corporation. He has invested some $200 million in Middle East real estate, $534 million in non-performing German real estate loans, and made a $24 million loan to photographer Annie Leibovitz. He also owns the Neverland Ranch. Through Colony Capital, he runs a $25 billion portfolio of assets, from the Fairmont Raffles Hotels International hotel chain in Asia, the Aga Khan's former resort in Sardinia, Resorts International Holdings, One&Only; Resorts, Atlantis, etc. Colony American Homes was criticised for treating tenants poorly during the Great Recession, raising rents, evicting people in large numbers and failing to maintain properties. Barrack has previously negotiated drilling rights with Mana Al Otaiba. In 2009, Barrack negotiated with his son, Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba, the sale of a $41 million stake in the Raffles L'Ermitage hotel to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. In 2010, Barrack bought $70 million of Jared Kushner's debt on 666 Fifth Avenue. Kushner later avoided bankruptcy when Barrack agreed to reduce his obligations after a request by Trump. As of September 2011, Barrack was the 833rd richest person in the world, and the 375th richest in the United States, with an estimated wealth of US$1.1. billion. However, he was no longer a billionaire in 2014. In 2012, Barrack sold the Paris Saint-Germain F.C. to the Qatar Investment Authority. Barrack had to pay €22 million to settle tax charges related to the 2012 sale of his resort on Costa Smeralda to the Qatari sovereign wealth fund. In 2010, Barrack partnered with the Qatar Investment authority to purchase Weinstein film production company Miramax for $660 million. In 2016, Barrack sold Miramax to the Qatari beIN Media Group at a fourfold profit. In October 2017, Barrack's Colony Capital agreed to invest in The Weinstein Company to keep it afloat in light of the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct allegations. The New York Times reported that the preliminary agreement with Weinstein fell apart and the acquisition broke down. Colony Capital later withdrew from the deal after being unable to structure the purchase in a way to avoid enriching Harvey Weinstein. Colony NorthStar Merger On June 3, 2016, Barrack’s Colony Capital announced an all-stock three-way merger of equals with two NorthStar affiliates combining his firm with NorthStar Realty Finance and NorthStar Asset Management. The new entity, renamed Colony NorthStar, would have managed $58BN in assets, making it the 5th largest real estate manager globally at that time. Management disclosed in regulatory filings that the newly formed Colony NorthStar would have a pro-forma equity market capitalization of $7 billion and total capitalization of $17 billion. On February 28, 2017 management gave full year guidance which estimated that core funds from operations (\\"FFO\\") would be between $1.40 – 1.58 per share while targeting dividends payments of $1.08 per share. However, FINRA and NASD had just passed legislation modifying fee disclosures for REITs. The new legislation forced Colony NorthStar to disclose details regarding the fees it charged clients. The success of the merger relied on fees the company expected to earn from newly raised capital. In particular, retail management fees from Investment Management companies NorthStar/RXR NY Metro Real Estate and NorthStar Real Estate Capital Income Fund, which were raising a combined $5.2 billion, had been discussed throughout management presentations of the merger. The new legislation complicated Colony Capital ability to grow its capital fundraising business as clients balked at fee levels once FINRA/NASD passed the new disclosure rules. On March 1, 2018, management delivered 2017 full year financials which were significantly below previous guidance highlighting the difficulty in its fundraising business . Colony NorthStar not only reported core FFO at $1.16 per share, or 22% below previous midpoint management guidance, but also announced that it would cut its dividend by 60% to $0.44 per share and write down the Investment Management by $375 million. Upon announcement, the share price dropped 23% to close at $6.00 per share leaving the company with a market capitalization of approximately $3.2 billion, or a third of its pro-forma capitalization. On of March 10, 2020, Colony Capital's share price closed at $3.41 giving the company a market capitalization of approximately $1.7 billion. Other In 2017, Barrack sold a $70 million stake in One California Plaza to the Abu Dhabi crown prince's investment fund. During the first eighteen months of the Trump Administration, Colony NorthStar raised 24% of its $7 billion in investment from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) or Saudi Arabia. Barrack used Cayman Islands entities to invest pension fund money in distressed real estate and send money towards the Colony parent company, according to an organization chart that surfaced in the Paradise Papers documents leaked from the Appleby law firm Barrack is a trustee at the University of Southern California. He has also served on the board of directors of Accor, Kerzner International, First Republic Bank, Continental Airlines, Korea First Bank, and Megaworld Properties & Holdings. French president Nicolas Sarkozy awarded him France's Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur. Political activity Barrack endorsed Donald Trump during the 2016 United States presidential election. He was a major fundraiser for Trump's campaign through the \\"Rebuilding America Now\\" Super PAC, which raised $23 million. Barrack recommended that Trump hire Paul Manafort as his campaign manager. Barrack first met Manafort in the 1970s when they were both working for Saudis and living in Beirut; In 2007, Barrack had loaned Manafort $1.5 million to refinance a home in the Hamptons. On April 26, 2016, Barrack began an email correspondence with one of his business partners, UAE Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba, reassuring him that Trump had investments in the UAE. “The emails were the beginning of Mr. Trump’s improbable transformation from a candidate who campaigned against Muslims to a president celebrated in the royal courts of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,” according to New York Times writer David D. Kirkpatrick, who characterized this as a testament to Barrack’s \\"unique place in the Trump world\\". On May 26, Barrack wrote to Otaiba to introduce Jared Kushner, and the two met later that month. On July 13, Barrack conveyed to Otaiba that Trump had removed from the Republican Party platform the plank calling for the release of the 28 pages of redacted information from the 9/11 report. On July 21, Barrack spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention.Tim Tebow: Speaking slot at Trump convention 'a rumor', Associated Press (July 14, 2016). In September 2016, Barrack helped set up a meeting between Trump and the Emir of Qatar in Trump Tower, although, as Kilpatrick noted, none of the investments brought in from the gulf by Mr. Barrack's firm in the two years following that meeting came from Qatar. After Trump became president, Barrack continued to act as a middleman between him and Arab princes. Barrack served as chairman of the committee overseeing the 2017 Trump inauguration, for which he raised over $100 million, doubling the previous record. Barrack hired Rick Gates, first to help run the inauguration and, following that, as a consultant for his company. Gates was fired from the latter position in October 2017, the day he was indicted. In a 2017 Washington Post article, Barrack commented on Trump's inflammatory rhetoric and proposals to ban immigrants from certain Muslim countries and put up a border wall with Mexico. \\"He's better than this,\\" he said. He denies a quote attributed to him in the 2018 book Fire and Fury, that Trump was \\"not only crazy\\" but \\"stupid\\". Barrack was interviewed during the Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, in particular regarding Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Konstantin Kilimnik, Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign, the Trump transition team, and the financing of the Trump inauguration. In May 2019, it was reported that the Eastern District of New York had \\"raised questions\\" about inaugural committee donations, including committee chairman Barrack's ties to the Middle East. Throughout the election campaign, transition period and inauguration process, Mr. Barrack is said to have had been in touch with people having ties in the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates, including Rashid al-Malik, a friend and business associate of Barrack and Yousef al- Otaiba UAE's ambassador to the US. According to The New York Times report published in July 2019, Mr. Barrack also exchanged emails with Mr. al-Malik, sharing with him a draft of Trump's energy policy speech to seek approval on the 'pro-gulf region language'. Mr. al-Malik, as per the emails, \\"circulated the draft among Emirati and Saudi officials\\" to seek further approval, followed by Mr. Barrack incorporating the language suggested by Mr. al-Malik in the draft sent to Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman at the time. Personal life Barrack is divorced since 2016, and he has six children. His family is based in Los Angeles, California. He also owns a 1,200-acre mountain ranch near Santa Barbara, California. He owns Happy Canyon Vineyards in the Santa Ynez Valley appellation of Happy Canyon and a tasting room in downtown Santa Barbara California. He is Roman Catholic. In 2014, Barrack bought a house in Santa Monica for $21 million, which he later sold for $35 million, the highest price for a residence in that area. In 2017, he purchased a $15.5 million home in Aspen, Colorado.

Career and research  Bennett studied at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, before completing an MA and PhD in Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto. She was awarded her doctorate in 1981. She subsequently worked at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1981 to 2005, before moving to the University of Southern California. She has published extensively on the history of late medieval England, particularly on the history of women and feminist approaches to medieval history. She has authored and edited nine books and over 30 articles and chapters on medieval women, women's work, and feminist history, as well as widely used medieval history text, Medieval Europe: A Short History (McGraw Hill). Her 1996 book Ale, Beer, and Brewsters in England: Women's Work in a Changing World, 1300-1600 is still one of a few to look at the transition of brewing from women to men. In her influential 2006 book, History Matters: Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism, Bennett argued for the importance of feminist approaches to history and the role of longue durée perspectives in understanding the 'patriarchal equilibrium' that has defined the history of women's experiences over multiple historical periods. This 'patriarchal equilibrium' is characterised by Bennett as a lack of transformation in women's status in comparison to that of men, despite changes over time.

It was built between 1836 and 1839 as part of an attempt by the Norwich Yarn Company (established 1833 by Samuel Bignold) to prevent the collapse of the local textile trade. The architect was John Brown. The site was occupied by the White Friars (Carmelites) in the 13th century, and an original arch and undercroft survive. When the local textile trade went into further decline, St James Mill was bought by Jarrold & Sons Ltd for use by its printing department in 1902. The building was subsequently leased to Caley's, the chocolate manufacturer, and sold to the government as a training factory for war veterans in 1920. Jarrolds bought back the mill in 1933 and today it is a private office complex. Among the organisations based there are Virgin Wines and Norfolk Community Foundation.

History The two schools first met on October 18, 1924. The Eagles and Orange played annually from 1971 to 2004. To date, Boston College and Syracuse have played each other 50 times. Aside from Holy Cross, no team has played Boston College more than Syracuse. Syracuse leads the series 31–21. Boston College and Syracuse were founding members of the Big East Conference, first as a basketball conference in 1979, then a football conference in 1991. To start the 2005 season, Boston College left the Big East to become the 12th member of the ACC. The future of the rivalry was in doubt. The Eagles and Orange signed a deal to play a non-conference game through 2021. The Eagles won the 2010 meeting 16–7. In September 2011, the ACC announced that they had accepted bids from Syracuse and Pitt to become the 13th and 14th members of the ACC. It was later determined that Syracuse and Pitt would join the ACC in July 2013. Game results Memorable games In 2004, Boston College was in first place in the Big East and needed a win against then 5–5 Syracuse in the regular season finale to clinch their first BCS bowl berth. With Syracuse's two RB's out with injuries, DB Diamond Ferri filled in as RB. Ferri rushed for 141 yards and 2 TDs. Ferri also had a 44-yard interception return for a TD. Syracuse went on to pull off the shocking blowout upset, winning 43–17. This game was also the first career start by Boston College QB Matt Ryan; he was filling in for the injured Paul Peterson. This was BC's final game as a member of the Big East; they began playing in the ACC in 2005. In 2013, Syracuse was playing in their first year as a member of the ACC. Syracuse was 5–6 heading into the final game of the season against Boston College, needing to win to become bowl-eligible. Boston College was up 31–27 with 2:08 left when Syracuse drove down the field and scored the game-winning touchdown with 6 seconds left. The 2018 season was a historic year for both Boston College and Syracuse with the former earning a ranking in the AP poll for the first time since 2008, and the latter the first AP ranking since 2001. About three quarters way through the season, it looked like this could be the year that the Boston College-Syracuse matchup featured two ranked teams. BC was ranked as high as #17 in week 10 but a loss to #2 ranked Clemson dropped them 3 spots in the rankings, and then an upset defeat at the hands of a reeling Florida State team the following week pushed them out of the top 25 entirely. Likewise, in week 11, Syracuse was pummeled 36-3 by #3 Notre Dame and lost their starting quarterback, dropping them down from a peak at #12 to #20.

Since 1970 it has been used as a museum ship. The Dresden was built in 1956/57 at the Warnow Shipyard. It was the fifth Type IV ship in the first batch of 10,000 tonne piece-goods freighters that were built in East Germany's shipyards after the Second World War. Because the first ship of this series was christened Frieden (commissioned in June 1957), the other ships of this series of 15 new vessels were classed as Frieden type merchant ships. On 27 July 1958 the ship was handed over to the Deutsche Seereederei shipping line and it operated until 1969 on scheduled services to East Asia, Indonesia, Africa, India and Latin America. After some serious defects that were found in the engine room that would have resulted in excessive repair costs, the ship was decommissioned in 1969 and opened on 13 June 1970 as the \\"Rostock Shipbuilding Museum\\" (Schiffbaumuseum Rostock). Part of the ship also acted as a youth hostel for a time. Today it is part of the Rostock Shipbuilding and Shipping Museum (Rostocker Schiffbau- und Schifffahrtsmuseum) in the IGA Park and contains comprehensive exhibitions of shipbuilding history. Topics include Shipbuilding in East Germany, Shipyard Operations, the History of Maritime Radio Communications and Navigation. In addition, there is a collection of various types of ship engine. Many areas of the ship have been preserved in their original state (the engine room, bridge, radio station, ship's hospital and crew cabins) and give an impression of life on a merchant ship in the 1950/60s. The Rostock City Harbour Museum Ship action group (Traditionsschiff Stadthafen Rostock) is advocating moving the shipyard and shipping museum to a central and easily accessible site in the centre of Rostock. Low visitor numbers have been cited as the reason for this initiative.

It was a metre-gauge track that was converted to Broad Gauge in 2011. Another railway line with a slightly different route with shorter distance exists between Siliguri Junction and Aluabari Road Junction (Islampur) and its details are available in Howrah–New Jalpaiguri line article. History Early developments Railway developments in the area started in the 1880s. East Indian Railway Company opened the Manihari-Katihar-Kasba section in 1888 and the North Bengal Railway opened the Katihar-Raiganj section the same year. The Barsoi- Kishanganj section opened in 1889. All these lines were metre gauge lines. Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, operating narrow gauge lines, extended their operations from Siliguri to Kishenganj in 1915. Siliguri was connected to Calcutta (now spelt as Kolkata) via the eastern part of Bengal since 1878 (for details see Howrah-New Jalpaiguri Line). However, with the partition of India in 1947, railway services in the region were completely disrupted. In 1949, the narrow gauge Siliguri-Kishanganj section was upgraded to metre gauge. Thus there was a direct metre gauge connection from Manihari to Siliguri via Katihar. A generally acceptable route to Siliguri was via Sahibganj Loop to Sakrigali ghat. Across the Ganges by ferry to Manihari Ghat. Then metre gauge via Katihar and Barsoi to Kishanganj and finally narrow gauge to Sliguri, before Kishanganj-Siliguri was converted to metre gauge. This, therefore, remains a historic route, even though for a short period. Surviviving as a metre gauge line in the broad gauge era In the sixties, new broad gauge lines were laid in the area and in 1971 with the rail bridge over Farakka Barrage, Siliguri was once again directly connected with Calcutta (now spelt as Kolkata) by broad gauge track. A section of the broad gauge line from Mukuria to Aluabari Road ran alongside the metre gauge line. The metre gauge line survived for many years until 2011. An Indian Railways Fan Club enthusiast reported (in June 2005): \\"Near Siliguri, a MG line emerges to the right, on a somewhat high embankment and continues to run parallel to the road. This is the Siliguri-Kishanganj-Katihar MG line which still exists. Bagdogra is a station on this line, in fact the airport's runway almost ends within station limits! Both road and rail curve northwards but then diverge with the road crossing over the railway tracks. This overpass is above the Siliguri-New Mal Junction-Alipurduar Junction-Samuktala Road line and the DHR. The former was MG in 2000 and is BG now.\\" Gauge conversion The Siliguri- Katihar line was the last surviving metre gauge line in the area. The Aluabari Road-Katihar section already had a broad gauge line running alongside the metre gauge line. The Aluabari Road-Siliguri section needed to be converted. Conversion work was taken up in 2008, train services in the section was suspended and conversion work completed early in 2011.

It flows into the Philippine Sea and the Pacific Ocean at Barangay Talisay, Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur. It is found between the boundaries of Barangays of Talisay and Cambatong. It earned the moniker \\"enchanted river\\" from the diplomat Modesto Farolan who described the river in his poem entitled \\"Rio Encantado\\".  Geography  Hinatuan Bay, which is the habitat of various species of turtles, is located at its mouth. Its mouth also offers a safe anchorage against storms and typhoons.  Exploration  The first exploration to the cave of the Hinatuan Enchanted River was made by Alex Santos in 1999. The major exploration to the cave system started eleven years later when a group of three cave divers led by Dr. Alfonso Amores with team members Bernil Gastardo and Emgee Guillermo entered the cave in February 2010. The major exploration led to the discovery of a hidden cave opening at depth. Succeeding expeditions have been made that led to the discovery of the underwater cave's chamber. During its sixth expedition on June 17, 2014, Dr. Amores perished after failing to exit the narrow entrance to the cave due to a cardiac arrest at depth inside the narrow tunnel to the Mayor's Chamber of the cave in the Hinatuan Enchanted River. Explorations have continued in March 2015 aiming to discover its unexplored area beyond its depth and is now led by Bernil Gastardo under contract with GIZ, University of San Carlos-Biology Department, and DENR-BMB under the project Hinatuan Enchanted River Underwater Cave System Rapid Source Assessment (HERUCS). Beginning on March 20, a collaborative 5-day assessment and mapping of the ecosystem was conducted by the University of San Carlos and the Filipino Cave Divers (FCD).  Legends  The river's unusual colors and unexplored depths have inspired various local legends. One story tells of fairies that added the colors of sapphire and jade to the river to make its unique shade. Local fisherfolk also report seeing fish in the river that cannot be caught through any means. According to locals, the river was called the Enchanted River because of the engkantos that dwell there. Their legends also say that the river is haunted by supernatural beings which act as its protectors.  Preservation  Since 2017, the local government of Hinatuan prohibits tourists from swimming on the main pool due to preservation and maintenance. However, they still designated a swimming area for tourists near the center of the lagoon which is away from the main pool. Daily fish feeding schedule was also changed from 12 noon to 3 in the afternoon. This is done by playing the \\"Hymn of Hinatuan\\".

Additionally, a 4.5-kilometre route from Taksin Bridge to Nong Khaem district is also expected to begin service within two years. =High-speed train route= Abhisit emphasized that high-speed trains would not only facilitate the rapid movement of goods and people, but would provide even more benefits to Thailand once ASEAN becomes a single market and Thailand becomes a stronger production base for the economic community. As Asian economies look more towards regional rather than Western trade for future growth, it's a forward-looking plan with the potential to position Thailand as a highly efficient regional hub connecting China to Southeast Asia. The project will have two phases: from Nong Khai in the northeast to Bangkok, from Bangkok to Rayong, and from Bangkok to Padang Besar, on the border with Malaysia. The transnational line will start from Kunming in China's southwestern Yunnan province and run south to Thailand through Laos and Vietnam. The entire project, from Nong Khai to Bangkok and Rayong, and from Bangkok to Padang Besar, will cost almost 350 billion baht. The railway tracks will be built parallel with existing tracks, but with a wider gauge of 1.4 metres, instead of the current gauge of 1 metre. The Nong Khai-Bangkok route says it will cover a total distance of 615 kilometres. The track will run through a tunnel of about 10 km and will be elevated over a distance of 59 km. The high-speed train will travel at no less than 200 kilometres per hour. It will be electrically powered, and studies have shown that existing power supplies will be sufficient. Once this project has been completed, travelling by train from Bangkok to Kunming will take around five hours, three hours from Bangkok to Vientiane, and less than five hours from Bangkok to Padang Basar.The Nation, , 8 September 2010Asia News Network, , 1 September 2010 =Airport link= Abhisit's administration completed the Airport Link project that was delayed by the previous government due to several factors. Suvarnabhumi Airport's Link, which connects downtown Bangkok and Suvarnabhumi airport, began commercial services on 23 August 2010. The Airport Link's City Line will run every 15 minutes and the Express Line every 30 minutes. Both lines operate from 06:00 to midnight. The trains have a maximum speed of 160 kilometres per hour. The City Line will make eight stops across the capital, starting at Phaya Thai, before heading to the airport. The trains take 30 minutes from Phaya Thai to Suvarnabhumi.Bangkok Airport Train, , 23 August 2010 Information and communications technology Abhisit's information and communications technology (ICT) policy included censorship of Internet sites the government considered offensive to the monarchy. Abhisit's ICT minister, Ranongruk Suwunchwee, met with officials of TOT and CAT (both state-owned telecommunications firms) in 2009 to inform them of the policy. Ranongruk said 45 million baht was spent on a war room where government staff worked around the clock to block access to certain websites in Thailand. By September 2009, more than 17,000 \\"offensive\\" websites were blocked.Bangkok Post, Last One in Again, 6 Jan 2019 An auction for 3G 2.1 gigahertz spectrum licenses organized by the National Telecommunications Commission was cancelled after state-owned firms CAT Telecom and TOT successfully filed an injunction which claimed that the NTC lacked the authority to organize the auction.

On one hand, the media can be used to provide useful information; on the other hand, it can be used to increase the popularity of the government. And this is why there arises the debate about whether the government is justified to use mass communication, and to what extent.The Nation, Why is the military educating us about democracy? , 3 July 2009 Defense Abhisit's government approved military budgets of 170 billion baht in 2011 and 154 billion baht in 2010.

In just a two-month period in 2010, Amnesty International received eight reports of torture. \\"The security forces continue to use torture even though senior commanders claim to have prohibited it,\\" found Brussels-based International Crisis Group. Common methods of torture allegedly used by the army, many of which occurred at the Ingkhayutthabariharn Reconciliation Promotion Center, included severe beatings, suffocation with plastic bags, electric shocks, forced nudity, exposure to extreme cold or heat, needles inserted into open wounds, and holding detainees' family members hostage, including, in one case, a 6-year- old boy.Time, Is the Thai Military Torturing Detainees?, 1 December 2010 Abhisit personally denied the torture allegations and questioned the accuracy of Amnesty International's claims.

The deadline for compliance, initially 28 February 2010, was extended to 2 March after several hundred thousand migrants failed to appear. Although migrant labor from Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and elsewhere make up 5–10% of Thailand's work force, migrants are critical in keeping Thailand's wages competitive with China. Human-rights groups noted that migrants have plenty of reasons to fear declaring themselves, including a history of past mistreatment, including bribery, rape, and arbitrary arrest by Thai authorities. Other migrant workers worry that information about their activities will be shared with their home governments, exposing them or their families to harassment.Wall Street Journal, Bangkok Under Fire on Immigration Policy, 2 March 2010 =Rohingya refugees= In January 2009, CNN investigations revealed that up to 1,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar had been captured by the Thai Navy, beaten, then towed out to sea without engines or navigational aids and with little food and water. Abhisit's initial response was to claim that the media reports were \\"exaggerated\\" and that the refugees would \\"sail on boats without engines or sink their ships so that authorities help them to get onshore.\\" Army Commander Anupong Paojinda denied the reports of abuse.Bangkok Post, , 20 January 2009 On 20 January, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) requested that the Thai government provide them access to the 126 surviving boat people in their custody.The Nation, , 21 January 2009 Abhisit said he was \\"glad to work with international organisations\\" but that such organizations would have to work on a cooperative basis with proper Thai government procedures.

He was named President of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See (APSA) on 26 June 2018. He was the Secretary-General of the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI) from 30 December 2013 to 26 June 2018 and Bishop of Cassano all'Jonio from 2012 to 2015. Biography Galantino was born in Cerignola, Italy, in 1948. He received a theology degree after studying from 1968 to 1972 at the Pontifical Regional Seminary of Benevento, Campania, and was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Ascoli Satriano e Cerignola on 23 December 1972. He earned a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Bari in 1974. From 1972 to 1977 he was Vice-Rector of the Seminary of Foggia, Italy, and Assistant of Catholic Action. In 1974 he became the Professor at the Pontifical Regional Seminary of Benevento, a post he held until 1972. From 1977 he was a priest at the parish of Saint Francis of Assisi in Cerignola. In that time he held the offices of Episcopal Vicar for Pastoral Care and for Culture and Continuing Education. From 1977 he was Professor of Anthropology at the Faculty of Theology for Southern Italy. In 2004 he became Head of National Service for the Higher Study of Theology and Religious Science at the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI). On 9 December 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him bishop of Cassano all'Jonio. He was consecrated on 25 February 2012 in the Cathedral of St. Peter the Apostle in Cerignola by Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco. He chose as his motto Inclina cor meum in testimonia tua (Bend my heart to your instructions; Psalms 119:36). On that occasion, he asked that money ordinarily spent on gifts for him should be spent on services for the poor. While bishop he lived at the seminary rather than in the bishop's palace and eschewed the services of a secretary and chauffeur. He asked to be called \\"Don Nunzio\\" instead of the customary title \\"Your Excellency.\\" On 30 December 2013, Pope Francis named him interim Secretary General of the CEI, Pope Francis wrote to the people of Galantino's diocese to \\"ask permission\\" to give their bishop this assignment, saying: \\"I ask you to understand and to forgive me\\". Rather than leave his diocese, Gallantino asked to be allowed to divide his time between his new post and his duties as bishop. Corriere della Sera described Galantino's appointment as the selection of someone who had not sought the appointment and said it represented a break with recent popes' political approach to the CEI, reflected Francis' emphasis on pastoral activity, and signaled his expectations for the next president of the CEI. Longtime Vatican observer John L. Allen later described the appointment as indicative of Pope Francis' management style, putting his own person in place without removing the head of the CEI and \\"making it so clear that [Galantino] enjoys his favor that everyone understands he's the real papal point of reference in the Italian episcopacy\\". On 26 March 2014, Pope Francis appointed Galantino to a full term as secretary-general. In May 2014, in an interview about preparations for the Synod on the Family in October 2014, Bishop Galantino told the Florence-based La Nazione newspaper that he wanted church leaders to open their minds to different views: \\"My wish for the Italian Church is that it is able to listen without any taboo to the arguments in favour of married priests, the Eucharist for the divorced, and homosexuality.\\" He said that \\"In the past we have concentrated too much on abortion and euthanasia. It mustn't be this way because in the middle there's real life which is constantly changing. I don't identify with the expressionless person who stands outside the abortion clinic reciting their rosary, but with young people, who are still against this practice, but are instead fighting for quality of life, their health, their right to work.\\" In August 2014, he said the Church must make everyone feel at home, that \\"Couples in irregular matrimonial situations are also Christians, but they are sometimes looked upon with prejudice. The burden of exclusion from the Sacraments is an unjustified price to pay, in addition to de facto discrimination\\". He did not advocate allowing divorced Catholics who remarried to receive Communion, but said that \\"pastoral charity which for people facing marriage and family difficulties means acceptance, understanding, accompanying and support\\".

See Jacques Stroumsa, Violinist in Auschwitz: From Salonica to Jerusalem, 1913-1967 (Constance: Hartung-Gorre Verlag, 1996), originally written in French: Tu choisiras la vie: violoniste a Quachwitz (Paris: Le Cerf, 1998). Stroumsa grew up in Paris. He studied at the Lycée Voltaire and at the Ecole Normale Israélite Orientale, where he was greatly influenced by its principal, Emmanuel Levinas, who taught him philosophy and Talmud. After briefly studying economics and law at the University of Paris, he moved to Israel. For his B.A. (1969), he studied philosophy and Jewish thought at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. After his military service (1969–1972), he studied for the PhD in the Study of Religion at Harvard University. After the submission of his doctoral dissertation (1978) which dealt with Gnostic mythology, he was appointed a lecturer in the Department of Comparative Religion at the Hebrew University. In 1991 he was appointed to the Martin Buber Chair of Comparative Religion. Stroumsa was the Founding Director of the Center for the Study of Christianity (1999–2005). In 2009 he was appointed Professor of the Study of the Abrahamic Religions at Oxford University and a Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall; he retired in 2013.

They have two daughters. Simon Rocker (May 27, 2010), The Israeli who's taken Abraham to Oxford, The Jewish Chronicle online Research Guy Stroumsa's research focuses on the dynamics of encounters between religious traditions and institutions in the Roman Empire and in Late Antiquity, in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. He has studied the crystallization of the Abrahamic traditions in late antiquity, as a background to Islam. He sees Gnosis, Manichaeism and Early Christianity as a unique laboratory for understanding religious transformations in late antiquity. In his doctoral dissertation, Stroumsa studied the development of Gnostic mythology, and demonstrated its roots in Judaism and biblical interpretation. In his studies, Stroumsa seeks to cross traditional interdisciplinary boundaries in order to study religious phenomena from a comparative perspective. This approach permits him to understand the mechanisms behind the religious revolution of Late Antiquity, a period which saw the cessation of a number of widespread aspects of ancient religion (such as blood sacrifice) and the development of new systems, which stand at the basis of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. See Guy G. Stroumsa, \\"From Abraham's Religion to the Abrahamic Religions,\\" in Historia Religionum, an International Journal 3 (2011), pages 11-22. Stroumsa also works on the history of scholarship on religion, from early modern times to the twentieth century. Stroumsa is the author of fourteen books, and the editor or co-editor of some twenty books.

It first appeared in public at HeliRussia 2009 and was also seen at MAKS-09 and HeliRussia in May 2010, though it was still unflown. It retains many of the features of the fixed wing MAI-223, having a three-blade tractor propeller driven by a Rotax 912 flat-four piston engine. The two aircraft share most of the fuselage, including its cabin, side by side seating and large, glazed side doors as well as the conventional undercarriage with its fuselage-mounted, rear leaning legs. The autogyro's two-blade rotor is mounted on a mast largely within a wide chord fairing, though with a significant part exposed below the rotor head. The other differences are in the empennage; the MAI-208 has a straight edged, slightly tapered tailplane and elevators with a cutout for rudder movement but the swept vertical surface of the MAI-223 was replaced by a small triangular fin carrying an almost semicircular rudder. By HeliRussia 2010 this had been reworked, with a wider chord, round topped rudder and a long fin/fillet with an almost horizontal upper edge.

Origins of the name The name is derived from the Anglo-Saxon \\"bulluca\\", meaning a young bull, and is linked to the old Anglian and Norman Christian name Osmund. It represents one of the earliest instances of an English hereditary surname that was a purely personal nickname in origin.Bullock, Llewellyn C W, Memoirs of the Bullock Family, A J Lawrence 1905Bullock, Osmund, Faulkbourne and the Bullocks, 2005 Coat of arms and motto Bullock arms 1602 Arms – Bullock quartering Watson 1810 The first heraldic record in Berkshire, 1532, gives the arms of Thomas Bullock of Aborfield as: *arms: gules, a chevron between three bull's heads cabossed argent, armed or. *crest: on a wreath argent and azure, a wolf statant sable, charged with three estoiles or. In Harvey’s Visitation to Berkshire of 1565–1566, the crest had been changed to: *seven bills, the staves gules, the blades sable, encircled by a wreath alternately argent and gules. The confirmation of arms of Sir Edward Bullock in 1602 changed the chevron from argent to ermine, and the crest became: *on a wreath argent and gules, five black bills, staves proper, heads sable, encircled by a band gules. The motto reads: nil conscire sibi – to have nothing on one's conscience. Notable family members Notable members of the family include: *Robert Bullock (d. 1405), Sheriff for the Counties of Berkshire and Oxfordshire * Thomas Bullock (d.1588), landowner, Gentleman Usher Extraordinary to Henry VIII and Commissioner for Berkshire *Sir Edward Bullock, landowner (c. 1580-1644) *Edward Bullock (1663-1705), politician and High Sheriff of Essex *Col.

Bullocks of Arborfield The earliest recorded member of the family is Osemundus Bulloc at Arborfield, Berkshire, who is found in the pipe rolls of Berkshire in 1166. The Herald's visitations of the 15th century include the name of his son, Richard. These and later visitations show the descent in an unbroken line to Sir Edward Bullock of Faulkbourne, Essex, who died in 1644. Richard’s son, Gilbert, made formal declaration in 1250 of his holding of the manor of Sunning from the Bishop of Salisbury. Robert Bullock of Aborfield was Knight of the Shire for Berkshire (1382) and Sheriff for the Counties of Berkshire and Oxfordshire in 1384 and 1392 under Richard II. In 1394 he was Commissioner of the Peace for Berkshire. Hehad no male issue, so the Aborfield estates passed Thomas Bullock, the grandson of his uncle Gilbert. Another Thomas was Gentleman Usher Extraordinary to Henry VIII in 1516 and one of the Commissioners for Berkshire collecting the subsidy for Henry VIII in 1523. In 1544 he supplied archers, billmen and horses for the war with France, leading to the inclusion of seven bills originally in the family crest. Thomas's uncle, Hugh \\"with ye Brazen Hand\\", left Aberfield to found the family branch in Siddenhall (Sidnall), (Shropshire). Thomas Bullock (1546-1595) was High Sheriff of Berkshire in 1581 and in the Commission of the Peace in 1592. He was the last Bullock of Arborfield, being obliged to sell the estates (the manors of Arberfield and Barkham, situated in the towns, villages and fields of Arberfeld, Barkham, Hurst, Ockingham, Shingfield and Erley) owing to accumulated debts. His uncle, George, refused to hand over the deeds. Thomas was forced by the family to produce a deed of entail and, having received the title deeds, went on to repudiate the deed. His brother and heir, William, litigated through the Court of Chancery and the Star Chamber but the sale was confirmed. Thomas died in 1595, William, with the support of tenants, entered into possession in serious contempt of court, resulting in him being thrown into Fleet Prison. William continued actions to recover the estate in the Queen’s Bench, then the Court of Common Pleas, and later petitioned the Elizabeth I, the Privy Council and the Lord Keeper, but in vain. William, released from prison and now of Stratfield Mortimer, married well, his third wife being Elizabeth Bellet of Morton in Essex, restoring the family fortunes. His son, John, moved the family to the Manor House of Mulsham, at Great Wigborough in Essex, where he purchased estates at Loftes in Great and Little Totham. These estates remained in the family until the death of Edward Bullock of Faulkbourne in 1705. Bullocks of Faulkbourne Sir Edward Bullock Faulkbourne Hall, 1817. Sir Edward Bullock (c. 1580-1644) was the elder son of Edward Bullock of Wigborough and Loftes in Great Totham. He was knighted by King James I and was a Royalist during the English Civil War. He acquired the manor of Faulkbourne in 1637 and made substantial alterations to Faulkbourne Hall, which remained the family seat until 1897. He married Elizabeth Wylde and is buried at the St Germanus' Church, Faulkbourne. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the family thrived through a series of marriages to wealthy heiresses. Edward Bullock (1663–1705) was lord of seven manors and sat as a Member of Parliament for the County of Essex in 1698 and later for the Borough of Colchester in 1703. He became Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Essex and High Sheriff of Essex in 1696 and 1703. Through his marriage to Elizabeth, elder daughter of Sir Mark Guyon of Coggeshall, large estates at Coggeshall, Maplestead and Finchingfield were inherited by the family. After Elizabeth's death, he married Mary, the daughter of Sir Josiah Child of Wanstead. Sir Josiah thoroughly opposed the marriage and left his daughter a mere £5 in his will \\"and no more because she hath married not only without my consent but expressly against my command and contrary to her own repeated promises and lette others learne by her example\\". Through Sir Mark Guyon's younger daughter, Rachel, who married Edward's younger brother, John Bullock, the Guyon estates at Radwinter and Great Wigborough came into the family and passed by intestacy to Col. John Bullock. Gainsborough Edward and Mary’s son, Josiah Bullock (1697-1752), attempted to follow his maternal grandfather's example and make his fortune in trade. He spent most of his life in London – in Highgate and the City – as a Royal Exchange Director and Hambro Merchant. Though a local Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant, he neglected his duties at Faulkbourne. Josiah Bullock married Hannah, daughter of Sir Thomas Cooke, M.P.. Their son, John, had his portrait painted by Thomas Gainsborough. He was a Colonel in the East Essex Militia. Educated at Clare Hall, Cambridge, at the age of 23 he embarked on a parliamentary career that lasted 56 years and culminated in him becoming Father of the House. He took a keen interest in Faulkbourne and undertook many improvements to the Hall and grounds. A patron of the arts, he founded a wide-ranging collection of pictures. Whilst his wife Elizabeth was heiress to large slum estates in Southwark (17 acres containing 400 houses), he exhausted a large part of her fortune on parliamentary life. She died in 1793 and they had no children. He left his estates on his death, in 1809, to Jonathan Josiah Christopher Watson, son of his elder sister, also named Elizabeth, who had married Jonathan Watson of Ringhall in Suffolk. Jonathan Josiah Christopher Watson (1749-1832) succeeded to the Essex estates directly from his uncle in 1809 and, in the following year, took the surname Bullock, rather than Watson, under Royal Sign Manual, subject to some £24,000 of debt. He was a Major in the East Essex Militia. His eldest son, also Jonathan (1773-1860), served in the 1st Dragoon Guards and as a Justice of the Peace, Deputy Lieutenant and, in 1837, High Sheriff of Essex. He did not marry an heiress but a daughter of the Vicar of Witham. His brother, John (1775–1844), became Rector of Radwinter and Faulkbourne and was the great- grandfather of Guy Bullock. After Jonathan’s death in 1860, the pressure of social and economic change in the 19th century brought the beginnings of the family's decline at Faulkbourne. Properties began to be sold when the Rev. Walter Trevelyan Bullock (1818-1878) inherited the estates, his three elder brothers having predeceased him, leaving only Faulkbourne and Radwinter in the family. He had been Rector of Faulkbourne until 1852 before moving to Devon, yet after only a year he returned to Faulkbourne on the death of his brother. He later lived mainly in London and, on a visit to Faulkbourne, accidentally poisoned himself and died in 1878. His sister, Margaret Emily Bullock (1822-1913), married the Rev. Hon. Llewellyn Charles Robert Irby, the youngest son of George Irby, 3rd Baron Boston. His eldest son, Walter Henry Bullock (1861-1924), was the last of the Faulkbourne senior male lineage. During his youth, his trustees carried out extensive repairs to the Hall but he was never permanently in residence there. In 1892 most of the tapestries and pictures, such as the fitted Aubusson tapestries and Gainsborough’s portrait of Col. John Bullock, were sold. Faulkbourne Hall and the surrounding estate were purchased in 1897 by Andrew Motion, who shortly thereafter sold them to Christopher William Oxley Parker. Twentieth century Lady Bullock at Cambridge University c. 1913Walter Henry Bullock died in 1924. His son, Henry Talbot Bouverie Bullock, had only a daughter. Therefore, the family line passed to Walter's brother, the Rev. Llewellyn Christopher Watson (1886-1936). He married Cecil Augusta Margaret Spearman, whose mother, Lady Maria Louisa Spearman (1837-1917), was the daughter of Thomas FitzMaurice, 5th Earl of Orkney, the great-nephew of the former Prime Minister William Petty- FitzMaurice, 1st Marquess of Landsdowne. The line passed to their eldest son, Walter Llewellyn Bullock (1890-1944), an academic and promoter of Italian studies at the Universities of Chicago and Manchester, where he was Serena Professor of Italian. The line then passed to Llewellyn’s second son, Sir Christopher Bullock, K.C.B, C.B.E.(1891-1972), who served as Permanent Under- Secretary at the British Air Ministry from 1931 to 1936. Appointed at the age of 38, he remains one of the youngest civil servants to have headed a British government department.Chapman, Richard A., Ethics in the British Civil Service, 1988 , p. 144Geoffrey-Lloyd, Bullock, Sir Christopher Llewellyn (1891–1972), rev. Mark Pottle, xford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 In 1917 he married Barbara May Lupton, the second cousin of Olive Middleton (née Lupton), great-grandmother of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. It was reported in 2016 that \\"Olive Middleton volunteered as a nurse with her relative Lady Bullock\\" - a social science graduate - during World War 1. Sir Christopher was succeeded by his elder son, Richard Henry Watson Bullock C.B.,(1920–1998) who was Deputy Permanent Secretary at the Department of Trade and Industry and a consultant for Faulkbourn Consultancy Services. Richard, in turn, was succeeded by his son, the actor and art historian Osmund Bullock, the current head of the family. Sir Christopher's younger son, Edward Anthony Watson Bullock (1926-2015) served in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and married Jenifer, elder daughter of Sir Richmond Palmer.

Life  The street dedicated to Morigia in the historical center of Monza Born in Monza around 1295, he was a member of an important Ghibelline family of that city. He took an active part in the political struggles of his time, siding with the party of the Visconti, lords of Milan. He was also a member of the Council of the Twelve which administered the city, and on one occasion was ambassador to Venice. He is however noted as an historian.  Main Works  The main work of Morigia is the Chronicon Modoetiense, a history of Monza from its origins to his own day. Morigia is the first author known to report the legend that the Latin name of Monza (\\"Modoetia\\") derives from a vision in a dream by Queen Theodelinda: a dove (symbol of the Holy Spirit) is said to have told her to found her capital on the site, bearing in it a scroll inscribed with the word \\"Modo\\" (\\"Now\\"), to which she responded \\"Etiam\\" (\\"Yes\\"). This legend inspired some of the frescoes in Monza Cathedral by the Zavattari brothers. He was also the first biographer of Saint Gerardo dei Tintori, hospitaller and patron saint of Monza together with Saint John the Baptist. The life of Gerardo is included in the Chronicon Modoetiense, where Morigia also lists a number of miracles attributed to the saint, of one of which Morigia claims to have been an eyewitness.

It is a dominant species in many areas, and may grow alongside other common grasses such as bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), and needle-and- thread grass (Hesperostipa comata). It can be found in sagebrush and pinyon- juniper woodland. It is a climax species, occurring in undisturbed plant communities. This grass provides food for livestock and wildlife. It is forage for cattle, sheep, and wild horses. Black-tailed jackrabbits often consume it. Juvenile pronghorn eat the grass when it is young. Many grazing animals avoid the grass when it matures, because the spikelets are sharp and hard. At this point the seeds are consumed by birds and small mammals. Some animals, such as the Sage Grouse, use the grass for cover.

The outcome of this scheme was a renewal of the war with the Mapuche. They elected Curiñancu toqui and prepared for hostilities in case the Spaniards should persist in this course. Two or three cities were begun, but the Mapuche demanded tools with which to work, offered all manner of excuses for the purpose of delaying the enterprise, and finally, these efforts failing to dissuade the Spaniards from the undertaking, they slew their superintendents and besieged the quartermaster in his camp. Governor Guill y Gonzaga retaliated by forming an alliance with the Pehuenches. Curiñancu, ended this treasonous alliance with a sudden assault on the Pehuenches, routing them in battle. He captured their leader, Coliguna, Curiñancu executed him. Gonzaga soon died, following the failure to accomplish his scheme, and Juan de Balmaseda y Censano Beltrán governed for a short time until Francisco Javier de Morales y Castejón de Arrollo succeeded to the governorship. The war with the Araucanians continued. Curiñancu and his vice toqui, Leviantu, constantly raided in Spanish territory, defeating the Spaniards occasionally. By 1773, the war with the Mapuche had cost Spain over a million and a half dollars. Agustín de Jáuregui y Aldecoa finally agreed to a treaty in the Parliament of Tapihue (1774) which reaffirmed the old treaties of Quillin and Negrete, and Curiñancu exacted a further concession, that the Araucanians would be permitted to keep an embassy in Santiago, like any other independent nation.

During the Qianning era (894-898) of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, he became the commander of Tielin Base (). During Li Keyong's campaign against Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (靜難, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), Zhou had accomplishments and was made the deputy commander of Li Keyong's headquarter guard corps.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 56. Later in 898, when Li Keyong sent his adoptive nephew Li Sizhao and Zhou to try to recover three prefectures east of the Taihang Mountains that he had previously lost to his archenemy Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) (Xing (邢州, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), Ci (磁州, in modern Handan, Hebei), and Ming (洺州, also in modern Handan)). However, they were defeated by Zhu's general Ge Congzhou, who subsequently cut off their escape path back into the Taihang. It was due to the effort of Li Keyong's adoptive son Li Siyuan in fighting through Ge's blockade that the Hedong army was able to escape.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. In 899, Ge tried to attack Hedong's main territory, and his deputy Shi Shucong () advanced to Yuci (榆次, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi). Li Keyong sent Zhou to try to repel Shi. Shi's forward commander, one Chen Zhang (), claimed that he could capture Zhou, but Zhou, in a one-to-one confrontation, hammered Chen off his horse and captured him. Subsequently, his soldiers defeated Shi's soldiers, and Shi fled. Following Shi's defeat, Ge also withdrew. In late 899, Zhu sent Ge to attack Liu Rengong the military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), putting Liu's son Liu Shouwen the military governor of Yichang Circuit (義昌, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) under siege at Yichang's capital Cang Prefecture (). In spring 900, Li Keyong sent Zhou with a 5,000-men cavalry force, and then had Li Sizhao follow up with a 50,000-men force to attack Xing and Ming Prefectures to try to relieve the pressure on the Lius. Subsequently, though, Zhu recalled Ge, as Wang Rong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) mediated the dispute, and Ge's army was also itself stalled by rainstorms. By that point, Li Sizhao had captured Ming Prefecture. Zhu sent Ge against Li Sizhao, and subsequently arrived himself with reinforcements. Li Sizhao withdrew, but suffered substantial losses.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. In spring 901, Xuanwu forces under Shi launched a major attack against Hedong, advancing all the way to Hedong's capital Taiyuan Municipality and put it under siege. The city almost fell, but eventually, with Xuanwu forces bogged down by rain and running out of food supplies, Zhu recalled Shi. As Shi was retreating, Zhou and Li Sizhao attacked him, inflicting losses. Later in the year, Li Keyong sent Li Sizhao and Zhou to capture Xi () and Ci (慈州, both in modern Linfen, Shanxi, not the same prefecture as the one east of the Taihang Mountains) Prefectures, which had become under Zhu's control when Zhu conquered Huguo Circuit (護國, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) earlier in 901. Later in 901, the powerful eunuchs at the Tang imperial court at Chang'an, believing that then- reigning Emperor Zhaozong of Tang and the chancellor Cui Yin were able to slaughter them, forcibly seized Emperor Zhaozong and took him to Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), then reigned by the eunuchs' ally Li Maozhen. Cui, who was allied with Zhu, summoned Zhu to attack Fengxiang. Li Maozhen wrote Li Keyong to request aid. Li Keyong sent Li Sizhao to attack Jin Prefecture (晉州, in modern Linfen), and Li Sizhao defeated Xuanwu forces at Jin Prefecture. Subsequent battles in spring 902 in which Li Sizhao and Zhou engaged Shi and Zhu's nephew Zhu Youning (), however, could not produce conclusive Hedong victories, and Shi was eventually able to defeat Li Sizhao and Zhou at Pu County (蒲縣, in modern Linfen). They tried to withdraw, but the Xuanwu forces chased them. In the subsequent engagement, Li Keyong's son Li Tingluan () was captured by Xuanwu forces, who then again advanced to Taiyuan and put it under siege. The situation became so dire that Li Keyong, under the advice of his adoptive son Li Cunxin, considered abandoning Taiyuan and fleeing to the north; only at the urging of his wife Lady Liu, as well as Li Sizhao, Li Siyuan, and Zhou, did Li Keyong resolve to defend the city. Li Sizhao and Li Siyuan again led nightly counterattacks against the sieging Xuanwu forces, and eventually, the Xuanwu forces withdrew. Even though Hedong forces were in fact then able to further recapture Ci, Xi, and Fen (汾州, in modern Linfen), it was said that Li Keyong did not dare to again engage Zhu for several years. (Li Maozhen was subsequently forced to sue for peace by surrendering the emperor to Zhu.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. Later in 906, Zhu advanced north and again put Liu Shouwen under siege at Cang Prefecture. Liu Rengong sought aid from Li Keyong to try to save Liu Shouwen. Under Li Keyong's demand, Liu Rengong sent troops to join Hedong forces under Li Sizhao and Zhou in attacking Lu Prefecture (潞州, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), to try to recapture Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered at Lu Prefecture). When the joint Hedong/Lulong forces reached Lu Prefecture, Ding Hui, the military governor commissioned by Zhu, who had been mourning Emperor Zhaozong of Tang (whom Zhu had assassinated in 905 and replaced with his son Emperor Ai), surrendered Lu to them.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. In 907, Zhu forced Emperor Ai to yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang with him as its Emperor Taizu. Li Keyong, along with Li Maozhen (whose territory became Qi), Yang Wo the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) (whose territory became Wu), and Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) (whose territory became Former Shu), refused to recognize the Later Liang emperor, and thereafter was effectively the ruler of his own state of Jin (as he had been previously created the Prince of Jin by Emperor Zhaozong). Shortly thereafter, the Later Liang emperor sent the general Kang Huaizhen () to put Lu Prefecture under siege. After a conventional siege failed to capture the city after half a month, Kang built a centipede-like encampment around the city to try to starve it while also using it defensively against any Hedong relief troops. Li Keyong subsequently sent Zhou to command a relief army to try to lift the siege, but while both Li Sizhao and Zhou were able to disrupt the siege operations, Kang's encampment held, and Zhou was unable to lift the siege. By spring 908, with Li Keyong having fallen gravely ill, Zhou withdrew to Luanliu (亂柳, in modern Changzhi). Li Keyong entrusted his oldest biological son, Li Cunxu, whom he designated as his heir, to his brother Li Kening, the eunuch monitor of the army Zhang Chengye, the officers Li Cunzhang and Wu Gong (), and the secretary Lu Zhi (). Before dying, he stated to Li Cunxu:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Li Keyong, knowing that there was a rivalry between Li Sizhao and Zhou, also told Li Cunxu: Li Keyong then died, and Li Cunxu succeeded him as the Prince of Jin.  Service under Li Cunxu   In Li Cunxu's initial campaigns  Li Cunxu himself had, immediately after becoming prince, had to deal with a conspiracy by Li Kening and an adoptive son of Li Keyong's, Li Cunhao (), to overthrow him, but after executing Li Kening and Li Cunhao and Zhou showed submission by returning to Taiyuan to mourn Li Keyong and pay homage to Li Cunxu, Li Cunxu prepared for a campaign to save Li Sizhao. He put Ding Hui in nominal command of the operation, while he himself, Zhou, and Li Siyuan led the main attacks against the Later Liang centipede encampment. They attacked it under the cover of fog, and the Later Liang forces collapsed and fled. When Zhou subsequently arrived at the city walls and announced that the siege had been lifted, Li Sizhao initially did not believe him, but when Li Cunxu subsequently arrived, wearing white armor (thus signifying that Li Keyong had died), Li Sizhao realized what had occurred and fell into deep mourning before opening the gates to let Li Cunxu enter. (Before the battle, Li Cunxu had told Zhou what Li Keyong had said before his death, and Zhou, in response, fought particularly fiercely during the battle. After the battle, he relayed what occurred to Li Sizhao, and the two reformed a friendship.) After the siege was lifted, Zhou put Later Liang's Ze Prefecture (澤州, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi) under siege, but could not quickly capture it against the defense put up by the Later Liang general Niu Cunjie (); when another Later Liang general, Liu Zhijun, arrived to aid Niu, Zhou lifted the siege and withdrew. For Zhou's contributions in saving Lu Prefecture, Li Cunxu made him the military governor of Zhenwu Circuit (振武, headquartered in modern Shuozhou). In fall 908, Li Sizhao and Zhou attacked Later Liang's Jin Prefecture and put it under siege. Later Liang's Emperor Taizu personally went to aid Jin Prefecture, and when Li Sizhao and Zhou heard that the Later Liang emperor would be soon arriving, they withdrew.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. In 909, after Liu Zhijun had surrendered to Qi, Li Maozhen planned to have Liu command an attack on Later Liang's Shuofang (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia) and Dingnan (定難, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi) Circuits. He thus requested Li Cunxu to simultaneously attack Jin and Jiang (絳州, in modern Yuncheng) Prefectures. Li Cunxu prepared to attack those prefectures, and he sent Zhou to attack Jin Prefecture first. Zhou put Jin Prefecture under siege, but could not capture it quickly. When the Later Liang general Yang Shihou then arrived, he withdrew. In 910, in another coordinated attack between Qi and Jin, Li Maozhen personally went to attack Dingnan, then governed by Li Renfu, along with his vassals Li Jihui the military governor of Jingnan and Liu (whom he had commissioned the military governor of Zhangyi Circuit (彰義, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), while Li Cunxu sent Zhou. The joint Qi and Jin forces put Dingnan's capital Xia Prefecture () under siege. When the Later Liang generals Li Yu () and Liu Wan () subsequently arrived to aid Li Renfu, however, the Qi and Jin forces withdrew. In late 910, Later Liang's Emperor Taizu, believing that Wang Rong, who at that point was a Later Liang vassal carrying the title of Prince of Zhao, would turn against him eventually, decided to take Chengde (which he had renamed Wushun () by force. He sent his attendants Du Tingyin () and Ding Yanhui () to Wushun's Shen () and Ji (冀州, both in modern Hengshui, Hebei) Prefectures with troops, claiming to be helping Wushun defend against a possible attack by Liu Shouguang. Despite advice by his officer Shi Gongli () against doing so, Wang Rong received Du and Ding. However, once they settled into the cities, they slaughtered the remaining Wushun garrisons at the two prefectures and prepared for defense, waiting for the main Later Liang forces under the general Wang Jingren to arrive to try to conquer the rest of Wushun. Wang Rong ordered Shi to try to recapture the two prefectures, but Shi was unable to, so Wang sought emergency aid from both Li Cunxu and Liu Shouguang. Liu refused to act, but Li Cunxu immediately sent Zhou to reinforce the defenses of Wushun's Zhao Prefecture (趙州, in modern Shijiazuang) and then prepared to personally aid Wang Rong. Hearing of what Later Liang forces did to Wushun, Wang Chuzhi the military governor of nearby Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) also turned against Later Liang. (Yiwu and Wushun thus became effectively independent states in alliance with Jin, and they, as Jin had been, returned to the use of the Tang era name of Tianyou; Wushun also changed its name back to Chengde.) Soon thereafter, the main Later Liang army under Wang Jingren arrived, and the allied Jin/Zhao/Yiwu forces prepared to engage them. However, Zhou, while dealing the forward Later Liang forces minor defeats, urged caution—pointing out that the area of engagement was not an open field and therefore the Jin cavalry advantage would turn into a disadvantage. Li Cunxu initially refused to listen, but Zhou persuaded Zhang Chengye to also urge against immediate engagement. Li Cunxu listened to Zhang and followed Zhou's advice. He thus withdrew to a more open area and did not engage Wang Jingren until spring 911, at Boxiang (柏鄉, in modern Xingtai). By that point, the Later Liang army was low on food supplies due to Zhou's raids against their food supply route, and after a full day of battle, they were worn out and eventually collapsed when Wang Jingren's immediate forces moved, causing the rest of the army to believe that he had fled. In the aftermaths, Du and Ding abandoned Shen and Ji, allowing Zhao to retake those prefectures. The Jin/Zhao combined army further attacked south, preparing to attack Later Liang's Tianxiong (i.e., Weibo) and Baoyi (保義, headquartered at Xing Prefecture) Circuits; during this advancement, Zhou attacked Bei (貝州, in modern Xingtai) and Chan (澶州, in modern Anyang, Henan), advancing as far as the Yellow River. When Liu Shouguang subsequently postured to get involved, however, Li Cunxu, fearing an attack by Liu from the back, withdrew the Jin army from the front and himself returned to Taiyuan, but left Zhou with 3,000 men to help defend Zhao Prefecture.  Destruction of Yan  In late 911, Liu Shouguang, who earlier had claimed the title of Emperor of Yan, attacked Yiwu. Wang Chuzhi sought aid from Li Cunxu, who sent Zhou to aid him. In spring 912, Zhou joined forces with Wang Rong's adoptive son Wang Deming and the Yiwu officer Cheng Yan () to start an attack on Yan. With Liu Rengong's son Liu Shouqi (), who had fled to Hedong when Liu Shouguang overthrew Liu Rengong, in his army, Liu Zhiwen () the prefect of Zhuo Prefecture (涿州, in modern Baoding) quickly surrendered to Liu Shouqi. Zhou, however, was jealous that Liu Shouqi quickly won this victory and made false accusations to Li Cunxu against Liu Shouqi. Liu Shouqi, realizing this, fled to Later Liang. Meanwhile, Zhou quickly advanced to Yan's capital You Prefecture (), but did not immediately put it under siege. Rather, he attacked Yan's other cities, capturing them one by one until You Prefecture was isolated. He also sought additional troops from Li Cunxu, stating his belief that his army was not large enough for a siege, so Li Cunxu sent his adoptive brothers Li Cunshen and Li Siyuan to aid Zhou. Soon thereafter, Zhou captured the Yan general Dan Tinggui () in a one-on-one combat, greatly cutting into the Yan morale.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. With his city-to-city campaign successful, by summer 912, Zhou was putting You Prefecture under siege. When Liu Shouguang sent a humbly-worded letter begging for peace, Zhou mocked him, stating: Zhou thus turned down Liu Shouguang's overture, but after Liu again begged, he relayed Liu's offer of peace to Li Cunxu. Meanwhile, Liu Shouqi and Yan Shihou entered Zhao territory to try to force Zhou to give up his campaign to save Zhao. Zhou sent Wang Deming back to Zhao to aid the Jin generals Li Cunshen and Shi Jiantang () in defending Zhao, but did not relent on his siege. When Li Cunxu subsequently sent Zhang Chengye to You Prefecture to discuss the status of the siege with Zhou, Liu Shouguang offered to surrender to Zhang, but Zhang refused, citing Liu Shouguang's past history of not following his own words. Zhou subsequently repelled a counterattack by Liu Shouguang. By winter 913, You Prefecture was in desperate straits. Liu Shouguang offered to surrender if Li Cunxu personally came to accept his surrender. Zhou thus relayed this offer to Li Cunxu. When Li Cunxu arrived and promised Liu Shouguang that his life would be spared if he did surrender, Liu Shouguang hesitated and did not do so. When Liu Shouguang's trusted officer Li Xiaoxi () then surrendered and revealed to the Jin army the desperate situation the city was in, the Jin army launched its fiercest attack yet, and the city fell. Liu Shouguang fled, but soon was captured. Li Cunxu made Zhou the military governor of Lulong, and took Liu Shouguang and Liu Rengong as captives. (He executed them in 914.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269.  Governance of Lulong  While Zhou Dewei was a renowned general, governing Lulong posed a challenge that he had not faced before—dealing with the growing threat of the Khitan to the north. The Khitan tribes had been unified into a state under Yelü Abaoji, who claimed the title of emperor (as Emperor Taizu, of the state that would eventually be known as Liao Dynasty). It was said that during the rule of prior military governors of Lulong, they would put up strong defenses at Yu Pass, with the garrisons at and around the pass forming a self-sustaining unit with the local farmers and the local government. During fall and winter, the harvest would be gathered early so that nothing would remain on the field for the Khitan to use on their incursions. Therefore, the Khitan did not dare to venture deep into Lulong territory. However, after Zhou became military governor, he, overly confident of his own fighting abilities, neglected to maintain the defenses at Yu Pass. The Khitan were therefore able to slip past it and make the area between Ying (營州, in modern Chaoyang, Liaoning) and Ping (平州, in modern Qinhuangdao, Hebei) a grazing field, so the defense was lost. Further, Zhou was suspicious of the loyalty of the Lulong army, so he found excuses to execute many of its senior officers, causing the army morale to drop. Meanwhile, after Yan's destruction, Li Cunxu prepared to begin campaigns against Later Liang in earnest. In fall 914, he met with Zhou and Wang Rong at Zhao Prefecture, and subsequently advanced south to attack Xing Prefecture. Li Sizhao also arrived to join them with Zhaoyi troops. However, they withdrew after Yang Shihou arrived and the Jin officer Cao Jinjin () defected to Later Liang. In 915, the Later Liang emperor Zhu Zhen (Emperor Taizu's son and successor), after the recent death of Yang (who was military governor of Tianxiong at that time), decided to reduce Tianxiong's strength, which had caused it to be a difficult-to-tame circuit in the past. He decided to divide Tianxiong into two circuits. The Tianxiong army, however, did not wish to be divided, and they mutinied, putting the Later Liang- commissioned military governor He Delun () under arrest and forcing him to write to Li Cunxu to submit to Jin. Li Cunxu subsequently arrived and accepted Tianxiong's submission. Zhu Zhen sent the general Liu Xun to try to recapture Tianxiong, but believing that, given the Jin strength was at Tianxiong at that time, Taiyuan could be captured, Liu Xun decided to put up a facade that he was going to engage Li Cunxu and instead headed directly for Taiyuan. When Zhou realized this, he chased after Liu Xun and, bypassing him, blocked his path to Taiyuan and trapping him in the Taihang Mountains briefly, although Liu was eventually able to fight past Zhou and escape, albeit with losses. In spring 917, Li Cunxu's younger brother Li Cunju (), who was then serving as the defender of Weisai Base () at Xin Prefecture (新洲, in modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei), was ordered by Li Cunxu to conscript troops and collect horses in order to send reinforcements for Li Cunxu's campaign efforts. Li Cunju's urgency in collecting soldiers and horses drew resentment and fear from the people, and as he subsequently advanced south to join Li Cunxu, the soldiers mutinied and killed him, supporting his deputy Lu Wenjin to return to Xin Prefecture, but the defending officer of Xin, Yang Quanzhang () refused to receive him. He then attacked Wu Prefecture (武州, in modern Zhangjiakou), but was defeated by Li Sigong (). Zhou also sent forces to attack Lu, who then fled to Khitan. Energized by Lu's arrival, as Lu was able to serve as a guide for attacks on Jin territory, Khitan's Emperor Taizu decided to launch a major attack on Lulong. Later in the spring, the Khitan army, with Lu serving as its guide, attacked and quickly captured Xin Prefecture. When Li Cunxu ordered Zhou to counterattack with Lulong troops, joined by Zhao and Yiwu troops, they were defeated by Khitan troops, and Zhou was forced to flee back to You Prefecture. The Khitan forces subsequently put You Prefecture under siege, and Zhou requested emergency aid from Li Cunxu. Li Cunxu, who was then stalemated with Later Liang forces on the Yellow River, was fearful of diverting forces to save Zhou, but under the urging of Li Siyuan, Li Cunshen, and Yan Bao (), decided to do so. He ordered Li Siyuan and Yan to advance first toward You, and then sent Li Cunshen to reinforce them. Together, they defeated Khitan forces and lifted the siege on You. However, it was said that after this battle, You Prefecture became constantly under the threat of Khitan, which would send raiders to cut off food supply routes to You. Further, the Khitan emperor commissioned Lu as the military governor of his own Lulong Circuit (headquartered at Ping Prefecture), and Lu and his Han troops would serve as guides in every Khitan incursion into Jin territory. It was said that Lulong's prefectures became gravely stricken by the constant Khitan raids.  Death at Huliu Slope  In fall 918, Li Cunxu prepared for a major attack on Later Liang. He had Zhou (with Lulong troops), Li Cunshen (with Henghai (i.e., Yichang) troops), and Li Siyuan (with Anguo (i.e., Baoyi)) troops rendezvous at Tianxiong's capital Wei Prefecture () with him and the Hedong and Tianxiong troops directly under his command, as well as Yiwu troops that Wang Chuzhi sent and tribal troops from Xi, Khitan, Shiwei, and Tuyuhun tribes under him. When he heard that Zhu Zhen had recently executed the general Xie Yanzhang () under false accusations by another general, He Gui, he was glad and prepared to immediately attack Later Liang. Zhou pointed out that despite Xie's death, the Later Liang army remained strong and that an engagement should be well- thought out before engaged. Li Cunxu did not listen to him and initiated the campaign. The Jin troops and the Later Liang troops, commanded by He Gui, met at Huliu Slope (胡柳陂, in modern Heze, Shandong), not far from the Later Liang capital Daliang. Zhou pointed out that the Later Liang army outnumbered Jin troops and was highly motivated due t the closeness to their capital. He advocated similar tactics that resulted in the Boxiang victory—refusing to engage Later Liang troops quickly, using cavalry raiders to wear them out and cut off their food supplies, and then engage them once they were tired. Li Cunxu refused, believing that this was the time to finally destroy the main Later Liang army once and for all, and he took his own troops and proceeded without agreement from either Zhou or Li Cunshen. Zhou was forced to follow Li Cunxu, but commented to his son, \\"I will not have a good place to die.\\" Subsequently, in the initial engagement, Jin forces prevailed over that of He's subordinate Wang Yanzhang, but as Wang Yanzhang was withdrawing toward the west, Jin's support troops, which was to the west as well, thought that Wang was winning the battle and heading toward them to attack them, panicked and fled, colliding with Li Cunxu's and Zhou's troops. Zhou died in the ensuing confusion, along with his son, as did Li Cunxu's secretary, Wang Jian () the deputy military governor of Tianxiong. Jin forces later counterattacked and fought the battle to a draw, with both armies said to have casualties of two thirds of their troops. Li Cunxu, regretting that his refusal to listen to Zhou had caused Zhou's death, mourned him bitterly. He made Zhou's son Zhou Guangfu () the prefect of Lan Prefecture (嵐州, in modern Lüliang, Shanxi). After Li Cunxu later established Later Tang as its Emperor Zhuangzong, he gave Zhou posthumous honors. Later, after Li Siyuan succeeded as Emperor Mingzong, he had Zhou, as well as Li Sizhao and Li Cunshen, worshipped at Emperor Zhuangzong's temple. Later, after Emperor Mingzong's son-in-law Shi Jingtang established Later Jin as its Emperor Gaozu, he further posthumously created Zhou the Prince of Yan.

By the standards of his era, John Forbes was a cultured full-back, who relied on speed rather than power to overcome opponents. His penchant for pace probably stemmed from the fact that he began his career as a forward with Star of Leven. Indeed, in an article in \\"The Scottish Referee\\" in March 1902, it was said of Forbes that in his youth, 'so fast was he that he lost command of the ball, over running it, and waiting for it to come to him, and not vice versa'. In 1879 he joined Vale of Leven, again as a forward, but was quickly converted into a half-back. However, his gift of speed and natural athleticism led him to adopt a roving commission in the role and his critics castigated him for being 'all over the shop'. He was later converted into a right-back before being switched to the opposite flank. It was as a left–back that his talent blossomed to the extent that he was capped by Scotland. He made his Scotland debut on 26 January 1884 at Ulster Cricket Ground, Belfast against Ireland. Scotland won 5–0. Forbes played in all three Scotland – British Home Championship matches, Scotland winning all three and only conceding one goal. (1883-84 British Home Championship) While playing for Vale of Leven he appeared in two Scottish Cup Finals, in 1883 and 1885, but had the misfortune to be on the losing side on both occasions. The 1883 Final was played at Hampden Park on 31 March 1883 and the opposition was Dumbarton. The match ended 2–2. The replay, also at Hampden Park on 7 April 1883 Dumbarton won 2–1. (1882-83 Scottish Cup) Forbes would have featured in the 1884 Cup Final but, tragically, his Mother died in the week of the match and the funeral was arranged for the same day as the Final. The Scottish Football Association refused to alter the date of the game and as a result Vale of Leven, out of respect for Forbes and his family, refused to participate in the match and forfeited the trophy. The 1885 Final was played at Hampden Park on (date unknown) and the opposition was Renton. The match ended 0–0. The replay, also at Hampden Park on (date unknown) Renton won 3–1. (1884-85 Scottish Cup) Forbes returned to international duty missing just one of three British Home Championship matches in 1886–87. His first international match that season ironically was at Leamington Road, the then home of Blackburn Rovers. Scotland defeated England 3–2. Scotland also beat Wales and so Forbes had a 100% record for Scotland.(1886-87 British Home Championship) The Wales match was Forbes' last for Scotland as within a year he had moved to England and at that time the Scottish Football Association would not pick Scottish players playing outside of Scotland. Before the international matches Forbes was a guest player for Glasgow Rangers then they beat Lincoln City in the FA Cup Fifth Round. In March 1887 he was a member of the Rangers team that was beaten by Aston Villa in an FA Cup semi–final at Nantwich Road Crewe. 1888-1889 Forbes became an immediate favourite with the Blackburn fans. John Forbes, playing as a full–back, made his League debut on 13 October 1888 at Wellington Road, the then home of Aston Villa. The visitors lost 6–1. John Forbes appeared in 16 of the 22 League matches played by Blackburn Rovers in season 1888–89. John Forbes, playing at full–back (16 appearances), was part of the Blackburn Rovers defence that achieved four League clean–sheets and kept the opposition to one–League–goal–in–a–match on three occasions. Forbes also played in all five FA Cup ties at full–back including the semi–final and semi–final replay against Wolverhampton Wanderers, the latter Blackburn Rovers lost 3–1. (registration & fee required) Forbes playing career ended in 1894. He played in 127 first–class matches for Blackburn Rovers, 106 in the Football League and 21 in the FA Cup. He scored two goals for the club, one in the League and one in the FA Cup. He played in five FA Cup semi-finals for Blackburn Rovers, winning three and also played in two FA Cup Finals, both of which were won. (registration & fee required) His strengths as a player lay in his speed and in his ability to clear his lines, despite the fact that he was not the most powerful kicker of a football. His slight physique meant that he could not barge opponents off the ball, but had to use more subtle methods, which often involved reading the game and using his speed to intercept the ball before opponents could gain possession.

The museum is dedicated to the history of the Peenemünde Army Research Centre and the Luftwaffe test site of \\"Peenemünde-West\\", especially the rockets and missiles developed there between 1936 and 1945. Since January 2007 the information centre has become an anchor point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH), a Europe-wide network of industrial monuments, and a part of the ERIH themed routes for Energy and Transport & Communication. In 2008 around the museum had 222,000 visitors including many school classes. Around €6.5M were invested in the museum's renovation and expansion; a further investment of €3.9 M is planned. In 2002 the HTM was given the Coventry Cross of Nails and in 2013 the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award .  Exhibition  A4-Modell (HTI Peenemünde) The main purpose of the exhibition in the power station is to be a memorial site where visitors can learn from exhibits, documents and films about the fateful pact made by the rocket engineers around Wernher von Braun with former powers in order to develop the aerospace industry. In the mid-1960s, building on his technical experience from Peenemünde, Wernher von Braun was able to design the Saturn V rocket for NASA that was used to fly to the moon. The role of the former rocket engineer in Peenemünde, however, was to develop weapons of war. Films show visitors how V-1 flying bombs worked. These experiences formed the basis for the development of nuclear missiles by the Allies after the war. According to documents in the exhibition even Peenemünde experts took part, including in Great Britain and France, where they helped to develop the Force de Frappe. As part of a detailed chronicle about the test site, the living and working conditions of the forced labourers and prisoners of war in Peenemünde is illustrated. In addition, there is extensive information on concentration camp prisoners, who assembled the V1-flying bombs in Bavaria and Austria under inhuman conditions. There is a chapel near the site which commemorates all the victims.  Open air displays  Amongst the showpieces on display in the open-air part of the site are a replica V-1 flying bomb (Fieseler Fi 103) and the A4 rocket. Exhibits in the Peenemünde Historical Technical Museum include: File:Peenem_Museum_V1_Modell.jpgThe V-1 flying bomb File:Peenemünde 2001 -NEWA 5W 57- by-RaBoe 01.jpgAnti-aircraft missiles File:Peenemünde 2001 -Hans Beimler (ship, 1986)- by-RaBoe 01.jpgThe Hans Beimler, a former Soviet-built, missile corvette of the Tarantul class operated by the Volksmarine File:Peenemünder_Triebwagen.JPGFormer Peenemünde railbus in the open air site File:MiG-23ML 332.jpgMiG-23ML of JG-9 squadron, displayed since 30 April 2010 at the Rechline Aerotechnology Museum.

He was one of the most important member of the House of Hanau.  Youth  The exact date of his birth is not known, not even the exact year, because in the Middle Ages a person's death date was considered far more important than their birth date, since a memorial mass would be celebrated on the death date. He was the second son of Ulrich IV of Hanau (born: between 1330 and 1340; died: in September or October 1380) and Countess Elizabeth of Wertheim (1347–1378 ). In the ruling family of Hanau, an explicit primogeniture statue of 1375 stipulated that only the eldest son could inherit the Lordship and even that only he could marry. Reinhard II as second son of Ulrich IV as was destined for a clerical career. He received a suitable education for such a career; in 1387 he was studying at the University of Bologna. In 1390, one of the sons of Ulrich IV, possibly Reinhard II, was enrolled as a student at the university of Heidelberg. The entry in the register does not mention a name, it merely states .Gustav Toepke, Die Matrikel der Universität Heidelberg von 1386 - 1662, Heidelberg, 1884, vol. 1, p. 43Adolf Stölzel, Die Entwicklung des gelehrten Richtertums in den deutschen Territorien: Eine rechtsgeschichtliche Untersuchung mit vorzugsweiser Berücksichtigung der Verhältnisse im Gebiet des ehemaligen Kurfürstentums Hessen, vol. 2, Stuttgart, 1872, reprinted 1964, p. 52. Stölzel erroneously put this mention in 1389. Reinhard abandoned his spiritual career in 1391, and closed a contract with his elder brother Ulrich V, which guaranteed him an annual income. The background was probably that Ulrich V's marriage was still childless and they wanted to preserve the possibility that Reinhard might succeed Ulrich V. The contract awarded Reinhard an annual sum of 400 florins and a share in the districts Partenstein, Rieneck, Bieber and Haßlau. This was the first generation in the history of the Hanau family where the younger sons did not join the clergy. In 1398, the contract was renewed, and Ulrich and Reinhard's younger brother John of Hanau was also awarded a pension, after a dispute with John had led to fighting.  Reign   Background  The heir apparent of Ulrich IV was Reinhard II's elder brother Ulrich V. Ulrich formally ruled Hanau from his father's death in 1380. However, as he was a minor at the time, a regency was set up, until he came of age in 1388. At that time, he was still without a male heir. Under the primogeniture statute, only the eldest son was allowed to marry; consequently, the continued existence of the dynasty was under threat. In 1391, a family contract was concluded, which allowed Reinhard II to marry if Ulrich still had no sons 10 years later. This 10-year period was due to end in 1401. Around 1395, a coalition between Reinhard and his younger brother John emerged. They acted independently from Ulrich and pursued policies directed against him. An open dispute arose, which was resolved by the settlement of 1398. Nevertheless, further disputes occurred, and even a feud. From 1394 onward, Ulrich V ran into economic difficulties. In 1396, the problem intensified. He had to pledge the two cities of Hanau and Babenhausen to his neighbour and political rival, the Archbishop John II of Mainz, who became de facto co-ruler of the Lordship of Hanau. On the other hand, Ulrich and his brothers were first cousins once removed of John II, so the ruling power remained in the family.  Coup of 1404  From 1400 onward, Reinhard and John of Hanau came to a political understanding with John II of Mainz. In 1402, their relationship became even closer and eventually, John II changed sides in the conflict the two younger brothers had with Ulrich. In 1404, power gradually shifted from Ulrich V to Reinhard II and on 26 November 1404, Ulrich was forced to abdicate. From 1404 to 1411, Reinhard and John ruled jointly. After John died in 1411, Reinhard II ruled alone.  Expansion of the County  The most important event of the dynastic reign of Reinhard II is his elevation to Imperial Count on 11 December 1429 by emperor Sigismund. From the year 1400, Reinhard II is active in imperial affairs. He co-signed the document, which deposes King Wenceslaus, and he was present at the election of King Sigismund in 1411. He appears as a witness at the elections of Emperor Albert II in 1438 and Frederick III in 1442. In 1401, Reinhard II and his brother John received and invitation to participate in an expedition to Rome. In 1414, he attended the Council of Constance. Reinhard II was often involved in feuds with neighbouring noblemen. In 1405, he fought in the side of Rupert against the robber barons in the Wetterau area. They dealt with the Water Castle at Rückingen, the castle at Höchst, Mömbris Castle, Wasserlos Castle, Hüttelngesäß Castle, Karben Castle and Hauenstein Castle. He also acted to maintain the regional peace, and to promote local agreements to resolve disputes and feuds peacefully and judicially. For example, in 1434, he mediated such an agreement between Mainz, Eppstein, Isenburg-Büdingen and Rieneck. He also served short term as regent in the County of Rieneck. His long reign was marked by an upswing in county government and later in many areas. This is for example reflected in the fact that during his reign, the dowry of his daughters got higher and higher. He reformed the administration and the judiciary. In 1434, the County of Hanau is released from all forms of foreign jurisdiction. He promoted churches and schools. His reign represent the beginning of the transition from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern Period and the transition to a modern territorial state. During his reign, the territory of the County was expanded. In 1434, he received the district of Bornheimerberg as a fief (it had been pledged to him earlier by the Empire); in 1435, he acquired half the mortgage stock on Gelnhausen (the Electorate of the Palatinate held the other half), and in 1446, he acquired a part of the inheritance of the Counts of Falkenstein. The focus in his county shifts to the city of Hanau. Some authors report that the capital was officially moved from Windecken Castle to Hanau in 1436, but no proof of this is available. The city of Hanau expanded during his reign, into the area of today's Hospital Street. Reinhard II expanded the Late Gothic collegiate Church of Mary Magdalene and increased the number of altar priests. During this period, the Church of Mary Magdalene became the parish church of Hanau, replacing the church at Kinzdorf.  Relation to the Archbishopric of Mainz  During the reign of Ulrich V, Hanau had fallen into ever greater dependence on the Archbishop in Mainz. For example, when the archbishop of Mainz spoke of \\"his\\" city of Hanau, he had obviously – possibly by a mortgage – gained control of the city. Reinhard II's attempts during the early years of his reign, to reverse this trend, were successful. The climax of this development was reached when, after the death of the archbishop in 1419, Reinhard II succeeded in recovering absolute title over the cities of Hanau and Babenhausen. For centuries, the counts of Hanau served Martini wine on certain occasions. There is a legend that this custom was introduced to celebrate Reinhard's recovery of control over Hanau. There is, however, no reliable evidence of this origin. Mainz was more successful in its attempts to expand on the other side of the Main (river): in 1425, the archbishop purchased the district of Steinheim from the Lords of Eppstein. Thus Mainz continued to present a threat to the County of Hanau.  Death  Reinhard II died on 26 June 1451 and was buried in St. Mary's Church in Hanau.

Exact develops cloud-based and on- premises software for industries such as accountancy, wholesale distribution, professional services and manufacturing, serving more than 400,000 companies. Exact, founded in 1984, has its headquarters in Delft. It has subsidiaries and offices in Europe, North America and Asia. The company was listed on Euronext until March 2015, when it was bought up by a group of investors led by Apax and in 2019 by investor KKR. History Exact Head office in Delft Exact was founded in 1984 by Eduard Hagens, Rinus Dekker, Arco van Nieuwland, Paul van Keep, Paul Fijling and Leo Schonk. The six had worked as freelancers for Grote Beer (\\"Ursa Major\\"), one of the first Dutch companies to produce standardized accounting software. When Grote Beer fired all of its freelancers, Hagens et al. started their own business. Their Exact Software would later, in 1994, acquire Grote Beer, which at that time had an annual revenue of ƒ100 million, expanding Exact's customer portfolio to some 60,000 companies. The former company's name was used as a trade mark until 2000. Internationally, Exact grew by acquiring Belgian firms Cobul and Cubic (17,000 customers) in 1989. The opening of offices in the United Kingdom and Russia meant that, as of 1995, 20% of Exact's revenue came from abroad. Expansion into the German market soon followed with the acquisition of Pcas, Bavaria Soft, Szymaniak (1997) and finally Soft Research (1999), German market leader in salary software. In the 2000s, Exact acquired US manufacturing ERP software providers Macola, JobBOSS and MAX. In 2007, Exact purchased Longview Solutions for US $51.5 million. Longview Solutions got sold off to Marlin Equity Partners in July 2014 for an undisclosed amount of money. The mid-2000s saw Exact embroiled in internal power struggles. In 2004, founder Eduard Hagens returned from ten months of sailing round the world, to find his company reorganized in a decentralized way that did not suit his vision of how Exact should be led. Hagens clashed with CEO Lucas Brentjens and CFO Bert Groenewegen, leading to the resignation in September and October of that year of Brentjens, Groenewegen, and subsequently the company's entire board of directors. Hagens's \\"coup\\" (as de Volkskrant put it) caused a staff drain within the company. The following April, after the resignation of the company's new CFO, Hagens announced his own departure. He was succeeded by Rajesh Patel. In October 2014, Exact announced a buy-out by Apax Partners. That acquisition was completed in April, 2015 for a sum of €730 million. The acquisition meant that Exact was de-listed from the Euronext stock exchange, on which it had been listed since 1999. Exact became the personal sponsor of Dutch Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen in 2015. In 2017, Exact acquired the French software vendor Dièse Finance and later the administration software company Reeleezee in the Netherlands. Later that year, Exact sold their American division including Macola, JobBOSS and MAX to ECi Software Solutions. Finally, Phill Robinson was announced as Exact’s new CEO. In 2018, Exact acquired three Dutch companies: Parentix, ProQuro and SRXP.  Products  Exact's rise to market leadership was mostly based on its MS-DOS-based accounting package, also called Exact. The company also launched a Windows version of this package, but this was heavily criticized because it never attained the full functionality of the DOS version, leading many companies to stay with the DOS software into the late 1990s. The Exact package was replaced March 30, 2000 with a new product, Globe 2000. This Windows NT-based product was designed around a modular architecture dubbed \\"One-X\\" that underpinned all of Exact's offerings. Criticism of this software focused on the fact that the One-X architecture was incompatible with the older Exact software, and that it was tied to Microsoft SQL Server, which was considered too heavy of a database management system for the small computers typically used at Exact's small and medium enterprise customers. In 2005 Exact Online was launched, the company's effort to bring Exact software to the cloud. With this product, Exact initially targeted only the Benelux countries, until in May 2010 it announced a joint venture with Turkish software developer Triodor to market its product in Turkey as an experiment. The trial ended later that year, with Exact citing a lack of results and announcing a sole focus on its Dutch and Belgian markets. In 2011 a more extensive version of Exact Online was launched; the focus broadened from accountancy software only to an industry ERP solution. In 2018, Exact Online was expanded with the collaboration tool Exact My[Firm].

It consists of all the software developers, artists, writers, translators, other contributors, and active users of GNOME. It is part of the GNU Project. GNOME Foundation In August 2000, the GNOME Foundation was set up to deal with administrative tasks and press interest, and to act as a contact point for companies interested in developing GNOME software. While not directly involved in technical decisions, the Foundation does coordinate releases and decide which projects will be part of GNOME. Membership is open to anyone who has made a non-trivial contribution to the project. Members of the Foundation elect a board of directors every November, and candidates for the positions must be members themselves. Programs and events The GNOME Project holds several community programs and events, usually tailored to local users and developers. The main gathering of GNOME contributors is the GNOME Users And Developers European Conference (GUADEC), an annual conference used to discuss the development and progress of GNOME. The idea of GUADEC events is attributed to the GNOME developers' and users' Paris meeting of 1998. An annual Asian conference called GNOME.Asia also exists. GNOME also participated in the Desktop Summit, which is a joint conference organized by the GNOME and KDE communities that was held in Europe in 2009 and 2011. Among the project's community programs is Outreachy, established with the goals of increasing women participation and improving the resources available to all newcomers for getting involved in GNOME. Collaboration with other projects The GNOME Project actively collaborates with other free software projects. Previous collaboration efforts were ordinarily organized on project-to-project basis. To make the collaboration broader, the freedesktop.org project was founded. Goals The project focuses on: * Independence — the governing board is democratically elected and technical decisions are made by the engineers doing the work. * Freedom — development infrastructure and communication channels are public, the code can be freely downloaded, modified and shared and all contributors have the same rights. * Connectedness — work spans the entire Free software stack. * People — emphasis on accessibility and internationalization. GNOME is available in more than 40 languages (at least 80 percent of strings translated) and is being translated to 190 languages.

He worked as an anthropologist and archaeologist for the Museo Nacional de Antropología between 1884 and 1888, beginning his excavations at Teotihuacan, working on the Temple of Agriculture and the Pyramid of the Moon. Later he worked at Monte Albán, Mitla, La Quemada, Xochicalco, Isla de los Sacrificios, Mexico City, and more work at Teotihuacan, including his flawed reconstruction of the Pyramid of the Sun. Batres claimed distinguished ancestry, and his father, Salvador Batres was a consul in Germany for President Antonio López de Santa Anna. According to Batres's autobiography, his mother, Francisca Huerta, encouraged his patriotism. Batres joined the Mexican army and was a cavalry officer. In the early 1880s, during the first years of the regime of former army general Porfirio Díaz, Batres went to Paris and studied archeology at the Museum of Natural History under Ernest Théodore Hamy and Armand de Quatrefages, but nothing is known about the nature of his training.Christina Bueno, The Pursuit of Ruins: Archeology, History, and the Making of Modern Mexico, 2016, p. 73, Batres created the first archeological maps of Mexico, one of which was aimed at the 1910 delegates of the International Congress of Americanists, which met in Mexico to coincide with the centenary of Mexican independence. The marking of 110 archeological sites was superimposed on a map of Mexican railway lines. One scholar views the map as highly symbolic, \\"The ruins of antiquity and train tracks of modernity act like joined metaphors, making reference to the past and present and conveying that Mexico is a nation both ancient and modern.\\"Christina Bueno, The Pursuit of Ruins . Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2016, p. 191. Graham Hancock has called Bartres's restoration of the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan \\"grotesque vandalism\\", citing the removal and selling of a layer of sheet mica between two of the upper levels—mined from 2,000 miles away and used for unknown purpose—removing the outer layer to a depth of more than 20 feet, and adding a fifth stage. Hancock argues that because scientific data might have been incorporated into many of the key dimensions, drastically distorting the original shape and size of the pyramid had possibly deprived posterity of some of the most important lessons Teotihuacan had to teach.

Nearby towns and villages include Ali Sabieh (24 km), Ali Adde (19 km) and Guisti (18 km). Demographics As of 2019, the population of Assamo has been estimated to be 1,211. The city inhabitants belong to various mainly Afro-Asiatic-speaking ethnic groups, with the Issa Somali predominant. Climate Assamo features a somewhat rare version of a highland climate with warm, but not hot, summers and cool winters. Due to its 754 m altitude, temperatures are relatively mild for a town located not particularly far from deserts. Characterized by hot and dry summers, and mild to cool winters where most of the precipitation is concentrated (spring and autumn being pleasantly warm transitional seasons). However, due to the town's altitude and inland location, its climate features are the humidity is very low, and temperatures usually fall on 24 °C (75.2 °F) at night, which makes summer particularly pleasant compared to coastal cities. Assamo has a Semi-arid climate (BSh) in Köppen-Geiger system. Agriculture Assamo is noted for its agricultural and farming industry. Crops grown in the area include vegetables and fruits. Significant investments have been made in the industry.

Early life George Frank McLardy was born at 8 Sweden Grove, Waterloo, Lancashire in 1915, the eldest son of a draper, George McLardy, and his wife Mary (née Wood) McLardy. He had two younger brothers. He attended St Edmund's School, Waterloo and St Mary's College, Crosby, where he was a member of the First XV rugby and First XI cricket teams.St. Mary's College Yearbook, 1934 pp 15, 35-39 Academically bright, McLardy progressed into St Mary's College Sixth Form. Upon leaving school in 1934 he studied pharmacy at the Liverpool School of Pharmacy.Founded 1849, now part of Liverpool John Moores University McLardy subsequently moved with his family to live in nearby Formby, where he was articled to a chemist. He qualified as a Member of the Pharmaceutical Society in October 1939. That same year he joined the British Union of Fascists (BUF), becoming first district treasurer, then district leader in Waterloo. McLardy sold the BUF magazine Action around Crosby and Waterloo, and held his BUF meetings in a local public house, The Crosby Hotel. The intelligence service MI5 began monitoring his activities in July 1937. World War II On the outbreak of World War II, McLardy volunteered for the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was posted to Aldershot, and owing to his qualifications, was promoted to the rank of sergeant. On 9 May 1940, he landed in France with the British Expeditionary Force. After pushing as far north as Brussels, his unit was beaten back by the Germans towards Dunkirk. McLardy was captured near Wormhoudt on 31 May 1940. It was suspected that he deliberately became separated from his unit to be captured. He was sent first to Stalag XX-A at Thorn, and soon on to Stalag XXI-A at Schildberg (both in Poland). For three years McLardy remained in Schildberg as an ordinary prisoner of war, performing medical duties for his fellow prisoners in the camp hospital. Around this time McLardy began complaining of \\"heart trouble\\" and \\"ear problems.\\" He hoped for repatriation to the UK. His hopes were dashed in September 1943, however, when he was told that instead he would be moving to Stalag XXI-D at Posen, reputedly the worst camp in Poland. Collaboration McLardy claimed that he \\"would not survive another Polish winter\\", and recalled a conversation with a \\"Dutch officer\\" in Stalag XXI-A who stated that he had applied to join the Waffen-SS with a view to ultimately escape. McLardy approached a surprised Abwehr officer at Schildberg with the request that he might join the Waffen-SS. His application, written in his own hand in English was translated into German, then typed and forwarded to Berlin. It stated \\"I hereby apply to offer my services to Germany in the common struggle against Bolshevism and I express my willingness to serve as a soldier against Soviet Russia.\\" Frank McLardy thus became the first British POW of World War II to volunteer to join the German armed forces. A reply was received three weeks later when an Abwehr guard arrived at the camp to escort him to Berlin. British Free Corps Two early members of the BFC, SS-Mann Kenneth Berry and Sturmmann Alfred Minchin, with German officers, April 1944 McLardy was taken first to Stalag IIID/517S at Genshagen, south of Berlin. This was a \\"holiday\\" or Propaganda Camp established by the Germans in early 1943. Batches of prisoners from other camps were regularly sent there and offered special privileges in an attempt to undermine their loyalty. A recurring dream of Hitler's was the propaganda value of a battalion of British POWs who might be persuaded to go into battle against the Russians. An early attempt at recruitment had ended in abject failure. The Legion of St George had been the brainchild of John Amery. He toured the internment camps of France, distributing leaflets entitled \\"Why die for Stalin? Why die for the Jews?\\" His only recruit was Kenneth Berry, a 17-year-old deckhand from a sunken ammunition ship, and Amery was soon sidelined by the Germans. But a group of men at Stalag IIID now caught the Germans' eye as the potential nucleus for another attempt to form such a foreign legion. Soon to be known as the \\"Big Six\\", they were William Brittain, New Zealander Roy Courlander, Canadian Edwin Barnard Martin, Seaman Alfred Minchin and McLardy. These men were packed off to a requisitioned bierkeller in Pankow, Berlin and placed under the tutelage of Thomas Haller Cooper, a half-German who had already served in the SS Totenkopf and SS Polizei Division and boasted of committing atrocities against Jews and Russian POWs in Poland. The group decided among themselves to change the name of the Legion to the British Free Corps and soon set about designing uniforms and recruitment leaflets. McLardy was given the rank of SS- Unterscharführer, and put in charge of propaganda. Most members of the BFC changed their names on enlistment, and McLardy went under his mother's surname of Wood. He regularly travelled to prisoner of war camps, dressed as a civilian, dropping off leaflets and interviewing likely recruits, claiming that there were two full divisions of the BFC – one, led by British officers, supposedly already fighting the Russians with the approval of the British government. In expectation of a surge of recruits, in February 1944 the BFC were moved to an SS barracks at Hildesheim, a former monastery converted into the SS Nordic Study Centre. The optimistic Germans had 800 Waffen-SS uniforms made, sporting a collar patch with three lions, and a union jack shield on the sleeve together with a \\"British Free Corps\\" armband in Gothic script. Recruits, many realising they had been duped, were subjected to lectures from McLardy on Economics, Bolshevism and the German language, and forced to give Nazi salutes to McLardy and the other ringleaders of the BFC. He would later be described by them as \\"capable and intelligent\\", a \\"fanatical fascist\\", who \\"hoped for a fascist England\\", but \\"a physical and moral coward\\", \\"very anti- Jewish and anti-Russian\\", \\"a very learned man of high education\\", \\"reserved\\", but who when aroused \\"would talk for hours on National Socialism.\\" Some members of the BFC stayed in it merely for an easy time, the beer and the chance to fraternise with local women. Others attempted to sabotage it, or demanded to be sent back to their POW camps. A schism developed in April 1944, when a group took exception to McLardy's increasingly pro-Nazi, anti-British harangues, and fisticuffs ensued. Thereafter McLardy, Courlander and Co. slept in a separate room, under pictures of Hitler, Himmler and the Nazi flag, while newer recruits occupied a room in which a picture of the Duke of Windsor had pride of place. On Hitler's birthday, 20 April 1944, the BFC paraded in full uniform for the first time. The Corps continued to be riven by intrigue with Cooper, McLardy and Courlander all jockeying for control, at odds among themselves and with their German masters. Fewer than 60 men ever joined the BFC and its strength never rose above 27, three below the number Hitler had stipulated as the minimum for it to go into battle. By August 1944, McLardy, realising the British Free Corps was a failure, decided to abandon it and volunteered for the Waffen-SS Sanitätswesen (Medical Corps). Waffen-SS He was posted to the SS medical supply depot at Lichtenberg, and in his own words \\"wore an ordinary SS uniform and lived the life of a German soldier.\\" Towards the end of 1944, McLardy was selected for officer training. He was sent first to Graz, then to Stettin to commence his training. He realised the end of the war was near, and had no intention of becoming part of a last-ditch effort of the SS to defend the Third Reich. On reporting to Stettin in January 1945 he reported sick and was excused duties, and allowed to return to Berlin. McLardy went to the SS Head Office and was offered work at the Rundfunkhaus and with the SS-Standarte Kurt Eggers. Desiring neither, he managed to dupe the SS into granting him leave, thinking he had accepted both. McLardy donned civilian clothes and went to ground in Berlin, living at 33 Sächsische Strasse, while he plotted his escape from the crumbling capital. In early April he learned that the Propaganda Ministry's Büro Concordia was abandoning Berlin for Helmstedt, and persuaded them to take him along. He declined the job of broadcaster, but instead offered to \\"monitor\\" Allied broadcasts. McLardy left Berlin on 10 April 1945. By the time they reached Helmstedt the Reich was falling apart, and after a week McLardy told his associates he was heading for Hamburg. Instead, he posed as a Belgian, and after hiding on a farm at Döhren for two days, surrendered to the arriving Americans. He was handed into British custody on 19 April 1945 and repatriated to the UK on 13 May 1945. Postwar McLardy was charged with voluntarily aiding the enemy whilst a prisoner of war. He was court-martialled at Blacon Camp, near Chester and sentenced to life imprisonment on 1 January 1946.\\"Life Sentence For Aiding Enemy\\", Times, London, 30 January 1946: pg. 2 via Times Digital Archive; accessed 20 March 2015. Security Service files on him are held by the National Archives under references KV 2/251 and KV 2/252. The sentence was later commuted to 15 years, of which McLardy served seven. McLardy received the heaviest sentence of those convicted of membership of the British Free Corps. He served his sentence first at HM Prison Parkhurst, then in open prisons. During his imprisonment McLardy studied for an external degree in chemistry from Cambridge University. Last years Upon his release in 1953, he emigrated to Germany, married a German woman and had two sons. He worked as a pharmacist and died in 1981 at Ingelheim am Rhein, near Mainz, aged 66. In popular culture The British Free Corps is featured in Jack Higgins' World War II thriller The Eagle Has Landed. In 2010, an episode of Foyle's War concerned a member of the BFC put on trial for treason after the war.

One View of Brussels from the castle of Koekelberg (1692, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) shows a bird's eye view of the city seen from the north. When compared with the View of Brussels painted by the Antwerp artist Jan Baptist Bonnecroy about 30 years earlier, van Heil's view shows the city from a greater distance and from a lower viewpoint. The consequence of this is that the buildings are shown in a more compact manner. Only the large monuments are recognisable. Van Heil depicted in the foreground scenes from country life such as horse riders, cowherds, shepherds and peasants.Le peintre et l'arpenteur: images de Bruxelles et de l'ancien duché de Brabant, Musées royaux des beaux-arts de Belgique Renaissance Du Livre, 2000, p. 237 Bombardment of Brussels in 1695 Of the five other views of Brussels by Theodoor van Heil in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, two offer closer views of the city and three picture fires in Brussels.

The square is bounded by Bolotnaya Embankment of the canal to the south, by Serafimovicha Street and the House on the Embankment to the west, and by Bolotnaya Street to the north and to the east. The square had the name of Repin Square, commemorating Russian artist Ilya Repin, between 1962 and 1994. The square is built as a pedestrian open space. History The name of the area, Boloto (literally meaning the marsh), was known since the 14th century, when it was located in the meadows on the low bank of the Moscow River and frequently flooded. It belonged to the district of Zamoskvorechye, south of the river, and became an urban area much later than the left bank of the river, where the Kremlin is located. The square was frequently used for public executions, notably, the famous rebel Stepan Razin in 1671 and Yemelyan Pugachev, a leader of a peasant rebellion, who was executed there in 1775. It was also the last public execution in the square. The area was flooded on a regular basis until the 1780s, when the Vodootvodny Canal was dug to normalize the situation. In the 19th century, the area was built up by the addition houses and warehouses of local merchants, some of which are still intact. In 1958, the monument to Ilya Repin was built in the center of the square. In 1962, the square was renamed Repin Square. In 1994, together with other streets and squares of the historical center of Moscow, it was renamed back to Bolotnaya Square. In 2001, the sculpture group of Children Are the Victims of Adult Vices by Mihail Chemiakin was unveiled on the square.

His wife was a niece of the king's serjeant- painter Robert Streater. His marriage thus brought him powerful connections and a lucrative patronage. He was also patronised by Charles Robartes, earl of Radnor, who reportedly had a large collection of van Son's paintings in his house in St. James's Square.FRANCIS VANSON, or VANZOON (1661—1700), in: Horace Walpole, Anecdotes of painting in England, with some account of the principal artists, and notes on other arts; collected by G.

[With] A catalogue of engravers who have been born, or resided, in England, pp. 437-438 The artist is recorded as living in St Martin in the Fields, New Street Ward, Long Acre North in 1693-94. He may have lived at this location before and after that period. After lived in Long Acre, he finally moved to St. Albans Street, St. James's. The death date of Jan Frans van Son is not known. It is likely he is identical to the Francis Vansson who was buried on 17 January 1701 St. James's Picadilly, London. His death followed shortly that of his daughter Bridget. The 18th century Dutch biographer Jacob Campo Weyerman reported that van Son died out of grief over the loss of his daughter.Jan Frans van Son Biography, p 282 in: Jacob Campo Weyerman, De levens-beschryvingen der Nederlandsche konst- schilders (Volume 3, 1729), on Google Books It was believed earlier that he died after 1704 on the basis of this date appearing on a work attributed to him in the Palais des Beaux-Arts of Lille.

His style is more in line with that of his teacher Jan Pauwel Gillemans the Elder and some paintings formerly attributed to a follower of Jan Pauwel Gillemans the Elder have been re- attributed to him. This includes three still lifes at the Dulwich Picture Gallery. These works likely were part of a larger set of interior decoration and were probably intended as overdoors and as an overmantel.Jan Frans van Son, Still life with fruit and a bird at the Netherlands Institute for Art History When Weyerman moved to London, van Son had recently died. Weyerman took over his unfinished flower paintings and sketches and finished them.The Netherlands Institute for Art History erroneously states that van Son influenced Gilliam Dandoy, an artist who died before he was born.

The station's broadcast license is held by Palmer Johnson, Inc. The station was established in 1972 as \\"WHMT\\". In December 2014, WJPJ moved its studios from temporary quarters to a prominent commercial space at 1405 East Main Street, Suite One, Humboldt. In February 2015, WJPJ reprised \\"Swap 'N Shop,\\" a live, call in show Monday through Saturday from noon till 1 PM. Shortly afterwards, the popular old time radio show \\"When Radio Was\\" began airing 7 days a week from 11 AM till noon. In April 2016, WJPJ began airing \\"Blended Gospel\\" from 5:00 am–midnight every Sunday. This Gospel programming is unique in that it mixes together Southern Gospel, Black Gospel and Contemporary Christian music integrated with Scripture, prayer, and clean humor. Various church programming is available during these times as well. In May 2016, WJPJ acquired an FM channel to simulcast their AM signal: 99.9 FM W260BA. The signal reaches farther than AM and with a clearer signal. Recently, the \\"Viking Spotlight\\" has begun airing LIVE every Thursday morning from 9:30 to 10:00 am with hosts Seth Wilkerson (Classic Hits Radio Manager) and Emily Burleson (Communications Director for Humboldt City Schools) and is replayed every Saturday from 4:00 to 4:30 pm. Personnel General Manager/News Director: Seth Wilkerson Sports Director/On Air Personality: Andrew Thurbush Production Director/On Air Personality: Blue Hoyt Programming/On Air Personality: Alex McCommon Chief Engineer: Palmer Johnson Programming Authorized by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast only during daylight hours, the station signs off each night at sunset to protect the signals of KEX in Portland, Oregon, and XEWK in Guadalajara, Jalisco, from skywave interference. From August 2006 until falling silent on November 16, 2009, the station then licensed as \\"WLLI\\" broadcast a classic country music format branded as \\"Willie 1190\\" with some of the station's programming provided by Citadel Media. The station returned to the air on August 26, 2010, with new call sign \\"WHUN\\" to broadcast a gospel music format branded as \\"Joy Christian Radio\\" to the greater Jackson, Tennessee, area. The station fell silent again on December 1, 2011, for financial reasons and a sale to Palmer Johnson, Inc.. In August 2012 1190 in Humboldt was returned once again to daily operation with programming designed to serve the local community of Humboldt under the new call sign of WJPJ. The new ownership had attempted to obtain the original call sign of WHMT but was unable to do so, as those call letters had been assigned to another station. History WHMT era The station began regular broadcast operations on July 5, 1972, as \\"WHMT\\" with 500 watts of power on a frequency of 1190 kilohertz and licensed to serve the community of Humboldt, Tennessee. The station was owned and operated by Communications Associates, Inc., and broadcast a country & western music format throughout the 1970s. In September 1982, license holder Communications Associates, Inc., agreed to sell WHMT to R.B. Management Corporation. The transaction was formally consummated on November 9, 1982. This arrangement would prove short-lived as in January 1984, R.B. Management Corporation applied to transfer the broadcast license to Boyd Enterprises, Inc., owned by F. Darrell Boyd. The FCC approved the deal on March 1, 1984, and formal consummation took place on May 15, 1984. In October 1988, station management filed a petition with the FCC to reduce their broadcast power from 500 to 420 watts and increase the height of their broadcast antenna. This move would allow the station to cover the same geographic area with lower electricity costs. The FCC granted the station a construction permit for these changes on January 10, 1989, with a scheduled expiration date of July 10, 1990. However, construction was completed before the end of January 1989 and the WHMT applied for a new broadcast license to cover these changes. The FCC granted the station the revised license on August 22, 1989. WLLI era In April 2006, Boyd Enterprises, Inc., reached an agreement to sell WHMT and sister stations WLSZ and WLSQ-FM to Forever Communications, Inc., subsidiary Forever South Licenses, LLC, for a combined sale price of $1.3 million. In addition, Boyd Enterprises would receive $80,000 per year for 10 years in return for agreeing to a non-compete clause. The FCC approved the sale on June 7, 2006 and the deal was formally consummated on July 31, 2006. The new owners had the FCC assign the station call sign \\"WLLI\\" on November 1, 2006, to match the \\"Willie 1190\\" branding of the station's new classic country music format. On November 16, 2009, WLLI's signal went dark for financial reasons, with the license holder asserting that the station's expenses \\"far out weigh the very little revenue it generates\\". Predicting a lengthy shutdown, the station applied to the FCC for special temporary authority to remain silent. This authority was granted on November 20, 2009, with a scheduled expiration of May 19, 2010. The local programming aired on WLLI was moved to co-owned WTJJ (94.3 FM). WHUN era The station swapped call signs with Forever Communications-owned WHUN in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, on February 8, 2010. The Pennsylvania station began carrying a country music format branded as \\"Willie 1150 AM\\" while the Tennessee station sat silent and seeking new ownership. Citing the financial effects of the late-2000s recession, in July 2010, Forever South Licenses, LLC, contracted to donate the WHUN broadcast license to the nonprofit organization Joy Christian Communications, Inc. The FCC approved the transfer on September 3, 2010, and the deal was formally consummated on September 13, 2010. The station resumed normal broadcast operations on August 26, 2010, with new owners, a new call sign, and a new gospel music format. However, Joy Christian Communications' tenure as owner of WHUN was short-lived as in June 2011 they agreed to sell the station to Palmer Johnson, Inc., a company \\"100% owned\\" by Emry Palmer \\"P.J.\\" Johnson, for a total price of $10,000. The sale was approved by the FCC on December 1, 2011, and , is awaiting formal consummation. Johnson also owns WTRB (1570 AM) in Ripley, Tennessee. With the sale nearing completion, WHUN management notified the FCC on November 8, 2011, that the station would be signing off temporarily for financial reasons starting December 1, 2011, and sought special temporary authority to remain silent. The FCC granted this authority on November 30, 2011, with a scheduled expiration of May 28, 2012. WJPJ era After being sold to Palmer Johnson, Inc. on June 1, 2012, the station changed call signs once again, taking on the identifier \\"WJPJ\\". In August 2012 WJPJ returned to the air under the new ownership with a classic hits format. On April 20, 2018 WJPJ changed their format from classic hits to Christian radio, branded as \\"Good News Radio\\".Grace Broadcasting Shuffles Formats in Jackson TN Radioinsight - April 20, 2018 References External links * * JPJ Category:Radio stations established in 1972 Category:Gibson County, Tennessee JPJ Category:1972 establishments in Tennessee JPJ ","title":"WJPJ"},{"id":"34012835","text":"The 2012 CAF Champions League qualifying rounds decided the eight teams which played in the group stage.

This caused criticism of the conservative Lee Myung-bak government for encouraging institutionalized censorship and abuse of authority. The Supreme Prosecutors' Office of the Republic of Korea (SPO) was criticized for being overly-supportive of the Blue House. Background University instructor Park Jeong-su vandalized a G-20 promotional poster by drawing a rat before the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit. There was concerns that he was released under the court orders despite the SPO over-pressuring his investigation to cater the ruling party. \\"Rat\\" was the popular nickname of then-President Lee Myung-bak. The letter \\"G\\" in \\"G20\\" is a homophone to \\"rat\\" in Korean. The Non-governmental organization citizen group called the People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy planned to present his incident to the 16th meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. He later argued in his own defense that his rat drawing of the South Korean president has artistic merits. He was later fined. This has caused disputes of whether freedom of speech is legally upheld in South Korea. Reactions Lee Chang-dong had petitioned against the prosecution of Park Jeong-su. Some netizens proposed to pay his fine by selling T-shirts of his rat drawing. Remarks Park later remarked \\"after I experienced this incident, despite the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech are mandated by law, I feel that the political authority dictates both of them in reality\\".

It was formed in 1872 at the initiative of the Neubrandenburg Museum Society (Neubrandenburger Museumsvereins) founded for that purpose. The catchment area and operation of the museum, whose name changed several times in the course of history, was regionally oriented from the start. In 1873, the society opened a permanent exhibition on the history of the region in the main tower of the Treptow Gate (Treptower Tor) in Neubrandenburg. It was the first civic museum in the county of Mecklenburg- Strelitz. Until the mid-1930s the museum remained in the hands of the society and did not transfer to the town until the society wound itself up under Nazi pressure. Until 1989 the Neubrandenburg Museum, as the Historical District Museum (Historisches Bezirksmuseum), took on leading roles for other museums in the district of Neubrandenburg. Today the Neubrandenburg Regional Museum fulfills the role of the municipal museum for Neubrandenburg with several exhibition sites, a number of initiatives and extensive collections.

Her father, who worked in the local textile mill, encouraged Freda and her brothers and sisters at a young age to actively participate in different sports. As a teenager, she began playing amateur softball for the textile teams and excelled as a hard-throwing pitcher. After high school graduation, she married John Lewis Acker in 1944. In November 1946, Fredda Acker was named Mrs. America 1947 in replacement of Janice Pollock, , original winner of the contest, who had to decline a six-month tour of the country as part of her reward because of her husband's disapproval.Harvard Extension School Writing Program – Spring 2003, Charles River Review: Pageantry, by Rachel E. Pollock The first AAGPBL spring training outside the United States was held in 1947 in Havana, Cuba, as part of a plan to create an International League of Girls Baseball. The league hired Acker to assist in a charm school and fashion show during the trip. At the time, the Brooklyn Dodgers trained in the Cuban capital because Jackie Robinson, who would be the first Afro-American to play in the Major Leagues, was training with the Dodgers for the first time. By then, city ordinances in Vero Beach, Florida, where the Dodgers normally trained, prevented blacks and whites players from competing on the same field against each other. Notably, newspaper stories from Havana indicate that the All-American girls drew larger crowds for their exhibition games at Estadio Latinoamericano than did the Dodgers.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball LeagueAAGPBL Charm School.

Listed at , , she batted and threw left-handed. A hard-throwing, underhand pitcher, Thompson had a brief but solid career during her four years in the AAGPBL. Since the only organized ball for women in the country was softball, the AAGPBL created a hybrid game which included both softball and baseball. Over the 12 years of history of the league, the rules were gradually modified to more closely resemble baseball. Throwing underhand, Thompson was unable to make the transition to full sidearm in 1947 and overhand pitching in 1948. Throwing multiple underhands, Thompson went on to play in the National Girls Baseball League of Chicago where she played until 1951. Early life Thompson, the daughter of Henry Justice and Mae Abercrombie Thompson, was born and raised in Anderson County, South Carolina, where she attended school through high school. She attended Anderson Girls High School and graduated in 1939 and played softball there. Anderson Girls High School would later become part of T.L. Hanna High School. She was born into a large family with six brothers, all but one of whom served in the military, and four sisters. Viola Thompson and all of her siblings either played softball or baseball. Several of her siblings played tennis, some played basketball, and her brother Carlisle, later went on to become a boxer in the Golden Gloves amateur league. Her sister, Fredda Acker, would go on to be named Miss America in 1947. Her sister Margaret went on to become Miss South Carolina USA in 1960. Their father, who worked in the local textile mill, encouraged Viola and her brothers and sisters at a young age to actively participate in different sports. Upon graduation, she moved to Greenville, South Carolina, where she worked in the textile mill and played amateur softball for the company's team. She pitched in the textiles league for both men's and women's softball teams and was also the athletic director of the mill she played for.Griffin, 01-09-15http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/33d21d3f While at Greenville, Thompson met Elizabeth Mahon, a talented player with the same passion for baseball, with whom she started a close friendship. Eventually, Thompson played in Greenville on the same team with Mahon. By then, a talent scout offered Thompson and Mahon an invitation to come to the newly formed AAGPBL tryouts, which were to be held at Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois. With the prospect of making the $60 per week that was being paid to the members of the established teams, which was a vast sum of money then, the two Greenville girls decided to try their hand in the new circuit, obtaining full-time jobs in the AAGPBL for the 1944 season. Thompson was assigned to the Milwaukee Chicks, while Mahon joined the Minneapolis Millerettes, becoming the only South Carolina ballplayers in AAGPBL history. Mahon died in 2001 at the age of 82. Baseball career In her rookie season, Thompson posted a 15–12 record and a 2.88 earned run average as part of a pitching rotation that included Connie Wisniewski (23–10, 2.23) and Josephine Kabick (26–19, 2.66). The Chicks, with Max Carey at the helm, won the pennant and defeated the Kenosha Comets in the championship series. Although the Chicks won the championship, they had no local financial backing and could not compete with the American Association Milwaukee Brewers. In fact, the Chicks were forced to play all seven games of the series at Kenosha's Lake Front Stadium because the Brewers were using Borchert Field in Milwaukee. In addition, the high ticket prices charged for AAGPBL games failed to encourage significant fan support. Due to lack of community support and skepticism of journalists, the Chicks moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan prior to the 1945 season. Thompson slumped to 11–19 in 1945, even though she collected a low 1.90 ERA in 260 innings pitched for the renamed Grand Rapids Chicks. Nevertheless, she rebounded the next year with the South Bend Blue Sox and went 15–6 with a 2.90 ERA in 31 games. She appeared in only one game for South Bend during the 1947 season as the league moved entirely to sidearm pitching. Her younger sister, Fredda Acker, joined her on the team as an overhand pitcher in that season but never appeared on the All-American roster, perhaps to safeguard her award-winning looks. Organizers of the AAGPBL did not want Viola's sister Fredda to join the league once she was crowned Miss America for publicity purposes. Their minds were changed once they saw how well Fredda could play.\\"Girls of Summer\\" 1992 Lois Browne In the late 1940s, league rules changed to make the league more \\"strictly baseball.\\" The bases were pushed back and pitchers began pitching overhand. Many of the existing female pitchers were not strong enough to pitch overhand so girls started to be pulled in from third base or the outfield to pitch, and pitchers were rotated to the outfield. If they were unsuccessful in the outfield many would try to pitch for a team in Chicago, where underhand pitching was still used. Thompson played in Chicago for a few years until she decided to retire from baseball and go home. She was disappointed by the way the league changed saying, \\"They had a great game, and I don't know why they were never satisfied, they just wanted to improve and improve.\\"Carter, Robert, The Forgotten Champs: The 1944 Milwaukee Chicks of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. March 1995 - permalink Post-playing career In 1948, Thompson was transferred to the National Girls Baseball League of Chicago, where she played through the 1950 season. Following her baseball career, she returned to South Carolina and married Claude Griffin in 1954. The couple had two daughters, Claudia and Carol. Thompson went to work as a supervisor in a textile plant and retired in 1984. She did not participate in or even discuss women's baseball publicly again until the Baseball Hall of Fame's AAGPBL tribute exhibit was unveiled at Cooperstown, New York in 1988. After that, she was interviewed by filmmaker Penny Marshall to get a personal account of her own experiences in the league for the 1992 film A League of Their Own, starring Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, Madonna, Lori Petty, and Rosie O'Donnell, which brought the AAGPBL into the public eye. Thompson claims that she was disappointed by the way that Tom Hanks portrayed the manager. Originally she was intended to have a speaking part in the film. However this became impossible due to union rules. Instead she served as an adviser for the film and she appears as an unpaid extra. Clips from her playing days appear during the end credits of the movie. Thompson passed away December 31, 2017, just two days short of her 96th birthday.In Memory of Viola Thompson Griffin Awards and honors In 1993, Thompson was granted the privilege of the floor of the South Carolina Legislature for her contributions to professional baseball and women's sports. In 1998, she was inducted into the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame. The resolution passed by the Legislature is quoted as the following \\"Congratulating Viola Thompson Griffin, for her contributions to baseball and women's sports and allowing her the privilege of the floor of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, March 2nd, 1993, at a time to be determined by the speaker\\".http://www.scstatehouse.gov/query.php In 2001, Thompson was inducted into the Grand Rapids Sports Hall of Fame. Closer to home, in 2010, the Boy Scouts of America of Belton, South Carolina, honored her with a \\"Community Leader Award\\". In 2014, T.L. Hanna High School, which was previously Anderson Girls High School and Anderson Boys High School when Thompson attended, in Anderson, South Carolina, honored Viola for her athletic achievements at the school by inducting her into the Athletic Hall of Fame. There are two awards set up in her name that are presented every year at the Belton-Honea Path High School in Honea Path, South Carolina to MVP softball players of the school. Thompson has thrown out ceremonial pitches for the Anderson University (South Carolina) Softball Team, Greenville Drive Minor League Team, and the Silver Bullets Professional League where Braves player Phil Niekro caught for her. The Belton Historical Museum in Belton, South Carolina opened a permanent exhibit honoring Viola in June 2015. On January 26, 1993, she received the Order of the Palmetto award. This award recognizes lifetime achievement and service and is the highest honor for civilians awarded by the Governor of South Carolina.

Established in 1974, the current president of the FMEEC is the Rev Dr Andrea Zaki. History Early cooperation Protestant churches and missions were one of the early proponents of ecumenism and inter-church cooperation in the Middle East. In 1911, an inter-Protestant effort was initiated in Beirut leading to the establishment of the United Missionary Council in 1920. A parallel development occurred in 1924 when a Conference for Workers in Moslem Lands was convened in Jerusalem leading to the eventual formation of the Western Asia and North Africa Council in Helwan in 1927. Other early cooperative efforts that stemmed from these early initiatives were the Missionary Conference of Syria and Palestine and the Missionary Conference of all Egypt. These various groups eventually united as the Near East Christian Council in 1927. Near East Council of Churches As missionary influences gradually reduced, the Near East Christian Council took on a more indigenous flavour. As amicable contact and informal cooperation between the Protestants and the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox continued to develop, the Syriac Orthodox Church established formal cooperation with the Protestants in 1962 and enlarged council became known as the Near East Council of Churches. Middle East Council of Churches In 1964, dialogue began to form a larger ecumenical organisation in the Middle East incorporating the various Church traditions present in the region. This meant that the Protestants had to intentionally take a smaller administrative role in coordinating inter-church work. The result of this dialogue was the establishment of the Middle East Council of Churches in 1974. A Protestant specific fellowship was also retained and became formally known as the Fellowship of Middle East Evangelical Churches in the same year. Current developments Efforts continue to be made to establish full fellowship and communion between the member churches of the FMECC. In 1997, the FMECC tabled a Proposal for the Unity of the Evangelical Churches in the Middle East but failed to achieve agreement between the member churches. A renewed effort was made in 2005 focusing on member churches of the Reformed and Lutheran traditions and in 2006 an agreement was reached in Amman for full communion was reached with the signing of the Amman Declaration of Lutheran and Reformed Churches in the Middle East and North Africa. The declaration established the mutual recognition of baptism, eucharist, ministry and ordination between the signatory churches.

TCI was cofounded by Jim Lobdell. Reactions to Islamic content Conservative outlets have objected to the presentation of material in the textbook. In 2003, J Weekly, a Northern California Jewish news blog, highlighted the book's adoption in a Santa Rosa, California high school. After a parent complained about anti-Israel bias, the Jewish Community Relations Council reported on the problems in the book, then sent it to Alan Dershowitz, who concurred. The region's Anti-Defamation League also got involved. By the following year, TCI planned to update the book. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency noted the Council on Islamic Education and the Islamist, anti-Israel scholar Ayad Al-Qazzaz both consulted on the creation of History Alive, while the Jewish community had failed to present a similarly unified review of textbooks. In 2005, Daniel Pipes, described as an Islamophobe or anti-Arab propagandist, and creator of Campus Watch, published a comment on his site about Islamic indoctrination in the History Alive textbook, which was being trialed in the district, as did Cinnamon Stilwell in the SF Chronicle; Stilwell is a conservative commentator who has written for Campus Watch. It was then picked up by Little Green Footballs, which was a conservative site at the time, by the far-right Islamophobic site FrontPage Magazine, and by other conservative blogs, which also claimed the book had an anti-Jewish bias. A group called The Textbook League said that TCI had consulted with Islamic Networks Group, which it called \\"a Muslim propaganda agency\\". By a month later (March 2005) the district had received enough emails and expressions of concern that they stopped their trial of the textbook. The revisions to the textbooks were discussed in November 2005 at the California State Board of Education, which voted to allow History Alive and other textbooks with compliance to lists of revisions. TCI covers Islam as part of Medieval history, and covers other major world religions in the previous year of study's History Alive! textbook, since that is the historical era during which the respective religions developed.

Route The highway starts at Lorneville (where it continues from ), where it passes over the Wairio Branch railway line runs to the north of the Underwood freezing works to arrive in Wallacetown. The road then crosses the Oreti River and proceeds over gently rolling farmland, passing through Wrights Bush and Waimatuku (and bypassing Waianiwa and Thornbury) until it reaches Riverton, where it crosses the Aparima River. The road begins to get more hilly and after passing through Colac Bay, skirts the boundaries of the Longwood Range. The roads curves more to the north around Pahia and passes through the settlement of Orepuki before turning more inland to run parallel with the Waiau River.

Appleton and Company. p.114  Life  José Jacinto Milanés was born into a poor family. His mother's name was Rita Fuentes, and his father was Álvaro Milanés, a peasant at the Real Hacienda. Since an early age, during the elementary school years, José Jacinto Milanés showed an impressive talent in literature. His father, despite the poor means of living, presented him with a gift, which was a book titled El tesoro del parnaso Español (The Treasure of the Spanish Parnassus), a compilation of poems authored by the poet Manuel José Quintana. Milanés's brother said upon remembering the event that: \\"He received the gift with tears of happiness\\"Lezama Lima, José; Esteban, Ángel; Salvador, Álvaro. Antología de la poesía cubana: Siglo XIX, Volume 2 (2002) p.204 Verbum Editorial., From that moment forward, Milanés devoted himself to read many works of classic literature and poetry. Among the authors he read copiously were such figures like Lope de Vega and Calderón de la Barca. When he was twelve years of age, Milanés was reading in both English and French languages, and he started taking classes of the Latin language with Professor Guerra Betancourt. Milanés mastered the Latin language in such a way, that whenever Betancourt needed to travel outside Matanzas, he would appoint his apprentice José Jacinto Milanés to be in charge of the entire class. Milanés started working since a young age, first as a clerk while living in Matanzas, and later as a blacksmith's helper in Havana. He stayed there in Havana until 1833, and returned later to Matanzas. Once he was back in Matanzas, he meets Domingo del Monte, known for being a Literature critic and writer, who tends a helping hand to Milanés by loaning books to him, and inviting him to participate in discussion groups where he could meet other writers.Smith, Herbert Johnson's universal cyclopedia. (1894). A. J. Johnson; Appleton. p. 114. Shortly after, through the friendship with Domingo del Monte and the influence that Del Monte exerted in the city, Milanés was able to start working at a railway station as a secretary. A job position which would allow him to improve his living conditions considerably. He died 1863 and is interred in the Necropolis San Carlos Borromeo, Matanzas. A few years later, in 1837, Milanés 's first poems were published in Havana by Ramón de Palma and José Antonio Echevarría in the Aguinaldo Habanero, a literary magazine. Milanés 's writings received an immediate and undivided attention from critics and the public nationwide. The popularity of his first poems, and the warm reception which it received, made other magazines in Matanzas like El álbum, El plantel in the year 1838, and the Yumurí, publish the poems right after.Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Volume 4 edited by James Grant Wilson, John Fiske (1888). D. Appleton and company. p. 320 In 1838 the autodidactic skills he was endowed with, along with the studies that later fomented his literary career, paid off tremendously. His masterpiece \\"El Conde Alarcos\\" was published that same year. In the words of his longtime friend but literary critic nonetheless, Domingo del Monte, who was quoted saying after the publication of the book, that it was \\"the first writing in Cuba by a Cuban… in which genius is discovered.\\"(\\"el primer escrito en Cuba por un Cubano… en que se descubre ingenio\\").Brickhouse, Anna.

On November 01, 2012 it was announced the game was shutting down on November 30. Gameplay Global Warfare is set in a near-future world of warring city-states. As a General, players are in charge of their own city- state and army. Players can establish alliances to assist in rebuilding their cities and battling for global domination. Each city has been destroyed by war, the player has six days to rebuild the city's defences, research upgrades and enable the production of advanced armies. A seven-day grace period is given when players start a new game. This period is used to prepare for war and establish alliances. One the grace period is over the player's city becomes a potential target for attack but the player can launch attacks of their own. The game places emphasis on building alliances with other players, those who fail to form alliances are vulnerable to massed attack from multiple rival players. Alliances can attempt to capture resources as a group, or send reinforcements should one of their number come under attack from a rival. Reception Nicole Tanner of IGN notes that Kabam's experience with their previous titles allowed them to \\"perfect the formula\\". However, she points out lack of story and similarity with developer's previous titles. Jeremiah Leif Johnson of Gamezebo also points out that while the game is good, it is very similar to the previous titles.

For several years, the house was rented to Eugene Meyer, who then bought it in 1934. It was bought by non-profit organization Meridian International Center in 1987. History Renowned architect John Russell Pope designed the house and completed it in 1912. Henry White, an American diplomat and a retired ambassador to Italy and France, purchased the property in 1910. He hosted numerous social events during his stay, inviting well-known guests, including Georges Clemenceau, Robert Cecil, Henry Cabot Lodge and President Warren Harding. In 1917, Henry White lent the house to the French mission of Marshal Joseph Joffre to use as its headquarters. While the French flag flew outside of the residence, Marshal Joffre used the house to host high-level strategic meetings. Many important conversations were had at the dining room table, including conversations that led to the establishment of the U.S Department of Health, Education and Welfare. When Henry White died, the house was passed on to his son John Campbell White. Financier Eugene Meyer rented the home while he was Chairman of the Federal Reserve (1930–1933), after which he bought the bankrupt Washington Post at auction. In 1934, Meyer bought the house from White for $355,000. During their ownership of the home, the Meyers hosted many prominent guests, including Eleanor Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Adlai Stevenson, Thomas Mann, Earl Warren and Saul Alinsky. After the Meyers' deaths, the house became the property of the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Foundation, which then leased the house to the Antioch Law School Library. In 1987, Meridian International Center purchased the property. Timeline * In 1918, Senator Peter G.

Architecture White-Meyer house is considered historically significant due to its past guests and because architect John Russell Pope created it, the White- Meyer building was the first of the two houses created. It was designed and built between 1910 and 1912 the house totaled the cost of $155,547 dollars, the Georgian revival style mansion holds 40 rooms and sits atop Meridian Hill surrounded by a tall brick enclosure with an opening on the North side of Crescent Place. The garden plaza contains most of the original garden including yews, magnolias, weeping hemlocks and witch hazels that were originally planted by the Meyer family. A path of brick and pebbles leads to an iron gate with a circle, which represents the meridians and connects the White-Meyer House to the Meridian House. An extensive renovation of the house in 1988 won the American Institute Award for Excellence, the house's architectural integrity and original garden were preserved as much as possible the original fireplaces were preserved while the house's walls and ceilings were renovated.

He batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed (12 stone 12). Career Fisher's professional career lasted for 12 seasons (1947–54; 1956–59). In 1949–50, with the New Orleans Pelicans of the Double-A Southern Association, Fisher batted .397 and .423 in successive seasons, although, as a pitcher (and part-time outfielder in 1950), he was well short of enough at bats (58 and 156, respectively) or plate appearances to win the SA batting championship.Minor league statistics from Baseball Reference He appeared in 18 Major League games with the –52 Pittsburgh Pirates — ten as a pinch hitter and eight as a pitcher. In his first trial with the 1951 Bucs, Fisher was used exclusively in a pinch hitting role, going hitless in three at bats. In 1952, he began the season with the Hollywood Stars of the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League until his recall by the Pirates.

The week before he died, when he saw his last article in the Patriarchal Magazine, he said: “I don’t like death to break my pen, because the Church and our youth still needs my pen, but may God’s will be done”. Metropolitan Mor Julius Yeshu Cicek lived with him for three years in Mardin and he remembers: \\"He was such a spiritual loving man, always praying. It was enough to see him, to be with him, to live with him. We were living and praying together. He was a man of God, a living example, which is better than words and long talks. Dolabani was a missionary-minded man. After the end of the persecution of the Armenian and Syriac Christians in early 20th century, he ordained many number of priests, monks and deacons, and send them to very remote areas as far as 'Bitlis and Van' where the faithful had lost their clergy and forgotten about Christianity. Dressed as lay people, they baptized so many Syriac and also Armenian Christians who had no more clergy. Sebastian P Brock recalls a meeting with the Metropolitan: \\"I met Bishop Philexinos Dolabani once, a few years before he died, and he has always greatly impressed me, both as a man of great holiness and as a tireless scholar in the service of the Syriac Orthodox Church.

The former private residence, whose previous occupants include a musician, several politicians, and a mountain explorer, now serves as a historic house museum and headquarters of the Woman's National Democratic Club (WNDC). History The Shingle style home was designed by local architect Harvey L. Page in 1892 and completed two years later. The original owner was opera singer Sarah Adams Whittemore, the daughter of Reverend Henry Adams, a descendant of President John Adams. In addition to Whittemore, past occupants include Senator John F. Dryden (1903), railroad entrepreneur and chairman of the Isthmian Canal Commission Theodore P. Shonts (1906-1907), and Representative John W. Weeks (1907-1911). In 1907, Canadian Rockies explorer Walter Wilcox inherited the house, and lived there from 1911 to 1926. The following year the home was purchased by the WNDC. In 1967, the addition of a ballroom on the Q Street side of the building was completed. The concrete Modernist expansion was designed by architect Nicholas Satterlee, whose work includes Holmes Run Acres. The Whittemore House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and is designated as a contributing property to the Dupont Circle Historic District.

Over the past years, these programs have shown increasing enrollment, reaching over 300 students. Furthermore, members of the Ottawa Youth Orchestra regularly qualify for the National Youth Orchestra of Canada. The OYOA has ongoing partnerships with the National Capital Commissionhttp://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/celebrate/winterlude Official Winterlude concert and the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra.http://www.ottawasymphony.com/ Joint concert History The Ottawa Youth Orchestra was founded in 1960 for the purpose of bringing together talented young musicians of the Ottawa area for the purpose of gaining experience in ensemble and orchestral playing through weekly rehearsals and performances before live audiences. Since that time the orchestra was active continuously, usually presenting four public concerts each season. Each year auditions were held in September and rehearsals began immediately. The Orchestra operated as a night school class under the Continuing Education Division of the Ottawa Board of Education and a nominal fee was charged. The Membership was limited to those from 12 to 24 years of age. The demand was such that in 1971 an Associate Youth Orchestra was founded under the direction of J.K. Lussenburg with rehearsals being held at Canterbury High School. In 1980, the Associate Ottawa Youth Orchestra was conducted by Dwight Rudisuela. In 1982, John Gomez and colleagues from the National Arts Center Orchestra founded the National Capital String Academy to address this need. The National Capital Wind Academy was formed in 1985 to provide similar opportunities to wind and brass players. The two groups merged in 1986 as the National Capital Strings and Wind Academy, and re-established the Ottawa Youth Orchestra which had been dormant for six years. The organization was incorporated as the National Capital Music Academy in 1988, and has gradually broadened its program over the years to become one of the most comprehensive of its kind in Canada. As it entered its twenty-first year of operation under founding Music Director John Gomez, the National Capital Music Academy changed its corporate name to the Ottawa Youth Orchestra Academy (OYOA). The new name better reflects our goal to provide young people with orchestral training opportunities while also honouring our origins, which go back 50 years. Description The original purpose in founding the Academy was to fulfill a need in the community for the training of young string players in ensemble playing. What has evolved not only fully meets this need but also provides the same opportunities to woodwind, brass and percussion students. The enrollment in the Academy is now about 350 and includes some of the best young musicians in the area. The Academy also offers a summer camp program. For all these musicians, aged between 3 and 18 years, the Academy adds the discipline, excitement, and satisfaction of working in ensembles to the solo study of their instruments. To effectively support such an ambitious program, the Academy has established a full teaching structure providing instruction on the playing of strings, percussion, woodwinds, and brass instruments in an ensemble. The conductors and coaches are themselves all participants in the musical life of Ottawa, and many are also regular performers at the National Arts Centre. The students of the OYOA regularly perform in the Kiwanis Music Festival, as part of their regular ensembles and also in smaller ensembles, as well as individually. In the past years, the students have represented the National Capital Region provincially and nationally as a result of winning their class in the local festival. In addition to a well supported season of concerts featuring the OYO and OJYO, the OYOA sponsors two free family concerts each year at which all the ensembles perform.

The chiral (absolute configuration S) version of this compound is an intermediate to launched retroviral drugs.Venkata Mandava, et al., \\"Preparation of fosamprenavir calcium\\" U.S. Pat. Appl., 20110224443 (2011)  Synthesis  3-Hydroxytetrahydrofuran was prepared in 1910 by Pariselle via cyclization and hydrolysis of 3,4-Dibromo-1-methoxybutane. Chiral 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran (both (S) – and (R)-forms) has been synthesized in high enantiomeric purity from (S)- and (R)-1,2,4-butanetriol, respectively, obtained from chiral feedstocks. Thus, the chiral (S)-1,2,4-butanetriol intermediate was cyclized to chiral (S)-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) catalyst at temperatures of 180−220 °C. Similarly, (S)-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran was prepared in 95.8% optical purity from L-malic acid via an esterification-reduction-cyclodehydration sequence. 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran has been synthesized via hydroboration of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydrofuran employing various borane reagents and chiral 3-hydroxytetrahydrofurans have also been prepared by catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydrofurans with a borane in the presence of a homogeneous chiral platinum complex, followed by oxidation.Anita Schnyder, et al., \\"Preparation of optically active 3-hydroxytetrahydrofurans by catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of dihydrofurans\\" Ger. Offen., 19807330 (1998) Racemic 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran may be prepared in analogous fashion from racemic butanetriol, employing PTSA catalyst for the dehydrocyclization. Alternatively, 1,2,4-butanetriol may be converted to 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran by treating with ethylene carbonate, followed by pyrolysis of the resulting carbonate ester.  Applications  3-Hydroxytetrahydrofuran is an intermediate to the AIDS drugs amprenavir and fosamprenavir. Additionally, 3-OH THF has been an intermediate to developmental drug substances, such as chemotherapy agents. For example, reaction of phosphorus pentasulfide with 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran has been used in the synthesis of bis(O,O-di(tetrahydrofuran-3-yl)hydrogen dithiophosphate)platinum(II), a cisplatin analog.Anthony Lowe, et al., \\"Dithiophosphato platinum complexes for the treatment of cancers\\" PCT Int. Appl., 2005095425 (2005) 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran may be converted into a range of tetrahydrofuran derivatives, many of which also serve as intermediates to compounds of pharmaceutical interest. For example, tetrahydrofuran-3-one (3-ketotetrahydrofuran) and 3-aminotetrahydrofuranLiren Jin, et al., \\"Process for preparation of (R)-3-aminotetrahydrofuran\\" Faming Zhuanli Shenqing Gongkai Shuomingshu, CN 1660829 A 20050831 (2005) have been synthesized from 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran and used in pharmaceutical syntheses.

The single reached a peak of No. 22 in the UK and became the band's 5th UK Top 40 Single. Lead vocals are provided by Paul Heaton, with co-vocalists Briana Corrigan and Dave Hemingway featured occasionally in the background. Heaton's lyrics deal with a man named 'Old Red', clearly a man suffering with alcoholism, as Heaton has at several times in his life. The verses detail Old Red's drinking habits and how it is affecting his health (\\"he pours another drink and listens to his body thaw\\") before the final verse announces \\"Old Red, he died...\\" The chorus reminisces about the things he has sacrificed for his drink: \\"all the things I could have done instead\\". The subject matter is a common theme throughout the Beautiful South's material, but \\"Old Red Eyes Is Back\\" is arguably the most graphic account of the perils of alcoholism amongst their song catalogue. The music video is fittingly set in a pub and features two Paul Heatons. One, a sober looking man who sings the lyrics telling the story of 'Old Red'. The other, who sings the chorus, is presumably meant to be 'Old Red', with messy long hair and his face looking rough from heavy drinking.

In the first issue of The Colorado School of Mines Magazine, an article described Stuart's appearance at the \\"first night\\" in the school gymnasium in September 1910: \\"Coach Ted Stuart, in a stirring talk, impressed upon the men the absolute necessity of all who were physically able putting on a suit and coming out and trying out for the team and staying out. He stated emphatically that he did not want 'quitters,' but wanted men with the 'Mines Spirit.'\\" Stuart also wrote a lengthy article in the same issue about the 1910 rules changes. Stuart noted: In two years as the head coach at the School of Mines, he compiled a record of 4–9. In March 1912, the School of Mines Magazine reported on Stuart's departure as head coach: \\"The position of head coach for football has been held by Ted Stuart, who is connected with a law office in Denver and consequently can not devote his entire time to the team. For this reason, and for matters of economy, as well as the fact that Johnston is fully qualified to take entire charge, the change was made.\\" Family and later years In 1906, Stuart returned to Chariton, Iowa, where he practiced law with his father until 1910. In 1910, he moved to Denver and began practicing law there. From 1911 to 1912, he served as the assistant attorney general of the State of Colorado. Stuart was married to Bettina B.

Development Snyder was a podiatrist in South Bend, Indiana. He was inspired in 1926 by the gliding properties of heel-lifts to develop a full size aircraft. Experimentation was performed on balsa-wood aircraft, followed by wind testing on the hood of a car, at South Bend Central High School and finally at Michigan University. Students at the school, led by S. M. Pierce, tested and built a wood and fabric glider based on the designs. Design The glider featured two wooden parallel trusses running along its spine, with two widely spaced truss wing spars. Wing ribs were attached to the spar with varnished shoelaces. The wing shape featured a straight leading edge with the trailing edge tapering back to the tail giving it a distinctive \\"Half Pie\\" appearance from the top. The vertical stabilizers were low, but ran the full length of the fuselage on either side with small canard like control surfaces at the leading edge. The aircraft had conventional landing gear. The pilot sat in a small \\"bucket\\" embedded in the center of the wing. A clear plastic leading edge helped ease the poor downward visibility. The internal volume of the wing was so large that Snyder planned on using Helium to assist in buoyancy, giving it the name \\"Dirigiplane\\" in several publications. The assisted lift concept was never applied to the glider though. Operational history The first flight was an accidental launch by policeman Bert Olmstead. The glider was test flown 49 times by Glen Doolittle (cousin of the famous Jimmy Doolittle). The glider was towed aloft via auto-tow and was filmed by Pathé News. Raoul Hoffman was brought in to re-engineer the glider with the addition of a used Henderson Motorcycle engine and stronger Nicholas Beasley landing gear salvaged from an experimental design built by Milt Hatfield in exchange for flying lessons. The result was renamed Arup (short for Air and Up!). The underpowered aircraft was test flown and exhibited poor controllability, but flew without any major incidents.

It is whitish in colour, with brown patches, and grows to a total length of around . It lives on soft sediment such as fine sand at depths of , from northern Norway to the west coast of Ireland, including the North Sea, and as far south as the southern Bay of Biscay.Bachelet, G.; Dauvin, J.-C.; Sorbe, J.C. (2003). An updated checklist of marine and brackish water Amphipoda (Crustacea: Peracarida) of the southern Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic). Cah. Biol. Mar. 44(2): 121-151 Description Nototropis falcatus has a laterally flattened body and grows to a length of about . It is whitish with patches of brown. The head has a small acute rostrum and wavy-edged lateral lobes. The compound eyes are large, especially so in the male. The first antenna of the female is about one third of the length of the body, and the second antenna is slightly longer than the first; the antennae of the male are longer than those of the female. The pereon or thoracic segments are short while the pleon or abdominal segments are long. The first three pleon segments are either smooth or have a small notch or tooth on the rear margin. The third pereiopod or thoracic leg is particularly stout and has a curved propodus (penultimate joint) and powerful dactylus (claw); the fourth pereiopod is smaller; in males, these two legs have long, plumose setae (bristles). The basal segments of the first three pleopods or abdominal legs are much enlarged. The abdomen ends in a short telson, cleft for three quarters of its length, which is flanked by uropods to form a tail fan. Ecology This amphipod can swim using its abdominal legs and orienting itself on its side and can also burrow in the soft substrate. It probably feeds by grazing on plant material and consuming detritus.

KBS Morning Drama is a TV slot that aired dramas at 9 am from Monday to Friday at KBS 2TV. Due to poor ratings, the slot was abolished twice, from October 7, 1991 to October 3, 1992 for about one year, and from October 10, 1994 to March 1, 1996 for about one year and four months. On November 4, 2011, it was abolished again after the end of ', and TV Novel's Dear My Sister aired on the time slot instead. Following the end of Through the Waves and the TV Novel series, this time slot has been revived again with Lady Cha Dal-rae's Lover airing on 2018, 7 years following the discontinuation. This time slot has been quickly cancelled again and replaced by reruns of KBS1's daily dramas.

In 1895 this group exhibited in the Kunsthalle Bremen and at the Glaspalast in Munich, which brought them national recognition. In 1900 the poet Rainer Maria Rilke travelled to Worpswede and befriended the artist's colony, eventually writing essays about each of its members. He volunteered for the army at the outbreak of the First World War, serving in an infantry regiment. On 10 April 1918 he was severely wounded near Mesen and taken to the hospital in Stettin, where he died. His grave is preserved in the Worpswede Cemetery.

The squirrel boy then asks, \\"Whose footprints are these?\\". The girl squirrel tells him, \\"The Gruffalo\\", and so the squirrel boy tries to tell his mother that the gruffalo was there. However, the Mother Squirrel doesn't believe them until she tells her two children a story of how the Gruffalo escaped from the mouse. The story begins with the Gruffalo's daughter attempting to follow a hedgehog, because she just wants to explore the outside world. Her father, however, does not want her to do that. He warns her against going outside and tells her about the time when he met the mouse. He describes the mouse as a monster, and the daughter imagines the mouse to be just as her father depicts it. One snowy night, however, the Gruffalo's daughter decides to explore the outside world, and she begins to follow some footprints. On her journey through the deep dark wood, she meets first the snake and later the owl and finally the fox, realizing that the monster doesn't exist. She then begins to cry, and wishes to be back with her father when suddenly, she runs into the mouse. The mouse tells her that the monster is real, and he makes a scary shadow on the branch of a hazel tree. The Gruffalo's daughter runs away to her father's cave, but the shadow-like mouse begins to follow her. In the cave of the Gruffalo, she is now comfortable at her father's side.

Running between the settlements of Richmond (south of Nelson) and Collingwood, it is long and lies entirely within the Tasman District. It is the northernmost highway in the South Island and is a popular tourist route, servicing Motueka, Abel Tasman National Park, Golden Bay, and Farewell Spit. Route The highway starts at Richmond at a roundabout junction with SH 6 and proceeds in the northwesterly direction across the Waimea Plains. Near Mapua, the road deviates onto the Ruby Bay bypass (Mamaku Drive) and emerges on the shores of the Moutere Inlet adjacent to Tasman Village. The highway then passes along the edge of Motueka Estuary and through the major town of Motueka. Just past Riwaka, the road to Kaiteriteri and Abel Tasman National Park branches off to the right while SH 60 branches to the left. The highway then rises towards Tākaka Hill (elevation 791 metres above sea level) and the notorious Eureka Bend. The highway then descends into the Tākaka Valley and passes through the town of Tākaka. The highway then hugs the coastline of Golden Bay before terminating just outside the township of Collingwood.State Highway 60 on Google Maps History At first there was no road connecting the coastal areas about Bronte, Mapua and Tasman. Early settlers had roads from landing sites on Waimea Inlet and along ridges, and they avoided crossing the peripheral swampy valleys. When the Coastal Highway was constructed it was gravel and the Inland (Moutere) Highway was the main highway. At some point in about the 1970s, the coastal route became the main route. In 2003, the terminus at Collingwood was curtailed 1.1 km to the intersection of Collingwoood-Bainham Main Road. Until 2010, before the construction of the Ruby Bay bypass, SH 60 followed the coastline around Mapua.

The square has the shape of an arc running from the southwest to the north and is bounded by Manezhnaya Square to the southwest, Okhotny Ryad to the north, and the buildings separating it from Nikolskaya Street to the south and to the east. It is one of the Central Squares of Moscow. The continuation of the Revolution Square north behind Okhotny Ryad is Teatralnaya Square. There are three Moscow Metro stations located under the square, all of them having at least one exit at the square: Ploshchad Revolyutsii, named after the square, Teatralnaya, and Okhotny Ryad. All these stations are transfer stations, with Teatralnaya being connected with the other two. History Originally, the Neglinnaya River, a tributary of the Moskva River, currently underground, was flowing through the area. Between 1534 and 1538, the wall of Kitay-gorod with Iberian Gate and Chapel was constructed. In 1817-1819, the Neglinnaya was rebuilt as a tunnel, and thus the area became a square. It got the name of Voskresenskaya Square (Resurrection Square), after the other name of Iberian Gate, Resurrection Gate. In 1918, the square was renamed after the October Revolution. In 1931, Iberian Gate was demolished (rebuilt in 1994-1995), and in 1935, Hotel Moskva was built on the northern side of the square, separating it from Okhotny Ryad. The road traffic was subsequently separated, so that traffic from Tverskaya Street in the direction of Lubyanka Square followed Revolution Square, and road traffic in the reverse direction followed Okhotny Ryad. In 1993, all road traffic around the Moscow Kremlin was made unidirectional (in the clockwise direction), and Revolution Square ceased to be a through road. It is now mostly used for parking. Notable buildings Hotel Metropol and Revolution Square. * Hotel Metropol, located in the northwestern side of the square at the corner with Teatralny Lane, was built in 1899-1907 and is considered one of the finest Art Nouveau buildings in Moscow. * Hotel Moskva, located at the northern side of the square and separating it from Okhotny Ryad, was built between 1932 and 1938 by Alexey Shchusev and demolished in 2004 despite being recognized as a monument of architecture. Construction of a new building has been completed, and the new hotel, rebranded as Four Seasons, has the same appearance as the old one. There were allegations of mismanagement and fraud related to the construction. * The building of Lenin Museum, built in 1890-1892 by Dmitry Chichagov, originally was used as Moscow City Hall. It separates Revolution Square from Red Square. * Resurrection Gate was built in 1535, rebuilt in 1680, demolished in 1931, and rebuilt in 1994-1996. It connects Revolution Square with Red Square.

It was renovated and expanded for government use in 2008-2009 and is now known as the Townsend Justice Center. Description The Townsend Hotel is a five-story brick edifice in the heart of downtown Casper, Wyoming. Although the first story has a square floorplan, the remaining floors have E-shaped layouts, originally allowing all of the 135 guest rooms to have exterior walls and windows. The front façade is made of cast stone, mixed red and burgundy bricks, and some plaster. The first two stories are grey cast stone, and the remaining stories are brick. The sides and back of the hotel reveal the exposed concrete infrastructure with a red brick infill, which has since been stained to match the front. Although double-hung windows were originally placed around the building, they have been replaced with their single-paned counterparts. History Rear of building, 2014The hotel was built on the original location of the William Anthens pioneer homestead.\\"Former Resident Incentive for Numerous Parties\\". Casper Star Tribune, p4, 27 Sept 1931. Casper, Wyoming. Accessed on Newspapers.com on 11 May 2020. (https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15203228/casper-star-tribune/) The hotel structure was built in 1923 by Charles H. Townsend, a prominent local settler and businessman, and was designed by architects Garbutt, Weidner & Sweeney. It was one of three grand hotels built in the downtown area of Casper and the only one still standing, the others being the Henning Hotel and the Gladstone Hotel. The Townsend served as an important hub in the early social and political life of Casper. It hosted the Casper Rotary Club and other local organizations, and was used by the USO and commissioned officers during World War II. By the 1970s, however, the hotel had deteriorated to the point that it was closed in 1982. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 25, 1983. The building was purchased by Realtor Betty Luker in the late 1980s, then sold to Jan Gray in 1998. In 2002 the hotel was bought by Townsend Properties LLC, which gutted the structure and removed all the asbestos in 2006. On January 2, 2007, the building was purchased by the government of Natrona County. The building was renovated throughout 2008-2009 for use as a courthouse. A substantial addition was built on the building's north side, with a mixed brick scheme echoing that of the hotel's façade. In late 2009, the building was opened as the Townsend Justice Center. It now houses the district court offices and the clerk of county court, formerly located in the old courthouse across the street; along with the Natrona County Circuit Court, moved from the fifth floor of the Hall of Justice. Remaining from the hotel's glory days, the lobby's original marble staircase is still intact, although it simply stops at the ceiling. Some of the marble from the hotel's interior was re-purposed, and a ghost sign advertising the hotel was kept on the back of the building.

The series is named after the Chōjū-giga scrolls. Plot Long ago, high priest Myōe, had the ability to make anything he drew come to life. This ability scared the villagers of his town, and made him an outcast. In his mountain home he drew a variety of things, not least of which was a surreal town called . One of his drawings, a rabbit named Koto, whom he drew as the God of the Mirror Capital, came to life upon striking a deal with a Bodhisattva. Lady Koto managed to win the love of Myōe. After finding a war orphan, Yakushimaru, and taking him under their wing as an adoptive child, the family dimension hop to Kyoto for a better life. Myōe draws two siblings for Yakushimaru. Yase, and Kurama. The five of them live happily together until Lady Koto, having fulfilled her end of the deal with the Bodhisattva, has to be taken away. With their time as a family at its end, Myōe leaves Yakushimaru the title of high priest, and his prayer beads, telling him that he will return with the beginning and the end in tow. Years later Yakushimaru runs Kyoto as part of the Council of Three with Yase and Kurama as they await the return of their mother and father, a girl who bears resemblance to both Myōe and Koto, whose name is also Koto, finds her way into Kyoto, a feat never before achieved. Koto spends her days in Kyoto living with Myōe, searching for a way to return home, while also trying to find clues about her own family. Eventually Kurama manages to hatch a plan with the use of the adamantine giant Bishimaru and Koto to force open the gate leading to Kyoto, allowing Lady Koto to return. Her return however threatens to destroy the entire multiverse, and draws the negative attention of the Shrine, a mysterious organization that acts to keep the peace of the multiverse. Characters ; : :The main protagonist, a 14-year-old girl who fights with a variable size hammer, named Aratama (荒魂). Koto is a carefree and hyperactive girl who is searching for a black rabbit in order to return home with her familiars, while also searching for clues that will reunite her with her family. She spent her childhood as a student in the Shrine, and is very adept at combat. ; and : (A), Ryoko Shiraishi (Un) :A and Un are two brothers who are Koto's familiars whom she inherited from her master. Their name means 'the beginning' and 'the end', respectively. Koto refers to both of them as \\"Ah-un\\". A, like Koto, is hyperactive, while Un, on the other hand, is much more reserved. They both appear as chibi middle school students, but can transform into red and blue monsters who can fly and possess supernatural strength. They both wear black blazers over red hoodies, black pants and black shoes. ; / :, Chiwa Saito (young) :A young but grumpy Buddhist monk who looks after Koto and her familiars while waiting for his adopted father and mother, the original Myōe and Lady Koto, to return. He is one of the members of the Council of Three. Before the original Myōe had left and granted him the title of Myōe, his name was Yakushimaru. Yakushimaru had committed suicide upon the death of his family when the original Myōe found him. Determined to make Yakushimaru a part of their family, the original Myōe drew him a pomegranate that revived and bestowed him with immortality, and siblings, Yase and Kurama, to make him feel better. However, after his parents left, Myōe became detached from his new life and responsibilities, and his sole wish became to finally die. He uses the prayer beads his father had given him alongside the title of Myōe to fight. ; : :An oni who often hosts tea parties at her estate in the forbidden zone outside of the city. Though generally having the appearance of a polite, refined and very wealthy young lady, she will shape shift into a raging monster if she becomes irritated. Yase is one of the members of the Council of Three. She is originally a drawing by the original Myōe. She adores her mother Lady Koto, and awaits her return. ; :, Ryoko Shiraishi (young) :An elderly looking Buddha who is usually seen levitating on a large sake saucer. Kurama carries out most administrative duties in Kyoto. As a child Kurama wished to see the world outside of Kyoto, but Myōe, knowing how humans might treat Kurama, forbade it. For this reason Kurama actively seeks to find a way out of Kyoto. Kurama is Shōko's boss and one of the members of the Council of Three. He is originally a drawing by the original Myōe. ; : :A young girl who wears goggles and a white lab coat. She works under Kurama and is in charge of safekeeping Bishamaru, the adamant giant. Shōko is head of Kyoto's forces, who are all drone like men who wear white suits and resemble mafia. She is cocky and often uses her authority in large and obstructive ways, such as mobilizing her entire force and blockading much of Kyoto to find the replaceable controller for Bishamaru. Shōko also dislikes Koto, or anyone who disrespects her authority, or touches anything of hers. ; : :Shoko's assistant. Fushimi frequently puts up with Shōko's antics, but is secretly amused by them. He is also a close friend and confidant of Kurama. Although he works for Kurama, he is related to the Shrine in some way. ; / : :A priest with the strange ability to make anything he draws come to life. Myōe is a caring man, but was ostracized by the villagers for his supernatural powers. Myōe moves into the mountains and eventually into the Looking Glass City before he has to leave his family. After Myōe leaves Kyoto, he relinquishes his title to Yakushimaru, and later becomes Inari. Inari has the appearance of a younger Myōe, and wears a fox mask and carries a katana. After Koto is born, Lady Koto had given her all her strength as a Bodhisattva, and as a result, she is unable to sustain herself well on different planes. Inari is forced to take care of Koto alone, and teaches and guides her as she grows. Although Myōe loves his family dearly, he has little love for himself, and hopes to eventually disappear. He later identifies himself as \\"God\\" given that he can create entire worlds, reveals that his brother is the High Priest, and that their father was previously acting as God as well. What he means is not that he is God, but to the denizens of the worlds he creates, he might as well be and because he recognized he was human and imperfect, he felt the responsibility was too great. ; : :A black rabbit born from the original Myōe's drawings who fell in love with him and accepted the offer of a female Bodhisattva to lend her a human body in order to confess her feelings for him. She then lived with Myōe and adopted Yakushimaru. She also took Yase and Kurama as her children and together, they moved to the Looking Glass City. Koto eventually has to be confined to a desolate moon because she cannot sustain her presence anywhere else very well after her daughter Koto inherits all her powers.

He was noted for his aggressive and dogmatic style of criticism, linked to a nationalistic and sometimes antisemitic agenda. His later work was heavily influenced by Nietzsche's theory of the übermensch. Life Carl Bleibtreu, 1909 Bleibtreu was born in Berlin, the son of the battle painter Georg Bleibtreu. After abandoning his studies in 1884 at the Faculty of Arts in Berlin, Bleibtreu travelled all over Europe, visiting Belgium, Hungary, Italy and the UK. In the same year he became editor of the Kleinen Tagblatts, a Berlin newspaper. From 1885 he worked as a freelance writer in Berlin-Charlottenburg, where he met Michael Georg Conrad, with whom from 1888 to 1890 he worked on the magazine Die Gesellschaft: realistische Wochenschrift für Literatur, Kunst und Leben (Society: realistic weekly for literature, art and life). In 1886, he published the work which made his name, Revolution der Literatur. This proposed a programmatic body of literature dedicated to an Émile Zola-style of systematic naturalism. In 1890, together with Konrad Alberti, Bleibtreu founded the Deutsche Bühne (German Theatre) in Berlin, as a rival to the then important Freie Bühne (Open Theatre). The project was not very successful and failed shortly thereafter. From 1908 he lived in Zurich. Literary theory Bleibtreu was considered an important representative of naturalism in German literature. This he promoted as an editor, producer, director and critic. His writings were characterized by their intolerance of opposition. He saw himself as an educator and leader of German literature, often as its saviour. As a result of his excessive self-centeredness and egotism he acquired both friends and many enemies. He described himself as a poet and genius turned into a great statesman or commander. Like his friend Michael Georg Conrad, he waged a lifelong battle against contemporary literary critics. Literary critics, in his eyes, were of great importance for the success of an author, because they had power to make or break reputations. He described himself as an anti-Semite and suspected a conspiracy of the Jewish press. Bleibtreu insisted that critics should evaluate only the real quality of a literary work and not - as so often in this period - judge on the basis of aversion to the author or his morals and political intentions. In Revolution der Literatur Bleibtreu described this demand in his characteristically lurid style: > If Shakespeare had been the greatest villain [...], would we be less > committed to admire him? By heaven! If Jesus Christ showed me bad poetry, I > would thrash him mercilessly, all my moral respect and adoration > notwithstanding.\\"Bleibtreu, Karl, Revolution of Literature, 3rd edition, S. > XVII. Original \\"Wenn Shakespeare der größte Schurke gewesen wäre […], – > wären wir minder verpflichtet, ihn zu bewundern? Beim Himmel! Wenn Jesus > Christus mir schlechte Gedichte vorlegte, ich würde ihn erbarmungslos > vermöbeln, all meiner Ehrfurcht und moralischen Anbetung unbeschadet.\\" He stated that he did not care whether an author was poor or rich, but only respected talent. His literary-critical style was arrogant and insulting, using humiliating and contemptuous expressions for his opponents. He argued that new German literary forms should follow closely on the Sturm und Drang movement. This new movement should represent realism. Bleibtreu's worldview was shaped by heroism, nationalism, machismo and pessimistic world-weariness. At the height of his career, he even claimed that his work should be regarded as the nucleus of future literature. In reality, his influence was limited only to the short period from 1885 to circa 1890. After the publication of Gerhart Hauptmann's naturalist drama „Vor Sonnenaufgang“ (\\"Before Dawn\\") Bleibreu's call for \\"revolutionary literature\\" seemed to be fulfilled. However, from that point on he wanted nothing more to do with \\"consistent naturalism\\" („konsequenten Naturalismus“), which he even called \\"so-called realistic imitation of the Jewish school.\\" He envied the successful new authors, as their success marginalized him.Hartmut Baseler: Gerhart Hauptmanns soziales Drama „Vor Sonnenaufgang“ im Spiegel der zeitgenössischen Kritik. Eine rezeptionsgeschichtliche Modellanalyse: Karl Frenzel, Theodor Fontane, Karl Bleibtreu, Wilhelm Bölsche. Kiel: Univ. Diss. 1993. His later writings show the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche. He entitled his book on Byron, Byron der Übermensch in reference to Nietzsche's theories in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. However, he characteristically belittled other writers who appropriated Nietzschean rhetoric, commenting on the poet Greta Meisel-Hess that, > Everyone today wants to speak with Zarathustra's tongue...even Meisel-Hess > showers out poems in Nietzsche's mode in her rhapsodic masturbation.Carol > Diethe, Nietzsche's women: beyond the whip, Walter de Gruyter, 1996, p. 128. After 1890, he was mainly involved in the writing of historical novels and books on military issues, especially the Napoleonic era. In 1907 he wrote Der Wahre Shakespeare, a book proposing that Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland was the true author of the canon of William Shakespeare, after an earlier critic had suggested that he may have written the comedies.Wadsworth, Frank (1958).
