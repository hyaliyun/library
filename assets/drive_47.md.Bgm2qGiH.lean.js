Title explained  Although the novel is called Some of Tim‚Äôs Stories, Tim is never mentioned in any of the stories. In an interview conducted by Teresa Miller, founder and executive director of the Oklahoma Center for Poets and Writers, S.E Hinton explained: ‚ÄúTim is the author of these stories. I took a roundabout way of writing in first person, using a narrator who writes his stories in third person...[Tim] went to a community college...got interested in short stories and decided to write about his life.

The principal use is for securing web sites with HTTPS, but there are also applications in many other fields. Compared with conventional certificates, a wildcard certificate can be cheaper and more convenient than a certificate for each sub-domain. Multi-domain wildcard certificates further simplify the complexity and reduce costs by securing multiple domain and their sub-domains. Example A single wildcard certificate for will secure all these subdomains on the domain:  * Instead of getting separate certificates for subdomains, you can use a single certificate for all main domains and subdomains and reduce cost. Because the wildcard only covers one level of subdomains (the asterisk doesn't match full stops), these domains would not be valid for the certificate: * The \\"naked\\" domain is valid when added separately as a Subject Alternative Name (): * Note possible exceptions by CAs, for example wildcard-plus cert by DigiCert contains an automatic \\"Plus\\" property for the naked domain .  Type of wildcard certificates  Wildcard certificates are categorized on the basis of validation level, number of domain and number of servers it can be used with. Likewise they are named as domain validation wildcard certificate, organisation validation wildcard certificate and extended validation wildcard certificate when we categorize them according to validation level. The name Multi-domain wildcard certificates and Multi-server wildcard certificates are given according to number of domain and number of server. All types of wildcard certificates signed by popular CAs are categorized and listed internet. Therefore there are types of wildcard which can secure multiple domains, multiple servers and provide different levels of validation. Limitations Only a single level of subdomain matching is supported in accordance with .Wildcard SSL certificate limitation on QuovadisGlobal.com It is not possible to get a wildcard for an Extended Validation Certificate. A workaround could be to add every virtual host name in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension,x509v3_config Subject Alternative NameThe SAN option is available for EV SSL Certificates on Symantec.com the major problem being that the certificate needs to be reissued whenever a new virtual server is added. (See Transport Layer Security ¬ß Support for name-based virtual servers for more information.) Wildcards can be added as domains in multi-domain certificates or Unified Communications Certificates (UCC). In addition, wildcards themselves can have extensions, including other wildcards.

Jenkins noted that many literature classes in schools are embracing appropriation. A common example of appropriation at its finest is Ricardo Pitts-Wiley's \\"Moby- Dick: Then and Now\\", a contemporary reworking of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick narrative. Fundamental to appropriation is the idea that knowledge is socially constructed and that the student plays an active role in its construction.Cook et al (2002), Grossman et al (1999) Appropriation has occurred when the student has adapted the information in a way that is meaningful to them and they can use the knowledge as their own.Cook et al (2002), Grossman et al (1999), Johnson et al (2003) Activity theory Appropriation in education is often understood and analyzed through activity theory. This theory was developed by Aleksei N. Leontiev and focuses on understanding the socio- cultural context (specifically the setting) learning occurs in.Cook et al (2002), Hung (1999), Johnson et al (2003) Activity theory is predicated on the assumption that a person's frameworks for thinking are developed and carried out in specific settings,Grossman et al (1999) and that these settings mediate cognitive development.Johnson et al (2003) Since appropriation also places a strong emphasis on setting, these theories complement each other when being used to analyze learning environments. Process of appropriating knowledge HungHung (1999) has developed steps through which the appropriation of knowledge usually occurs. The process is as follows: ; 1. Growing into (submitting): the student recognizes the differences between their beliefs/knowledge and the beliefs/knowledge of the teacher. The student accepts the teacher as the leader and submits to their beliefs, knowledge and rules. ; 2. Dependency (mirroring): The student adapts strategies to help submit to the beliefs, knowledge and rules of the teacher. The student questions the teacher and other students and begins to co-construct and negotiate meanings. ; 3. Growing out of dependency (constructing): the student experiments with the beliefs, knowledge and rules co-constructed with the teacher and other students and uses these ideas outside of the classroom. The student discovers patterns, ideas, concepts and beliefs inherent to the learning community and applies them to other environments. Five degrees of appropriation Through research with English teachers, Grossman et al.Grossman et al (1999) developed a theory to describe the varying levels of appropriation. The degrees ; Lack of appropriation: the student has not appropriated the knowledge. This may occur because the concept being taught is too difficult for the student to comprehend or is too foreign to fit into the learner‚Äôs prior frameworks at that point in their development. ; Appropriating a label: the student knows the name of the concept but knows none of the features. ; Appropriating surface features: the student knows most of the features of the concept, but does not understand how those features contribute to the conceptual whole. ; Appropriating conceptual underpinnings: the student grasps the theoretical basis that informs and motivates the use of the concept and is able to make use of the concept in new contexts and for solving new problems. This is the level of appropriation that teachers and students should strive for. ; Achieving mastery: the student has the skills to use the concept effectively and to its fullest effect. This should also be strived for, but would likely to years of practice to achieve. =Factors affecting the degree of appropriation= There are a variety of factors that can affect the level of appropriation that the student achieves. Some of these factors are: *The role the student plays in the learning process: students that play an active role in their learning process are more likely to appropriate knowledge.Grossman et al (1999), Johnson et al (2003) *The social context of learning: this refers to the environment where the student learning, the values and expectations implied in the learning environment, how the knowledge is introduced by the teacher, and the social practices that occur in the learning environment. A more positive learning environment will most likely result in higher degrees of appropriation.Grossman et al (1999) *Individual characteristics of the student: this includes the beliefs, goals, expectations, and motives of the student. The closer a student‚Äôs values align with those of the teacher, the more likely a student will appropriate the knowledge.Billett (1998), Grossman et al (1999), Johnson et al (2003) A student‚Äôs motives also affect the degree of appropriation. Students who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to reach a higher level of appropriation.Poleman (2006) *Interest and knowledge of the teacher: a teacher who appears more interested and/ or knowledgeable in the content being taught is more likely to influence appropriation in their students.Poleman (2006) Outcomes of appropriation Through appropriation students construct their own versions of knowledge, allowing internalization of the information they have learned.Billett (1998) Their beliefs and behaviours concerning the concepts learned also change.Poleman (2006) These transformations alter the student‚Äôs conception of the information, which will affect how that information is given to others interacting with the student.Billett (1998), Cook et al (2002), Johnson et al (2003) How knowledge is transferred from one person to the next is an important aspect of appropriation and demonstrates the collaborative aspect of appropriation, where knowledge is constantly being negotiated with other.Billett (1998) Collaboratively, students and teachers construct knowledge in a way that is meaningful to them.

The colony operated under the Charter until May 1686 when Thomas Dongan, the governor of New York, received instructions from King James II that New York would be assimilated into the Dominion of New England. After the Glorious Revolution William III and Mary II appointed a new governor, who convened the colonial assembly on April 5, 1691.  Background  James, the Duke of York and the colonial proprietor of New York, was in exile in Brussels and Edinburgh from 1679-1681 during the Exclusion Crisis. Upon his return to England, he appointed Dongan to succeed Edmund Andros as governor of New York. Dongan‚Äôs instructions, which were sealed by James on January 27, 1683, specifically directed Dongan to hold elections for a colonial assembly. Several factors contributed to James decision to extend representative government to his colony. First, James was operating from a position of political weakness in England. He had been forced into exile by fears surrounding his succession and, although his brother Charles II had largely assuaged the fears of the exclusionists, there was still general popular uneasiness with his Catholicism. Second, the early 1680s were a time when legal opinions were generally in favor of the independence of local assemblies. In 1677 the Lords of Trade had tried to restrict the Jamaica assembly by writing Poynings' Law into the governor‚Äôs commission. This would essentially reduce the Jamaica assembly ‚Äì as Poynings' Law had reduced the Irish Parliament ‚Äì to merely approving laws initiated in the English Parliament with no original powers of its own. In response, William Jones ‚Äì the attorney general of England ‚Äì issued an opinion holding that the people of Jamaica could only be governed by laws made there under the King‚Äôs authority. Third, New York was suffering from poor economic and political conditions in the early 1680s. As a result of these problems, Dongan was presented with a petition for representative government by the people of East Hampton upon his arrival in the summer of 1683. Although this petition could not have directly influenced James' decision to allow for an assembly (since he had issued the instructions more than 6 months earlier), it is indicative of the general feeling of unrest in the colony at the time. These factors, combined with the fact that every other colony had a local assembly, convinced James that the calling of an assembly was the only way to ensure stability and prosperity in the New York. In addition, recent struggles in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in which the colonial assemblies in those colonies asserted their right to representative government and to certain individual liberties informed the subsequent actions of the New York Assembly. Viewed in this light, the passing of the Charter is another instance of colonists attempting to carve out more space for themselves in their relationship with their proprietor.  Approval and Revocation  The Charter was approved by Dongan and his council, and on October 31, 1683, it was published by voice at City Hall. A year later, James had signed the Charter in England, but the death of Charles II and James‚Äôs ascension to the throne caused the Charter never to be delivered to New York. Instead, James was convinced ‚Äì from his new perspective as sovereign ‚Äì that the Charter gave colonists in New York rights and privileges that were too broad. The investment of legislative authority in the governor, council, and ‚Äúpeople‚Äù in the general assembly, for instance, was broader than in other colonies. Further, James felt that the Charter made the governor too dependent on his council, and that the insistence on triennial legislatures put a greater obligation on that government than on any other colonial one. As a result, James did not confirm the Charter. Instead, he assimilated New York into the newly formed Dominion of New England under Governor Edmund Andros. However, it was not until May 1686 that Dongan received a new set of instructions declaring that the Charter be disallowed. In the interim, the colony operated as if the Charter were in place, with the assembly meeting for a total of three times. Upon receipt of his new instructions, Dongan read them to his council but not to the assembly, which was not called again.  Effects of the Glorious Revolution  In 1689, after word that James had been overthrown reached the colonies, Bostonians rose up and overthrew Andros, and New Yorkers ‚Äì led eventually by Jacob Leisler ‚Äì rose up and took control of the colony from Lieutenant Governor Nicholson. By 1691 William and Mary had appointed Henry Sloughter as the new governor, and he convened a new assembly which enacted ‚ÄúAn act for declaring what are the rights and privileges of their Magesties‚Äô subjects inhabiting within the province of New York.\\" See also *New York General Assembly  References   External links  * http://www.montauk.com/history/seeds/charter.htm *https://history.nycourts.gov/about_period/british-colonial-charters/ Category:Pre-statehood history of New York (state) Category:Thirteen Colonies documents ","title":"Charter of Liberties and Privileges"},{"id":"33692965","text":"Vema is a genus of deep-sea molluscs, monoplacophorans.

At Flint, he gained a reputation for his goal-scoring, although he did \\"tend towards rough play\\". His older brother, Arthur, played as goalkeeper for Flint and died from injuries sustained during a match in August 1891, thus becoming the first known fatality in modern Welsh football. In 1896, he moved to England spending a year at Port Sunlight in the Wirral & District League before he was signed for Glossop North End. Described as \\"good in the air and possessing a rasping shot\\", Bartley \\"infused bite and determination into the (Glossop) forward line\\". Glossop NE were backed by Samuel Hill-Wood with ambitions of reaching the Football League. Having finished as runners-up in the Midland League in the 1896‚Äì97 season, they could only manage to finish ninth in Bartley's first season. Despite this, they were invited to join an expanded Football League Second Division, finishing as runners-up in 1898‚Äì99. Bartley played in Glossop's opening match in the Football League in September 1898 against Blackpool. During his one season in the Football League, Bartley made seven appearances, scoring twice. He didn't play in the First Division and in the summer of 1899 returned to North Wales to spend a year at Llandudno. Bartley's solitary international appearance came in March 1898, when he replaced Thomas Thomas for the Home Championship match against England; the match finished 3‚Äì0 in favour of England. In 1901, he returned to Lancashire where he settled at Newton-le-Willows for the rest of his life. He joined Earlestown, where he became known for his \\"splendid ball control\\" and heading ability. In particular, he was renowned for his ability to place a corner kick under the crossbar, providing scoring opportunities for his fellow forwards. Described as \\"a great utility player\\", he was able to take over from an injured player anywhere on the pitch. Later career During World War I, Bartley enlisted in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. He later worked as a wood machinist in a railway wagon works. He remained associated with the Earlestown club for the rest of his life, spending some time on the club committee.

The cofree coalgebra of any vector space over a field exists, though it is more complicated than one might expect by analogy with the free algebra. Definition If V is a vector space over a field F, then the cofree coalgebra C (V), of V, is a coalgebra together with a linear map C (V) ‚Üí V, such that any linear map from a coalgebra X to V factors through a coalgebra homomorphism from X to C (V). In other words, the functor C is right adjoint to the forgetful functor from coalgebras to vector spaces. The cofree coalgebra of a vector space always exists, and is unique up to canonical isomorphism. Cofree cocommutative coalgebras are defined in a similar way, and can be constructed as the largest cocommutative coalgebra in the cofree coalgebra. Construction C (V) may be constructed as a completion of the tensor coalgebra T(V) of V. For k ‚àà N = {0, 1, 2, ...}, let TkV denote the k-fold tensor power of V: :T^kV = V^{\\\\otimes k} = V\\\\otimes V \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes V, with T0V = F, and T1V = V. Then T(V) is the direct sum of all TkV: :T(V)= \\\\bigoplus_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} T^kV = \\\\mathbb{F}\\\\oplus V \\\\oplus (V \\\\otimes V) \\\\oplus (V \\\\otimes V \\\\otimes V) \\\\oplus \\\\cdots. In addition to the graded algebra structure given by the tensor product isomorphisms TjV ‚äó TkV ‚Üí Tj+kV for j, k ‚àà N, T(V) has a graded coalgebra structure Œî : T(V) ‚Üí T(V) ‚ä† T(V) defined by extending :\\\\Delta(v_1 \\\\otimes \\\\dots \\\\otimes v_k) := \\\\sum_{j=0}^{k} (v_0 \\\\otimes \\\\dots \\\\otimes v_j) \\\\boxtimes (v_{j+1} \\\\otimes \\\\dots \\\\otimes v_{k}) by linearity to all of T(V). Here, the tensor product symbol ‚ä† is used to indicate the tensor product used to define a coalgebra; it must not be confused with the tensor product ‚äó, which is used to define the bilinear multiplication operator of the tensor algebra. The two act in different spaces, on different objects. Additional discussion of this point can be found in the tensor algebra article. The sum above makes use of a short-hand trick, defining v_0=v_{k+1}=1\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F} to be the unit in the field \\\\mathbb{F}. For example, this short-hand trick gives, for the case of k=1 in the above sum, the result that :\\\\Delta(v) = 1\\\\boxtimes v + v \\\\boxtimes 1 for v \\\\in V. Similarly, for k=2 and v,w \\\\in V, one gets :\\\\Delta(v\\\\otimes w) = 1\\\\boxtimes (v\\\\otimes w) + v \\\\boxtimes w + (v\\\\otimes w) \\\\boxtimes 1. Note that there is no need to ever write 1\\\\otimes v as this is just plain-old scalar multiplication in the algebra; that is, one trivially has that 1\\\\otimes v = 1\\\\cdot v = v. With the usual product this coproduct does not make T(V) into a bialgebra, but is instead dual to the algebra structure on T(V‚àó), where V‚àó denotes the dual vector space of linear maps V ‚Üí F. It can be turned into a bialgebra with the product v_i\\\\cdot v_j=(i,j)v_{i+j} where (i,j) denotes the binomial coefficient \\\\tbinom{i+j}{i}. This bialgebra is known as the divided power Hopf algebra. The product is dual to the coalgebra structure on T(V‚àó) which makes the tensor algebra a bialgebra. Here an element of T(V) defines a linear form on T(V‚àó) using the nondegenerate pairings :T^kV \\\\times T^k V^* \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F} induced by evaluation, and the duality between the coproduct on T(V) and the product on T(V‚àó) means that :\\\\Delta(f)(a\\\\otimes b) = f(ab). This duality extends to a nondegenerate pairing : \\\\hat T(V) \\\\times T(V^*) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F}, where : \\\\hat T(V) = \\\\prod_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}} T^kV is the direct product of the tensor powers of V. (The direct sum T(V) is the subspace of the direct product for which only finitely many components are nonzero.) However, the coproduct Œî on T(V) only extends to a linear map : \\\\hat\\\\Delta\\\\colon \\\\hat T(V) \\\\to \\\\hat T(V) \\\\hat\\\\otimes \\\\hat T(V) with values in the completed tensor product, which in this case is : \\\\hat T(V) \\\\hat\\\\otimes \\\\hat T(V) = \\\\prod_{j,k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}} T^jV \\\\otimes T^kV, and contains the tensor product as a proper subspace: : \\\\hat T(V) \\\\otimes \\\\hat T(V) = \\\\\\\\{ X\\\\in \\\\hat T(V) \\\\hat\\\\otimes \\\\hat T(V): \\\\exists\\\\, k\\\\in \\\\mathbb N, f_j, g_j \\\\in \\\\hat T(V) \\\\text{ s.t. } X = {\\\\textstyle\\\\sum}_{j=0}^k (f_j \\\\otimes g_j) \\\\\\\\}. The completed tensor coalgebra C (V) is the largest subspace C satisfying : T(V) \\\\subseteq C \\\\subseteq \\\\hat T(V) \\\\text{ and } \\\\hat\\\\Delta(C) \\\\subseteq C\\\\otimes C \\\\subseteq \\\\hat T(V) \\\\hat\\\\otimes \\\\hat T(V), which exists because if C1 and C2 satisfiy these conditions, then so does their sum C1 \\\\+ C2. It turns outHazewinkel 2003 that C (V) is the subspace of all representative elements: : C(V) = \\\\\\\\{ f\\\\in \\\\hat T(V): \\\\hat \\\\Delta(f) \\\\in \\\\hat T(V)\\\\otimes \\\\hat T(V)\\\\\\\\}. Furthermore, by the finiteness principle for coalgebras, any f ‚àà C (V) must belong to a finite-dimensional subcoalgebra of C (V). Using the duality pairing with T(V‚àó), it follows that f ‚àà C (V) if and only if the kernel of f on T(V‚àó) contains a two-sided ideal of finite codimension. Equivalently, : C(V) = \\\\bigcup\\\\\\\\{ I^0\\\\subseteq \\\\hat T(V): I\\\\triangleleft T(V^*),\\\\, \\\\mathrm{codim}\\\\, I <\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} is the union of annihilators I 0 of finite codimension ideals I in T(V‚àó), which are isomorphic to the duals of the finite-dimensional algebra quotients T(V‚àó)/I. =Example= When V = F, T(V‚àó) is the polynomial algebra F[t] in one variable t, and the direct product : \\\\hat T(V) = \\\\prod_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}} T^kV may be identified with the vector space F of formal power series : \\\\sum_{j\\\\in \\\\N} a_j \\\\tau^j in an indeterminate œÑ. The coproduct Œî on the subspace F[œÑ] is determined by : \\\\Delta(\\\\tau^k)=\\\\sum_{i+j=k} \\\\tau^i\\\\otimes \\\\tau^j and C (V) is the largest subspace of F on which this extends to a coalgebra structure. The duality F √ó F[t] ‚Üí F is determined by œÑj(tk) = Œ¥jk so that : \\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{j\\\\in \\\\N} a_j \\\\tau^j\\\\biggr)\\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{k=0}^N b_k t^k\\\\biggr) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^N a_k b_k. Putting t=œÑ‚àí1, this is the constant term in the product of two formal Laurent series. Thus, given a polynomial p(t) with leading term tN, the formal Laurent series : \\\\frac{\\\\tau^{j-N}}{p(\\\\tau^{-1})}=\\\\frac{\\\\tau^j}{\\\\tau^N p(\\\\tau^{-1})} is a formal power series for any j ‚àà N, and annihilates the ideal I(p) generated by p for j < N. Since F[t]/I(p) has dimension N, these formal power series span the annihilator of I(p). Furthermore, they all belong to the localization of F[œÑ] at the ideal generated by œÑ, i.e., they have the form f(œÑ)/g(œÑ) where f and g are polynomials, and g has nonzero constant term. This is the space of rational functions in œÑ which are regular at zero. Conversely, any proper rational function annihilates an ideal of the form I(p). Any nonzero ideal of F[t] is principal, with finite-dimensional quotient. Thus C (V) is the sum of the annihilators of the principal ideals I(p), i.e., the space of rational functions regular at zero.

Available versions  The current release of BioUML is version 0.9.3 released in October 2010 and includes 3 versions; BioUML Server - which offers access to data and analysis methods installed server-side for BioUML clients (workbench and web edition) over the Internet. BioUML Workbench - This is a Java application that can work standalone or as \\"thick client\\" for the BioUML server edition. BioUML Web Edition - This is a web browser based \\"thin client\\" for the BioUML server edition and provides most of the functionality of the BioUML workbench. It utilizes AJAX and HTML5 technology for interactive data editing and visual modeling. The platform has been developed continuously since 2003 and offers data analysis and visualizations for scientists involved in complex molecular biology research. The system allows for the formalized description of biological systems structure and function including tools required to make discoveries related to genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics. The BioUML platform is built in a modular architecture which has allowed for the relatively simple addition of new tools. This has allowed the integration of many 3rd party tools into the platform over the 7 years it has been available.  Application and usage  BioUML was used as the main workbench for Cyclonet's integrated databasehttp://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/suppl_1/D550.full-text- lowres.pdf on cell cycle regulation and carcinogenesis in 2007http://www.mendeley.com/research/cyclonetan-integrated-database-on-cell- cycle-regulation-and-carcinogenesis/ Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and other high throughput methods create huge data sets (called \\"big data\\") in the region of 100 terabytes upwards. BioUML can disseminate, analyse, and produce visualizations and simulations, allows for parameter fitting and supports many other analysis techniques required to deal with large amounts of raw data. As research is typically shared between various institutions, the storage, delivery and sharing of 'big data' volumes has been a technical challenge. A typical genome data set might contain 500 terabytes of data which may need to be shared, often internationally using Internet2 technology.

The center is run by the State of Mexico government through an agency called the Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura (IMC), the largest and most important of this agency, receiving about 80,000 visitors a year. It contains the Museum of Anthropology and History, the Modern Art Museum and the Museum of Popular Cultures as well as a Central Public Library and the Historical Archives of the State of Mexico, as well as facilities for research. The complex Museum director Thelma Morales with artisan Ana Karen Allende and Sinhu√© Lucas at opening of exhibition The complex is located on part of the former San Jos√© de la Pila Hacienda, which was originally part of a Franciscan monastery called Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n. This hacienda was one of the largest in the Valley of Toluca with large pasture for cattle and a fresh water spring which only recently has been open to the public. The hacienda came into the hands of the state in 1976. Part of the land, 177,989 hectares, was dedicated to the cultural center. The main architect of the project was Pedro Ram√≠rez V√°zquez, who designed the museums. The center was inaugurated in 1987 the three major museums and a collection of art and cultural objects donated by regional centers, museums, libraries, arts festival and individual families. Much of the grounds remain open and contain some of the original hacienda buildings along with about seventy sculptures of iron, bronze and wood. The center hosts a number of temporary exhibits in its museums as well as cultural events on its grounds. The center sponsors an annual event called the FestinARTE, with a purpose of getting children to appreciate the arts, with workshops and performances in painting, music, ceramics, and theater for children. The Tianguis de Arte is held annually at the center. It sells art by state artists as well as books. In 2005, the center held an event inviting about 400 graffiti artists to create mural son fifty meters of screens located in the parking lot. To serve the eastern section of the State of Mexico, a new cultural center in Texcoco called the Centro Cultural Mexiquense Bicentenario was inaugurated in 2011. The museums =Anthropology and History Museum= The three main museums are the Anthropology and History Museum, the Museum of Popular Culture and the Modern Art Museum. The Anthropology and History Museum is divided into several halls. One is dedicated to ecology, exhibiting the flora and fauna of the State of Mexico. Other halls are dedicated to the pre Hispanic period, the colonial period and Mexico since Independence. There are pre Hispanic tombs and ceramics from different cultural that inhabited the State of Mexico. There is also a sculpture of a serpent with an image of Mictlantecuhtli at its base. From the colonial period, there are sugar mills, and steel armor along with religious items and fixtures from churches. More modern items include a printing press operated by Jos√© Guadalupe Posada), illustrations and etchings from Jos√© Zubieta and Jos√© Vicente Villada from the late 19th and early 20th century, Andr√©s Molina Henr√≠quez and Francisco Murgu√≠a of the Mexican Revolution and Agust√≠n Mill√°n and Abundio G√≥mez from the latter 20th century. In 2004, the museum was remodeled. =Museum of Popular Cultures= Facade of the Museum of Popular Cultures The Museum of Popular Cultures (Museo de las Culturas Populares) is located in the former main house of the La Pila Hacienda, which originally was a monastery built at the end of the 17th century. In 1986 it was remodeled by the state government with architect Pedro Ram√≠rez V√°zquez and inaugurated as the current museum on April 27, 1987. The museum deals with the ethnography, handcrafts and folk art and the tradition of charrer√≠a in the State of Mexico. It contains a selection of handcrafts from the State of Mexico dating from the pre Hispanic period to the present. This includes a double sided Tree of Life measuring 5.2 meters tall, the largest in Mexico with over 5,500 decorative elements. Other items in its collection include a suit from 1836, charro paraphernalia, paintings from the beginning of the 20th century, kitchen items, pottery, traditional Mexican toys, rugs made by the Otomi in Temoaya, Mazahua textiles and wood items from Ixtapan de la Sal and San Antonio la Isla. Much of the ceramic ware is from Metepec. There is also a collection of miniature items called El Tapanco, which are the winners of an annual contest in this area as well as other items donated from private sources. The museum has five permanent exhibition halls. The Casa Artesanal room demonstrated how highland haciendas were typically decorated and includes utensils, napkins, rugs, ceramics, furniture and more. The Cocina Mexiquense is dedicated to the wares of traditional kitchens in the State of Mexico. The Juguete Popular Room is dedicated to traditional handcrafted toys such as dolls, tops, trucks generally made from materials such as paper mache, wood and metal. The toje or cuescomate, is similar to a log cabin. Its original function was to store dried corn and other foodstuffs. Today the structure is used to exhibit items from a former general store. The Charreria room contains a collection of Mexican cowboy gear, much of it antique including arms, saddles, knives and more. Among its oldest pieces are two pistols from 1850. It has two temporary exhibition halls with exhibits from various parts of Mexico. The museum offers guided tours, conference space, book presentations and classes in Mexican handcrafts and folk art. =Museum of Modern Art= The Modern Art Museum building was original built to be a planetarium. It has a unique circular form with a pink sandstone base and a roof covered with a series of aluminum rings said to look like a flying saucer. The museum contains seven halls in arranged in chronological order and by artistic movement. It contains works by Germ√°n Gedovius, Leandro Izaguirre, Rufino Tamayo, Mat√≠as Goeritz, Pedro Coronel, Doctor Atl, Francisco Z√∫√±iga, Vicente Gand√≠a, Ra√∫l Anguiano, Alfredo Zalce, Enrique Echeverr√≠a, Leopoldo Flores, Francisco Toledo, Francisco Moreno Capdevilla, Arnold Belkin and Gilberto Aceves Navarro.

The volumes provide accurate texts of Madison's incoming and outgoing correspondence, newspaper essays, speeches, and pamphlets. The texts are accompanied by informative annotation and made accessible through comprehensive indexes. They are valuable research tools for students of Madison's life and those interested in the general history of the period in which Madison lived (1751‚Äì1836). Editors in chief * William T. Hutchinson and William M. E. Rachal (1956‚Äì1971) * Robert A. Rutland (1971‚Äì1986) * John C. A. Stagg (1987‚Äìpresent) James Madison's papers James Madison, Fourth President of the United States Unlike the large volume of personal documents surviving his compatriots George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, comparatively few papers exist to chronicle James Madison's personal life. Madison appears to have destroyed many of his own letters and plantation records, which he did not feel were of historical importance. Those that survived were mostly scattered among friends, family, and autograph collectors. However, Madison did retain, collect, and organize many of his public papers, particularly during his retirement when he presumably had more time to attend to the task. Recognizing the historical importance of these documents, he arranged and edited them \\"with a view to their appearance in print after his death.\\" He chose for this publication \\"his notes on the debates of the 1780s and many of his letters and other papers bearing upon public affairs during that decade,\\" including his notes on the proceedings of the Federal Convention of 1787. Madison expected the posthumous publication of his papers to both benefit history and to provide for his wife, Dolley Payne Todd Madison. In 1837, a year after Madison's death, Dolley sold to Congress his notes from the Constitutional Convention of 1787, as well as those he had taken on the debates \\"in the Congress of the Confederations in 1782, '83, & '87.\\" These were published in 1840 in Henry Gilpin's three-volume edition The Papers of James Madison, Purchased by Order of Congress; Being His Correspondence and Reports of Debates during the Congress of the Confederation and His Reports of Debates in the Federal Convention . . . . When Dolley ultimately sold the remainder of Madison's papers to Congress in 1848, she apparently did not realize that her son, John Payne Todd, had retained for himself many of the more valuable manuscripts from that collection. These he sold periodically to various creditors until his death in 1851, gaining funds to pay his gambling and liquor debts. Over the years, collections of Madison's papers have repeatedly sold at auction, and even today some still circulate in this manner. By these means, Madison's papers became widely scattered over time. A fuller detailed history of the papers is provided in the introduction to the first PJM Congressional Series volume. Project history The Papers of James Madison, at the University of Virginia Although three collections of Madison's papers had been published before 1956, the earlier editions were not complete and were also not entirely accurate. A new edition, The Papers of James Madison (PJM), was therefore conceived in 1956 to provide a definitive, comprehensive, and accurate representation of Madison's life. The PJM editors determined that it was critical to include both incoming and outgoing correspondence in the new edition of Madison's papers. Previous editions had only published selections from Madison's outgoing correspondence. With the omission of incoming correspondence, readers were deprived of the background necessary to understand Madison's own writings. Incoming letters can provide clues to the existence of other as-yet-undiscovered Madison correspondence and papers, and also reflect the wide range of concerns Madison dealt with in his public and private life. Earlier editions also omitted many of Madison's writings because they were illegible, inaccessible, and/or written in code. The PJM project provides a better understanding of all of Madison's writings by methodically collecting, transcribing, and interpreting even the most difficult of his papers. Additionally, the PJM project publishes some important third-party materials that are known to have passed through Madison's hands and that demonstrably informed his conduct in significant ways. , the project has collected nearly 29,000 copies of documents relating to Madison's life, including letters, essays, notes, diaries, account books, ledgers, wills, legal papers, and inventories. Since 1962, thirty-three PJM volumes have been published. Initially a joint venture between the University of Chicago and the University of Virginia, the PJM project was located in Chicago, Illinois, until 1971, at which time it moved to Charlottesville, Virginia. The first ten PJM volumes were published by the University of Chicago Press between 1962 and 1977. Since 1977, all volumes have been produced by the University of Virginia Press. =Digital editions= In the spring of 2010, the PJM project went digital when the first seventeen PJM volumes were made available to readers online. , all published PJM volumes are a part of the American Founding Era collection published by ROTUNDA, the digital publishing branch of the University of Virginia Press. Readers can now access the published volumes online via libraries and other institutions that subscribe to ROTUNDA. In an effort to make Madison's correspondence available to the public as soon as possible, more than 3,000 unpublished retirement documents can now also be viewed through the ROTUNDA Founders Early Access collection. These transcribed, proofread, but as yet unannotated documents are available online at no cost to readers; once they are edited, annotated, and published they will move into the American Founding Era collection. Publications The Papers of James Madison volumes: four seriesThe Papers of James Madison project publishes Madison's correspondence in four series. The projected 53-volume collection is expected to be complete by 2028. *The Congressional Series covers the years 1751 to 1801, recording Madison's contributions to the creation of the American republic. This series includes correspondence regarding his service in the Continental Congress, the Virginia General Assembly, the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788, and the first four Federal Congresses. There are seventeen Congressional volumes and this series is complete. *The Secretary of State Series documents Madison's diplomatic and political career during the two presidential terms of Thomas Jefferson, 1801-9. As U.S. Secretary of State, Madison oversaw negotiations for the Louisiana Purchase and the integration of those territories into the United States. He was also responsible for the U.S. Patent Office, issued all federal commissions, oversaw the printing of the public laws, and served as official liaison between the president and the governors of the U.S. states and territories. This series contains a wealth of international correspondence between Madison and five ministers, a dozen commissioners, and more than fifty consuls worldwide. There are nine Secretary of State volumes published to date, of a projected eighteen. *The Presidential Series covers early 1809 to early 1817, centering largely on Madison's record as commander-in-chief during the War of 1812, the first full-scale conflict to be waged under the Federal Constitution of 1787. As president, Madison corresponded on national politics, international diplomacy and war, Indian affairs, and the development of the nation's capital, while also responding to ordinary citizens who sent petitions for charity and mercy. There are six Presidential volumes published to date (a seventh due out in early spring 2012), of a projected eleven. *The Retirement Series records Madison's life after leaving public office in 1817 until his death in 1836. Correspondence illuminates his occupations at his Montpelier home in Orange County, Virginia, and documents his significant role in the founding of the University of Virginia. This series also contains many of Madison's own reflections on the past history and future prospects of the United States. There is one Retirement volume published to date, of a projected seven. Collecting the papers In 1956, the PJM editors began to inventory and collect the writings of James Madison. The project does not hold any original documents. Instead, the editors work with copies provided by repositories and private owners worldwide. These may be photocopies or reproductions on microfilm, fiche, or card, electronic scans or print copies from journals and newspapers of the period. A file is created for each document, including supporting notes and correspondence to assist in annotation. When copies are not sufficient for accurate transcription, PJM staff may travel to the repositories to view the originals of Madison's papers. Many originals are held by the Library of Congress and the National Archives of the United States. The Library of Congress makes digital images of their collection available free for online public viewing via American Memory. This resource allows interested scholars to become familiar with the evolution of Madison's style over his lifetime, and also gives them the opportunity to see the varieties of penmanship and languages Madison had to decipher. Interpreting some of these more complex documents, particularly those from non-native English speakers and from correspondents with limited formal education, is one of the more interesting challenges the PJM staff deals with on a regular basis. Madison's papers are also held by private and public libraries as well as in museum and historical society collections worldwide. Conveniently for the PJM staff, the University of Virginia Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library holds a large collection of original Madison documents. As a founding member of the University's Board of Visitors, and its second rector after Jefferson's death in 1826, Madison corresponded on a multitude of topics related to the early years of the University. Small Library holds not only these official documents, but also a significant number of Madison papers donated over the years in acknowledgement of the key place Madison holds in the University's history. James Madison signature Still other Madison documents are owned by private individuals, many bought and sold by autograph collectors, and others passed down through generations of families, including Madison's own. These individuals, as well as institutional holders of Madison documents, are acknowledged in the PJM volumes for providing permission to publish annotated, print editions of their letters. Every so often previously undiscovered Madison documents are located. PJM staff find them in print and online auction catalogs, and occasionally receive a phone call, email, or letter about a newly unearthed document in a repository or private hands. The project is always grateful to add another Madison document to its collection. The editing process James Madison to Thomas Jefferson, 10 November 1821 The process of editing the Papers of James Madison is complex. The first step is to verify authenticity of the documents. The PJM editors then decide how to represent each document. While some bureaucratic and routine correspondence may be omitted or mentioned in footnotes, the majority of Madison's papers are printed or abstracted in full, to illuminate his thinking and his public and personal life. After transcribing and proofreading each letter to ensure document accuracy, PJM staff members research and annotate the letters, identifying people, places, and events so readers have much the same information Madison had when he received or wrote the correspondence. Considerable effort is made to render the printed texts as literal, faithful copies of the original manuscripts. Misspellings, not uncommon at the time, are retained so readers can see what Madison saw. =Special case documents= Some documents are more complicated than others. For example, those that are badly defaced, torn, undated, misdated, or unsigned require additional research in order to accurately present them to readers.

The future of the project The PJM staff will continue to produce print editions of the Papers of James Madison until all series are complete. In addition, PJM staff will consult as needed on a new project designed to provide web access to Madison's as-yet-unpublished papers that are not already available through ROTUNDA's Founders Early Access. This new endeavor, a partnership announced in September 2011 between the U.S. National Archives and the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, a U.Va. affiliate, will make available online Madison's unpublished secretary of state and presidential papers, along with unpublished correspondence from other Founding Fathers of the United States‚ÄîJohn Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington. Free access will be provided to these documents on a website administered by the National Archives. The project will be managed by Documents Compass, a non-profit program of the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities whose focus is to bring documentary editions into the digital age. The National Archives project is expected to be complete in three years, giving scholars and the general public access to these primary source materials before they appear in the official print editions.

Since 1888 it has been sourced from an ancient native American sacred spring that is part of the Stone Mountain, Georgia, geological pluton (granite intrusion) formation. Located at Lithia Springs, Georgia, on the boundary of Cobb and Douglas counties, approximately twelve miles from the city of Atlanta. Lithia Spring Water contains a high ionic-mineral content, as measured by total dissolved solids (TDS) of 2,300 milligrams per liter. It contains the following chemical elements, in amounts of 100 or more micrograms per liter: lithium, calcium, sulfate, magnesium, potassium, silica, and sodium. The brand is owned by Lithia Spring Water, LLC.; Lithia Spring Water is sold directly from Historic Lithia Springs and shipped only within the United States. History Lithia Spring Water 1888 poster Lithia Springs is an ancient Native American Indian medicinal spring. Until 1838 and the Trail of Tears, Lithia Springs was a healing center for the southern Cherokee Nation. The last Cherokee chief that ruled over the springs was named Ama-Kanasta (Sweetwater) who took his name from the 'sweet water' that flowed from the ancient spring. Davis, Fannie Mae Davis (1987). From Indian Trail to Interstate 20 , Douglas County History book, USA. In 1882 the town of Lithia Springs, Georgia, was named after the natural Lithia water spring. So popular were the spring's medicinal waters that flowed from the spring that people came from long distances for its health benefits. The neighboring city of Austell, Georgia, was also founded due to the spring's popularity. In 1887, Judge Bowden of Atlanta bought the springs with a group of investors and started bottling and selling Bowden Lithia spring water. In 1888 Bowden Lithia Spring Water Co. opened its offices at 131 West 42nd Street, New York City.Washington, Samuel (1913). Mineral Springs of Georgia, p. 190. Out of Print, USA. That same year the Sweet Water Hotel, a 300-room luxury health resort, opened in Lithia Springs.[1] The Sweet Water Hotel and its famous Lithia spring water were so popular that Mark Twain, the Vanderbilts, and presidents Cleveland, Taft, McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt were said to have visited the Resort.Whatley, Robert (1982). I Love You Douglas County, Lithia Springs Historical Press., USA. The amenities of the resort included a large bottle of Lithia Spring Water delivered to each room and the world-famous Lithia Vapor Baths.[1] In 1887, Bowden Lithia Water won the \\"Gold Medal Par Excellence\\" at the Piedmont Exposition in Atlanta. Spring Source The American Carlsbad and its Famous Medicinal Waters 1890 The distinctive properties of Lithia Spring Water are attributable to its geological structure and topographic features. The spring source originates from deep within the subterranean earth where water slowly permeates through miles of granite rock fissures, becoming mineralized from contact with blue quartz-bearing granite rock. It emerges from Lithia Springs at a temperature of 14.44 ¬∞C (58 ¬∞F). The spring water's rare alkaline mineral composition, purity, and high ionic-mineral and naturally occurring lithium content have seldom varied since it was first bottled and sold in 1888.Bowden Lithia Spring Co. (1890). The American Carlsbad and its Famous Medicinal Waters, p. 22. Out of Print, USA. A unique and rare characteristic of the water's analysis is the total absence of nitrate as it indicates the spring water source is primordial and not fed by the outside earth's watershed. The spring produces very limited quantities, only a few thousand gallons a day.S. W. Callie, Samuel (1913). Mineral Springs of Georgia, p. 190. Out of Print, USA. Product Lithia Spring Water began to be packed in plastic bottles relatively recently; prior to 1984, it was packed exclusively in glass bottles. Due to breakage, high shipping and handling cost, it was decided that glass was not feasible so plastic bottles were adopted as a means to sell and market the water. In 2017 the company made a decision to abandon plastic bottles for an eco-friendly solution that was non-toxic, recyclable and friendly to the environment. An innovative non-toxic 5-liter eco-friendly spout bag was adopted that allows reduced shipping cost and environmental waste. To guarantee 100% food safety and freshness, the water is drawn directly from its ancient source in small batches to be sanitized. Space-age antimicrobial nano-filtration technology (developed by NASA) and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) sanitation technologies assure all organic and biological contaminants are removed without altering the natural properties of the water.

It operates in three buildings in the Northwest and Northeast quadrants of the city: the historic Military Road School in Northwest's Brightwood, a building on the former campus of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Brightwood and at the corner of Perry Street and South Dakota Avenue in Northeast's Brookland neighborhood. It is overseen by the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board. As a charter school, LAMB is a nonprofit organization, funded by local tax revenue, and subject to some, though not all, of the same standards as traditional schools that are part of the District of Columbia Public Schools. Its admissions are based on a lottery system that takes into account preferences for siblings of current students and children of school faculty and staff. Curriculum LAMB teaches a curriculum based both on the Montessori educational approach developed started in 1897 by Italian educator Maria Montessori and on Spanish-English bilingualism. Students from preschool for 3-year-olds through grade five attend the school. History LAMB was launched by the Latin American Youth Center, a Washington, D.C., non-governmental organization that serves young Latinos. The school first had its application as a charter school approved by D.C.'s Board of Education in 2001, six years after Congress passed the District of Columbia School Reform Act of 1995, setting up the system for charter schools in the nation's capital. LAMB started classes in 2003 in Our Redeemer Lutheran Church, a church in Northeast Washington, while it looked for a long-term home. It had 57 students at the time. The school moved to the Military Road School on Missouri Avenue in 2006, its first long-term location. It renovated the building between 2008 and 2009 and added office and classroom space, while preserving the historic schoolhouse. In 2013, LAMB established a second location, sharing a building with the Perry Street Prep charter school on South Dakota Avenue in Northeast Washington. The building formerly housed the public Taft Junior Elementary School before the city closed that school in 1997 due to low enrollment. LAMB opened its third location in 2017 on the former campus of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Northwest Washington. LAMB shares the former medical center's Delano Hall with the District of Columbia International School. As of 2019, the Missouri Avenue location hosts classrooms for preschool-3 through third grade, the South Dakota Avenue location hosts preschool-3 through fifth grade and the Walter Reed school hosts fourth and fifth grades. LAMB's leaders hope to consolidate the entire school at the Kingsbury School in Sixteenth Street Heights in the near future, but they have faced local zoning issues.

Description  Silhouette reconstruction of the skeleton of L. marayensis Skull of L. marayensis in dorsal view Leyesaurus is known from the holotype PVSJ 706, a nearly complete skull with articulated mandible and some postcranial remains (vertebral column, scapular and pelvic girdles and hindlimb). The skull has a length of 18 centimeters, and Leyesaurus has been estimated to have been about in length. It was collected from the uppermost part of the Quebrada del Barro Formation of the Marayes-El Carrizal Basin, dating to the Lower Jurassic (based on the presence of a massospondylid like Leyesaurus within the formation). Leyesaurus was found near the locality Balde de Leyes, in the Caucete Department of San Juan Province. Within Massospondylidae, Leyesaurus was found to be most closely related to Adeopapposaurus.  Etymology  Leyesaurus was first named by Cecilia Apaldetti, Ricardo N. Martinez, Oscar A. Alcober and Diego Pol in 2011 and the type species is Leyesaurus marayensis. The generic name honors the Leyes family, inhabitants of the small town Balde de Leyes, who discovered the holotype and notified the paleontologists of the San Juan Museum, and saurus, Greek for \\"lizard\\". The specific name refers to the Marayes-El Carrizal Basin, where the holotype was discovered.

It is a sequel to 2011's Battlefield 3 and was released in October 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360; then later in November for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Battlefield 4 was met with positive reception. It was praised for its multiplayer mode, gameplay and graphics, but was also criticized for its short and shallow single-player campaign mode, and for its numerous bugs and glitches in the multiplayer. It was a commercial success, selling over 7 million copies. Gameplay The game's heads-up display (HUD) is composed of two compact rectangles. The lower left-hand corner features a mini-map and compass for navigation, and a simplified objective notice above it; the lower right includes a compact ammo counter and health meter. The top right displays kill notifications of all players in-game. On the Windows version of the game, the top left features a chat window when in multiplayer. The mini-map, as well as the main game screen, shows symbols denoting three kinds of entities: blue for allies, green for squadmates, and orange for enemies, this applies to all interactivity on the battlefield. Battlefield 4 options also allow colour- blind players to change the on-screen colour indicators to: tritanomaly, deuteranomaly and protanomaly. Weapon customisation is expansive and encouraged. Primary, secondary and melee weapons can all be customised with weapon attachments and camouflage 'skins'. Most weapons also have a default setting for different firing modes (e.g. semi-automatic, automatic fire), allowing the player to adapt to the environment they find themselves in. They can \\"spot\\" targets (marking their positions to the player's team) in the single-player campaign (a first in the Battlefield franchise) as well as in multiplayer. The game's bullet-dropping-system has been significantly enhanced, forcing the player to change the way they play medium to long distance combat. In addition, players have more combat capabilities, such as countering melee attacks from the front while standing or crouching, shooting with their sidearm while swimming, and diving underwater to avoid enemy detection. Standard combat abilities are still current including, reloading whilst sprinting, unlimited sprint, prone and vaulting. =Campaign= The single-player campaign has several differences from the main multiplayer component. For the most part, the player must traverse mini-sandbox-style levels, in some cases using vehicles, like tanks and boats, to traverse the environment. As the player character, Recker, the player can use two campaign- only functions: the Engage command and the tactical binocular. The Engage command directs Recker's squadmates, and occasionally other friendly units, to attack any hostiles in Recker's line of sight. The tactical binocular is similar to a laser-designator, in the sense that it allows the player to identify friendly and enemy units, weapon stashes, explosives, and objectives in the field. By identifying enemies, the player can make them visible without using the visor, making them easier to mark for their teammates. At one point, Recker will briefly lose the tactical visor, forcing them to only use the Engage command to direct his squadmates on a limited number of enemies. The campaign features assignments that require specific actions and unlock weapons for use in multiplayer upon completion. Collectible weapons return along with the introduction of collectible dog tags which can be used in multiplayer. Weapon crates are found throughout all levels, allowing players to obtain ammo and switch weapons. While crates hold default weapons, collectible weapons may be used whenever they are acquired and level-specific weapons may be used once a specific mission assignment has been completed by obtaining enough points in a level. =Multiplayer= The new Commander Mode interface in Battlefield 4, showing an overhead view of the map \\"Siege of Shanghai\\" Battlefield 4s multiplayer contains three playable factions‚Äîthe United States, China, and Russia‚Äîfighting against each other, in up to 64-player matches on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One (24-Player on Xbox 360 and PS3). A newly reintroduced \\"Commander Mode\\", last seen in Battlefield 2142, gives one player on each team a real-time strategy-like view of the entire map and the ability to give orders to teammates. Also, the Commander can observe the battle through the eyes of the players on the battlefield, deploying vehicle and weapon drops to \\"keep the war machinery going\\", and order in missile strikes on hostile targets. A spectator mode is included, enabling players to spectate others in first or third person, as well as use a free camera to pan around the map from any angle. On June 10, 2013, at E3, DICE featured the map \\"Siege of Shanghai\\", pitting the People's Liberation Army against the U.S. Marine Corps. The gameplay showcased Commander Mode; new weapons and vehicles; and the \\"Levolution\\" gameplay mechanic. The video displays the last of these at various points, including: a player destroying a support pillar to trap an enemy tank above it; and a large skyscraper (with an in-game objective on the top floor) collapsing in the center of the map, kicking up a massive dust cloud throughout the map and bringing the objective closer to ground level. Levolution also includes effects such as shooting a fire extinguisher to fill the room with obscuring clouds, car alarms going off when stepped on, metal detectors going off once passed through, or cutting the power in a room to reduce others' visibility. The maps included in the main game are \\"Siege of Shanghai\\", \\"Paracel Storm\\", \\"Zavod 311\\", \\"Lancang Dam\\", \\"Flood Zone\\", \\"Rogue Transmission\\", \\"Hainan Resort\\", \\"Dawnbreaker\\", \\"Operation Locker\\" and \\"Golmud Railway\\". The game modes on offer include Battlefields Conquest, Domination and Rush; while adding two new game modes called Obliteration and Defuse, along with traditional game modes such as Team Deathmatch and Squad Deathmatch. The four kits from Battlefield 3 are present in Battlefield 4 with minor tweaks. The Assault kit must now wait for the defibrillator to recharge after reviving teammates in quick succession. The Engineer kit uses PDWs, and carbines are available to all kits. The support kit has access to the new remote mortar and the XM25 allowing for indirect suppressive fire. The Recon kit is now more mobile and is able to equip carbines, designated marksman rifles (DMRs), and C4. Sniping mechanics also give with the ability to zero in your sights (set an aiming distance), and equip more optics and accessories than previous Battlefield games. The Recon kit is still able to utilize the MAV, T-UGS, and the Radio Beacon. New vehicles have also been introduced. With the addition of the Chinese faction, new vehicles include the Type 99 MBT, the ZFB-05 armored car, and the Z-10W attack helicopter. Jets have also been rebalanced and put into two classes, \\"attack\\" and \\"stealth\\". The attack jets focus is mainly air-to-ground capabilities, while stealth jets focus mainly on air-to-air combat. Another vehicle added in Battlefield 4 is the addition of the RCB and DV-15 Interceptor attack boats, which function as heavily armed aquatic assault craft. Customization options have also been increased in Battlefield 4, with all new camos available for every gun. A new \\"adaptive\\" camo has been introduced that can adapt the camo to the map being played without the player having to change camos every map. Camos can now be applied to jets, helicopters, tanks, transport vehicles and guns. Previously this option was introduced to parachutes but has been removed, emblems are now printed onto parachutes. Synopsis =Setting and characters= Battlefield 4s single-player Campaign takes place during the fictional \\"War of 2020\\", six years after the events of its predecessor. Tensions between Russia and the United States have been running at a record high, due to a conflict between the two countries that has been running for the last six years. On top of this, China is also on the brink of war, as Admiral Chang, the main antagonist, plans to overthrow China's current government. If he succeeds, Chang will have full support from the Russians, helping spark war between China and the United States. The player controls Sgt. Daniel \\"Reck\\" Recker, second-in-command of a U.S. Marine Corps squad callsigned \\"Tombstone\\". His squadmates include squad leader SSgt. William Dunn, Heavy Weapon Specialist SSgt. Kimble \\"Irish\\" Graves, and field medic Sgt. Clayton \\"Pac\\" Pakowski. Early in the Campaign, Tombstone is joined by CIA operative Laszlo W. Kovic, originally known as \\"Agent W.\\" from Battlefield 3s Campaign; and Chinese Secret Service agent Huang \\"Hannah\\" Shuyi. The Campaign also sees the return of Dimitri \\"Dima\\" Mayakovsky from Battlefield 3s Campaign‚Äîstill alive after the nuclear detonation in Paris six years ago, and under the Chinese military's custody for unknown reasons. =Plot= Six years after the events in Battlefield 3, American squad Tombstone - consisting of Dunn, the squad's leader, Sergeant Recker, Irish, and Pac - attempt to escape from Azerbaijan with vital intelligence about a potential military uprising in China. After being trapped underwater while being pursued by Russian special forces, Dunn, critically wounded and trapped, sacrifices himself by ordering the squad to break the windscreen and escape. Reuniting with their commanding officer Captain Garrison, Tombstone learns that Admiral Chang, head of the Chinese army, has taken control of China with Russian support, and eliminated Chinese presidential candidate Jin Ji√©, a progressive politician seeking reforms within the Chinese government. The group finds themselves sent to Shanghai with orders to rescue two VIPs - a woman named Hannah, and her husband - with assistance from an intelligence agent named Kovic. Although the rescue is a success and Kovic takes the VIPs back to the USS Valkyrie, a Wasp-class amphibious assault ship, Tombstone becomes trapped in the city and forced to rescue civilians against Pac's protests. Shortly after returning to the Valkyrie, Garrison assigns Kovic as head of the squad, and sends them to the USS Titan, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that had just been attacked, to recover its voyage data recorder before the wreckage sinks. Upon returning to the Valkyrie, Tombstone finds the ship under assault by Chinese Marines. While the squad rescue Garrison, and the VIPs, Kovic is fatally wounded and passes control of the squad to Recker. Learning that China's air force is grounded due to a storm, Garrison assigns Tombstone to lend assistance to US forces planning to assault the Chinese-controlled Singapore airfield so that Chinese air superiority is weakened. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone on their mission, much to Irish's chagrin. Despite the airfield being destroyed by a missile strike, Pac is separated from Tombstone during evacuation and assumed killed in the blast. Hannah then betrays Recker and Irish, allowing both to be captured by Chinese soldiers. Both men find themselves taken to a prison in the Kunlun Mountains for interrogation under Chang's orders. In his cell, Recker finds himself befriended by a Russian prisoner named \\"Dima\\" - a survivor of the Paris nuclear blast, now suffering from radiation poisoning. The pair escape from their cell, start a mass prison riot and use the chaos to make their escape, with Recker rescuing Irish along the way. As the Chinese military arrives to quell the riot, Hannah prevents the group from being recaptured by a group of soldiers. Although Irish mistrusts her, Hannah reveals her action was necessary for her mission, revealing her husband is, in reality, Jin Ji√©, who survived Chang's assassination attempt. The group makes use of a tram to get out of the mountains, only for it to be shot down by an enemy helicopter, killing Dima in the crash. Forced to make their way down on foot, hunting for food to survive, the group eventually find a jeep and drive towards the US-occupied city of Tashgar. During the journey, Hannah reveals how she lost her family to Chang's men after bringing Jin Ji√© to meet them, causing Irish to make amends with her for his behavior. Upon reaching Tashgar, the squad find US troops being besieged by both Chinese and Russian forces, and offer assistance to the US commander by destroying a nearby dam, flooding the area and eliminating the opposing forces. Learning the Valkyrie is within the region of the Suez Canal, Tombstone is airlifted to the ship, and arrives to warn the vessel that they are blindly heading towards Chang's navy. Assisting in stopping Chinese forces from boarding the ship, the squad soon find Jin Ji√© amongst other survivors, including Pac (who had survived Singapore). Knowing he must show his face, as Chinese forces had been fighting under the assumption he was dead, Jin Ji√© convinces Recker to let him show his face and calm tensions between the three forces. The assault quickly ends with Chinese forces beginning to spread the news of Jin Ji√©'s return. Chang, desiring to prevent this and conceal the truth, proceeds to barrage the Valkyrie with his personal warship. Recker, Irish, and Hannah volunteer to board the warship and use explosives to destroy it. However, when the remote detonation fails, Hannah and Irish each volunteer to manually replacing the charges. If the player chooses not to do anything, Chang obliterates the Valkyrie, thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Ji√©; if they send one of the two, the volunteer goes back to set the explosives, and is killed in the blast along with Chang, while the survivor and Recker are recovered by the Valkyrie. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with no regrets. Development Electronic Arts president Frank Gibeau confirmed the company's intention to release a sequel to Battlefield 3 during a keynote at the University of Southern California where he said \\"There is going to be a Battlefield 4\\". Afterwards, an EA spokesperson told IGN: \\"Frank was speaking broadly about the Battlefield brand--a brand that EA is deeply passionate about and a fan community that EA is committed to.\\" On the eve of Battlefield 3s launch, EA Digital Illusions CE told Eurogamer it was the Swedish studio's hope that it would one day get the opportunity to make Battlefield 4. \\"This feels like day one now,\\" executive producer Patrick Bach said. \\"It's exciting. The whole Frostbite 2 thing has opened up a big landscape ahead of us so we can do whatever we want.\\" Battlefield 4 is built on the new Frostbite 3 engine. The new Frostbite engine enables more realistic environments with higher resolution textures and particle effects. A new \\"networked water\\" system is also being introduced, allowing all players in the game to see the same wave at the same time. Tessellation has also been overhauled. An Alpha Trial commenced on June 17, 2013 with invitations randomly emailed to Battlefield 3 players the day prior. The trial ran for two weeks and featured the Siege of Shanghai map with all of its textures removed, essentially making it a \\"whitebox\\" test. Due to mixed reception of the two-player Co-op Mode in Battlefield 3, DICE decided to omit the mode from Battlefield 4 to focus on improving both the campaign and multiplayer components instead. AMD and DICE have partnered for AMD's Mantle API to be used on Battlefield 4. The goal was to boost performance on AMD GCN Radeon graphic cards providing a higher level of hardware-optimized performance than was previously possible with OpenGL or DirectX. Initial tests of AMD's Mantle showed it was an effective enhancement for slower processors. DICE released an Open Beta for the game that was available on Windows (64 bit only), Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It featured the game-modes Domination, Conquest and Obliteration which were playable on the map Siege of Shanghai. The Open Beta started on October 4, 2013 and ended on October 15, 2013. =Technical issues and legal troubles= Upon release, Battlefield 4 was riddled with major technical bugs, glitches and crashes across all platforms. EA and DICE soon began releasing several patches for the game on all systems and DICE later revealed that work on all of its future games (including Mirror's Edge, Star Wars: Battlefront and Battlefield 4 DLC) would be halted until Battlefield 4 was working properly. In December 2013, more than a month after the game's initial release, an EA representative said, \\"We know we still have a ways to go with fixing the game ‚Äì it is absolutely our #1 priority. The team at DICE is working non-stop to update the game.\\" EA President Peter Moore announced in January 2014 that the company did not see any negative impact to sales as a result of the myriad of technical issues. He said any negative impacts to sales were actually due to the transition from current-generation (PS3, Xbox 360) to next-generation consoles (PS4, Xbox One), and that other video game franchises like FIFA and Need for Speed were experiencing similar effects. As a reward for players who bought the game early and continued to play it despite all of the bugs and glitches, DICE rewarded players in February 2014 with all-month-long, free multi-player content such as: bronze and silver Battlepacks, XP boosts and events, camouflage skins, shortcut bundles for weapons and additional content for Premium members. Because of the widespread bugs and glitches that were present, EA became the target of multiple law firms. The firm Holzer Holzer & Fistel, LLC launched an investigation into EA's public statements made between July 24 and December 4, 2013 to determine if the company intentionally misled its investors with information pertaining to, \\"the development and sales of the Company's Battlefield 4 video game and the game's impact on EA's revenue and projects moving forward.\\" Shortly thereafter, the law firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP similarly filed a class action lawsuit against EA for releasing false or misleading statements about the quality of Battlefield 4. A second class action lawsuit was announced only days later from the firm Bower Piven, which alleged that EA violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by not properly informing its investors about the major bugs and glitches during development that may have prevented the investors from making an informed decision about Battlefield 4. Bower Piven sought out investors who lost more than US$200,000 to become the lead plaintiff. In October 2014, Judge Susan Illston dismissed one of the class action suits' original case on the grounds that EA did not intentionally mislead investors, instead its pre-release claims about Battlefield 4 were a \\"vague statement of corporate optimism,\\" \\"an inactionable opinion\\" and \\"puffery.\\" Six months after the initial release of the game, in April 2014, DICE released a program called Community Test Environment (CTE), which let a limited number of PC gamers play a different version of Battlefield 4 that was designed to test new patches and updates before giving them a wide-release. One of the major patches tested was an update to the game's netcode, specifically the \\"tickrate,\\" which is how frequently the game and server would update, measured in cycles per second. Because of the size of Battlefield 4 in terms of information, DICE initially chose to have a low tickrate. However, the low tickrate resulted in a number of issues including damage registration and \\"trade kills.\\" The CTE program tested the game at a higher tickrate, among other common problems, and began rolling out patches in mid-2014. In October 2014, nearly a full year after the official release with major updates still being put out, DICE LA producer David Sirland said the company acknowledged that the release of Battlefield 4 \\"absolutely\\" damaged the trust of the franchise's fanbase. Sirland said that the shaky release of Battlefield 4 caused the company to reevaluate their release model, and plan on being more transparent and offer earlier beta tests with future installments, namely (at the time) with Battlefield Hardline (2015). Sirland also said: \\"We still probably have a lot of players who won't trust us to deliver a stable launch or a stable game. I don't want to say anything because I want to do. I want them to look at what we're doing and what we are going to do and that would be my answer. I think we have to do things to get them to trust us, not say things to get them to trust us. Show by doing.\\" Marketing In March 2013, Electronic Arts opened the Battlefield 4 website with three official teasers, entitled \\"Prepare 4 Battle\\". Each hints at three kinds of battlespace: air, land and sea. EA then continued to release teaser trailers leading up to the unveiling of Battlefield 4 at the Game Developers Conference on March 26, 2013. The following day, Battlefield 4s first gameplay trailer, which doubled as a showcase for the Frostbite 3 engine was released. Shortly thereafter, EA listed the game for pre-order on Origin for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360; however, EA excluded any mention of the next generation consoles. In July 2012, Battlefield 4 was announced when EA advertised on their Origin client that those who pre-ordered Medal of Honor: Warfighter (either Digital Deluxe or the limited edition) would receive early access to the Battlefield 4 beta, this has since been expanded to include any Battlefield 3 Premium owners, and any Origin users who pre-purchase Battlefield 4 Digital Deluxe Edition. Although players who qualify for access in more than one way will only be granted one beta pass for their account and is non transferable to other players. The \\"Exclusive\\" beta started on October 1, 2013, with the open beta that went live on October 4. The beta will be on three platforms, PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 and features the Siege of Shanghai map on the Conquest game mode. DICE revealed more Battlefield 4 content in the E3 2013 event at June 10, 2013, such as multiplayer modes, and allowed participants to play the game at the same event. More information was released at Gamescom 2013 in Cologne, Germany, such as the \\"Paracel Storm\\" multiplayer map and Battlefield 4 Premium. Battlefield 4 Premium includes five digital expansion packs featuring new maps and in-game content. Two-weeks early access to all expansion packs. Personalization options including camos, paints, emblems, dog tags and more. Priority position in server queues. Weekly updates with new content. Double XP events, 12 Battle Packs. Battle Packs are digital packages that contain a combination of new weapon accessories, dog tags, knives, XP boosts, and character customization items, three are included with all pre-orders of the Origin Digital Deluxe edition. The service will also transfer your Premium membership from Xbox 360 to Xbox One or PS3 to PS4. Premium membership pre- orders started the day the service was announced (August 21, 2013). DICE has also announced that if you purchase the game for a current generation system (PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360) you will be able to trade it in for a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version of the game for as little as $10. Additionally all PlayStation 3 and 4 copies will include a code in the box to redeem a digital copy on the PlayStation Store. An important strategy of DICE's market strategy to promote Battlefield 4 was the series of TV and web advertisements entitled Only in Battlefield 4. Each one of these TV spots was narrated by a player of Battlefield 4 describing one of the unique experiences they encountered, along with a re-creation of the event using gameplay footage. These advertisements highlighted the free-form nature of the upcoming game, such as the destructibility of the environment and the dynamic nature of the game's combat engine. These events included things such as demonstrating the new Levolution feature, upgrades to gameplay, and unscripted moments that cannot occur in other games' multiplayer mode. Due to poor reception from gamers, on May 30, 2013, EA discontinued the online pass for all existing and future EA games including Battlefield 4. A companion application was also released for iOS and Android. Downloadable content Battlefield 4 featured a total of five downloadable content (DLC) packs that included new maps and additions to gameplay. All five DLC packs were available two weeks prior to their scheduled release by players who had purchased Premium. Once support for Battlefield 4 Premium ended, DICE announced all future DLC would be free. =China Rising= On May 21, 2013, DICE unveiled Battlefield 4: China Rising on a Battlelog post and stated that it would include four new maps (Silk Road, Altai Range, Dragon Pass and Guilin Peaks) on the Chinese mainland, ten new assignments, new vehicles, as well as the Air Superiority gametype. It is available to those who pre-ordered the game at no extra cost. It was released to premium players on December 3, 2013 followed by a general release on December 17, 2013. =Second Assault= On June 10, 2013, DICE unveiled Battlefield 4: Second Assault during the Microsoft Press Conference at E3 2013. It was announced that it would be the first expansion pack to be released for Battlefield 4 and would debut on the Xbox One. It was released on November 22, 2013, the same day the Xbox One was launched. The expansion features the return of four fan- favorite maps from Battlefield 3 and introduces Capture the Flag as a new gametype. On February 18, 2014, Second Assault became available as Premium exclusive for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PC. It became available for non-Premium users on March 4, 2014. During January 29 ‚Äì February 28, 2015, the expansion was free of charge to all EA Access subscribers. =Naval Strike= On August 20, 2013, DICE unveiled Battlefield 4: Naval Strike at Gamescom 2013. It involves dynamic combat on four new maps, Wave Breaker, Nansha Strike, Operation Mortar, and Lost Islands, which take place in the South China Sea and features a new mode called \\"Carrier Assault\\" inspired by Battlefield 2142. The original release date was planned for March 25, 2014 for premium members and April 8, 2014 for non-premium members but was delayed several hours before release for Xbox One and PC without a new release date being set. On March 26, 2014, Naval Strike was released for premium members on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox 360. The Xbox One version was released for premium members on March 27, 2014, and the PC version was released on March 31, 2014. =Dragon's Teeth= At Gamescom 2013, DICE unveiled Battlefield 4: Dragon's Teeth. Its maps take place in war-torn cities locked down by the People's Liberation Army. Dragon's Teeth was released on July 15, 2014 for Battlefield 4 Premium Members. For Non-Premium members it was released 2 weeks later on July 29, 2014. A new game mode included in this Dragon's Teeth DLC is called \\"Chain Link\\". There are four new maps included in Dragon's Teeth called \\"Lumphini Garden, Pearl Market, Propaganda and Sunken Dragon\\". There are 11 new Assignments and a new assault drone called the \\"R.A.W.R\\" that can be found on those four maps. =Final Stand= On August 20, 2013, DICE unveiled Battlefield 4: Final Stand at Gamescom 2013. Final Stand focuses on the conclusion of the in-game war of 2020. It includes four new maps and \\"secret prototype weapons and vehicles\\". The four maps that are included are \\"Operation Whiteout\\", \\"Giants of Karelia\\", \\"Hammerhead\\" and \\"Hangar 21\\". New weapons include the Rorsch X1 Handheld Railgun and some gadgets including the DS-3 and XD-1 Accipiter MKV, as well as a hovercraft tank based on the Levkov 1937 Hovercraft MBT. It was released for Battlefield 4 Premium members on November 18, 2014, 00:01 and for non-Premium Battlefield 4 players on December 2, 2014, 00:01. =Weapons Crate= The Weapons Crate DLC was announced by DICE on March 30, 2015, as a free DLC. The DLC added five weapons into the game: the Mare's Leg, AN-94, Groza-1, Groza-4 and the L86A2 along with the gamemode from Battlefield 3 'Gun Master' and many other stat changes. It was released in an alpha form in the Community Test Environment. It was released along with the Spring 2015 Patch on May 26, 2015. =Night Operations= In August 2015, DICE announced the expansion pack Night Operations, a free DLC pack. The first map to be released was Zavod: Graveyard shift, a night time version of the Battlefield 4 map Zavod 311, it was released with the Summer 2015 Patch. Two other night maps were also in development, a night time version of the map Siege of Shanghai and Golmud Railway, these maps were playable in the Battlefield 4 Community Test Environment but would remain unreleased as further development on Battlefield 4 ended. All three maps were developed by DICE LA and tested in the Community Test Environment with player feedback taken on board. =Community Operations= Community Operations was released on October 27, 2015, a free DLC pack. The map, Outbreak, is a medium-sized with much vegetation such as trees, shrubs, and grass for ambushing the enemies within. There are limited amounts of heavy vehicles such as tanks, LAVs and no anti-air vehicles. The map does not include air dominance such as stealth jets, scout helicopters and attack aircraft. This map was created by DICE Los Angeles and the Battlefield 4 gaming community. The update contains major changes to weapons and vehicles. =Legacy Operations= Legacy Operations was released on December 15, 2015, a free DLC pack. The map is an updated version of the Battlefield 2 map, Dragon Valley. It was released alongside the Winter Patch content update. =Premium= Premium is a downloadable pass that offers all of the downloadable content for a discounted price. Premium offers a range of personalization options and items, such as exclusive dog tags or camos. Premium contributes to the game by offering select days in which special events take place only for premium members. Reception =Critical reception= Battlefield 4 received positive reviews from critics. Chris Watters of GameSpot gave praise to Obliteration Mode and the multiplayer elements but was otherwise unimpressed with the campaign. IGN's Mitch Dyer stated that \\"Battlefield 4 is a greatest hits album of DICE's multiplayer legacy\\" for same versions. Evan Lahti of PC Gamer stated that although the game strongly resembles Battlefield 3 it still manages to remain \\"a visually and sonically satisfying, reliably intense FPS\\". Commander Mode and the diverse map selection within multiplayer were also praised as being good additions to the game. Joystiq's David Hinkle said that the game \\"drops players into a sandbox and unhooks all tethers, loosing scores of soldiers to squad up and take down the opposition however they choose\\". Hinkle praised the campaign elements, but found the multiplayer to not hold any surprises. GameZone Lance Liebl stated \\"Your success in Battlefield is up to you and how well you work as a team. And it's one of the most rewarding games I've played. Battlelog needs some refinement, and there's still way too many crashes, but the multiplayer more than makes up for all of it.\\" Machinima's Lawrence Sonntag praised the Levolution feature and the multiplayer mode. However several reviewers noted that the multiplayer part of the game had been released with a lot of game-breaking bugs on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, such as server crashes and lag. Polygon reviewed the game the day of its release, and gave it 7.5, then later downgraded their score to 4 after acknowledging that the game \\"was still barely playable for many players\\". DICE later acknowledged the issues with the multiplayer part of the game and said they were working to fix them, and that they would not work on expansions or future projects until the game problems were resolved. Despite this promise, the game's second expansion was released while numerous recurring problems had yet to be resolved. =Ban in China= In late December 2013, shortly after the release of the \\"China Rising\\" DLC pack, China banned the sale of Battlefield 4, requesting stores and online vendors to remove the game and encouraging those who have already purchased the game to remove it from their consoles and/or PCs. The game was viewed as a national security risk in the form of a cultural invasion as the DLC includes four maps on the Chinese mainland. An editorial from the China National Defense Newspaper (a subsidiary of the PLA Daily) published in December 2013 criticized the game for discrediting China's national sovereignty, and stated that while in the past the Soviet Union would often be used as an imaginary enemy in video games, the shift has recently turned to China.ÂÆ´ÁéâËÅ™, 2013-12-11, ÂÆòÂ™íÔºöÂõΩÂ§ñÊ∏∏ÊàèÊäπÈªë‰∏≠ÂõΩÂΩ¢Ë±° Êâ≠Êõ≤‰∫ãÂÆûËØØÂØºÈùíÂ∞ëÂπ¥ , ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂõΩÈò≤Êä• =Sales= During the first week of sales in the United Kingdom, Battlefield 4 became the second best-selling game on all available formats, only behind Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.

History Lew Cirne founded New Relic in 2008 and is the company's CEO. The name \\"New Relic\\" is an anagram of founder Lew Cirne's name. In February 2013, New Relic (NR) raised $80 million from investors including Insight Venture Partners, T. Rowe Price, Benchmark Capital, Allen & Company, Trinity Ventures, Passport Capital, Dragoneer, and Tenaya Capital at a valuation of $750 million. The funding round helped New Relic extend its software analytics platform to include Android and iOS native mobile apps. In April 2014, New Relic raised another $100 million in funding led by BlackRock, Inc., and Passport Capital, with participation from T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Wellington Management. Board members are Peter Fenton of Benchmark, Dan Scholnick of Trinity Ventures, Peter Currie of Currie Capital, Adam Messinger of Twitter, Sarah Friar of Square, and Lew Cirne. New Relic went public on December 12, 2014. In January 2020, the company announced that Bill Staples will join as Chief Product Officer on February 14, 2020. He will lead the product management, engineering and design functions, as well as drive the company's platform strategy. In March 2020, New Relic inked a 10-year deal to move its Atlanta team out of co-working space into the 20th floor of a 28-story office tower off 12th Street in Midtown. In June 2020, New Relic laid off \\"less than 20\\" employees at its Portland engineering office. In July 2020, New Relic announced a change to its pricing model that would result in a per-user system with a goal of lowering the barrier to collecting data and providing full stack observability licensed per user. When asked about the decision to abandon its APM product after 12 years, Chief Product Officer Bill Staples explained that New Relic was looking to ameliorate the \\"explosion of complexity\\" for businesses using their products.

The lawsuit claims that New Relic violated three patents that came into CA Technologies' possession through acquisitions. The three patents in question are numbers B2; B1; and B2. This is the first of two actions CA Technologies has filed in connection with alleged infringement of patents obtained in the acquisition of Wily Technology (the company that was also founded by Lew Cirne).

Micros are the most common means of public transportation in Lima and many other cities in Peru. There are also more than 100 km of cycle paths in the city. The word micro is used in common-day Peruvian Spanish as an abbreviation for microbus (minibus). While the bigger vehicles are known as micros, the smaller ones are known as either combis or micros. These privately owned vehicles are not only known for being very cheap and convenient but also for being rather risky. Micros race from one street corner to another along all the major arterial city roads. Stickers saying, for example, \\"Todo Angamos\\" or \\"Todo Benavides\\" can be seen on their windscreens, which indicates that the micro runs the whole length of Avenida Angamos or Avenida Benavides. These microbuses dash dangerously fast, frequently crashing and speeding off before their passengers have got both feet into the vehicle. There being few bus stops, micros and combis pick and drop passengers anywhere along their route (although it is not allowed). Tickets became compulsory in the late-80s. No transfer tickets are issued, so double fares are often used by people when a micro passing through downtown does not go to the destination needed, although with the lack of control of routes nowadays there are many routes that go just about everywhere within the city limits. The only places where micros are no longer allowed to circulate is in the crosstown streets within downtown Lima: if you need to go from the West Side to the East Side you must walk or take a taxi (see below), and micros go north-south only through either the West or East sides' main arteries, Tacna Ave. and Abancay Ave. respectively. Nowadays, the new Metropolitano bus rapid transit system and the first line of the Lima Metro attempt to modernize the way Lime√±os commute. Lima Metro AnsaldoBreda Train in Villa el Salvador station The Lima Metro is the electric mass transit system of the Lima Metropolitan Area in Peru. It currently consists of one 35 km line and 26 stations, joining the southern area of the metropolis with the center and the north east of the city. Five additional lines are planned. In 2010 the government of Alan Garc√≠a resumed the project of Lima Metro starting with the construction of Line 1. The construction and implementation of 11.7 kilometres (7.3 mi) (with a total of 22.5 kilometres (14.0 mi)) of viaduct elevated of double ramp from the Atocongo Bridge to downtown Lima. The Lima Metro Line 1 was built by a consortium made up by two engineering and construction companies. The line began commercial operations in early 2012. Nineteen new Alstom trains have arrived since November 2012, adding to the current fleet of five AnsaldoBreda trains, this is major impulse of the service. An extension of 12.4 kilometers is in service since July 2014 to the northern district of San Juan de Lurigancho. The line 2 is an East-West underground Metro line which is under construction, this contract includes the construction of a segment of line 4, this last line will link the system with the Jorge Chavez International Airport. It is expected to begin partial operation in 2016.http://elcomercio.pe/lima/1386895/noticia-primer-tramo-linea-metro-lima- operara-2016 and full operation for both lines in 2019. El Metropolitano The Metropolitan Transportation System is a transportation system which integrates the Independent Corridor of Mass-Transit Buses known by its Spanish initials as COSAC 1. This system links the principal points of the Lima Metropolitan Area and the first phase of this project has thirty three kilometer long line from the north of the city to Chorrillos in the south of the city. It has 38 stations along 33 km. of busway. This system is similar to the TransMilenio of Bogota, Colombia.http://www.metropolitano.com.pe/http://www.TransporteLima.com/ Sistema Integrado de Transporte The Sistema Integrado de Transporte (which means Integrated Transport System), is a bus system developed by the local government to reorganize the current system of routes that has become chaotic. One of the main goals of the SIT is to reduce the number of urban routes, renew the bus fleet currently operating by many private companies and to reduce (and eventually replace) most \\"combis\\" from the city. As of July 2020, SIT currently operates 16 routes: SAN MARTIN DE PORRES - SURCO (107) ATE - SAN MIGUEL (201, 202,204,206 and 209) ,RIMAC - SURCO (301,302,303 and 306),SAN JUAN DE LURIGANCHO - MAGDALENA (404,405,409,412) ,and DOWNTOWN LIMA - SAN MIGUEL(508) Buses Bus in Lima In the 1990s, during the government of the president Alberto Fujimori, it was established that the number of buses were not enough to transport people around the city, and the use of secondhand automobiles (mostly combis) from others countries was permitted. Since the end of 2000s, many combi were replaced by buses between 9 to 18 meters. =Vehicles= The most popular vehicle types used by the Buses in Lima are Volvo,the brasilians CAIO,Marcopolo,Comil,also buses in brands MODASA,METALBUS,YUTONG,KING LONG,and GOLDEN DRAGON. =Routes= Each transport company has its own routes, which usually pass through many districts. Some of the routes in the Lima and Callao Metropolitan Area are: *Ate - Callao (4901,4902,4904,4905,4908,4911,9401,9404,9405) *Carabayllo - Miraflores (Routes 1702,1705 and 1706) *Carabayllo - Pachac√°mac (Route 1803,8102,8104,8105,8106,8107,8108) *Villa el Salvador - Ventanilla (Route 9801,9802) *San Martin de Porres - Pachac√°mac (Routes 2803,2804,2805,8201,8203,8205,8209,8211,8212,8213,8214) *San Bartolo - San Miguel (Routes 8510 and 8511) *Santiago de Surco - Anc√≥n (Route 1702,1804) *Villa el Salvador - San Juan de Lurigancho (Routes 8306,3807) Some older routes ,can be defined by their old numbering until the early 1990s. The old route number is usually prominently displayed on the \\"passenger\\" side of the front window, as a backward reference. Many modern routes, however, lack this number. Old route numbers still well known (as of 2007) are # 2 (route 9504), 8 (route 3810), 9 (route 8403), 23 (routes 8519; 8520 and 3806), 31 (route 3707), 48 (route 3612), 71 (route 4908), 91 (routes 4405 and 4703), 94 (route 3906). If one company branches out into many routes (generally overlapping at the center of the route) the different routes may be differentiated by letters: 104A, 104B, 104C, and so on, for instance. 104A (This route isn't available) goes from Penal section of San Juan de Lurigancho to San Miguel via the East Side of downtown; 104B (route 3509) goes from Mangomarca section of SJL (the original terminus) to San Miguel via the East Side; and 104C (This route isn't available) goes from Mangomarca to Miraflores, via the West Side. Taxis Daewoo Tico taxi in downtown Lima Taxis in the city are very cheap. There are no meters so you must tell the driver where you want to go and agree on a price before you get in. Since there are no meters, many taxi drivers overcharge inexperienced foreigners with high cab fares. They vary in sizes from small four door compacts (generally Korean Daewoo Ticos) to large vans capable of transporting many pieces of luggage from the airport to your destination. They are virtually everywhere, accounting for a large part of the car stock. Often they are just any random car with a taxi sticker on the windshield. As in other major cities the way to flag them down is to wave your hand up high. Also much more expensive but more secure and professional are the Taxi Seguro's which you call up. They pick you up in their company cars. There are many different taxi companies in Lima. The most common cars used as taxis in Lima are Kia Rio, Chevrolet Sail, Toyota Yaris and some Toyota and Nissan station wagon models. In recent years, vehicle for hire mobile apps have become more popular, since they usually provide a more comfortable experience than regular taxis, which are often considered not as safe. Some of the most used taxi apps in Lima are Beat and Uber, and to a lesser extent Cabify and DiDi. Taxis will take you virtually anywhere in the city. You can tell them to take you to a certain hotel, tourist destination, or mall and they will probably know how to get there. Citizens of Lima commonly joke that they have the most educated taxi drivers in the world. The joke is based on the fact that taxi-running is a major source of income for unemployed or under-employed people, including professionals with a university degree who either rent or own the cars they drive. A whole economy spreads from investments in vehicle acquisition to be later rented as taxi cabs. Taxis are the most efficient and fastest way of transportation in Lima but in rush hour, however they are also considered somewhat risky since some criminals disguise as taxi drivers and steal from the confident passenger at gunpoint later on. An indication of the security of the Taxi is to check if it has the label of the Setame on the windshield, which stands for Servicio de Taxi Metropolitano, the administrative authority that regulates taxi cabs. Setame taxis are in most cases painted in a distinctive yellow colour. Taxis without the Setame label are considered to be informal and risky. Lately the Setame label does not mean safety anymore, people is choosing modern IOS/Android remisse services to contact a safe option of transport. Mototaxis and pedicabs are used in peripheral districts such as Puente Piedra and Comas where there isn't heavy traffic, although with the spread of urbanization and routes they are losing ground to regular micros. Public Transportation Statistics The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Lima, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 95 min. 35% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 19% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8.1 km, while 17% travel for over 12 km in a single direction. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Private cars Normal transit on the Javier Prado avenue. In the last two decades car sales has been growing every year, now Lima have approximately 1.4 million cars and industry plans to sell around of 200,000 new vehicles for next years. This way of commute is one of the most frequent, is a result of a growing economy and it shows a better income rate between Lima citizens.http://www.larepublica.pe/13-01-2014/la-industria- automotriz-ya-enciende-sus-motores-para-vender-210-mil-vehiculos Air transport Lima is served by the Jorge Chavez International Airport, located in Callao. It is the largest airport of the country with the largest amount of domestic and international air traffic. It also serves as a major hub in the Latin American air network. Additionally, Lima possesses five other airports: the Las Palmas Air Force Base, and runways in Santa Mar√≠a del Mar, San Bartolo and Chilca.http://gc.kls2.com/ Pollution There are approximately 60 000 cars in Lima. Few richer transportation companies use modern bodies made in Brazil or Argentina. Smaller companies use smaller vehicles such as minibuses and minivans. Since almost all of these vehicles are poorly maintained, they produce a great amount of pollution. Statistics show that in July 2001, the amount of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was of 236.66 mg/m3, the maximum allowable quantity being 100 mg/m3 . The presence of small particles of different materials (dust, lead and other metals), was also high during this month: 294.12 mg/m3, while the allowed limit is 150 mg/m3 .

Garth Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell have provided a concise, workable definition of propaganda: \\"Propaganda is the deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist.\\"Garth Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell, Propaganda and Persuasion, 4th ed. Sage Publications, p. 7 Propaganda can be disseminated through any medium, television, film, newspaper, posters, murals, political actions, rallies, violence, and websites. Propaganda in The Islamic Republic of Iran is also about the information that is not broadcast to the masses due to censorship. Censorship in Iran One of the biggest issues Iran is criticized for is censorship. Aided by Western technology from Nokia and Siemens, the Iranian government has created one of the most sophisticated censorship platforms created in modern times.  Methods  = Symbolism = The defaced Great Seal of the United States in 2004. The Iconoclasm shown is a form of propaganda  Flag  Tehran US embassy propaganda gun The flags of nations are considered propaganda. Not only is the flag itself a representation of propaganda, but the flags of other nations, such as the United States and Israel, are used in Iranian Propaganda. Burning of the U.S. flag and Israeli Flag seem to occur at rallies against each. Flag burning is a propaganda tool, such as burning Effigies of world leaders. = Violence/Fear = On October 8, 2006, cleric Seyyed Hossein Kazemeini Boroujerdi was arrested for opposing Velaayat-e Faghih, advocating the separation of religion from state, and defending the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. = Judicial system of Iran = Iranian Justice System has also been known to espouse propaganda. This is especially true in the prison system of Iran where Political prisoners were \\"incessantly bombarded with propaganda from all sides ... radio and closed-circuit television ... loudspeakers blaring into all cells even into solitary cells and \`the coffins\` [where some prisoners were kept] ... ideological sessions.\\" Any reading material of a secular nature such as Western novelists, or even religious material that didn't agree ideologically with the Islamic Republic such as work by Ali Shariati was banned. = The Basij = The Basij are the local and grassroot supporters of the Iranian government. \\"The mission of the Basij as a whole can be broadly defined as helping to maintain law and order; enforcing ideological and Islamic values and combating the \\"Western cultural onslaught\\"; assisting the IRGC in defending the country against foreign threats; and involvement in state-run economic projects.\\" With the IRGC's help and support, Basij members are trained in propaganda and political warfare techniques using media outlets. There are about 21,000 volunteer \\"reporters\\" that have trained with the IRGC on multiple waves of communication and media, which include social networks, television, radio, print media, and the internet. According to Reporters Without Borders, \\"In Iran, the Revolutionary Guards recently announced their ambition to build their own spinternet by launching 10,000 blogs for the Basij, a paramilitary force under the Guards. This comes at a time when the Internet has become a major force in exposing corruption in the highest ranks of the Iranian leadership.\\" As well, cyber-police \\"are here to create a cyber police force inside the people‚Äôs mind,‚Äù said Hesamedin Mojtahed, the officer in charge of the booth. ‚ÄúPeople want to be informed of the dangers on the Internet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are here for them.‚Äù = Military = The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a special unit within the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran has practiced for Psychological Operations against military targets. According to Ayatollah Khamenei, \\"the main priority of the country is to confront (enemy's) soft warfare which is aimed at creating doubt, discord and pessimism among the masses of the people,\\" Ayatollah Khamenei said last year, addressing a large and fervent congregation of Basij (volunteer) forces.\\"  Media of Iran  = Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting = Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting is the sole, official provider, of broadcast news to both the Iranian people and the rest of the world. IRIB operates many channels in a multitude of languages and is known to broadcast propaganda. IRIB is the main hub for which all Iranian propaganda is created, and disseminated, throughout the world. The multiple channels that make up IRIB all have a specific purpose. *On every IRIB channel, Israel is referred to as the \\"Zionist Regime\\". = Conferences and Lectures = Ahmadinejad's visit to Cornell was exclusively for propaganda purposes. Ahmadinejad firmly believes he can convince global opinion and the American people of the rightness of his cause. The Islamic Republic of Iran held an anti-terrorism conference which featured representatives from \\"neighboring countries Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan as well as Sudan, Tajikistan, Mauritania and the Vice-President of Cuba and Ministers and other high-level delegates from 60 States, representatives of the United Nations (Officer in Charge of CTITF), the OIC, and other regional organizations as well as distinguished scholars and researchers and peace activists from all around the world participated in the Conference.\\" With Iran being a state- sponsor of terrorist activities, and many of the nations in attendance, including many of the African representatives, users of terrorism, the anti- terrorism conference is propaganda. It was quite successful as well because the United Nations endorsed the meeting and sent a delegation to partake in the event. During the event, \\"Iran's Supreme leader Ali Khamenei took the opportunity to excoriate western nations for \\"terrorist behaviors,\\" and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed his doubts about the September 2001 terrorist attacks on America ‚Äì outrageously claiming that the U.S has benefited from those attacks, as it has, he added, from the Holocaust.\\"  Cyber Police  Iran has created a Cyber Police unit in January 2011, known by the acronym FATA.

The United States, they charge, is waging a \`soft war\` against Iran by reaching out to Iranians online and inciting them to overthrow their leaders \\". From the Iranian regime's standpoint, any free information is a threat to power. The internet was a major factor for organizing and showing the world what was happening during the 2009 presidential election. The United States asked Twitter to postpone online maintenance in 2009 so that it would be available for Iranian protesters. On 1 December 2012, General Saeed Shokrian, commander of FATA, was dismissed by Iranian‚Äôs national police chief, Ismael Ahmadi- Moqaddam, for negligence in death of blogger Sattar Beheshti while in FATA custody one month earlier. The dismissal followed international outcry over the death.

The FBI laid out a case against the Alavi Foundation that it was being used as a front group for the Iranian government. It was built in the 1970s by the Pahlavi Foundation to further the interest of then Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

It originates in North Frisia in Southern Schleswig in the beginning of the 20th century, when Danes living in the area under Prussian rule were prohibited from raising the Danish flag and displayed the Protest Pig instead. Due to its red color, its broad white vertical belt and a trace of a white horizontal belt resembling the colors of the flag of Denmark, it was made a symbol of their cultural identity. Danish flag The breed grows to a height of about and weighs up to 350 kg. It was probably created out of Holsteinian and Jutlandian marsh pigs, the English Tamworth pig and red variants of the Angeln Saddleback. It was recognized as a breed in 1954, but after a last birth in 1968, the breed was considered extinct. Only in 1984 were pigs fully corresponding to the descriptions of the breed seen again. Associations of breeders continue to breed it and to register existing pigs of this breed. Breeding populations exist in the Berlin Zoological Garden, the Hanover Zoo, the Tierpark Arche Warder near Kiel, in the ZOOM Erlebniswelt Gelsenkirchen, in Dalmsdorf (Mecklenburg), Hof L√ºtjensee and on the Archehof Blumencron. The Dortmund Zoo and the Tierpark Kr√ºzen house small populations too. At the moment, around 140 specimens are alive worldwide.

It operated from 1966 until 1987, when it was renamed Union for National Self-Determination (UNSD), which became the first democratic party in the USSR. History of the Republican Party of Armenia History Since the early 1960s the Soviet regime had to confront pockets of dissident thinking. The monopoly of the Communist party was questioned by people who thought in terms of freedom of thought and speech. Painter Haykaz Khachatryan (1920-1989) and a group of Armenians made a demonstration on April 24, 1965 near the tomb of Gomidas Vartabed in Yerevan. They were arrested, but released a few days later due to lack of evidence. The National United Party (NUP) was founded on April 24, 1966, by painter Haykaz Khachatryan, Stepan Zatikyan and Shahen Harutyunyan. The party issued and distributed the first issue of its clandestine periodical Paros (Phare) in October 1967. When the founders were imprisoned in 1968, Paruyr Hayrikyan became head of the party. The main goals of the NUP were the independence of Soviet Armenia, the establishment of democracy, and the elimination of the consequences of the Armenian Genocide (1915-1923). All members should closely follow the program of the party, entitled \\"For the Nation and the Homeland.\\" Any person aged sixteen, who accepted the program, could become a party member. In 1973 the National United Party re-elected Hayrikyan as its president. Hayrikyan wrote his political program, \\"The Road to Independence through Referendum Strategy,\\" in the same year. After he was arrested in 1974, he continued clandestinely to lead the organization. On his return to Armenia in August 1987, Hayrikyan founded a successor party to the NUP, the Union for National Self-Determination. Many prominent figures of independent Armenia, including Ashot Navasardyan, Movses Gorgisyan and Andranik Margaryan, were former members of the National United Party.

It deals with topics including the age of majority, paternity, custody, child support, guardianship, parenting plans, children's courts, circumcision, day care, child protection, foster care, group homes, adoption, surrogacy, child abduction, and trafficking of children.  History  Due to large support, the South African government decided on a set of rules and regulations regarding the country's Minors. This was introduced to the public eye in June 2006. Because of the division of powers between the national and Provincial governments, the statute was enacted in two parts. The original act, which was promulgated on 19 June 2006, contained only the provisions dealing with matters falling within the exclusive responsibility of the national government. The Children's Amendment Act, 2007, promulgated on 18 March 2008, amended the act to insert provisions dealing with matters for which the national and provincial governments share joint responsibility. Some provisions of the act, including the reduction of the age of majority from 21 to 18, came into force on 11 July 2007, while the rest came into force on 1 April 2010. Currently, all revisions have been made and are fully in force.  Rights given  In long text, it is an act to give effect to certain rights of children as contained in the Constitution; to set out principles relating to the care and protection of children; to define parental responsibilities and rights; to make further provision regarding children's courts; to provide for partial care of children; to provide for early childhood development; to provide for the issuing of contribution orders; to provide for prevention and early intervention; to provide for children in alternative care; to provide for foster care; to provide for child and youth care centres and drop-in centres; to make new provision for the adoption of children; to provide for inter-country adoption; to give effect to the Hague Convention on Inter- country Adoption; to prohibit child abduction and to give effect to the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction; to provide for surrogate motherhood; and to create certain new offences relating to children; and to provide for matters connected therewith.

He held the military rank of sergeant. He flew 196 sorties and shot down 35 enemy aircraft.Stenman, Kari: Nils Katajainen, Mannerheim-ristin ritari 170, Suomen ilmailuhistoriallinen lehti (2001). Biography Nils Katajainen was born to barber Oskar Katajainen and his wife, Jenny Katajainen in 1919. He began his military career by entering the volunteer service of the air force in 1939. He was promoted to Corporal on 5 August 1940 following a reserve NCO course. During the Winter War he served in fighter squadrons 24 and 32 and was discharged on 1 March 1941. However, after just a few months' time Finland began its pre-war mobilization, preparing for the Continuation War. Katajainen returned to Fighter Squadron 24, where he belonged to the third flight. During his wartime career he won 17 victories flying Brewster Buffaloes and a further 18 victories flying Messerschmitt Bf 109s. During a period of six months in 1942 Katajainen was transferred to LeLv 6 and began training on captured Soviet SB-2 bombers. He flew anti-submarine missions, until his influential friends managed to arrange for him to return to LeLv 24. Katajainen was badly wounded in an air battle on 5 July 1944. He was discharged from the air force on 10 November 1944 following his hospitalization and subsequent convalescence period. He was appointed Knight of the Mannerheim Cross on 21 December 1944 (number 170).Hurmerinta; Viitanen 1994 s. 124 Katajainen was the only pilot from the reserve pool that received the Mannerheim Cross.

It takes its name from the Huset cultural centre in the city centre, where it was founded in 1975, but has since 1995 been based at Halmtorvet in a building which is part of the K√∏dbyen district. History The theatre grew out of the alternative cultural environment around Huset in Magstr√¶de which had grown out of the political protest movement of the late 1960s. From its foundation in 1975, it served as a platform for contemporary political theatre, and both a venue for local ensembles such as Natholdet and frequently playing host to visiting international ensembles from countries such as Sweden and Italy. From the mid-1980s, the theatre's repertoire became more focused on drama with plays such as Bertholt Brecht's Baal and Rainer Werner Fassbinder's controversial play Garbage, the City, and Death which in Klaus Hoffmeyer's staging caused debate for its rawness. After a duo consisting of the director S√∏ren Iversen and Lisbeth Sj√∂lin took over the leadership in 1992 and its move to new premises in the Brown Meat District, the theatre has created a profile as a venue for newer Danish and international drama of relevance to people of today: Astrid Saalbach's trilogy Morning and Evening, The Blessed Child and Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust (1996‚Äì97) and Nicoline Werdelin's The Fanciers (1997) and My Two Sisters (2001). The theatre has won several Reumert Awards in recent years. From 1 June 2008 the theatre has been headed by a duo consisting of actor and director Mads Wille and dramatist and director Simon K. Boberg. They came from the theatre PLAN-B which from 2002 to 2008 they ran in Husets Teater's old premises on the 4th floor in Magstr√¶de. Husets Teater today The theatre has two stages, UnderHuset with 121 numbered seats and OveHuset with 70 unnumbered seats. The names are a play on the Danish words for the House of Commons Underhuset, literally Lower House) and the House of Lords (Overhuset, literally Upper House) and, at the same time, refers to their location in the building. The theatre is economically subsidised by Copenhagen Municipality.

Shortly after, he went to California, United States to study at a local high school. Having moved to Washington, D.C., he earned a Ph.D. in economics at Georgetown University. In 2006 Pizzati returned in Veneto because he wanted his children to learn the Venetian language and to live the Venetian way. From 2006 to 2013 he was a contract professor of economics at Ca' Foscari University of Venice. Since 2013 he returned to the United States as a professor of economic statistics at California State University in Los Angeles, California, and later at the University of Southern California.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/10698299/Venice- prepares-for-referendum-on-secession-from-Italy.html Politics A lapsed voter (living abroad for years), Pizzati had voted just twice during his life (Liga Veneta Repubblica in 1999 and North-East Project in 2006) before entering politics. In 2008 he joined the Venetian National Party (PNV) and was the party's president from 2009. In September 2010 Pizzati was elected secretary of Veneto State (VS), the result of the merger of the PNV with other separatist groups. As VS leader he conceived some provoking initiatives, such as the \\"Monument of the Entrepreneur\\" (exposed in Arzignano in protest to Italian high taxation on business) and the so-called \\"fiscal trips\\" (bus trips to neighbouring Austria and Slovenia, during which participants had the chance to open bank accounts). In October 2011, after an internal struggle, Pizzati was replaced as secretary by Antonio Guadagnini. In May 2012 Pizzati switched to Venetian Independence (IV) and was elected secretary of the new party. In July 2013 Pizzati, who had lost a key vote during an IV's congress in June, launched Plebiscite 2013 (P2013), a cross-party nonpartisan committee for a referendum on independence, of which he became spokesperson; subsequently, in late August, he was dismissed as secretary of IV.

He is most notable for his time spent as point guard for the Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team from 1999 to 2003. He was a three-time All- Horizon League selection (two-time first team), a Horizon League scoring champion, a Horizon League assists champion and Horizon League All-Tournament team selection. He is the older brother, crosstown Horizon League foe and former George Westinghouse College Prep teammate of Martell Bailey. The brothers' tenure in the league overlapped for two seasons, including one in which they were both All-League honorees. They played head-to-head several times, including a Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament championship game in which both were key performers. High school As a , junior point guard, Bailey led Westinghouse to the quarterfinals of the Chicago Public School League championships. He missed a month of his senior season with a broken wrist, but was back in the lineup by mid January. As a senior, the team reached the semifinals. Following the season, David and junior teammate Cedrick Banks were first team All-Chicago Public School League and Martell was second team. As a second team All-state selection, he signed with Loyola. He was also recruited by Rhode Island, Northern Illinois and Southwestern Louisiana. Loyola head coach Larry Farmer was advised to recruit Bailey by his former head coach John Wooden. College Bailey began contributing in his first moments on the court at Loyola in 1999, and he is credited with saving a game as a freshman. Bailey had the ability to slam dunk the basketball. At Loyola, Bailey earned 2000-01 and 2001-02 first team All-Horizon League recognition and 2002-03 second team recognition (along with his brother who was also on the second team that season). He was also a 2001-02 All-Tournament Team selection. Although the Bailey brothers played each other as Horizon League foes several times, the most notable was the 2002 Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament where the fifth-seeded Ramblers (17-12) and sixth-seeded Flames (19-13) opposed each other in the championship game for a 2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament invitation with the entire family in attendance. Although David made the All-Tournament team, younger brother Martell's team prevailed by one point in overtime, with Martell making a steal of a pass by David with 13 seconds remaining. David scored 35 points, while Martell only contributed 3 field goals, but all of Martell's field goals came in overtime, including one following the crucial steal. Nonetheless, the Chicago Tribune described David's gritty efforts on the season as heroic. During his career, he was named Horizon League Player of the Week three times (January 22, 2001; November 26, 2001 and December 3, 2001). He was also a 2001-02 All-Tournament Team selection. He led the Horizon League in assists in 2000-01 with 170 in 28 games for a 6.1 average and led the league in scoring the subsequent season with 651 points in 30 games for a 21.7 average. Bailey retired as the tenth leading scorer in Horizon League history in 2003 with 1933 points. This ranked him as the third-leading scorer in Loyola Ramblers history, and he retired as the Loyola leader in three point shots made. In his final career home game, he opposed his brother.

He was the 2002-03 NCAA Division I men's basketball season assists leader and holds the Horizon League records for single-season and career assists in conference games. He was a two-time second team All-Horizon League selection, and he led the Flames to three of the four post season tournaments they have ever participated in, including two of their three NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournaments. Bailey's three seasons at UIC are the school's only consecutive 20-win seasons and culminated with a school record 24 wins. He was not accorded a fourth year of eligibility for academic reasons. He is the younger brother, crosstown Horizon League foe and former George Westinghouse College Prep teammate of David Bailey. The brothers' tenure in the league overlapped for two seasons, including one in which they were both All-League honorees. In head-to-head competition, Martell and the Flames defeated David and the Ramblers four out of five times, including a Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament championship game in which both were key performers. As a high school basketball player, he was a three-time Chicago Tribune boys basketball Athlete of the Week who earned multiple All- State recognitions and led his high school basketball teams to a 132-3 record during his career. As a senior, he played for the first high school basketball team to achieve a sellout at the United Center. The team did so in the game in which they won the Chicago Public School League basketball tournament. During the season, the team had been ranked number one by USA Today. He was also a member of an Amateur Athletic Union junior national championship team. High school Bailey played on freshman and sophomore teams that went a combined 70-0. Bailey was the leading scorer in the 1998 championship game of the Chicago Public School League sophomore team competition against Whitney M. Young Magnet High School. As a junior, he moved up to the varsity team that was ranked 2nd in the city to King College Prep High School by the Chicago Sun-Times. It included his brother David who was a senior as well as juniors Cedrick Banks and Dennis Trammell. By December the team had a 6-0 record and had taken over the top spot in the rankings for the Chicago metropolitan area. That year, he earned his first Chicago Tribune boys basketball Athlete of the Week recognitions when he earned the MVP award in the 16-team December 1998 Chicago Public Schools Invitational for his 4-game efforts for the varsity team. The team reached the semifinals of the Chicago Public School League championships in 1999 with the two brothers starting and achieved a 31-1 record. Following the season, David and Banks were first team All-Chicago Public School League and Martell was second team. That summer, Martell and Banks were named to the Amateur Athletic Union All-American team during the national junior boys championships. The team won the national championships, but it included Westinghouse's starting five players, which violated the Illinois High School Association rule of a coach directing more than two of his players in a summer league. After David graduated, with Martell, Banks and Trammell, Westinghouse began the season as the top ranked team in the city by the Chicago Sun-Times in mid-November. The team was ranked fifth in the nation according to some polls. As a result of the IHSA violation, it had to forfeit two of its three preseason weeks of practice, and coach Chris Head was suspended for November and December. Later that month, Bailey and Banks were selected as preseason Top 50 players by the Sun-Times. At the beginning of December, Bailey was selected to write a weekly diary for the Chicago Sun- Times. He hit the game-winning shot with 3.3 seconds left to cap a comeback from an 8-point deficit with 2:50 remaining against the nationally ranked number one team, Oak Hill Academy, during the December 1999 Coca-Cola; KMOX Shootout at the Kiel Center. Entering the game, Westinghouse was ranked number four in the nation by USA Today, but Oak Hill had not lost a game in two years. After following that upset by winning two tournaments, Westinghouse was moved up to the top of the national rankings. However, the team subsequently lost to the locally unranked Curie Metropolitan High School. Martell led Westinghouse to the 2000 Public School League finals and a runner-up finish in the 2000 Class AA Illinois State high school basketball championships, earning consecutive high school basketball Athlete of the Week and co-Athlete of the Week (with teammate Banks) recognitions by the Chicago Tribune. In the Public School League finals in which they defeated Whitney Young 82-60, Westinghouse became the first high school team to sell out the United Center with over 20,000 in attendance, surpassing the previous Public School League championship game attendance record of 12,000. He was a first team All-State selection by the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association (along with Banks) and had a 3.7 GPA The Chicago Sun-Times named Bailey and Banks to the Class AA All-State team that included Darius Miles, Eddy Curry, Dwyane Wade, T. J. Cummings, Roger Powell, Jr. and Jitim Young. Banks was selected as the Player of the Year and both were part of Chicago's team that defeated a team of New York City high school all-stars in the April 2000 Wendy's Shootout. Bailey, who was a second team All-State selection by some organizations, selected an offer to stay at home at University of Illinois at Chicago and compete in the conference with his brother over offers from Notre Dame and Texas-El Paso. He finished his high school career with a record of 132-3. College At first, it appeared that Bailey had met his academic hurdles to play for UIC, although teammate Banks who also chose UIC did not. However, Bailey sat out the 2000-01 season for academic reasons. His enrollment classification was as an academic non-predictors. During the season, Bailey he won the home contest against with a buzzer beater. He earned 2001-02 Horizon League All-Newcomer Team recognition. As a sophomore in 2001-02, he split time at point guard. Although the Bailey brothers played each other as Horizon League foes several times, the most notable was the 2002 Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament where the fifth-seeded Ramblers (17-12) and sixth-seeded Flames (19-13) opposed each other in the championship game for a 2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament invitation with the entire family in attendance at the Cleveland State Convocation Center. Although David made the All-Tournament team, younger brother Martell's team prevailed by one point in overtime, with Martell making a steal of a pass by David with 13 seconds remaining. David scored 35 points, while Martell only contributed 3 field goals, but all of Martell's field goals came in overtime, including one following the crucial steal. The win gave Martell's team a 2-1 edge in the season series (previously Loyola had prevailed on January 17 by 11 at its home arena, the Gentile Center, and UIC rebounded on February 16 with a 13-point victory at its UIC Pavilion). Then, the 15th-seeded Flames played the 2nd-seeded Oklahoma Sooners, losing by a 71-63 margin to a team led by Hollis Price and Aaron McGhee. He was named Horizon League Player of the Week on December 2, 2002. Martell helped UIC sweep the season series against David's Loyola team with a January 22, 81-77 home victory and a February 27, 66-65 road victory. After finishing 20-14 in 2002, the team achieved consecutive 20 win seasons for the first time in 2003. The team qualified for the 2003 National Invitation Tournament where they opposed the and fell by a 63-62 margin. Bailey led all players in the game with four assists. He earned 2002-03 2nd team All-Horizon League recognition along with his brother. He was the Horizon League assists champion with 244 assists in 30 games for an 8.1 assist per game average, which led all of NCAA Division I. He established Horizon League single season assists record for Horizon League games during the 2002-03 with a total of 141. Then the following season, he scored his career high on senior night with a 22-point performance during the 10th game of a winning streak against Butler on February 28, 2004. The team extended the streak to 12 consecutive games including the 2004 Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament championship game against undefeated (in conference) to earn a bid in the 2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the tournament, the 13th-seeded Flames lost to the 4th seeded Kansas Jayhawks by a 78-53 margin. He repeated as a 2003-04 2nd team All-Horizon League selection. He also repeated as the Horizon League assists champion with 250 in 32 games for a 7.8 assist per game average, which ranked second the following season. He also earned Horizon League All-Defensive Team recognition. He established the Horizon League career assists record for Horizon League games over the course of his 2001-04 career with a total of 354. In his three seasons, the Flames won 20, 21 and a school-record 24 games in consecutive seasons. His original enrollment classification had made him ineligible for his first season. The National Collegiate Athletic Association allows a non-predictor a fourth year of eligibility if he graduates in four years. However, Bailey was still pursuing his degree in Fall 2004. Thus, he was not granted a fourth year of eligibility and served the 2004-05 team as a student assistant coach. Although Bailey holds significant Horizon League records, he trails Craig Lathen, who played for UIC for four years when they were part of the Association of Mid-Continent Universities, which became the Mid-Continent Conference and is now known as The Summit League, in career (755-656), single-season (274-250) and single- game (17-15) assists.

She was later owned and operated by the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, Jugoslavenska Lloyd and finally by Companhia Colonial de Navega√ß√£o. In her last incarnation, under the name Serpa Pinto, she made more crossings of the Atlantic during the Second World War than any other civilian vessel, leading to her being termed the Friendship vessel or Destiny ship. She was scrapped in 1954. Construction The Ebro was ordered by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company from the Belfast shipbuilders Workman, Clark and Company. She was launched in September 1914, and was 468 ft long with a beam of 55.8 ft. British service The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company initially planned for Ebro to operate on the West Indies service in the Caribbean, but due to the start of the First World War, she made only a single voyage on this service, in April 1915. She was then requisitioned, together with her sister ship and four other liners of the company, by the Royal Navy to serve as auxiliary cruisers armed with eight 6-inch guns, depth charges and mines. The ships were integrated in the 10th Auxiliary cruiser squadron, where they served as convoy escorts throughout the war. After the war Ebro was returned to the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. The company decided to sell her to the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, which refitted her and then placed her on the New York ‚Äì Chile service, sailing through the Panama Canal. She carried out this service until the 1929 Wall Street crash forced the company into bankruptcy in 1930. Ebro was then moored at Avonmouth until 1935. Yugoslav service In 1935 Ebro was sold to Yugoslavenska Lloyd and re-named Princess Olga. Under Yugoslav ownership, Princess Olga was used on the Dubrovnik ‚Äì Haifa route, transporting passengers and general cargo. In 1940 Princess Olga was bought by the Portuguese company Companhia Colonial de Navega√ß√£o. Portuguese service By 1940 the Second World War had greatly increased the numbers of people seeking to leave Europe for the Americas. Companhia Colonial de Navega√ß√£o operated the small and underpowered Colonial on the Lisbon ‚Äì Rio de Janeiro route. During 1940 Colonial transported around 2000 people to Brazil. With the increased demand, and already overstretched with passenger routes from Lisbon to Angola and Mozambique, to the Portuguese State of India, Macau and East Timor, in 1940 Companhia Colonial de Navega√ß√£o decided to purchase Princess Olga to carry greater numbers of passengers between Portugal and its colonies. Prior to this, the service had been carried out by pre-First World War liners, like Colonial and her sister ship Mouzinho, the former SS Corcovado. The Princess Olga was bought in April 1940, re-named Serpa Pinto and sailed to Lisbon. Her first voyage under the Portuguese flag was carried out soon after her arrival in Lisbon in May 1940, sailing to Louren√ßo Marques. When Italy declared war on the Allies in June 1940, all Italian shipping routes were closed. Only three companies from neutral countries maintained their transatlantic routes. These were the Portuguese Companhia Nacional de Navega√ß√£o and Companhia Colonial de Navega√ß√£o and the Spanish Ybarra, from Seville. The Spanish company, however, did not have enough ships to best utilize the transatlantic routes. From August 1940 Serpa Pinto began her service on the transatlantic routes between Lisbon, and Rio de Janeiro and North America (Philadelphia and New York). She was repeatedly stopped in mid- Atlantic by German submarines and US Navy and Royal Navy ships for inspections. On 26 May 1944, on its way from Lisbon (departure 16 May 1944) to Port Richmond, Philadelphia, USA (arrival 30 May 1944), the Serpa Pinto was stopped in the mid-Atlantic by the German U-boat U-541.List of all U-boats: U-541 . Uboat.net Retrieved 7 May 2016] The U-boat's captain ordered the Serpa Pintos crew and passengers to abandon the ship in the lifeboats, and requested permission from Kriegsmarine headquarters to torpedo the ship. The passengers and crew, with the exception of the captain who decided to remain on board whatever the German decision, duly left the ship in the lifeboats. There they were forced to wait all night while the German U-boat awaited a reply to its request. By dawn an answer had arrived from Admiral Karl D√∂nitz, who refused permission to sink the ship. The U-boat then departed the area and the lifeboats returned to the ship. The ship's doctor, a cooker and a 15 months child drowned during this incident. Two military-aged Americans were taken in the submarine. During the Second World War Serpa Pinto made ten voyages between Lisbon and Rio de Janeiro, and ten between Lisbon and Philadelphia and New York. Since it was one of the few ships making transatlantic voyages in this period, many of the refugees from Nazi Europe who reached the United States and Brazil in this period traveled on the ship. (The other important but smaller ships were the Mouzinho and the Nyassa.) Some of the more notable refugees, most of whom were of Jewish background, included Marcel Duchamp, Simone Weil, Pierre Dreyfus (son of Alfred Dreyfus), Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Marc Rich, Alexis Kanner and Naoum Aronson. Also in this group were many children who came unaccompanied, without their parents, some of whom had been killed by the Nazis (see One Thousand Children). Many of these unaccompanied children were aided in Europe and in transit by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (the \\"Joint\\"), the French Jewish organization ≈íuvre de secours aux enfants, and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS). One of these children became the rock impresario Bill Graham. After the war Serpa Pinto remained on the Lisbon ‚Äì Rio de Janeiro ‚Äì Santos route until the company's new ocean liners Vera Cruz and Santa Maria entered service. Her last voyage to Brazil took place in July 1953. Afterwards she was placed on the Caribbean route (Lisbon ‚Äì Havana) making 12 round trips to Havana, with stops at Vigo, Funchal, La Guaira and Curacao. On 9 July 1954, Serpa Pinto sailed from Lisbon on her last voyage, S√£o Vicente ‚Äì Rio de Janeiro and Santos. Scrapping After her last voyage, Serpa Pinto remain moored in Lisbon until 5 September 1954, when she departed under tow for Antwerp, Belgium, to be scrapped.

Along with a museum, the building houses the Andalusian headquarters of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). CSIC is the largest public institution devoted to research in Spain, and the third largest in Europe. The building was opened to the public in 2008, with the goal of sharing knowledge acquired through scientific research. La Casa de la Ciencia aims to be a bridge between the scientific research community and the public, sharing contemporary scientific research and information on environmental issues. The museum achieves these goals by putting on various types of events, including exhibitions, conferences, seminars and workshops. The museum contains three permanent exhibits, one temporary exhibit and a planetarium. History The museum is housed in the Peruvian pavilion (Pabell√≥n de Per√∫), a building of great beauty that was built in the Maria Luisa Park for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929. In addition to being home to the offices of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas en Sevilla (CSIC), the building also house the Peruvian Consulate. For twenty years the building was the headquarters of the Biological Station of Do√±ana and in April 2008 the city council of Seville provided a grant to renovate the building to create La Casa de la Ciencia. In April 2008 the city council of Seville provided a grant to renovate the building to create La Casa de la Cienca. Building Museum interior The building was designed by the renowned architect Manuel Piqueras Cotol√≠ (1885 ‚Äì 1937). Cotoli was born in Lucena, C√≥rdoba but moved to Peru to study and became known for his buildings which blended indigenous and colonial architecture. These buildings include the Escuela Nacional Superior Aut√≥noma de Bellas Artes, Pizarro¬¥s Tomb in the Cathedral of Lima, and the Archbishop's Palace. The blending of architectural styles is easily visible from the outside of La Casa de la Ciencia, and many parts of the building share similarities with Cotoli‚Äôs Peruvian works. A part of the building holds the Consulate General of Peru in Seville. In July 2008 the Peruvian ambassador to Spain signed a 75-year renewal of the assignment by the City of Seville of the Pavilion of Peru to the Republic of Peru and to the CSIC. The CSIC had undertaken to provide a exhibition space open to the public dedicated to the extension of science in Andalusia. Exterior The building lies on the Avenida Maria Luisa, noted for the Queen's sewing box (Costurero de la Reina), a unique building that takes the form of a small hexagonal castle with turrets at the corners, and the oldest building in Seville in the neomud√©jar style. It is between the Seville Public Library, inaugurated in 1999 by the Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo, and the Teatro Lope de Vega Sevilla, a small baroque-style theatre that was also built for the exhibition. On one side of the building is the Guadalquivir river and on the other, Parque Maria Luisa and Plaza de Espa√±a (Seville). Features Whale hanging in the entrance to the museum The museum currently has three permanent exhibits open to the public, which showcase the flora, fauna and minerals of the region: Invertebrates of Andalusia, Geology of Seville, and A Sea of Cetaceans in Andalusia. The museum also contains Seville's only planetarium. Notable features include a clepsydra (Water clock) and an ecosphere (aquarium).

Since its founding, the cafe has been owned and managed by a worker-owner collective of about 10-16 people, all of whom start at the same wage and are given the option of becoming a co-owner within six months of starting work. Management is structured in a non- hierarchical manner, and decisions are made by consensus. The cafe is open for breakfast and lunch. History The Seward Cafe was founded in 1974 as an all-volunteer operation. In order to offset costs, worker-owners were given coupons for free food (known as \\"Burger Bucks\\") and some of the original collective members purchased a house to live in cheaply. Eventually, the cafe began to make enough money that workers could be paid minimum wage. The cafe was embroiled in the \\"co-op wars\\" of the 1970s, where warring factions within the Twin Cities cooperative business community clashed, sometimes violently. A group of radical Marxist‚ÄìLeninist cooperative member/workers known as the Co- operative Organization, or C.O., accused other cooperatives of adhering to bourgeois hippie ideals and ignoring the working class. After attempting and failing to take over the People's Warehouse (a distributor serving many of the cooperative businesses in the Twin Cities, run by representatives of various cooperatives) through negotiation at a board meeting, they simply walked into Warehouse offices and grabbed the checkbook and financial records. The C.O. then confronted their rivals at the Seward Cafe, announcing that \\"The People's Warehouse now belongs to The People!\\" Attempts to retake the warehouse resulted in physical confrontation, and cooperative businesses all around town, including the Seward Cafe, organized an effort to boycott the now-C.O.-controlled warehouse. Eventually, the warehouse was retaken through legal means, and the C.O. dwindled into apparent nonexistence, though rumors of their presence in the political underground persisted. The cooperative movement dwindled throughout the '80s, and by 1993 the Seward Cafe was one of only five worker-run cooperative businesses in the Twin Cities. (The total number of cooperative businesses was larger, around 20 or so, but the majority had more hierarchical management structures and were not worker-run). The cafe remained committed to its business model, however, and in 2004, collective member Tom Pierson helped organize a national conference of worker-run businesses. Seward Cafe is one of many worker-run cooperatives in the Twin Cities, including the Hub Bicycle Co-op shops, the Hard Times Caf√©, and the Matchbox coffee shop. Seward provided financial assistance to Hard Times in 2007 when circumstances conspired to shut down the Riverside diner. In 2020, following the closure of restaurants in Minneapolis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Seward Cafe held a fundraiser through GoFundMe, raising over $36,000.

Of this, approximately 45% is in private ownership and 55% is in the ownership of Coillte. During the first 75 years of the 20th century, forestry in Ireland was almost exclusively carried out by the state. By 1985, forest and woodland cover was approximately 420,000 hectares. Upon the first arrival of humans in Ireland around 12,500 years ago, the entire island was predominantly covered in a blanket of thick woodland. These woodlands consisted largely of oak and pine forests. However, centuries of heavy deforestation meant that by the end of the 19th century, the area of woodland and forest cover in Ireland was estimated to be approximately 69,000 hectares, or 1% of the national land area. The vast majority of forestry plantings in Ireland are non-native species, chiefly Sitka spruce, with the consequent damage to biodiversity and the environment.

However, on February 18, 1951, New York City District Attorney Frank Hogan arrested seven Beavers for shaving points in three games during the championship season - including Ed Roman. Roman was sentenced to six months in prison but received a suspended sentence. For his involvement in fixing games, Ed Roman was banned for life from the National Basketball Association. The City College of New York would deemphasize athletics as a result of the scandal. Later life After two years in the Army, Roman finished his studies (ultimately receiving a doctorate at New York University) and worked in the city public school system in Queens as a teacher of physical education and, after the mid-1970s, as a psychological consultant. He had three children: Mark, Joanne and Tammy. Ed Roman died on March 1, 1988 of leukemia.

The League focused on combating government censorship, particularly relating to political speech and sexual material. History The League's main advocates included Edward Bliss Foote, his son Edward Bond Foote, Emma Goldman, and Theodore Schroeder. Other free speech advocates of that era included Ezra Heywood, Ben Reitman, Moses Harman, and D. M. Bennett. The league was formed in 1902,.Wood, p 76 Two other members who were involved in the league's creation were Bob Robins and Lucy Robins Lang. In 1908 its goals were reported as \\"freedom of peaceable assembly, of discussion and of propaganda; an uncensored press, telegraph and telephone; an uninspected express; an inviolable mail.\\" To achieve these goals, the League worked through the press, public speaking and the courts, feeling that \\"the education of brains and quickening of consciences are first in order of time and effect.\\" The League's Secretary at the time was A. C. Pleydell of 175 Broadway in New York.The new encyclopedia of social reform, including all social-reform movements and activities, and the economic, industrial, and sociological facts and statistics of all countries and all social subjects; William Dwight Porter Bliss 1856-1926; Rudolph Michael Binder 1865- ; eds. New York, Funk and Wagnalls Company 1908 p.511 The League was officially incorporated on April 7, 1911 in Albany, NY.The Twentieth century magazine, Volume 4, p 274 The league's charter included the goal: \\"by all lawful means to oppose every form of government censorship over any method for the expression, communication or transmission of ideas,... and to promote such legislative enactments and constitutional amendments, state and national, as will secure these ends.\\" One of the primary targets of the League was the Comstock Laws. After the Civil War, a social purity movement grew in strength, aimed at outlawing vice in general, and prostitution and obscenity in particular.Tone, p 17. Engelman, pp 13‚Äì14. Composed primarily of Protestant moral reformers and middle-class women, the Victorian-era campaign also attacked contraception, which was viewed as an immoral practice which promoted prostitution and venereal disease.Engelman, pp 13‚Äì14. A leader of the purity movement was Anthony Comstock, a postal inspector who successfully lobbied for the passage of the 1873 Comstock Act, a federal law prohibiting mailing of any material deemed to be obscene or related to sex in any way. Many states also passed similar state laws (collectively known as the Comstock laws), sometimes extending the federal law by outlawing the use of contraceptives, as well as their distribution. Comstock was proud of the fact that he was personally responsible for thousands of arrests and the destruction of hundreds of tons of books and pamphlets.Engelman, pp 15‚Äì16. When an English anarchist named John Turner was arrested under the Anarchist Exclusion Act and threatened with deportation, Emma Goldman joined forces with the Free Speech League to champion his cause.Falk, Making Speech Free, p. 557. The league enlisted the aid of Clarence Darrow and Edgar Lee Masters, who took Turner's case to the US Supreme Court. Although Turner and the League lost, Goldman considered it a victory of propaganda.Chalberg, pp. 84‚Äì87. She had returned to anarchist activism, but it was taking its toll on her. \\"I never felt so weighed down,\\" she wrote to Berkman. \\"I fear I am forever doomed to remain public property and to have my life worn out through the care for the lives of others.\\"Quoted in Chalberg, p. 87. Margaret Sanger supported the cause of free speech throughout her career, with a zeal comparable to her support for birth control. Sanger grew up in a home where iconoclastic orator Robert Ingersoll was admired.\\"The Child Who Was Mother to a Woman\\" from The New Yorker, April 11, 1925, page 11. During the early years of her activism, Sanger viewed birth control primarily as a free-speech issue, rather than a feminist issue, and when she started publishing The Woman Rebel in 1914, she did so with the express goal of provoking a legal challenge to the Comstock laws banning dissemination of information about contraception.McCann, Carole Ruth (2010), \\"Women as Leaders in the Contraceptive Movement\\", in Gender and Women's Leadership: A Reference Handbook, Karen O'Connor (Ed), SAGE, ., pp 750‚Äì751. In New York, Emma Goldman introduced Sanger to members of the Free Speech League, such as Edward Bliss Foote and Theodore Schroeder, and subsequently the League provided funding and advice to help Sanger with legal battles.Wood, Janice Ruth (2008), The struggle for free speech in the United States, 1872‚Äì1915: Edward Bliss Foote, Edward Bond Foote, and anti-Comstock operations, Psychology Press, 2008, pp 100‚Äì102 Around 1917 to 1919, the League gradually disbanded.Graber, p 54 Works by Free Speech League members * Flower, Benjamin Orange; Schroeder, Theodore; Post, Louse, In Defense of Free Speech: Five Essays from the Arena, 1908 *Free Speech and the New Alien Law, Press Bulletins No. 1 and No 2.

It stands in the Maria Luisa Park just north of the Pavilion of Peru. The theater is named after the famous 16th- century Spanish playwright Lope de Vega. After the exposition the theatre had a mixed history. It suffered damage from fire and flood. At times it was closed and at times was partially restored and reopened. The building has been used as a hospital and as a trade show venue. Following its most recent renovation the theatre has become one of Seville's most important centres for cultural events. Construction The Pabell√≥n de Sevilla (Pavilion of Seville) housing the theatre and casino was designed by the young architect Vicente Traver y Tom√°s. He chose a Baroque style that reflected Levantine influences. Elements of Baroque architecture were used in the physical structure as well as in the ornamentation. The theatre hall was fronted by the exhibition casino, which is roofed by a dome decorated in ceramics. The hall was laid out according to the canons of Italian opera, with two wings and 1,025 seats, and was one of the most modern theaters in Spain in its day. The decor by Mart√≠nez del Cid y Zaragoza was dominated by red, with fine details in gold and ivory decorating the roof and railings, and with the door and furniture painted green. Construction of the theatre took just two years and included installation of an automatic electric generator which often failed, interrupting the performances. The cost was 1.2 million pesetas, a huge amount at the time. The theater was inaugurated on 30 March 1929 with a comedy by Martinez Serra entitled The Blind Heart (El Coraz√≥n Ciego). During the exhibition the building was illuminated, like other buildings of the exhibition, with powerful external spotlights that enhanced the attractive appearance of the hall. Later history September 2008. The entrance through the casino to the theatre, with posters for a Flamenco show. After the exhibition, the theatre had ups and downs, competing with cinemas and football. It was closed for a while, then re-opened as the Municipal Theatre Lope de Vega in 1936. The event was celebrated with a dance orchestra in the terrace beside the casino. The new opening did not last long. During the Civil War (1936‚Äì1939) the casino became a hospital, with the walls freshly painted white. A fire in the theater destroyed the central chandelier and all the seats. Also, the Guadalquivir river overflowed to flood the pit. After the return of peace, in October 1939 the City Council decided to organise a season of opera. They cleaned the theatre, repaired the roof and installed indirect lighting. The theatre came back into use for opera and operetta, and was also used by amateur theatre groups and even schools. In 1961, renewed flooding again caused damage to the pit, and fresh renovations were required. In 1977 the theatre was assigned to the Ministry of Culture, and after a facelift became the National Theatre of Lope de Vega Sevilla. The theatre was used for a trade show in 1985. Recent years The theatre was returned to the city of Seville in 1985, and over a two-year period the architect Victor Perez Escolano made significant alterations, returning the theatre to its original design, although this limited the number of spectators to 749. The first performance after the reopening in February 1988 was a concert by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. From then on, the theatre has put on more than 180 performances every year to over 100,000 spectators. The theatre today stages classical and modern plays and concerts, and flamenco shows. It is a venue for the Flamenco Biennale of Seville, which is held on even-numbered years, and is among the most important theatres in Spain. As of January 2009 further repairs were needed, especially to the casino dome which had tiles missing and was leaking.

It took place on the night of 5/6 May 1976 near Cornamucklagh, a townland just inside the Cooley Peninsula in the north of County Louth in the Republic of Ireland, when the Irish Army and Garda S√≠och√°na arrested eight British Special Air Service soldiers who had illegally crossed the Irish border. Background The worsening security situation in south County Armagh, especially after the killing of three British soldiers at an observation post in November 1975 and the massacre of ten Protestant workers in January 1976, prompted British PM Harold Wilson to publicly acknowledge the presence of D squadron of the Special Air Service (SAS), which was deployed to Bessbrook Mill. The ambush of the observation post exposed the fact that conventional military tactics hadn't worked for the British Government in South Armagh, since the British Army report of this incident identified a number of basic mistakes regarding camouflage, routine patterns and the observation post's arrangement. On 28 October 1971, a confrontation took place between British and Irish troops at a cross-border bridge between the Republic and Northern Ireland, at the village of Munnelly, between counties Fermanagh and Monaghan. A British patrol was laying explosive charges to destroy the bridge, as part of an effort to destroy bridges and roads being used by the Provisional IRA to import arms and supplies from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland. A Garda S√≠och√°na officer stated that the bridge was at least half in the Republic, and the British Army officer on the scene disputed this. The Irish Army then deployed a unit of soldiers and its commander, armed with a submachine gun, demanded that the British Army surrender their explosives. Following a 90-minute standoff, the British Army withdrew.Irish, British in confrontation United Press International, 28 October 1971British, Irish in Border Confrontation, Associated Press, 28 October 1971Tal√≥n, Vicente (1972). Guerra en Irlanda. Ed. San Mart√≠n, p. 37. OCLC: 40663502 The first high-profile action carried out by the SAS in 1976 was in March when it abducted Sean McKenna, an IRA member wanted for attempted murder and a string of other offences. McKenna was abducted at 2:30 am while sleeping at home in Edentober, on the Republic's side of the border, in a cross-border raid by the SAS. Once across the border, he was officially arrested by another detachment of the British Army. In April, the SAS killed IRA member Peter Cleary in controversial circumstances near Forkhill, just 50 metres inside Northern Ireland. Although the porous nature of the border had led to 189 inadvertent border crossings by the British security forces in the previous two years, these latest incursions heightened the sensitivity to the issue by the Garda S√≠och√°na. Another concern for the Irish Government was the activity of loyalist paramilitary elements in the area, one of which had kidnapped and killed a civilian named Seamus Ludlow near Dundalk four days earlier. The incident After the kidnapping and murder of Seamus Ludlow near Dundalk, the Republic's security forces stepped up their presence along the border. A checkpoint was set up by the Garda√≠ and the Irish Army on Flagstaff Road in the townland of Cornamucklagh, some 700 metres inside County Louth in the Republic. At 10:40 pm, the Garda√≠ stopped a Triumph 2000 car coming from the north with two men inside. The driver obeyed the signal to stop, but when questioned by the policemen about their destination, they avoided a straight answer. They were asked to step out of the vehicle after one Garda noticed that the passenger had what seemed to be a gun hidden under a map. The unidentified men were unwilling to leave the car until Irish Army soldiers came out of the bushes and pointed rifles at them in support of the Garda√≠. The two men, who wore plain clothes, were Fijian-born trooper Ilisoni Ligari and trooper John Lawson, both soldiers in the SAS. After searching the car, the policemen found a Sterling submachine-gun and a Browning pistol. The Garda√≠ immediately arrested them, with the help of the Army, and took them to nearby Omeath Garda station. Lawson initially claimed that they were off-duty soldiers who became stranded while test-driving the car, and Ligari refused to talk about \\"the mission we were on\\". It later transpired that Lawson and Ligari were in the area to collect or relieve Staff Sergeant Malcolm Rees and Corporal Ronald Nicholson; two SAS soldiers who were carrying out surveillance from a hidden observation post on Flagstaff Hill, which is just inside South Armagh in Northern Ireland overlooking Carlingford Lough. According to author Peter Taylor, Rees and Nicholson were actually deployed on the Republic's side of the border. When the soldiers manning the surveillance post failed to meet Ligari and Lawson, they radioed their base at Bessbrook Mill. Initially, an IRA ambush was suspected. Four plain-clothes SAS soldiers‚Äîtroopers Nial McClean, Vincent Thompson, Nigel Burchell and Carsten Rhodes‚Äîwere sent to search for their missing comrades in two cars, picking up the two men from the observation post in the process. The team was carrying another three Sterling submachine-guns, a Remington pump-action shotgun and 222 rounds of ammunition. The first vehicle ‚Äî a Hillman Avenger carrying Thompson, McClean, Rees and Nicholson - drove up to the Garda checkpoint at 2:05 am. Rees and Nicholson were still wearing British Army uniforms. The second car‚Äîa Vauxhall Victor with Burchell and Rhodes‚Äîwas stopped shortly after. Sergeant Rees tried to explain the situation to the Garda√≠: \\"Let us go back. If the roles were reversed we would let you go back. We are all doing the one bloody job\\", but he eventually ordered his men to surrender their weapons after Irish Army soldiers surrounded both cars and aimed rifles at them. The Garda unit, commanded by Sergeant Pat McLoughlin, radioed his superiors for instructions on how to deal with the men now in custody. The shotgun drew the attention of the Garda√≠ since the same type of weapon was used in three recent murders in the area. The Omeath Garda station was ordered to keep the men in custody until a decision was taken at a Governmental level in Dublin. Before dawn, it was decided that the SAS team be transferred to Dundalk Garda station. Diplomatic consequences The arrest and detention of eight British Army soldiers put Irish Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave and his coalition government in a dilemma; if he released them without charge he was giving a green light for further British military incursions into the Republic, but if he permitted them to be put on trial and they were convicted, diplomatic relations with Britain would be at risk. A report published by Mr Justice Henry Barron in 2006 revealed that the soldiers were questioned whilst in Garda custody about the three murders, especially that of Seamus Ludlow that had been recently committed in the area. They were also questioned about the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and their weapons were checked in relation to forensic evidence from the murders in question.O'Halpin, Eunan (2000). Defending Ireland: the Irish state and its enemies since 1922. Oxford University Press, p. 336 Both protesters and media camped outside Dundalk station. There were concerns that the station could be attacked by a mob or the IRA at any moment seeking to get at the prisoners. The detainees were subsequently moved under heavy armed escort to Dublin, where they were charged by the Special Criminal Court with possession of firearms with intent to endanger life, and for carrying firearms without a certificate. The charges carried a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The 8 soldiers were released on bail after the British embassy paid ¬£40,000 and a helicopter flew them out of the state. The British Army Minister, Bob Brown, apologised to the Irish Government, saying the incursion over the border had been a mistake. The British Government, embarrassed by the situation, gave top priority to the immediate release of the soldiers. Sir Arthur Galsworthy, then British ambassador to the Republic of Ireland, stressed his concern about the finding of a shotgun and a dagger among the weapons confiscated by the Garda√≠, and the fact that most of the soldiers were in plain clothes, and that the two groups had given different accounts of their purposes of presence within the Republic of Ireland. When it became clear that a trial was unavoidable, the British Government hardened its position, with a member of the Foreign Office proposing economic sanctions against the Republic, and even mooting the creation of a \\"buffer zone\\" along the border, which would have created \\"a no-man's land in which the terrorist could do what they would\\". A confidential memo from the Northern Ireland Office also called for pressure on the Irish Government to discharge the soldiers on the grounds that the safety of the SAS men in an Irish prison could not be guaranteed. Aftermath Although Director of Public Prosecutions Eamonn Barnes was pressured by the Irish Government to drop the charges, the eight SAS men stood trial in March 1977. They were each found guilty and fined ¬£100 for possession of arms and ammunition without firearms licensing. The weapons were returned to the British Government after forensic analysis by the Garda established that they had not used in any crime under investigation by it in the Republic of Ireland. A British military source later explained that the use of a 1:63,000 scale map instead of a 1:20,000 map had led the SAS men to be south of the border without knowing it. In 1976, there were another 54 incursions by British forces inside the Republic's boundaries. On 28 October 1986 there was another cross-border incident in which a British soldier was arrested by the Garda√≠ after an IRA mortar attack on Drummuckavall British Army watchtower in County Armagh. A red Ford Escort was pursued while escaping across the border towards Thomas Murphy's farm by soldiers of the Scots Guards. One of the soldiers, a Lance Corporal, broke into a shed, where he was confronted by two IRA members. The soldier had inadvertently crossed the border and after a brief brawl with the two men, a Garda patrol arrived at the scene and arrested the soldier. He was taken to the Garda√≠ station at Dundalk, but was released six hours later after liaison between senior RUC and Garda officers.

The mission of the CfD is to enable scientific discovery, national security, better living, and commercial innovation through the design and development of advanced photon detectors and associated technology in a broad array of applications (e.g. astrophysics, biomedical imaging, Earth system science, and inter-planetary travel).  Research  Hercules, taken by CfD personnel using the Teledyne Hawaii 4RG SiPIN detector (HyViSI). This was the first demonstration of this device in an astronomical application. The CfD uses a multi-disciplinary approach, spanning the many branches of engineering, imaging science, physics and astronomy. Research pillars of the CfD include, Detectors and Instrumentation, Observational Astrophysics, Wideband Gap Materials, Nanostructures, and Silicon Photonics. = Detectors and Instrumentation = A primary objective of the CfD is the development of advanced detectors and instrumentation for cross-disciplinary applications. Major research projects include the development of detectors that can sense individual photons, cover very large areas of the sky, and have excellent sensitivity in ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths. These devices have specifications that make them ideal for the next generation of large ground-based and space-based astronomical telescopes, for applications such as finding another Earth and determining the nature of dark energy and dark matter. The CfD is also developing two dimensional arrays of micromirrors for astronomical applications. = Observational Astrophysics = This area includes observational research programs spanning the nearby universe of stars and the interstellar medium within the Galaxy to cosmological observations of the large-scale structure of the universe, including studies of fundamental physics. Projects include works that aim to elucidate the nature of the cosmos on the largest scales and most distant times. Other programs include the identification of the upper mass limit to stars and the search for young massive star clusters in the Galaxy. It also includes leadership roles on major future astronomy telescope panels to specify the detector requirements needed in order to satisfy mission science requirements. = Wideband Gap Materials = The Semiconductor Photonics and Electronics Group develops III-V and III-Nitride semiconductors for photonic, optoelectronic, and electronic devices as promising candidates for next generation communication and illumination systems. = Nanostructures = The Epitaxially-Integrated Nanoscale Systems Laboratory in the CfD develops nanostructures using epitaxy of III-V semiconductors on 2-D nanosheets. The research focuses on the growth of various nanostructures, including nanowires and nanofins, by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition through a synthesis process known as selective chemical etching for room temperature benchtop fabrication of flexible III-V nanostructure based optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. = Silicon Photonics = The CfD Integrated Photonics Group develops photonic technology for broad application in commercial, defense, and scientific applications. It also leads a program for integrated photonics education. This area of research is focused on novel silicon photonic devices with the goal of realizing high performance computing communication, and sensing systems that leverage high speed, bandwidth, and sensitivity to light. The Center for Detectors benefits from employees that come from a diverse range of academic programs and professional occupations. The CfD staff includes professors, engineers, and students (undergraduate, masters, and PhD). CfD is grant-funded and has been awarded more than $25M in external funding since 2006. Primary sponsors include NASA, National Science Foundation, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Additional sources of funding include Thermo Fisher Scientific, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, ITT Excelis, and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Outreach and Communications Undergraduate researchers at the RIT Center for Detectors come from over a dozen different majors and ‚Äúcheck their major at the door‚Äù because they will become expert in a new type of major in the CfD ‚Äì the major of ‚Äúsolving real-world research problems.‚Äù Authentic research experiences at the Center for Detectors put students clearly in the critical path of externally-funded projects, a high risk/high reward gambit that has proven to burnish the capabilities of CfD students who have gone out in the world and made outsized impact, such as at Ball Aerospace and SpaceX. Students work in multidisciplinary teams to apply what they know, teach each other and seek out resources necessary for advancing their project. Another key feature in undergraduate research experiences at the center‚Äîand what makes them ‚Äúreal‚Äù‚Äîis the fact that the students are not doing the research to earn a grade or a certain number of credit hours. The ‚ÄúCfD-experience‚Äù trains students to navigate research problems with creativity and resourcefulness. CfD team members have been published in many journals and publications. CfD members were published in over 35 papers in journals such as The Astrophysical Journal and Optics Express in 2018. CfD research was highlighted in popular publications such as the Scientific American and Forbes online. In 2018, CfD members served as expert commentators in articles Astronomy Magazine and New Scientist and as expert authors of strategic planning documents for NASA. For a complete list of CfD member publications go here: CfD Publications. Equipment and Facilities The Center's detector testing system uses custom- built cylindrical vacuum cryogenic dewars. The Center for Detectors (CfD) is located in Engineering Hall (Building 17) at the Rochester Institute of Technology. The CfD headquarters consists of 5,000 square feet of office and research laboratory space. The lab space includes the Rochester Imaging Detector Laboratory, the Laboratory for Experimental Cosmology, the Lobozzo Photonics and Optical Characterization laboratory, the Laboratory for Advanced Instrumentation Research (LAIR), and the Semiconductor Device Optical Property Measurement Laboratory. This laser spot projector is used in the Center for Detectors. The system is mounted on a 3D motorized stage that produces a small point source for measurements of intrapixel sensitivity. Facilities within in CfD include a permanent clean room, ESD stations, vacuum pumping systems, optical benches, flow tables, light sources, UV-IR monochromators, thermal control systems, cryogenic motion control systems, power supplies, general lab electronics, and data reduction computers. The equipment is capable of analyzing both analog and digital signals. In addition to these dedicated facilities, the CfD has access to facilities within the Semiconductor and Microsystems Fabrication Laboratory (SMFL) and other areas across the RIT campus.

History  A 1908 Railway Clearing House map of lines in South London, with the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway and Beckenham extension wending its way across the middle. The first part of the line, between New Wandsworth and Crystal Palace (Low Level), opened 1 December 1856 as the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway. In 1857 the route was extended to Norwood. On 3 May 1858 the company opened an extension from Bromley Junction (near Norwood Junction) to Shortlands railway station (then called Bromley) via Beckenham Junction station. The following year the original line from Pimlico to Norwood Junction was sold to the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, and the section from Bromley Junction to Shortlands to the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, but the WEL&CPR; continued to provide its own passenger services. The two halves were reunited in 1921 as part of the Southern Railway following enactment of the Grouping Act.

The brown, cruciform, stone church was built in a Neo-Gothic style in 1870 by the architect Haakon Mosling. The church seats about 450 people. History The church site has been in use since the 13th century. The oldest reference of the parish was in 1386. There have been two church fires after lightning strikes on this site, the first in 1772 and the second in 1866. The original church had a rectangular floor plan. After the fire in 1772 the walls were repaired and an extension built to the north. Around 1800, the church received an extension to the south. The present stone church building was re-built in 1870 in a cross-shape, creating a cruciform layout. The organ was built by Claus Jensen (1817-1892) in 1879. It was restored by Br. Torkildsen Orgelbyggeri during 2006-2008 at which time the entire church underwent an extensive renovation.

Built in the third quarter of the nineteenth century, it was the center of a prominent murder trial not long after its construction, and it has been designated a historic site. History Mathias Sharp was one of Spencer County's leading early residents. At an uncertain time after the end of the War of 1812, Sharp moved from his native New Jersey to the vicinity of present-day Rockport, where he purchased wide lands along the Ohio River. Here, he became a prosperous farmer, Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs and a prominent citizen of the county.History of Warrick, Spencer, and Perry Counties. Chicago: Goodspeed Bros, 1885. By the mid-1850s, he had established himself firmly enough to be able to participate in the creation of a local high school, buying 2 of the original 176 shares of stock in a company formed to establish the school. Sharp's wife Mary died in 1854, and he remarried slightly less than two years later to a much younger woman, Catherine Shumaker. After about a decade of marriage, the couple had the present house constructed; according to family legend, he built it for her, despite the long gap between their marriage and its construction. Mathias did not long enjoy the new property; just two years after the house was built, he died of apparent poisoning. Just one year later, Catherine married a local merchant, who in turn died in early 1871, less than a year after their marriage. Poison was again suspected, and Catherine was quickly arrested and charged with the murder of her two husbands as well as that of Mary Sharp. The press likened her to Lucrezia Borgia,\\"A Modern Lucretia Borgia - Who Is Accused of Poisoning Two Husbands, and the First Wife of Her First Husband.\\" Freeport Journal-Standard, 1872-02-28, 7. and a widely publicized trial resulted; it was more sensational than all other contemporary trials in the region, despite being moved to the courthouse at Cannelton in Perry County at Catherine's request. Unable to pay for her defense, she gained the help of German-born Rockport businessman John Eigenmann. After she was acquitted of murder, he took possession of the house in exchange for his aid, and his family owned the property until 1913. In that year, it was purchased by Francis Posey, whose family owned it into the late twentieth century. Architecture The Sharp House is a brick building constructed in the plan of a cross; except for the western (rear) arm, it is a two-story structure. The primary entrance is through a door on the western arm; it is accessed by means of a decorated porch and flanked by a transom and sidelights. Numerous windows pierce the walls of the western wing. Despite the westward orientation of the main entrance, the house primarily looks to the east, due to its location atop a bluff on the western bank of the Ohio River. Massive elements, such as a bay window and a large pavilion, contribute to the elaborate appearance of the eastern facade. Other elements present on various sides of the house include decorative porches, stone windowsills, a detailed cornice, and entablatures above many windows. The interior features a grand entrance with a walnut stairway, a cathedral ceiling, eight fireplaces with iron or wooden mantels, oak fretwork, and extensive use of poplar. Preservation Despite its construction in the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the Mathias Sharp House was preserved unusually well by its owners into its second century. Its Italianate style and its location atop a river bluff have made it one of the city's leading buildings. In 1983, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically important architecture.

He served consecutively as Professor and Chairman of three university departments and was inducted as President of the German Society for Surgery in 1985. Stelzner contributed more than 80 books and book chapters to the literature and authored over 450 publications and presentations.Hansen: Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Friedrich Stelzner. Langenbeck's Arch Surg. 392:385, 2007 Throughout his scientific career, Stelzner investigated questions of functional anatomy and its impact on surgical operative methods. Childhood and Education Friedrich Stelzner was born in Franti≈°kovy L√°znƒõ, Czechoslovakia on 4 November 1921, the only son of the railway official Georg Stelzner (1889‚Äì1959) and his wife Helene Brandner (1895‚Äì1969). Stelzner‚Äôs mother Helene came from the nearby town of Cheb, where her father was a master craftsman.Lebenswellen, Lebenswogen im Leben eines Chirurgen. Ecomed, Heidelberg 1998, Friedrich Stelzner spent the first years of his life in Franti≈°kovy L√°znƒõ and attended secondary school in Cheb. Subsequently he attended medical school in Berlin, W√ºrzburg, Giessen and Munich and graduated Summa cum laude in 1945. Stelzner soon after began his surgical residency at the University of Erlangen where he was boarded in General Surgery in 1949. Three years later, he was appointed as a Private docent based on a thesis that focused on the radical removal of rectal cancer with preservation of anal continence function.Hansen: Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Friedrich Stelzner. Langenbeck's Arch Surg. 392:385, 2007 1955-1967: Member of the Surgical Faculty at the University of Hamburg Following advice from his mentor Otto Goetze in Erlangen, Stelzner joined the surgical faculty at the University of Hamburg in 1955. He received a scholarship from the British Council to complete additional training in colorectal surgery at London's St Mark's Hospital. The collaboration with leading colorectal surgeons in Britain left a strong impression on Stelzner and strengthened his desire to specialize in this field.Lebenswellen, Lebenswogen im Leben eines Chirurgen. Ecomed, Heidelberg 1998, Inspired by the experience, Stelzner wrote the first edition of his standard work on anorectal fistulas.Stelzner: [The anorectal fistulas]. Springer, 3rd Edition, Berlin 1981, For this monograph, Stelzner was awarded the Langenbeck prize, the highest scientific award of the German Society for Surgery in 1960. In collaboration with the anatomist Jochen Staubesand, Stelzner investigated the exact structure of the hemorrhoidal vessels. He demonstrated that hemorrhoids are not enlarged venous structures, but rather arteriovenous cushions for which he coined the term corpus cavernosum recti. These cushions have great importance for the anal continence. Stelzner also developed the concept of anorectal continence organ. He pointed out that this organ shows significant differences in males and females.Friedrich Stelzner: Die Chirurgie an viszeralen Abschlu√üsystemen. Thieme, Stuttgart 1998, , S. 56ff. This has bearing on the details and the outcome of anorectal surgical procedures. Further studies revealed the spiral structure of the esophageal wall muscles. Stelzner worked with the anatomist Werner Lierse in these studies and made use of translucent muscular preparations and serial sections of esophagi, which were processed in situ. Knowledge of the exact structure of the muscular wall of the esophagus forms the basis of surgical procedures for treatment of achalasia and gastroesophageal reflux disease. 1967-1987: Professor and Chairman of Surgery In 1967, Stelzner was offered to head the surgical department of the University of T√ºbingen. However, around the same time, the chair position in Hamburg became vacant and was offered to him as well. Stelzner accepted the latter position and was appointed as Professor and Chairman at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf in 1968.Hansen: Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Friedrich Stelzner. Langenbeck's Arch Surg. 392:385, 2007 Already two years later, Stelzner accepted the chair at the surgical department of the University of Frankfurt. Here he developed a close collaboration with the department chair for comparative anatomy, Dietrich Starck, with whom he identified the enveloping fascias of the rectum and of the neck. These serve as important lead structures for the radical removal of malignant tumors. Further studies (again with Werner Lierse) described the morphological bases of appendicitis and diverticulitis. In 1976, Stelzner received simultaneous offers to chair the surgical departments of the universities of Vienna and Bonn and Stelzner decided to assume the department leadership in Bonn. A number of morphological studies from this period focus on the causes of pilonidal sinus disease and of tract-forming suppurative hidradenitis as well the embryology and function of the pelvic structures. In 1985, Stelzner became President of the German Society for Surgery. From 1987: Professor Emeritus Stelzner announced his retirement in 1987, but he led the university hospital for another two years until his successor took office in 1989. In the following years, Stelzner continued to perform minor surgical operations. After 1995, he was no longer active as a clinical surgeon.Hansen: Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Friedrich Stelzner. Langenbeck's Arch Surg. 392:385, 2007 However, his main focus was henceforth on his scientific work. A major innovation was Stelzner's application of PET-CT to visualize and study the spontaneous activity of gastrointestinal sphincter systems. Other work established the existence of two separate lymphatic systems, which are located beneath the epithelia and deeply in the mesenchyme.Hansen: Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Friedrich Stelzner.

Therefore, tribunals (such as the Constitutional Tribunal and State Tribunal) are, in a strict definition, not part of Polish judiciary, but in a broad definition, they are included in it. The common courts, divided into appellate courts, district courts and regional courts, have the competency in criminal, civil, economic, labor and family law.

The war of succession and the ensuing civil war lasted from 1720 to 1729 and resulted in the partitioning of the Ramnad kingdom reducing its power and influence.  Prelude  Raghunatha Kilavan, the founder of the Kingdom of Ramnad, died in 1710. He was an excellent soldier and his death left behind a huge void. Prior to his death, Kilavan had first nominated his illegitimate son, Bhavani Shankar and later, due to protests from the people, chose his younger son, Vijayaraghunatha Sethupathi to succeed him. Bhavani Shankar abided by the king's decision but an uneasy calm prevailed throughout Ramnad.  Events  Bhavani Shankar eventually revolted in 1720 and securing the help of the Thanjavur Maratha king Serfoji I and the Raja of Pudukkottai, invaded Vijayaraghunatha Sethupathi's seat at Aranthangi. While defending the city, Vijayaraghunatha Sethupathi fell victim to plague and died. Just before his death, Vijayaraghunatha Sethupathi nominated Tanda Deva, a great-grandson of Raghunatha Kilavan's father to succeed him but before he could acceded to the throne, Bhavani Shankar overthrew him with the support and influence of one of Kilavan's concubines. Tanda Deva secured the support of the Madurai Nayak king and the Raja of Pudukkottai who had switched sides and invaded Aranthani forcing Bhavani Shankar to flee to Thanjavur. But, Bhavani Shankar won over the Thanjavur Maratha ruler promising him Aranthangi in return and defeated the combined armies of Ramnad, Madurai and Pudukkottai within two or three months. Tanda Deva was eventually captured and killed. Bhavani Shankar ascended the throne for a second time but did not rule for long. His reign was highly unpopular and most of his trusted generals deserted him. Meanwhile, Bhavani Shankar had earned the ire of the Thanjavur Maratha ruler Tukkoji as he had failed to keep up his promise of delivering Aranthangi to the Thanjavur Marathas. The discontented elements in the kingdom, therefore, approached the Tukkoji and sought his help in overthrowing Bhavani Shankar. Tukkoji invaded Ramnad. Bhavani Shankar was defeated in 1729 in the Battle of Uraiyur and taken prisoner to Thanjavur.  Aftermath  The victorious Thanjavur Maratha forces partitioned the Kingdom of Ramnad into three - all the territories to the north of Pambar River were annexed to the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom. The rest of the kingdom was more or less equally split between Kattaya Deva, a nobleman in the Ramnad court and the maternal uncle of Tanda Deva, who ascended the throne of Ramnad as Kumara Muthu Vijayaraghunatha Sethupathi and one of the Ramnad feudatories who became the first Raja of Sivaganga. The Ramnad kingdom lost most of its power and influence due to this war.

The majority of the Tharakans are located in Valluvanad, with major agglomerations around Vayillyamkunnu, Katambazhippuram, Sreekrishnapuram, Mangode, Thiruvazhiyodu, Chethallur and Mannarkkad. Many Sanskrit scholars and popular astrologers originated from this community. Etymology The word Tharakan literally means the holder of document of Raja (Tharakan : Common letter or document of Raja, Gundert's dictionary). They are so called because they were the recipients of 'Tharaku' or writ of social privilege issued to them by the ruling head of the Zamorins of Calicut.\\"Census of India, 1961, Volume 7\\" P. 21 Tharakan is an honorific title possessed by ancient traders. The word is rooted from Tamil word Tharaku/Tharavu-which means brokering or commission. The word is also linked with placing an order, tax or tariff and commodity trade. Sometimes the word is also related to lending money. In Tamil to denote a broker, people use Tharakar or Tharagar. So it can be assumed that a tharakan is the one who intermediates between manufacturer and buyer. Gothram Tharakans belong to Kshatriya group and are Saivites.'Desayanam by EP Bhaskara Guptan', P53 Tharakan trace their origin from Chola mandalam and claims that they belong to Kannaki‚Äôs community (heroine of Tamil epic Chilappathikaram). Mannadiyar, Guptan, Moothan, and Pathukudi are the related ethnic groups. A section of Tharakan community in Angadippuram became Nairs as per the advice of king. Agriculture and business were their traditional ways of earning a living in times past. They follow Makkathaayam traditions and the after death pollution time (Pula ) for family members is 10 days. Male members are identified by their family (Tharavad) name and female members move in with their husband's family after marriage and keep the husband's family name. The title \\"Guptan\\" is common after middle age. Married female members were earlier addressed as \\"AkathaaL\\" (in short as \\"Thaal\\" ‚àí means the person lives inside the house) and with time, the suffix transformed to \\"Ammal\\" and later to Amma and Gupta. Origin =Legend= There are some details available about the origin of this community ‚Äì in 'KOTTICHEZHUNNALLATH' 'Zamorins of Calicut, P.111' (The first programme used to be conducted by Samoothiri (Zamorin) kings after swearing on ceremony of each Eralppad- second in command ‚àí to establish their control over the region. The last KOTTICHEZHUNNALLATH was believed to be held in 1909 ). It points to the era way back to 13th‚àí14th century which says about the asylum of a minister and his men from a local kingdom in the bank of river Kaveri of then Cholamandalam ‚Äì to the king of Calicut (Kozhikkode) ‚Äì The dispute arose from the decision of local king to marry the clever daughter of the minister who had found out a solution for a challenging problem which was haunting the king for days together. The legend ‚Äì The challenge was to make a necklace within 41 days, using a bowl of peculiar pearls which was gifted by some foreign traders to the king. Being curved holes inside, many famous brilliant pandits had tried and failed to make a pearl necklace. However the intelligent teenage daughter of the minister could succeed in finding a solution for the challenge and making the necklace with the help of some ants by using a ghee applied thread making it a pearl necklace. Impressed up on the extraordinary intelligence of the girl who made the pearl necklace the ruling king wanted to marry her. But as the king was inferior in caste, the minister and his related families disagreed. The angry king gave ultimatum for accepting the marriage or all vaishyas to leave the kingdom. Due to this the entire vaishya population in the desom consisting of many sections, around 7200 families, had to travel away from chola-desam and were segregated in groups. Some of the groups traveled towards west to Cheranaadu (presently Keralam). As they had a bitter experience of living in a kingdom where they could not get the justice from their king, they decided to settle in a Desam(place) where the ruling king has vision and justice. To find that, they used to present a pot filled with gold but covered with a layer of sugar on top. They had the habit of sitting before the king (which was meant disrespectful, and after giving the pot, they requested the king to give them land for living. Normally the kings to whom they approached rejected their request by thinking it was foolish to give them land in lieu of sugar. Finally they reached Walluvanad area and approached Samoothiri (Zamorin) of Kozhikkode (Calicut)for land. They had the same test with Zamorin. But King Zamorin got annoyed of their sitting and asked his minister \\" Mangattachan\\" to check the pot. After finding the golden powder in the pot Zamorin appraised of their cleverness but to check their integrity, asked them to come again next day. To test them, Zamorin made the sitting place muddy but they again sat there after spreading a cloth, though it was muddy. After this, the king understood it was not that they did not want to respect the king but it was their habit. Impressed by their intelligence and straight forwardness, Samoothiri gave permission to build 'nagarams' (at places they liked) and sent pathinaayirathil nair ‚Äì The chieftain who can arrange that much warriors on demand by zamorin ‚Äì along with them and asked them to meet the king after construction of their Kuladevatha temples. They built four 'nagarams' called Puthanangadi, Thiruvazhiyode, Vayillyamkunnu and Mangode (current names Chethallur, Thiruvazhiyode / sreekrishnapuram, Katampazhippuram and Mangode respectively) for cultivation and trade. After construction of temples, they met samoothiri along with their acharya. Impressed by the acharya's sivapooja and devotion, Samoothiri gave more land and arranged adiyantharakkar for them (the temple constructed for those adiyanthirakkar - \\"kammalasserykkaavu\\" is still there near Thiruvazhiyode) 'Desayanam' published by Samabhavini books p. 54 but as per the local tradition, samoothiri restricted the wearing of poonool (the sacred thread) to upanayanam & marriage time only and later the tradition has been discontinued. =Historical background= It is believed that the groups consisting of Tharakan along with members of Guptans community reached valluvanad were of Eralpuram, Adithyapuram, Paschimapuram & Ramapuram nagarams under the leadership of the minister SANKARA NAYANAR ( belonging to Eralpuram nagaram) and they took their kuladevatha (Goddess) Bhagavathy and acharya Gyanasivacharya along with them.. Thiruvazhiyode nagaram was considered the \\"Melnagaram\\" among the four nagarams and the tradition of giving \\"Nagarappanam\\" to Thiruvazhiyode group during marriage (if any one of bride-groom is from Thiruvazhiyode) was followed in earlier days. This ritual was to mark respect for the \\"Aadi Nayanar\\".Mounathinte Devankanam by 'Dr Rajan Chungath' published in Mathrubhumi The name Tharakan was assigned to this group belonging to valluvanad region, by Zamorin(being vaishya and part of \\"Thraivarnnikam\\" ) through Punnasseri Nambi Neelakanta Sharma (earlier addressed as Moothan (Moothavan meaning elder) 'Land marks in social anthropology by Edgar Thurston and sometimes as Ezhssan(Ezhuthachan), Menon (Melavan ‚Äì a position in village), Andaar (Andavan), etc.). The title was initially started at Punnassery Namby Gurukulam (Saraswathodyodini), Pattambi where prominent Sanskrit scholar and astrologer CK Krishna Guptan was the beloved disciple of Sri Nambi. Later Guptans became part of the history of valluvanadan area. DESAYANAM published by samabhavini books ‚Äì which narrates the history of Vayillyamkunnu desam of pre-independence era ‚Äì gives more details about Guptans and their history. Religion and hereditary Durga (Parasakthi)of \\"Ardhanareeswara\\" concept of Lord Siva was predominant and reflected in their traditions and customs. \\"Saktheya\\" upasana was very common in Tharakan families in olden days. It was a tradition to conduct Saktheya pooja (Bhuvaneswari pooja) once in a year in each family earlier, for overall prosperity and still some families are following this tradition. Suryanarayanan Ezhuthachan preface to 'chintharathnam' by 'Dr. PK Narayana Pillai', P.36 and his nephew Devaguru ‚Äì Thunchan's beloved disciples ‚Äì were performing Saktheya pooja and their successors of Chozhiyath family of Mangalamkunnu (near Ottappalam ) perform Saktheya poojas even now. The usage of Thunchath, Chozhiyath, Chokkath by locals were popular in this area until the second half of the 20th century. In the family goddess (paradevatha) concept, each Tharakan family is attached to one of the three Bhagavathi Temples, viz. Panamkurussi( Chethallur ), Vayillyamkunnu (Kadampazhippuram) and Thiruruvaraykkal (Thiruvazhiyode) situated in the erstwhile Valluvanad area of the Palakkad District. Vayillyamkunnu Bhagavathy temple is considered as one of the three Thirumandhamkunnu Temples 'Thirumandhamkunnu Kshethra Mahathmyam'P.19 along with Angadippuram & Kongad,.[9] A story related to Samoothiri( Zamorin ) about the power of Panamkurussy Bhagavathy on his way to Karimpuzha [disambiguation needed] is still popular in Chethallur area. The other Nagara temple of \\"Mangode\\" is attached to related community \\"Tharakan\\". Moothans of Palakkad town and the Mannadiyars of Nenmara and Kollengode are other similar community groups related to them.  Demography  Tharakan population is spread within Palakkad district only. The major pockets being Katampazhippuram, Mangalamkunnu, Thiruvazhiyode, Punchapadam, Sreekrishnapuram, Mannampetta, Pulappetta, Peringode, Kongad, Mannarkkad, Thachanattukara, Attasseri, Olavakkode, Edathanattukara, Chethallur, Chunangad, Mangode, Pookottukav, vellinezhi, etc. Lifestyle and occupation According to Gundert, they were originally warehouse-keepers at Palghat. Tharakans are Kshetram Ooralans of many famous temples like Thiruvaraikkal temple and Vayilyamkunnu temple. Tharakan houses are called Tharavads. Each tharavad has a unique name. Mostly tharavad names ends with ‚ÄòAth‚Äô or ‚ÄòAthu‚Äô- which means home in Tamil. The Marriages between the members from same Tharavad is prohibited in this caste.Tharakans follow Makkathayam tradition. Tharakans were traders in ancient days. However they turned to agriculture sector after they migrated into Malabar land. Families without even a small paddy field was very rare in those times. The cross section of the community was a blend, ranging from poor farmers to big feudal land lords. Most of their houses were called \\"Kalam\\" (‡¥ï‡¥≥‡¥Ç) which means the place for after ‚Äì harvesting activities of paddy. After the land reforms, the attraction of agriculture was in the downward trend and some have shifted to plantation field and later focused on education, business and service sectors. Teaching was the most popular profession in earlier days among the community and many prominent Teachers with their proud disciples had positively contributed towards the improvement of their community as well as the society in general. Today's generations are more focused on professional education and many have excelled in the fields of Engineering, Medical Science, Robotics, Space Technology, Computer Software, Defence etc. But there is almost a vacuum in the area of political and civil administration. Food habits are a mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Though many women still prefer to be vegetarian but majority of men eat non- vegetarian food (mainly fish & chicken). Other than the normal Hindu festivals like Onam, Vishu& Thiruvathira, another special festival related to Onam, 'POTTA THIRUVONAM' (on the day of Thiruvonam star coming in the Malayalam month of 'thulam') used to be celebrated in olden days mainly for showing the sister's affection to their brothers ‚Äì similar to the concept of Rakhi of North India. One major occasion of family get together of these groups are during the annual temple 'pooram'(‡¥™‡µÇ‡¥∞‡¥Ç) festival of their respective paradevatha temples.  Marriage customs and traditions  Tharakan's marriage related processes start from \\"Ashtamangalyam\\" (‡¥Ö‡¥∑‡µç‡¥ü‡¥Æ‡¥Ç‡¥ó‡¥≤‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥Ç) function ‚Äì the engagement at bride's residence. After horoscope matching, on the day of \\"Ashtamangalyam\\", a \\"Thamboola Prasnam\\" ‚Äì astrological prediction based on Beettle leaves and Deepam (oil lamp) ‚Äì will be conducted as a ritual and results of the \\"Prasna\\" will be interpreted to all relatives assembled there. (This is to take remedial measures and precautions for hurdles foreseen in the future married life, if any.). Other customs connected to this function are tying of horoscopes of bride & groom together symbolically for the fixation of marriage and \\"Pon veykkal\\" ( presenting Gold ornament to bride) by Groom's relatives (normally sister of groom) followed by feast. Dowry system is not in this community and rather a tradition of giving ONAPPUDAVA (‡¥ì‡¥£‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡µÅ‡¥ü‡¥µ) ‚Äì giving clothes ‚Äì by groom to the relatives (of both bride & groom) is still followed during marriage as part of taking blessings from elders. Marriage is normally called \\"PAANIGRAHANAM\\" ( ‡¥™‡¥æ‡¥£‡µÄ‡¥ó‡µç‡¥∞‡¥π‡¥£‡¥Ç ) and it is a simple function nowadays. Today's marriages are for one day and some major customs still followed are \\"Nadhaswaram\\" ‚Äì treated as sacred music will be accompanied, THALAPPOLI ‚Äì receiving function at bride's residence(marriage hall)by girls with a tray of flowers and oil lamp, KAALU KAZHUKAL ‚Äì Bride's younger brother will clean the groom's feet while receiving him to the mandapam, THALIKETTU (solemn Vow) ‚Äì Tying the thali chain in the bride's neck and exchange of rings there after, PAANIGRAHANAM (accepting the bride by taking holy vows) ‚Äì Bride's uncle ( or father) will perform the \\"kanya daanam\\" by keeping the hand of bride into the hand of groom and AGNI PRADHAKSHINAM ‚Äì after holding the hands mutually by a knot of their small fingers, groom and bride together move around the \\"Vivaha-homa agni\\"-the sacred fire. Palum Pazhavum' (feeding sweet milk and banana after marriage) and 'Kavukeral'( visiting their respective paradevatha temples after 7 days of marriage) are other customs related to marriage. Kaikottikkali, an important art form by women folk used to be performed in bride's house (the night before the marriage) and groom's residence (on the final day of marriage after receiving bride and groom) in olden days. Elite class used to conduct Kathakali too. '  Birth-related rituals  On birth of a child in the family, the main rituals are 'Irupathettu' ‚Äì the first birth day (star) as per lunar calendar (28th day after birth) and 'Choroon' (‡¥ö‡µã‡¥±‡µÇ‡¥£‡µç) ‚Äì first feeding of food (annaprasam) in 6th month along with child's naming ceremony. Shashtipoorthy (‡¥∑‡¥∑‡µç‡¥†‡¥ø‡¥™‡µÇ‡¥∞‡µç‚Äç‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥ø) ‚Äì 60th birthday & Sathabhishekam(‡¥∂‡¥§‡¥æ‡¥≠‡¥ø‡¥∑‡µá‡¥ï‡¥Ç) ‚Äì seeing of 1000 full moon/84th birth day, are celebrated widely . Death rituals Tharakan observe 10 days of defilement (pula- after death pollution time). After cremation (burial in olden days), the eldest son will follow deeksha for these days (or for a mandalam ‚Äì 41 days or a year). On 9th day is 'Athazha oottu' and on 10th day, 'Sanchayanam' ‚Äì collection of bones of the demised person ‚Äì followed by 'Baliitharppanam' by 'seshakriyakkar'. 'Nimanjanam' of the collected bones will be done at Thirunelli, Thirunavaya or in a nearby river on 10th day or after a year. Cultural and Social Heritage Vayillyamkunnu was one of the major cultural centers in south Malabar during pre-independence era due to the excellence of many Sanskrit scholars in the area. It is believed that great Thunchan and Sree Punnassery Nambi had blessed this place because of the presence their beloved disciples. The community has produced a number of scholars. Tharakan mingled well with other communities in the region. Some initiative took place in the direction of caste cohesion during the 1980s when 'Arya Vaisya Samajam' was launched and it works for the welfare of the members by promoting academic excellence, etc. 'Aryayogam Matrimonial Services' is another initiative in the social front today.

Background In 1969 the Saunders brothers cut a 14-song high school garage-rock album I'm a Roadrunner Motherfucka in their hometown of Little Rock, under a twice-used local band name, The Rockin' Blewz. The album went unissued until the late 1990s. Timeline of the Angry Samoans releases and members Mike Saunders briefly played in an embryonic backing lineup for 1950s rockabilly cult artist Ray Campi during 1975, before moving back to Arkansas for two years (pursuant to a second college degree). Bassist Homer had played in 1977 Masque-era band Jesus Prick, and drummer Vockeroth was a veteran of the Pasadena \\"backyard kegger party\\" cover band circuit (which also spawned Van Halen). During 1978, both Turner and Mike Saunders played with rock critic Richard Meltzer in the Los Angeles punk band VOM, which issued a posthumous five-song EP Live at Surf City on White Noise Records in early summer 1978. Patrick ‚ÄúP.J.‚Äù Galligan was formerly a member of heavy metal band Cirith Ungol. Galligan died from throat cancer in 2014. History The first Angry Samoans gig was on October 30, 1978, opening for Roky Erickson and the Aliens in Richmond, California. Erickson was sick and did not make the show (Aliens band members covered for his lead vocals) but remained a lifelong friend and inspiration to Turner. The next night, the Samoans played an \\"all-LA bill\\" at the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, opening for Shock and the Zeros. The Samoans' first release, Inside My Brain, featuring P.J. Galligan on lead guitar as a replacement for Bonze Blayk, was one of the earliest hardcore punk albums to come out of the 1980s LA punk rock scene. Between this recording and second album Back from Samoa, the band released a four-song EP as \\"The Queer Pills\\", allegedly using the pseudonym for the EP to get airtime on Bingenheimer's KROQ radio program. Their 14-song, 17-minute hardcore album Back from Samoa, released in 1982, featured lyrics with such themes as the trendiness of poking your eyes out (\\"Lights Out\\"), anthropomorphizing Adolf Hitler's penis (\\"They Saved Hitler's Cock\\"), and dissing your father (\\"My Old Man's A Fatso\\"), sung over hyper-distorted guitars and early LA/OC hardcore drum beats. In the mid-1980s, the Angry Samoans added guitarist Steve Drojensky, and returned to their roots in mid-1960s American garage rock (they had long cited bands such as The Velvet Underground, the 13th Floor Elevators and Shadows of Knight as among their musical influences). The next two releases recorded during 1986‚Äì87, the Yesterday Started Tomorrow EP and STP Not LSD, were largely in this neo-1960s garage/psych style. Homer left at the end of 1988 and formed The Mooseheart Faith Stellar Groove Band with Larry Robinson, formerly of 1970s teen pop-soul band Apollo. In 2005, Homer formed free-jazz band The Hollywood Squaretet with comedian/drummer Larry \\"Copcar\\" Scarano, formerly of Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen (HBO) and the 1960s New York rock band, The Bougalieu. Turner left in early 1992, releasing an album, Santa Fe in 1993 with The Mistaken, which featured guitarist Sean O'Brien (formerly of Come), bassist Heath Siefert (formerly of Backbiter) and drummer Kelly Callan (formerly of Wednesday Week). Turner's next band, The Blood Drained Cows, issued two albums, and occasionally features autoharp player Billy Angel (n√©e Miller) from the Aliens. During the mid- to late 1980s, Mike Saunders moonlighted in several electric/acoustic two-guitar duos (no rhythm section) such as The Clash Brothers (with Bob Fagan), The Sons of Mellencamp (with Turner), and The Gizmo Brothers (with Kenne Highland), performing at various small clubs during that period in San Francisco, LA/OC, and even Boston (with Krazee Ken Highland from The Gizmos and Hopelessly Obscure). \\"Get Off the Air\\" controversy In late January 1979, Mike Saunders, Turner and Homer wrote an infamous song about longtime LA/Hollywood scenemaker and KROQ-FM DJ Rodney Bingenheimer, titled \\"Get Off the Air\\".Blayk, Bonze Anne Rose, \\"GET OFF THE AIR\\", includes scan of original lyrics; Retrieved 2011-02-12 When the song was included on the band's first record Inside My Brain, the Samoans were blacklisted at the Starwood, the Whisky a Go Go, and other clubs in the Hollywood/LA area from mid-1980 through late 1982, seemingly due to Bingenheimer's strong influence with the LA/Hollywood club scene. Recent activity The Angry Samoans have continued from the late 1980s onward with Mike Saunders, original drummer Vockeroth and a wide variety of other individuals. They have performed mainly along the West Coast, aside from occasional out-of-state weekend trips and three short, successful tours of mainland Europe in 2003, 2007 and 2008. In 2010, they performed on the Legends Stage on four dates of the Vans Warped Tour. Gregg Turner is toured in October 2019 with The Oblivians as a solo act, in anticipation of a re-release of Angry Samoans discography.

Rukiah (also known as Siti Rukiah Kertapati) was an Indonesian poet and novelist. Biography Siti Rukiah was born in Purwakarta, West Java on April 25, 1927. After her graduation, she pursued teaching in Purwakarta, before initiating her career into writing. She began by writing poems for magazines like \\"Age Wave\\", and moved on to write short stories, children's stories and novels. In 1948, she joined the literary magazine Poedjangga Baroe as its Purwakarta correspondent, and in 1950 she moved to Jakarta to become the journal's editorial secretary. Her first novel also appeared in 1950, entitled Kedjatuhan dan Hati (The Fall and the Heart). Though a lesser known classic, the novel strongly presents the dark side of the revolution touching the lives of peoples and their emotions. The novel is a forceful rendition of a woman's struggle during the country's independence struggle as well as in the period post-independence. It stands as the only novel that explores the negative impact of war on personal relationship through the character of a middle-class woman who lived during the Indonesian National Revolution. Realizing its significance as a classic piece of prose by a woman writer before the 1970s, Rukiah's novel became one of the first five titles chosen by the Lontar Foundation for its new Modern Library of Indonesia series. In 1951 she relocated to Bandung and became the editor of the children's magazine \\"Paradise\\". In 1952, her collection of short stories and poems was published under the title Deficient, which won national literary prize. In the same year she started writing children's stories under her married name, \\"S. Rukiah Kertapati\\", and published continuously in this field until 1964. She also compiled an anthology of realistic fiction in the form of short stories with her lover and husband, Sidik Kertapati, titled The Love Love, along with another collection, Teragedi Humanity. Though Rukiah never joined LEKRA, the cultural wing of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), she was chosen the member of LEKRA central leadership in 1959. Owing to this affiliation, her books were banned during the overthrow of President Sukarno and the forbidding of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in 1965. As a result of the events of 1965, she suffered emotional trauma, which put a halt to her creative self.

She was a member of the South Australian Legislative Council (1982‚Äì2003) and held several ministerial posts.  Early life  Laidlaw was born in London, the daughter of Don Laidlaw and Vivienne Laidlaw (n√©e Perry), both law graduates of the University of Adelaide. Her grandfather was the founder of Perry Engineering.  Political career  Her early political career was as an assistant to state and federal politicians before being elected to the Legislative Council in 1982. She entered cabinet in 1993 when the Brown government (1993-1996) came to power in the 1993 election, where she remained under the subsequent Olsen (1996-2001) and Kerin (2001-2002) governments, after which the Liberals lost power with the election of the Rann government. Laidlaw variously served as the Minister for Transport (1995‚Äì1997), the Minister for Transport and Urban Planning (1997‚Äì2002), the Minister for the Arts (1993‚Äì2002), and the Minister for the Status of Women (1993‚Äì2002).

Bo (aka Bo Dennis, surname of adoptive name \\"Beth Dennis\\", and Bo Jones, false ID name) is a superhuman bisexual succubus. The character is portrayed by Anna Silk. In the first episode of the series, It's a Fae, Fae, Fae, Fae World, Bo saved a young human woman named Kenzi from a rapist, and despite their differences the two quickly became friends. Confronted by the local Fae leaders with having to pick a clan, either \\"Light\\" or \\"Dark\\", Bo declared herself neutral, choosing to side with humans after Kenzi risked her life to find out where Bo had been forcefully taken and then helped Bo break free from a trance by calling out to her. Throughout the first season, Bo learns more about the Fae world and her supernatural nature, while searching for information about her origins. Along the way, Bo also develops romantic relationships with both Dyson, a Light Fae wolf-shapeshifter and police detective in the human police force; and Lauren, a human doctor and scientist in servitude to the Light Fae. In 2012, \\"Bo\\" was No. 35 in the AfterEllen list of Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters; and in 2013, No. 10 in its Top 65 Kick-Ass Female Fantasy Characters. In 2014, \\"Bo Dennis\\" was named No. 92 in the British Film Institute list of the top 100 Best Sci-Fi Characters of All Time.  Fictography  = Childhood and early years = Bo is a succubus who grew up in an adopted human family, unaware of her non-human nature and of the Fae world she descended from. In \\"Raging Fae\\", she told Kenzi that she began to feel \\"different\\" when she entered puberty and didn't know she was not normal until she accidentally killed her high school boyfriend by draining his life energy during her first sexual activity. When she told her parents what had happened, they broke the news to Bo that she had been adopted. Not knowing what she was and what she had done, Bo hated herself and ran away from home, exchanging her previous life for one without family or friends, moving from place to place and assuming a false identity whenever she killed again. = Powers = As a succubus, she can seduce and manipulate both humans and Fae with the touch of her skin; and has the power to absorb the life force (the \\"chi\\", or Qi) of humans and Fae by drawing it out through their mouths. She feeds and heals from oral chi intake, and chi absorbed from the sexual energy created with males or females. At first she could not feed without killing her sexual partners; but with Lauren's help Bo learned to control her sexual drive and chi-drawing powers so that she could have sex with both Fae and humans without injuring or killing them. Although Fae are stronger than humans and can better endure her feeding on them, they are not immune from being drained. Without self-control Bo can render them comatose or dead. In \\"(Dis)Members Only\\", Dyson's chi is drained by Bo's succubus birth mother, Aife, and Bo brings him back to life by transferring some of her own life energy into him.  Relationships  = The Love Triangle = The relationship between Bo and Dyson/Bo and Lauren is known as \\"The Love Triangle\\". Initially, there was rivalry between Dyson and Lauren over Bo, as neither one wanted her to be with the other, but they tolerated it. As the series progressed, Dyson and Lauren began to understand each other and the role they played in Bo's life, with the animosity that used to exist between them fading in favor of helping and protecting Bo. What Bo meant to them and they to her was tested throughout the series, with the relationship between Dyson and Bo evolving into an unequivocal friendship, while Lauren and Bo remained in love through hurdles and episodic distance.

In 2002 he became president of entertainment for Disney Channel, before being named president of Disney Channels Worldwide in 2004, where he oversaw the Disney Channel, Disney XD, Playhouse Disney, Disney Cinemagic, Hungama, GXT, Jetix, and Radio Disney brands. He is credited with establishing Disney's global kids' TV business as the prime entertainment source for the tween market with shows like Hannah Montana, Lizzie McGuire, Wizards of Waverly Place, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and The Suite Life on Deck, That's So Raven and Phineas and Ferb.

Due to the film's weak North American performance compared to its high production and marketing costs, Disney expected the film would generate a loss of about $200 million during its second fiscal quarter, although its box office strength outside North America led some analysts to speculate that the write-down would be significantly less than expected.

Although it chronologically precedes Ice, it was written several years after Ice was published. Plot summary The protagonist is a young boy named Alexander growing up with a well-off family in the Ukraine. Around 1918 when he turned 10 the Russian civil war forced him and his family to leave their home in hopes of trying to escape to Warsaw but they were hit by artillery fire and killed his father, brother, and uncle. The protagonist ends up living with an aunt in Moscow and attending college there. His aunt ends up being arrested at which point the protagonist abandons the apartment they were living in and has already dropped out of college. The protagonist decides to go on an expedition to find the Tungus meteorite which happened to strike earth the same day he was born. During this expedition, the protagonist abandons the group and makes a spiritual connection with the meteorite which he describes as \\"Ice\\". The Ice tells the protagonist that he is a member of the brotherhood of the light, his name is Bro, and he must go out into the world and find the rest of 23,000 members.The brotherhood of the light created the universe but made one mistake which was earth. People and animals are disrupting the universe and the 23,000 want to come together to destroy the earth and restore order to the universe. The protagonist immediately sets out to accomplish this goal. Characters Bro-The protagonist of the story. Originally named Alexander Snegirev, he was born June 30, 1908, the same day that the meteor reached the Earth. During his childhood, he develops a fascination with astronomy and, after dropping out of college, is given an opportunity to search for the meteor that fell the day he was born. During this trip, he finds the ice from the meteor and falls, striking his chest, and awakens with a new identity. His heart tells him that his new name is Bro and his goal is to unite all 23,000 of his brothers and sisters of the Light. Fer-The first sister that Bro awakens using a hammer constructed from the ice. She and Bro often have a very strong connection, referred to as the heart magnet, which helps them find their other brothers and sisters. Together, they are the only ones who are able to distinguish between average people and their siblings. Ep-The first brother, who is awakened by both Bro and Fer. Ig- Originally named Deribas. He was part of an illegal group of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party and later became an ambassador of the OGPU, the predecessor of the KGB. Due to his position, he is able to help Bro and their siblings adapt to human life by providing them with jobs. Khram-One of the successors of Fer and Bro. Like her two siblings, she has a seeing heart. At the end of the novel, she must travel east to find her other half - the other sibling with the ability to find the members of the Light. Major themes Connection to Nazi Germany-Another theme that comes into play later in the novel is the themes associated with Nazi Germany. Sorokin has been quoted saying that, ‚Äúits frightening that all cities are beginning to resemble each other. People are becoming the same and dressing the same. The complete unification of humanity is underway.‚Äù In Bro the Brotherhood encounters Hitler and Nazi Germany, and the theme of one person or group controlling the whole is brought up. An article by Birgit Menzel talks about the themes in Bro: \\"The idea of an elected Indo-Aryan race with the mission to purge the world of millions of unworthy lives refers to the connection between Nazi mysticism and the Russian nationalist version of the occult one finds in the theories of Alexander Dugin and Lev Gumilyov.\\" Identity-The protagonist of the story changes irrevocably after the explosion which kills his brother, father, and uncle. The protagonist then acquires a new identity, and becomes not truly human. Identity, and the concept of being reborn is a theme constantly touched upon in this novel. Religion - Certain features of the novel are particularly reminiscent of religion, especially notions of creation myths, heaven, the brotherhood, and souls. Perhaps the most prominent example in the novel is the tale Bro internalizes when he undergoes his awakening. Similar to the creation myth of other religions, the story begins with an ultimate being, in this case, the Primordial Light creating the universe, including the Earth, inhabited by the 23,000 light rays, which evolve into the brotherhood. This brotherhood, comparable to any religious congregation, further contributes to the religious allusions. Within the group, they often use their heart rather than speech, placing greater emphasis on emotion, rather than reason, symbolizing a favoring of the soul, an important notion in religion. As Alexei Pavlenko writes: \\"Sorokin's language about the heart's awakening and its ability to communicate with other awakened hearts is compelling because it resonates with an ancient and rich mythology. In the Judeo-Christian and other ancient traditions‚Ä¶the heart is seen as the center of man's life, the point of ultimate presence.\\" Finally, although Sorokin never explicitly addresses the afterlife, it is implied that the brotherhood are reunited after death, in an environment similar to heaven. Society-In his interview, Sorokin states that The Ice Trilogy representative of his disappointment with society: \\"More precisely, contemporary civilization means the entire twentieth century, whose ready-made goods for mass consumption, mediocre taste and mass production have gradually transformed people into 'meat machines.' Multiply this by the total atheism advancing upon us, and human begins become a cog in this machine‚Ä¶\\" To reflect this view, Sorokin has attributed the name 'meat machine' to the ordinary humans in the novel and grotesquely describes all relevant aspects of humanity: life, death, warfare, crime, deceit and greed. Violence-Connected to the theme of Nazi Germany is the overall theme of violence throughout the novel. The Brotherhood of the Light uses violence, specifically smashing people's chests with hammers, and later murdering people. In the same interview, Sorokin is asked why he brings up violence so much in this novel. Sorokin replies that violence fascinates him, \\"Why can‚Äôt people do without violence? Why can‚Äôt they keep from killing? This is a mystery to me, and I try to talk about it in literary form.‚Äù Sorokin also mentions how violence is often justified by some overall goal, and how he plays with this idea in Bro, \\"There is an idea, a lofty goal, in Bro the killing takes place in the name of a lofty goal.\\" Literary significance Sorokin diverges away from traditional Russian literature with this novel. This is described as \\"betraying Russian prose.\\" Sorokin replies that, \\"As before, they think of it as something sacred. There is a kind of secret in literature and the literary process, to be sure. But literature is not a temple, and it should not be assigned the function of sacred texts. Russian writers shouldn‚Äôt be made into priests.‚Äù Bro is significant because it shows that Sorokin's urge to break away from traditional Russian literature goes along with his intent to mirror actual events in society with this novel. Sorokin states, \\"To my mind the entire Ice Trilogy is a discussion of the twentieth century. It‚Äôs a kind of monument to it. You can look at this as a metaphor, or as science fiction, or as some sort of conspiratorial novel.\\" Sorokin mirrors many themes of real events in this novel, such as alluding to the control of Nazi Germany and human obsession with violence. Development history In an interview, Sorokin states that he first began thinking about The Ice Trilogy while teaching Russian language and literature in Japan. After finishing the first novel, Ice, he realized that he could not simply move on to his next work. Instead he wanted to return to the theme of his disappointment with contemporary society, sensing that the story was not yet complete and so he began the prequel, Bro. Explanation of the novel's title Titled, Put' Bro, or Bro's Way, in Russian, the title takes the name of the protagonist after he has undergone his awakening. It reflects the significance of the discovery of his new identity as a part of the brotherhood and sisterhood of the Light, as well as his quest to unite the 23,000.

Pictured: the Swiss Alps, the location of many underground storage bunkers for gold. Banking secrecy, alternately known as financial privacy, banking discretion, or bank safety,Guex (2000), p. 240 is a conditional agreement between a bank and its clients that all foregoing activities remain secure, confidential, and private. Most often associated with banking in Switzerland, banking secrecy is prevalent in Luxembourg, Monaco, Hong Kong, Singapore, Ireland, Lebanon and the Cayman Islands, among other off-shore banking institutions. Otherwise known as bank‚Äìclient confidentiality or banker‚Äìclient privilege, the practice was started by Italian merchants during the 1600s near Northern Italy (a region that would become the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland).Guex (2000), p. 237 Geneva bankers established secrecy socially and through civil law in the French- speaking region during the 1700s. Swiss banking secrecy was first codified with the Banking Act of 1934, thus making it a crime to disclose client information to third parties without a client's consent. The law, coupled with a stable Swiss currency and international neutrality, prompted large capital flight to private Swiss accounts. During the 1940s, numbered bank accounts were introduced creating an enduring principle of bank secrecy that continues to be considered one of the main aspects of private banking globally. Advances in financial cryptography (via public-key cryptography) could make it possible to use anonymous electronic money and anonymous digital bearer certificates for financial privacy and anonymous Internet banking, given enabling institutions and secure computer systems. While some banking institutions voluntarily impose banking secrecy institutionally, others operate in regions where the practice is legally mandated and protected (e.g. off-shore financial centers). Almost all banking secrecy standards prohibit the disclosure of client information to third parties without consent or an accepted criminal complaint. Additional privacy is provided to select clients via numbered bank accounts or underground bank vaults.

Numbered bank accounts, used by Swiss banks and other offshore banks located in tax havens, have been accused by the international community of being a major instrument of the underground economy, facilitating tax evasion and money laundering. After Al Capone's 1931 condemnation for tax evasion, according to journalist Lucy Komisar: > mobster Meyer Lansky took money from New Orleans slot machines and shifted > it to accounts overseas.

F. Martin & Company of Nazareth, Pennsylvania. It is widely regarded amongst luthiers and guitarists alike as being the classic and even iconic American made acoustic guitar. History This guitar is a dreadnought design, a naval term adopted and used by many to describe its larger body dimensions, hence the \\"D\\" designation. When first created, the dreadnought guitar was seen as less favorable to the standard, smaller-sized guitars of its time. Sales finally started to take off in 1935, \\"when they were given a single illustration on page 12 in the company's catalog, opposite a Hawaiian model.\\" The ad read: :\\"This is the famous 'Dreadnaught' bass guitar, originated by Martin in 1917 and now modernized for the plectrum style of playing. The extra wide and very deep body produces a tone of great power and smoothness, especially fine for broadcasting or recording. Rosewood body, spruce top, ivoroid edges, re- enforced mahogany neck, ebony fingerboard and bridge, wide frets, polished lacquer finish. Dark top on special order at no extra charge.\\" Introduced by Martin in 1931, the D-28 is prized for its booming projection and high quality tone. The first batch went wholly to the Chicago Musical Instrument Company, although this \\"exclusive\\" deal didn't last for long. Originally built around the Martin D-14 Fret platform, early examples included exotic tone woods, such as Brazilian Rosewood, which is no longer available in large quantities due to deforestation and subsequent treaty controls. Original D28 guitars also used standard materials no longer found in current production models. For example, they had a distinct \\"herringbone\\" pattern that lined the top of the guitar. However, this touch was discontinued in 1946, as the German-made materials were no longer available post-World War II. Also the \\"diamonds and squares\\" fretboard inlays were reduced to plain dot styling around this time. D28s were so popular at one point during the 1950s, that customers were waiting two years or more for one. Current models Note - starting with the 2017 D-28's Martin has switched to forward shifted X-bracing, a revised neck pattern termed High Performance Taper with Modified Low Oval profile with 1-3/4‚Äù ebony fret board width at the bone nut, 2-1/8‚Äù at the 12th fret. The previous black pickguard is now faux tortoise shell and the former enclosed tuning machines are now open gear. Ageing toner is applied to the Sitka Spruce tops before application of the nitrocellulose lacquer finish. The modern D-28 standard series is made of several high quality tone woods, including solid Sitka Spruce tops, Indian rosewood back and sides, mahogany neck, ebony fret board, ebony bridge, and maple bridge plate. It uses the classic non scalloped X bracing pattern prior to 2017 pioneered by Martin, along with an ebony bridge and fret board. Much of the construction is still done by hand although in recent years Martin has adopted computer controlled CNC machines to fashion the guitar's neck, and employs automated buffing and polishing machines, while maintaining the overall quality of the finished product. As of 2020, a base model has a list price of $3,599 U.S. Martin dealers usually offer discounts off the list prices. Older models made in the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s can command far greater prices. Variations The D-28 has been made in several variations over the years, including: * HD-28: Has scalloped braces, said to give the guitar a more \\"open\\" sound than a D-28. Also features the herringbone (or \\"pre-war\\") top border and a zigzag, or \\"zipper\\" backstrip. * HD-28V: This variation resembles the original pre-war model and features both chrome butter-bean tuners and herringbone bindings around the aged-toned top. The X of its scalloped bracing pattern is shifted forward (toward the sound hole) by approximately one inch, making the lower bout top vibrate more freely/responsive, and resulting in a very potent and bass-rich guitar. * D28E: A very limited run version of the D-28 with special pickups placed at the end of the fretboard and near the bridge. While not generally well received, it is considered a collectors item * D12-28: A 12-string version, otherwise the same as its brother the D-28.

Shyam has meditated, studied and been dedicated to this tradition since his early childhood, when his father invited Swami Ramanand, a guru from Uttar Pradesh, to live in their home. Swami Ramanand initiated the young Shyam in meditation, and the family home became a meeting place for satsang (the company of true knowledge) for those who lived in the region. Ramanand taught the Vedas, the Bhagavad Gita, the Srimad Bhagavatam and other scriptures, as well as meditation. In 1973 Shyam moved to Kullu, Valley of Gods, Himachal Pradesh, India. Meditation and knowledge of the self are the essence of Shyam's teachings. He has meditated, studied and taught meditation throughout his life, and established organisations for the continuation of this work, such as the International Meditation Institute (IMI), which he founded in 1976 in Kullu; Shanti-Sneh Abhiyan, which he formed in 1986 in Kullu; and the Man- Friend Association, which he founded in the early 1960s in Chandigarh, India. In 1986, at the First International Yog Conference in New Delhi, Shyam was awarded the Yog Shiromani Award by the President of India, Giani Zail Singh, for his work in the field of meditation and self-realization and the 1974 Integrity Award presented by Geoff Stirling on behalf of Apache Communications in Gander, Newfoundland. Shyam has spoken by invitation to thousands of people throughout India and in Europe, North America and South America, at international conferences, organisations, universities and schools, as well as on television and radio. The published works of Shyam include original works in English and Hindi, as well as translations with commentaries of ancient Sanskrit texts, published by the International Meditation Institute. (See below for a list of titles.) Some of these books have been translated into French, German, Hebrew, Punjabi, Norwegian and other languages. He wrote every day, sometimes several times, culminating in thousands of writings based on his own practice and inner research. In addition to prose, Shyam had seven published volumes of poetry; he has written over 10,000 poems. His poetry speaks of the knowledge of the universal Self, meditation and the sense of love and devotion. It is written in classical meters, which are traditionally sung. Lauded twentieth- and twenty-first-century Hindi poets Mahadevi Varma and Gopaldas Neeraj, as well as scholars of Hindi literature, Laxmi Narayan and Ganpati Chandra Gupta, have written introductions to his published volumes of poetry. Academic theses have been written on his philosophy and his creative works (see selection listed below). The basis of Shyam's teachings is meditation. The core of his teachings is the vision of oneness, the knowledge of I, you, or self, which he says is \\"pure, free, forever, birthless and deathless.\\" This knowledge, he says, is unfolded through the practice of meditation, study and the application of that knowledge in a person's waking state. His mantra, \\"Amaram Hum Madhuram Hum\\", means, \\"I am eternal, I am blissful.\\" It encapsulates the essence of Shyam's philosophy and teachings.

Background The ≈åfuna Camp was opened on April 26, 1942 and was operated by a detachment of the Guard Unit of the Yokosuka Naval District. Whereas most other Japanese P.O.W. camps were run by the Imperial Japanese Army, ≈åfuna was run by the Navy. In violation of international agreements, including the Geneva Convention, it was never officially reported as a prisoner camp, and the International Red Cross was not allowed access. The Japanese position was that the ≈åfuna Camp was only a temporary holding facility for prisoners, who would be transferred elsewhere. It was commanded by Commander Yokura Sashizo, who later would be sentenced to 25 years of hard labor for war crimes. Description The ≈åfuna Camp consisted of three interconnected one-story buildings surrounding a large field, in turn surrounded by an eight-foot-high wooden fence. The area had formerly been an elementary school. The buildings were of unpainted wood roofed with tar paper, and had a long central corridor with thirty rooms to a side, each about six by nine feet (1.83 by 2.74 meters), a single electric light, bunk, bamboo mat, and door with a small window. One of the cells was a dispensary. The camp contained two latrines and one shower room, along with a barracks for the guards, kitchen, and rooms for the Japanese commandant, non- commissioned officers and orderly. Official US Army report by Dolder Rescue Team Policy Among the prisoners held at ≈åfuna were the surviving crews of the , and the , along with a number of American and British aviators. Prisoners were housed in individual cells, and were allowed to talk to no one, not even to themselves in their sleep. In good weather, they were allowed to sit outside their cells, looking straight forward, and the rule of silence was strictly enforced. Meals consisted of a little rice and soup. The prisoners were given no blankets, and the only clothing was the clothing that they had been captured in. The normal stay at ≈åfuna was limited to eight days, although some prisoners were held much longer. Some were held at ≈åfuna for several months. Three crew members of the remained at ≈åfuna for the duration of the war and were used to intercept Allied radio traffic. ≈åfuna had a reputation for intimidation and for torturing their inmates in an attempt to get military information, and was nicknamed the \\"Torture Farm\\" by its inmates. As the prisoners sent to ≈åfuna were primarily officers, who might have inside knowledge of Allied strategy, or others working in critical areas such as communications and submarines, it was the goal of the Japanese to extract as much information as possible in a short time. The names of the prisoners held at ≈åfuna were not divulged to the Red Cross, and the camp was so secret that even local inhabitants were not aware of its existence. As relayed to a submarine prisoner: \\"You have survived the sinking of a submarine. No one survives the sinking of a submarine. No one knows you're alive. We're going to ask you questions. This man and this man are going to shoot you if you don't answer the questions, and no one will know you were alive.\\" In some cases, the inmates were told by their captors that they were regarded as war criminals, since 90 percent of the crews of the merchant vessels sunk by American submarines were civilians, and that as war criminals, they would be given only half the rations of normal prisoners of war. The interrogations were repeated every two weeks, but the interrogators compared notes to see if there were any discrepancies. Refusing to answer questions, lying, disrespect to the interrogators, and a number of other infractions were punished by a beating with wooden clubs. Guards often beat prisoners or slapped them in the face for the slightest infraction or at times at random. Officers typically faced harsher treatment than enlisted ranks. Inmates also claimed that ≈åfuna guards were often sadistic, enjoying the beating and clubbing of inmates. Inmates claimed that their scarce food rations were due to their Japanese and Red Cross rations being sold on the black market outside of camp. The inmates were forced to exercise every day. An inmate recalls, \\"We were dying, on about 500 calories a day\\". In 1948, the camp's notorious medical orderly, Sueharu Kitamura, was tried for causing the death of one prisoner and contributing to the deaths of three others; originally sentenced to hang, he later had his sentence reduced to thirty years of hard labor.James Scott, The War Below (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2013), pp. 276-277; 286-289; 314. However, despite the physical and verbal abuse, of the estimated one thousand prisoners who passed through during the war, only six prisoners died while incarcerated at the ≈åfuna Camp. The remaining 126 American and nine British prisoners were liberated on 21 August 1945.

He received his B.A. degree in 1865 and his M.A. degree in 1868 from Wesleyan University. He received a Ph.D. in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering from Boston University in 1907. Railway signaling inventions Robinson began developing an automatic block signal system for railroads in 1867. His first system was installed on the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1870. He received multiple patents for railway signaling inventions: * 1870: automatic elect Robinson's invention of the closed track circuit, often referred to as \\"failsafe\\" due to its ability to reliably detect abnormalities such as broken wiring or a broken rail, was one of the key developments in railway safety, and paved the way for trustworthy railway signaling. The failsafe track circuit remains in widespread use. He established the Robinson Electric Railway Signal Company in 1873 and during the 1870s his signal systems were installed on railroads throughout the United States. He lived in Boston in the mid-1870s and supervised installation of his systems on the Boston and Lowell Railroad, the Boston and Providence Railroad, and other roads in the region. He organized the Union Electric Signal Company in 1878. This company, holding valuable patents on track circuit designs, was acquired by the newly formed Union Switch and Signal (US&S;) in 1881. Other inventions Following the sale of Union Electric Signal to US&S;, Robinson turned his attention to other fields, particularly mechanical inventions. His other significant inventions included: * the Robinson radial car truck * the first coaster brake used on bicycles * roller bearing skates, and * a repeating telephone.

It was near this location that a large piece of float copper, known as the Ontonagon Boulder, was found. The mine operated off and on from 1849 until its final closure in 1921. Most of the metal found there was low grade native copper from the Forest Lode. Quartz, epidote, calcite, prehnite, and pumpellyite are also found in the rock. 1771-1849 Prehistoric mining pits indicate that the area was mined long before Europeans ever set foot in North America. Near this area was the location of a large piece of float copper, also known as the Ontonagon Boulder. Originally discovered by missionaries, the boulder sparked the interest of British investors. In 1771, Alexander Henry the elder, an early British explorer, was sent to open a mine along the banks of the Ontonagon River where the boulder had been found. The venture ultimately proved unsuccessful after the adit caved in due to the fact that they were mining into a river bank. After this, the project was abandoned and the site remained empty for the next seventy years. 1849-1899 In 1849, Christopher Columbus Cushing opened a mine not far from the area where Henry had attempted to dig. The Cushin Mine ran for about a year before the Forest Mine took over in 1850. Eight years later, the company reorganized as the Victoria Mining Company. The company experienced several disasters during this time. The first stamp mill was destroyed in a fire and the second washed away in a flood. After 1855, the mine was operated sporadically for a number of years. During this period of time, estimates show that 200 to 250 tons of copper were mined from the Victoria. The company shipped the copper to Calumet, Michigan, where it was smelted. In 1881, The former mining captain of the Nonesuch Mine, Thomas Hooper, assessed the state of the Victoria Mine and after pumping the water from the mine, he found it to be in disrepair. Many of the tunnels and adits had collapsed and the support timbers were found rotted. He concluded that a large investment would be needed in order for the mine to run again. Because of this, it was not until the end of the nineteenth century that the mine finally reopened. 1899-1921 Beginning in 1899, the Victoria Copper Mining Company started running the mine and Captain Hooper was hired to run the operation. One of the first problems Hooper encountered was a lack of fuel. Wood was hard to come by at that time and coal was expensive, so Hooper began to look into other energy sources. Even as early as 1882, the possibility of hydropower was discussed. The Michigan Department of Mineral Statistics annual report in 1882 stated: \\"Among the important advantages which the property possesses is the water-power in the west branch of the Ontonagon river, about a mile south of the mine; forty feet of head can be used here‚Ä¶If it shall be decided to systematically work the mine, the water-power in the west branch will undoubtedly be utilized to operate the machinery‚Ä¶\\". In 1904, Charles Havelock Taylor, a Canadian inventor, visited the site in order to build a hydraulic air compressor that would harness the water in the Ontonagon River. Once running, the Taylor Air Compressor was able provided the Victoria Mine with an inexpensive power source which uniquely equipped the mine with the ability to extract the low grade ore. In fact, the Mines Register reported that the Victoria was \\"placed in a position to handle rock of lower average grade than perhaps any other mine in the Lake Superior district\\". During this time, the village near the mine site, Victoria, grew to eighty houses. All buildings in the town were owned by the mining company, including the school, general store, and houses. The inhabitants of the town were miners and their families. These miners were paid average wages of the time: $1 a day for a ten-hour day and later $2 for the same amount of time. Records from this time are hard to come by and so it is unknown exactly how much copper was mined during this time. The mine ran almost continuously for nearly twenty years, but as the 1920s approached, the price of copper started to decline. The cheap power provided by the Taylor Air Compressor allowed the Victoria Mine to remain open longer than most of its competitors. After World War I ended, though, copper prices fell by fifty percent to 13 cents per pound. When the price dropped to 11 cents a pound, the Victoria Mine closed for the final time. 1921-Present Day =Victoria Dam= After the mine closed in 1921, the Copper District Power Company purchased the lands with the intent of building a hydro-electric plant on the Ontonagon River. The new dam (a multiple-arch type, built between 1929-1931) created a five mile long artificial lake called the Victoria Flowage. Operated by the Upper Peninsula Power Company since 1947, the company now owns three dams upstream of the Victoria Dam in order to harness enough water to supply power for the area. Near the main dam, the Taylor Air Compressor, its canals, and the dam (Hooper Dam) built in 1902 to supply it now lay submerged. Though no longer in use, the Taylor Hydraulic Air Compressor may be fully operational. =Old Victoria= Following the closure of the mine, the village of Victoria fell into disrepair. During the 1970s, an attempt was made to preserve the historical aspects of the area. The Society for Restoration of Old Victoria began repairing a group of the old cabins where the miners lived. The site opened in 1976 and has been giving guided tours ever since. Currently, four cabins have been restored and furnished to suit the time period, including two boarding houses and a family home. It is now one of the Keweenaw Heritage Sites in the Keweenaw National Historical Park.

History  An aerial view of Mamutik (top left), Sulug (top right) and Manukan (bottom) resembles a smiling face. Before the Ice Age, the island formed part of the Crocker Range mass of sandstone and sedimentary rock on the mainland. However, about one million years ago, the melting ice brought about changes in the sea level and parts of the mainland were cut off by the sea to form the islands of Gaya Island, Sapi, Manukan, Mamutik and Sulug. Evidence of this can be seen from the exposed sandstone of the coastline forming the cliffs, caves, honeycombs and deep crevices. Jesselton Point Ferry Terminal in downtown Kota Kinabalu is the ferry terminal for those heading to the islands in Tunku Abdul Rahman Marine Park (Gaya Island, Sapi Island, Manukan Island, Mamutik Island and Sulug Island). This ferry terminal is also the departure point for patrons staying at either Manukan Island Resort or Gayana Resort. In 1974, the major part of Gaya and Sapi islands was gazetted as Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park, covering an area of . In 1979, the park was increased to with the inclusion of the three nearby islands of Manukan, Mamutik and Sulug islands.  Transportation  The main public transportation to the island is by speedboat from Kota Kinabalu to the island jetty for about 20 minutes. Speedboats leave from Kota Kinabalu Ferry terminal (Jesselton Point Ferry Terminal) and services run from 8.30am to 4.15pm.  Accommodation  Drone footage of Manukan Island Resort.

Along with fellow guard commander Xu Wen, he took over reins of the Hongnong state (which, in later times, would be known as Wu) by effectively putting Yang Wo under physical control. In 908, fearing that Yang Wo was about to seize power back and kill them, they assassinated him first. However, they then turned on each other, and Zhang was killed by Xu, who then took sole rein of Hongnong.  Background  It is not known when Zhang Hao was born, but it is known that he was from Cai Prefecture (Ëî°Â∑û, in modern Zhumadian, Henan). At one point, he served as a soldier under Qin Zongquan,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. who was at one point a Tang Dynasty- commissioned military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengguo Circuit (Â•âÂúã, headquartered at Cai Prefecture) but who later declared himself to be emperor of a new state.Old Book of Tang, vol. 200, part 2. Zhang, while serving under Qin, was known for his ferocity in battle, and he was later assigned to serve under Qin's general Sun Ru when Qin sent his brother Qin Zongheng () and Sun to try to capture Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in 887, which was then in a state of confusion after battles between Qin Yan and Bi Shiduo on one side and Yang Xingmi and L√º Yongzhi on the other for control of the circuit. (Sun soon killed Qin Zongheng and took over his army.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. During a battle where Yang's army prevailed over Sun's, Zhang surrendered to Yang.The wording of the traditional account implied, but did not state, that this was after Sun's final defeat and death at Yang's hands in 892, but that was quite impossible as Cai Chou's turning against Yang occurred before that time. It thus appeared that Zhang must have surrendered to Yang significantly earlier.  Service under Yang Xingmi  Yang Xingmi treated Zhang Hao well, and at one point he assigned him to be part of his army protecting Yang's ancestral home Lu Prefecture (Âª¨Â∑û, in modern Hefei, Anhui). In 889, however, when Yang was away attacking Xuan Prefecture (ÂÆ£Â∑û, in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), Sun attacked Lu Prefecture, and Cai Chou () the prefect of Lu Prefecture, whom Yang had left in charge of Lu Prefecture, surrendered. Sun allowed Cai to retain Lu Prefecture,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. and Zhang continued to serve under Cai. After Yang finally defeated and killed Sun in 892, Cai did not resubmit to Yang. Rather, he allied with Ni Zhang () the prefect of Shu Prefecture (ËàíÂ∑û, in modern Anqing, Anhui) to jointly resist Yang. Yang sent his general Li Shenfu to put Lu Prefecture under siege and later joined the siege himself in early 893. During the siege, Zhang climbed over the city walls and surrendered to Yang again. Yang initially assigned him to serve under Yuan Zhen () the commander of Yinqiang Corps (). Yuan, believing Zhang has shown himself to be unreliable, asked Yang for permission to executed Zhang. Yang did not want to see that happen, and believing that Yuan would not tolerate Zhang, instead assigned Zhang to his own guard corps. Zhang Hao's activities over the next 12 years were not recorded in history, but by 905, by which time Yang Xingmi had come to control the territory between Huai River and Lake Tai and carried the Tang-bestowed title of Prince of Wu, Zhang was serving as the commander of the right guard corps (with another officer of Yang's, Xu Wen, serving as the commander of the left guard corps). In 905, when Yang grew extremely ill, Yang's oldest son Yang Wo, who was not well-respected by his officers, was serving as the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Xuan Prefecture. Yang Xingmi instructed his secretary Zhou Yin () to summon Yang Wo, preparing to transfer authorities to him; Zhou opposed this, arguing that Yang Wo was frivolous and an alcoholic, instead suggesting that Yang Xingmi entrust his domain to Liu Wei (), who was then serving as the prefect of Lu Prefecture, instead. Yang Xingmi was shocked by this proposal, and when Xu and Zhang heard of it, they opposed as well on the grounds that Yang Xingmi built his domain and should transfer it to a son; Yang Xingmi agreed. (Subsequently, when Xu and Yan Keqiu realized that Zhou had not sent the order to summon Yang Wo, they took the order and sent it; Yang Wo then returned to Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture (). Yang Xingmi transferred his authorities to Yang Wo, and then died. Yang Wo succeeded him and used the lesser title (bestowed by Emperor Zhaozong's emissary Li Yan) the Prince of Hongnong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265.  Service under Yang Wo  After Yang Wo annexed Zhennan Circuit (ÈéÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) in 906, he became increasingly arrogant and intolerant. He executed Zhou Yin, which caused fear to permeate among his staff members. Despite being still in the mourning period for Yang Xingmi, he spent his time, day and night, in feast and games. When Zhang Hao and Xu Wen tried to tearfully dissuade him from such behavior, he angrily stated to them, \\"If you believe that I am not capable enough, why do you not kill me and take over yourselves?\\" This caused them to be fearful as well. They thus planned to act against Yang Wo. They first sent three officers who commanded Yang Wo's personal army (which he brought back from Xuan Prefecture), Zhu Siqing (), Fan Sicong (), and Chen Fan () to join under the general Qin Pei () in Qin's operations to pacify Zhennan, and then sent an officer, Chen You () to execute them at Qin's camp under false charges of treason. When Yang Wo heard of this, he prepared to kill Zhang and Xu, but before he could act, they acted first. In spring 907, they took 200 guards under their command into the mansion, claiming to be carrying out bingjian (ÂÖµË´´, i.e., \\"correction by force\\"). They executed a group of Yang Wo's close associates and then, while not physically acting against Yang Wo himself, effectively took control of the headquarters. If other officers disagreed with them, they found reasons to execute those officers.  Assassination of Yang Wo and death  Later in 907, the powerful warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) forced Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai to yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang with Zhu as its Emperor Taizu. Yang Wo, along with Li Keyong the Prince of Jin, Li Maozhen the Prince of Qi, and Wang Jian the Prince of Shu, did not recognize the new Later Liang emperor as emperor, and continued to use the Tang era name of Tianyou. Without a Tang emperor, however, he was in effect the ruler of a new state of Hongnong. However, Zhang Hao and Xu Wen remained in effective control of the headquarters, and Yang Wo was hoping to, but unable to, eliminate them. They considered their own positions precarious, however, and they resolved to kill Yang Wo, divide the domain between themselves, and then submit to Later Liang. On June 9, 908, Zhang sent his subordinate Ji Xiang () into Yang Wo's mansion with soldiers under Zhang's command and killed him in his bedroom. (The reason why only Zhang's soldiers were used was that Xu pointed out that if they mixed soldiers, the soldiers may not cooperate with each other, and Zhang did not want to let Xu's soldiers conduct the assassination.) Zhang and Xu subsequently declared that Yang Wo had died of a sudden illness. When Zhang postured at taking over command of the domain, however, Yan Keqiu spoke up against it and subsequently produced a document, which he claimed to be from Yang Wo's mother Lady Dowager Shi, pleading for allegiance of the officers behind her younger son Yang Longyan. Zhang, rebuffed in his attempt to directly take over, acquiesced and allowed Yang Longyan to take the throne as the new Prince of Hongnong. Subsequently, Zhang tried to send Xu out of the headquarters to be the governor of Zhexi Circuit (ÊµôË•ø, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), but Yan persuaded Xu and Li Chengsi () the deputy military governor of Huainan that Zhang was intending to eliminate them and starting by sending Xu out of the capital; Xu thereafter found excuses to stay at Yang Prefecture. After Zhang then failed in an assassination attempt against Yan, Yan and Xu plotted to overthrow him. Xu subsequently got the officer Zhong Taizhang () to join the plot. On the night of June 18, Zhong took his soldiers and entered headquarters, killing Zhang and his close associates. Xu then blamed the assassination of Yang Wo on Zhang alone, and effectively took over as Yang Longyan's regent.

Primarily a building contractor, although he also ventured into many other businesses, he built a good number of Johor's heritage buildings, including the original Istana Besar, the royal palace of the Sultan of Johor. Jalan Wong Ah Fook, one of the busiest streets in downtown Johor Bahru, is named after him.  Early life  Born in Yanjingcun, a Chinese village in Taishan county, Guangdong province, Wong Ah Fook hired himself out as a farmer's boy when his family fell on hard times. It is likely that he never attended school but he did learn to read and write and also to use the abacus. In 1854, then age 17, Wong emigrated to Singapore as the result of civil unrest in his hometown that eventually erupted into the Punti‚ÄìHakka Clan Wars (1855‚Äì1867). Like many others, he had no money to pay his passage and indentured himself to a carpenter as he did not want to travel all the way, only to become an agricultural laborer all over again. After working for a year at nominal wages, Wong was free but he continued to work with his employer and was given a share of the business after a few years.  The beginnings of success  The Singapore economy was growing and there was a great demand for houses, shops, and warehouses. Seeing the opportunities, Wong became a building contractor as it was only a short step from carpentry work. Obtaining the patronage of Hoo Ah Kay (better known as Whampoa), a fellow Cantonese, he was able to secure a major contract in 1863 to build two godowns for Paterson & Simons (acting as the business agent for the Temenggungs of Johor in Singapore), some ten years after his arrival in Singapore. It was Hoo who introduced Wong to his wide circle of friends, including Maharaja Abu Bakar who subsequently became the Sultan of Johor. Hoo was a successful businessman who had built up a prosperous ships' chandlering business and was the supplier and contractor to Her Majesty's navy. In the year of 1904, Sultan Abu Bakar honoured him with SMJ in recognition of his services to the Johor.  Later life  Beginning with the construction of the Istana Besar in 1865 that made him become the main government contractor, Wong Ah Fook was drawn into the politics of Johor's gambier and pepper economy at about this time when he was asked by the Johor government to penetrate the Kongkek (the Gambier and Pepper Society of Singapore) which was then monopolizing the industry. This introduced him into revenue farming after he was granted a lease on the tax on all the two crops produced in Johor and its territories, and it was revenue farming that brought him great wealth. Wong also helped with the construction the Istana Tyersall in 1890 for the Sultan's residence in Singapore. In 1892, Wong was granted a 99-year lease for 10 lots of land by the Sultan on the east bank of Sungai Segget as a reward for his services. Named Kampung Wong Ah Fook, the main road in the kampung was named Jalan Wong Ah Fook, while three other smaller roads, namely Jalan Siu Nam, Jalan Siu Koon, and Jalan Siu Chin, were named after Wong's three eldest sons. The area became a prominent Cantonese-dominant area and is now the city centre of Johor Bahru, with all the four roads still existing today. However, it was the Kwong Yik Bank that was to become Wong Ah Fook's most ambitious undertaking and also his proudest achievement. Yet, the venture was to lead to his greatest disaster and brought him close to grief. On 26 December 1914, a general meeting of Chinese Community of Johor Bahru was held for the elections of the officials and discussing the particulars of Chinese General Mandarin School of Johor, Khuan Jiew School, Wong Ah Fook was elected as the President of the Committee.The Straits Times, 8 January 1915, Page 5: Khuan Jiew School, Johore Bahru He also one of the original founders of the Kwong Wai Siew Chinese Hospital (now Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital; ) in Singapore, which according to The Straits Times, \\"a hospital providing indigenous treatment to the Chinese\\".

However, in August 1918, he contracted influenza which developed into pneumonia, to which he succumbed.

Personal Russell was born on 7 January 1944 in the Queensland city of Maryborough. After leaving school, he served an apprenticeship as a boilermaker. He played professional rugby league in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, and while there, he sustained a spinal cord injury in a car crash. Russell spent 16 days in hospital in Papua New Guinea. He was then flown to Brisbane, where he underwent rehabilitation for three months, and was inspired to take up sport by athletes training at the spinal injury unit. He has been married to Paralympic athlete and powerlifter Julie Russell since 1979. The pair met in 1977 for the first time when Eric came to Adelaide for the first National Basketball Titles. Eric and Julie were then introduced officially in 1978 at the Regional Games in Broken Hill. He has been a member of Rotary International since 1985, first joining the Rotary Club of Adelaide, South Australia, and then moving to Adelaide Parks, where he later served as president in 1989. He was the 2011‚Äì12 District Governor of District 9500, which covers parts of the Northern Territory (including Alice Springs) and South Australia (including Adelaide). Competitive career Eric Russell with Ludwig Guttman at the 1976 Paralympic Toronto Paralympics Russell's career began in 1972 when he participated in a shot put trial for the National Games that were to be competed in Sydney later that year. He was selected for the Games where he finished with two bronze and one silver medal. He represented Australia at the 1974 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games in Dunedin, New Zealand. At the 1976 Toronto Games, he won three gold medals in the Men's Discus 3, Men's Pentathlon 3 and Men's Shot Put 3 events and a silver medal in the Men's Javelin 3 event; he was also part of the Australia men's national wheelchair basketball team at the games. Despite setting a world record in the discus, he rejected the gold medal for that event because of politics being injected into the Games; several national teams had boycotted the competition due to the presence of the South African Paralympic team during the apartheid era, at a time when many sports teams from that country were banned from international competition. Russell said: \\"We have enough of a common bond in our disabilities without governments bringing politics into it\\". Following his protest, Russell was ordered to attend a meeting with Kevin Betts and Ludwig Guttmann where he left the meeting in frustration as a result of his issue with the politics associated with the Games. A press conference was then held the next morning where Russell was awarded a medal for the excellence of his protest which he later returned to the lawn bowler from whom it was taken. At the 1980 Arnhem Games, he won a gold medal in the Men's Shot Put 3 event and two bronze medals in the Men's Discus 3 and Men's Pentathlon 3 events. At the 1992 Barcelona Games, he came seventh in the Men's Javelin THW6 event. Going into the 1992 Games, he had won 26 gold medals at 16 events. Sport administration Russell has served in several positions in disabled athletics including as a coach, sport administrator, and sport event director. He was the International Chairman of Athletics at the International Paralympic Committee from 1978 to 1988. After realising that he had achieved all of his initial goals, Russell resigned from his position as Chairman of Athletics in 1988. He also serves as an international Paralympic classifier in athletics. Russell was the inaugural Representative for the South-Pacific Region on the International Paralympic Committee. He resigned from this role in 1993 because of the politics within the sport. Recognition Russell became a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1981 for service to \\"handicapped sport\\". In that year, he received an Advance Australia Award. In 2007, he was made a life member of the Wheelchair Sports Association of South Australia. The Eric Russell Male Athlete of the Meet Award, issued by the Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association, is named in Russell's honour; he was the first coordinator and later a state administrator of the organisation.

He is also an author and an advisor to political figures of both political parties, bringing his skills to focus on biblical justice from an evangelical perspective. He serves as Executive Director of FEED 3 Inc. and Strategic Justice Initiatives Inc. Early life Skinner was born in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1957 and was raised in a traditional Southern Baptist family. As a pre-teen, Skinner was greatly impacted by the civil rights movement and assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., which took place in his hometown. Spending weekends and summers in his ancestral state of Mississippi also left a deep impression for justice and reconciliation upon Skinner. Skinner‚Äôs family moved from Memphis to Spring, Texas, in 1970. He attended and graduated from Spring High School in 1975. As a young man, he was active in student government, local political campaigns and chosen by the local state representative to represent his high school in Austin, Texas, for a statewide student government venue. It was during this period that Skinner also studied the work of Dr. E.V. Hill of Los Angeles and his impact on crime in the infamous Watts area. Education Skinner attended Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas, where he received a B.A. in Bible and political science (1975‚Äì1979). He was elected to student senate and served as the class president of the university. He also served as a liaison to carry the student body vote for state representatives, state senate, congressional and U.S. Senate campaigns. He worked as a social outreach worker in charge of juvenile offenders for the Brown County Juvenile Probation Department. He then attended New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary (1979‚Äì81), where he studied for a master's degree in education before transferring to Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Ft. Worth, Texas, where he received a Master of Divinity (1981‚Äì84). He also graduated from the Tarrant County Sheriff‚Äôs Department Reserve Academy and served for two years with the Richland Hills Police Department as a reserve officer. Notable expedition From 1975 to 1984, Skinner spent time during the summer months as a mountaineer in Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. In 1983, he traveled to Mt. Ararat in Turkey with American astronaut James Irwin in search of Noah‚Äôs Ark. Irwin served as Lunar Module pilot for Apollo 15, the fourth human lunar landing, and was the eighth person to walk on the Moon. Skinner and Irwin maintained a close friendship until Irwin‚Äôs death in 1991. Career in child advocacy and criminal justice After a brief period of serving local churches, Skinner moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1989 and began working in the criminal justice community. He worked in conjunction with 12 local law enforcement agencies concerned about the increase in homicides in the African-American community among juveniles. The agencies formed a task force that focused on the increase of violence among black male juveniles, child trafficking and ritualistic crimes. Skinner worked with nationally known crime trend expert, Dr. Jack Enter of Georgia, a consultant to federal law enforcement agencies and Scotland Yard. Skinner adapted research and analysis into the task force study and began developing a Five-Phase Model for Community Transformation. Skinner has lectured at major universities and conferences including as the National Academy of Forensics. He has also served as a consultant to the Department of Treasury (ATF and Customs), Naval and Air Force Intelligence, and numerous state and local law enforcement agencies involving child trafficking, gang violence, drug trafficking, and ritualistic crimes. National Conference on Crimes Against Children In 1992, Skinner began working with nationally known experts in child trafficking, sexual trafficking of children, drug cartels, gang violence, and ritualistic crimes. He served as the director of the National Conference on Crimes Against Children in Washington, D.C. in 1993 and 1994. The conference brought together the leading prosecutors, investigators, judges, and university researchers to coordinate an aggressive national strategy to combat crimes against children. Notable leaders such as Attorney General Ed Meese, U.S. Customs Child Exploitation Director John Sullivan, and U.S. Justice Department officials of the Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton administrations were involved, in addition to over 300 notable leaders in the criminal justice community for child advocacy. Major law firms from both the Democratic and Republican parties were involved in the united effort, for the first time working together to advocate for children. Marilyn Van Derbur, former Miss America and Outstanding Woman Speaker of America also served as a keynote speaker. During the September 1993 conference on Crimes Against Children, the 300 leaders present worked toward the passage of the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act as well as meeting with key members of the United States Congress over a three-day period. Congress passed the bill four months later, which mandated that each state create a specific program to register sex offenders. Career in Civil Rights In 1994, Skinner began working on child advocacy projects in California and Mississippi, resulting in an extensive research project in the state of Mississippi. Skinner wrote two books documenting his research surrounding the cultural, sociological and spiritual causes of violence in Mississippi with a specific focus on the civil rights era. That same year, Skinner began working with the Racial Reconciliation department of the national men‚Äôs movement called Promise Keepers. Skinner began serving in Mississippi in 1996, traveling over 100,000 miles over the next three years working on civil rights cases that remained unprosecuted from the Civil Rights era of the 1950s and 1960s. As a part of the collaborative effort of multiple statewide prayer and mobilization groups, Skinner introduced the Five Phase Transformation Model and the Four R‚Äôs of Community Transformation. Noted organizations such as Mission Mississippi, Mississippi Prayer Network, and Women‚Äôs Aglow worked with Skinner so that by the year 2000 more than 12 men were indicted and imprisoned for infamous civil rights cases. Skinner became a regularly invited speaker at the National Juneteenth Celebration in Washington, D.C. He also served with noted civil rights leaders Dr. Mark Pollard and Dr. Ron Meyers and led advocacy groups for the federal lawsuit against the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) by black farmers. During the 1997 period of African-American church burnings in the Deep South, Skinner served with the leaders of five major non-profit groups to disburse more than $1 million in funds to rebuild the church ruins. Among the groups Skinner collaborated with were World Vision, World Relief, Promise Keepers, and the National Criminal Justice Task Force. Career in Mexican Politics Skinner began working with political consultant Dr. Juan Hernandez in 2000; a relationship that continued, spanning over a decade. Skinner worked with Dr. Hernandez on the Mexican Presidential Campaign of Vicente Fox and later as a consultant for Mexican-American relations on Immigration Reform. The relationship has continued through various Presidential campaigns, local mayoral races in Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth as well as with the Hispanic Republicans of Texas state legislative races. Community Transformation Skinner created the Five Phase Transformation Model (Copyrighted 1994) which consists of: 1. Research analysis with report card, 2. Development of Strategic Partnerships 3. Casting New Vision 4. Community wake-up call rallies, 5. Community mobilization. Skinner also coined the Five R‚Äôs of Community Transformation: Repentance, Reconciliation, Restoration, Revival and Reformation. In 2002, Skinner became a consultant to Shelby County Mental Health, aiding them in the response to a suicide crisis among high school students in the city of Harlan, Iowa. He was chosen as a delegate to the state Republican Party convention, supporting a pro-life physician for the nomination to Congress (the nominee was ultimately defeated by Rep. Stephen King), and was one of five hundred Iowans to choose their next congressman. Skinner implemented his transformation model in the region where widespread spiritual awakening occurred, which positively impacted the drug and occult community.Kotok, C. David, Omaha World-Herald, \\"Iowa Convention Proves All Politics is Personal,\\" July 1, 2002. Skinner moved to Dallas, Texas in 2003, where he began working with Hillcrest Church. During that time, he began the process of research and analysis. His research eventually resulted in the publication of Why God Created Dallas in 2008. After discovering the historical injustice that occurred between the 1940s and the 1970s against African-Americans, Hispanics and poor whites, Skinner began working in West Dallas in 2003. That same year, Skinner began implementing the Transformation West Dallas model. In 2004, Skinner joined the Global Day of Prayer 90 Days of Blessing He also began a series of lectures on the history of West Dallas and its key to redeeming Dallas from systemic high crime and poverty. A regular participant at Beckett Publishing roundtable discussions, Skinner began a concerted effort to bring West Dallas leaders together with business leaders to discuss both the history of West Dallas and its injustices. A partnership developed in 2005 with JPI, one of the nation‚Äôs largest luxury apartment condo builders. The JPI corporation lent its technical assistants to Skinner in order to develop a database to track crime, sex offenders, poverty and slum properties. The resulting research allowed Strategic Justice Initiatives Inc. (SJI) and Builders of Hope Inc. to facilitate a $500,000 donation to purchase slum properties in West Dallas, where Builders of Hope CDC proceeded to build quality, affordable housing. SJI conducted a study measuring the accomplishments of Builders of Hope CDC and the actual impact on the community of West Dallas. The findings were presented to Southern Methodist University‚Äôs Conference sponsored by Faith and Philanthropy that year. The study was also presented to the Foundation for Community Empowerment as a grant proposal. SJI facilitated a meeting at JPI with more than 30 non-profit leaders that began a more concentrated focus on economic transformation. The partnership between Skinner and SJI continued over the next 3 years with a collaborative effort that would include up to 70 community leaders. Skinner helped facilitate more than $10 million that was funneled into the region largely to buy out slum properties. Skinner continues to live in the West Dallas community working for justice in housing, education, and improved living conditions. He was tasked by the U.S. Attorney of North Texas, Sarah R. Salda√±a, and U.S. Marshal Randy Ely to represent the community of West Dallas when properties were seized from a notorious street gang and turned over to the Dallas Habitat for Humanity. Skinner spoked alongside the U.S. Attorney. The Gator Boyz, which was made up of members of both the Bloods and Crips, used drug proceeds to purchase houses in West Dallas. This gang not only dealt drugs from these properties, but further terrorized the neighborhood by walking an alligator on a leash down the street. Thanks to the efforts of the Dallas Police Department's Gang Unit and ATF, approximately 304 grams of crack cocaine, 440 grams of marijuana and dozens of firearms were seized. In addition, approximately 20 gang members were convicted, including the gang's leaders, brothers Patrick and Tyrone Weatherall. The Weatherall's are now serving 20 and 30-year federal prison sentences. Leadership of Greater Dallas Justice Revival Skinner received Mayor of Dallas Tom Leppert‚Äôs blessing in the fall of 2008 to begin planning for an urban summit. The summit would bring the West Dallas transformation model to South Dallas‚Äô impoverished areas. The transformation process involved leaders from nearly every denomination and major non-profit in Dallas. Don Williams, noted developer and chairman of Trammel Crow, had formed the Foundation for Community Empowerment to eradicate poverty and crime in Dallas. Williams assisted in sponsoring the event. Skinner was chosen by Mayor Leppert to represent him in the movement, which grew to 300 city leaders, resulting in the launch of the Greater Dallas Justice Revival (GDJR). The GDJR was held in November 2009 in Dallas Market Hall Speakers at the event included noted, national leaders such as conservative Hispanic Republican Sam Rodriquez, Mayor Tom Leppert and noted Christian artists Jaci Velasqez, Salvador, Fred Hammond, and Israel Houghton and New Breed. In the fall of 2009, the city leaders asked that Skinner lead the Greater Dallas Justice Revival movement. GDJR had agreed to focus on improving 25 inner city schools as well as the placement of 700 additional units of permanent supportive housing for homeless by 2014. By the end of 2011, these goals had not only been met but had been exceeded with 1,800 units of permanent supportive housing provided, and 35 school-church partnerships. Upon the accomplishment of its goals, the Greater Dallas Justice-Revival became two separate movements. The school church partnership evolved into the nonprofit, FEED 3 while the work to end homelessness became Homes for Our Neighbors. Leadership with Youth In March 2009, SJI partnered with the Heart of a Champion program to implement a program in local schools that were suffering from poor test scores and discipline challenges. Working with individual Dallas City Council members, Skinner has successfully brought churches, non-profit organizations and economic resources to suffering areas. In February 2010, in partnership with Heart of a Champion and Xperience, a professional athletic outreach organization, more than 40 inner city schools heard pro NFL and NBA athletes speak on character. In 2010 and 2011, through GDJR, 16 collegiate coaches from across the nation conducted football camps for more than 150 inner city youth in the Jubilee Community of South Dallas. In the winter of 2010, more than $1.3 million worth of toys were distributed by SJI to 160 non-profit organizations in the Greater Dallas Area to be distributed to needy children. Skinner was the keynote speaker to the 30th Congressional Youth Summit on Hunger in the summer of 2011. Leadership on Hunger - FEED 3 Skinner became the Dallas Mayor, Tom Leppert‚Äôs representative for the Texas Hunger Initiative in 2009. The Texas Hunger Initiative (THI) is a capacity-building and collaborative project that seeks to develop and implement strategies to end hunger through policy, education, community organizing, and community development. The Greater Dallas Justice Revival partnered with Grammy Award-winning Casting Crowns, TobyMac, and Tenth Avenue North in 2010 for a concert in Grand Prairie, Texas with over 7,000 people attending. The event was focused on hunger and relief. In 2011, FEED 3 was launched. FEED 3 is a pro-business approach to hunger and poverty and was created by three local businessmen. In a partnership with local media companies, more than 1 million people have seen advertisements regarding hunger and homelessness initiated by FEED 3 and Homes for Our Neighbors. In November 2011, FEED 3 founded and co-sponsored the No Kid Hungry North Texas Hunger Summit, hosted by Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and co-sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture, Texas Department of Agriculture, Texas Hunger Initiative, Texas No Hungry Kid Campaign, North Texas Food Bank, Citysquare, and featuring Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings. The summit launched the Dallas Food Planning Association with the purpose of empowering Dallas County residents to gain equal access to healthy food. Today, the summit is called the Dallas Hunger Summit. The Dallas Food Planning Association became the Dallas Coalition for Hunger Solutions. FEED 3 Executive Director Randy H. Skinner represents the Mayor of Dallas office for both initiatives. In its fourth year (2015), the Dallas Hunger Summit and Coalition has involved over 100 organizations whose mission is to ensure that all of Dallas County residents are empowered to gain equal access to healthy food. In 2012, FEED 3 partnered with non-profit Strategic Justice Initiatives to help feed children in the inner city with summer meals. Through the summer of 2015 over 500,000 meals have been served to inner city kids representing 34 sites. FEED 3 provided support services to the feeding sites, with three hot meals and two cold meals served throughout the week. In 2014, FEED 3 partnered with the nonprofit Daily Bread Ministries Inc. in San Antonio, Texas, in a three- year project working with its 140 feeding sites in the poorest areas of San Antonio. FEED 3 also began working with the San Antonio Baptist Association three hundred churches on overall strategy for hunger, poverty eradication, and emergency relief. FEED 3 continues to work throughout the state of Texas with city leaders from Austin, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Tyler, and the greater DFW community to bring self sustainable sites to end hunger and malnutrition. Leadership on Ethical Reform for the City of Dallas Skinner was chosen by then Mayor Tom Leppert in 2008 to become chairman of the City of Dallas Ethics Advisory Commission. Mayor Leppert worked closely with Chairman Skinner to bring strong ethical reform to the city of Dallas. Some of the items passed by the advisory commission included the requirement that lobbyists register with the city of Dallas, a limit to the amount of campaign contributions that came from developers, the disclosure of gifts to council members over $50, and two city council members were now required to ‚Äúsecond‚Äù major zoning cases certifying they had reviewed the details of the case before the matter could be voted on. Mayor Leppert resigned as Dallas Mayor in 2011 in order to run for the Republican nomination of the U.S. Senate. Skinner continued to work with Mayor Pro Tem Dwayne Caraway http://www.ci.dallas.tx.us/cso/pdf/board-chairs.pdf and the city council to prevent a weakening of the campaign contribution guidelines implemented under Mayor Leppert. The chairman worked closely with the Mayor and council members to reverse a vote by the council that weakened campaign contribution laws. In the fall of 2011, newly elected Mayor Mike Rawlings asked Skinner to remain as chairman of the City of Dallas Ethics Commission and work with Dallas City Councilman Jerry Allen for a stronger culture of ethics within the city government Skinner has been supported in his work to strengthen ethics in city government by the Dallas Morning News editorial board. As a result of Skinner and Councilman Jerry Allen's leadership, an Ethics and Diversity Office was created to address ethics issues for city employees. In May 2014, an ethics officer was hired by the City of Dallas to work closely with the City Manager on ethical education and reform. Since that time, the Ethics Office has completed training for over 12,000 city employees using a two-hour training designed by nationally recognized Ethics Consultant Firm, Navigant. Skinner began anew in 2013 working with Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings to push for tighter ethical reform that included putting guidelines over the Mayor and City Councils office accounts, proper protocol on town hall meetings, guidelines on political activities for employees, and allowing the EAC (Ethics Advisory Commission) to begin working on the City of Dallas Election (Chapter 15A) guidelines for office holders and candidates. As a result of Skinner‚Äôs work with Councilman Jerry Allen, and the City of Dallas Ethics Office, the City of Dallas was nominated for the Greater Dallas Business Ethics Award. In 2015, Mayor Mike Rawlings tapped Skinner to push through stronger ethical reforms for the City of Dallas. Rawlings highlighted his stance on stronger ethics as the keynote speaker of the Greater Dallas Business Ethics Award ceremony.http://gdbea.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/02/2015_Keynote_Mike_Rawlings-FINAL.pdf Leadership on Homelessness The Greater Dallas Justice Revival became the official representative of the faith community on behalf of the Dallas Housing Authority and the Metro Dallas Homeless Alliance in 2010. That same year they developed a program called Homes for Our Neighbors, which partnered local churches with formerly homeless. By the end of 2011, nearly 2000 formerly homeless people will have been moved into permanent supportive housing with a 97 percent success rate. Skinner helped to negotiate a compromise with local community leaders who opposed the action of the formerly homeless moving into the communities of Oak Cliff and East Dallas. Skinner worked with the West Dallas/Oak Cliff Chamber of Commerce and Cliff Temple Baptist Church in Oak Cliff to resolve the challenges and a new non-profit was developed in partnership with the Dallas Housing Authority to provide jobs and community partnerships. In East Dallas, Skinner worked with City Councilman Jerry Allen of Lake Highlands and the Episcopal Diocese to help improve community relations for PSH residents in that community. Leadership in United States Global Leadership Coalition In 2015, Randy Skinner was asked to become part of the Texas delegation of noted leaders from Texas in the political, academic, business, and faith community to represent Texas as a member of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC). Led by the Honorable Gen. Colin Powell as Chairman, the coalition is a broad-based influential network of 400 businesses and NGOs; national security and foreign policy experts; and business, faith-based, academic and community leaders in all 50 states who support a smart power approach of elevating diplomacy and development alongside defense in order to build a better, safer world. Noted leaders such as Former Sec. of State Condoleezza Rice, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL.), Sen. Bill Bradley (D-NJ), Gov. Bill Richardson (D-NM), Sec. of State James Baker III, are involved as are organizations such as Catholic Relief and World Vision. Family Skinner currently resides in the inner city with his wife and family.

After moving from the UK to Australia, Henderson headed the new Traffic Accident Research Unit in the Department of Motor Transport in New South Wales. He wrote an early book on safety in motor racing and was involved in the design of a Pininfarina racing car built with the intent of increasing safety. Biography Henderson was born in 1937 in Woking, UK and graduated from Cambridge and St Thomas' Hospital. Henderson's career in safety began with his work in aviation research with the Royal Air Force. In 1968 he released a seminal book, Safety in Motor Racing. Henderson's book was influenced by his race medical experience and his accumulation of racing statistics. In 1969, Henderson was part of a team of experts that worked with Pininfarina and Automobil Revue to design a safe racing car known as the Sigma Grand Prix. Tony Davis of Drive.com.au said that the Sigma \\"was almost certainly the first racing car to take safety seriously.\\" By 1970, he had moved to Australia and became head of the newly formed Traffic Accident Research Unit of the Department of Motor Transport of the NSW government. He became interested in the application of compulsory seat belt laws. He contrasted the acceptance of such laws by Australian citizens with the resistance encountered to such laws in the U.S. and Europe. Henderson pointed out that seat belt use sometimes created a paradox: a driver using a seat belt might indicate that he or she was not a confident driver, while a passenger might offend a driver by putting on a seatbelt. While at the research unit during the 1970s he led a modern scientific approach to (road) motor vehicle safety, with sections of the unit covering human factors, statistical data analysis, engineering research, and traffic engineering. He was instrumental in introducing enforced fitment and use of seatbelts in Australia, improvements in child restraints and motorcycle helmets, introduction of helmets for bicycle riders, and steps which helped change the attitudes of the public to drink driving, so that there was a reduction, particularly in NSW, in trauma and death, and which began a continuous reduction which continued for decades in NSW. In the mid-1990s, Henderson authored a large study of child restraint system performance in actual car crashes. He also wrote a 1995 review of head injury prevention with bicycle helmets. His later career moved back toward an emphasis on safety in motor racing, so that in 2004 he was awarded Life Membership of the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport. In 2007 he became the inaugural Chairman of the newly formed Australian Institute for Motor Sport Safety,Board of Directors. Australian Institute for Motor Sport Safety.

He is a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine (AAAM), and a member of the Australian Trauma Society and the Society of Automotive Engineers. Even though there have been changes in the way it is administered, the essentials of the approach to road vehicle safety initiated by Henderson are now incorporated in the Centre for Road Safety of the Roads and Maritime Services of the NSW Government, and which includes an expansion of the testing laboratory of the Engineering Research Section originally at Rosebery, New South Wales, now in Huntingwood (now called Crashlab) which conducts full-scale vehicle crash testing, and testing of helmets, adult and child and baby restraints, and safety work harnesses.

In soccer, she was a goalkeeper who played for the Matildas and played in the W-League for Melbourne Victory and Melbourne City. In 2016, she stopped playing soccer to play Australian rules football, and was one of two initial marquee recruits for Carlton in the inaugural AFL Women's league. She won the club's best and fairest award in her first season as well as being named All-Australian. In 2018 she was appointed captain of the club's AFLW side. In 2019 she was traded to Collingwood. Association football career =Club= Davey was initially an Australian rules football player until discovered kicking a ball at age 13 by a soccer scout while on a family holiday. Instantly discovered to have a talent as goalkeeper, Davey made inroads early and made Victorian representative and elite squads. Signed to Melbourne Victory Women as a fifteen-year-old as back-up keeper to Matildas captain Melissa Barbieri in Season 2010‚Äì11, she made three appearances in the short 11 match season. Having done enough to prove to head coach Vicki Linton that she was already as talented as the ageing Barbieri, Linton cut Barbieri and installed Davey as the number one choice. She went on to be the standout keeper for the first half of Season 2011‚Äì12 of the W-League. In August 2013, Davey agreed to play for Swedish Damallsvenskan club Link√∂ping FC during the Australian off-season. Link√∂ping coach Martin Sj√∂gren required a replacement for Sofia Lundgren, who had a back injury. On signing Davey Sj√∂gren described her as \\"probably the world's most talented goalkeeper\\". On 20 August 2015, after five years with Victory, Davey signed a contract with intra-city rivals Melbourne City, becoming the first ever goalkeeper for their newly created W-League side. = International= Davey has represented Australia in the Young Matildas, often facing-off for the starting position with Brisbane Roar prodigy Casey Dumont. After being involved in national team camps for over a year, Davey made her international debut for the Matildas in a 4‚Äì0 friendly victory over Haiti; keeping a clean sheet. After a four-month residency programme, national coach Alen Stajcic surprisingly dropped Davey from Australia's 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup squad. Resurgent veteran Melissa Hudson (n√©e Barbieri) was recalled at Davey's expense. Australian rules football career After missing the World Cup squad, Davey began playing with the St Kilda Sharks in the Victorian Women's Football League in the 2015 winter. Despite not having played Australian rules football since her early junior days, she was quickly recognised as one of the top midfielders in the competition, also capable of playing as a key defender. She played for the in exhibition women's matches in 2015 and 2016, having been the top pick in the 2015 mini-draft held to allocate players for the matches. =AFL Women's= After having played both codes in parallel for two years (soccer in summer and Australian rules football in winter), Davey committed to Australian rules football, signing as a marquee player for Carlton in the inaugural AFL Women's competition. In January 2017, she was announced as the co-vice-captain of Carlton, alongside Madeline Keryk. She made her debut in round 1, 2017, in the club and the league's inaugural match at IKON Park against . At the end of the season, Davey received her team's nominations for both the AFLW Players‚Äô Most Courageous Award and the AFLW Players‚Äô Most Valuable Player Award, and was also listed in the 2017 All-Australian team. She was awarded the club's inaugural best and fairest award in a ceremony in April 2017. Carlton signed Davey for the 2018 season during the trade period in May 2017. She was appointed the team's captain for the 2018 season, taking over for inaugural captain Lauren Arnell. In round 2 she suffered a serious knee injury that was later confirmed to be a season-ending ruptured anterior cruciate ligament. Davey returned to Carlton in 2019 and captained them side to a Grand Final appearance against Adelaide, which was subsequently lost. In April 2019, Davey was traded to Collingwood. In March 2020, Davey was selected for a 2017‚Äì19 retrospective 22under22 squad. =AFLW Statistics= : Statistics are correct to the end of the 2020 season - style=\\"background-color: #eaeaea\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2017   1  6  1  0  58  56  114  23  17  0.2  0.0  9.7  9.3  19.0  3.8  2.7 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2018   1  2  0  0  20  12  32  6  8  0.0  0.0  10.0  6.0  16.0  3.0  4.0 - style=\\"background-color: #eaeaea\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2019   1  9  2  1  81  66  147  31  37  0.2  0.1  9.0  7.3  16.3  3.4  4.1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2020   3  6  0  0  56  67  123  15  32  0.0  0.0  9.3  11.2  20.5  2.5  5.3 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 23 ! 3 ! 1 ! 215 ! 201 ! 416 ! 75 ! 94 ! 0.1 ! 0.1 ! 9.3 ! 8.7 ! 18.1 ! 3.3 ! 4.1 } See also * Women's association football in Australia * Women's Australian rules football in Australia  References  External links  Category:1995 births Category:Australian women's soccer players Category:Living people Category:Melbourne Victory FC (W-League) players Category:Melbourne City FC (W-League) players Category:Link√∂pings FC players Category:W-League (Australia) players Category:Expatriate footballers in Sweden Category:Australia women's international soccer players Category:Women's association football goalkeepers Category:Carlton Football Club (AFLW) players Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:All-Australians (AFL Women's) Category:Footballers who switched code Category:Damallsvenskan players Category:Victorian Women's Football League players ","title":"Brianna Davey"},{"id":"33697749","title":"List of songs recorded by Jennifer Lopez"},{"id":"33697891","text":"Steve Reevis (August 14, 1962 ‚Äì December 7, 2017) was a Native American actor and member of the Blackfoot tribe known for his roles in the films Fargo, Last of the Dogmen, and Dances with Wolves.

His right leg was amputated below the knee after a 1971 motorcycle accident. In 1999 he founded Dynamicaxtion (later named ProsMedix), a company based on the New South Wales Central Coast that makes prosthetic limbs. He has a patent for a \\"Method of construction of moulded products\\" with Wong Cheng-Hing. Career Egan was the captain of the Australian team at the 1980 Arnhem Paralympics, where He won two bronze medals in the Men's 100 m C and Men's 400 m C events.. Retrieved 6 October 2012. At the 1984 New York Games, he won a gold medal in the men‚Äôs 4√ó100 m relay A4‚Äì9 event, a silver medal in the men's 4√ó400 m relay A4‚Äì9 event, and a bronze medal in the Men's 100 m A4 event. In 1984 he became the first person to remove the flesh-coloured covering from his prosthetic leg to improve its performance in competition. He competed in athletics at the 1988 Seoul Paralympics, after which he retired from competition. In a 2000 interview, he said: \\"That was it. Finished. I'd had enough. \`\`I had a young family, and then there were the costs of travelling. You had to pay your way everywhere.\\" Inspired by the prospect of the upcoming 2000 Sydney Paralympics, he began training again in 1996. However, he could no longer compete at an elite level in athletics, so he started playing volleyball, initially in sitting volleyball. He then recruited and participated in Australia's Paralympic standing volleyball team for the 2000 games.

These polysaccharides help protect the bacteria from harsh environments, toxic chemicals, and bacteriophages. The CPS operon contains genes which code for the following proteins: *Wza - a lipoprotein which may form a channel in the bacterial outer membrane. *Wzb - a cytoplasmic regulatory phosphatase which dephosphorylates Wzc. *Wzc - a tyrosine kinase found in the bacterial inner membrane. Participates in polymerization of capsule polysaccharides. *Wzx - Transfers new polysaccharide units across the inner membrane. *Wzy - Assembles longer polysaccharide chains using units introduced by Wzx. The CPS operon is likely transcriptionally regulated by the Rcs (regulation of capsule synthesis) proteins. Reduced levels of membrane-derived oligosaccharides result in autophosphorylation of RcsC. This results in a phosphate group being transferred from RcsC to RcsB. RcsB then binds to RcsA, forming a complex which acts on the CPS promoter and activates transcription of the CPS genes.

The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. Ducati had announced a larger displacement 1299 Panigale for the 2015 model year. Specifications At the time of its release Ducati claimed that the 1199 Panigale was the world's most powerful production twin- cylinder engine motorcycle, with at 10,750 rpm, and torque at 9000 rpm on an engine test stand. With a claimed dry weight of and a curb weight of . Ducati said the 1199 had the highest power-to-weight and torque-to-weight ratios of production motorcycles. Motorcycle Consumer News tested the 2012 Panigale S at and torque at the rear wheel, with a wet weight . They measured a time of 2.98 seconds, a time of 9.91 seconds at , and a top speed to . Braking performance was in and average fuel economy was . Motorcycle Consumer News ranked the 2012 Panigale S with the best rear wheel horsepower to wet weight ratio, 1:2.47, of any bike the magazine had ever tested, as well as the 5th highest rear wheel horsepower, and the 10th highest top speed. The new Superquadro engine is exceptionally oversquare, with a bore:stroke ratio of 1.84:1. Whereas previous Ducatis had belt-driven overhead cams, this engine's valvetrain uses gears and chain. The engine serves as a stressed member, making the Panigale smaller and lighter than a conventionally framed motorcycle. The 1199 is also one of the first production sports motorcycles to feature electronically adjustable suspension. Rebound and compression damping is adjusted electronically while pre-load is still adjusted manually. The 1199's exhaust system and mufflers are underneath the engine, and not beneath the seat as on previous models, such as the 1198 and 1098. Panigale R Ducati 1199 Superleggera In 2012, Ducati added the Panigale R World Superbike homologation model for the 2013 model year. It has lightened engine internals, including titanium connecting rods, and carbon fiber external parts, raising power to and with the track only exhaust and reducing weight to . The top speed of the Panigale R was estimated by Road & Track to be with the track only Termignoni exhaust system it ships with, which they apparently derived from the speed at which the bike hits the rev limiter, assuming nominal gearing and wheel size. (Wes Siler, May 31, 2013) Panigale S Senna In 2013, Ducati again released a variant of their top of the range sportbike - this time the 1199 Panigale S Senna - dedicated to Formula 1 World Champion, Ayrton Senna. The predecessor was based on the 916 released in 1994; in both instances, net proceeds were donated to the Instituto Ayrton Senna charity. 1199 Superleggera In 2014, Ducati launched the 1199 Superleggera (). The philosophy behind this motorcycle was the largest reduction of weight possible, achieved through the use of exotic materials such as magnesium (particularly the monocoque frame), carbon and titanium. This resulted in a dry weight of , and a wet weight of . Only 500 were produced. Racing In the September 2012 Le Mans 24-Hours Motorcycle Endurance Race, a Team Scuderia Zone Rouge Ducati 1199 Panigale won the Open category, finishing 32nd overall. The riders were St√©phane Pagani, Phillipe Teissier and Herv√© Royer. Ducati finished second in the 2015 Superbike World Championship season, with Chaz Davies having 5 wins and finished second in the 2017 championship.

Ogawa Plaza located in front of Oakland City Hall in downtown Oakland, and is an ongoing demonstration. It is allied with Occupy Wall Street, which began in New York City on September 17, 2011, and is one of several \\"Occupy\\" protest sites in the San Francisco Bay Area. Other sites include Occupy San Francisco and Occupy San Jose. Occupy Oakland was inspired by the Occupy movement, which in turn was inspired by the Arab Spring and Greek, Spanish, British, Chilean, and Israeli protest movements. A precursor in the United States was the 2011 Wisconsin protests occurring from late winter through the spring. More specific to Oakland, OO was inspired by local protest history, including protests in response to the BART Police shooting of Oscar Grant in 20092010. First occupation * October 10, 2011 ‚Äì Occupy Oakland began at 4 p.m. with a rally attended by hundreds of supporters, held in tandem with Indigenous People's Day, both as a statement of solidarity and an expression that this action firmly situated itself against colonialism and nation states. A couple dozen protesters set up tents that evening. * October 14, 2011 ‚Äì Protesters participated in a short march from Frank H. Ogawa Plaza to the Oakland Police headquarters and back. * October 15, 2011 ‚Äì Around 2,500 people, including actor Danny Glover, came out for a Saturday march and rally to show their support for Occupy Oakland. * October 17, 2011 ‚Äì On October 17, 2011, Sarah Shourd, Shane Bauer and Joshua Fattal ‚Äî the three American hikers recently freed from an Iranian prison ‚Äî made their first West Coast speaking appearance at Occupy Oakland, drawing an audience of around 300 people. * October 18, 2011 ‚Äì Snow Park camp is established with about two dozen people primarily because the Frank H. Ogawa Plaza site was running out of room. * October 19, 2011 ‚Äì The Alameda County Health Department visits the plaza on the pretext of \\"upholding public safety\\", specifically whether conditions were sanitary and whether rats that had previously been living in bushes in the park had been present in the encampment. No evidence was found of a rat problem within the camp. County representatives offered some recommendations but no aid. * October 20, 2011 ‚Äì The City of Oakland issued an official notice to the encampment citing \\"violence, assaults, threats and intimidation\\", among other complaints, and, forbidding lodging overnight. The demonstrators \\"appeared determined not to leave\\" and countered that \\"the rats, drug crimes, and violence in the area of 14th Street and Broadway went unchecked before they arrived.\\" The grandnephew of labor leader and civil rights activist C√©sar Ch√°vez got married at the protest site. * October 22, 2011 ‚Äì Protesters marched from Frank H. Ogawa Plaza to Snow Park. Some protesters entered a Chase Bank branch and ripped up hundreds of deposit slips and threw them in the air, while some protesters stayed to help clean up the deposit slips. After leaving Chase, they protested outside of a Wells Fargo branch before returning to Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. First raid and aftermath * October 25, 2011 (5 AM6 AM) ‚Äì Police officers in riot gear from various Bay Area law enforcement agencies cleared both Frank Ogawa Plaza and Snow Park in the morning resulting in over 102 arrests. * October 25, 2011 (4 PM8 PM) ‚Äì Hundreds of protesters and supporters gathered in front of the Oakland Public Library to march back to Frank H. Ogawa Plaza to reclaim the space. The march continued around the city for about two hours, and then moved in on the plaza. Police issued a dispersal order which failed to move the crowd, and fired tear gas, and beanbag rounds. Scott Olsen, a former Marine and Iraq War veteran, suffered a skull fracture caused by a shooting projectile that witnesses believed was a tear gas or smoke canister fired by the police. * October 26, 2011 ‚Äì More than a thousand protesters gathered peacefully at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza and held a general assembly in the plaza's amphitheater. They agreed to organize a general strike for November 2. The Oakland Police Department released a statement confirming the use of bean bag rounds. Plaza reoccupied * October 27, 2011 ‚Äì At least 1,000 protesters held a candlelight vigil for Scott Olsen at Frank Ogawa Plaza. The plaza was re-taken by protesters in the evening. Mayor Jean Quan issued a statement urging non- violence and asked that there be no overnight camping; however, the city did not take steps to prevent the re-occupation. Scott Olsen's medical status was upgraded from \\"critical\\" to \\"fair\\" by doctors at Highland Hospital, although surgery was still being considered in order to reduce pressure on his brain. * October 28, 2011 ‚Äì Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore spoke to a crowd of about 1,000 protesters. In the hour-long address, Michael Moore encouraged Occupy Oakland by saying, \\"We've killed despair across the country and we've killed apathy.\\" Dozens of new tents were erected in the plaza, including a medical tent provided and staffed by the California Nurses Association. Pro- democracy protesters in Egypt marched from Cairo's Tahrir Square to the U.S. Embassy in solidarity with Occupy Oakland. * October 30, 2011 ‚Äì Wounded veteran Scott Olsen's roommate Keith Shannon reported that doctors expect Olsen to make a full recovery. * October 31, 2011 ‚Äì Representatives of Occupy Oakland held a press conference detailing plans for the general strike on November 2. * November 1, 2011 ‚Äì The Oakland Police Officer's Association issued an open letter to the citizens of Oakland expressing \\"confusion\\" about Mayor Quan's decision making. The open letter took issue with Mayor Quan's decision to allow public employees to participate in the upcoming general strike. November 2 general strike * November 2, 2011 ‚Äì Tens of thousands of protesters gathered at Frank Ogawa Plaza to participate in rallies, marches, and teach-ins designed to empower citizens and to draw attention to economic inequity and corporate greed as part of the 2011 Oakland general strike. Some estimate that the march to the Port of Oakland drew as much as 100,000 protesters. A small group vandalized a Whole Foods storefront, and broke windows and ATMs of Bank of America and Wells Fargo banks in the afternoon. :* November 2 (11 PM)November 3 (1 AM) ‚Äì Later in the evening, a group of protesters took over a vacant building that once served as the headquarters of the Traveler's Aid Society, a non-profit organization that provided services to the local homeless population. Police soon arrived to break up the protesters gathered outside of the building. Some protesters fled while others set a barricade on fire. Police used teargas and flash bangs to try to clear protesters. Clashes continued past midnight. 103 people were arrested. Scott Campbell was shot by police using a less-lethal round while he was filming a stationary line of police in riot gear.Experts: \\"Occupy\\" video shows excessive force Kayvan Sabeghi was seriously injured while being arrested by police that evening.

Journalist Susie Cagle was arrested and subsequently reported having observed mistreatment of protesters during their imprisonment. The Oakland Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce issued a letter calling for the eviction of the protestors. * November 4 ‚Äì The Oakland City Council held a five-hour meeting to consider a resolution by council member Nancy Nadel in support of the Occupy Oakland encampment. The council heard over 100 people speak about the positives and negatives of Occupy Oakland. The vote on the resolution was postponed until the November 15 city council meeting. * November 5 ‚Äì A downtown Oakland Wells Fargo branch closed for business because of the roughly 100 immigrant rights protesters who marched from Occupy Oakland's encampment to protest the bank's connection to companies that run immigrant detention centers. * November 7 ‚Äì Occupy Oakland deposited $20,000 donated by Occupy Wall Street for urgent medical and legal expenses into Wells Fargo. The Occupy Oakland general assembly approved the decision to hold it temporarily in a Wells Fargo account so that it could begin being used immediately while the group waits on the state to finalize its status as an unincorporated association able to hold funds. : * November 9 ‚Äì Five members of the Oakland City Council, two dozen clergy and some local small business owners held a press conference calling for the immediate eviction of Occupy Oakland. Occupy protesters interrupted Larry Reid's speech with chants. The council members and business owners responded with their own chants.

During the Nazi era, exiles from all over Europe went there, particularly from Germany. A number of them became leading figures in German politics in the postwar era. Initial reports of the hotel were very good, although its problem with rats was mentioned as early as 1921. Communists from more than 50 countries came for congresses and for training or to work. By the 1930s, Joseph Stalin had come to regard the international character of the hotel with suspicion and its occupants as potential spies. His purges created an atmosphere of fear among the occupants, who were faced with mistrust, denunciations, and nightly arrests. The purges at the hotel peaked between 1936 and 1938. Germans who fled Hitler for safety in the Soviet Union found themselves interrogated, arrested, tortured, and sent to forced labor camps. Most of the 178 leading German communists who were killed in Stalin's purges were residents of Hotel Lux.

The hotel was taken over by the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution and renamed –õ—é–∫—Å—ä, i.e. Hotel de luxe. It came to be used by the Communist International (Comintern) as lodging for communist revolutionaries from other countries.Alexander Cammann, \\"M√ºde Kalauer im roten Bunker\\" Die Zeit (October 23, 2011). Retrieved November 13, 2011 Guests were lodged according to hierarchy, more important individuals received better rooms.Weber (October 2006), p. 56 Some rooms were also used for meetings. In June and July 1921, 600 delegates who came to the Third World Congress of the Communist International from 52 countries were housed at Hotel Lux. With the sudden influx of so many international revolutionaries, the hotel began to be known as the \\"headquarters of the world revolution\\". Germany alone sent 41 delegates. The Hamburg Uprising was discussed at the hotel, both before and after the events. After the Comintern was founded, many of the Party's leading functionaries lived at the hotel, including Ernst ReuterWeber (October 2006), p. 57 and the hotel became the best known of the Comintern's buildings, although its offices were elsewhere.  1933 through World War II  In 1933, two stories were added, giving the hotel 300 rooms. The address, meanwhile, was changed to Gorky Street 10. 1933 was also the year Adolf Hitler gained power with the Machtergreifung and soon began to arrest and imprison his political opponents, arresting communists and socialists by the thousands. German communists began to flee to the Soviet Union and the Hotel Lux began to fill with German exiles.Weber (October 2006), p. 58 In addition to party functionaries, there were advisors, translators and writers who came with their families. Employees were brought to the Comintern Central Committee's offices by bus.‚ÄûEmigranten: Hotel Lux‚Äú Geo Epoche, No. 38 (August 2009).

There was hot water only twice a week, forcing people to shower in groups, as many as four people at a time. Communal kitchens for the use of residents cooked food next to boiling pots of diapers being sterilized. In spite of the conditions, initially, there was camaraderie among the residents. Children played in the halls and attended a German-language school, the Karl Liebknecht School, set up for the children of exiles.Walter Laqueur, Generation Exodus: The Fate of Young Jewish Refugees from Nazi Germany Tauris Parke Paperbacks (2004), pp. 168‚Äì169 .

The hotel then gained a second name, that of \\"the golden cage of the Comintern\\" because many would like to have left, but could not while being investigated. Between 1936 and 1938, many residents of the hotel were arrested and interrogated by the NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs). Suspicion and betrayal created an atmosphere of fear. Arrests came in the middle of the night,Chris Johnstone, \\"Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω: architect of Communist takeover and purge victim\\" Radio Praha (July 8, 2009). Retrieved November 13, 2011 so that some residents slept in their clothes, others paced the floor, or played games of concentration to mask the stress. An investigation or arrest was prompted more by the atmosphere of terror than by charges of wrongdoing, which were often baseless. Walter Laqueur later wrote of the period, \\"There was no rhyme or reason as to who was arrested and who was not, the security organs were given a plan to fulfill, a certain number of people were to be arrested in a certain region, and from this stage on it was more or less a matter of accident at whose door the NKVD (the secret police) emissaries would knock in the early hours of the morning.\\"Walter Laqueur, Generation Exodus Brandeis University Press (2001), p. 171\\\\. Retrieved November 26, 2011 The procedure was for the NKVD to knock, the accused was told to pack a small suitcase with a few things, get dressed and wait outside the door to be picked up and taken away. Then the NKVD returned to collect the accused and seal the door. One night, the NKVD knocked on the Langs' door and Franz Lang was told to get ready. Dutifully waiting outside his door to be picked up, the security police returned. \\"What are you doing standing around out here?\\", asked the NKVD. Lang replied that he'd been ordered to do so. \\"What's your room number?\\", asked the security officer. \\"Number 13.\\" \\"We're only taking away the even numbers tonight!\\" Astonished, Lang went back to bed. Nor did the NKVD ever knock on his door again.\\"Nachts kamen Stalins H√§scher\\", p. 105 In the morning, the doors of those arrested were sealed;Weber (October 2006), p. 60 the wives and children had to move to other quarters and were ostracized as \\"enemies of the state\\". The children of parents under investigation were placed in orphanages, where some died from illness and others rejected both their parents and their own German identity. Some of the adults arrested were sent to a gulag or were executed. Those who came back were regarded with suspicion, as was the case with Herbert Wehner, who was taken away and returned twice. Such people were assumed to have betrayed others under torture or to save themselves. In Wehner's case, that was what happened. By 1938, in order to get upstairs in the hotel, a propusk was needed, a document that said one was authorized to get past the armed guard, standing in front of the elegant Art Nouveau elevator.\\"Nachts kamen Stalins H√§scher\\", p. 98 Even high- level members of the Comintern could not get past the guard without a propusk. The atmosphere affected the children. Rolf Sch√§like, who was a child at Hotel Lux, later wrote, \\"I grew up in Moscow, in the center of power, and state and non-state criminality, Gorky Street, Hotel Lux. It was the years 1938‚Äì1946. Around us too, there was juvenile violence. We played 'partisan and German fascists' in our Hotel Lux, and one kid in our group was hanged‚Äîfor fun. He couldn't be revived again. There were frequent battles with iron bands with the kids from the neighboring building.\\" Of the 1400 leading German communists, a total of 178 were killed in Stalin's purges, nearly all of them residents of Hotel Lux.Weber (October 2006), p. 59 By comparison, the Nazis killed 222 of those 1400 leading German communists. Within the top leadership itself, there were 59 Politburo members between 1918 and 1945, six of whom were killed by Nazis and seven by the Stalinist purges. The saying among the German communists was, \\"What the Gestapo left of the Communist Party of Germany, the NKVD picked up.\\" When Leon Trotsky was killed in August 1940, the purges at Hotel Lux stopped, bringing a brief respite to the exiles. = Evacuation and return = Ten months later, in June 1941, Operation Barbarossa began, Nazi Germany's assault on the Soviet Union.\\"Nachts kamen Stalins H√§scher\\", p. 106 In 1941, the hotel was evacuated. The first residents returned in February 1942. At the end of World War II, the Ulbricht Group left Hotel Lux for the airport to return to Germany on 30 April 1945 to become the new leaders of the German Democratic Republic. The purpose of the trip and whether or not the assignment was temporary or a permanent return to Germany was not known to the whole group until they arrived in Berlin.Arthur Lee Smith, The War for the German Mind: Re-educating Hitler's Soldiers Berghahn Books (1996), p. 120\\\\.

Post-Soviet era  After the collapse of communism, the hotel housed offices, small travel agencies, liquidation companies and other small businesses on the lower floors, the upper floors remained hotel rooms. The building, still called Hotel Tsentralnaya, was bought by the holding company Unikor in 2007. Unikor and its majority shareholder, Boris Ivanishvili bought the hotel to renovate it and re-open it as a luxury hotel. There were mostly offices in the building at the time of its sale.

The street name has been restored to Tverskaya; the building remains number 10.  Legacy  Numerous guests and residents of Hotel Lux have written about the hotel, initially in reports and articles, later in books and memoirs. Early reports from before the purges were often positive, though mentions of rats appear from the beginning. Accommodations were described in favorable terms and the atmosphere as full of camaraderie. In East Germany in the 1950s and 1960s, the Socialist Unity Party commissioned memoirs (Erinnerungsberichte) from former exiles who had lived there. These were carefully written official reports that sanitized and supported the official version of events. Franziska Reubens, who lived there with her husband and children, wrote in guarded language, \\"It is not easy to write about the memories from that time, to write about them honestly.\\" Other people turned away from the Communist Party, some as a result of their exile in the Soviet Union, and wrote more bluntly and critically about the hotel, such as Ruth von Mayenburg, who in one passage, used cannibalism as a metaphor to describe the period.\\"K√∂stliche Entdeckung\\" Der Spiegel (November 3, 1969).

Ohio State University. . and also held academic posts at George Washington University, Georgetown and Johns Hopkins University.Fischer, A. (1994). Repetition. Gunter Narr Verlag. . Life and career Roland Fischer was born in Budapest in 1915. Six months before the start of World War II in 1939, Roland Fischer left Hungary to study chemistry at the University of Basel in Switzerland, where he received his Ph.D. in 1945.Laughlin, C. (Winter, 1991). Profile in Research: Roland Fischer. Neuroanthropology Network Newsletter. Carleton University. 4(1). Fischer was active between 1951 and 1977 and was the author of more than 350 publications.Erowid References Database In the 1970s, Fischer was a lecturer in pharmacology at the George Washington University Medical School and the Johns Hopkins Medical School and an editor for the Journal of Altered States of Consciousness. At this time, his interests involved biofeedback and EEG research on different states of consciousness. In 1977, he retired to the island of Majorca where he died in 1997. In gratitude for the opportunities for engaging in teaching and research offered in his late days by the University of the Balearic Islands, he donated his personal collection of books to the library of the University of the Balearic Islands.According to his friend Paul A. Fabry in his self-published book Detours: The Art Of Uncommon Travel (2004). See . The claim is reasonable considering Fischer was born in 1915 and Fabry is a noted figure in New Orleans (founder of the World Trade Centers Association) whose work and life has been covered by many reliable sources. Except for Fabry, there are no other known English sources covering Fischer's death, although they may appear in the German, Hungarian or Spanish language. Model psychosis hypothesis Like German chemist Kurt Beringer (1893-1949) before him, Roland Fischer began looking for an explanatory model of psychosis for schizophrenia in the late 1940s by comparing it to altered states produced by hallucinogens.Langlitz, Nicolas David. (2007). Neuropsychedelia. The Revival of Hallucinogen Research since the Decade of the Brain. University of California, Berkeley. Doctoral dissertation. In the 1950s, Roland Fischer was quoted by Humphry Osmond in 1956 for having previously studied schizophrenia as a research biochemist.Osmond, Humphry (1956). Research on Schizophrenia. In H.A. Abramson (Ed.) Neuropharmacology. Transactions of the 2nd Conference, May 25‚Äì27, 1955. Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation. New York. p. 183. Fischer explored the model psychosis hypothesis of altered drug states originally studied by Beringer in 1927. Fischer and other researchers wondered if LSD could act as a chemical model for schizophrenia. However, as biochemical research progressed over time, the theory was rejected as newer evidence showed that both substance- induced psychosis and organic psychosis are remarkably different. Taste science In the 1960s, he helped contribute to research on gustation and is credited with discovering the association between the ability to taste PROP (6-n-propylthiouracil) with food preferences and body weight, and its relationship to alcohol use and smoking.Stricker, E. M.; Woods, S. (2004). Neurobiology of Food and Fluid Intake. Springer. . His early work in taste science contributed to later research on supertasting.Prescott, J.; Tepper, Beverly J. (2004). Genetic Variation in Taste Sensitivity. CRC Press. . Perception-hallucination continuum Between 1968 and the late 1980s, Roland Fischer developed a model for altered states of consciousness in several stages known as the perception-hallucination continuum. On one end of the continuum were ecstatic states, such as mystical rapture, separated by hyperaroused and hallucinatory states that schizophrenics might experience, followed by an aroused state, such as during creativity. Normal consciousness resides in the middle of the continuum. On the other end are the hypoaroused states, such as those experienced during samadhi, separated by tranquil states, for example during Zen meditation.Connolly, Peter (2000).

The Forgotten Characters of Old San Francisco. Including the Famous Bummer & Lazarus, and Emperor Norton. ([By] Robert Ernest Cowan, Anne Bancroft and Addie L. Ballou.) [With Illustrations, Including Plates and Portraits.]. pp. xi. 103. Los Angeles: Ward Ritchie Press, 1964. \\"The Forgotten Characters of Old San Francisco. Including the Famous Bummer & Lazarus, and Emperor Norton,\\" WorldCat (Dublin, Ohio: OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc.) Ballou took an active part in the Spiritualist movement as a writer and lecturer. Her reform and philanthropy interests included prisons, the unfortunates, and fallen women. She supported Victoria Woodhull in her campaign for President of the United States in 1872. Later, as a pioneer of California, Ballou continued her Spiritualist writing and lecturing, suffrage work, and campaigning for political change for women. She became the second female notary public in that state in 1891. She also developed her artistic talents while studying painting at the San Francisco School of Design. In 1897 she was commissioned to paint the official portrait of the 18th governor of California, Henry Markham. Early life and education Addie Ballou was born in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, on April 29, 1838, to Alexander Hamilton and Mary \\"Polly\\" (Eldredge) Hart, early settlers of that town. Her strictly orthodox parents were from New York, where they were married in 1827, and where three of Addie's older siblings were born. After removing to Ohio in the early 1830s, Addie was the fifth of eight children born to Alexander and Polly. However, after the death of Addie's mother in 1846, Alexander remarried three times, fathering six more children. The early death of her mother and the removal of her family to the frontier in Wisconsin in 1849 deprived her of the opportunity of more than a year or two of a common school education. By the late 1840s, the Hart family had moved to the \\"Fox Cities\\" area in the Eastern part of Wisconsin, settling along the northeastern tip of Lake Winnebago. In 1853 Alexander Hart was the elected Chairman of the newly formed town of Lima (now Harrison) in Calumet County, Wisconsin. It was here that Addie met her future husband, Albert Darius Ballou, Lima's town clerk. Albert was also the great-grandnephew of Hosea Ballou and cousin of both Hosea Ballou II and Maturin Murray Ballou. Addie Hart and Albert Ballou were married in Harrison on December 26, 1854. Four sons, Edward, Miner and Myron (twins), and Clarence, were born there in Calumet County (Myron died at two months of age). A daughter, Evangeline, was born in 1866 in Minnesota. The couple divorced in 1869. Civil War nurse Although her boys were still very young at the time, Ballou offered her services to the Governor of Wisconsin during the American Civil War and began working as a nurse in camp of the 32nd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment of the Union Army, where there were many ill and wounded. Surgeon General Erastus B. Wolcott at Milwaukee then commissioned her, and she went with the regiment to Memphis, Tennessee, where she came to be known as \\"The Little Mother.\\" She went on to write many poems about the Civil War and her experiences connected with her participation. Ballou was the only woman honored as a member of the James A. Garfield Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.) San Francisco unit. In 1892 she helped reorganize the Civil War nurses (formerly called the Ex-Army Nurses' Association) into a newly named affiliation: the National Association of Army Nurses of the Late War, and, for her efforts, was elected their first President. The group would later, in 1901, become the National Association of Army Nurses of the Civil War. Post- war life Addie Ballou was active in the Spiritualist reform movement, which included support of suffrage activities. A frequent speaker at both Spiritualist and Women Suffrage conventions, she spoke alongside Susan B. Anthony at Farwell Hall in Chicago, June 1870. As the wave for suffrage began to swell, Ballou went with others to Washington, D.C. in January 1872 for the semi-annual National Woman Suffrage Convention held at Lincoln Hall. Present (among others) were Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Laura de Force Gordon, Mrs. Cuppy Smith, Victoria Woodhull, and the \\"highly inspirational and eloquent Addie Ballou.\\" This gathering was to present the signed petition, containing 45,000 names of women, to the Judiciary committees of Congress, demanding their rights at the ballot box, as given by the 14th and 15th amendments. Ballou's poem \\"Song of Victory\\" reflects that experience. A journalist and lecturer on temperance, women's suffrage, prison reform, Ballou also wrote poems that were published in newspapers across the country. She would publish two books of her poetry: Driftwood and The Padre's Dream and Other Poems. Ballou's mediumistic tendencies were discovered at a young age and focused into speaking and writing as an adult. After her divorce in 1869, she traveled extensively, lecturing and preaching Spiritualism. She also became legally authorized to perform marriage ceremonies by a letter of fellowship from the Religio-Philosophical Society. Under the auspices of the Victorian Association of Progressive Spiritualists, Ballou traveled to Melbourne, in the summer of 1885. She presented a series of lectures at the Bijou Theatre, as a representative of allied psychic societies in the United States. Thomas Welton Stanford, co-founder of the Australian sponsoring association and brother of Leland Stanford and Charles Stanford, invited her to stay on after her lecture series as a guest in Thomas Stanford's Melbourne mansion. She stayed for three years, conducting psychic phenomena investigations and painting numerous pieces for Mr. Stanford's extensive art collection. Ballou exhibited her work at the Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. California and later life Ballou first ventured to the Pacific coast in 1874, whereupon she continued her speaking engagements and writing. She also began studying painting under Virgil Williams, the first director and teacher of the San Francisco School of Design (now the San Francisco Art Institute). She became a well-known artist and received proper recognition. Her portrait of Henry Markham, Governor of California 1891‚Äì1895, hangs in the State Capitol in Sacramento, California. Her portraits of other notables were: George Tisdale Bromley, John Brown, J. W. Burling, William Edward Bushnell, John Wallace \\"Captain Jack\\" Crawford, Michael Harry de Young, Ulysses S. Grant as well as his three sons, Abraham Lincoln, William McKinley, William S. Moses, \\"Emperor\\" Joshua Abraham Norton, Thomas Paine, Philip Augustine Roach, Jane Lathrop Stanford, and Thomas Welton Stanford. Her recollections about painting Emperor Norton's portrait in 1877 were published in The Forgotten Characters of Old San Francisco. Ballou was also known for painting landscapes, fruit, and controversial nudes. The painting Morning was refused at the 1890 California State Fair in Sacramento because of its subject matter (nude) and realism; however, Thomas Stanford purchased the piece the following year. She remained heavily involved in multiple political and women's reform organizations, including the California State Women's Suffrage Association with Laura de Force Gordon. In 1891, working alongside Clara Foltz for progressive legislation, Ballou appeared before the California State Legislature promoting a bill which would allow appointment of women as notaries. Clara Foltz became the California's first female notary; Ballou the second, by appointment of Governor Henry Markham. Ballou maintained an office and studio in the Donohoe Building, 1170 Market Street, San Francisco when the 1906 earthquake and fires occurred. She lost all documents and paintings not at her residence, 408 30th Street, San Francisco, which was spared. Addie L. Ballou died at her home in San Francisco, August 10, 1916. She is interred in an unmarked grave in the family plot in Igo, Shasta County, California.

The tracks are usually in a range of 145‚Äì155 BPM. At the height of its popularity, nitzhonot reached mainstream success in Israel. The most notable artist from this genre is Eyal Barkan, who released his album Good Morning Israel in 1998. It became the first trance record that achieved gold status in its home country, selling more than 20,000 copies (bootleg versions accounted for 80,000). Other artists from Greece and Israel would also gain popularity that year. In the 2000s, Astrix emerged as another notable Israeli nitzhonot artist. Before most artists in Israel changed their direction to Full On, artists in Greece rode the tide.

Despite the strict laws imposed by the Apartheid government during his lifetime, van Wyk's homosexuality was ignored by the authorities throughout his career due to the nationalistic nature of his music. Early life Arnoldus Christiaan Vlok van Wyk was born on 26 April 1916 on the farm Klavervlei, not far from Calvinia, a small town in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. He was the sixth of eight children. His mother, Helena van Dyk, came from a wealthy family seemingly descended from the seventeenth century court painter Anthony van Dyck. The couple married when farming provided reasonable hopes of financial security, however Van Wyk's father was never an efficient manager of the business. Little is known about his childhood other than that life was difficult.S. Muller, \\"Arnold van Wyk's hard, stony, flinty path, or making things beautiful in apartheid South Africa,\\" The Musical Times, 2008, p.61 From as early as 1918, the family struggled financially, his father Arnoldus Christiaan Vlok van Wyk abused his wife and children. Several members of the family, including Van Wyk's mother and eldest sisters, demonstrated musical talent but had little opportunity for musical education. Musical education Van Wyk took occasional piano lessons from his 'favourite\\" sister Minnie and soon he was \\"improvising dramatic piano illustrations of stories told by anyone soft-hearted enough to pay him sixpence.\\"P. Klatzow, Composers in South Africa Today, 1987, p.1 At 16, Van Wyk was sent to boarding school at Stellenbosch Boys' High School in Stellenbosch. He took piano lessons first from the cellist Hans Endler and later from Miss C.E. van der Merwe. His mother died in Somerset Hospital in Cape Town, followed a few weeks later by the death of his eldest sister. He matriculated at the age of seventeen and decided to spend the next year preparing for an overseas piano scholarship, an effort that proved unsuccessful. He took a job in Cape Town in the claims department at an insurance company. During this time, he made contact with Charles Weich, music critic of the Afrikaans newspaper Die Burger, who invited him to perform for the first time at a concert of works \\"by unknown South African composers\\" hosted by the Oranjeklub. It brought an audience to Van Wyk's works and provided the young composer with a voice. London apprenticeship In 1938, Van Wyk began studies aimed at a BA-degree at the University of Stellenbosch. He interrupted his studies to study at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He was the first South African composer to receive a Performing Right Scholarship to study there, initially granted for one academic year. Van Wyk received permission to continue his studies there until 1944. While studying at the Royal Academy, Van Wyk received many prizes, including the 1941 Worshipful Company of Musicians Medal, awarded to the most distinguished student in the Academy. Van Wyk had many concerns about his first professional training from his composition teacher, Theodor Holland. After a few months at the Royal Academy, Van Wyk wrote in a letter:S. Muller, \\"The Musical Times\\", Arnold van Wyk's hard, stony, flinty path, or making things beautiful in apartheid South Africa, 2008, p.64 During Van Wyk's time at the Royal Academy, his works were performed at several student concerts, including his Violin Concerto, conducted by Sir Henry Wood and performed by fellow student Doreen Cordell in 1940. To supplement his income, Van Wyk took a job at the recently formed Afrikaans section of the BBC, where he worked as announcer, translator, deviser of programmes, and newsreader, for the remainder of his time in London. Through this BBC appointment he met British composer and musicologist Howard Ferguson, who was \\"immensely impressed by [the] beauty and originality\\" of his works.H. Ferguson, 1996, p.83 A lifelong relationship developed from this meeting and resulted in performances of several of Wyk's works on stages throughout the United Kingdom during his eight-year stay there. The first of these public performances included Van Wyk's \\"Five Elegies for String Quartet\\", performed as part of the well-known National Gallery Concerts. Other works performed included his two piano-duet works, \\"Three Improvisations on Dutch Folksongs,\\" and the variations entitled \\"Poerpasledam\\", an Afrikaans corruption of the French \\"pour passer le temps). Other works performed during Van Wyk's stay in England were of his First Symphony, also conducted by Sir Henry Wood, as part of a special BBC broadcast on South Africa's Union Day celebrations in 1943, and the Saudade for violin and orchestra, originally the middle movement of the Violin Concerto, performed by violinist Olive Zorian at an Albert Hall Promenade Concert conducted by Sir Adrian Boult.P. Klatzow, Composers in South Africa Today, 1987, p.3 Some critics questioned Van Wyk's popularity with English audiences and argued that the BBC promoted his works as part of its larger campaign on behalf of the Afrikaners who formed part of the Allied Forces of World War II.S. Muller, \\"Sounding Margins: Musical Representations of White South Africa\\", D.Phil. diss., University of Oxford, 2000, p. 37. Muller quotes a letter that the Empire Music Supervisor, Rollo Myers, wrote to Hubert Clifford, in which he says: \\"May I ask you to see that there is the maximum possible exploitation on the publicity side of the fact that Arnold van Wyk is an Afrikaans composer and that England has given him his musical education.\\" Wyk returned to South Africa in 1946 following the end of the Second World War. Return to South Africa When Van Wyk returned to South Africa in early December 1946 \\"he received a heart-warming welcome\\".P. Klatzow, Composers in South Africa Today, 1987, p. 3 His return prompted an interest in contributing to South African art music, motivated by nationalist concerns.M.J. Thom, \\"Die laat klavierwerke van Arnold van Wyk (1916‚Äì1983), M.Mus. diss., University of Stellenbosch, 2006, p. 17 During the next couple of years Wyk worked as a freelance composer and musician and made several tours of piano recitals throughout the Union of South Africa, a concert series organised by the then Reddingsdaadbond, an organisation established in 1939 to promote and invest in cultural projects throughout the Union. The concerts were designed to cultivate classical music appreciation among rural Afrikaners. Musical nationalism Numerous music critics have questioned the \\"nationalistic style\\" that appears in van Wyk's works.One questions his 'nationalistic style,' when he writes: ‚ÄúHy het maar ‚Äòn boereseun gebly en dit tel soveel by sy mede- Afrikaners as sy meesterlike spel en skitterende komposisies‚Äù. du Preez, 1978, p.1 At a public lecture in 1955 for the Commonwealth section of the Royal Society of Arts, critic Stewart Hylton-Edwards pointed out that Van Wyk would not be capable \\"to write English music to the end of his days\\".J. Bouws, \\"Solank daar Musiek is: Musiek en Musiekmakers in Suid-Afrika (1652‚Äì1982)\\", 1982, p. 181 Another argues that Van Wyk felt exploited by the nationalists and that they were only concerned with his contribution to the cultivation process of South African Art Music.M.J. Thom, \\"Die laat klavierwerke van Arnold van Wyk (1916‚Äì1983), M.Mus. diss., University of Stellenbosch, 2006, p. 18 Wyk especially disliked his connections with the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), which frequently commissioned works from him and presented him with his only broadcasting opportunities. In South Africa Van Wyk continued working on his \\"Kersfees Kantata\\" (Christmas Cantata), a work he had begun composing in London that promised him financial security with yearly state-sponsored broadcasts. To avoid any further connections with the Afrikaner Nationalists, Van Wyk accepted an appointment as lecturer in Music at the English-speaking University of Cape Town, a post that \\"promised security while allowing some time for composition and piano playing\\". He completed his Second Symphony (Sinfonia Ricercata) during this time, a work commissioned for the 1952 Van Riebeeck Festival, as well as his orchestral work \\"Rapsodie\\" (1951). Several scholars argue that Van Wyk's songs represent his finest work. Following his Rhapsody came an important song-cycle \\"Van Liefde en Verlatenheid\\", praised by critic Malcolm Rayment as \\"one of the most important contributions of our time to the literature of songs\\".J. Bouws, \\"Suid-Afrikaanse Komponiste van Vandag en Gister\\", 1957, p. 181 Also, as Ferguson writes: ‚ÄúWith great sensitivity and skill he has captured the varied moods of Eug√®ne Marais‚Äô magnificent poems and clothed them in music of outstanding beauty. J. Bouws, \\"Suid-Afrikaanse Komponiste van Vandag en Gister\\", 1982, p.3 The first performance of \\"Van Liefde en Verlatenheid\\" took place at the University of Cape Town Music Festival in 1953. Van Wyk briefly returned to London during 1954‚Äì56 for a series of concerts. During this time he worked primarily on a large-scale piano work \\"Nagmusiek\\" in memory of his friend Noel Mewton-Wood, an Australian pianist who committed suicide in 1953.P. Klatzow, Composers in South Africa Today, 1987, p.4 Although Van Wyk composed simply because he wanted to create \\"beautiful things,\\" his connection to the ideologies of Afrikaner Nationalism was unavoidable. For the Union Festival in Bloemfontein in 1960 Van Wyk wrote one of his most important works up to that time, the symphonic suite \\"Primavera\\", important for its length as well as its prominence among his orchestral works.P. Klatzow, Composers in South Africa Today, 1987, p. 4 It comprises four movements played without interruption, of which the third movement makes extensive use of a minnelied, as used by the thirteenth-century German poet Neidhart von Reuenthal. Toward the end of his career Van Wyk was especially attracted by the idea of composing unaccompanied vocal works, such as his \\"Aanspraak virrie latenstyd\\" (1973‚Äì83) and his \\"Missa in illo tempore\\" (1979). He told an interviewer: \\"At the moment this is the thing that stirs me the most; the idea of people singing without instruments. Maybe it has something to do with where the world is going.\\"M.J. Thom, \\"Die laat klavierwerke van Arnold van Wyk (1916‚Äì1983), M.Mus. diss., University of Stellenbosch, 2006, p. 19 Prominence During 1952 Van Wyk was made a Fellow of the Royal Academy and made several trips to Europe. Important performances outside of the UK and South Africa included a performance of his \\"Eerste Strykkwartet\\" (First String Quartet) in Brussels for the International Society for Contemporary Music in 1950 and a performance of his song-cycle \\"Van liefde en Verlatenheid\\" during the society's 1954 festival in Israel. During this festival van Wyk received the Jeunesses Musicales Prize. The performance of his song-cycle at the festival was so well received that it was performed on several occasions that same year in the Netherlands, London, and Oslo. Van Wyk was made Honorary Doctor of Music by the University of Cape Town in 1972 and by the University of Stellenbosch in 1981.P. Klatzow, Composers in South Africa Today, 1987, p.6 Compositional style and development Despite the acknowledgements and critical acclaim Van Wyk received during his lifetime for his works, he would never conquest his self-critical voice; consequently the majority of Van Wyk's works were often revised after its first performance. In total, excluding the revised works, Van Wyk composed a mere twenty-seven compositions during his lifetime. Van Wyk's most fundamental stylistic developments took shape in Europe during his early youth. As did many of Van Wyk's contemporaries of the time, he felt that the stature of any composer, and more importantly, a composer from South Africa, had to be measured by the European landscape of artistic merit and aesthetic values.S. Muller, \\"The Musical Times\\", Arnold van Wyk's hard, stony, flinty path, or making things beautiful in apartheid South Africa, 2008, p.62 Of his work ethic, Howard Ferguson said: ‚ÄúHe is a slow and meticulous worker, also extremely self-critical, as can be seen from his habit of revising works after their first performance, or even withdrawing them altogether. Indeed one sometimes wonders whether he is not apt to be too self-critical‚Äù.P. Klatzow, \\"Composers in South Africa Today\\", 1987, p.3 Van Wyk's first musical idioms reflected late Romantic musical traditions and is tonal and 'neo-Romantic'. Van Wyk was aware of the stylistic limitations of his own music, but also followed the so-called 'post-modern' European compositional developments, with composers such as Hindemith, Stravinsky, and Schoenberg. During a SAUK- interview in 1972, Van Wyk explained the following: > Baiekeer dink ek my musiek is min of meer Romanties en tradisioneel‚Ä¶ en > watter mark is daar nou eintlik daarvoor?Smith, 1991, p.26 His compositional developments radically changed when he received formal instruction in composition, as previously mentioned, at the RAM, UK. He rejected the traditions of his English contemporaries, such as Britten and Walton, and instead followed his musical instincts, as Van Wyk recalls his compositional methods were done instinctively, therefore without having to explain each step in a logical manner.M.J. Thom, \\"Die laat klavierwerke van Arnold van Wyk (1916‚Äì1983), M.Mus. diss., University of Stellenbosch, 2006, p.22 As concert pianist, and follower of the Romantic ideologies, Van Wyk soon after became interested in the piano works by composers such as the late works of Beethoven, Chopin, and Liszt. This \\"lack of strong inner creative direction\\" is also evident in van Wyk's \\"frequent use of imported material of various kinds as the basic points of departure for further musical treatment\\".S. Muller, \\"The Musical Times\\", Arnold van Wyk's hard, stony, flinty path, or making things beautiful in apartheid South Africa, 2008, p.69 During his stay in the UK, and thanks to his friendship with Ferguson, Van Wyk socialised with the likes of Ralph Vaughan Williams and Gerald Finzi, of which both were following the 'after wave' of post-Elgar tonal idioms.M.J. Thom, \\"Die laat klavierwerke van Arnold van Wyk (1916‚Äì1983), M.Mus. diss., University of Stellenbosch, 2006, p.23 Soon after, he became interested in the compositional techniques of Benjamin Britten, who followed the models of composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Alban Berg, and Gustav Mahler. What attracted Van Wyk most was Britten's ability to compose music that reflected the ideas of social commentary. Another factors in van Wyk's compositional development was his intense love and interest in literature and poetry. Since creating 'beautiful things' was of primary concern for him, he often included several poems or artistic expressions in his compositions of prominent figures such as N.P. van Wyk Louw and W.E.G. Louw.M.J. Thom, \\"Die laat klavierwerke van Arnold van Wyk (1916‚Äì1983), M.Mus. diss., University of Stellenbosch, 2006, p.24 He often used poetry and literature as point of departure for the establishment of compositional titles: Vier Weemoedige Liedjies, Van Liefde en Verlatenheid, and Vyf Elegie√´ vir Strykkwartet. The texts that Van Wyk selected for his compositions often represented nostalgic sentiments, frequently the expressions of pessimism, or the indication of isolation.M.J. Thom, \\"Die laat klavierwerke van Arnold van Wyk (1916‚Äì1983), M.Mus. diss., University of Stellenbosch, 2006, p.25 Legacy Van Wyk's music is rarely performed in the post-apartheid South African environment. After his death in 1983, several scholars published tributes to commend the composer for his contribution to South African art music. Some of these tributes emphasised how Van Wyk's compositions reflected the ideology of Afrikaner nationalism. Other, analytical commentaries, place his works in context in the compositional development of the composer. There has been little attempt to place the works within a greater context of compositional development in a specifically South African context, due largely to an individual style that is not easily categorised. In a tribute to Van Wyk after his death, South African musicologist Jacques Pierre Malan wrote that the creation of a South African abstract art music \\"was the work of one man, the prophet of South African music, Arnold van Wyk. He was our first sovereign sound-master, the first one to draw attention abroad as a creative artist, the first to create locally, between all the foreign masters, the possibility of establishing an own music of the highest quality, the first to make musical achievements count as much as all the other achievements‚Äîto name just a few of the 'firsts'.\\"Grove, 1984, p. 10 In 2014, South African musicologist Stephanus Muller published \\"Nagmusiek\\", which provides both scholarly analyses and fictionalised interpretations of the life and works of Arnold van Wyk. Muller received the \\"UJ Prize for a Debut Novel\\" in 2015 for his publication. Van Wyk's music has gained popularity in recent years throughout Cape Town and has been performed by local composer and musician, Liam Pitcher. Stellenbosch University musicology department added a South African music course to the curriculum in 2017 which studies works from Van Wyk, Hendrik Hofmeyr, William Henry Bell, Jeanne Zaidel-Rudolph, and Andile Khumalo.

Minor dialects are in various localities across the Development Areas. A significant number of Higgis people live in other parts of Nigeria and beyond (diaspora). In cosmopolitan cities and towns in Michika Local Government Area, Higgis people live with members of other tribes. The Higgi tribe has faced a lot of controversies after some elders from the Nkafa dialect predominantly EYN christians, decided to opt for a new name 'Kamwe'. The new name 'Kamwe' means mountain dweller or people from the mountains. This name has, since its inception been rejected by majority of the people in Michika as it is of Nkafa origin and can lead to marginalization of other 23 dialects of the Higgi tribe. Other dialects like Dakwa will translate 'mountain dwellers' as A'ghumo and it is same with the remaining dialects. Apart from this reason, the muslim community in Michika also rejected this modified name 'Kamwe' as it might sideline and marginalize the Muslims in Michika.

Its purpose is the promotion, dissemination, preservation and protection of the works of Alberto Giacometti. It is headquartered in Paris, and is headed by Catherine Grenier, Chief Heritage Curator, of the French Ministry of Culture. It has since June 2018, a space for the exhibition and research of the work of the sculptor, the Giacometti Institute. The Foundation holds the world's largest collection of Giacometti's works: 95 paintings, 260 bronze sculptures, 550 plaster sculptures, and thousands of drawings and engravings. The Foundation also holds a large archive giving background to the artist's creations: numerous notebooks and sketchbooks, manuscripts for published texts, correspondence with other artists and intellectuals, as well as a large part of his private library, including reviews, books, exhibition catalogues, and newspapers, some of which have his annotations or drawings. It aims at establishing a comprehensive catalogue of the artist's works from the records started by his widow. It also organises exhibitions of works from its collection, and provides short and long-term loans to major museums and cultural institutions. The premises housing the collection are not open to the general public, however the entire collection is progressively being made available online.  History  The Foundation is the sole beneficiary of the legacy of Annette Giacometti, his widow, deceased in 1993. Mrs. Giacometti appointed Roland Dumas, a lawyer and former French foreign minister, to be her executor. By the time Annette Giacometti died, the French Government had not yet approved creation of the foundation. In 1994, reportedly to cover the cost of storage, insurance and legal fees, Dumas put 18 Giacometti works up for sale through the French auctioneer Jacques Tajan, raising the equivalent of some $8 million.Alan Riding (September 24, 2002), For Sale (Maybe): Giacometti's Legacy; A Proposed Auction Draws Fire in Paris New York Times. In 2000 Mrs. Giacometti's brother, Michael Arm, asked a Paris court to annul his sister's will, prepared in January 1990, arguing that she was mentally incompetent at the time. In May 2007, Dumas received a 12-month jail sentence (suspended) for funds he mis-appropriated acting as executor of the will of Annette Giacometti.  Administration and implementation  The Foundation is administered by a nine-member board, including two French Government representatives (statutory members: the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Culture and Communication and a member of the Fondation Alberto Giacometti at Z√ºrich (Alberto Giacometti-Stiftung).  Mission  The Foundation has a mission to protect, disseminate and promote Giacommetti's works. Its activities include: * Public display of works: Holding a collection of over 5,000 works, the Foundation participates in many cultural activities, lectures, themed exhibitions, and conferences in cultural institutions around the world. It is involved in the publication, reproduction and editing of Alberto Giacometti's work. * Conservation of the Alberto et Annette Giacometti archives * Cataloguing the works * Awards and scholarships * Protection of the works both in France and abroad: For this purpose, it monitors related publications, exhibitions and sales, and the sale of counterfeit works, attempting to remove them from the market and pursue the counterfeiters. It grants permission to display, edit and publish Giacometti's works. The foundation, in conjunction with members of Giacometti's family, has the right to produce new sculptures from the original plaster casts, completing the editions he began. Under French law, an artist or his heirs have the right to cast no more than 12 sculptures that are to be considered authentic.

In a career which lasted from 1922 to 1924 he ran twelve times and won six races. His most significant victory came as a three-year-old in 1924 when he won The Derby by six lengths in some of the most difficult conditions in the race's history. He went on to have a modestly successful career at stud. Background Sansovino, a big, powerful bay horse, was one of sixteen Classic winners bred by his owner Lord Derby, who named the colt after the sixteenth-century Italian architect Jacopo Sansovino. Sansovino's sire, Swynford, who was also owned by Lord Derby, was an excellent racehorse who won the St Leger in 1910 and went on to be a Champion sire in 1923. Apart from Sansovino, he sired the dual classic-winning fillies Saucy Sue (1000 Guineas, Oaks) and Tranquil (Oaks, St Leger) and the three-time Champion sire Blandford. Sansovino's dam Gondolette has been described as ‚Äúone of the most famous mares in the Stud Book‚Äù. She was the dam of Sansovino's full sister Ferry (1000 Guineas) and the direct, female-line ancestor of such notable thoroughbreds as Hyperion, Sickle, Pharamond, Big Game and Snow Knight. Sansovino was trained throughout his career by Lord Derby's private trainer George Lambton at the Stanley House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1923: two-year-old season= Sansovino was sent to Goodwood in July for his first racecourse appearance and won the six furlong Ham Produce Stakes by a length from Cleone in a time of 1:15.2. A month later, he was moved up in class for the Gimcrack Stakes, again over six furlongs at York. Sansovino won comfortably, beating Dandelion by three quarters of a length but did not run again that season. =1924: three-year-old season= Sansovino made his three-year-old debut at Birmingham Racecourse (a venue which closed in 1965), starting at odds of 1/5 against moderate opposition. He was not impressive in narrowly defeating a horse named Rugeley, but the form was boosted to an extent when the runner-up won the Chester Cup in May. Sansovino's next start was in the Newmarket Stakes a recognised trial race for The Derby. He finished only third but did little wrong in being beaten a head and a neck by the top-class colts Hurstwood and Salmon-Trout after being unsuited by the slow pace and having been badly hampered in the closing stages. Sansovino's position as a major contender for the Derby was not, however, established on the public racecourse but in a private trial on the Newmarket training gallops. He was matched against his older stable companions Tranquil and Pharos and won by six lengths, despite receiving only three pounds in weight. The official weight-for-age scale suggests that a three- year-old should be receiving around fifteen pounds from a four-year-old at this point in the season, so the performance was extremely impressive. Indeed, according to one story, one of the riders of the beaten horses rushed home, pawned his wife's jewellery, and wagered the money raised on Sansovino for the Derby before the bookmakers learned of the outcome of the trial. The Derby of 1924 was run in some of the worst conditions ever seen at Epsom, although the race still attracted a huge crowd, including the King and Queen. Two of the races on the card were abandoned as persistent heavy rain reduced much of the course to mud. Hundreds of cars and buses were stranded on the course as they sank into the \\"sodden turf\\". Sansovino was regarded as a certain stayer and started favourite at 9/2, although, as Lord Derby pointed out in reference to the conditions he had \\"no practice at swimming.\\" The weather had an undoubted influence on the running of the race: the rain-soaked starting tapes broke twice, leading to two false starts and several horses were hampered when one runner slipped and fell at Tattenham corner. Ridden by the twenty-one-year-old lightweight, Tommy Weston, Sansovino started slowly but was soon prominent as Dawson City set the pace. He was in the lead at half way and already clear turning for home. In the straight he pulled steadily further away from the field to win by six lengths from St Germans, with Hurstwood a neck away in third. The winning time of 2:46.00 was the slowest since the 2:47.0 recorded by Jeddah in 1898. The victory was enthusiastically received, with Lord Derby, whose ancestor had given his name to the race, becoming the first member of his family to own the winner since the 12th Earl in 1787. After the race Lambton claimed that he had \\"felt confident for months that Sansovino would win\\" and that he had achieved his life's ambition. The race was also responsible for a small but famous alteration to Lord Derby's racing colours. Weston accidentally buttoned his white scarf through his black outer jacket. The resulting \\"white button\\" was preserved in all subsequent editions of the colours seen most recently being carried by the Breeders' Cup winner Ouija Board. Two weeks after the Derby, Sansovino was sent to Royal Ascot where he won the Prince of Wales's Stakes, beating St Germans \\"in good style\\". Later in the same week he ran in the Hardwicke Stakes but finished unplaced behind the four-year-old Chosroes. The colt was prepared for the St Leger but contracted a respiratory infection that spread among British racehorses in the autumn which left him coughing and disrupted his training. Lambton wanted to rest Sansovino, but Lord Derby insisted that he should run in the St Leger as the colt had already been heavily wagered on for the race by members of the public (Lord Derby himself never gambled). Sansovino was unable to reproduce his mid- season form and finished unplaced behind Salmon-Trout, although The Times, pointing out that he looked well short of peak condition, felt that he was \\"not disgraced\\". =1925: four-year-old season= Sansovino's four-year-old season began promisingly as he beat the 2000 Guineas winner Diophon over a mile in the Spring Stakes at Lingfield but in his remaining races, he was disappointing. He returned to Epsom for his next two starts, finishing unplaced in the City and Suburban Handicap and then running six lengths second to St Germans in the Coronation Cup. On his final start he was injured when finishing unplaced in the Jockey Club Cup at Newmarket. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sansovino as an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù Derby winner. At the end of his three-year-old campaign one correspondent offered the view that Sansovino was \\"only a fair performer\\" who had emerged in a year with no outstanding horses. The Sansovino Handicap was run in the horse's honour at Belmont Park in the 1930s. Stud career As a sire Sansovino was described as ‚Äúa disappointment, but still useful.‚Äù. His most important offspring were Sandwich who won the St Leger in 1931 and the filly Sansonnet, a champion two-year-old who became the dam of Tudor Minstrel. Sansovino died in October 1940.

Typically, the falconer will drive around in a car, seeking suitable small game in the immediate vicinity of the road. Once an appropriate target has been selected, the raptor is then slipped from the window of the moving vehicle as it passes by in order that it might engage with its prey. Car hawking provides an advantage over more traditional methods of falconry in that the hawk is already moving at a considerable speed, with added momentum upon exiting the vehicle and as the car acts as cover, it has an enormous element of surprise over the quarry, giving it little or no time to react and potentially escape. Numerous videos exist on the internet of people successfully utilizing this method, flying Harris hawks and goshawks against feral pigeons and corvids in both urban and rural areas. Legality of this practice varies by location and protected status of the quarry and some falconers consider car hawking to be extremely unsporting.

It's also the first promotional single taken from the duo's debut album, You Once Told Me. Overview The song made its debut on YouTube with the premi√®re of its official music video, posted by Black Hole on June 1, 2011. The single followed on June 6, 2011, as two exclusive digital releases: a five track remix EP on Beatport, and a three track single on iTunes, featuring the album version of the song. A follow-up remix EP with additional remixes was released on June 13, 2011. Prior to its release, \\"Promises\\" received promotional support from a selected crew of DJs, being featured in live sets, podcasts and radio shows in the form of various remixes. Particularly \\"M√øon and Shane 54's Summer of Love Mix\\" was well received, gaining the status Future Favourite on Armin van Buuren's radio show \\"A state of Trance\\" ‚Äì ultimately making it to \\"A State of Trance Radio Top 20 of 2011\\", ranking 11th. The remix also peaked at the number one position on Beatport's Trance chart for over six weeks, while \\"Gabriel & Dresden Remix\\" reached number three. The latter remix was also selected as Record of the Week for Above & Beyond's radio show \\"Trance Around the World\\", episode #372. Both remixes were eventually posted on YouTube by Black Hole, including \\"Nitrous Oxide Remix\\", while \\"Marco V Remix\\" was added shortly after the premi√®re of the official music video. On February 1, 2012, \\"Promises\\" was announced to be one of Black Hole's nominations for the International Dance Music Awards 2012. The song was nominated for Best Chillout/Lounge Track and Best Trance Track; although, no specific remix was noted for the latter category. Music video The music video was directed and produced by Wylie Maercklein and shot in Bolinas, CA. Set by a rocky shore, it features Mavie performing the song, in conjunction with scenery of the surrounding landscape. It also features a special instrument built exclusively for the set, which takes the appearance of a piano fused with a phonograph and a music box. While the prominent focus is set on Mavie playing the instrument and singing, the video also features a cameo by Josh, who is seen winding the music box element of the instrument. \\"Everything from Me\\" Before the single was being promoted, an earlier version of the song was released as a remix by Richard Durand. Titled \\"Everything from Me\\", the song made its appearance on Durand's album Wide Awake, released on March 14, 2011. The song has different verses and was intended to be a teaser prior to the release of \\"Promises\\". Notably, some of the remixes still carry an imprint from the earlier version, either by chord progression or the presence of vocal parts that are absent in the final version. Piano version On February 2, 2012, Andain published a video recording of a live performance of \\"Promises\\" on YouTube. The video features Mavie singing and playing an original piano arrangement of the song, with a slight touch of electronic sound processing.

Modern operating systems evolved through various stages, from elementary to the present day complex, highly sensitive systems incorporating many services. After the development of programmable computers (which did not require physical changes to run different programs) but prior to the development of operating systems, sequential instructions were executed on the computer hardware directly using machine language without any system software layer. This approach is termed the \\"bare machine\\" precursor to modern operating systems. Today it is mostly applicable to embedded systems and firmware generally with time-critical latency requirements, while conventional programs are run by a runtime system overlaid on an operating system.  Advantages  For a given application, in most of the cases, a bare-metal implementation will run faster, using less memory and so being more power efficient. This is because operating systems, as any program, needs some execution time and memory space to run and these are no longer needed on bare- metal. For instance, any hardware feature including inputs and outputs are directly accessible on bare-metal while using an OS imply generally the call to a subroutine, consuming running time and memory. https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2248487.2151020  Disadvantages  For a given application, bare-metal programming requires more effort to work properly and is more complex because the services provided by the operating system and used by the application have to be re-implemented regarding the needs. These services can be: * System startup / boot (mandatory). * Memory management: Storing location of the code and the data regarding the hardware resources and peripherals (mandatory). * Interruptions handling (if any). * Task scheduling, if the application can perform more than one task. * Peripherals management (if any). * Errors / faults management, if wanted and / or needed. Debugging a bare-metal program is difficult since: * There are no software error notifications nor faults management, unless they have been implemented and validated. * There is no standard output, unless it has been implemented and validated. * The machine where the program is written cannot be the same where the program is executed, so the target hardware is either an emulator / simulator or an external device. This forces to setup a way to load the bare-metal program onto the target (flashing), start the program execution and access the target resources. Bare-metal programming is generally done using a close-to-hardware language, such as C++,https://arobenko.gitbooks.io/bare_metal_cpp/content/ C or assembly language, which are generally thought to be harder to master.Need academic citation All the previous issues inevitably mean that bare-metal programs are very rarely portable.  Examples  = Early Computers = Early computers, such as the PDP-11 allowed programmers to load a program, supplied in machine code, to RAM. The resulting operation of the program could be monitored by lights, and output derived from magnetic tape, print devices, or storage. = Embedded systems = Bare machine programming remains common practice in embedded systems, where microcontrollers or microprocessors often boot directly into monolithic, single-purpose software, without loading a separate operating system. Such embedded software can vary in structure, but the simplest form may consist of an infinite main loop, calling subroutines responsible for checking for inputs, performing actions, and writing outputs.  Development  The approach of using bare machines paved the way for new ideas which accelerated the evolution of operating system development. This approach highlighted a need for the following: *Input/output (I/O) devices to enter both code and data conveniently: ** Input devices, such as keyboards, were created. These were necessary, as earlier computers often had unique, obtuse, and convoluted input devices. :: For example, programs were loaded into the PDP-11 by hand, using a series of toggle switches on the front panel of the device. Keyboards are far superior to these vintage input devices, as it would be much faster to type code or data than to use toggle switches to input this into the machine. Keyboards would later become standard across almost every computer, regardless of brand or price. ** Output devices such as computer monitors would later be widely used, and still are to this day. They proved themselves to be a huge convenience over earlier output devices, such as an array of lights on the Altair 8800, which would indicate the status of the computer. :: Computer monitors can also easily display the output of a program in a user friendly manner. For example, one would have to be intimately knowledgeable about a specific early computer and its display system, consisting of an array of lights, to even begin to make sense of the status of the computer's hardware. In contrast, anybody who can read should be able to understand a well-designed user interface on a modern system, without having to know anything about the hardware of the computer on which the program is being run. * Faster, cheaper, more widely available secondary storage devices to store programs to non-volatile memory. This was needed, as it was cumbersome to have to type code in by hand in order to use the computer in a useful way, which would be lost upon every reboot due to the system saving it to volatile memory. * The requirement for a convenient high-level language and a translator for such a high-level language to the corresponding machine code. * Linkers to link library modules, which may be written by the user or already available on the system. * Loaders to load executables into RAM from the secondary storage. * Suitable I/O devices, such as printers for producing a hard copy of the output generated by programs.

It was first published in Nos.4-7, 1872 issues of The Russian Messenger magazine and formed a trilogy with Old Years in Plodomasovo (1869) and A Decayed Family (1874). Background Leskov started working on his \\"romantic chronicles\\" in January 1866. In 1867, Book 1 appeared in issues 6‚Äì8 (March‚ÄìApril) of Otechestvennye Zapiski under the original title of Waiting for the Moving of the Water. The Romantic Chronicles (–ß–∞—é—â–∏–µ –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤–æ–¥—ã. –†–æ–º–∞–Ω—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–∫–∞).From the Gospel of John: \\"In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. (V, 4) For an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole, with whatsoever disease he was holden. (V, 5) The publication was stopped after a row between Leskov and Andrey Krayevsky over the cuts that had been made. Then Literaturnaya Biblioteka started publishing the novel from the beginning, in its first two issues of 1868 (as Dwellers in God's House. Chapters from the Unfinished Novel), but then stopped. Only in 1872 did The Russian Messenger publish the full text of a revised version of the novel as The Cathedral Clergy. In its original version (the one published in Otechestvennye Zapiski), the novel dealt more with the life of Stargorod in general, focusing on its starovery community, but also describing in detail the ordinary, non-religious people's spiritual leanings. Book I looked more like background for the story of Savely Tuberozov, the novel's main character. In the Russian Messenger version, most of the side plots, which had little to do with protopope Tuberozov and his colleagues, have been cut. Konstantin Pizonsky and Platonida, who featured prominently in the chronicles, disappeared from the latter version and resurfaced as the main characters of the short story \\"Kotin the He-Cow and Platonida,\\" which was included into the collection Novelets and Short Stories by M. Stebnitsky (Vol.1, 1867).Bukhstab, B. Commentaries. The Works by N.S. Leskov in 6 volumes. Pravda Publishers. Moscow. 1973. Vol.2. P. 388. Synopsis Priest Savely Tuberozov is a spiritual leader of a small Russian Orthodox community (sobor) in a provincial town of Stargorod. He firmly believes in his spiritual and social mission, and, unwilling to make compromises, comes into conflict with his church seniors, as well as the local authorities. The latter expect him to \\"eradicate raskol\\" (schism), and report on dissenters. He refuses to comply and condemns the destruction of the Old Believers' church as barbarism. As the Governor comes to town, Tuberozov makes the speech, accusing the local masters of exploiting peasants and abusing the local rural areas. The Governor doesn't want to listen, and protopope Tuberozov, reprimanded for such an audacity, gets demoted in ranks. He summons the local officials to a moleben and preaches a sermon which sounds more like a political speech, promising dire things to leaders who treat their people as animals. Tuberozov gets fired, goes through numerous humiliations, falls ill and dies.Bukhstab, pp. 14‚Äî15 English translations *The Cathedral Folk, translated by Isabel F.

Exorphins include opioid food peptides like Gluten exorphin and microbial opioid peptides and any other opioid peptide foreign to a host that have metabolic efficacy for that host.  Connection and Treatment of Autism  Due to the low treat-ability of Autism, experiments were carried out to determine if consumption of various Exorphin enzymes can improve the symptoms of the disease. According to the Exorphin theory, generally an increase in level of Exorphin is linked to symptoms of autism. Therefore, there are Autism therapy that aims to treat the symptoms by removing Exorphin from the system. One way this was done through digesting large amount of peptidase. Another possibility is to allow the promotion of one's own stomachs acid to digest Exorphin. The reason for this approach is because it was deemed near impossible to avoid Exorphin in one's system due to dietary consumption. Several other techniques in treating Autism are also based around promoting the digestion of Exorphin to prevent its absorption.  Connection with Schizophrenia  Exorphin can cause various symptoms of Schizophrenia if mutation occurs at a few selected loci. Genetic mutation at one of these loci can lead to increased absorption of Exorphin via receptor mediated endocytosis. Another possibility from these particular loci is that catabolization of Exorphin can be disrupted thus allowing Exorphin to persist in the body. This would lead to Exorphin entering the brain capillary, bypassing the blood brain barrier, and inflicting negative repercussion onto the brain. This does not mean that Exorphin will necessarily cause Schizophrenia as susceptibility to the disease is dependent on an individual's genetic makeup. However, by increasing the probability that Exorphin enters the brain, it will also increase the chance of an individual displaying Schizophrenic symptoms.

SCiP is an organization of researchers interested in applications of computational techniques and methods in psychology. One focus over the past several years has been on aiding psychologists in using computers in their teaching and research, statistical analysis tools, web-based research, clinical applications, and computational modelling. The Society has also encouraged consideration of psychological aspects of hardware and software development and design. Membership is open to any person who has an academic degree and who is active in scientific applications of computers to psychological research.  History  The society's founding was initiated by Donald Tepas who asked for support from the National Science Foundation's Office of Computing Activities. Tepas wanted help with the development of intereactive system for searches. Instead, the NSF suggested that a conference be arranged and its proceedings published, which was indeed done.Special Issue of the journal Behavior Research Methods & Instruments (BRMI)Castellan, (JR.), N.

Following a list of Secretary‚ÄìTreasurers, a list of all SCiP Presidents is provided in Table 1. Next I present personal highlights, including the first symposium on psychology and the World-Wide Web; David Rumelhart‚Äôs mathematical explanation of connectionism; and Stevan Harnad‚Äôs discussion of ‚Äúfreeing‚Äù the journal literature. I observe that a small conference is becoming more intimate and that much of our mission involves figuring out how to conduct high-quality scientific research with consumer-grade electronics. I argue that we are an increasingly international organization, that graduate students are welcome, and that we should become more inclusive in the areas of gender and ethnicity and should make membership more meaningful. I conclude by looking ahead and attempting to predict the future. Computers and technology in psychology can be a cornucopia or a Pandora‚Äôs box. During the 20 years of its existence, the Society for Computers in Psychology has been an important focus for the appropriate and beneficial application of computing technology in psychology. Although the increase of computer use is unmistakable, cyclic trends in computer applications also can be identified and, together with current technological developments, lead to predictions, concerns, and challenges for the future. (Castellan, 1991) As we enter the next decade, I believe it is important that the Society for Computers in Psychology (S.C.I.P.) develop a little sense of history. So I would like to cover some years of the organization‚Äôs development and, in the process, cite several highlights that are worthy of note... (Sidowski, 1990)  Mission Statement  The Society for Computers in Psychology is a non-profit organization of researchers interested in applications of computers in psychology. Its primary purpose is to \\"increase and diffuse knowledge of the use of computers in psychological research.\\" Over the past several years the organization has focused on many important issues in psychology, such as computational models of cognitive processes and behavior, computational tools for data collection and analysis, human-computer interaction, knowledge representation in both humans and machines, machine learning, methods and tools for Internet-based research, and technology in the service of improving and evaluating outcomes. We have also encouraged a consideration of cognitively-inspired design of computational technologies and models. Membership is open to any person who has an academic degree and who is active in scientific applications of computers to psychological research. Please see our bylaws for operating of the society. We do not make payments to beneficiaries, with the exception of Honorariums to keynote speakers, student research awards, and yearly dues to Federation of Associations in Behavioral and Brain Sciences. We do not collect on the behalf of other charities. Our primary expenditure is hosting a conference once a year to bring together academic researchers in the areas of cognition, computation, education, research methodology, neuroscience, and related sciences.  Annual meeting  The Society holds an annual meeting with talks and posters attended by psychologists from around the world. The meeting precedes the Annual meeting of the Psychonomic Society. The 2017 conference will ake place Nov. 9th in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

One of the marches to the Port of Oakland on Nov. 2, 2011 While most of the day-time activities were peaceful, Oakland Police chief Howard Jordan reported that a small group of \\"anarchists\\" vandalized a Whole Foods storefront, and broke windows and ATMs of Bank of America and Wells Fargo banks in the afternoon. Many buildings were vandalized, including some businesses that displayed signs of support for the protest. After the incidents of vandalism, members of Occupy Oakland guarded local businesses, boarded up broken windows, and cleaned graffiti caused by the small group of protesters utilizing black bloc tactics. Oakland mayor Jeakn Quan described these protesters as \\"a small and isolated group\\" that \\"shouldn't mar the overall impact of the demonstration and the fact that people in the 99 percent movement demonstrated peacefully and, for the most part, were productive and very peaceful.\\"A banner hung in downtown Oakland during a bank march =March to the Port of Oakland= Thousands of protesters marched from Frank Ogawa Plaza to the Port of Oakland, the fifth busiest port in the United States, in two separate groups leaving the plaza at 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm. The number of protesters marching to the port has not been confirmed. While police estimate 7,000 people marched, local organizers and participants put the number somewhere between 20,000 and 100,000. As protesters completely filled Middle Harbor Road, the main road leading to the port, all truck traffic entering or exiting the port was halted. Port operations were \\"effectively shut down\\" a couple hours later. The Port of Oakland reportedly lost $4 million as a result of the strike. Protesters injured by car During the evening march to the port, the driver of a silver Mercedes-Benz was headed south on 11th Street when he encountered a stream of protesters walking along Broadway. Cell phone videofootage shows the driver of the Mercedes attempting to drive through the intersection honking at a protester to move, Lance Laverdure, who then responded by stopping in front of the Mercedes and began hitting it on the hood. The driver, Jan Dylan Carrigg, hit the gas and both Laverdure and a nearby protester, Margaret So, were hit by the car and sustained leg and ankle injuries. Nearby witnesses then surrounded the car as emergency personnel attended to the protesters. During this time, the driver switched seats with the passenger, Sara Abu-Nasser, but switched back before police arrived. Carrigg was questioned by BART police and released, angering witnesses who called for Carrigg's arrest. The two protesters suffered leg and ankle injuries and were taken to Highland Hospital. On November 11, the two victims held a press conference alleging that the incident was a criminal act and questioned why the Oakland Police Department had not prosecuted Carrigg. Victims said that nine days after the incident, they still had not been contacted by police. Lance Laverdure told press that, \\"We want this person arrested for the attempted murder of myself and Margaret\\". Night of November 2 =Occupation of vacant building= Later in the evening, a group of protesters took over a vacant building that once served as the headquarters of the Traveler's Aid Society, a non-profit organization that provided services to the local homeless population. Police soon arrived to break up the protesters gathered outside of the building. Some protesters fled while others set a barricade on fire. Just after midnight, police ordered the crowd to disperse for unlawful assembly. Soon, one officer on Broadway was struck on his face shield by a bottle, disorienting him. Within a minute, officers launched flash-bang grenades and tear-gas canisters, beginning a series of late-night clashes between the demonstrators and police. =Incidents of alleged police misconduct= Scott Campbell shooting Shortly before 1 am, Scott Campbell was shot by police using a less-lethal round while he was filming a stationary line of police in riot gear. The apparently unprovoked shooting was documented by the resulting point-of-view video from Campbell's own camera. University of South Carolina criminal justice professor Geoffrey Alpert said that unless something occurred off-camera to provoke the officer, the shooting was \\"one of the most outrageous uses of a firearm\\" he'd ever seen. \\"Unless there's a threat that you can't see in the video, that just looks like absolute punishment, which is the worst type of excessive force,\\" Alpert told the Oakland Tribune. Kayvan Sabeghi beating On the evening of November 2, Kayvan Sabeghi was hit numerous times by a police officer with a baton then arrested. Sabeghi was charged with resisting arrest and remaining at the scene of a riot. While in police custody, Sabeghi complained of severe pain and asked for medical treatment. Eighteen hours after his arrest, he was transferred to Highland Hospital, where he was treated in the intensive care unit for a lacerated spleen. Susie Cagle arrest and jailing Although she was wearing a press pass, journalist Susie Cagle was arrested in the early hours of November 3 and spent 14 hours at 2 different jails. She was charged with failure to leave the scene of a riot. Journalists' rights in the United States are constitutionally protected through the First Amendment. Cagle is one of several journalists covering the Occupy movement that have been arrested. Additionally, Cagle reported having been subject to and witness to mistreatment of protestors during her imprisonment.

Founded in 1910, Incarnation is dedicated to providing the foundation for its students to develop into successful business and community leaders. On June 4, 2011, Incarnation opened its doors yet again to welcome over 200 of its alumni home for its Centennial Celebration. The event was successful, raising just under $30,000 for curriculum enhancements. The event began with a Centennial Mass celebrated by Archbishop Timothy Dolan, after which Dolan joined alumni and friends of the school at a reception featuring student vocal and ballroom dance performances, a silent auction and raffles. Current Incarnation students volunteered as tour guides and mingled and shared stories with the alumni. Alumni from graduating classes ranging from 1948 to 1999 had a chance to catch up with each other, meet their predecessors and successors, and check out their old classrooms. One alum commented, ‚ÄúWhat a nice job everybody did. The kids were great, they were all so well behaved, so polite. It was really a nice time.‚Äù History In 1908 the Rev. Patrick J. Mahoney was assigned to establish a parish in Washington Heights to relieve overcrowding at St. Elizabeth's and St. Rose Of Lima Parishes. The new parish was christened Incarnation. To meet the new challenge, Father Mahoney rented a store at 1253 St. Nicholas Avenue between 172nd and 173rd Street and used it as a temporary chapel with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass being offered there for the first time on Sunday, September 6, 1908. On November 1, 1908 he relocated his temporary chapel to the corner of St. Nicholas Avenue and 171st Street. By the end of the year, Incarnation had purchased eight lots at the corner of St. Nicholas Avenue and 175th Street for $78,000. The first step of establishing the center of the Parish, the altar about which all parish activity would revolve, had been accomplished. Three months after the opening of the chapel, Father Mahoney instituted a regular Sunday School program, with a priest, two Sisters of Charity and a number of lay teachers, to respond to the challenge of providing religious instructions for the children. His next task was to organize the Senior and Junior Holy Name Societies, the Children of Mary, the Sacred Heart Society, two young people's clubs, the Incarnation Lyceum for young men, and a Young Women's Club. To assist Father Mahoney in carrying out his emerging program, the Reverend Walter D. Slattery was assigned priest of Incarnation. In the following year, 1909, an additional priest, Reverend Alexander McCarthy, was appointed to the Parish. Father Mahoney, well aware that the neighborhood continued to grow rapidly, determined that a complete school should be built. Archbishop Farley laid the cornerstone for the new school on October 17, 1909 with Monsignor Michael J. Lavelle, Vicar General as preacher. Father Mahoney relocated the chapel to the newly constructed school auditorium and on February 6, 1910 the first Mass in the new chapel was offered. Incarnation School opened on September 12, 1910 with two Sisters of Charity from Mount Saint Vincent, Sister M. Auxilium, Principal and Second Grade Teacher, and Sister Mercedes, First Grade Teacher, comprising its staff. The school enrolled 103 children in its first year of operation, but this number quickly grew, almost doubling by 1912. Attendant upon the opening of the school was the founding of the Saint Aloysius Society for Boys and the Angels Society for Girls under the direction of Sister Auxilium. The school in 2014 As enrollment rose, so did the associated challenge of providing a convent for the larger staff of teaching Sisters that would soon be necessary. In the school's first years, the Sisters lived at Saint Paul's Convent in Harlem and commuted to Washington Heights everyday. However, on October 15, 1915 Incarnation alleviated the Sisters burden by establishing the school's first convent located at 515 West 173rd Street. The first Graduation Exercise was held on June 29, 1916. Incarnation School had established a firm and enduring place in the Washington Heights Community. In 1918 Incarnation Parish eclipsed 3,000 parishioners. An ever-swelling student body resulted in the school adding two additional floors, which were completed in 1925. As the school expanded to better serve the larger student body, the church, which had been holding mass in the school auditorium since 1910, also began feeling the strain its parishioners were putting on the small auditorium. The parishioners recognized a need for increased space and a more dignified atmosphere for religious services. Under the guidance of Monsignor Delaney, funds were raised for a new church and on October 28, 1928 the corner stone for the new church was laid. The church was opened and dedicated by Patrick Cardinal Hayes on June 1, 1930. By 1937 the parish had over 10,000 parishioners, 7,000 more than twenty years before. Three-quarters were of Irish ancestry. Approximately 1,400 students attended Incarnation School in 1937. The additional two floors added to the building ten years prior was not enough to alleviate classroom overcrowding and the stress of teachers trying to educate classes crammed with students. The school introduced a triple session thus allowing an 800 pupil school to accommodate 1,400 children. An increase in classes required a proportionate increase in staff and the old convent had already been over- crowded for some years. Monsignor Delaney knew that Incarnation must build again. He initiated a fundraising drive to realize the funds for a new convent. Property was purchased, construction began and the new convent was ready for occupancy in October 1940. Hundreds of young men and women from Incarnation School served in World War II. The school participated in the war- time drives of collecting tin goods, fabric, and other items. By 1945 1,600 children were registered in the school. Monsignor Casey, in an effort to tackle the problems facing adolescent boys, invited the Christian Brothers to instruct the boys in the school's upper grades. To house the Brothers Monsignor Casey became a builder like his predecessors. He acquired two houses on 173rd Street and united them into one residence. The Brothers visible and effective influence was exercised throughout the school day and well into the night with daily and wide-ranging athletic programs. With the addition of the Brothers, Casey never relegated to Sisters any position of lesser importance. Casey was appointed by the Cardinal as Assistant Vicar for Religious. Always a neighborhood of immigrants, the postwar years saw an increase of Spanish speaking parishioners from Puerto Rico. Economic and political factors led to an influx of Cubans, Dominicans and families from Central and South America as well. Monsignor Waterson accepted the challenge to integrate the newest residents into parish activities and encouraged families to enroll their children in Incarnation School. In the nineteen seventies the school returned to single session. Incarnation experienced an increase in the number of dedicated lay teachers as the Christian Brothers departed. During the 1980s Sister Maureen Dunn, S.C., was leader. School enrollment hovered around 630 students and there were 19 full-time academic classroom teachers. Incarnation offered Gym, Art and Music classes for each grade and students took advantage of a full-time guidance program. Incarnation students participated in many diverse extracurricular activities such as yearbook, newspaper, Altar Boy Society, choral group, cheerleading, spelling bee, foreign mission activities, a school service program, art contest, talent show, author's day, and the production of an Instructional Television program. Incarnation also offered a sports program under the direction of future principal Ted Staniecki. Students in 3rd ‚Äì 8th grade participated in intramural basketball, boys and girls junior and varsity basketball teams, track competitions and baseball teams. In 1996 Incarnation took forty 7th and 8th grade students to Fukuoka, Japan for a 10-day educational excursion, repeated in 1998 and 2002. Incarnation expanded its technological resources with Internet-based lessons, access to laptop computers, educational software, and wireless networking. A science lab was set up.

When a dollar of exogenous grants to a community leads to significantly greater public spending than an equivalent dollar of citizen income: money sticks where it hits, like a fly to flypaper. Grants to the government will stay in the hands of the government and income to individuals will stay with these individuals. Founding The concept was first described in a metaphorical way by Arthur Okun in response to the research of his colleague Edward Gramlich, which was published in 1979 as The Stimulative Effects of Intergovernmental Grants. Gramlich, together with Courant and Rubinfeld, sought an explanation for the phenomenon that nonmatching grants stimulate much more local spending per dollar of grant than does income going to private citizens within the community. The flypaper effect in this paper is defined as: \\"bureaucrats and politicians find it easier to avoid cutting taxes when the government receives revenue-sharing monies than they do to raise taxes when some exogenous event raises the income of the community.\\" In this case, the finding was that a grant from federal government to local government would raise spending of that local government by a greater amount than an equivalent increase in local income. Local public resources come from both fiscal transfers from the central government in the form of grants and from the income of individuals. Henderson and Gramlich specified the demand equations of individuals by maximizing their utility subject to that individual's income constraint, which is specified as the sum of personal income and the individual's share of his government's unconstrained fiscal transfers. This specification would mean that the individual income and the individual's share of the fiscal transfers would have an identical impact on spending. The Flypaper effect however suggests that this is not the case. This can be described as an anomaly since it is difficult to rationalize: one would expect that a government grant and an equivalent increase in local income to have the same effect. Explanation A common explanation of the flypaper effect has a focus on the role of public officials. It was first argued by Niskanen that public officials tend to maximize their budgets by the budget- maximizing model. As public officials are budget maximizers, the bureaucrats have no incentive to inform citizens about the true level of grant funding that a community receives. If public officials conceal this information, they may trick citizens into voting for a higher level of funding than would have otherwise been the case. In this respect, the flypaper effect occurs because citizens are unaware of the true budget constraint. Other explanations offered are that it could be a data-problem or an econometric problem. It is possible that matching grants have been noted as non-matching grants in statistical data or that there is some omitted variable bias present. Empirical evidence Ever since the flypaper effect was first suggested multiple researchers have tried to establish empirical evidence for the phenomenon. Most studies find that indeed that a dollar received by the community in the form of a grant results in greater public spending than a dollar increase in community income. The original research performed by Courant, Gramlich and Rubinfeld was the first study to find an empirical result that would support the flypaper effect. Later research found that not all non-matching grants are perceived by the community which would therefore support the flypaper effect. A study by Fafchamps, McKenzie, Quinn and Woodruff (2014) demonstrates the flypaper effect using a randomized trial in Ghana, comparing cash transfers to in-kind transfers.

Considered to be the most popular Tamil lyricist of the 1950s, he is particularly remembered for the philosophy-tinged lyrics he penned for M. G. Ramachandran‚Äôs movies.  Early life  He was born on 14 April 1930 in an agricultural family at Sengapaduthankadu, a village near the town of Pattukkottai. His parents were Arunachalam Pillai and Visalakshi Ammal. Arunachalam Pillai was a Tamil scholar and a folk poet. PKS had an elder brother, Ganapathisundaram, and a sister, Vedhanayaki. PKS never went to school, but had an in-born talent for poetry.  Career  PKS worked for Kuyil, a magazine run by Bharathidasan. His first opportunity to write lyrics for a Tamil movie was for Paditha Penn. However, he achieved success as lyricist even before the release of Paditha Penn (which was released on 20 April 1956) when Maheswari, a film for which he penned five song lyrics, was released ahead on 13 November 1955. The music director for this movie was G. Ramanathan; C. V. Sridhar wrote the script and dialogue. The Kalyanasundaram‚ÄìSridhar combination proved to be successful again with the movie Kalyana Parisu. As detailed by director Sridhar's reminiscences, PKS wrote 8 lyrics for this triangular love plot, all of which were successful. PKS was very active and successful in the Tamil film industry during the years 1954‚Äì1959 and wrote around 250 songs during this period, including several songs for two leading Tamil movie stars of that period ‚Äì MGR and Sivaji Ganesan. List of movies, which feature PKS lyrics for the two actors: MGR: 7 movies; Chakravarthi Thirumagal (1957), Mahadhevi (1957), Nadodi Mannan (1958), Arasilangkumari (1961), Thirudadhe (1961), Vikramaadhithan (1962) and Kalai Arasi (1963). Sivaji Ganesan: 11 movies; Rangoon Radha (1956), Ambikapathi (1957), Pudhaiyal (1957), Makkalai Petra Magarasi (1957), Uthama Puthiran (1958), Padhi Bhakti (1958), Aval Yar ? (1959), Bhaaga Pirivinai (1959), Thanga Padhumai (1959), Irumbu Thirai (1960), Punar Jenmam (1961).  Later life  He married Gowravammal from Athikkottai (a village near Pattukkottai). His mentor Bharathidasan presided over the nuptials on 11 September 1957 at Madras. In 1959, the couple gave birth to their only child, whom they named Kumaravelu. After suffering severe migraine attacks, Kalyanasundaram underwent surgery to his nose in September 1959. A few days after surgery, he died of cereberal haemorrhage on 8 October 1959.

The case dealt with remedies for the breach of a reciprocal contract in cases where the creditor has been prevented from performing fully his obligations by the failure of the other party's necessary co-operation. The court held that the creditor may in such circumstances claim performance, but that his claim will be subject to a reduction by the costs he saves in not having fully to make his counterperformance. The court also discussed the principles applicable to the exceptio non-adimpleti contractus and held that, where there has been incomplete performance by the creditor (in this case the plaintiff), the debtor (defendant) is entitled to claim compensation. Where there has been no resiling, the creditor may institute a claim for a reduced contract price. A court, in the exercise of its discretion, may permit a relaxation of the strict principle of reciprocity where the other party has utilised the partial performance.  Judgment  The court accepted that, when a creditor in a reciprocal contract is prevented from making fully his own counter-performance by the failure of the other party's necessary co-operation, he may, despite his own incomplete performance, claim performance by the other party. This, however, will be subject (basically as also in other legal systems) to reduction of the performance claimed by the costs saved by the creditor in not having to perform fully his own obligation.Du Plessis et al 290. The court considered a few aspects of the principle of reciprocity and its application by means of the exceptio non-adimpleti contractus: # In contracts whereby reciprocal obligations are created, the question of whether the obligations are so closely linked that the principle of reciprocity applies is basically a matter of interpretation. If, however, no other intention appears, the principle applies by operation of law to certain well-known contracts, such as, for example, the contract of sale and locatio conductio operis. # The sequence of performance and counter-performance also depends on the contractual provisions. If, however, another intention does not appear, the contractor, in locatio conductio operis for example, must first perform. # On the ground that withholding the thing sold was regarded already in the Corpus Juris as analogous to the holding of a pledge, one would expect that the exceptio would only apply as a defence until performance was actually made. The right of withholding (the converse of the exceptio) is therefore essentially a means of enforcing the counter-performance. It can fulfil a function similar to retention moneys in a building contract. On the other hand, it follows that, as long as performance remains possible and the contract is not cancelled, the other party can still perform. Indeed, this possibility should be related to the doctrine of mora and purgatio morae. # If the right of withholding is seen as analogous to the holding of a pledge, this would entail that a party's own performance could be withheld until the counter-performance is fully rendered. In the case of locatio conductio operis, it is all the more the case that the contractor must fully perform before he is entitled to the contract price. # According to Voet,19.1.23. the onus is on the plaintiff, when the exceptio is raised against him, to prove that he has in fact performed his side of the contract. Since then, this has apparently never been doubted as far as South African law is concerned. The court found that it was clear from the decisions in Hauman v Nortje,1914 AD 293. Breslin v Hichens1914 AD 312. and Van Rensburg v Straughan1914 AD 317. that the judges had proceeded on the common assumption that, on the ground of general principles, the employer had a right of withholding in regard to his own performance until the contractor had strictly and fully made his counterperformance: \\"a potent weapon to ensure that the contract is specifically performed.\\"Du Plessis et al 295. There was also agreement in the decisions that, on the ground of considerations of fairness, a contractor should sometimes, despite the principle of reciprocity, be permitted still to claim compensation for an incomplete performance. As this could amount to the employer's right to strict compliance being ended, it was extremely important to determine when the employer, by way of exception, is no longer entitled to his right of withholding. In the three cases above, there were to be found at least three points of view, divergent in principle. The point of view of CG Maasdorp JA, in Van Rensburg,331. belongs more to cases in which there has been a resiling, while those in Hauman of Lord De Villiers CJ297. and Innes JA304. apply to cases where there has been no resiling. The court found that the whole basis of the relaxation of the principle of reciprocity and the recognition of the possibility of instituting a claim for a reduced contract price rests on considerations of fairness, and that, clearly, these considerations may in particular circumstances prescribe that the contractor should still be compensated, even if he knows that he has not fully complied with his obligations. As an equitable solution, the point of view of De Villiers was found to be too narrow. It was determined that that of Innes‚Äîthat the court, in the exercise of its discretion, allows a relaxation of the strict principle of reciprocity where the other party has utilised the partial performance‚Äîprovides a far more supple and satisfactory solution. As such, the court held that the latter must henceforth be accepted and applied. The court emphasised that, according to Innes, the coming into being of the discretionary power of relaxing the principle of reciprocity has no connection whatever with the degree of shortcoming of the incomplete performance. The decisive fact for coming into being is the utilisation of the incomplete performance by the employer, be the shortcoming big or small. The extent of the shortcoming is, at the most, one of the circumstances which may be weighed up in considering the question of fairness which is involved in the exercise of the discretion. It would be desirable in the future simply to talk of a contractual claim for a reduced contract price, and to avoid names such as quantum meruit and the language of enrichment liability. It would lead to less confusion and greater clarity, and would also fit in, in the normal case, with the amount whereby the contract price is reduced being equivalent, as De Villiers put it, to \\"such sum as would enable the employer to complete the work in exact accordance with the contract.\\"299. or, as Innes put it, \\"the cost of remedying the defects.\\"305. If the contractor does not succeed in convincing the Court that he has fully complied with his side of the contract, and he wishes then to claim a reduced contract price, he will have to prove # that the employer is utilising the incomplete performance; # that circumstances exist which make it equitable for the court to exercise its discretion in his favour; and # what the reduced contract price should be: that is, what it will cost to bring his performance in order for the purpose of determining by how much the contract price should be reduced. In regard to possible consequential damages caused by the shortcoming already suffered, and possible damages as the result of the mora of the contractor, the onus of proof will, on the grounds of general principles, still rest on the employer. The employer will probably have to institute a counter-claim. The decision in the Transvaal Provincial Division in Scope Precision Engineering (Edms) Bpk v BK Tooling (Edms) Bpk was thus varied.

He attempted to unify Kathmandu Valley by conquering Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, but failed in the effort. He was successful in extending and securing the borders of Kantipur and was responsible for the monopoly over trade with Tibet. The resulting prosperity was responsible for the construction of majority of the buildings around Durbar Square during his reign. His reign is seen as a cultural and economical high point of the Malla dynasty. Pratap Malla, playing a lute, and his queen, seen in the niche above the Hanuman Dhoka Palace gate A statue of Pratap Malla is found standing on a column facing the palace in the square. His image can also be seen in the niche above the Hanuman Dhoka Palace gate. The niche above the gate is Krishna in his ferocious tantric aspect, flanked by more gentle, amorous Krishna surrounded by gopinis, and by King Pratap Malla playing a lute, and his queen. Life He was born to his Maithali origin mother and a Malla origin father Lakshmi Narasinha Malla. Even when his father was alive, Pratap Malla had the experience of administration. He imprisoned his father on the grounds of insanity and sat on the throne in 1641 A.D. He was a very ambitious king.Shrestha, p.36 =Marriage and children= Parthibendra Malla, son of Pratap Malla, ruled Kathmandu from 1680‚Äì1687 CE. Pratap Malla was married to a Maithali lady of Southern Nepal. Some modern historians have given him the reputation for being lewd and maintaining a harem. He is also alleged to have raped a virgin girl, which ultimately resulted in her death. Pratap Malla is said to have repented this act so much so that he wanted to absolve himself of his sins and consulted the wise and learned men on the matter. Acting on their suggestions, he set up hundreds of Lingas at Pashupati and installed a statue of his own with his two queens. He also performed Koti Hom, weighed gold on one scale and himself on the other and gave it away in charity. In order to commemorate the occasion, he also raised a pillar on the southern gate of Pashupati, and established a grazing ground near the area.Shrestha, p.38 Pratap Malla had five sons: Bhupendra Malla, Chakrabartendra, Nripendra, Mahipatendra, and Parthibendra. He wanted his sons to have experience in the administration of the country even during his own lifetime. With this aim in view, he made them rule over the country for one year in turn. But unfortunately, his second son Chakrabartendra Malla died the day after he took over the administration of the country.Shrestha, p.39 =Relation with Lalitpur and Bhaktapur= He often fought with Lalitpur and Bhaktapur to annex them to his kingdom but could not succeed. He tried to play the kings of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur against each other. Sometimes he sided with Bhaktapur and posed a menace to Lalitpur. Sometimes he sided with Lalitpur and fell upon Bhaktapur. His main aim was to annex Lalitpur to Kathmandu. But his aim was not fulfilled as the king of Lalitpur had the king of Gorkha, Ram Shah, as his ally. Moreover, Shree Nivas, son of Siddhi Nara Singha was no less inferior to Pratap Malla in courage and diplomacy. In 1634 A.D., when Siddhi Nara Singha Malla was engaged in performing Koti Hom, Pratap Malla availing himself of the opportunity, made a surprise attack on Patan and conquered some of the places important from the strategic point of view. Dambar Shah, son of Ram Shah had come with a contingent to help Siddhi Nara Singh Malla, but his troops were waylaid and put to rout. Pratap Malla gave a lot of trouble to Narendra Malla, King of Bhaktapur. He made Narendra Malla pay tribute to him in the form of elephants. Later, again he sided with Shree Niwas Malla and laid a siege on Bhaktapur. He plundered Bhaktapur and carried away many valuables. But when Lalitpur sided with Bhaktapur, Pratap Malla signed a treaty with Bhaktapur.Shrestha, p.36-38 =Patronage of art and literature= Kabindrapur built by Pratap Malls. Pratap Malla was a lover of literature. He himself was a poet. He gave himself the title of \\"Kavindra.\\" Kavindra means \\"the King of poets\\". He was tolerant of all religions. He was fond of building temples. He set up an image of Hanuman beside his palace. Since then, the palace is called \\"Hanuman Dhoka\\". Besides this, he built a temple of Krishna with the image of Kala Bhairav in front of Hanuman Dhoka and a temple of Guheshwari. He offered a gold umbrella to Pashupatinath temple. He had great respect for Buddhism. He introduced Seto Machchhindranath Jatra. =Death= Pratap Malla died a sudden death. While he was watching the religious dance of Harisiddhi, he fell down unconscious and died. After ruling for 33 years, he died in 1674. During his reign for thirty-three years (1641 A.D. to 1674 A.D.) there was peace and prosperity at home and no danger from outside. Trade with India and China made Nepal prosperous. Art and literature flourished. Kings of Bhaktapur, Lalitpur and other neighbouring kingdoms did not dare to invade Kantipur. Just as Muslim culture reached its height in the time of Shah Jahan, so did Nepalese culture reached its height in the time of Pratap Malla.Shrestha, p.40 Relations with Tibet Left: Dress of noble women of the Tanguth Kingdom. Center: Dress of women near Cuthi, the capital of the kingdom of Necbal. Right: Dress of the Kingdom of Necbal. From \\"China Illustrata\\". The 16th and 17th centuries were a crucial period in the relations between Nepal and Tibet. By 1600, Tibet was in a state of near chaos as a result of the struggle between competing Buddhist sects and the more basic regional conflict between the two central Tibetan provinces, of which Lhasa and Shigatse are the political centers. The powerful figure of the Fifth Dalai Lama, the head of the Gelugpa (yellow) sect of Tibetan Buddhism, gradually gained control, both spiritual and temporal, over Tibet in the first half of the 17th century, with the valuable assistance of the Khoshote Mongols.Rose, p.13 During this critical period, two ambitious kings, Ram Shah of Gorkha (1606‚Äì33) and Pratap Malla of Kantipur, took advantage of Tibetan weakness to seize control of the vital border-pass areas through which most of the trans-Himalayan trade passed. Ram Shah's incursions into Tibet occurred toward the end of his reign, probably from 1625 to 1630, after he had conquered the intervening territory between Gorkha and Kirong district in Tibet. The first Gorkhali invading force was defeated, and the severed heads of the two commanders were sent to the Panchen Lama at Shigatse. Ram Shah led another army into Kerong area, defeated the Tibetans at Khinchog and advanced as far as Kukurghat. He reached an agreement with the Tibetans under which the boundary line between Gorkha and Tibet was drawn at Kukurghat, thus giving Ram Shah control over one of the main channels of communication between Nepal and Tibet. This posed a serious problem for Kathmandu merchant community, which normally used the route through Kirong in their trade with Tibet. Pratap malla decided against contending directly with the Gorkha ruler for control of Kerong, but sought instead to bring the second major trade route, via Kuti, under his authority. An army commanded by his brother, Bhim Malla, was sent to Kuti in the 1630s and again in the period between 1645 and 1650. On the second occasion, Bhim Malla overran the border district and advanced some distance toward Shigatse before he was met by the deputies of the Dalai Lama, with whom he negotiated a peace settlement. The terms of this treaty were, in summary: # Kathmandu was granted joint authority with Tibet over the border towns of Kuti and Kerong. # The Newari merchant community of Kathmandu valley was permitted to establish 32 trading houses at Lhasa. # The Kathmandu court was given the right to post a representative (Nayo) at Lhasa. # Tibet agreed not to impose any charges or customs duties on Newari merchants who were engaged in trade with Tibet. # Tibet promised to make a token payment in gold and silver annually to Kathmandu. # It was agreed that Nepal would mint coins for Tibet; Tibet would use these coins internally and would either provide the silver required for their minting or would pay for Nepali coins with gold. # Tibet agreed that all trade with India, even though conducted by other than Newari merchants, would be channeled through Kathmandu valley in preference to the routes to the east (i.e., via Sikkim, Bhutan or Towang). Thanks to the treaty, the merchants of Kathmandu valley gained a virtual monopoly over the lucrative trade between India and Tibet, as well as the right to extend their commercial activities to Lhasa. The king of Kathmandu also profited substantially from the process under which he minted coins for the Tibetan government, for he deducted a certain percentage of the silver provided by Lhasa as his fee for this service. These Nepali coins, called \\"Mahendramalli,\\" were the sole currency in circulation throughout Tibet for more than a century.Rose, p.14 European visitors Left and Center. Dress of the Kingdom of Necbal. Right. A Northern Tartar. From \\"China Illustrata\\". In the year 1661, Pratap Malla, the then King of Kathmandu received Albert d‚ÄôOrville and Johann Grueber ‚Äì a Belgian and an Austrian with open arms into the valley. They were visiting Kathmandu from the imperial Chinese Observatory in Peking via Lhasa, seeking a land route to India. He granted them permission to preach the new religion, but without waiting for permission for a permanent stay, they left for Agra, the headquarters of the Tibet-Hindustan Mission in India. They determined the latitude of Kathmandu to be 27\\"5', which is low by 37', the actual latitude being 27\\"42'. In China Illustrata, by Athanasius Kircher, where the account of their journey is described, the very first description of Nepal is given to the Europeans. Despite the good hospitality shown by the king, the following unflattering picture of Nepal during the reign of Pratap Malla emerges in the book: > From Nesti is a journey of six days to Cadmendu, the capital of the kingdom > of Necbal, situated at 27‚Äù5‚Äô North. Here there resides a powerful, but > pagan, the king who is not unfriendly to the Christian law... Cities of this > kingdom are Cuthi and Nesti. It is the custom of this tribe when drinking to > women, for other men or women to pour out a drink of tea or wine three times > for the first woman. While drinking, they fix three pieces of butter to the > rim of the cup. Later on they fix this butter to their foreheads. They have > another custom here, fearsome in its barbarism. When sick people are near > death and there is no hope for their recovery, they are thrown out of the > house into the ditches of the field full of corpses. There, being exposed to > all injuries of nature, these die without any acts of devotion or > lamentation. After dying, these are left to be devoured by birds of prey, > wolves, dogs, and other creatures. They persuade themselves that it is a > uniquely glorious monument for the dead to obtain a sepulchre in the > stomachs of living animals. The women of these kingdoms are so ugly that > they seem more like devils than humans. For religious reasons they never > wash themselves with water, but only with totally rancid oil. Moreover, > besides exhaling an intolerable stench, they are so stained by the oil that > you would call them ghouls and not humans. The king showed marked kindness > to the fathers, especially because of the telescope, which he had never > heard of before, and because of the other scientific instruments shown him. > In fact, he was so captivated by these things that he decided to keep the > fathers with him, and they would not have been allowed to depart had they > not promised to return. If they would do this, he promised to build a house > there for our use and the mission work of our order and to provide ample > income. He also gave full permission for the Law of Christ to be introduced > into his kingdom.China Illustrata, p. 68. Legacy =Krishna Temple (Chyasin Dega)= Statue of Pratap Malla with his wives and sons at Hanuman Dhoka Palace. The octagonal Krishna Temple was built in 1648-49 by Pratap Malla, either as a response to rival Siddhinarshingh Malla's Krishna Temple in Patan or as a religious consolation for his earlier failure to conquer that city, or in memory of his two wives, or a combination of all three. The three-tiered traditional Newari building is supported by stone columns around the circumference of the base. The image of Krishna inside the temple is accompanied by his two wives, Satyabhama and Rukmani, all of which, according to a Sanskrit inscription, bear deliberate resemblance to Pratap Malla and his own two queens. Inside are the images of Krishna and two goddesses, which, according to a Sanskrit inscription, are modelled on the king and his two wives.Nepal Handbook, p. 188. =Pratap Malla's Column= Across from the Krishna Temple, standing on a slightly raised platform in front of the Hanuman Dhoka is the square stone pillar, known as the Pratap Dhvaja. It is topped by a statue of King Pratap Malla, seated with folded hands and surrounded by his two wives and his five (including an infant) sons. He looks towards his private prayer room on the third floor of the Degutaleju Temple. The column was erected in 1670 by Pratap Malla and preceded the similar columns in Patan and Bhaktapur.Lonely Planet, p. 124. =Kal Bhairab Statue= Kalbhairav Statue, Shiva in his destructive manifestation, at Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square Pratap Malla's stone inscription in Kathmandu Durbar Square. Here we see the word WINTER. North of the Jagannath Temple is the figure of Kala Bhairab. Bhairab is Shiva in his most fearsome aspect, and this huge stone image of the terrifying Kal Bhairab has six arms, wears a garland of skulls and tramples on a corpse, which is symbolic of human ignorance. The figure is said to have been brought to its present location by Pratap Malla, having been found in a field to the north of the city. The image was originally cut from a single stone but the upper left-hand corner has since been repaired. It is said that telling a lie while standing before Kala Bhairab will bring instant death and it was once used as a form of trial by ordeal. =Stone inscription= On the outside of the white wall of Kathmandu Durbar, opposite the Vishnu Temple, is a long low stone inscription to the goddess Kalika written in fifteen different languages, including European languages. Pratap Malla, renowned for his linguistic abilities, set up this inscription on 14 January 1664. A legend tells that milk will flow from the spout in the middle if somebody is able to decipher all fifteen languages.Lonely Planet, p. 125. The account of the wall and the inscription is given by Fr. Giuseppe, writing at the end of eighteenth century: > In a wall of the royal palace of Kathmandu, which is built upon the court > before the palace, there is a great stone of a single piece, which is about > fifteen feet long, and four or five feet thick: on the top of this great > stone there are four square holes at equal distances from each other. In the > inside of the wall they pour water into the holes, and in the courtside, > each hole having a closed canal, every person may draw water to drink. At > the foot of the stone is a large ladder, by which people ascend to drink; > but the curiosity of the stone consists in its being quite covered with > characters of different languages cut upon it. Some lines contain the > characters of the language of the country; others the characters of Tibet, > others Persia, others Greece, besides several others of different nations; > and in the middle there is a line of Roman characters, which appears in this > form AVTOMNE WINTER LHIVERT; but none of the inhabitants have any knowledge > how they came there, nor do they know whether or not any European had ever > been in Nepal before the missionaries, who arrived there only the beginning > of the present century. They are manifestly two French names of seasons, > with an English word between them.An account of the kingdom of Nepal The two French names of the seasons are AVTOMNE = autumn and L'HIVERT = winter. The word WINTER could also be winter in German or Dutch. =Rani Pokhari= Ranipokhari, commissioned by Pratap Malla in 1667, with Trichandra college and Ghantaghar (clock tower) in background. A 2011 picture of children dressed as cow in Gai Jatra festival. Ranipokhari lies in the heart of Kathmandu, with about fifteen minutes walk from Kathmandu Durbar Square. Rani Pokhari, meaning Queen's pond, is the artificial square-shaped pond with the temple of Shiva in the middle. The Rani in question was Pratap Malla's queen who in 1667 commissioned its construction in memory of their son, Chakravatendra Malla, who, following his father's abdication in favor of is four sons each of whom would rule for one year, died on the second day of his reign, apparently having been trampled by an elephant.Nepal Handbook, p. 195. The water with which the pond was originally filled was taken from fifty-one sacred rivers throughout Nepal and India, thus ensuring its sanctity. The temple in the middle of the pond has a domed roof reminiscent of classical Indian Mughal architecture and is surmounted by a copper spire. The main image is of the Shiva lingam, but other deities also feature. Four small shrines at each corner contain images of Bhirab, Harishankar, Shakti, and Tarkeshwari. On the southern embankment is a statue of an elephant carrying three passengers on its back, thought to be three of the male members of the Pratap Malla's family, while a fourth person is held in its trunk. Various myths and legends have come to be associated with Rani Pokhari over the years. It is said to be haunted by ghosts, including one especially seductive female spectre which managed to unnerve even the great Pratap Malla. The pond is fenced with iron bars, apparently to prevent suicide by drowning, and opened once a year during Bhaitika, the fifth and final day of Tihar. =Gai Jatra= The white spire temples, Anantapur and Pratapur, erected by Pratap Malla in 1646 in Swayambhu complex. When King Pratap Malla lost his son, his wife, the queen, remained grief-stricken. The king was very sad to see the condition of his beloved queen. The king, in spite of several efforts, could not lessen the grief of his wife. He desperately wanted to see a little smile on her lips; so he announced that anyone who made the queen laugh would be rewarded adequately. During the festival of Gai Jatra, the cow procession was brought before the grief-stricken queen. Then the participants began ridiculing and mocking the important people of the society. Finally, when the social injustices and other evils were highlighted and attacked mercilessly, the queen could not help but smile. The queen laughed and the king instituted a tradition of including jokes, satire, mockery, and lampoon into the Gaijatra celebration. As per the traditions, every family who has lost a relative during that past year participates in a procession through the streets leading a cow. If a cow is unavailable, a young boy dressed as a cow is substituted. =Swayambhunath= In 1614 additions and renovations of Swayambhunath complex were made by Zhamarpa VI during the reign of Pratap Malla. Access from Kathmandu was improved with the construction of a long stairway and a bridge across the Vishnumati.Nepal Handbook, p. 202. At the bottom of the 400 stone steps are three painted images symbolizing the Three Precious Jewels of Buddhism, which were erected in 1637 by Pratap Malla and his son, Lakshmandra Singh Malla. Pratap Malla also placed a large vajra placed in front of the stupa. Flanking the vajra, he also added two white shikhar (spires) temples, known as Anantapur (southeast) and Pratapur (northeast), which were built in 1646 to house the protector deities Bhairab and Bhairabi.Nepal Handbook, p. 203.

With it Silvio Berlusconi, head of the opposition at the time, committed himself, in the event of electoral victory, to enact various reforms summarized in 5 points, and in case of failure to achieve at least 4 points, not to run again subsequent elections.  History  The Contract with the Italians was not invented by Silvio Berlusconi, but was copied outright by his advisor Luigi Crespi from the Newt Gingrich's Contract with America introduced six weeks before the 1994 US Congressional election.  The \\"Contract\\" text  Contract with the Italians, between Silvio Berlusconi, born September 29, 1936 in Milan, leader of Forza Italia and Casa delle Libert√†, in agreement with all the allies of the coalition, and the Italian citizens, it is hereby agreed as follows. Silvio Berlusconi, in the event of electoral victory of Casa delle Libert√†, commits himself as Prime Minister to achieve the following objectives in five years: # Reduction of the tax burden: #*with full tax exemption from incomes up to 22 million Lire per year (‚Ç¨11,362.05); #*with the reduction to 23% for incomes up to 200 million Lire per year (‚Ç¨103,291.38); #*with the reduction to 33% for incomes above 200 million Lire per year (‚Ç¨103,291.38); #*with the abolition of inheritance tax and donations tax. # Implementing the \\"Plan for the protection of citizens and the prevention of crime\\" which provides, among other things, the institution of \\"district police officer\\" in the city, with a result of a sharp reduction in the number of crimes from the current 3 million. # Raising the minimum pension to at least 1 million Lire per month (‚Ç¨516.46). # Halving the current rate of unemployment with the creation of at least 1 ¬Ω million workplaces. # Opening of the sites for at least 40% of the investments under the \\"Ten Year Plan for Great Works\\" (Piano Decennale per le Grandi Opere) considered an emergency and comprising roads, highways, subways, railways, water networks and hydro-geological works for flood defense. In the event that at the end of 5 years of government at least 4 of 5 of such goals were not achieved, Silvio Berlusconi formally agrees not to resubmit its nomination to the next parliamentary elections. In witness, ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Silvio Berlusconi The contract will be rendered valid and operative May 13, 2001 by the vote of Italian electors.  Debate on the application of the five points  A great debate has emerged about these points have been respected or not. Silvio Berlusconi has repeatedly publicly affirmed that four of the five have been respected. The first point, namely the lowering of the rates would not have been implemented because of resistance within the center-right coalition. According to sociologist Luca Ricolfi, when asked if Berlusconi had honored the contract with the Italians, he replied: \\"No. He did not have to stand for election if he was a man of honor. He had only a promise kept completely out of five, that of pensions. On average, the promises of Berlusconi were kept only 60%. \\" Journalists Marco Travaglio and Peter Gomez, in their book Le mille balle blu, have stated that none of the five points was complied and concluded ironically: \\"Although missed all five goals, Silvio Berlusconi is re- nominated. So does not maintain even the sixth and final commitment\\" = Reduction of tax burden = Berlusconi agreed to move to a system of two rates, a 23% (for incomes up to about 100,000 euros) and a 33% (for incomes over 100,000 euros), with the addition of the exemption from fees for incomes less than 11,000 per year, also provided for the total abolition of taxes on inheritance and donations. The economic measures led to a change of tax brackets. The two aliquots have not been introduced, while taxes on inheritance and donations have been effectively abolished for incomes over 350 million Lire (‚Ç¨180759.91). According to ISTAT data the tax burden from 2001 to 2004 decreased by 0.1%, from 40.7% to 40.6%, while according to estimates by the Berlusconi government, the tax burden from 2001 to 2004 would have fall by 0.4%, from 42.2% to 41.8% of GDP.Governo Berlusconi, Documento di programmazione economica e finanziaria per il 2006-2009. From the estimates of Marco Travaglio and Peter Gomez, however, the tax burden during the legislature has increased overall, taking into account the increase of local taxes and tariffs.Peter Gomez e Marco Travaglio, Le mille balle blu, pp. 397-404 (2006, Rizzoli, ). = Decrease in crime = The district police have been introduced gradually and according to estimates by the Ministry of the Interior in August 2005, arrived about 2200, covering about 500 districts or areas of 10,000 inhabitants (approximately 9% of Italian population). This has not positively impacted on the number of offenses, which increased during the term: in the first two years, from 2001 to 2003, the increase amounted to 6.7% annually.Rapporto del Censis pubblicato il 3 dicembre 2004 From 2003 to 2004, allegations of crime that have led to prosecution increased by 3.7%.Francesco Favara, procuratore generale, Inaugurazione dell'anno giudiziario 2005. Also in 2001, according to accounts by ISTAT, the number of crimes reported to the police was not 3 million, but 2,163,826. = Increase of minimum pensions = In 2001, the Italian Labour Union (UIL) has calculated that the elders who received less than one million lire a month pension was 5,901,244, at the end of 2002 rose to about 8 million, according to statistics of the economist Tito Boeri. Those who have actually cashed the increase to one million lire (‚Ç¨516) were 1.8 million, about 25%, while about 6 million continue to receive a pension lower. To keep the promise, would have served from 11 to 17 billion EUR (about 1 and a half points of GDP). Therefore, Berlusconi decided to increase them only to those who was older than 70 years and couples with incomes not exceeding cumulative ‚Ç¨6,800 per year (clause not mentioned in the Contract). = Halving of unemployment = The goal of halving unemployment has not been reached. According to Eurostat in January 2001 the unemployment rate was 9.9% (a halving would require to go down to 4.95%), five years later, in 2006 had fallen to 7.1%, a record low in Italy, but still above the 4.95%.

He served as the Water Resources Minister of Rajasthan in Ashok Gehlot's ministry.  Biography  Mahipal Maderna comes from a farming family of Lakshman nagar. His father Parasram Maderna served as a cabinet minister in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly. He was educated as a lawyer, and holds an LL.B. degree. Like his father, he joined the Indian National Congress and entered politics. Maderna was elected as the chief of Jodhpur Zilla Parishad in 1981, 1988, 1994 and 2000. On 5 December 2003, he was elected to the 12th State Legislative Assembly from Bhopalgarh. He was elected to the 13th State Legislative Assembly from Osian, Jodhpur. He was inducted as cabinet minister for water resources. His daughter Divy Maderna has succeeded in taking his political legacy ahead. She is elected to the 15th state legislative assembly from Osian in Jodhpur.  Bhanwari Devi case  In 2011, Mahipal Maderna was accused of being involved in a case relating to the disappearance of a nurse named Bhanwari Devi. Bhanwari, who worked as an auxiliary nurse/midwife in the Jaliwada village (Bilara tehsil) went missing on 1 September. Her husband Amarchand alleged that she was abducted on orders of Maderna. Subsequently, the Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot sacked Maderna as a minister on 26 October. It was alleged that Bhanwari Devi was negotiating a multi-crore deal with Maderna and his opponents to trade of a CD in which she was seen in a \\"compromising position\\" with Maderna and others. In November 2011, Rehana, the girlfriend of the key suspect Shahabuddin, leaked an audio clip to the reporters. The clip was recorded during her discussion with Shahabuddin in the Jodhpur Central Jail. In the clip, Shahabuddin is heard telling Rehana that Bhanwari Devi was handed over to the gang of Pradeep Godara, a criminal wanted by the Rajasthan police in several cases. He is also heard telling that he had been falsely implicated in the case, and had no clue what happened to Bhanwari.Bhanwari case: Audio tape gives new spin CBI arrested Maderna on 3 December and questioned him. He was confronted with the key suspects, Sahiram Bishnoi, Shahabuddin and Sohan Lal Bishnoi in jail. Later it was revealed that maderna and Congress legislator Malkhan Singh were hand-in-glove in the entire conspiracy as the nurse was blackmailing both of them. The two politicians allegedly roped in a Sahiram Bishnoi, who hired Sohan Lal, Balia and Shahabuddin for the task of kidnapping the nurse. On 6 January Central Bureau of Investigation claimed to know whereabouts of disposal of Bhanwari Devi's body. Investigating officers were praised by Central Bureau of Investigation director for solving this case in 100 days. The agency is about to file a second charge sheet after admission of the Bishnaram gang on the disposal of bhanwari devi's body at Jaloda village near Osian village in Jodhpur. Dilip Singh Murder Case Earlier in 1970, Maderna along with Vijay Poonia, was also accused of murder of a student Dilip Singh nephew of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat(ex-VP, India) in Jaipur. On 3 February 1970, Dilip Singh was allegedly beaten at room no.42 in Vivekanand hostel and FIR was lodged at Gandhinagar Police Station with offences Under Sections 307 and 452 read with Section 149, and Section 148, IPC. Dilip Singh succumbed to injuries on 14 February 1970. Later, the investigation was handed over to CBI and the case was altered to one for offences Under Sections 148, 302, 307, 453 read with Section 149 and Section 120B, IPC. However both the principal accused were acquitted subsequently.

It is credited with establishing the German language in the dark wave movement, although there were already such German bands as Xmal Deutschland, Geisterfahrer, and Malaria!. History In the late 1980s, a number of German musicians combined music in neo-classical, gothic rock, and darkwave styles with German philosophical texts and a highly theatrical stage show.Nym, Alexander: Schillerndes Dunkel. Geschichte, Entwicklung und Themen der Gothic-Szene, Pl√∂ttner Verlag 2010, , p. 173 The music was based on post-punk, cold wave, and gothic rock of bands such as Joy Division, The Cure, and Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the synthesizer-based new wave sound of bands like Depeche Mode. The words often paid deep homage to German philosophers like Andreas Gryphius, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Nietzsche and Gottfried Benn, as well as international poets such as Georg Trakl, Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Baudelaire, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The concerts of these groups put a great emphasis on costumes, lights and pyrotechnics. The performances were designed to stimulate all the senses and convey an overall dark, brooding atmosphere. Lyrical themes include transience, evil, nihilism, surrealism, expressionism, existential philosophy, criticism of religion, violence, madness, isolation, depression, and especially death. As part of this movement, a number of bands use classical Latin for their lyrics and album names. The greatest Neue Deutsche Todeskunst hits include \\"Gottes Tod\\" by Das Ich (1990), \\"Verflucht\\" by Relatives Menschsein (1991), \\"Der Ketzer\\" by Lacrimosa (1991), \\"Das Ende\\" by Goethes Erben (1992) and \\"Regentanz\\" by Endraum (1992). Many NDT artists gravitated to the Danse Macabre record label. Origin The expression \\"Neue Deutsche Todeskunst\\" was first used in 1991 by Danse Macabre's label magazine MagazinOphon. It was picked up by Sven Freuen, a journalist for the Zillo magazine, who used it to classify bands like Relatives Menschsein, Das Ich and Goethes Erben.

Originally a hardwood forest, the park and its vicinity was the early site of Fort Washington, built in 1789 to protect early settlers of the Ohio River town from Indian attacks. The site next served as the homestead of the prominent Lytle family. Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory William Lytle II built his house there in 1809, about ten years prior to the completion of the neighboring Martin Baum mansion (now the Taft Museum of Art). The land then known as Lytle Square was purchased by the City of Cincinnati in 1905 and Lytle Park was dedicated July 6, 1907.Other Parks part 2 Statue of Lincoln with the park and the Taft Museum visible in the background The bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln facing the entrance of the park was commissioned by the Charles P.

The statue was dedicated amid great fanfare on March 31, 1917, by former president William Howard Taft. The adjacent U.S. Marine Corps Memorial is a granite boulder with bronze plaque and Marine emblem atop a globe. It was dedicated in 1921. When an expressway was planned to be built downtown, Lytle Park faced its possible demise. Former Mayor Charles P.

It was built in 1935 by the municipality of Istanbul, for Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's recreational use. The building is a historic house museum today. Architecture Designed in the Bauhaus style by architect Seyfi Arkan, who was given the commission in 1935 by the municipality of Istanbul, the mansion was completed on August 14 the same year, and was gifted to Atat√ºrk. The building is constructed on steel piles driven into the seabed and is connected to the sandy beach about away with a wooden pier. The L-shaped, one-floor mansion consists of a reception hall, a reading room, bedrooms and bathroom. There are also service and staff rooms at the complex. The total area covered by the mansion including the pier is . A grove was created in the yard of the ruined Agios Stefanos Monastery as the garden for the mansion on Atat√ºrk's taking possession. This grove is called \\"Florya Atat√ºrk Grove\\" () and is today a public park. The mansion is considered an example of the \\"Turkish Early Republican architecture\\". History During the period he stayed at Dolmabah√ße Palace, Atat√ºrk came to the mansion by boat and enjoyed swimming surrounded by local people. He used the mansion for the last three years of his life as a summer office as well as for recreation. In 1936, he stayed from June 6 until July 28 at the mansion. His last stay was on May 28, 1938, about six months before his death. The mansion was also used for important receptions and scientific meetings. Among its famous visitors were Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor and his wife Wallis, Duchess of Windsor. Following the death of Atat√ºrk, Turkish presidents such as ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, Celal Bayar, Cemal G√ºrsel, Cevdet Sunay, Fahri Korut√ºrk and Kenan Evren used the Florya Mansion as a summer residence. Museum Due to the encroaching urban development and the consequent pollution of the sea at the site, the mansion fell into disuse as an official residence. On September 6, 1988, the building was handed over to the National Palaces Department of the Turkish Grand National Assembly. It was then renovated and opened in 1993 to the public as a museum. A section of the mansion is reserved as a social facility for members of parliament. The museum exhibits furniture, tableware, personal belongings including swimwear, as well as a collection of Atat√ºrk's photographs taken at the site. Location and access The museum is situated west of Atat√ºrk International Airport on the coastal road from Florya to K√º√ß√ºk√ßekmece. It can be reached from Florya train station on the Istanbul- Halkalƒ± commuter line, which is about away. Bus line \\"73T Yenibosna Metro- Florya\\" of ƒ∞ETT serves the location as well.

Wilson (1870 - 1947) was an American architect. His practice in Santa Barbara, California included work for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and its associated Fred Harvey Company hotels, as well as many residences. Wilson was born in Massachusetts and arrived in California at the age of 17 to visit his sister, a schoolteacher in Placerville. There, he worked as a log-driver on the American River and then as a surveyor for the Southern Pacific Railroad. He moved to San Francisco in the early 1890s, becoming a draftsman for the firm of Pissis and Moore, where he was instructed by architect Albert Pissis. Wilson studied at the San Francisco chapter of the American Institute of Architects and took a grand tour of Europe before establishing his own firm in Santa Barbara in 1895. Santa Barbara Railway Station Shortly after arriving in Santa Barbara, Wilson designed homes for Dr. C.C. Park and General Henry J. Strong. He built up a practice designing homes for the wealthy, as well as designing, building and selling speculative houses. His connections with the wealthy led to an interest in polo and amateur horse racing, and to commissions for the Santa Barbara Club, the Central Savings Bank, the Santa Barbara library, post office, and railroad station. A friendship with Edward Payson Ripley, president of the Santa Fe Railway, led to commissions for the railway and for the Fred Harvey Company, as well as a commission to design Ripley's winter home. His most extravagant residential commission, Las Tejas in the suburb of Montecito, was built in 1917 for Oakleigh Thorne. Wilson married Julia Redington, sister of Wilson's friend and fellow Santa Barbara Polo Club member Lawrence Redington, in 1905. In 1920, Wilson purchased a forty-five acre ranch in Tuolumne County, California, as well as a nearby mining company. Shortly thereafter, he divorced Redington.

The country is not a member of FIFA. History The most popular codes of football in Nauru have long been Australian rules football, rugby league and rugby union, which were introduced during the early 20th century by Australians working in the phosphate industry. Soccer was introduced in the 1960s, by migrant workers from Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. It enjoyed a period of relative popularity, and at one point the island had a six-team league. A collapse of the Nauruan economy in the late 1990s, followed by a government policy of compulsorily repatriating immigrants, led to an absolute decline in the country's population by 2002. This appears to have severely affected sports other than Australian rules and the rugby codes. A 2009 World Soccer article noted that organised soccer had \\"fallen apart\\" on Nauru, and that the island's was unlikely to ever field a team at the Pacific Games (the main regional tournament for non-FIFA teams).\\"Micronesia is struggling to keep the game afloat, writes Steve Menary\\", World Soccer, 19 November 2009.

It began as an additional year of study for selected graduates of the United States Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Although there was some disagreement as to the course purpose, it settled into providing its students a \\"broad, deep military education in the science and art of war.\\" Colonel Wass de Czege provided the vision and impetus for the school, and coordinated the shaping of the curriculum and the school before and during its early years. The early years were marked with uncertainty about how its graduates would be accepted and how they would perform, but the initial results from the field were positive. Its growing popularity and reputation attracted students from other U.S. uniformed services, and eventually international military students. U.S. interagency students from the Defense Intelligence Agency, Department of State, and the United States Agency for International Development, among others followed. The first major combat test for SAMS graduates was Operation Just Cause, where the school further built its reputation. However, it wasn't until Operation Desert Storm that SAMS graduates earned the moniker of \\"Jedi Knight\\", due partly to their efforts in planning the invasion. Since then, SAMS graduates have participated in nearly every U.S. military operation as well as military operations other than war, such as relief efforts following Hurricane Katrina. Today, the school produces \\"leaders with the flexibility of mind to solve complex operational and strategic problems in peace, conflict, and war\\". Early years The impetus for the SAMS course manifested in various forms. Colonel Richard Sennrich, SAMS's second director, pointed to a post-Vietnam War \\"hole\\" in U.S. military education between the CGSC focus on tactics and the war colleges' focus on \\" 'grand strategy' and national security policy\\".Naylor 1991. pp. 10, 16. In the period after the Vietnam War, the commandant of the United States Army's Command and General Staff College (CGSC), lieutenant general (LTG) William Richardson, \\"ordered the directors of CGSC to find ways to 'improve the tactical judgment' of CGSC graduates.\\"Wass de Czege 2009. p. 102. Colonel Huba Wass de Czege, an officer stationed at Fort Leavenworth, was the primary driver for the creation of the school. According to Wass de Czege, the solutions generated were inadequate, and he readied a new proposal‚Äîstarting a new school‚Äîwhich he briefed to LTG Richardson during a trip to China on the Yangtze River in the spring of 1981.Wass de Czege 2009. p. 103. In 1982‚Äì1983, Wass de Czege's purpose was to \\"develop a curriculum for a course focused on large unit operations and specifically the operational art\\".Richard M. Swain, (1996) \\"Filling the Void: The Operational Art and the U.S. Army,\\" in B.J.C. McKercher and Michael Hennesey, eds., Operational Art: Developments in the Theories of War, Praeger Publishers. . p. 160. According to Swain, this information was \\"described in\\" U.S. Army Combined Arms Center 1982‚Äì83‚Äì84, (1989) Annual Historical Review, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Combined Arms Center History Office. After approval on 28 December 1982 by General Glen Otis (the commander of the U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine Command‚ÄîTRADOC), a pilot program began in June 1983‚Äîa \\"1-year extension of the Command and General Staff College ... for specially selected officers.\\"Benson 2009. p. 2. Bell Hall As a further indication of the need for extended schooling, Wass de Czege compared the length of the U.S. Army's staff college (42 weeks) to that of other \\"first rate\\" armies such as Canada, Germany, Russia, and the United Kingdom, with lengths between 65 and 150 weeks for selected officers. Benson states that \\"The British and Germans sent their officers to school for 'about 100 weeks. \\". He also pointed to periods in the past when the Command and General Staff School was two years in duration. = Course purpose = There were a number of considerations regarding the purpose and concept for the school. Wass de Czege thought that certain officers should receive a \\"broad, deep military education in the science and art of war.\\" Graduates would not be a \\"privileged elite\\", but would \\"create a multiplier effect in all areas of Army competence.\\"Huba Wass de Czege, \\"Army Staff College Level Training Study,\\" Final Report, 13 June 1983, F-1/2. Quoted in But there were varying ideas about what product the course should generate. For example, the commandant of the Command and General Staff School, Lieutenant General Jack N. Merritt \\"wanted sort of a junior Henry Kissinger kind of course,\\" whereas the deputy commandant, Major General Crosbie Saint Jr. envisioned a \\"super dooper tacticians course.\\"US Army Military History Institute, Senior Officer Oral History Program, LTC Harold R. Winton, USA, Retired. Conducted by LTC Richard Mustion, 5 April 2001 at Carlisle Barracks, PA, 7. Quoted in What was developed, and eventually approved, by both officers was \\"a broad-based curriculum that began with military theory and ended with courses on preparing for war‚Äîa logical progression through the complexities of warfare\\". Although Army senior leaders had accepted the need for the school, an additional challenge was finding the right students to attend. According to John S. Brown, \\"A fraction of SAMS's popularity was its exploitation of a time-honored technique: Seduce talented officers into staff work by promising to make them line officers in due course.Interviews with Marcus Erlandson, Friedburg, Germany, 17 April 1986 and Joey Martz, Fort Stewart, Georgia, 15 December 1992. Cited in John S, Brown, \\"The Maturation of Operational Art: Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.\\" In Krause and Phillips 2005. p. 441. =Course development= Two officers became the \\"curriculum carpenters\\" to mold the course with Wass de Czege: Lieutenant Colonel Hal Winton, and Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Johnson. They developed the course from March to June 1983 in accordance with U.S. Army TRADOC requirements. Lieutenant Colonel L. Don Holder later also joined the team. They planned travel into the course, including observation of Regular Army and National Guard training, as well as visits to U.S. military headquarters and a trip to Europe for a NATO exercise. Flint Hall, circa 1980s. In June 1983, students reported for the first SAMS class. Although the curriculum was ready, the school faced a number of challenges at the outset. For example, there was no separate academic building for the school. Classrooms in Fort Leavenworth's Bell Hall (image right) were reserved \\"on a daily basis.\\"Benson 2009. p. 14‚Äì15. During the first year, Winton observed that, \\"It was a little bit on the fly and everybody put up with that and understood it.\\"US Army Military History Institute, Senior Officer Oral History Program, LTC Harold R. Winton, USA, Retired. Conducted by LTC Richard Mustion, 5 April 2001 at Carlisle Barracks, PA, 17. Quoted in Difficulties aside, the 13 students of the first class completed their studies and graduated in May 1984. By then, SAMS had become \\"the symbol for intellectual renaissance in the officer corps\\".Stewart 2010. p. 291. As planned at the outset, enrollment steadily increased in following years;Wass de Czege 1983. p. F-31. the second class comprised 24 students, which rose to 52 by 1991‚Äîthe year SAMS graduates would be tested in Operation Desert Storm.Naylor 1991. p. 16. The school saw a number of other changes as well in the early years. Due to challenges with the Army Personnel Management Division in supplying high-quality officers to serve as instructors for three years, Wass de Czege made some adjustments. In 1984, he hired the first two civilian faculty members, both with PhDs in history. Additionally, in 1985, the Advanced Operational Studies Fellowship (AOSF) began, which put selected officers through the course and made them instructors in the following year. By the time Wass de Czege relinquished the reins as director of the school to Colonel Richard Sennreich in 1985, the school was beginning to produce results: \\"The Army as a whole and the College in particular came to view SAMS as a useful experiment.\\"Benson 2009. p. 21. But the school was not done developing. In 1986, Sennreich changed the name from the Department of Advanced Military Studies to the School of Advanced Military Studies.Benson 2009. p. 24. This action \\"ensured a large degree of freedom for future directors\\" by establishing it as a separate school within CGSC.Benson 2009. p. 24. By the time Colonel L. Don Holder became the third Director of the school, the effect of SAMS on the force was still unclear. Attendance \\"was still regarded as 'a slightly chancy thing to sign up for' \\".Benson 2009. p. 25. Yet, there were positive signs. Other uniformed services became interested in benefitting from the course. During Holder's tenure, there were Air Force officers in each of the four AMSP seminars.Benson 2009. p. 25. The program was also \\"growing in popularity\\", applications for entry into SAMS soon more than doubled the available 48 seats,Benson 2009. p. 25, 27. and the result of the admissions process \\"was a very select, bright group of officers who were eager for the SAMS experience.Lieutenant General (Retired) L. Don Holder, interview by Kevin Benson, 12 January 2009. Quoted in Benson 2009. p. 27. Holder instituted further changes. As a masters-degree program, the requirement to write a single master's thesis was changed to two monographs.Benson 2009. p. 29. Holder also split the SAMS Fellows (AOSF) into a separate seminar with their own curriculum.Benson 2009. p. 30. But the changes did not stop there. Holder saw the first international officer assigned as a SAMS faculty member‚Äîa British Colonel who eventually led a seminar due to various faculty members' departure to command U.S. Army brigades in 1987.Benson 2009. p. 31‚Äì32. By 1990, SAMS was called to help develop U.S. Army doctrine. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas E. Mitchell, the fifth SAMS director, Colonel James McDonough, and various other members of the SAMS team played a significant part in revising the U.S. Army Doctrinal Manual 100-5 Operations in 1990‚Äì1993.Romjue 1996. pp. 27‚Äì28, 31‚Äì33, 39‚Äì40, 44, 46, 51, 109.  Curriculum development  In the early years, the course \\"was defined largely by historical studies of modern, and usually armored, campaigns and analyzed in terms of Clausewitzian concepts, particularly centers of gravity and culmination\\".Richard M. Swain, (1996) \\"Filling the Void: The Operational Art and the U.S. Army,\\" in B.J.C. McKercher and Michael Hennesey, eds., Operational Art: Developments in the Theories of War. Praeger Publishers. . p. 164. This, according to the school's second director, separated the course from the Jominian focus‚Äîadherence to a recipe of rules and principles‚Äîof the Command and General Staff College.Benson 2009. p. 24. The school's founders also stressed the importance of theory, and this became an integral part of the course. Clausewitz, Jomini, Mao Zedong, Sun Tzu, and Tuchachevsky found homes in SAMS' theory courses.Benson 2009. p. 28. Critical thinking, as part of the course, was reinforced by guest speakers, who also \\"challenged conventional wisdom\\".Benson 2009. p. 29.  Operation Just Cause and beyond  In its early years, the value of the school had not yet been clearly established. The \\"first test of battle\\" for SAMS graduates came during Operation Just Cause. A core planning cell of seven SAMS graduates \\"crafted a well rehearsed and well executed plan that simultaneously struck some roughly 50 objectives in a single coordinated blow\\". According to Kevin Benson, \\"The Army and SAMS faced a test of battle and the new group of highly-educated planners appeared to have passed the test with flying colors.\\"Benson 2009. p. 38. Eisenhower Hall The results of Operation Just Cause reverberated within the school. An end-of-course survey in 1990 suggested that‚Äîconsidering the operation‚Äî\\" 'LIC [low intensity conflict] needed more emphasis', and that the course needed 'more joint participation' \\".Harold R. Winton, School of Advanced Military Studies: End of Course Survey. AY 88‚Äì89, 27 July 1990, quoted in The school and faculty knew that there would be further tests for SAMS graduates ahead. They were not wrong: \\"The next test ... would take place in the deserts of the Persian Gulf.\\"Benson 2009. p. 38. Shortly after General Norman Schwarzkopf arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 1990, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, General Carl Vuono offered him the use of some SAMS graduates. Schwarzkopf accepted. These SAMS planners became known as \\"Schwarzkopf's famous 'Jedi Knights' \\".Krause and Phillips 2005. p. 445. This \\"small Jedi Knight team ... would dramatically shape the outlines of Operation Desert Storm\\". But the efforts of SAMS graduates were not limited to the initial planning effort. 82 graduates were participating in \\"a wide array of command and planning tasks\\", in the theater by February 1991. These efforts \\"established SAMS in the minds of the leadership of the Army as a place to turn to for superb planners\\".Benson 2009. p. 42. After Desert Storm, the school again looked ahead. The Army was \\"grappling with a range of new problems: military operations other than war, peacekeeping, and peace enforcement operations\\".Benson 2009. p. 44. The school and its graduates examined the situations in Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia, and SAMS Jedi Knights engaged in operations worldwide, as well as domestic contingencies such as those in Los Angeles and Miami (after Hurricane Katrina).Benson 2009. p. 44. But SAMS graduates had not completely turned away from large-scale operational planning. Lieutenant General Guy C. Swan noted that SAMS graduates were indispensable in Europe after the fall of the Berlin wall and the dissolution of the WARSAW Pact. They were expected to \\"re-engineer the decades of planning that had gone into the GDP [General Defense Plan] almost overnight\\". Swan stated that this was \\"the first true test of SAMS on a large scale\\". The course itself continued to change in the waning hours of the twentieth century. Under Colonel Robin P. Swan, the school moved from Fort Leavenworth's Flint Hall to Eisenhower Hall (image right) in October 1994. Swan also decided to add an additional two seminars.Benson 2009. p. 46. The civilian faculty also expanded.Benson 2009. p. 46. The drawdown in forces after Operation Desert Storm affected SAMS as well. By 1998, the school's enrollment began to shrink based on timing concerns by eligible students in a shrinking force. This was in spite of favorable comparisons between SAMS attendees and non- attendees on promotion and command selection boards in 1995‚Äì1998.Kretchik 1998. pp. 32‚Äì34.  The 21st century  Although the first class comprised only 13 students, \\"subsequent classes over the next 16 years averaged 48.\\" By the twentieth century, demand for SAMS graduates increased. By the year 2000, there were 57 students in the program; this would increase to 95 in the next four years.United States Army Command and General Staff College 2005. p. 29. This was within the range of 36 to 120 that Wass de Czege predicted in 1983 would \\"assure quality\\" in the course.Wass de Czege 1983. p. F-31. SAMS's \\"Jedi Knights\\" played a significant role in the Global War on Terror as well. The United States Central Command requested SAMS graduates along with its \\"sister schools\\", the United States Air Force's School of Advanced Air and Aerospace Studies (SAAAS), as well as the United States Marine Corps's School of Advanced Warfighting (SAW).Benson 2009. pp. 48‚Äì49. These planners participated in the preparations for the invasion of Iraq, as well as a \\"post-hostility plan for the occupation of Iraq\\".Benson 2009. pp. 49. Again, SAMS graduates' efforts were not limited to major combat operations during the Global War on Terror. Its officers also deployed to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to assist the military's Joint Task Force and the Federal Emergency Management Agency after Hurricane Katrina.Benson 2009. p. 50; United States Army Command and General Staff College 2005. p. 4. The school continued to morph to meet the demands of a changing world. An additional faculty expansion occurred in 2005‚Äì2006, and the Fellows' curriculum shifted further away from that of the AMSP program's.Benson 2009. pp. 50‚Äì51. To meet an increasing demand, the 11th Director, Colonel Steve Banach, began a winter-start SAMS course in 2007.Benson 2009. pp. 53. During this period, SAMS also \\"continued to serve the Army at war as a 'reach' asset\\", helping deployed headquarters plan operations and contingencies.Benson 2009. pp. 52. On 30 August 2011 the school's offices and most of its seminars moved from Eisenhower Hall to the newly renovated Muir Hall at Fort Leavenworth.  Directors of the school  * 1983.

Traditionally there is an autochthonous community in the Molise region known as the Molise Croats, but there are many other Croats living in or associated with Italy through other means. In 2010, persons with Croatian citizenship in Italy numbered 21,079. Analysis Croats in Italy could mean any of the following: *Molise Croats - a long-established Croatian population in the Molise region. *Ethnic Croats to have relocated to Italy from any region to which Croats may be autochthonous (e.g. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and other countries). *Any person originally from the Republic of Croatia regardless of ethnicity to maintain Croatian documentation. Molise Croats Molise Croats, who were the first Croats to settle in Italy, at the time of the Ottoman expansion in the Balkans, are one of the linguistic minority officially recognised by the Italian Republic. They achieved protection as a minority on 5 November 1996 by an agreement signed between Croatia and Italy. According to 2001 census, there were 2,801 Molise Croats, of which 813 lived in San Felice del Molise (), 800 in Acquaviva Collecroce () and 468 in Montemitro (). The number of Molise Croats is in decline.

Baldwin (1914‚Äì1977), who used the signature Rupe, was best known for his comic strip Freddy, about a goofy kid.  Biography  = Education and early career = Baldwin studied painting at Washington's Corcoran School of Art. Instead of entering the field of fine art, however, he supported himself with government work and advertising art. His cartoon illustrations led him into minor comic book artwork, contributing to Prize Comics and Spook Comics.Lambiek =Freddy= Robert Baldwin's Freddy (October 14, 1956) In the early 1950s, Baldwin and his wife, music teacher Helen L. Baldwin (1913‚Äì1998), were living in the Far East, where he worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, when they created the comic strip Freddy about a little boy named Freddy J. McReady. As he drew, she wrote gags for the strip, which was loosely based on their children. In 1955, he left the CIA and concentrated on the strip, using a loose brush ink style to draw his chubby child. Eventually published in 100 newspapers, it ran from 1955 to 1980, distributed by the George Matthew Adams Service and later The Washington Star Syndicate and Field Enterprises. In 1964, Baldwin described his working methods: The appeal of Freddy and his friends was that they acted like real children, often hyperactive. In 1969, a curious attempt to make the character slightly older and less childlike backfired, as evident in an April 30, 1969 statement by Harry E. Elmlark of the Washington Star Syndicate: During the 1960s, Baldwin's assistant was Howard Rands, who drew his own strip, Twitch, during the 1970s. Born in Geneva, New York, Rands studied at the Abbott Art School, was in the U. S. Merchant Marine and illustrated several Air Force magazines. The Baldwins lived in Washington, D.C. Robert Baldwin died in 1977, and Helen Baldwin died March 14, 1998, from Lou Gehrig's disease.

Pontus and Sidonia (French: Ponthus et la belle Sidonie or just Ponthus et Sidoine) is a medieval prose romance, originally composed in French in ca. 1400, possibly by Geoffroy IV de la Tour Landry (d. 1391) or by another member of the La Tour family. It is about Pontus, the son of the king of Galicia, who falls in love with Sidonia, daughter of the king of Brittany. The text is associated with the lords of La Tour because it derives the ancestors of that family, whose ancestral possessions were in Brittany, from members of the train of prince Pontus. The story is based on an earlier work, the Anglo- Norman chanson de geste Horn et Rimenhild (ca. 1180). Several German translations were made during the 15th century (viz., in the period corresponding to the final phase of Middle High German or the formative phase of Early New High German). There is a surviving version in Alemannic German, possibly written in the Old Swiss Confederacy, dated to between 1440 and 1460, and another version in Moselle Franconian, probably written in the region of Trier. Another translation of the French text was made by Eleanor, Archduchess of Austria (1433‚Äì1480). Two English translations appeared within a century: an anonymous one in 1450, and one by Henry Watson in 1501 and 1511. A late medieval Dutch translation ' survived in an edition printed by Niclaes vanden Wouwere in Antwerp in 1564.

It was inaugurated in 1861, designed by the architect Jer√≥nimo de la G√°ndara. In the seventeenth century the site of the theatre was a patio equipped with a stage for putting on plays and covered boxes for the audience. The patio was covered in the eighteenth century, and the Plaza de la Comedia lasted until 1856, when it was proposed to replace the now-ruinous building with a new theatre. Jer√≥nimo de G√°ndara was the architect. The Teatro Lope de Vega was inaugurated on 8 December 1861. The facade, restored in 1920, is in the classical style. It has two levels, each with three arches, and a pediment that holds a medallion with the likeness of Lope de Vega sculpted by Ponciano Ponzano. More recently an iron and glass canopy was added. The theatre was renovated in 1960, reopening as a cinema and theatre, but closed on 30 April 2000. The Caja Duero, a bank, bought the run-down theatre for seven million euros in April 2006. In March 2007 it was estimated that another seven million euros would be needed to rehabilitate the theatre. Given the high cost, there were delays in getting the project started. In August 2008 the president of the bank confirmed that they had received an offer to buy the theatre and convert it for use as a gaming room. In August 2008 the mayor of Valladollid, Francisco Javier Le√≥n de la Riva, said he was confident that work would be started to undertake a major restoration for the listed building.

She immigrated to London in 1886 when she was fifteen, and she grew to minor prominence when she sang in music halls throughout the United Kingdom during the late 19th century. She became known in the field for standing up for female performers against agents, corruption, and for better working conditions. She joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1908, engaged in selling their newspaper Votes for Women and became a prominent suffragette in the United Kingdom for her participation in civil unrest protests including riots and arson. As a result, Marion was arrested many times and is known for having endured 232 force-feedings while on hunger strike in prison. She is quoted as saying ‚Äúthere are no words to describe the horrible revolting sensation.‚Äù When World War I started she emigrated to the United States, and there she joined the team on Margaret Sanger‚Äôs Birth Control Review. Although she used her tenacity and loud voice to get people to pay attention to her cause, she did not use violence as much as she had in the United Kingdom, although she was still arrested many times for advocating birth control. Early years Katherina Maria Schafer was born in Rietberg in Westphalia, Germany, on 12 March 1871. Her mother died of tuberculosis when the child was two, leaving Marion with her father. Four years later, when Marion was six, her step-mother also died of tuberculosis. Her father, whose name is not known, abused Marion and hated that she had red hair.Viv Gardner, \\"Marion, Kitty (1871‚Äì1944)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 8 Nov 2017 When Marion was fifteen, she was sent by her father to live with her aunt in England. Career =Actress= From when she was a child, Marion had liked to sing. While in school, she was quoted as saying, ‚Äú[A]t singing and reciting I excelled simply because it came easily to me and I loved it.‚ÄùKitty Marion Papers, Manuscripts and Archives Division, The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox, and Tilden Foundations, Shortly after she moved to England to live with her aunt, she started performing on the pantomime stage. She found a natural home in London music halls, where variety shows included songs and skits that commented on current events. It was a more open, diverse, and informal environment of artists compared to the rest of Victorian England. When she started singing in the halls, her roles were so small that she did not even appear on the program, but she eventually moved her way up through the chorus and minor roles to become the understudy for lead roles in performances that toured the UK such as The Lady Slavery.Christine A. Anderson, \\"(Per)forming Female Politics: The Making of the 'Modern Woman' in London, 1890-1914\\" (Ph.D. diss., University of Kansas, 2008), 36, http://kuscholarworks .ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/4535/1/ Anderson_ku_0099D_10060_DATA_1.pdf. Marion's more significant contribution to the music hall industry was rebelling against the corrupt system that permitted assaults against women within it. The working conditions for performers were harsh, and Peter Bailey has criticized the creation of the \\"more or less professionalized labor force\\".Peter Bailey, ed., Music Hall: The Business of Pleasure (Milton Keynes, U.K.: Open University Press, 1986), The exploitation was very sexist, as women were expected to perform sexual favors in exchange for jobs. Marion recalls in her unpublished autobiography one of these encounters with an agent called Mr. Dreck. During a meeting about a performance opportunity Dreck tried to kiss her. She resisted, fell, and hit her head. He told her that she would not be able to succeed if she continued to stop sexual advances from men in power. In 1906 she joined the Actor's Association and the Variety Artists Federation (VAF) where she was outspoken about the treatment of female performers. In the same year she gained public recognition when she wrote a response letter to the London Era newspaper after they published actors‚Äô lack of loyalty to their agents. Marion wrote that she had ‚Äúgiven up hope for a woman who wants to earn her own living, and at the same time rise in the profession on her merits only, without influence of any sort.‚Äù Over the next six weeks many other women wrote describing their own experiences. Her involvement with the suffrage movement harmed her career in the UK because of her damaged reputation. Agents did not want to cause scandals. Conversely, performance opportunities increased when she moved to the United States, but she was not able to work because of her time spent with the Birth Control Review. =Activist= While advocating for performers, Marion was drawn to the Suffragette Movement. She joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1908 and the Actresses Franchise League (AFL) in 1909. Her first role at the WSPU was selling their newspaper, Votes for Women, on the streets. Although she initially did not like doing it, eventually she became comfortable with her job and developed into one of the best members according to Barbara Green.Barbara Green, Spectacular Confessions: Autobiography, Performative Activism, and the Sites of Suffrage 1905-1938 (New York: St. Martin's Press, i997)> \\"¬∑ Green also asserts that Marion's foray into selling Votes for Women was a \\"perilous encounter with a condemning masculine gaze\\" (39). Yet Marion does not specify that \\"every eye\\" was male, making Green's assertion somewhat problematic. Marion embraced the militant activism the WSPU used, and participated in processions during which police officers became violent against them. She threw bricks into windows of post offices, grocery stores, and once threw a package of suffragette literature through the window of the Home Office. She handled many terrorist arson attacks and bombings, not intended to hurt people, in churches and train carriages. They did not cause as much damage as current bombs do because the bombs smoked before they detonated, giving people time to get away. She once submitted a false fire alarm for inspection and refused to pay a fine. She would rather serve jail time, so she went to jail for a month with the support of other suffragettes.The day book.

While in prison, many suffragettes would go on hunger strike, so the prison staff would hold them down and insert tubes down the nostrils, mouth, or throat while liquid food was poured.

Marion had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. Marion had to leave the United Kingdom at the start of World War I because of anti-German sentiment, and with the help of influential suffragettes she was able to emigrate to the United States. She met Margaret Sanger at Carnegie Hall, and started working with her selling Sanger's magazine, the Birth Control Review. She became a familiar New York figure as she would be standing in Times Square to Coney Island, selling diligently.Esther Katz, ed., The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger, vol. 1, The Woman Rebel, 19001928 (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2003) It was a form of protest as well as education, because it forced people to pay attention to what she was talking about.Buckman, Rilma. ‚ÄúSocial Engineering: A Study of the Birth Control Movement.‚Äù Social Forces, vol. 22, no. 4, 1944, pp. 420‚Äì428.

In November 1918 she spent thirty days in jail for selling a pamphlet to a Vice Society member. There she met Agnes Smedley, a political dissident.

She returned to England briefly to see the unveiling of a statue of Mrs. Pankhurst, but because of this trip she was dismissed from the Birth Control Review. When she came back to the United States, she started working at the Speech Improvement Project at the WPA where she helped children learn English. Marion died in the Sanger Nursing Home in New York City on 9 October 1944. Notes References *Engelman, Peter C.

Early life  He was born 24 May 1774 in Dublin, descended of an ancient Catholic family from Co. Westmeath, the Magans of Umma-more (Emoe). His grandfather, James Magan, established a medical practice in Dublin, where he was succeeded by his eldest son, Richard. Thomas Magan, James's second son, became a woollen draper, establishing himself at 49 High Street, Dublin. Active politically, Thomas represented Dundalk at the Catholic Convention of 1792. He was named wool draper and mercer to King George III in 1794, an honorary title he probably owed to his friend Francis Higgins, a notorious scoundrel known as the \\"Sham Squire\\", owner of a well-known government \\"print\\" (newspaper), The Freeman's Journal. Magan was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin in 1788, although he did not attend before 1791. He joined the College Historical Society but was never active. In May 1794, he signed the oath of loyalty to the British monarch required of any Catholic barrister and went to London to study at Lincoln's Inn. Career Returning to Dublin in 1796, he was admitted to the Irish Bar, the King's Inns, in Michelmas term. The published records of the King's Inns state that he had been employed in the Irish revenue service. Magan's historical notoriety originates from a single act. During April‚ÄìMay 1798 he informed the British government several times of the whereabouts of Lord Edward Fitzgerald on Thomas Street, just as the latter prepared to take the field at the head of thousands of Croppies during the 1798 Rising. Lord Edward's arrest on 19 May deprived the United Irishmen of their most charismatic leader, on whose head the British had put a price of ¬£1,000, equivalent to ¬£1.5m in 2015. Magan passed this to the Castle without being discovered or even suspected during his lifetime, probably because of his otherwise unremarkable life. He had found out Lord Edward's whereabouts through his involvement with the United Irishmen, being a member of to its committee responsible for Dublin. He hosted a meeting of this committee on the night of 17 May 1798. Lord Edward attended and may have passed the night in Magan's house. Magan sold this information on to Dublin Castle the next day, provoking Major Sirr with a body of soldiers to apprehend Lord Edward as he departed from the rear of 20 Usher's Island at dusk. Given further information by Magan, Sirr found Lord Edward suffering from fever in 153 Thomas Street and shot him during a struggle, and he died in Newgate Prison, Dublin, some days later. It was only with the publication of WJ Fitzpatrick's Secret Service Under Pitt a century later in 1892 that Magan was unveiled as the traitor. Francis Higgins was paid the ¬£1,000 for betraying Lord Edward, and Magan got ¬£300 a year. A fortune bequeathed by one Francis Magan led to the foundation of St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, Dublin in 1857.

Constantly torn between art and church, he traveled much in Europe, later establishing himself in Amsterdam. Married to the daughter of a member of the Zeeland parliament, he joined the Salvation Army and traveled from place to place in France, preaching and playing organ. He was also considered a very good draftsman and watercolorist whose works often inspired his own musical pieces. His orchestral works frequently lean towards French Impressionists like Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. Life =Family and education= Gerard von Brucken Fock (also known as Geert) was born as Gerardus Hubertus Galenus Fock in the Ter Hooge castle, Koudekerke, in the outskirts of Middelburg where he spent the summers of his early childhood. His father was Henri Dignes von Brucken Fock and his mother Johanna Caland. He had three brothers, one of them being Abraham Emilius von Brucken Fock, a soldier who later acquired fame as a composer as well. Less than four years later his father changed his name to \\"von Brucken Fock\\". He grew up in the province of Zeeland as the child of a wealthy family, and although he never had to work he did attend his secondary school in Middelburg. In 1877 he attempted to join the Royal Military Academy in Breda, but gradually changed his mind. He took piano lessons with professor Theodorus Leonardus van der Wurff (1836‚Äì1900) and studied music composition with the famous composer Richard Hol, who taught him the principles of harmony between 1877-1879 in Utrecht, played viola in ensembles and maintained contacts with prominent musicians from the Utrechtsch Orchestra with whom he toured in Middelburg. He then decided to continue with his studies in music and moved to Berlin in September 1879 to take lessons with the renowned pedagogue and composer Friedrich Kiel and composition with professors Woldemar Bargiel and Ernst Rudorff. After moving from one place to another from 1883, visiting Dresden, Prague, Vienna and the German island of Borkum, he returned to Middelburg in 1885 and married Maria Johanna Pompe van Meerdervoort, daughter of a member of the Zeeland parliament. After a stay in Paris and in Eversdijk, in south Beveland where his parents were then living, he finally settled with her in Amsterdam in 1888 where they lived until 1889. His summers he used to spend in Domburg, where he had contacts with Jean Theodoor Toorop and other painters of his time. =Career= In Amsterdan he was a longtime director of the Remonstrant choir, and also composed much, constantly torn between art and church, between the ideas of Henrik Ibsen and Leo Tolstoy. Inspired by his own stories, he summed up the idea of earning money as a piano teacher in Leipzig. He then commissioned his banker to represent him all over money matters and take care of his finances selling everything he had, after which the couple traveled to Germany. But this adventure from 1891 soon would turn out to be a complete failure. He tried for a couple of days to work as a farm laborer on the farm of his wife's uncle near Kruiningen, but on his first attempt to use the scythe he cut himself in the fingers. He then traveled back to Paris, to where his wife, after much struggle, followed. He then became a volunteer for the Salvation Army and from 1892 to 1895 they walked the streets throughout France and Switzerland evangelizing the people with a portable organ. During this period he wrote and harmonized just songs for the Salvation Army. In 1895 Von Brucken Fock took his temporary dismissal from the Salvation Army, picked up the thread of composing again in 1898 and composed Impromptu: Le Gironde for piano, later released as Opus 12. This is only one of his many works inspired by nature. His paintings, drawings and watercolors contain the same themes of landscapes, dunes and sea, as evidenced by titles such as Domburg Bathing beach (1886) and A quiet Western Schelde (1890). Gehard Von Brucken Fock left France and settled with his wife again in Amsterdam, where they continued to live until 1904, apart from a few brief interruptions. But in him there was a desire for evangelism. Several times he left the Salvation Army for the Free Evangelical Church. In 1898 he decided to establish a 'Hallelujah' movement in the spirit of the Salvation Army, but without the military dictatorship. He composed many musical pieces, including his Christmas Cantata (1900) and the Easter Cantata (1901). During a short stay in Walcheren, he was inspired to write his 24 Preludes for Piano (1900‚Äì1901), following the example of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. From 1904 to 1912 Gerard and his wife lived in Aerdenhout, a period which was interrupted by a brief stay in Berlin between 1905-1906. After having lived in Paris between 1912‚Äì1913, they moved to Laren and then to Katwijk aan Zee. In Laren, he wrote a book about the impending kingdom of God on Earth, that he sent to an interested publisher, but he asked the manuscript back. Middelburg music publisher Anthony Noske approached him shortly in April 1918 in order to push his work ahead, but Gerard politely refused any help saying that he was going through one of his many anti-art periods again. A month later he wrote, however, that an illness of his wife had opened his eyes and that he had decided to return to his former views and lifestyle. Eventually he settled down in Heemstede in 1920 where he stayed until his death. In this last period of his life von Brucken Fock gave some church concerts, but wrote music mainly for himself, fleeing from the company of others. He also worked again in his oratorio The Second Coming of Christ that he had composed around 1905. Shortly before his death, at the age of 75, he completed his requiem, a masterpiece, which he began writing in 1888 and finished in 1933, with a successful premiere one year later. He died at Aerdenhout in 1935, specifying in his will that a fund should be created under his name to promote concerts and art exhibitions each year in the Netherlands. Musical works Gerard von Brucken Fock established his reputation as a composer of piano sonatas, preludes and moments musicaux, which were performed many times during his lifetime. Many of his compositions were published in the Netherlands and abroad, mostly with positive reviews. He was very active as a composer and also as a visual artist. He created a large number of works which shows the influence of, among others, Johannes Brahms, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Franz Liszt and also from his friend Edvard Grieg who called him the \\"Dutch Chopin.\\" The most important part of Gerard Focks repertoire as an artist came about between 1910 and 1920 for he allowed himself to be partially inspired in his compositions by the same topics of his drawings and paintings, the landscapes and the sea. His work is in line with those by Daniel de Lange and Alphons Diepenbrock, and consequently with the Hague School of music, although it has different style influences. He also wrote much religious music, including an oratorio, The Second Coming of Christ (1910), and a requiem (1933).

He has been Professor of Behaviour and Evolution at the University of Sheffield since 1976. Education Birkhead was awarded a Bachelor's degree in Biology from Newcastle University in 1972, followed by a Doctor of Philosophy degree from University of Oxford in 1976 for research on the breeding biology and survival of guillemots Uria aalge supervised by E.K. Dunn and Chris Perrins. He was subsequently awarded a Doctor of Science from Newcastle in 1989. Research and career Birkhead's research on promiscuity in birds redefined the mating systems of birds. Focusing initially on the adaptive significance of male promiscuity and female promiscuity, he later switched to the study of mechanisms and resolved the mechanisms of sperm competition in birds. He provided some of the first evidence of: cryptic female choice in birds; strategic sperm allocation, and he also provided the first estimates of the quantitative genetics of sperm traits in birds. Birkhead's research also resolved the issue of polyspermy in birds and provided the first evidence for morphological sperm selection in the female reproductive tract. His long term study of the population biology of common guillemots on the island of Skomer off Wales has run since 1972, and is currently in need of support. His recent research is on the adaptive significance of egg shape in birds, including the common guillemot whose pyriform egg has long been thought to allow it to either spin-like- a-top or roll-in-an-arc to prevent it rolling off the cliff ledge. However, there is no evidence for either of these ideas. Instead, Birkhead and colleagues have identified the main advantage of a pyriform shape: stability. The pyriform shape makes the egg inherently more stable, especially on the sloping surfaces on which guillemots commonly breed. = Publications = * Nettleship, D. N. & Birkhead, T. R.

Summer Camp's musical style has been described as \\"21st-century alt.pop\\",but also is influenced by 1960s girl groups and 1980s synthpop. The lyrics, written by Sankey, are often quite dark and deal with failed relationships, conflicts, treasure and teenage obsessions. Along with the band's artwork and music videos they also draw heavily from American culture from the 1960s-1980s. Their first EP, Young, was released in 2010. In 2011, they released their debut LP, Welcome To Condale, produced by Pulp member Steve Mackey, a concept album set in the fictional town of Condale. In 2013, they worked with Britpop producer Stephen Street on their self-titled second album. In 2014, they released their soundtrack to Beyond Clueless, a teen movie documentary directed by critic Charlie Lyne. This was followed in 2015 by their third studio album, Bad Love.

The archaeological site of La Galgada in Peru is an example of a ceremonial monument built within the Kotosh Religious Tradition during the preceramic, or Late Archaic period of Andean history. The site itself is located on the eastern bank of the Tablachaca River, the principal tributary of the Santa River.Grieder et al 1988. p. 1. The site is located in the Tauca District of what is now the Pallasca Province of the Republic of Peru.Grieder et al 1988. p. 4. Situated in the mountainous Andean region, it is at a relatively low altitude of 1,100 metres above sea level. The archaeologists who excavated at the site in the late 1970s and early 1980s decided to call the monument \\"La Galgada\\" after the nearest town, a coal- mining settlement about 2 kilometres to the north, although local people instead referred to it as \\"San Pedro\\". The Pre-Ceramic period was a time of change in the Andean region, with communities becoming more sedentary and beginning to construct monumental architecture both in lowland and highland regions. Historical background =The Andean Pre-Ceramic Period= The Lithic Period was followed by what archaeologists have called the Pre-Ceramic Period, or alternatively the Late Archaic Period, and is characterised by increasing societal complexity, rising population levels and the construction of monumental ceremonial centres across the Andean region.Moseley 2001. p. 107. It is the latter of these features that remains the most visually obvious characteristic of the Pre-Ceramic amongst archaeologists, and indicates that by this time, Andean society was sufficiently developed that it could organise large building projects involving the management of labor.Burger 1992. p. 27. The Pre-Ceramic Period also saw a rise in the population of the Andean region, with the possibility that many people were partially migratory, spending much of their year in rural areas but moving to the monumental ceremonial centers for certain times which were seen as having special significance.Moseley 2001. p. 114. The Pre-Ceramic also saw climate change occurring in the Andean region, for the culmination of the Ice Age had led to an end of the glacial meltback which had been occurring throughout the Lithic Period, and as a result the sea levels on the west coast of South America stabilized. Despite these changes, many elements of Andean society remained the same as it had been in earlier millennia; for instance, as its name suggests, the Pre-Ceramic was also a period when Andean society had yet to develop ceramic technology, and therefore had no pottery to use for cooking or storage. Similarly, Andean communities in the Pre-Ceramic had not developed agriculture or domesticated flora or fauna, instead gaining most of their food from what they could hunt or gather from the wild, just as their Lithic Period predecessors had done, although there is evidence that some wild plants had begun to be intentionally cultivated. =Locality= The site around La Galgada was first occupied about 3000 BCE by agricultural communities who constructed small chambers that were different from their houses, presumably in which to perform ceremonial activities. It is clear from the archaeological evidence that they spent more effort in constructing the various ceremonial and mortuary monuments than in homes for themselves, an approach common to most pre-modern societies across the world.Grieder et al 1988. p. 19. Archaeological surveys have established that during the Pre-Ceramic Period, at least 11 settlements had grown up throughout the Tablachaca Canyon, being concentrated on both sides of the river for at least 8 km near to the modern village of La Galgada.Grieder et al 1988. p. 9. This led one of the head excavators, Terence Grieder, to comment that the La Galgada site must be seen as \\"one of the most important ceremonial and burial areas in a larger, well-populated district, which in Pre-ceramic terms must be considered virtually a metropolitan center\\".Grieder et al 1988. p. 11. Architecture At the La Galgada ceremonial site, the most prominent architectural features were the North and South Mounds.Grieder et al 1988. p. 24. Burials Another feature of La Galgada was its use as a mortuary site for the burial of the dead. Archaeologists investigating the site noted that there was both continuation and variation in the practice of human burial at the site, with most variation being in the position of the burials and the way that they had been prepared, whilst there was most continuity in the type of textiles and offerings deposited with the bodies.Grieder et al 1988. p. 76. =F-12:B-2 burial chamber= Burial I, a corpse at the F-12:B-2 tomb in La Galgada. Archaeologists have established the figure to have been a male over the age of fifty, who was flexed on his right side. Surrounding him are cotton bags, baskets and gourd vessels that have been deposited as offerings. In the burial chamber designated as F-12:B-2 by the archaeological team, a man and two women, all of them over the age of 50, were buried, each in a tightly flexed position with their arms crossed on their chest, and positioned on their left side. Once in this position, their bodies had been bound up with cotton cords; for the male, this had consisted of a dark brown cotton cord 1.3 mm in diameter that had unusually been Z-spun rather than plied, implying some special significance. Alternately, the cotton used to bind the female corpses had been S-spun, Z-plied and yellow in color, and tied around them 20 to 25 times. Tufts of human hair had been tucked around the bodies, and particularly around the torso and hips. It is possible that these tufts had belonged to the corpses themselves, who lacked any hair on their heads, instead wearing hats that appeared \\"makeshift\\" in design, as if they had originally been bags and a basket. Noting ethnographic evidence that a number of Andean Indigenous peoples believed that the human soul was especially present in the hair, archaeologist Terence Grieder suggested the possibility that the Pre-ceramic practice of stuffing human hair into the clothing of the corpses might represent \\"a way to keep the spiritually vital hair in contact with the body.\\" Another item found tucked in with two of the bodies was barkcloth, a versatile material made from the bark of certain trees. The male corpse was widely covered in dark brown strips of barkcloth about 3‚Äì4 cm wide, which were inside the strings but outside of the hair tufts, whilst one of the two women also had similar strips, but less than the man.Grieder et al 1988. p. 78. Grieder suspected that the inclusion of this material was because those burying the dead thought that bark cloth had \\"spiritual power\\", a widespread belief that was found across the Pre-Columbian Americas.Grieder 1982. pp. 81-92. Archaeological investigation By the 1960s, La Galgada had become a busy mining town, and the site had come under threat from looters who wanted to dig up the site in search of valuable artefacts. However, the town governor, Teodoro E. L√≥pez Trelles, recognised the importance of the site for its archaeological value, and instituted measures to protect it from looters. In 1969, he gave a tour of the site to Terence Grieder of the University of Texas, who was then involved in the excavations at Patash, and who was sufficiently interested that he decided to investigate at the site following the culmination of the Patash project.Grieder et al 1988. p. vii. In 1976, Grieder and his fellow archaeologist Alberto Bueno Mendoza returned to the site, and after realizing that the site was Preceramic in date - far older than they had previously suspected - began to raise funds for an excavation. In 1978 this began, with the project continuing on until 1985.

It was published on 11 October 2011 by Delacorte Press and was preceded in publication order by The Maze Runner and The Scorch Trials and followed by the series prequels, The Kill Order and The Fever Code. In narrative order, it is the last book in the series. Plot After being held in solitary confinement, Thomas is eventually released by Janson (Nicknamed \\"Rat Man\\"), who is the assistant director of WICKED (World In Catastrophe Killzone Experiment Department) . Janson tells the Gladers (Group A) and Group B that most of their number are immune to the Flare, but some, whose names he reads, are not immune, including Newt The Gladers are offered the chance to remove the mind-control chips in their heads and restore their memories but at the cost of Thomas's ability to communicate telepathically with Teresa and Aris. Only Thomas, Minho, and Newt choose not to undergo the surgery, as they do not trust WICKED, and Thomas does not want to know who he was when he helped go create the maze. All three of them escape from WICKED with the help of Brenda and Jorge before their chips are removed. Brenda and Jorge are revealed to be working for WICKED. Thomas initially feels betrayed, but Brenda convinces him to forgive her. Soon afterward, the Gladers discover that everyone who had undergone the memory restoration abandoned them. Newt gives Thomas a note and tells him to open it \\"when the time is right.\\" The five then travel to Denver to find Hans, a former WICKED researcher who can remove their mind-control chips. There, a man in a black suit directs them to an address, where Gally is waiting for them. Gally has joined the rebel group the Right Arm and explains that WICKED is capturing every Immune that it can find to prepare another cycle of the Trials . He also reveals that in the decaying cities, many live who suffer from the Flare but take the illicit drug Bliss, which slows down the brain's functioning and helps to relieve the pain that Cranks feel from the Flare. The group finds Hans, who removes Minho's control chip. However, WICKED uses Thomas's chip to force him to resist the procedure. Brenda, Jorge, and Minho must hold him down so that Hans to perform the surgery. Afterwards, the group visits a caf√©, where a security guard apprehends Thomas to sell him to bounty hunters, who will take him to WICKED. Janson intervenes in a holographic, sends a police vehicle to rescue Thomas, and tells him that he must return to WICKED \\"to save Newt.\\" Thomas and his friends find out in a note that Newt has been taken to the Cranks. Minho convinces them to go to the Denver Crank Palace to rescue Newt, where they bribe the guards to get in. When they meet Newt, he angrily orders them to leave, and the other Cranks chase them out. Thomas then remembers Newt's note, reads it, and discovers that he had begged Thomas to kill him. Thomas despairs over not having read the note earlier. After returning to Denver, Thomas sees that Newt has succumbed to the Flare. Thomas answers Newt's pleas by shooting him in the head as an act of mercy. The group then discovers that Teresa and the other Immunes have been captured. After knocking out the guards, they discover that the guards were led by Vince, the leader of the Right Arm, who explains that they are infiltrating WICKED's headquarters. Inside, Thomas discovers how Janson tried to use his attempt \\"to save Newt\\" to compile data for the cure by examining the physical structure of Thomas's brain, which would kill him. Thomas is forced to begin the deadly brain surgery but manages to plant a device that disables WICKED's weapons, which allows the Right Arm to begin storming the facility. Thomas wakes up to find a note from Chancellor Ava Paige, the head of WICKED, who explains there are already enough resources from the Trials to make a blueprint for the cure and so his brain is not needed after all. Paige reveals the location of the Immunes \\"sold\\" by the Right Arm to gain access to WICKED, she and gives directions to a \\"safe place\\" in which Thomas should take all of them. Thomas and his friends re-enter the Maze and find the captured Immunes. However, they learn the Right Arm intends to destroy, rather than occupy, WICKED headquarters. Explosions rock the Maze, and falling debris kills some of the Immunes who are inside. Triggered by the commotion, the Grievers come out of storage, but Teresa shows Thomas how to shut them down. However, she dies from falling debris in an effort to save Thomas's life. Fleeing the building, the Immunes escape through a Flat Trans portal that leads to a lush paradise. The epilogue is narrated by Paige. She reveals that after the catastrophic solar flares, the Flare was deliberately created and released by the government as a form of population control. However, the government and WICKED found themselves unable to control the plague. Paige came to realized that they would never be able to find a cure for the Flare and that WICKED's efforts were futile. She realised that the only hope of preventing humanity‚Äôs extinction was for Immunes to start their own society, away from the rest of the world. She devised a plan with Brenda and Jorge to send them to a safe place that they could restore human civilization and so she stated, \\"WICKED is good.\\"  Characters  * Thomas (Named after Thomas Edison): The main protagonist of the series. He is a teenage boy who was a Runner of Group A (the Gladers) before escaping the Maze with his fellow Gladers in The Maze Runner. He continued this by crossing the Scorch in The Scorch Trials, in which he was continuously manipulated by almost everyone, making it hard for him to trust other people again. Thomas escapes from having his memories restored in WICKED's headquarters and becomes entangled in the conflict between WICKED and the Right Arm - a rebel organization that opposes it. During the events in The Death Cure he falls for Brenda. * Teresa (Named after Theresa May): The only female Glader of Group A. In The Scorch Trials she betrays Thomas on WICKED's orders, causing him to distrust her. She volunteers for her memories to be restored and moves with the other Gladers to Denver. She eventually turns against WICKED. She dies after saving Thomas from being crushed by falling debris. * Newt ( Named after Isaac Newton): A Glader who took upon the role of the leader of Group A after their previous leader, Alby, died in The Maze Runner. He is one of Thomas' steadfast companions, alongside Minho. The book reveals that Newt is not immune to the Flare virus and is slowly succumbing to its influence. Eventually, he begs Thomas to kill him, which Thomas does. * Minho: A Glader, and the former Keeper of the Runners of Group A. He was Thomas' fellow Runner back in the Glade and throughout the series becomes Thomas' best friend throughout their Trials, joining him to escape WICKED's attempt to restore their memories and saving the Immunes from the Maze. * Brenda: A Canadian girl who was part of a group of rebels in The Scorch Trials before becoming separated and having to navigate through the Scorch with Thomas. She helps Thomas, Minho, and Newt, escape from WICKED's headquarters and help them remove WICKED's chips from their necks. She and Thomas fall for each other again. * Jorge: The leader of a group of rebels the Gladers met in The Scorch Trials. He has a close relationship with Brenda. Brenda described their relationship as Jorge being \\"like an uncle\\" to her. He was revealed to be working for WICKED, but helps Thomas, Minho, and Newt escape from WICKED's headquarters and remove their chips. He has a habit of mixing his speech with Spanish words. * Aris: The only male member of Group B. He met Thomas in The Scorch Trials. Aris, Thomas, and Teresa are close friends in The Scorch Trials. * Janson (Rat Man): The Assistant Director of WICKED and the book's main antagonist. He is succumbing to the Flare virus, which explains his desperation for a cure. He arranges for the Group A and Group B survivors' memories to be restored, but wants to make them go through the Trials again. Eventually Thomas kills him by strangling him, after Janson and other WICKED members try to recapture the surviving Immunes. * Gally: A Glader of Group A who strictly followed the rules of the Glade and thus became Thomas' adversary in The Maze Runner. He indirectly caused Chuck's death when Chuck intercepted a knife Gally had thrown at Thomas. In this book, he reunites with Thomas and reveals he has been working with the Right Arm, an organization determined to stop WICKED. However, after discovering the Right Arm's true purpose, he left with Thomas and the Gladers to rescue the Immunes in the Maze. * Vince: The leader of the Right Arm, an organization opposed to WICKED. He is Gally's boss. He recruits Thomas to infiltrate the WICKED headquarters and plant a device inside that disables the WICKED's weapons, and then leads the Right Arm's invasion of WICKED. He is strictly dedicated to his cause and brands Thomas and Gally traitors when they attempt to save hundreds of Immunes hidden in the Maze, which is about to be destroyed by the Right Arm. * Lawrence: Vince's assistant who captures Thomas, Minho, Brenda, and Jorge and delivers them to a safe house. After their demands to see \\"the boss\\" Lawrence took them to Vince. He later drops off Thomas near the WICKED headquarters for his plan to plant the explosive device. * Hans: A former WICKED scientist whom Thomas, Minho, Brenda, and Jorge, meet in Denver to help remove the chips from Thomas and Minho. * Ava Paige: The Chancellor of WICKED and the person responsible for managing and organizing the search for a cure of the Flare, including sending teenagers into the Maze to study the minds of Immunes. However, she disagreed with the consequence that the teenagers were being killed. Her character serves as the omniscient voice in the books' Epilogues. She was never seen in the series, but every Epilogue of the three books in the main series, plus The Fever Code, includes an email she writes to her associates. She states a cure for the Flare virus will never be found, that the Immunes are humanity's last hope to restore the dying world, and that WICKED's actions of sending them for Trials are threatening that hope. She serves as an ex-machina in the narrative, saving Thomas from a fatal brain experiment at the last minute, after he was sedated; She instigates and secretly orchestrates his rescue of hundreds of Immunes from the attack on the Maze. She also promises and delivers a paradisaical safe haven for the Immunes. Reception Critical reception for The Death Cure was mixed. Common Sense Media gave the book three out of five stars, commenting that the book's oppressiveness kept it from being more memorable than they wanted it to be. The Deseret News also commented on the book's bleak nature, but praised it as being \\"both conclusive and satisfying\\".

Film adaptation Wes Ball, who directed the previous films in the series, confirmed that, if he returned to direct, the final novel would not be split into two films. In March 2015, T.S. Nowlin was confirmed to write the script. On 9 July 2015 Defy Media revealed that filming was set to begin in February 2016. On 16 September 2015 Variety confirmed that Ball would return to direct the third film. The film began principal photography on 14 March 2016 in Cache Creek, British Columbia. On 19 March 2016, Maze Runner star Dylan O'Brien was critically injured on-set when he was struck by a car during a stunt sequence. On 20 March 2016, director Wes Ball announced production was shut down to allow O'Brien time to recuperate from his injuries. On 22 April 2017, the studio again delayed the release in order to allow more time for post-production. Maze Runner: The Death Cure was released on January 26, 2018.

The program is sponsored by the city government but is patterned after the ‚ÄúPueblos M√°gicos‚Äù (Magical Towns) program of the Mexican federal government. However, one difference is that the city does not require the ‚Äúbarrios‚Äù to make improvements in their appearances to be accepted. The first of the barrios were named in 2011 by city Secretary of Tourism Alejandro Rojas D√≠az Dur√°n. Each of the twenty one named neighborhoods received stylistic scrolls with the accreditation with acceptance by registration in the official newspaper called the Gaceta Oficial del DF. The first to receive its scroll was Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena Atlitic. The twenty one neighborhoods include the historic center of Coyoac√°n, the Roma-Condesa zone, the historic center of Xochimilco, San √Ångel, San Agust√≠n de la Cuevas (historic center of Tlalpan), Santa Mar√≠a la Ribera, Zona Rosa, Garibaldi, Villa de Guadalupe, Mixcoac, Tacubaya, Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena Atlitic, historic center of Azcapotzalco, La Merced, Mixquic, historic center of Cuajimalpa, San Pedro Atocpan, Pueblo Culhuac√°n, Tacuba, Santa Julia and the historic center of Iztacalco. The city's Secretary of Tourism plans on having thirty such neighborhoods, with areas such as the Los Dinamos ecological reserve nominated. The neighborhoods have been declared only on paper as neither the city nor the boroughs have the money to promote them. The program's legality has been questioned by the president of the ALDF Tourism Commission, Carlo Pizano as the designations were made without prior public publication.

Commonly called the century plantMedicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa - John Mitchell Watt, and Maria Gerdina Breyer-Brandwijk (1962) or tumbleweed, Boophone disticha was first collected in 1781 from South Africa by Swedish botanist Carl Peter Thunberg and described by Carl Linnaeus as Amaryllis disticha. Since that time it has been placed in the genera Brunsvigia and Haemanthus, finally coming to rest as Boophone. The genus itself was written in three ways (Boophone, Boophane and Buphane) by the author William Herbert, straining the procedures of the rules of nomenclature. The etymology of the genus is from the Greek = ox, and = killer of, a clear warning that eating the plant can be fatal to livestock. The genus as currently understood includes two or possibly three species. B. disticha is one of the most widely distributed bulbous species in South Africa, readily identified by its fan-like appearance and its bulb half- protruding from the ground. The Khoi, Bushmen and Bantu were aware of its poisonous nature and used parts of the plant medicinally and as an arrow poison. The principal compounds are eugenol - an aromatic, volatile oil smelling of cloves and having analgesic properties, and the toxic alkaloids buphandrin, crinamidine and buphanine, the latter having an effect akin to that of scopolamine and if taken in quantity may lead to agitation, stupor, strong hallucinations and (if over-ingested) coma or death.http://het.sagepub.com/content/20/5/277.abstract This species produces a single inflorescence before the arrival of the season's new leaves. While maturing the fruiting head's pedicels undergo a stiffening process and remarkable elongation to some 300mm. When the fruiting head separates at its junction with the stalk, it is easily moved by light breezes, scattering seeds as it rolls. Native distribution and habitat Boophone disticha is native to Angola, Botswana, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa (in the provinces of Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Western Cape), Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. It grows wild in dry savannas, grasslands, and glades in forests. Uses Boophone disticha has been used locally to make poison for arrow's tips, and in the treatment of equine piroplasmosis. The bulb has a wide range of uses in traditional African medicine.'Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa' - Watt & Brandwijk (1962) It contains alkaloids such as lycorine, buphanine, buphanitine and buphanidrine which have analgesic and hallucinogenic properties. Material from this species' bulb was associated with preservation of the Khoi Kouga mummy found in the Langkloof.

It is one of the first female motorcycle clubs with members throughout the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. They bear \\"colors\\" of pink and black. The club‚Äôs insignia is two flesh-colored women angels with upswept brown and gold wings facing one another. A golden banner, with the 1983 conception date of the club, connects the two angels together in unity. The words, Leather & Lace, is located above the angels. The word, Sisterhood or Forever, is below the angels, with the letters M.C. written in pink and placed on a black background to the right of the banner. Meaning of the insignia: The two flesh-colored angels stand for the women and their femininity. The angels facing each other stand for their camaraderie. The upswept wings stand for freedom. The opposite colors of brown and gold in the wings say they are the same, yet they are individuals. The golden banner brings the angels together and is their common bond of sharing the wind. \\"Leather\\" stands for the inner strength they possess as women and the physical strength they demonstrate in handling their motorcycles. \\"Lace\\" stands for their femininity, an important and intimate part of the Sisterhood. The purpose of the club is to bring women together who have the common bond of riding. The goals of the club are to work together to better the future of all children, to promote the image of women motorcyclists through education and public enlightenment. Leather & Lace MC began when a group of women riders wanted to help children. Initially, membership grew slowly due to the fact that in the early 1980s women riding motorcycles was not as acceptable as it is today. Jennifer Chaffin, founder and President, started Leather & Lace MC in 1983. Chaffin‚Äôs goal was that an all-women motorcycle club will set a peaceful example for the warring men‚Äôs motorcycle (1%) clubs. Through charitable activities and involvement with their communities, Leather & Lace MC members insure the quality of life for all children, their communities in which they live and work, and, increase the public‚Äôs awareness concerning motorcycles and motorcyclists.

It was in surroundings similar to the Fort Washington section. When he decided to build himself a home on [Riverside] Drive he remembered this castle and had his home built accordingly. The castle was designed by John C. Watson and built at the cost of over $500,000.Oteri, Danielle (November 15, 2013) \\"A Neighborhood of Castles in the Sky: Washington Heights before The Cloisters\\" Metropolitan Museum of ArtStaff (January 22, 2010) \\"Patrno's Castle\\" My InwoodHogarty, Dave (May 15, 2012) \\"Cornerspotted: Paterno Castle of Washington Heights\\" Curbed The building's white marble facade featured turrets, and the interior ‚Äì which was entered through a underground passageway that went under the building's front ‚Äì featured a master bedroom which measured 20 feet by 80 feet (6.1m by 25m), as well a cellar dedicated to raising mushrooms, called the \\"mushroom vault\\".

The Paterno Castle, showing the underground passageway (1908) Although the building's facade was medieval, the interior designed was not.

One unique feature of the castle was an antique clock in the entrance hall that, a certain times of the day, operated a $7000 organ located on the second floor gallery, as well as chimes in the castle's tower, which rang on the hour and the half-hour. The organ was expanded a number of times, in 1910, 1911, 1913, and 1927, at the cost of tens of thousands of dollars. When the Castle was slated for demolition, the organ was purchased and donated to St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Glen Cove, New York.Staff (ndg) \\"Dr. Charles V.

The banquet hall and ballroom, each with ceilings, along with a billiard room, were on the third floor. The ballroom had balconies with views of the Hudson. Half of the roof was dedicated to a roof garden with a foot and a half of soil. It featured a large conservatory, an aviary, and a solarium. The grounds featured Italian gardens, greenhouses, colonnades, fountains, and pergolas. At its height, the garage held five Rolls-Royces. Although the mansion was not yet completed, in 1909 Paterno moved in. It was completed in 1916. After he had moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, the castle and most of the rest of the estate was razed by Paterno in 1938 in order to erect the \\"Castle Village\\" complex of co-operative apartments.\\"Demolishing A Castle In New York 1938\\" (video) British Path√© The area was becoming increasingly residential, and The New York Times quoted Paterno as saying that \\"the many improvements in that part of the city ... had led to a strong residential movement in that area with a definite demand for the finer type of garden type apartments.\\" The former Paterno estate guest house at 166 Chittenden Avenue (2013) =Guest House= The former guest house of the estate is a remnant leftover after the estate's redevelopment. Located at 16 Chittenden Avenue at the corner of West 186th Street, the house was built around 1925, and sits on a pier suspended over a sheer drop to the Henry Hudson Parkway and the Hudson River Greenway. It was originally commissioned by Cleveland Walcutt, an engineer, who built it on land he purchased from the estate of the editor of the New York Herald, James Gordon Bennett Jr. The house is sometimes referred to locally as \\"The Pumpkin House\\", because of its orange color when lit up at night. The three- story, , house is configured as a two-family home with separate rental one- bedroom apartment. The main unit includes a parlor floor, a dining room. a library, and a \\"French country\\" kitchen. The living room and balcony afford views of the downtown Manhattan skyline, as well as the George Washington Bridge and the Hudson River. On clear days, the new Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge (Tappen Zee Bridge) connecting Westchester and Rockland counties can be seen to the north. Upstairs are two master bedrooms, two additional bedrooms which can also be used as studies, and two full bathrooms. The house was bought in 2000 for $1.1 million. By 2010 the house had only had four owners, and sold c.2011 for around $3.9 million. In 2016, it was put on the market at the asking price of $5.25 million, and after almost three years, it was sold in January 2019 for $2 million.Carlson, Jen (August 15, 2016) \\"NYC's Incredible Cliffside 'Pumpkin House' Is For Sale\\" GothamistKeil, Jennifer Gould (January 17, 2019) \\"Someone finally bought NYC‚Äôs iconic ‚ÄòPumpkin House‚Äô\\" New York Post Several other remnants of the estate are still extant, but are part of the Castle Village complex. =Retaining wall= One remnant of the Paterno estate is the 75-foot retaining wall, originally built to protect Riverside Drive which now protects the Henry Hudson Parkway. On May 12, 2005, the wall collapsed, resulting a massive landslide which buried the northbound lanes of the parkway and six parked cars. The collapse stopped traffic on the highway for several days, but the clean-up began quickly, and the road re- opened on May 15. However, an entry ramp to the highway remained closed for almost two years. No one was injured. A later study found that the collapse could have been prevented. Reconstruction of the wall, which had been built in 1925, was substantially completed by October 2007, at the cost of $24 million. The access ramp to the Henry Hudson Parkway below the wall was partially reopened in March 2008. All reconstruction on the wall, including the full opening of the access ramp was complete by November 2010.

He is best known for the design of John Shaffer Phipps' (the heir to a U.S. Steel Magnate fortune) home, Westbury House (built 1904-10; additions constructed in 1915-16), at Old Westbury Gardens, in Long Island, New York. Westbury House Westbury House in Old Westbury Gardens by George A. Crawley George Crawley became acquainted with Henry Phipps in Scotland, where in 1903 Crawley was a house guest in the castle that Phipps rented during an extended visit. Phipps showed him the plans for the townhouse he was building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, telling Crawley about his dissatisfaction with the architects' work. Crawley took an interest in the project and made recommendations for a redesign, leading Phipps to invite him to New York City and ultimately to hire him to complete the design of the house.MacKay et al., p. 129 Henry Phipps' son, John \\"Jay\\" Phipps, developed an appreciation for Crawley's design ideas while working with him on aspects of his father's Manhattan house, leading him to ask Crawley to undertake the design of a country estate house for the tract on Long Island that he had purchased in 1901. Because Crawley was not formally trained as an architect, the Phipps family contracted with Grosvenor Atterbury to work with Crawley on technical aspects of designing the new home, which was named Westbury House (now Old Westbury Gardens). The collaboration of the two architects did not go smoothly, but the project was completed successfully. The overall plan of the home and the decorative details are credited to Crawley, while Atterbury provided scale drawings and construction plans.MacKay et al., pp. 129‚Äì130 Crawley's design for the home included works by English artists with whom he was associated, including wood carvings by sculptor Francis Derwent Wood. Crawley played a major role in landscape design for the surrounding property, as well as additions and renovations that were made to the home after John Phipps and his family moved in.MacKay et al., pp. 131 Other works Crawley is credited with designing additions to Old Surrey Hall, a listed building in Dormansland, Surrey, England.

Life Eisenbach studied history briefly at the Jewish Educational Seminary in Vilna and then at the Warsaw University under Marceli Handelsman. Afterwards, he worked at the Society for Jewish Health Care in Poland (Towarzystwo Ochrony Zdrowia Ludno≈õci ≈ªydowskiej w Polsce, TOZ). He married the sister of a fellow historian, and later ghetto chronicler, Emanuel Ringelblum. After the Nazi invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 Artur, along with his wife and child, escaped to his wife's hometown in the east, the small town of Buczacz (now Buchach, Ukraine). However, as a consequence of the Nazi-Soviet pact known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty, on 17 September the Soviet Union also invaded Poland and Buczacz fell within the Soviet occupation zone. Along with 1,200,000 other Poles, Artur Eisenbach was deported deep within the Soviet Union. His wife and daughter stayed behind. In July 1941, after the Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Buczacz was taken over by the Germans. Eisenbach's wife and daughter subsequently were murdered by the Nazis. Eisenbach returned to Poland from the Soviet Union in 1946 and settled in Warsaw. In the same year he became the chief archivist of the Jewish Historical Institute (JHI) in Warsaw. He was a member of the PPR Polska Partia Robotnicza, the communist party in Poland from 1942 to 1948, and after 1948 member of the reconstituted PZPR (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza). In 1966, Eisenbach became the director of the JHI and joined the Polish Academy of Sciences. In 1968, he was persecuted by the communist authorities of the People's Republic of Poland during the anti-Zionist events in the aftermath of Israel's Six Day War 1968 Polish political crisis (\\"the March events\\") and forced to resign as director JHI. Unlike many other Poles of Jewish background who left Poland after these events, Artur Eisenbach chose to remain in the country and continued his studies. Subsequently, he also wrote a series of monographs on Polish Jewish history. He was a historical consultant on film Austeria by Kawalerowicz in 1982. Eisenbach emigrated to Israel towards the end of his life, in 1987, where he worked at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Yad Vashem. Facing terminal illness, he committed suicide in 1992.

During a local tournament Filarski was invited to a tryout for the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in Chicago, Illinois. She made the trip and accepted an offer contract because the money was so much better than she could make in the factory.Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball Filarski entered the league in 1945 with the Rockford Peaches, playing for them two years before joining the Peoria Redwings (1947), Kenosha Comets (1947) and South Bend Blue Sox (1948‚Äì1950).1945 Rockford Peaches.

In 1946, Filarski was the best defensive player at third base with a .932 fielding average. Her most productive season as a hitter came in her last year, when she posted career numbers in batting average (.209), extrabases (12) and on-base percentage (.314). Eventually, she also traveled to San Juan, Puerto Rico for a baseball tournament. Filarski did not return to the league after marrying Donald Steffes in 1951. The couple raised six children, four boys and two girls. She continued to be active in sports by coaching her children's teams, and also coached a softball team in Mount Clemens, Michigan for 30 years, extending her coaching knowledge into the early 2000s. In addition, her hobby activities included photography and playing basketball and bowling. In 1988, Filarski became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

The affair was exposed by the Louis Blom-Cooper Royal Commission, following the discovery that several murders in Colombia had been perpetrated with Israeli guns that had been shipped through Antigua and were ostensibly for the Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force, which is equipped for free by the United States. After the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Gal√°n on 18 August 1989, Colombian police raided the home of cartel leader Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gacha, where they discovered hundreds of Israeli-made Galil rifles including the one that had killed Galan. Colombia sought an explanation from Israel and it was revealed the rifle was part of a consignment of 100 Uzi submachine-guns, 400 Galil assault-rifles and 200,000 rounds of ammunition that had been sold and shipped by Israel to the Antiguan government. On receipt of this explanation, the Colombian government issued a formal protest note to the government of Antigua. Vere Bird Sr. asked the Governor-General of Antigua to appoint a Royal Commissioner to investigate and, on advice from the British Foreign Office, he duly appointed Louis Blom-Cooper. The Royal Commission under Blom-Cooper uncovered an international conspiracy to ship arms from Israel to Colombia via Antigua. Background In 1983, Maurice Sarfati, a Lebanese-born Israeli, started a melon farm on Antigua on the approval of Vere Bird Jr, whom he cultivated a friendship with. The financing and land for the melon farm was provided by co-conspirator Bruce Rappaport. Between October 1984 and 1987, Sarfati was appointed to a number of governmental positions, including managing director of the State-owned airline. The melon farm was expanded thanks to a series of promissory notes issued by the Antiguan Government, totalling US$4m. Sarfati set up a credit arrangement at the melon farm which allowed certain VIPs to withdraw US$1,000 in cash. Sarfati's secretary was directed to transfer payments of US$5,000 at a time to Vere Bird Jr and his wife. By 1988 the melon farm was US$7 million in debt. In September 1988, Sarfati, along with Yair Klein (a retired IDF Colonel with links to Gacha) and Bruce Rappaport, presented a proposal to the Antiguan government (on behalf of Klein's security company Spearhead Ltd.) for a mercenary training camp designed to train ‚Äòcorporate security experts, ranging from the executive level to the operational level, and bring them to the highest professional capacity in order to confront and defuse any possible threat‚Äô which was to be run by Klein. There was also to be a speciality shop where, at the end of the course, those trained at the camp could purchase arms and ammunition. Shipment In an attempt to get out of bankruptcy, Sarfati, who was now living in Miami, and Klein contacted Pinchas Schahar (a retired Brigadier-General, then a representative of Israel Military Industries (IMI)). Klein placed an order for US$324,205 worth of Uzi submachine-guns, Galil assault rifles and ammunition on behalf of the Antiguan government, which was paid through various bank accounts belonging to the conspirators including Banco Aleman-Paname√±o; Philadelphia International Bank; Manufacturers Hanover Trust; Bank Hapoalim of Israel; and American Security Bank of Washington, DC.US Congress, Committee on Governmental Affairs (1991) Arms Trafficking, Mercenaries, and Drug Cartels, Hearing, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, 102nd Cong., 1st Sess., 27 and 28 February, pp. 127-130 Sarfati produced forged documents showing that he was an authorised representative of the Antiguan government and that the purchase of weapons had been approved by the Antiguan Minister for National Security Vere Bird Jr, though that position did not exist. Concerns were raised at the Blom-Cooper Commission as to why questions weren't asked about why the Antiguan government dealt with IMI through Schahar instead of directly, as is common with governments, and why the Antiguan government was buying significantly more guns than there were men in the Antiguan Defence Force and even more than the US equipped it with for free. The weapons were loaded on the Danish ship Else TH, which sailed from Haifa on 28 March 1989, bound for Chile via the Panama Canal. It reached St John's, Antigua, on 24 April and unloaded a container carrying the guns. The Else TH was primarily loaded with weapons for government troops in South America, including Colombia, and Antigua was a convenient first stop. However whilst the Else TH was at sea, Diego Viafara Salinas, Gacha's personal physician, had defected to the Colombian security services and had produced a video apparently showing Klein running training camps for Gacha's cartel forces. This meant that the training school on Antigua could no longer be used to launder the guns for Gacha but because the shipment had already been paid for, Klein and Sarfati diverted a Medellin- owned ship, the MV Seapoint, from Haiti to Antigua to pick up the container with the guns to be delivered to Gacha. The container sat unguarded on the dockside for seven hours before the MV Seapoint arrived and collected it, before dumping it on a deserted beach in north-west Colombia where the ship also picked up a 2¬Ω ton shipment of cocaine. Aftermath Following the report of the Commission, there were protests in Antigua with signs proclaiming \\"The Birds Must Go,\\" which resulted in Vere Bird Jr resigning as Minister of Public Works. He was also barred from holding public office. Klein was put on trial at the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court for three counts of exporting military equipment and expertise without the requisite licenses. Klein pleaded guilty and was convicted in late November 1990. During the trial, he explained that he pleaded guilty \\"to put an end to the witch hunt running rampant in some of the press, based on rumours and speculation which are harming the state and me.\\" He claimed he had acted \\"in good faith and in the belief that my actions were within the law.\\". Walker was dismissed by Vere Bird Sr from his position as ADF commander.

The company produces light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty engine brakes, recreational vehicle exhaust brakes, aftermarket parts and tune-up kits to heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers in its domestic market in America, as well as in Asia and Europe. The company was incorporated in 1990 and is based in Bloomfield, Connecticut. Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Inc. operates as a subsidiary of Altra Industrial Motion Corporation.https://www.nasdaq.com/article/altra-industrials-unit-to-merge-with-fortives-as-business-cm1027557  History  The Jacobs Engine Brake has been on the market since 1961, better known as the ‚ÄúJake Brake‚Äù. The value of an engine retarder had been recognised many years earlier. In England in 1905, the motor car manufacturer Rover provided on its \\"16-20\\" model an auxiliary camshaft and modified exhaust cams which, when selected via a camshaft pedal, lifted the exhaust valve twice to every revolution of the shaft, causing air to be taken in from the exhaust pipe on every downward movement of the piston, compressed on the upward stroke, and then exhausted. Rover declared that \\"the braking effect of this device is very pronounced - in fact, for all ordinary purposes it can be used without recourse to the friction brakes\\". Some 26 years later, and despite the advances in friction braking, the need for such a system was experienced by inventor Clessie L. Cummins. In August 1931, Clessie Cummins, Ford Moyer, and Dave Evans driving a Cummins diesel powered Indiana truck from New York to Los Angeles attempted to set a new truck speed record across the continent. All went well until the descent of the Cajon Pass leading into San Bernardino, CA, a long and steep gravel road which almost led to the demise of the truck and its driver, Clessie Cummins. In 1955, Clessie began studying what might be done to turn his engine into an effective ‚Äúbrake‚Äù, or vehicle retarder. An idea for a practical method came to Clessie in 1957. The idea revolved around taking advantage of perfectly timed motion already built into Cummins and Detroit Diesel engines; these engines have a third cam on the main camshaft that activates the fuel injector of each cylinder. A simple retrofit mechanism could transfer motion to open the exhaust valve. A patent was ultimately granted by the U.S. Patent Office. Although the principles were proven by mechanically transferring the injector motion, a more practical method was to use a fully hydraulic motion and force transfer. The first retarder housings of the prototype design were installed on a Cummins diesel engine in a truck owned and operated by the Sheldon Oil Company. The initial run with the engine brake was to one of their plants just at the eastern base of the grade, down the Sierras on U.S. Highway 50 near Lake Tahoe. In April 1960, Jacobs Manufacturing Company made the decision to establish its new Clessie L. Cummins Division, (now named Jacobs Vehicle Systems) for the manufacture of the engine brake. The first production units for the Cummins NH series engines left the factory in 1961, followed shortly by a brake for the Detroit 71 series. The firm split in 1986 and chuck manufacturing now takes place in Clemson, South Carolina and engine brake production in Bloomfield, CT.  How A Jake Brake Works  A ‚ÄúJake Brake‚Äù is an engine compression release brake used especially for steep hill downgrades. The Jake Brake opens the exhaust valves when the piston is near top dead center (where ignition normally occurs). On the upstroke, the piston compresses the air in the cylinder to 1/15th its original volume, which creates drag on the engine. The Jacobs Engine Brake then releases the compressed air and the energy stored in it before it can push back on the piston during the down stroke. The Jake Brake turns a power producing engine into a power absorbing air compressor and in turn, causes the truck to slow down. Inside of the truck, the driver can choose how many cylinders to activate; the more cylinders activated, the more slowing of the truck.  Jacob Vehicle System Technologies  =Exhaust Brakes= Uses back pressure to increase braking power by restricting the flow of exhaust gasses and increasing backpressure inside the engine. The increased backpressure in the engine creates resistance against the pistons, slowing the crankshafts rotation and helping to control the vehicle speed. =Bleeder Brakes= The bleeder brake is a simplified version of traditional engine brakes. When the bleeder brake is turned on, a piston extends to its full stroke and stays there, holding the exhaust valve open a small, fixed distance throughout the entire four-stroke engine cycle. Since the bleeder brake only holds the exhaust valve open a fixed distance, it can be designed so that is does not put any load on the camshaft and most of the overhead components. =Compression Release Brakes= When activated, the Jacobs Engine Brake opens the exhaust valves near the top of the compression stroke, releasing the highly compressed air through the exhaust system. Little energy is returned to the piston, and as the cycle repeats, the energy of the trucks forward motion is dissipated, causing the truck to slow down. =Variable Valve Actuation= Allows for real-time adjustment to valve opening and closing for precise control of valve motion. By creating a hydraulic link between the cam and the valve, VVA tunes the engine across its operating range. =High Power Density= Provides large displacement retarding power in small and medium displacement engines. HPD consists of two dedicated rocker arms and two collapsible bridges per cylinder, which enables a second braking event during each engine cycle.

It originated as part of the Stiftstidende dailies; with two other Stiftstidende newspapers published in Aalborg - Aalborg Stiftstidende founded in 1767 -, and Odense - Fyens Stiftstidende started in 1772. Until 1927, the publishing company of Aarhuus Stiftsbogtrykkerie owned and published the paper. Between 1918 and 1952, Louis Schmidt served as the editor-in-chief. √Örhus Stifstidende serves for Jutland. The paper has no official political affiliation, but has a liberal political leaning. It is published in broadsheet format. On 1 January 2007, √Örhus Stifstidende merged with other local newspapers in Midtjylland to form the editorial company of Midtjyske Medier, a branch of Berlingske Media.Midtjyske Medier In late 2015, Midtjyske Medier was sold and fused with Jysk Fynske Medier, the second largest mediagroup in Denmark by turnover.Midtjyske Medier bliver nedlagt √Örhus Stiftstidende used to publish the free local weekly newspaper Aarhus Onsdag (Aarhus Wednesday) and the cityguide website AOA, Alt Om Aarhus (All About Aarhus).

Life  He was the son of Henry I and reigned from 1287 to 1289 together with his brother John III. During his father's absence (his father had been taken prisoner while on a crusade) from 1275 to 1302, Mecklenburg was ruled by his mother Anastasia jointly with Henry's uncles Nicholas III (until 1290) and John II (until 1283). In 1287, Henry II became co-regent with his mother and uncle. When his father died in 1302, Henry II became Lord of Mecklenburg. Early in his reign, he conducted an unsuccessful war against Nicholas II of Werle about the succession of Henry I. Around 1299, the sons of his father-in- law Albert III of Brandenburg died and Albert gave (or sold) him the Lordship of Stargard, which Albert had earlier promised to give as dowry to his daughter Beatrix (Henry II's wife). In the 1304 Treaty of Vietmannsdorf, it was once again agreed that Brandenburg enfeoffed Henry II with the Lordship of Stargard. Nevertheless, when Beatrix died without a male heir in 1314, Brandenburg demanded that Stargard be handed back. This led to the so-called \\"North German Margrave War\\". in 1299, an alliance of Henry II of Mecklenburg, Nicholas II of Werle and Albert III of Brandenburg-Salzwedel tried to conquer the Principality of Rostock. Lord Nicholas I of Rostock put his country in 1300 under the feudal rule and protection of King Eric VI of Denmark. Eric defeated Henry and then took Rostock for himself. In 1304, a new alliance, consisting of Henry II and Albert's successor Herman came to the aid of king Wenceslaus II of Bohemia in his war against Emperor Albert I. In this war, Henry earned his nickname \\"the Lion\\". In 1310, he began a war against the Hanseatic cities of Wismar and Rostock. The trigger for this war was the refusal of Wismar to host the wedding of Henry's daughter Matilda with Duke Otto III of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. Henry III then chose Sternberg as his residence and held the wedding there. Wismar submitted to Henry in 1311 and he continued his attack on Rostock. On 15 December 1312, he took the city, despite fierce resistance. The city rose up again in 1313, when Henry was undertaking a pilgrimage to the Madonna del Rocca church in Castelmola. On 12 January 1314, Rostock was subdued again and the old city council, led by Bernhard Kopman, was restored to power. In 1315, the so-called \\"North German Margrave War\\" broke out, against Brandenburg and the city of Stralsund. Brandenburg, now led by Margrave Waldemar, invaded the disputed Lordship of Stargard. Henry besieged Stargard, but had to break off his siege in July 1316. He defeated Waldemar in the Battle of Gransee and was finally awarded the Lordship of Stargard in the Treaty of Templin of 25 November 1317. In 1319 Henry and Count Gerhard III of Holstein-Rendsburg tried to subdue Ditmarschen, but were unsuccessful. Ditmarschen won the Battle of W√∂hrden, where Henry escaped with difficulty. Later that year, Waldemar died and Henry II conquered Prignitz and the Uckermark. In 1323, Rostock revolted again, and Henry subdued the city again and made peace with King Christopher II of Denmark on 21 May 1323. Christopher enfeoffed him with the Lordships of Rostock, Gnoien and Schwaan. The new Margrave Louis I of Brandenburg, or rather his guardian Count Berthold VII of Henneberg-Schleusingen, reconquered Prignitz and the Uckermark and Henry had to settle for an unfavourable peace treaty on 24 May 1325. After the last Prince of R√ºgen, Wizlaw died on 10 November 1325, the first War of the R√ºgen Succession broke out. It ended after fierce fighting with the Peace of Brudersdorf of 27 June 1328, in which Pomerania acquired R√ºgen and Mecklenburg had to settle for a monetary compensation. Henry II died on 21 January 1329.  Marriage and issue  Henry's first marriage was to Beatrix of Brandenburg (died: before 25 September 1314), the daughter of Margrave Albert III of Brandenburg. They had one daughter: * Matilda (1293-1357), married in 1311 with Duke Otto III of Brunswick-L√ºneburg His second marriage, after 6 July 1315, was to Anna of Saxe-Wittenberg (died between 25 June 1327 and 9 August 1328), the daughter of Duke Albert II of Saxe-Wittenberg and Agnes Habsburg, daughter of Rudolph I of Germany. They had the following children: *Ludgarda (1310-1362), married Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Bytom * Henry (1316-1321) * Anastasia (1317-1321) * Albert II (1318-1379), nicknamed The Great, who succeeded Henry as Lord of Mecklenburg, and in 1348 became the first Duke of Mecklenburg * Agnes (1320-1340), married on 6 January 1338 with Lord Nicholas III of Werle-G√ºstrow * John I (1329-1392), Lord of Mecklenburg and from 1348, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard * Beatrix of Mecklenburg, (born: 1324; died: 5 August 1399), abbess of the Ribnitz Monastery (1348-1395) His third wife was Agnes, the daughter of Count Ulrich of Lindow-Ruppin (died: after 30 July 1343). This marriage remained childless. After the death of Henry, Agnes married Rudolf I, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg.

The group was founded in 2009, in order to campaign for a change in the law and advocate on behalf of adults of sound mind, who are either terminally ill or incurably suffering. In 2019, alongside other leading right-to-die societies, My Death, My Decision co-founded the Assisted Dying Coalition. It is also a longstanding member of the World Federation of Right to Die Societies.  History  Established in 2009, My Death, My Decision was founded by the ex-Chair and former board members of Dignity in Dying, in response to the organisation‚Äôs decision to limit its campaign and solely focus on assisted dying for the terminally ill. Prior to 2009, there had been two main assisted dying organisations in the United Kingdom; Dignity in Dying (previously known as the Voluntary Euthanasia Society) representing England and Wales, and Friends at the End based in Edinburgh. In 1935 the Voluntary Euthanasia Society was formed by a group of preeminent doctors, theologians, and lawyers - including Dr Charles Killick Millard, and Lord Moynihan. The stated aim of the society was to campaign for a change in the law and build support for the view that adults suffering from an illness ‚Äòfor which no cure is known, should be entitled by law to the mercy of a painless death if and when that is his express wish‚Äô. Shortly afterwards, in 1936 Lord Ponsonby introduced legislation, for the first time, which would have legalised assisted dying for adults who were either terminally ill or incurably suffering but the law did not pass. Throughout the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s the society remained active and continued in its efforts to secure reform. In 1961 the crime of suicide was formally abolished, and a series of legislative reforms including the suspension of the death penalty in 1969 and David Steel‚Äôs Abortion Law Reform in 1967 suggested a growing movement in support of individual freedom. This movement culminated for the Voluntary Euthanasia Society in 1969, when Lord Raglan unsuccessfully attempted to introduce legislation, for the second time, which would have legalised assisted dying. During the 1970s the organisations briefly changed its name to ‚ÄòEXIT‚Äô before reverting back to the ‚ÄòVoluntary Euthanasia Society‚Äô, and in 1981 it reaffirmed its commitment to promote legislation to allow adults suffering from a severe illness to which no relief was known, to receive an immediate painless death, if that was the patient‚Äôs expressed wish. Over the years, the society increased its efforts to secure reform of the law and commissioned opinion polls, lobbied politicians, campaigned for reform, and prepared draft legislation for the legalisation of assisted dying. By the 1990s and early 2000s, the society had elected Dr. Michael Irwin, a former Medical Director for the United Nations as Vice-Chair and then Chair until 2003. During his tenure, Dr Irwin helped to draft Lord Joffe‚Äôs 2003 Patient (Assisted Dying) private members bill, which sought to legalise assistance to die for adults suffering unbearably from either a terminal or serious and progressive illness; as well as defending Dr Dave Moor, who in 1990 was the first British doctor to be accused and acquitted of murder for complying with a patient‚Äôs wish to be injected with a lethal dosage of the pain-killer diamorphine. Then in 2005, when the Voluntary Euthanasia Society changed its name to ‚ÄòDignity in Dying‚Äô, it also refined its goals so as to campaign solely for a change in the law to allows those who were terminally ill the option of an assisted dying \\\\- and this later came to be interpreted as campaigning for those with a prognosis of 6 or fewer months left to live. In response, Dr Irwin, Angela Farmer, Nan Maitland, and Liz Nichols (all former board members of Dignity in Dying) founded the ‚ÄòSociety for Old Age Rational Suicide‚Äô to stand up and advocate on behalf of adults suffering from non-life threatening but incurable and intolerable illnesses, who would otherwise fail be represented by a right-to-die organisation. In 2015, the organisation changed its name to ‚ÄòMy Death, My Decision‚Äô and restated its aim to secure a change in the law which would enable adults of sound mind, who were either terminally ill or incurably suffering, to decide the manner and moment of their own death. MDMD is a member of the World Federation of Right to Die Societies.  Objectives  The organisation‚Äôs Articles of Association set out its objectives as: * To campaign for a change in the law in the UK to allow medical assistance to die to be given to mentally competent adults, with incurable health problems that result in their perceived quality of life falling permanently below the level they are able to accept, providing this is their own persistent wish. The organisation also advocates the use of Advance Decisions (otherwise known as ‚Äúliving wills‚Äù), and to create a forum for people who support the moral case of extending assistance to die to those who are incurably suffering.  Activities  = Campaign for Assisted Dying = My Death, My Decision has long supported the rights of those who want assistance to end their own life, and lobbied Parliament for a change in the law which would enable both those who are terminally ill or incurably suffering the option of a safeguarded assisted dying. The organisation believes that there is a strong moral case to extend assisted dying to adults facing years of permanent and unbearable suffering, and cites changes in the law in Belgium, Canada, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland as evidence in support of its position. In March 2019, the organisation commissioned a poll from the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) which found that up to 88% of the public favoured assisted dying for either those who were incurably suffering or terminally ill, in at least some circumstances. The research indicated a significant shift in public attitudes in favour of assisted dying for the incurably suffering, and prompted an Member of Parliament, who had previously voted against assisted dying reform, to suggest MPs were at risk of becoming out of touch. In 2019, the group also helped to form the Assisted Dying Coalition, a group of like-minded campaign groups seeking to legalise assisted dying for the terminally ill or incurably suffering. Persistent campaigns include calling for the Government to set up an inquiry into the impact of the Suicide Act 1961 and to investigate jurisdictions which have legalised assisted dying abroad; challenging the use of the ‚Äúforfeiture rule‚Äù (a civil law which can prevent those who compassionately assist someone to die abroad from receiving any inheritance, despite not having criminal charges brought against them); as well advocating the use ‚ÄúStatements of Settled Wishes‚Äù, a new safeguard for assisted dying which would allow someone to pre-register their intention to have an assisted death. Trevor Moore holding open letter to mark the tenth anniversary of Debbie Purdy‚Äôs landmark legal case In July 2019, they organised an open letter to mark the tenth anniversary of Debbie Purdy‚Äôs landmark legal case, which was signed by thirty-four leading doctors, politicians, religious leaders, academics, and campaigners, to urge the Secretary of State for Justice to consider reviewing the law on assisted dying. Although the Secretary of State for Justice had approved a call for evidence into assisted dying, the inquiry was subsequently reversed following David Gauke‚Äôs resignation. = Legal Cases = The non-profit organisation has consistently supported right-to-die test cases to challenge the ban on assisted dying throughout its history. In 2018, it was the first assisted dying organisation to support Omid T, a man suffering from multiple systems atrophy, to bring a legal appeal which sought for the courts to examine an extensive international body of evidence in support of assisted dying. In 2019, after Omid T had ended his life abroad days before judgment in his case was due, they were also among the first organisations to champion Phil Newby‚Äôs successor case and helped it to raise more than ¬£48,000 to challenge the legality of the ban on assisted dying. In 2019, the organisation also supported their longstanding patron Paul Lamb, who is paralysed from the neck down, to bring a fresh right-to-die case; after the Supreme Court had ruled in a 2014 case he had brought, that it would rule again a potential declaration of incompatibility between restrictions on the right to die and the Human Rights Act should Parliament fail to legislate decisively. = Advisory Medical Group = In 2019, in a letter to the British Medical Journal entitled ‚ÄòWhy we‚Äôre campaigning for broader criteria for assisted dying in the UK‚Äù, the best-selling author Dr Henry Marsh, women‚Äôs right advocate Professor Wendy Savage, and acclaimed medical researcher Sir Iain Chalmers challenged campaigns for assisted dying which were restricted to only those with six or fewer months left to live, and called upon Parliament to respect the choices of those facing incurable and intolerable suffering such as Paul Lamb or Tony Nicklinson. Shortly afterwards, the signatories helped to form My Death, My Decision‚Äôs advisory medical group who provide advice on clinical issues, develop and publicise resources, and aim to provide a voice for medics who support patient choice. Many of the group's aims are based on respecting patient autonomy and ending restrictions which prevent doctors and patients from openly discussing all end-of-life options. In 2019, the group secured a commitment from the General Medical Council that doctors who are informed by their patient of an intention to travel abroad for an assisted death, should not feel compelled to breach confidence and inform the police. In 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic in Britain, the group published guidance in the British Medical Journal which urged doctors to respect their patient‚Äôs end-of-life wishes. = Annual Lecturers = My death my decision and friends at the end faith and assisted dying lecture Since 2010, the organisation has hosted an annual lecture from international experts, campaigners, authors, academics, and philosophers on assisted dying reform.

In a career that lasted from 1919 until 1921, Spion Kop ran fourteen times winning two races. After an undistinguished early career in which he lost his first six races, he improved as a three-year-old to win The Derby in record time in 1920. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a stallion. Background Spion Kop, a \\"strong, handsome\\" bay horse with a white blaze and four white socks, was bred by his owner Major Giles Loder who had inherited the Eyrefield Stud near Caragh in County Kildare from his uncle Eustace \\"Lucky\\" Loder in 1914. He was named after the Battle of Spion Kop (1900). Spion Kop's sire Spearmint had been Eustace Loder's most successful horse winning the Derby and the Grand Prix de Paris in 1906. At stud, he was fairly successful, siring Royal Lancer (St Leger), Zionist (Irish Derby) and Plucky Liege. Hammerkop, Spion Kop's dam was a top-class staying racehorse who won the Yorkshire Oaks in 1903 and the Cesarewitch Handicap in 1905, but produced no other winners in a long stud career. Spion Kop was sent into training with Peter Gilpin at his Clarehaven Stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1919: two-year-old season= As the offspring of two slow-maturing stayers, Spion Kop was not expected to excel as a two- year-old in 1919. He failed to win in six starts, but showed some consistency by reaching the frame in all his races, finishing second five times and third once. At the end of the year, in the Free Handicap, a rating list of the leading juveniles, Spion Kop was given a weight of 102 pounds, suggesting that he was at least twenty pounds below top class. =1920: three-year-old season= In the spring of 1920 there were rumours that Spion Kop had made exceptional improvement and was likely to be a major contender for the Derby. On his debut in May he went some way towards substantiating the stories when he won a race at Kempton impressively, and his odds for the Derby were cut to 9/1. He did not run again in public but was instead tried in a private trial race against the best of his trainer's other three-year-olds. He was well beaten by his stable companions, finishing last of the four runners behind Sarchedon, Comrade and Paragon, and a result his odds for the Derby lengthened again. The stable jockey Arthur Smith, who had rejected the eventual winner Grand Parade in the 1919 Derby, was instructed to ride Sarchedon at Epsom, with the mount on Spion Kop being given to the American Frank O'Neill. Spion Kop (foreground) wins the Epsom Derby. The Derby was run on an unusually hot day in front of an estimated crowd of 250,000 including the King and Queen. Spion Kop started at odd of 100/6 (approximately 16/1) in a field of 19 runners. The favourite was the 2000 Guineas winner Tetratema a colt noted for his exceptional early speed but with dubious stamina. Tetratema went into an early lead and set an extremely fast pace as he was challenged by Abbot's Trace (ridden by Steve Donoghue), while O'Neill settled Spion Kop well back in the field. Tetratema dropped back soon after half way and Abbot's Trace led into the straight as Spion Kop made rapid progress from the rear. Spion Kop took the lead three furlongs from the finish and ran on strongly up the straight to win by two lengths from Archaic and Orpheus in a new race record time of 2:34.8. The most dramatic incident of the race occurred in the closing stages when Abbot's Trace was brought down in a collision with Sarchedon, who finished fourth. Spion Kop then attempted to emulate his sire by travelling to France for the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp, a much anticipated event, which, with a first prize of ¬£12,000, was the most valuable race in the world at the time. Having narrowly escaped a fire which destroyed his horse-box, Spion Kop started joint-favourite, but finished unplaced behind Comrade. There were excuses however, as the race was extremely rough, with one report claiming that Spion Kop had been \\"treated like a shuttlecock\\". Spion Kop failed to recover his form in autumn. He prepared for the St Leger by taking on Abbott's Trace in a two-runner race for the Derbyshire Three-Year-Old Plate at Derby and was beaten a short head in a \\"desperate\\" finish. He nevertheless started favourite for the St Leger but finished unplaced behind Caligula. On his final start he was unplaced again behind Orpheus in the Champion Stakes . =1921: four-year-old season= Spion Kop failed to re-establish his reputation in two starts as a four-year-old. He returned to Epsom's Derby meeting for the Coronation Cup but finished well beaten behind Silvern. At Royal Ascot he was moved up in distance to two and a half miles for the Ascot Gold Cup and produced his best performance in over a year by finishing third (promoted from fourth) to Periosteum. There were hopes that he would appear later in the year in the Cesarewitch or the Cambridgeshire Handicap, but he never ran again. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Spion Kop a \\"poor\\" Derby winner. More specifically, they rated him equal with Aboyeur as one of the two worst colts to have won the race in the 20th Century. Spion Kop was not even the best middle distance colt in his own stable, that honour clearly belonging to Comrade. Stud career Spion Kop was retired to his owner's Old Connell Stud, near Newbridge, County Kildare, where he became a \\"respectable\\" sire with a clear tendency to produce runners with stamina. His most notable progeny included Felstead, Kopi (Irish Derby), Bongrace (Doncaster Cup). His son The Bastard won the Yorkshire Cup and, after being renamed The Buzzard was twice the leading stallion in Australia, siring the Melbourne Cup winner Rainbird. Spion Kop died in 1941 and was buried at the Eyrefield Stud.

A volatile pheromone found in rodents such as mice and rats, SBT is excreted in the urine and promotes aggression amongst males while inducing synchronized estrus in females. Binding to MUP Mouse major urinary proteins (MUPs) are responsible for binding to hydrophobic ligands such as the pheromone SBT. SBT binds within MUP-I's barrel-shaped active site, forming a hydrogen bond with a water molecule within the active site, which in turn is stabilized by forming hydrogen bonds with residue Phe56 and another water molecule; this second water molecule also forms hydrogen bonds to residues in the active site, namely Leu58 and Thr39. SBT also forms van der Waals forces with several of MUP-I's residues, including Ala121, Leu123, Leu134, Leu72, Val100, and Phe108. When bound, MUP safely carries SBT through the aqueous environment; once the protein-ligand complex is excreted in the urine, MUP helps prevent SBT decomposition and controls the slow release of SBT over a prolonged period of time, resulting in the physiological and behavioral responses of animals who come into contact with the pheromone.  Synthesis  SBT can be produced from 3-(2-aminoethanethio)-4-methylhex-2-enenitrile; however, it is also possible to synthesize SBT from ethanolamine and 2-methylbutanoic acid, using Lawesson's reagent and microwave irradiation.

E., Higher Consciousness Healing, Positive Health Magazine, August 2010, Issue 173, pages 1-4. Early life Springett grew up as the second child of four born to middle-class German parents. She attended a grammar school in Germersheim, Rheinland-Pfalz. Personal and spiritual growth In her youth, Springett embarked on a quest for self-improvement and spiritual development. First she immersed herself in Western approaches such as psychotherapy and bioenergetics, the latter initiating a Kundalini process in her energy system that has been active until the present day. At the age of 24, her journey led to a Tibetan Buddhist Centre in Heidelberg, Germany. She describes the occasion as being \\"love at first sight\\" and was the start of wholehearted lifelong commitment to Tibetan Buddhism. She started to meditate daily and spent most of her vacations in intensive meditation retreats. A key influential teacher for Springett was Rigdzin Shikpo who, in turn, had been one of the first Western students of Chogyam Trungpa. Rigdzin Shikpo‚Äôs teachings stressed the importance of the heart centre in developing love and compassion. Springett‚Äôs main teacher is Garchen Rinpoche, one of the main tulkus of the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism.Nyamidie, K.E., Higher Consciousness Healing , Positive Health Magazine, August 2010, Issue 173, pages 1-4. Professional life Springett graduated from the University of Heidelberg with a master's degree in Education and later gained postgraduate qualifications in Gestalt therapy, Hakomi therapy and Transpersonal therapy. The first four years of her career Springett taught German to foreigners because this left her plenty of time to spend in Buddhist retreats. At the age of 30 she started working as an addiction counsellor and later as a counsellor for adolescents. She also saw clients in her private counselling practice and at first specialised in eating disorders. Later she branched out to work with psychological and relationship problems more generally. In 1996 Springett‚Äôs Buddhist teachers encouraged her to work as a Buddhist meditation teacher and Tara started to run meditation groups in an ongoing way.Nyamidie, K.E., Higher Consciousness Healing , Positive Health Magazine, August 2010, Issue 173, pages 1-4.

Examples of Springett's web presence are her regular publications online. Discovery of higher-consciousness healing Springett deeply wished that one day she would find a simple and clear method that people can use to overcome their own personal problems reliably and thoroughly. In 1997 her wishes were fulfilled with the discovery of Higher- Consciousness Healing. Springett recalls her breakthrough moment of discovery in the following way. \\"I was sitting in the shrine room of my Buddhist teacher trying to listen to his talk. I could not concentrate, because I was inwardly struggling with a painful feeling of sadness that had been with me for many years. As I had often done before, I prayed for help and ‚Äì lo and behold! ‚Äì this time, my prayer was answered. Suddenly, the method [of Higher Consciousness Healing] ‚Ä¶just \\"popped up\\" in my mind. It was so clear and detailed that I assumed I had read it somewhere and was just remembering it.\\"The Five-Minute Miracle: Discover the personal healing symbols that will solve your problems, Redwheel, Weiser, December, 2009 (HC) (PB), page ix. From that point, Springett spent the next few years working on the method. In 2010, her teacher Garchen Rinpoche approved the practice of Higher Consciousness Healing according to Springett's Web site. Whilst completely in keeping with Tibetan Buddhism, the method is universal in its appeal and can be practised by individuals of all faiths and convictions, even atheists. As Springett had wished, the method has proved highly efficient and effective in addressing all manner of personal problems. In fact, Springett claims that she had never worked with a client who did not achieve significant improvements with their problems within a matter of weeks. She explained the method in her first book Symbol Therapy (2001) and in The Five-Minute Miracle (2009). Subsequent themes in her writing As a body of writing, Springett‚Äôs work can be seen as making certain aspects of Tibetan Buddhism accessible and workable for contemporary, spiritually-inclined audiences. One example theme is that of manifesting wishes. To this topic, she brings the Buddhist-inspired idea of combining our wishes with altruistic motivation as a way of ensuring the wish is both meaningful and will have the individual‚Äôs energies maximally aligned to it. Her book Make Your Dreams Come True (2002) describes how to establish an altruistic motivation and how to deal with obstacles such as setbacks, resentments and the frustrations of an extended waiting time. This book was completely re-written and published with the title Advanced Manifesting ‚Äì Tibetan Buddhist Secrets for Fulfilling Your Dreams in 2011. A third theme is highlighted in the title of her third book Soulmate Relationships (2003, 2012). In keeping with a Buddhist perspective, Springett emphasises the crucial importance of the mutual wish to grow in love as the foundation of a soulmate relationship. She also explains the working of the Buddhist idea of karma in an intimate relationship ‚Äì a dynamic she calls \\"The law of an even deal\\". This law suggests that couple relationships can often be unbalanced in terms of the contributions made by each partner and that this lack of balance are at the basis of all relationship problems. Her perspective is, however, ultimately an optimistic one in that she claims that partners can learn to work positively with this law and other relationship dynamics. More recently, in releasing \\"Enlightenment through the Path of Kundalini\\", Springett writes about the core spiritual development dynamic (Kundalini) that has been active in her energy system for many decades. The book explains the process partly through the words of the Tibetan Buddhist deity Tara and through descriptions of her client work with people suffering from the symptoms of Kundalini syndrome.

They remained in the castle and were besieged by the Governor of Scotland, Regent Arran. However, over 18 months the Scottish besieging forces made little impact, and the Castle finally surrendered to a French naval force after artillery bombardment. The Protestant garrison, including the preacher John Knox, were taken to France and used as galley slaves. Murder of the Cardinal St Andrews castle was the residence of Cardinal David Beaton and his mistress Marion Ogilvy. Beaton's strong opposition to the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, with Prince Edward, later Edward VI of England, the son and heir of Henry VIII of England, had led to the war of the Rough Wooing with England. In 1546, David Beaton imprisoned the Protestant preacher George Wishart in the castle's Sea Tower, then had him burnt at the stake in front of the castle walls on 1 March. Wishart's friends included a group of well-connected Protestant Fife Lairds, some of whom had previously conspired with Henry VIII and his ambassador Ralph Sadler either to capture or assassinate Beaton. On Saturday 29 May 1546, the lairds formed four teams. Norman Leslie, Master of Rothes, and three men, perhaps by disguising themselves as masons when some building work was in progress, got into the castle. James Melville and his companions got in by pretending to have an appointment with the Cardinal. William Kirkcaldy of Grange and eight men gained entry to the castle at the drawbridge and when they were joined by John Leslie of Parkhill, they overpowered the porter Ambrose Stirling, stabbed him and threw his body in the ditch. The genuine masons and the garrison supervised by Kirkcaldy left at the postern gate, where the Cardinal's mistress Marion Ogilvy had recently exited. Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie wrote that Peter Carmichael stabbed the Cardinal in his chamber, or on the spiral stair, in the east blockhouse tower. To deter the Cardinal's supporters in the town led by the Provost, James Learmonth of Dairsie, from attempting a rescue, they hung his body in public view from his window or from the parapet at the front of the castle.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5, part IV part 2, (1836), p. 560, James Lindsay to Wharton, 29 May: Sanderson, Margaret H. B., Cardinal of Scotland, John Donald (1986), 226‚Äì228. The son of the Governor of Scotland, James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran, and second after his father in line to the crown of Scotland, was already in the castle as Beaton's hostage: now he was the pawn of the Fife lairds. John Knox wrote that the defenders covered Beaton's body with salt, wrapped it in lead, and buried it in the Sea Tower of the castle.Knox, John, History of the Reformation, vol.1 (1831), 61. David Lyndsay made the Cardinal's ghost voice this detail in his Tragedie of the Cardinall; \\"Thay saltit me, syne cloist me in a kist.\\"Hadley Williams, Janet, ed., Sir David Lyndsay, Selected Poems, Glasgow (2000), 121. Siege Gunloop at the castle Following the murder, the Protestants took refuge in the castle. These \\"Castilians\\" included; Norman Leslie, Master of Rothes; James Kirkcaldy of Grange; Master Henry Balnaves; and Captain John Borthwick. Regent Arran was forced to delay his response as he was busy at the siege of Dumbarton Castle on the west of Scotland, which he took from the English on 8 July 1546.Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol.21 part 2 (1910) no.6 The Parliament of Scotland at Stirling on 11 June 1546 issued a proclamation that none should sell the Castilians any kind of supplies. The lairds were summoned to plead their case in Edinburgh; they refused and Norman Leslie was declared a traitor. For the time of his captivity, Regent Arran's son was excluded from the Scottish royal succession.see Records of the Parliaments of Scotland (University of St Andrews) William Kirkcaldy of Grange negotiated with Henry VIII in England, offering James Hamilton to become a hostage in England. In September, Henry VIII ordered some supplies to be sent in six ships commanded by William Tyrrell with the military engineer Richard Lee, and that the Lairds should hand over Hamilton to be brought to England (but this was not done).Letters and Papers Henry VIII, vol.21 part 2 (1910), no.122, 123, 134 (2). English intervention was hampered by Scottish diplomacy in peace negotiations. England and France were now at peace. A mission to St Andrews would be a new cause for war between Scotland and England, preventing the 'comprehension' of Scotland in this new treaty. Mary of Hungary believed the Scottish diplomats's chief purpose was delaying English action at St Andrews. Scotland remained at war with the Empire, meaning that there was no redress for piracy, and she sent her envoy, Matthew Strick, to Scotland to clarify the situation.Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol.21 part 2 (1910) no.92, 162. At first at St Andrews, according to Pitscottie, the garrison harassed the countryside roundabout, raising fires and \\"using their bodies in lechery with fair women.\\"quoted, Merriman, Marcus, Rough Wooings, (2000), 215 (here modernised) Regent Arran made preparations for a long siege. Monasteries in Scotland were ordered to pay a tax of ¬£6000 towards the costs of recovering the castle.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.8, (1908), 481‚Äì2 Norman Leslie and Kirkcaldy of Grange with their accomplices were excommunicated for the slaughter of the Cardinal. On 23 November a copy of this \\"great cursing\\" was made and delivered to the Castle.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.9 (1911), xiv, 35 The Scottish siege The countermine today In October 1546 Arran and the Scottish Privy Council met at St Andrews, and siege operations commenced in earnest. A mine, a tunnel to undermine the Fore Tower or enter the castle, was begun by Regent Arran's men. The French ambassador Odet de Selve knew about the mine by 10 November, from an 18-day-old eye-witness account. The defenders dug a successful counter-mine to meet it.Correspondance Politique de Odet de Selve, (1888), p.54, 10 November 1546 Both the mine and counter-mines were cut through solid rock. The tunnels were rediscovered in 1879 and remain open to the public today. The defenders dug three mine tunnels before they reached the attackers. The successful countermine tunnel was started near the Fore Tower outside the walls of the main central enclosure of the castle.Fawcett, Richard, & Tabraham, Chris, St Andrews Castle, Historic Scotland (2001), 6, 18‚Äì19. Arran's guns included \\"Crook-mow\\" or \\"Thrawynmouthe\\", and \\"Deaf Meg.\\"Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (1911), 103: Pitscottie Arran offered terms if the lairds vacated the castle and released his son. The garrison would be conveyed to Blackness Castle. These terms were refused. Arran brought his guns to the 'west trenches' to batter down the Sea Tower, hall, and chapel from the west, and shot at the hall and the chapel from the east with feathered bullets. The defenders shot back and killed the royal gunner John Borthwick, Argyll's master gunner, and other artillerymen. After two days of losses to his gunners the Regent abandoned the cannon.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5, part IV part 2, (1836), 580‚Äì581. In November, Arran heard that an English army was on its way to relieve the Castle and commanded other Fife lairds to support him. John Wemyss of that ilk was ordered to bring his followers and whatever artillery they had to resist a sea-invasion.Fraser, William, ed., Memorials of the family of Wemyss, vol. 3, Edinburgh (1888), 7, (letter 31 October 1546) Provisions sent for the siege in December by boat from Leith included 60 stones of lead taken from the roof of the Great Hall of Holyroodhouse. When supplies were short the defenders made a new exit to the sea in the east wall. Supplies were obtained from the Laird of Montquhany in Tentsmuir Forest, but Walter Melville and twenty men died because of poor rations and bad fish. =The truce of December 1546= Following requests made in person, Henry VIII made plans to assist the Protestants within the castle. He wrote to Arran from Nonsuch Palace on 20 December 1546, requesting Arran to desist from the siege, and threatening to relieve the lairds.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5, part IV part 2, (1836), 572‚Äì584. Balnaves, Leslie and William Kirkcaldy were each given ¬£100 by England's Privy Council.Dasent ed., Acts of the Privy Council, (London, 1890), 527, 556. The English Chancellor, Thomas Wriothesley, told Arran's diplomats in London, David Panter and Adam Otterburn, to ask the Regent to desist from the siege. The grounds given were that the Castilians were Henry's friends and well-wishers to the English marriage. Panter and Otterburn refused, as it was not their business, but sent a note of the request to Arran.State Papers Henry VIII, vol.5 (1836), 575‚Äì576, 21 Dec. 1546. However, a truce or concord was already agreed on 18 December 1546, which Knox described as the 'coloured appointment.' Arran's negotiators were the Lyon Herald, the Justice Clerk, the Provost of Aberdeen, the Earls of Huntly, Argyll, and Marischal, and Lord Gray, who spoke at the walls of the castle. Those in the castle would wait on the receipt of an absolution from the Pope for the murder, and would then be allowed to surrender on good terms. A meeting of the privy council at St Andrews on 19 December discussed how the castle was not winnable except by famine.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1877), 57-8. The agreement was probably cynical on both sides. As a pledge of good faith the Castilians sent two hostages to Arran in December 1546, two younger sons of the Laird of Grange, and a brother of Lord Ruthven, known as the 'Ald Person.'State Papers Henry VIII, vol.5 (1836), 578‚Äì9, 25 Dec. 1546. On 20 December, the hostages or 'pledges' were taken to Kinghorn.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.9 (Edinburgh, 1911), xvi, 44, 46. It was later said that Henri Cleutin, a diplomatic adviser to Mary of Guise had counselled Arran that those in the castle should be promised what they asked for, and beheaded when they came out.Calendar State Papers Foreign Elizabeth, 1559-1560, (London, 1865), p. 11. =Stalemate= An English invasion to support the Castilians never came, but Balnaves secured the services of two Italian military engineers in Henry's service, Guillaume de Rosetti and Angelo Arcano.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings, (East Linton, 2000), 227. After Henry's death on 27 January 1547 his son Edward VI did not send an armed force. The Castilians continued to sue for aid at the English court, and were able to travel in person to England by sea. The Scottish ambassador Adam Otterburn recorded their presence in London. English ships brought arms and supplies, but St Andrews was blockaded by the Scottish navy: in March 1547 Admiral Elmes and Andrew Dudley were ordered to sail from Lindisfarne with a convoy that had been repulsed. Dudley brought a contract for the garrison with terms for continued English support, in return for their continued promotion of the English royal marriage plan, and eventual surrender of the castle to an English relieving force.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 3, no. 8: Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings (Tuckwell, 2000), 226 The Castilians had also suggested that Henry should write to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor to persuade the Pope not to grant the absolution. This would prolong the siege, giving more time for Henry (and now his son) to send an army, and effect their goals.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5, part IV part 2 (London, 1836), 583 Although the absolution arrived in April 1547, the Castilians refused to surrender.Annie I. Cameron, Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (SHS, 1927), 182. James Stewart of Cardonald wrote that the Castilians said in private; \\"that they would rather have a measure of wheat than all the Pope's remissions.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), 4 no. 10 (here modernised), 6 no. 13. At this time, in April 1547, five English victualling ships were captured and brought to Leith. John Knox entered the castle and served as the garrison's preacher for the remainder of the siege. For a time Knox had the freedom to pass to and from the castle to preach in the parish church. According to the Earl of Glencairn, one of the besieged garrison, Ninian Cockburn, was a spy for the Governor. Later in the year, Ninian was involved in the handover of Broughty Castle to the English.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 10 no. 26: Clifford, Arthur, ed., Sadler State Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), p. 361. The French siege French guns were towed through the streets This peaceful interlude came to end, however, in July 1547 when Henri II of France sent a fleet to take the castle for the Scottish Government. The force was commanded by his admiral and military engineer, the Italian Leone Strozzi who directed a devastating artillery bombardment to dislodge the Protestant lairds. French intelligence included recent cartography by Jean Rotz and Nicolas de Nicolay who came on the voyage. Although the fleet was seen by English observers, they seemed not to know its purpose, assuming it came to embark Mary, Queen of Scots. Protector Somerset told the Imperial Ambassador, Fran√ßois van der Delft, that the French fleet was going to assault some unimportant fort in Scotland that would be easily recaptured. He would send 24 armed ships in pursuit to blockade St Andrews and the Firth of Forth.CSP Spain, vol.9 (1912) 122, 124‚Äì5, 127 Arran himself may not have known much in advance, but he did travel from the siege at Langholm to meet the French at St AndrewsBonner, Elizabeth, EHR (1996), 583‚Äì586, 588‚Äì589. After ineffectual bombardment from the French ships, perhaps over 20 days, the land assault began on 28 July, and the defenders were already depleted by plague. According to Pitscottie, the lairds knew an expert was in the field against them when their own Italian engineer observed cannon being winched into position with ropes rather than exposing the besiegers to their fire.Lindsay of Pitscottie, Chronicles of Scotland, vol. 2, Edinburgh, (1814), 489‚Äì490. Guns were also placed on St Salvator's and the cathedral towers. The battery began before dawn on Saturday 30 July. The castle was quickly rendered indefensible; within six hours according to Knox and Pitscottie.Lindsay of Pitscottie, Chronicles of Scotland, vol. 2, Edinburgh, (1814), 490. John Knox included his account of the French assault in his History of the Reformation of Scotland. According to Knox, the French fleet summoned the castle to surrender on the last day of June. Over the next two days naval bombardment only dislodged some roofing slates, but the castle's guns caused casualties among the galley rowers and the land army. A damaged galley had to be towed to safety. The final assault was delayed, according to Knox, by waiting for the return of Arran from Langhope in the Scottish Borders and commenced on 28 July. Guns were placed on the Abbey and Saint Salvator's College. The next day the firepower of 14 cannons overwhelmed the defenders who were also stricken by sickness. Knox wrote that \\"befoir ten houris of the day, the haill sowth quarter, betwix the foir tour and the East blok-house was maid saltable. The lower transe (passageway) was condempned, diverse slane into it, and the East blok-house was schote off fra the rest of the place, betwix ten houris and ellevin.\\" Heavy rain then silenced the guns and William Kirkcaldy of Grange began to negotiate the surrender with Leone Strozzi, Prior of Capua.Laing, David, ed., Works of John Knox: History of the Reformation in Scotland, Wodrow Society, vol.1 (1846), 203-205 Certain news that the French fleet was besieging the castle had arrived in London by 27 July.CSP Spain, vol.9 (1912), p.127. Too late, on 1 August 1547, Edward Clinton was ordered to engage the French force at St Andrews. Admiral Clinton was to embark on the Pansy at Harwich and make for St Andrews \\"as fast as wind or weather will serve\\", and raise the siege or rescue the Protestant lairds and James Hamilton. Clinton, who lay at Orford Ness, did not even get this order till 9 August.CSP Scotland vol.1 (1898), p.14 no.32 Aftermath The defeated Protestants were taken away: some were imprisoned in France while others, including Knox, were condemned to the galleys. The immediate consequent of the siege were Protector Somerset's orders to mobilise a large English army for Scotland by sea and land. Somerset was warned that Arran had obtained a register of Protestants and English supporters from Henry Balnaves's quarters in the castle.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), p.13 no. 13, p.14 nos. 32, 33. According to Jean de Saint Mauris, an Imperial diplomat, the English ambassador, Nicholas Wotton complained to Henry II of France that his action was a violation of the Treaty of Ardres of Camp, because it was well known the castle was held by Scots on behalf of England. Henry II replied that the castle was occupied by the Castilians after the treaty was made, and so if things had happened as Wotton said, England was in breach of the treaty.CSP Spanish,vol.9 (1912) pp.512‚Äì513: (The Treaty of Campe was concluded on 7 June 1546. Arran had written to the Pope that the Cardinal was killed \\"4 Kal June\\", 29 May, Letters & Papers, vol. 21 part 2, no.6) The success of the French mission and Scotland's subsequent defeat at the battle of Pinkie strengthened the Auld Alliance, and subsequently in 1548 Mary, Queen of Scots was taken to France as the prospective bride of the French Dauphin. Norman Leslie was imprisoned at Cherbourg, Balnaves at Rouen. Some of the garrison were kept in the fortress of Mont Saint-Michel, from where Robert and William Leslie, William Kirkcaldy, and Peter Carmichael managed to overpower their captors and make their way to Rouen and Le Conquet and took ship to England.Knox, John, History of the Reformation, vol.1 (1831), 77‚Äì79. The castle was slighted, and subsequently substantially rebuilt by Archbishop John Hamilton, the illegitimate brother of Regent Arran, and successor to David Beaton. Analysis =The plan= The manifesto, if such there was, of the Fife lairds was not recorded. Thus the degree of deliberation or opportunism in their actions remains debatable. The historian Gordon Donaldson noted that the Laird's plan included the hostage James Hamilton. Apart from his importance as the Governor's heir, Hamilton had been suggested as a possible husband for Henry's younger daughter, the Princess Elizabeth or Mary, Queen of Scots. Donaldson suggested that Regent Arran did not pursue the siege so vigorously because his son was within. More recently, Elizabeth Bonner has downplayed Hamilton's significance, focussing her study on the French initiative and highlighting that the French preparations were kept secret from the English. She notes the lack of evidence for Henry as a prime mover in the laird's initiative.Bonner, Elizabeth, EHR, (1996), 592‚Äì3 footnote. The sixteenth century Scottish Catholic historian John Lesley described James Hamilton merely as the most important of a number of noblemen's sons in the castle in the Cardinal's service. He wrote that the Lairds were motivated by grievances over the Cardinal's property transactions rather than by politics or religion.Lesley, John, History of Scotland, book 10: Cody ed., (1895) p. 296: Thomson ed., (1830), p.195 Although James Lindsay wrote straightaway to England with the news of the murder, including that Hamilton was kept prisoner by the lairds along with the servant he calls the Cardinal's chamber child, he did not express the laird's intent.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5, part IV part 2, (1836), p.560. Alexander Crichton of Brunstane had previously offered that James Kirkcaldy and Norman Leslie would capture or assassinate the Cardinal for Henry VIII when he and Somerset planned the attack on Edinburgh in 1544.State Papers Henry VIII, vol.5, part IV cont., (1836), 377. Margaret Sanderson in the biography Cardinal of Scotland notes the assumption of international responses that the murder was done for England's interests. In response to French initiatives, English diplomats freely acknowledged that the Castilians occupied the Castle for England, and May 1549 a delegation sent to Arran had commission to treat of the exchange of prisoners Henry Balnaves, James Kirkcaldy, Henry Moneypenny and the rest of the King's servants taken in St Andrews Castle.CSP Scotland, vol.1 (1898), p.175 no. 347, Instructions for Holcroft, Harington & Leke, 19 May 1549. Another initiative for the release of the Castilians in France was suggested in September 1549, by the English soldier Thomas Holcroft. He hoped to organize the capture of George Douglas of Pittendreich to facilitate the release of the captives.Stevenson, Joseph, ed., Selections from unpublished manuscripts in the College of Arms and the British Museum illustrating the reign of Mary Queen of Scotland, (1837), p.49-50 =Military aspects= It is known from Beaton's financial records that he had prepared gabions (baskets filled with gravel for gun emplacements) and bought new cannons in anticipation of an English invasion. Other commentators, such as Marcus Merriman have seen the failure of the Scottish forces to take the newly equipped castle as indicative of inadequate technology of Arran's army.Merriman, Marcus, Rough Wooings, (2000), 218 The Castilians themselves attributed Arran's failure to continue his artillery battery to the losses they had inflicted on Arran's gunners. Henry Stewart, Lord Methven, the master of the royal artillery, thought the castle could have been won with Arran's own \\"sobir artalyerij\\" and pointed out the ease and efficiency of the French captains who \\"ordourlie persewit\\" their short assault.Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine, SHS (1923), 208‚Äì210. Italian artillery specialists were employed by both the defenders (via England) and the French besiegers. The 16th century chronicle historian Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie wrote that the French gunners, who rapidly took the castle in July 1547 criticised the defenders for not troubling to demolish towers and other places which could serve as gun emplacements against the castle.

It was first published in hardcover by Avalon Books in 1962; a paperback edition followed from Ace Books in 1963 and was reprinted in 1973. The book is an expansion of \\"A Voice Across the Years,\\" a novella Pratt co-authored with \\"I. M.

History Alien Planet was uncharacteristic of science fiction of the 1930s, which tended more towards space opera (in the sense the term began to be used in the 1970s). Written in a careful, reportorial style, it purported to be an account of one of two friends inadvertently transported to another world with the occupant of a disabled alien craft they aid in repairing his \\"sky car\\" (Shoraru) while on a mountain hike.https://www.amazon.com/Alien-planet-Fletcher-Pratt/dp/B00005VC7G The matter-of-fact present day account thus achieved a remarkable realism.http://himthatwas.blogspot.com/2007/04/half-read-review-1-alien- planet-by.html Plot Merrick Wells and Alvin Schierstedt meet a man-like alien (Ashembe) from Murashema. He demonstrates genius by quickly learning English from a copy of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. In the course of assisting Ashembe with repairs to his Shoraru, which Ashembe translates as \\"Sky Car\\", one of the men is trapped inside and makes the return flight to Murashema. Faced with the choice of working for a living or performing as an artist to pay for his keep, Merrick performs popular English poems in dramatic rhythm. He is lauded by the aliens for this new art form, but Merrick learns he will be castigated and punished if it is discovered these poems are not original. He luckily makes his escape before his misunderstanding of alien customs casts him into peril; and he learns that even a seemingly utopian government must inevitably have flaws.

It is served either hot or cold as a starter, side dish or a main course, and is accompanied with bread and either yogurt or salad. In parts of northern Iran, kuku might be used as a midday meal, and might be served with either plain cooked rice (kate) or bread. Cookbooks from Iran's Safavid and Qajar periods mention kuku with coriander as one of its ingredients. Qajar documents introduce it as a side dish. Herb kuku (), which is the most popular type, is served traditionally at Nowruz, the Iranian New Year's Day, and also at Easter, which is celebrated by the Iranian Armenians. Cooking methods Cooking kuku sabzi (herb kuku) in a pan The traditional preparation of kuku involves frying the ingredients in oil over a low heat and is accomplished with steaming in a closed space. Baking is also a popular method nowadays. An extra thickness is given to the dish by adding yeast. The ultimate result is a cake-like omelette that is usually served with bread, but it might rather be accompanied with rice, particularly in the northern Iranian province of Gilan, where the consummation of rice in general was traditionally preferred over bread.

He was christened with a second forename, Arthur, but he disliked it, and never used it. His sister, Joan Howson, became a stained glass artist. Howson was educated at Loretto School, Musselburgh, and studied at Heriot-Watt College in Edinburgh. After university, through his father's connections, he was found a position as assistant manager at Melalap Estate, a rubber estate in British North Borneo from 1909 to 1914, where he contracted malaria, dysentery, and jaundice. War service Howson was on sick leave in England in 1914 when the First World War broke out. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 11th (Service) Battalion of the Hampshire Regiment in September 1914. He served on the Western Front throughout the war, from 1914 to 1918. Having been promoted to captain, he was awarded the Military Cross for his actions at Pilckem Ridge in the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July 1917, where, despite receiving a shrapnel wound, he encouraged his unit to continue repairing a road under shellfire. He was promoted to major, and finally retired from the army in May 1920. Post-war career Howson married Jessie Gibson in September 1918. She was the daughter of William Gibson, the Australian owner of the Foy & Gibson department stores. The newly married couple quickly became wealthy after William Gibson died in November 1918. His eldest child, and only son, Peter Howson later became a government minister in Australia. Howson was the founding chairman of the Disabled Society in 1920, with Jack Cohen MP. After the first Poppy Appeal in 1921 used artificial poppies imported from France by Madame Anna Gu√©rin, the British Legion commissioned the Disabled Society to make poppies in England for the 1922 appeal. Howson started with a workforce of five disabled ex-servicemen at a former collar factory on the Old Kent Road in June 1922. The number of employees rapidly increased to over 40, and they made a million poppies within two months. The Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) visited the Poppy Factory in November 1924. The factory made 27 million poppies that year. Most of the employees were disabled, and by then there was a long waiting list for prospective employees. The Disabled Society merged with the British Legion in 1925, and the Poppy Factory became a company limited by guarantee, with Howson as chairman. The factory moved to Richmond, Surrey in 1926, to the premises of an old brewery bought using money donated by Howson. Howson instituted the Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey in 1928, and the factory started to make remembrance crosses and wreaths. Howson lived at Hambleden, near Henley-on-Thames, with a town house in Kensington. He died of cancer of the pancreas. He was buried at Hambleden, with the funeral service conducted by his father, by then an archdeacon and canon emeritus of Liverpool Cathedral. He was survived by his wife and their four children.

It follows the Stalinist repressions of the mid-20th century and follows the life of Lina as she is deported from her native Lithuania with her mother and younger brother, and the journey they take to a labor camp in Siberia. It was nominated for the 2012 CILIP Carnegie Medal and has been translated into more than 27 languages. Between Shades of Gray was originally intended as a young adult novel, but there have been several adult publications. In an interview with ThirstforFiction, Ruta Sepetys said that the reason she intended Between Shades of Gray to be a young adult novel was because she met many survivors in Lithuania who were themselves teenagers during the deportations and had a greater will to live than many of their adult counterparts at the time. Inspiration and basis Between Shades of Gray is partly based upon the stories Sepetys heard from survivors of Soviet repressions in the Baltic states during a visit to her relatives in Lithuania. Sepetys decided she needed to write a fiction novel rather than a non-fiction volume as a way of making it easier for survivors to talk to her. She interviewed dozens of people during her stay. Synopsis Lina Vilkaitƒó is introduced as a young artist living comfortably in her home in Kaunas, Lithuania, with her loving family. But, on June 14, 1941, Soviet officers (the NKVD) barge into her home, tearing her family from the comfortable life they've known. Separated from her father, forced onto a crowded and dirty train car, Lina, along with her mother and her younger brother, Jonas, slowly make their way north to a work camp in the coldest reaches of Siberia. Here they are forced, under Stalin's orders, to dig for beets and fight for their lives under the cruelest of conditions. Lina befriends many people and works hard alongside her mother and brother for food and survival. Upon arriving at the camp, Lina and her family are forced to live with Ulyushka, a cruel, seemingly heartless woman who initially dislikes the Vilkai family and constantly takes their food and other goods from them as a form of rent. Elena Vilkienƒó, Lina's mother, is kind and generous to Ulyushka, though Lina and her brother Jonas cannot understand why. The family befriends fellow Lithuanian deportees including Andrius Arvydas (who later becomes Lina's love interest), Mr. Stalas (referred to as the Bald Man, who is secretly Jewish and adds a touch of humor because of his terrible advice and short temper), Mrs. Grybienƒó, Mrs. Rimas, and Aleksandras Lukas, a gray-haired man who was once a lawyer. He is often seen winding his watch and is the voice and soul of reason. One NKVD member, in particular, sticks out to Lina: Nikolai Kretzsky. Although he doesn't at first come off as necessarily kind or helpful, Kretzsky more or less befriends Lina and her mother. He can be seen as only being downright cruel to Lina only when around other NKVD members. He doesn't seem to want to hurt Lina unless he absolutely has to. He is described as young, blonde-haired, and blue-eyed, and can be assumed to be quite handsome. Their relationship grows and remains important throughout the book. Andrius Arvydas is handsome, golden-brown haired, and a source of comfort for Lina. At first, she dislikes him, dismissing him as an \\"idiot\\" because he smoked her book, which was a present from her deceased grandmother. Their friendship blossoms but becomes troubled when Lina accuses Andrius and his mother for working for the NKVD. It turns out his mother was being unwillingly used as a prostitute because of her beauty, but only to protect her son. Andrius becomes Lina's more-or-less boyfriend and gives Lina a new book. Lina and her family are then separated from Andrius, when they are transported to a different camp across the Arctic Circle, where they are forced to build their own shelter to survive. But then Lina's mother dies. Just when Lina doubted she would survive, a man who is a doctor as well as an inspector of the work camps, shows up giving everyone blankets and food. The doctor takes them home. After another long trip Lina finds Andrius, and they get married. *Lina Vilkaitƒó: the story's 15-year-old protagonist, taken in the beginning with her mother and brother to a labor camp. *Jonas Vilkas: Lina's 10-year-old brother. He is a major character, beloved by all, including the sour Mr. Stalas. His sweet and innocent personality is evident throughout the book, although Lina is frightened by the emotional changes he experiences over the course of their ordeal. *Elena Vilkienƒó: Lina and Jonas' mother. A loving woman, kind and generous with her gestures and food, who perishes from grief and her attempts to save her children by giving them her rations. She also teaches her children that it is important to do what is right, not what is easy. *Kostas Vilkas: Lina and Jonas' father, who is separated from his family and shipped to a prison called Krasnoyarsk. Nikolai Kretzsky and Ivanov claimed Kostas was dead, but whether or not he is telling the truth is unknown. Much of the book revolves around Lina's desperate attempts to locate and contact her father. *Andrius Arvydas: A handsome 17-year-old boy, whom Lina and her family meet in the train to the labor camps. He falls in love with Lina in exile, often sneaks food and supplies to the Vilkas family, and saves them a number of times with his knowledge of the happenings of the NKVD. He and Lina are said to be married in the epilogue. *Mrs. Arvydienƒó: Andrius' beautiful and dainty mother. She becomes a prostitute for the NKVD after they threaten to kill her son if she did not do so. *Nikolai Kretzsky: A young NKVD officer who helps Lina and her mother. While Lina finds him cruel and ruthless throughout much of the novel, he actually struggles with his work due to its immorality. While he is described to hit and shove the prisoners, he is also the only member of the NKVD who turns as the women undress for their bath, saves Elena from his fellow officers when they assault her, and sends for a doctor to save the prisoners dying in the second camp. *Mr. Stalas: A salty elderly man, distraught with guilt. He often complains and advises everyone to kill themselves before the NKVD does. It is later discovered that he had revealed the prisoners' identities and workplaces, resulting in their imprisonment. He is known to have a soft spot for the Vilkas family, despite his rudeness towards them, and he later helps in saving the sick prisoners. * Janina: A young girl partial to Lina, whose doll she lost when an officer shot its head off. * Joana: Lina's beloved cousin and best friend, who flees to Germany with her family before Stalin begins the deportation. Their escape is the reason for the Vilkas family's imprisonment. Joana is consistently mentioned but only appears in flashbacks. She is one of the main characters in Sepetys' third novel, Salt to the Sea (2016). *Ivanov: An NKVD officer, perhaps the most despicable, who allows many prisoners to die, and finds great humor in the pain. *Ona: A young woman, not believed to be 20, who is forced on the train immediately after giving birth to her baby, and neither is given any medical attention. After losing her baby, Ona goes insane and is fatally shot by the NKVD. *Aleksandras Lukas: A gray haired man who is obsessed with winding his watch. He is an attorney from Kaunas. He shows intelligence and dignity throughout the novel, especially when the deportees were asked to sign papers condemning them to imprisonment. Reception Between Shades of Gray received intensely positive reviews. Linda Sue Park of The New York Times described it as a \\"superlative first novel\\" whilst Susan Carpenter of the LA Times called it a \\"story of hardship as well as human triumph\\". Publishers' Weekly praised Between Shades of Gray, calling it a \\"harrowing page-turner, made all the more so for its basis in historical fact\\". The book was a finalist for the 2012 William C. Morris Award for a debut young adult novel and for the 2012 Amelia Elizabeth Walden Award. It was shortlisted for the 2012 Carnegie Medal and won the 2012 Golden Kite Award.

It was originally published in Russian in the literary journal Novy Mir in 1992, and translated into English by Arch Tait in 2005. Sonechka was nominated for the Russian Booker Prize. Plot summary The novella Sonechka tells the life story of a Russian booklover. Sonechka spends her youth immersed in the world of Russian literature, living her life vicariously through the characters in books. One day, when Sonechka is working at the local library, a man named Robert Viktorovich inquires about an ensemble of French books. The 50-year-old man, who is a member of the intelligentsia, returns to the library 3 days later and abruptly proposes to Sonechka. She accepts and embarks on a new life with her husband. She lives a fulfilling life as she moves around Russia with her husband and her daughter Tanya. Eventually, the family settles in the Montmartre of Moscow. Sonechka‚Äôs husband gets a studio to work on his paintings and Tanya tumbles around in her studies and distances herself from her mother. However, when Tanya enters afternoon classes, a new girl, Jasia, enters the life of the family. Jasia, a beautiful Polish girl, charms Tanya and Robert. One Christmas Jasia and Robert start an affair. Despite this, Sonechka views the girl as a fragile individual, who becomes the daughter Sonechka always dreamed of having. Suddenly, Robert has a heart attack and dies, leaving Sonechka and Jasia alone. Sonechka prepares for the funeral and takes care of Jasia. By the end of the story, Sonechka rediscovers her love of literature while Tanya relocates to St. Petersburg and Jasia marries a European aristocrat. Characters in Sonechka * Sonechka ‚Äì the protagonist is an introverted, book-loving librarian who meets her future husband, Robert, in the job. Once married she transforms into a domestic woman who showers her family with limitless love, patience, and understanding. Sonechka, Sonya or Sofia means wisdom. * Robert Victorovich ‚Äì well known artist and husband of Sonechka ‚Äì quite prolific, intellectual, and very popular in the creative community, but unfaithful and often condescending to his wife. * Tanya ‚Äì self-absorbed daughter of Sonechka and Robert and friend of Jasia who takes after her father. She has a knack for enchanting suitors and dabbling in arts, despite leading a generally vacuous existence. * Jasia ‚Äì an orphaned Polish girl whose personality adapts to survive the harsh events of her life. She utilizes her sexuality to manipulate others and/or survive. She is Tanya's friend and Robert's mistress. Major Themes * Family, domesticity, and the women's sphere ‚Äì the novella examines the \\"prevailing paradigm in Russian culture--one that equates women with maternity and nationhood and, more recently, with the prostitute, while conceiving of culture and cultural production as purely masculine realms.\\" * Story telling ‚Äì \\"...Ulitskaya relies firmly upon the basic, eternal urge of readers to find out 'What happened next?' She tells stories.\\" * Unpredictability of life ‚Äì \\"[Ulitskaya's] works are complex, often weaving several human stories and layering historic events into the lives of gray, little people who lead a banal existence.\\" * Relationships and love in 20th-century Russia ‚Äì The story explores the relationships between women with Jasia, Sonechka and Tanya; and relationships between man and woman with Jasia and Robert; and Sonechka and Robert. This is a recurring theme in 20th-century Russian literature. * The Intellectual/creative lifestyle ‚Äì Sonechka is based on a known situational construct that brings together a mismatched family, including a creative's wife and his mistress, to live together harmoniously. The unexpected combination of characters manage to coexist by allowing their most admirable traits‚Äîwisdom, patience, and will power‚Äîto motivate their actions. * Female perspective ‚Äì \\"Liudmila Ulitskaia brigs gender-specific difference back into the reader's consciousness through her very powerful and very feminine protagonists.\\" The novella offers insight into the minds of three strong, female characters, their relationships with Robert, and their relationships with each other. Sonechka's devotion to her family and role as a domesticated woman become central to plot development. Ulitskaya uses unembellished prose to uniquely highlight the inner workings of the female mind and to evoke a new type of discourse about national and gender identity. \\"As a female writer, Ulitskaya...has openly deemed herself prepared to take the risk of being considered an old-fashioned and sentimental representative of zhenskaia proza. * Psychoanalytical context ‚Äì The three main female characters in the novella, Tanya, Jasia, and Sonechka could represent the psychoanalytical ideas of the id, ego, and super ego. Tanya's selfish behavior throughout the story clearly parallels that of the unrestrained id. Jasia creates balance in her life by juggling her dream to be an actress in order to please herself with her drive to please others, thus earning her the label of ego. Lastly, Sonechka's utter devotion to her domestic duties at the expensive of her own needs embodies the superego and completes the three-pronged structure of the psyche. * Women's experiences ‚Äì Ulitskaya's writings focus on the personal experiences of women and display unusual psychological insight expressed in straightforward, unornamental language. Literary significance Ludmila Ulitskaya gives a novel that is distinctly Russian and a part of the growing literary tradition in Russia of works somewhere between pop culture and intellectual literature. The novella was well-received just shortly after its initial release. Sonechka was nominated for the Russian Booker Prize in 2005. Sonechka is in line with other Sonechkas from Russian literature ‚Äì such as Dostoyevsky's characters ‚Äì in kindness and magnanimity. The English translation was shortlisted for the Rossica Translation Prize in 2007. Developmental history Sonechka is an early work of Ulitskaya's. It was published in 1992 in the journal Novyi mir (New World) after the author had written literature based on Jewish life and her own childhood experiences.

According to Khristov this work is focused on the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans. Imber, however, is more critical of its coverage of that time period. According to him that work provides a narrative from 1296 to the death of Sultan Bayezid I in 1403 and only has a few brief and rather inaccurate entries focusing on the Ottoman civil war. This work has been identified it as one of the two important Slavonic literary histories for that time and place. Due to the relatively undescriptive name, it is possible that Khristov and Imber discuss two different works.

History  The foundation is owned by the Federal Republic of Germany and was founded in 1966 out of fear that classic German cinema's original stock, and the rights to these films, would be sold off internationally. The stock was originally owned by Bertelsmann. The foundation maintains about 80% of Germany's forbidden Nazi-era films and acts as a gate keeper for public access to these films via archives and curated public screenings. As an archive and rights holder the Murnau Foundation curates Its most important endowment is the unique, cohesive movie stock, which comprises copies and material as well as rights from the former production companies UFA, Decla, Universum-Film, Bavaria, Terra, Tobis and Berlin-Film. This outstanding inventory of cultural and film history ‚Äì more than 6,000 silent movies and sound films (feature films, documentaries, short movies and commercials) ‚Äì covers the period from the beginnings of motion pictures to the early 1960s, and includes movies by important directors such as Fritz Lang, Ernst Lubitsch, Detlef Sierck, Helmut K√§utner, and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, the namesake of the foundation. titles include The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari from 1920, Metropolis from 1927, The Blue Angel from 1930, The Three from the Filling Station from 1930, M√ºnchhausen from 1943 and Gro√üe Freiheit Nr. 7 from 1944. = Theaters = The foundation runs \\"the German Film House in a central location in the state capital of Hesse ‚Äì Wiesbaden\\" as well as the \\"Murnau cinema theatre where films are shown to the public and a multi-function area where numerous events and exhibitions are held.\\"  Restorations & film stock  The foundation's most prominent film restoration was the 2010 re-release of Fritz Lang's Metropolis which was originally screened at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival. It has additionally restored, with financial support from the prior owners of their film stock, Bertelsmann, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari which premiered \\"at the Berlinale in February 2014\\" which it won an award for best archive restoration in 2015 from FOCAL International. The foundation was also involved in the restoration of Fritz Lang's Destiny which had \\"faded and degraded almost beyond recognition.\\" The foundation maintains about 80% of Germany's forbidden Nazi-era films referring to this collection of 40 films as \\"reserved\\" films which are \\"propagandistic productions created under Hitler, which may only be used for scientific evaluation in Germany and within the framework of political education.\\" This collection includes the notorious Jud S√º√ü, Quax the Crash Pilot, Kolberg, I Accuse, and The Eternal Jew.  Criticism  The treatment of reserved films by the Murnau Foundation has been met with criticism. Critics accuse the foundation of misusing copyrights for film censorship and not for the intended purpose of copyright law where, they argue, the government should institute a ban through legislation instead. Unlike the FSK, there are no legal evaluations for the decisions of the Board of Trustees. Critics also point out the opaque process of deciding which films should be reserved, noting that there is no transparent criteria, the experts consulted are not publicized, and any reports used are not publicized. For instance, the film The Old and the Young King contains Nazi propaganda, however, it was allowed to be screened publicly. Additionally, the nature of the reserved film screenings has been criticized, since the only option is to view them with accompanying expert supervision, commentary, and discussion.

Montana told MTV News about working with Cyrus, \\"I was in L.A. and she happened to be doing the 'Ain't Worried About Nothin remix for me. She came by the studio and let me hear her album, which was crazy, and we just went through a couple tracks to see which one I fit on.\\" He continued, \\"Then she played 'FU' and I fell in love with it. We just went in there and did it together.\\" Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, \\"It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for somebody when you get to that point, when somebody breaks your heart and you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'.\\" Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines \\"I don't really have much to say/ I was over it the second that I saw her name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue.\\" Reception Critical reception to the song was mainly positive. Heather Phares of AllMusic gave the song a favorable review, calling it a \\"brassy empowerment jam which sells Cyrus as an independent woman.\\" Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly praised the song, describing it as folding \\"starry Adele-style sass and a French Montana verse into expertly inlaid dubstep wub-wubs.\\" Mikael Wood from the Los Angeles Times praised Cyrus' vocals and compared the song to Amy Winehouse, writing \\"Her vocals are equally strong in the surprisingly Amy Winehouse-like 'FU'.\\" Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian deemed it one of the album's best songs, writing \\"FU's mix of raw heartbreak, sub-bass and scathing rhyming from French Montana is devastating.\\" Kitty Empire from The Observer reviewed the song positively, writing \\"Cyrus liberates her inner Christina Aguilera in the company of rapper French Montana, blending old-time jazzy balladry, I Put a Spell on You, romantic righteousness and dubstep sub-bass.\\" Writing for MTV, John Walker reviewed the song positively, calling it an \\"innovative surprisingly cabaret- friendly track\\" and compared it to the works of Amanda Palmer. John Murphy of musicOMH compared the song to works by Lady Gaga and called it \\"rather excellent.\\" Kyle Fowle from Slant Magazine heavily praised the track while comparing it to the works of Amy Winehouse and Skrillex, writing, \\"Cyrus plays the femme fatale with an exaggerated Southern drawl, ready to rip into male suitors and their tired pick-up lines.\\" Catriona Wightman of Digital Spy speculated it to be inspired by Cyrus' former fianc√© Liam Hemsworth and deemed it the best song of the album. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard gave the song a mixed review, calling it a \\"campy piano flare-up\\", but criticizing French Montana's appearance, calling it \\"as inexplicable as the song itself.\\" Marah Eakin of The A.V. Club described it as \\"EDM-aping\\". She further stated that the song \\"seems perfect for the album, rather than just thrown in to stay with the times.\\" Channing Freeman from Sputnikmusic praised Cyrus' vocals, writing, \\"the chorus is so good, with a pulsing beat that allows Miley plenty of room to show off her voice (which is and always has been lovely)\\" although criticized the lyrics. Commercially, the song debuted at No. 3 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100Bubbling Under Hot 100 : Dec 28, 2013  Billboard Chart Archive and at No. 22 on Billboard Pop Digital Songs Chart. When the song was used in the '2013 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show', it reached number 1 on Bubbling Under Hot 100. In Canada, the song debuted at No. 85 on the Canadian Hot 100. Live performances Cyrus performing \\"FU\\" at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, February 14, 2014. Cyrus has performed the song during her Bangerz Tour. Critics praised her performance of the song, specifically praising Cyrus' vocals and showmanship. While performing \\"FU\\" during the first leg of the tour, Cyrus wore a long red sequined skirt over a sequined red and white leotard designed by \\"The Blonds\\". She also wore matching gloves and cowboy boots. During the second leg of the show, she replaced the center color of the leotard from red to neon yellow and wore a long feathery yellow skirt with yellow elbow-length gloves. David Blond of The Blonds stated that the pave crystal bodysuit and the rip-away sequin skirt were inspired by Jessica Rabbit. A Sesame Street-esque, bi-pod puppet joined her during the performance. Of her August 4, 2014 performance at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that she bought the house down \\"with a show-stopping cabaret vocal\\" during \\"FU\\". On June 8, 2014, during Cyrus' performance of \\"FU\\" at Mediolanum Forum in Milan, Italy; Cyrus performed the song with a fan made cardboard cutout of Selena Gomez wearing a poorly scrawled black bikini. In the middle of the performance, she threw the cardboard cutout back into the crowd. This incident lead to many outlets speculating that Cyrus specifically directed the performance at Gomez. Neither Cyrus nor Gomez responded to the speculations.

It is an experimental proapoptotic drug that has been shown to cause rapid weight loss in mice and rhesus monkeys. Its mechanism of action is to target specific blood vessels supplying adipose tissue with blood, cause the vessels to shrink and the fat cells fed by those vessels to undergo apoptosis. TP01 is designed to bind to two receptors, ANXA2 and prohibitin, that are specific to blood vessels supplying white adipose tissue. As of 2019, clinical development has been discontinued.

It was an anomaly in that it was located in a working- class neighborhood and yet known the world over. Patrons included the Marshall Field Family, of department store fame. Both the salad dressing and meat sauce won the International Epicurian Award of France. It was cited by Chicago Magazine as one of the top 40 Chicago restaurants ever. According to that same Chicago Magazine article Kraft Foods offered $75,000 in 1948 to buy Fanny's salad dressing recipe. This offer was refused. The restaurant was closed due to the deteriorating health of the founder, Fanny Lazar n√©e Bianucci. According to the May 11, 1991 Chicago Sun Times and Chicago Tribune obituaries, Fanny Lazar died at Saint Francis Hospital of Evanston. At some point, possibly in the 1960s, Fanny's products became available on grocery shelves and the business continues on today through mail order. For several years the restaurant building at Simpson Street and Ashland Avenue was shuttered, then later occupied by rental tenants. During this period there was difficulty maintaining tenants because of what was described as ‚Äòstrange happenings‚Äô and the claims that the building was haunted. However, during the condominium boom which occurred in the United States during the first ten years of the 21st Century it was heavily altered and converted into loft spaces. According to a July 5, 1998 Chicago Sun Times article a second version of the restaurant was opened in Union Pier, MI. It appears to remain in business as of 2011, as it can be found through searching local tourism web sites. Fanny's in Union Pier Michigan was located in the Gordon Beach Inn, It's no longer in business. Fanny's meat sauce and salad dressing can still be purchased through World Wide Food Products in Evanston, IL  References  External links *Memories of Fanny's Restaurant on WTTW Channel 11 Chicago: https://web.archive.org/web/20091106032511/https://www.wttw.com/main.taf?erube_fh=wttw&wttw.submit.getThread;=1&wttw.threadid;=1754&wttw.threadPath;=1,49,3,1,1 *Fanny's Fried Chicken Recipe on Lost Recipes Found: https://web.archive.org/web/20120425154123/http://www.lostrecipesfound.com/recipes/fannyschicken.html *Recollections from former patrons on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=45289276596&topic;=7737 Category:Restaurants established in 1946 Category:Buildings and structures in Cook County, Illinois Category:1946 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Fanny's"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function H(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your libraryü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(B,[["render",H]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/47.md","filePath":"drive/47.md"}'),D={name:"drive/47.md"},E=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{x as __pageData,E as default};
