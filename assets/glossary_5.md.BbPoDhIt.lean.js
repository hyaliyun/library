V√∂lkisch Activist Beckerle was born in Frankfurt am Main, the son of a post office official. Beckerle was educated at the elementary school and at the Realgymnasium (the type of high school that prepares one for university in Germany) in Frankfurt from 1908 to 1921. In March 1921, he passed the Abitur (university entrance exam). From 1921 to 1927, he attended the University of Frankfurt, where he graduated with a degree in economics in 1927. While at university, he joined a fraternity, the Coburger Convent. In 1921-1922, he served in the Reichswehr as a reserve officer. As a student, he also became active in several v√∂lkisch groups on campus, joining the Viking League in 1922. On 29 August 1922, he joined the NSDAP, but dropped out shortly afterwards. Beckerle broke off his studies several times, serving in May 1925-June 1926 as an officer candidate with the Prussian police. Beckerle made regular trips to South America in the 1920s which he regarded as a backward continent full of backward people that might one day be colonised by Germany. Beckerle's only book was an autobiographical adventure novel set in South America whose hero was a thinly disguised version of himself. The book Wir wollten arbeitern: Erlebneisse deustcher Auswanderer in S≈´damerika (We wanted to work: Experiences of German emigrants in South America) was published under the pseudonym Heinz Edelmann. The plot of Wir wollten arbeitern concerned an young German man, disillusioned with the Weimar Republic, who travels to South America, depicted in colonialist terms as a place of bountiful natural resources mostly inhabited by racially inferior people of entirely or partial Indian descent that is waiting to be exploited by Aryans. German immigrants to South America are depicted in the most positive terms as a people who bring order and prosperity to wherever they go. After many adventures in South America, the hero learns in 1925 that Adolf Hitler has been released from prison, which shows that there is still hope for Germany and inspires him to return to the Fatherland to join the Nazi \\"freedom struggle\\". Through the book was published in 1942, much of the book had been written in the 1920s during Beckerle's visits to South America. The choice of the pseudonym Edelmann (\\"noble person\\") revealed much about Beckerle's desire for social advancement. Reflecting the v√∂lkisch concept that art, politics, culture and race were all one and the same, Beckerle saw himself as a F√ºhrungspers√∂nlichkeit (a \\"political leader\\"), a natural leader of men and an artist who was just as comfortable writing a poem as he was fighting in a street bawl. On 1 September 1928, he rejoined the NSDAP while also joining the SA. On 1 April 1929, he became the leader of the SA in Frankfurt. Beckerle was unusual among the SA leaders in that he was too young to have served in either World War I and/or the Freikorps and to make up for his lack of military experience, he was especially zealous Nazi. From July 1931 to April 1932, he served as the leader of the SA group Hessen-Nassau South. On 24 April 1932, he was elected to the Prussian Landtag as a Nazi and on 31 July 1932, he was elected to the Reichstag on the Nazi ticket. Under the Third Reich On 1 March 1933, he was promoted to SA Gruppenf√ºhrer. From 1 July 1933 to 31 January 1942, he was in charge of SA in Hesse. On 14 September 1933, he was appointed acting police chief of Frankfurt and in February 1934 was appointed full-time police chief. Beckerle was one of the SA leaders scheduled for execution by the SS during the Night of Long Knives and only narrowly escaped execution due to the personal intervention of Adolf Hitler himself. Hitler's intervention in 1934 guaranteed Beckerle's unflinching loyalty towards der Fuhrer that lasted for the rest of his life. On 27 February 1935, he married the actress Silke Edelmann. In 1937, he was promoted to the rank of SA- Obergruppenf√ºhrer. As police chief of Frankfurt and SA leader, Beckerle played a major role in the Kristallnacht pogrom in Frankfurt, organising the burning of all the synagogues in Frankfurt. After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Beckerle served as the police chief of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland from September 1939 to November 1939 where he was noted for his harsh treatment of the Polish, Jewish and Romany communities in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. In report he wrote in the fall of 1939, Beckerle called the Jewish community in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ one of \\"the most dirty places of the most disgusting East European Jewry\\". Beckerle wrote about how much he hated the Orthodox Jewish men of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in their long breads and \\"draped in dirty caftans\\" and the \\"insolent Jewish women\\". A leitmotiv of his report was with linking the Ashkenazim (Yiddish-speaking Jews) with dirt and filth. From November 1939-June 1940, Beckerle served in the Wehrmacht. In January 1941, long-standing rivalries between the Ausw√§rtiges Amt (Foreign Office) and the SS exploded with the attempted coup d'etat in Bucharest that saw SS back the coup by the Iron Guard under its leader Horia Sima against the Prime Minister, General Ion Antonescu while the Ausw√§rtiges Amt together with the Wehrmacht backed Antonescu. In the aftermath of the coup, the Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop made an effort to club the power of the SS to conduct a foreign policy independent of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt. Taking an advantage of the long- standing rivalries between the SS and the SA, in 1941, Ribbentrop appointed an assemblage of SA men to head the German embassies in Eastern Europe, with Beckerle going to Bulgaria, Manfred von Killinger going to Romania, Siegfried Kasche to Croatia, Dietrich von Jagow to Hungary, and Hanns Ludin to Slovakia in order to ensure that there would be minimal co-operation with the SS. The SA leader Viktor Lutze was asked by Martin Luther for a list of SA officers suitable to serve as diplomats and Beckerle was one of the names on the list. The role of the SA ambassadors was that of \\"quasi-Reich governors\\" as they aggressively supervised the internal affairs of the nations they were stationed in, making them very much unlike traditional ambassadors. The German historian Daniel Siemans wrote that it was significant that four of the five SA ambassadors had served as policemen in their careers, suggesting it was their ability to impose their will on others as police chiefs that led them for them being appointed as ambassadors. The role of the SA ambassadors were conceived of as being an essentially colonial role whose task was to impose the power the German state onto \\"the natives\\" rather than that of a traditional diplomat, whose role was to conduct relations between theoretically equal nations. It was believed that Beckerle's role in forcefully upholding the authority of the German state as police chief in Frankfurt and then in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ prepared him well for a diplomatic mission in Bulgaria. From the viewpoint of Berlin, southeast Europe was viewed as the erg√§nzungsraum (\\"complementary space\\") to the lebensraum (\\"living space\\") in Eastern Europe. Unlike the lebensraum, which was to be colonised with millions of German settlers while the indigenous peoples living there would be exterminated, expelled or enslaved, the erg√§nzungsraum were seen as a source of food, raw materials and manpower that would assist the Reich in its quest for \\"world power status\\". Because the states in the erg√§nzungsraum were not to be colonised, the role of these states were seen as essentially protectorates of Germany that would be allowed a nominal independence as long as they played their role in the \\"New Order in Europe\\". The nations marked out as being in Germany's lebensraum such as Poland and the Soviet Union were often described by Hitler and the other Nazi leaders as the \\"wild East\\", which like the \\"wild West\\" in the 19th century was to be conquered with the indigenous peoples displaced. By contrast, the model for political control for the states in the erg√§nzungsraum were similar in spirit to the princely states of the Raj. In the same way that the Indian maharajahs were allowed to be nominally independent, but with actual political control being held by the installed resident, the various protectorates were nominally independent but with actual political control being held by the Germans in the country. H√°cha was implied to be on the receiving end of \\"avuncular guidance\\" from Baron Neurath, the one with actual political control in the protectorate. Significantly, the five SA ambassadors in south-east Europe were all told that their diplomatic postings were only temporary, and that after the \\"final victory\\" that the German embassies and legations in Bratislava, Zagreb, Sofia, Bucharest, and Budapest would all be converted into formal colonial institutions along the same lines as the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia. On 28 June 1941, he arrived in Sofia, Bulgaria as the German minister-plenipotentiary (ambassador). Beckerle's was so crude and vulgar in his manners that King Boris III almost refused to allow him to present his credentials at the Vrana Palace. The king much preferred that Beckerle's predecessor, Herbert von Richthofen, stay on. It was a great relief to Boris that Beckerle did not press for a Bulgarian declaration of war against the Soviet Union, which would be unpopular in traditionally Russophile Bulgaria. The Russo-Ottoman war of 1877-1878, which saw the Imperial Russian Army expel the Ottomans from Bulgaria led the Russians to be viewed as liberators in Bulgaria, and Boris was highly concerned about being forced to make an unpopular declaration of war. However, Bulgaria's biggest export was tobacco with some 80% of the tobacco harvest going to Germany by 1940, giving the Reich a powerful form of economic leverage over Bulgaria. Beckerle saw his duty in Bulgaria to \\"represent National Socialism in its entirety\\". His overbearing, arrogant and bullying manner did not impress either the king or the Bulgarian elite in general. At least part of the reason for Backerle's appointment in Sofia was the perception in Berlin that the anti-Semitic laws in Bulgaria, most notably the Law for the Defense of the Nation passed in October 1940, were not being enforced with sufficient vigor and it was believed that his background as a tough police chief would motivate a more aggressive enforcement of the laws. Beckerle's presence did yield results as over the next 18 months a series of degrees were passed to ensure that the Law for the Defense of the Nation would be enforced while the definition of Jewishness was changed from being religious to racial and a 20% surtax was applied to all Jewish businesses. During the course of the years 1940-44, the Jewish community in Bulgaria was systematically impoverished with some 95% of Bulgarian Jews living in poverty by 1942. As harvesting and refining tobacco was the biggest industry in Bulgaria and many Bulgarian Jews were involved in the tobacco business, a host of German businessmen descended upon Bulgaria looking to buy on the cheap the former businesses formally owned by the Jews. As a minister-plenipotentiary, Beckerle supported the efforts of German businessmen to play a larger role in the Bulgarian economy. Reflecting his self-image as a great artist who would bring the benefits of German power and culture to the Balkans, Beckerle spent his spare time in Sofia writing poems and short stories while also drypointing. Beckerle was shocked to learn that the professional diplomats of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt did not accept his claims to be a cultured man and instead learned from one diplomat at the legation in Sofia that he and the other SA ambassadors were seen to be \\"brutal KZ [concentration camp] men with a personal concentration camp at their disposal\\". The five SA ambassadors had all known each other from the 1920s onward and formed a very tight clique who were so close that the five ambassadors and their families took their summer vacations together, a practice the families continued after 1945. The five ambassadors also exchanged information on a regular basis, and Beckerle was especially close to Kasche who was serving as the German minister-plenipotentiary in Zagreb. Beckerle was extremely unpopular in Bulgaria and even the Bulgarian volksdeutche (ethnic German) community leaders whom he sought to cultivate intensely disliked him. His diary shows that he was extremely lonely in Sofia and homesick for Germany as he expressed considerable disdain for Bulgaria. The fact that Bulgaria until late 1943 was spared from the Allied strategical bombing offensive was for Beckerle the only consolation to serving in Bulgaria as he expressed much in his diary that he might be killed in an Allied bombing raid. During his time as ambassador, Beckerle pressured the Bulgarian government to do its part in \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\\". In October 1941, in one of the first acts of resistance in Bulgaria, a Jewish Communist named Leon Tadzher blew up a fuel depot in Ruse. Beckerle who prided himself on his toughness demanded in retaliation that the Bulgarian government execute 50 Jews in Sofia and another 50 Jews in Ruse, saying that the only way for the state to fight \\"terrorism\\" was with even greater terror. The Bulgarians refused, saying it would shock public opinion if the government were to resort to such methods. In July 1942, Josef Geron, the president of the central consistory of the Jews, sent a telegram to King Boris for the fifth birthday of Crown Prince Simon, which led the king to send back a telegram thanking Geron and the rest of Bulgarian Jewish community for their well wishes to his son. The telegrams were then published in the Bulletin of the Central Consistory of the Jews in Bulgaria. Through the exchange of telegrams was quite routine, Beckerle was greatly exercised by what his staff had told him had been published in the Bulletin, causing him to sent a stream of excited dispatches to Berlin, warning that the king was falling under \\"Jewish influence\\". On 16 October 1942, Martin Luther, the head of the Jewish Office in the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, ordered Beckerle \\"to discuss the question of a transport to the East of the Jews due to resettlement under the new Bulgarian regulations\\". Beckerle met with the Bulgarian Prime Minister Bogdan Filov who told him that he welcomed the German offer, but stated that the \\"resettlement in the East\\" would to wait for some time as his government wanted to use the Bulgarian Jews for \\"road-building\\". After meeting with Filov in November 1942, Beckerle reported to Berlin the deportation of \\"the majority of the Bulgarian Jews\\" was still possible in the near-future. In early 1943, Filov told Beckerle that he learned via the Swiss minister that the British government was prepared to accept 5,000 Bulgarian Jewish children whose parents held valid passports into the Palestine Mandate (modern Israel) via Turkey. Beckerle played a major role in vetoing this offer, saying he did not want to see any Jews leave Bulgaria. On 22 February 1943, an agreement was signed calling for the \\"resettlement\\" of 20, 000 Jews from Bulgaria to Poland. The Bulgarians refused to deport the Jews who lived within the pre-1940 frontiers of Bulgaria, but agreed to deport the Jews from the areas that Bulgaria had annexed in 1941, namely Yugoslav Macedonia together with Greek Macedonia and Greek Thrace. The position of the Bulgarian government was that the Jews living in the annexed regions were Yugoslav or Greek citizens, and thus of lesser concern. The first deportation of Jews took place on 4 March 1943 in what had formerly been Greek Macedonia and Thrace. On 21 March 1943, Beckerle arrived in Skopje, the former capital of Yugoslav Macedonia (modern North Macedonia), to personally oversee the deportation of the Jews of Skopje to Treblinka. Accompanying Beckerrle to Skopje were Jewish Affairs commissioner Alexander Belev, SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Theodor Dannecker, and two police chiefs, Penco Lukov and Zahari Velkov. After being greeted by the mayor and police chief of Skopje at the train station and attending a ceremony where Stojan Novakovic Street was renamed in his honor, Beckerle went to the camp where the Jews of Skopje and oversaw how they were marched out to be loaded onto freight-cars that took them to Treblinka. Beckerle was \\"significantly\\" involved in the deportation of about 11, 000 Jews from the annexed areas of greater Bulgaria to Auschwitz. From April 1943-July 1943, Beckerle worked closely with SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Theodor Dannecker in plans to deport the Bulgarian Jews, but in July 1943 he was forced to report \\"to insist on the deportation at the present time makes no sense whatever\\" as the Bulgarian government was not prepared to co-operate.. In June 1943, he complained in a dispatch to Berlin about the \\"Bulgarian mentality\\", charging that the Bulgarians lived in a multicultural society typical of the Balkans with substantial Greek, Turkish, Armenian, and \\"Gypsy\\" (Romany) minorities and so were not obsessed with racial purity in the same way that people in northern Europe were. In the same dispatch, Beckerle complained that most Bulgarian Jews were lower-class artisans and \\"diligent workers\\", and so the propaganda portraying the Jews as either exploitative capitalists or alternatively as an underclass living in criminality and \\"filth\\" was ineffective. However, as late as January 1944, he thought it was still \\"possible\\" that the Bulgarians might finally agree to deport the rest of the Jews. On 7 September 1944, the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria and invaded. Within a day, Bulgaria had signed an armistice with the Soviets. On 18 September 1944, Beckerle was captured by the Red Army in Svilengrad while attempting to flee to Turkey. After his capture, Beckerle expressed considerable pride in his role in deporting the Jews from Macedonia and Thrace, saying it was his greatest achievement. After the war A Soviet military court convicted Beckerle of war crimes and sentenced him to 25 years of hard labor. On 13 October 1955, the Soviet government released the last of the German prisoners and Beckerle was one of those freed. Upon his return to Frankfurt, Beckerle was greeted as a hero with the mayor of Frankfurt shaking his hand. To compensate him for his suffering in the Soviet Union, a court awarded Beckerle 6, 000 deutschmarks. However, Beckerle was saddened to learn that his wife had committed suicide in 1951 after the Jewish owners of a luxurious villa he had \\"Aryanized\\" in the 1930s successfully sued to get it back. The award of compensation to Beckerle was controversial as Beckerle was a diplomat, not a POW. The Association of Politically Persecuted Social Democrats complained about this award, stating \\"with indignation the crying injustice\\" of the financial compensation to a war criminal. Beckerle was investigated for acts of persecution he had committed as police chief of Frankfurt against anti-Nazis, but the prosecutor-general of Hesse closed the case in 1957 without bringing charges. Under West German law in the 1950s-1980s, Nazis could be prosecuted if it could be shown that they acted for \\"base motives\\" on their own, and those who merely obeyed the law at the time such Beckerle usually enjoyed legal immunity. Afterwards, he settled in Neu-Isenburg, where he worked as a notary. Fritz Bauer, a German Jewish prosecutor in Hesse-who was one of the few German prosecutors who actively pursued Nazi war criminals in the 1950s-opened an investigation of Beckerle after it was decided not to charge him with political persecution in 1957. In September 1959, Baurer had Beckerle arrested and charged with crimes against humanity for his role in arranging the deportation of Jews from greater Bulgaria. Beckerle's lawyers were able to delay the proceedings and his trial did not finally begin until November 1967. In 1965, Beckerle was interviewed at his home by the American historian Frederick Chary who was writing a PhD thesis on wartime Bulgaria, where he insisted that he was really opposed to the Nazi regime and successfully worked to save Bulgaria's Jewish population from deportation. Chary wrote in 2014 that nearly everything Beckerle had told him was a lie. In what appeared to be an attempt at blackmail, when the trial finally began in 1967, Beckerle's lawyers tried repeatedly to call the West German chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger who was a friend of Beckerle under the Third Reich as a witness for his trial. On 27 June 1968, in an unusual legal ruling, the judge declared that Beckerle's health was such that to try him might kill him and dismissed all of the charges against him. Beckerle died of a heart attack in 1976, a free man.

Si Ouey allegedly killed several children throughout the 1950s before being arrested in 1958 and executed in 1959. According to some sources, Si Ouey was the first serial killer in the history of modern Thailand.  Biography  Much of Si Ouey's history is unknown; the Thai department of corrections was never contacted by a family member, and as of 2020 Si Ouey was considered stateless. One source states that Si Ouey was born in Shantou, China in 1927, and that he later fought during the Second Sino-Japanese War. According to Thai government records, Si Ouey engaged in cannibalism during the war, eating parts of his fellow soldiers when supplies ran low during a siege. He emigrated to Thailand after the war. During the 1950's, Si Ouey worked in a number of menial roles (several sources describe him as a gardener) before beginning his killings. From 1954 to 1958, Si Ouey killed several (sources disagree on whether four, five, or six) Thai children, allegedly disemboweling, boiling, and eating his victims. Active in Bangkok, Nakhon Pathom, and Rayong, Si Ouey was arrested (reportedly while attempting to burn a body) by Thai police in 1958 after which he confessed to the murders. According to Thai records, Si Ouey confessed to police that he targeted children as they were easier to lure. He also allegedly admitted to enjoying the taste of human flesh, but later denied being a cannibal. He was tried, sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad in 1959 at the age of 32. Si Ouey's remains were preserved and used for medical testing before being embalmed and put on display Siriraj Medical Museum in Bangkok. While most sources state that Si Ouey committed the murders, others have called into question his confession and trial. Several note that Si Ouey spoke no Thai and as such may not have given an accurate confession, and that he was forced to use a translator during his trial. Anti- Chinese and anti-immigrant sentiment may have also played a roll in Si Ouey's trial. A campaign by humanitarian activists successfully campaigned for Si Ouey's corpse to be removed from display in August 2019, and in July 2020 his remains were cremated at Wat Bang Phraek Tai temple.

The Toronto Typographical Union (TTU) was an early Canadian trade union in the printing industry. Founded in 1832, it came to prominence in 1872 when it organized a major strike in Toronto. Membership declined in the mid- to late-20th century as printing turned digital. By 1994, TTU had been absorbed by the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada.  Origins  The association that would become the Toronto Typographical Union was first organized in 1832 as the York Typographical Union. This association, which was renamed the Toronto Typographical Society in 1835, survived only to 1837. It was reorganized in 1844 to counter newspaper publisher George Brown's efforts to lower printing workers' wages. In May 1866, the then‚ÄìToronto Typographical Society joined the National Typographical Union to become, officially, Toronto Typographical Union No. 91. The National Typographical Union, organized beginning in December 1850, was based in the United States. Zerker argues that, as a consequence, TTU came under \\"foreign domination\\". Burr suggests that this overstates the point, as TTU's members in Toronto supported its move to become a local of the American organization.  1872 printers' strike  Among other activities, TTU is known for its role in organizing a strike on March 25, 1872, known as the Toronto printers' strike. Historian Robert H. Babcock describes it as \\"one of the most important events in Canadian labour history\\". TTU organized the strike as part of the Nine-Hour Movement for a workday of nine hours, a demand that unions in Britain and the United States (in the latter case, for an eight-hour workday), were making around the same time. TTU and the print workers it represented announced their demand for a nine-hour day, with no accompanying pay cut, on March 13, 1872. Their bosses‚Äîthen still known as master printers‚Äîrefused the offer on March 19, with one exception. James Beaty, a Conservative politician and editor of the Toronto Leader, accepted TTU's demands and even wrote in favour of their cause. The strike began on March 25. George Brown, publisher of the The Globe (now The Globe and Mail), vehemently opposed the strike, and arranged for the arrest of its leaders. Strike supporters rallied again in large numbers at Queen's Park on April 15, 1872. Twenty-three TTU organizers were arrested for conspiracy on April 16, and a trial began on April 18. At the time, Canadian law made no exception for unions to the general common law rules governing the crime of conspiracy: a union committee's \\"conspiracy\\" to disrupt a commercial enterprise with a strike was no different in law from any other agreement to disturb the peace. The organizers were accordingly convicted. Shortly after the Queen's Park rally, Prime Minister John A. MacDonald introduced the Trade Unions Act, 1872 in the House of Commons, which made certain forms of union activity legal. The Act was based on two statutes that had recently been adopted in Britain: the Trade Union Act 1871 and Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871. It passed on June 14, 1872.  Decline  The rise of computer-based printing in the 1960s and 1970s largely rendered manual typesetting obsolete. Accordingly, TTU membership declined precipitously during this period, beginning with a lengthy newspaper strike that began in 1964. As of January 1978, TTU had just over 1,300 members. The union was still active in Mississauga as of 1987, when it won a settlement on behalf of 30 workers at Burlington Air Express (now BAX Global) at the Ontario Labour Relations Board. It had become a local of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada by 1994.

At age three, Sardula's wins included the prestigious Grade 1 Kentucky Oaks. Breeding Sardula was bred by William T. Young at his Overbrook Farm near Lexington, Kentucky in conjunction with M&M; Stables, a Lexington based venture formed by Bob McCann of McCann Bloodstock agency and Pope McLean, Sr. of Crestwood Farm. She was purchased for $40,000 by recording industry executive Jerry Moss and his wife Ann who turned over the somewhat high-strung filly's race conditioning to Brian Mayberry, a trainer widely respected for his ability and patience with temperamental young horses. Sardula was sired by Storm Cat, twice the Leading sire in North America, three times the Leading broodmare sire in North America plus the Leading Juvenile Sire in North America a record seven times. Among other notable progeny, Storm Cat sired Aljabr, Black Minnaloushe, Cat Thief, Forestry, Giant's Causeway, Jalil, Life Is Sweet, Storm Flag Flying and Tabasco Cat. Sardula's Canadian-bred grandsire Storm Bird raced in England where he was the Top-rated European two-year-old of the 1980 official International Classification, and that year's Timeform top two- year-old given an above average rating of 134. Storm Bird sired 63 stakes winners, including 1990 Preakness Stakes winner Summer Squall and was the broodmare sire of runners with more than one hundred stakes wins to their credit, including the 1995 Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes winner Thunder Gulch. Sardula's dam was the unraced Honor an Offer who was also the dam of the very good racemare Imperial Gesture whose career earnings totaled more than U.S $1.4 million. Sardula's damsire, Hoist the Flag, was the 1970 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt and at stud was the 1987 Leading broodmare sire in North America. Hoist the flag was the son of Tom Rolfe who won the 1965 Preakness Stakes and was voted that year's American Champion Three-Year- Old Male Horse. Tom Rolfe was sired by the undefeated two-time Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Ribot. A horse widely regarded as one of the greatest in the history of Thoroughbred racing worldwide, Ribot became the Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1963, 1967, and 1968. Racing career Making her career debut on August 7, 1993 at Del Mar Racetrack under jockey Eddie Delahoussaye, the two-year-old Sardula ran away from the field to win by ten lengths. On September 4 at the same racetrack she won the Debutante Stakes defeating runner-up Phone Chatter who came back on November 6 to beat Sardula by a nose in the ensuing Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. In her final race as a two-year-old, on December 18th Sardula won the Grade 1 Hollywood Starlet Stakes at Hollywood Park. Racing at age three, Sardula's first start on April 9, 1994 was a winning one by 8 ¬Ω lengths in the Santa Paula Stakes at Santa Anita Park. On May 6 Sardula got the most important win of her career in the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs in which she defeated Lakeway by a short head after they had raced head-to-head down the homestretch.

Lakeway avenged her May 6 loss to Sardula on July 10, beating her by 4 ¬Ω lengths in the mile and one-eighth Hollywood Oaks in a time of 1:46 4/5 that was just a fifth of a second off the track record. Sardula finished fifth in her next start that marked the only occasion she would ever finish off the board. It happened when she ran for the first time on turf in the August 21 Del Mar Invitational Oaks. Life-ending illness Sardula suffered from what appeared to be a leg injury that kept her out of racing but plans were to retire her to breeding. In October of 1994, veterinarians diagnosed her problem as Osteomyelitis, a degenerative bacterial infection which had attacked her right foreleg. Treatment did nothing to help the condition and on February 1, 1995 Sardula was humanely euthanized at the Alamo Pintado Equine Research Center near Los Olivos, California.

It was published on February 9, 2010, by Atheneum Books for Young Readers.  Plot  Danish 7th grader Pierre Anthon tells his classmates about his existential dread. Upon doing so, he leaves school, returning to his home, where he lives with his dad. He takes residence in a plum tree. Agnes, the narrator, decides to work with her classmates in an attempt to convince Pierre that life has a purpose, and to convince him to give up living in the plum tree in favor of returning to school. The classmates decide to create a \\"heap of meaning,\\" which is a collection of one personal sacrifice from each participant. The personal item that is sacrificed is chosen due to its meaning to the person who is giving it to the heap. A classmate named Dennis begins the heap by giving up his Dungeons and Dragons books, and then challenging another classmate Sebastian to give up his fishing rod. Sebastian complies, and asks Laura to sacrifice her earrings, and she does. The classmates begin to see the heap as a game of who can come up with the most difficult thing to sacrifice to the heap? Agnes is forced to sacrifice her new sandals, and as a result she forces Gerda¬¥s pet hamster. The children begin to sacrifice darker and darker things, including their virginity, their fingers, and animals. Law Enforcement and the media get involved, and the heap begins to receive national coverage. The classmates sell the heap to a museum for 3.6 million dollars. Pierre is still not convinced, citing the sale of the heap as rendering it meaningless. Sofie begins to wreak havoc, causing the entire group of classmates to break out into violence. Agnes flees the unfolding violence and pleads with Pierre to give up his existential dread and come down from the tree, which he agrees to. He comes to see the bloody violence, and scolds the classmates as being idiotic. He is then murdered, and the novel ends with Agnes reflecting back upon the events.  Reception  The novel has received positive reviews, with a rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Goodreads. The novel has received various awards, including a nomination for the Garden State Teen Book Award.

It is one of the northernmost operational railway station in Greece, close to Turkish border. History The station opened in 1874 when the line, built by the Chemins de fer Orientaux (CO), from Istanbul to Vienna opened. The railway reached Neo Cheimonio in 1873, when the line from Istanbul to Edirne and Bulgaria was opened. When the railway was built it was all within the Ottoman Empire. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, its remaining imperial possessions were divided.

Under the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, a new border between Greece and Turkey was established at the Evros river, just east of Ftelia railway station, which had the result that the railway from Istanbul to Bulgaria entered Greece at Pythio, then re-entered Turkey at Edirne (Karaaƒüa√ß railway station), re- entered Greece at Marasia, and finally entered Bulgaria between Ormenio and Svilengrad. This arrangement continued until 1971, when two new lines were opened. In Turkey, the Edirne Cut-off was opened to allow trains from Istanbul to Bulgaria to run through Edirne entirely on Turkish territory, so that trains such as the Orient Express no longer passed through Feres. In Greece, a line was opened to allow trains from Pythio to Bulgaria to stay on Greek territory and avoid Edirne. In 1954 the CFFH was absorbed by the Hellenic State Railways. In 1971, the Hellenic State Railways was reorganised into the OSE Law 674/1971, Government Gazette A-192/1970 taking over responsibilities for most for Greece‚Äôs rail infrastructure. In the 1990s, OSE introduced the InterCity service to the Alexandroupoli‚ÄìSvilengrad linehttps://www.radioevros.gr/epeidi-ta-traina-einai-gemata-anthrwpous-kai- istories-kai-oxi-mono-eisitiria-kai-arithmous/ Which reduced travel times across the whole line.

The package of measures aims to build or improve transport connections and connectivity across Europe, with a focus on sustainable transport. The project for the Pythian-Ormenio section envisions upgrading the existing line infrastructure and trackbed, doubling of the track as well as the installation of electrification signalling (ETCS Level 1) along the entire stretch, with the aim of improving freight transport with Bulgaria and Turkey.

On 19 March, a nation-wide lockdown was established in Argentina until 31 March. The government later extended the lockdown through April, and May. On 9 May, the nationwide lockdown was lifted, excepting the Greater Buenos Aires urban area (where 31.9% of the country's population lives), with this area being locked down until 24 May, later extended to 7 June, and then 28 June, after a big jump in the number of new cases in this area. On 26 June, Fern√°ndez announced that the previously-eased restrictions on movement in this area would be tightened again until 17 July due to a large spike in cases on the previous days. Finally, on 17 July, the lockdown was due to be gradually loosened in several stages to lead to the return to normality, although restrictions were extended several times until at least 20 September. Claims were made on police brutality, domestic violence, human trafficking, and the right to freedom of movement.  Police brutality  During the COVID-19 pandemic, several police brutality cases took place in Argentina. The country has several levels of security forces: Federal (such as National Gendarmerie), Provincial (Buenos Aires Provincial Police, for example) and local (Local Police of Ezeiza, for example), According to NGO CORREPI, 92 people died in hands of police forces during the pandemic. Of those, 34 deaths were a result of trigger-happy policemen (gatillo f√°cil), 45 were deaths during police custody, 3 were forced disappearances, and one death was result of a clash between police forces. This report also states that in 50 of those cases, provincial security forces were involved, other 27 cases had provincial prison guards involved, in 7 federal security forces were involved, and in other 7, the Buenos Aires City Police. Sabrina Frederic, national Minister of Security, denied an increase on police brutality, claiming that her office had received 39 complaints during this period. Horacio Pietragalla, national Secretariat for Human Resources, stated that his office received 531 complaints on police response during the pandemic. Sabrina Corio, resident of Bariloche, was arrested on 7 August by the R√≠o Negro Provincial Police for taking her dog out for a walk in a day in which, according to the sanitary lockdown measures, she was forbidden to do so. She was kept in custody, in solitary confinement, for seven hours. She claimed she was beaten while getting up a police patrol, that no basic hygiene measures were provided, and that police was unable to tell her where she was being taken. Also, water was refused to her. Sabrina declared having been kidnapped by the police. After being liberated, following social media pressure, she reported threatens were made in her house. The police, which used five agents and a SUV to take the woman into custody, claimed she resisted arrest. Gustavo Gennusso, then-mayor of Bariloche, demanded an explanation to the province's Ministry of Security, claiming no person should be mistreated. A legal process was started on Sabrina on violations of the 205 article of the Argentine Penal Code: violating measures taken to prevent the spread of an epidemic. Other cases attracted special nationwide public attention in the country: = Luis Espinoza Case = On 15 May, Luis Espinoza was murdered and then disappeared by the Provincial Police of Tucum√°n, in the north of Argentina, following an operation of lockdown control during an illegal horse race in the town of Melcho, where Luis was passing by. After struggling with the police, the man was shot by the back. His body was then moved to the local police precinct, wrapped in plastic and bed sheets, and taken afterwards to the neighbor province of Catamarca, where it was dropped into a ravine. The UN, through the OHCHR, started an investigation on the case. = Florencia Magal√≠ Morales Case = Florencia Magal√≠ Morales was found hanged in a police cell on 5 April in Santa Rosa de Conlara, San Luis Province. That same day, she had left in her bicycle to buy groceries, when provincial police stopped her for allegedly driving in the wrong way of the street and violating the lockdown, as her DNI ending number didn't allow her to leave home on that day. Police claimed the death a suicide, something denied by her family. Two witnesses, other prisoners in that same precinct, stated that Florencia screamed for help for hours, but they were transferred after hearing that, leaving the woman alone in the place. An autopsy claimed the death could have been caused either by the shoelace found in the scene or by a precision knock in the cervical vertebrae area. No witness saw the body hanging. In August, a new autopsy was performed, requested by Florencia's family. Protests followed the death in the city, and the National Ministry of Security made claims to the San Luis Province government. The UN included the death in a femicide list. = Valentino Blas Correa Case = Valentino Blas Correa, a 17-year-old boy from the C√≥rdoba Province, was killed by the police on 6 August after skipping a police checkpoint in C√≥rdoba, fearing his car would be taken for violating the lockdown. Facundo Astudillo Castro = Facundo Astudillo Case = Facundo Astudillo Castro disappeared on 30 April, after being stopped and fined for lockdown violation by the Buenos Aires Provincial Police. His last known picture shows him in front of police patrol SUV number RO 23360. There is an ongoing investigation on the matter, with no arrested suspects. It was cataloged by the victim family as a Forced disappearance in hands of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police. This theory was also followed by human rights activist Estela de Carlotto. The cased fueled claims by the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances (OHCHR) as well as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Several public statements were made by Argentine President, Alberto Fern√°ndez, and Buenos Aires Governor, Axel Kicillof. His body remains were found on 15 August 2020, in an advanced state of decomposition, in an area between the cities of General Daniel Cerri and Villarino Viejo.  Domestic violence  During the 120 first days of lockdown, the Domestic Violence Bureau (dependent on the Supreme Court) received 1280 reports of intrafamily violence. The number of women killed reached a 10-year high during the COVID-19 lockdown. San Mart√≠n Line car advertising the 144 emergency telephone number against gender violence As the lockdown meant for many women to be forced to spend the day with their aggressors, an email and three WhatsApp contact numbers were created. There were also Facebook, Twitter and Telegram accounts active for reporting violence cases, as well as the 144 emergency telephone number. Reporting the cases by text messages brings the victim the benefit of being able to delete the message after sending it, avoiding it to be seen by the aggressor. Also, the National General Defensory launched the #NoEst√°sSola campaign (#YouAreNotAlone) to prevent and fight domestic violence, informing that the lockdown allowed victims to reach a police precinct. Domestic violence was called \\"the other pandemic\\" in Argentina by the UN. Following this statements, the Spotlight Initiative, and EU/UN partnership to fight domestic violence, launched in the country two advertising campaigns designed for a lockdown context. Several hotels gave free rooms to be used as refugees by women suffering domestic violence and not having to spend the lockdown with their aggressors. On 19 March 2020, the National Appeals Civil Court determined a 60-day extension on all injunctions regarding personal protection, among them: panic buttons and restraining orders. On 13 May, the measures were extended once again for 60 days. According to Estela D√≠az, Minister of Women, Gender Policies and Diversity for the Buenos Aires Province, domestic violence claims decreased as the lockdown made them more dangerous, since the victim had to came back to live all day with the aggressor after filing a complaint. On a national level, the 144 emergency phone number for gender violence received 34,494 calls during the lockdown (between 20 March and 30 June), a 28% higher number than on the same period of the previous year. In the capital city, Buenos Aires, a 48% year-on- year increase in gender violence calls was registered on the 144 line. In the Buenos Aires Province, a 35% year-on-year increase in gender violence calls was registered, with 5,903 calls to the 144 line between March and July. The Minister of Women, Gender Policies and Diversity for the Buenos Aires Province pointed that femicides were the only crime not going down during the lockdown, and that in 80% of those cases the assailant is the victim's couple or ex- couple. In Salta Province, the Observatory on Violence against Women pointed out that during the lockdown (as of July 2020) a 10% year-on-year increase in gender violence had been registered.  Freedom of movement  Coronel Suarez, Buenos Aires As part of the pandemic response, the government of Argentina established heavy restrictions on travelling and movement. This included checkpoints in the province's borders and the entrances to several cities (some including dirt barricades). President Fern√°ndez stated: \\"The freedom of the people is not in dispute, but the first condition of being free is to be alive\\". Lockdown offenders were prosecuted under the 205 article of the Argentine Penal Code: violating measures taken to prevent the spread of an epidemic, which could led to 2 years prison sentences. This was one of several claims which fueled the 17A protests. Truck drivers also criticized the roadblocks and lockdown control measures in roads, stating they had to wait for up to 20 hours in police checkpoints. Truck doors were also sealed while transiting some provinces, in which cases the drivers were unable to even make a bathroom stop for hours. This was considered inhumane by truck drivers. On September, a trucker had a heart attack while en route, and was refused medical care in two provinces, having to wait over 16 hours to be admitted in a hospital. Another truck driver was jailed for 14 days for getting down to check on his cargo. On August, a woman died of cancer without being able to be visited by his father, who had received the required permits to travel. He was denied entrance to the C√≥rdoba province for not complying with showing a negative PCR test for COVID-19, despite having two quick tests performed, which were qualified as \\"dubious\\" by provincial police. He was escorted by police back to his home province Neuqu√©n. An 71 years-old man died in September after the ambulance he was being transported in was refused entrance to La Pampa province. Olympic rower Ariel Su√°rez trained in the Luj√°n River in Tigre, challenging the lockdown measures. He was fined by the Naval Prefecture, and Ministry of Health Gines Gonzales Garc√≠a stated that although rowing was not permitted, it could be if a request was made, as he saw no risk in the sport. Commercial flights were restricted from April to, at least, September, following one of the longest lockdowns worldwide. By September 2020, Argentina was the biggest aviation market in its region still not allowing commercial flights. IATA repeatedly criticized government policies on aviation, and its regional VP for Americas, Peter Cerd√°, stated: \\"We worry about Argentina becoming the next Venezuela, moving from being a key aviation market in the region to having a very limited connectivity\\". Following this travel ban, one of the most strict in the world, airline LATAM Argentina closed on 17 June.  Government response  Modular Hospital in the Southern Greater Buenos Aires Area = Right to health and life = The Fernandez administration took several measures to soften the impact of the pandemic, increasing hospital beds, purchasing ventilators and medicines. The country's health system had been in bad shape for years after several budget cuts. In March 2020, the government declared a Healthcare Emergency in the country. Eleven modular hospitals were built in the Greater Areas of Buenos Aires, C√≥rdoba, Resistencia and Rosario. Alberto Fern√°ndez, as he declared a nationwide lockdown on 20 March 2020 = Refusal to declare the State of Emergency = When ruling the lockdown, President Alberto Fernandez had to choose for whether declaring or not the State of Emergency (Estado de Sitio), a constitutional emergency state designed for \\"internal commotion or external attack\\" cases. He refused to declare so, backed by province Governors Alicia Kirchner, Gustavo Melella and Mariano Arcioni, while other Governors as Gerardo Morales, Gerardo Zamora, Omar Perotti, Luis Manzur, Ricardo Quintela and Sergio U√±ac, favored declaring it. Both parties finally agreed on not declaring the emergency state, but the discussion on whether it was the right call or not went on for weeks.

She is an associate professor of Medicine and Epidemiology & Population Health at Stanford University and an oncologist at the Stanford Cancer Institute. Early life and education Kurian was born to two academic parents; Diana Chapman Walsh, the former President of Wellesley College, and Christopher T. Walsh, a biochemist at Harvard University. Kurian earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Human Biology at Stanford University before earning her medical degree from Harvard Medical School. She completed her residency training in Internal Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital and her medical fellowship in Medical Oncology at Stanford University, where she was simultaneously earning a master's degree in Epidemiology. Career Upon completing her fellowship, Kurian accepted a research scholar position supported by a Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health K12 award. In her role as an instructor in the Division of Oncology at the Stanford Cancer Genetics Clinic, she partook in an international study focusing on experimental technology to bring higher resolution and fewer risks than mammography and magnetic resonance imaging. In March 2008, she was appointed an assistant professor of medicine and health research and policy at Stanford University. Her research focus was on identifying risk for breast and ovarian cancer. By July, she received a Physician Faculty Scholars Award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to fund her study, \\"Optimizing the use of breast cancer risk-reduction strategies by patients and physicians.\\" Kurian and her research team discovered that models used to identify cancer risks in women worked better on white women than other ethnic groups. In a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, she specifically addressed how computer models failed in predicting the presence of dangerous genetic mutations in Asian women compared to white women. In 2011, Kurian collaborated with epidemiologist and biostatistician Alice S. Whittemore to examine how women related to patients of hereditary mutation breast cancer, but lacked the mutation themselves, were of no higher risk of getting cancer than relatives of patients with other types of breast cancer. The next year, she was appointed director of Stanford Women's Clinical Cancer Genetics Program and sat on the Advisory Committee for the California Health Care Foundation. In this role, she continued to research on the identification of women with elevated breast and gynecologic cancer risk and the development of new techniques for early cancer detection and risk reduction. This resulted in the development of an online tool that helps people with BRCA mutations make preventive care decisions. In 2014, she conducted a study with Scarlett Gomez which found that breast cancer patients who undergo bilateral mastectomy are not guaranteed better survival rates. On December 1, 2015, Kurian was promoted to associate professor of medicine, health research, and policy. In this role, she collaborated with doctors at Emory University and the University of Michigan to study 83,000 women diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer in California and Georgia between 2013 and 2014. The result of the study revealed that fewer than a quarter of the patients studied underwent genetic testing for cancer-associated mutations, thus highlighting gaps between national guidelines for testing and actual testing practices. In 2020, she was elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation.

Owen reported it was located on the Etowah River, while Albert J. Pickett stated it was built on Coosahatchie Creek. Most evidence points to it being located on the north bank of the Coosa River near Turkeytown and present-day Cedar Bluff. Fort Armstrong was built in October 1813 by soldiers under the command of General James White, who was serving under General John Alexander Cocke. The fort was named for John Armstrong Jr., who was the Secretary of War at that time. The fort was built to help protect the local Cherokee from incursions by Red Sticks but also in anticipation of a future assault on the Red Sticks. Boats were assembled at Fort Armstrong to transport supplies further down the Coosa River. Fort Armstrong was in turn supplied by wagons from Fort Ross.Braund 2012, p. 123. Prior to the Battle of Talladega, General Andrew Jackson ordered General White and his troops to proceed to and guard Fort Strother. General Cocke simultaneously ordered White to return to Fort Armstrong due to the known lack of supplies at Fort Strother. En route to Fort Armstrong, White attacked the Hillabee and destroyed their towns without knowing they had declared peace with Jackson. Cherokee soldiers who were part of Jackson's forces were stationed at Fort Armstrong. The Cherokee soldiers were allowed to participate in individual raids against the Red Sticks.Braund 2012, p. 126. After the Battle of Talladega and the Hillabee Massacre, many Cherokee continued to be stationed at Fort Armstrong even though they were furloughed by Jackson. In January and February 1814, they were part of the 2nd Regiment East Tennessee Volunteer Militia and helped guard supply and communication lines. Some of the soldiers also guarded Pathkiller and his residence in Turkeytown. The Cherokee who remained at Fort Armstrong built a council house and square ground.Braund 2012, p. 129. Colonel Gideon Morgan oversaw the Cherokee soldiers from Fort Armstrong and was in constant communication with their Indian agent, Return J. Meigs Sr. On March 2, 1814, Colonel Morgan gave orders to his adjutant, John Ross, to rendezvous at Fort Armstrong with the remaining Cherokee forces and march to Fort Strother. Colonel John Williams and the 39th Infantry Regiment simultaneously transferred supplies from Fort Armstrong to Fort Williams to aide Jackson's forces in anticipation of the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.Braund 2012, p. 132. John Ross and his brother Andrew operated a store at the site of Fort Armstrong after the Creek War. After Fort Armstrong no longer had a military use, a ferry operated at the site. The original fort site is unknown. The Jacksonville State University Archaeological Resource Laboratory has performed archaeological investigations on Pruett's Island, which is thought to be the approximate location of Fort Armstrong. It is possible the site was inundated by the formation of Weiss Lake. The 1st and 2nd Regiment of East Tennessee Militia, the 1st and 2nd Regiment Tennessee Volunteer Infantry, the 1st Regiment Volunteer Mounted Infantry, and a detachment of the 8th Brigade of Tennessee Militia were all stationed at Fort Armstrong at some point.

She was his youngest known murder victim, although not his youngest victim (he later confessed to attacking 14-year old Tracy Brown two years earlier). Her death led to widespread coverage of the murders, public furore and rising anger amongst women. Early life Jayne Michelle McDonald, born in Leeds in 1960, was the second child of Wilfred McDonald (a railwayman) and his wife Irene. She had two half-sisters - Carole and Janet (born 1957) - from her mother's first marriage, and siblings Debra (born 1961) and Ian (born 1964). Carole married Victor in 1964 and moved with him to Johannesburg, South Africa with Janet remaining with her mother and half-siblings. Jayne had recently left Allerton High School and since April 1977 had been working as a shop assistant in the shoe department at Grandways supermarket. She was described in police reports as being with shoulder length brown hair. She was a Bay City Rollers fan and enjoyed dancing and roller skating. Murder On 25 June 1977, Jayne went to meet friends at the Hofbrauhaus, a German-style Bierkeller in Leeds. There she met a man and spent the evening with him, arranging to meet him again later that week. Jayne missed her last bus home and failed to get a taxi so ended up walking home. She was attacked by Sutcliffe in Reginald Street in Leeds at around 2 am. Her body was discovered the following morning at 9.45 am by children in the playground between Reginald Terrace and Reginald Street in Chapeltown. A post mortem exam was carried out by the Home Office Pathologist Professor David Gee. The extent of her injuries was not revealed at the time by police although it was subsequently revealed she had been hit on the head three times with a hammer and had been stabbed in the chest and back. A broken bottle was found embedded in her chest. Jayne was buried in Harehills Cemetery, Leeds, West Yorkshire on 20 December 1977. Aftermath of murder =Change of perception= Jayne's death marked a change in the tide of the investigation into the Yorkshire Ripper murders - primarily because of her youth and innocence. She was said to be his first \\"non-prostitute\\" murder victim, his youngest murder victim and his fifth known murder victim. Jayne's death highlighted the sexist attitudes of both the police and press at the time, with the police describing her as a ‚Äúrespectable young girl‚Äù who was a chance victim. The Byford Report was critical of this point, noting that the murder of Jayne MacDonald elicited a more sympathetic response from both the public and the press, and arguing that police should not have assumed that Sutcliffe \\"wrongly identified MacDonald as a prostitute\\". Jayne's family lived on the same street as one of Sutcliffe's earlier victims, Wilma McCann, and strenuously objected to the way victims were divided into categories. Jayne's sister Debra said: ‚ÄúI do remember Mum and Dad feeling really angry about that - the division of victims into good women and bad. It was terrible and none of us saw it that way.‚Äù In a public appeal Irene MacDonald commented: \\"\\"How many more must die before people wake up and realize it could happen to someone they love? I feel that if (the victims) had all been Sunday school teachers, the public would have come forward with clues and the man would have been found by now.\\" Journalist Henry Matthews commented: ‚ÄúPrior to that point, the fear, if you like, had been exclusively felt by working prostitutes. But from Jayne McDonald on there was this feeling that no woman was safe.‚Äù After Jayne's murder there was a public outcry and the next day West Yorkshire police begin to circulate information about the murders of Jayne MacDonald, along with that of Wilma McCann, Emily Jackson, Patricia Atkinson and Irene Richardson. This marked the point at which the attacks were seen as \\"something truly heinous\\" and there is significant, systematic urgency to catch the Yorkshire Ripper. =Reclaim the Night Movement= Jayne's murder changed the police's and press's perception of the Yorkshire Ripper murders (later discovered to be by Peter Sutcliffe) and resulted in public furore and increasing anger amongst women. The police reaction led to the Reclaim the Night movement being formed in 1977. Women - particularly in Leeds and the North of England - felt the police response to the Yorkshire Ripper murders was slow and that the press had barely reported on them until Jayne's murder. Although her murder led to more coverage, the police responded by telling women not to go out at night, effectively putting them under curfew. Feminists and a variety of student and women‚Äôs groups were angered by this response, as well as by the sensationalising of the serial murders. This led to the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group calling for women to march in cities across the UK on the night of 12 November 1977 against rape and for a woman‚Äôs right to walk without fear at night. =Sutcliffe's testimony= When Sutcliffe was apprehended in 1981 he admitted to feeling regret about Jayne's killing. He said he thought she was a prostitute because she was walking through a red light district in the early hours of the morning, saying: \\"I felt like someone inhuman and I realised that it was a devil driving me against my will and that I was a beast\\". =Family's reaction= Irene MacDonald, Jayne's mother, was reported to have said that she wished Sutcliffe was going to the gallows. \\"I hope other prisoners have the decency to make every minute he is inside a living hell for him,\\" she said. On 5 March 1982, Irene MacDonald made legal history when a High Court registrar in Leeds awarded her damages of ¬£6,722 against Peter Sutcliffe for the death of her daughter. Wilfred MacDonald, who had to identify Jayne's body, was not well and was so broken by her death that he died two years later (1979) at the age of 60. He was buried with his daughter.

A member of this family is called a mongoose or a herpestid. They are widespread primarily throughout Africa and south Asia, and are found primarily in forests, savannas, shrublands, and grasslands, though some species can be found in wetlands or deserts. Most mongooses are 30‚Äì60 cm (12‚Äì24 in) long, plus a 20‚Äì40 cm (8‚Äì16 in) tail, though the Ethiopian dwarf mongoose can be as small as 18 cm (7 in) plus a 12 cm (5 in) tail, and the white-tailed mongoose can be up to 104 cm (41 in) plus a 47 cm (14 in) tail. Most species do not have population estimates, though one, the Liberian mongoose, is classified as vulnerable with a population size of around 5,000. No herpestid species have been domesticated. The 34 species of Herpestidae are split into 14 genera within 2 subfamilies: Herpestinae, comprising 23 extant species that are native to southern Europe, Africa and Asia, and Mungotinae, comprising 11 extant species native to Africa. Extinct species have also been placed into both subfamiles, though some older extinct species have not been categorized into a subfamily. Around ten extinct Herpestidae species have been discovered, though due to ongoing research and discoveries the exact number and categorization is not fixed. Herpestidae is believed to have diverged from the existing Feliformia suborder around 21.8 million years ago in the Early Miocene. Conventions Conservation status codes listed follow the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Range maps are provided wherever possible; if a range map is not available, a description of the herpestid's range is provided. Ranges are based on the IUCN red list for that species unless otherwise noted. Classification The family Herpestidae consists of 34 extant species belonging to 14 genera in 2 subfamilies and divided into dozens of extant subspecies. This does not include hybrid species or extinct prehistoric species. * Subfamily Herpestinae ** Genus Atilax: one species ** Genus Bdeogale: three species ** Genus Cynictis: one species ** Genus Galerella: five species ** Genus Herpestes: ten species ** Genus Ichneumia: one species ** Genus Paracynictis: one species ** Genus Rhynchogale: one species * Subfamily Mungotinae ** Genus Crossarchus: four species ** Genus Dologale: one species ** Genus Helogale: two species ** Genus Liberiictis: one species ** Genus Mungos: two species ** Genus Suricata: one species Herpestids The following classification is based on the taxonomy described by Mammal Species of the World (2005), with augmentation by generally accepted proposals made since using molecular phylogenetic analysis. This includes the promotion of the black mongoose subspecies of the slender mongoose to a full species. =Subfamily Herpestinae= =Subfamily Mungotinae= Prehistoric herpestids In addition to extant herpestids, a number of prehistoric species have been discovered and classified as a part of herpestidae. There is no generally accepted classification of extinct herpestid species. In addition to being placed within extant genera in the extant subfamilies Herpestinae and Mungotinae, several have not been classified within a subfamily.

He was awarded the Acharius Medal in 1992 for his lifetime contributions to lichenology. Early life and education Santesson was born in 1916 in Trollh√§ttan, Sweden. He was already collecting lichens as a student, investigating the lichen flora of the table mountains of Halleberg and Hunneberg near his home. He entered the University of Uppsala in the 1930s to study botany. It was here he met the flamboyant Professor of Plant Ecology and lichen taxonomist Gustaf Einar Du Rietz, with whom he undertook studies on crustose lichens found on shoreline rocks of Swedish lakes. This work led to a lifelong interest in marine lichens. He earned a B.Sc. in 1938, followed by an M.Sc. in 1939. That same year, joined by zoologist Christian Olrog, Santesson embarked on what was supposed to be an eight-month research excursion in Patagonia (southern South America). Because of the outbreak of war, which made sea travel unsafe, it instead lasted almost two years. Santesson was able to make comprehensive collections with detailed field note-books. Olrog wrote a book in Swedish about their trip called Destination Eldslandet (1943), which tracked the adventures of the expedition. After his return Santesson worked on taxonomic treatments of the material he collected from South America, which resulted in the revision of several genera, including Menegazzia, Cladina, Dolichocarpus, Xanthopeltis, and calicioid lichens. His work on Menegazzia has been called \\"an important and basic landmark in South American lichenology\\". Career In 1946 he moved to Uppsala, where he worked from 1946 to 1950 as an assistant teacher, and from 1953‚Äì1958 as Associate Professor at the University of Uppsala. From 1937 to 1946 he was Assistant at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm. In 1952, Santesson became a Ph.D., defending a doctoral dissertation on foliicolous lichens. From 1973 to 1981, Santesson was Professor and Director of the Botanical Department at Stockholm's Swedish Museum of Natural History. After his retirement in 1982, Santesson continued working at the Botanical Museum in Uppsala, where he researched lichen parasites as well as helped compile several editions of the book series Lichens of Sweden and Norway. Santesson undertook major lichen- collecting expeditions throughout the world, including Europe (British Isles, France, Madeira, Portugal, Switzerland, Spain); North America (United States; Mexico) Tenerife; Iceland; Africa (Kenya and Tanzania); South America (Patagonia; Peru); and Asia (China; Far East of Russia). Recognition Santesson was awarded the Acharius Medal in 1992 for his lifetime contributions to lichenology. He had a Festschrift dedicated to him for his 80th birthday in 1997. He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and an Honorary Member of the British Lichen Society. =Epynomy= Santesson has had four genera named in his honour: *Rolfidium *Santessonia *Santessoniella *Santessoniolichen Many species have been named after Santesson, including the following: Arthonia santessoniana ; Arthonia santessonii ; Ascochyta santessonii ; Bachmanniomyces santessonii ; Capronia santessoniana ; Cecidiomyces santessonii ; Chroodiscus santessonii ; Collema santessonii ; Corticifraga santessonii ; Fellhanera santessonii ; Halecania santessonii ; Hobsonia santessonii ; Karschia santessonii ; Laurera santessonii ; Lecidea santessonii ; Lettauia santessonii ; Micropeltopsis santessonii ; Nectriella santessonii ; Odontotrema santessonii ; Opegrapha santessonii ; Pannaria rolfii ; Pannaria santessonii ; Pannaria santessonii ; Peltula santessonii ; Physcia rolfii ; Porina santessonii ; Pronectria rolfiana ; Protothelenella santessonii ; Pseudocyphellaria santessonii ; Pyrenidium santessonii ; Rhizocarpon santessonii ; Sticta santessonii ; Stirtonia santessonii ; Taeniolella rolfii ; Taeniolella santessonii ; Thelomma santessonii ; Thelotrema santessonii ; Tremella santessonii ; Tricharia santessoniana ; Tricharia santessonii ; Usnea santessonii ; Verrucaria santessonii ; Vouauxiomyces santessonii ; Xanthoparmelia santessonii ; and Zwackhiomyces rolfii .

The battery was organized in June 1861. It fought at Shiloh, First Corinth, and Second Corinth in 1862. Subsequently, the unit garrisoned Corinth, Mississippi until January 1864. It was stationed at Memphis, Tennessee until June 1864 when it fought at Brices Cross Roads. The battery garrisoned Memphis until it was mustered out in July 1865. Personnel Battery B, 2nd Illinois Artillery Regiment was organized at Springfield, Illinois and mustered into Federal service on 20 June 1861. The original officers were Captain Relly Madison of Marshall, First Lieutenants Thomas E. Dawson and Wilson Gard of Martinsville, and Second Lieutenants Jeremiah Crane and Richard Gard of Casey. Other ranks were Quartermaster Edward W. Ross, eight sergeants, eight corporals, and 69 privates. From 1861 through 1865, 160 additional men were recruited as privates. Of the privates, 25 would re-enlist as veterans in February and March 1864. Dawson mustered out in November 1861, returned as first lieutenant on 9 December 1862, and resigned on 17 January 1865. W. Gard mustered out on 25 March 1862. Fletcher H. Chapman of Carlinville joined as first lieutenant on 18 March 1862. R. Gard resigned on 21 January 1862 and Crane mustered out on 25 March 1862. They were replaced by Second Lieutenants Frank Allaire and Augustus Hoyer. Battery B was part of the 2nd Illinois Light Artillery Regiment which organized at Camp Douglas in Chicago, Camp Butler in Springfield, Peoria, St. Charles, and Cairo, Illinois. There were 12 batteries named A‚ÄìM, excluding J. The different batteries belonging to the regiment formed between 17 August 1861 and 6 June 1862, and enlisted for three years' service. Chapman's artillery company of the 14th Illinois Infantry Regiment was consolidated with Battery B in April 1862. Each battery served independently of the others. The regiment's original commander was Colonel Thomas S. Mather. Captain Madison died of disease at Corinth, Mississippi on 11 April 1863. He was replaced as captain by Chapman on 18 April 1863. Allaire resigned on 17 December 1862. Hoyer was promoted first lieutenant on 9 December 1862 and was discharged on 29 December 1864. Quartermaster Ross was promoted second lieutenant on 9 December 1862 and resigned on 20 June 1864. James M. Pence joined as second lieutenant on 14 December 1862 and was promoted first lieutenant on 29 December 1864. Alfred C. Lovejoy joined as second lieutenant on 20 June 1864. Private Benjamin Bull was killed in action at the Battle of Brices Cross Roads on 10 June 1864 and Private John Craig died at Andersonville Prison on 22 January 1865. Two soldiers were discharged to join the 1st Alabama Cavalry with promotions. History Until April 1862 Battery B was assigned to the Department of the Missouri and was on duty there. On 1‚Äì4 April 1862, the battery moved up the Tennessee River to Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee and fought at the Battle of Shiloh on 6‚Äì7 April. The Shiloh order of battle shows Battery B among the unassigned units of Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Tennessee. 24-pounder gun located on Grant's final line, Shiloh National Military Park. As the Union soldiers were driven back on the first day of Shiloh, Grant ordered his chief of staff Joseph D. Webster to organize a final line of defense covering Pittsburg Landing. A gunner by training, Webster built the defenses around artillery units. The heavy guns of Battery B were still on a river transport, intended for the expected siege of Corinth, but Webster ordered the guns ashore. The battery was armed with at least four 24-pounder cannons, named Old Abe, Dick Yates, Secretary Hatch, and Jesse DuBois, plus one 8-inch howitzer. The big guns were never intended to be used as field artillery, but their large caliber could be expected to have a strong psychological impact. The guns were positioned to command the Dill Branch ravine and the flat area near the Corinth Road. Webster also deployed three more just-arrived artillery units: the 8th Ohio Battery, Battery \\"H\\", 1st Illinois, and Battery \\"I\\", 1st Illinois. As withdrawing artillery batteries appeared, Webster inserted them into his final defense line until there were about 50 guns. James R. Chalmers led the only Confederate brigade to make a serious assault on the final line. Gage's Alabama Battery, Chalmers' supporting artillery, was hit so hard by Union cannon fire that it was forced to retreat. Chalmers' infantry were then stopped by withering artillery fire. Battery B after the Battle of Shiloh Battery B was assigned to Unattached Artillery, Army of the Tennessee in April‚ÄìMay 1862. During this period, the unit participated in the advance to and Siege of Corinth from 29 April to 30 May. Afterward, the battery was assigned to 4th Division, Army of the Tennessee through July 1862. Then it was assigned to 1st Division, District of Jackson, Tennessee until November 1862. The battery performed garrison duty until October 1862. It fought in the Second Battle of Corinth on 3‚Äì4 October. On the second day, after the Confederate assault broke into the town, the Union soldiers counterattacked. Battery B was positioned on the east edge of town and began firing blindly toward a location supposed to be occupied by Confederates. Unfortunately, the Union counterattack pushed their enemies back and became the target of friendly fire from Battery B, which inflicted \\"dozens\\" of casualties. Union General Thomas Alfred Davies was nearly hit by this cannon fire. A map of the battle shows \\"Battery Madison\\" to the southeast of Corinth. Battery B performed garrison duty at Corinth through January 1864, though the organization to which it was assigned changed several times. In November‚ÄìDecember 1862, Battery B was assigned to District of Jackson, XIII Corps. In December 1862‚ÄìJanuary 1863, the unit became part of District of Corinth, XVII Corps. In January‚ÄìMarch 1863, the battery was assigned to District of Corinth, XVI Corps. In March‚ÄìNovember 1863, Battery B was part of Artillery, 2nd Division, XVI Corps. In November 1863‚ÄìJanuary 1864, the unit belonged to the Post of Corinth, XVI Corps. On 25 January 1864, the battery was ordered to march to Memphis, Tennessee and in January‚ÄìApril 1864 it was assigned to Fort Pickering, Post of Memphis. The unit took part in an expedition to Wyatt's, Mississippi on 6‚Äì18 February 1864. The battery belonged to Artillery, 1st Division, XVI Corps in April‚ÄìJune 1864 even though it was still in Fort Pickering's garrison. Battery B was assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the expedition of Samuel D. Sturgis on 1‚Äì13 June 1864. The battery fought at the Battle of Brices Cross Roads (or Tishamingo Creek) on 10 June. Sturgis led 4,800 infantry, 3,300 cavalry, 400 artillerymen, and 22 guns. Sturgis was opposed by Nathan Bedford Forrest who realized he was badly outnumbered, but determined to attack the Union column in an area where the roads were bad and the undergrowth was heavy. Forrest expected his cavalrymen to make short work of the Union infantry who would be worn out by marching in hot weather. By mid-morning, Forrest's lead brigade was skirmishing with Benjamin Grierson's Union cavalry. As more of Forrest's troops arrived, Grierson began calling for help from the infantry. When 3,600 exhausted Union infantry arrived with their three supporting batteries, Forrest launched a heavy attack with his dismounted cavalry and finally defeated them. The Union retreat became a rout when the troops had to cross a bridge over Tishamingo Creek. Sturgis admitted losing 2,612 casualties, 18 guns, and 250 wagons while Forrest reported 493 casualties. Chapman's battery was reported to have four artillery pieces.Presumably, by this time Battery B was rearmed with proper field artillery pieces, though the sources do not say what they were. When it reached the field, Battery B was positioned at the crossroads where it fired shell at the enemy with the fuses cut to three or five seconds. On the orders of Colonel William L. McMillen, one cannon was advanced along the road. This gun, together with two caissons, was captured by the Confederates. The other three guns and the remaining caissons were later abandoned in the swamp, though the horses were saved. Captain J. A. Fitch commanding Battery \\"E\\", 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment (four 12-pounder Napoleons) reported that most of the Union artillery was able to leave the battlefield, but after traveling a few miles, a swampy bottom was encountered where wheeled vehicles could not get through. After failing to get through, at 1:00 am Fitch and the other battery captains abandoned their cannons after spiking them, smashing the wheel spokes, and throwing the ammunition into the swamp. Battery B went into the battle with three officers and 74 enlisted men. Losses were one enlisted man killed, one officer and two enlisted men wounded, and two enlisted men missing. Battery B was assigned to the Post of Memphis, District of West Tennessee from June 1864‚ÄìJuly 1865. Duties were performed at Memphis and in the District of West Tennessee. The soldiers in Battery B were mustered out on 15 July 1865. During its service, 30 men died: three enlisted men were killed or mortally wounded and 27 enlisted men died by disease.

Randall (born 1948) is a British historian who is best known for his works on the history of European evangelicalism and Protestant nonconformity. He is a Research Associate at the Cambridge Centre for Christianity Worldwide at Westminster College in Cambridge, England, and a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. Randall also serves as a Senior Research Fellow at Spurgeon's College in London and the International Baptist Theological Study Centre in Amsterdam.  Biography  Randall was born in Scotland in the royal burgh of Wick, Caithness on 9 January 1948. He studied history and economics at the University of Aberdeen and undertook theological studies at Regent's Park College at the University of Oxford in preparation for Baptist ministry. His subsequent masters work at London School of Theology followed by his doctoral studies at the University of Wales focused on the history of evangelical thought and spirituality. Randall's research on religion in Victorian England and interwar Britain challenged popular assumptions that portrayed evangelical Christianity as parochial and puritanical. He argued that evangelicals were broadminded advocates of denominational cooperation who were deeply concerned about issues of poverty, spirituality and social reform. In 1992 Randall was appointed lecturer in Church History and Spirituality at Spurgeon's College in London and became Deputy Principal of the school in 2003. During his tenure at Spurgeon's he also served as the Director of Baptist and Anabaptist Studies at the International Baptist Theological Seminary in the Czech Republic and divided his scholarly activities between London and Prague. He is recognized for his many contributions to Baptist studies in Britain and his varied works on evangelical history. He is married to Janice and has two daughters, Ailsa and Moragh, and three grandchildren.  Select Works  * A Christian Peace Experiment: The Bruderhof Community in Britain, 1933‚Äì1942.

At 137 metres long, it is the longest outdoor swimming pool in North America.  History  Kitsilano Pool is situated at an area known to the Coast Salish people as Skwa-yoos, at the site of a former shell midden. Kitsilano Pool opened August 15, 1931 by BC Provincial Attorney-General R.L. (Royal Lethington) Maitland and Vancouver Park Board chairman Fred Crone, and originally was billed as \\"America's Largest Swimming Pool\\". The original pool was an elliptical shape, 660 by 200 feet (200 by 60 meters) and 2-8 feet deep, covering 2.3 acres, and containing 1.3 million litres of water. The project cost $50,000 at the time. It was filled by tidal water from English Bay and sealife such as mud sharks and octopuses were occasionally found in the pool. It was designed as a spot for bathers to swim during low tide, and had a sandy bottom until the 1960s, when it was filled with cement. 5,000 people showed up on the opening day to experience the magnificent new oceanside swimming pool. To commemorate Vancouver's 50th birthday in 1936, a 100 foot (30 metre) high diving board was installed at the pool. A group of Hawaiin divers known as the \\"Hawaiian Water Stars\\" and Olympic diver Mickey Riley performed diving as part of a daily entertainment show. Opening plaque for 1978 upgrade In 1978, the pool was replaced with the current design due to health concerns because of a lack of water circulation. The construction started in November 1977 and was scheduled to be completed by July 15, 1978, but due to delays was not completed until September 1978. This was too late for the summer swim season, so the new Kitsilano Pool opening was delayed until 1979. Designed by architect Ronald B. Howard and built at a cost of $2.2 million by Key Construction Ventures, the new pool featured heated water and a pump that pumped saltwater into the pool from English Bay. A seawall walkway around Kits pool was constructed at the same time. In 2018, Kitsilano Pool underwent a major upgrade to reduce the amount of potable water used by the pool by 80%. The upgrade cost $3.3 million, $500,000 of which was paid by the Government of Canada, and the remainder by the City of Vancouver. The pool basin membrane and caulking were replaced, and repairs were done on the gutter and pool deck structure. Wind Swimmer at Kitsilano pool, sculpted by Douglas R. Taylor and installed April 22, 1996  Today  Today, Kitsilano pool is a very popular swimming spot in Vancouver, operated by the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation. The pool normally opens on the Memorial Day long weekend and remains open until mid to late September. It is divided into three sections: a shallow section for children and family swimming, roped-off lanes for lap swimming and exercising, and a deep end for casual swimming, making it a great spot for a variety of people to do their summer swimming.

It was designated on the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places on June 26, 1956. The house was constructed (c.1725) by Thomas Shoemaker and sold to Thomas Livezey, Jr. (1723‚Äì1790) on October 10, 1747, who constructed a mill at the site. The following year, on April 2, Livezey married Martha Knowles. They were devout Quakers and raised a large family of 5 sons and 5 daughters in that tradition at Glen Fern, some of whom inherited the management of the mill. Livezey's descendants occupied Glen Fern for more than 120 years.  Grounds and structures  In 1873, the Livezey House and property was purchased by the City of Philadelphia for Fairmount Park and operations of the mill ceased. In 2020, the house continues to be a private residence, and many ruined structures from the days of the mill are scattered around the grounds. The house consists of \\"three adjoining gable-roof structures in diminishing order, each with a single shed-roof dormer in its roof.\\" Livezey expanded the house in 1764, and constructed several other buildings including a barn in 1768. The Livezey dam crosses the Wissahickon Creek and is visible in a historic ambrotype photograph taken in 1858. The dam is still extant but the stone outhouse was removed, presumably during the late 19th century.  Revolutionary tales  Several stories from the Revolution have been passed down, though of uncertain authenticity. Officers of the British and Continental forces purportedly met on neutral grounds at the Livezey House, and another story claims that eleven Hessian soldiers were killed along the stone wall in front of the house. According to an entry in Elizabeth Drinker's journal, the Livezey mill caught fire on October 24, 1793 and was burned to the ground. Six hundred barrels of flour, and five hundred bushels of wheat, were lost in the fire. Historic ambrotype photograph of Glen Fern taken on June 2, 1858.

Direction for the subsidy falls under the aegis of the Minister of Canadian Heritage. The subsidy programme was initiated while Steven Guilbeault guarded the purse strings. The subsidy was initiated at a value of $95 million. History The CPF was originally known as the Postal Subsidy, which predates the Confederation of Canada. It was originally aimed at magazine publishers, who relied on Canada Post to distribute their product. In June 2017, the CPF subsidy was re-imagined by lobby group News Media Canada (NMC) as the $350 million yearly Canadian Journalism Fund, and sold to then-minister M√©lanie Joly. According to the NMC idea, the CJF would take \\"$175-million of our tax dollars per year to subsidize the first 35 per cent of the salaries of hundreds of journalists who are paid $85,000 or less.\\" In June 2018, Christie Blatchford said of a press subsidy: \\"God forbid Ottawa should start to subsidize newspapers too. As a journalist, the thought gives me the shudders.\\" As early as November 2018 it was promised for the purposes of the 2019 Canadian general election by the Trudeau Liberal Party of Canada, who promised to distribute $595 million over the subsequent five year period. Conrad Black opined before the election that \\"An investment by the public sector in Canadian media can be beneficial, if it is politically even-handed and underwrites quality and originality and not just cronyism and the second- rate,\\" and he was concerned about it propping up \\"corporate ineptitude\\" or one imagines, malfeasance. Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced in his November 2018 economic update that \\"$600 million in tax credits and incentives\\" would be made \\"available to selected media outlets over the next five years\\" under the CPF subsidy. Morneau sought to subsidize the \\"vital role that independent news media play in our democracy and in our communities\\". At the time, Paul Godfrey who was then the CEO of Postmedia endorsed the tax credit, and said that it \\"could be looked upon as a turning point in the plight of newspapers in Canada... I tip my hat to the prime minister and the finance minister. They deserve a lot of credit... Everyone in journalism should be doing a victory lap around their building right now.\\" The March 2019 Budget established the term \\"qualified Canadian journalism organization\\" (QCJO), although it had yet to write into statute law just what a QCJO was. The wage subsidy for journalists was to be retroactive to January 2019. In May 2019, then-Minister of Canadian Heritage Pablo Rodriguez announced that eight organisations would be \\"asked to select a representative to sit on the Independent Panel\\", to act as a gatekeeper and \\"define and promote core journalism standards (and) define professional journalism\\": News Media Canada, the Association de la presse francophone, the Quebec Community Newspaper Association, the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the F√©d√©ration professionnelle des journalistes du Qu√©bec, the Unifor union, and the F√©d√©ration nationale des communications. In July 2019, a report was submitted by the Independent Panel, entitled the Journalism and Written Media Independent Panel of Experts. In order to qualify as a QCJO according to the Independent Panel, \\"60 per cent of the content must be written\\" and \\"50 per cent of a news outlet‚Äôs content must be original news content\\". Should the CRA question the eligibility of a subsidy beneficiary, a \\"Second Panel of journalism experts from post-secondary institutions\\" would consult. In September 2019, the Conservative Party of Canada \\"accused the Liberals of trying to bribe the news media\\". One report said that \\"Qualified Canadian journalism organizations will be able to claim a 25 per cent refundable tax credit on the salaries of eligible workers, subject to a cap of $55,000, for a maximum tax credit of $13,750 per employee,\\" and \\"Canadians who pay for a digital news subscription from a qualified news media outlet will be able to claim a 15 per cent tax credit for a maximum of $75 per year for subscriptions purchased from January 2020 onwards.\\" References Category:Government in Canada Category:Canadian society Category:Government aid programs Category:Social security in Canada Category:2019 in Canadian politics Category:42nd Canadian Parliament Category:2020 in Canadian politics Category:43rd Canadian Parliament Category:Press subsidies ","title":"Canada Periodical Fund"},{"id":"65266225","text":"The 1922 Chicago American Giants baseball team represented the Chicago American Giants in the Negro National League (NNL) during the 1922 baseball season.

Her poems, written in the costumbrista style, are considered important historical records for Colombia's Pacific region, because they narrate the cultural traditions of the region's African-descendent population.  Biography  Lucrecia Panchano was born around 1940, perhaps as early as 1935, in Guapi, Colombia. She was raised by her maternal grandmother and did not have contact with her mother throughout her childhood and adolescence. She completed her primary studies at the Immaculate Conception School in Guapi. At just 13 years old, Pachano was chosen to be a rural teacher and sent to work in the Ember√° indigenous community, where she taught people to read. She continued to teach there for approximately six years. In 1954, she moved to the Valle del Cauca department in search of her biological mother. There, she married and had two children. After returning to Guapi for a year after separating form her husband, in 1960 she was hired to work as a radio operator for Puertos de Colombia, a company in the port city of Buenaventura. Her literary career began in 1965, when she began publishing poems in the newspaper El Puerto. In 1970, she won first prize in a contest focused on customs of Columbia's Pacific region, for which she presented a work on life in the Cholo indigenous community. She continued writing stories and poems for various newspapers and magazines in Cali and Buenaventura, and in 1982 she retired from Puertos de Colombia and moved to Cali, where she continued her literary work. Having never attended college, Panchano considered doing so after her retirement, but she decided against it, noting: \\"I have already graduated from the university of life.\\" In 2004, Panchano published her first book, titled Resonancias de un churo, for which she received honorable mentions from the Cali Municipal Comptroller and the University of Valle. She was invited by the prime minister of Spain at the time, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, to release the book there, where she held an event for members of the African-descendant community at the headquarters of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party. Her 2007 book Ecos de mi litoral was honored with the Helc√≠as Mart√°n G√≥ngora Medal of Merit in Poetry from the Fundaci√≥n Colonia Bonaverence. She also received the Palma de Oro for Merit in Ancestral Heritage from the Fundaci√≥n Ancestros in 2008. Her most recent book, published in 2010, is Hurgando en mis ancestros, a work aimed especially at children with the goal of teaching them Afro-Colombian traditions. Panchano's poetry makes evident her opposition to racism and war. It also deals with the struggles of the Afro-descendent population, the history and culture of the Pacific region, and the author's own feelings and experiences. Pachano continues to live and work in Cali, along with her husband, her four children, and dozens of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She is an active member of the Red Nacional de Mujeres Afrocolombianas-kambir√≠, a national network of Afro-Colombian women.

He is a Professor of Mechanical, Automotive & Materials Engineering at the University of Windsor. He is the founder of the Turbulence & Energy Laboratory. Ting is the author of 7 books including Basics of Engineering Turbulence, Engineering Combustion Essentials, Lecture Notes on Engineering Human Thermal Comfort and Engineering Design and Optimization of Thermofluid Systems. He has co-authored over 140 research papers. His research focuses on Flow Turbulence along with Energy Conservation and Renewable Energy.  Education  In 1985, Ting enrolled in University of Manitoba and completed his Bachelor studies in 1989. He then completed his Masters and Doctoral studies from University of Alberta in 1992 and 1995 respectively. Ting completed his Postdoctoral Fellowship from McGill University in 1997.  Career  Ting joined University of Windsor in 1997 as an Assistant Professor and became a tenured Associate Professor in 2001. In 2005, he was promoted to Professor of Mechanical, Automotive & Materials Engineering. Research Ting‚Äôs research areas encompass Combustion and Turbulence, Heat transfer and Energy production among others. =Combustion and turbulence= His early research focused on the association between combustion and turbulence. In the 1990s, he conducted experiments to investigate the importance of turbulence intensity, eddy size and flame size in premixed flame growth. The effect of each variable was experimentally scrutinized in a controlled environment and a formula was devised to explain the relation between the laminar burning velocity, flame radius and the turbulence intensity. In similar research about turbulent flames and flame area enhancement, his mentors and he used a structural model of turbulence to explain the turbulent flame acceleration. In order to study the turbulence effects on burning velocities, Ting used high speed Schlieren video and pressure trace analyses to study the turbulent flame propagation of propane and methane air mixtures. They found that the small scale turbulence is more effective in enhancing the burning velocity of a growing flame than larger scale turbulence when intensity is kept constant. The experiment also indicated that larger flames have a greater turbulence effect and surface to volume ratio. =Wind turbines and power production= Ting also focused his research work on the application of wind turbines in energy generation. Along with his graduate students and colleague, they used Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System and imputation techniques to determine the wind turbine power production. They substituted missing values with decision tree concept which resulted in a greater accuracy in the data and inferences. Similarly, they employed a fusion of feature extraction, imputation, MLP and ANFIS network for predicting power production. They suggest a new algorithm and methods for reducing missing values h. In 2019, they wrote an article on the impact of wind turbulence on solar energy harvesting and conversion into high quality electricity. By comparing various turbulence inducing devices, they found the heat transfer coefficient to be significantly influenced by the turbulence intensity. =Convection heat transfer= Their research about the power production led to his research in convection heat transfer. They studied the impact of a rectangular strip of measured proportions on a flat plate heat convection. The results of the heat transfer indicate a better heat removal. Similarly, they investigated the impact of free stream turbulence on the rate of forced convective heat transfer. They tested the free stream turbulence using perforated tubes in their experiment. The results showed that the increase in turbulence intensity leads to increase in heat transfer in the case of fixed turbulent length scale.

Biography  Naiara de F√°tima Azevedo was born in the city of Farol, Paran√°, Brazil, on October 30, 1989. She is the daughter of Iraci Azevedo and Amarildo Azevedo. Born in a family of musicians, where her uncles, grandparents, and cousins were musicians, music had a strong influence on her as a child. During her childhood and adolescence she sang in a church choir. Naiara was raised on her family's farm, where she lived until she was 18. After turning 18 she left home to live alone in the city of Umuarama, where she attended the School of Aesthetics and Cosmetology. During her university studies, she worked during the week as a waitress, and sang in bars on weekends. In 2012, she moved to Londrina to further her musical career. She made a living singing at birthday parties, weddings, and nightclubs. In 2013, after publishing her work on the internet, she caught the attention of the music industry, and recorded her first DVD. In interviews she said her idols are the duo Chit√£ozinho & Xoror√≥. Naiara has performed in every Brazilian state as well as some American states such as Massachusetts, New Jersey, Florida, Georgia, and California.  Personal life  Naiara married businessman Rafael Cabral on October 18, 2016. The couple had been dating since 2012.  Career  Naiara's professional career started in 2011, while in Umuarama. After listening to the song \\"Sou Foda\\", by the duo , which she believed casted a negative view of women, Naiara decided to compose a song in response and post a video of her performance on YouTube. Her song, dubbed \\"Coitado\\", which had feminist lyrics, brought Naiara fame. Naiara typically plays at 20 to 27 shows per month, earning her the slogan which she uses to promote her work: ‚ÄúNaiara Azevedo: defending the ladies‚Äù. In 2012, Naiara ended up moving to Londrina, where she recorded her first DVD in 2013. In January 2016, Naiara moved to Goi√¢nia, to record her new album \\"\\", which debuted the hit song \\"'\\", which quickly became one of the most played songs on Brazilian radio, in addition to entering the world's top 100 most viewed videos on YouTube. In April 2017, Naiara announced on social media that she was recording her third DVD and fourth live album, \\"\\". Her debuting performance was held in Rio de Janeiro, on May 9, 2017, featuring special guest appearances from Ivete Sangalo, Gusttavo Lima, Wesley Safad√£o, and Kevinho. In late 2017, Naiara released a new track entitled \\"Pegada Que Desograma\\", quickly reaching the top of the Billboard Hot 100. In 2018, Naiara released the songs \\"Bu√° Bu√°\\", composed by Tierry and Matheus Kennedy, and \\"Chora No Meu Colo\\". In February 2019, Naiara recorded the album \\"Naiara Sunrise\\", directed by the Goi√°s music producer Blener Maycom. The album was recorded on the helipad of the √ìrion Complex, the fourth tallest building in Brazil. In November 2019, Naiara released the single \\"Manda Audio\\", with the participation of the pagodeiro Dilsinho. Both were accused of plagiarism for having \\"stolen\\" the music of the Brasilian band Di Propposto. Naiara posted a video on her Instagram stating, \\"The music is not composed by the pagode band.

It was developed by Howard Carmichael in the early 1990s around the same time as the similar formulation, known as the quantum jump method or Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method, developed by Dalibard, Castin and M√∏lmer. Other contemporaneous works on wave-function-based Monte Carlo approaches to open quantum systems include those of Dum, Zoller and Ritsch, and Hegerfeldt and Wilser.The associated primary sources are, respectively:  * QTT is compatible with the standard formulation of quantum theory, as described by the Schr√∂dinger equation, but it offers a more detailed view. The Schr√∂dinger equation gives the probability of finding a quantum system in each of its possible states should a measurement be made. It is fundamentally statistical. This is useful for predicting average measurements of large ensembles of quantum objects but it does not describe or provide insight into the behaviour of individual particles. QTT fills this gap by offering a way to describe the trajectories of individual quantum particles that obey the probabilities given by the Schr√∂dinger equation. Like the quantum jump method, QTT applies to open quantum systems that interact with their environment. QTT has become particularly popular since the technology has been developed to efficiently control and monitor individual quantum systems as it can predict how individual quantum objects such as particles will behave when they are observed.  Method  In QTT open quantum systems are modelled as scattering processes, with classical external fields corresponding to the inputs and classical stochastic processes corresponding to the outputs (the fields after the measurement process). The mapping from inputs to outputs is provided by a quantum stochastic process that is set up to account for a particular measurement strategy (eg., photon counting, homodyne/heterodyne detection, etc). The calculated system state as a function of time is known as a quantum trajectory, and the desired density matrix as a function of time may be calculated by averaging over many simulated trajectories. Like other Monte Carlo approaches, QTT provides an advantage over direct master-equation approaches by reducing the number of computations required. For a Hilbert space of dimension N, the traditional master equation approach would require calculation of the evolution of N2 atomic density matrix elements, whereas QTT only requires N calculations. This makes it useful for simulating large open quantum systems. The idea of monitoring outputs and building measurement records is fundamental to QTT. This focus on measurement distinguishes it from the quantum jump method which has no direct connection to monitoring output fields. When applied to direct photon detection the two theories produce equivalent results. Where the quantum jump method predicts the quantum jumps of the system as photons are emitted, QTT predicts the \\"clicks\\" of the detector as photons are measured. The only difference is the viewpoint. QTT is also broader in its application than the quantum jump method as it can be applied to many different monitoring strategies including direct photon detection and heterodyne detection. Each different monitoring strategy offers a different picture of the system dynamics.  Applications  There have been two distinct phases of applications for QTT. Like the quantum jump method, QTT was first used for computer simulations of large quantum systems. These applications exploit its ability to significantly reduce the size of computations, which was especially necessary in the 1990s when computing power was very limited.R. Chr√©tien (2014) \\"Laser cooling of atoms: Monte-Carlo wavefunction simulations\\" Masters Thesis. The second phase of application has been catalysed by the development of technologies to precisely control and monitor single quantum systems. In this context QTT is being used to predict and guide single quantum system experiments including those contributing to the development of quantum computers.  Quantum measurement problem  QTT addresses the measurement problem in quantum mechanics by providing a detailed description of what happens during the so-called \\"collapse of the wave function\\". It reconciles the concept of a quantum jump with the smooth evolution described by the Schr√∂dinger equation. The theory suggests that \\"quantum jumps\\" are not instantaneous but happen in a coherently driven system as a smooth transition through a series of superposition states. This prediction was tested experimentally in 2019 by a team at Yale University led by Michel Devoret and Zlatko Minev, in collaboration with Carmichael and others at Yale University and the University of Auckland. In their experiment they used a superconducting artificial atom to observe a quantum jump in detail, confirming that the transition is a continuous process that unfolds over time. They were also able to detect when a quantum jump was about to occur and intervene to reverse it, sending the system back to the state in which it started. This experiment, inspired and guided by QTT, represents a new level of control over quantum systems and has potential applications in correcting errors in quantum computing in the future.

In 1974 he was the largest sheep wool grower in West Australia with over 65,000 merino sheep on three sheep stations and two farms totalling over 500,000 hectares (1,250,000 acres) of pastoral land.  Early life  Born into a immigrant German Lutheran community at Peep Hill to the North East of the Barossa Valley in South Australia, his early life was founded in the traditional German manner. His family moved to Bruce Rock in Western Australia at the start of the Depression in 1929 and while living on a wheat farm his family suffered severe deprivation. Schubert completed his education at the Bruce Rock Primary School, leaving at the early age of 14 to assist his father in running of their farm ‚ÄúRocky View‚Äù five kilometres from the town. In 1932 Schubert accidentally shot himself in the chest with a .22 calibre rifle while shooting birds on his father's farm at Bruce Rock. The bullet narrowly missing his heart. With the commencement of World War 2, and with his German heritage and religious beliefs he was interred at the Marrinup Internment Camp near Pinjarra where he was engaged in planting pine plantation trees and timber cutting to support the War effort. Upon release from the camp Schubert married Dorothy Joan Sloan from a pioneering family in East Rockingham and took up crown land at various locations in the South West of Western Australia, developing significant wheat and sheep farms. They had three sons and one daughter.  Pastoral industry involvement  He and his family moved to sheep station Pardoo in the Pilbara in March 1963 having sold his agricultural interests at Gnowangerup to Sir Eric Smart In 1966 he swapped Pardoo Station with Karl Stein for the cattle stations Louisa & Bohemia Downs in the Kimberley Region along with a cash balance in addition. While on Louisa Downs together with his two sons they pioneered the technique of aerial mustering cattle in the Kimberley using a Cessna 182 aircraft. This improved the efficiency and viability of many remote cattle stations, and is now widely practised using helicopters. In 1969 he sold Louisa and Bohemia Downs to the recently formed Australia Land & Cattle Company and purchased Yallalong Station, a sheep station in the Murchison Region. Schubert subsequently purchased Nookawarra Station, near Cue, and Hamelin Station at Shark Bay, and in 1974 was the largest wool grower in Western Australia, shearing in excess of 50,000 sheep and producing over 1,000 bales of wool. At this time he became active in the Pastoralist & Graziers Association of WA as well as becoming a member of the State Council of the Liberal Party of Australia  Mining involvement  While living on Louisa Downs Station he was shown outcrops of cuprite near Mount Bertram in the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges (formerly King Leopold Ranges) by indigenous Australian stockmen working on the station. Subsequently he developed interests in mining exploration and entered into a number of partnerships with Western Australia mining entrepreneurs including Alan Bond.  Later years  Upon his retirement and the death of his wife, Joan Sloan, Schubert made regular visits to Louisa Downs station where he assisted the indigenous Cox Family and their descendants in the management of the station. During this time he wrote and published 6 books. The first an Autobiography \\"Wiping Out the Tracks,\\" in three Volumes followed by social commentary on indigenous Australia stockmen in 2 books: \\"Kimberley Dreams and Realities\\" and \\"A Century of Freddie Cox\\" His last work was a romantic novel \\"Leila,\\" a fictionalised version of the life of a pastoralist's wife.

Pralsetinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is taken by mouth. The most common adverse reactions include increased aspartate aminotransferase(AST), decreased hemoglobin, decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased creatinine, increased alkaline phosphatase, fatigue, constipation, musculoskeletal pain, decreased calcium, hypertension, decreased sodium, decreased phosphate, and decreased platelets. Pralsetinib was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2020.  Medical uses  Pralsetinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as detected by an FDA approved test.  History  Efficacy was investigated in a multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort clinical trial (ARROW, NCT03037385) with 220 participants aged 26-87 whose tumors had RET alterations. Identification of RET gene alterations was prospectively determined in local laboratories using either next generation sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or other tests. The main efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and response duration determined by a blinded independent review committee using RECIST 1.1. The trial was conducted at sites in the United States, Europe and Asia. Efficacy for RET fusion-positive NSCLC was evaluated in 87 participants previously treated with platinum chemotherapy. The ORR was 57% (95% CI: 46%, 68%); 80% of responding participants had responses lasting 6 months or longer. Efficacy was also evaluated in 27 participants who never received systemic treatment. The ORR for these participants was 70% (95% CI: 50%, 86%); 58% of responding participants had responses lasting 6 months or longer.

He is the Victor and Peggy Brandstrom Pavel Professor of Microbial Oceanography at the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa and the Director of the University Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education. Early life and education Karl was born on May 9, 1950, in Buffalo, New York. His parents were not college-educated but expect him and his siblings to attend college. Both his brother and sister became National Merit Scholars. Karl became interested in oceanography at a young age and was inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's book The Challenge of the Sea. He chose to pursue biology at Buffalo State College after climbing Cadillac Mountain in Maine. Karl paid his way through college working various \\"odd jobs\\" including in pizza parlor, at a cemetery, and unloading freight cars. Following his bachelor of arts degree, he taught high school algebra and general science in Buffalo before applying for graduate school at Florida State University. He earned his master's degree in Biological Oceanography within two years and attended Holger Jannasch‚Äôs summer course on microbial ecology at the Marine Biological Laboratory. In 1974, Karl drove across the country to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who rejected him four times before finally accepting him for his doctoral degree. Career Upon receiving his doctoral degree, Karl accepted an assistant professor of oceanography position at the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa. While there, his doctoral dissertation received the Eckart Dissertation Prize awarded by the University of California at San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography. During his first year at the institution, Karl was a member of the Galapagos Rift Biology Expedition and was among the first to observe and sample deep sea hydrothermal vent communities from a submersible. He was recognized for his research studying marine microecology by President Ronald Reagan who granted him an Presidential Young Investigator Award in the oceanographic and atmospheric fields in 1984. Two years later, prior to his 35th birthday, Karl was honored as \\"Scientist of the Year\\" by the Honolulu Chapter of the Achievement Howards for College Scientist and embarked on various national expeditions. In 1988, Karl co-founded the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program which conducts sustained physical, biogeochemical and microbial measurements and experiments at Station ALOHA, a circle of a 6-mile radius in the Pacific Ocean north of Hawaii. His efforts were recognized by the Bedford Institute of Oceanography with the A.G. Huntsman Award for Excellence in the Marine Sciences in 2001 and by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in 2004 with their inaugural Investigator in Marine Science award. The award included a five-year, $3.85 million grant, which Karl said he'd use to train a few graduate and postgraduate students who \\"have the potential of each training 20 to 30 more students in their careers.\\" In the same year, Karl received the Henry Bryant Bigelow Award in Oceanography and in recognition of his \\"contributions to the field of microbiology and study of the sea's microorganisms.\\" He was also appointed the Chancellor‚Äòs Distinguished Lecturer at Louisiana State University in September 2005 followed in November by the David Packard Medal from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, given in recognition of outstanding achievements and leadership in the field of Marine Science. In April 2006, Karl was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Using data collected from the HOT program, Karl and added the manmade chemical methylphosphonate to samples of seawater, which immediately started making methane. His data helped prove that carbon dioxide emissions were making the ocean more acidic, which earned him the Cozzarelli Prize in 2010. He later led an international research team in the documentation of an increase in the amount of particulate matter exported to the deep sea in the North Pacific Gyre. That summer, he also developed an analytical technique to identify long-hypothesized vitamin B deficient zones in the ocean. His efforts were recognized the following year by the National Academy of Sciences with the Alexander Agassiz Medal for original contributions in the science of oceanography. Karl continued his research in the field of marine microbial ecology with Edward DeLong, using funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and was appointed to the National Academy of Sciences Gulf of Mexico program advisory group. In 2015, Karl was the recipient of the Balzan Prize for \\"his fundamental contributions to the understanding of the role and immense importance of microorganisms in the ocean, and of how microorganisms and phytoplankton control the oceanic carbon, nitrogen and iron cycles, work that has yielded significant insights into global change.\\" He also received the DuPont Award for outstanding accomplishment in microbiology. He later led a research team in collaboration with Chalmers University of Technology to develop a computer model to study the survival of Prochlorococcus, an abundant photosynthetic microbe. In 2019, Karl stepped down as leader of the HOT program, being replaced by oceanographer Angelicque White, but stayed on as co-investigator.

The family is later listed in both the 1803 and 1804 catalogues of nobles on the island. Among the members of the family are the pre- revolutionary figure Nikolaos Galatis(1792-1819) and the Athenian fashion designer .  Early history and origins  The family is first recorded in the region of the Ionian Islands in a reference to a Klinietos Galatis, governor of Lefkada in 1335. It is speculated that the family may have earlier come from Italy, perhaps from Apulia, where a family with the same name has existed for centuries. The first noble privileges are obtained in connection to service for the Tocco family who ruled Cephalonia, Ithaca and Zakynthos. In 1403, Leonardo II Tocco confirmed and recognised noble privileges on the island of Zakynthos belonging to Francilo (or Franculo) Pelegano which had earlier been granted by Leonardo I to his parents, Nikolaos Pelegano and Eudokia (daughter of Nikolaos Galatis). Upon the island of Ithaca itself, Leonardo Tocco (I or II) granted certain rights and privileges together with property to the Galati on the island, and named Kaisar (Caesar) Galatis among the nobles of the state.  Venetian period  After as short occupation by the Ottomans, the Venetians took control of the island in 1503. The island of Ithaca was repopulated in order to promote agriculture on the island, but the Galati were found already to be resettling the island of their own accord, independent of the official re-settlement by the authorities. It is possible that they had left the island at the end of the 15th century when the region was captured by the Ottomans. On returning, they made a claim to the island as belonging to their own property. With them they brought livestock and seeds in order to establish agricultural activity on the island. Over time, the economy of the island evolved, but it is known that the Galati maintained privileges and land interests on the island, since their earlier noble privileges under the Tocco were again recognised by the Venetians. In 1558 the then Provveditor of Cephalonia, Zuan Dolfin confirmed the noble status of the Galatis family under Venetian rule, and this was restated by twenty of his successors: > 'la famiglia Galati al tempo del signor Lunardo De Tochis erano tornati, et > trattati per persone civili et non erano sottoposti a niuna gravezza.' [the > Galatis family returned in the time of the lord Leonardo Tocco, and they > were treated as civili (i.e. the class of citizens) and they were not > subjected to any burdens.]  Post-Venetian period  Some essence of the noble status of the family was maintained for centuries despite the changing economic environment, since the family is found in both the 1803 and 1804 Libri d‚ÄôOro, two late registers of nobility on the island. Plaque in Anogi, Ithaca, commemorating the revolutionary figure Nikolaos Galatis (1792-1819) The Galati were the only holders of noble privileges on the island of Ithaca under the Tocco and later under the Venetians. The family was originally based in the old village of Anogi (or Anoghi), near Mount Neriton, and continued to exist there into the 20th century. A branch was later established at the nearby village of Kioni.  Connections to other families  The Ithacan family Galati are not believed to have any connection to the Chian Galatis family, who came to prominence much later with certain financial interests in European banking and shipping. Despite this, these two distinct families are often confused, with some erroneously attributing the Ithacan Nikolaos Galatis (1792-1819) to the Chian family.

The novel made the New York Times Bestseller List for July 21, 2019. The novel is set primarily during Jules's time in the apartment building and is interspersed with portions set during current day, when Jules has attempted to flee the building for reasons that become apparent as the plot progresses. Synopsis This synopsis is in chronological order as opposed to book order. Having lost both her job and her boyfriend, Jules Larsen answers a job posting for an apartment sitter for an upscale apartment in The Bartholomew after the death of its occupant. It is explained to her that tenants cannot let an apartment sit empty for more than a month's time, so as to deter burglars, and that she will live in the apartment until the family determines what they want to do with the unit. While staying in the building Jules learns that other people, predominantly sitters, have gone missing in The Bartholomew and that the sitter before her was very likely abducted for unknown reasons. She finds evidence to support this and grows even more suspicious after a sitter for another apartment, Ingrid, goes missing. This leads her to believe that the building owners are part of a satanic group called the Golden Chalice and that the missing people were used as sacrifices to lengthen their lifespans. Terrified, Jules flees The Bartholomew, upon which point she is hit by a car and hospitalized. She initially tries to explain what has happened to the hospital staff, only to discover that she is once again in the clutches of the group. One of the members, Nick, explains that the group is not satanic. He further states that while the apartment building was initially built in order to protect its inhabitants from outside diseases and contaminants, it now serves as a black market for the wealthy to obtain organs from unwitting donors, typically sitters or other people with no place to go and no one to turn to. Jules manages to escape from the clinic, which is located in The Bartholomew, and the building as a whole. In the process she stabs Nick and sets fire to his apartment, as he had tried to stop her from leaving. After the fire has been extinguished the police investigate the building and uncover the scheme. As a result many celebrities and former residents of the building are either arrested or commit suicide and the building itself is demolished. Release Lock Every Door was first published in the United States in hardback and ebook format on July 2, 2019 through Dutton Publishing. An audiobook adaptation narrated by Dylan Moore was released on the same day through Penguin Audio. Dutton also released a paperback edition of Lock Every Door on May 5, 2020.  Television series  In July 2019 Paramount Television, Sugar 23, and Anonymous Content announced plans to adapt Lock Every Door into a television series. Brian Buckner will serve as an executive producer and writer for the series while Angela Robinson has been announced as director.  Reception  Lock Every Door received reviews from outlets such as the Wall Street Journal and NY Journal of Books, the former of which stated that Sager \\"relates ominous events and spooky developments with skill, adding an element of social commentary and a surprise twist ending‚Äîelevating this exercise in terror above the ordinary shocker.\\" Oline Cogdill, writing for the Associated Press, drew favorable comparisons between the novel and Ira Levin's Rosemary's Baby, noting that Sager dedicated the book to Levin. The Virginia-Pilot also wrote a favorable review.

It was formerly a sheep station running merino sheep. It is famous for its free flowing artesian bore from the Birdrong Formation in the Carnarvon Artesian Basin, near the homestead, which has created an artificial lake that has become a haven for bird life. The artificial lake created by the free flowing artesian bore in 2012 The homestead is 3 kilometres from the nearby historic Hamelin Pool Telegraph StationMoynihan, J. F.; Telecom Australia (1994). The Hamelin Pool Telegraph Station. Telecom Australia. and Post Office. The lease has approximately 32 kilometres of shoreline on the hypersaline Hamelin Pool Embayment which feature some of the best living stromatolite formations in the world. A view of the Hamelin Homestead in 1975 Early years Parts of the station were taken up in the early 1900s. At that time J. T. Martin, of Roebourne, had unimproved leases in the Hamelin Pool area consisting of 135,000 acres and Messrs Connor, Doherty, and Durack had 94,000 acres adjoining Martin's leases. Both of these lease holdings were sold to the Flintcliff Pastoral Company in July 1907. The Flintcliff Pastoral Company (Mr Frank Cadd), who variously named the leases as Boolagoora or Flint Cliff Station, sold the combined leases to Messrs. Ayliffe and Musk a short time before March 1919. It was reported in March 1919 that the station had been sold to the Hamelin Pastoral Company. At that time the combined lease comprised some 500,000 acres and has not been expanded since. It became known as Hamelin Station. At the time it was reported to be carrying 10,000 sheep, some horses and a number of camels. In the early years the lack of readily available water for stock limited the growth of the station, however the entire station sits on an extensive artesian basin of semi saline water. The lack of readily available surface or shallow ground water necessitated the drilling of deep artesian and sub artesian bores. In 1928 the station was under the management of a Mr Taylor, who had embarked on a program of drilling for water. At this time the first bore at the homestead was estimated to have a daily flow of 3,000,000 gallons per day and had now created the artificial lake, which he had declared a sanctuary because of the abundant bird life. A further eight bores had also been drilled with the last one recently completed yielding water at a depth of 140 feet. The abundance of water and the prospect for more lead to rapid expansion in sheep numbers on the station.

Randhir, Agha and Purnima also star in supporting roles. The film explores the life of common man named Badal Singh, who wants to exact revenge upon the Jagirdar for killing his father brutally but ends up falling for his daughter Ratna. Badal was theatrically released on 21 May 1951 and emerged as a box office success. The film features some of the popular songs such as \\"Unse Pyar Ho Gaya\\" and \\"Do Din Ke Liye\\". Former actress Ameeta is said to have became a huge admirer of Madhubala after watching Badal, and had caught the attention of director-writer Lekhraj Bhakhri when she was enacting her idol's sword fighting scene from the film.  Plot  Badal Singh is a young man whose father was brutally killed for not being able to pay the revenue to the collectors. The king is away, and the kingdom is ruled by a greedy Jagirdar. Badal, in order to exact revenge upon his father's murderers, forms a group of village man who steal from the Jagirdar's palace and distribute the stolen money among the people. An old Jagirdar, has to thus, announce a reward of hundred golden coins for the person who would bring Badal to his feet, but no one is able to catch him. One day, Badal and his group get to learn that the Jagirdar's young daughter Ratna is coming back to the kingdom from her maternal home. Unlike her father, Ratna is a childish and happy girl who loves riding horses. Badal's friend Himmat stops Ratna's palanquin en route, kidnaps her and takes her to Badal's hiding place. Ratna has not yet seen Badal; Badal asks Himmat to pose as him and he himself dons a disguise of Baga Singh. Badal (as Baga) indulges in a fake fight with Himmat (who is acting as Badal) in front of Ratna and saves her. He takes her to the palace singing a song for her. Ratna is impressed by his personality and singing talent, and slowly falls in love with him as Baga Singh. They begin meeting and romancing each other frequently, without the knowledge of the Jagirdar. One day, Ratna goes to Badal/Baga's house (which is actually his friend Myna's living place and he lives as a guest there). Jai Singh, Ratna's fianc√©e follows her to Myna's house. When Ratna is talking with Baga, Jai, hidden behind a pillar, recognises him as Badal. A sword fight takes place between Baga and Jai, in which Badal's true identity is revealed. A heartbroken Ratna leaves his house in disgust. Now how will Badal make Ratna understand his motive? Will they ever reunite? What will happen to his father's revenge?  Cast  According to the film's opening credits: *Madhubala as Ratna *Prem Nath as Badal Singh * Purnima as Myna * Agha as Himmat * Randhir as Jagirdar Mahipal Singh * Krishnakant as Badal's uncle * S. Nazeer as Jai Singh * Bazid Khan (as Bazeed Khan) Reception Badal did well business at the box office. At the end of its theatrical run, the film had grossed 90 lakhs, along with a nett of 50 lakhs. It emerged as the seventh highest-grossing film of 1951 and was a commercial success. When inflated, the film's collection were around 105 crore in 2016. Soundtrack The soundtrack of Badal was composed by Shankar‚ÄìJaikishan. Lyrics were penned by Hasrat Jaipuri and Shailendra. Playback singers included Lata Mangeshkar (for Madhubala) and Mukesh (for Prem Nath). The film's music was one of the reasons of its success.

Their efforts culminated the yes vote in the 1967 Australian referendum (Aboriginals), which changed the Constitution to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in population counts, and allowed Federal Parliament to legislate specifically for this group. 1995: ATSIC report In February 1995, the Recognition, Rights and Reform report by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) stated that constitutional reform was a priority, finding massive support for recognising Indigenous Australians in the Constitution. On 16 October 2007, Prime Minister John Howard promised to hold a referendum on constitutional recognition, and Labor leader Kevin Rudd gave bipartisan support. On 8 November 2010 Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced plans for a referendum on the issue. 2012: Expert panel In 2010, the federal government established an Expert Panel to inquire into changing the federal Constitution so that Australia's Indigenous peoples would be recognised in it. After wide-ranging consultation and receiving thousands of submissions, the panel delivered its report titled Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution to Prime Minister Julia Gillard on 19 January 2012. The report recommends the removal of Constitution sections 25 and 51(xxvi), and the insertion of new sections 51A, 116A and 127A: > Section 51A Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples > :Recognising that the continent and its islands now known as Australia were > first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; > :Acknowledging the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait > Islander peoples with their traditional lands and waters; :Respecting the > continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait > Islander peoples; :Acknowledging the need to secure the advancement of > Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; :the Parliament shall, > subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order > and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to Aboriginal and > Torres Strait Islander peoples. Section 116A Prohibition of racial > discrimination :(1) The Commonwealth, a State or a Territory shall not > discriminate on the grounds of race, colour or ethnic or national origin. > :(2) Subsection (1) does not preclude the making of laws or measures for the > purpose of overcoming disadvantage, ameliorating the effects of past > discrimination, or protecting the cultures, languages or heritage of any > group. Section 127A Recognition of languages :(1) The national language of > the Commonwealth of Australia is English. :(2) The Aboriginal and Torres > Strait Islander languages are the original Australian languages, a part of > our national heritage. The panel recommended that there be a single referendum, in which removal of s 51(xxvi) and insertion of the new s 51A would be proposed together, so that the validity of legislation that depends upon s 51(xxvi), such as the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth), would switch immediately from s 51(xxvi) to s 51A. The panel sought a referendum process that will be nationally unifying and not divisive, with an eventual level of public support similar to that in 1967. To that end, it proposed that the referendum be preceded by \\"a properly resourced public education and awareness program\\" and \\"should only proceed when it is likely to be supported by all major political parties, and a majority of State governments\\". If the federal government were to prefer different changes, the panel advised, it should return to consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. On 12 March 2013, with all-party support, the federal parliament passed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Act 2013, which recognised the Indigenous peoples of Australia and required the establishment of a committee to advise on a suitable date for a referendum on these proposals. The process was to have been completed within two years, with a sunset provision ending the force of the Act on 28 March 2015, but provision was made to make it self-repealing 28 Mar 2018. Reconciliation Australia ran a successful awareness-raising campaign on the need to change the Constitution between 2012 and 2017, when federal funding ceased. 2015: Joint Select Committee A Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples was established in 2013 to consider the recommendations of the Expert Panel report and delivered its report in June 2015. 2015: Referendum Council On 7 December 2015, a Referendum Council, with 16 Indigenous and non-Indigenous members, was established to advise the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten on progress toward a referendum. It built on extensive work by the Expert Panel and the Joint Select Committee. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence. (See here.) It conducted national consultations which continued through the second half of 2016, and published a discussion paper about five key proposals in October 2016. The Recognition Council used a deliberative process which included six months of regional dialogues which resulted in a collective report of what constitutional recognition meant to aboriginal people. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was the culmination of a national Indigenous public consultation process in May 2017 at the First Nations National Constitutional Convention held at Uluru . It proposed constitutional reform on three points: voice, truth, and treaty. It was a deeply considered statement recommending deliberate structural reform, setting out three steps to achieve this, in a way that recognises First Nations sovereignty and overcomes their current powerlessness. The main proposals of the Uluru Statement were: * a national representative body with the power to advise parliament on laws that affect Indigenous peoples (Voice); and * a \\"Makarrata Commission\\" to supervise a process of agreement-making (Treaty) between governments and First Nations and undertake a public truth- telling process (Truth) about Australia's history. The final report released on 30 June 2017 by the Referendum Council was largely supportive of the Uluru Statement. The majority of the council recommended that a referendum be held to change the Constitution to establish an \\"Indigenous voice to parliament\\". The first recommendation of the Final Report of the Referendum Council recommended: > That a referendum be held to provide in the Australian Constitution for a > representative body that gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander First > Nations a Voice to the Commonwealth Parliament. One of the specific > functions of such a body, to be set out in legislation outside the > Constitution, should include the function of monitoring the use of the heads > of power in section 51 (xxvi) and section 122. The body will recognise the > status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first peoples > of Australia. The council commented but did not recommend the establishment of a Makarrata Commission, which was outside its terms of reference. There was little debate in the media after the release of the Referendum Council's report. On 26 October 2017, the Turnbull government released a media statement that largely rejected the major proposals. It said that a Indigenous national representative body would \\"inevitably become seen as a third chamber of Parliament\\" and would not be supported by the majority of Australians. The next step would be a Joint Select Committee to consider the recommendations of the existing bodies of work developed over the previous decade to develop a different set of constitutional amendments which would be acceptable to all. 2018: Joint Select Committee The Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples was appointed in March 2018, co-chaired by Senator Patrick Dodson and Julian Leeser MP and comprising six Lower House and four Upper House representatives. It presented its final report on 29 November 2018. There first two recommendations in the report have a possible bearing on constitutional change: PDF > # In order to achieve a design for The Voice that best suits the needs and > aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the Committee > recommends that the Australian Government initiate a process of co-design > with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. # The Committee > recommends that, following a process of co-design, the Australian Government > consider, in a deliberate and timely manner, legislative, executive and > constitutional options to establish The Voice. 2019: Indigenous voice to government An Indigenous voice to government via a \\"co-design process\\" was set in train by the establishment of the Senior Advisory Group (SAG), announced by Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt in October 2019. The Morrison government has said it would run a referendum during its present term about recognising Indigenous people in the Constitution \\"should a consensus be reached and should it be likely to succeed‚Äù. The National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) website states: \\"The Australian Government is committed to recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in the Constitution\\". In his Closing the Gap speech in February 2020, Prime Minister Morrison reinforced the work of the Referendum Council, rejecting the idea of merely symbolic recognition, supporting a Voice co-designed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, \\"using the language of listening and empowerment\\". The Labor Party has supported a Voice enshrined in the Constitution for a long time. Challenges The question of how exactly to bring about constitutional change remains a topic of debate among Indigenous leaders, foreseeing difficulties in securing widespread support in a referendum. According to Marcia Langton (now co-chair of the Senior Advisory Group), \\"for such a national agreement to be achieved, there must be some mutually pressing reason related to security or economic issues for both parties to abide by the terms\\". The Australian Human Rights Commission supports recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in a preamble to the Constitution. The call for a treaty is related to constitutional recognition of prior ownership of the land, as it reinforces the symbolic recognition of sovereignty of the original owners: a treaty is \\"a contract between two sovereign parties\\". , a number of Indigenous treaties in Australia are under way at state level.

The film explores the rise of social media and the damage it has caused to society, focusing on its exploitation of its users for financial gain through surveillance capitalism and data mining, how its design is meant to nurture an addiction, its use in politics, its effect on mental health (including the mental health of adolescents and rising teen suicide rates), and its role in spreading conspiracy theories such as Pizzagate and aiding groups such as flat-earthers.

The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Clear-eyed and comprehensive, The Social Dilemma presents a sobering analysis of our data- mined present.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on nine critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". ABC News's Mark Kennedy called the film \\"an eye-opening look into the way social media is designed to create addiction and manipulate our behavior, told by some of the very people who supervised the systems at places like Facebook, Google, and Twitter\\" and said it will \\"[make you] immediately want to toss your smartphone into the garbage can ... and then toss the garbage can through the window of a Facebook executive\\". Varietys Dennis Harvey said the film does a good job of explaining how \\"what's at risk clearly isn't just profit, or even poorly socialized children, but the empathetic trust that binds societies, as well as the solidity of democratic institutions [which] we're learning can be all-too-effectively undermined by a steady diet of perspective-warping memes\\". According to IndieWire's David Ehrlich, the film is the \\"single most lucid, succinct, and profoundly terrifying analysis of social media ever created\\". A Financial Times review said the film \\"carefully details the skyrocketing levels of depression among children and teenagers; the flat-earthers and white supremacists; the genocide in Myanmar; the Covid misinformation; [and] the imperiling of objective truth and social disintegration\\". The New York Times said that the film features \\"conscientious defectors from companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram [who] explain that the perniciousness of social networking platforms is a feature, not a bug\\". A review in the Los Angeles Times Kevin Crust stated that \\"while most people are aware that they're being mined for data while on these sites, few realize how deep the probe goes ... if you think the trade-off is merely getting targeted ads for your favorite sneakers, you are in for a big shock\\". Adi Robertson of The Verge called The Social Dilemma an \\"enjoyably lucid explanation of how sites keep users scrolling and clicking,\\" but wrote that the film offered a \\"familiar and simplistic assessment of how the internet has changed our lives.\\" Author and digital media researcher Wendy Hui Kyong Chun argued that the film gives an inaccurate portrayal of how social media algorithms work and exaggerates how much control they have over their users.

A one-time suspect in the \\"Novosibirsk Maniac\\" case (for which former policeman Yevgeny Chuplinsky would later be convicted), he was convicted of his killings and sentenced to life imprisonment. Early life Little is known about Ivanov's life and upbringing. A native of Novosibirsk, born in 1979, he had a small criminal record with arrests for burglary, but was considered a normal, married man who worked as a taxi driver in the local area. Around May 2015, he temporarily moved to Moscow for work purposes, and upon his return, a friend informed him that his wife had been cheating on him with another man. Enraged by his wife's infidelity, Alexei sought to punish those whom he deemed as \\"harlots\\", beginning a killing spree that would last several months and frighten the local population. Murders Ivanov's modus operandi was to pick up certain women from the Moshkovsky and Kalininsky City districts of Novosibirsk, with his victims being prostitutes with drug/alcohol dependancies and inclinations for promiscuous sex. He drove the victims to isolated areas, where he would rape and kill them (first by strangulation, but then he decided to beat them to death with a stick). After the death, he would then mutilate the body, cutting off the genitalia and the hands, before disposing of the corpse in the nearby forest. In one instance, he later returned to the burial site so he could burn the body. His victims were the following: * in May 2015, he picked up a 40-year-old woman, whom he beat and strangled with his trousers' belt. He then drove to the forest in the outskirts of Novosibirsk, where he covered the corpse with tree branches. The woman's disappearance was not reported to police, as she recently had had an argument with her family, who believed that she had moved away. * not long after, he picked up another woman (age reported to be 30‚Äì31), whom he stabbed in the back and then beat to death in his taxi. After the victim stopped showing signs of life, he drove to the forest, where he dumped the corpse and covered it with tree branches. Ivanov would later return to the crime scene, dousing the body with gasoline and lighting it on fire. Two months after the crime, a mushroom picker would discover the grizzly scene, with the unfortunate woman's belongings and mobile phone scattered about the area. * in July, he killed his third victim, a 35-year-old woman whom he viciously beat with using both his arms and legs, even hitting her head on a tree several times. Like with the previous victims, he dumped the body in the forest and covered it with tree branches. Her disappearance was also not reported to police, as her husband, with whom she had quarreled, believed that she had simply moved away to start a new life. * the final victim was 28-year-old saleswoman Galina Litvinenko, who disappeared on October 16th from the Kalininsky City district. On that night, she had been to a night club with a friend, and after leaving the establishment, she called for a taxi, never to be seen again. Ivanov drove her to the forest, near the highway's northern pass, where he brutally beat her to death, dismembering her remains and hiding them with tree branches after. Arrest, trial and imprisonment A few days after Galina's disappearance, Alexei was detained as a suspect. Initially, he admitted to driving her on that night, but claimed that his taxi had broken down along the Pashinsky Crossing. Impatient, Litvinenko then told him she would travel the rest of the way on foot, disappearing into the night. His story wasn't believed by investigators, who asked him to provide a saliva sample. Two weeks after Galina's disappearance, her family and numerous volunteers were searching around Novosibirsk when they stumbled upon dismembered human remains out in the woods. Although they were unrecognizable at first glance, they were later determined to be Litvinenko's, and the clothes examined for any traces left by the offender. Much to the authorities' delight, Ivanov's DNA matched that found on the victim's clothing, and when confronted with the evidence, realising there was no way out, he confessed to the murder. To their shock, however, he named an additional three victims killed over the past several months, showing the burial sites for each during the investigative experiments. Thanks to his confessions, he exonerated another man who was suspected and arrested for one of the killings. When questioned about the reasons for the murders, Ivanov cited his wife's betrayal as his breaking point, for which he developed a hatred towards women and a desire to \\"keep the city's moral purity.\\" Due to the similarities of his killings and the then-unsolved murders of 17 prostitutes in the city, dating back to 1998, Ivanov was briefly considered a prime suspect, but later ruled out. In subsequent psychiatric evaluations, Alexei was diagnosed as suffering from sexual sadism disorder, but was found competent to stand trial. During the proceedings, Ivanov claimed that he had wanted to decapitate one of the victims' heads and send it anonymously to his wife, with a threatening letter saying \\"You're next.\\", and claimed that if he weren't stopped, he would continue on killing. For his crimes, he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in a penal colony.

In the game, players take the role of spirits on an island and win by driving off invading explorers.  History  Reuss designed Spirit Island in response to other board games in which players take the role of colonizers. The invader game pieces were made white deliberately in Spirit Island to highlight that light colors don't always imply 'good'. The game has two expansions, Branch & Claw and Jagged Earth. Both the base game and its expansions were funded via Kickstarter. A digital version of the game, first announced in 2018, was released in 2020.  Gameplay  In Spirit Island, players take the role of spirits on an island. They must drive off explorers, who grow their presence on the island, including founding towns and cities, over the course of a game. The game can be played by 1-4 players. Over the course of the game players unlock more abilities for their spirit and additional power cards, making them stronger and more able to push back the invaders. The invaders actions are controlled by a deck of cards which dictates the areas of the board they explore, build, and \\"ravage\\". Any tiles that the players aren't able to protect against the \\"ravage\\" action results in a blight token being added to it. To win the game, players must use their spirit's powers to clear out the invaders and their towns, while also generating fear, which reduces the criteria to win. The players lose if the explorers add too many blight tokens to the board, if one of the spirits has all its presence removed from the board, or if the invader deck runs out. The game contains an array of spirits - 8 in the base game - for players to choose from. Players can select any combination of spirits, and each has unique abilities and ways of being played.  Reception  Ars Technica included the game in their list of best board games of 2017. In their full review they described the game as complex and deep, describing the array of choices as a \\"wonderfully thinky puzzle\\", though highlighting the potential for analysis paralysis. They praised the progression of the spirits' abilities over the game, and concluded that it was an \\"easy recommendation\\". Kotaku commented positively on the game's complexity and ability to build tension, but found the game was hard to start, requiring patience to fully understand. In their list of best fantasy board games in 2020, CNET named Spirit Island the best complex cooperative game of the year, and PC Gamer list it in their best cooperative board games. In August 2020 the game was ranked 13 on BoardGameGeek's list of highest rated games.

Her parents were Elizabeth (born Mair) and Isaac Stephenson. Her father was a master mariner and he had been married twice before. Both of her parents were Quakers and they sent her to the Quaker run Ackworth School in Wakefield. By the time of her marriage in 1796 her parents had died and she had been living with her brother Isaac. She married Thomas Robson and within four years she was acknowledged as a Quaker minister. During their marriage they had six children, but they also spent some time apart as Elizabeth travelled to preach. She and her brother Isaac, who was a miller, had been accepted as ministers in 1810. In 1811, Thomas and Elizabeth made a new home in Sunderland. A major expedition was to Ireland in 1813 which she completed in the company of her brother. Three years later she set out on a continental tour with William Allen, Charlotte Allen and Elizabeth Fry. They would visit Holland, Germany and Switzerland. Several women were travelling women preachers but Robson is acknowledged as a leading exponent. In her tour of America over nearly four years she visited 1,134 meetings, she travelled over 18,000 miles and she visited 3,592 families. Robson was preaching the orthodox Quaker view as distinct from the Hicksite group who would cause a schism within the Society of Friends. The American Hicksite preacher Sarah Cadwallader visited every Quaker meeting place in America. Death and legacy Robson died in West Derby in 1843 and her husband lived on in Huddersfield until 1852.

From there it went through the hamlet of Le Guidon, to the depot at the lower station of the funicular of the Gravi√®re du Plant gravel pit in Roberval and ended at the wharf of Moru on the Oise.Patrimoine ‚Äì Il √©tait une fois le petit train de Moru ‚Ä¶ In: Notre Pays, N¬∞ 25, p. 10‚Äì11.  History  The light railway was first laid at the end of the 19th century. The locomotives and carriages were confiscated by the army during World War I and used at the front. The Gravi√®re du Plant gravel pit ceased operations around 1918, but the Carri√®re du Carnage quarry and the Villeneuve-sur-Verberie sand pit remained in use. The Soci√©t√© des Sabli√®res de l'Oise, which owned three quarries in the area, had the railway lines re-laid in 1920. The tracks from Fleurines to Pont-Sainte-Maxence were lifted and instead laid between Villeneuve-sur- Verberie and Moru. This enabled more powerful motor locomotives to pull up to 22 carriages weighing 2.5 tonnes each, compared with only 12 carriages for the steam locomotives. Sand production at the Villeneuve sand pit was equivalent to around 420 tonnes per day, which was equivalent to the load of 1¬Ω barges. When the Northern Motorway (A1) was built, the track had to be dismantled in 1964. The locomotives and wagons were sold to a civil engineering company and the amusement park La Mer de Sable in Ermenonville. The sand pit was served by lorries until it was closed in 1982 and was later used as a rubbish pit.Le petit train de sabli√®res ‚Äì La voie ferr√©e de Villeneuve sur Verberie et Roberval √† Moru.

He is known for his role in the unsuccessful British attempt to end the Arab slave trade between Zanzibar and the Gulf. Childhood and education Hamerton was born in Donnycarney, County Dublin, Ireland in 1804, the son of the son of Edward Hamerton, clerk of ships' entries in Dublin, and his wife. He was educated at St Thomas's Church, Dublin, by the curate-assistant, the Rev. John Fea. Army career In 1837 Hamerton attained the rank of captain serving in the 15th Regiment Bombay Native Infantry of the British Indian Army, having arrived in Bombay in 1825 and risen through the ranks. In 1840, he was tasked with visiting the oasis city of Al-Buraimi in Oman to give his advice on strengthening its defences, being the first visitor from Europe to see the city and only the second to traverse the northern parts of Oman. Consul in Zanzibar Hamerton was originally sent from Oman by the Honourable East India Company as their representative to Muscat, but the following year was sent to Zanzibar to supervise the Company's interests. The Company came to an agreement with the British Foreign Office that led to his also being given the role as first British consul, with instructions to spy on the French and report back on the slave trade to both London and the British Government in Bombay. The British Agency, Zanzibar, 1872 Hamerton outstayed most Europeans in Zanzibar, where malaria and cholera were ever-present dangers and venereal disease endemic, eventually spending fifteen years on the island, where, according to Alan Moorehead, \\"to a large extent the social and political life of the island revolved around him\\". Moorehead offers the following portrait of Hamerton: =Arab slave trade= Hamerton was a friend of Said bin Sultan, the last ruler of the Omani Empire, with the sultan giving Hamerton a building abutting the sea in the town centre as a residence, waiving the rent. The British were keen to exploit this friendship to end the slave trade in Zanzibar, which was flourishing at the time. Hamerton had written a dispatch to London in which he described the trade: Lord Palmerston, the foreign secretary, who was deeply opposed to the trade, wrote to Hamerton, saying, \\"The British Government is determined at all events to put this slave trade down, and is conscious it has the means of doing so. He told Hamerton he should inform Said bin Sultan that the trade should end forthwith. Zanzibar was within the purview of the East India Company, and the word of the British foreign secretary in London held less sway compared with that of the British Governor General in India. In the past, the Company had remained circumspect about the African slave trade and refused to do anything about it, much less be told what to do by London, but Palmerston's letter to Hamerton transformed the situation. Hamerton was therefore told when on leave in Bombay in 1843 that the Company wanted him to intervene with Said. This was more easily said than done, as Said responded to the promptings of Hamerton by reminding him that slavery was condoned by Islam: \\"The Koran, the word of God . . . sanctioned it, and the Arabs, of all Mahomedans, the people considered by the Almight as most deserving of favour, had a right to enslave infidels.\\" But Hamerton was a persuasive negotiator and the fruit of his work was a treaty signed by Said in 1845, known as the \\"Hamerton treaty\\" ‚Äì despite most of the work having been done by Lord Aberdeen and the Foreign Office ‚Äì which outlawed the export of slaves from Zanzibar to the Gulf. It soon became apparent, however, that this was mere posturing by the sultan and the Company, the latter doing nothing to enforce the terms of the treaty, and Britain having few warships in the area. So the slave trade continued as before, with Hamerton reckoning that three-quarters of Zanzibar's population were slaves. =Burton and Speke= Both Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke stayed at Hamerton's house before they set off for the Great Lakes of Africa in search of the source of the Nile in 1856, with Hamerton doing much to help them.Moorehead, The White Nile, pp. 16‚Äì17 Hamerton got on famously with Burton, less so with the more tight-lipped Speke. Death Hamerton died at a young age ‚Äì he was only fifty-three ‚Äì from liver disease, although it has been claimed that \\"his disease was more than physical . . . The worst symptom in his case was his unwillingness to quit the place that was slowly killing him.\\" (Burton noted that when they had met the previous year, Hamerton's hair had been \\"prematurely snow-white\\".) Moorehead relates his last days in The White Nile: Seventeen years after Hamerton's death, the body of another explorer, David Livingstone, was taken to the former consul's residence on its passage back to Britain.

Since the late 2000s, he has been considered to be the founder of Zenig (also transliterated Zanig) as a new genre of the contemporary urban music of Sudan. Al-Rubo arguably played a key role for youth mobilisation and resistance against the Islamist regime of Omar Al Bashir as \\"an icon of Khartoum‚Äôs underclass.\\"  Personal life  Al-Rubo's family is reported to be originating from the war- torn Nuba Mountains in the southern part of the country. He is the father of twin daughters.  Career and political influence  In 2012, al-Rubo published a remake of the hit Azibni by Mohammed Wardi (1932-2012), one of Sudan's most eminent singers, who enjoyed great popularity in the Horn of Africa and beyond. This new version featured Wardi's son Abdal Wahab and was produced in collaboration with Media in Cooperation and Transition (MiCT). This Berlin-based non-profit organisation also designed a poster of al-Rubo and Abdal Wahab Wardi, which was disseminated in Sudan and South Sudan in a print edition of the newspaper The Niles. Shortly afterwards, Sudanese music critic Magdi el Gizouli hailed al-Rubo as \\"an ecstatic performer\\" and stressed: > \\"Al-Rubo holds the title of Sudan‚Äôs Keyboard King and Rasta General.

Loorbach won the silver medal at the 1989 Dutch Sprint Championships and obtained the right to compete at the 1989 World Sprint Speed Skating Championships.

Several variants of this problem have been studied.  Packing identical rectangles in a rectangle  In this variant, there are multiple instances of a single rectangle of size (l,w), and a bigger rectangle of size (L,W). The goal is to pack as many small rectangles as possible into the big rectangle. It is allowed to rotate some of the small rectangles by multiples of 90¬∞. This problem has some such as loading of boxes on pallets and, specifically, woodpulp stowage. As an example result: it is possible to pack 147 small rectangles of size (137,95) in a big rectangle of size (1600,1230).  Packing different rectangles in a given rectangle  In this variant, the small rectangles can have varying lengths and widths, and they should be packed in a given large rectangle. The decision problem of whether such a packing exists is NP-hard. This can be proved by a reduction from 3-partition. Given an instance of 3-partition with 3m positive integers: a1, ..., a3m, with a total sum of m T, we construct 3m small rectangles, all with a width of 1, such that the length of rectangle i is ai \\\\+ m. The big rectangle has width m and length T + 3m. Every solution to the 3-partition instance induces a packing of the rectangles into m subsets such that the total length in each subset is exactly T, so they exactly fit into the big rectangle. Conversely, in any packing of the big rectangle, there must be no \\"holes\\", so the rectangles must not be rotated. Therefore, the packing must involve exactly m rows where each row contains rectangles with a total length of exactly T. This corresponds to a solution of the 3-partition instance. When there is an additional restriction that the packing must be exact (with no wasted space), the small rectangles may be rotated only by multiples of 90¬∞. In this case, the problem is in NP. Without this requirement, the small rectangles may be rotated in arbitrary angles. In this more general case, it is not clear if the problem is in NP, since it is much harder to verify a solution.  Packing different rectangles in a minimum-area rectangle  In this variant, the small rectangles can have varying lengths and widths, and their orientation is fixed (they cannot be rotated). The goal is to pack them in an enclosing rectangle of minimum area, with no boundaries on the enclosing rectangle's width or height. This problem has an important application in combining images into a single larger image. A web page that loads a single larger image often renders faster in the browser than the same page loading multiple small images, due to the overhead involved in requesting each image from the web server. The problem is NP-complete in general, but there are fast algorithms for solving small instances.

She was the wife of Ernst Israel Bornstein, a Polish-born Holocaust survivor and author of Die Lange Nacht, a memoir of his experiences during WWII, published in English as The Long Night.  Personal life  Bornstein was born Renee Koenig to Samuel and Frieda in Strasbourg, France, on 10 February 1934. She has an older sister Helen and younger brother, Joe. At age 5 the family was relocated to St Junien in the south-west of France. Bornstein is Jewish and a survivor of the Holocaust. In 1964, she married Dr Ernst Israel Bornstein, a doctor and a dentist, who she met through mutual friends when he was 42 and she was 30. They lived in Munich, Germany and had three children: Noemie, Muriel and Alain. Ernst died in 1978, at the age of 55, due to a heart condition attributed to the years of starvation and forced labour during his teenage years in Nazi labour and concentration camps. Bornstein later moved to Manchester, England with her children.  The Holocaust  In 1942, the Germans invaded France and would search villages looking for Jews to deport to concentration camps and death camps. Bornstein and her family would rush to hide in barns, farms, convents and the cellars of churches to avoid being captured. As the Nazis tightened their grip on occupied France, Bornstein‚Äôs parents decided to send their three children to Switzerland, giving them false names and papers so that they could join non- Jewish children at a holiday camp ostensibly to escape the bombing (although most of the children were actually Jews fleeing the Nazis). Bornstein was given the name Renee Blanche. Bornstein was aged 10 and her siblings Helen and Joe were 13 and 9. They hid in a Catholic convent in France for two weeks. Bornstein recalls the nuns telling her that she will die, hence she should be baptised by them so that she can go to heaven. In 1944, Bornstein‚Äôs group of 32 children, aged 2 to 16, were helped by a Jewish Girl Guide and French Resistance fighter Marianne Cohn, who took them across the border from Annecy in France to Switzerland. The group missed the train in Annecy and transport with a lorry was arranged. On the way, close to Le Pas De L‚ÄôEchelle, a French village near Geneva, the lorry was stopped. Bornstein, her siblings and the other children, together with Cohn were arrested by the Gestapo with barking dogs and guns. The driver, Joseph Fournier, was taken away and beaten up by the Gestapo. The children and Marianne were imprisoned in the Prison du Pax in Annemasse, on the border between France and Switzerland. She was interrogated daily at gunpoint by Gestapo Chief Myer together with her siblings. She also witnessed a young Jewish boy, Leon Sonnstein, aged 11 being beaten. The Mayor of Annemasse Jean Deffaugt provided food for the children and visited almost daily passing messages back and forth for Cohn. After a few days in prison, Marianne Cohn was taken away for slave labour and questioning and returned every evening with a beaten face. She was subjected to torture, hot and cold baths and was eventually raped and murdered by the Gestapo in July 1944.  Liberation  In August 1944, after two weeks of being in prison, the Mayor of Annemasse negotiated freedom for the children with the Gestapo. The children stayed in Bonne-sur-Menoge for around two weeks and were told that the Mayor would be shot if they attempted to run away. Members of the underground movement the Maquis took the children to a Red Cross refugee centre at the Carlton Hotel in Geneva where they remained for three months. In total, Bornstein was separated from her parents for 6 months. Her parents survived WWII by constantly hiding. The family was reunited in late 1944.  Post- Holocaust  In 1964, Bornstein married Dr Ernst Israel Bornstein, a Polish holocaust survivor who practised as a doctor and a dentist and the couple lived in Munich and had three children. In 1978, at the age of 55, Ernst died suddenly of a heart condition. When Ernst died, the family relocated to Manchester, England and continue to live there today. Ernst started writing his memoirs after discovering that many of his patients knew nothing about the Holocaust only a generation after it happened and others thought it had been exaggerated and falsified. In 1967, he published 'Die Lange Nacht' which details his experiences of WWII in Nazi labour camps. Bornstein's daughter Noemie translated Die Lange Nacht into English (The Long Night) and the book was published in 2015. The book includes a prefaced letter by David Cameron and has been endorsed by Lord Finkelstein, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, Jonathan Dimbleby and Dan Snow. A new German edition is published in 2020 with a foreword by Charlotte Knobloch and is being translated into other languages.  Legacy  In May 2019, Bornstein and two other Holocaust survivors were invited back to the town of Annemasse and a ceremony was held in the town centre in their honour, unveiling a plaque with their names.

She has written about her experiences as an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador to the United States. In October 2020 it was shortlisted for the National Book Award for Nonfiction.  Early life and education  Cornejo Villavicencio was born about 1990 in Ecuador. When she was 18 months old, her parents left her behind when they immigrated to the US. When she was four or five, her parents brought her to the United States. She has a brother. The family lived in the New York borough of Queens. She graduated from Harvard in 2011 and believes she is one of the first undocumented immigrants to do so. As of September 2020 she is a PhD candidate in the American studies program at Yale. She was an Emerson Collective fellow.  Career  Cornejo Villavicencio began writing professionally as a teenager. She reviewed jazz albums for a New York monthly magazine. She has written for The Atlantic, Elle, Glamour, n+1, The New Republic, The New York Times, and Vogue. In 2010, when Cornejo Villavicencio was a senior in college and before Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) had been passed, she wrote an essay, I'm an Illegal Immigrant at Harvard, which was published anonymously by the Daily Beast. Literary agents reached out to ask if she'd be interested in writing a memoir, which she says made her angry, as she was at the time 21. She felt most were interested in having her write \\"a rueful tale about a sickly Victorian orphan with tuberculosis who didn't have a social security number.\\" Cornejo Villavicencio's first book, The Undocumented Americans, is part memoir, part essays about undocumented day laborers, whom she calls \\"People who don't inspire hashtags or t-shirts\\". She started writing it the morning after the 2016 presidential election and says she \\"thought the moment called for a radical experiment in genre\\". She has said she wasn't interested in writing about DACA recipients, as the stories of DACA recipients are already well- documented and \\"occupy outsize attention in our politics.\\" Cornejo Villavicencio visited with workers in Cleveland, Flint, New Haven, New York, and Miami, \\"gaining access to vigilantly guarded communities whose stories are largely absent from modern journalism and literature.\\" She in general avoided detailing her subjects' reasons for emigrating because she believes people shouldn't have to provide a reason why they \\"deserve\\" to emigrate. Cornejo Villavicencio built trust slowly within the communities of undocumented immigrants, helped by her own undocumented status and her fluency in Spanish, taking notes by hand instead of relying on a tape recorder. After the book was completed she destroyed her notes. She changed the names and any personal details that could be used to identify the subjects. Shereen Marisol Meraji says the book \\"profiles people who've paid a steep price for the so-called American Dream.\\" Cornejo Villavicencio had originally written the book as her dissertation at Yale; when she presented it, it was failed, she believes because she \\"criticized the legacy of migration studies, where I found a fixation on brown skin, on calloused hands.\\" She places the book in the Latin American literary genre testimonio. In 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, she wrote a piece for the New York Times about the humanitarian crisis on the US-Mexico border.  Reception  Remezcla called The Undocumented Americans a \\"creative non-fiction masterpiece.\\" The Adroit Journal called her writing style \\"very precise and also casual, almost nonchalant.\\" Guernica said \\"Her prose‚Äîcaustic, quick, and simmering with righteous anger‚Äîleads seamlessly from heartbreak to gut-splitting laughter\\". Bookforum said \\"The book is beautiful for Cornejo Villavicencio‚Äôs sensitivity to character, and for her ability to structure a narrative almost entirely through the people she meets.\\" Caitlin Dickerson, writing for the New York Times, called the book \\"captivating and evocative\\". Publishers Weekly called it \\"profoundly intimate\\" and an \\"indandescent account.\\" Kirkus points out that because any identifiable details have been changed, the reader has to trust that Cornejo Villavicencio hasn't embellished, but notes her \\"candor about herself removes worries about the credibility of her stories\\". The Harvard Crimson said that her point is that \\"Undocumented people need not be ‚Äúheroes‚Äù for their stories to be important, valid, and, above all, told.\\" Daisy Mu√±oz, writing for the LatinX Project at New York University, said \\"Cornejo‚Äôs storytelling flawlessly goes from her experiences to those of her interviewees, all the while weaving everyone‚Äôs histories into a compassionate and nuanced narrative of what it means to live an undocumented life\\". ElectricLiterature said it \\"doesn't pander to white expectations\\". The Common called it \\"heavy and gorgeous and astoundingly humane\\". Smithsonian gave it a starred review. It has been shortlisted for the 2020 National Book Award for Nonfiction.  Personal life  Cornejo Villavicencio has written about her mental illness, which she says her doctors attribute to the trauma of her childhood separation. She lives in New Haven, Connecticut with her spouse and their dog. She has been a DACA recipient.

History  The origin of the palace dates back to the manor house of Johann Georg Seifert von Edelsheim, a politician serving the County of Hanau. The main core of the castle, which runs parallel to the Main, roughly corresponds to this manor house. Likewise, Seifert von Edelsheim bought land around the main house, which would end up forming the current palace park. In 1768, some years after the annexation of the County of Hanau to the Electorate of Hesse in 1736, the Seifert family with Edelsheim sold the manor house to the Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel. In the early 1780s, he sold the palace to his brother Frederick. During the first half of the 19th century, various renovation works were carried out, including the construction of new stables and a new reorganization of the park. After the conquest of Hesse-Kassel by the Kingdom of Prussia in the context of the Austro-Prussian War, the palace became the private property of the branch of the House of Hesse descended from the Prince Frederick of Hesse-Cassel. This branch, known as Hesse-Kassel- Rumpenheim, continued to live in the palace until 1902, when, due to the marriage of Prince Frederick Charles to Princess Margaret of Prussia, after the death of her mother Victoria, dowager of Frederick III, German Emperor moved to the castle of Friderichshof.1 It was considered a common property of the sons of Frederick. Frederick's unmarried male children, Princes Frederick William and George Charles, died in 1876 and 1881, inhabited the castle on a regular basis. Drawing depicting the riverfront of the palace, circa 1820 (Royal Collection). Paradoxically, the second half of the 19th century became a time of splendor for the castle as a destination for the European royalty related to the House of Hesse-Kassel, especially in summer. Among others, the following can be highlighted: * Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge (daughter of Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel) and her family, including the then Princess Mary of Teck, future Queen Consort of the United Kingdom. * Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel, queen consort of Denmark, her husband, Christian IX, and their children, including the future George I of Greece and Alexandra, Queen Consort of the United Kingdom. \\\\- \\\\- \\\\- Augusta, Duchess of Cambridge; Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck; Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII and Princess Alexandra of Wales, later Queen Alexandra) (Friedrich Weisbrod, 1865) In 1943, the main part of the structure was bombed, as a consequence of the Second World War. The building continued to be in a state of ruin and abandonment and was acquired in 1965 from the House of Hesse by the town of Offenbach am Mein. Subsequently, it has been gradually restored and today houses luxury apartments.  Architecture  In its original composition before the restoration after the damage suffered in the Second World War, the palace was made up of a main nucleus parallel to the Main river, of three heights finished off by a last floor under cover. This main body was flanked by two towers that had one more floor than the main body. On the fa√ßade opposite the river, the palace had two parallel wings arranged perpendicular to the main fa√ßade, forming a cour d'honneur. The wings had a single floor and a floor below deck and were finished off at their final ends with two two-story pavilions and a floor below deck. The interior was richly decorated with antique furniture. The palace was characteristically painted white and had slate roofs. At present, the structure is, in general lines, preserved.

Oude meesters, 1959, nr. 43 en in 1969 nr. 53. The portraits have been separated since 1886.https://www.kmska.be/nl/collectie/highlights/Stephanus_Geraerdts.html ; Nico Van Hout, in Het Museumboek. Hoogtepunten uit de verzameling, 2003, p. 114. Though many pendant wedding portraits from the Dutch Golden Age have since been split up, this particular pair of portraits receive the most commentary about this fact in the documentation.Catolog numbers 130 & 131, Frans Hals, by Seymour Slive (editor), with contributions by Pieter Biesboer, Martin Bijl, Karin Groen and Ella Hendriks, Michael Hoyle, Frances S. Jowell, Koos Levy-van Halm and Liesbeth Abraham, Bianca M. Du Mortier, Irene van Thiel-Stroman, Prestel-Verlag, Munich & Mercatorfonds, Antwerp, 1989, Context =Frans Hals= The Hals family moved to Haarlem before the fall of Antwerp in 1585. This city welcomed skilled artisans and political refugees with open arms. Partly because of this, Haarlem grew into an economic and artistic center.Leen de Jong, in Museummagazine 9-10, 1993, p. 111. The family of the Flemish textile worker Franchoys Hals and his wife included two important artists. They were Frans (Antwerp, 1582 - Haarlem 1666) and Dirk (Haarlem 1591 - Haarlem 1656). There is much uncertainty about Frans Hals' first steps into the painting world. The second edition of Karel van Mander's Schilderboek from 1618 mentions him as a student of the latter. However, the style of his works leans towards Jacob Jordaens and Peter Paul Rubens, both Antwerpians, like Hals. In 1610, Hals joined the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke, a year later he produced his earliest known work, Jacobus Saffirus. This early work is characterized by a smooth brushwork, a faithful representation of his model and a spontaneous pose. He depicted the head vividly and strongly lit, something that is also reminiscent of Caravaggio. The painter's earliest style is characterized by a lively coloration, which later becomes more sober. He rather depicted his portraits static and frontal, against a dark golden brown or olive green background. Many of his subjects wear black clothing.Nico Van Hout, in Het Museumboek. Hoogtepunten uit de verzameling, 2003, p. 114; Jan Lea Broeckx in Musea van Belgi√´. Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten te Antwerpen. Oude meesters, 1959, nr. 43 en in 1969 nr. 53; Leen de Jong, in Museummagazine 9-10, 1993, p. 111. =Importance= Perhaps the portrait of the alderman is Hals' only painting in Flanders. The Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp also considers it to be Hals' most valuable painting in the Netherlands.Nico Van Hout, in Het Museumboek. Hoogtepunten uit de verzameling, 2003, p. 114. Because of the dark palette, the thin paint application, the broad and virtuoso brushwork, but also because of the psychological transparency, the portrait has a special artistic value. This value is augmented by the fact that the portrait of Stephanus Geraerdts holds a switching function within Hals' oeuvre. It is the starting point of Hals' mature painting style at the end of his career. In addition, the portrait provides insight into the self-image of the seventeenth-century elite.Topstukken, 2005. =Description= Stephanus Geraerdts, depicted seated, stretches out his arm with a smile. His smile is a snapshot that Hals probably painted directly on canvas with a brush. This hypothesis is based on the fact that the painter left no preliminary studies. Arnold Houbraken wrote the following about this in his Groote Schouburgh der Nederlantsche Konstschilders en Schilderessen (1718-1721): > It is said that he had a habit of making his portraits bold and melting, and > afterwards inserting the brush strokes therein, saying: Nu moet er het > kennelyke van den meester noch in If the twin portraits are placed side by side, it is striking that the alderman is smiling at his wife. He wants to accept the rose she offers him.Jan Lea Broeckx in Musea van Belgi√´. Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten te Antwerpen. Oude meesters, 1959, nr. 43 en in 1969 nr. 53. The spectator witnesses a tension created by their smile and action. Since the works have been separated since 1886, the bond that held them together has broken. Hals portrayed his model in a very casual manner. Usually Dutch regents were portrayed much less spontaneously. However, the couple's gestures are conventional. They express the bond of their marriage, which was clearly a love one for them. As was customary, Hals portrayed the husband slightly larger and closer to the viewer than his wife. Geraerdts' outstretched hand testifies to the painter's talent. It has been worked out rougher than the face, and contained in a sleeve that art historians consider to be virtuoso. Hals depicted quite realistically the deep black cloak with gold embroidery of the alderman via fast, straight, almost impressionistic brushstrokes.https://www.kmska.be/nl/collectie/highlights/Stephanus_Geraerdts.html ; Nico Van Hout, in Het Museumboek. Hoogtepunten uit de verzameling, 2003, p. 114. In earlier art historical research, this way of painting was sometimes compared with Manet's painting style, and it is a precursor to Hals's later portraits. The Regentesses is an example thereof. It gives a certain dynamism to the whole. It is very clear from this portrait that Geraerdts is wealthy. In addition to the fact that Hals's portraits were costly, the alderman ostentatiously shows off his expensive clothing. His wife's is even more luxurious. She descended from one of the most wealthy merchant dynasties in Holland. At the time of their marriage, they lived in a beautiful house on the Keizersgracht in Geraerdts' hometown Amsterdam. He died in the latter city on January 27, 1671.

Elizondo competed in the sport of professional boxing from 1977 to 1987, and he fought for the World Boxing Council's world Lightweight title twice, both times challenging unsuccessfully. Elizondo, from Corpus Christi, Texas, is a member of the Corpus Christi Boxing Hall of Fame.https://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/hall-of-fame-fight- night-at-whataburger-field/n-3906762 Professional boxing career Elizondo debuted on Tuesday, April 5, 1977 in the main event of an undercard held at the Lantana Sports Complex in Corpus Christi, against 4 wins, 8 losses Rodolfo Perez. In this fight, Elizondo scored his first knockout win, beating Perez in the first round.https://boxrec.com/en/event/152340 Elizondo began his professional boxing career with a hot streak, winning his first seven fights, six by knockout. This included his first fight outside Corpus Christi, when he met 2 wins, one loss Juan Venegas on August 15, 1978 in Houston, whom Elizondo beat by third-round knockout.https://boxrec.com/en/event/26018 On his eighth contest, Elizondo somewhat surprisingly experienced his first loss as a professional boxer, beaten by a seventh round knockout by the debuting Viterbo Romas as part of a program headlined by future world title challenger Wilford Scypion, also in Houston.https://boxrec.com/en/event/27288 Elizondo responded to that first defeat with a streak of 16 wins in a row, including a ten rounds unanimous decision win over Arturo Leon, 26-16-2 before their contest, on his second bout after the loss to Romas, in a fight held at Corpus Christi's Memorial Coliseum on August 7, 1979,https://boxrec.com/en/event/152348 his first fight as a professional boxer outside Texas when he traveled to Los Angeles, California to meet 31 wins, 16 losses and 1 draw (tie) Don Sennett at the Olympic Auditorium in the main event of a program held on March 13, 1980, in a fight in which Elizondo emerged victorious by first-round knockout,https://boxrec.com/en/event/152350 a second round knockout of Norman Goins in another main event at the Olympic Auditorium on August 7 of the same yearhttps://boxrec.com/en/event/20553 and a ten rounds unanimous decision win against 44-13-1 James Martinez back in Corpus Christi on September 2, 1980.https://boxrec.com/en/event/137072 By this time, Elizondo had become a fan favorite both among California and Texas boxing fans. On December 19, 1980, Elizondo made his Las Vegas, Nevada debut when he fought 13 wins-11 losses and 3 draws trial horse Jesus Salcedo as part of a program headlined by the World Boxing Council's world Bantamweight championship fight between Lupe Pintor and Alberto Davila (which champion Pintor won by 15 rounds majority decision), Elizondo beating Salcedo by third-round knockout.https://boxrec.com/en/event/1987 =Challenge of Alexis Arguello= After three more wins following the victory over Salcedo, Elizondo challenged Nicaragua's Alexis Arguello for Arguello's WBC world Lightweight championship. A very publicized event happened to Arguello as he was training for the fight in Tucson, Arizona days before the contest: He was sent to a local gym by a Tucson native, but the gym was available to local police athletic league athletes only. When the police arrived at the location, they kicked Arguello and his team out of the location. The group left the premises without further incident.https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/16/sports/arguello-wanders-into-ring- history.html A few days after, the contest came off. Fought on November 21, 1981 at the Showboat Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, it was contested at a brisk pace for most of its duration, with Elizondo showing an aggressive style and pinning the champion against the ropes from time to time. In round four, however, Arguello dropped Elizondo to the floor for the first time, with a counter-punch. Elizondo recovered, but Arguello underlined his dominance in round seven when he dropped Elizondo with a right to the chin for the first knockdown in that round and second in the fight. Elizondo got up again but Arguello proceeded to connect with a left to Elizondo's body and a right that graced Elizondo's head, sending him down for the second time in the round and third time in the bout. Elizondo crawled to a sitting position but was counted out by referee Joey Curtis seven seconds after the bell had sounded to finish round seven, giving Arguello a seventh round knockout at the official time of 3 minutes and 7 seconds, Arguello retaining the WBC world Lightweight title.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/11/21/Alexis-Arguello-sent-challenger- Roberto-Elizondo-to-the-canvas/4290375166800/ Years later, Elizondo alleged, on an interview that was published on American boxing writer Christian Giudice's book about Arguello named \\"Beloved Warrior\\", that he had broken one of his teeth on one of the first two falls he suffered during the fight; Elizondo, according to himself, had to await two days to get it fixed at a dental office. The championship defeat at the hands of Arguello was followed by another contest against a world caliber opponent, this time former WBC world Junior Lightweight champion Cornelius Boza-Edwards, an Ugandan who was by now a United States resident. Boza-Edwards had 35 wins and three losses when he and Elizondo fought on June 26, 1982 at the Showboat Hotel in Las Vegas. Boza-Edwards pulled a close but unanimous decision win over the Mexican-American, winning the fight on the three judges' scorecards by scores of 96-94 (twice) and 97-93 in his favor.https://boxrec.com/en/event/2198 Elizondo went on with his career and, after a win against inexperienced Romero Sandoval (who only had 6 previous professional boxing fights before facing Elizondo), the Texan scored what was probably his biggest career victory: faced with former World Boxing Association world Lightweight champion Hilmer Kenty on October 24, 1982 at the Great Gorge Resort in McAfee, New Jersey, Elizondo dominated the former champion, who was 22-1 coming into their contest and whose lone loss had been in his title losing effort to Sean O'Grady one year before, to score a second round knockout.https://boxrec.com/en/event/129515 Kenty later retired with only his fights with O'Grady and Elizondo as losses.https://boxrec.com/en/proboxer/2749 =Challenge of Edwin Rosario= Elizondo had three more wins, one by knockout, over mostly obscure opposition, before he was able to again challenge for the WBC world Lightweight championship. His bout with undefeated Edwin Rosario, 22-0 with 20 knockout wins coming in, received much attention in Puerto Rico and abroad with magazines like Ring En Espa√±ol and others speculating about it since Elizondo had given Rosario's precursor as WBC world champion Alexis Arguello such a good fight. Elizondo-Rosario was Elizondo's second world championship fight and also his first fight held abroad, as it came off at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on March 17, 1984, as the main event of a program that also included fights by future world champions such as Rosario's future rival Juan Nazario, Wilfredo Vazquez and Julian Jackson as well as one bout between Alberto Mercado and Osvaldo Acevedo. Despite fighting gallantly (getting up from two quick knockdowns) Elizondo was dominated by the Puerto Rican; the fight being stopped by American referee Davey Pearl after the third, quick knockdown. Rosario retained the world title by a first round technical knockout.https://boxrec.com/en/event/2470 =Rest of career= Elizondo had six more bouts after his second unsuccessful world title challenge, scoring four wins and two losses in that span. Two notable fights were one with undefeated Frankie Warren, a fellow Corpus Christi resident and member also of the Corpus Christi Boxing Hall of Fame who was on his way to one International Boxing Federation world title challenge and who beat Elizondo by seventh round knockout in the main event of a January 19, 1986 bout at the Memorial Coliseum at Corpus Christi,https://boxrec.com/en/event/31470 and another one, on February 8, 1987, against the future multiple times world champion, legendary, 21-1 Vinny Paz, which took place at the Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island. Despite giving Paz a tough test, Elizondo was stopped with three seconds left in the fight, losing the contest by a tenth round technical knockout.https://boxrec.com/en/event/643 Elizondo's next fight was his last; he took on 24-5-1 prospect John Sinegal as part of a program headlined by future International Boxing Hall of Fame member Daniel Zaragoza at the Memorial Coliseum in Corpus Christi on July 31, 1987. He stopped Sinegal with a second round technical knockout after dropping him three times.https://boxrec.com/en/event/643 Career in review A two time world championship challenger, Elizondo retired with a record of 32 wins and 6 losses in 38 professional boxing fights, with 23 victories and 5 defeats by way of knockout. Both world champions that Elizondo challenged and lost to, Alexis Arguello and Edwin \\"Chapo\\" Rosario, have been inducted as members of the International Boxing Hall of Fame.,http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/modern/arguello.htmlhttp://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/modern/rosario.html References Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:American male boxers Category:American boxers of Mexican descent Category:Lightweight boxers Category:People from Corpus Christi, Texas ","title":"Roberto Elizondo"},{"id":"65267975","text":"Innes Willox AM (born 1963) is an Australian lobbyist and a former journalist, political staffer and diplomat.

It was a major battle of the Nepalese Civil War. The Royal Nepalese Army managed to successfully repulse the attack with minimal losses while the People's Liberation Army suffered heavy casualties. Background The August 2004 Central Committee meeting held in Phuntibang, Rolpa had exposed intra-party confrontation between Prachanda and his second in command Baburam Bhattarai. On 1 February 2005, King Gyanendra dismissed the government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba and announced the formation of a new government under his own leadership. Prachanda wanted to attack the base located within their stronghold to reverse a series of losses suffered at the hands of the state forces and to prove within the party that there was a way forward militarily and approved the attack through the central commiittee. Location The army base in Khara was located on a hilltop in south-west Rukum, a district which was regarded as a part of Maoist heartland. It lied at an aerial distance of about 16 km from the district headquarter, Musikot. It had been attacked earlier on 27 May 2002 and was repulsed by the First Rifle Battalion of Royal Nepalese Army with over 150 insurgents killed. Battle The Central Command of the PLA, under the leadership of Pasang, was given primary responsibility for the attack whereas the Western Command was to act in a supporting capacity. The Bhairavi Dal Battalion headquarters in Musikot had received intelligence of rebel concentration in its AOR in late May and had passed this information along to the Company in Khara. The Company confirmed from local sources at 1530 April 7 that its post would be attacked. An observation post sent from the base made first contact with the rebels at 1800 with mortar fire from both sides resuming thereafter. The base was surrounded by minefields and barbed-wire obstacles which the rebels the assault forces could not overcome. At 0100 April 8, the rebels managed to breach the wire obstacle at the western gate by building trenches, but could not advance any further after short range fire and grenade attacks from the army. The army was supported by machine gun fire and bombs from helicopters at 3 instances between 0030 to 0430 April 8. There was intermittent firing till 1000 when the Maoists retreated recovering their killed and wounded. The Maoists finally withdrew after the reinforcement of Rangers from Mahabir Battalion at 1300. There was lack of coordination among the rebels with reports of rebels of Western Command, under the leadership of Prabhakar still digging trenches while the main assault group had already retreated. Aftermath The People's Liberation Army suffered further losses during their retreat in an encounter at Dalphing with 65 killed. Earlier losses suffered in Ganeshpur, Pandaun, etc compounded with the heavy loss suffered by the rebels in Khara caused the Maoist's to join hands with the political parties. This decision was endorsed by the Chunbang Central Committee Meeting in October 2005 which led to the 12 point agreement in Delhi with the agitating political parties on November 2005.

Ragini was born in a Brahmin family in Kathmandu as the 5th child of Kanta Prasad and Sushila Upadhyaya. There is a 'fusion' of tradition and modernity in her paintings as mythological characters are associated with modernity. The turning point of Ragini's career was the painting exhibition inaugurated by the then Queen Aishwarya Shah on the occasion of the Anniversary of the Birth of the then King Birendra in 1986.She rose to prominence quite immediately after the event. With help and encouragement from her father, Ragini established herself in the field of Fine Arts. Her first solo exhibition dates back to 1979. She has produced more than 65 solo exhibitions and dozens of group exhibitions in more than two dozen countries around the world. Her art has been praised by everyone from Lain Singh Bandel, Bal Krishna Sama, BP Koirala to Abhi Subedi. A retrospective book \\"Ragini Upadhyay - A leading modern Nepali Artist\\" presents marks of the highest esteem from dignitaries such as the Minister of Nepal and the Indian Ambassador. Ragini often draws a snake on her forehead, sometimes with a trident and sometimes with the rising sun, as an artistic statement. With the objective of establishing a modern and well- equipped fine arts museum in Nepal, she became the first woman Chancellor of the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts. Succeeding in establishing the practice of painting based on a single subject, she is known as a prolific painter. She has received numerous national and international awards and honors. She is also the founding chairperson of the Women Artists Group. Her paintings are stored in many places including World Bank Museum, Bradford Museum England, Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, Japan, SAARC Building Kathmandu Nepal, and Tribhuvan International Airport. She is also a member of the working committee of BP Koirala Foundation, Barbara Peace Foundation and is also the chairperson of Shivata Love Foundation. From this organization, she has also started social work through education program for daughters... Overall, Ragini Upadhyaya was born for painting, however, her song 'Rang Ragini' has been released in the album and her articles have been published in many magazines.  Childhood  Her ancestors lived in Chundi, Ramgha, Tanahu, but her grandfather Pandit Devi Prasad Upadhyaya came to Ramnagar in search of better education opportunities for his children. Ramnagar was in Nepal before the Sugauli Treaty was signed; currently, the territory belongs to India. Some members of her extended family are still doing business in Varanasi, India. Although Ragini Upadhyaya was born in Kathmandu, her childhood was mostly spent in Bettiah, Allahabad, India. Former Prime Minister Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala inaugurating Ragini's solo painting exhibition at Lalit Kala, Lucknow, India in 1981 Aishwarya Rajyalakshmi Shah inaugurated an exhibition of Ragini's solo paintings at a profit. Queen Aishwarya Shah Ragini with former Ambassador of Nepal Kedar Bhakta Shrestha at the inauguration of the painting exhibition in Belgium  Education  Her family enrolled her in a Catholic school in Bettiah, India, at an early age for formal education, at a time when traditional Nepali society did not allow girls to receive an education. After completing her primary education, Ragini attended the Crosthwaite Girls College in Allahabad. She then enrolled at the Lucknow College of Arts and Crafts in Lucknow, India, where she completed her bachelor's degree in Fine Arts in 1982. Despite her family's disapproval, Ragini studied printing for three years at Gadhi Art Village in New Delhi. After returning to Nepal in 1986, Ragini attended advanced lessons in printmaking in the Oxford Print Makers Institute in 1987 on a British Council scholarship. In 1989, she received a scholarship to study at the Kunst Academy in Stuttgart, Germany.  Career  The then Chancellor of Royal Nepal Academy, left In 1979, Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala and Bal Krishna Sama came to see her paintings in a non-profit exhibition. This brought some attention to her work and marked her entrance into the progressive circles in Nepal. The inauguration of her exhibition by Queen Aishwarya Shah on the birth anniversary of King Birendra in 1986 led her to receive a scholarship to study in England. After that, Ragini received encouragement and support from her husband to enter the field. The untimely death of her daughter shaped Ragini's artistic journey. The tragic event changed the face of her paintings.  Philanthropy  Ragini Upadhyaya founded an organization called 'Shivata Love Foundation' in 2016 in memory of her late daughter Shivata. The organization, of which she is the chairperson, invests the money collected from the painting exhibitions in the education of needy girls in Nepal.

It was released in 1994 on the album Mellow Gold. The song was recorded in 1992 along with Carl Stephenson, around the same time they had been working on Beck's biggest hit, \\"Loser\\". Stephenson added rattling percussion and a kazoo solo to the song. Background Although the majority of the song is slow and sinister sounding, it becomes more upbeat during the last one and a half minutes, with the use of a kazoo and a sitar, contrasting with the first part of the song which mainly uses a violin. The lyrics features blues imagery, with lines such as \\"sleeping on a hollow log\\" and \\"you know you cannot hide when the devil's your only friend\\". Stereogum writer Tom Breihan described Beck's vocals in the song as being \\"near-atonal\\". Live performances \\"Steal My Body Home\\" is only known to have been played live once, during a concert on the Mellow Gold tour in Japan on September 1, 1994. A bootleg recording of the show was discovered many years after the concert had took place. Reception Ernest May of Consequence of Sound thought that \\"Steal My Body Home\\" was among Beck's best songs, and described it as a poetic song that \\"gets existential with a circulating sitar creating a very ethereal atmosphere.\\" Rolling Stone magazine wrote that the song sounded like a \\"resigned dreamscape\\".

The passion for drawing and pictorial representation accompanied by a strong Catholic cultural influence leads him to the study and realization of his first works of a religious nature. Later he deepens the impressionist painting studying it with the artists who represent it and thus opens up to a new way of interpreting the pictorial medium with the decomposition of forms. Various techniques are used, from the traditional ones, painting with oil colors on canvas to mixed techniques in which he simultaneously uses multiple materials such as oil, acrylics, watercolors, enamels, mixed techniques with the use of chains, ropes, metals, woods and sand, which are applied on different substrates such as canvas, paper, wood, metal, plexiglass, polystyrene, glass and fabric. In the 2000s he moved to Rome where he tackled different creative styles, the subjects treated in the early years range from landscape to portrait, passing through abstraction, material and lyric, up to metaphysical compositions.Archivio bioiconografico, Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna di Roma (GNAM), Antonello Spadafora, italian painter.

The present temple is of uncertain foundation, but claims to be the direct descendant of the original Nara period kokubunji temple which fell into ruins sometime in the Kamakura period. The Nara-period temple ruins were designated a National Historic Site in 1921, and the area under protection was expanded in 2005. Overview The Shoku Nihongi records that in 741 AD, as the country recovered from a major smallpox epidemic, Emperor Sh≈çmu ordered that a state-subsidized monastery and nunnery be established in every province for the promotion of Buddhism and to enhance political unification per the new ritsury≈ç system. These were the . The temples were constructed per a more-or-less standardized template, and were each to be staffed by twenty clerics who would pray for the state's protection. The associated provincial nunneries (kokubunniji) were on a smaller scale, each housing ten nuns to pray for the atonement of sins. This system declined when the capital was moved from Nara to Kyoto in 794 AD. Shimotsuke Kokubun-ji The Shimotsuke Kokubun-ji was located on a fluvial terrace on the left bank of the Omoi River. On the opposing bank was the site of Shimotsuke Provincial Capital and the Shimotsuke Kokubun-niji, and about 7 kilometers to the northeast was the Shimotsuke Yakushi-ji. The surrounding area is also rich in Kofun period remains, including the Azuma Kofun, Biwazuka Kofun and Marishitenzuka Kofun. The original design of the temple was an area 457 meters north-south by 413 meters east-west, surrounded by an earthen wall. Per archaeological excavations conducted from 1982, the layout and extent of the temple was confirmed. The temple follows the standardized template with a large South Gate, Middle Gate, Kond≈ç, Lecture Hall, Cloisters, Rectory and seven-story Pagoda, Ky≈çz≈ç, 'Kuri, and dormitory. The temple was reconstructed three times after its completion around 741 AD. The first time was at the end of the 8th century to early 9th century. The second time was at the end of the 9th century, when the scale of the temple was reduced, and its outer clay wall abandoned in favor of a moat with a wooden palisade. The third time was at the end of the 10th century, when the buildings were repaired rather than completely rebuilt, and the moat was filled in. The temple disappeared from history sometime in 11th to 12th century. Artifacts found during excavations are stored and displayed at the a museum on site.

The temple occupied a trapezoidal layout, with an east-west dimension of 270 meters, and a north-south dimension of 145 meters on its long sides, and 211 meters and 52 meters on its short side. The layout of the temple was almost identical to that of the Shimotsuke Kokubun-ji, but on a correspondingly smaller scale and without a pagoda. An excavation survey was carried out in 1964, and this was the first example of a comprehensive survey of the remains of a provincial nunnery in Japan. This led to its designation as a National Historic Site in 1965. The nunnery fell into ruin in the Heian period and was never rebuilt.

It was commissioned by the local landowner and politician William Owen Stanley and built by J. Edwards Thomas. As well as housing the town's market it has historically been used as a law court, a military barracks, a mechanics' library and a boxing/wrestling venue. Located on the site of the old market cross and accessed from Stanley Street, the town's main throughfare, it was changed and improved in 1906. It is a two- storey building measuring 1,732 square metres and is built of local green shaley rubble with buff sandstone dressings and slate roofing. After 145 years of use the hall temporarily closed its doors, then became a furniture store and, fittingly, a grocery store. The building was listed in 1992, \\"for its importance to Holyhead and as a prominent mid C19 town centre building with a well preserved facade.\\" After it stood empty for 15 years, becoming one of the most \\"dilapidated civic buildings in Wales,\\" the Isle of Anglesey County Council gained control of the building via a compulsary purchase order. The council then restored it with funding from the National Assembly for Wales and the National Lottery Heritage Fund. Opening in September 2019, the building now houses the town's library as well as meeting rooms available to rent by local interest groups and businesses. In 2020 the project won a Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Social Impact Award, with judges from the Institute stating: \\"The revitalising of Holyhead Market Hall has not only conserved a landmark building in Holyhead, but has also provided a much need[ed] social facility with a diverse range of activities.

This road is part of the Kampala Outer Beltway Project. Location The road starts at Kyaliwajjala, along the Kireka‚ÄìNamugongo Road. It proceeds in a northwesterly direction to Downtown Kira. From there it continues northwestwards to Kasangati. At Kasangati, it crosses the Kampala‚ÄìGayaza Road and continues through Nangabo and Kiti, to end at Matugga, on the Kampala‚ÄìGulu Highway, approximately from where it began. Overview The road is a busy transport corridor in northern Kyaddondo County, linking rapidly expanding residential neighborhoods and business centers. Up until August 2020, most of the road was gravel-surfaced in varying stages of disrepair. That month, the Uganda National Roads Authority signed a construction contract with a Chinese contractor to upgrade the road to class II bitumen standard with shoulders, drainage channels, and culverts. Upgrade The construction contract was awarded to Chongqing International Construction Corporation (CICO). Work includes widening the road to single carriageway standard. Five road junctions at Kyaliwajjala, Kira, Kasangati, Kiti and Matugga will be improved and/or equipped with traffic signals. Each side of the road will get a bicycle and pedestrian lane. Automated solar security lights are to be installed along the entire of the road. Funding and timeline The construction contract is budgeted at approximately USh200 billion (approx. US$55 million). Work is expected to start during the fourth quarter of 2020 and last 36 months. Funding is 100 percent provided by the Government of Uganda.

It was founded in December 2019 under the name The Alliance for Austria (, DA√ñ) by three former members of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP√ñ) led by Karl Baron. In February 2020, former FP√ñ leader Heinz-Christian Strache confirmed he would run for the DA√ñ in the 2020 Viennese state election. The party subsequently promoted Strache to federal party chairman and adopted its current name. The party failed to win seats in the election. Background =Ibiza affair= On 17 May 2019, a secretly-recorded video featuring Freedom Party of Austria (FP√ñ) politicians Heinz-Christian Strache and Johann Gudenus was released to the press. In the video, both men appear receptive to proposals by a woman calling herself Alyona Makarova, posing as a niece of Russian businessman Igor Makarov, who suggests providing their party with positive news coverage in return for government contracts. Strache and Gudenus also hint at corrupt practices involving other wealthy donors to the FP√ñ in Europe and elsewhere. After the story broke, then-Vice-Chancellor and FP√ñ chairman Strache came under intense pressure to step down. The next day, he announced his resignation from the government and as party leader. The scandal led to the collapse of the federal government and a snap election in which the FP√ñ suffered substantial losses. Strache was implicated in further corruption in September, and his FP√ñ membership was suspended on 1 October. The same day, he announced his withdrawal from politics. =Foundation of the DA√ñ= Heinz- Christian Strache with the DA√ñ founders at their \\"New Year's Meeting\\" in January 2020. In the Vienna branch of the Freedom Party, where Strache had begun his political career, he still retained some of his popularity. Karl Baron, a strong supporter, was removed as head of the FP√ñ's trade association after he voiced his support for Strache to return to politics. On 12 December 2019, Baron and two other FP√ñ members of the Viennese parliament, Dietrich Kops and Klaus Handler, announced that they were leaving the Vienna FP√ñ and forming their own party named the Alliance for Austria (DA√ñ). They stated their hope that Strache would lead the party in the upcoming Viennese election, and announced his appearance as a speaker at their \\"New Year's Meeting\\" on 23 January. On 13 December, Strache was officially expelled from the FP√ñ. He stated that he would consider his next steps over Christmas, and did not rule out a return to politics. On 15 December, he denied having any interest in chairing DA√ñ, and stated he hoped for a more sustainable project to assist his return. Strache indeed appeared as a speaker at the DA√ñ conference on 23 January. There, he denigrated the FP√ñ, describing its line toward him as \\"ingratiation\\", and claimed it had \\"lost head, heart and soul\\" after his departure. He announced that he would run in the Viennese state election, though he did not directly confirm that he wanted to do so as the lead candidate of DA√ñ, stating he needed to have further discussions before an official announcement was made. David Krutzler of Der Standard described this as a delaying tactic, with which Strache sought to \\"keep interest in his person simmering\\". Another conference was held on 23 February; in the lead-up, Strache announced that he would make his candidacy official there. He stated the party would seek to change its name to \\"List HC\\" or a similar title; \\"HC\\" is an abbreviation of \\"Heinz-Christian\\" and a common nickname for Strache in Austria. At an extraordinary party congress on 14 May, the DA√ñ renamed itself to Team HC Strache ‚Äì Alliance for Austria, and adopted the abbreviation \\"HC\\" or \\"Team HC\\". Strache was also chosen as party chairman, with Baron becoming deputy. In July, a fourth FP√ñ deputy in the Viennese parliament, G√ºnter Kasal, defected to Team HC. =2020 Viennese state election= Team HC presented its list for the election in August. As expected, Strache was the lead candidate. The character of a number of candidates came under scrutiny, with one candidate recorded as having chanted anti-Semitic slogans, such as \\"Soros must go!\\" and \\"Rothschild must go!\\". Another had attended a protest against the Austrian COVID-19 response, at which he had insulted federal Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and questioned whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus actually existed. A third was a professional physician who had expressed anti-vaccination beliefs. Preliminary results of the election indicate that Team HC won 3.3% of votes cast, below the 5% electoral threshold to enter the legislature. Despite this, Strache insisted he would continue with the party and expand beyond Vienna, naming the local elections in Upper Austria as his next goal.

Life  Born in Dresden, Seconda was the younger brother of Franz Seconda, both parents were the delicatessen trader Francesco Maria Seconda (1725-1773), who came from Italy, and his wife Sophia Dorothea, n√©e Krampe (1729-1809). Little is known about the early years of Secona. At the age of 24 he appeared for the first time and possibly briefly at the Hamburg theatre (until summer 1785, under ) and possibly in autumn with Catharina Opitz at the . in 1786, he took over a part of the Dresden court play from Pasquale Bondini, which he directed as a headmaster until 1817. This theatre company (mainly opera company, so- called Deutsche Operngesellschaft, also Deutsche Schauspieler-Ge September sellschaft Stadtarchiv der Landeshauptstadt Dresden, Kirchliche Wochenzettel 1685/1703-1902, here 2 July 1795 to 1 January 1796, .) played mainly alternately in Leipzig (1788-1796, 1800-1806, 1810-1817) and Dresden (1787, 1790-1807, 1809-1816). From 1788, he worked closely with his brother Franz Seconda, who, after Bondini, took over the Dresden court theatre. Both continued the privilege of Bondini, who was allowed to play in Leipzig during the War of the Bavarian Succession as a compensation for the performances in Dresden. During the performances in Leipzig from 1807 to 1809, which were cancelled due to the war, there was a new cooperation with the Bautzen theatre, e.g. under Friedrich Nitzschke. The company's repertoire consisted almost exclusively of operas, for example works by Luigi Cherubini, Ferdinando Pa√´r and Mozart, such as Don Giovanni, Le nozze di Figaro and The Abduction from the Seraglio, but also The interrupted sacrificial feast and Weber's Silvana as well as The Uncle from Amsterdam after Cimarosa.

In the conflict between German and Italian opera, no musician of the Staatskapelle Dresden or the Semperoper under Francesco Morlacchi was allowed to perform with Seconda. These restrictions had the effect that the German opera did not achieve its breakthrough in Dresden until Carl Maria von Weber from 1817.Max Maria von Weber: Carl Maria von Weber. A picture of life. Vol. 2, Ernst Keil, Leipzig 1866, p. 16, online, retrieved September 2020. In February 1813, E. T. A. Hoffmann was offered the position of music director of Seconda's troupe commuting between Leipzig and Dresden. Hoffmann had already applied for this position in 1810 when the society was reorganised. In mid-March 1813, Seconda confirmed the contract with Hoffmann, who then travelled to Dresden. At that time, however, the city was occupied by French troops and was at the centre of the War of the Bavarian Succession against Napoleon. Seconda therefore stayed in Leipzig and called Hoffmann to his home. When an armistice was declared until mid-August 1813, Seconda was finally granted a playing permit for Dresden. However, the usual venue, the Theater am Lincke'schen Bad, was located outside the entrenchments around Dresden and was reserved for performances of the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais under French occupation. Through the mediation of his brother Franz, Joseph was therefore granted permission to play at the Dresden court theatre. There, the opera company alternated between Italians and French workss. In the winter of 1813/14, he again organised opera performances in Leipzig. When there were increasing differences with Hoffmann, Seconda already dismissed him in February 1814. In his dramatic fragment of \\"Blandina\\", Hoffmann is said to have created a portrait of Seconda.Corinna Kirschstein: Seconda, Joseph (Josef).

Powers  The Malta Business Registry is responsible for the registration of new companies and commercial partnerships, the registration of documents related to commercial partnerships, the issuing of certified documentation including certificates of good-standing, the reservation of company names, the collection of registration and other fees, the publication of notices and the imposition and collection of penalties. The Registry is also charged with conducting investigations of companies and maintaining Malta's company and partnership register.  History  Malta Business Registry's (MBR) functions were previously held by the Registry of Companies as part of the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA).Company law was introduced in Malta by the Commercial Partnerships Ordinance of 1962. The Register originally came under the Commerce Department, a Government department. It became a part of the Malta Financial Services Authority in 1997 following the introduction of the new Companies Act in 1995. The Registry of Companies became a stand-alone agency and was renamed the Malta Business Registry in 2018. Its new offices were inaugurated in Zejtun by then Prime Minister Joseph Muscat in June 2019. It was claimed that the MBR would be the first government agency to run on blockchain technology to increase transparency and reduce bureaucratic procedures. The agency had approximately 96,000 companies on its books in 2020 It reported an operational surplus of circa ‚Ç¨10 million for financial year 2019.  Controversy  In 2019 Malta's anti-money laundering regime was found to be inadequate by an expert review (Council of Europe Moneyval). The OECD expressed similar concerns regarding the lack of \\"relevant information on commercial entities, particularly in light of the fact that the annual filings rates of companies...(were) very low.\\" Subsequently, Malta issued new legislation which required greater accuracy regarding the ownership and financial dealings of listed companies. Random sampling checks were initiated in 2020 to assess if Maltese companies had filed the required yearly annual returns. As a result, 10,000 non-compliant entities were then struck-off from the registry. When this was announced there were concerns that these company's records would no longer be accessible for review. It remains unclear what proportion of Maltese companies still fail the registry's requirement for transparency. It had previously been disputed that financial penalties for non-compliance regarding Maltese company regulation were an effective enforcement tool.

Delysia confides that she is torn between Phil, who is in a position to back her for the lead role in a new show; Nick, who part-owns the nightclub in which she is a singer; and also Michael, a self-made and newly-wealthy man who wants to marry her. The doorbell rings, announcing Edythe Dubarry, a beauty salon owner. She is desperate for advice, her fianc√© Tony having just left her. Immensely impressed with the way in which Miss Pettigrew had dealt with Phil and Nick, Delysia tells her friend that Miss Pettigrew will no doubt also be able to talk Tony round. They dress for a late afternoon party, Delysia lending Miss Pettigrew a gown while Edythe gives her a makeover. At the party, Miss Pettigrew has a little too much to drink, and later frets she was rather rude to Tony, but almost by accident convinces him to reconcile with Edythe. Delysia and Miss Pettigrew have just returned to the flat when Michael unexpectedly arrives, furious. Delysia explains why: having agreed to marry him, she had been distracted by Nick on the morning of her wedding, and had simply not turned up. Michael had got drunk, had hit a policeman, and had been sent to prison for thirty days. In spite of his evident temper, Miss Pettigrew is impressed. They take a taxi to Nick's nightclub, where Delysia will be singing. Miss Pettigrew strikes up a rapport with Joe Blomfield, a wealthy middle-aged batchelor who has made his fortune designing women's corsets. Delysia is sitting with Michael when Nick demands a dance. Michael bridles, and the two men square off. Seeing that Delysia is unable to resist Nick, Miss Pettigrew hisses to Michael \\"Sock him one\\". Michael does so, and Nick backs off. Quickly leaving the nightclub, Michael and Delysia hail a cab, while Joe and Miss Pettigrew hail another. Miss Pettigrew confesses that in spite of appearances she is in reality a penniless governess; Joe says that makes no difference to his growing feelings. The couple drive around for 45 minutes to allow the others some time at the flat alone. By the time Miss Pettigrew arrives, Delysia and Michael have decided to marry. Planning to buy a large house, they ask if Miss Pettigrew will live with them as their housekeeper. Overjoyed, she agrees, and is even happier when she hears that Joe will be calling for her in the morning. She comments \\"I have a beau at last.\\"  Principal characters  * Guinevere Pettigrew, governess * Delysia LaFosse (born Ethyl Blogg), nightclub singer and socialite * Edythe Dubarry, beauty salon owner, friend of Delysia * Phil, lover of Delysia * Nick Calderelli, lover of Delysia, nightclub owner * Michael, lover of Delysia, wealthy self- made man * Joe Blomfield, middle-aged wealthy batchelor Background and reception Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day was Watson's third novel. The initial draft was initially rejected by Methuen as it was very different from her earlier historical and romantic books. Watson was confident in the work, though, and struck a deal with the publisher to write another similar country drama (Upyonder) if they would publish Miss Pettigrew. The positive reception the novel received on publication in 1938 proved her right: the book was published in the US, it was translated into French, and she even agreed to a German translation before that had to be called off by the war. In 2001 the novel was re-published by Persephone Books with a preface by Henrietta Twycross-Martin. Adaptations * In 2001 a five-part abridgement by Elizabeth Bradbury was read on BBC Radio 4 by Maureen Lipman. * Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day is a 2008 film adaptation directed by Bharat Nalluri, with Frances McDormand in the title role and Amy Adams as Delysia Lafosse.

The last chapters of the canonical gospels of gospel of Matthew,gospel of Mark,gospel of Luke and Gospel of John receive this classification. Among the apocryphal gospels are: * Gospel of Peter * Gospel of Nicodemus (also called the \\"Acts of Pilate\\") * Pseudo-Cyril of Jerusalem, On the Life and the Passion of Christ * Gospel of Bartholomew * Questions of Bartholomew * Resurrection of Jesus Christ (which claims to be Gospel of Bartholomew) *Pontius Pilate's sentence against Jesus *Pontius Pilate's account to Emperor Claudius *Correspondences between Pilate and Herod *Declaration by Joseph of Arimathea Gospel of Peter The Gospel of Peter (, kata Petron euangelion), or Gospel according to Peter, is an ancient text concerning Jesus Christ, only partially known today. It is considered a non-canonical gospel and was rejected as apocryphal by the Catholic Church's synods of Carthage and Rome, which established the New Testament canon.Thomas Patrick Halton, On Illustrious Men, v. 100, CUA Press, 1999. pp 5‚Äì7 It was the first of the non-canonical gospels to be rediscovered, preserved in the dry sands of Egypt. A major focus of the surviving fragment of the Gospel of Peter is the passion narrative, which ascribes responsibility for the crucifixion of Jesus to Herod Antipas rather than to Pontius Pilate. Gospel of Nicodemos The Gospel of Nicodemus, also known as the Acts of Pilate (; ), is a New Testament apocrypha gospel claimed to have been derived from an original Hebrew work written by Nicodemus, who appears in the Gospel of John as an associate of Jesus. The title \\"Gospel of Nicodemus\\" is medieval in origin. The dates of its accreted sections are uncertain, but according to the 1907 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia scholars agree in assigning the resulting work to the middle of the fourth century AD. The section about Pilate is an older text found in the Greek Acts of Peter and Paul and, according to the surviving version\\"The Apocryphal New Testament\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20150705090754/http://folk.uio.no/lukeb/books/apocrypha/Gospel_of_Nicodemus.pdf, is an official document from Pontius Pilate (or composed from reports at the praetorium at Jerusalem) reporting events in Judea to Emperor Tiberius, and referring to the crucifixion of Jesus, as well as his miracles. Acts of Pilate The Acts of Pilate (in Latin: Acta Pilati; in Greek: Œ†œÅŒ¨ŒæŒµŒπœÇ Œ†ŒπŒªŒ¨œÑŒøœÖ), also called Pilate's Gospel, is one of the New Testament apocrypha. The dates of each of the added sections is uncertain, but scholars attribute the final result to the middle of the fourth century AD.The text was also found in the Greek Acts of Peter and Paul and as an appendix to the medieval Latin text Gospel of Nicodemus, which is believed to have been written by a member of the Order of Nicodemus, although there is no relationship between these independent texts. Pseudo-Cyril of Jerusalem,on the Life and the Passion of Christ Pseudo-Cyril of Jerusalem,On the Life and the Passion of Christ or CPC 0113 is an apocryphal account of Jesus written in Sahidic. According to its written introduction, it is \\"a homily which the holy Apa Cyril [...] delivered\\", meaning Cyril of Jerusalem. Scholars, however, assume the homily to be a Pseudo-Cyrillian work. It is dated no earlier than the 8th century AD and, according to the introduction, was delivered \\"in the early morning of the fourth day of the Great Pascha\\", making it an Easter homily focusing mostly on the passion of Christ.Van den Broek, Roelof. Pseudo-Cyril of Jerusalem On the Life and the Passion of Christ : A Coptic Apocryphon, Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae. Leiden: Koninklijke Brill NV, 2013, p. 69 Gospel of Bartholomew The Gospel of Bartholomew is a missing text amongst the New Testament apocrypha, mentioned in several early sources. It may be identical to either the Questions of Bartholomew, the Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew), or neither. In the prologue to his commentary on Matthew, Jerome mentions a \\"Gospel of Bartholomew\\" among several other apocryphal gospels. The author of the Decretum Gelasianum includes \\"the Gospels in the name of Bartholomew\\" in a list of condemned or unacceptable scriptures.\\"Decretum Gelasianum\\"; see http://www.tertullian.org/articles/burkitt_gelasianum.htm =Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew)= The Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew) is not to be confused with the book called Questions of Bartholomew, although either text may be the missing Gospel of Bartholomew (or neither may be), a lost work from the New Testament apocrypha. =Questions of Bartholomew= The Questions of Bartholomew is not to be confused with the book called Resurrection of Jesus Christ, although either text may be the missing Gospel of Bartholomew (or neither may be), a lost work from the New Testament apocrypha. Declaration by Joseph of Arimathea The Declaration by Joseph of Arimathea involves myths about the life of Joseph of Arimathea. The text is falsely attributed to the biblical character and was written in the 2nd century AD. It is related to the latest events in the life of Jesus. Sanhedrin: The supreme council and court of the Jews during postexilic times (between the end of the exile in Babylon in 538 BC and AD 1).They were usually headed by a High Priest. It officiated over religious, civil, and criminal matters. The alleged prison of Joseph of Arimathea was also explored in the apocryphal The Dialogue of the Savior, contrary to the biblical chronology in Acts of the Apostles in which Stephen was the first martyr of the persecution practiced by Jews to the early Christians, without any quote regarding any reprisals on the part of the Sanhedrin to Joseph of Arimathea or Nicodemus. (Acts of the Apostles chapters 6 to 15). Joseph of Arimathea by Hampton Rod, Fox Seth. Pontius Pilate's account to Emperor Claudius The Pontius Pilate's account to Emperor Claudius is ranked among New Testament apocrypha. He is a description anti-Semitic of crucifixion, as well as an account of resurrection of Jesus Christ. The text claims to be a written account made by Pilate to Roman emperor Claudius and was later annexed in the book of Acts of Pilate.Account to Pilate (in English).

The summit is above sea level. Totley Tunnel runs for under Totley Moor and Longshaw Estate, between Totley and Grindleford stations. It was built between 1888 and 1893 by Midland Railway for the route between Sheffield and Manchester through the Hope Valley. A large air ventilation shaft rises from a natural cavern, which the tunnel passes through, up to the surface on Totley Moor.Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain, Vol VIII, South & West Yorkshire: David Joy: 2nd ed; David & Charles; Newton Abbot; 1984 pp. 170‚Äì171 The tunnel remains in use today for frequent trans-pennine passenger trains. Bar Brook stream drains the marshy Totley Moss area, running south to feed the disused Bar Brook Reservoir. It then continues to flow south and into the River Derwent by Chatsworth Park. On the north-eastern side of Totley Moor, Blacka Moor Nature Reserve is managed by Sheffield & Rotherham Wildlife Trust. The reserve covers 181 hectares and is part of the Eastern Peak District Moors SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). The open moor is a landscape of purple moor- grass, heathers and bilberry. It provides a moorland habitat for willow warblers, black caps, cuckoos, wheatears, stonechats and whinchats. Red deer are also a common sight. There are three Bronze Age cairnfields along Brown Edge ridge which are protected Scheduled Monuments. An excavation in 1963 of the site of a 7m wide ring cairn discovered cremation remains, urns, a pygmy cup and a hearth. The artefacts are on display in Weston Park Museum, Sheffield. In 1960, following fires on the moor, a Bronze Age shale-working floor was discovered at Flask Edge with shale fragments of bracelets and rings. Following the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, this gritstone upland moor became \\"Open Access\\" land for the public. The Sheffield Country Walk bridlepath runs across the moor between Totley and the A6187 road. The Peak District Boundary Walk crosses the eastern side of Totley Moor, running through Blacka Moor Nature Reserve and above Brown Edge, just below the summit.

Early years (1857‚Äì1881) Louis-Gustave Amelot was born in Brussels on 25 August 1857. He became a mechanical engineer. He entered the service of the International African Association as a mechanic, and left for Africa on 1 September 1881. Lower Congo (1881‚Äì1883) Amelot stayed in the lower Congo region for about a year, mostly in Vivi, a station commanded by Otto Lindner (1852‚Äì1945). In July 1882 the overall commander Henry Morton Stanley, who was sick, came down to Vivi. He assigned Amelot to leave for the interior with Camille Coquilhat, Henri Avaert and √âmile Parfonry. They left on 30 September 1882 and reached Manyanga on 17 October 1882. Amelot had to return. He was suffering from ulcers on his legs, and went down to Banana to recuperate, where he met Camille Coquilhat. Stanley Pool (1883‚Äì1884) In March 1883 there were rumors of a revolt, and Amelot accompanied Th√©odore Nilis and Joseph Vandevelde to come to the aid of Parfonry, who was head of the Isangila station. With the arrival of reinforcements the problem was resolved, and Amelot continued on to Manyanga. In May Stanley named him as interim commander of the Lutete post, which Alphonse van G√®le had just founded. In June he was appointed commander of Kimpoko station. At Kimpoko Amelot got into an argument with a chief and six of his headmen over the rotting carcass of a hippopotamus, which resulted in their being killed. Soon there were rumors that the post was in danger, and Stanley ordered the complete evacuation of its staff and equipment to L√©opoldville. The newly-arrived Swedish officer Georges-Guillaume Pagels was tasked with helping the garrison leave. Upper Congo (1884) Some time before February 1884 Amelot requested permission to leave the Congo before the end of his term. However, on 25 March 1884 Amelot left L√©opoldville in Captain Edmond Hanssens' expedition to the Upper Congo. Amelot owned an accordion, which he played well, and entertained the members of the expedition. On 17 April 1884 they arrived in √âquateurville. Two days later Hanssens and Van G√®le set out in the En Avant to explore the Ubangi River with the pharmacist Courtois, de Gu√©rin and the mechanic Amelot, a crew of ten Zanzibaris and a local African who was to act as their interpreter. Going downstream the steamer skirted the right bank of the Congo River, but was carried by the current into a maze of islands. After three days they saw some native fishermen in a canoe. Van G√®le managed to persuade them to act as pilots, and after four hours of full steam on 21 April 1884 entered a strong stream of yellow water, the Ubangi, which they ascended to the Bisongo village. They received a friendly reception, and Hanssens exchanged blood with Chief Mkoko. The chief agreed to place both banks of the Ubangi under the protection of the International African Association. Amelot continued with the expedition and participated in the establishment of the Bangala station and the explorations of the Mongala, Itimbiri and Aruwimi rivers. A comic melange of tunes he had composed for his accordion called the Hymne de l'√âquateur helped break the ice with the local people they encountered. The expedition arrived at the Stanley Falls on 3 July 1884. Hanssens relieved Adrian Binnie, who had commanded there since Henry Morton Stanley's visit in December 1883, and would return to the coast. He replaced him by Arvid Wester, with Amelot as deputy. On 11 July 1884 Hanssens left the Falls. Amelot's signature as a witness is on an agreement (in English) of 18 October 1884 between Tipu Tip's son Moniamani and Lieutenant Wester in which Moniamani promised that no Arab would come to the river below the 7th Cataract of Stanley, or to the west of that point. In November 1884 Van G√®le arrived at the Falls. Amelot's term of service had expired, and he asked for permission to return to Europe by way of Nyangwe and the east coast of Africa. He left the Falls at the end of November, and died of hematuria at Mzendu, near Nyangwe, on 1 December 1884.

The character is voiced by Kirby Howell-Baptiste,https://medium.com/@brittany.williams881/youre-never-too- old-3b0ec259342 first appearing in a silent capacity in the first book season finale before being introduced fully onscreen in the second book episode \\"The Lucky Cat Car\\" as the leader of a group of delinquent raider passengers known as the Apex, alongside her second-in-command Simon Laurent. Grace is the focus of the third book of the series, where alongside Simon, she travels alongside a young girl named Hazel and her gorilla friend Tuba after being separated from the Apex. Background Grace is an 18-year-old woman initially shown to be sociopathic and amoral in her actions, justifying them by saying that she is a passenger and was entitled to get whatever she wants, and seemed to be incapable of feeling remorse or guilt. She was charming and manipulative, recruiting hundreds of children on her side and brainwashed them into thinking bringing their numbers down and improving themselves was a weakness. She held a delusional belief in worshipping the Conductor Amelia to the point of establishing a cult-like gang dedicated to her, and had no qualms in killing or using people and denizens just to get what she wanted, once allowing Apex member Lucy to shoot herself in the eye with a harpoon gun.https://twitter.com/lindsaykatai/status/1294862086493728769 Due to arriving on the Train while it was under the control of Amelia, Grace originally believed that One-One is a usurper and maintained a twisted belief that the goal was not to bring your number down so you can exit the train, but to have the highest number possible. She also believed that the residents of the train are \\"nulls\\" (\\"not even a zero\\"), and did not even believe they could think for themselves, demonstrating her former Social Darwinist beliefs, inspired by The Lord of the Flies and an unnamed book from which she got the title of \\"The Apex\\".https://www.slashfilm.com/infinity-train-season-2-review/ Grace's character design is that of a young African-American woman with short dark hair in dreadlocks. Like all members of the Apex, she has a red horizontal squiggle line across her face, based on the oscillating eye of Amelia's robotic suit as \\"The Conductor\\". Her outfit is a pale orange top with two shoplifting tags on each sleeve and a red and purple triangle pattern on the trim of the sleeves over a pink bra with grayish purple shorts, gold earrings that resemble upside-down exclamation marks, a green fanny pack, purple kneepads and pale red sneakers. Her disguise, used to bypass denizens including Samantha the Cat, consists of a black robe, a yellow mask (lost in \\"The Musical Car\\"), and grayish-purple opera gloves, one of which hides her number. In \\"The Debutante Ball Car\\", Grace wears a ball gown with the same color scheme as her usual outfit and puffy sleeves. Her hair is tied back using a headpiece with three orange feathers, she wears a yellow choker with a white diamond, and keeps her earrings and opera gloves. As of \\"The New Apex\\" she gets rid of her Apex Mark as a sign of beginning to redeem herself.https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/08/infinity-train-book-3-is-about-the- lies-we-tell-ourselves/ She was designed by Megan Phonesavanh, who modeled some of the Apex children on childhood photos of members of the Infinity Train crew. Role in Infinity Train Before boarding the Infinity Train, Grace grew up in a wealthy family, under neglectful parents who hired various assistants to watch her rather than spend time with her personally. After being arrested for shoplifting in attempt to acquire attention and still ignored by her parents, Grace boarded the Infinity Train after it appeared before her. Seven years prior to the beginning of Book Three, she briefly encountered Amelia in her robotic suit inside the Pumpkin Car, her appearance at the time as \\"The Conductor\\" leaving a lasting impression on her. Sometime after this, she became friends with Simon after saving him from a Ghom, a parasitic creature from outside the train, and after indoctrinating him with her philosophy of needing to attain the highest numbers, they together formed the Apex, a cult worshipping their image of Amelia and deriding One-One, who they believe to be a \\"False Conductor\\" instead of Amelia, as well as teaching that the native denizens of the train (which they dub \\"nulls\\") are their playthings, non-real beings to be done with as they desire, with those they perceive as being more dangerous to their way of life to be \\"wheeled\\" (pushed off the train in-between carriages and crushed beneath the wheels of the train, killing them). Grace is inferred to have previously killed many such denizens in this fashion.https://www.bubbleblabber.com/season-review-infinity- train-season-one/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment- arts/tv/story/2019-08-08/infinity-train-owen-dennis In Book One, Grace is briefly glimpsed onscreen in the passenger records hijacked by Amelia. Kirby Howell-Baptiste voiced Grace in the series In Book Two, a masked Grace is introduced towards the conclusion of \\"The Lucky Cat Car\\", where she and \\"The Apex\\" loot a train car being overseen by The Cat. She then takes Jesse and MT to the Mall Car, where she introduces the pair to The Apex, and also Simon Laurent, her second-in-command. She then takes Jesse to the Cube Car where Jesse is forced to kick a sentient cube, making his number go up, while Simon and the Apex attempt to kill MT.https://www.bubbleblabber.com/review-infinity- train-book-2-the-mall-car-the-wasteland/https://comicbook.com/tv- shows/news/cartoon-network-infinity-train-the-apex-season-3/ After Jesse saves MT, Grace reveals herself and Simon to love terrorizing the \\"Nulls\\" of the train and that they are nothing to her, and should not be seen as people. After his number reaches \\"0\\" and he is unwillingly removed from the train, leaving MT behind, Grace expresses disappointment at Jesse's choice, with Simon calling Jesse weak, and Grace correcting him to claim Jesse was only misled. The pair then attempt to kill MT before she flees the car.https://www.bubbleblabber.com/review-infinity-train-book-2-the-tape-car- the-number-car/https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/cartoon-network-infinity- train-the-apex-season-3/ In Book Three, after being separate from the Apex alongside Simon, Grace's experiences with 6-year-old Hazel and her gorilla companion Tuba begins to cause her to be more open-minded as she gradually becomes more kind-hearted and sympathetic toward denizens, even referring to them by their actual names and titles, instead of just calling them all \\"nulls\\" and even saying that Tuba is one of the good ones instead of seeing them as all evil.https://tv.avclub.com/book-3-is-infinity-train-s-best-most- challenging-seaso-1844694673https://tvsourcemagazine.com/2020/08/infinity- train-book-3-recap-episode-2/ When Simon murders Tuba in cold blood per Grace's original plan, Grace is visibly shocked and angered, although it is unclear if this was because of her gradual friendship with Tuba or because Simon blatantly disobeyed her order to not kill Tuba.https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/infinity-train-manifestations-of-trauma-and- abuse/https://tvsourcemagazine.com/2020/09/infinity-train-book-3-recap- episode-5-the-color-clock-car/ After finding out from Amelia that One-One is indeed the true conductor and what he said about getting the number down was true she was ashamed for her past misdeeds. She begins to show true compassion toward denizens, and even removes her Apex mark. After Hazel left with Amelia for her treatment of her and Simon tried to get rid of her for her abandonment of her own philosophy, Grace decided to fix her mistakes, starting by helping the kids in the Apex getting their numbers down and stop telling them how they should be. It is also shown that Grace does show poignant sadness when she lost people she deeply cares for, such as crying agitatedly when Hazel left her, and after witnessing Simon being killed by a Ghom and him being reduced to ashes.https://www.cbr.com/infinity-train-simon-most-frightening-realistic- antagonist/ Grace and Simon used to be the closest friends after Grace rescued Simon, who was unwittingly abandoned to a Ghom by Samantha the Cat, and they formed the Apex together, a group who aim to vandalize the train and attack its denizens to keep their numbers high. A deleted scene depicts the pair as having been briefly romantically involved in their youth.https://twitter.com/cuppatan/status/1301962087384535042 Although they once shared their ideology together, their relationship soon decayed after Grace met Hazel and has softened up to denizens, which was only aggravated after the death of Tuba and Grace being forced to save face in front of Simon, who grew to distrust her. Eventually, Grace was being considered as a void by the deranged Simon who swore her as his enemy and nearly got murdered by him, even after she tried rescuing him. Despite their broken friendship, Grace realizes her mistakes of how she made him believe in lies and was heartbroken when a Ghom killed Simon. After realizing that their entire philosophy was wrong and became truly sorry for how horribly she treated denizens, Grace dissolves the Apex in order to turn it into a new group dedicated to getting her followers' numbers down to zero so they can leave the train.https://observer.com/2020/09/infinity-train-book-3-review-owen- dennis/https://www.reportdoor.com/infinity-train-has-infinite-potential-for- new-seasons-beyond-book-3/ References External links * Official website of Infinity Train ‚Äì Cartoon Network * Official website of Infinity Train ‚Äì HBO Max Category:Television characters introduced in 2019 Category:Fictional explorers Category:Fictional cult leaders Category:Fictional cults Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional characters based on real people Category:Fictional victims of child abuse Category:Animated human characters Category:Female characters in animation Category:Teenage characters in television Category:Cartoon Network Studios characters Category:Black characters in animation Category:Infinity Train ","title":"Grace Monroe"},{"id":"65269686","text":"Muurame church, located in Muurame, central Finland, was designed by the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, and completed in 1929. Architecture It was the first Aalto-designed church, and the only one of his many church designs in the 1920s, to be built, and represents his transition from Nordic Classicism to the Functionalist style he is mostly known for. As a transitional work, the Muurame church has been undervalued among Aalto's designs by many critics, and even the architect himself called it his 'aberration of youth' (nuoruudensynti). The church's elongated-nave, single- aisle design and campanile (belfry) were influenced by Aalto's honeymoon trip to Italy a few years earlier, and the churches he saw there. Renovation The church was comprehensively restored in 2016 to its original design. Most notably, the interior colour scheme was changed from its pre-renovation white and light wood ‚Äî often associated with Aalto's minimalist style ‚Äî to the original, more colourful one consisting of bright blue and red ceiling and dark grey fixtures.

He worked as a music journalist in the 1960s under the name Johnny Dean, and was the founder and editor of Beat Instrumental, The Beatles Book, and Record Collector magazines. Biography Born in London, he ran a coffee bar before starting work in the music business in the mid-1950s. He wrote songs and contacted music publishers, while working at the same time for ABC Television. In the early 1960s he became the advertising manager of Pop Weekly, a magazine published by Robert Stigwood, through which he first came into contact with Brian Epstein. In late 1962, he established his own magazine, Beat Monthly (later Beat Instrumental), which started featuring the Beatles as cover stars early in 1963. As the Beatles' popularity in the UK grew, O'Mahony approached Epstein with the suggestion that he produce a monthly magazine devoted to the band. This was The Beatles Book, first published in August 1963, with an initial print run of 40,000, which quickly sold out. At its peak, the magazine went on to sell some 300,000 copies each month. As Johnny Dean, O'Mahony continued to edit and write for the magazine with the full support of Epstein and the band, and also launched the parallel Monkees Monthly in early 1967. The final edition of the original Beatles Book was published in late 1969, but in 1976 O'Mahony began to republish the original issues alongside new content.

This polysaccharide is exclusive of the reproduction and is only found in the albumen gland from the female snail reproductive system and in the perivitelline fluid of eggs. Galactogen serves as an energy reserve for developing embryos and hatchlings, which is later replaced by glycogen in juveniles and adults. The advantage of accumulating galactogen instead of glycogen in eggs remains unclear, although some hypotheses have been proposed (see below). Occurrence and distribution Galactogen has been reported in the albumen gland of pulmonate snails such as Helix pomatia, Limnaea stagnalis, Oxychilus cellarius, Achatina fulica, Aplexa nitens and Otala lactea, Bulimnaea megasoma, Ariolimax columbianis, Ariophanta, Biomphalaria glabrata, and Strophochelius oblongus. This polysaccharide was also identified in the Caenogastropoda Pila virens and Viviparus, Pomacea canaliculata, and Pomacea maculata. In adult gastropods, galactogen is confined to the albumen gland, showing a large variation in content during the year and reaching a higher peak in the reproductive season. During the reproductive season, this polysaccharide is rapidly restored in the albumen gland after being transferred to the eggs, decreasing its total amount only after repeated ovipositions. In Pomacea canaliculata snails, galactogen would act, together with perivitellins, as a main limiting factor of reproduction. This polysaccharide has been identified in the Golgi zone of the secretory cells from the albumen gland in the form of discrete granules 200 √Ö in diameter. The appearance of galactogen granules within the secretory globules suggests that this is the site of biosynthesis of the polysaccharide. Apart from the albumen gland, galactogen is also found as a major component of the perivitelline fluid from the snail eggs, comprising the main energy source for the developing embryo.  Structure  Galactogen is a polymer of galactose with species-specific structural variations. In this polysaccharide, the D-galactose are predominantly Œ≤ (1‚Üí3) and Œ≤ (1‚Üí6) linked; however some species also have Œ≤ (1‚Üí2) and Œ≤ (1‚Üí4). The galactogen of the aquatic Basommatophora (e.g. Lymnaea, Biomphalaria) is highly branched with only 5-8 % of the sugar residues in linear sections, and Œ≤(1‚Üí3) and Œ≤(1‚Üí6) bonds alternate more-or-Iess regularly. In the terrestrial Stylommatophora (e.g. Helix, Arianta, Cepaea, Achatina) up to 20% of the sugar residues are linear Œ≤(1‚Üí3) bound. The galactogen of Ampullarius sp species has an unusually large proportion of linearly arranged sugars, with 5% Œ≤(1‚Üí3), 26% Œ≤(1‚Üí6), and 10% Œ≤(1‚Üí2). Other analyses in Helix pomatia suggested a dichotomous structure, where each galactopyranose unit bears a branch or side chain. Molecular weight determinations in galactogen extracted from the eggs of Helix pomatia and Limnaea stagnalis were estimated in 4x106 and 2.2x106, respectively. In these snails galactogen contains only D-galactose. Depending upon the origin of the galactogen, apart from D-galactose, L-galactose, L-fucose, D-glucose, L-glucose and phosphate residues may also be present; for instance, the galactogen from Ampullarius sp. contains 98% of D-galacotose and 2% of L- fucose, and the one isolated from Pomacea maculata eggs consist in 68% of D-galactose and 32% of D-glucose. Phosphate-substituted galactose residues are found in the galactogen of individual species from various snail genera such as Biomphalaria, Helix and Cepaea. Therefore, current knowledge indicates it could be considered either a homopolysaccharide of or a heteropolysaccharide dominated by galactose. Metabolism Galactogen is synthesized by secretory cells in the albumen gland of adult female snails and later transferred to the egg. This process is under neurohormonal control, notably by the brain galactogenin. The biochemical pathways for glycogen and galactogen synthesis are closely related. Both use glucose as a common precursor and its conversion to activated galactose is catalyzed by UDP-glucose 4-epimerase and galactose-1-P uridyl-transferase. This enables glucose to be the common precursor for both glycogenesis and galactogenesis. In fact, both polysaccharides are found in the same secretory cells of the albumen gland and are subject to independent seasonal variations. Glycogen accumulates in autumn as a general energy store for hibernation, whereas galactogen is synthesized during spring in preparation of egg-laying. It is commonly accepted that galactogen production is restricted to embryo nutrition and therefore is mainly transferred to eggs. Little is known about the galactogen-synthesizing enzymes. A D-galactosyltransferase was described in the albumen gland of Helix pomatia. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of D-galactose to a (1‚Üí6) linkage and is dependent upon the presence of acceptor galactogen. Similarly, a Œ≤-(1‚Üí3)-galactosyltransferase activity has been detected in albumen gland extracts from Limnaea stagnalis. In embryos and fasting newly hatched snails, galactogen is most likely an important donor (via galactose) of metabolic intermediates. In feeding snails, the primary diet is glucose-containing starch and cellulose. These polymers are digested and contribute glucose to the pathways of intermediary metabolism. Galactogen consumption begins at the gastrula stage and continues throughout development. Up to 46-78 % of egg galactogen disappears during embryo development. The remainder is used up within the first days after hatching. Only snail embryos and hatchlings are able to degrade galactogen, whereas other animals and even adult snails do not. Œ≤-galactosidase may be important in the release of galactose from galactogen; however, most of the catabolic pathway of this polysaccharide is still unknown. Other functions Besides being a source of energy, few other functions have been described for galactogen in the snail eggs, and all of them are related to embryo defense and protection. Given that carbohydrates retain water, the high amount of this polysaccharide would protect the eggs from desiccation from those snails that have aerial oviposition. Besides, the high viscosity that the polysaccharide may confer to the perivitelline fluid has been suggested as a potential antimicrobial defense. Since galactogen is a Œ≤-linked polysaccharide, such as cellulose or hemicelluloses, specific biochemical adaptations are needed to exploit it as a nutrient, such as specific glycosidases. However, apart from snail embryos and hatchlings, no animal seems to be able to catabolize galactogen, including adult snails. This fact led to consider galactogen as part of an antipredation defense system exclusive of gastropods, deterring predators by lowering the nutritional value of eggs.

Its production was funded by the Mizrakh Company or the HaMizrah Society of Odessa, Ukraine in the Russian Empire and occurred during a two-month visit of the Russian and Ukrainian filmmakers to Palestine. Me√≠ron Ossip Grossman was the cinematographer. It debuted in 1913 at the 11th Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland.

Semantic memory In psychology, semantic memory is memory for meaning ‚Äì in other words, the aspect of memory that preserves only the gist, the general significance, of remembered experience ‚Äì while episodic memory is memory for the ephemeral details ‚Äì the individual features, or the unique particulars of experience. The term 'episodic memory' was introduced by Tulving and Schacter in the context of 'declarative memory' which involved simple association of factual or objective information concerning its object. Word meaning is measured by the company they keep, i.e. the relationships among words themselves in a semantic network. The memories may be transferred intergenerationally or isolated in one generation due to a cultural disruption. Different generations may have different experiences at similar points in their own time-lines. This may then create a vertically heterogeneous semantic net for certain words in an otherwise homogeneous culture.Giannini, A. J.; Semiotic and Semantic Implications of \\"Authenticity\\", Psychological Reports, 106(2):611‚Äì612, 2010 In a network created by people analyzing their understanding of the word (such as Wordnet) the links and decomposition structures of the network are few in number and kind, and include part of, kind of, and similar links. In automated ontologies the links are computed vectors without explicit meaning. Various automated technologies are being developed to compute the meaning of words: latent semantic indexing and support vector machines as well as natural language processing, artificial neural networks and predicate calculus techniques. Ideasthesia Ideasthesia is a psychological phenomenon in which activation of concepts evokes sensory experiences. For example, in synesthesia, activation of a concept of a letter (e.g., that of the letter A) evokes sensory-like experiences (e.g., of red color). Psychosemantics In the 1960s, psychosemantic studies became popular after Charles E. Osgood's massive cross-cultural studies using his semantic differential (SD) method that used thousands of nouns and adjective bipolar scales. A specific form of the SD, Projective Semantics method uses only most common and neutral nouns that correspond to the 7 groups (factors) of adjective-scales most consistently found in cross-cultural studies (Evaluation, Potency, Activity as found by Osgood, and Reality, Organization, Complexity, Limitation as found in other studies). In this method, seven groups of bipolar adjective scales corresponded to seven types of nouns so the method was thought to have the object-scale symmetry (OSS) between the scales and nouns for evaluation using these scales. For example, the nouns corresponding to the listed 7 factors would be: Beauty, Power, Motion, Life, Work, Chaos, Law. Beauty was expected to be assessed unequivocally as ‚Äúvery good‚Äù on adjectives of Evaluation-related scales, Life as ‚Äúvery real‚Äù on Reality-related scales, etc. However, deviations in this symmetric and very basic matrix might show underlying biases of two types: scales-related bias and objects-related bias. This OSS design meant to increase the sensitivity of the SD method to any semantic biases in responses of people within the same culture and educational background. Prototype theory Another set of concepts related to fuzziness in semantics is based on prototypes. The work of Eleanor Rosch in the 1970s led to a view that natural categories are not characterizable in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, but are graded (fuzzy at their boundaries) and inconsistent as to the status of their constituent members. One may compare it with Jung's archetype, though the concept of archetype sticks to static concept. Some post-structuralists are against the fixed or static meaning of the words. Derrida, following Nietzsche, talked about slippages in fixed meanings. Systems of categories are not objectively out there in the world but are rooted in people's experience. These categories evolve as learned concepts of the world ‚Äì meaning is not an objective truth, but a subjective construct, learned from experience, and language arises out of the \\"grounding of our conceptual systems in shared embodiment and bodily experience\\". A corollary of this is that the conceptual categories (i.e. the lexicon) will not be identical for different cultures, or indeed, for every individual in the same culture. This leads to another debate (see the Sapir‚ÄìWhorf hypothesis or Eskimo words for snow).

Ellis's shipyard in Tottenville, Staten Island. A large number of pilots and their families came to the shipyard to observe the launch of the new pilot-boat. She was built by Jacob S. Ellis at an expense of $13,000, for co-ownership with Electus Comfort, W. J. Barry, James McCarthy, and Maurice J. Mariga. Her length was 88 feet, breadth of beam 21 feet, depth of hold is 9 feet and 150 tones. The name of the boat was chosen as Joseph F. Loubat, who was a yachtsman and author of one of the earliest American yachting memoir: A Yachtsman‚Äôs Scrap Book, or the Ups and Downs of Yacht Racing. Captain Electus Comfort was master of the boat. The Joseph F. Loubat was registered with the Record of American and Foreign Shipping from 1882-1888. Boat accidents Joseph F.

In September 1950, he left for France on a French Government Scholarship to pursue his Doctorate at the Sorbonne University of Paris. He completed his DOCTEUR-ES- SCIENCES (D. Sc.) Degree (Tres Honourable) under an eminent scientist Prof. Felix Trombe (Director of a lab under CNRS). The doctoral research work was on the separation and study of Scandium at the Rare Earths lab. In June 1957, V. K. Iya married Shrimati, daughter of B. N. Sastri and Bhagirathamma Sastri. Professional Career File photo: Dr V K Iya with Jawaharlal Nehru at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, IndiaFile photo: Dr V K Iya with Indira Gandhi at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, IndiaDr. Iya was personally selected by Dr. Homi J. Bhabha in Paris to join the Indian Atomic Energy Programme in 1955 and was directly put on deputation to work in the French Nuclear Laboratories at Saclay for two years. As suggested by Dr Bhabha based on his personal association with Dr. Bertrand Goldschmidt (Commissioner, CEA, France), Dr. Iya could also study the production and separation of radioisotopes during this period. In 1957, he joined the Chemistry Division of the then Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET) which was subsequently renamed as Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). Dr. Bhabha had initially availed the services of a British Scientist C.B.G. Taylor for the radioisotope programme and Dr. Iya took over the mantle, when Taylor returned to UK. He led the programme as the Head of Isotope Section and then became the Head of Isotope Division around 1963. In 1974, he was appointed Director of Isotope Group, the post he held until his superannuation at the end of September 1987. He oversaw the programmes of several major streams: radio-isotopes and radio-chemicals; labelled compounds; radiation sources; radio-pharmaceuticals; industrial applications of radiation and radio-tracers; radiation processing of materials and medical products; isotope hydrology; etc. Apart from all the above societal applications, he also played a role in the strategic programme of Peaceful Nuclear Explosion conducted at Pokharan under the code name Smiling Buddha on May 18, 1974. The radioisotope for the trigger device was produced under his leadership. Dr. Iya was a Member of the Governing Council of Tata Memorial Hospital/Centre, Mumbai for a very long time. He was one of founder members of the department of Nuclear Medicine at the Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai. He was also on the Governing Council/Board of several other organisations/institutes: Kidwai Memorial Hospital (later Inst. of Oncology), Bengaluru Bangalore Cancer Hospital (later Inst. of Oncology), Bengaluru P D Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai Hyderabad Science Society, Hyderabad Scientific Advisory Committee of Span Research Centre, Surat Chairperson of Radiopharmaceuticals Committee RPC from its inception in 1967 to 1987 Dr. Iya played a key role in the establishment of the new initiative for regional cooperation under the auspices of the IAEA and the birth of the scheme called ‚ÄòRegional Cooperation Agreement for Research, Development and Training Related to Nuclear Science and Technology for Asia and the Pacific (RCA)‚Äô in 1972. He served as the RCA National Representative of India until his retirement. Post his retirement, he remained an adviser and consultant to BARC, BRIT and DAE on the management of radioisotope programme. He was the Chairman of the DAE Committee constituted in 1998 to review and revamp the radioisotope programme of DAE and its Units BRIT and BARC. The Report prepared under his leadership provided the roadmap for all the subsequent programme focus and management structure. Legacy and Achievements Dr. Iya was a part of the first generation professionals of Indian atomic energy programme, with the pride of having worked with Dr. Homi Bhabha. His tenure, commencing from Cadell Road lab, spanned several first-of-a-kind accomplishments carried out in the laboratories in the South Site area of Trombay for the radioisotope programme in AEET. Initially the Apsara reactor, and subsequently the CIRUS reactor, gave a good boost to the programmes under his leadership. Dr. Iya is considered a pioneering scientist in the field of radioisotope where only a few countries of that time had such programmes and facilities. The pressing need for more laboratory space, and interest in having proximity to CIRUS reactor, were addressed by the design and setting up of isotope lab facilities in the new facility, RLG, built in the ‚Äònorth site‚Äô of AEET. Dr. Iya was the Project Director for the BARC-UNDP cooperation initiative in setting up India‚Äôs first gamma radiation sterilisation plant ISOMED commissioned in 1974. The young Dr. Iya had the privilege of being (the junior) part of the First Indian Delegation under the Leadership of Dr. Homi Bhabha to represent India at the IAEA‚Äôs First General Conference (GC) in 1957. He was invited by Dr. Bhabha to be again in the team for the 1960 GC of IAEA. Dr. Iya groomed a number of colleagues to become domain experts and leaders in various aspects of radioisotope programme and they carried forward his mission of the radioisotope programme with aplomb for the benefit of India. Some of them also served at the IAEA and thus the benefits of his grooming professionals reached many other countries through the IAEA.

Tectonism paused for perhaps 10 million years, producing an unconformity that separates the McRae from the Love Ranch Formation. The clasts within the conglomerate beds of the formation record the progressive erosion of beds from the uplift backwards in time, from Cretaceous volcanic clasts at the base of the formation to Precambrian clasts in its upper beds.

Biography - The Early Years John F. Tenaglia was born in South Philadelphia, February 5, 1964 to parents Frank (Francesco) and Dorothy (nee Cavella). Born into an Italian- American family, where culture was an inbedded guide for life. Especially in education, culinary and musical arts, with firm religious aspects. At age 8 John started violin lessons with the famed violinist and conductor Joseph Primavera of the Philadelphia Orchestra and founder of the Philadelphia Youth Orchestra. Young John had little to no interest in the instrument. In 1978, The Tenaglia Family was invited to a performance of Puccini's Madama Butterfly being presented at the Forum Theater in South Philadelphia. The person singing Pinkerton that night was renowned tenor Frank Munafo (a graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music). John was so inspired by Munafo‚Äôs singing, he instantly knew this is what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. Mr. Tenaglia was quoted saying; ‚ÄúI felt that Frank Munafo was singing directly to me, even though there were hundreds in the audience!‚Äù Having minimal musical training at this age and limited knowledge of opera, the young man instinctively started listening to recordings found in his families house of Mario Lanza, Mario Del Monaco, Beniamino Gigli and Richard Tucker. This also encouraged him to join local church choirs where he could learn more about the art of singing. Inevitably, for the 13 year old, nature took it‚Äôs course and John was no longer able to imitate these wonderful tenors. Dejected, he thought he‚Äôd never be able to sing like his idol Frank Munafo. His Church Choir Director told him he should start singing in the baritone and bass sections. As John entered Junior High he became a member of the choir at Thomas Junior High School. This is where Mr. Tenaglia met his soon to be mentor William Yeats. Mr. Yeats was also a renowned tenor (a graduate of Indiana University and Curtis Institute of Music) and the choir director at South Philadelphia High School. Mr. Yeats, would go around to all the local junior high schools to recruit talent for his High School Choir. Mr. Yeats recognized talent in Mr. Tenaglia but said nothing to the youngster until he officially became a student of the famous South Philadelphia High School. John had no idea of the background and caliber of his teacher. One afternoon as John was on his way to his next class, when he heard what he thought was a recording playing of Che gelida mania from La Boh√®me. As John looked into the room from where the music was coming, here it was William Yeats accompanying himself and singing the aria in preparation for an upcoming concert. Tenaglia quietly snuck in the room. Standing there, listening as Mr. Yeats continued to sing the aria as tears ran down the face of the young student, stunned from the sheer beauty of Mr. Yeats‚Äôs singing. John moved to find a comfortable standing position as a book fell off the desk behind him. Mr. Yeats turned around startled, yelled at him and said; \\"what are you doing in here?! You're Not Supposed to be in here!!\\" Tenaglia's answer was; \\"why are you singing that, you're not Italian!\\" They both looked at each other and instantly broke into laughter. That is the moment their father, son relationship began. Mr. Yeats explained to John, that he had a talent. So he offered him a deal. \\"If John promised to take music seriously and pursue it as his career, he in turn offered him free voice lessons every day after school for his remaining time at South Philadelphia High School all free of charge!\\" There was one catch, Tenaglia had to promise him, that one day he would also give back this service to a young promising student. Education and career John Tenaglia was accepted on scholarship to the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts where he studied with famed teacher Vivian Wagner. John earned a Bachelor of Music and Masters of Music Degrees in 5 years of study finishing in 1986. In the summers he traveled the country as a member of the \\"Tenaglia Trio\\" with his future wife Soprano Joan (Kratowicz)Tenaglia and younger brother, Tenor Frank Tenaglia (another prodigy of William Yeats). They performed Operatic and Crossover Concerts. Quite often they were invited to perform as headliners with the Legendary Pat Cooper, the Late Arturo Coppola in Concert Halls and Major Italian Festivals. At age 19, Tenaglia's 1st professional role was Papageno in Mozart's Magic Flute. As a young baritone he performed the roles of Marcello and Schaunard in Puccini's La Boheme, Count Almaviva in Le Nozze di Figaro, Baron Zeta in Franz Leh√°r‚Äôs The Merry Widow, Pish-Tush in Gilbert and Sullivan's Mikado and Silvio in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci. As years went by, maturity had begun to develop into the baritone‚Äôs voice. Noticing that his natural ability was being compromised, Mr Tenaglia desperately searched for a teacher who could help him incorporate his natural ability with a solid technique. Colleagues led him to famed teachers Armin Boyajian, Richard Barrett and Enrico di Giuseppe, all to no avail. Frank Munafo suggested and introduced him to Gary Magby. Mr. Magby was a singer himself, however was recognized as a master vocal coach and conductor. Mr.Tenaglia made such a connection with Gary Magby. Mr. Magby built John‚Äôs technique and introduced the spirituality and musicality that‚Äôs needed to accompany it. Subsequently, Mr. Tenaglia was then being hired for more demanding roles such as Tonio in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, Sharpless in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, Scarpia in Tosca, Gianni Schicchi-Gianni Schicchi. Germont in Verdi's La Traviata, Rigoletto in Rigoletto and Amonasro in Aida. Mr. Tenaglia was invited to perform the lead roles in world premieres. His 1st was Mr. Jenkins in Libby Larson's \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" commissioned through OperaDelaware. Throughout John Tenaglia's career he has sung with most of the major opera companies in the United States. Some of which include: OperaDelaware, Chautauqua Opera (also where he served his union apprenticeship), Opera Company of Philadelphia, New York City Opera, Pennsylvania Opera Theater, Cape Cod Lyric, Florentine Opera, Florham Opera, Berks Grand Opera, Chicago Symphony, Chautauqua Symphony, Haddonfield Symphony, Warminster Symphony. Oratorio work Aside from John Tenaglia's operatic career he extensively performed the sacred works of Laudes Avangeli (United States Premiere Bruno Rigacci Conductor) Handel's Messiah, Mendelssohn's Elijah, Mozart‚Äôs Requiem, Verdi‚Äòs Requiem, Faure‚Äòs Requiem, Mozart‚Äòs C Minor, Liszt‚Äòs Via Crucis. Brahms Requiem, Beethoven‚Äôs 9th Symphony.

Woodford Hill was an estate extending from Eden River to L‚Äôanse Noire. An Amerindian village existed at the mouth of the Woodford Hill river about 1,400 years ago. The present day village of Woodford Hill is on the western boundary of the old estate. It is made up of various sections including Small Farm, Mount Sylvie, Falang, Larieu, Fond Cole, Joe Road, and Big Cedar. According to the 2011 census report, Woodford Hill had a population of 1,034 (545 male and 489 female). History When the French arrived to Dominica in the early 1700s they called the former Woodford Hill estate La Soie, after the Bois La Soie bush. The entire parish in which it is situated was called Quarte de La Soie. The area was put up for sale by the crown when the British occupied Dominica in 1763. A significant portion was bought by Napleton Smith. As a result, the present Creole name for the village of Woodford Hill is Simit (the ‚Äòcockoy‚Äô, or English Creole pronunciation of Smith), in reference to the estate owner. Robert Aberdein was the owner of the Woodford Hill Estate until around 1826. After that point Faur Mourillon was a joint owner with F.V. Mourillon until their last known association in 1832. During the mid 19th century, the estate was owned by Charles Leatham who was nicknamed the ‚Äúsugar king of Dominica‚Äù. The area had gently sloping land and was one of the largest sugar producing estates on island. Five years before the emancipation of the British West Indies, 112 slaves worked in Woodford Hill, producing 66,000 lbs of sugar, 2,550 gallons of rum and 400 gallons of molasses. The ruins of the sugar plantation can still be seen by the seashore. The post-emancipation village of Woodford Hill developed on hilly land between the former Woodford Hill Estate and Hodges. At the end of the 19th century Woodford Hill was 1,123 acres large and the estate was bought by Estates Investment Trust of Dominica who owned it until they sold it to Captain William James Ross Stebbings in the 1930s. It was then acquired by Frobel Laville in the 1940s who sold it to Ernest Foley and Geoffrey Band in 1948. They owned it until Van Geest Banana company purchased the estate in 1954. In 1974, the Dominica Labour Party government, under the leadership of Patrick John, acquired 400 acres of the estate along the coast from Geest Industries and other landowners for the building of an airport and other projects. These projects were supposed to be developed under an agreement with Barbadian weapons smuggler Sydney Burnette Alleyne. Mass protests led to the resignation of Patrick John and the planned projects were not forthcoming. In the late 1970s and 1980s Geest divided the rest of the estate into farm lots and they were sold mainly to villagers of the northeast.

While at Harvard, he received the \\"Travel-Study Prize for Excellence in Teaching,\\" from the Department of Romance Languages (May 1980) and the \\"Certificate of Distinction in Teaching\\" from the University Committee on Undergraduate Education\\" (December 1983). After graduating from Harvard, Mormando entered the Jesuit Order, where he furthered his education in the form of a two-year, non-degree study of philosophy (Biennio di Filosofia) at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, Italy, and a five-year program at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley, California, receiving a Master's of Divinity (1992) and the S.T.L. (or Licentiate of Sacred Theology, a pontifical degree) in Church History (1994). Mormando was ordained a priest in the Jesuit order but left the Society and the priesthood in 2002. After his studies in Berkeley, Mormando obtained (July 1994) a full-time tenure-track position in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at Boston College, where he has been since, now at the rank of full professor, and where he also serves as the department's chairperson. He also holds an affiliate position in the university's History Department. A popular lecturer on Italian art to general audiences, Mormando has made presentations at the Metropolitan Museum and Frick Museum of New York; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the Galleria Borghese, Rome; the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas; the Phoenix Art Museum; the Istituto Italiano di Cultura (San Francisco); the Italian Embassy in Washington, D.C.; and Harvard and Yale Universities. For the topics and dates of these public presentations see Mormando's complete CV available at: https://www.francomormando.com/cv/ On October 12, 2005, he was awarded the title of Cavaliere (Knight) in the honorary Order of the Star of Italy, conferred by the President of Italy in recognition of achievement in the promotion of Italian language and culture.For the Italian government recognition given to Mormando, see https://www.quirinale.it/onorificenze/insigniti/216979 Scholarly life and work =Bernardino of Siena= Mormando's first scholarly publication was published in 1999 by the University of Chicago Press: The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy, an extensive study of the preaching campaigns of the popular Franciscan preacher Bernardino, \\"the voice most eagerly listened to\\" and \\"perhaps the most influential religious force\\" in Italy during his lifetime. F. Mormando, The Preacher's Demons (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), p. 4. A study of the preacher's vociferous and at time violent campaigns against witches, sodomites, and Jews, all seen as dangerous enemies of Christian society, Mormando's book singlehandedly overturned the prevailing image of Bernardino as a benevolent, reassuring, pacific presence in late medieval/early Renaissance Italy, in contrast to the later preacher Girolamo Savonarola. Cornell University historian Richard Trexler noted in his review of Mormando's monograph: \\"As is clearly shown in this well-written, thoroughly documented study, few historical figures of fifteenth-century Italy have come up smelling like roses at the hands of historians quite like the Observant Franciscan, Bernardino of Siena. But in fact, Bernardino was a rhetorical assassin, encouraging his listeners to denounce, and even to kill those who did not meet with his approval.\\"Trexler review in The Catholic Historical Review, vol. 85, n. 4, 1999, pp. 621-622. For the benevolent picture of Bernardino painted by previous idolizing historians, see F. Mormando, The Preacher's Demons (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), p. 48. The Preacher's Demons went on to win the prestigious Howard R. Marraro Prize for Distinguished Scholarship in Italian History, conferred (January 2001) by the American Catholic Historical Association.For Mormando's Marraro prize, see: https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on- history/february-2001/american-catholic-historical-association-presents-awards =Caravaggio= In the same years that he was completing The Preacher's Demons, Mormando was busy organizing at Boston College's McMullen Museum of Art a major art exhibition of Italian Baroque art, conceived by him and entitled Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque ImageSee Franco Mormando, \\"The 'Jesuit Caravaggio' Comes to America,\\" in America: The Jesuit Review, v.180, n. 4 (Feb. 13, 1999), pp.9-14. Opening in February 1999, Saints and Sinners had at its centerpiece the long-lost painting by Baroque artist, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, The Taking of Christ (Rome, 1602), discovered in a Jesuit residence in Dublin, Ireland, and subsequently given on indefinite loan to the National Gallery of Ireland. Mormando's exhibition represented the first appearance of the newly-discovered painting in North America and, as such, garnered much attention from the world press and was visited by many thousands of people in its four-month run.See reviews of the exhibition in the New York Times, Jan. 31, 1999 (https://www.csmonitor.com/1999/0305/p20s1.html) and the Christian Science Monitor, March 5, 1999 (https://www.csmonitor.com/1999/0305/p20s1.html) In addition to introducing the North American public to the painting, the aim of Saints and Sinners was to place Caravaggio within the context of early modern conventions and the traditions of religious art; in other words, while acknowledging his at times unconventional manner and maverick ways, it stressed his direct connection to the familiar tradition of religious art.See the \\"Editor's Introduction\\" in the Saints and Sinners catalog (Chestnut Hill, MA: McMullen Museum, Boston College, 1999), available for free download. Edited by Mormando, the exhibition catalog featured original scholarship by leading experts in Baroque art and culture, including one by Sergio Benedetti (the Dublin conservator who rediscovered and restored the painting) and two essays by Mormando, \\"Teaching the Faithful to Fly: Mary Magdalene and Peter in Baroque Italy\\" and \\"Just as your lips approach the lips of your brothers: Judas Iscariot and the Kiss of Betrayal.\\" Both essays represent surveys and analyses of extensive primary sources to discover what Caravaggio's original audience would have been taught about these three figures of New Testament history that figure prominently in his art. =The bubonic plague= Several years later, Mormando conceived and organized, with some of the same colleagues who put together the Saints and Sinners exhibition, another art exhibition of early modern Italian painting entitled Hope and Healing: Painting in Italy in a Time of Plague, 1500-1800 (Worcester Art Museum, April- September 2005).See the interview with Mormando about the exhibition by journalist Michael Powell and published in the Washington Post, August 16, 2005: https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2005/08/16/plague-art- resonates-in-post-911-world/38b95b84-3c36-4652-a770-6b5f48f7f9f8/ The exhibition aimed to illustrate the hitherto-unrecognized deep and wide presence of the bubonic plague in Old Master Italian painting, as well as the civic role of art in a time of the pandemic.See the interview with Mormando about the relevance of the 2005 plague exhibition to the 2020 coronavirus epidemic published in the alumni magazine,Columbia College Today (Spring 2020): https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/latest/minds/art-time-pandemic The exhibition's catalog features essays by some of the leading scholars of the history of bubonic plague in Europe, including a long introduction by Mormando based on an extensive survey of primary sources, \\"Response to the Plague in Early Modern Italy: What the Primary Sources, Printed and Painted, Reveal.\\" The exhibition was followed by a later companion volume, co-edited by Mormando, Piety and Plague: From Byzantium and the Baroque (Kirksville, MO: Truman State University Press, 2007), which extended the chronological and thematic breadth of the exhibition. Mormando's contribution to the volume was a seventy-five-page essay, \\"Pestilence, Apostasy, and Heresy in Seventeenth- Century Rome: Deciphering Michael Sweerts' Plague in an Ancient City,\\" in which he offers for the first time in the scholarship on that Flemish painter an answer to the long-standing question: What is the real subject of Sweerts's mysterious painting?See the review of Mormando's Sweerts essay by Kiril Petkov in The Sixteenth-Century Studies Journal, v.40, n.4 (Winter 2009), pp.1341-42: \\"The volume [Piety and Plague] properly culminates in Franco Mormando's impressive study of Michael Sweerts's enigmatic Plague in an Ancient City (1650), providing a masterful lesson of 'thick analysis.' Painstakingly and meticulously Mormando employs a wide-ranging array of sources to uncover layer upon layer of political, religious, and cultural allusions in the painting....\\" For a discussion and confirmation of the plausibility of Mormando's thesis regarding the Sweerts painting, see also Lara Yeager- Crasselt, Michael Sweerts (1618-1664): Shaping the Artist and the Academy in Rome and Brussels, Turnhout, Brepols, 2015, pp.84-87. =Gian Lorenzo Bernini= In the most recent phase of his evolving scholarly interests and publication, Mormando has turned his attention to the leading artist of Roman Baroque art and one of the most important influences on all of early modern European sculpture and architecture, Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598-1680). His first work on Bernini was the first unabridged English translation and critical edition of one of the early biographical sources for the life of the artist, written by his youngest son: Domenico Bernini's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2011). Containing close to two hundred pages of source notes and a bibliography of over 600 titles, Mormando's Domenico Bernini edition, as the publisher's dustjacket explains, \\"is, in effect, a one-volume encyclopedia on the artist's life and work. As such, it stands alone within the immense bibliography of Bernini scholarship.\\"See also the interview with Mormando about his Domenico Bernini edition conducted by the Boston College Library: https://dlib.bc.edu/islandora/object/bc-ir%3A107887 Months after the publication of the Domenico Bernini volume, Mormando produced his own biography of Gian Lorenzo, Bernini: His Life and His RomeSee the interview with Mormando about his Bernini biography conducted by the Boston College Library: https://dlib.bc.edu/islandora/object/bc-ir%3A102661. As English art historian Claire Ford-Wille emphasizes in her review of the work, \\"Bernini: His Life and His Rome is a biography for the general reader [‚Ä¶]. Nonetheless, the biography is underpinned by Mormando‚Äôs immense and serious research and is packed with information [‚Ä¶].\\"The Art Newspaper (London), Number 240, November 2012, p. 76. Drawing on many years of research in compiling his annotated Domenico Bernini volume, this subsequent work \\"can claim to be the first biography of Bernini to appear in the English and one of the very few to appear in any language since the artist's death in 1680;\\" it is also the first to make \\"the pursuit of 'Bernini himself,' the uncensored flesh-and-blood human being, one of its primary objectives.\\"F. Mormando, Bernini: His Life and His Rome (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), p. x. Departing in stark fashion from all of the previous, idealizing, hagiographic, uncritical portraits of Bernini of the preceding centuries, Bernini: His Life and His Rome has been criticized by a few readers for including so much unflattering, indeed, at times scandalous, information about Bernini and the people around him (including the popes and the cardinals who were his patrons), but, as the author himself points out in reply to these criticisms (in the online journal, Berfois of London, Oct. 11, 2012),For Mormando's reply and self-defense in Berfois see: \\"Breaking Through the Bernini Myth\\" all of the information in the book is documented in authentic primary sources. As Mormando further reports in the Berfois article, \\"[W]hen I first took up my Bernini biographical project [in 2000] and for a long time into it (it took eleven years to complete), I too simply accepted the conventional wisdom, the aforementioned clich√©s about Bernini, his religion and his art. Yet, the more I studied and uncovered the falsifications of Domenico‚Äôs biography, the more I discovered the skeletons in the life of Bernini, and the more I read of the darker side of his seventeenth-century contemporaries, be they pope, cardinals, or laymen, the more skeptical I became of the myth of Bernini and of his 'Roma Sancta.' Hence, the present call to a more critical approach to the study of Bernini and his art and of his ecclesiastical patrons.\\" Describing the development of Bernini scholarship in modern times, author Loyd Grossman places Mormando in the same company as Rudolph Wittkower, John Pope-Hennessy and Irving Lavin, declaring: \\"Among today's scholars no one has done more to promote Bernini studies than [Franco] Mormando as author of the only English language biography of Bernini and through his magnificent editing of Domenico Bernini's life of his father.\\"Loyd Grossman, An Elephant in Rome: Bernini, the Pope and the Making of the Eternal City (London: Pallas Athene, 2020), 'Acknowledgements,' p.286. =Jesuit history= In addition to his book and articles on Franciscan topics, Mormando has also made Jesuit studies another one of his secondary specializations. In 2006, on the occasion of the anniversary of the Jesuit saint's death, Mormando organized an exhibition at the Burns Rare Book Library, Francis Xavier and the Jesuit Missions in the Far East, featuring the most important primary sources for the biography and canonization of 'the second Jesuit saint' (after Ignatius of Loyola), and contributing an article on \\"The Making of the Second Jesuit Saint: The Campaign for the Canonization of Francis Xavier, 1555-1622.\\" Mormando also contributed to the planning of a 2018 art exhibition conceived and organized by Linda Wolk-Simon at the Fairfield University Art Museum devoted to Jesuit Baroque art, The Holy Name. Art of the Ges√π: Bernini and His AgeSee the review of the exhibition by Brian Allen published in The Art Newspaper (London), February 2, 2018: https://www.theartnewspaper.com/review/how-the-wonders-of- il-gesu-were-transported-to-america. His essay, \\"Gian Paolo Oliva: The Forgotten Celebrity of Baroque Rome,\\" in the accompanying catalog (published by Saint Joseph University Press), presented the first major survey in English of the career of Jesuit Father General Oliva (1600-1681), a friend to and spiritual advisor to Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Most recently, Mormando has addressed the topic of \\"Ignatius the Franciscan: The Franciscan Roots of Jesuit Spirituality,\\" overturning the received wisdom about the putative revolutionary, unique character of the spirituality and way of proceeding of the Jesuit order as founded by Ignatius of LoyolaMormando's complete lecture on \\"Ignatius the Franciscan\\" is available on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6tOEmfYzgc.

Location Kimpoko is on the northeast shore of the Pool Malebo near where a branch of the Congo River enters the Pool to east of the √éles de Kabongo. It is in Kinshasa Province, about as the crow flies to the northeast of the capital city of Kinshasa. History In June 1883 Louis-Gustave Amelot was appointed commander of Kimpoko station. At Kimpoko Amelot got into an argument with a chief and six of his headmen over the rotting carcass of a hippopotamus, which resulted in their being killed. Soon there were rumors that the post was in danger, and Henry Morton Stanley ordered the complete evacuation of its staff and equipment to L√©opoldville. In 1884 Edde Gleerup was appointed head of the Kimpoko Station at Stanley Pool. He built a new station there. A Baptist missionary station was established at Kimpoko in 1886 as a way-station for transportation to the Upper Kasa√Ø region. The missionaries also had stations at Vivi, Isangila and Manyanga.

TB 23 was built by the shipbuilder Yarrow from 1907 to 1908. She was used for local patrol duties in the First World War and was sold for scrap in 1921. Design The Cricket-class was intended as a smaller and cheaper supplement to the large, fast, but expensive Tribal-class destroyer, particularly in coastal waters such as the English Channel. Twelve ships were ordered under the 1905‚Äì1906 shipbuilding programme, with 12 more ordered in November 1906 under the 1906‚Äì1907 programme. The 1906‚Äì1907 orders were distributed with four ships being built by J. Samuel White, two by Denny, two by Thornycroft, two by Hawthorn Leslie and one each by Palmers and Yarrow. TB 23 was long with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was . The ships had turtleback forecastles and two funnels. Two oil-fuelled Yarrow water-tube boilers fed steam to three-stage Parsons steam turbines, driving three propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . Armament consisted of two 12-pounder (76-mm) 12 cwt guns, and three 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes (in three single mounts). The ship had a crew of 35. Service TB 23 was laid down at Yarrow's Cubitt Town, London shipyard on 10 February 1907, was launched on 5 December 1907 and completed on 19 February 1908. TB 23 was commissioned as a tender to at Sheerness Dockyard in March 1908. Later that month she was struck by the gunboat while tied up at a buoy, damaging the torpedo-boat's stem. In March 1913, TB 23 was based at Chatham, in commission, but with a nucleus crew, and remained at Chatham in July 1914. In November 1914, TB 23 was listed as part of the Local Defence Flotilla for The Nore, which had the duty of defending the Thames Estuary. She remained part of The Nore Local Defence Flotilla in December 1918. By January 1919, TB 23, although still at the Nore, had left the Local Defence Flotilla, and by May, was listed as in Reserve at the Nore. By January 1920, TB 23 was, together with most of the remaining torpedo boats, listed as being for sale. She was sold to the shipbreaker Wards for scrapping at their Grays, Essex yard on 9 May 1921, one of twelve Cricket-class ex-coastal destroyers sold to Wards on that day.

As a two-year-old in 2020 she won her first race in the United States and was then sent to Europe where she won the Queen Mary Stakes in England and the Prix Morny in France. Background Campanelle is a bay filly with a white star bred in Ireland by the County Westmeath-based Tally-Ho Stud. In October 2019 she was consigned to the Tattersalls Yearling and was purchased for 190,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Ben McElroy. She entered the ownership of Stonestreet Stables and was exported to the United States where she was sent into training with Wesley Ward. She was sired by Kodiac, a sprinter who won four minor races from twenty starts and finished second in the Hackwood Stakes and fourth in the Prix Maurice de Gheest. He became a very successful breeding stallion, siring many major winners including Tiggy Wiggy, Fairyland and Hello Youmzain. Campanelle's dam Janina showed good racing ability, winning two of her five races including the Listed Marygate Fillies' Stakes. She was a distant female-line descendant of the British broodmare Congo (foaled 1939), who was a half-sister to Nimbus and Grey Sovereign. Racing career =2020: two-year-old season= Campanelle was equipped with blinkers when she made her track debut in a maiden race over five furlongs on the turf course at Gulfstream Park on 31 May. Ridden by Nik Juarez, and starting the 2.1/1 second choice in an eight-runner field, she took a narrow lead on the inside soon after the start and drew away in the closing stages to win by three and a half lengths. In June Campanelle was sent to England to contest the Group 2 Queen Mary Stakes at the Royal Ascot meeting which took place behind closed doors owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ward had an exceptional record at the meeting, having trained ten winners beginning with Strike The Tiger's victory in the 2009 Windsor Castle Stakes. She started the 9/2 second favourite behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained More Beautiful and was partnered by Frankie Dettori. The 20/1 outsider Sardinia Sunset set the pace before giving way to Sacred but Campanelle gained the advantage inside the final furlong and \\"kept on well\\" to win by three quarters of a length. Travel restrictions meant that Ward had remained in Florida, leaving the conditioning of his Ascot runners to Dettori and Kieren Fallon. He commented \\"I had such high expectations for this filly. For her to come through in the biggest 2-year-old fillies' race at Ascot proves how good she really is\\" while Dettori said \\"She went as straight as a gun barrel and won very well. I was in the stalls for a very long time and she jumped a bit slow after losing concentration. She had plenty left two furlongs out and quickened very well. She's got a very sensible racing head\\". On 23 August at Deauville Racecourse in France Campanelle (racing without blinkers) was stepped up to Group 1 class and matched against male opponents in the Prix Morny over 1200 metres on soft ground. With Dettori again in the saddle she started the 1.7/1 favourite against eight opponents including Tactical (winner of the July Stakes), Cairn Gorm (Prix de Cabourg), Livachope (Prix du Bois) and Nando Parrado (Coventry Stakes). Racing down the centre of the track, Campanelle led soon after the start and pulled clear in the closing stages to win by two lengths and a neck from Nando Parrado and Rhythm Master. Commenting on the fact that he would have to go into quarantine on his return to England, Dettori said \\"I've filled my car with wine, baguettes and cheese and I'm going to travel through the night, get my test tomorrow and lock myself in the house for a week\\" and added of the winner \\"She's got an amazing, long stride. She coped with this ground but she's much better on good. I was worried about it but class comes through... she's able to listen to my commands. When I told her to slow down, she did, and when I asked her to quicken, she quickened. She's a very, very smart two-year-old\\".

The reserve is also listed as a Special Area of Conservation. The name Deputy's Pass is derived from the Battle of Deputy's Pass, during which the English army cut a pass through the woodland. The woodland at Deputy's Pass was originally a coppice, and would have been part of the larger Glenealy oak woods. The woods are composed of sessile oak, holly, hazel, birch and beech, with an under planting of wood sorrel, blueberry, bilberry, and woodrush. The Potter River runs through the site, with fauna that include kestrels, wrens, smooth newts and common frogs. There is a 2km walking trail within the reserve.

Piero Hugon was the first page of the bedchamber and trusted servant of Anne of Denmark, the wife of King James. He travelled to the Danish court for her in 1618.Acts of the Privy Council: 1618-1619 (London, 1929), p. 57. He was described as \\"her creature and favourite\\", and according to a letter describing the queen's last days, \\"Pira, and the Dutch woman that serves her\\" were her closest attendants, excluding other courtiers.Miscellany of the Abbotsford Club, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1837), p. 81 George Villiers, Marquess of Buckingham promised to protect the late queen's page After Anne of Denmark's funeral in May 1619, Piero Hugon and a \\"Dutch\\" servant called Anna were accused of theft. This Anna may have been the Danish \\"Anna Kaas\\" who had served the queen since her first days in Scotland.Ethel Carleton Williams, Anne of Denmark (London, 1970), p. 203: Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 373.John Nichols, Progresses of James First, vol. 3 (London, 1828), p. 531. It is however possible that the accused woman, the \\"Dutch maid Anna\\", was Hugon's wife, who was German and also called Anne.Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 240. The theft was discovered by one of the goldsmiths who supplied jewels to the queen, either William Herrick or George Heriot.Maureen M. Meikle & Helen M. Payne, 'From Lutheranism to Catholicism: The Faith of Anna of Denmark (1574-1619)', Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 64:1 (2013), p. 66 citing Thomas Birch & Folkestone Williams, Court and Times of James the First, vol. 2 (London, 1849), p. 167, and Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 240. Anna and Piero were taken to the Tower of London and charged with stealing jewels worth ¬£30,000.Norman McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 240: Jemma Field, 'Anna of Denmark and the Politics of Religious Identity' in Northern Studies, 50 (2019), p. 107. James Howell heard rumours and wrote, \\"Q. Anne left a world of brave jewels behind, but one Piero, an outlandish man, who had the keeping of them, embezelled many, and is run away.\\"Joseph Jacobs, Epistolae Ho-Elianae: the familiar letters of James Howell, vol. 1 (London, 1892), p. 105. Piero Hugon had powerful supporters, soon after the arrest, at Greenwich, the Marquess of Buckingham promised Fran√ßois Juvenal, Marquis de Traisnel, who had come to offer the French king's condolences to James, that he would protect Hugon. The Marquis wrote to Buckingham that Louis XIII was convinced of his innocence.HMC Duke of Portland, vol. 1 (London, 1891), pp. 23-4 Buckingham and Robert Naunton corresponded with the English ambassador in Paris, Sir Edward Herbert and his brother Henry Herbert.Nigel Bawcutt, 'Evidence and Conjecture in Literary Scholarship: The Case of Sir John Astley Reconsidered', English Literary Renaissance, 22:3 (Autumn 1992), pp. 333-346, 344 quoting BL Harley 1581 f.107. Another French ambassador Fran√ßois de Bassompierre, Count of Tilli√®res, tried to help Hugon. A draft letter written in answer to Tilli√®res gives more detail of the accusations and proceedings. King James ordered a chest confiscated in Paris from Hugon to be given to Mr (Henry) Herbert, the brother of Sir Edward Herbert, and Hugo was compensated with ¬£500. The missing jewels were worth ¬£60,000. Hugon was also accused of sending the queen's money and some religious items after her death to a nunnery and to some Jesuits to pray for her soul. These accusations were not sent to Tilli√®res, after Hugon was interrogated in the Tower and he made a deal or bargain.Historical Manuscripts Commission, 10th Report: Report on the Manuscripts of C S H Drummond Moray (London, 1885), pp. 113-4, this letter is now in National Archives of Scotland GD24/1/825. Hugon became the proprietor of Fourchaud Edward Herbert discovered that the brother of Louis Richard, one of the queen's musicians, had carried packages to France for Hugon. Herbert made an inventory of two chests belonging to Hugon, and the contents were thought to include some of the queen's jewels.Sidney Lee, The Autobiography of Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury (London, 1886), p. 343. He was concerned by various Catholic items he saw. There were many items of jewelry and costume, silverware, a bracelet set with turquoises and diamonds, and two bezoar stones. Attached to a string of pearls was Hugon's note that Anne of Denmark had given them to him on his wedding day with a large diamond, and the pearls should be sold and the proceeds used to say Masses for the queen. Marie de' Medici became involved, who declared via Pierre Br√ªlart, marquis de Sillery, Viscount Puisieux, that she had always been well-disposed to the service of the late queen Anne. Puisieux believed that Hugon was detained in England by the Spanish-favouring faction at court.Morris Charles Jones, 'Old Herbert Papers at Powis Castle and the British Museum: Inventory of things found in the two trunks of Pierre Hugon', Collections Historical and Archeological Relating to Montgomeryshire and Its Borders, vol. 20 (London, 1886), pp. 100-1, 106, 226-7, 230-2, 242, 247-9, 251, the inventory is now British Library MS Add. 7082, ff. 46-54. Maureen Meikle and Helen Payne propose that Hugon had become a significant figure in the queen's household after the departure of Jean Drummond, Countess of Roxburghe. Assuming that many or most of the items in the inventory had belonged to the queen, including Catholic items, they suggest that Anne of Denmark had asked him to take them away to prevent their discovery, although the outcome was the exact opposite. Hugon's confession that money was intended to found a monastery in France ought to be taken as evidence for the queen's Catholic faith.Maureen M. Meikle & Helen M. Payne, 'From Lutheranism to Catholicism: The Faith of Anna of Denmark (1574-1619)', Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 64:1 (2013), pp. 66-9, for a letter describing Hugon's confession, see TNA SP14/110/10. Piero Hugon was ennobled in France in 1618 and became the Sieur de Fourchaud, Givry, le Breuil et la Fouresthile. He had married Anne Rumler, who was probably a sister of Anne of Denmark's German-born apothecary, John Wolfgang Rumler. They were both naturalized as denizens of England on 4 May 1618.William Arthur Shaw, Letters of Denization and Acts of Naturalization for Aliens in England and Ireland (Lymington, 1911), p. 25, the signet bills dated 28 October 1617 Anne attended the funeral of Anne of Denmark, listed as \\"Mrs Ann Rubellow\\" with the ladies of the Privy Chamber.John Nichols, Progresses of James First, vol. 3 (London, 1828), p. 541.See Helen Margaret Payne, 'Aristocratic Women and the Jacobean Court, 1603-1625 ', Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, PhD (2001), p. 280 for a list of the queen's women. 'Anne Rumler' was a chamberer. Hugon chose an armorial reflecting his service to the queen of England, which can be seen above a fireplace at Fourchaud.Raymond Colas, Ch√¢teaux en Bourbonnais (Moulins, 1983), p. 24. He had further dealings with the Richard brothers in 1620.Documents du Minutier central concernant de la musique, 1600-1650, vol. 1 (Paris, 1968), pp. 271-2. Anne Hugon died in 1661 aged 85 at Fourchaud and was buried at Besson. Shortly before her death she renounced the Lutheran faith of her birth. Their eldest son and heir was Gaspard Hugon.X.

White grew up in a musical family in Tyneside, where she learned to play the piano, guitar, clarinet and tenor saxophone. Her musical influences included Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and musical theatre.  World War II  White joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service during World War II, when she was 17, and played saxophone with a British army band on many ceremonial occasions, including the 1946 Victory Parade. She also travelled to entertain troops in the Central Mediterranean Force in Palestine and Egypt.  After World War II  After the war, White trained as a physiotherapist at Newcastle on Tyneside, and worked with children who had cerebral palsy. She acted, directed, painted scenery and composed music for productions at the People's Theatre in Newcastle before moving to Ontario, Canada, for 18 months, where she joined the Roman Catholic Church. White returned to England in 1965 and became a nun, taking temporary vows with the Corpus Christi Carmelite Sisters. She trained at Digby Stuart College in Roehampton and qualified to teach theology and music. White's first hymns were composed during her years as a nun; some were published or copyrighted under the name \\"Sister Estelle,\\" though most were published under the name \\"Estelle White.\\"  1970 - 2011  White left the convent in 1970 and taught in Catholic schools in the north of England until she retired. She also wrote articles for the Guardian newspaper and various women's magazines. During this time, she studied Hebrew and Greek, earning an MA with Distinction from Leeds University in 1989. She directed the church choir at St Josephs, Dewsbury, from 1984 until 1991. White's most controversial hymn, Autumn Days, received newspaper coverage in 1996 when choir members of the 12th-century St. Mary's Church in Wroxham, Norfolk, walked out rather than sing the hymn. They found the reference to \\"jet planes meeting in air to be refuelled,\\" to be inappropriate. White explained that she had written the hymn for the children at a school under a flight path to sing. Many of White's compositions were published by McCrimmon Publishing Company. Her compositions include:  Hymns  *And He Listens with His Hands *As Bread My Lord Comes to Me *Autumn Days *Breath of God O Holy Spirit *'Cheep' Said the Sparrow on the Chimney Top *Christ is Our King *Come to the North *Deep Calls to Deep *Gentle as Silence/Oh the Love of My Lord is the Essence *Give Me Peace O Lord I Pray *Grace *Harvey *He Came to Open the Eyes of the Blind *He is the LIght of the World *I Can See Across the Square *I Give My Hands *I Love the Warmth of the Sun *I Mustn't Forget *I Saw the Grass I Saw the Trees *In the Earth the Small Seed *In the Love of God and Neighbor *It is the Living Spirit *January Brings the Snow *Like a Sea Without a Shore *Little Boy Don't Delay *Lonely Hills, Tarn and Fell *Melissa Comes Into the Ward *Moses I Know You're the Man *Of One That is So Fair and Bright *Oh the Love of My Lord is the Essence/Gentle as Silence *Our Father *People of God *Perfect Face *Put Your Trust in the Man Who Tamed the Sea *Take the Other Way My Brother *There is a World *They Were Beating as He Dragged Himself *Trust is in the Eyes of a Tiny Babe *Walk With Me O My Lord *When I was a Child I Walked in the Sunlight *You Can't Climb a River  Masses  *Mass for Our Time *Mass for Young People *Mass of the Spirit  See also:  *Estelle White (1925-2011): An Introduction to Her Life and Hymns by Veronica Whitty  References  Category:British female composers Category:1925 births Category:2011 deaths Category:World War II ","title":"Estelle White"},{"id":"65271620","text":"Strange Timez is a song by British virtual band Gorillaz featuring Robert Smith.

Most wanted With regard to capturing Deeria Guure, the British stated that \\"no guarantee of any kind as to ... future treatment being given\\", insinuates the intent of retribution on the part of the British government and a high priority for capture. Role In terms of his position among the dervishes, a report in 1903 in the Evening Express states that his role was equivalent to the commander of the Royal Engineers, whom in 1903 happened to be Richard Harrison. This report also states he was a veteran of the Gumburru battle. It also states Diiriye Guure was the tribal chief or head of the Dhulbahante tribe. This means Diirye Guure in 1899 became the replacement for Garad Ali IV who was the former garaad (tribal chief) of the Dhulbahante garaadship. However this didn't happen until the Dhulbahante farah Garad were split at the turn of the 20th century, during a disagreement wherein Garad Ali IV wanted to maintain the monarchy whereas the darawiish disagreed; the subsequent assassination of Garad Ali meant the darawiish consisted exclusively of the Ali Geri confederation of clans, i.e. Ali Geri and Arale Mahad.

In 1937, the company president, David Karger, was reported as receiving an annual salary of $24,000 (). In 1952 Eagle was awarded a Federal contract worth more than $250,000 to produce wool mufflers. The company was sold in 1963 to Zwicker Knitting Mills in 1963. The plant in Milwaukee was finally closed in 1991. The main factory building was added to the Wisconsin State Register of Historic Places on August 14, 2020.

History  The road was formed at the end of the 19th century from the Bolshoy Alma-Ata stanitsa to the Kargalinsky highway, later along the Small Almaty gorge in connection with its economic development. On the avenue, lined with pyramidal poplars and partially landscaped sidewalks, the main buildings and structures of Verny were: Gostiny Dvor, public meeting, post office and a telegraph; in the mountains there were mills, kruporushki, a brewery and a candle factory, a hospital, summer cottages. The street was named Kolpakovsky () which was in honor of the Russian general, one of the main figures in the conquest of Central Asia. After the establishment of Soviet power, the city council was visited by Mikhail Kalinin and the first party and public organizations of the city were created. In 1919, the street was renamed to Lenin Avenue. In 1970, during the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Lenin, the memorial building of Lenin Avenue was completed. The district of the region, located in the southeastern one, is a link between the urban development and the surrounding mountain landscape, the city center and the zones of mass recreation for residents in the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau was the new sports complex Medeu.

Early years (1858‚Äì1882) Charles Adolphe Marie Liebrechts was born in Antwerp on 7 May 1858. His parents were Fran√ßois Liebrechts and Marie Huybrechts. At the age of 16 he enlisted in the army. He became a soldier in the 3rd chasseurs √† pied. He entered the Military School in 1876, specializing in artillery and engineering. In 1881 he was appointed second lieutenant of artillery in the 5th regiment. King Leopold II of Belgium decided that that his Force Publique in the Congo, still publicly seen as part of the International African Association, needed an artillery man. He asked General Nicaise to find the best candidate, and at the end of 1882 the general recommended Liebrechts, who was given instructions by the king in person. Congo (1883‚Äì1889) On 7 March 1883 Lieutenant Liebechts embarked in Liverpool on the Biafra with two batteries of mountain artillery. He transported the guns to the upper Congo River. In L√©opoldville he found Henry Morton Stanley organizing a large expedition to found two new posts. He joined the expedition with one of his pieces, a Krupp cannon. In Bolobo Stanley resolved a dispute between the staff of the station and a local chief, then gave command to Liebrechts. The local people wanted the Europeans to leave, and in November 1883 burned down the station's buildings. A flotilla under Edmond Hanssens left L√©opoldville on 23 March 1884. The expedition reach Bolobo on 3 April 1884, where lieutenant Liebrechts had now formed a good relationship with the Bayanzi. They continued upstream, founded the N'Gandu post and made treaties with the chiefs along the river. On 11 November 1884 Hanssens again left L√©opoldville for √âquateur in an expedition with three steamers: the Royal, A.I.A. and En Avant. The members included Guillaume Casman, Liebrechts and Camille Van den Plas. They stopped at Kimpoko to embark Edde Gleerup, who had been appointed second to Arvid Wester at the Falls. On 24 November 1884 they reached Msuata, where Liebrechts stayed, and where they met and Attilio P√©cile, of the French mission, who were going by canoe to the Alima. In 1885 Liebrechts was given command of the Equateur station. Liebrechts left the Congo on leave in June 1886. On 2 February 1887 he left Antwerp to return to the Congo. He was in charge of the strategic center of L√©opoldville, from which all of the upper Congo was supplied. He was active in developing the station and the port infrastructure. Liebrechts (center) in L√©opoldville, 1887 Stanley arrived in L√©opoldville with the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition, and Liebrechts managed to provide him with the steamers he needed. He then devoted himself to organizing the workshops, slipway, stores and supply of the station. In March 1888 the shipyards launched by Roi des Belges for the Compagnie du Congo pour le Commerce et l'Industrie. In October 1888 the Ville de Bruxelles was launched, a 35-ton steamer with a wooden hull made from timber from the Lukolela forest. On 27 October 1888 Liebrechts was appointed district commissioner 1st class. He left L√©opoldville on 17 March 1889 and arrived in Brussels in May 1899. Central administration (1889‚Äì1909) Liebrechts joined the colony's central administration in Belgium and was put in charge of the Interior Division of the Congo Free State under governor general Camille Janssen. The department was very active in 1889‚Äì1891 in efforts to expand towards the Nile to the northeast and Katanga to the southeast. It was also involved in diplomatic work at the Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference, where Liebrechts was a technical delegate of the Congo Free State. In July 1891 he was appointed secretary general of the interior, replacing Th√©ophile Wahis, who became vice-governor of the Congo. His promotion must have been due to the influence of Secretary of State Edmond van Eetvelde, who was head of the Belgian Interior and Foreign Affairs department from 1890. Liebrechts and van Eetvelde had common views of the danger of expanding towards the Nile, which the king wanted to happen. When Van Eetvelde retired in 1898 Liebrechts gained more political influence, although the king was still in control of the departments, and would have seen Liebrechts only as a department head. During the period of the Commission of Inquiry of 1905-1906, there was some suspicion that Liebrechts was compromised with the concessionary companies, particularly the Soci√©t√© Anversoise de Commerce au Congo, of which his father-in-law was a co-founder and shareholder, and his brother Louis Liebrechts was director in Africa. Judge Marcellin De Saegher said that Louis Liebrechts was the author of several crimes against the local population, with Charles Liebrechts covering for him in Brussels. Based on the archives it seems that Liebrechts followed the king's position in generally downplaying the atrocities, but was not involved in specific cases involving his brother. On 15 November 1908 the Congo Free State was annexed by Belgium as the Belgian Congo, and Liebrecht's mandate ended. Later career (1909‚Äì1938) Before the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Liebrecht started to play a role in the business world with companies such as the Soci√©t√© commerciale et financi√®re africaine. After the war he became a director of companies such as Chemin de fer du Congo sup√©rieur aux Grands Lacs (CFL), Compagnie belge maritime du Congo, Compagnie du Kasa√Ø and John Cockerill. He was also the government's delegate to the Compagnie du Katanga and the Belgian Congo's delegate to the Chemin de fer du Bas-Congo au Katanga (BCK). In 1928 he became a full member of the Technical Sciences section of the newly formed Royal Belgian Colonial Institute. In 1933 King Albert I made him a knight. Throughout his life Liebrechts defended the Congo Free State and King L√©opold II. Liebrechts died on 14 July 1938 in Brussels.

Beginning and growth On September 7, a \\"historic fire event\\" with high winds resulted in 80 fires and nearly 300,000 acres burned. Malden, in the Palouse Country of Eastern Washington, was mostly destroyed by one of the fires. The largest fire, Cold Spring Canyon Fire in Okanogan County and Douglas Counties, was 10,000 acres on the evening of September 7 and had burned 175,000 acres by the morning of September 8. Owing to the Cold Spring Canyon Fire, the town of Mansfield was under \\"evacuate now\\" orders but all roads were closed. Smoke blanketed the Seattle area on September 8 and caused unhealthy air conditions throughout the Puget Sound region, mostly from air spilling over the Cascade Range from Eastern Washington. The smoke was noticeable in many parts of southern British Columbia, leading to air quality advisories in areas including Vancouver and Victoria. Pearl Hill Fire began when the fire jumped over 900 feet to cross the Columbia River into Bridgeport. By the evening of September 8, the Cold Springs Canyon and adjacent Pearl Hill Fires had burned over and neither was more than 10% contained. The Whitney Fire near Davenport was large by September 9, when it was 5% contained. Pearl Hill Fire was 223,730 acres and over 90% contained by September 22; together Pearl Hill and Cold Springs Fires burned over 410,000 acres.

She began to write for her hometown paper, the New Berian, and would continue to write for them until 1937. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Carraway wrote for an increasing number of publications, including the Sun- Journal, Raleigh Times, The New York Times, Associated Press, and Christian Science Monitor, under the name G. S. Carraway. She wrote on both local and international topics. DAR membership Carraway's articles on local history gained the attention of Edwin C Gregory, whose wife, Mary Margret Gregory, was DAR North Carolina State Regent (1925‚Äì1928). Once they realized that the Carraway was a woman, Mary encouraged her to join the DAR. Carraway immediately became the State Publicity Committee Chairman.

Early life and education  Harris was born and raised in Mississippi. He was at school for the end of segregation, and eventually studied electrical engineering at the University of Mississippi. He earned his undergraduate degree in 1973, and moved to the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) for his graduate work. Harris eventually earned his master's and doctoral degrees at CalTech. During his doctoral research, Harris became conscious that he was the only African-American student. After earning his doctorate, Harris worked in both the communications and petroleum industries. This included three years at COMSAT, followed by four years at both Exxon and Standard Oil of Ohio (SOHIO).  Research and career  In 1988 Harris joined Stanford University, where he established the Stanford Wave Physics Lab. The Stanford Wave Physics Lab investigate the physics of seismic and electromagnetic waves in complex media. During his tenure at Stanford Harris served as Chair of the Department of Geophysics. In 2006 he founded the Center for Computational Earth and Environmental Science, a research partnership between the Stanford School of Earth Sciences and Computer Science Laboratory. He was named the Cecil and Ida Green Professor at Stanford University in 2008. Harris primarily specialised in Crosswell seismic imaging; which can be used to produce high-resolution large scale images, an order of magnitude better than those produced by conventional seismic surveys. Images with such extraordinary resolution are important for reservoir management. Harris developed the sources for Crosswell data acquisition, including piezoelectric sources and low frequency pneumatic vibrators. Beyond Crosswell imaging, Harris studied the surface attenuation of seismic waves. To do this, Harris developed acoustic resonance spectroscopy, which could measure the Q factors of small sample rocks in the laboratory. = Academic service = Harris dedicated his career to improving diversity within geoscience research and industry. In 2000 he founded the Summer Undergraduate Research in Geoscience and Engineering (SURGE) programme, which supports minority students who are considering careers in the earth sciences. Over ninety percent of SURGE graduates went on to have careers in the earth sciences. In 2014 he partnered with the University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Los Angeles and CalTech to launch the California Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate; a consortium that looks to recruit more minority graduate students and faculty members.

Michael Palin and Joe Mantegna, appear in the episode as Museum Curator and Gordus Antonius, respectively. The episode features the Simpson family learning about ancient Rome. It received generally positive reviews from critics, and watched live in the United States by 1.51 million viewers.  Plot  While the Simpson family visit a museum exhibit on Ancient Rome, Marge chastises a bored Homer for his lack of ambition when he admits to shirking chances for promotion. The curator overhears the squabble and begins to relay the tale of Obeseus the Wide (played by Homer), the son of a poor farmer. While years of toil make Obeseus strong, his father Abus (played by Grampa Simpson) sells him to the slaver Gordus Antonius (played by Fat Tony) who puts Obeseus in the gladiatorial fighting pits. Here Obeseus catches the eye of his master's daughter Marjora (played by Marge) who falls pregnant to him. When her father demands the slave who impregnated his daughter to reveal themselves, Obeseus is freed from slavery to marry her and given his former slave friends as a gift. Obeseus runs a clothes cleaning business for years, which he ultimately runs into the ground through his own indolence. When the ambitious Marjora tells him to get his act together, Obeseus' slave friends suggest gathering ammonia by placing pots near drinking establishments. Obeseus gains fame, only for Marjora to push her husband into joining the senate to raise their status further. Obeseus' request is laughed off by Emperor Quimbus (played by Mayor Quimby), but his politically adopted son Senator Montimus (played by Mr. Burns) offers Obeseus a position in the senate if he assassinates Quimbus. Over the next decade their status grows more, but Marjora wants more power and instigates the assassination of Emperor Montimus to put her own son Bartigula (played by Bart) on the throne. Bartigula goes mad with power and declares himself a god, but a now corpulent Obeseus challenges his son. The ensuing fight results in their deaths, horrifying Marjora to the point of suicide.

The United States withdrew from the Olympics, and Cooper thought the network didn't want a show with a Russian star, so CBS executive Robert A. Daly cancelled it.Hal Cooper Chapter 4, DGA.org, Retrieved 9 September 2020 The show originally been intended to run as complimentary to the upcoming Olympics, and to have debuted in January 1980. Lohman got the Russian athlete role (which CBS was finding hard to cast) because Marge Glucksman in casting at CBS had seen his audition for Trapper John, M.D., and Lohman was able to do the accent because he had many Ukrainian and Russian relatives. According to Lohman, CBS executive William S. Paley loved the show, and intended to use it as a possible replacement for The Jeffersons, but the Olympic boycott delayed the show's debut.Leszczak, Bob.

Her application was sent to the New Hampshire Supreme Court to determine if a woman could hold this title. Newhall argued before the court pro se. The Court ruled that although there was not a constitutional bar to appointing women to this office, legislation first needed to be passed to allow it. In response, Newhall drafted the appropriate legislation and successfully lobbied for its passage in 1929. In February of that year, Newhall was the first woman to be appointed Justice of the Peace in New Hampshire, by Governor Charles W. Tobey and the New Hampshire Executive Council.

Impressed by the young man's playing, Karajan persuaded Sonoda to study in Germany and wrote him a letter of recommendation. After his studies there, Sonoda debuted with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in 1959. The following year he returned to Japan, becoming a professor at the Kyoto City University of Arts. In his later years he became part of the faculty at the Sh≈çwa Academia Musicae. Although admired for his performances of works by German classics such as Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms, Sonoda maintained a keen interest in modern music. He was a member of the Sh≈´z≈ç Takiguchi-led Experimental Studio, along with friends T≈çru Takemitsu and Toshir≈ç Mayuzumi. In 1971 he premiered Makoto Moroi's Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. When the Sh≈çwa Emperor died on January 7, 1989, NHK General TV followed their announcement of his passing by broadcasting Sonoda's recording of Chopin's Funeral March. He was awarded the title of Person of Cultural Merit by the Japanese government in 1998. He died in 2004 from an aortic aneurysm while preparing for a forthcoming concert.

Public perception of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Religion, folklore and mythology There is evidence of prehistoric bear worship, though this is disputed by archaeologists. It is possible that bear worship existed in early Chinese and Ainu cultures. The prehistoric Finns, Siberian peoples and more recently Koreans considered the bear as the spirit of their forefathers. In many Native American cultures, the bear is a symbol of rebirth because of its hibernation and re-emergence. The image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in North America and Eurasia, based on the female's devotion and protection of her cubs.Ward and Kynaston, pp. 12‚Äì13 Japanese folklore features the Onikuma, a \\"demon bear\\" that walks upright. The Ainu of northern Japan, a different people from the Japanese, saw the bear instead as sacred; Hirasawa Byozan painted a scene in documentary style of a bear sacrifice in an Ainu temple, complete with offerings to the dead animal's spirit. In Korean mythology, a tiger and a bear prayed to Hwanung, the son of the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort, ordering them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince. The bear-woman (Ungnyeo; ÏõÖÎÖÄ/) was grateful and made offerings to Hwanung. However, she lacked a husband, and soon became sad and prayed beneath a \\"divine birch\\" tree () to be blessed with a child. Hwanung, moved by her prayers, took her for his wife and soon she gave birth to a son named Dangun Wanggeom ‚Äì who was the legendary founder of Gojoseon, the first ever Korean kingdom. Artio (Dea Artio in the Gallo-Roman religion) was a Celtic bear goddess. Evidence of her worship has notably been found at Bern, itself named for the bear. Her name is derived from the Celtic word for \\"bear\\", artos. In ancient Greece, archaic cult of Artemis in bear form survived into Classical times at Brauron, where young Athenian girls passed an initiation right as arktai \\"she bears\\".Burkert, Walter, Greek Religion, 1985:263. For Artemis and one of her nymphs as a she- bear, see the myth of Callisto. Bears are mentioned in the Bible; the Second Book of Kings relates the story of the prophet Elisha calling on them to eat the youths who taunted him.Second Book of Kings, 2:23‚Äì25 Legends of saints taming bears are common in the Alpine zone. In the arms of the bishopric of Freising, the bear is the dangerous totem animal tamed by St. Corbinian and made to carry his civilized baggage over the mountains. Bears similarly feature in the legends of St. Romedius, Saint Gall and Saint Columbanus. This recurrent motif was used by the Church as a symbol of the victory of Christianity over paganism. In the Norse settlements of northern England during the 10th century, a type of \\"hogback\\" grave cover of a long narrow block of stone, with a shaped apex like the roof beam of a long house, is carved with a muzzled, thus Christianized, bear clasping each gable end, as in the church at Brompton, North Yorkshire and across the British Isles. LƒÅƒçplƒìsis, meaning \\"Bear-slayer\\", is a Latvian legendary hero who is said to have killed a bear by ripping its jaws apart with his bare hands. However, as revealed in the end of the long epic describing his life, LƒÅƒçplƒìsis' own mother had been a she-bear, and his superhuman strength resided in his bear ears. The modern Latvian military award Order of LƒÅƒçplƒìsis, called for the hero, is also known as The Order of the Bear-Slayer. In the Hindu epic poem The Ramayana, the sloth bear or Asian black bear Jambavan is depicted as the king of bears and helps the title hero Rama defeat the epic's antagonist Ravana and reunite with his queen Sita.Patricia Turner, Charles Russell Coulter. Dictionary of ancient deities. 2001, page 248 In French folklore, Jean de l'Ours is a hero born half-bear, half-human. He obtains a weapon, usually a heavy iron cane, and on his journey, bands up with two or three companions. At a castle the hero defeats an adversary, pursues him to a hole, discovers an underworld, and rescues three princesses. The companions abandon him in the hole, taking the princesses for themselves. The hero escapes, finds the companions and gets rid of them. He marries the most beautiful princess of the three, but not before going through certain ordeal(s) by the king. National and regional symbolism The Persian Cat, British Lion and Russian Bear in the Anglo-Russian Entente of 1907 Bears, like other animals, may symbolize nations. In 1911, the British satirical magazine Punch published a cartoon about the Anglo-Russian Entente by Leonard Raven-Hill in which the British lion watches as the Russian bear sits on the tail of the Persian cat. The Russian Bear has been a common national personification for Russia from the 16th century onward. Smokey Bear has become a part of American culture since his introduction in 1944, with his message \\"Only you can prevent forest fires\\". In the United Kingdom, the bear and staff feature on the heraldic arms of the county of Warwickshire. Bears appear in the canting arms of two cities, Bern and Berlin. In Finland, the brown bear, which is also nicknamed as the \\"king of the forest\\" by the Finns, is even so common that it is the country's official national mammal,https://finland.fi/life-society/iconic-finnish- nature-symbols-stand-out/ ICONIC FINNISH NATURE SYMBOLS STAND OUT and occur on the coat of arms of the Satakunta region is a crown-headed black bear carrying a sword,Iltanen, Jussi: Suomen kuntavaakunat (2013), Karttakeskus, possibly referring to the regional capital city of Pori, whose Swedish name Bj√∂rneborg and the Latin name Arctopolis literally means \\"bear city\\" or \\"bear fortress\\".https://memphismagazine.com/travel/savoring-heritage/ Savoring Heritage: A Memphis Writer explores her daughter's Finnish roots. In Madrid, Spain, the east side of the Puerta del Sol has the Statue of the Bear and the Strawberry Tree, the statue is created by sculptor Antonio Navarro Santaf√© and inaugurated on 19 January 1967. It presents a bear supports his paws on the strawberry tree and directs his attention towards one of the fruits, a real- life form the coat of arms of Madrid. Literature and media Bears are popular in children's stories, including Winnie the Pooh, Paddington Bear, Gentle Ben and \\"The Brown Bear of Norway\\". An early version of \\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\\", was published as \\"The Three Bears\\" in 1837 by Robert Southey, many times retold, and illustrated in 1918 by Arthur Rackham. The Hanna-Barbera character Yogi Bear has appeared in numerous comic books, animated television shows and films. The Care Bears began as greeting cards in 1982, and were featured as toys, on clothing and in film. Around the world, many children‚Äîand some adults‚Äîhave teddy bears, stuffed toys in the form of bears, named after the American statesman Theodore Roosevelt when in 1902 he had refused to shoot an American black bear tied to a tree. Cosmology The constellation of Ursa Major as depicted in Urania's Mirror, c. 1825 The constellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the great and little bears, are named for their supposed resemblance to bears, from the time of Ptolemy. The nearby star Arcturus means \\"guardian of the bear\\", as if it were watching the two constellations. Ursa Major has been associated with a bear for as much as 13,000 years since Paleolithic times, in the widespread Cosmic Hunt myths. These are found on both sides of the Bering land bridge, which was lost to the sea some 11,000 years ago. reviewed at Berserkers ‚Äì bear warriors It is proposed by some authors that the Old Norse warriors, the berserkers, drew their power from the bear and were devoted to the bear cult, which was once widespread across the northern hemisphere. Nioradze, Georg. \\"Der Schamanismus bei den sibirischen V√∂lkern\\", Strecker und Schr√∂der, 1925. The berserkers maintained their religious observances despite their fighting prowess, as the Svarfd√¶la saga tells of a challenge to single-combat that was postponed by a berserker until three days after Yule. The bodies of dead berserkers were laid out in bearskins prior to their funeral rites.Danielli, M, \\"Initiation Ceremonial from Norse Literature\\", Folk-Lore, v56, 1945 pp. 229‚Äì45. The bear- warrior symbolism survives to this day in the form of the bearskin caps worn by the guards of the Danish monarchs.

Its name means \\"Gate of the Tanners\\" and refers to the nearby tanneries which have been present here since the Almoravid period. It has the most complicated layout of any gate in the city: its passage bends 5 times, in an almost S-like path, passing through two open-air courts and one covered chamber. A staircase in the southeastern corner of the structure grants access to the roof of the gate.

Born into humble circumstances in a predominantly rural area of the country bordering Brazil, she was orphaned before her first birthday. Silva was raised by her mother's employer and received an education. In 1946, she became the first Afro-Uruguayan to earn a teaching degree. She taught in rural schools and raised two daughters as a single mother, despite sexist attitudes prevalent against women at the time. Wanting to further her education, she moved to Montevideo in 1956, but was transferred numerous times as a result of racial discrimination and returned home to Artigas. Filing a complaint with the National Council of Primary Education led to wide media coverage of her treatment and brought to light the divide in the country between official policy of equality and equality in practice. In 1960, Silva took an examination and became the first person of African descent in Uruguay to serve as a primary school inspector. She worked as an inspector in various departments and taught both high school and normal school courses through the 1970s. She also volunteered as a teacher for students with learning disabilities, boarders in care homes, and prisoners at the local jail. In 1981, she earned a journalism degree and retired from teaching. Embarking on a second career as a writer, Silva traveled widely, published a textbook on chemistry, and earned several awards as a poet. She died in 2004 and is remembered for her role in changing the perception of freedom and equality in Uruguay. Early life Born on 3 April 1925 in Artigas, Uruguay, Adelia Silva was the illegitimate daughter of the live-in domestic servant of Julia Bianchi. Silva never knew her father, and her mother was a dependent of the Bianchi family under the patr√≥n system that existed after slavery was abolished in Uruguay. Silva's mother died when she was nine months old and she was raised by Bianchi. She attended Escuela N¬∫ 1 de ni√±as (Girls' School #1) from 1931 to 1937 and then attended high school at the Liceo Departamental (Departmental Lyceum) from 1938 to 1942. Continuing her education at the Instituto Normal de Artigas (Normal School of Artigas), she received a teaching diploma. In 1946, she passed her examinations in Montevideo, becoming the first Uruguayan of African descent to obtain a teaching certification. Career =Teaching (1948‚Äì1979)= Silva worked as a rural teacher in the Artigas, Canelones, Colonia, and Florida Departments. During this period, she had a brief marriage with F√©lix C√©sar Sosa with whom she had a daughter, Luz Marina Sosa. She adopted another daughter, Marta, and raised the girls as a single mother at a time when most women were economically dependent on their spouse. Though she struggled to support them, Silva believed that women had a right to be educated and independent. By the mid-1950s, despite experiencing prevalent sexism and racial discrimination, she had become principal of a rural school in Artigas. Convinced that education was the only way to overcome prejudice and the disdain of her colleagues, in 1956, Silva enrolled in advanced teaching courses at the Instituto Magisterial Superior (Higher Magisterial Institute) of Montevideo. Her attendance was made possible by a federal scholarship, which provided her with student teaching employment while she attended classes. Assigned to Gran Breta√±a (Great Britain), an elementary school, when Silva arrived to teach, she was transferred to another school. As her transfer had nothing to do with her performance, she was reassigned to Public School N¬∫ 125. Principal Ofelia Ferretjans de Ugartemendia pressured her to obtain another transfer \\"because of her skin color\\". When she arrived at her third post at Public School N¬∫ 16, principal Irene Castro de Mandado told her that parents had submitted a petition for her removal, as they did not want a black woman who spoke Portu√±ol (a pidgin language combining Spanish and Portuguese, typically spoken by people living in the border area between Brazil and Uruguay) teaching their children. Demoralized by the treatment she had experienced, Silva resigned her scholarship and returned to Artigas in 1956. After discussing what happened with friends, Silva wrote a letter to the Consejo Nacional de Ense√±anza Primaria (National Council of Primary Education) and requested that they conduct an investigation into the situation. The case attracted national media attention, sparking discussion of the unequal treatment blacks received in the country, contrary to legal protections for equality. She was urged by civic groups and teachers' unions to return to Montevideo to teach, but she remained in Artigas, having returned to her rural school as principal. In 1957, the National Council of Primary Education found Ugartemendia guilty of racial discrimination, transferred her from her post, and fined her an amount equal to half of her salary for six months. The Council did not find sufficient evidence to confirm discrimination by Mandado, who was allowed to keep her job. In 1960, Silva took an examination that enabled her to become the first person of African descent in Uruguay to serve as a primary school inspector. In 1962, she was assigned the post of school zone inspector for the Artigas, Florida, and Salto Departments. During this time, she taught secondary school courses in chemistry, physics, and French at the Liceo N¬∫ 1 and Colegio de las Hermanas Carmelitas (Carmelite Sisters High School). She also taught history of education, pedagogy, psychology, and sociology at the Instituto de Formaci√≥n Docente de Artigas (Teacher Training Institute of Artigas) and volunteered as a tutor for students with learning disabilities and for boarders at the Hogar Rural de Varones (Rural Home for Boys) and inmates at the Centro Carcelario (Central Prison) in Artigas. =Writing (1981‚Äì2001)= After several years of traveling back and forth between Artigas and Montevideo, Silva completed her studies earning a diploma in journalism in 1981. She retired as a teacher and began a second career as a writer. She traveled three times to Europe, visiting France, Monaco, Spain, Switzerland, and the Vatican. Wherever she traveled she made extensive notes for later reflection and wrote poetry in Spanish and Italian. Her skill with languages was self-taught, but she learned to read English, French, and Italian, using dictionaries and evaluating the context of the words. In 1985, she was awarded the Diploma de Honor del c√≠rculo de artes y letras (Diploma of Honor of the Circle of Arts and Letters) by the √Ångel Falco literary group. In Artigas that year, Semana del Libro (Book Week), an event she helped found and popularize, was named \\"Maestra Adelia Silva\\" in her honor. In 1987, her colleagues from the local high school financed the publication of a book Silva co-wrote with Mary Suarez de Simon, a fellow teacher, Hacia el siglo XXI con la qu√≠mica en acci√≥n (Towards the 21st Century with Chemistry in Action). Wanting to further her knowledge, she completed a diploma in public relations in 1993. In 2000, Silva was selected as Uruguay's representative to the Teleconference of Latin American Poets. She was awarded the \\"Rocco Certo\\" prize of the Sicilian Chamber of Commerce for a poem written in Italian from the Italian Society of San Jos√© in 2001. Death and legacy Plaque at the Monumento al Maestro in Artigas. Silva died on 10 July 2004 in Artigas from complications of severe asthma. In her teaching career she had influenced hundreds of students, having taught them to question not only who they wanted to be, but their impact on others. Her struggle to excel and overcome the problems of sexism and racism helped to bring about a shift in the perception of freedom and equality in Uruguay.

This canyon holds pools of rainwater which provide a vital source of water for resident bighorn sheep.Scott Turner, \\"Hike the Parks: Zion & Bryce Canyon National Parks\\", 2019, The Mountaineers Books. This feature's name was officially adopted in 1935 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The descriptive name stems from the cliff's distinctive multitudinous check lines in cross-bedded white sandstone which give the impression of a checkerboard. The horizontal lines are caused by cross-bedding, a remnant of ancient sand dunes. The vertical and sub-vertical lines formed by the contraction and expansion of the sandstone caused by temperature changes, freezing and thawing cycles, in combination with wetting and drying. This peak was originally named Checkerboard Mountain by the park's third superintendent, Preston P. Patraw.National Park Service nps.gov/zion Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into tributaries of the Virgin River. Climate Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Checkerboard Mesa. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, it is located in a Cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C), and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer. This desert climate receives less than of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter.

The painting was the central panel of a triptych. The side panels, however, were lost during the iconoclastic fury in the summer of 1566. The scene represented in the painting stems from Chapter 12 of the Book of Revelation. It is one of Floris' most renowned works, often credited as his most famous painting.Topstukken, 2015. Floris painted it for the fencer‚Äôs guild of Antwerp, one of the city‚Äôs militias, responsible for public security. The altarpiece hung in the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp, above the guild‚Äôs altar. Like every other guild or corporation, the fencers had a patron saint, in this case, the Archangel Michael, who leads God's angels against the rebels in the painting. The painting is currently housed at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. Analysis This painting depicts a biblical battle between good and evil. The fight goes back to John 's Apocalyptic vision and symbolizes Christ's fight against evil. It‚Äôs a dense tangle of arms, legs, wings and tails. God's angel, led by Archangel Micheal, are engaging in battle with the rebellious angels, chasing the seven-headed dragon and its demons from heaven. The fallen angels are depicted as half-human, half-animal monsters, as in Bruegel's later The Fall of the Rebel Angels. In Floris, their features include curved talons, genitals like an eagle‚Äôs head, clawing hands, a head of a wild boar, and a grinning goat's head. The Archangel Michael was considered, among other things, Guardian of Paradise and Warrior against the Devil. In those functions, he might have set an example for the members of the fencer's guild (who commissioned the painting). They might have seen themselves as Milites Christiani fighting evil in the name of Jesus. This would have justified their actions as law enforcement or medieval police within the city. The angels fight with weapons used by the fencers. These are the sword, the epee and the lance. The rebellious angels use bows and arrows, hatchets, torches, knives, and pickaxes; a hodgepodge of unorthodox battle instruments. The painting shows Floris' knowledge of anatomy. Floris incorporated some subtle supplements among the writhing bodies, such as the Woman of the Apocalypse from the Book of Revelation. She is located in the small gap on the left, near the flaming torch clutched by one of the fallen angels. She stands on a crescent moon, dressed with the sun and crowned with twelve stars. The dragon wants to devour her child, but the angels are already taking it to heaven.Openbaring 12, 1-5 An eagle gives her two wings so she can escape to the desert. On the bottom left, there sits a bee. Influence Frans Floris was a symbol of Antwerp Romanism, and the first artist in the Southern Netherlands to organize his studio after an Italian model.Sandra Janssens, in Het Museumboek. Hoogtepunten uit de verzameling, 2003, p. 72. Floris was one of the many Nordic artists from the 16th century who travelled to Italy. During his stay in Rome, Floris was influenced by the work of Italian Renaissance artists Michelangelo and Raphael. Floris composition and its writhing bodies recall Michelangelo‚Äôs Last Judgement in the Sistine Chapel. The woman and the dragon, on the other hand, show similarities with the visual language of the German artist Albrecht D√ºrer. Bruegel picked up the subject in 1562 for his own The Fall of the Rebel Angels. Rubens painted his Fall of the Damned in 1620, and Luca Giordano painted his own version in 1666.

The metropolitan bishop, Nicetius of Trier, was certainly in attendance. Theudebald apparently convoked the council because Nicetius had begun excommunicating Frankish aristocrats who contracted marriages within the prohibited degree of consanguinity. The king wished to obtain a judgement against the metropolitan and a reversal of the excommunications.

He was educated at San Jacinto High School in Texas, where he won the 1958 National High School Oratorical Contest. Career Upon earning his PhD, Nathans accepted a faculty appointment in Duke University's history department. He published his first book in 1973 titled Daniel Webster and Jacksonian Democracy through the Johns Hopkins University Press. The book focused on the establishment of the political party Whig and one of its founders, Daniel Webster. In 1978, Nathans travelled across Alabama to see if he could locate descendants of enslaved African Americans in order to gain a better understanding of the Great Migration. There, he encountered Alice Hargress, whose story he based his book on titled A Mind to Stay: White Plantation, Black Homeland. Hargress described the migration of 114 black slaves from North Carolina to a 1600-acre plantation in Alabama where they eventually purchased their freedom. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1980 to assist in his research. In 1984, Nathans edited the University of North Carolina Press and NC Division of Archives and History five-volume series The Way We Lived in North Carolina, which received the American Historical Association's James Harvey Robinson Prize.

Its purpose was to promote the production of plays in villages, develop the arts in country areas, encourage playwrighting and offer the opportunity for historical and literary study. Kelly House, Kelly, Devon where Mary Kelly founded the Village Drama Society Mary Kelly founded the Society after seeing how drama performed by the Kelly Players in the village of Kelly brought enjoyment to those who took part. The Society initially had its headquarters at the family home, Kelly House, though by 1924 it had moved to London. Its first president was the writer and literary critic Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch. He was succeeded by the playwright and poet Gordon Bottomley. By 1921 the Society had 40 branches in England and Wales. Kelly travelled the country promoting the Society to Women's Institutes. It continued to grow rapidly. In 1925 it had 146 branches and by the following year this had increased to 210 branches of which nine were county groups of Women's Institutes and thirteen were junior groups. In 1930 there were 400 branches with 150 affiliated to the British Drama League. The Society was run as a voluntary organisation, paid no salaries or rents in its first six years of operation and received money from donations and a grant from the Carnegie Trust for costuming. In 1928 the committee appealed in The Times for capital to buy a suitable building for the Society and for subscriptions and donations. The Society fostered drama in several ways. It published lists of plays which it recommended for village productions; these included secular, religious and children's plays. Trainers were available to help villages who needed help to mount a production. A costume cupboard stocked a wide variety of costumes from nativity to Eastern and period costumes. Local dramatists were encouraged to write plays with the purpose of promoting the many characters, traditions, speech and dialects of Britain. A playwrighting competition was also instituted. In the ninth competition in 1932 there were four classes of plays: a one act \\"thriller\\" for men; a translation of a European language play; one act plays for a few characters; and full length plays. In 1926 the Society ran a two week long summer school in Bath directed by the actress Gwen Lally. The programme included training in rehearsals, theatre production, playwrighting, lectures and performances. A second summer school in 1927, also directed by Gwen Lally, was held at the New Earswick model garden village near York and productions of classical, Shakesperian and modern plays were mounted. Two summer schools were planned in 1928, the first in Cheltenham. In 1930 the Society visited the Oberammergau Passion Play instead of holding the annual summer school. In 1931‚Äì1932 the Society amalgamated with the British Drama League. The Society's activities were to be carried out by a Village Drama Section of the League, with Mary Kelly as its secretary. The League carried on the work begun by Mary Kelly who had done much to preserve dialect in Britain and ensure flourishing rural drama.

The name is of Gaulish origin. Mapinius did not attend the Fifth Council of Orl√©ans in 549 in person, but he sent the archdeacon Protadius as his representative. Two letters he wrote are preserved in the collection known as the Epistulae Austrasicae. In the first, dated to between about 540 and 550 by the editors, Mapinius congratulates Bishop Vilicus of Metz on his seventieth birthday.This is according to , but , says he \\"wish[ed] him life to his 60th year\\". He also praised him for not only pastoring sheep, but fattening bishops with his charm. This praise was, however, only prefatory to his true purpose, which was to inquire about the price of pigs around Reims. This may have been related to business or to the payment of taxes in kind (pigs) to the crown.: \\"the purpose of the letter is business\\"; : \\"likely to do with taxes in kind owed to the king\\". In the second letter, responding to a letter from Bishop Nicetius of Trier, Mapinius apologizes for being unable to attend the Council of Toul in 550. This latter is a valuable historical source for this council. Mapinius indicates that he was invited to the council through a letter from King Theudebald. When he wrote back demanding to know the purpose of the council, he learned that the king wished to overturn Nicetius' excommunication of certain Franks for incest. In his letter to Nicetius, he claimed not have received this information until too late, but some scholars reject this explanation. It may be that he simply did not wish to become involved or to make the journey. There may, however, have been a genuine breakdown in communication between the bishops, if Mapinius and Nicetius were indeed on the same side. Mapinius scolds Nicetius for not informing him directly of the council's purpose, and he asks about the guilt of the excommunicated parties and whether as a bishop he should receive them.

It was designed in the Romanesque Revival style by William G. Grinnell and built by Robert L. Darragh. Completed in 1889, it is Manhattan's oldest known remaining building erected specifically for commercial power generation. The Excelsior Power Company Building faces Gold Street and consists of seven full stories. The building is topped by a tower with one-story additions to the north and south. The round arches contain ornate detailing. Other features of the building included a base with architectural terracotta decoration, as well as a sign with the Excelsior Power Company's name at the front of the building. The earliest section of the Excelsior Power Company Building was erected for the American Heating and Power Company in 1882, on the northwest corner of the site. The present structure was completed between 1887 and 1889, though it started operating in 1888. The plant initially served as a main power station but was later converted into an electrical substation. In 1978, its then-owner Consolidated Edison sold the Excelsior Power Company Building, which was subsequently combined with an adjacent property and converted to a residential building. The Excelsior Power Company Building was made a New York City designated landmark in 2016. Design The Excelsior Power Company Building is located at 33‚Äì43 Gold Street in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City, southwest of Fulton Street. Officially, it is part of a larger building spanning the addresses 33‚Äì51 Gold Street and 82‚Äì88 Fulton Street. The Excelsior Power Company Building was designed by William Covington Gunnell and, according to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), is Gunnell's only known design in the city. It was erected by Robert L. Darragh, a master mason who also worked on the Union Theological Seminary, New York World Building, and Home Life Building. As built, the Excelsior Power Company Building's above-ground stories were rented to tenants, particularly those in industrial sectors, while the steam plant itself was in the basement. The basement vault extends underneath the entire width of Gold Street at its widest point. The plant was the Excelsior Power Company's main generating plant in the area bounded clockwise from north by Chambers Street, the East River, Beaver Street, and Broadway. = Facade = The Excelsior Power Company Building faces eastward toward Gold Street and consists of seven full stories. A small tower rises above the seventh-story roof. One-story additions to the north and south of the tower were respectively erected in 1902 and 1979. A water tower is also located atop the roof. The facade on Gold Street is composed largely of red brick in common bond, with a granite base. The facade is divided from south to north into five vertical parts of different widths; two recessed pavilions alternate between two projecting end pavilions and a shallower central pavilion. The facade uses vertical design elements such as brick piers that project slightly, as well as horizontal design elements such as window sills, arched arcades, and a parapet. The original freight entrance was in the central pavilion and contains a metal sign reading , as well as an architectural terracotta plaque reading The original entrance was replaced with two windows, while a newer entrance was built immediately to the right (north). There are large round arches over the second story, supported by brick piers, which provide aesthetic emphasis. In the recessed bays are foliated terracotta plaques above the arches, while on the end and central pavilions, there are archivolts above the arches. A scrolled wall-bracket lamp, designated as an official city landmark, hangs from the second-floor facade outside the central pavilion. On the third through sixth floors, the windows are set within flat-arched openings. The window openings on the sixth floor, as well as on the seventh floor of the central pavilion, are surrounded by corbelled brick. The seventh floor contains round-arched openings topped by archivolts. A cornice, which is machicolated, runs above the seventh floor. The small tower rises above the central pavilion and contains round-arched window openings as well as corbelled piers at its corners. History During the 19th century, the site of the Excelsior Power Company Building was close to Manhattan's original diamond district on Maiden Lane to the south, as well as Newspaper Row and printing interests to the west. The site was also close to Pearl Street Station, the first commercial central power plant in the United States, which started operating in 1882. Pearl Street Station served the \\"First District\\" (bounded clockwise from north by Spruce Street, the East River, Wall Street, and Nassau Street), so named because of its importance in the history of electric power. The Excelsior Power Company Building, within the First District, is the oldest known surviving power-plant building in Manhattan, according to the LPC. The Excelsior Power Company, founded in 1873, had initially operated a commercial boiler near Printing House Square on Spruce Street, which provided steam to the newspaper buildings on Newspaper Row. = Construction = The American Heating and Power Company, the first power company to build a power plant on the Excelsior site, started laying its steam mains in late 1881. American Heating purchased an irregularly shaped plot on Gold Street west of Fulton Street in January 1882, measuring about . That April, William Gunnell submitted plans for a four-story power plant on the southern third of the current site, which would cost $150,000 (). The only parts of the plant to have been completed were the first two stories and part of the basement. By June 1882, American Heating had laid of pipe under streets in the Financial District, but within a year, the company's reputation was affected by a series of explosions involving American Heating pipes.See, for instance: * * A receiver took over American Heating's holdings in May 1883, and bondholders bought American Heating's properties, including its Gold Street plant, at an auction held the following year. The plant was held by the Columbian Heating and Power Company from 1884 to 1887. Depiction of the building in 1888 The power plant was purchased by the Excelsior Steam Power Company in October 1887. Excelsior hired Gunnell to design alterations for the building, which were submitted to the New York City Department of Buildings the same month. The plans entailed expanding the building to seven stories and adding a basement at a cost of $100,000 (). Part of the facade would also be recessed to increase natural light cover on the lower stories, which had been limited by Gold Street's narrowness. This work, encompassing the northern two- thirds of the present power plant, had been completed by April 1888. That month, Gunnell filed plans to increase the height of the southern third of the site to seven stories at a cost of $80,000 (). The plant's dynamos were operational by July 1888, and the expanded power plant was finished in March 1889. = Operation = The Excelsior Power Company Building originally provided power using a direct current system. According to accounts published in 1888, the plant originally contained six boilers as well as a high-pressure engine rated at . A flywheel and a belt transmitted the power to seven generating dynamos of each, made by the Daft Electric Light Company. Power from the dynamos was then transmitted to tenants of the surrounding neighborhood. By the end of 1889, the original dynamos were scheduled to be replaced with models of each. The upper floors were occupied by to a variety of tenants, including jewelers and printers. A bulkhead was installed atop the roof in 1892. In its early years, the building was slightly damaged by fires, including in 1894 and in 1901. Excelsior was acquired by the New York Heat, Light and Power Company in 1895, and the combined company continued to operate the plant as a power and steam generating station. In addition to powering its own tenants, the Excelsior Power Company Building supplied electricity to other office buildings and factories in the neighborhood, as well as to the New York Daily Press. Skylights were added to the roof of the building in 1899, and around the same time, the Excelsior plant was turned into an electrical substation with backup generators. New York Heat itself was acquired in 1898 with a firm colloquially called The Power Company, which in 1901 became part of the New York Edison Company. New York Edison built a penthouse structure atop the roof of the building's southern section in 1902. By the early 1920s, the backup generators were taken out of service, and the commercial and industrial tenants had left the upper floors. The basement and the first three floors housed transformers while the fourth through seventh floors were used by New York Edison as offices. This use continued through at least the late 1940s. New York Edison's successor, Consolidated Edison, had decommissioned the Gold Street substation by 1961, when it bought the adjacent six-story building at 82-88 Fulton Street. The building was first considered for landmark status in 1977, though the designation was opposed by the building's owner. = Residential conversion = Consolidated Edison sold the Excelsior Power Building and the adjacent Fulton Street property in 1978. Thurcon Properties Limited bought the two buildings, converting them into a 197-unit apartment complex, with units ranging from studios to three-bedroom apartments. The renovations were overseen by Wechsler, Grasso & Menziuso. By 1979, a writer for the New York Daily News observed that the Excelsior Power Company Building had been 70% rented. In late 2015, the LPC hosted a public hearing on whether to designate the Excelsior Power Company Building as a city landmark; most comments supported the designation, but some parties opposed it, including a New York Landmarks Conservancy representative. This was part of a review of 95 listings that had been calendared by the LPC for several decades, but never approved as city landmarks. The LPC had initially considered 28 sites for possible landmark status, but in a February 2016 meeting, added the Excelsior Power Company Building and another building to the list of sites for consideration. In December 2016, after a backlog of several decades, the Excelsior Power Company Building was made a New York City designated landmark.

He served in the Free French Forces. Biography After he obtained his bachelor's degree, Tup√´t-Thom√© entered the √âcole sup√©rieure de th√©ologie catholique de Reims. However, he soon decided to join the French Armed Forces and was incorporated into the 8th Zouaves Regiment and stationed in Camp de Ch√¢lons. Promoted to sergeant, his regiment was attacked in Lorraine in September 1939 and in Belgium the following year. He participated with his unit in the Dunkirk evacuation from 26 May to 3 June 1940. He was taken prisoner the next day but escaped back to France during his transfer. While back in France, Tup√´t-Thom√© found work in Clermont-Ferrand, where he met Roger Wybot and Stanislas Mangin, who tasked him with finding illegal airstrips. He was then one of the first men to join the Free French Forces, led by Charles de Gaulle. He parachuted into Ch√¢teauroux on 9 December 1941. However, he was injured during his landing, and was forced to leave combat. Six months later, he left France to seek treatment in England. While in London, he requested to join a combat unit. He left to work as a commando instructor in Saint Pierre and Miquelon. In August 1943, Tup√´t-Thom√© joined the 4th Air Infantry Battalion, which would become the 2nd Parachute Chasseur Regiment, part of the Brigade SAS. He became a certified parachutist the following month. In January 1944, he became second in command of the 3rd Parachute Chasseur Regiment. The Regiment's first mission was in Daoulas in August 1944. His group of 12 men outlasted Germany's 60. He then attacked Germany's stronghold in Landerneau, liberating the city. Subsequently, he freed Clerval. His final parachute mission was in the Netherlands on 7 April 1945. In 1945, Tup√´t-Thom√© resigned from the French Armed Forces. He was admitted to the √âcole nationale de la France d'Outre-Mer and became an administrator of colonies in French Tunisia in January 1946. He would later become director of Takelsa's wine production. He left Tunisia in 1950 for Canada and managed a farm which he had acquired. In 1955, he returned to France, resumed his studies, and became an engineer at the Organisation scientifique du travail and joined the Singer Corporation in a pharmaceutical laboratory in Neuilly-sur-Seine. He became a mercenary in the Katangese Gendarmerie, the army of the secessionist State of Katanga led by Mo√Øse Tshombe, as an adviser to Joseph Yav, defence minister as part of Katangese disengagement with Belgium. Subsequently, he worked for Panhard and finished his career working for a tourism agency. After his retirement, Tup√´t- Thom√© lived in Binic, where he took part in commemoration ceremonies. He was then admitted to Les Invalides in Paris, where he would become a resident. He was honored with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour and was named a Companion of the Liberation. During the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Appeal of 18 June, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the last four members of the Order of the Liberation, Daniel Cordier, Pierre Simonet, Hubert Germain, and Edgard Tup√´t-Thom√© would be honorary members of the Order of the British Empire. The honor was presented by Ed Llewellyn, Ambassador of the United Kingdom to France on 2 July 2020. Edgard Tup√´t-Thom√© died at Les Invalides on 9 September 2020 at the age of 100. The French President Emmanuel Macron issued a press release, saying: \\"This resistance from the first hour, who was until his last breath a committed man, ready to oppose the bad winds of history with the breath of the ideal\\". The Minister of Armed Forces, Florence Parly, and the Minister of Memory and Veterans Affairs, Genevi√®ve Darrieussecq, paid tribute, declaring: \\"Every key moment of the Second World War in France is found in the epic of the young Edgard Tup√´t\\" and \\"Like his 1038 brothers in arms, he personified the honor of France and the participation of our country in the Victory\\". It was announced that military honors would be returned to him on 17 September 2020 in a ceremony at the courtyard of Les Invalides.

History Following a presentation titled \\"Why Have a Statewide Women's Bar Association in New Hampshire?\\", given by a member of the Women's Bar Association of Massachusetts, there was a consensus to incorporate New Hampshire's first statewide women's bar association. On October 1, 1998, the NHWBA held its inaugural fall reception in Concord, New Hampshire. In its first year, NHWBA gained over 200 members. An annual fall reception has been held in Concord every October since. In celebration of its 20th anniversary, the NHWBA launched their SHERO campaign, honoring prominent and influential female attorneys and educators throughout the state. Activities The NHWBA currently has five committees: Membership, Networking, Programming, Public Relations, and Public Service. In addition, the NHWBA sometimes publicly advocates for certain policy provisions that affect the legal profession and the interests of women and families.https://nhwba.org/Public-Policy The NHWBA also hosts Continuing Legal Education classes, runs community service programs and food drives, and facilitates networking and mentoring programs.https://nhwba.org/Committeeshttps://nhwba.org/events Women to Women Project The New Hampshire Department of Corrections and the NHWBA worked together to create the \\"Women to Women Project\\" which matches New Hampshire attorneys with current inmates at the New Hampshire State Prison for Women. The program allows inmates to receive limited legal advice from licensed attorneys. The NHWBA Public Service Committee facilitates bi-monthly information sessions on different areas of the law for inmates at the prison. Awards Every year, the NHWBA presents two awards at their fall reception. The first is the Marilla M. Ricker Achievement Award, honoring the first female lawyer from New Hampshire. The Ricker Award is presented to an attorney who has \\"achieved professional excellence, and paved the way to success for other women lawyers, or advanced opportunities for women in the legal profession, and/or performed exemplary public service on behalf of women.\\" Past recipients include Representative Annie Kuster and former New Hampshire Supreme Court Justices Carol Ann Conboy and Linda Dalianis. The second award is the Winnie MacLaughlin Scholarship, which is presented annually to a second-year law student from the University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of Law who exemplifies academic excellence and has completed community service focusing on advancing women in society.

Pone could be made with corn, or some other main ingredient could be used like sweet potato. This style of bread, eaten cold as a breakfast food, was a staple food of the cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies. Terminology The term \\"pone\\" most likely entered English from Native American language terms like apan, oppone or supawn, meaning baked, possibly related to earlier ash cakes baked in hot coals. A \\"corn pone\\" is usually a small round loaf of cornbread, about the size of a biscuit, traditionally baked in a round cast iron skillet. The batter was also called \\"corn pone\\" and could be thin and fried on the griddle to make Johnny cakes or thicker to make baked loaves (\\"pone\\"), or dumplings, called corn dodgers when dropped in stews and hush puppies when deep fried. Hush puppies were called \\"fried pones\\" in the 1928 edition of Southern Cooking by Henrietta Stanley Dull, later changed to \\"hush puppy\\" for the 1941 edition. Isabel Ely Lord uses the terms ash bread, johnny cake, spider cornbread and hoe cake as synonyms for corn pone. Her explanation of the history of these different terms follows: > As \\"ash bread\\" it was baked in the hot ashes of the fireplace, protected by > a cabbage leaf, or leaves; as \\"hoe cake\\" it baked on a hoe in the fields, or > on a hoe-shaped board (with long handle) in the fireplace. \\"Pone\\" is the > irregular oval shape the cakes took in these last 2 methods when shaped by > the palm of the hand. \\"Johnny cake\\" was a Northern name, and the cake was > usually baked in the oven. Variations There are varieties on the basic corn pone recipe like apple pones, pumpkin pones and sweet potato pone. The batter can be enriched with sweeteners like sugar or molasses to improve the flavor, and spices like cinnamon, cloves, ginger or grated orange peel, but some cooks consider the addition of sugar a deviation from the \\"the original dish\\".

The fires were started by lightning on August 17, 2020; by September 5, all the individual fires had been put out with the exception of the Claremont and Bear Fires, which merged on that date. On September 8, strong winds caused the Bear Fire to explode in size, rapidly spreading to the southwest, threatening the city of Berry Creek. On September 8th, 2020 The town of Berry Creek was immediately evacuated at 3:15 pm with no prior warning, By September 9th, 2020 The town of Berry Creek has been leveled, few homes standing. Among the 16 fatalities was a 16 year old boy. As of October 2, the complex fire has burned an estimated and is 88% contained. The fire is being managed by the U.S. Forest Service in conjunction with Cal Fire, with the incident base in Quincy. The North Complex Fire is currently the sixth-largest fire recorded in California's modern history. Events On August 17, 2020, dry thunderstorms sparked 21 wildfires in the Plumas National Forest and Lassen National Forest, the largest of which were the Claremont and Bear Fires along the canyon of the Middle Fork Feather River. The storms came from a large plume of moisture from Tropical Storm Fausto that were carried into California, which started hundreds of wildfires simultaneously across Northern and Central California. By August 22, 16 of the original 21 fires had been contained. The Sheep Fire near Susanville was originally included as part of the North Complex, but on September 5, it was assigned to a separate incident. The Sheep Fire burned about , before it was fully contained on September 9. =Claremont Fire= The Claremont Fire was spotted around 9:00 AM PDT on August 17. The fire originated along Claremont Creek, a tributary of the Middle Fork just south of Quincy, and quickly jumped the ridge northwards towards American Valley. On August 20 an evacuation advisory was issued for East Quincy which was quickly changed to a mandatory evacuation for East Quincy and residents along Quincy-La Porte Road. On August 22 the fire jumped California State Route 70 at the Massack Rest Area southeast of Quincy. On August 23, aided by high winds, the fire began advancing rapidly east forcing Spring Garden and Greenhorn to be evacuated. The fire threatened State Route 70 and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, shutting both down intermittently for several days. On August 27, the Claremont Fire was at and 47 percent contained. Mandatory evacuations were lifted in East Quincy, but with continued strong west winds, Greenhorn and Sloat to the east were evacuated on August 28. On August 30 crews conducted backfire operations on the eastern side of the fire and prevented it from spreading towards Spring Garden and Cromberg. On September 1 mandatory evacuations were lifted for Quincy-La Porte Road. On September 5, with fire activity much lower on the eastern sides, evacuation orders were lifted for Spring Garden, Greenhorn, Sloat and Cromberg. On the morning of August 31 it was at , and 59 percent contained. On the morning of September 4 it had grown to , and containment had dropped to 49 percent. =Bear Fire= Bear Fire on Highway 162, 10 September The Bear Fire was also spotted around 9:00 AM on August 17, in the Middle Fork canyon west of the Claremont Fire near the Pacific Crest Trail. The fire started in rough, roadless country along the Wild and Scenic section of the Middle Fork. Initially, the Bear Fire was left to burn as it was not near any populated areas, and firefighting efforts were concentrated on the Claremont Fire. By August 23, it was at . On August 26, some areas around Bucks Lake were placed under evacuation advisory due to increased fire activity on the Bear Fire. Crews also were working on containment line to the northeast as the fire expanded slightly towards Quincy. By August 31 it had grown to , and was still 0 percent contained. On the morning of September 4 it was at , and was 29 percent contained. =September 5‚Äìpresent= While crews concentrated on structure protection and building containment line around the perimeter of the fires, the unpopulated area between the Claremont and Bear fires was allowed to burn naturally with the help of backfiring operations, and the two fires merged on September 5, at a combined . A total of 1,386 personnel were assigned to the fire. The southern boundary of the fire was mostly held along the Middle Fork, and crews worked to build secondary containment lines south of the river. Flames crossed the river in a few areas but were quickly contained. On the morning of September 8 a dry cold front moved in, bringing strong northeast winds and threatening the incomplete containment line along the river. Gavin Newsom signing AB2147 among trees that burned in the North Complex Fire At about 10:00 AM on September 8, the Bear Fire half of the North Complex jumped the river and began heading rapidly southwest. With winds gusting to , the spot fire had grown to within an hour, and by 3 PM it had grown to . At 11:50 AM, mandatory evacuations were issued for La Porte and Little Grass Valley Reservoir. As winds picked up throughout the day, evacuation orders were issued by 3:25 PM for several communities in Butte County including Feather Falls, Clipper Mills, Berry Creek, Brush Creek, Woodleaf and Forbestown, and around Miners Ranch Road and California State Route 162. Evacuation orders were also effective in Yuba County for residents along La Porte Road, New York Flat Road, and around Brownsville and New Bullards Bar Reservoir. At 11:00 PM Kelly Ridge and Copley Hills, near Lake Oroville, were evacuated, as officials predicted strong winds would lead to extreme fire behavior. By the evening of September 8 the fire had burned about and was 51 percent contained. On the early morning of September 9, evacuation warnings were issued for more areas around Lake Oroville, Concow and Paradise. In Plumas County a mandatory evacuation order was issued for Bucks Lake and an evacuation advisory for Meadow Valley. As predicted, high winds drove the fire rapidly downhill and southwest, traveling to Lake Oroville in a few hours. By 8:35 AM, the fire was estimated at . The entire town of Berry Creek was destroyed, with only 3 houses left standing in the town of 1,200. Homes were also burned in several nearby communities, such as Feather Falls. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at University of California Los Angeles, compared the explosive wind-driven spread with the 2018 Camp Fire, which occurred just north of this area. At 4:00 PM PDT on September 9, the fire had jumped the southern arm of the lake and was burning in the hills above Oroville. It had also traveled as far west as the North Fork Feather River, threatening Paradise, although the burn scar from the Camp Fire had the potential to be used to slow fire activity. On the south, the fire reached the South Fork Feather River, burning around the north side of Little Grass Valley Reservoir and approaching Forbestown. The city of Oroville and surrounding foothill communities were under an evacuation warning. As of 5:00 PM, at least three people were dead and twelve missing; at least 100 people were rescued. An estimated 2,000 buildings have been destroyed. On the evening of September 9, the fire was estimated at and was 24 percent contained.https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/photos/CAPNF/2020-08-18-0011-North- Complex/related_files/pict20200810-000248-0.pdf On September 10, the section of the fire that escaped from the Bear Fire was labeled as the North Complex West Zone. The approximately section outside of the Plumas National Forest is being managed by Cal Fire. On September 10 authorities reported the number of deaths had increased to ten, and 16 people were reported missing. Due in part to a reversal of wind direction, the fire did not burn significantly more acreage on September 10. On the same day, the burn area was revised to , with 23 percent containment. By September 11, winds had shifted to the southwest, blowing the fire front and smoke back over the burn area and towards Quincy. Fire activity was significantly decreased from the previous day, allowing crews to work on containment lines protecting homes around Bucks Lake and Little Grass Valley Reservoir. By the morning of September 12, the fire was at and 21 percent contained. A total of 3,282 personnel were assigned to the fire. On September 14, the fire had increased in size to , with most growth along the north flank of the fire. Containment was increased to 38 percent. On September 15 continued southwest winds caused the fire to jump containment lines near Red Mountain, moving northeast towards Bucks Lake. On September 16 high fire activity continued near Red Mountain, with spot fires starting in the Grizzly Lake area. The fire was also active and growing in Onion Valley south of Quincy. In the meantime, firefighters made progress on containment lines along the southeast flank of the fire, between Sly Creek Reservoir and Little Grass Valley Reservoir. The fire was at and 36 percent contained. On the morning of September 17, evacuation orders were issued for Meadow Valley and Tollgate as fire activity continued to pick up on the north side. By September 18 firefighters had extended containment lines up from Sly Creek Reservoir to Onion Valley. The spot fire at Grizzly Lake was contained, but not before burning . The fire was at , and containment was increased to 54 percent. On September 22, the North Complex reached , and was 75 percent contained. Most of the growth had occurred on the northwest side of the fire as it continued to expand towards Bucks Lake. On September 27, strong sustained winds picked up once again, starting spot fires outside of containment lines, including one on French Hotel Creek. An evacuation order was issued for Pulga, Concow, Big Bend and Yankee Hill as the fire moved west towards the North Fork Feather River Canyon. By the morning of September 29, the fire was within a few hundred yards of Highway 70, which was closed between Greenville Wye (west of Quincy) and Cherokee Road (east of Oroville). The North Complex was at and 76 percent contained. Smoke Smoke from Bear Fire in Oroville Smoke from the fire has created extremely unhealthy air conditions in Quincy and nearby communities for several weeks. After the fire grew explosively in size on September 9, smoke reached the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay area with ash falling from the sky between Danville, San Jose, and San Francisco.

As of October 2020, the fire was still burning. The fire started as three separate fires. The Beachie Creek, Lionshead, and P-515 fires were ignited by lightning on August 16, 2020. The first three fires gradually grew in size, before explosively spreading in early September during a heatwave, fanned by powerful east winds. Early on September 8, the Beachie Creek and Lionshead Fires merged together, and the combined fire was labeled the Santiam Fire, before being returned to their original names a couple days later. The P-515 Fire merged into the Lionshead Fire a few days later. The Santiam Fire destroyed over 1,500 structures, including the cities of Detroit and Gates, with Idanha, Mill City, and Lyons suffering varying amounts of damage, becoming one of the most destructive wildfires in the recorded history of Oregon. The fire killed 5 people, and 1 person remains missing. On September 10‚Äì12, 2020, there were fears that the Santiam Fire would merge with the Riverside Fire to the north. Timeline On the morning of August 16, thunderstorms moved across Oregon, starting multiple fires, including the Beachie Creek Fire, the Lionshead Fire, and the P-515 Fire. The Lionshead and P-515 Fires were ignited in the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, near Mount Jefferson, while the Beachie Creek Fire was ignited near Opal Creek, to the west of the other two fires. Initially, the three fires were unremarkable, being relatively small wildfires that smoldered in the rugged terrain of the Opal Creek and Mount Jefferson Wildernesses, within the Willamette National Forest. However, the fires gradually grew in size, since firefighters opted to use only indirect methods and water drops to fight the fires, due to the dangers of directly fighting the fires in the steep, mountainous terrain. State authorities closed off portions of the national forest where the fires were burning, in an attempt to keep the fires boxed in. Fire officials noted the potential for the fires to become active and explosively spread under the right conditions, despite their small size at the time. On September 7, powerful east winds blew across Oregon and the Pacific Northwest, reaching speeds over , causing the fires to explode in size as they raced westward, with the Lionshead Fire burning down portions of Idanha. The winds also blew down power lines around Santiam Canyon, sparking 13 spot fires between Detroit and Mehama, which quickly grew into a large blaze that merged with the Beachie Creek Fire within hours. Due to the rapid spread of the Santiam and Beachie Creek Fires, and the imminent threat they posed to communities to the west, including areas as far west as Salem, mass evacuations were ordered in Marion County. The evacuation orders were suddenly issued near midnight on Tuesday, September 8, sowing plenty of confusion and chaos in the ensuing evacuations. Early on September 8, the Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fires merged, probably at a point north of Detroit. The merger created a complex fire, which was referred to as the Santiam Fire, with the name reflecting the fact that the spot fires ignited around Santiam Canyon had been responsible for most of the Beachie Creek Fire's explosive growth. On September 9, the Santiam Fire quickly moved into and destroyed the city of Detroit as it continued its westward spread. Soon afterward, the Santiam Fire destroyed the city of Gates, and burned into Mill City and parts of Lyons during its westward spread, also threatening the cities of Stayton and Salem. On September 10, incident command renamed the main component fires to Beachie Creek Fire and Lionshead Fire. On the same day, officials feared that the Santiam Fire would merge with the Riverside Fire to the north, which would create an even bigger fire that would pose a much greater threat to the communities near Salem and Portland, while complicating efforts to contain the fires. However, this fear subsided somewhat on the next day, as firefighters made progress on containing both the Santiam and Riverside Fires, with improved weather conditions. On September 11, the P-515 Fire merged into the eastern portion of the Lionshead Fire, increasing the size of the Santiam Fire to . During the following week, the onshore flow returned, causing the Lionshead Fire to begin spreading eastward. On September 23, the Santiam Fire exceeded in size.  Impact  The fires forced large-scale evacuations across Marion County. Many buildings were destroyed during the fires' westward spread, mostly in September, with the Santiam Fire destroying most of the cities of Detroit, and Gates, with Idanha, Mill City, and Lyons suffering anywhere from moderate to extensive amounts of damage. The Santiam Fire killed 5 people, and 1 person remains missing.

The vertex configuration of a uniform polyhedron, a generalization of the Schl√§fli symbol that describes the pattern of polygons surrounding each vertex, was devised in this book as a way to name the Archimedean solids, and has sometimes been called the Cundy‚ÄìRollett symbol as a nod to this origin. Topics The first edition of the book had five chapters, including its introduction which discusses model-making in general and the different media and tools with which one can construct models. The media used for the constructions described in the book include \\"paper, cardboard, plywood, plastics, wire, string, and sheet metal\\". The second chapter concerns plane geometry, and includes material on the golden ratio, the Pythagorean theorem, dissection problems, the mathematics of paper folding, tessellations, and plane curves, which are constructed by stitching, by graphical methods, and by mechanical devices. The third chapter, and the largest part of the book, concerns polyhedron models, made from cardboard or plexiglass. It includes information about the Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, their stellations and duals, uniform polyhedron compounds, and deltahedra. The fourth chapter is on additional topics in solid geometry and curved surfaces, particularly quadrics but also including topological manifolds such as the torus, M√∂bius strip and Klein bottle, and physical models helping to visualize the map coloring problem on these surfaces. Also included are sphere packings. The models in this chapter are constructed as the boundaries of solid objects, via two-dimensional paper cross-sections, and by string figures. The fifth chapter, and the final one of the first edition, includes mechanical apparatus including harmonographs and mechanical linkages, the bean machine and its demonstration of the central limit theorem, and analogue computation using hydrostatics. The second edition expands this chapter, and adds another chapter on computational devices such as the differential analyser of Vannevar Bush. Much of the material on polytopes was based on the book Regular Polytopes by H. S. M. Coxeter, and some of the other material has been drawn from resources previously published in 1945 by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Audience and reception At the time they wrote the book, Cundy and Rollett were sixth form teachers in the UK, and they intended the book to be used by mathematics students and teachers for educational activities at that level. However, it may also be enjoyed by a general audience of mathematics enthusiasts. Reviewer Michael Goldberg notes some minor errors in the book's historical credits and its notation, and writes that for American audiences some of the British terminology may be unfamiliar, but concludes that it could still be valuable for students and teachers. Stanley Ogilvy complains about the inconsistent level of rigor of the mathematical descriptions, with some proofs given and others omitted, for no clear reason, but calls this issue minor and in general calls the book's presentation excellent. Dirk ter Haar is more enthusiastic, recommending it to anyone interested in mathematics, and suggesting that it should be required for mathematics classrooms. Similarly, B. J. F. Dorrington recommends it to all mathematical libraries, and The Basic Library List Committee of the Mathematical Association of America has given it their strong recommendation for inclusion in undergraduate mathematics libraries. By the time of its second edition, H. S. M. Coxeter states that Mathematical Models had become \\"well known\\".

Name The name Forterre is a contraction of forte terre, \\"strong earth\\". Geography The communaut√© de communes de Puisaye-Forterre shown in darker red within the region of Bourgogne-Franche- Comt√© The Forterre is neighbored by the Puisaye to the west and northwest, the Auxerrois to the northeast, the Yonne river valley to the east, and the hills of Nivernais to the south. Its main town is Courson-les-Carri√®res. Significant villages include Bouhy, Druyes-les-Belles-Fontaines, Etais-la-Sauvin, Ouanne, and Thury. It is traversed by the water divide between the respective catchment areas of the Loire and the Seine. The Loing, a significant tributary of the Seine, has its source in the Forterre, in Sainte-Colombe-sur-Loing. Today the Forterre is bypassed by major infrastructures, but that was not always the case. The local topography still has traces of the Roman road between Auxerre (Autissiodorum) and Entrains-sur-Nohain (Intaranum), and of a 19th-century railroad, the , most of which was dismantled in 1943 by German occupation forces to supply rails to the Russian front. The is the railroad's most spectacular local legacy. The Forterre's terrain is comparatively dry and stands in contrast to the neighboring Puisaye with its lakes, rivers and forests. Lying mid-way between Sancerre and Chablis, it used to be a wine- producing region. One late-medieval chronicle records a vineyard planted in the 1450s in Perreuse by Antoine de Chabannes, lord of Puisaye.. The Forterre's grapevines, however, were ravaged by the early-20th-century outbreak of phylloxera. Recent attempts have been made to revive wine production, with grapes including Pinot noir, C√©sar, Pinot gris, Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Sauvignon blanc. Administration Apart from its southwestern tip (Bouhy) in the d√©partement of Ni√®vre, the Forterre's territory is overwhelmingly in the Yonne d√©partement, and within it in the Canton of Vincelles since the latest cantonal redistricting took effect in 2015. The same Canton also includes parts of the Puisaye to the west of the Forterre, and of the Yonne valley to its east including its seat in Vincelles. All of the Forterre is within the , established on 1 January 2017, of which it constitutes the southeastern third. Together with neighboring Puisaye, the Forterre has always been a borderland between different counties, provinces and later administrative regions within France. In the High Middle Ages it was on the border between the counties of Nevers and Auxerre. During the Hundred Years' War it found itself between the warring duchies of Berry and Burgundy in the Armagnac‚ÄìBurgundian Civil War, then at the intersection between the respective domains of Charles VII and Henry VI as rival claimants to the French throne and of Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy. By the end of the Ancien R√©gime the Forterre was divided between Orl√©anais, Nivernais and the Duchy of Burgundy, with Champagne immediately to the north. History The Battle of Fontenoy (841) illustrated in the 14th-century Grandes Chroniques de France The territory of the Forterre was christianized in late antiquity. Some villages are traditionally associated with late-Antiquity saints, e.g. Mamertinus or Mammert in Perreuse and Romanus or Romain in Druyes. A Carolingian manuscript lists several Forterre parishes on the itinerary of Saint Aunarius, Bishop of Auxerre in the late 6th century, namely Courson-les- Carri√®res (Curcedonus), Druyes (Drogia), Bouhy (Balgiacus), Thury (Tauriacus), Levis (Livadiacus), and Ouanne (Odona). In 841, the Battle of Fontenoy was fought mostly in western Forterre. Memories of the battle survive in a number of local place names. One example is the wood of Roichat near Thury, named after King Charles the Bald (roi Charles) who stayed there before the battle. A memorial obelisk was erected in 1860 near the village of Fontenoy at the initiative of local scholar . In the 12th and early 13th century, the Forterre was dominated by the Capetian House of Courtenay, a branch of France's royal family. The Courtenays, several of which became Emperors of Constantinople, built the Ch√¢teau de Druyes in Druyes-les-Belles-Fontaines, now one of the region's foremost landmarks. The Forterre suffered severe depopulation and decline during the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages, and renewal from the second half of the 15th century. Many village churches were entirely rebuilt at that time, which now constitute what is arguably the region's most characteristic architecture. Several of these churches have ornate portals and/or prominent towers, e.g. in Charentenay, Ouanne, Sainpuits, Soug√®res, Taingy, and Thury. This period of dynamism and prosperity, however, ended in the time of the French Wars of Religion. The Montagne des Alouettes was briefly a stronghold of the French resistance in the summer of 1944 The Forterre was briefly occupied by Coalition forces in the summer of 1815, and more durably by German forces in 1940-1944. An armed r√©sistance group or maquis was established on the Montagne des Alouettes near Soug√®res-en-Puisaye, for a month between late July 1944 and the region's liberation in late August. About 250-strong, the group had weapons parachuted by Allied planes. The history of the Forterre, especially its western part, is interwoven with that of the neighboring Puisaye. In the 15th and early 16th centuries, some of its villages such as Thury belonged to the Lordship of Puisaye. In 1955, the village of Soug√®res- les-Simon changed its name to Soug√®res-en-Puisaye, despite this being a misnomer if Puisaye is taken as the distinct geographical region to the northwest.

Reviews of her singing varied. \\"The quality of Yvette Rugel's singing is startling,\\" noted critic Bland Johaneson in 1923, \\"she has chosen to continue singing the hackneyed vaudeville hits, but in a way which is different.\\" A later critic, Burke Henry, described her voice as a \\"lyrical spinto\\", after her 1930 appearances in Rome, Paris, London, and Venice, where she sang arias for Mussolini.

The WNPRC is part of a network of seven National Primate Research Centers which conduct biomedical research on primates. As of 2020, the center houses approximately 1,600 animals. Research The WNPRC describes its mission to involve researching human diseases, studying primate biology, providing \\"expertise, resources and training\\" to scientists, and disseminating information about the center. In 2020, the center consisted of 1,600 animals, 190 employees, and 190 trainees. Incidents and controversies =1960s and 1970s= During the 1960s and 1970s, psychologist Harry Harlow led experiments at the WNPRC in which young monkeys were subjected to social isolation, causing the monkeys to experience severe emotional distress. As part of his experiments, Harlow developed a device called the \\"pit of despair\\", which was an isolation chamber where young monkeys were kept for up to ten weeks. =2010-2014= In June 2012, a seven-month-old macaque died after its head was caught between a support bar and enclosure. In July 2014, a USDA inspection report revealed that since January 1, 2013, there had been 36 incidents of non-human primates escaping from their enclosures. Five of these incidents involved significant injuries to the animals which required surgery or primary closure of wounds. Furthermore, many of these escapes were the result of human errors such as incorrectly closing or securing enclosures. In February 2013, a five-year-old marmoset was killed as the result of improper use of an anesthesia machine by a veterinary technician. In October 2013, a macaque sustained a thermal injury after a heat lamp, which was intended to warm the animal, malfunctioned. In June 2014, a two-year-old macaque died after her head was caught in a chain her cage. In 2014, psychiatrist Ned Kalin was approved for experiments in which newborn monkeys were to be separated from their mothers, subjected to anxiety-inducing tests, and then euthanized. Kalin's experiments sparked outrage and condemnation, and a petition against Kalin's experiments was signed by over 290,000 people. In July 2014, a USDA inspection report revealed that since July 2014, there had been two incidents of non-human primates escaping their cages due to technician error, which resulted in the animals experiencing injuries which required amputation and closure of wounds. The same report revealed that there had been three incidents of animal mis-pairing due to technician error, which resulted in injuries and wounds to the animals. =2015-2019= In January 2016, a USDA inspection report revealed that there had been 12 incidents of primates escaping their enclosures. Nine of these cases were due to human error, and three were due to enclosure hardware failure. After their escape, many primates were injured after interacting with other primates. Some of these injuries involved primates losing portions of their tongues, and some required sutures and/or digit amputations. In December 2015, it was discovered that a drinking water supply line for three rhesus macaques had been disconnected for one to four days. The animals were given IV fluid therapy. After the therapy, two of the animals recovered, but the third did not and was euthanized. In June 2018, a USDA inspection report revealed that that since November 2016, there had been four incidents of macaques escaping their enclosures due to human error or enclosure failure. After escaping, the macaques interacted with other macaques and sustained injuries, which required sutures and/or digit amputation. In October and November of 2017, a marmoset got its foot closed on by an enclosure door on two different occasions. As a result, the animal's foot was injured and required digit amputations. In February and March 2019, primates escaped their enclosures after locks were improperly installed. After their escape, the animals interacted with other primates and sustained injuries. Some of the injuries required surgical repair including sutures, digit amputation, and tongue loss. In July 2019, a USDA inspection report revealed that as the result of a handling procedure, a marmoset had sustained a femur fracture that required amputation.

Synopsis Cameron \\"Cam\\" Garrett Brooks left his boyhood home town, Millsburg, in 1934 to become a wealthy and famous writer. He lived in New York City, Connecticut, and France, but fortune and fame eluded him. In the aftermath of the death of his wife Selma and their child in an automobile accident on an icy road, he returns to Millsburg in 1961 as a struggling author. He resides in a room on the second story of the Majestic Hotel with a balcony overlooking Main Street, planning to use the people and events he sees on the street as inspiration for stories in a new book he is writing called Window on Main Street. His childhood friend Lloyd Ramsey, now the editor of the town's newspaper, tries to talk him out of it, telling him that the town has changed a great deal since he moved away and little is left of what he remembers from his childhood. Cam remains committed to his plan, however, believing that the people of Millsburg have remarkable stories for him to tell. Each week, he writes a chapter of his book, based on that week's story. Chris Logan, a widow who works as Lloyd's assistant at the newspaper, is Cam's romantic interest, and Arny is her young son. Harry McGill is the hotel's desk clerk. Other people Cam frequently encounters include Mrs. Miller and her son Roddy, Miss Wycliffe, Dick Aldrich, and Phil Rowan. In the spring of 1962, the hotel closed temporarily for renovations, and Cam moved in with its owner, Wally Evans, and his wife Peggy.

Rogers, Rodney, and Friedman had performed the same roles for Father Knows Best. Window on Main Street was filmed at Desilu Studios. CBS gave Young and Rodney complete creative control over the show, which had a moralizing and sentimental tone very similar to that of Father Knows Best, By not tying the central character, again portrayed by Young, to a domestic situation, however, Window on Main Street allowed the exploration of non- family themes that would not have fit into the premise of Father Knows Best. Window on Main Street never gained the audience of Father Knows Best, however, and only lasted for one season. Episodes Source: Broadcast history Window on Main Street premiered on CBS on October 2, 1961, airing on Mondays at 8:30 p.m. In mid-February 1962 it moved to 8:00 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it remained for the rest of its run.

Biography As early as the age of 6-7, he was brought by his father to sing at weddings and other gatherings. Along with his father Bajram, among the first to bring the ≈°argija to the Drenica area, young Salih performed with Amrush Ymeri, Riza Bllaca (who also sang with Bajram), and Feriz Krasniqi. Over the course of a half-century, he sang and often recorded many works, including epics, historical ballads known as kang t√´ oxhakut (‚Äúhearth songs‚Äù), love songs, and his specialty of standbys from the Turkic bard or ashik tradition. He memorized around 500 songs. Bajrami and his cousin Krasniqi performed for over forty years at weddings in Drenica, Llap, and elsewhere in the country. He also appeared at many concerts and civic events at the provincial, republican, federal, and international level during the time of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1966, he won first prize at the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod. Shortly before his death, he was awarded a diploma and pocket watch by the Kosovar Folklorist Journal () of Glogovac for his work preserving the folk music of Kosovo Albanians on the journal‚Äôs 25th anniversary. The two cousins often performed as an ensemble with the ≈°argija and √ßifteli. Music He performed instrumentally, but also sang tales of the hajduk (popular bandit) Hrnjica Brothers and the Albanian National Awakening, among other historical subjects. Specific things and people f√™ted include the League of Prizren, Haxhi Zeka, Ymer Prizreni, Bajram Curri, Hasan Prishtina, and Isa Boletini. He and Feriz often sang and played in unison and preserved the original tuning differing from standard Western equal temperament. Much of the traditional material would have been performed on special occasions accompanied by the gusle as well as the aforementioned instruments. The Bajrami-Krasniqi duo was particularly well-known for their call-and-response approach to the ashik songs, with Bajrami as leader and Krasniqi as responding in falsetto fortissimo.

The first station to be constructed on the island, it was owned by the Micronesian Broadcasting Corporation alongside WSZE AM and FM radio; it was a sister station to KUAM-TV, the commercial television station in Guam. It operated from 1969 to 1980. History WSZE-TV began broadcasting in October 1969, airing commercial network programming as well as productions of the government of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The station was established by H. Scott Killgore after the Trust Territory government expressed skepticism that a translator of KUAM-TV itself would not provide appropriate service to Saipan; the government did accept a proposal in 1968 to build a full station with local program capability. Studios were set up in the Royal Taga Hotel, taking up two small rooms on the second floor; the master control had a door leading to the water heater for the hotel's laundry system, which had previously occupied the space. WSZE-TV aired local news programming and Trust Territory government programming‚Äîsome of it live‚Äîthen live local news, followed by Sesame Street, the CBS Evening News and network entertainment fare, all recorded at the same video tape center in San Francisco that served KUAM-TV. Tapes were flown to Guam to be used on that station then ferried to Saipan on the Air Pacific air taxi service, which Killgore set up in part just to deliver tapes to the Saipan station. Of the small audience of 1,200 TV sets and 10,000 inhabitants, Killgore quipped, \\"It's the only television audience which we know all by their first names.\\" Killgore asked in 1973 to move the station from the hotel to a studio owned by the Marianas District Department of Education, which was being underutilized due to Trust Territory budget cuts. Negotiations to occupy the facility were lengthy, stretching late into 1974, after the money-losing television station announced that it would close by October 31 if the impasse, centered around the construction of a tower on military land, was not broken. When the station was approved for use of the studio, it then moved to secure use of the Navy Hill transmitter site used by KJQR, the government's radio station, as part of its expansion into AM and FM radio. The new Navy Hill antenna was installed in late 1975, replacing a temporary installation and improving reception on the island, and the radio stations began broadcasting in June 1976, giving listeners a choice. By 1977, the station was not airing Sesame Street or government programming, but it was offering a mix of network and syndicated fare and a 15-minute local newscast on weeknights; most of the network programs and the only network newscasts were from CBS, though ABC and NBC shows also were shown. A Los Angeles Times profile of Saipan in January 1978 described the operation thusly: The station went off air for a time in late 1979 to allow an antenna to be installed to receive programming direct from KUAM-TV on Guam. Plans for expansion were in the offing in November 1980; WSZE-TV was planning to increase its broadcast hours, and it aired coverage of the presidential election from the mainland by satellite after an earth station was completed for the island. Weeks later, however, the station left the air for good after its tower was blown down by Typhoon Dinah; it would have cost $20,000 to $25,000 to reconstruct.

The show is anchored by the network's Senior Anchor and Director for News Content Development, Rico Hizon, who has come home to the Philippines after a 25-year overseas news stint with CNBC Asia and BBC News. Background The half-hour long newscast, which airs at 9pm from Monday to Friday, focuses on the most significant news stories of the day from the Philippines and around the world, as well as segments which also feature the lighter side of the news. Hizon earlier said that the show's formula gives \\"overall view of what‚Äôs happening in the Philippines, around the world, and at the end, give them a sense of hope, inspire them that there is still a light at the end of the tunnel.\\" The show also features live reports from various CNN and CNN International correspondents from across the globe, with prominent ones going live for the newscast such as Nic Robertson, Richard Quest, Matthew Chance, Will Ripley, David Culver, Joe Johns, and Nadia Romero, to name a few. =Special editions= When warranted, The Final Word would air special editions of the newscast. Its first (and only, so far) special edition was during the July 27, 2020 State of the Nation Address of President Rodrigo Duterte, where the newscast aired a special hour-long edition. Correspondents delivered live and packaged reports about the SONA, while BDO's chief market strategist Jonathan Ravelas provided business analysis. Senator Richard Gordon was also interviewed live on the show. The edition was on the heels of Hizon anchoring the network's SONA coverage for the first time, and his first SONA coverage in the Philippines since 1995. Hizon anchored a cumulative 7 hours that day - starting with the network's 2pm coverage where he joined Chief Correspondent and Anchor Pia Hontiveros and Senior Anchor and Correspondent Pinky Webb until the President's speech ended and for a post-SONA analysis with ADR Stratbase analyst Dindo Manhit and former Presidential Spokesperson Edwin Lacierda. COVID-19 pandemic On July 7, 2020, production of The Final Word, alongside many other shows, was temporarily halted due to a coronavirus infection in the network's headquarters in Mandaluyong City.

Its nearest neighbor is Ivins Mountain, one half mile to the north, and South Guardian Angel is set approximately three miles to the west-northwest. Its name was officially adopted in 1935 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. This geographical feature is so named because its broad top has a decided incline. Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into North Creek, a tributary of the Virgin River. Climate Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Inclined Temple. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, it is located in a Cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C), and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer.

He is known for his weapons made in England, which he immigrated to around 1642. He is mostly known as Harman Barnes (or Barne).  Immigration to England  Bernevelt is first mentioned in England in the spring of 1642. He is noted as living in Lambeth at this time. Maps at the time indicate Lambeth was a rural area. Barnevelt likely moved there hurriedly, and seeking obscurity, after a possibly fatal explosion of a magazine firearm he made.  Notable weapons  = Flawed Magazine gun of 1638 = The earliest mention of Armand is on a magazine gun which bears his name, as well as the year 1638. This weapon was a breech loading gun which used a turn-off barrel. It also featured a magazine in the butt, which the breech end of the barrel could be inserted into. A ball and a charge of powder would be loaded into the breech, and the barrel could be removed and screwed back onto the gun. While this allowed fast reloading, it was also very dangerous. After firing the weapon a few times, the barrel became extremely hot, causing ignition of the powder magazine. This is what happened to the gun, as it is missing the lock piece and the butt is damaged. The accident was undoubtedly severe, and possibly killed the user. = Kalthoff-style repeater c. 1650 = A magazine firearm made around 1650 is signed Harman Barne Londini, though lacks marks of proof. It can be assumed Armand made this weapon in London, though it is also possible he imported it from Holland. As Armand made other repeaters with the assistance of Caspar Kalthoff, it seems likely it is his original construction. The weapon llikely did not reach a finished state until 1651, as Barnevelt was in prison for a at least a year after 1649.

Education Alice studied nursing at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, gaining her certificate in 1899 and registration in 1901. She studied for a further qualification on infectious diseases in 1906. The Australian Army Nursing Service reserves was formed in 1902 to provide volunteer civilian nurses in the event of a national emergency, and Alice joined them in 1907. War experiences Enlisting as a nursing sister with the 1st Australian General Hospital on 26 September 1914, Alice sailed with 5 other nurses: Mary Finlay, Evelyn Conyers, Jane Lempriere, Sister Hilda Ridderwold Samsing, and Jessie McHardy White. The nurses sailed with the 8th Battalion (Australia) aboard the HMAT Benalla, on 19 October 1914, arriving in Egypt on 4 December. Alice ended up nursing many men of the 8th as they fought at Gallipoli, and later in France.

At the end of April, after the Gallipoli offensive, wounded soldiers began to arrive in Alexandria. \\"By this time perhaps all the men we looked on as friends have been blotted out of existence. All our leave has been stopped until further notice. Another turmoil of a day. I have charge of 42 officers, some of them good friends. The work is harrowing. If we had been nursing strange troops we may have felt it less, but among our own people the horrors of war are brought home. Almost everyone on the nursing or medical staff has a relation or friend at the front so you dread the latest news‚Ä¶.\\" In May 1915, Matron Bell offered Alice and Hilda Samsing the opportunity to travel back to Australia with convalescent patients. They declined the offer and requested instead a posting to a hospital ship, transporting wounded soldiers away from the front. On June 7 they heard that they were to join the medical crew on HS Gascon. The Gascon ferried wounded soldiers between the Gallipoli Peninsula, field hospitals and permanent hospitals. Alice wrote at this time: \\"One wonders when the awful destruction of life will stop. There seems no safe spot for them anywhere on this rough spot, except in their dugouts. They seem to take their lives in their hands whenever they move about for water food or air or anything‚Ä¶. The crack of rifles and occasionally machine guns are plainly audible. Somehow, we never think of any danger to this boat, and everyone believes the Turks play the game fairly.\\" After the evacuation from Gallipoli in December 1915, Alice returned to nursing in Cairo at Heliopolis.

By September 6, those demonstrations escalated to clashes, with deputies firing projectiles and tear gas at the crowds and arresting 35 people over four nights of unrest.  Death  Two deputies were on patrol in the Westmont neighborhood at around 3:15 p.m. LASD claimed the deputies tried to stop Kizzee, 29, for committing a traffic violation on his bike; but did not disclose what the violation was. Kizzee allegedly dropped the bike and ran a block before deputies caught him. Kizzee allegedly punched one deputy and, as they grappled, \\"he dropped a jacket at which time a black semi-automatic handgun fell to the ground.\\" Deputies opened fired when Kizzee \\"made a motion\\" toward the gun, according to a police statement said; however, the LASD did not state that Kizzee motioned toward the gun until more than 24 hours after the incident.

Huntsman told an emergency town hall meeting of the Civilian Oversight Commission that he had asked sheriff's officials to observe the proceedings.

It centers on a young woman investigating her cousin's claims that her husband is trying to murder her. The novel landed on multiple bestseller lists and Moreno-Garcia's writing has received comparisons to Daphne du Maurier and Guillermo del Toro. Synopsis Noem√≠ Taboada's cousin Catalina has written to her, begging Noem√≠'s help, as she firmly believes that her husband, Virgil Doyle, intends to murder her. Suspecting that Virgil may also be after Catalina's money, Noem√≠ travels to the Doyle home, High Place, which is located in the mountains. Once there, Catalina begs her cousin to seek out a healer living in the small village near the mansion, Marta, and pick up medicine that could save her. Noem√≠ does so, but the medicine instead causes a seizure that keeps her from freely visiting Catalina as frequently. As a result of the decreased visits Noem√≠ spends her time learning about the Doyle family, notably that the family has a history of incestuous marriages, and experiencing strange dreams and visions. She also cultivates a friendship and relationship with one of the Doyles, Francis, who warns her that the family cannot be trusted. When she begins to sleepwalk, Noem√≠ decides that she must leave the Doyle household, only to be told that she cannot leave. They reveal that Virgil's father, Howard, discovered a strain of mushroom that they used to heal themselves and prolong their lives - and that Howard is hundreds of years old. As the fungus's potency is lessened depending on the individual's genetics, the Doyles have intermarried in order to ensure that their offspring can also receive these benefits. Spores from the mushroom are rife throughout the house and can hold memories, which the family refers to as the \\"Gloom\\". The spores can also help the Doyles control people who have inhaled them, which frightens Noem√≠. She grows more horrified, however, when she learns that Howard's wife Agnes was used as a sacrifice to grow the spores - and that Howard can use the gloom to take over the bodies of family members, which he's used to further preserve his own life. The Doyles have found that Noem√≠'s genetics are complementary to theirs and can help perpetuate their bloodline, as the inbreeding has taken its toll on the family, particularly when it comes to producing viable offspring. Howard tells her that she will marry Francis and that after the wedding, he will inhabit Francis's body. They also wish to have access to her money, as the family has become impoverished. Refusing to allow his family to carry out their plans, Francis obtains the medicine Catalina sought out earlier in the novel, as it interferes with the mushroom's abilities. Together the three flee the house and manage to set Agnes's body on fire, presumably killing the rest of the Doyles in the process and setting the entire home on fire. Afterwards Francis, who was wounded during the escape, worries that the fire wasn't enough to completely eliminate the spores and that he should kill himself to ensure that the family curse is truly ended. Noem√≠ shares his concerns, but is optimistic that together they can overcome any potential issues. Release and sales Mexican Gothic was released in hardback and e-book formats in the United States and Canada through Del Rey Books, as well as in the United Kingdom through Jo Fletcher Books, on June 30, 2020.

He had been a professor at the newly founded Ruhr University Bochum since 1964. From 1971, he was director of the in G√∂ttingen. He became known for his research on the Age of Enlightenment.  Life  Born in Wanne-Eickel, the son of a coalminer was the first of his family to attend the Oberrealschule and passed his Abitur in 1941. In the same year, he was called up for military service. As a lieutenant, he was seriously wounded in the battle with American troops at the Moselle in autumn 1944. Vierhaus was captured in Marburg the following year. He spent the following years in military hospitals and clinics. It was not until 1949 that his state of health was reasonably restored. From 1949 he studied history and philosophy at the Westf√§lische Wilhelms-Universit√§t . His academic teachers were Kurt von Raumer, Herbert Grundmann and Joachim Ritter. Vierhaus was also influenced by Werner Conze and his study group for social history. In 1955, Vierhaus received his doctorate under Raumer on the topic Ranke und die soziale Welt. His habilitation was awarded in 1961 on Deutschland im Zeitalter der Aufkl√§rung ‚Äì Untersuchungen zur deutschen Sozialgeschichte im Zeitalter der Aufkl√§rung. The thesis remained unpublished. His most important trains of thought were published in essays in 1965 and 1985, which in turn were published in 1987 in the anthology Deutschland im 18. Jahrhundert ‚Äì Politische Verfassung, soziales Gef√ºge, geistige Bewegungen. From 1961, Vierhaus was a private lecturer in M√ºnster. Several substitute professorships followed. While filling the chair of Franz Schnabel in Munich, he received appointments to Frankfurt and Bochum.

Work  Vierhaus' areas of research were modern history, especially comparative social, constitutional, idea, scientific, educational and cultural history since the early modern period. In his early years, he was particularly concerned with the history of the 19th century, at times also with the German and European development of the early 20th century. In 1960, the edition of the diary of Hildegard von Spitzemberg appeared in the series of German Historical Sources of the 19th and 20th Century. In the 1970s, he increasingly focused on the history of the 17th and 18th centuries. This resulted in the authoritative overall depictions, Deutschland im Zeitalter des Absolutismus (1978) and, as part of the Propyl√§en Geschichte Deutschlands, the Staaten und St√§nde (1984). His studies of the German and European Enlightenment were decisive. Vierhaus pleads for a new cultural history, which he sees as an extension of social history. As a methodological foundation, he recommends the reconstruction of historical life worlds, which he describes in his essay Die Rekonstruktion historischer Lebenswelten. Problems of modern cultural historiography. His main works also include the essay collection Deutschland im 18. Jahrhundert. Politische Verfassung. Soziales Gef√ºge. Geistige Bewegungen (G√∂ttingen 1987) as well as his collected contributions to the history of the 19th and 20th century, which were published on the occasion of his 80th birthday under the title Vergangenheit als Geschichte (G√∂ttingen, 2003). Vierhaus was editor of the Deutsche Biographische Enzyklop√§die from its fourth volume on.
