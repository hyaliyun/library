EGHS is the highest performing public high school in the state. It is the only school in the country with the mascot, the \\"Avengers\\". East Greenwich High School was ranked 259 on Newsweek's list of America's Top 500 High Schools in 2016 out of approximately 31,700 high schools in the United States. It was the only high school in Rhode Island to make the list.  School and campus  East Greenwich High School was founded in 1942. Formerly East Greenwich Academy, East Greenwich High School was located on 100 Cedar Avenue, East Greenwich, RI from 1956 until 1967 when it moved to its current location on Avenger Drive. Its current building was constructed in 1967 and its design was noted by The Architects' Collaborative. It has undergone many improvements to make the building more modern. In 2004, a new state of the art gymnasium was completed. In 2010, a new football field, track, front entrance, science wing, and other various projects were completed. In 2012, the library was completely remodeled. As of the 2008-09 school year, the school had an enrollment of 769 students. As of September 2012, EGHS had a student-teacher ratio of 10:1, according to Rhode Island Monthly magazine. = Curriculum = East Greenwich High School is home to a very diverse curriculum. It offers Spanish, French, and Latin as foreign languages. It also offers more than 150 different electives and many other advanced courses. = Testing scores and statistics = In 2012, East Greenwich High School was declared the top school in Rhode Island. EGHS consistently has top scores in both the NECAP and SAT tests. It has a 98% graduation rate compared to the 84% average in the state. In September 2012, Rhode Island Monthly reported that East Greenwich HS had the state's highest grade 11 NECAP Science scores. EGHS students averaged 1723 out of 2400 on the SAT. In 2014, East Greenwich High School was ranked 824th on Newsweek's list of America's top 1,000 high schools out of approximately 31,700 high schools in the United States.

There have also been several other Avenger individual State and New England champions, All- Americans, as well as athletes who have gone on to compete in NCAA division I, II, and III athletics. East Greenwich High School is the only school in the country nicknamed the Avengers. = Cross Country = Despite only having been re-instated in 2004, boys cross country has been the most successful program at EGHS in recent years, capturing the 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 Class C titles, having the individual champion every year from 2004 to 2008, and in 2013. Class C contains the smallest classification of high schools in Rhode Island. Winning Class C would be the equivalent of winning a state championship in most other sports, since most other sports do not have an all-state championship that combines schools of all sizes. Since 2005, more than 20 different Avenger boys have earned All State honors, and more than 30 have earned All Class honors. Several have earned the honors more than once. Since 2005, EG boys cross country has compiled a regular season record of 103 wins and 14 losses (an 88% win percentage), by far the highest winning percentage of any team at EGHS and one of the best of any team from any sport in the state. Head coach Peter Dion has been selected as the Rhode Island Cross Country Coach of Year three times: 2006, 2007, and 2013. The 2007 boys cross country team defeated Bishop Hendricken in a dual meet, ending the second-longest winning streak in the country. Hendricken had not lost a dual meet since 1978, amassing over 250 consecutive regular season wins. (During that time Hendricken also collected 16 State Championships and 9 New England titles.) Despite being among the five smallest public high schools in the state, the 2007 team was undefeated against Rhode Island schools, won the Division, Class, and State Championships, were runner-up at the New England Championship, and ranked top 10 in the Northeast Region. In 2008, two of the team's runners finished 1st and 3rd at the New England Championship, the best finish ever by teammates in the 85-year history of the race. East Greenwich was the only public school to finish top 6 in Rhode Island every year from 2005 to 2009, qualifying for the New England Championship. (Only larger private schools Hendricken and LaSalle Academy also accomplished this streak). In 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 the boys team was the best public school in the state, finishing 3rd each year behind Hendricken and LaSalle. In 2013, East Greenwich won the Freshman State Championship, their first-ever Freshman title. The girls cross country team has also been successful, having won 9 of the past 15 Class C Championships before being moved up to Class B in 2012. They were state runners-up in 1997 and 1998, and had EG's only individual state champion, Nicole Millette, in 2002.

Covering letter  The pamphlet was created for circulation to the British and Indian delegates to the Third Round Table Conference in London in 1933. It was addressed with a covering letter dated 28 January 1933 signed by Rahmat Ali alone, and addressed from 3 Humberstone Road. It states: > I am enclosing herewith an appeal on behalf of the thirty million Muslims of > PAKSTAN, who live in the five Northern Units of India‚ÄîPunjab, North-West > Frontier (Afghan) Province, Kashmir, Sind, and Baluchistan. It embodies > their demand for the recognition of their national status, as distinct from > the other inhabitants of India, by the grant to Pakstan of a separate > Federal Constitution on religious, social and historical grounds.  Now or Never; Are We to Live or Perish Forever?  The pamphlet started with this famous sentence:\\"Now or Never; Are We to Live or Perish Forever?\\" > At this solemn hour in the history of India, when British and Indian > statesmen are laying the foundations of a Federal Constitution for that > land, we address this appeal to you, in the name of our common heritage, on > behalf of our thirty million Muslim brethren who live in PAKSTAN‚Äîby which we > mean the five Northern units of India, Viz: Punjab, North-West Frontier > Province (Afghan Province), Kashmir, Sindh and Baluchistan. The pamphlet asked that \\"the five Northern units of India\\"‚ÄîPunjab, North-West Frontier Province (Afghan Province), Kashmir, Sindh (then part of Bombay and Sind) and Baluchistan (or Pakstan)THE HISTORY MAN: Cambridge Remembers Rahmat Ali ‚Äì Ihsan Aslam ‚Äì Daily Times become a state independent of the proposed Indian Federation. Ali's pamphlet had a clear and succinct description of the Muslims of his proposed 'Pakstan' as a 'nation', which later formed the foundation for the two-nation theory of the All-India Muslim League: Ali believed that the delegates of the first and second Round Table Conferences committed 'an inexcusable blunder and an incredible betrayal' by accepting the principle of an All-India Federation. He demanded that the national status of the 30 million Muslims of the northwestern units be recognized and a separate Federal Constitution be granted to them. Professor K. K. Aziz writes that \\"Rahmat Ali alone drafted this declaration.\\"Now or Never; Are We to Live or Perish Forever?\\" The word Pakstan was used for the first time in this pamphlet. To make it \\"representative\\", he looked for people who would sign it along with him. This difficult search among the firm grip of 'Indianism' on the young intellectual at English universities took him more than a month to find three young men in London who offered to support and sign it. After the publication of the pamphlet, the Hindu press vehemently criticized it, and the word \\"Pakstan\\" used in it. Thus this word became a heated topic of debate. With the addition of an \\"i\\" to improve the pronunciation, the name of Pakistan grew in popularity and led to the commencement of the Pakistan Movement, and consequently the creation of Pakistan as an independent state in 1947. Aftermath In later pamphlets, other than Pakistan, Chaudhry also suggested the establishment of several other Muslim states within the subcontinent such as Bangistan and Osmanistan. He suggested the former Muslim provinces of Eastern Bengal and Assam in East India become Bangistan, an independent Muslim state for Bengali, Assamese and Bihari speaking Muslims. He also suggested the princely state of Hyderabad become an Islamic monarchy called Osmanistan. After the Muslim League's acceptance of the British partition plan on 3 June 1947 he issued a statement six days later called \\"The Great Betrayal\\" in asking for the rejection of the British plan and the acceptance of his Pakistan plan. He was unhappy over a smaller Pakistan than the one he had conceived in his 1933 pamphlet Now or Never. He condemned Jinnah for accepting a smaller Pakistan, and is said to have called him \\"Quisling-e-Azam\\". In the end the British plan was accepted, and Ali's was rejected. Ali had been voicing his dissatisfaction with the creation of Pakistan ever since. Mian Abdul Haq, a contemporary of Rahmat Ali at the University of Cambridge, stated that, after 1935, Rahmat Ali's mental makeup changed resulting from a study of \\"major Nazi works, of which he knew many passages by heart\\".  Author  The author of this famous pamphlet was Chaudhary Rahmat Ali (16 November 1897 ‚Äì 3 February 1951), a Muslim nationalist from Punjab, who was one of the earliest proponents of the creation of the state of Pakistan. He is credited with creating the name \\"Pakistan\\" for a separate Muslim homeland from Presidencies and provinces of British India. He had propagated the Scheme of Pakistan with a missionary zeal since its inception in 1933. He also later founded the Pakistan National Movement to propagate his ideas. Being a political thinker and an idealist, wanted more than for accepting a smaller Pakistan in 1947Aziz 1987, pp. 319‚Äì338 and save every Indian Muslim from the so-called \\"Hindu domination\\". After the partition and creation of Pakistan in 1947, Ali returned to Lahore, planning to stay in the country, but he was expelled out of Pakistan by the then Prime Minister Liaqat Ali Khan. His belongings were confiscated, and he left empty-handed for England in October 1948. Ali died on 3 February 1951 in Cambridge. According to Thelma Frost, he was \\"destitute, forlorn and lonely\\" at the time of his death. Fearing (correctly) that he may have died insolvent, the Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, Edward Welbourne, instructed that the College would cover the funeral expenses. He was buried on 20 February at Cambridge City Cemetery in Cambridge, England. The funeral expenses and other medical expenses were repaid by the High Commissioner for Pakistan in November 1953, after what was described as a ‚Äúprotracted correspondence‚Äù between the London office and the relevant authorities in Pakistan.Emmanuel College Cambridge Archives  Notes References=CitationsSources=  * External links * Category:Pakistan Movement Category:Pamphlets Category:Political terminology in Pakistan Category:Pakistani documents Category:Pakistani philosophical literature Category:1933 non-fiction books Category:1933 in India Category:1930s in British India ","title":"Pakistan Declaration"},{"id":"15069133","text":"Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3A, also known as APOBEC3A, or A3A is a gene of the APOBEC3 family found in humans, non-human primates, and some other mammals. It is a single-domain DNA cytidine deaminase with antiviral effects. While other members of the family such as APOBEC3G are believed to act by editing ssDNA by removing an amino group from cytosine in DNA, introducing a cytosine to uracil change which can ultimately lead to a cytosine to thymine mutation, one study suggests that APOBEC3A can inhibit parvoviruses by another mechanism. The cellular function of APOBEC3A is likely to be the destruction of foreign DNA through extensive deamination of cytosine. This gene is a member of the polynucleotide cytosine deaminase gene family. It is one of seven related genes or pseudogenes found in a cluster, thought to result from gene duplication, on chromosome 22. Members of the cluster encode proteins that are structurally and functionally related to the C to U RNA-editing cytidine deaminase APOBEC1. The APOBEC3 family of DNA editing enzymes are thought to be part of the innate immune system by restricting retroviruses, mobile genetic elements like retrotransposons and endogenous retroviruses. In addition, APOBEC3A is an important restrictive factor for HIV-1 and other lentiviruses found in primates. APOBEC3A is highly expressed in monocytes and macrophages upon stimulation with interferon.  Structure  The basic structure APOBEC3A consists of a 5 stranded central Œ≤-sheet surrounded by 6 Œ±-helices and a single catalytically active zinc finger domain. Similar to all APOBEC3 catalytic domains, the domain is a HAEx28Cx2-4C zinc binding motif. In such motifs, histidine and cytosine residues coordinate the zinc ion while a glutamic acid stabilizes the transition state and the proton shuttle. The zinc ion is specifically coordinated by residues H70, C101 and C106. = A3A-ssDNA structure = Single stranded DNA, abbreviated ssDNA, is the substrate that is catalyzed in the C‚ÜíU deamination reaction of APOBEC3A.  Activity  A3A has the highest catalytic activity among the APOBEC3 protein family. = mRNA editing activity = A3A was first found to induce an alternative form of the mRNA editing, G>A, in Wilms' Tumor-1 (WT1) mRNA in cord blood mononuclear cells, particularly in the genomic polymorphic sites, apparently reflecting an amination process rather than a de-amination one. This was soon followed by a study showing A3A induce canonical wide-spread C>U mRNA editing in human monocytes and macrophages. = Effect of pH on APOBEC3A = APOBEC3A functions best at an acidic pH, with maximal catalytic activity at pH 5.5. Another protein of the APOBEC family very similar to A3A, APOBEC3B, showed little activity at pH 4.5 and 4.0 and a similar assumption can be made of A3A activity at these lower pH levels. A3A affinity for ssDNA is also pH dependent and closely correlated to the deamination activity of APOBEC3A. The enzyme has the highest affinity for ssDNA at pH 5.5 demonstrating that A3A's maximal catalytic activity and highest affinity for ssDNA occur at a similar pH.  Mechanism of Action  A3A has become an increasingly widely studied A3 because of its high catalytic activity compared to its family members and its relatively unknown mechanisms compared to more popular APOBEC3's such as APOBEC3G. = Context dependent binding to ssDNA = The binding of APOBEC3A to its substrate ssDNA is highly dependent on its surrounding nucleotides. The specificity for binding to its target deoxycytidine increases more than ten-fold when the target deoxycytidine is surrounded by deoxythymidine nucleotides.

At the time of the removal of its license it was the most listened to local station in the Republic of Ireland, with a daily listenership figure of 64%. The decision to give the license to Ocean FM was a controversial one and split the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) three votes to three, with the chair casting the deciding vote in favour of the new station. The Commission argued that it had done so because the link up between NWR and MWR meant that not enough programmes were being produced by N.W.R. and that the station did little to attract younger listeners.Western People: Reasons for removing North West Radio‚Äôs license beggars belief These claims were denied by the CEO of NWR and MWR, Paul Claffey, who said that it amounted to Dublin telling people in the north west what kind of station they should listen to.Western People - 2003/05/07: NW Radio stunned by loss of license The decision was also unpopular with many of the residents of Counties Sligo and Leitrim, and a group to save the station was established and around 5,000 marched on the D√°il in Dublin demanding a reversal of the awarding of the license away from NWR.NWR Protests Many people in the south of County Donegal would have preferred to have received Highland Radio from Letterkenny instead of N.W.R., or Ocean FM, for that matter, from Sligo Town.

The Philippine Organic Act (c. 1369, ) was a basic law for the Insular Government that was enacted by the United States Congress on July 1, 1902. It is also known as the Philippine Bill of 1902 and the Cooper Act, after its author Henry A. Cooper. The approval of the act coincided with the official end of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Overview The Philippine Organic Act provided for the creation of an elected Philippine Assembly after the following conditions were met: # the cessation of the existing insurrection in the Philippine Islands; # completion and publication of a census; and # two years of continued peace and recognition of the authority of the United States of America after the publication of the census. After the convening of the Assembly, legislative power shall then be vested in a bicameral legislature composed of the Philippine Commission as the upper house and the Philippine Assembly as the lower house. Supervision of the islands was assigned to the War Department's Bureau of Insular Affairs. Other key provisions included: * a bill of rights for the Filipinos, * the appointment of two Filipino nonvoting Resident Commissioners to represent the Philippines in the United States Congress, and * the disestablishment of the Roman Catholic Church. * conservation of natural resources for the Filipinos * exercise of executive power by the civil governor who would have several executive departments * establishment of the Philippine Assembly to be elected by the Filipinos two years after the publication of a census and only after peace had been restored completely in the country This act was superseded by the Philippine Autonomy Act, or the Jones Law, enacted on August 29, 1916. Background The act was preceded by the Spooner Amendment to the Army Appropriations Act of 1901 (, 910, enacted ) which had provided that: > ... all military, civil, and judicial powers necessary to govern the > Philippine Islands ... shall until otherwise provided by Congress be vested > in such person and persons, and shall be exercised in such manner, as the > President of the United States shall direct, for the establishment of civil > government, and for maintaining and protecting the inhabitants of said > Islands in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and religion. This was complemented by a cable from the Secretary of War Elihu Root to the Philippine Commission on :Report, Secretary of War, 1901, p. 54. > Until further orders government will continue under existing instructions > and orders. The comprehensive Spooner Amendment, and these instructions and orders, virtually constituted for many months the charter of government for the Philippine Islands.Cincinnati Soap Co. v. U.S., 301 U.S. 308 (1937) Between September 1900 and August 1902, the Second Philippine Commission (the Taft Commission) issued 499 laws. Implementation The act was enacted into law on July 1, 1902, and the Philippine Commission executed its provisions. A census was conducted in 1903, and published on March 25, 1905. The Philippine Assembly elections of 1907 were held on July 30, 1907, for 80 seats, and on October 16, 1907, the 1st Philippine Legislature was inaugurated at the Manila Grand Opera House. As a result of the act, the Catholic Church agreed to gradually substitute Spanish priests with Filipinos and to sell its land. It refused however to send the friars immediately back to Spain. In 1904, the American administration bought 166,000 hectares, a major part of the friars' holding, over half of which was in the Manila area, and the land was resold to Filipinos--some of them tenants but the majority of them estate owners.

This genus occurs essentially worldwide. These flies are generally well-sized and of a greyish color; like many of their relatives, the typical patterns are lengthwise darker stripes on the thorax and dark and light square dots on the abdomen. Many have conspicuous red compound eyes. These are set further apart in females than in males; the females are also larger on average. As typical for this family, it is almost impossible to tell the species apart from their outward appearance, and many can only be reliably identified by microscopic examination of the males' genitalia. As the common name implies, their larvae typically feed on decaying meat. Some, however, rather eat the bacteria and other small organisms living on carrion. Many species have adapted to humans, and while they are usually nuisance pests, some are medically significant vectors of pathogens and bacteria. Sometimes, the larvae cause myiasis. Others are parasitoids of pest caterpillars and beneficial in forestry and orchards. Well-known species are Sarcophaga africa, Sarcophaga bercaea, the grey flesh-fly Sarcophaga bullata, Sarcophaga carnaria, Sarcophaga crassipalpis, the friendly fly Sarcophaga aldrichi and the red-tailed flesh-fly Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as co-receptors for numerous heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines and are involved in cell signaling. Heparan sulfate 6-O-endo-sulfatases, such as SULF1, selectively remove 6-O-sulfate groups from heparan sulfate. This activity modulates the effects of heparan sulfate by altering binding sites for signaling molecules.  Function  Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are widely expressed throughout most tissues of nearly all multicellular species. The function of HSPGs extends beyond providing an extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and scaffold for cells. They are integral regulators of essential cell signaling pathways affecting cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Although the core protein is important, the large heparan sulfate (HS) chains extending from the core are responsible for most receptor signaling. HS chains are heterogeneous structures that differ in specific and conditional cell contexts. Of particular importance is the HS sulfation pattern, which was once thought to be static after HS biosynthesis in the Golgi. However, this paradigm changed after the discovery of two extracellular 6-O-S glucosamine arylsulfatases, Sulf1 and Sulf2. These two enzymes allow rapid extracellular modification of sulfate content in HSPGs, impacting signaling involving Shh, Wnt, BMP, FGF, VEGF, HB-EGF, GDNF, and HGF. In addition, Sulfs may exercise another level of regulation over HS composition by down or upregulating HS biosynthetic enzymes present in the Golgi through the very same signaling pathways they modify.  Discovery  Before the cloning and characterization of Sulf1 and Sulf2, HS composition was thought to be unchanging after localization to the cell surface. However, this changed when the quail orthologue of Sulf1, QSulf1, was identified in a screen for Sonic hedgehog (Shh) response genes activated during somite formation in quail embryos. Sequence alignment analysis indicates QSsulf1 is homologous with lysosomal N-acetyl glucosamine sulfatases (G6-sulfatases) that catalyze the hydrolysis of 6-O sulfates from N-acetyl glucosamines of heparan sulfate during the degradation of HSPGs. In contrast to lysosomal active sulfatases, QSulf1 localizes exclusively to the cell surface by interacting hydrophilically with a non-heparan sulfate outer membrane component, and is enzymatically active at a neutral pH. By mutating the catalytically active cysteines to alanine, thereby blocking N-formylglycine formation, they found QSulf1 was responsible for Wingless (Wnt) release from HS chains to activate the Frizzled receptor; this was the first evidence that an extracellular sulf was capable of modifying HS and therefore cell signaling. The overall structure of QSulf is followed closely by its orthologues and paralogues, including human and mouse. The human and murine orthologues of QSulf1, HSulf1 and MSulf1, respectively, were cloned and characterized after the discovery of QSulf1. In addition, a paralogue, Sulf2, sharing 63-65% identity (both mouse and human) with Sulf1 also was discovered through BLAST sequence analysis. The HSulf1 gene (GenBank accession number AY101175) has an open reading frame of 2616 bp, encoding a protein of 871 amino acid (aa), and HSulf2 (GenBank accession number AY101176) has an open reading frame of 2613 bp, encoding a protein of 870 aa. The HSulf1 and 2 genes localize to 8q13.2-13.3 and 20q13.12, respectively. They contain putative Asn-linked glycosylation sites, and furin cleavage sites responsible for proteolytic processing in the Golgi. The function or substrate specificity these cleavage sites impart has yet to be determined. Validation of the predicted N-linked glycosylation sites on QSulf1 were performed using tunicamycin and QSulf1 variants missing the N-terminal (catalytic) domain or HD, which contain predicted N-linked glycosylation sites. The N- and C-terminal showed unbranched N-linked glycosylation, but was absent in the hydrophilic domain even though it contains two putative sites. In addition, O-linked or sialylated glycosylation were not present in QSulf1. Importantly, proper glycosylation is necessary to localize to the cell surface, possibly to bind HS moieties, and was required for enzymatic activity.  Structure and mechanism  Sulf1 and Sulf2 are new members of a superfamily of arylsulfatases, being closely related to arylsulfatase A, B (ARSA; ARSB) and glucosamine 6-sulfatase (G6S). The x-ray crystal structure of neither Sulf1 or Sulf2 has been attempted, but ARSA active site crystal structure was deciphered. In ARSA, the conserved cysteine, which is posttranslationally modified to a C alpha formylglycine (FG) is critical for catalytic activity. In the first step, one of the two oxygens of the aldehyde hydrate attacks the sulfur of the sulfate ester. This leads to a transesterification of the sulfate group onto the aldehyde hydrate. Simultaneously the substrate alcohol is released. In the second step, sulfate is eliminated from the enzyme-sulfate intermediate by an intramolecular rearrangement. The ‚Äúintramolecular hydrolysis‚Äù allows the aldehyde group to be regenerated. The active site of ARSA contains nine conserved residues that were found to be critical for catalytic activity. Some residues, such as Lys123 and Lys302, bind the substrate while others either participate in catalysis directly, such as His125 and Asp281, or indirectly. In addition a magnesium ion is needed to coordinate the oxygen that attacks the sulfur in the first step of sulfate cleavage. The crystal structure and residue mutations need to be performed in Sulf1 and Sulf2 to determine if any differences exist from lysosomal sulfatases.  Enzymatic specificity  HS enzymatic specificity of QSulf1 was first analyzed. QSulf1 enzymatic specificity on 6-O sulfates was linked to the trisulfated disaccharides (HexA,2SGlcNS,6S) in S domains of HS (HS regions where most of the GlcNS residues are in contiguous sequences) and not NA/NS domains (regions of alternating N-acetylated and N-sulfated units; transition zones). Sulf1 and 2 null murine embryonic fibroblasts were generated to test the HS specificity of mammalian Sulf as opposed to avian Sulf (QSulf). Investigators found mSulf1‚àí/‚àí;mSulf2‚àí/‚àí HS showed overall large increases in all 6S disaccharides. Cooperativity between mSulf1/2 was found because a 2-fold increase in S-domain-associated disaccharides (UA‚ÄìGlcNS(6S) and UA(2S)‚ÄìGlcNS(6S)) was observed in double knock-out HS as compared with either single knock-out HS alone. However, one difference from mSulf1 is that mSulf2‚àí/‚àí HS shows an increase in 6S almost exclusively within the non- sulfated and transition zones. This sulfation effect on non-sulfated and transition zones is also different from QSulfs, which catalyze desulfation exclusively in S-domains. Although 6S changes were dominant, other small changes in NS and 2S sulfation do occur in the Sulf knock out MEFs, which may be a compensatory mechanism. Further biochemical studies elucidated specificity and localization of human Sulfs 1 and 2. Sulf1 and 2 hydrophilic domains associate with the cell membrane components through electrostatic interactions and not by integration with into the lipid bilayer. In addition to cell membrane association, Sulfs also secreted freely into the media, which contrasts the findings with QSulf1 and 2. Biochemical analysis of HSPGs in Sulf 1 and 2 knockout MEFS reveal enzyme specificities to disulfated and, primarily, trisulfated 6S disaccharide units UA-GlcNS(6S) and UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S) within the HS chain, with specific exclusion of monosulfated disaccharide units. In vivo studies, however, demonstrate that loss of Sulf1 and Sulf2 result in sulfation changes of nonsubstrates (UA-GlcNAc(6S), N and 2-O Sulfate), indicating Sulf modulates HS biosynthetic machinery. This was further demonstrated by PCR analysis, showing dynamic changes in HS biosynthesis enzymes after Sulf1 and 2 loss. Also, the authors showed in an MEF model system, that Sulf1 and Sulf2 definitively and differentially modify HS proteoglycan fractions including cell surface, GPI-anchored (glypican), shed, and ECM-associated proteoglycans.  Role in cancer The next section gives a detailed description of Sulf1 and Sulf2‚Äôs involvement in cancer. Much of what is known about signaling pathways mediated by Sulfs has been determined through investigating extracellular Sulf role and function in cancer. Therefore, they will be described in tandem. Additionally, this emphasizes how small changes in HS sulfation patterns have major impacts in health and disease. = Ovarian Cancer = The first signs of Sulf1 dysregulation were found in ovarian cancer. The expression of Sulf1 mRNA was found to be downregulated or absent in a majority of ovarian cancer specimens. The same investigators also found lowered mRNA expression in breast, pancreatic, and hepatic malignant cell lines. This absent or hypomorhic Sulf1 expression results in highly sulfated HSPGs. The lack of Sulf1 expression also augments heparin binding-epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) response by way of greater EGF Receptor (EGFR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, which are common signatures of ovarian cancer. Even further, Sulf1 N-terminal sulfatase actitivity was specifically required for cisplatin- induced apoptosis of the ovarian cancer cell line, OV207. The mechanism by which Sulf1 is downregulated in ovarian cancer was investigated. Epigenetic silencing of CpG sites within Sulf1 exon 1A by methylation is associated with ovarian cancer cells and primary ovarian cancer tissues lacking Sulf1 expression. Furthermore, CpG sites showed increased levels of histone H3 K9 methylation in Sulf1 negative ovarian cancer cell lines. = Breast Cancer = Breast cancer expression of Sulf1 at the mRNA level was shown to be downregulated. Investigations into this relationship revealed that angiogenesis in breast cancer was shown to be regulated in part by Sulf1. Breast cancer xenografts overexpressing Sulf1 in athymic mice showed marked decreases in angiogenesis. Specifically, Sulf1 inhibited the ability of vascular endothelial cell heparan sulfate to participate in complex formation with FGF-2, thereby abolishing growth signaling. FGF-2 is a HB-GF, requiring the formation of a ternary complex with HS and the FGF Receptor (FGFR) to cause receptor dimerization, activation, and autophosphorylation, which then leads to induction of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (in addition to other pathways). This results in several responses including cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Importantly, this response is dependent upon the degree and signature of HS-GAG sulfation. To further validate the response in breast cancer, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), overexpressing Sulf1 inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165) signaling which is dependent upon HS, but not HS-independent VEGF121. Sulf2 also was implicated in breast cancer. In contrast to Sulf1, Sulf2 was upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in tumor tissue in two mammary carcinoma mouse models. Sulf1 displays regulation of amphiregulin and HB-EGF-mediated autocrine and paracrine signaling in breast cancer. Loss of Sulf1 in a breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468, shows increased ERK1/2 and EGFR activation, which was shown to be mediated by HB-EGF and amphiregulin, which require complexes with specifically sulfated HS. Breast cancer samples show loss of Sulf1 expression in invasive lobular carcinomas. These carcinomas are predominantly, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, and HER-2, p53, and EGFR-negative (markers indicating increased aggressiveness of breast cancer), but do not confer an increased survival. The authors suggest that enhanced amphiregulin and HB-EGF signaling due to a lack of Sulf1, and therefore oversulfation of HS, may make lobular carcinomas more aggressive than expected. The mechanism by which Sulf1 is downregulated in breast cancer (and gastric cancer) was further investigated. The authors found aberrant hypermethylation of the Sulf1 promoter in both breast cancer and gastric cancer cell lines and patient samples, leading to a reduction of Sulf1 expression, which is similar to ovarian cancer. Despite this evidence, disagreements are found in the literature regarding the role of Sulf in breast cancer. In contrast to previous reports, Sulf1 transcript expression was highly upregulated in invasive ductal carcinoma with respect to confined ductal carcinoma in situ. The authors, therefore, propose that Sulf1 is involved in the acquisition of the capacity to invade adjacent tissues in ductal carcinoma in situ. = Hepatocellular Carcinoma = Cancer cell lines with downregulation of Sulf1 were investigated in the same fashion as ovarian cancer. Nine of 11 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines displayed either absent or severely reduced levels of Sulf1 mRNA. Less than half of HCC tumor samples showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and DNA methylation inhibition treatment of Sulf1 absent HCC cell lines reactivated the expression of Sulf1, indicating hypermethylation may be partly responsible for its downregulation. As in ovarian cancer, loss of Sulf1 largely contributed to decreased HPSG sulfation in HCC. In addition, Sulf1 expression is required to suppress sustained activation of ERK1/2 and c-met by the heparin binding growth factors (HB-GF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), thereby decreasing cell proliferation. In extension, Sulf1 mediated HCC cell apoptotic sensitivity to cisplatin and staurosporine. As a review, HGF, or scatter factor, activates its receptor c-Met which activates mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and PI3K signaling that are ultimately responsible for expression of proangiogenic factors, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The HGF/c-Met axis mediates the invasive growth phenotype necessary for metastasis through coordination of cell motility and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM). In vivo studies on HCC found Sulf1 overexpressing HCC xenografts displayed delayed tumor growth in mice, and the mechanism involves inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC). Sulf1 enhances acetylation of Histone H4 by inhibiting HDAC, which subsequently inhibits the activation of the MAPK and Akt pathways ultimately decreasing HCC tumorogenesis. Sulf2‚Äôs role in HCC contrasted with Sulf1. Sulf2 was upregulated in a majority of HCCs and HCC cell lines, and Sulf2 knockdown eliminated migration and proliferation. Sulf2 also upregulated glypican-3, which is commonly overexpressed in HCC, by increasing ERK, AKT activation through enhanced FGF2 signaling. GPC3 is important in Sulf2-enhanced FGF signaling in vitro, so glypican-3 may mediate its own upregulation through Sulf2. Given that Sulf1 and Sulf2 have redundant functions, Sulf2 contrasting function in HCC was unexpected. = Pancreatic Cancer = Sulf1 mRNA expression in pancreatic cancer differed from ovarian and liver cancer. Only 50% of pancreatic cancer cell lines tested exhibited a significant decrease in Sulf1. Further, in situ hybridization demonstrated that Sulf1 mRNA expression was not uniformly absent in pancreatic cancer tissue. In fact, Sulf1 was present weakly in normal acinar cells, but present at high levels in the endothelium and malignant cells in pancreatic cancer tissue (Li, Kleeff et al. 2005). This indicates that downregulation of Sulf1 is not a ubiquitous process in carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, endogenous expression of Sulf1 in a Sulf1-negative pancreatic cancer cell line, PANC-1, inhibited FGF-2 signaling, but did not affect HB-EGF, EGF, or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling, indicating cell specific effects. In further contrast to ovarian cancer and HCC, Hsulf-1 expressing Panc-1 cells were more resistant to gemcitabine, suggesting Hsulf-1 over-expression might confer increased chemoresistance, and therefore a growth advantage, to pancreatic cancer cells. In further reports Sulf1 displays a complicated expression pattern in pancreatic cancer that is more than merely up or downregulation. For instance, primary pancreatic cancer show higher sulfated HSPGs indicating a lack of Sulf1, but upon metastasis sulfation of HSPGs is reduced. Corroborating patient data were mouse tumor in vivo studies of Sulf1 overexpressing Panc-1 cells showing decreased growth, but increased local invasiveness. = Other Cancers = In vivo studies were used to investigate HSulf1 and 2 in myeloma. Myeloma cells overexpressing Sulf1 and 2 were subcutaneously injected in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Enhanced Sulf expression markedly inhibited growth of these tumors with respect to the control. Again, FGF-2 signaling and subsequent phosphorylation of ERK was attenuated in vitro by both Sulf1 and Sulf2 expression. Sulf1/2 expression resulted in more ECM (collagen fibril deposition) than control tumors, which may be another mechanism by which Sulfs slow down tumor growth. The authors also find Sulf1/2 specifically acts on HS-GAGs on the surface of tumor cells and not in the surrounding stroma, which consequently acts to block FGF-2/FGFR/HS ternary complex formation and inhibition of a downstream signal. Squamous cell head and neck carcinoma (SCCHN) has three cell lines lacking Sulf1 expression. Transfected-in Sulf1 expression reduces FGF-2 and HGF-mediated phosphorylation and activation of ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. Without these active pathways, a marked decreased in proliferation and mitogenecity is observed. Sulf1 expression even attenuates cell motility and invasion mediated by HGF, implicating Sulf1 loss in metastasis.  Animal models  In addition to cancer, Sulf1 and Sulf2 were studied with respect to normal development including neural, muscle, vasculogenesis and skeletal development. Recently, much of what is known was from studies on Sulf1/2 knockout mice. = Skeletal Development = Through common genetrapping mechanisms, homozygous MSulf2 mice were created to assess the in vivo phenotypic traits. Strain specific nonpenetrant lethality resulted (48% fewer than expected), pups were smaller, and some lung defects were observed, but MSulf2-/- were largely as healthy and viable as wild type litter mates. MSulf2 nulls indicate MSulf1 and MSulf2 may have overlapping functions in regulating sulfation patterns in HSPGs. Given that MSulf2 null mice did not present major abnormal phenotypes double MSulf1/2 knockouts were generated. Again, MSulf1 and MSulf2 nulls individually did not display damaging phenotypes; however MSulf-/-;MSulf2-/- mice showed highly penetrant perinatal lethality. However, some double null mice survived into adulthood, and displayed smaller stature, skeletal lesions, and unusually small but functioning kidneys. The skeletal lesions (axial and appendicular skeleton showing decreases in ossified bone volume; sternal fusion and defective basisphenoid patterning) display similar phenotype to heparan sulfate 2-O-transferase (Hs2st)-deficient mice, BMP deficient mice and hypermorphic Fgfr1 and 3 mice. This provides evidence that Sulf1 and 2 is linked to HS modulation effecting BMP and FGF. In addition, this confirms that Sulf1 and 2 perform overlapping functions, but are needed for survival. Further studies on MSulf1-/-;MSulf2-/- mice extended the role of Sulfs in skeletal development. Double nulls displayed reduced bone length, premature ossification, and sternum and tail vertebrae fusion (Ratzka, Kalus et al. 2008). Also, the zone of proliferating chondrocytes was reduced by 90%, indicating defects in chondrogenesis. The important role Sulf1 and Sulf2 in skeletal development is not surprising given its regulation of bone-related growth factors. For example, QSulf1 reduces specific HS 6-O sulfation which releases Noggin, an inhibitor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), allowing cells to become BMP-4 responsive. Therefore, this directly links Sulf1 to the complex developmental patterning mediated by BMPs. Wnt signaling also is regulated by QSulf1. Investigators found lowered Wnt activation through the Frizzled receptor in the absence of QSulf1 expression in non-expressing embryonic cells. 6-O sulfate HS binds with highly affinity to Wnt, abrogating receptor activation. QSulf1 is required to desulfate 6-O chains, not entirely releasing Wnt but lowering the affinity with HS. This low affinity complex then binds and activates the Frizzled receptor. Additional studies emphasized the role of Sulfs in chondrogenesis. The role of QSulf1 was determined in quail cartilage development and joint formation because of its association with chondrogenic growth factor signaling (Wnt and BMP). Sulf1 was expressed highly in condensing mesenchyme and, in cell culture, caused prechondrocytes to differentiate into chondrocytes, indicating QSulf1 is needed for early chondrogenesis. QSulf1 displayed perichondrial staining during early development but was downregulated during later stages of development. In addition, QSulf1 shows transient expression in the early joint line followed by its rapid loss of expression in later stages of joint development, suggesting it would have an inhibitory effect in later joint development. Because Sulfs were important in normal chondrogenesis, they were investigated in cartilage diseases. Expression patterns of Sulf1 and Sulf2 were determined in normal and osteoarthritic (AO) cartilage. Both Sulf1 and Sulf2 showed enhanced expression in OA and aging cartilage. Given several HSPGs (perlecan, syndecan 1/3, glypican) are upregulated and growth factor signaling through FGF-2, Wnt, BMP, and Noggin are modulated in OA, Sulfs and the modifications of HS may mediate an entirely new level of control over OA development. = Nervous System Development = Sulf null mice and other model systems implicated Sulfs in other developmental and disease systems. For example, studies detected esophageal defects in surviving MSulf-/-;MSulf2-/- adult mice. Specifically, esophagi had impaired smooth muscle contractility with reduced neuronal innervation and enteric glial cell numbers. It was postulated to be mediated by decreased glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which is responsible for neurite sprouting in the embryonic esophagus. Sulf expression is not obligatory for GDNF signaling, but it does enhance the signal greatly. MSulf1 and 2 are believed to decrease 6-O sulfation, releasing GDNF from HS to bind and activate its receptor, thereby mediating its effects on esophageal innervation. Sulf1 even functions in basic neural development. Sulf1 modulation of HS chains sulfation is critical in nervous system development. Specifically, Sufl1 expression leads to the switch of ventral neural progenitor cells toward an oligodendroglial fate by modulating Shh distribution and increasing signaling on apical neuroepithelial cells. = Muscle Development and Other Regulation = Sulf1 and 2 also display regulation over muscle development, angiogenesis, leukocyte rolling and wound healing. In adult mice, Sulf1 and Sulf2 have overlapping functions in regulating muscle regeneration. Functionally, Sulfs cooperatively desulfate HS 6-O present on activated satellite cells to suppress FGF2 signaling and therefore promote myogenic differentiation to regenerate muscle. Because of this role, Sulfs may have a direct role in diseases such as muscular dystrophy. QSulf1 was used as a tool to either decrease sulfation of HS or increase sulfation by employing a dominant negative QSulf1 (DNQSulf1). Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are highly influenced by degrees of HS sulfation. Overexpression of QSulf1 decreased adhesion, and increased proliferation and apoptosis of VSMC, while DNQSulf1 also decreased adhesion and increased proliferation, apoptosis, migration and chemotaxis of VSMC. Displaying cell specific effects, both overexpression of Sulf1 and DNQSulf1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in VSMCs, a different response from cancer cell lines. Essentially, these experiments display that a fine-tuned 6-O sulfation pattern is needed for proper function of VSMCs. Sulf2 was investigated with respect to angiogenesis in a chick model. In contrast to Sulf1, Sulf2 actually induced angiogenesis in a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Sulf2 was measured for its ability to modulate binding of growth factors to trisulfated disaccharide motif heparin and HS. Sulf2 inhibited both pre- and post-binding of VEGF165, FGF-1, and SDF-1, a HS-binding chemokine, to both heparin and HS. Investigators hypothesize that Sulf-2 may mobilize ECM- sequestered angiogenic factors, increasing their bioavailability to endothelial cells that express the appropriate receptors. Investigators found that HSPGs such as perlecan and collagen type XVIII are modified during human renal ischemia/reperfusion, which is associated with severe endothelial damage. Vascular basement membrane (BM) HSPGs are modified to bind L-selectin and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) during leukocyte infiltration. Specifically, they require 6-0 sulfation to bind HS chains. The authors show evidence and propose that Sulf1 is usually present on microvascular BM but is downregulated to allow resulfation of 6-O HS for binding of L-selectin and MCP-1. This in turn implicates Sulf1 in human renal allograft rejection which is highly dependent upon HSPG function in peritubular capillaries. Finally, in a transcriptome wide assay in chronic wound, fortyfold higher expression Sulf1 was noted in wound-site vessels. This increase was attributed to its ability to inhibit angiogenesis as it had in breast cancer models.

It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types. ODIN is known to regulate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EphA receptor signaling pathways. As a Src family kinase target, ODIN has been implicated in the development of cancer. The ANKS1A gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Structure = Gene = The ANKS1A gene resides on chromosome 6 at the band 6p21.31 and includes 29 exons. This gene produces 2 isoforms through alternative splicing. = Protein = ODIN is a member of the ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain-containing (ANKS) family and contains 6 ankyrin repeats, 1 phosphotyrosine binding (PTD) domain, and 2 tandem sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains. The first SAM domain binds to the SAM domain of the EphA2 receptor by adopting a mid-loop/end-helix conformation and may regulate EphA2 endocytosis.  Function  ODIN is widely expressed in tissues including heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney and pancreas. ODIN has been identified as one of the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins induced by activating epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. ODIN is involved in negative regulation of the EGFR signaling pathway. It is reported that ODIN level is correlated with the degree of increased EGF-induced EGFR trafficking to recycle endosomes and recycle back to the cell surface, suggesting a role in EGFR recycling. Furthermore, ODIN serves as a key adaptor protein regulating the EphA receptor signaling pathway, which is critical for regulating EphA8-mediated cell migration and neurite outgrowth. It has been demonstrated that deletion of the phosphotyrosine binding domain in ODIN will lead to an immaturely developed subcommissural organ (SCO) with a severe midbrain hydrocephalic phenotype, which means ODIN also plays a role in the proper development of the SCO and in ependymal cells in the cerebral aqueduct.  Clinical significance  As a novel target of Src family kinases, which are implicated in the development of some colorectal cancers, ODIN may be involved in cancer cell signaling mechanisms. In a study, 64 colorectal cancer cell lines were tested for their expression of Lck. Mass spectrometric analyses of Lck-purified proteins subsequently identified several proteins readily known as SFK kinase substrates, including cortactin, Tom1L1 (SRCASM), GIT1, vimentin and AFAP1L2 (XB130). Additional proteins previously reported as substrates of other tyrosine kinases were also detected, including ODIN. ODIN was further analyzed and found to contain substantially less pY upon inhibition of SFK activity in SW620 cells, indicating that it is a formerly unknown SFK target in colorectal carcinoma cells. Furthermore, it has been found that ODIN regulates COPII- mediated anterograde transport of receptor tyrosine kinases, which is a critical mechanism in the process of tumor genesis. = Clinical marker = A multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the ANKS1A gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy.

LARP1 is a novel target of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, a circuitry often hyperactivated in cancer which regulates cell growth and proliferation primarily through the regulation of protein synthesis.  Function  LARP1 is the largest of a 7 member family of LARP proteins (others are: LARP1B, LARP3 (aka genuine La or SSB), LARP4A, LARP4B, LARP6 and LARP7). All LARP proteins, including human LARPs, contain 2 conserved regions. The first conserved region shares homology with La proteins (called the La motif, see SSB) whereas the second conserved region (called the LA- motif) is restricted to LARP proteins. LARP1 and 1B also contain a conserved \\"DM15 region\\" within their C-terminus. This region is unique and has been shown to be required for RNA-binding. Mouse Larp1 is expressed in dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord, as well as in developing organs characterized by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Human LARP1 is present at low levels in normal, non-embryonic cells but is highly expressed in epithelial cancers (such as ovarian, colorectal, prostate, non-small cell lung, hepatocellular and cervical cancers). Some studies have shown that high levels of LARP1 protein correlate with worse prognosis in cancer patients. LARP1 binds to and regulates the translation of terminal oligopyrimidine motif (TOP mRNAs) and can directly interact with the 5' cap of mRNAs. It has also been shown to interact with the 3' end and coding regions (CDS) of other genes. LARP1 protein colocalizes with stress granules and P-bodies, which function in RNA storage and degradation. It has been suggested that LARP1 functions in P-bodies to attenuate the abundance of conserved Ras-MAPK mRNAs. The cluster of LARP1 homologs may function to control the expression of key developmental regulators. Several studies have demonstrated that LARP1 deficiency selectively affects the recruitment of TOP mRNAs to polysomes [Reference needed]. In some cancer cells, LARP1 deficiency reduces proliferation and activates apoptotic cell death. Even though a decrease abundance of proteins encoded by TOP mRNAs has been reported in LARP1 silenced cells, some researchers believe that this can be explained simply by the reduced number of TOP mRNA transcripts in LARP1-deficient cells.

Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology, Academia Sinica. L. broilii, L. heroldi, and L. prumiensis. Like many other petalichthyid fish, Lunaspis are flat and have elongated pectoral spines, shortened thoracic armor, and dorsally oriented eyes. Lunaspis has been studied mainly by German, Australian, and Chinese palaeontologists because of where it is most commonly encountered. The tails are long and thin and resemble a whip, somewhat like extant skates and rays.  Description  Artist's reconstruction of L. broili (larger) and L. heroldi (smaller) A typical individual of Lunaspis was a flattened fish with a short trunk and long, curved cornual plates. These long, spine-like plates give the suggestion of a crescent moon, hence the generic name (moon-shield). The nostrils and the anterior part of the head shield around the orbits is covered by a number of tiny scales, as is the elongated trunk. Lunaspis were marine bottom dwelling creatures, like many other Devonian placoderm fish, and were nektonic carnivores. The body shape of Lunaspis is also similar to other petalichthyid fish, compressed dorsoventrally.More about Placoderms. (2002). Retrieved March 6, 2017, from Devonian Times, http://www.devoniantimes.org/who/pages/placoderm.html Its body consists of a short trunk shield and elongated cronual plates (the wing-like structures that make up the crescent shape of the moon-like head).

The fusion of the tubercles is unique to Lunaspis in the order Petalichthyida, where other devonian fish in this order have ornament tubercles that are separately occurring.Min, Z. (1991). New information on Diandongpetalichthys (Placodermi: Petalichthyida). EarIy vertebrates and related problems of evolutionary biology, Science Press, Beijing. The maximum height of the ridge is reached before the posterior margin of the median dorsal plate. The spinal plates are curved and are the wings off of the center part of the bony armoring. They have many small spines along the anterior ridge of spinal plates. The ornament ridges on the bony plates make it easily distinguishable from other petalichtyid fish. These ornament ridges are widely spaced and continuous in the Lunaspis, across the three species; in L. broilii, the ornaments are more densely packed than L. heroldi and L. prumiensis.Young, G. C. (1985). Further petalichthyid remains (placoderm fished, Early Devonian) from the Taemas-Wee Jasper region, new South Wales. BMR Journal of Australian Geology and Geophysics, 9, 121‚Äì131.  Discovery  The generic named is a compound word combining two different Greek words: ‚ÄúLuna‚Äù and ‚Äúaspis‚Äù. In Greek, the word ‚Äúluna‚Äù means The Moon, and the word ‚Äúaspis‚Äù means Round Shield. Together, luna and asp signify ‚Äúmoon shield‚Äù; appropriately named as the long projections from the head shield make a crescent moon-like shape. The first specimens of L. broilii were discovered and described through the collaboration of two German palaeontologists, Walter R. Gross and Ferdinand Broili. Broili discovered L. heroldi in 1929 in Germany. In Bumdenbach, Germany 1937, Broili then discovered another fossil specimen that resembled Lunaspis heroldi. At first he put into the same species as L. heroldi, but noticed a difference in morphology from the previously discovered species. Near where Broili had discovered his specimen, another palaeontologist by the name of Gross was working with another specimen of Lunaspis which he originally thought to be Lunaspis prumiensis. Gross was working with fragments of the cranial exoskeletal bones of the unidentified Lunaspis species. The palaeontologists connected soon after and compared their specimens with one another and worked together to discover the differences that existed among the existing species within the genus and were able to come to a conclusion. According to the spinal and anterior ventro-lateral anatomy of the specimens they had collected, they determined that the specimen that both of them had found was a different one than had yet been identified. This new species within the same genus as L. heroldi and L. prumiensis was named Lunaspis broilii. L. Broilii is very commonly larger than L. heroldi. The specimens of L. broilii were originally only found in Emsian-aged Hunsruck Slate of Bundenbach, Germany,Lehmann, W. M. (1951). Neue Beobachtungen an Lunaspis. Neues Jahrbuch Fuer Geologie Und Palaeontologie. Abhandlungen, 94(1), 93-100. but in 1980, Liu Shifan found specimens that are most likely identifiable as L. broilii.Shifan, L. (1980). Occurrence of Lunaspis in China. Kexue Tongbao, 26(9), 828‚Äì830. Specimens of L. broilii have been more recently found in Reefton, New Zealand, and have been identified as closely related, if not the same as those found in New South Wales, Australia. They have been found to have the same concentrically tuberculated ridges which is typical of Lunaspis.Macadie, I. (2007). A Placoderm Fish Plate from the Lower Devonian of Reefton, New Zealand. Records of Canterbury Museum, 21, 21‚Äì26. Specimens of L. heroldi are also found in similarly-aged marine strata in China and Australia.  Classification Lunaspis was originally placed within the family Acanthaspidae, but according to Walter Gross's findings in 1937, the type genus of Acanthaspidae, Acanthaspis, was synonymized with Lunaspis, and the entire family merged into the family Macropetalichthyidae. Lunaspis is currently placed among seven other Macropetalichthyidae, and sister to two other families within Petalichthyida.  Paleoecology  Specimens from the Reefton, New Zealand site were found in the Waitahu Outlier near the Adam Mudstone, east of Reefton. The specimen from the Waitahu Outlier was found among a multitude of invertebrate fossils, brachiopods, bivalves, orthocene nautiloids, bryozoans, and isolated crinoid stem ossicles.

This gene encodes a member of the sirtuin family of proteins, homologs to the yeast Sir2 protein. Members of the sirtuin family are characterized by a sirtuin core domain and belong to the class III of the [histone deacetylase] superfamily, and are dependent on NAD+ as co-factor of enzymatic activities. SIRT5 is one of the three sirtuins localized primarily to the mitochondrion.  Structure  Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants. The protein structure of SIRT5 has been resolved and shows high degrees of structural conservation with other sirtuins, such as the ancestral yeast protein and human SIRT2.  Function  SIRT5 has been found to exhibit enzymatic activities as a deacetylase, desuccinylase, and demalonylase, capable of removing acetyl, succinyl, and malonyl groups from the lysine residues of proteins. SIRT5 deacetylases and regulates carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS1), the rate-limiting and initiating step of the urea cycle in liver mitochondria. Deacetylation of CPS1 stimulates its enzymatic activity. Mice with deletion of SIRT5 show elevated ammonia levels after a prolonged fast, whereas in contrast, mice overexpressing SIRT5 show increased CPS1 activity, suggesting one of the functions of SIRT5 may be to regulate the urea cycle. SIRT5 also interacts with and deacetylates cytochrome c. Large-scale profiling studies of SIRT5 deacetylase activity have uncovered over 700 protein substrates, including proteins localized to the mitochondria, the cytosol and other sub cellular localization. The identities of SIRT5 desuccinylation substrates suggest that SIRT5-mediated desuccinylation may be involved in energy metabolism. The physiological consequences of SIRT5 molecular functions in human is under investigation but may involved regulations of mitochondrial metabolism.

Major arteries of the district include /, / and /. Its inhabitants are called Marolliens. The dialect known as Marols (marollien) was spoken in this area until the 20th century. History=Development= The area now occupied by the Marolles lay, during the Middle Ages, in the first circumvallation of the city of Brussels. Lepers were exiled to this area, and they were cared for by the Apostoline sisters, a religious group from which the toponym Marolles is thought to be derived (from in Latin (\\"those who honour the Virgin Mary\\"), later distorted into /). The sisters presence was short-lived, as they relocated to the / in the Quays District. The first mention of a Walsche Plaetse (1328) probably indicates an early presence of French-speaking traders and craftsmen in the neighbourhood, as it was a logical arrival place for migrants from the south.Bram Vannieuwenhuyze, Brussel, de ontwikkeling van een middeleeuwse stedelijke ruimte, Proefschrift Geschiedenis, Universiteit Gent, 2008, nr. 1.1.693 In 1405, a fire broke out in the neighbourhood and destroyed some 2,400 homes.Alexandre Henne et Alphonse Wauters, Histoire de la ville de Bruxelles, √âditions Libro-Sciences, 1968, Tome 1, p. 181 In the 17th and 18th centuries, the nobility and the bourgeoisie of Brussels built mansions along /.Le patrimoine monumental de la Belgique, Bruxelles, Pentagone E-M, Bruxelles, Pierre Mardaga, 1993, volume 1B, p. 197. The Marolles became a working class district in the succeeding centuries. =19th century= In 1860, during the reign of King Leopold I, a Royal decree announced the construction of a new Palace of Justice (the old one located on what is today Justice Square having quickly deteriorated and exceeded its capacity), and an international architectural contest was organised for its design. After several failed proposals, the then-Minister of Justice Victor Tesch appointed Joseph Poelaert to draw plans of the building in 1861. The first stone was laid on 31 October 1866, and the building was inaugurated on 15 October 1883, four years after Poelaert's death in 1879. The Palace's location is on the Galgenberg hill, where in the Middle Ages convicted criminals were hanged. For the Palace of Justice's construction, a section of the Marolles was demolished, while most of the park belonging to the House of Merode was also expropriated.

Nonetheless, many angry citizens personally blamed Poelaert for the forced relocations, and the expression schieven architect (meaning \\"shameful architect\\") became one of the most serious insults in the dialect of the Marolles. =20th and 21st centuries= L√©on van Dievoetalt= Many Jews resided in the neighbourhood before the first Nazi arrests and deportations in the summer of 1942. Many of them had arrived there after fleeing the pogroms that accompanied the 1905 Russian Revolution, with others following between 1933 and 1938, after Hitler's accession to power in Germany. At that time, their population was estimated at about 3,000 people. A first synagogue had been built on /, where a commemorative plaque now recalls the deportations.

Clinical literature that describes human elastase 1 activity in the pancreas or fecal material is actually referring to chymotrypsin-like elastase family, member 3B (this protein).  Function  Elastases form a subfamily of serine proteases that hydrolyze many proteins in addition to elastin. Humans have six elastase genes which encode the structurally similar proteins elastase 1, 2, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B. Unlike other elastases, elastase 3B has little elastolytic activity. Like most of the human elastases, elastase 3B is secreted from the pancreas as a zymogen and, like other serine proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin and kallikrein, it has a digestive function in the intestine. Elastase 3B preferentially cleaves proteins after alanine residues. Elastase 3B may also function in the intestinal transport and metabolism of cholesterol. Both elastase 3A and elastase 3B have been referred to as protease E and as elastase 1, and excretion of this protein in fecal material is frequently used as a measure of pancreatic function in clinical assays.  Clinical significance  Fecal elastase is a medical test that measures how well the pancreas is functioning.

Radiation is the working fluid, and the piston is driven by radiation pressure. A quantum Carnot engine is one in which the atoms in the heat bath are given a small bit of quantum coherence. The phase of the atomic coherence provides a new control parameter. The deep physics behind the second law of thermodynamics is not violated; nevertheless, the quantum Carnot engine has certain features that are not possible in a classical engine.  Derivation  The internal energy of the photo-Carnot engine is proportional to the volume (unlike the ideal-gas equivalent) as well as the 4th power of the temperature (see Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law) using a = \\\\frac {4\\\\sigma}{c} : : U = V\\\\varepsilon aT^{4} \\\\,. The radiation pressure is only proportional to this 4th power of temperature but no other variables, meaning that for this photo-Carnot engine an isotherm is equivalent to an isobar: : P = \\\\frac{U}{3V} = \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon aT^{4}}{3} \\\\,. Using the first law of thermodynamics (dU = dW + dQ) we can determine the work done through an adiabatic (dQ = 0) expansion by using the chain rule (dU = \\\\varepsilon aT^{4} dV + 4\\\\varepsilon aVT^{3} dT) and setting it equal to dW_V = -PdV = -\\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\varepsilon aT^{4} dV \\\\,. Combining these -dW_V = dU gives us -\\\\frac{2}{3} T^{4} dV = 4VT^{3} dT which we can solve to find \\\\frac{V}{T} = \\\\text{const} \\\\,. Since the photo-Carnot engine needs a quantum coherence in the gas which is lost during the process, the rebuild of coherency takes more energy than is produced with the machine. The efficiency of this reversible engine including the coherency must at most be the Carnot efficiency, regardless of the mechanism and so \\\\eta \\\\le \\\\frac{T_H - T_C}{T_H} \\\\,.

She was built during the War of the Austrian Succession, and went on to see action in the Seven Years' War, during which she was captured by the French and taken into their service under the same name. She was wrecked shortly afterwards. Built at Lepe, Greenwich was one of a number of 50-gun ships designed to the dimensions laid down in the 1745 Establishment. She had only three British commanders during her career with the Royal Navy. Her first, John Montagu, commanded her during the end of the War of the Austrian Succession, after which she was surveyed and probably laid up. She was returned to active service under William Holburne with the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, though he was soon succeeded by Robert Roddam. Roddam took her out to the Caribbean, where in 1757 he fell in with a French squadron under Joseph de Bauffremont. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Roddam fought his ship for 12 hours before surrendering her. Taken into French service, Greenwich formed part of a squadron under Guy Fran√ßois de Coetnempren, comte de Kersaint, which was attacked by a much smaller force of three British ships at the Battle of Cap-Fran√ßais. The two sides inflicted heavy damage on each other before breaking off, with Greenwich having been left considerably leaky. She underwent some repairs before escorting a convoy to France. The escorting force was caught in a gale in January 1758, and three ships were driven aground and wrecked, Greenwich among them. Construction and commissioning Greenwich was ordered from Moody Janvrin on 3 October 1745, and was laid down at his yard at Lepe on the Beaulieu River in Hampshire in November that year. She was built to the draught specified in the 1745 Establishment, and launched on 19 March 1747. She was a development of designs from before the start of the War of the Austrian Succession, and her dimensions approached those of earlier 60-gun ships, though the 50-gun ships of the 1745 establishment sat deeper in the water. Despite this they had an improved freeboard, with a height of amidships from the waterline to the lower gunports, and had increased headroom below decks. 50-gun ships like Greenwich were armed with twenty-two 24-pounder guns on the lower deck, twenty-two 12-pounders on the upper deck, and four 6-pounders on the quarterdeck. In addition they carried two 6-pounders on the forecastle as bow chasers. As completed Greenwich was 1,053 15/94 bm and measured long overall, and on her keel, with a beam of and a hold depth of . She had been named on 9 March 1747, ten days before being launched, and was completed by 26 March 1748, probably at Portsmouth. Her total cost to build came to ¬£19,582.15s.2d, a sum that probably included the cost of fitting her out. She was commissioned in 1748 under Captain John Montagu. British career Commissioned too late to see any significant service in the War of the Austrian Succession, Greenwich was surveyed on 28 January 1749, and was probably laid up for the next few years. She was recommissioned in March 1755, shortly after the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, under Captain William Holburne, though he was soon succeeded by Captain Robert Roddam. Roddam received orders to sail to the Caribbean and departed for Jamaica on 23 January 1757. =Capture= Captain Robert Roddam, Greenwichs third and final British commander Roddam cruised for a while off Cape Cabron, San Domingo, but on 18 March 1757 mysterious sails were sighted, which were at first assumed to be a small fleet of merchant ships being conveyed by two frigates. This was in fact a squadron of French warships under Joseph de Bauffremont, consisting of the 84-gun Tonnant, the 74-gun ships Diad√®me and Desauncene, the 64-gun ships √âveill√© and Inflexible, the frigates Sauvage and Brune, and a 20-gun storeship. The French were to windward, and Bauffremont, unsure of Greenwichs identity, sent one of his frigates to examine her. Realising that with the wind in the Frenchman's favour, he could not escape, Roddam attempted to lure the frigate towards him, hoping to capture her before the rest of the fleet could intervene, and then send her immediately to Rear-Admiral George Townshend, the commander at Jamaica, with news of the French movements. Joseph de Bauffremont, whose squadron captured Greenwich off San Domingo The frigate soon determined that Greenwich was a two-decked warship, and sailed back to the protection of the squadron, which then came up and attacked, with action commencing at 9 a.m. when Diad√®me opened fire. For the next twelve hours Greenwich was constantly engaged with one or other of the French ships. Roddam assembled his men in an attempt to board the 64-gun √âveill√©, but several of her consorts bore up and opened fire, damaging Greenwichs rigging and leaving her unmanageable. After consulting with his officers, Roddam expressed his desire to fight on, but eventually agreed to surrender Greenwich, as further resistance would only cause further casualties among his men. The colours were then struck to √âveill√©, but Roddam refused her commander's demands that he come aboard his ship, instead insisting the French send a boat for him. Roddam threatened to rehoist the colours and defend the ship until she sank if this was not done, and eventually a French officer was sent across in a boat. The French took possession of Greenwich, ransacking her, then taking Roddam and his men to Hispaniola where they were imprisoned. French career and loss Greenwich was taken into the French Navy under the same name, and appears to have been quickly pressed into service, as, under the command of a Captain Foucault she was part of a squadron under Guy Fran√ßois de Coetnempren, comte de Kersaint which engaged a British squadron at the Battle of Cap-Fran√ßais on 21 October 1757. The British force, under Commodore Arthur Forrest, had been sent from Jamaica by Rear-Admiral Thomas Cotes to intercept a homeward-bound French convoy. Forrest's force consisted of two 60-gun ships; , flying Forrest's broad pennant, and , under Captain Maurice Suckling, and the 64-gun HMS Edinburgh, under Captain William Langdon. The recently reinforced French squadron, consisting of Greenwich, the 70-gun Intr√©pide under Kersaint, the 70-gun Sceptre under Captain Clavel, the 64-gun Opiniatre under Captain Mollieu, the 44-gun frigate Outarde and the 32-gun frigates Sauvage and Licorne came out to meet them. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the British engaged the French squadron at 3.20 pm, with the fighting lasting for the next two and a half hours, until Kersaint signalled one of his frigates to tow his damaged flagship, Intr√©pide, out of the line. In doing so the French line fell into confusion, with Intr√©pide, Superbe and Greenwich falling aboard each other, and were heavily cannonaded by Augusta and Edinburgh until they were able to untangle themselves. The other French ships gradually broke away from the action and moved off. The British did not pursue, and the two sides returned to their respective ports. The French casualties in the action were estimated at between 500 and 600 killed and wounded, with Greenwich having been reduced to a very leaky condition. After repairing some of the battle damage Kersaint sailed for France with the convoy, but became caught in a storm in January 1758 as he neared the French coast. Opiniatre, Greenwich and Outarde attempted to anchor, but were driven ashore in the gale and were wrecked.

Its Poz domain is thought to function as a site for protein-protein interaction and is required for transcriptional repression, and the zinc-fingers comprise the DNA binding domain.

It is endemic to California, where it grows in woodland and grassland in the northern half of the state. This wildflower generally reaches one half to one meter in height. It has deeply lobed, prominently veined leaves, mostly located near the base of the plant. The inflorescence may hold very few to over 100 flowers, each on a long, thick pedicel. The flowers are usually a brilliant blue or purple, and sometimes lighter pinkish to white. Often the sepals are dark in color and the petals lighter. The spur is about one to two centimeters long. There are three subspecies of this plant.

Function  Voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. The KCNE4 gene encodes KCNE4 (originally named MinK-related peptide 3 or MiRP3), a member of the KCNE family of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel ancillary or Œ≤ subunits. KCNE4 is best known for modulating the KCNQ1 Kv Œ± subunit, but it also regulates KCNQ4, Kv1.x, Kv2.1, Kv4.x and BK Œ± subunits in heterologous co-expression experiments and/or in vivo. KCNE4 often, but not always, acts as an inhibitory subunit to suppress potassium channel function, but this varies depending on the channel subtype. KCNE4 strongly inhibits the KCNQ1 potassium channel, which is known to play important roles in human cardiac myocyte repolarization, and in multiple epithelial cell types. KCNE4 inhibition of KCNQ1 requires calmodulin, which binds to both KCNQ1 and KCNE4. KCNE4 can also inhibit complexes formed by KCNQ1 and KCNE1. KCNE4 has no known effect on KCNQ2, KCNQ3 or KCNQ5 channels, but augments activity of KCNQ4 in HEK cells, mesenteric artery and Xenopus laevis oocytes. KCNE4 strongly inhibits Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 channels when co- expressed in HEK cells and in Xenopus laevis oocytes, while leaving Kv1.2 and Kv1.4 currents unaffected. KCNE4 augments Kv1.5 current and surface expression twofold in CHO cells (but had no effect in Xenopus oocytes). Kcne4 deletion from mice impaired currents attributable to Kv1.5, in ventricular myocytes. KCNE4 inhibited Kv2.1 currents by 90% but had little to no effect on currents generated by heteromers of Kv2.1 with the regulatory Œ± subunit Kv6.4. KCNE4 slows activation and inactivation of Kv4.2 channels, and induces overshoot upon recovery from inactivation. Co-expression with KChIP2 produces intermediate gating kinetics in complexes with Kv4.2 and KCNE4. Deletion of Kcne4 in mice impaired ventricular myocyte Ito, a current generated at least in part by Kv4.2. Although mouse KCNE4 reportedly had no effect on Kv4.3 when coexpressed in oocytes, human KCNE4 was found to accelerate inactivation and recovery from inactivation of Kv4.3-KChIP2 complexes. KCNE4 has also been found to regulate the large-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channel, BK. KCNE4 inhibits BK activity by positive-shifting the voltage dependence of BK activation and accelerating BK protein degradation.  Structure  KCNE4 is a type 1 membrane protein, with the transmembrane segment predicted to be alpha- helical. No studies have as yet reported the number of KCNE4 subunits within a functional channel complex; it is likely to be either 2 or 4. The majority of studies of KCNE4 function, structure-function relationships and effects of pathological gene sequence variants within KCNE4 have utilized the widely reported 170 residue version of the protein encoded by exon 2 of the human KCNE4 gene. However, in 2016 a longer form of the KCNE4 protein, termed KCNE4L, was discovered. An additional N-terminal portion of 51 residues, encoded by exon 1 of the human KCNE4 gene, were found to also be expressed in multiple human tissues, extending the human protein to 221 residues, by far the longest of the KCNE subunits. Human KCNE4L exhibits some functional differences to the shorter 170 residue form now also termed KCNE4S. KCNE4L is predicted to also be expressed in other mammals, reptiles, amphibians and fish, although the house mouse (Mus musculus) appears to only express KCNE4S because the KCNE4L start site is lacking in the house mouse genome.  Tissue distribution  Human KCNE4L transcripts are most highly expressed in uterus, and next most highly expressed in atria, adrenal gland, lymph nodes, pituitary gland, spleen and ureter. KCNE4L transcript is also detectable in cervix, colon, optic nerve, ovary, oviduct, pancreas, skin, retina, spinal cord, stomach, thymus, and vagina. In the rat heart, KCNE4 protein co-localizes with Kv4.2, a channel that KCNE4 also functionally regulates. In mouse heart, KCNE4 is preferentially expressed in ventricles versus atria, and in young adult males much more than young adult females. This is because cardiac KCNE4 expression is positively regulated by dihydrotestosterone. In rat mesenteric artery, KCNE4 augments KCNQ4 channel activity to regulate arterial tone.  Clinical significance  A single polymorphism in the KCNE4 intracellular N-terminal domain, E145D, has been reported to affect predisposition to the relatively common chronic cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, in Chinese populations, and to impair the ability of KCNE4 to inhibit KCNQ1. If KCNE4 inhibits KCNQ1 in the atrium, it is conceivable that removing this inhibition could shorten the atrial effective refractory period, which could predispose to atrial fibrillation, but this mechanism has not yet been substantiated with in vivo data.

This gene encodes a mitochondrially-localized protein which is classified under the Bcl-2 protein family. Overexpression of the encoded protein results in apoptosis. As a result, it has been implicated in cancers such as childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene, such as Bcl-rambo beta.  Structure  As a member of the Bcl-2 protein family, Bcl-rambo comprises four conserved BH domains and a transmembrane (TM) domain. However, unlike the other members, Bcl-rambo does not require the BH domains for its apoptotic function, relying instead on the mitochondrial localization carried out by the TM domain. In addition to these domains, it has conserved B-cell lymphoma 2 homology motifs, as well as an extension at its c-terminal, termed the BHNo domain, which contains two tandem repeats, RTA and RTB. An alternatively-spliced protein variant, called Bcl-rambo beta, is composed of only the BH4 domain, completely lacking the BH domains 1 through 3 due to an in-frame stop codon inserted by an Alu element. Without the TM domain, this variant remains in the cytosol and does not localize to the mitochondria. Nonetheless, it still performs proapoptotic activity, mediated by the encoded Alu element, though the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated.*  Function  Bcl-rambo is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that regulate apoptosis. In cells, Bcl-rambo is localized to the mitochondria, and its overexpression induces apoptosis that is blocked by caspase inhibitors, whereas inhibitors controlling upstream events of either the 'death receptor' (FLIP, FADD-DN) or the 'mitochondrial' pro-apoptotic pathway (Bcl-x(L)) had no effect. Bcl-rambo mediates apoptosis by associating with adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, to induce its opening. ANT will also facilitate the transfer of ADP and ATP between the cytosol and the matrix.  Clinical significance  The BCL2L13 gene has been implicated in a wide spectrum of cancers. Previous clinical studies observed in ALL patients that high expression of BCL2L13 correlated to lower event-free and overall survival. Though statistically significant, the observations contradict the accepted pro-apoptotic function of BCL2L13‚Äôs gene product, which should have contributed to cancer cell death and, thus, more favorable survival outcomes. Two possible explanations propose that either 1) Bcl-rambo performs a different biological role in childhood, or 2) alternative splicing could have generated an anti-apoptotic variant. More research is necessary to resolve this discrepancy. In another type of cancer, GBM, Bcl-rambo is known to inhibit induced apoptosis in GBM cells by binding two other pro-apoptotic proteins, ceramide synthases 2 (CerS2) and 6 (CerS6), thereby blocking CerS2/6 complex formation and activity. Thus, inhibiting BCL2L13 during cancer treatments may improve survival outcomes.  Interactions  BCL2L13 has been shown to interact with: *CerS2 and *CerS6.

In a pre-clinical study, colon cancer cells defective in RAD54B were determined to be selectively killed by inhibitors of the DNA repair protein PARP1. Inhibitors of PARP1 likely impede alternative DNA repair responses that might otherwise compensate for loss of the RAD54B pathway in cancer cells.

Function  Growth arrest-specific 1 plays a role in growth suppression. GAS1 blocks entry to S phase and prevents cycling of normal and transformed cells. Gas1 is a putative tumor suppressor gene.  Discovery  The mouse cells, which appear the growth-arrested, were observed expression of Growth Arrest Specific-1 gene (GAS1). In 1988, Gas-1 was first defined as one of six genes that block transcriptional up-regulation of the NIH3T3 cell cycle from G0 to S phase. Most of scientist have proved that overexpressed gas1 has the function of inhibiting tumor growth and progression in gliomas. Furthermore, GAS1 gene was also thought to contribute to recurrence and metastasized prediction in colon cancer.  Gene location of GAS1  GAS-1 gene has been identified as a putative tumor suppressor collocates on chromosome 9q21.3-22.1 where was considered to be a fragile site. In 1994, 29 metaphases were analyzed by Del Sal G et al, and 102 fluorescent signals were observed during the experiment. The results showed that 84 (82%) expression rate of the fluorescent signal on chromosome 9. Furthermore, the peak signal density of the fluorescent also observed occurring in the q21.3-22.1 region. In addition, the inexpression of the fluorescent signal cluster on any other chromosome further demonstrates Gas1 gene specifically expresses on chromosome 9q21.3-22.1.  GAS1 characteristic  345 amino acids were confirmed to constitute mature Gas-1 gene. Asn117 and an aminated Ser318 are two particular position which result in discovering of the one N-glycosylation site and potential signal peptide, respectively. = Gene structure = Gas-1 gene has been confirmed to be highly similar to the GFRŒ±1 gene (28% similarity) while the Gas1 only consists of two domains which is different from the GFRŒ±1-3 that composes of three domains. Although the structure of GAS1 gene is similar to GFRŒ±s, the function of GAS1 is largely different from GFRŒ±s since the GAS 1 gene has the ability of binding RET in a ligand independent manner . Since the structure similarity between GAS1 and GFRŒ±s, the ancestor of GFRŒ± proteins was suspected to be the GAS1. In regard to the secondary structure, most of mammalian Gas1 gene‚Äôs secondary structure were identified to be mostly Œ±-helical and to have a long unstructured C-terminal domain  Gene expression  GAS1 protein widespread distributed in adult mammalian CNS ( central nervous system). Adult mouse brain has been described expressing GAS1 mRNA, and the experiment of Natanael Zarco et al further corroborated this description. Western blot analysis is the main method which has been used in their practical and plays an significant role in successfully determining the distribution of the protein in the adult central nervous system (CNS). Olfactory bulb, caudate-putamen, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, mesencephalon, medulla oblongata, cerebellum, and cervical spinal cord has been identified as the specific expression parts of GAS1. Despite the pattern of expression in Astrocyte cells was more limited than in neurons, the gas1 was also found expressing in that part.  Function  GAS1 was identified as a pleiotropic protein with the function of the cell arrest and apoptosis. Except that, the nervous system and other amount of organs can also be largely influenced by the abnormal Gas1 gene. The reason of this dual function is likely caused by its ability of interacting with the inhibited signaling cascade which induced by GNDF (glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor). Additionally, GAS1 has been proved can largely influence the developmental state of the organs. During the development stage of the GAS1, it has been suggested that development GAS1 can not only inhibit cell proliferation but also control the cell death as well as growth of the cerebellum. The signal emission of GAS 1 protein associate with two different types of transmembrane receptor protein, including RET and the Hedgehog receptor protein, GAS1 is therefore determined as a kind of multifunctional protein. The Hedgehog signaling pathway is known as an essential part in the body which largely influences the body development, and cancer progression since the Sonic hedgehog can be connected by GAS1 directly, and lead to active of the signaling pathway. = Associated diseases = Kidney hypoplasia  The GAS1 gene plays a significant role in kidney development. Conserved DNA binding motif, which is located in the Gas1 promoter, is directly bind by the WT1, and then the Gas1 mRNA is activated to transcript to the NPCs. The WT1 has been confirmed as a necessary part for expressing Gas1 in kidneys in vivo. Loss of function of GAS1 in vivo results in hypoplastic kidneys with reduced nephron mass due to premature depletion of NPCs. In humans, fetal period is the most significant time point for inducting a new nephrons, no matter what kind of mammals, once the NPCS disappeared, there is no possibility for inducing the new nephrons.  Gene mutation  Gas1 gene has been mapped by the method of in situ hybridization to human chromosome bands 9q21.3-q22, a fragile site where frequently deleted in human tumors, especially acute myeloid leukemia and bladder tumors. The deletion region of early superficial bladder cancer indicated that the frequent (50%) deletion of tumor suppressor genes was located between 9q22 and 9p12-13, an area that spanned the GAS1 gene position and could be a starting event for bladder cancer disease. However, a study that has been done by Simoneau et al indicates that there is no mutations in the gas1 gene in 14 primary bladder carcinomas and 10 bladder carcinoma cell lines, which means the mutation of gas1 is not the main reason in causing the pathogenesis.

He was a long-time resident of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Subbarao was born in the small village of Yazali, near Bapatla, Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, India. He received his master's degree from Presidency College, Madras in 1941. He went on to complete a doctorate in functional analysis, advised by Ramaswamy S. Vaidyanathaswamy. He worked at Presidency College, Madras, Sri Venkateswara University, and the University of Missouri, before moving in 1963 to the University of Alberta, where he spent the rest of his professional career. In the 1960s Subbarao began to study the congruence properties of the partition function, p(n), which became one of his favourite problems. For example, he conjectured that if A and B are integers with 0 ‚â§ B < A, there are infinitely many n for which p(An+B) is even and infinitely many n for which p(An+B) is odd. Ken Ono showed that the even case is always true and that if there is one number n such that p(An+B) is odd, then there are infinitely many such numbers n. The odd case was finally settled by Silviu Radu. A more general variant of the conjecture was formulated by Morris Newman predicting that for any given r and m, there are infinitely many n such that p(n)= r(mod m). At the end of his life, Subbarao co-authored a book on partition theory with A.K. Agarwal and Padmavathamma. Partition theory is ubiquitous in mathematics with connections to the representation theory of the symmetric group and the general linear group, modular forms, and physics. Thus, Subbarao's conjectures, though seemingly simple, will generate fundamental research activity for years to come. He also researched special classes of divisors and the corresponding analogues of divisor functions and perfect numbers, such as those arising from the exponential divisors (\\"e-divisors\\") which he defined. Many other mathematicians have published papers building on his work in these subjects. A prolific collaborator, Subbarao had more than 40 joint authors (including Paul Erd≈ës, giving him Erd≈ës number 1). He continued producing mathematics papers into the final years of his life. He died in Edmonton at the age of 84. Subbarao was the father of Prof. Mathukumalli Vidyasagar.

Background Creaghe was born in Limerick, Ireland in 1841, and in 1865 he graduated from the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, becoming a doctor. He opened up a practice in Mitchelstown in County Cork. In 1874, he emigrated to the capital of Argentina, Buenos Aires. In Argentina It is not known how Creaghe came in contact with anarchist ideas, since the country's anarchist movement was small at the time. It's speculated he may have come into contact with the Italian Anarchist Errico Malatesta, who was in Argentina between 1885 and 1889. In England In 1890, he moved to Sheffield, England, working in a poor working class district with many Irish immigrants. He became involved in the Socialist League, a Marxist group led by William Morris, but he soon broke away to form an anarchist group in Sheffield. On the group's first public appearance, it sported a banner reading \\"No God, No Master\\" at the May Day demonstration. The group soon also founded a club and a newspaper, the Sheffield Anarchist, which did not survive for long as it became caught up in the Walsall Anarchists' trial. In 1891 Creaghe wrote \\"give me Anarchists willing to die NOW if necessary for Anarchy, and if you can find me 15 or 20 to join me I promise you we will make an oppression of the enemy\\" Return to the Americas In 1892, he left Sheffield to go back to Argentina via Liverpool, London, and Spain. There he founded the newspaper El Oprimido, forerunner of , which exists to this day. He was involved in the founding of the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation, an anarchist trade union. He also contributed to the Ferrer free school movement inspired by the ideas of the Spanish anarchist pedagogue Francisco Ferrer, and director of the Rationalist School in Luj√°n, Buenos Aires. In 1911, Creaghe left Argentina once again, eventually arriving in Los Angeles, where he collaborated with Mexican anarchists. He founded another newspaper, La Regeneraci√≥n, and was friends with Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n. Both were involved in the Magonista rebellion of 1911 in Baja California; after the start of the Mexican Revolution, they supported the country's anarchist movement. Creaghe died on February 19, 1920 in a prison in Washington, DC. References *Cath√°in, M√°irt√≠n √ì: Dr. John O‚ÄôDwyer Creaghe (1841-1920) Irish-Argentine Anarchist.

T. Carter, was a significant figure in the Victorian Church of England. He was responsible for reintroducing some Catholic practices to the church and being the founder of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament. He also founded several charitable organisations. He was a prolific writer on church matters and a project exists to collect and collate all his writings. He was for 36 years the Rector of Clewer and an honorary canon of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford.A History of ClewerProject Canterbury: T.T. CarterConfraternity of the Blessed Sacrament Early life Carter was the son of Thomas Carter (then under master and later vice-provost of Eton College) and his wife Mary (n√©e Proctor). Carter was educated at Eton from the age of six and, when he left, was captain of oppidans. He then entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1825. Amongst those he met there were Edward Bouverie Pusey who had been a pupil of his father's. He graduated with first class honours in classics in 1831 and attempted to gain a fellowship at Oriel College but was unsuccessful. Carter's middle name probably derives from the time his father spent as domestic chaplain to John Thellusson, 2nd Baron Rendlesham. Ministry Carter was ordained a deacon on 21 October 1832 by Thomas Burgess, Bishop of Salisbury. He served his first curacy at St Mary, Reading, where Henry Hart Milman was then vicar. Carter was ordained a priest by John Kaye, Bishop of Lincoln, on 22 December 1833 and went to serve as his father's curate, who was now vicar of Burnham, Buckinghamshire. Carter was married in 1835. Through his wife, he first came into contact with the Tractarian movement, since Richard Hurrell Froude was a family friend. In 1838 he was appointed rector of Piddlehinton (near Dorchester). This proved to be an unhappy appointment and his health suffered. From 1842, he took a period of leave back at Burnham to recover and in 1844 was appointed rector of Clewer (near Windsor). Here he soon restored the parish church, with the aid of his friend, an architect, Henry Woodyer. Carter also set up two mission churches within the parish, and set out to assist the poor of the parish, establishing a benefit society, a temperance society and converting part of the glebe to allotments. Within the large parish, a particularly poor area was the slum of Clewer Fields, which contained two army barracks and a swiftly changing population of railway navvies, which served to worsen the general problems of drink, prostitution and poverty. Beginning with just one young woman in December 1848, a parishioner, a widow named Mariquita Tennant, began to take in young women from Clewer Fields, and give them an alternative to life there. This became the Clewer House of Mercy, which Carter, influenced by the writings of John Armstrong strongly supported. Ill- health prompted Tennant's withdrawal from the project in 1851, and she was succeeded by another widow, 40-year-old Harriet Monsell, who became mother superior of the newly created Community of St John Baptist, Clewer on 30 November 1852. Soon there were over forty branch houses, and significant work was undertaken in the United States and India. Re-establishment of the religious life was still controversial in Anglicanism (all monasteries and other religious houses had been dissolved during the English Reformation), and the foundation of a sisterhood was viewed with alarm in some quarters, not least among them being the Bishop of Oxford (the diocesan), Samuel Wilberforce, despite his misgivings, he acted as Visitor to the community until his move to Winchester in 1869. Carter was also one of the key figures in the founding of another order of religious sisters, the Community of Reparation to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament (CRJBS). Following the success of the convent at Clewer and the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament, the new order of nuns was to make reparation (by prayer) for any dishonour done to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. The first members served the noviciate at Clewer before forming their own community based in Southwark. Carter's involvement in the establishment of this community, and his general commitment to pastoral work drew him into the provision of spiritual direction, which became a new focus of activity and led to the book, The Treasury of Devotion which appeared in 1869.The preface to the 1st edition by the editor T. T. Carter attributes the compilation to \\"a priest who desires to withhold his name\\". The 9th edition (1957) was revised by Dom Robert Petitpierre, monk of Nashdom Abbey. He also became a pioneer of retreats within the Church of England. This work also led him into the controversial area of auricular confession, and in 1865, the book, The Doctrine of Confession in the Church of England. When, in 1873, a controversial petition signed by 483 clergy requesting the provision of suitably qualified confessors was presented to the Convocation of Canterbury, he was one of those who drew up the Declaration on Confession and Absolution, as Set Forth by the Church of England in defence of private confession. Family Carter was married at Amberd, Taunton, Somerset on 26 November 1835 to Mary Ann Gould (1802 ‚Äì 7 February 1869), with issue including: #Jane Frances Mary Carter (1836‚Äì1935) #Thomas John Proctor (John) Carter (1841‚Äì1899) #Georgiana Elizabeth Carter (1843‚Äì1920) ReferencesExternal links * Thomas Thellusson Carter, The Online Books Page, University of Pennsylvania Category:1808 births Category:1901 deaths Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:19th-century English Anglican priests Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Anglo- Catholic clergy Category:English Anglo-Catholics ","title":"Thomas Thellusson Carter"},{"id":"15070446","text":"Riley Hill, North Carolina, USA, is an unincorporated community in mideastern Wake County.

Plot Chicago mob boss Rocca manages to get Lester Gillis sprung from jail in Joliet. His motive is to have Gillis kill a labor organizer, but Gillis refuses, preferring to work with Rocca's gang on robberies instead. He meets mob moll Sue Nelson and they start a relationship. He is relaxing, alone in his hotel room, when cops burst in, finding a gun Rocca has planted to frame Gillis for the labor leader's murder. Gillis vows revenge, escapes from the cops with Sue's help, then guns down Rocca and two henchmen. He adopts Sue's surname as an alias. In a holdup at a pharmacy, Gillis is winged by a gunshot. He goes to Doc Saunders (Cedric Hardwicke), whose patients include America's most wanted criminal, John Dillinger (portrayed by Leo Gordon). Acquiring a nickname, \\"Baby Face Nelson\\", a grateful Gillis joins up with Dillinger and quickly becomes the FBI's second most wanted man. The ruthless Baby Face goes on a shooting spree, even killing innocent motorists just to steal a car. He doesn't like playing second fiddle to Dillinger, but after the arch-criminal is shot in Chicago, it becomes Baby Face's turn to be public enemy number one. He commits multiple murders, even killing Doc in a fit of anger, and frightens Sue by placing a rifle sight on children. Trapped by a roadblock, Baby Face flees on foot and is shot several times. Stumbling to a graveyard, he pleads with Sue at first, then taunts her, to put him out of his misery, and she does. CastProduction The Production Code had recently repealed a ban on dramatising the lives of real criminals. Producer Al Zimbalist formed ZS Productions with Irving Shulman to make a film based on the latter's unpublished novel about Baby Face Nelson. He originally announced he was seeking Montgomery Clift, Frank Sinatra or Tony Curtis for the lead. Eventually they partnered with Mickey Rooney's Fryman Enterprises to make the movie. Don Siegel was hired to direct. Zimbalist wanted to borrow Edd Byrnes from Warner Bros to play John Dillinger. Filming started in October 1955. Zimbalist did some second unit filming in Chicago himself. Shulman was later hired by Sam Katzman to do a script on Pretty Boy Floyd. Rooney says he was offered a million dollars to buy out his interest in the film but he refused, confident it would be a success. Reception When the film was released film critic Bosley Crowther panned the film writing, \\"Baby Face Nelson, heading the double bill on the Loew's circuit, is a thoroughly standard, pointless and even old-fashioned gangster picture, the kind that began going out along with the oldtime sedans. As a matter of fact, one of the few absorbing sights in this United Artists release, starring Mickey Rooney, is a continual procession of vintage jaloppys, chugging in and out of the proceedings ... The other distinction, also mild, is Sir Cedric Hardwicke's professional portrait of a seedy, lecherous and alcoholic physician who consorts with criminals.\\"Crowther, Bosly, film review, The New York Times, December 12, 1957. Accessed: July 6, 2013. The Los Angeles Times called it a \\"bitter bloody drama\\".

The Audition is still a young band, and with time they‚Äôre going to mature into some serious hard-hitters with some great singles, But until then, however, they‚Äôll make a great supporting act for the bigger bands.\\" Exclaim!'s Sari Delmar rated the album \\"Unfavourable\\" stating \\"while Chicago's sweethearts have refined their sugar-coated vocals and stepped it up to a whole new level of poppy-ness, they seem to have toned down the originality.

Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) are two structurally related, potent neurotrophic factors that play key roles in the control of neuron survival and differentiation. They both bind the GFRA2 receptor. The receptor mediates activation of the RET tyrosine kinase receptor. This encoded protein acts preferentially as a receptor for NTN compared to its other family member, GDNF family receptor alpha 1. This gene is a candidate gene for RET-associated diseases.

Function  This gene encodes a predicted 75-kDa polypeptide with high sequence and structure homology to yeast Gle1p, which is nuclear protein with a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence essential for poly(A)+RNA export. Inhibition of human GLE1L by microinjection of antibodies against GLE1L in HeLa cells resulted in inhibition of poly(A)+RNA export. Immunoflourescence studies show that GLE1L is localized at the nuclear pore complexes. This localization suggests that GLE1L may act at a terminal step in the export of mature RNA messages to the cytoplasm. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.  Clinical significance  A genome-wide screening and linkage analysis assigned the disease locus of lethal congenital contracture syndrome, one of 40 Finnish heritage diseases, to a defined region of 9q34, where the GLE1 gene is located. Mutations in GLEI have been identified in families with foetal motoneuron disease.  Interactions  GLE1L has been shown to interact with NUP155.

It is located in Beverly, Massachusetts and is one of the few remaining theatre-in-the-round stages left in the United States. The theater is owned by Massachusetts businessman Bill Hanney. History In 1955, theater producer Steven Slane, bandleader Ruby Newman, and attorney C. Henry Glovsky founded the North Shore Music Theatre. The trio originally planned to construct a restaurant, bowling alley, swimming pool, and condominium complex for seniors as well, however they eventually changed their plans and in 1961 created the North Shore Community Arts Foundation, a nonprofit organization that focused on the theater. The theater \\"opened as a partstar-centered comedies\\". After Route 128 was finished in the 1960s, permanent walls were constructed along with heating and air conditioning, and the capacity of the theater was increased from 1,000 to 1,750 and later 1,800 seats. Since the renovation in 2005, the theatre currently has 1,500 seats. The theater became the largest non-profit theater in New England, and up to 350,000 people attended the musicals performed each year. The theatre annually presented a series of celebrity concerts of children's musicals. It also housed the Youth Performance Academy that provided an opportunity for child actors to perform. The theater produced the world premiere of the Tony Award-winning musical Memphis in 2003, as well as the regional premieres of Hairspray, Thoroughly Modern Millie, Ragtime, and many others. The theatre suffered from a serious fire in 2005 and slipped into debt. The financial distress of the theatre was also attributed to a poor management decision, which canceled the extremely popular annual production of A Christmas Carol in favor of High School Musical 2. With debts totaling more than $10 million in 2009, NSMT officials announced that the financially distressed theatre had failed to raise $2 million in philanthropic commitments to fund a new business model and launch a 2009 season. Although more than $500,000 in pledges had been made since the theatre announced a turn-around strategy in mid April, not enough money was raised to save the season. The planned productions were cancelled, and more than 4,000 people who had prepaid for tickets for the 2009 season were never refunded. When the theatre closed in June 2009, NSMT's debts included large mortgages on its property and buildings and debts to vendors, the State of Massachusetts, and subscribers who paid in advance for the 2009 season. Theater officials were in discussions with its senior creditor and were reviewing the options available for liquidating and maximizing the value of the theatre's assets, as well as identifying potential buyers of the property who might consider a lease back of the theatre. The theatre was later acquired by Citizens Bank in October for $3.6 million. In November 2009, Bill Hanney, a Massachusetts investor and owner of Theatre-By-the-Sea and Entertainment Cinemas, a chain of 10 movie theaters in New England, looked to purchase the North Shore Music Theatre. Hanney reached an agreement with Citizens Bank and with Producing Artistic Director, Evans Haile,(Producing Artistic Director of the historic Cape Playhouse)(NY Times, July 4th 2010) reopened the theatre under new ownership in the summer of 2010. The theatre continues to thrive and grow under owner Bill Hanney, annually producing a five-show subscription series and a unique popular production of A Christmas Carol. The 2021 musical season will include Thoroughly Modern Millie, Rodgers + Hammerstein's Cinderella, Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story, Little Shop of Horrors, and Kinky Boots.http://www.playbill.com/article/5-musicals-announced-for-north-shore- music-theatres-2020-summer-season-including-the-wind-in-the-willows Controversy In September 2017, the theater received criticism for casting non-Latino actors to play lead roles in the play \\"Evita\\". The New York-based group Am I Right?, protested the use of actors who do not understand the culture and perpetuate the stereotypes. The group would like actors who are not members of underrepresented groups not to play the part and pass on the roles. The owner and producer, Hanney, stated that the theater does colorblind casting with the only criteria being able to dance, sing, and act.

It has several major junctions with other Interstates, including I-65, I-71, I-264 and I-265 in Louisville, and I-75 in Lexington. The portion of I-64 in Kentucky is host to two \\"exceptionally significant\\" structures indicated by the Federal Highway Administration. One is the Cochran Hill Tunnel, a twin tube at Cherokee Park in Louisville built in 1974, and the other is a 1960s-era modern-styled rest area near Winchester. In Downtown Louisville, I-64 passes under a public plaza called the Riverfront Plaza/Belvedere, one of the only structures in the state built on top of an Interstate. Between the Indiana state line and Lexington, I-64 is named the Daniel Boone Expressway. The entire length of I-64 in Kentucky has been designated as a portion of the Purple Heart Trail. History The Cochran Hill Tunnel in Louisville, also known as the Cherokee Park Tunnel, underwent restoration in 2001, which involved the reconstruction of the concrete pavement, the installation of new tiles and improvements to lighting. Efforts were made to paint the interior tiles of the tunnel with a mural, but were dropped because opponents stated that drivers would become distracted while passing through the tunnel, driving and viewing the art work at the same time. The tunnels, which opened in 1974, are one of three sites in Kentucky deemed \\"exceptionally significant\\" by the Federal Highway Administration. The designation meant that it will be very difficult for the stretch of interstate running through Cherokee Park ever to be widened. Streaking Lights on I-64 as seen from the horse/bike bridge at Seneca Park in Louisville Kentucky. Construction began on a Kentucky Route 180 interchange improvement project in the summer of 2006. The $34 million project entailed the rebuilding of six bridges, the widening of Kentucky Route 180 to four-lanes in the vicinity of the interchange and the conversion of the ramps into a diamond. The project was finished in the fall of 2008. In March 2007, Governor Ernie Fletcher signed Senate Bill 83 which allowed for an increase in speed limits on rural interstates and parkways. Speed limits on rural sections of Interstate 64 were increased from 65 MPH to , following an engineering study by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. New signage was installed in July On June 7, 2007, Interstate 64 between the junction of Interstate 264 and Interstate 65 and Interstate 71 in downtown Louisville was closed to through traffic. The section of highway featured three-lanes of traffic in each direction on an elevated viaduct paralleling the Ohio River, carrying 90,000 vehicles-per-day. The closure was part of a $50 million refurbishment project that involved replacing 132 expansion joints and repaving more than four-miles (6 km) of interstate and interchanges. The work was completed in two phases, starting with the entire project area being closed on three weekends in June, followed by a section of highway closed from 3rd to 22nd Streets in early July to early August. However, the Interstate was not finished because of the section between Frankfort and Lexington. The state could not attain the right of way here because of very famous horse parks northwest of Lexington. After a couple of tries to get the right of way, the state was able to get the right of way and began construction on this segment. It was the last segment of Interstate 64 to be completed in Kentucky. =\\"8664\\"= Controversially, I-64 runs through Louisville Waterfront Park, a key part of the revitalization of Downtown Louisville, and portions of the park exist under it. 8664.org, a grassroots campaign with popular support but little apparent political momentum, aimed to re-route and remove I-64 to enhance Louisville's waterfront. I-64 through Louisville would be re-signed as I-364. I-64 was to be widened over the park as a part of the Ohio River Bridges Project. But plans to widen the freeway over the park were abandoned to reduce costs of the Ohio River Bridges Project. Exit listRelated route Interstate 264 is an inner loop route in Metro Louisville. Signed as the Georgia Davis Powers Shawnee Expressway between its western terminus at I-64 in Shawnee and US 31W/US 60 (Dixie Highway) in Shively, and as the Watterson Expressway from US 31W/US 60 to its northeastern terminus at I-71 in Glenview Manor.

The airport is located 12 nautical miles (14 mi, 22 km) north-northeast of the central business district of Pittsburgh, in West Deer Township. The airport is located a few miles north of Pittsburgh Mills shopping mall. This airport was included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2009‚Äì2013, which categorized it as a general aviation facility. It was originally known as West Penn Airport.  Facilities and aircraft  Pittsburgh Northeast Airport covers an area of 149 acres (60 ha) at an elevation of 1,063 feet (324 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 17/35 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,550 by 100 feet (1,082 x 30 m). The property went through a major overhaul between 2000 and 2004, and can now accommodate larger aircraft. The airport's former runway, designated 2/20, had an asphalt surface measuring 2,645 by 36 feet (806 x 11 m). For the 12-month period ending November 23, 2011, the airport had 2,982 aircraft operations, an average of 248 per month: 99% general aviation and 1% military. At that time there were 20 aircraft based at this airport: 95% single-engine and 5% multi-engine. The airport was bought for $9 million in 2014 by Alaskan Property Management, a subsidiary of Management Science Associates, after the former owner filed for bankruptcy.https://triblive.com/local/valley-news-dispatch/west-deer- officials-left-to-wonder-about-status-of-airport-property/ As of March 2019 no aircraft are using the facility.https://triblive.com/local/valley-news- dispatch/west-deer-officials-left-to-wonder-about-status-of-airport-property/  Incidents  On May 11, 2011 shortly after 1:45pm two students, a science teacher, and a pilot attempted a takeoff on runway 35.

The inner- and outer-arm dyneins, which bridge between the doublet microtubules in axonemes, are the force-generating proteins responsible for the sliding movement in axonemes. The intermediate and light chains, thought to form the base of the dynein arm, help mediate attachment and may also participate in regulating dynein activity. This gene encodes an intermediate chain dynein, belonging to the large family of motor proteins. Mutations in this gene result in abnormal ciliary ultrastructure and function associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and Kartagener syndrome. The DNAi1 gene (axonemal dynein intermediate chain 1 gene 1) is a gene involved in the development of proper respiratory function, motility of spermatozoa, and asymmetrical organization of the viscera during embryogenesis. This gene affects these three very different aspects of development because all three are dependent on proper cilia function. DNAi1 codes for the development of cilia ultrastructure in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, spermatozoa flagellae, and nodal cilia (cilia of the primitive node). DNAi1 specifically encodes for an intermediate chain of the outer dynein arm. Each dynein arm of the ciliary axoneme has an inner and outer dynein arm. A mutation in DNAi1 can lead to defective ciliary beating. A DNAi1 gene mutation accounts for 4-10% of all cases of primary ciliary dyskensia (PCD). The most frequent structural defect in cilia of PCD patients are abnormal dynein arms. A common mutation of DNAi1 leading to PCD is a hot-spot mutation in intron 1 of the gene. Mutations in coding or splicing are only found in 10% of PCD cases.

In January 1465, Woodville's sister, Elizabeth, queen consort of King Edward IV of England, procured his marriage to Catherine Neville, Dowager Duchess of Norfolk (born c. 1400 ‚Äì died after 1483), who was aunt to the powerful Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick.Harris, Barbara J., English Aristocratic Women, 1450-1550: Marriage and Family, Property and Careers, Oxford University Press, New York, 2002, p.161. As the Duchess was about 65 years of age at the time and Woodville was only 19, the marriage was seen by all, particularly Warwick, as an indecent grasp for money and power by the Woodville family. One chronicler described it as a \\"maritagium diabolicum\\" (the diabolical marriage).Ross, Charles Derek, Edward IV, University of California Press, 1974, P.93. In 1465, John was appointed Knight of the Order of the Bath by his brother-in-law, the King.Ross, p.95. In 1469, Woodville and his father accompanied King Edward on a march north, to put down what was thought to be a minor rebellion supporting Edward's brother the Duke of Clarence as the legitimate king. Before they met the rebels both Clarence and Warwick had announced their support for the rebellion; by the time the King met the rebels, the rebel force was far stronger than his. In a parley, the rebels told the King that they had no fight with him but advised him to distance himself from the Woodvilles. In no position to argue, the King sent the Woodville party away. Woodville and Rivers went first to the Rivers' house at Grafton and from there made their way westwards towards Wales. They were captured by Warwick's men on the western bank of the Severn and taken to Coventry in Warwickshire. Before leaving Calais to support the uprising, Warwick had published a manifesto citing the Woodvilles in general, and the Earl and John Woodville specifically, as his reason for supporting Clarence against the King. The publication of this manifesto was deemed, by Warwick, to justify the execution of Rivers and his son. They were beheaded on 12 August at Kenilworth and their heads placed on spikes above the gates of Coventry. Woodville died childless.

The human tenants of this apartment are John and Pat, who have just returned from seeing a Greta Garbo movie in a local movie theater. Their neighbors are Bob and Constance, a married couple going through some rough times in their relationship. Because of their failing relationship, Bob becomes depressed. Meanwhile the Logan brothers are looking for their bowling trophies stolen three years earlier. The brothers have turned their happy life of bowling into a life of vengeance. Brautigan tried to have all the main characters in the story have an intersection that is comically sad. Richard Brautigan got the name Willard in the novel from his friend Stanley Fullerton's papier-m√¢ch√© bird named Willard and, in fact, a bird is on the front cover of the novel. In 2018, filmmaker Kansas Bowling and musician Kat Meoz shot the only existing footage of the real Willard for a music video for Meoz's song \\"Here I Wait\\".https://www.popmatters.com/kat-meoz-here-i-wait-2526591339.html References *Brautigan, Richard (1975).

Code ¬ß 121.01 et seq. agency charged with ensuring \\"a balance between wise use and protection of our natural resources for the benefit of all.\\" ODNR regulates the oil and gas industry, the mining industry, hunting and fishing, and dams, while maintaining natural resources such as state parks, state nature preserves, state wildlife areas, state forests, and state waterways. It was created in 1949 by the Ohio Legislature. ODNR owns and manages more than 640,000 acres of land including 75 state parks, 23 state forests, 136 state nature preserves and 150 wildlife areas. The department has jurisdiction over more than 61,500 miles of inland rivers and streams, 451 miles of the Ohio River and 2.29 million acres of Lake Erie. ODNR is responsible for overseeing and permitting all mineral extraction, monitoring dam safety, managing water resources and mapping the state's major geologic structures and mineral resources. In addition, ODNR also oversees the registration of all of Ohio's watercraft and issues all of the state's hunting and fishing licenses. ODNR has two main focuses, regulating the use of Ohio's vast reserve of natural resources while providing all of our visitors with the recreational opportunities that these resources provide. It is ODNR's job to continually protect Ohio's natural resources for long-term sustainability and enjoyment for all Ohioans. Divisions of ODNR include: *Division of Engineering - provides professional and technical engineering and related support required by ODNR to help plan, implement, and manage capital improvement programs, construction and renovation projects, and coordinate road and facility maintenance. *Division of Forestry - operates and maintains Ohio's 23 state forests, encompassing nearly 200,000 acres. The division creates recreation opportunities for Ohioans, improves the health of Ohio's public and private forests, and protects our state from forest fires, pollution and other threats. State foresters are experts at managing Ohio's largest renewable resource. *Division of Geological Survey - Ohio's abundant natural resources depend, in large part, on the underlying geology. The topography and chemistry of Ohio's underlying rocks and soils help dictate what plants and animals live and thrive here. The Division's mission is to provide geologic information and services needed for responsible management of Ohio's natural resources. *Division of Mineral Resources Management - charged with regulating coal and industrial mineral mining in Ohio while also protecting the public, miners, and the environment. The Division's mission is to provide for the safe and environmentally sound development and restoration of mineral and fossil fuel extraction sites. *Division of Natural Areas and Preserves - protects some of the best remaining examples of Ohio's rich ecological history. These diverse areas of land contain remnants of Ohio's pre-settlement past, rare and endangered species, and remarkable geologic features. Today, 136 state nature preserves and natural areas protect more than 30,000 acres. *Division of Oil and Gas Resource Management - regulates Ohio's oil and natural gas industry by protecting Ohioans and the environment while ensuring that the state's natural resources are managed and developed responsibly. *Division of Parks and Watercraft - the state's primary provider of outdoor recreational experiences, with 75 parks located in 59 counties. The division's mission is to provide exceptional outdoor recreational and boating opportunities by balancing outstanding customer service, education, and protection and conservation of Ohio's state parks and waterways. *Division of Water Resources - ensures the wise management of Ohio's water resources and infrastructure through three primary programs: Dam Safety, Floodplain Management, and Water Inventory and Planning. *Division of Wildlife - Ohio offers world-class opportunities for fishing, hunting, trapping, bird watching, wildlife viewing and other forms of fish and wildlife recreation in 150 state wildlife areas, encompassing 204,000 acres of public land. *Office of Coastal Management - focuses on helping communities plan and implement sustainable restoration and enhancement projects that support their local economy.

Burgess was a graduate of Colgate University, playing from 1982 to 1985, and was inducted into the Colgate University Athletic Hall of Honor in 1986. As a senior on the 1985 squad, he was named honorable mention Associated Press All-American after setting 14 school records in passing and total offense. He finished ninth in the nation in total offense with 266.1 yards per game. Burgess also received Colgate's Andy Kerr Trophy, given annually to the squad's most valuable offensive player. He threw for a school-record 2,565 yards in 1985 and gained a school-record 2,927 yards of total offense. He moved to Canada in 1986, and played for the Ottawa Rough Riders, the Saskatchewan Roughriders and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He was instrumental in the Roughriders playoff run for their 1989 Grey Cup victory and quarterbacked the Blue Bombers to a Grey Cup win in 1990. Burgess was named the Grey Cup's Most Valuable Player on Offence of the 78th Grey Cup. Tom Burgess was part of a quarterback tandem in Saskatchewan with Kent Austin. Burgess defeated the 16-2 Edmonton Eskimos in the 1989 CFL Western Final replacing an injured Austin who would return to start and win the 1989 Grey Cup. Both quarterbacks were capable starters and Burgess requested a trade in the off-season to pursue a full-time starting opportunity, getting that chance with the Blue Bombers. Burgess was a full-time starter for the next five seasons. He won a Grey Cup starting with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1990, and became an East Division All-Star selection. He enjoyed a 5,000 yard, 30 TD passing season with Ottawa. He spent his final two seasons as a Roughrider and was inducted into the Saskatchewan Roughrider Plaza of Honor in 2009.

Histones are basic nuclear proteins responsible for nucleosome structure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Two molecules of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form an octamer, around which approximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in repeating units, called nucleosomes. The linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a member of the histone H1 family. Transcripts from this gene lack polyA tails but instead contain a palindromic termination element.

Early life  Cleary is originally from Cranbrook, Kent, in the south-east of England. He attended Colliers Green Primary School, Angley Secondary and then Cranbrook School. His father played guitar but it was his uncle, returning from trips to America bringing recordings of Professor Longhair and others, who inspired his love for R&B.; Cleary's focus was always more on art and music and everything that goes with it, than academic pursuits and soon left schooling behind to develop a life in music. Jon Cleary & The Absolute Monster Gentlemen Jon Cleary, Cornell Williams (b) & A.J.

The school was founded in 1895. The school was the first in Northern Minnesota to offer courses in the International Baccalaureate program, and offered the University Of Minnesota's College in the Schools Program, and Project Lead the Way, a project in conjunction with the Itasca Community College. GRHS's school song is the \\"Rapids Rouser\\". Similar to other northern Minnesota high schools, GRHS has two homecomings: the traditional Fall Homecoming for American football and a winter homecoming for ice hockey. The school also has a \\"Spring Fling\\", similar to a homecoming week. All three events are usually a week long, with a different dress-up theme each day, with Friday being Orange & Black (the school colors) Day. Friday also commonly has a shortened class schedule with a pep fest in the morning.

S. Geological Survey map of the area of interest The Piscataqua River border dispute was a dispute between the US states of Maine and New Hampshire over ownership of Seavey‚Äôs Island in the Piscataqua River, which forms the border between Maine and New Hampshire. The dispute was settled in 2002 by the US Supreme Court in favor of Maine. Background Seavey‚Äôs Island lies in the northern side of the Piscataqua River, between the town of Kittery, Maine, and the city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The island was originally five separate islands which were conjoined between 1800 and 1866 in order to build a naval shipyard. The State of Maine asserts that the boundary between the states runs along the middle of the river to the south of Seavey‚Äôs Island, which places the island within Maine. The State of New Hampshire asserts a historical claim to ownership of the river up to the shoreline on the Maine side, which would place the island within New Hampshire.The New York Times, June 30, 2000: ‚ÄúSupreme Court Roundup; Border Dispute Will Get a Hearing‚Äù The United States government owns the island, which is the site of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. For many years the US Navy regarded the shipyard as belonging to New Hampshire (whence the name Portsmouth Naval Shipyard after the city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire). Later the Navy adopted a neutral position in the dispute. Maine imposes an income tax on workers at the shipyard, even those who live in New Hampshire. Moreover, aspects of the income tax are based on household income and result in larger payments due to the earnings of spouses who neither live nor work in Maine. New Hampshire contended that since the workers live in New Hampshire, paying taxes to Maine amounted to ‚Äútaxation without representation.‚ÄùNorthwestern University, Medill Journalism: ‚ÄúNew Hampshire v. Maine‚Äù, by Dave Clark, Medill News Service Maine receives an estimated to per year in taxes from the shipyard workers.Portsmouth Herald ‚ÄúTaxation without Representation‚Äù Supreme Court case In March 2000 New Hampshire filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court against Maine, claiming ownership of the island.Oyez.org: New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742 (2001) According to the US Constitution, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in cases ‚Äúin which a State shall be a Party‚Äù. In 1977, New Hampshire had sued Maine (see New Hampshire v. Maine) over lobster fishing rights in the littoral waters off the Piscataqua River. In that case the Supreme Court entered a consent decree between the states, in which they agreed that the ‚Äúmiddle of the river‚Äù was defined as the thalweg -- ‚Äúthe middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River.‚ÄùFindLaw.com: New Hampshire v. Maine, 426 US 363 (1977) The settlement was based on a 1740 decree by King George II, defining the border between the states as the middle of the main navigation channel. The 1977 case, however, was concerned only with the ‚Äúlateral marine boundary‚Äù (littoral waters) between the mouth of the river and the Isles of Shoals, and did not strictly address the inland boundaries between the states.AdmiraltyLawGuide, New Hampshire v. Maine (PDF)Portsmouth Herald: ‚ÄúBorder dispute is back on local agenda‚Äù Maine responded to the 2001 suit with a request to dismiss based on the principle of res judicata, arguing that the 1740 decision and the outcome of the 1977 case barred New Hampshire from filing another border complaint. Indeed, the case was dismissed on procedural grounds, not decided on the arguments. On May 29, 2001, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the 8‚Äì0 decision of the Court. (Justice Souter recused himself from the decision; although justices often do not disclose their reasons for recusal, it is most likely because he had been the Attorney General of New Hampshire and later an associate justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court in the 1970s and 1980s.) Justice Ginsburg wrote that \\"judicial estoppel bars New Hampshire from asserting that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore.\\" Under the judicial estoppel doctrine, ‚ÄúWhere a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him...‚Äù Put simply: Since New Hampshire had agreed in 1977 that the border runs along the middle of the river, New Hampshire may not now claim that the border runs along the Maine riverbank. Wrote Justice Ginsburg: ‚ÄúNew Hampshire‚Äôs claim that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore is clearly inconsistent with its interpretation of the words ‚ÄòMiddle of the River‚Äô during the 1970s litigation.‚Äù New Hampshire appealed the dismissal and requested the Court to reconsider its dismissal, but the Court denied the motion to reconsider.New Hampshire Department of Justice News Release, August 6, 2001 See also * New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated regarding New Hampshire‚Äôs borders with Maine and other states ReferencesExternal links * Justia.com: The consent decree in New Hampshire v.

It is generally considered to be a step up in complexity from Axis & Allies, while being less complex than such games as Advanced Third Reich. Europe Engulfed is notable for its Special Action mechanism. Special Actions represent concentrated logistical effort, and as such are fairly costly, but also powerful. Special Actions may be spent to allow for large territorial gains in a single turn, such as the German conquest of France; or the British evacuation from Dunkirk. Neither of these require any \\"special\\" rules outside the basic game system. This is a feat which few World War II European Theater games have accomplished. Now in its 2nd edition, the game features several scenarios: 1939-'45, 1941-'45, 1941-'43 tournament, European War (where Soviet Russia attacks Germany in 1939) and a Patton's Fantasy scenario, which pits the Western Allies against the Soviets after the fall of Germany during the remainder of 1945. Europe Engulfed makes use of a blocks unit system, with each block representing a unit of either infantry, cavalry, airborne assault troops or armor. Each block can be 1, 2, 3 or 4 step, with 4 steps being the unit at maximum strength, whereas Germany and Soviet Russia can also deploy a number of elite and militia units. The actual nature of each block is hidden from the enemy until actual combat occurs. (The designers considered Blockskrieg! as a name for the game, before settling for Europe Engulfed. Naval/air warfare is significantly abstracted, leaving ground combat as the essential ingredient of the game. In 2007, GMT released a sequel, called Asia Engulfed, which focuses on the Asian-Pacific theater. This game has a completely revamped naval/air system.

History  ENPP7 is a new name for an old enzyme whose activity was originally identified in 1969 by Nilsson as a type of sphingomyelinase that hydrolyses sphingomyelin to ceramide in the intestinal tract. The enzyme was then purified and characterized by Duan et al. and named alkaline sphingomyelinase (alk-SMase), as the optimal pH of the enzyme was 9.0 and its main substrate is sphingomyelin. Most previous studies used the name of alk-SMase for this protein. The name of ENPP7 was created based on the results of cloning studies which show that alk-SMase shares no structural similarities with either acid or neutral SMase but belongs to the family of ecto nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (ENPP). As a new addition to the family it is therefore called ENPP7 or NPP7. A 3D homology model of ENPP7 was recently constructed using the crystal structural of an NPP member in bacteria as a template.  Tissue distribution  Differing from other ENPP members, ENPP7 seems only expressed in the intestinal mucosa in many species and additionally in human liver. In the intestinal tract, ENPP7 activity is low in the duodenum and colon but high in the middle of the jejunum. As an ecto enzyme, ENPP7 is located on the surface of the intestinal mucosa and is released in the lumen by bile salt and pancreatic trypsin. The enzyme expressed in human liver is released in the bile and delivered to the intestine. The activity of ENPP7 depends specifically on two types of primary bile salts, taurocholate (TC) and taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC) at critical micelle concentrations. Other detergents, such as CHAPS and Triton X-100 have no stimulatory effects rather inhibitory effects, indicating a biologic interaction between bile salts and the enzyme. Unlike acid and neutral SMases in the intestinal tract that are rapidly inactivated by pancreatic trypsin, alk-SMase is resistant to trypsin digestion. Thus ENPP7 is active in the intestinal lumen and is transported along the intestinal tract. Significant activity can be detected in the faeces. The substrates of ENPP family vary greatly. Some have activity against nucleotides, some have activity against phospholipid and lysophospholipids. ENPP7 is the only enzyme that has a type of phospholipase C activity against sphingomyelin.  Physiological functions and clinical implications  ENPP7 is the key enzyme in the gut that digests sphingomyelin. Sphingomyelin is a lipid constituent of cell membrane, and a dietary component being particularly abundant in milk, cheese, egg, and meat. Digestion of sphingomyelin mainly occurs in the middle part of the small intestine, where ENPP7 is abundant, indicating a role of the enzyme in sphingomyelin digestion. Recent studies on ENPP7 knockout mice clearly showed that digestion of sphingomyelin and generation of ceramide is severely affected in ENPP7 deficiency mice. ENPP7 is fully developed in the intestine before birth, which gives the infant ability to digest sphingomyelin in the milk. The daily intake of sphingomyelin for human with Western diet is about 300 mg. Under physiological conditions, only part of the sphingomyelin can be digested and absorbed. The limitation is thought to be caused by several factors that are present in the intestine such as cholesterol, phospholipids, fat and high concentrations of bile salts. It is thus understandable why SM digestion occurs most effectively in the low part of the small intestine, where most fat, phospholipids, and bile salt have been absorbed or up taken. It is also understandable that considerable amount of dietary sphingomyelin is delivered into the colon and excreted in the feces. ENPP7 may have important roles in preventing tumorigenesis in the intestinal tract, as ceramide, the product of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, can inhibit cell proliferation and stimulate cell differentiation and apoptosis. Animal studies showed that supplement of SM or ceramide in the diet may inhibit the development of colon cancer. Of particular interest is that the activity of ENPP7 is significantly decreased in human colorectal adenoma and carcinoma as well as in the feces of the cancer patients. The decrease is caused by expression of a few mutant forms of ENPP7, which lack exon 4, resulting in total inactivation of the enzyme, as found in human colon and liver cancer cells. Besides sphingomyelin, ENPP7 can also degrade and inactivate platelet-activating factor (PAF), which is proinflammatory, indicating that ENPP7 may also have antiinflammatory effects. Rectal administration of recombinant ENPP7 has been shown to improve ulcerative colitis in an animal study, and patients with chronic ulcerative colitis are associated with a reduced ENPP7 activity. ENPP7 may also affect cholesterol absorption. In the intestinal tract cholesterol and sphingomyelin are co-exiting in plasma membrane and in lipid vesicles, liposomes and micelles. The two molecules form a stable complex via van der Waals forces. Cholesterol absorption can be inhibited by supplementation of sphingomyelin in the diet. Milk sphingomyelin seems more potent than egg sphingomyelin, indicating that the inhibition is related to the degree of the saturation and the length of sphingomyelin. Recent studies further showed that formation of ceramide by ENPP7 in the gut enhanced sphingomyelin-induced inhibition of cholesterol, indicating regulatory roles of ENPP7 in cholesterol absorption.  Regulation  The expression of ENPP7 can be modified by dietary factors. High fat diet (53% energy) greatly reduces ENPP7 activities and enzyme protein in the intestinal mucosa by 50%. On the other hand, water-soluble fiber psyllium was shown to increase both the activities and protein of ENPP7 in the colon of mice. Sphingomyelin can also increase the levels of ENPP7 after a long term of administration. Besides, ursodeoxycholic acid and probiotic VSL#3 may stimulate the expression of ENPP7 in the intestine.

Headquartered in Englewood, New Jersey, it is a private corporation, and sells its products under the Sabrett brand name. History Samuel Ogus (1891-1970), who emigrated from Latvia in 1909, started the wholesale bakery, the Star Baking Company, later to become Sabrett Food Products, in 1928 with a partner, Fritz Frankel. Mr. Ogus was what they used to call the \\"inside\\" man - running the factory and even designing much of the equipment, and Mr. Frankel was the \\"outside\\" man, dealing directly with the sales force and the customers. A few years later in the 1930s, the two men realized there was an increasing demand for hot dog rolls - their slogan was \\"largest hot dog roll manufacturer in the world!\\" - and they decided to manufacture hot dogs as well. They planned to call the combined company Star but the meat company Armour/Star objected, so they chose Sabre with the slogan \\"keen on quality.‚Äù They couldn't use that name either because there was a Sabre tuna fish company. So they decided on Sabrett, a little saber, \\"small and sharp.\\" The company was located on the lower East Side, on East 3rd Street. During the Great Depression hotdogs were particularly popular because you could get a meal for twenty-five cents. Sabrett moved the bakery and then the hot-dog factory to Jersey City in the late forties. Sabrett was known for spicy, all-beef casing kosher-style hotdogs. The ubiquitous hotdog carts bought exclusively from Sabrett's but were independently owned. Sometimes one owner had several carts. Major Sabrett customers also included Nathan's Famous in Coney Island, Papaya King and the Stevens Company who supplied hotdogs to all the ballparks. Eventually, Sabrett expanded to supermarkets and went national. Mr. Frankel had a daughter, Pearl and a son, Jules. Pearl married Kurt Teitler and both Kurt and Jules Frankel joined Sabrett. Mr. Ogus had one daughter, Marilyn, who married Maurice B. \\"Mac\\" Katz (1927-1990). Mac Katz joined the business in 1958 and ran it with Mr. Ogus, Kurt Teitler and Jules Frankel. After Fritz Frankel and Jules Frankel died, Pearl and Kurt's two daughters, Ellen and Cherri, had married, and their husbands, Eric Merlin and Boyd Adelman entered the business in the 1960s. For over thirty years, Sabrett was run by the son-in-law (Mac) and the grandsons-in-law, (Eric and Boyd) of the two original founders. Hans Mueller, a German immigrant, was a sausage maker at Sabrett from 1956-1994, and the 'working foreman' from the mid-1970s until 1994. When Sabrett was sold to Gregory Papalexsis of Marathon Industries in 1989, only Boyd Adelman remained in management. Marathon bought rights to retain the Sabrett name which is synonymous with hotdogs in New York City. Products=Frankfurters= The company's flagship product is the Sabrett brand frankfurter. They and other meats such as pastrami and salami are processed at the Marathon factory in the Bronx, New York. The frankfurters are sold through Sabrett branded carts on the streets of New York City and elsewhere in the metropolitan area, local supermarkets, and club locations such as BJ's, Costco, and Jetro. =Condiments= Other products sold under the Sabrett brand name include condiments popular on hot dogs such as sauerkraut, sweet relish, spicy brown mustard, and a red onion sauce known as \\"Sabrett's Prepared Onions.\\"  See also  * Alan Geisler * Catering * Concession stand * Fast food * Food booth *Food cart *Food street * Hot dog * Hot dog stand * List of street food * List of snack foods * Snack food * Street market ReferencesExternal links *Sabrett Hot Dogs Category:Companies based in Bergen County, New Jersey Category:Englewood, New Jersey Category:Meat companies of the United States Category:Brand name hot dogs Category:Hot dog restaurants Category:Street food Category:Sausage companies of the United States Category:Condiment companies of the United States ","title":"Marathon Enterprises, Inc."},{"id":"15071611","text":"L‚Äô√éle des esclaves () is a one act comedy by Pierre de Marivaux.

Dimerization with other BHLH proteins is required for efficient DNA binding. Involved in the determination of the neuronal precursors in the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. Ascl2 plays a critical role in early gestation, with its products showing up in the oocyte and the two-cell stage of the zygote. This gene has its primary role after implantation of the developing embryo. It is expressed in trophoblast cells on the maternal allele. Its expression is required for the progenitor cells within the ectoplacental cone (EPC), which establishes the first functional maternal-fetal interactions before placental development is completed. The ectoplacental cone continues to develop and differentiate into other cell types which express the Ascl2 gene in the differentiated derivatives. It is specifically found in the spongiotrophoblast cells of the junctional zone. In the mature placenta, glycogen trophoblast (Gly2) cells are found in the junctional zone. Without Ascl2, the GlyT cells are not found and even though these cells develop later in gestation, its progenitor cells are established early on. If a null allele is inherited, the embryo will fail to develop. Insufficient Ascl2 function is also associated with a placenta that has phenotypic defects, which leads to growth retardation.

This gene encodes a member of the glycosyltransferase superfamily. The encoded protein is a single-pass type II Golgi membrane protein that functions as a fucose-specific glycosyltransferase, adding an N-acetylglucosamine to the fucose residue of a group of signaling receptors involved in regulating cell fate decisions during development. Mutations in this gene have been associated with autosomal recessive spondylocostal dysostosis 3. Alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have been described, however, not all variants have been fully characterized.  Function  Lunatic Fringe (Lfng) is a gene whose role in embryonic development is to establish the anterior boundary of somites, which will eventually develop in vertebrae, ribs, and dermis. Lunatic Fringe responds to certain threshold ratios of retinoic acid and FGF-8 in order to mark the anterior boundary of somites while another transcription factor, Hairy, responds to different threshold ratios of retinoic acid and FGF-8 to form the posterior boundaries of somites.  Clinical significance  A defect associated with Lfng mutations is spondylocostal dysostosis. Spondylocostal dysostosis is characterized by segmentation problems in the developing vertebrae resulting in fusion or lack of vertebrae along with abnormalities in the ribs. Clinically, spondylocostal dysostosis presents as a shortened neck and trunk relative total height and a mild form of scoliosis. Respiratory problems are also common in spondylocostal dysostosis because of the shortened trunk. A knockout model for Lfng has been created in mice, and without Lfng, mice have shorter tails, and impaired rib, lung, and somite development. A deficiency of Lfng in male mice has also been associated with lack of spermatozoa in the epididymis of many mice; however, spermatogenesis was not impaired. Rather, the male mice were subfertile. In female mice, Lfng deficiency led to infertility because of abnormal folliculogenesis. Further examination showed that oocytes from these female mice did not complete meiotic maturation. However, there are other studies that contradict this stating that not all female mice deficient of Lfng are infertile. A possible explanation for this difference between these studies is that the Lfng alleles were functional different, however, this is unlikely. More likely is that this discrepancy results from differences in the genetic background of the mice or husbandry and colony conditions.  Impact of mutation  Lunatic Fringe is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the somites. Somites give rise to the skeletal muscle, the axial skeleton, the tendons, and the dorsal dermis. The somites are formed via the clock-wave front model, and as each somite is formed, each cell receives a burst of FGF8 (a signaling molecule). Somites are formed anterior to posterior, and since FGF8 has a short half-life, this leads to a greater concentration of FGF8 in the posterior, and a lesser concentration in the anterior. Lunatic fringe responds to the lower concentration of FGF8 in the anterior and leads these cells to their developmental fate. Mutation of the Lunatic Fringe gene can cause severe Spondylocostal Dysostosis, which involves vertebral segmentation defects and rib abnormalities. A mutation was discovered in which a conservative phenylalanine close to the active site of the enzyme mutates, leading to the enzymatic inactivation of Lunatic Fringe. A ‚Äúknock-out‚Äù model has been created using mice. In mice, Lunatic Fringe plays a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathway during the formation of somites, and a mutation in this gene leads to somites with irregular shapes and a defect in the anterior-posterior formation.

He was baptized at the New Hurley Reformed Church in Shawangunk, Ulster County, New York. William's two siblings were Benjamin Cornelius Hasbrouck (b. 1803) and Margaret Hasbrouck (b. 1803). William C. Hasbrouck graduated from Union College in Schenectady and lived for a time in Franklin, Tennessee, where he served as Principal of the academy founded by Bishop Otey. After returning to the North, he briefly worked as Principal of the Farmer's Hall Academy in Goshen in the early 1820s and then studied law with various lawyers in Newburgh, and was admitted to the bar in 1826. Asher B. Durand Hasbrouck was Trustee of Newburgh from 1835‚Äì1839, and lieutenant and later captain of a local militia at Newburgh called The Village Guard. He was a Whig member from Orange County of the New York State Assembly, and was Speaker in 1847. In Newburgh, he practiced law with attorney James Taylor, operating under Hasbrouck & Taylor. They apprenticed many young men, including Hasbrouck's nephew, William James Roe II. William Hasbrouck was a descendant of the Hasbroucks who founded New Paltz, located in New York's Hudson Valley, in 1678. The Hasbroucks were Huguenots, Protestant followers of John Calvin who fled what is today Northern France and South Belgium who fled persecution by the ruling Catholics.

Around 1916, the name was changed to Leesdale Avenue when the city of Los Angeles annexed the San Fernando Valley after the Los Angeles Aqueduct was completed. In the mid-1920s, the Leesdale Improvement Association unveiled plans to expand Leesdale Avenue as an -wide \\"great east- and-west boulevard\\" through the Valley. At that time, the City also changed the name to Victory Boulevard, in honor of soldiers returning from World War I, and paved the boulevard as far west as Balboa Boulevard where it ended.

It has been displaced about 600 km northward since the Cenozoic along the Queen Charlotte- Fairweather fault system. The Yakutat Block is bounded on the northeast by the Fairweather Fault, and on the north by a system of thrust and possibly strike- slip faults in the Chugach Mountains and St. Elias Mountains. The Yakutat Block is bounded on its southwest side by an as yet undefined underwater geologic feature known as the Transition Zone. Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements indicate that the Yakutat block has a distinctive velocity relative to both the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. Thus it appears to be a terrane in the process of accreting rather than a block already sutured on to the Pacific or North American plate. Relative to North America, the Yakutat Block moves at a rate of about 45 mm/yr to the north northwest, along the Fairweather fault. There is about 20 mm/yr of contraction between the Yakutat block and the Pacific plate, which is probably accommodated on an offshore structure. South of Yakutat Bay, the boundary between the Yakutat block and the North American plate is once again along the Fairweather Fault. North of Yakutat Bay, between Yakutat Bay and the Copper River/Wrangell Mountains region, about 40 mm/yr of contraction is taken up by compression, accommodated by faults within the continental crust. The convergence rate is among the highest in the world within continental crust, surpassing even that which is occurring between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate which is lifting the Himalayas.

Licensed to Sierra Vista, Arizona, United States, the station serves the Southwestern Cochise County area. The station is currently owned by CCR-Sierra Vista IV, LLC (Cherry Creek Media) and features programing from CBS Radio and Premiere Radio Networks. History This station originally went on the air on July 30, 1957 as a daytime-only station with a power of 1,000 watts, using the call letters KHFH (Historic Fort Huachuca). This station was the first radio station in Sierra Vista and the third radio station in Cochise County. The first, KSUN in Bisbee, (now defunct) went on the air in 1933, and the second, KAWT (now KDAP) in Douglas, came to air in 1947. All three stations were owned by Carleton Morris and KHFH was the most powerful of the three. The studio was located at the intersection of Carmichael Avenue and DePalma St. (now 700 Carmichael Ave.) and the transmitter was located in an undeveloped area in the southeast part of town, now 2300 Busby Drive. In August 1958, the license holder requested permission from the FCC to operate at night for one night only in order to broadcast election result; the FCC denied the request. The station was finally granted nighttime operations on September 5, 1962 with a power of 500 watts with a directional pattern. At the same time that nighttime operations began, the studios were relocated to the transmitter site.FCC History Cards KHFH was the only radio station in a small town adjacent to a military base (Ft. Huachuca), so they used to broadcast a variety of programming to suit everyone's preferences. They broadcast a \\"middle of the road\\" format the morning, country/western in the afternoon, top 40/rock and roll at night and classical on Sunday evenings. Due to a significant number of German speaking people in the area, the station also broadcast one hour a week of programming in German, both music and talk; even the commercials were in the German language. In addition to the variety of musical formats, they also broadcast the local high school football, basketball and baseball games, both home and away, along with local news several times a day. Huachuca Broadcasting Company became the licensee in 1966 in the wake of Carleton Morris's 1962 death. The call letters were changed to KTAN in September 1973 when a sister station was added, KTAN-FM 100.9 (now co-owned KZMK). The KTAN callsign had previously been used at 580 AM in Tucson between 1959 and 1967, and before that, it had been in use in Sherman, Texas. The FM station then broadcast a top 40/rock and roll format while the AM station broadcast a \\"middle of the road\\" format. The country/western and classical formats were dropped, but the local news and local high school sports broadcasts remained. KTAN changed to a country/western format from 1979 to 1998, which persisted under four different owners. From 1998 to 1999, it broadcast a contemporary Christian format. In 1999, KTAN switched to a news/talk format, that became popular with AM stations in the 1990s. They aired popular conservative talk shows plus some local talk shows.americanradiohistory.com Cherry Creek Radio acquired the station from Commonwealth Broadcasting in 2003. In July 2015, KTAN switched their programing to classic country/western. This was done because of declining advertising revenues.

(cartoon pictured) Leo Laliman was a winegrower and viticulturist from Bordeaux, France. He, along with fellow winegrower Gaston Bazille, is largely accredited for the discovery that when European vines are grafted with suitable American rootstock, they become resistant to grape phylloxera. This discovery was very relevant at the time, when France was suffering from a severe wine blight induced by the same phylloxera. While Laliman was praised for his discovery, he was also a controversial figure at the time; for undocumented reasons, he was also branded by many as the introducer of the phylloxera, and, by extension, the crippling blight that came with it.  Background  The blight, termed the Great French Wine Blight, was a severe blight of the mid-19th century that resulted in the destruction of over 4 million vineyards and 40% of all the grape vines in France, and that subsequently laid waste to the wine industry there. This blight was brought on by a species of aphid that originated in North America and was carried across the Atlantic Ocean sometime in the late 1850s/early 1860s.Phylloxera, from The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2004 However, how the phyolloxera had survived the journey remained a point of much debate; Europeans had experimented with American vines for centuries without any pestilential problems. Eventually, it was decided that, following the invention of steamboats, the grape phylloxera were able to survive the shortened journey. Charles Valentine Riley. The first instance of the blight was recorded sometime in the early 1860s,Viticulture: An Introduction to Commercial Grape Growing for Wine Production. Published 2007. and France suffered the blight for a 15-year period, without any solution. Eventually, Jules-Emile Planchon and two colleagues made an important discovery; the discovery that sourced the aphid phylloxera to the blight itself ‚Äî up until then, the source of the damage was unknown. In 1870, American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley confirmed Planchon's theory.Smith, C. M. (2005) Plant Resistance to Arthropods: molecular and Conventional Approaches. Springer. However, this discovery caused controversy; some met it with optimism, saying that now that the cause had been found, it would just be a matter of elimination. Others disagreed completely with the theory, saying that the grape phylloxera were merely a symptom, an effect, of the blight, rather than the source.  Solution  Shortly after Riley confirmed the theory proposed by Planchon, Laliman and Bazille, up until then two unknown winegrowers, proposed that the European vines, of the vinifera variety, may form a resistance to the destructive phylloxera if they were grafted with the American vine variety, which had formed a natural resistance. The idea was tested, and proved successful.Allan J. Tobin, Jennie Dusheck Asking about Life. Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2004. , p. 628. Following this, France became divided again. Some, referred to as the \\"chemists\\", persisted with the use of pesticides and chemicals, while others, known as \\"Americanists\\", tried Laliman and Bazille's method. = Reward = The French government had, in desperation, offered a reward of over 320,000 Francs to anyone who could find a cure for the blight. Laliman, who was accredited over Bazille for the grafting solution, attempted to claim the prize money. However, the French government refused to award Laliman the money, claiming he had simply prevented the phylloxera's occurrence, rather than found a cure for it. However, it is speculated that there may have been other reasons that the French government refused to give Laliman the prize money; the idea of grafting rootstock for agricultural advantage was not a completely novel concept, and he was also mistrusted among a large portion of the population. = Controversy = Laliman became quite a controversial figure following his and Bazille's discovery. While he was widely acclaimed and praised for his theory and its success, and was uncontroversially accredited for finding the solution to the problem, many others mistrusted his method, and were decidedly against grafting their rootstock with American vines. Others mistrusted him personally, and some claimed that he was, in fact, responsible for the introduction of the grape phylloxera. This public suspicion of Laliman may have been the true reason that the French government was against awarding Laliman the prize for \\"curing the blight\\".

Al-Bireh is part of the Rashaya municipal district. It lies west of the road between Majdel Anjar and Rashaya. Its population is estimated to be 9000. It is a small Muslim town with two mosques and two schools. Many homes were abandoned due to emigration Geography The oldest part of the town lies on top of Jabal Arbi Mountains while the newer parts lie in the Wadi al-Taym valley and is referred to as Izza. Neighboring towns include Rafid, Kamed, Khirbet-Rouha, and Mdouckha. The town is located about 80 km from Beirut and 40 km from Damascus, Syria. From Al-Bireh, Jabal -Al-Sheikh (Mount Hermon) can be seen with its majestic snow-capped peak. Economy The Elkadri family ruins More than 60% of the town‚Äôs population have emigrated to Brazil, Argentina, United States, Canada, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal. Residents of the town have left to the US as early as the 18th Century and have aggregated in cities like Dearborn, Michigan. Many others emigrated to S√£o Paulo, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Montreal, Quebec and Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The economy of the town relies on agriculture which thrived on the water springs commonly found in Al-Bireh. The town is known for growing olives, almonds, fruits and vegetables and a variety of crops. However, the severe emigration has reduced the agriculture activities over the past three decades. Agriculture thrives in the water rich mountains Six main families inhabit the town, namely the Elkadri, Jeha (ÿ¨ÿ≠ÿß), Jumaa, Zeineddine, Abdallah, Salem and Omar families. Other families also live in the village, however increased emigration has completely dispersed some families and no members are currently residents. Notable residents Al-Bireh is the birthplace of multiple intellectuals, politicians and religious figures. The late Nazem Elkadri (MP, minister and prime minister of Lebanon) was born in Al-Bireh. The Mufti of Bekaa, Sheikh Raouf Elkadri was also born in Al-Bireh. Nassouh Elkadri (an anti-French occupation revolutionary leader) was also from Al-Bireh. History Mount Hermon or Alsheikh as seen from Al-Bireh The mountain chain upon which Al- Bireh is located is rich with history. Caves dating back to pre-historic times can be found all over the mountain. Ruins of other more modern civilizations are still very visible. The locals usually come across artifacts dating back to Phoenician, Byzantine, Roman and Canaanite eras. Many artifacts and archaeological pieces were illegally excavated out of the caves and burial grounds during the Lebanese Civil War and the Israeli occupation, however it is hoped that one day, area will be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, thus protecting one of the most important areas of human cultural heritage on Earth. Ancient caves known as Ain Almizrab Caves The town was occupied first by PLO forces in the late 1970s, then by Israeli forces in the early 1980s. Before Israel's invasion, the town suffered from Israeli warplane attacks. In one incident, several houses were bombed, killing and injuring scores of civilians . Israel did not provide explanation as to why these were bombed. Archaeology A Heavy Neolithic archaeological site of the Qaraoun culture was discovered by Auguste Bergy along a south to west track that lead from the road to a small spring. Bergy originally suggested it was a \\"Chellean factory site\\" before the Heavy Neolithic was defined by Henri Fleisch.

This gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase. Mitochondrial ATP synthase catalyzes ATP synthesis, utilizing an electrochemical gradient of protons across the inner membrane during oxidative phosphorylation.  Structure  The ATP5F1D gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.3 and it spans 3,075 base pairs. The ATP5F1D gene produces a 17.5 kDa protein composed of 168 amino acids. The coded protein is a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (Complex V), which is composed of two linked multi-subunit complexes: the soluble catalytic core, F1, and the membrane-spanning component, Fo, comprising the proton channel. The catalytic portion of mitochondrial ATP synthase consists of 5 different subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon) assembled with a stoichiometry of 3 alpha, 3 beta, and a single representative of the other 3. The proton channel consists of three main subunits (a, b, c). This gene encodes the delta subunit of the catalytic core. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same isoform have been identified. The structure of the protein has been known to resemble a 'lollipop' structure due to the attachment of the F1 catalytic unit to the mitochondrial inner membrane by the F0 unit.  Function  This gene encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (Complex V) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is necessary for the catalysis of ATP synthesis. Utilizing an electrochemical gradient of protons produced by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain, the synthase converts ADP into ATP across the inner membrane during oxidative phosphorylation. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F1 and F0, that contribute to the catalysis. The F1 domain contains an extramembranous catalytic core and the F0 domain contains the membrane proton channel linked by a central and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP turnover in the catalytic domain of F1 is coupled by a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton transport. The encoded protein is a part of the complex F1 domain and of the central stalk which is part of the complex rotary element. Rotation of the central stalk against the surrounding alpha3beta3 subunits leads to the hydrolysis of ATP in three separate catalytic sites on the beta subunits.  Clinical significance  Mutations of ATP5F1D have been associated with childhood mitochondrial disorders with phenotypes such as episodic decompensations, lactic acidosis, and hyperammonemia accompanied by ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia. Biallelic mutations of c.245C>T and c.317T>G in ATP5F1D were shown to cause a metabolic disorder with such phenotypes due to mitochondrial dysfunction in two unrelated individuals. Mutations of ATP5F1D with decreased expression of the protein has also been found to result in synaptic dysfunction of the mitochondria that could play an essential role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis.  Interactions  Among the two components, CF1 - the catalytic core - and CF0 - the membrane proton channel of the F-type ATPase, ATP5F1D is associated with the catalytic core. The catalytic core is composed of five different subunits including alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits. The protein has additional interactions with ATP5I, ATP5O, PUS1, NDUFB5, GTPBP6, ATP5L, ATP5J and others.

The NDUFA6 protein is a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain. Structure The NDUFA6 gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 22 in position 13.2 and spans 5,359 base pairs. The gene produces an 18 kDa protein composed of 154 amino acids. NDUFA6 is a subunit of the enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), the largest of the respiratory complexes. The structure is L-shaped with a long, hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centers and the NADH binding site. It has been noted that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a C-terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of Complex I. The highly conserved two- domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and that the hydrophobic domain acts as an anchor for the NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) complex at the inner mitochondrial membrane. NDUFA6 is one of about 31 hydrophobic subunits that form the transmembrane region of Complex I. The predicted secondary structure is primarily alpha helix, but the carboxy-terminal half of the protein has high potential to adopt a coiled-coil form. The amino-terminal part contains a putative beta sheet rich in hydrophobic amino acids that may serve as mitochondrial import signal. Related pseudogenes have also been identified on four other chromosomes. Function The human NDUFA6 gene codes for a subunit of Complex I of the respiratory chain, which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. Initially, NADH binds to Complex I and transfers two electrons to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic arm to form FMNH2. The electrons are transferred through a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in the prosthetic arm and finally to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), which is reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2). The flow of electrons changes the redox state of the protein, resulting in a conformational change and pK shift of the ionizable side chain, which pumps four hydrogen ions out of the mitochondrial matrix.

Beer bought out Gander in 1962. However, KAKA and short-lived sister station KTPM in Sun City went into receivership and were shuttered in 1963. Thurber's share in KSWW was bought in 1972 by Joyce Stirling, but it went bankrupt in December 1979 and was silent for 16 months. Lee Shoblom bought the silent KSWW for $80,000 and returned it to air on March 11, 1981, as country music station KUUK. Shoblom lost out on its first attempt to acquire an FM counterpart to KUUK in 1982 when Hassayampa Broadcasting was awarded the permit. However, the two stations would eventually be united. In 1983, Shoblom sold KUUK to the Wickenburg Broadcasting Company, and two years later, the same principals acquired the FM permit. On January 1, 1987, the FM station launched, and the two stations became KCIW-AM-FM with a country music format. Kenyon Communications bought the stations in 1988; upon the occasion of an FM power increase to 50,000 watts, on August 2, 1989, the two stations changed to a big-band format as KTIM-AM-FM. Interstate Broadcasting Systems of Arizona acquired both stations in the fall of 1990, but the acquisition was primarily for KTIM-FM, which Interstate planned to use as an FM counterpart to its KRDS 1190 AM. On November 27, 1990, KTIM-FM became KRDS-FM (today's KHOV-FM). With no plans for the AM station, Interstate sold it to Circle S Broadcasting, owned by Harold Shumway. Shumway renovated a former Big W restaurant to serve as station offices. Shumway then obtained an FM construction permit for Wickenburg on 93.7 MHz and signed it on as KFMA in 1992. On March 1, 1996, KTIM became KBSZ, call letters then in use by the sister FM station; soon after, however, the FM flipped to country as KSWG. The next year, Circle S sold KBSZ to SBD Broadcasting; four years later, SBD sold the station to Richard (Pete) and Joann Peterson. The Petersons relaunched the station with entirely local programming, including Wickenburg High School football games. (Continued) =In Apache Junction= On November 7, 2007, the Petersons filed to move KBSZ's transmitter and city of license from Wickenburg (about 60 miles northwest of downtown Phoenix) to Apache Junction (35 miles east of downtown Phoenix), accompanied by a frequency change to 1260 kHz on the AM dial. A month later, the station was sold to 1TV.com, Inc., owned by John Low. In 2010, KBSZ signed on from its new Apache Junction location with a Classic Hits/Oldies format targeting the residents of Apache Junction and adjacent communities. After only four months, the station adopted the a talk format on September 7, before switching to an all-comedy format. It was the first radio station on the frequency in Pinal County since KFAS Casa Grande signed off in the mid-1990s. The station had used a syndicated comedy programming service known as \\"24/7 Comedy.\\" When it ceased operations, the station wanted to keep its comedy format, so it switched programming to \\"Today's Comedy.\\" Around July 1, 2019, KBSZ fell silent without any explanation. On July 8, 2019, they posted a message on their website that they had ceased broadcasting the comedy format \\"due to circumstances beyond our control,\\" and that they would be simulcasting sister station KIKO-FM's oldies format. After nearly two weeks of broadcasting with dead air, KBSZ returned to the air with a classic rock format named \\"The Rattler\\".

The record company was sold to Warner Music Group in the early 1990s. Early days Claude Carrere started working with Annie Chancel in 1962 and renamed her Sheila, who remained his sole artist for a while. He set up Carrere Productions and the records were distributed by Philips Records. In the late 1960s, he created Disques Carrere. In 1972, he produced and distributed his own releases. A lot of singers would be signed alongside Sheila, the most important ones being Ringo (Sheila's husband), Dalida and even Claude Fran√ßois. In 1977, the disco group Sheila and B. Devotion was created and Carrere started exporting his releases. British record market Claude Carrere decided to move into the British record market after the success of La Belle √âpoque single \\"Black Is Black\\", released in the United Kingdom through EMI, which reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. He appointed Freddie Cannon Managing Director (at that time, he was Commercial A&R; Director at EMI Records UK) to head up his Carrere UK label. Cannon opened the Carrere offices at Hansa Records UK in June 1978 and signed a South African group named Clout. Carrere' UK's first release was Clout's single \\"Substitute\\", which went to number 2 in the UK Singles Chart in 1978. Cannon and A&R; Manager Peter Hinton signed power pop band the Incredible Kidda Band and followed this in 1979 with the NWOBHM band Saxon. Cannon renamed the group \\"Saxon\\", since he could not work with their original name \\"Son of a Bitch\\". Saxon released their eponymous debut album the following year and stayed with the label until 1984. In 1981, Cannon signed Australian rock bands The Church and Rose Tattoo, and Don Dokken from the US. The label released also the final album by The Buggles, 1981's Adventures in Modern Recording, which was distributed in the United States through Columbia Records. Debbie Bonham also signed to Carrere and released her critically acclaimed album For You and the Moon in 1984. Cannon, working with Carrere Italy's Managing Director Luigi Arduino and Claude Carrere, signed Italian singer Raf and secured the rights for the worldwide distribution of his hit single \\"Self Control\\" in 1984. In the same year, Peter Hinton left the company. In 1985, Carrere released \\"Move Closer\\", the only ballad from the label's Disco Queen Phyllis Nelson, and this number 1 song became the label's biggest selling single of all time in the UK. It is featured in over 300 compilations around the world. The same year, Carrere released Nana Mouskouri \\" Only You \\" that went to number 2 in the British charts and they released on the sub-label Stars Only Gloria Gaynor's single \\"My Love Is Music\\", produced by Didier Marouani. The group signed also Eros Ramazzotti and released his first hit single \\"Una Storia Importante\\". Musical reach Carrere UK went on to help develop album selling artists for the Carrere label worldwide with groups like Demon, Rage, and Jim Capaldi. Saxon, Rose Tattoo, The Church, Dokken, Eros Ramazzotti and Debbie Bonham were launched by Carrere and are still performing today. Other artists of note on the label were Princess St√©phanie of Monaco (Stephanie), Dollar, who enjoyed a number of hits with the label, and Dutch girl group Luv' that scored successful singles (including 1979's \\"Ooh, Yes I Do\\" in Europe). Boney M. and Ottawan were also huge hits for the label. FR David also had a huge international hit with \\"Words\\". Carrere UK closure In June 1988, exactly 10 years after opening the label in the UK, Cannon departed and closed down Carrere UK. He joined Pete Waterman and David Howells at PWL Records as International Director. Claude Carrere loaned his music company to Warner Music France. In 1993, Carrere closed down, but the Carrere family still has the rights for its catalogs. Claude Carrere died April 10, 2014.

The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Dual Enrollment Guidelines, 2010 Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are home schooled are eligible to participate in this program. For 2009-10 school year, the high school received $7,996. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, due to a state budget crisis.

For nearly two decades, all Pennsylvania secondary school students were required to complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania State School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the respective Keystone Exams for each course. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams.

State - 78% Special education In December 2014, the district administration reported that 17% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In 2012, the district administration reported that 18.7% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 33% have learning disabilities. In 2009, Greater Johnstown School District administration reported that 17.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 39% have learning disabilities. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-2011 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. Greater Johnstown School District has seen no decline in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. In an effort to identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding was in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports. Greater Johnstown School District received a $2,220,524 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 For the 2014-2015 school year, Greater johnstown School District received an increase to $2,272,568 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. In 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission provided a report on the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. Funding for special education programs is borne largely on a local basis at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion or 30% and the federal government providing 10% of the funding. =Least Restrictive Monitoring= In 2006, Greater Johnstown School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. Twenty school districts were tentatively identified for Tier 1 monitoring. Greater Johnstown School District received an alert letter from the PDE - Bureau of Special Education.Pennsylvania Department of Education, LRE Index Scores and Identification for Monitoring, 2010 School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. The district was placed in Tier 1 due to a high number of students being identified for special education services. Plus students were spending more than 60% of the school day, outside of regular education. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers. =Gifted education= The district administration reported that 65 or 2% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Wellness policy Greater Johnstown School Board established a district wellness policyGreater Johnstown School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, 2015 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Greater Johnstown School District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Greater Johnstown School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. ;Health eTools program: The Greater Johnstown School District participated in Highmark Foundation's Healthy High 5 Health eTools for Schools grant which enabled mobile data collection of pertinent health and physical fitness screening data on students K-12 in a database held by InnerLink, Inc. in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Health eTools for Schools also provided interdisciplinary research-based curriculum in nutrition, physical education and physical activity to participating districts. The program was discontinued in 2013. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2012, the average teacher salary in Greater Johnstown School District was $61,434 a year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in Pennsylvania Students, December 4, 2014 In 2013The District employed 311 teachers with an average salary of $61,967 and a top salary of $149,485. Greater Johnstown School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, a teacher can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2009, Greater Johnstown School District reported employing 259 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $58,865 and a top salary of $128,960. The teacher's work day is 7.5 hours, with 185 days in the contract year (5 for inservice days). Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, 3 paid personal days (unused accrue as sick days), 10 paid sick days which accumulate, 3 paid bereavement leave days, sabbatical leave at 1/2 pay and full benefits and many other benefits. Building sale During the summer of 2015, the Greater Johnstown School Board sold the main administration building which is located on Broad Street to First Link of Pennsylvania LP. for $400,000. The administration will be moved into one of three school buildings that have ample room to accommodate the offices. Supporters note the sale returns the property to the tax rolls of the district the city and the county. Administrative spending Greater johnstown School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $569.05 per pupil.

Reserves In 2008, the Greater Johnstown School District reported a balance of $$11,858,778 in its unreserved- undesignated fund. The unreserved-designated fund balance was reported as zero. In 2010, Greater Johnstown School District Administration reported an increase to 15,298,128 in the unreserved-undesignated fund balance. Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In 2005, the total reserve funds held by Pennsylvania public school districts was $1.9 billion. By 2013, reserves held by Pennsylvania public school districts, as a whole, had increased to over $3.8 billion. Interest swap In November 2009, Auditor General Jack Wagner reported that Greater Johnstown School District entered into high risk Interest swap deals under Act 23 of 2003. By 2009, 107 Districts out of 500 Pennsylvania school districts entered into these transactions. Seven Berks County public school districts also entered into swap deals with investment banks. It was found that fees that were characterized as being paid by the investment banks were actually ultimately charged to the district. Tuition Students who live in the Greater Johnstown School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Greater Johnstown School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2013 tuition rates are Elementary School - $7,799, high school - $11,881 Greater Johnstown School District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax 1%, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, a Business Privilege Tax, two per capita taxes, an annual Emergency and Municipal Services Tax, and a Mercantile Tax; coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and roughly $5 million from the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the district. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. =State basic education funding= According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Greater Johnstown School District receives 30.5% of its annual revenue from the state. This exceeds the goal of the state providing 50% of district funding. For the 2014-15 school year, Greater Johnstown School District received $16,726,873 in State Basic Education funding. Additionally, the district received $266,353 in new Ready To Learn Block grant. The State's enacted Education Budget includes $5,526,129,000 for the 2014-2015 Basic Education Funding.

The State is paying $500.8 million to Social Security on the school employees behalf and another $1.16 billion to the state teachers pension system (PSERS). In total, Pennsylvania's Education budget for K-12 public schools is $10 billion. This was a $305 million increase over 2013-2014 state spending and the greatest amount ever allotted by the Commonwealth for its public schools.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2014-15 Enacted Education Budget Fast Facts, July 14, 2014 In the 2013-2014 school year, Greater Johnstown School District received a 1.6% increase or $16,731,025 in Pennsylvania Basic Education Funding.

This program has provided over $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher skills training; All Day Kindergarten; lower class size in Kindergarten through 3rd grade; literacy and math coaching programs (provides teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction); before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $714,670 in addition to all other state and federal funding.

Greater Johnstown School District received funding in 2007-08. The district received $268,600 enrolling 68 students for 2011-12. In addition to PreK Counts, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also supplements the federal Head Start preschool program with an additional funding on an annual basis. The program is available to low income children residing within the district through private providers. In 2013, Pennsylvania contributed $39,178,000 to Head Start. In 2010, Head Start received $37.6 million in Pennsylvania state education dollars. Since 2003, Pennsylvania has more than doubled the number of preschoolers in publicly funded pre-kindergarten through a multipronged system including: school-based pre-kindergarten, Pennsylvania Pre-K Counts through private providers, Early Intervention, Head Start and Head Start Supplemental, and the school district's use of Accountability Block Grants. Over 100,000 Pennsylvania preschoolers participate in state taxpayer funded pre-kindergarten programs. In 2013, the federal government spent $8 billion for preschool programs nationwide. In 2013, Pennsylvania was awarded a $51.7 million federal grant to fund early learning programs. The funding will be used to create 50 Early Childhood Education Community Innovation Zones in areas where the lowest-performing public schools, including charter schools, exist. The federal dollars were not be used to provide seats for children in preschools. Instead the money was used to build state bureaucracy and added training for teachers/providers. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use.

In 2005-06, the program received $66 million in funding and expanded to support tutoring in 175 school districts and Career and Technical Centers. Project 720 Project 720 was a high school reform program implemented for three years under the Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth's high schools. Teachers were expected to use data driven instructional practices and to meet the needs of diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High school's applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007-08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. Greater Johnson School District was one of 161 PA public school districts to apply, receiving $100,000 funding over three years.Robert Hayes Postupac, PROJECT 720: A CASE STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL REFORM, University of Pittsburgh, 2011 For 2010-11, Project 720 funding was decreased to $1.7 million by Governor Rendell.

Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Pennsylvania Senate Education Committee, the Governor and the Pennsylvania School Board Association, to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Greater Johnstown School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided several million dollars, in additional federal funding, to improve student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Race To The Top Webinar powerpoint for districts December 2009, December 9, 2009 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. School Improvement Grant In the summer of 2011, the district administration applied for a federal School Improvement Grant, (over $9.9 million available). The middle school was eligible for funding due to chronic, low achievement. The grant stipulates the funds be used for improving student achievement using one of four federally dictated strategies. The strategies are: transformation, turnaround, restart with new faculty and administration or closure of failing schools. The Pennsylvania Education Secretary awarded $66 million to reform Pennsylvania's lowest achieving schools in August 2011. The funding is for three years. Greater JOhnstown Middle School chose a Transformation Model. The district administration established a Planning Committee which interfaced with the Cambria County Child Development, a nonprofit corporation, to align after school and summer programs to support effective tutoring. The school leaders were required to use the Getting Results Continuous School Improvement Plan. These plans were annually reviewed and updated by the planning committee. The Appalachia Intermediate Unit 8 was charged with final review of the plan. As part of the transformation model reform, the principals and (2) assistant principals were to be replaced at the beginning of the 2012-13 school year.Greater Johnstown School District Administration, Funded 2011-12 SIG Greater Johnstown School District application, 2011 For the 2010-11 school year, Greater Johnstown School District administration did not apply for a School Improvement Grant. It was eligible for funding due to the chronic, low achievement at the schools. In 2010, Pennsylvania received $141 million from the US Department of Education, to turn around its worst-performing schools. The funds were disbursed via a competitive grant program. The Pennsylvania Department of Education identified 200 Pennsylvania schools as \\"persistently lowest achieving,\\" making them eligible for this special funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Improvement Grant Components_Stat_Requirements, 2010 Pennsylvania required low performing schools to apply or provide documentation about why they had not applied. The funds must be used, by the district, to turn around schools in one of four ways: school closure, restart - close the school and reopen it as a charter school. The other two options involve firing the principal. One would require at least half the faculty in a chronically poor performing school be dismissed. The second involves intensive teacher training coupled with strong curriculum revision or a longer school day. 21st Century learning grant In July 2003 and 2004, Greater Johnstown School District received a federal grant called 21st Century Learning grant, which is run by the PDE. The grant calls for the establishment and sustainability of community learning centers that provide additional educational services to students in high-poverty and low-performing schools. The grant was competitive. Applications for the grants were reviewed and scored by a panel of representatives from the educational field and professional grant writers. The school received $368,899. In 2010, the district received another $374,400. In 2011, the district received $312,00 and in 2012 it received another $312,000 in federal funding. While 101 entities applied for the funding, only 66 were approved including eight charter schools.

A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2013-14 - 46.8000 mills *2012-13 - 46.8000 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012-13, 2012 *2011-12 - 46.8000 mills. *2010-11 - 46.8000 mills *2009-10 - 46.8000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 - 46.8000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 46.8000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 46.8000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 46.8000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Cambria County residents amounts to about 2.4% of their yearly income.

Pennsylvania's 2011 tax burden of 10.35% ranked 10th highest out of 50 states. The tax burden was above the national average of 9.8%. Pennsylvania's taxpayers paid $4,374 per capita in state and local taxes, including school taxes.Tax Foundation, The facts on Pennsylvania‚Äôs Tax Climate, January 2015 Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above their annual Act 1 Index unless they either: allow Districts voters to approve the increase through a vote by referendum or they receive an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the school year is published by the PDE in the fall of each year. Each individual school district's Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as local property values and the personal income of district residents. Originally, Act 1 of 2006 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation eliminating six of the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The legislature also froze the payroll amount public school districts use to calculate the pension-plan exception at the 2012 payroll levels. Further increases in payroll cannot be used to raise the district's exception for pension payments. A specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

Property tax relief In 2013, Greater Johnstown School District approved 6,351 homestead properties received $215 each. The increase in amount was related to fewer residents applying for tax relief. The amount received by the district must be divided equally among all approved residences. In 2009, Greater Johnstown School District approved 6,429 homestead properties to receive $212 in property tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The amount of property tax relief each Pennsylvania public school district receives is announced by the PDE in May of each year. The amount of tax relief is dependent on the total tax revenue collected on the casino slots in the previous year. Thirty five percent of the slots tax revenues are used for property tax relief. In Cambria County, the highest tax relief went to Ferndale Area School District which was set at $214.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead, May 1, 2009. The highest property tax relief provided, among Pennsylvania school districts, goes to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District in Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. Chester- Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report, May 1, 2009 The tax relief was started by Governor Edward G. Rendell with passage of the state gaming law in 2004. Rendell promised taxpayers substantial property tax relief from legalized gambling. In Cambria County, only 54.3% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. This was among the lowest participation rates in Pennsylvania. Some Greater Johnstown School District residents, including: low income residents aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older, can qualify for the state's Property Tax/Rent Rebate program. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. Residents must apply annually to receive up to $650. The Property tax/rent rebate program is funded by revenues from the Pennsylvania Lottery. In 2012, these property tax rebates were increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.Pennsylvania Department of Revenue., Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program, June 2012 Extracurriculars Great Johnstown School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, publicly funded sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). The district is part of the Laurel Highlands Athletic League and PIAA District 6. The district reported spending $928,978.47 on student activities in 2014-15 school year. The district is noncompliant with state law, due to failing to post its annual Interscholastic Athletic Opportunities Disclosure Form on its website. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the school district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities must have criminal background checks.

The protein name derives from the protein's interaction with carbohydrate response element sequences of DNA.  Function  This gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor of the Myc / Max / Mad superfamily. This protein forms a heterodimeric complex and binds and activates, in a glucose-dependent manner, carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) motifs in the promoters of triglyceride synthesis genes. ChREBP is activated by glucose, independent of insulin. In adipose tissue, ChREBP induces de novo lipogenesis from glucose in response to a glucose flux into adipocytes. In the liver, glucose induction of ChREBP promotes glycolysis and lipogenesis.  Clinical significance  This gene is deleted in Williams- Beuren syndrome, a multisystem developmental disorder caused by the deletion of contiguous genes at chromosome 7q11.23. Excess expression of ChREBP in the liver due to metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes can lead to steatosis in the liver. In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, about 25% of total liver lipids result from de novo synthesis (synthesis of lipids from glucose). High blood glucose and insulin enhance lipogenesis in the liver by activation of ChREBP and SREBP-1c, respectively. Chronically elevated blood glucose can activate ChREBP in the pancreas can lead to excessive lipid synthesis in beta cells, increasing lipid accumulation in those cells, leading to lipotoxicity, beta-cell apoptosis, and type 2 diabetes.  Interactions  MLXIPL has been shown to interact with MLX.  Role in glycolysis  ChREBP is translocated to the nucleus and binds to DNA after dephosphorylation of a p-Ser and a p-Thr residue by PP2A, which itself is activated by Xylulose-5-phosphate. Xu5p is produced in the pentose phosphate pathway when levels of Glucose-6-phosphate are high (the cell has ample glucose). In the liver, ChREBP mediates activation of several regulatory enzymes of glycolysis and lipogenesis including L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK), acetyl CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase.

Regulation  Insulin activates the human INSIG2 promoter in a process mediated by phosphorylated SAP1a. Akt mediates suppression of Insig2a, a liver-specific transcript encoding the SREBP1c inhibitor INSIG2. MCHR2 has been observed to significantly decrease INSIG2. Insig2 is upregulated under hypoxic conditions and is associated with the malignant potential of pancreatic cancer. A novel 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] response element in the promoter region of Insig-2 gene was identified which specifically binds to the heterodimer of retinoid X receptor and vitamin D receptor (VDR) and directs VDR-mediated transcriptional activation in a 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent manner. 1,25-(OH)2D3 transiently but strongly induces Insig-2 expression in 3T3-L1 cells. This novel regulatory circuit may also play important roles in other lipogenic cell types that express VDR.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is highly similar to the protein product encoded by gene INSIG1. Both INSIG1 protein and this protein are endoplasmic reticulum proteins that block the processing of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) by binding to SREBP cleavage- activating protein (SCAP), and thus prevent SCAP from escorting SREBPs to the Golgi.  Clinical Significance  Insig deficiency in mice caused a marked buildup of cholesterol precursors in skin associated with a marked increase in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase protein and hair and skin defects corrected by topical simvastatin, an inhibitor of reductase. REV- ERBalpha participates in the circadian modulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity, and thereby in the daily expression of SREBP target genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. This control is exerted via the cyclic transcription of Insig2, encoding a trans- membrane protein that sequesters SREBP proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and thereby interferes with the proteolytic activation of SREBPs in Golgi membranes. REV-ERBalpha also participates in the cyclic expression of cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in converting cholesterol to bile acids. Findings suggest that this control acts via the stimulation of LXR nuclear receptors by cyclically produced oxysterols such that rhythmic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism is not just driven by alternating feeding-fasting cycles, but also by REV-ERBalpha, a component of the circadian clockwork circuitry. Silibinin inhibits adipocyte differentiation through a potential up-regulation of insig-1 and insig-2 at an early phase in adipocyte differentiation. The triacylglycerol reducing effect of fibrates and thiazolidinediones, strong and selective agonists of PPARalpha and PPARgamma, is partially caused by inhibition of SREBP-1 activation via up- regulation of Insig. Findings suggest that Insig2 is a novel colon cancer biomarker. Over-expression of Insig2 appeared to suppress chemotherapeutic drug treatment-induced Bcl2 associated X protein (Bax) expression and activation. Insig2 was also found to localize to the mitochondria/heavy membrane fraction and associate with conformationally changed Bax. Moreover, Insig2 altered the expression of several additional apoptosis genes located in mitochondria. In a study by Kumar et al., the common polymorphisms in INSIG2 gene was not found to be significant in Indian population.

The Prince Tudor theory (also known as Tudor Rose theory) is a variant of the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, which asserts that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, was the true author of the works published under the name of William Shakespeare. The Prince Tudor variant holds that Oxford and Queen Elizabeth I were lovers and had a child who was raised as Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. The theory followed earlier arguments that Francis Bacon was a son of the queen. A later version of the theory, known as \\"Prince Tudor II\\" states that Oxford was himself a son of the queen, and thus the father of his own half-brother. This hidden history is supposed to explain why Oxford dedicated the narrative poems Venus and Adonis (1593) and The Rape of Lucrece (1594) to Southampton and to explain aspects of the poems' contents. The content of Shakespeare's sonnets has also been used to support the theory, as, to a lesser extent, have episodes in the plays. The Prince Tudor theory has created a division among Oxfordians. Many orthodox Oxfordians regard the theory as an impediment to Oxford's recognition as Shakespeare, whereas the Prince Tudor theorists maintain that their theory better explains Oxford's life and the reasons for his writing under a pen name.Helen Gordon, The Secret Love Story in Shakespeare's Sonnets, second edition.

The theory that the author of Shakespeare's works was connected to a secret romance and child of the queen dates back to the writings of Orville Ward Owen and Elizabeth Wells Gallup, who believed that Francis Bacon was the true author of the plays. In his book Sir Francis Bacon's Cipher Story (1893‚Äì5), Owen claimed to have discovered a secret history of the Elizabethan era hidden in cipher- form in Bacon/Shakespeare's works. According to Owen, Bacon revealed that Elizabeth was secretly married to Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who fathered both Bacon himself and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, the latter ruthlessly executed by his own mother in 1601.Helen Hackett, Shakespeare and Elizabeth: the meeting of two myths, Princeton University Press, 2009, pp. 157‚Äì60 Bacon was the true heir to the throne of England, but had been excluded from his rightful place. This tragic life-story was the secret hidden in the plays. Elizabeth Gallup developed Owen's views, arguing that a bi-literal cipher, which she had identified in the First Folio of Shakespeare's works, revealed concealed messages confirming that Bacon was the queen's son. This argument was taken up by several other writers, notably C.Y.C. Dawbarn in Uncrowned (1913) and Alfred Dodd The Personal Poems of Francis Bacon (1931).Michael Dobson & Nicola J. Watson, England's Elizabeth: An Afterlife in Fame and Fantasy, Oxford University Press, New York, 2004, p. 136. In Dodd's account Bacon was a national redeemer, who, deprived of his ordained public role as monarch, instead performed a spiritual transformation of the nation in private through his work. As he later wrote, \\"He was born for England, to set the land he loved on new lines, 'to be a Servant to Posterity'\\".Alfred Dodd, Francis Bacon's Personal Life Story, London: Rider, 1950, preface. J. Thomas Looney founded Oxfordian theory in his book Shakespeare Identified (1920). Looney did not include any arguments about secret marriages or hidden children. However, his theory soon gained adherents who adapted the earlier Baconian arguments to the new Oxfordian position. Looney expressed his disapproval of the development in a letter from 1933, which states that his followers Percy Allen and Bernard M. Ward were \\"advancing certain views respecting Oxford and Queen Eliz. which appear to me extravagant & improbable, in no way strengthen Oxford‚Äôs Shakespeare claims, and are likely to bring the whole cause into ridicule.\\"Christopher Paul, \\"A new letter by J.

He published his initial views on Oxford and Shakespeare in 1932,Allen, Percy, The Life Story of Edward De Vere as \\"William Shakespeare\\", London: Cecil Palmer, 1932. The suggestion that the queen had a son by Oxford appears in an appendix. The child is not identified. but did not develop his full theory until 1934 in his book Anne Cecil, Elizabeth & Oxford. In this he argues that Elizabeth and Oxford had an illegitimate child, who was given the name William Hughes, and who became an actor under the stage-name \\"William Shakespeare\\". He adopted the name because his father, Oxford, was already using it as a pen-name for his plays. Oxford had borrowed the name from a third Shakespeare, the man of that name from Stratford-upon-Avon, who was a law student at the time, but who was never an actor or a writer. As an illegitimate child, Hughes/Shakespeare had a \\"bar sinister\\" and could never have inherited the crown, but was \\"a glorious future for England that remained unrealised\\", as Helen Hackett puts it. Had he been able to claim the crown, the boy would have founded a line of kings that would have excluded the Stuarts, and thus protected England from the disasters brought about by that dynasty. The story of events is contained in the sonnets, which were written by Oxford to his actor son, who is the Fair Youth. The queen is the Dark Lady.Percy Allen, Anne Cecil, Elizabeth & Oxford: A Study of Relations between these three, with the Duke of Alencon added; based mainly upon internal evidence, drawn from (Chapman's?) A Lover's Complaint; Lord Oxford's (and others) A Hundreth Sundrie Flowers; Spenser's Faery Queen..., Archer, 1934. Allen's theory was not well received by many Oxfordians, including Sigmund Freud, a supporter of Looney, who wrote to Allen to express his disapproval. Oxfordian Louis P. B√©n√©zet did pursue a modified version in 1937, but only accepted that the sonnets were written to an actor son of the Earl's, not that the boy was a child of the queen.Samuel Schoenbaum, \\"Looney and the Oxfordians\\" in Russ McDonald, Shakespeare: an anthology of criticism and theory, 1945‚Äì2000, Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, p. 8. Allen's theory was later altered to the more acceptable view that the Earl of Southampton, Henry Wriothesley, was the hidden child, not Hughes/Shakespeare. Allen later claimed to have contacted the spirits of Shakespeare, Oxford, Bacon and Elizabeth through a medium, Hester Dowden. Apparently, the spirits confirmed this theory, adding that Oxford was the leader of a collaborative effort among poets and scholars to create the works. It was also revealed that Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream was a portrait of Oxford's and Elizabeth's brilliant son.Shapiro, James (2010), Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare?, UK edition: Faber and Faber (US edition: Simon & Schuster), pp. 196‚Äì210.Helen Sword, \\"Modernist Hauntology: James Joyce, Hester Dowden, and Shakespeare's Ghost\\", Texas Studies in Literature and Language, vol 41. Issue: 2., 1999, p. 196. Alfred Dodd had previously consulted the same medium, who had confirmed Dodd's theories about Francis Bacon, but the spirit of Bacon now told Allen that Dowden had been innocently misled by another spirit on that occasion.Dowden was the daughter of Shakespeare scholar Edward Dowden. Dodd had published his discoveries via Dowden in The Immortal Master, London, Rider & Co., 1943. Dowden's biographer reveals that Allen's was the final and true revelation. Indeed, from his teenage years Allen had been destined to be the bearer of the ultimate truth: \\"a plan had been worked out by spirit people interested in his earthly life that he should be the means of finally unravelling the great mystery of Shakespeare's origin and work.\\" Edmund Bentley, Far Horizon: A Biography of Hester Dowden: Medium and Psychic Investigator, London: Rider Company, 1951, pp. 147‚Äì50. For a more recent discussion of Dowden see Helen Sword, Ghostwriting Modernism, Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY., 2002. These events forced Allen to stand down as president of the Oxfordian organisation the Shakespeare Fellowship. Allen published his discoveries in 1947 under the title Talks with Elizabethans. He stated that the son of Oxford and Elizabeth was born in 1575. Lady Southampton had also given birth to \\"an illegitimate child\\" while her husband was imprisoned. The queen \\"arranged for her own son to be substituted for Lady Southampton's baby, and to be brought up as the legitimate third Earl of Southampton\\". In this version of events, Shakespeare of Stratford was reinstated as an actor and even as a writer. He helped Oxford and the others to write the plays, generally adding comic material. Indeed, he and Oxford were close friends. =Later writers= The theory was developed further by Dorothy and Charlton Ogburn in their biography of Edward De Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, This Star of England (1952). They also adopted the view that Southampton was the child of the queen and Oxford.They assert that they discovered the truth independently, \\"we had arrived at the conclusion that Southampton was the son of Oxford and the Queen almost a year before we heard that anyone else had entertained the suspicion.\\", This Star of England, p. 297. They cited evidence from Shakespeare's plays and poetry that Oxford had drawn from his own life experiences to create the characters and events in the works attributed to \\"William Shakespeare.\\" After his concealed birth Southampton was raised by parental surrogates. They asserted that the narrative poem Venus and Adonis, dedicated to Southampton, described the circumstances of his conception in the affair between Oxford (Adonis) and the queen (Venus). Southampton was also the \\"Fair Youth\\" of the sonnets and that the first 17 sonnets (often called the \\"procreation sonnets\\") were written by Oxford to his natural son, urging him to marry and produce an heir.Dorothy and Charlton Ogburn, This Star of England. New York: Coward-McCann, 1952 Like Allen before them, the Ogburns rejected the supposition that the poet and the Fair Youth were homosexual lovers, stressing instead the fatherly tone of the sonnets addressing the Fair Youth. The Prince Tudor theory was further expanded by Elisabeth Sears' Shakespeare and the Tudor Rose (2002),Sears, Elisabeth. Shakespeare and the Tudor Rose, Meadow Geese Press, Marshfield Hills, 2002 Hank Whittemore's The Monument (2005),Whittemore, Hank. The Monument, Meadow Geese Press, Marshfield Hills MA, 2005 and Helen Heightsman Gordon's The Secret Love Story in Shakespeare's Sonnets (2008). Sears explores how Elizabeth might have concealed one or more pregnancies, but decided to remain unmarried for political reasons. Whittemore believes the sonnets emphasize the royal blood of Henry Wriothesley, who was convicted of treason for participation in the Essex Rebellion of 1601, but who otherwise might have been named as successor to his mother, Queen Elizabeth I.Whittemore, The Monument Gordon emphasizes the love story between Elizabeth Tudor and Edward De Vere, citing an alleged historical reference to their love affair in 1572‚Äì73.Neville Williams, Life & Times of Elizabeth I, New York: Abbeyville, 1992, p. 111 Gordon believes that the mysterious dedication to the sonnets published in 1609 has encrypted the names of the love child and his parents, their three mottos, and a clue as to the probable date of conception, \\"Twelfth Night\\" of 1573.Gordon, Helen H. The Secret Love Story in Shakespeare's Sonnets, second edition. Philadelphia: Xlibris Publishing Co., 2008. Chapter 2 and Appendix A The term \\"Prince Tudor\\" was also used by Baconians who continued to follow the ideas of Owen and Gallup. In 1973 Margaret Barsi- Greene published I, Prince Tudor, wrote Shakespeare: an autobiography from his two ciphers in poetry and prose. This purported to be an autobiography written by Bacon hidden within his other writings.Margaret Barsi-Greene, I, Prince Tudor, wrote Shakespeare: an autobiography from his two ciphers in poetry and prose, Branden Books, 1973 In 1992 the playwright Paula Fitzgerald adapted the book for the theatre.I, Prince Tudor Wrote Shakespeare, British Film and Video Council, moving image and sound, knowledge and access In 2006 Virginia M. Fellows, an admirer of Owen who had rediscovered his deciphering machine, published The Shakespeare Code promoting Owen's views. In the following year, another variation on the theory was created by Robert Nield in Breaking the Shakespeare Codes (2007). He adapted elements of Allen's \\"William Hughes\\" theory and Owen's model, arguing that anagrams in the sonnets and other works actually point to a \\"William Hastings\\", who was the real Shakespeare and also the illegitimate child of Elizabeth and Leicester.Alberge, Dalya, \\"Double, double, Shakespeare oil in trouble\\", The Times, London, 25 October 2007 Prince Tudor Part II A variation of the Oxfordian form of the theory, known as Prince Tudor Theory Part II, advances the belief that Oxford was the son of Queen Elizabeth I, born in July 1548 at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.Streitz, Paul \\"Oxford: Son of Queen Elizabeth I,\\" 2001 This theory asserts that Princess Elizabeth, then fourteen years old, had a child by her stepuncle and stepmother's fourth husband, Thomas Seymour, and that the child of this affair was secretly placed in the home of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, and raised as Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Oxford: Son of Queen Elizabeth I (2001) by Paul Streitz is the primary work advancing Prince Tudor Theory Part II. In addition to making Oxford the queen's son by Seymour, the book also revives the notion that the \\"Virgin Queen\\" had children by the Earl of Leicester. These were Elizabeth Leighton, Francis Bacon, Mary Sidney, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Finally, she bore Henry Wriothesley, who was the result of an incestuous relationship between Oxford and his mother, the Queen. This aspect of the Prince Tudor Part II theory is not widely accepted among Oxfordians; most believe that the established date of birth for Oxford (April 12, 1550) is accurate. Thus Elizabeth (born September 7, 1533) would have been 17 years older than Oxford. Streitz also asserts that Oxford did not die in 1604, but was abducted. The book claims that Oxford was banished to the island Mersea in the English Channel, where he completed Shake-speares Sonnets and The Tempest. He was also the \\"hidden genius\\" behind the King James Bible (published in 1611), the unified style of which indicates that it was written by \\"one clear hand\\", though much was retained from earlier translations.Streitz, pp. 185‚Äì89 He died at the end of 1608. This projected date of death is based on the claim that the first written statement referring to Oxford as deceased was in January 1609, followed by the publication of the sonnets ascribed to the \\"ever-living\\" poet. Streitz follows the common Oxfordian argument that \\"ever- living\\" is a euphemism for \\"deceased\\".Streitz, Paul \\"Oxford: Son of Queen Elizabeth I,\\" 2001, pp. 129‚Äì30 Further arguments for Prince Tudor II are made in Shakespeare's Lost Kingdom (2010) by Charles Beauclerk, Earl of Burford, a descendant of Edward de Vere. Beauclerk follows Streitz in claiming that Oxford lived on after 1604, but does not state that he was abducted and exiled. He suggests that he went into hiding with the help of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby. =Dramatisation= The Prince Tudor II scenario also constitutes the main plot of the feature film Anonymous (2011), written by John Orloff.\\"Anonymous: So Shakespeare Was a Fraud? Really?\\", Time, October 26, 2011. The film dramatizes events leading to the Essex Rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. Against this background, flashbacks identify earlier episodes in De Vere's life. His literary genius is revealed in plays written for performance at court, but seeing the power of popular theatre he decides to write for the public stage using a frontman, William Shakespeare. A lover of the queen, de Vere fathers Southampton, who later becomes an ally of Essex. The latter's \\"rebellion\\" is portrayed as an attempt to overthrow Oxford's longtime enemy the hunchbacked Robert Cecil, not an attack on the Queen. Oxford hopes to support Essex by using his play Richard III to whip up anti- Cecil feeling. He is outmanoeuvred when Cecil discovers his plans. Cecil then tells Oxford that the earl himself is a son of the queen. Essex and Southampton are arrested and condemned. Devastated, Oxford agrees to Elizabeth's demand that he remain anonymous as part of a bargain for saving their son from execution as a traitor. In the DVD commentary on the film, Orloff says that he was unhappy with the scene in which Cecil asserts that Oxford is the queen's son. He had asked the director Roland Emmerich to remove it, but Emmerich insisted on retaining it.Roland Emmerich et al, Anonymous DVD, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, 2012.

It won the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 1956. Writing in 1998, Gardner Dozois described \\"Exploration Team\\" as \\"taut, suspenseful and scary\\". He went on to note that it is \\"practically the model of how to write an intricate and intelligent adventure set on an alien world\\". \\"Exploration Team\\" is one of the works in Leinster's \\"Colonial Survey\\" series. It is also one of the four novelettes that were re-written and included in Leinster's fix-up novel Colonial Survey, where it appears as a chapter titled \\"Combat Team\\". Plot summary The novelette is set in a future time during which humanity has begun colonizing planets in other solar systems. The Colonial Survey agency has decreed the (fictional) planet of Loren Two to be off-limits, due to the extremely dangerous native animals. Despite its decree, the Colonial Survey has authorized an experimental colony on the planet. At about the same time, the overcrowded inhabitants of another planet have established an unauthorized reconnaissance station on Loren Two. Neither group is aware of the other's existence. The authorized colony is well-funded, consisting of one dozen persons equipped with advanced robotic and other equipment. The unauthorized reconnaissance team consists of a single man, Huyghens (no first name given), accompanied by an eagle and four specially-bred Kodiak bears. The bears have been bred (the story uses the term \\"mutated\\") so as to have the psychological profile of dogs. They are friendly to humans and able to work in teams. When the story begins, Huyghens receives a signal indicating that a ship is about to land near his station. The ship drops off its sole passenger, an officer with the Colonial Survey named Roane (no first name given), and then departs. Roane soon learns that Huyghens is an illegal trespasser on the planet and that his (Huyghens') signal beacon was not that of the authorized colony. For his part, Huyghens is surprised to learn that there was an authorized colony on the same planet. The two men put their minds to the question of why the authorized colony's signal beacon was not working and soon determine that it has been replaced with a low-technology emergency beacon. From this, the two men surmise that the authorized colony has been overrun by the indigenous predators, but that some colonists might still be alive in the mine tunnels that the colony was expected to have dug. Huyghens and Roane, along with the bears and the eagle, undertake a dangerous cross-country trek to determine the status of the authorized colony. Publication history Other than its original publication in the March 1956 issue of Astounding Science Fiction, \\"Exploration Team\\" did not see any other magazine publication until the May 1962 issue (No. 43) of the French-language magazine Satellite, as \\"Les meilleurs amis de l'homme\\" (\\"Man's Best Friends\\"). The story has been anthologized at least ten times, including thrice in Italian translation (one under the title \\"Colonia vietata\\" (\\"Illegal Colony\\")) and once in German. The story also appears in two collections devoted to Leinster's work‚ÄîFirst Contacts (NESFA Press, 1998) and an Italian-language collection, the summer 1985 issue of Millemondi, as well as Volume 1 of The Hugo Winners series. The foregoing was taken from the story's listing in the Internet Speculative Fiction Database (for which see the External Links section below). More detail on its publication history can be found at that listing. Reception Floyd C. Gale said in 1963 that the story was the best in The Hugo Winners Volume 1, praising Leinster for being able to adapt to changes in science fiction during a career of several decades.

It won the 1966 Nebula Award for Best Novella and the 1967 Hugo Award for Best Novelette. It is about a future civilization of wealthy nobles who live in high-tech castles, which are maintained by an enslaved alien race, the Meks. After centuries of slavery, the Meks revolt, destroying the castles and slaughtering their elite inhabitants, until only one castle is left.  Plot summary  In the far future, a small elite group of humans have returned from Altair (over 16 light years away) to Earth, their mother planet, to live in nine elaborate, high-tech castles as idle aristocrats. They are primarily concerned with theoretical discussions of aesthetics, past times and questions of honor and etiquette. Their time is spent drinking fine wines, socializing at formal dinners, and striving to rise in their political standing. Various enslaved alien races provide technicians (\\"Meks\\"), transportation (\\"birds\\", \\"power wagons\\"), household service (\\"Peasants\\"), and amusement (\\"Phanes\\"). Only a small minority of humans live a free life outside of the castles, and are considered barbaric by the castle inhabitants because they perform manual labor to serve their own needs. After seven centuries during which the noble humans develop an increasingly refined society, the Meks revolt. The inhabitants of some castles without defenses are immediately killed, while the inhabitants of the best defended castles consider the revolt only a nuisance. Complacently the humans consider their high-tech castles unchallengeable. To take action themselves rather than only planning and commanding is seen as a vulgar loss of dignity. Gentlemen in this society only do intellectual activity; all technical work or labour is seen as beneath them. However, without the Meks, the technology of the castles cannot be maintained. Furthermore, the Meks use their inside knowledge of the operation of the castles to successfully besiege the remaining castles until only Castle Hagedorn is left. While most castle citizens value their traditions and social customs and standing higher than their own survival, one gentleman however, Xanten, takes it upon himself to research the situation and search for allies outside of the castle. He eventually accepts that he can learn from the \\"barbaric\\" free-living outsiders and tribes. After a short and hard battle, the Meks take over Castle Hagedorn. Xanten and his allies win by destroying the Meks' food supply, which starves the Meks after several months. When the Meks call for terms, Xanten concludes that humanity cannot go on depending on slave labor, so they send the surviving Meks back to their native planet, Etamin 9 and resolve to live off the land and produce their needs by their own labor in the future. Castle Hagedorn becomes a museum to the past ways of life. Characters=Humans=Named * Xanten: a 35-year-old clan chief with a tall build. He is criticized for a lack of punctilio. His consort is Araminta, but he cannot have a child with her, as there is a one child-per couple policy (she has a child from a previous partner). He detests O.Z. Garr. He has an amorous encounter with Glys Meadowsweet. * Claghorn: A late middle- aged gentleman with a strong build, greying hair and green eyes. His academic specialty is studying the Meks. After the Mek revolt starts, he leaves Castle Hagedorn to live in the Expiationist village. * O.Z. Garr: An elegant-looking traditionalist gentleman notable for his knowledge of military theory and for commanding Meks in a successful battle against the Nomads. As a traditionalist, he wishes to continue the old ways of the castle elites. * Philidor: A former noble who became an Expiationist and moved to a village. A man of learning, he was called A.G. Philidor as a gentleman, but in exile, he prefers simply the informal name \\"Philidor\\". * Glys Meadowsweet: A beautiful young woman who lives in the Expiationist village. She is likely the child of a noble couple who could not keep her due to the one child policy. Categories * Expiationists: Nobles and elites from the castles exiled for their controversial views or political discontent. They include former high-ranking nobles, scholars, low-ranked people and children who could not be kept due to the one child policy. Expiationists feel guilty for the Altarians' original sin of enslaving alien races. They live in humble villages, where they toil with their hands. * Nomads: Tall and lean semi-barbaric original Earth dwellers who were present when the elites of Altair arrived 700 years ago. The nomads live on the plains in encampments. The Nomads consider the Altairian humans and their alien slaves to be equally strange. =Aliens= * Meks: Men-like creatures from the planet Etamin Nine with brown, rust- coloured, thick and waxy-looking skin. Spines coming out of their necks and scalps are coated with a conductive copper-chrome metal on the skin surface. Their faces were corrugated muscle with a vertical maw at the bottom. Their brain functions as a radio transceiver to other Meks. They wear no clothes except a work apron or tool belt. In their native planet, they ate the decaying vegetation in the swamp mud, but on Earth they consume a syrup made by humans, and so their original digestive organs, for consuming mud, have atrophied. Their brains have metal oxide-covered silica cells that retain data forever. They do not generally display emotions or personality. * Peasants: small andromorphs from Spica Ten of limited intellectual capabilities. They work as servants in the castles. * Power-wagons: Rectangular swamp creatures from Etamin Nine that have a mixture of biological components (muscle, digestive organs, brain, protective pelt) and mechanical elements (wheels, rotors, wires, a lever). They are powerful and docile. * Birds: garish, multicoloured flying creatures with long necks, they live in the cotes of the castle. They can speak, but much of what they say is jeering and insolent. They are hard to discipline. * Phanes: Docile, beautiful and playful female creatures from Albireo Seven's moon, they are exhibited by noble Phane-owners for their lovely gauze that grows from their pores. They are selectively bred for their beautiful features. While enthusiasm for showing or commenting on phanes is an approved pastime, gentleman who fall in love with Phanes are mocked. Human-Phane sexual contact causes Phanes to lose their beauty. Phanes live for twenty years; in the last ten years of a Phanes' life, she loses her beauty, and switches to a domestic servant role. Setting On Earth, there are nine complex castles for the elite from Altair. Castle Hagedorn has a mile-long, 300-foot high wall. Inside there are 28 noble families which had a five-century lineage on Earth. Underneath the nobles' houses are storerooms, warehouses, workshops, living quarters for Meks, and facilities for baking, brewing, and other related functions. Reception When reviewing Nebula Award Stories Two, Algis Budrys called the novella excellent. In Lawrence Person's 2003 review, he notes that the aristocrats' \\"...society has rendered them incapable of rational interaction with other [alien] races\\". Persons states that the protagonist Xanten is \\"Robert A. Heinlein's classic\\" character from \\"Man Who Learned Better\\". He says \\"Vance's work has a depth, richness and sophistication that can be enjoyed long after you know how the story ends.\\"  Awards  The Last Castle won the Nebula Award for Best Novella for 1966 and the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 1967. It was the first Nebula Award and second Hugo Award and for the author.

The Silva Carbonaria was a vast forest that stretched from the rivers Zenne and the Dijle in the north to the Sambre in the south.F. L. Ganshof, \\"Manorial Organization in the Low Countries in the Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Centuries\\" Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 4th Series 31 (1949:29-59) p. 30. Its northern outliers reached the then marshy site of modern Brussels.Andr√© De Vries, Brussels: A Cultural and Literary History, 2003:18. Further to the southeast, the higher elevation and deep river valleys were covered by the even less penetrable ancient Arduenna Silva, the deeply folded Ardennes, which are still partly forested to this day. To the east, the forest was possibly considered to extend to the Rhine. It was there in Cologne in 388 CE that the magistri militum praesentalis Nannienus and QuintinusA. H. M. Jones, John Robert Martindale, J. Morris, eds. The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, 1971 s.v. Quintinus\\" began a counter-attack against a Frankish incursion from across the Rhine, which was fought in the Silva Carbonaria.According to Sulpicius Alexander, quoted in Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks ii.9: multos Francorum, qui Rhenum transierant, a Romanis apud Carbonariam ferr√¥ peremptos tradit, quoted by Hoffmann 1698. Roman road The green diamonds show places named as having been in the Silva Carbonaria in medieval records. The Roman road between Bavay and Tongeren is shown in brown. A great Roman road forming a \\"strategic axis\\"Van Durme 2002:11. linked the Rhine crossing at Cologne with Maastricht, where it crossed the Maas at the head of navigation. Skirting the northern edges of the Silva Carbonaria, it passed through Tongeren, Kortrijk and Cambrai to reach the sea at Boulogne. The highway was the main east‚Äìwest route in a landscape where the river valleys, tributaries of the Meuse and the Scheldt, tended southwest to northeast. It remained viable through the Early Middle Ages as the chauss√©e Brunehaut, the \\"Road of Brunehaut\\". As a public work its scale had become unimaginable in the Middle Ages: the chronicler Jean d'Outremeuse solemnly related in 1398 that Brunehaut, wife of Sigebert I, had built this wide paved road in 526, and that it was completed in a single night with the devil's aid.The confused legendary origins of the chaus√©e Brunehaut were unraveled and examined by J. Lestoquoy, \\"L'√©trange histoire de la Chauss√©e Brunehaut\\", in Arras au temps jadis1946; see \\"Presentation of Brunehaut and its villages\\". Use as a border There are signs that the Silva Carbonaria represented the boundary between the Roman provinces of Gallia Belgica and Germania Inferior. In the Middle Ages, these provinces were still represented by the church dioceses of Reims and Cologne. On a smaller level, the forest served as a boundary between the Roman civitates of the Tungri (to the east) and the Nervii (to the west), and that this boundary continued to be used in the Middle ages, as the boundary between the bishoprics of Li√®ge and Cambrai.Ulrich Nonn, Pagus und Comitatus, pp.226-234 and map. With the collapse of central Roman administration in the fourth century, Germanic Franks living along the Rhine border established kingdoms within the empire, and settled in less populated areas. The Salian Franks expanded their settlements from a starting point near Nijmegen until they pressed into the more populated and Romanized areas in the Silva Carbonaria and near the Maas. The Romanized population came to be known as *walh≈çz or \\"strangers\\" to the Germanic Franks‚Äîcontinued speaking a Late Latin, whose name survives in Walloon. In the past the Romance-Germanic linguistic division that marks Belgium to this day has been perhaps too facilely linked√âmile Cammaerts, A History of Belgium from the Roman Invasion to the Present Day, 1921: 34, in general following conclusions based on toponymy by the historian Godefroid Kurth. to these geographic parameters.The historiography of this idea is traced by Luc van Durme in \\"Genesis and evolution of the Romance-Germanic language border in Europe\\", in Jeanine Treffers-Daller and Roland Willemyns, eds. Language Contact at the Romance-Germanic Language Border, 2002:39ff. In the 19th century, the iron ore in the formerly wooded valleys fuelled the sillon industriel of Wallonia For a time in the sixth century, the Silva Carbonaria formed a barrier between the West Frankish kingdom of Clovis and the East Frankish kingdom of Sigebert the Lame, centred on Cologne, until he was defeated some time after 507, and Clovis joined the two kingdoms. \\"At that stage, the silva Carbonaria separated Clovis's Salian kingdom from Sigebert's eastern domain.\\" (The Cambridge Ancient History, eo.loc.); \\"The Silva Carbonaria formed for a time a natural barrier between Salians and Ripuarians, though it may not have proved very effective,\\" (John Michael Wallace-Hadrill, The Barbarian West, 400-1000 1996:70); in the chronicle of the Monastery of Saint Arnulf, under the year 690: adunat√¥ exercitu Peppinus ad Carbonariam silvam pervenit: qui terminus utraque Regna dividit. Throughout the rule of the Merovingian dynasty, founded by Clovis, the Silva Carbonaria thus became the boundary between their two kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria. The Silva Carbonaria is mentioned in the Salic Law of the Franks,Title 47 of Lex Salica specifies that the interested parties in a contested ownership meet within forty days if they live within the bounds of the Silva Carbonaria and the Loire; otherwise eighty days must be allowed. (T.M. Charles-Edwards, in Iorwerth Eiddon and Stephen Edwards, eds. The Cambridge Ancient History, vol. XV [Cambridge University Press] 2005:273. where it marked \\"the boundary of the territories occupied by the Frankish people\\". As Gregory of Tours noted, Rhenum transierunt, pluribus suorum in Romano relictis solo, ad repetendam depopulationem paratis, cum quibus congressua Romanis adcomodus fuit, multis Francorum apud Carbonariam ferro perimptis. (Historia Francorum ii.9.). Medieval monasteries Extensive tracts of the untamed woodlands belonged to monasteries. The Benedictine Abbey of Lobbes lay in the Silva Carbonaria and that of Saint Foillan, in the Sonian Forest (For√™t de Soignes/Zoni√´nwoud) not far from Nivelles.Hoffmann 1698, Laubiense Monasterium in Silva Carbonaria esse situm, auctore Fulcuin√¥; esse et Coenobium S.

Even before the Romans arrived, iron weapons forged in the Silva Carbonaria were traded by the Belgae to their cousins in the southeast of Britain. In the High Middle Ages further woodlands were cleared. Today the most significant remnantThere are seven other forests in Belgium that are also remains of the Silva Carbonaria of the Silva Carbonaria is the Sonian Forest,De Vries 2003:13; Hofmann, in the late seventeenth century, noted this remnant in writings of Gotefridus Wendelinus and also remarked on remnants in the For√™t de Mormaux or Mormal, the Bois de Cirau, and the woodland called Die Leu that stretched from Leuven to the gates of Diest, the forest-covered Hageland or Hagelanden. preserved because it had been set aside as a noble hunt. At the start of the nineteenth century the area of this remnant of the primeval forest still covered about 100 square kilometres, but due to timber cutting its area has diminished to its current protected area of 44.21 km¬≤.

While the process of fermentation in large barrels formerly took several weeks, gherkins today are ready for sale after only one day of processing‚Äîwhether for mustard gherkins (Senfgurke), gherkins or dill pickles (Gew√ºrzgurke) or pickled cucumbers (Salzgurke). This enormous time saving is achieved by heating to with the addition of caustic soda. The composition of the additional ingredients, however, still remains a well-guarded secret of the approximately twenty picklers. These taste-enhancing ingredients, such as basil, lemon balm, grape leaves, cherry leaves or walnut leaves, give Spreewald gherkins their special sour, spicy taste. After the reunification of Germany in 1990, Spreewald gherkins were one of the few products from East Germany which were still available without interruption. The gherkins also achieved fame in 2003 with the award-winning film Good Bye Lenin! by Wolfgang Becker. In this tragicomedy, Daniel Br√ºhl already had great difficulty obtaining the Spreewald gherkins that his sick mother (Katrin Sass) dearly loved and which he absolutely needed to convince her of the continued existence of the (in her view) \\"ideal East German world\\". Meanwhile, the gherkins can again be obtained under their trademarked name Spreew√§lder Gurken, which is a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) in the EU as of March 1999. In 2004, 50 businesses in the region announced their voluntary commitment to declare the Spreewald to be a genetic-engineering-free region. Gherkin locations and the Gurkenradweg The Gurken-Radweg (Gherkin Bicycle Path) There are cucumber fields in all of the Spreewald, the largest part of which is specially protected as the Biosph√§renreservat Spreewald (Bio-sphere Reserve Spreewald) since 1990. The following locations have special offerings on and around the gherkin: * Gol√üen. Spreewaldkonserve Gol√üen - Tour of a gherkin production site * Leipe. Traditional vegetable growing * Lehde. Farmhouse and gherkin museum * Schlepzig. Agricultural history museum * L√ºbbenau/Spreewald. Spreewaldmuseum The Gurken-Radweg (Gherkin Bicycle Path) is named in honor of the gherkin, because of its services. The logo of the tour shows a smiling gherkin on a bicycle. At the annual Spreewald-Marathon, which is held in the disciplines of running, bicycling, hiking, canoeing, and skating, the competition is started with, \\"Auf die Gurke, fertig, los\\" (On the gherkin, steady, go!) instead of \\"Auf die Pl√§tze, fertig, los\\" (ready, steady, go! ).

Plot Charlie Chan arrives in Shanghai at the behest of the U.S. government to help stop an opium smuggling ring. He receives a warning aboard ship not to stop in Shanghai. He is met by his Number One Son, Lee Chan, as well as Philip Nash and his fiance√©, Diana Woodland. Charlie is the guest of honor at a banquet held that evening, hosted by Sir Stanley Woodland (David Torrence in an uncredited role). When Sir Stanley opens a box to give a handwritten scroll to Charlie, he is shot and killed by a gun inside the booby-trapped box. Charlie meets with Colonel Watkins, the commissioner of police, and agrees to investigate the crime. The next day, American FBI man James Andrews arrives in Shanghai, accompanied by his valet, Forrest (Gladden James in an uncredited role). That night, an assassin shoots what seems to be a sleeping Charlie Chan in bed. But Charlie, suspecting another attempt on his life, rigged a dummy and escaped death. Watkins, Nash, and Woodland try to meet with Andrews. Nash sneaks off and goes through Andrews' briefcase, suitcase, and other papers. Charlie arrives, and while he is speaking with Andrews is nearly shot. Charlie and Andrews managed to retrieve the gun, but the assassin escaped. A fingerprint on the gun reveals that Nash is the likely suspect, and he is arrested. A letter Nash had stolen from Andrews' things seem innocuous, but Charlie takes it as evidence. Charlie returns to his hotel and meets with Lee. They receive a note from Col. Watkins asking them to come to an office downtown. They check with police headquarters, which assures them the note is genuine. Charlie goes, but Lee realizes the note is fake when Col. Watkins calls soon thereafter. Charlie is kidnapped and taken into a room to meet with a mysterious Russian (Ivan Marloff). Lee tries to save his father, but is caught. The two bluff their way out of danger, and after a brief fight manage to escape. That evening, Charlie and Andrews meet with Col. Watkins. Diana Woodland arrives and asks to see Nash; her request is granted. But Diana sneaks Nash a pistol, and the two escape. Later that day, Andrews and Charlie return to the house where Charlie was held. The gang has left, but Charlie finds an ink pad in the fireplace and takes it as evidence. Lee shows up dressed as a beggar, and Charlie sends him home. Oddly, Charlie arrives at the hotel first. Lee shows up later, and reveals that he saw their kidnapper in a taxi on the street and followed him to the Cafe Versailles. Moments later, Andrews calls and summons Charlie to his apartment. Before he leaves, Charlie sends Lee off on a secret mission. Charlie arrives at Andrews' apartment, where the FBI agent has caught a gangster involved with the Marloff gang. After a punch to the jaw, the gangster reveals that the Cafe Versailles is where the opium gang is hiding out. Andrews calls the police, and asks them to meet them at the club. Charlie and Andrews leave for Cafe Versailles. After Charlie and Andrews depart, Andrews' valet, Forrest, frees the gangster and the two leave. At the club, Nash (disguised as an able seaman) sees some of the Marloff gang heading toward the basement and follows, but is captured. Charlie and Andrews arrive moments later, and follow a gang member into the basement as well. The basement is where opium is being shipped out via riverboat, reached by a trap door. Andrews urges Charlie to go first, but Charlie hesitates when his flashlight mysteriously refuses to work. The police arrive by boat, and after a brief shootout capture the gang. Charlie surprises everyone by arresting James Andrews. Lee Chan reveals that his father sent him off to cable America, and he has just received a reply which indicates that the real Agent Andrews was murdered in San Francisco three weeks earlier. The false \\"James Andrews\\" is really the leader of the Marloff gang, and intended to have the gang murder Charlie in a shoot-out when they descended through the trap door. Charlie knew Andrews did not really call the police, and had Lee summon them instead. Nash's escape from police custody was planned by Charlie. Charlie reveals that Forrest used the ink pad to put Nash's thumbprint on the revolver to frame him. Nash is declared innocent, and Andrews and Forrest go to jail.

The majority of the route is known as Germantown Road and Germantown Parkway. Route description SR 177 starts in southeast Memphis on Winchester Road near SR 385 (Bill Morris Parkway) with a speed limit of 40 MPH. From there it runs north through the city of Germantown with a speed limit of 35 until it intersects with US 72/SR 57 where the speed limit rises to 40. It then crosses the Wolf River where the speed limit rises to 45 and passes back into Memphis through the Cordova community. SR 177 later intersects I-40 (Exit 16) near the Wolfchase Galleria. SR 177 crosses US 64/SR 15 (Stage Road) in Bartlett, before terminating as a state route at US 70/US 79/SR 1. Germantown Road continues north until Old Brownsville Road near the Brunswick community. Beginning at the US 72/SR 57 intersection, SR 177 turns from a two-lane road into a six-lane highway, and continues in this form through to its north terminus, and from the Wolf River bridge until the I-40 junction, the road is six-lane and has paved outside shoulders on both sides, which only occasionally give way to a fourth lane or a right-turn lane. It also has a grassed median from the Wolf River to US 64. North of I-40 until US 64, the road has 4 lanes in each direction. North of US 64 until the route terminates, the road has 3 lanes in each direction. History Prior to 1990, SR 177 was two lanes throughout its length. After 1990, the route was expanded into its current form from US 72/SR 57 to the I-40 ‚Äì US 64 area. In the late 1990s, it was expanded to its current form between US 64 to US 70/US 79. Germantown Parkway, as it is known locally, has seen significant commercial and residential development starting in the 1990s, including the establishment of restaurants, hotels, planned communities, and the Wolfchase Galleria. North of US 64, however, little new development has taken place besides the addition of a few residential subdivisions, a school, and a Walgreens near US 70/US 79. The speed limit between the Wolf River and I-40 was 50 miles per hour until 2014 when the city of Memphis lowered it to 45 MPH, possibly due to increasing traffic counts. Future Construction to widen a portion of SR 177 from Stout Road to Crestridge Road to 5 lanes has been completed. Also, the portion of SR 177 that overlaps Poplar Avenue was modified in 2013 to allow for two left turn lanes at both the Poplar/West St and Poplar/Germantown Pkwy intersections. This is to complement the new two left turn lanes at Germantown and Farmington.

Wbp11 is found in the nucleus but not the nucleoli of cells in interphase. However it is distributed throughout the cytoplasm in dividing cells. Immunoelectron-microscopy experiments suggest that relocation from a peri-nuclear to a cytoplasmic distribution, coinciding with the onset of mitosis in cell division. Other studies have shown that Wbp11 is a component of the spliceosome. Also, that Wbp11 fragments block pre-mRNA splicing catalysis. Protein interactions Wbp11 is a polypeptide known to interact with other WW domain of proteins such as the nuclear protein Npw38 via two proline-rich regions. It associates with Npw38 (hence the name NpwBP) in the nuclei and with Poly(rG) and G-rich ssDNA. The 70kDa protein has also been found to interact with SH3 (Src homology domain 3) domains. The C-terminal proline-rich sequences of SNP70/NpwBP/Wbp11, which binds to the WW domain of Npw38 also fits with both classic type I and type II SH3 binding sequences, hence the name (SNP70). Wbp11 was found to bind strongly to the tandem SH3 domains of p47phox and to the N-terminal SH3 domain of p47phox, and more weakly to the SH3 domains from c-src and p85Œ±. p47phox. Furthermore, it has been shown to interact with PP1(protein phosphotase 1), hence the name SIPP1. It has an inhibitory effect to PP1, with its inhibitory potency increasing upon phosphorylation with protein kinase CK1. The binding of Wbp11 with PP1 involves a RVXF (Arg-Val-Xaa-Phe) motif, which functions as a PP1- binding sequence in most interactors of PP1.

As part of their conquest of Norway south of Trondheim, and as a countermeasure against reported Allied landings in the Romsdal area of south western Norway, the Germans dropped a company of paratroopers near the vital railroad junction of Domb√•s on 14 April 1940. For the next five days, the German force blocked the Dovre Line railroad line between Oslo and Trondheim, as well as the main road between the two cities. Background Shortly after the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, the Allies launched their own campaign in Norway to support the Norwegian Defence Force and prevent the Germans in seizing control of the strategically important country. On 13 April, Generaloberst Nikolaus von Falkenhorst‚Äîthe commander of the German invasion forces in Norway‚Äîreceived orders from the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW) in Berlin to seize control of the village of Domb√•s, some north of Oslo, by paratroop attack. The reason for the OKW's decision was a false report of Allied landings at √Öndalsnes, an event that only occurred several days later. The main task at hand for the German troops was the destruction of the railroad, as well as blocking any Allied advance inland, particularly south through the Gudbrandsdal valley.Hauge-1 1995: 249Quarrie 2007: 8 Opposing forces=German= The German force air dropped on Domb√•s was the 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the 7th Flieger Division. Based at Heimatstandort Stendal near Magdeburg the unit was ordered to Norway on 12 April, landing at Fornebu Airport near Oslo on 13 April. 1st Company was commanded by Oberleutnant Herbert Schmidt and was 185 strong, armed with light weaponry and 22 MG34 machine guns; four of which were mounted on tripods for the medium machine gun role.Quarrie 2007: 7 While the other four companies of the battalion had been sent into action on the first day of the German invasion of Denmark and Norway, the 1st Company had initially been held in reserve. =Norwegian= The Norwegian force initially based at Domb√•s was the 2nd Battalion of Infantry Regiment 11. Two days after the attack No. 1 Company of Infantry Regiment 5 arrived as reinforcements and on 17 April 2 Battalion was replaced by its sister unit, 1st Battalion of Infantry Regiment 11. Reinforcements in the form of a machine gun platoon and an anti-aircraft gun also arrived on 17 April. On the last day of the battle, the Norwegians were joined by some of the first British forces to see action on land in Norway when a howitzer manned by Royal Marines joined the fighting. Battle=Day one= At around 17:00 Norwegian time on 14 April, 15 Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft took off from Fornebu Airport near Oslo in hail and sleet with low cloud cover. An hour earlier, one Ju 52 had flown a reconnaissance flight over the drop area at Domb√•s without being able to see anything through the cloud cover. Even though the officers on the site wished to postpone the mission due to the weather conditions the fact that the mission was based on a direct command from Adolf Hitler meant that it had to be carried out despite the risks involved. The mission the German Fallschirmj√§ger embarked on was the second opposed paratroop attack in history, the first had occurred five days previously when the Norwegian airbase of Sola near Stavanger was captured during the 9 April invasion of Norway. The drop Map of the ground campaign in southern Norway in April and May, 1940. Domb√•s is in the centre of the top half of the map. When the German aircraft arrived over their target area, after a flight, small breaks in the cloud cover enabled most of the Ju 52s to drop their sticks (loads) of paratroopers. The poor weather conditions led to the Germans being spread over a large area, stretching from Lesja west of the target, V√•l√•sj√∏ north east of the target and locations to the south in the Gudbrandsdal valley. Fighting the II/IR11 To the misfortune of the German paratroopers, their target area was coincidentally also the temporary base and encampment of the 2nd Battalion of the Norwegian Army's Infantry Regiment 11 (II/IR 11). The battalion had been mobilised in Molde a few days previously and had arrived by train in Domb√•s in the evening of 13 April. The deployment had been made in preparation for what the Norwegian Army High Command expected would be a major attempt at reconquering Trondheim in cooperation with Allied forces. Although there were no anti-aircraft guns in the area, II/IR11 had positioned their Colt M/29 heavy machine guns on anti- aircraft mounts in order to provide some basic low-level air defence. The arrival of the German aircraft over Domb√•s came as a surprise to the Norwegian forces who nonetheless soon opened fire on the Ju 52s with all available arms. Gunners aboard the Ju 52s returned fire while flying at treetop level. Soon after, the first paratroopers were dropped over the area and took heavy fire while descending to the ground. The ground fire took a heavy toll on the German transport aircraft, with only five out of the original 15 Ju 52s making it back to Fornebu, with another two landing at V√¶rnes Airbase near Trondheim, all seven surviving aircraft riddled with bullet holes. The remaining eight transports were shot down or made forced landings.Hauge-1 1995: 253 One Ju 52 made an emergency landing on V√§nern Lake near Mariestad, Sweden, where it later broke through the ice and sank. The aircraft was salvaged and returned to the Luftwaffe by the Swedish authorities in January 1941.Hafsten 1991: 31‚Äì32 Many of the paratroopers that had been on the shot-down aircraft died in the crashes, or were killed or captured by Norwegian patrols soon after. Of his originally 185 strong force Oberleutnant Schmidt only managed to gather around him 63 men, the rest having died or been scattered over a vast area. With this straitened force, Schmidt began carrying out the assigned task of blocking the Norwegian rail and road network. The German force blocked the main road in the area and cut the telephone wire running next to it. After capturing a Norwegian taxicab and putting as many of his men as he could in and onto the vehicle, Schmidt drove north toward Domb√•s, stopping at regular intervals to make forward observations. Schmidt is wounded The road near Ulekleiv When the taxi-borne German force reached the farmstead of Li on the road to Domb√•s, they ran into two truck-loads of soldiers from No. 5 Company, IR 11. After some initial confusion the Norwegian opened fire and the Germans charged with submachine guns and hand grenades. Following a short fire fight during which Schmidt was severely wounded and the Norwegians pushed back, the paratroopers abandoned their advance on Domb√•s. They instead pulled back and took up positions in a hedgehog defensive fighting position at the farms of Ulekleiv and Hagevolden, covering all directions and dominating the surrounding landscape. Schmidt‚Äîalthough seriously wounded in the hip and stomach‚Äînever relinquished command and ordered his men to use sand to write messages in the snow to the Luftwaffe asking for supplies of provisions and ammunition. The force was not spotted by Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft and received no supply drops while at Ulekleiv/Hagevolden.Hauge-1 1995: 254 Side-effects of the attack The attack at Domb√•s made the Norwegian Central Bank speed up the evacuation of the Norwegian gold reserves. The of gold had been evacuated from Oslo on 9 April and was being kept in a vault in Lillehammer when the German attack on Domb√•s began. As soon as news of German paratroopers landing spread, the gold was put on a train and brought to √Öndalsnes from where it was evacuated by way of British cruisers and Norwegian fishing boats. King Haakon VII of Norway and his son, Crown Prince Olav were both at Dovre, near the drop zone and only 30 minutes from the nearest groups of paratroopers when the attack began on 14 April. The King and Crown Prince both had to be escorted out of the area by members of the Dovreskogen Rifle Club.Hauge-1 1995: 257 =Day two= Domb√•s Station, the primary objective of the German attack 15 April saw the last remaining stragglers rejoining the Fallschirmj√§ger force at Domb√•s, from then on no reinforcements reached the 1st Company. During the morning the paratroopers fulfilled part of their mission when they blew up the rail road line in three places.Hauge-1 1995: 256 The damage to the line was however quickly repaired by Norwegian work crews, and trains passed through the next day.√Örflot 1985: 49 In the meanwhile Norwegian forces had been assembled and ordered to stop the German advance in the Domb√•s area. As intelligence on the Fallschirmj√§gers was very scarce the Norwegian commanders had little idea of the size and location of the German force. During the day a force of two heavy machine gun platoons with 41 men under the command of Kaptein Eiliv Austlid‚Äî under orders from government minister Trygve Lie‚Äîlaunched an assault without the benefit of a vanguard on Schmidt's position to secure a route of escape for the Norwegian royal family and the Norwegian cabinet. The assault team‚Äîcomposed of Austlid and six or seven volunteers‚Äîstormed across a -long field toward the German positions while receiving cover fire from his own heavy machine guns. With only between them and the Germans, the eight Norwegians had to make their way up the hillside through deep snow. Austlid was only below the first German machine gun nest when he was struck down by a bullet to the chest and the counterattack faltered without its leader. Of the 41 Norwegians caught in the ambush, 28 were captured and five escaped. =Day three= On 16 April, No. 1 Company, IR 5 under the command of Kaptein Botheim arrived on the scene of battle. No. 1 Company attacked the German strongholds from the south while II/IR 11 attacked with one company from the north. The northern onslaught was supported by two mortars and numerous Colt M/29s. After a short fire fight, a white flag appeared at the German positions, and one of the Norwegian soldiers captured in the previous day's ambush was sent over to the Norwegian forces. The released prisoner of war brought with him a demand that the Norwegians surrender and told the Norwegian officer in charge that Schmidt threatened to shoot his prisoners unless the fire ceased. This was probably based on a misunderstanding between the Norwegian POW and Oberleutnant Schmidt, the real meaning most likely being that the prisoners held were endangered by the mortar fire that the German positions were subjected to. In response to the surrender demands a German Feldwebel that the Norwegians had captured was despatched back to Schmidt calling for his surrender. The Germans likewise refused to give in. Breakout from Ulekleiv and Hagevolden While the fruitless negotiations were taking place the Fallschirmj√§gers were preparing to move away from their stronghold and find a new place to fight from. The arrival of the two Norwegian mortars had completely changed the tactical situation and the German force's supply of ammunition was also running dangerously low. Schmidt decided that he had to move his troops into a new and more defensible position. Negotiations were kept up to buy time so the paratroopers could slip away into cover of darkness. Schmidt believed that strong German forces were advancing up the Gudbrandsdal valley and that if he could hold out for a little while longer the situation might still be salvaged. The reality of the situation was however that the German advanced units were stuck just north of Minnesund far to the south of both Gudbrandsdal and Domb√•s. As negotiations collapsed, the Norwegians opened fire again, but a sudden ground blizzard blinded the gunners and allowed the Germans to make a counterattack and break out of their encirclement. The attack threw back the Norwegian forces in the north, whose commander ordered a general retreat to Domb√•s. On the night of 16/17 April, the Fallschirmj√§ger under Schmidt‚Äîhaving thrown back the nearest Norwegian forces‚Äîdisengaged and began to make their way south in the direction of Dovre. 16 April also saw the continuation of mopping up operations by Norwegian units. Twenty-two Germans were captured at Kolstad near Lesja and another 23 at Bottheim train station. The prisoners were initially held in the basement sitting room of Ulekleiv Hotel in Domb√•s.√Örflot 1985: 67 =Day four= Early in the morning on 17 April, the Germans withdrew from their positions, covered by three heavy machine guns captured from the Norwegians in the ambush on 15 April. The paratroopers formed a fighting column with hand grenade armed soldiers at the front followed by the wounded and the POWs on trucks with a rearguard at the end. At Landheim road bridge, a 25-strong Norwegian force blocked the way, but was quickly thrown back to Dovre Church by a night attack with hand grenades. The German force took up temporary positions at Einbugga road bridge, midway between the village of Toftemo to the north and Dovre to the south. Lindse Farms With daybreak, Schmidt's men began to search out a new position which could provide good cover without the risk of being attacked from the rear. This they found at the North and South Lindse Farm, a farmstead high on a hillside and dominating both the railway line ( away) and the main road ( away). North Lindse‚Äîwith its stone barn‚Äîbecame the strong point of the defence, with South Lindse being used to keep Norwegian prisoners; 15 military personnel and 40 civilians. The farm buildings were quickly fortified with sandbags and planking. Oberleutnant Schmidt was carried to Lindse on a door by Norwegian POWs. Renewed fighting On the morning of 17 April, fighting was renewed when first the Norwegian Major Alv Kj√∏s and then No. 1 Company ran into German ambushes by Lindse. Kj√∏s was captured, as was the vanguard of No. 1 Company. The main force of No. 1 Company fought its way out, pulling back to Dovre Church at 10:00. After the first encounter of the day, the main Norwegian forces failed to realise that the whole Fallschirmj√§ger force had moved to Lindse and spent the day reorganizing and receiving reinforcements. II/IR 11 was replaced by its sister battalion, I/IR 11, and a machine gun platoon from the Norwegian Army Air Service‚Ä≤ Jagevingen fighter unit (the unit having lost all its aircraft around Oslo on 9 April) arrived to reinforce the attacks on Schmidt's paratroopers. For most of the day the abandoned German positions at Ulekleiv was bombarded by Norwegian mortars. Only in evening did the Norwegian commanders discover where the Germans had relocated. On the night of 17/18 April, fenrik (Second Lieutenant) L. K. L√∏kken of the Raufoss Anti-aircraft Command arrived with a 40 mm anti-aircraft gun.Zeiner-Gundersen: 222 =Day five= 18 April turned out to be a decisive day in the battle. The Germans at Lindse were surrounded to the north by the battalion I/IR 11 and to the south by No. 1 Company, IR 5, reinforced by various smaller forces that had arrived the previous day. The company in the south also had the 40 mm AA gun, positioned at Dovre Train Station, as artillery support. Early in the morning Norwegian soldiers made their way into the hills south of Lindse Farm and opened fire. According to Schmidt, this was when the situation became truly dire: > One step out of the nest or the house brought death. We now clung on only to > the thought of immediate assistance. Although the German positions were well fortified their ammunition was running very low and it was soon only a question of time before surrender became the only option left. Help, however, arrived that very morning when a Junkers Ju 52 air dropped ammunition, warm clothing, provisions, medical supplies and the radio frequency for communicating with headquarters. Later in the day a Norwegian officer approached Schmidt asking for his surrender, but was rejected. The Norwegian 40 mm AA gun kept up a bombardment of Lindse Farms throughout the day, firing 40‚Äì50 rounds at positions around the farm buildings and in two nearby ravines. By evening the Germans had all sought shelter in the farm houses as these could not be bombarded directly due to the Norwegian prisoners being held there. =The last day= Oberleutnant Herbert Schmidt after receiving his Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in May 1940 Fallschirmj√§gers being awarded with the Iron Cross in May 1940 by General Karl Kitzinger The book by Herbert Schmidt: Die Fallschirmj√§ger von Dombas, Berlin 1941 By dawn on 19 April, the Germans were completely surrounded by better- armed Norwegian troops. During the night, a final reinforcement had reached the Norwegians; a rail-mounted howitzer manned by a gun crew of Royal Marines that had arrived from √Öndalsnes. The howitzer had 300 rounds available and opened fire at 06:00, firing ten rounds with good accuracy. Soon after another Ju 52 transport arrived carrying supplies to the beleaguered Germans but turned around without making its drop after receiving a radio message from Schmidt informing that the paratroopers were going to surrender. Later on. Schmidt sent out his second-in-command‚ÄîLeutnant Ernst M√∂ssinger‚Äîto negotiate a surrender, hoping to reach favourable terms. Major Arne Sunde, the Norwegian commander, however refused to accept anything but an unconditional surrender. Sunde told M√∂ssinger that unless the Germans announced their surrender within 10 minutes by launching three flares the British and Norwegian artillery would recommence bombarding Lindse Farm. Nine and a half minutes later, at 11:30, the Fallschirmj√§ger force at Lindse fired three signal flares. Forty-five Fallschirmj√§ger surrendered at Lindse Farms, six of whom were wounded. After having been fed at the municipal building in Dovre, the captured Germans were sent by train to Domb√•s.√Örflot 1985: 119 Aftermath The Germans lost a total of 21 dead during the battle, as well as 40 wounded or injured. Of these, 15 of the fatalities occurred during the initial phase of the attack, as well as 20 wounded and 14 personnel suffering injuries. Six more were killed and another six wounded during the fighting that led to the final German surrender on 19 April. Around 150 Germans were taken as prisoners of war. Seven Junkers Ju 52 transports were shot by ground-fire and an eighth Ju 52 landed in neutral Sweden.Hauge-1 1995: 262 Norwegian casualties in the battle totaled 20 dead and 20 wounded. The Norwegian and German wounded who were treated by the Norwegian medical service were first treated at a field hospital in Domb√•s, before being moved to a regular hospital. The first train loads of wounded, leaving Domb√•s on 16 April, were destined for Molde Hospital in Molde, with later transports sent with the hospital ship from √Öndalsnes to √Ölesund Hospital in √Ölesund.√Örflot 1985: 45‚Äì46Flatmark 1988: 54, 62 German dead were buried by the Norwegian military in mass graves, eventually being moved post-war to a German War Graves Commission cemetery in Alfaset, Oslo.√Örflot 1985: 51 Following their surrender, the captured German soldiers were sent to rear areas in the Romsdal region, the severely wounded to the hospital in √Ölesund and the remainder (135 soldiers)Hauge-2 1995: 178 to a school in Kristiansund.√Örflot 1985: 125 During German bombing raids on Kristiansund on 28‚Äì29 April, the prisoners of war suffered several wounded. Following the bombing of Kristiansund, the prisoners were moved by lighters to Aver√∏y near Kristiansund, where they were initially kept in a school until a proper a prisoner-of-war camp had been built at Bruhagen.√Örflot 1985: 71 Initially the prisoners had been sent to a transit prisoner-of-war-camp at Isfjorden near √Öndalsnes, but this camp did not have the capacity to house the numbers captured at Domb√•s.√Örflot 1985: 70‚Äì71 The intention of Norwegian authorities was to first keep the prisoners for interrogation and then ship them to the United Kingdom, but in the chaos of the collapse of resistance in the southern parts of Norway and the Allies' evacuation from √Öndalsnes in late April/early May the German POWs were left behind to be freed by elements of the Luftwaffe's General G√∂ring Regiment. Of the captured Fallschirmj√§gers only three fell into British hands and were brought to the United Kingdom when the British evacuated from the southern parts of Norway. One of the three had been able to evade capture after the jump over Domb√•s until he was caught by retreating British and Norwegian forces in Domb√•s proper on 29 April.M√∏lmen 1996: 224 Thirteen paratroopers had been taken prisoner near Lillehammer on 14 April after their Ju 52 had been shot down en route to the target. Three of the Germans on board were wounded and were sent to Lillehammer Hospital. The unwounded prisoners were eventually transferred to Lom prisoner of war camp in Lom in Oppland.M√∏lmen 1996: 196‚Äì197 The pilot of the downed Ju 52 had committed suicide when Norwegian troops approached.√Örflot 1985: 48 In the aftermath of the German attack on Domb√•s, efforts were made by Norwegian military authorities to prevent further Fallschirmj√§ger landings by organizing volunteers into anti-paratroop ski patrols. By 23 April 415 volunteers from 13 local rifle clubs were carrying out regular patrols of the mountains of √òsterdalen. Of the volunteers, 100 had military uniforms, the rest only armbands. Second-line regular troops were also employed to guard against new German paratroop attacks.Den krigshistorisk avdeling 1953, pp. 170‚Äì171 The weapons captured from the Germans at Domb√•s were not distributed to Norwegian troops, but rather stored at the village of Tretten, where they were recaptured by the Germans on 23 April.M√∏lmen 1996: 225 Most of the freed paratroopers soon after volunteered to jump into the isolated Narvik front in North Norway to help the hard pressed Gebirgsj√§gers of the German 3rd Mountain Division fighting under the command of Generalleutnant Eduard Dietl from 16 May. Many of the survivors from Domb√•s died fighting under the leadership of Leutnant M√∂ssinger at Narvik. Herbert Schmidt‚Äîthe leader of the Fallschirmj√§ger force at Domb√•s‚Äîreceived the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 24 May 1940, for his efforts during the battle. He later recovered from the wounds he had suffered, and in 1941 wrote a book detailing his experiences during the battle called Die Fallschirmj√§ger von Dombaas. Schmidt was killed by the French Resistance in 1944.

Expression and localization  CLIC5 exists in two alternative splice variants, a smaller CLIC5A and larger CLIC5B protein. CLIC5A is expressed chiefly in the renal glomerulus, specifically in podocytes. Within the cell, CLIC5A is localized to the plasma membrane and the cytosol, and associates and is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton. CLIC5A can form ion channels in vitro and its channel activity is regulated by actin, though measurement of its chloride conductance in vitro suggests that CLIC5A is equally selective for cations and anions.  Function  Although chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) proteins were thought to be involved in ion transport in subcellular compartments, their actual functions suggest their role in diverse cellular and physiological functions including apoptosis and angiogenesis in CLIC1. CLIC5A, through its interactions with the small GTPase Rac1, induces the phosphorylation of ezrin-moeisin-radixin (ERM) proteins and localized production of the phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. These two events activate ezrin, enabling it to couple transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, which could represent a mechanism by which podocyte foot processes form to enable renal filtration.

Heidi grew up listening to the metallic sounds of her dad repairing cars and her mother playing the organ. As a teenager, Heidi moved to Barcelona and started to experiment with sound and acoustics. 00s After playing her first concert, Mortenson was appointed Resident Artist 2003 at the annual experimental LEM Festival in Barcelona. Hereafter she went on a European tour with visual artist SOLU, with whom she performed the Opening Act of Transmediale Festival 2004 in Berlin. That same year Heidi moved to Berlin, where she started working on her debut album 'Wired Stuff' and founded her own label Wired Records. Mortenson's critically acclaimed 2005 debut album 'Wired Stuff', released on Mortenson's own imprint Wired Records, revealed a visionary and bold producer. It offered up deeply queered DIY- pop ‚Äì synthesized, direct tomboytronica cut with soul-y flourishes, and spell- binding androgyny. The Danish music magazine Musiktidsskriftet Geiger selected her album 'Don't Lonely Me', as one of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The song 'Hurt Machine' from 'Don't Lonely Me' is featured on the popular American / Canadian TV series The L Word in season 6.07. Mortenson gained attention from her concert at the SPOT Festival 2008, receiving good reviews by the press. The music magazine Gaffa credited her 5 stars, Musiktidsskriftet Geiger wrote \\"overall probably the best concert of this year's SPOT festival and musically absolutely the bravest\\", the UK Telegraph stated \\"The girl who totally blew my mind was Heidi Mortenson (‚Ä¶) She conjures up weirdly colourful, avant-garde dance tracks out of nothing (‚Ä¶) Fantastically entertaining and completely original, if Madonna really wants to start pushing popular music into new areas she should forget working with established American production talents like Timbaland and give this mad Dane a call.\\" 10s Mortenson's style is not easy to categorize, as her songs are unbound to any specific genre. The cassette tape release Circular Tape self-released in 2010, was made from using a microphone and 7 effect pedals. The sound source being Mortenson's voice. The songs are recorded using instant composing style; meaning onto one track, without arrangement or preparation. Mortenson has also performed a great deal live as a solo act, building up songs by sampling her voice through efx pedals and singing. In 2010 Heidi took part in Laurie Anderson's remix contest and got an honourable mention and streaming of the remix on Anderson's website. Hereafter followed the double album 'Run For Covers' featuring on one disc Mortenson's cover songs of various artists including Cat Power, David Bowie, Devendra Banhart, Anne Linnet, and more. The other disc featuring various artists' covering a self-chosen Mortenson song. This was a digital release that presented a new song every week. The release is featured on Mortenson's bandcamp. In 2012 Mortenson composed the original soundtrack for the theater piece 'Luft Havn', which premiered in Denmark at the new cultural center Godsbanen. Later that year, Mortenson's first songs with native lyrics released on RUMP Recordings. The EP titled 'M√∏rk' (meaning 'Dark') gained a lot of attention and positive reviews from the critics. For 'M√∏rk EP' Mortenson was nominated two Gaffa Music Awards. One for Best Danish Artist and one for Best Danish Release 2012. 'M√∏rk EP' (\\"Characterized by its mature essence and pensive vocals, M√∏rk is a powerful combination of ferociousness and utmost delicacy.\\", AIAIAI) saw Mortenson, with a fearless dive into the darkness, reveal her ability to combine a new sound of pop-oriented music with blinding native language that led international listeners to their own interpretation by the sheer and unmistaken atmosphere of the music. Hereafter followed two instrumental singles in 2015 and two singles in 2017 with Danish lyrics. And in between the native languaged album Tid which released in 2016 on Mortenson's own imprint Voodoo Echo. For this album Mortenson again was nominated two Music Awards by Gaffa. The record is perhaps Mortenson's most electronic sounding to date. In 2018 Mortenson made a sound installation for the solo exhibition of acclaimed painter Mette Winckelmann. Over this long period of several years Mortenson has stopped playing live concerts. In 2019, reclusive left field producer, Heidi Mortenson released her radical fourth album titled Spectrum which marks the Woods-via-Barcelona-and-Berlin producer's most intimate album to date, a kinetic, self-produced record flush with attitude, playfulness and vulnerability. Spectrum offers up something brighter together with what characterizes Mortenson's music: emotionally- charged, biographical anthems drawn from lived experiences as a gay, autistic, gender-non-conforming artist. An artist on the spectrum in all regards. \\"Humans come in a wide variety of identities within gender and sexuality, just like people on the autism spectrum have something in common, but yet are very different. That is why it makes sense to talk about a spectrum which offers diversity instead of stereotypes.‚Äù Mortenson‚Äôs approach is emotion and commitment to detail and how the feeling of a situation translates into sound. Ultimately, Spectrum is a celebration of liberation, a melodic-filled record that sees Mortenson consolidating spectrum both personal and artistic. Trivia In the start of her career, Heidi used only her second name Mortenson and (reversed) 'Nosnetrom' to mask her gender. Mortenson speaks several languages: she is fluent in English, Spanish and Danish, and also speaks German and some Norwegian and Swedish. In a 2007 interview, Mortenson revealed that she is on the Autistic Spectrum, like her father and grandfather.

Dick, ed., Albumazar: a Comedy [1615], Berkeley, University of California Press, 1944. Productions The play was specially commissioned by Trinity College, Cambridge to entertain King James I during his 1615 visit to the University. College officials sought a play from alumnus Tomkis, then a lawyer in Wolverhampton, who had written the successful Lingua for his college a decade earlier. Gentlemen of Trinity College acted Albumazar before the King and his court on 9 March 1615 (new style). One report on this production from an audience member survives, in a letter from John Chamberlain to Dudley Carleton ‚Äì though Chamberlain thought it a failure.Zachary Lesser, Renaissance Drama and the Politics of Publication: Readings in the English Book Trade, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; p. 71. The play was revived onstage during the Restoration, by the Duke's Company at their theatre at Lincoln's Inn Fields; Samuel Pepys saw it on 22 February 1668. In 1744 playwright James Ralph adapted Tomkis's play into his The Astrologer; it was not a success, and ran for one performance only. In 1747 David Garrick revived Tomkis's original; and in 1773 Garrick made and staged his own adaptation. Publication Albumazar was entered into the Stationers' Register on 28 April 1615, and was published soon after in a quarto printed by Nicholas Okes for the bookseller Walter Burre. (The 1615 quarto was issued in two states, which have sometimes been defined as two separate editions.) The play is anonymous in its first edition, though college records clearly assign it to Tomkis. A second edition was issued in 1634 by Nicholas Okes (also in two states); that edition claims to have been \\"Newly revised and corrected by a special Hand,\\" though the changes in the text amount to little more than normal proofreading and correction of errors. A new edition was published by Thomas Dring in 1668 to coincide with the Restoration revival.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 498‚Äì9. Ralph's and Garrick's adaptations both were published, in 1744 and 1773 respectively. Though consensus scholarship accepts the attribution of Albumazar to Tomkis, a few individual commentators have proposed alternative hypotheses of authorship ‚Äì one even assigning the play to Shakespeare. None of these alternatives has won scholarly approval. Sources The protagonist of the play is based on a historical figure named Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi, known in the West as Albumazar; he was a ninth-century mathematician and philosopher who also worked as an astrologer (just as Johannes Kepler cast horoscopes while revolutionising astronomy). Tomkis based his dramatic treatment on the play L'Astrologo by Giambattista della Porta, a work first published in Venice in 1606. Tomkis's play also shows debts to Ben Jonson's The Alchemist and Shakespeare's The Tempest (the character name Trincalo in Tomkis's play derives from Trinculo in Shakespeare's). When John Dryden wrote the Prologue for the 1668 revival of Albumazar, he got the relationship between the Tomkis and Jonson plays backwards, and accused Jonson of borrowing from Tomkis.Thorton S. Graves, \\"Notes on Elizabethan Plays,\\" Modern Philology Vol. 23 No. 1 (August 1925), pp. 1‚Äì5. The \\"perspicill\\" In addition to purely literary sources, Tomkis also exploited Galileo Galilei's revolutionary book on his astronomical discoveries, Sidereus Nuncius, \\"The Starry Messenger\\" (1610). Galileo referred to the telescope as the \\"perspicillum,\\" a term that Tomkis Anglicized into \\"perspicill.\\" (The earliest English commentators on Galileo wrote before the telescope had even acquired its name; in his 1620 masque News from the New World Discovered in the Moon, Jonson called the instrument a \\"trunk,\\" or tube.) In keeping with his satirical intent, Tomkis gives a fanciful rather than realistic portrayal of the telescope, describing it as \\"an engine to catch starres\\" and \\"arrest\\" planets in their motions. Looking through it, a man in London can allegedly see Dover. When a character looks into the perspicill, he is amazed to view a richly-dressed crowd ‚Äì which is the audience watching the performance of the play. In a related flight of fancy, Tomkis's fraudulent astrologer produces a comparable instrument for extending the range of human hearing, which he calls the \\"otacousticon\\" ‚Äì and which turns out to be an artificial pair of ass's ears.Hugh G. Dick, \\"The Telescope and the Comic Imagination,\\" Modern Language Notes Vol. 58 No. 7 (November 1943), pp. 544‚Äì8. Albumazar also claims to possess a \\"wind instrument\\" that speaks ten languages. Synopsis Two elderly gentlemen, Antonio and Pandulfo, have formed an agreement to marry each other's daughters, Flavia and Sulpitia. Prior to the marriage, Antonio sails to Barbary to access his hoard of gold; but he does not return in time for the ceremony. Pandulfo is mad to have Flavia, but is frustrated by the resistance of the girl and her brother Lelio. (Pandulfo is sixty; Flavia is sixteen.) Desperate for help, Pandulfo consults Albumazar the astrologer. Albumazar, however, is a fraud and confidence man, in league with a band of thieves. He bamboozles his victims with verbose gibberish (\\"excentricals, / Centers, concentrics, circles, and epicycles,\\" and \\"with scioferical instrument, / By way of azimuth and almicantarath,\\" and \\"Necro-puro-geo-hydro-cheiro-coscinomancy,\\" and much more) while setting them up to be robbed by his confederates. Albumazar convinces Pandulfo that he can transform the tenant farmer Trincalo into a double of Antonio for twenty-four hours; while in this form, Trincalo can deliver Flavia. The foolish Trincalo actually believes in the transformation, which gives the thieves opportunity to trick and abuse him. Matters become more complex when the genuine Antonio returns from his adventures; he is mistaken for Trincalo, much to his confusion and distress. The old man establishes his identity, though, and expresses his regret at the marriage agreement he'd entered into with Pandulfo. The young people and Antonio trick Pandulfo into agreeing to a new bargain: Antonio's son Lelio and Pandulfo's son Eugenio marry the girls in place of their fathers. The thieves have relieved the distracted Pandulfo of three thousand pounds' worth of his property; but in their greed they cut Albumazar out of any share in the loot. The chastened astrologer turns them in; Pandulfo regains his wealth, which moderates his resentment at his loss of Flavia. Albumazar is forgiven. (The play also contains Tomkis's Prologue, in which he states that he chose to write the work in English rather than Latin, the language of most academic plays, because of the increasing number of women in the audience.) Influences Oliver Goldsmith borrowed one plot element (a robbery) from Albumazar for his 1772 play She Stoops to Conquer. Because of Tomkis's play and its adaptations, the name Albumazar came to be used as a generic term for an astrologer. It is employed in this sense in William Congreve's Love for Love (1695) and in Tobias Smollett's The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751).

A seemingly harmless family outing drags a vacationing Chan into a murder investigation. The film's sets were designed by the art director Duncan Cramer.  Plot  Charlie Chan takes his wife and twelve children on an outing to a circus after receiving a free pass from one of the owners, Joe Kinney. Kinney wants Chan to find out who is sending him anonymous threatening letters. Nearly all of the circus workers are suspects, since Kinney is very unpopular. However, when Chan goes to meet him during the night's performance, he finds the man dead, seemingly killed by a rampaging gorilla who somehow escaped from his cage. Lieutenant Macy takes charge of the investigation, assisted by Chan and his overzealous eldest son Lee, who also takes the opportunity to (unsuccessfully) romance Su Toy (Toshia Mori, credited as Shia Jung), the contortionist. On Chan's advice, Macy lets the circus continue on to its next stop, with the trio tagging along. During the train ride, an attempt is made to murder Chan with a poisonous cobra. Then someone tries to break into the circus's safe, but nothing is missing. Macy finds a marriage certificate inside, showing that Kinney supposedly married circus wardrobe lady Nellie Farrell in Mexico. However, Kinney's fiance Marie Norman claims that she can prove Kinney was not in Mexico the day indicated on the certificate. Before she can prove it, during her act, someone shoots one of the ropes of her trapeze swing and she falls to the ground, seriously injured, but still alive. A doctor is summoned. Chan states that Marie is too badly hurt to move, so the doctor must operate on the spot. Chan asks everyone to keep quiet and clear the area, so as not to cause a potentially fatal distraction for the medical staff during the delicate operation. Meanwhile, Chan has noticed a newspaper article about a crime committed at a casino the day of Kinney's alleged marriage. He sends his son to phone for a description of the crooks involved from the police. When Lee returns, he sees a man slug the policeman guarding the gorilla's cage and let the ape out again. He struggles with the man, but is knocked out. The gorilla reaches the tent where the operation is in progress and tries to cause trouble. The operation is a fake, as is the gorilla. He is shot to death by policemen masquerading as doctors. It is revealed to be snake charmer Tom Holt in a costume, trying to pin a second death on the escaped animal. He and Kinney had robbed the casino and hidden out at the circus. However they had had a falling out over the division of the money, leading to Kinney's murder. Nellie Farrell and her brother Dan are also arrested for trying to use a forgery to gain half interest in the circus. Charlie Chan agrees to obtain a lifetime pass to the circus for his family. He sees Lee Chan and Su Toy having some romance together wondering if any future grandchildren will be able to see the circus, too.

It was part of the Darebin City Council's Public Art Program, and is located beside the Fairfield railway station. Development FIDO was announced in 1999 as one of a number of projects funded through the council's public art program. From the outset there was considerable community opposition to the project, with members of the local community petitioning the council in order to stop the project from proceeding ‚Äì at one stage approximately 400 local residents were surveyed by a local shop owner, and it was reported that 90% of those who responded opposed the work. The opposition to the project was such that it has since been described as \\"one of Melbourne's most fiery debates about public art\\". To deal with the concerns, the council engaged in community consultation during all phases of the project's development, and argued that one of the core roles of a council is to provide services supporting arts and culture, in conjunction with the more everyday tasks such as rubbish collection. Nevertheless, some questions remained even after the project's completion in April, 2000. In particular, the $50,000 price tag for FIDO was highlighted by people critical of the council's expenditure on public art, arguing that the money could have been better spent on more essential services. Design Erected in April 2000 and created by Ian Sinclair, Jackie Staude, David Davies and Alistair Knox, the work is constructed from recycled hardwood, standing 5.5 metres tall and approximately 8 metres long. The theme was chosen in order to \\"represent the precinct's dog-loving community\\", and it was originally designed to interact with viewers ‚Äì sensors allowed it to respond the presence of onlookers by wagging its tail, wiggling its ears and lighting up at night. According to the artists (from Creating Place: Public Art Policy and Practice in Darebin): The original ability to interact (including talk) with onlookers ceased to function prior to 2006, at which point the council was considering whether or not to upgrade the mechanism. Impact In spite of the initial controversy, artists behind the project believe that FIDO has become accepted by the community. This was reflected by the council incorporating FIDO into the title of their public art plan in 2006, with \\"Beyond Fido: Darebin City Council Public Art Strategy 2006 to 2015\\", \\"Perhaps an indication of Darebin Council's confidence that the Fido sculpture in Station St, Fairfield, has been publicly accepted is its decision to name its new public art strategy after Fido.\\" and FIDO becoming part of the Fairfield Traders Association's logo in 2005. In spite of this acceptance, some opposition remained, and in 2003 the \\"Revolutionary Council for the Removal of Bad Art in Public Places\\" named FIDO as one of the \\"six worst public art works in Australia\\" and threatened to set it alight, the council responding by regarding the interstate interest in FIDO as flattering and describing the work as a \\"much-loved sculpture\\". FIDO is one item of the more than 150 of Australia's Big Things.

The protein encoded by this gene is a mitochondrial membrane protein involved in lipid and glycerolipid metabolism. It catalyzes the formation of phosphatidic and lysophosphatidic acids. Defects in this gene have been associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 10. Diseases associated with AGK include cataracts and cardiomyopathy. An important paralog of this gene is CERKL. Structure The AGK gene is located on the 7th chromosome, with its specific location being 7q34. The gene contains 18 exons. AGK encodes a 47.1 kDa protein that is composed of 422 amino acids; 32 peptides have been observed through mass spectrometry data.] Function Acylglycerol kinase synthesizes phosphatidic and lysophosphatidic acids. The enzyme uses ATP to put a phosphate group on acyl glycerol and diacylglycerol. It catalyzes the following reactions: ATP + acylglycerol = ADP + acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. ATP + 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol = ADP + 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. The enzyme is involved in the more general pathway of fatty acid metabolism. AGK also has an implicated role in the assembly of the adenine nucleotide translocator in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Clinical significance Mutations in the AGK gene were the first to be implicated in isolated cataract development, although it is unclear whether these mutations cause a change in lipid composition of the lenses, or if signaling results in the defect. This gene has also been associated with Sengers syndrome. Two different phenotypes have been observed. One form of the disorder presented as vascular strokes, lactic acidosis, cardiomyopathy and cataracts, abnormal muscle cell histopathology and mitochondrial function. In those patients, there was also a markedly high rate of citrate synthase. The second phenotype presented with similar clinical symptoms, but no strokes. As phosphatidic acid is also involved in the synthesis of phospholipids, its loss will result in changes to the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane. These effects manifest as cataract formation in the eye, respiratory chain dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy in heart tissue. AGK expression has also been correlated with certain cancer phenotypes. AGK expression, in coordination with AGX, was not detected in non-neoplastic epithelia, while both were weakly expressed in the majority of high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN). Expressions of both enzymes were significantly correlated with primary Gleason grade of cancer foci and capsular invasion. Overexpression of AGK sustains constitutive JAK2/STAT3 activation, consequently promoting the cancer stem cell population and augmenting the tumorigenicity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, AGK levels significantly increases STAT3 phosphorylation, poorer disease-free survival, and shorter overall survival in primary ESCC. More importantly, AGK expression was significantly correlated with JAK2/STAT3 hyperactivation in ESCC, as well as in lung and breast cancer. In prostate cancer, AGK expression amplifies EGF signaling pathways, thus playing a significant role in the development of prostate cancer. It‚Äôs also correlated tumor-nodule-metastasis (TNM) classification breast cancer, and an overall shorter overall survival. Interactions In the progression of diabetic retinopathy, the ATX-AGK-LPA signaling axis plays a significant role. In the proliferation of prostate cancer, AGK interacts with and regulates PC-3 prostate cancer cells markedly increased formation and secretion of LPA. This increase also affects the EGF receptor and sustained activation of extracellular signal related kinase (ERK) 1/2, culminating in enhanced cell proliferation. Acylglycerol kinase also augments JAK2/STAT3 signaling in esophageal squamous cells.
