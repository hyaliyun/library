He decided to attend college \\"by chance\\", as he had never received any formal college guidance and had applied to City College of New York solely because friends of his were applying there. He graduated from City College in 1953 having majored in classical and romance languages while working six nights a week at a hospital. He served in the United States Army in South Korea after graduating from college. While in the Army, Quinones was given the responsibility of helping his fellow soldiers earn their GED, an experience that led him to pursue the field of education. After completing his military service, he attended Columbia University, where he earned a master's degree in Hispanic literature in 1965 and a Master of Education degree in 1967 at Hunter College.Martin, Douglas. \\"Nathan Quinones Dies at 79; Led New York City Schools\\", The New York Times, July 27, 2010.

He was hired by the New York City Public Schools in 1957, where he was initially assigned to teach Spanish language at Thomas Jefferson High School. Quinones worked his way up to head the foreign languages department at Benjamin N. Cardozo High School and was named principal of South Bronx High School in 1977. Incoming School Chancellor Frank J. Macchiarola dismissed Samuel Polatnick as Executive Director of High Schools and named Quinones to the $43,000 a year position as Polatnick's replacement, naming him to the position without having advertised the post and bypassing principals with far more experience than Quinones had.Chambers, Marcia. \\"New Chancellor Will Insist on Top Performance; Will Not Tolerate Excuse\\", The New York Times, June 30, 1978.

Early years and education Skrynnik was born on 30 August 1961 in Chelyabinsk, Russia. Her father was a mining engineer. In 1986, she graduated from Chelyabinsk Medical Academy. In 1992, Skrynnik graduated from the State Academy of Agriculture of the Russian Federation and interned in Germany and France in the field of leasing technologies this made her a rare specialist in her field. Career After graduation Skrynnik worked at the Chelyabinsk Polytechnical Institute clinic and later as deputy chief surgeon of Chelyabinsk Metallurgy Enterprise clinic. She then continued her medical career in cardiology at a regional clinic. In 1994, she founded an Inter-regional Medical Leasing company named Medleasing. She was even named \\"Madam Leasing\\" and accused of money laundering. However, the inspection and audit of the Accounting Chamber did not confirm these allegations. As a result, the article was received by leading experts as an attempt to slow down the development of the leasing industry in Russia by attacking Elena Skrynnik as the actual creator, ideological inspirer and the best Russian specialist in this field.–ü—Ä–æ–∫—É—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞ –®–≤–µ–π—Ü–∞—Ä–∏–∏ –Ω–µ –ø–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–¥–∏–ª–∞ –∞—Ä–µ—Å—Ç —Å—á–µ—Ç–æ–≤ –°–∫—Ä—ã–Ω–Ω–∏–∫ In 1998, she was given an international award for the best leasing project. Since 1997, she chaired the Russian Association of Leasing Companies and in 1998 she became the chairwoman of Experts Council for Leasing. In 1999, the Russian Biography Institute declared her The Person of the Year in nomination in economics and entrepreneurship. Since 2000, she has also been a board member of the Union of Russian Manufacturers and Entrepreneurs. In 2002, she became the general director of the state-run company Rosagroleasing. According to the newspaper ¬´Kommersant, ¬´Rosagroleasing¬ª under the guidance of Skrynnik had significantly higher turnover and greater transparency of operations compared with the same indicators under the guidance of Valery Nazarov.

Her tenure ended in 2012 when she was removed from office due to her alleged involvement in nepotism and illegal activities to raise her wealth. Skrynnik was not included in the new Russian government in 2012, for she was on maternity leave. Allegations of possible corruption connections were refuted by the report of the Accounting Chamber, according to which the lessees debt in 2008 amounted to 1 billion rubles and not 39 billion rubles, as the media claimed.

On February 18, 2016 a TV program \\"Moment of Truth\\" came on the Channel 5, which stated that the charges in the address of Skrynnik were a frame-up. An author and presenter Andrew Karaulov analyzing Skrynnik activity as a Minister of Agriculture, concluded that the cause of the incident was her decision to drastically reduce imports of \\"Bush legs\\" to the Russian market. Another reason was called the successful implementation of the program of import substitution by Skrynnik signed by Putin. In an attempt to discredit Skrynnik, the film accused the largest producers of chicken meat from the United States, and as a proof of the groundlessness of the attacks on the ex-minister nominated the fact that on any of the charges against Skrynnik - in Russia, Switzerland and other countries - criminal cases were not opened.–°–∫—Ä—ã–Ω–Ω–∏–∫ –ï–ª–µ–Ω–∞. –§–∞–∫—Ç—ã –∏ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç—ã. –í—ã–ø—É—Å–∫ –æ—Ç 18.02.2016 In October 2015, Swiss Federal attorney opened a criminal investigation against Skrynnik on the suspicion of money laundering and ordered her bank accounts to be arrested.

Their report covered 53 species represented by new material, with an additional 14 names carried over from earlier reports, but not verified from their collecting. Alan Solem have reported 10 new taxa (3 newly described species and 6 found species) that were previously not known from Afghanistan in 1979. Up to 1979, 73 taxa of molluscs have been recorded from Afghanistan. It is obvious that knowledge of the Afghanistan molluscan fauna is in a very preliminary stage. The same statements apply to surrounding areas, with the exception of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north (that were part of the U.S.S.R. at that time), where the summary volumes of Likharev & Rammel'meier (1962)Likharev I.

The probability of additional taxa existing is very high, particularly among the Helicoidea and Enidae. Since the Street collections (from Street Expedition of 1962-1963) were made incidentally to mammal collecting, the relatively high percentage of unrecorded taxa suggests that only the tip of Afghanistan molluscan diversity has been sampled.

(1998) Rethinking Construction: Report of the Construction Task Force, London: HMSO. (Copy of report available on Constructing Excellence website: report. Accessed: 8 September 2014.) Together with the Latham Report, Constructing the Team, produced four years earlier, it did much to drive efficiency improvements in UK construction industry practice during the early years of the 21st century.Ward, Don and Crane, Alan (2003) \\"The story so far\\" in Jones, David, Savage, David and Westgate Rona, Partnering and Collaborative Working (Informa Professional, London), pp 1-26. Historical context While the 1994 Latham Report had stimulated various industry initiatives, government action was deemed necessary to get the industry to make the necessary changes. In October 1997, the then Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott commissioned a Construction Task Force, chaired by Sir John Egan, a former chief executive of Jaguar Cars, to look at the construction industry from the clients' perspective. The Task Force was to advise on opportunities to improve the efficiency and quality of the UK construction industry's service and products, to reinforce the impetus for change, and to make the industry more responsive to the needs of its customers. Report Informed by experiences in other industries (notably manufacturing), the Task Force report endorsed much of the progressive thinking already under way, and sought to improve performance through eliminating waste or non-value-adding activities from the construction process. It identified five key drivers of change: *committed leadership *a focus on the customer *integrated processes and teams *a quality driven agenda, and *commitment to people. Having put the client's needs at the very heart of the process, it advocated an integrated project process based around four key elements: *product development *project implementation *partnering the supply chain, and *production of components. Legacy Existing industry bodies such as the Construction Industry Board, Construction Best Practice Programme and the Design Build Foundation incorporated the Egan agenda into their activities, and were augmented by a new industry organisation, the Movement for Innovation. These national level organisations were tasked with application of the ideas of Rethinking Construction through ‚Äòdemonstration projects‚Äô, and regional ‚Äòcluster groups‚Äô or best practice clubs (these initiatives continue today under the auspices of Constructing Excellence). In March 1999, the UK government's Achieving Excellence in Construction initiative was launched to improve the performance - as industry clients - of central government departments, executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies. The initiative set out a route map with performance targets under four headings: management, measurement, standardisation and integration. Targets included the use of partnering and development of long-term relationships.Office of Government Commerce (2003) Achieving Excellence in Construction: Building on Success London: OGC Against this background, other government departments began to recognise the impact partnering could make and to promote the approach (e.g.: CABE/HM Treasury 2000, National Audit Office 2001).CABE/Treasury (2000) Better Public Buildings, London: Department of Culture, Media & Sport.National Audit Office (2001) Modernising Construction: a Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the NAO, London: HMSO. In July 2001, as successor to both the earlier Task Force and the CIB, the Strategic Forum for Construction was set up by ministers under the chairmanship of Sir John Egan. On 12 September 2002 it published Accelerating Change, a report on its first year of activity.Egan, J. (2002) Accelerating Change: Consultation Paper by Strategic Forum for Construction, London: HMSO. This report also underlined the potential importance of information technology in achieving greater integration, and set the tone for future UK government initiatives, notably the drive from 2010 onwards under chief construction adviser Paul Morrell to implement building information modelling on all UK public sector construction projects.UK Government Construction Strategy, Cabinet Office - http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/government- construction-strategy (accessed 30 January 2012) The Egan Report was one of the influences that fed into the early syllabus of the Interdisciplinary Design for the Built Environment programme at the University of Cambridge.

Boston's Eliot School in 1851The incident began on a Monday morning, March 7, 1859. Massachusetts law required that the Ten Commandments be recited in every classroom every morning. Bible passages were also required to be read aloud. On March 7, a teacher at the Eliot School in Boston, Miss Sophia Shepard, called on ten-year-old Thomas J. Whall to recite the Ten Commandments. Whall refused because he was Catholic and Shepard insisted that the Commandments be recited as written in the Protestant King James Bible.McGreevy, John T., Catholicism and American Freedom: A History, W. W. Norton & Company, 2004 The following Sunday at St. Mary's Parish Sunday School, Whall was among the several hundred boys who heard Father Bernardine Wiget, a Swiss-born JesuitFather Bernardine Wiget had fled Switzerland in 1847 during the Swiss civil war and an enthusiastic ultramontane, urge them not to recite Protestant prayers lest they fall into \\"infidelity and heresy.\\" The parishioners passed a resolution recommending that the children be taught not to be ashamed of their religion. Wiget also said he would \\"read out\\" from the pulpit the names of any boys who did recite the Protestant prayers at the Eliot School. On Monday, March 14 Shepard again called upon Whall and he again refused. The assistant principal, McLaurin F. Cook, was called. Saying \\"Here's a boy that refuses to repeat the Ten Commandments, and I will whip him till he yields if that takes the whole forenoon,\\" he beat Whall's hand with a rattan stick for 30 minutes until it was cut and bleeding. The principal then told all boys who intended to refuse to recite the King James version of the commandments to leave the school. One hundred boys left that day. Three hundred left the following day. Some boys reported to school with copies of the Vulgate Commandments that they were willing to recite, but they were refused admittance. The incident attracted intense national interest.\\"The Eliot School Difficulty at Boston Ended,\\" March 23, 1859, New York Times. Charges of assault and battery brought against Cook by the boy's father were dismissed on the grounds that religious instruction was a proper function of public school teachers. According to historian John McGreevy of the University of Notre Dame, the incident sparked the creation of Catholic parochial schools both in Boston and nationwide.History of the Catholic Church in the New England States, William Byrne, vol. 1, Hurd & Everts co., 1899, p. 128. In Boston, St Mary's Parish created a primary school to educate the boys who had withdrawn from the Eliot School. First called St. Mary's Institute, and later named in honor of Father Wiget, the school enrolled 1,150 boys in the 1859-60 school year. Thomas J. Whall Thomas J. Whall (Kilkenny, Ireland, March 31, 1848 \\\\- Reading, Massachusetts, March 14, 1911) was a Catholic student in Boston's Eliot school, who was whipped for refusing to read aloud the Ten Commandments in the King James version during the Eliot School rebellion. Whall's family attended St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Boston's North End, which held the city's densest concentration of Catholics, most living in the tenements near the wharf. On March 7, 1859 ten- year-old Thomas J. Whall refused to say the Ten Commandments as required by Massachusetts law for all public schools. Thomas stated that his father directed him not to recite the Protestant version. Whall's father was the school principal. Whall senior and members of the school committee attempted to reach a compromise. However, member Micah Dyer, a supporter of the Know Nothing Party insisted on strict adherence to state law. Whall and his father sued Cooke for use of excessive force. The court's ruling supported Cooke. The case received widespread attention. Seven Catholic schools sent testimonials of admiration, including the cathedral school of Covington, Kentucky. The cathedral school of Cincinnati, Ohio sent him a gold hunting-watch case and later a gold-lined goblet. However, as an adult, he had some difficulty finding employment.\\"Protestant Bible in Public School\\", The American Catholic Historical Researches, Vol. 2, M.I.J.

His most popular books are a series concerning The Sacred Diary of Adrian Plass which is a humorous, fictional satire of Christian life and which has sold over a million copies worldwide. Early life Plass was born in Tunbridge Wells. He worked as a residential child care worker with disadvantaged children for several years before suffering a breakdown and then embarking on a career as a writer. The first thing he ever wrote was \\"The Visit\\", a novella in which a fictional local Church in England is visited by Jesus (published in England originally as part of the short stories collection The Final Boundary, but as a standalone illustrated edition in 1999). The German translation of this novella, \\"Der Besuch\\", was made into a 40 minutes film in 2006. He recorded some of his experiences as a youth worker in the fictionalised Broken Windows, Broken Lives. Plass is an Anglican who has lived in Tunbridge Wells Kent and Hailsham East Sussex for most of his life. In 2010 he and his wife Bridget moved to Yorkshire, England to live in the Scargill House community. In 2012 they moved to County Durham, where they now live. Career Plass' most popular book The Sacred Diary of Adrian Plass Aged 37¬æ, the title of which parodies Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole books, is a humorous, fictional satire of Christian life. Plass followed this up with The Horizontal Epistles of Andromeda Veal in 1988 and The Theatrical Tapes of Leonard Thynn in 1989 to create the Sacred Diary Trilogy. He returned to the Sacred Diary proper with a sequel in 1996, called The Sacred Diary of Adrian Plass Christian Speaker Aged 45, in which as a prominent Christian speaker he tours Australia with his fictional wife Anne and son Gerald. A third in the series, The Sacred Diary of Adrian Plass, on Tour: Aged Far Too Much to Be Put on the Front Cover of a Book was published in 2004. By 2005 this series had sold over a million copies worldwide.Cover of Sacred Diary of Adrian Plass, Christian Speaker, aged 45, 2005 edition He travels around Britain and the world as a speaker. Some of his early talks and sketches are brought together in the books Cabbages for the King (1993) and Clearing Away the Rubbish (1988). From 2001 to 2006, Plass teamed up with Focus on the Family Radio Theatre in their original miniseries Father Gilbert Mysteries to provide the voice of the lead character, Father Louis Gilbert, a former London police detective who became an Anglican priest and now solves spiritual mysteries in the fictional Sussex village of Stonebridge. In 2006, Plass published his book Blind Spots in the Bible, in which he looks at forty passages in the Bible that have troubled him in the past. Reviewing this book, The Church Times said that he \\"treated the biblical text with kid gloves\\" so the investigation is personal application with \\"a great deal of autobiographical material (probably too much)\\", and concludes that \\"there is a great deal to mull over\\".

MAPU/OC; MAPU Worker-Peasant) was a leftist political party in Chile that was formed after a split of MAPU in March 1973. It claimed to represent the political legacy of Rodrigo Ambrosio, the principal founder of the original MAPU, who had deceased in May 1972. The MAPU/OC aimed at forming a \\"third proletarian party\\" in Chile, supporting cooperation with the Communist Party of Chile and the Socialist Party. It adhered to the more ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù, legalistic tendency of Unidad Popular, like the Communist Party and Radicals. It regarded the formation of the government of Salvador Allende as the principal victory for people and democracy and distanced itself from more extremist left-wing groups like MIR. It had two ministers in Allende's government (Fernando Flores and Juan Carlos Concha) and a number of other state functionaries were among its ranks. The MAPU/OC proclaimed that \\"the Chilean revolution was going through a national democratic phase\\" and established formal relations with the CPSU and other governing communist parties of the socialist bloc. It also supported the factions that sought a political compromise with the Chilean army and the Christian Democrats. After the 11 September 1973 coup, the party started to pursue clandestine activities. Its line was to form an alliance of all democratic forces that opposed the dictatorship. The party was more popular among the intellectuals (Tom√°s Mouli√°n, Jos√© Joaquin Bruner, Augusto Varas), university students (who in 1976 founded the Uni√≥n de J√≥venes Democr√°ticos) and peasants (the leaders of the Confederaci√≥n Unidad Obrero Campesina). At the beginning of the 1980s, the party experienced internal ideological conflicts (between ‚ÄúMarxists-Leninists‚Äù and ‚ÄúMarxists-Renovators‚Äù).

The film was designed as a star-vehicle for Robert Donat, representing his return to the screen after an absence of over three years during which he had been battling the chronic asthma which plagued his life and career.\\"Mr. Donat has a new Lease of Life\\" Sydney Morning Herald, 28 October 1954. Retrieved 27 July 2010 It was a prestige production which was generally respectfully, if not over-enthusiastically, received and gained Donat a nomination as 'Best British Actor' at the 1955 British Academy Film Awards.BAFTA Best British Actor nominations - 1954 Retrieved 27 July 2010 In common with a number of other Ealing films of the era, Lease of Life focuses on a specific English milieu - in this case a Yorkshire village and its nearby cathedral city - and examines the nuances, quirks and foibles of its day-to- day life. The film is unique in the Ealing canon in having religion as its dominant theme. Plot William Thorne (Robert Donat) is the vicar of the village of Hinton St. John, living with wife Vera (Kay Walsh) and daughter Susan (Adrienne Corri), an exceptionally gifted pianist. Although the focus of the local community, the Thornes live a life of having to struggle and scrimp to make ends meet financially. Vera is a typical clergy wife, having to sublimate her own needs and desires to the exigencies of her husband's career, as a result tending to live life vicariously through her daughter, whose musical gifts she is determined must not be wasted. On discovering that he has less than a year to live, Thorne reevaluates his own life and his parishioners and he finds himself happier than before, as he now feels able to speak completely honestly about his beliefs and does his best to demonstrate to his parishioners that religion is not a matter of unthinking adherence to a fixed set of rules, but of freedom to act according to one's conscience. However some of his pronouncements are willfully misunderstood and deemed provocative and controversial. There also remains the worry about how to secure the necessary funds to pay for Susan's tuition at a music college, and fate happens to put temptation in the way. Cast * Robert Donat as Rev.

Though she was a stalwart character doyenne, prominent in every arena of the theatre arts in Canada, she is best remembered for her roles as Raxl, Daughter of the Priestess of the Serpent on Strange Paradise (1969-70), and as Ma Cobb in Deranged (1975). Early life and career Cosette Lee began acting at a very young age; she grew up in the midst of a decided theatrical atmosphere at home. Born Mabel Cosette LeGassicke, she stated in a 1966 interview that her ancestors were of Normandy French stock. Cosette recalled: \\"My mother gave me the name Cosette, thinking it couldn't be shortened. My grandmother once remarked I looked 'cosy' in my crib, and I've been Cosy ever since. It sounds like a fan dancer.\\" (Cosette was often billed as Cosy Lee in her earlier years.) She further stated: \\"My first professional appearance was with the Von Glazer Players, a Toronto stock company, in Peter Pan. I was Toodles, the leader of the gang of children, and it was at the Uptown Theatre.\\" This was apparently sometime around 1916-19 (she was vague about the date in interviews).\\"Cosette Lee: A 'Character' and her career, from Peter Pan to television,\\" CBC television network information services press release, typescript dated 21 January 1966, Cosette Lee Collection, Toronto Public Library Her mother, a milliner, made hats for some of the celebrated actresses of the World War I period in Toronto. Her father acted in \\"minstrel\\" shows at the YMCA, and also appeared in church theatricals. Asked when she had known she was going to be an actress, Cosette cited a family atmosphere in which she was encouraged to do little performances at home for the entertainment of the adults: \\"They encouraged me. They knew I loved it. My aunt used to say: 'Cosy, tell us about your trip to New York,' and I'd put on my father's hat and my mother's shoes and carry a briefcase for a valise, and I'd go on and on about my New York trip. I was three or four and had never been to New York.\\"\\"... to the Royal Family,\\" Toronto Globe and Mail, 27 June 1972 After Peter Pan, the young Cosy continued to participate in other productions. She took a secretarial course as a young woman and graduated from it, but acting work remained steady and she remained in the theatre. Her mother had taught her to sew and she often made her own costumes. Besides plays, she also had a career as a \\"character elocutionist,\\" performing mostly comic monologues in a style that in some ways anticipates the stand-up comedy boom of the present era.\\"TV star lives contented life in Willowdale,\\" The Enterprise (Willowdale, Ontario), 15 November 1967, page 4. This was the story as Cosette told it in a 1966 interview, and was one that is found in other interviews she gave over the course of the final decade of her life. In a 1963 interview, she gave a less rosy-coloured image of her early life: \\"Born Cosette Le Gassicke, the oldest of five daughters, Miss Lee had no encouragement from her parents in her acting aspirations. Too precarious a living, they said; take a business course. She took one, and loathed it. \\"[Cosette remembered:] 'Then at 16 I got a part in \\"The Trial of Mary Duggan\\" at the Grand Opera House. And I knew I could not turn back.' \\"From 16 to 22 she put in an apprenticeship in the U. S., learning 'the craft' with people like Wallace Ford, Leo Carillo, Walter Kingsford, Spring Byington. They were good years. \\"[Cosette continued:]'Then, in 1932, I got a telegram as I was reading for a part in New York to say that the clothing business my father had worked for had gone under, and I was needed back home. Depression was sinking showbusiness in Toronto; the stock companies like the Grand Opera, the Empire, the Vaughan Glaser and the Cameron Mathews, were folding. I had to do something, and there seemed nothing to do.'\\" It seems to have been at this time that she worked as a puppeteer, among other jobs. In this interview, Cosette gave the date 1936 for the date of her first radio play, organized by Win Barron. This was described as a half-hour murder mystery titled Vitrol, presumably a serial. It was at this time that the actress adopted the professional name of Cosette Lee.\\"Crest Theatre Regular in Theatre 40 years,\\"by David Cobb, Toronto Star, 8 January 1963. I am very much indebted to Curt Ladnier for his kindness in sharing this valuable reference. Vitrol, and other productions which followed, was produced on radio station CFCH (which subsequently became the CBC). Cosette remembered: \\"... we all sat around a squat little microphone placed in the centre of a table in a very small room, and each in turn would speak into the obect. We also did our own sound effects, and at the appropriate moment, would scramble from our chairs, race to a corner of the room near the controls, and rattle some cellophane to imitate the sound of fire, or use some other elementary sort of approach. It was fun, and I think that the young people now are missing a lot.\\" The work in radio kept her busy, and included appearances in a Canadian radio production of the popular comic strip Buck Rogers, as well as a morning show, Good morning Breakfast Club. These were in the 1930s.Cosette continued to work occasionally in radio in her later career. She can be heard in a 1968 radio adaptation of the W. W. Jacobs tale \\"The Monkey's Paw\\" on CBC Mystery Theatre, a series which can be heard via streaming or download on various websites. Cosette showed a very different side of her craftsmanship in her role as the Mother in this short play. I appreciate Curt Ladnier's kindness in sharing this reference with me. It was in the 1940s that her stage career really took off. Favorite roles she mentioned frequently in interviews included Madam Arcati in Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit (she played in at least four different productions of it), Madam Alvarez in Gigi, Lady Bracknell in Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, and the Bernard Shaw drama, Arms and the ManUnidentified newspaper clipping \\"Loves playing 'Maggie Hatch,' says actress Cosette Lee,\\" dated 7 Dec. 1967, in Cosette Lee Scrapbook, pages 200-201, Cosette Lee Collection, Toronto Public Library. Cosette created a one woman show in the early 1950s. It was a success, and she presented it three years in a row. In 1963 Cosette recalled: People asked me, how could I be so egotistical to think I could do a whole two-hour show myself? But I admired Ruth Draper tremendously, and it was a great challenge. And it helped me improve my craft. The other day, I had an argument with an actor, who wanted to know how to play a part. All the books he'd read, he said, claimed it wasn't right, the way he was doing it. Does it FEEL right, I asked him. Well, yes, he said. Then that's the way to do it, I told him. We need more confidence in the acting profession! more American get-up-and-go.\\"\\"Crest Theatre Regular in Theatre 40 years,\\" by David Cobb, Toronto Star 8 January 1963.  The 1950s and 1960s: Work in television and film  In 1960, Cosette appeared opposite future Strange Paradise co-stars Jack Creley and Dawn Greenhalgh in a play, Tunnel of Love, performed at the Lansdowne Theatre in Toronto. A reviewer commented: \\"Cosette Lee... has just the trick of making bricks with very little straw.\\" (Jack Creley, who went on to portray the suavely villainous Laslo Thaxton on Strange Paradise, was thus described: \\"Mr. Creley offers a model of intense comedy technique. No gag, or even suspicion of a gag, slips by the mobile puckered Creley countenance, while the lithe Creley form describes endlessly the tensions of the amateur deceiver.\\")Toronto Globe and Mail review, clipping from Cosette Lee's scrapbooks preserved in her Collection at the Toronto National Library. Her scrapbooks, as preserved in the Cosette Lee Collection in the Toronto Public Library, reveal active television work beginning in 1955 and continuing down until the mid 1970s. She had considerable work acting in commercials. Early drama appearances in the medium included Forever Galatea (1955), The Runaways (1958), Bousille and the Just (1962), Pearl Tolliver in Scarlett Hll (1963) an early Canadian soap opera, A Train of Murder (1964‚Äì65), and A Game Like Only a Game (1965). A prominent television role for her was on 2 March 1965 in an episode of CBC- TV's \\"Eye Opener\\", \\"The Trial of Joseph Brodsky\\". She also appeared in a brief but memorable character role as a garrulous landlady in the UK-Canadian co- production Seaway (also 1965).Cosette Lee Collection, Inventory, and notes by S. R. Shutt from materials housed in the Cosette Lee collection in Toronto. The latter show was rerun on one of the vintage television channels in Australia in 2014. She achieved greater national renown among television viewers across the country with her regular role was as Maggie Hatch in the Hatch's Mill (1966‚Äì67). In this series, she played opposite Sylvia Feigel, a young Canadian actress who went on to portray Holly on Strange Paradise. Perhaps Cosette's best-remembered television role was in the 1969-70 television show Strange Paradise. Unlike her other television work, Strange Paradise was syndicated in the US and in subsequent repeat markets throughout the 1970s-1980s and beyond, with episodes available on YouTube since around 2009. It has become firmly established as a \\"cult\\" television series. Cosette's character was featured on the cover of a novel devoted to her, Raxl, Voodoo Priestess (1970), by Dorothy Daniels.Book held in the personal library of S. R. Shutt. Scans of the cover are widely featured on various blogs and websites. Working conditions on the occult-themed serial were at times harsh and stressful, particularly in the early months. In a newspaper article from the autumn of 1969, the reporter recorded the following: \\"You should have been here during the first few weeks in August,\\" one of the actors said. \\"It was horrendous. They talked about taping eight episodes a week, but technicians, Ottawa people, had never done anything like this before. Breakdowns happened all over the place. We got three done the first week. \\"We were working a 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. day. Temperatures in the studio reached 120 degrees and we had to faint to get some air conditioning. Morale was terrible.\\"Sid Adilman, \\"TV's Colin Fox and Strange Paradise, \\" Toronto Telegram, 29 Nov. 1969 Despite the difficulties, Cosette claimed to have happy memories when she spoke of working on the serial a couple of years later. In a 1972 interview she recalled : \\"We camped it up at rehearsals, which nearly gave the director heart failure. I like to kid and I expect others to kid.

The Jewish Museum Frankfurt am Main is the oldest independent Jewish Museum in Germany. It was opened by Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on 9 November 1988, the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht. . The Jewish Museum collects, preserves and communicates the nine-hundred-year-old Jewish history and culture of the City of Frankfurt from a European perspective. It has a permanent exhibition at two venues: the Museum Judengasse at Battonstra√üe 47 focuses on the theme of the history and culture of Jews in Frankfurt during the early modern period; the Jewish Museum in the Rothschildpalais at Untermainkai 14/15 presents Jewish history and culture since 1800. This museum has been closed for refurbishment and expansion since 20 July 2015. It is scheduled to re-open in 2019. The focus of the collection is on the areas ceremonial culture, fine arts and family history. The museum has extensive holdings related to the Rothschild family and the Anne Frank family which will be presented in the new permanent exhibition. The Ludwig Meidner Archive is responsible for the estates of the artists Ludwig Meidner, Jacob Steinhardt, Henry Gowa and others.Art Collection of the Jewish Museum In addition, the museum has an extensive library as well as a document and photograph collection related to German-Jewish history and culture. History At the opening in 1988. A museum of Jewish antiquities existed in Frankfurt even before the foundation of today's museum. It was opened in 1922 and was one of the first of its kind in Germany, showing mainly Jewish cult items. In 1938 the museum was destroyed by the National Socialists; only a few of the objects have been preserved in Frankfurt. After the Second World War, former Jewish Frankfurt citizens who had emigrated to London proposed that a commission be set up to carry out research on the history of Frankfurt's Jews. Later, plans were conceived to found a Jewish Museum, support by the city councillor, Hilmar Hoffmann. In 1988 that museum opened in two classical villas on the Untermainkai, across the Main from the Schaumainkai. The villa at no. 14 was built for the banker Simon Moritz von Bethmann, and the one at no. 15 for Joseph Isaak Speyer. No. 14 was acquired by Mayer Carl von Rothschild in 1846, and became known as the Rothschild Palace. Both buildings were acquired by the city of Frankfurt in 1928. After the Second World War they served as the main site of the municipal and university library, and later as an outpost of the Historical Museum. From 1988 to 2006, Georg Heuberger was the director of the museum. From 2015 - 2018 the building will undergo fundamental reconstruction work and an extension will be added. The museum is part of the Museumsufer. Museum Judengasse The Museum Judengasse. In 1987 the foundations of 19 houses on what used to be called the Judengasse were discovered during construction work on an administrative building. The Frankfurt Judengasse was the first Jewish ghetto in Europe. It was founded in 1460 and developed into an important European Jewish cultural centre. The archaeological finds gave rise to a controversial debate as to how these witnesses of Jewish history in Frankfurt should be handled. The conflict resulted in a compromise: five of the unearthed house foundations were dismantled and reconstructed at the cellar level of the new administration building. In 1992 the Museum Judengasse was then opened among these ruins, as it were. The presentation there centres on the history and culture of Frankfurt's Jews from the Middle Ages to Jewish Emancipation. The Museum Judengasse borders both on a memorial site for the Frankfurt Jews murdered during the National Socialist era and on the second oldest Jewish cemetery in Germany. In 2016 the museum was reopened after reconstruction with a re- designed exhibition. To commemorate the 650th anniversary of the Golden Bull of 1356, four museums in Frankfurt organised an exhibition called Die Kaisermacher (\\"The Emperor-Makers\\") from 2006 to 2007. The Museum Judengasse contributed archaeological findings, documenting in particular the role played by the Jews of Frankfurt as the Emperor's servi camerae regis.Stadtgeschichte: Auf den Spuren der Kaisermacher Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 28 September 2006.

Names Nazim was active in Turkish and Arabic language contexts. His name was therefore transliterated into English in various ways: Nazim Qibrisi ), indicating his homeland of Cyprus (), and Muhammad Nazim Adil al-Qubrusi al-Haqqani an-Naqshbandi (). His name al-Haqqani is an honorific name granted by his Sufi teacher Abdullah Fa'izi ad-Daghestani. He has no connection with the Islamic insurgent group known as the Haqqani network. Early life He moved to Istanbul, Turkey, in 1940 to study chemical engineering at Istanbul University. He would later state, \\"I felt no attraction to modern science; my heart was always drawn to the spiritual sciences.\\"'The Naqshbandi Sufi Way' by Hisham Kabbani. KAZI Publications, 1995. Biography Studies in Sharia' and Sufism =In Turkey= In Istanbul, Nazim studied Classical Arabic and Islamic Jurisprudence (fiqh) under Jamal al-Din al-Alsuni (d. 1955 CE/1375 AH) and received an ijaza (permission to teach) in these subjects from him. He was initiated in Naqshbandi Sufism by Sulayman Arzarumi (d. 1948 CE/1368 AH), who eventually directed him to Damascus, Syria, to continue his studies with his destined sheikh. He left Istanbul and arrived in Syria in 1944. =In Syria= In Syria, Nazim continued his sharia studies in Aleppo, Hama, and Homs. In Homs, he studied at the madrasa adjoining the burial shrine and mosque of Muhammad's companion, Khalid ibn al-Walid. There, he received further ijazas in Hanafi jurisprudence (fiqh) from Muhammad 'Ali' Ayoun al-Soud and Abdul Jalil Murad. Following the end of the unrest in the region due to World War II, Nazim was able to enter Damascus in 1945. There, he met Abdullah Fa'izi ad-Daghestani, and they exchanged the Sufi oath of mutual allegiance (bay'ah). He trained him well in naqshbandi Sufi path. Nazim would consider Abdullah as his primary spiritual director (murshid) until the latter's death in 1973. Islamic Missionary Activity Nazim returned to Cyprus and began Islamic missionary activity. Whilst there, he came into conflict with the Kemalist governing body of the Turkish community of the island, which in accordance with Kemalist ideology was actively striving ti de-Islamize the society. The government had enacted laws forbidding the public performance of the Islamic call to prayer (adhan) in its traditional Arabic form. Regardless, Nazim continued to do so. The conflict was resolved with the coming to power of Adnan Menderes in Turkey, whose government chose a more tolerant approach to Islamic traditions. Nazim took up residence in Damascus in 1952 to continue his studies with Abdullah, though he continued to spend three months or more each year in his native Cyprus. =International mission= Shaykh Kabbani (left) at an Islamic conference in 1996. Following the death of Abdullah Fa'izi ad-Daghestani in 1973, Nazim was made his spiritual successor. In 1974, he began to visit Western Europe, traveling every year to London, England, for the month of Ramadan. He gained a large following of spiritual seekers from Western Europe and North America, many of whom converted to Islam after encountering his teaching. From 1980, his lectures on Islam and Sufism were published in English and other European languages. Nazim's transnational appeal was facilitated by his ability to speak English, Turkish, Arabic, and Greek. In 1991, Nazim visited the United States for the first time at the invitation of his son-in-law and representative Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Kabbani. At that time, he made the first of four nationwide tours. In 1997, Nazim visited Daghestan, the childhood home of his primary Sufi sheikh, Abdullah Fa'izi ad- Daghestani. He also made several visits to Uzbekistan where he made pilgrimage to the tomb of the eponymous founder of the Naqshbandi Order, Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari. In 1998, Nazim was the guest of honor at the Second International Islamic Unity Conference, held in Washington, D.C. Later in the same year, he traveled to South Africa, visiting Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. Notable Followers Among his students is the British teacher of spirituality, John G. Bennett.John G.

Martti (Martin) Rautanen (10 November 1845 Tikopis (), Ingria ‚Äì 19 October 1926 Olukonda, Namibia) was the pioneer of the Finnish Mission in Ovamboland, Namibia. Childhood and education Rautanen was born in a poor Finnish family in Ingria near St. Peterburg, Russia. Rautanen's family lived in the village of Tikanpes√§ in the parish of Novasolkka () in the Yamburgsky Uyezd of Saint Petersburg Governorate. The family originated from Joroinen in the province of Savo in Eastern Finland, but had moved to Ingria. Martti Rautanen considered himself a Russian as he was born and living in Russia. Encouraged by the pastor of his church and his mother, Martti Rautanen left Ingria in 1863 for Helsinki to study at the preparatory school for missionaries organized by the Finnish Missionary Society. Missionary activities Rautanen departed from Finland with four colleagues on 24 June 1868 towards Ovamboland in present-day Namibia. From Walvis Bay they travelled via Hereroland where they arrived in April 1869 and spent there over a year. Finally, they reached Ovamboland in July 1870. The Finnish missionaries managed to start work primarily in the southeastern territory of the Ondonga tribe. Rautanen worked in Ovamboland over 50 years acting as the director of a missionary station established in Olukonda in 1880, translating the Bible, and very patiently educating the local populations. The first local people to become pastors emerged in 1925. Literary work Rautanen's literary work consisted of translation of hymns and the publication of a hymnal in 1892 in Ndonga. Rautanen also wrote poems which were used as texts for new hymns in Ovamboland. Rautanen started translating the Bible already in 1885. The New Testament was published in 1903, but it took until 1920 before the whole Old Testament was translated and it was not printed until 1954. Rautanen's 'testament' for the Ovamboland people was a selection of texts published posthumously with the title Travel Rod in 1934. Scientific contributions Rautanen was also active in the study of ethnography. He respected and gave great value to the indigenous culture. His ethnographic collection is now deposited in the National Museum of Finland. Rautanen's contribution to scientific knowledge concerning Ovamboland is also considerable. He made meteorological observations and collected plants. His interest in plants followed on the 1885‚Äì86 visit by the Swiss botanist Hans Schinz; Rautanen was inspired and became an enthusiastic collector of plants and ethnographic material, collections which were later assimilated by museums in Finland, Germany and South Africa. In turn Schinz was impressed by Rautanen and named the tree Ricinodendron rautanenii after him, while the German botanist and authority on Lythraceae, Bernhard Koehne, commemorated him in Nesaea rautanenii. Nakambale Shortly prior to his death, Rautanen received an honorary doctorate in theology at the University of Helsinki. The local people in Ovamboland called him Nakambale ‚Äì \\"the one who wears the hat\\". He loved to wear a skullcap, which for the locals resembled a small basket ‚Äì okambale. His nickname was written on his tombstone. Rautanen is a respected person in present-day Namibia as well. Rautanen married Frieda Kleinschmidt in 1872. She was daughter to a German missionary Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt. The couple had nine children, many of whom deceased due to malaria at an early age.

The extinct submerged volcano MƒÅhukona, off shore and to the south, is named for this area. The settlement was once the terminus of the Hawaiian Railroad. History MƒÅhukona was a traditional land division (ahupuaa) that extended from a bay to the slopes of Kohala mountain. Much was owned by Princess Ruth Keelik≈çlani at one time. The name means \\"false harbor\\" in the Hawaiian language. Lapakahi State Historical Park is just to the south.Lapakahi State Historical Park entry on Hawaii State Park web site The harbor is located at just off of Akoni Pule Highway, Hawaii Route 270. While Samuel Gardner Wilder was minister of the interior, he secured a charter for a railroad company in 1880. The first sugarcane plantation in the Kohala district was started by Elias Bond in 1863, but transportation proved difficult. Wilder's idea was to transport sugarcane from sugarcane plantations on the wet windward side of Kohala to MƒÅhukona where ships could land. Wilder already ran a steamship company, so built a pier at the MƒÅhukona harbor. Samuel Parker planned a railroad from the east coast to the port of Hilo, but was unable to fund the project. Work was begun in 1881, the first track opened in 1882, and by 1883 had reached about to the plantation at Niulii, . There it met the barrier of Polol≈´ Valley. Hawaiian Railroad near MƒÅhukona built in 1882 Wilder named the first locomotive Kinau, after his wife. He had plans to extend his railroad to Hilo, but that would not happen until after his death, by the Hawaii Consolidated Railway. The two would never be connected as dreamed by Wilder. In 1897 the railroad reincorporated as the Hawaii Railway Company, Ltd., and was bought out by the sugar companies in 1899. A sugar mill was built on the north side of the bay, and its remains still stand. A larger wharf was built in 1911 by the Territory of Hawaii that was immediately destroyed by a storm, and rebuilt again. In 1913 it was the fourth busiest port in the islands, but only had 13 vessels enter. The first lighthouse was built in 1889 just to the south of the bay. In 1915 it was replaced by a concrete pyramid tall. By 1937, the Kohala Sugar Company had considated all the business into the mill at MƒÅhukona, and became Mahukona Terminals Ltd. In 1941 the port was forced to close for World War II. On October 29, 1945 the railroad shut down. The town which once consisted of about 40 families, was abandoned in the 1950s. In 1956 the harbor was closed. The bay is now the site of a park of Hawaii County. Although called MƒÅhukona Beach Park, the shoreline is rocky and there is no sandy beach. Fishing, snorkeling, picnic areas, and camping are available. In the 1990s a developer obtained permits to build a golf course and resort in the area. The land- holding company was renamed the Kohala Preserve Conservation Trust, LLC, but encountered opposition from residents in the area. A historic song about MƒÅhukona, translated as \\"sugar boiler\\" credited to book by Edward Kamakau Likalani (1852‚Äì1917). was recently recorded. includes audio clip of song, track 14 References External links * * Category:Ghost towns in Hawaii Category:Geography of Hawaii (island) Category:Bays of Hawaii (island) Category:Beaches of Hawaii (island) ","title":"Mahukona Light"},{"id":"28171810","text":"Blu O'Carroll Cassidy, Propionic Acidaemia patient, born 1995.

Highly susceptible to infections and living with brittle bones, she is a full-time wheelchair user and has never attended school. As a result of her condition she suffered brain damage. The action sought to require the HSE to provide her with appropriate education and support therapies and support services in accordance with her constitutional rights. The lawsuit also attempted to declare that the defendant's failure to provide her with such therapies and supports was to deprive her of her constitutional rights. In May 2010, \\"the President of the High Court Mr Justice Nicholas Kearns approved the settlement of Blu's action against the State in relation to her education needs. The State defendants had agreed to provide a tutor for Blu for 20 hours per week, as well as other educational supports. There would also be a payment of ‚Ç¨25,000 for past expenses.\\" External links * http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0520/1224270711835.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20100522132748/http://www.galwaynews.ie/12989-city- teen-rare-illness-wins-action-against-state Category:People from County Galway Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Blu O'Carroll Cassidy"},{"id":"28171816","text":"G√°bor J.

The area was a British military camp or cantonment and the site of the 1879 Siege of the Sherpur Cantonment in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. The cemetery houses memorials and graves for many fallen western soldiers who fought in various conflicts throughout the history of Kabul. It is managed by an Afghan father and son. They maintain grounds and supervise visitors. The cemetery is enclosed in a tall, fortified wall, which is seemingly unassuming from the exterior. There are various local terms to describe the cemetery. For instance, it is also called Kabre Gora, or \\"graveyard of foreigners\\" by locals. While some people call it ‚ÄúForever England\\", others call it Sherpur Cantonment. The interesting part about the cemetery is that it‚Äôs like a garden inside, so green and beautiful. The garden is now known as the Christian cemetery officially and contains diplomats, adventurers, merchants, explorers, and aid workers from all over the world. There is also a metal sign on the wall of the bend where it is written the \\"British Cemetery\\". Furthermore, the wall is so high that one cannot see either inside or outside of the cemetery through the wall. The garden inside is filled with rose bushes and trees. There are three black stone plaques that are placed side-by-side on the cemetery's southern wall. Also, there is an engraved list of those spread across the stones who were killed in the conflict of the past eight years.The mentioned sentences contains the different features and characteristics of this so-called forever England or Christian cemetery. Historical background Besides having dead bodies from the second Anglo-Afghan War, there can be found graves dating back to that of 1842 defeat in this cemetery. It dates to over 150 years and contains a strong wooden door. The cemetery was created in the 19th Century, during Britain's past war in Afghanistan where more than 160 soldiers from that period are thought to be buried here. So, they first took the city of Kabul in 1839 with little trouble. It was actually a straight land-grab to stop Russia getting in first.Christian Cemetery in Kabul Survives Through Toughest Periods of Afghan History However, an Afghan uprising and rebellion soon began and, two years later, the British were forced out in a now well-chronicled disaster. Nearly the entire Kabul garrison of 16,000 British and Indian troops, their families and servants, were slaughtered by Afghan forces as they tried to retreat. Then, British troops marched back in the same year, razing much of Kabul to the ground in revenge. So basically, the British took Kabul again, but the war lasted several more years and they were back again in 1919. Later, Britain signed a treaty accepting its empire would never stretch beyond the Khyber Pass and granting the Afghans their independence. Protection of cemetery The caretaker of the cemetery for over 30 years was an Afghan man called Rahimullah. He was a shepherd and the cemetery grass served as prime grazing for his animals. However, he passed away in 2010, but he advised his son on maintaining the importance of the landmark. Therefore, after his death, Rahimullah's son called Abdul Sami has been tending to the cemetery. Like his father, Abdul Sami has also dedicated his whole life to the cemetery. He told to the Herald that \\"This place is very nearly not here.\\" He credits his father's devotion, even during the dangerous Taliban rule, for the fact that the cemetery is still standing. Other characteristics of this cemetery is that it is one of the few foreign historical and Christian landmarks that have survived Taliban rule. The earliest graves that can be found lying within the cemetery can be traced back to 1879 and foreigners of all backgrounds have been laid to rest within its compounds. The cemetery serves as a reminder of the history of Afghanistan and the history of an interconnected world. Best-known residents of the graveyard Aurel Stein, a British-Hungarian archaeologist, and Henning Christensen, a famous Danish explorer, both died in the 1940s and are buried here in Kabir Gora. There is another grave here with Russian scriptAfghanistan's 'graveyard of foreigners' which turns out to be a Kazakh who fled to Kabul in the aftermath of Russia's 1917 Bolshevik revolution. Fundraising for the graveyard The cemetery is not formally recognized by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and is still owned by the city of Kabul. However, Col Simon Diggins, the British defence attach√© who coordinates fundraising for the cemetery, described it as a \\"labour of love\\" He mentions: \\"It's very important to us. \\"It would be great to think that in ten years‚Äô time, families might be able to come out here and see it and enjoy the tranquility.‚Äù (D.S.

It is a disused quarry, from which Whin Sill stone was formerly excavated. It lies just south of the River Tees, opposite the village of Middleton-in-Teesdale on the river's northern bank. Since mineral working ceased, the quarry has been re-colonised by a variety of vegetation types. On the quarry floor, natural seepage has given rise to areas of open water, which grade into a variety of soligenous mire and fen vegetation types. Where a skeletal soil layer has developed on the quarry floor and spoil heaps, patches of grassland occur, with species characteristic of base-rich soils, such as quaking grass, Briza media, and limestone bedstraw, Galium sterneri. On shallow slopes, this gives way to a neutral grassland characterised by false oat-grass, Arrhenatherum elatius, and Yorkshire fog, Holcus lanatus. Above the quarry, this is replaced by acid grassland, in which wavy hair-grass, Deschampsia flexuosa, is dominant. The quarry supports a moth fauna which includes at least two species, the northern rustic (Standfussiana lucernea) and the anomalous wainscot (Stilbia anomala) which are rare in north-east England.

Incorporated in 1947, performances were held in other facilities at first, including the old Post Theater and, beginning in 1957, the Riverside Playhouse. The present facility was opened in 1967. In 1972, a three story addition was made, adjoining to the backstage area of the main theatre. This space was used for set construction, rehearsals, the costume shop, and offices for the continued upkeep of the theatre. The lower levels of the theatre, previously used as rehearsal space, were converted into a studio theatre in 1979. It was named for long-time volunteer Firth J. Chew in 1989. Currently, it is used as a black box theatre, and many of the smaller or experimental productions take place there. In 2013, the Main Stage Women's restroom was expanded and a new Donor Lounge & Meeting Room was added onto the building. In addition, Civic used to be home to the Box and Hat Players, a performance troupe devoted to spreading a love of musical theatre to community members of all ages. Spokane Children's Theatre also used Civic's stage at one time. Education Civic serves as a resource for local high school and college theatre departments. It also operates a theatre school - - for all ages. Civic provides a variety of workshops in acting, directing, voice, dance, stage combat and technical theatre. The Academy reaches approximately 700 students per year, 100 of them taking more than one class. The fall, winter and spring quarters run eight weeks beginning in late September, late January, and mid- April. Each class meets one day a week. The Academy also runs summer camps for those going into K-12, where students come each weekday during the morning or the afternoon. The grade school summer program uses a play-in-a-week format, rendering familiar stories like The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Legend of Zelda, Star Wars and The Chronicles of Narnia into simple and fun performances. For the 7-12th grade students, there are three classes throughout the summer: a two-week Musical Theatre camp, a two-week Drama camp, and a 3-4 week Musical Performance camp. In Summer 2011 the Musical Performance camp for the students entering grades 7-12 was changed. It was originally a program focused on finding the individual talents of each actor involved and bringing them together into a fun, original musical. The program became more like a summer stock performance, where the students have 3‚Äì4 weeks of rehearsals in which to fully memorize their lines, choreography, and music. The success of their 2011 production of Footloose cemented the change in the program. Each year, there are Theatre Intensives for school age students to perform. The Intensive format includes a couple weeks of rehearsal each day culminating in a ticketed performance. The proceeds from the performance go toward the Scholarship Fund. Spokane Civic Theatre's Academy program also runs a scholarship program for the many students in the community who possess a love of theatre without the ability to fund a whole week at camp. Thanks to the generous contributions from the community, many scholarships have been provided to qualifying families with the over $15,000 raised per season. The community's need for scholarship has increased from approximately 10% to 30%. Community Involvement Spokane Civic Theatre has approximately 500 volunteers who serve as actors, backstage crews, front of house, house managers, and board members.Spokane Civic Theatre Website - Volunteer They contribute an estimated 90,000 hours every year. Volunteers return to Civic time and time again, supporting the theatre's endeavors. In addition to volunteering their time, the Spokane community has given incredible amounts in the form of donations that support the theatre and its mission. Civic provides over 600 Main Stage tickets to help various other community organizations and individuals with their auctions and fundraisers. Civic also presents benefit performance nights for other not-for-profit groups, reaching 4,500-6,000 individuals. Many of these individuals have never been to Civic or a live stage production before. In the fall of 2011, Civic launched the Shakespeare in Schools community outreach program. The program is free for Middle and High School students and teachers and is taught by Civic's Director of Education. Shakespeare in Schools this 2013-14 season has reached approximately 750 students and 16 teachers at 7 schools. During the fall of 2013, the Academy tested a pilot program called Creative Dramatics with the focus on Elementary school students/teachers; it received an enormous response (serving approximately 350 students, 14 teachers, and 9 schools) and will become a full program, like the Shakespeare in Schools. For the first time in March 2014, Civic and the Spokane Symphony joined forces to present a two evening performance of the theatre's earlier hit production of Les Mis√©rables live at the Martin Woldson Theatre at the Fox. The joint fundraiser for the three community organizations exceeded their expectations. Awards Spokane Civic Theatre holds approximately 150 local, state, regional, and national awards for community theatre from the Inlander's Spokie awards to the American Association of Community Theatres' (AACT) Festival. At the 2011 AACTFest,2011 AACTFest Spokane Civic Theatre's production of The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee received two awards and three nominations. The awards were for Lacey Bohnet as Best Supporting Actress and Nancy Vancil for Best Musical Accompaniment. Nominations were in the areas of Best Lighting Design, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Ensemble. Civic has also been recognized by the city of Spokane, most recently in 2007, when then Technical Director Peter Hardie was recognized for continued artistic excellence, and Resident Director Troy Nickerson for volunteering abundant talent and resources to help raise funds for many Spokane area non-profits.Spokane Arts Awards A full list of awards received by Spokane Civic Theatre can be viewed on the Awards page of Spokane Civic Theatre's website.

It stands on a cliff top overlooking Brean Down and the mouth of the River Axe. The partially ruined church consists of a tower, chancel and a roofless nave. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust, although the roofed portion is still used for services occasionally. Location Uphill Cliff looking North East The partially ruined church, on the edge of Weston- super-Mare, sits on a cliff top the southern slope of which and the quarry at its western end form the Uphill Cliff Site of Special Scientific Interest, notable for its species-rich calcareous grassland. It consists of grassland and rock-face situated on Carboniferous Limestone. Steeper banks and knolls in the grassland have a flora which includes orchids, Somerset Hair Grass (Koeleria vallesiana), and Honewort, (Trinia glauca) and the Goldilocks Aster (Galatella linosyris) along with several species of butterfly and Weevil (Curculionoidea). The church overlooks Weston Bay, Brean Down and the mouth of the River Axe which was used as a port in Roman times, probably for the export of lead from the Mendip Hills. The nearby tower on the hill is the remains of an 18th-century windmill. History and architecture The cliff beneath the church contained caves which contained evidence of occupation since the Stone Age. The caves have since been quarried away and the artefacts removed to museums. During the Roman period a Romano-British temple was erected on the site. Some remains of this have been found beneath the floor of the open nave. There is evidence of a wooden church on the site around 700 AD during the Anglo-Saxon era, and the port at Uphill may have been a centre for pilgrims travelling to Glastonbury Abbey. The church became the responsibility of the abbot of the monastery dedicated to St Michael, which was on Steep Holm island in the Bristol Channel. The current Norman stone building has a central three- stage tower, chancel and unroofed nave. The building was remodelled in the late Middle Ages and restored in 1846 by Thomas Knytton of Uphill Castle. The porch was rebuilt in 1904, although the church had been partly in ruins since the building of a new parish church in 1844. The nave no longer has a roof. There are three carved sundials, one on the east side of a plain tympanum set over a blocked door in the south wall and one to the west of the tympanum. The third sundial, on the window head on the south face of the tower, predates the Norman Conquest and may be Saxo-Norman. Current use It is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. Occasional services are held in the still- roofed chancel of the church. Bell ringing can also sometimes be observed in this tiny church.

It is designated by Cadw as a Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches. History The nave is thought to date from the 13th century, while the chancel was added during the following century. The tower was built at a later date. At the beginning of the 19th century, the church was described as being \\"in extreme disrepair\\". In 1851 the Cambrian Archaeological Association decided that it should be restored, the architect David Brandon was appointed to do the work. The present windows were added as part of this restoration, but many of the internal features were preserved. This restoration was \\"intended to be a model for future church restorations\\". The church has no recorded dedication. The church was vested with the charity the Friends of Friendless Churches in 2000, who hold a 999-year lease with effect from 17 December 2000. The charity has introduced into the church a set of stalls originally designed by W. D. Caroe for St David's Church, Exeter. Architecture The interior of Hodgeston church The church is constructed in local limestone with slate roofs. Its plan consists of a nave with a south porch, a chancel, and a west tower. The chancel has a roof at a higher level, and is described as being \\"rather large in proportion to the rest of the church\\". The massive tower was \\"unusually slender\\" for the era, and is in four stages. On the north face of the tower is a stair turret. In its lowest stage is a 19th-century double west window over the remains of a former narrow window. There are double round-headed bell openings in the top stage, and at the summit of the tower is a parapet supported by corbels. In the north wall of the nave is a blocked doorway. The chancel measures by . It has a cornice decorated with ballflowers. Along its south wall is a bench, a double piscina dating from the 14th century, and a triple sedilia; these are decorated with ballflowers, crockets and leaf finials. The carving is of high quality, and was probably paid for by Henry de Gower, Bishop of St David's. The chancel is floored with encaustic tiles. The restored east window is in Decorated Gothic style; the other windows in the chancel are in simpler style. The nave measures about by and it contains a Norman font. The ground floor of the tower is used as a vestry. The bells date from the 15th and 16th centuries.

The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California designed the system to increase Southern California's water supply reliability in the face of future weather pattern uncertainties, while minimizing the impact on the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta environment in Northern California. The feeder takes advantage of large volumes of water when available from Northern California, depositing it in surface storage reservoirs, such as Diamond Valley Lake, and local groundwater basins for use during dry periods and emergencies. This improves the quality of Southern California drinking water by allowing more uniform blending of better quality water from the state project with Colorado River supplies, which has a higher mineral content. The feeder system includes three large tunnels, two running through the San Bernardino Mountains and one running under the Riverside Badlands between Redlands and Moreno Valley. Construction began in 1997 and water began flowing through the system in mid-2010. , it is the only source of water for Diamond Valley Lake.  Geography  The feeder begins at the Devil Canyon afterbay in the foothills of San Bernardino, where water is received from Silverwood Lake, and makes its way through the Arrowhead West and Arrowhead East tunnels into Highland. From there the Highland pipeline and Mentone pipeline carry water to Redlands and the northern end of the Riverside Badlands Tunnel. The Riverside Badlands Tunnel runs south into Moreno Valley, where a series of pipelines carries and deposits water into Diamond Valley Lake near Hemet.  Construction  Construction of the Inland Feeder began in 1997 with the excavation of the Riverside Badlands Tunnel followed by the excavation of the two Arrowhead tunnels. Water began flowing through the system in mid-2010. Construction of the tunnels was such a large project that it was featured in the television shows Modern Marvels and Tactical to Practical on the History Channel, and Discovery Channel‚Äôs Build It Bigger. Because of the challenges faced during construction of the tunnels, the project received the 2010 E3 Environmental Sustainability Honor Award by the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists. = Arrowhead West Tunnel = The Arrowhead West Tunnel is long and in diameter. The tunnel begins at Devil's Canyon and is the first of the three tunnels in the feeder project. It continues east to the Waterman portal at Old Waterman Canyon Road and California State Route 18. The tunnel was constructed with a grade to allow water to flow by gravity; from the time the water enters the Devil Canyon Portal until it exits the Waterman Portal, the tunnel will have dropped about 31 feet in elevation. The west tunnel was the most difficult of the three tunnels to excavate. It was excavated using a tunnel boring machine (TBM) that took over four years to bore its way through the mountain. The TBM was launched from the Waterman Portal and tunneled in a westerly direction toward the Devil Canyon portal at a slight uphill gradient of approximately 2 inches per 100 linear feet (0.17%). Crews faced many challenges during the excavation, including the 2003 Old Fire that destroyed construction equipment at the Waterman Portal and halted tunneling for ten days. Later that year, a flash flood engulfed the Waterman Portal site and submerged the TBM. It took four months to restore operations in the aftermath of the flooding. The TBM faced many challenges during the tunneling. Much of the tunneling took place in water-bearing strata of metamorphic and granitic rock. The presence of water, coupled with the depth of the tunnel, up to 1,100 feet underground, forced the tunneling team to deal with water pressures in excess of 150 pounds per square inch. Additionally, the tunnel alignment crossed or traversed near several significant faults and shear zones, including branches of the San Andreas and Arrowhead Springs Faults. In these faulted areas, the massive blocks of rock were broken into fine debris that were treated with grout before tunneling could safely cross through these zones. A particularly challenging reach of the tunnel alignment was encountered in the last 1,500 feet of the tunneling work as the TBM crossed five significant fault and shear zones along the tunnel alignment on its way to completion at the Devil Canyon Portal. While tunneling in this zone in mid-2008, the TBM began dipping as it encountered a 40-foot-wide fault zone of completely crushed, weak rock. Concrete and steel foundation pads were constructed in front of the cutter head to stabilize the TBM and correct the alignment of the machine as it crossed the weak ground within the fault zone. The tunnel was completed in August 2008, with installation of pipeline being completed in 2009. = Arrowhead East Tunnel = The Arrowhead East Tunnel is long and in diameter and runs under McKinley Mountain. It begins at the Strawberry Portal in Strawberry Canyon near California State Route 18 and continues east to the City Creek Portal near California State Route 330. The East tunnel was also constructed at a slight downhill grade to allow water to flow by gravity; from the time the water enters the Strawberry Portal until it exits the City Creek Portal, the tunnel will have dropped about 55 feet in elevation. The tunnel was constructed in two segments. Original construction commenced in early 1997 at the City Creek Portal, and mining progressed along an uphill gradient from east to west. After two years of mining effort, and more than 8,000 feet into the tunnel alignment, groundwater flows into the excavated tunnel began to steadily increase. Following extensive consultation with the United States Forest Service, MWD decided to halt mining on the east tunnel and install the final 12-foot diameter pipe liner in the excavated portion of the tunnel. MWD and the Forest Service worked to determine how best to complete the remaining 22,458 feet of the tunnel. This collaboration resulted in significant revisions to the original design, revisions that would ultimately allow the tunneling effort to meet the strict groundwater inflow requirements of the Forest Service Special Use Permit. The tunnel was redesigned to use bolted and gasketed precast concrete tunnel segments. Not only were these segments designed to provide structural support to the mined tunnel, but they also were capable of delivering a nearly watertight environment inside the tunnel to dramatically limit the amount of groundwater inflow during the mining operations. Construction resumed from the Strawberry portal, working toward the original City Creek Portal construction. The tunnel was constructed using a TBM, originating from the Strawberry Portal and mining at a slight downhill gradient of approximately 18 feet per 100 linear feet (0.25%). Much like the West Tunnel, the TBM in the east tunnel encountered water-bearing strata of metamorphic and granitic rock. The presence of water, coupled with the depth of the tunnel below the surface, up to 2,100 feet underground, forced the tunneling team to deal with water pressures in the tunnel heading in excess of 200 pounds per square inch. Also, much like the West tunnel mining efforts, the TBM had to traverse branches of the San Andreas fault, and on one occasion in late 2006, the TBM became stuck as mining efforts approached some particularly difficult ground. Hand-mining efforts above the TBM shield were eventually employed to free the stuck machine. The tunnel was completed in May 2008 with the installation of pipeline being completed in 2009. = Riverside Badlands Tunnel = The $119 million Riverside Badlands Tunnel is long, the longest tunnel in the feeder project, with a diameter of and runs from Redlands, underneath the Crafton Hills and San Timoteo Badlands through to Moreno Valley. The tunnel ranges in depth from 50 to 850 feet and contains of pipeline. It has two primary portals; the Gilman portal in Moreno Valley and the Opal portal in Redlands, each with permanent concrete structures. Along with the two portals are two access-ventilation shafts: one along San Timoteo Canyon road and another along Live Oak Canyon road. The tunnel was finished in 2003, a year ahead of schedule. Construction of the tunnel began in October 1998 with the excavation of the Gilman Portal and dewatering work at the two intermediate shafts. Tunnel excavation was carried out from November 1999 through July 2001 using a shielded TBM. Construction of the tunnel included many challenges. The TBM had to bore its way through diverse ground conditions consisting of weak sedimentary rocks; strong, fractured metamorphic rocks; and alluvium, all of which were below the groundwater table. Special measures such as probing and grouting ahead of the TBM and, in particular, deep dewatering wells, were demonstrated to be effective for controlling adverse ground conditions. The project also showed the advantage of working from a portal. The Gilman Portal site proved to be ideal, supporting very efficient mining and muck disposal operations and also allowing long pipe sections to be installed in the tunnel, significantly reducing the amount of field welding required.

Owned by the State of Connecticut and maintained and operated by both Amtrak and Metro-North Railroad, it is also referred to as Pequonnock River Bridge, PECK Bridge, and Undergrade Bridge 55.90 (the mileage from Grand Central Terminal). Currently the bridge is part of the Northeast Corridor line, carrying rail traffic of Amtrak and Metro-North, as well as freight trains operated by the Providence & Worcester Railroad. History The 1902-built bridge on a postcard mailed in 1909 The previous bridge was constructed between 1898 and 1902 by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (replacing an earlier bridge) as one of two through girder Scherzer rolling bascule bridges on the New Haven Line. The bridge consisted of twin parallel rolling lift spans. and . It was one of eight legacy moveable bridges on the Amtrak route through Connecticut surveyed in one multiple property study in 1986. The eight bridges from west to east were: Mianus River Railroad Bridge at Cos Cob, built in 1904 (the surviving twin of the Pequonnock Bridge); Norwalk River Railroad Bridge at Norwalk, 1896; Saugatuck River Railroad Bridge at Westport, 1905; the Pequonnock Bridge; Housatonic River Railroad Bridge, at Devon, 1905; Connecticut River Railroad Bridge, Old Saybrook-Old Lyme, 1907; Niantic River Bridge, East Lyme- Waterford, 1907; and Thames River Bridge, Groton, built in 1919. The original bridge had 80 feet of horizontal clearance, and 15 feet of vertical clearance (when closed). From its original construction in 1902, it had only two tracks, but it carried a second parallel span to facilitate an expansion to up to four tracks, which was carried out in the late 1960s. The old bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987, an honor not enjoyed for long, as it was obvious even before the survey that total replacement, rather than repair, was needed for the span. =Deterioration and Replacement= During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the 1902 bridge began to rapidly deteriorate due to corrosion, metal fatigue, and heavy river currents. In 1986, a routine inspection revealed that the pit pier underneath the drawspan had loosened so much, the drawspan was able to move from side-to-side freely. A 10MPH speed restriction on trains was enforced while extensive repairs were undertaken to ensure the old bridge could remain in service until a replacement bridge was constructed. Finally In 1992, the US government issued an $80 million grant to help replace the 90-year-old bridge. http://articles.courant.com/1992-10-06/news/0000111630_1_congressional-budget- office-election-year-members-projects Construction on a replacement bridge, which began in 1993, was undertaken in 3 phases in order to minimize the effect on both rail and marine traffic through the area: Phase 1 included the realignment of the approaches to the bridge, and the construction of the south span of the new bridge, which would include two tracks. The new south span opened to rail traffic in early 1995. Phase 2 included the removal of the old south span, and construction (In its place) of the new north span, which would also carry two tracks. The new north span opened to rail traffic in late 1996. Phase 3 included the removal of the remainder of the old structure, additional structural work on the new bridge's two spans, and minor cosmetic improvements in the area surrounding the bridge. This phase was complete in early 1998, and soon after Amtrak and Metro-North jointly announced the completion of the bridge replacement project. The new bridge has 105 feet of horizontal clearance, which allows passage of marine traffic in two directions at the time, as well as 20 feet of vertical clearance (When closed). Additionally, the new bridge has a ballasted asphalt-topping deck instead of an open steel deck, which not only produces less noise, but also makes bridge and track maintenance much easier. As on the old bridge, the new one has twin-parallel spans, but in addition to being capable of tandem operation, they are also capable of independent operation.

He was one of Ahad Agha Shirvani's three sons, and grandson of Moustafa Khan Shirvani, governor of the Shirvan Khanate), a descendant of the Shirvan Shah who fought against Shah Esmaeil from the Persian Safavid dynasty. Following the defeat of the Shirvan Shah, the Khanate of Shirvan was annexed to Persia, but Mustafa Khan retained the governorship of Shirvan. Hosseinpour's grandfather Mustafa Khan was a powerful landowner and a senior military commander in Shirvan. He married a Georgian princess while the khanates of Shirvan and Georgia were both parts of Persia. Georgia, Shirvan and 15 other provinces or territories were later annexed to Russia, after three Russo-Persian wars, during the Qajar dynasty, upon which the commanders of their armies, refusing to serve under the new Russian leadership, left their command posts and immigrated with their families to Persia, remaining loyal to the Shah of Persia. Military career Young Colonel Hosseinpour in Persian Cossack military uniform Hosseinpour graduated in 1910 from the Academy of the Persian Cossack Brigade, as one of its fourth graduating class. He was a classmate of the future General Fazllollah Zahedi (who became Prime Minister under Shah Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1953) and Colonel Mehdi Gholi Tajbakhsh. On graduation from the Academy, he performed his military duties under Rouhoullah Mirza for about two years and was then appointed Commander to the armies of the Iranian provinces of Azerbaijan and Kurdistan. He was later transferred to the Cavalry Division of the Persian Cossack Army and took part in the World War I, during which he held a rank of lieutenant. At the end of the war he was promoted to major. Along with a number of other Cossack commanders, Hosseinpour was a founding member of the new Imperial Iranian Armed Forces during the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi. He headed the Cavalry Division in the February 21, 1921, coup headed by Reza Shah. He was one of a number of officers who reached and secured Tehran. Tehran was completely surrounded by a huge canal for protection against potential military invasion and robbers. A tall wall also encircled the city, with twelve huge metal gates that were locked at night and protected by military guards. The military force headed by the coup officers left Karaj, a town about 40 km from Tehran, and arrived at the Ghazvin Gate (close to the present Mehrabad International Airport). When Hosseinpour reached the gate, he told the military officers guarding it that all the other gates had already been taken and that it was in their best interests to surrender. Colonel Hosseinpour (second row, first right) with the white hat, Reza Shah (second row, first left), shown with white circles around their heads, with other commanders who carried out the 1921 Coup The guards surrendered and opened the gate, and the army entered the city without any bloodshed and secured the capital. A few days later, Hossienpour was promoted to colonel and appointed (with the co-operation of a few other top military commanders) to convert and create the modern Imperial Iranian Army Ground Forces, as head of the Cavalry Division based at the Abbas Abad military headquarters. A military medal called Sevoum Hoot, or Sevvoum Esfand, was awarded to the participating commanders and officers around 1928. Hosseinpour retired from the Imperial Iranian Army at the age of around 60 and spent the rest of his life monitoring the affairs of his villages and estates and engaging in philanthropic activities. =Command Posts= During his military career, Hosseinpour held the following military commands: *Commander of the Cavalry Division; *Commander of the Army of the Azerbaijan Province; *Commander of the Army of the Kerman Province; *Commander of the Army of the Kurdistan Province; *Head of the Imperial Iranian Army Juridical Tribunal; *Chief Military Advisor to the Imperial Iranian Ground Forces. =Military Medals= Hosseinpour was awarded military medals including: *Coup of the Sevvoum Esfand Medal; *Sepah Medal; *Zoulfaghar Medal. Personal life Hosseinpoor's father lost his parents and brother at a young age and inherited all the wealth and estates of the family. The Iranian government granted the ownership of a number of estates, farms, parcels of land, and villages to him and a few other top commanders in compensation for their fathers' financial losses incurred when they immigrated to Persia. Hosseinpoor's family received numerous villages, farms, estates, large parcels of land and houses, which Assadollah eventually inherited. Hosseinpour's grandfather was Amir Hossein, a high ranking commander of Shirvan and a close colleague and friend of Pasha Khan Pashai. He fought alongside Colonel Pasha Khan against the Russian Army in the war of 1863. Pasha Khan devoted a lot of effort to develop a farm named Koushk-e Mir Hossein, which was named after either Hosseinpour's grandfather or his own grandfather. Amir Hossein married the daughter of one of the landlords of Saraband territory in the town of Arak, Iran, all of whose wealth (villages and large parcels of land) was inherited by Hosseinpour as well. Hosseinpour lost his mother at the age of 12. His sister was married to Abdoullah Mostoufi, governor of Arak, but she too died at a young age. Hosseinpour's father's uncle (Pashai), persuaded him to join the Persian Cossack Brigade Academy. At the age of 20, Hosseinpour inherited from his father and came into an aristocrat's life. While a student at the Persian Cossack Brigade Academy, he frequently visited the Pashai's house to call on his cousins. Pashai's wife once said that in 1906, when Hossseinpour visited them, he was still a student at the Academy. Hosseinpour married Badieh Khanum Monadjemi, an adherent of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Their first child was a daughter named Fakhralzaman Khanum and their second, born a few years later, a son named Amir Houshang, who died while still a child. Badieh Khanum died of breast cancer a few years later, and Hosseinpour married her sister, Monireh Khanum. They had three daughters (Tourandokht, Pourandokht, and Victoria) and two sons (Abdolreza and Tooraj. Abdolreza's son, Amir Hosseinpour became an opera director and choreographer based in London). Monireh Khanum died in her sleep at the age of 48, and four years later, in 1954, Hosseinpour died of a heart attack in Iran. He was buried in Tehran's Bah√° º√≠ cemetery (Golestaneh Javid), which was destroyed by Islamic mobs after the Iranian political unrest of 1979 in Iran.

Among them were a provision that ceded to the United States a narrow strip of land in northwestern Ohio comprising \\"a tract of land for a road, of one hundred and twenty feet in width, from the foot of the rapids of the river Miami of Lake Erie (today known as the Maumee River, to the western line of the Connecticut reserve, and all the land within one mile of the said road...\\".

It lies between the islands of Mellum (which is to the southwest) and Neuwerk ( northeast). The central area of the sandbank lies above the high water mark, forming the Hochsand of Hoher Knechtsand, which was formerly an island.

To enable the population of Heligoland to return to their home, the then Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, offered the area around the Gro√üer Knechtsand as an alternative site for military exercises. As a result, from 1952 the area acted as a target for practice bombing sharp explosive and incendiary bombs of the British Royal Air Force instead of Heligoland. A few years later, environmental awareness had increased and, when the contract expired in 1957, it was not renewed. This important area for resting and moulting shelduck and other seabirds was designated in 1957 as the largest German nature reserve in Germany.

It was situated to the southwest of Chicago City Hall and in very close proximity to St. Peter's Church. It was built between 1908 and 1909 by Holabird & Roche, contemporaneously with the Blackstone Hotel designed by Benjamin Marshall in a very similar style and at the time was Chicago's finest hotel.Hotel La Salle, Chicago's greatest hotel: erected A.D. 1908-9 by Hotel La Salle Company (1908) After a major fire in the hotel in June 1946, it was rebuilt at a cost of US$2 million and reopened in July 1947; it flourished for 29 more years, until it was demolished in 1976 to make room for office towers. The hotel under construction in 1909 History Chicago's luxury hotels evolved as part of the architectural revolution that found form as skyscraper buildings. The La Salle Hotel built between 1908 and 1909 as a 23-story, 1,000 bedroom building in the Chicago Loop community area of Chicago. the site on the northwest corner of North LaSalle and West Madison Streets, had previously been occupied by the five-story La Salle Building from 1872 to 1908 and the adjacent Oriental Hall, a Masonic temple, from 1873. Known as the ‚ÄúEmpire Block,‚Äù it housed the Metropolitan National Bank. The hotel was named in honor of Robert Cavelier de LaSalle. Built at a cost of approximately $3,500,000, or 44 cents per cubic foot, the architects were Holabird & Roche while the engineers were the firm of Purdy & Henderson. At one time Chicago's largest hotel, the LaSalle was opened in 1909 by the family of John Paul Stevens. It was run by Ernest J. Stevens, father of the Supreme Court Justice. President Calvin Coolidge at the hotel in 1925 The hotel was planned, designed and built in the commercial district of Chicago as an upscale hotel for an elite and influential clientele, with luxurious and stately walnut-paneled rooms and lobbies. An elegant roof top garden was planned as a major attraction. When it was opened in 1909, it was hailed as the \\"largest, safest, and most modern hotel west of New York.\\" The Republican Party of Illinois had their offices located in the luxurious Blue Fountain Room of the hotel. During one of his long visits to Chicago, President William Howard Taft stayed in the presidential suite on the third floor of this hotel, converting it into de facto White House. A formal visit was also paid to the hotel by President Calvin Coolidge and his wife in 1925. Other visitors came as convention guests. However, all this history ended with a disastrous fire (see below) in the hotel on June 5, 1946, which was compounded by the fact that the hotel did not live up to its professed \\"safest hotel\\" claim, as there was lack of basic fire prevention, warning and firefighting facilities. At the time of the fire, guests occupied 886 rooms of the hotel, with 103 employees at work. After the fire, the hotel was rebuilt and renamed, at a cost of US $2 million, reopening in July 1947 and flourishing for 29 more years until it was razed in 1976 to construct office towers. The famous Silver Grill Cocktail Lounge in the hotel was renamed \\"The Hour Glass\\" after renovation. Among other events that took place at the hotel, include the 1928 Prohibition Party's National Convention July 10‚Äì12, 1928. William F. Varney was made the party's Presidential nominee. Architecture The architects of this skyscraper building developed their own innovative architectural style within the \\"Chicago School\\". A special feature of this style is the \\"Chicago window\\" with a large pane of plate glass for each window flanked by constricted windows which could be opened. This created an illusion that the entire building was made up of glass. La Salle billed itself as \\"Chicago's Finest Hotel\\" and was a symbol of upper class extravagance in Chicago in the early twentieth century, with its grand ballrooms and luxury restaurants exuding a grandeur of the fine palace hotels of Europe. The hotel was 22 stories high and claimed 1000 rooms. It was one of Chicago's leading hotels until North Michigan Avenue became host to the Drake Hotel (1918‚Äì20) and the Allerton Hotel (1923‚Äì4). Resembling hotels of New York City, it had a particular similarity to the 1904 Hotel Astor. =Exterior= The above ground level, 22 story building was built on rock caissons and had two basements. The hotel frontage on La Salle Street was while the Madison Street frontage was . Its architectural style was also defined as \\"beaux-arts.\\" =Interior= The hotel's Main Lobby was dramatic and opulent with green and gold decorations, carrying the theme through its carpets and drapes. It was furbished with marble throughout: floors, statues and a desk. Accents included brass fixtures and spittoons. There were over- sized, upholstered chairs, as well as shorter ones for women and children. Another fountain, this one glowing and blue, was located in the aptly named Blue Fountain Room. Proposed as a more intimate place to relax, the room was fitted with a marble statuette of Venus de' Medici and a lower, vaulted ceiling. The woodwork was silver maple.Bruegmann, p. 331 Its unique light fixtures were red globes. Two large chandeliers hung from the gilded and vaulted ceiling of the green and gold themed Louis XVI Dining Room. Brass sconces were built in between the windows. A gilded and vaulted ceiling, and a repeating green and gold theme drew on the style of the Main Lobby. Another eating area was the Dutch Room (or German Grill). It was noted for its enormous red brick supports which supported the heavy-beamed and paneled ceilings. The room was furnished with wooden and leather chairs and had blue tiled walls and terra cotta tiled floors. It was here that electric grilling started in Chicago. Dutch Room Considered by some to be Chicago's most beautiful hotel dining room, the Palm Room featured an Italian fountain after a model by Donatello as its centerpiece. It was built of cream-colored stone, Rookwood tile, and gray terra cotta, while featuring high-beamed ceilings. The ambiguously named Buffet was actually the hotel's bar. It was decorated in the style of a medieval castle with heavy beams, paneled ceilings, and wooden booths. There were murals, lead glass windows, and metal chandeliers. The Palm Room and the Donatello Fountain The ballroom was designed with arched windows and vaulted ceilings. These were painted trims of blue, gold and green. The curtains and chairs were accented with red velvet. Large chandeliers provided light. Accessed from a double-loaded corridor, Floors 2 through 18 were sleeping rooms, arranged in a square doughnut formation. A central light well was built into the hotel, extending from the lobby to the top of the building. They were designed as suites of paired rooms, each with its own bathroom. Large enough to accommodate a grand piano, the Presidential Suite featured a white marble fireplace. Fire On June 5, 1946, a fire broke out in the hotel, killing 61 people, many of them children. Among the dead included a battalion chief of the Chicago Fire Department. The fire began in the Silver Grill Cocktail Lounge on the lower floor on the La Salle Street side adjacent to the lobby before ascending stairwells and shafts The fire started either in the walls or in the ceiling according to the Chicago Fire Department around 12:15 a.m. but they did not receive their first notification of the fire until 12:35 a.m. The fire quickly spread through the highly-varnished wood paneling in the lounge and the mezzanine balcony overlooking the lobby. While a significant number died from flames, a greater number of deaths were caused by suffocation from the thick, black smoke. Around 900 guests were able to leave the building but some 150 had to be rescued by the fire services and by heroic members of the public, including two sailors who were reported to have rescued 27 people between them. Two-thirds of hotel fire deaths in 1946 occurred in the La Salle and Winecoff (Atlanta) fires. The hotel fire was so devastating, it resulted in the Chicago city council enacting new hotel building codes and fire-fighting procedures, including the installation of automatic alarm systems and instructions of fire safety inside the hotel rooms. The hotel was refurbished after the fire and was finally demolished in July 1976, to be occupied by the Two North LaSalle office building. This skyscraper was completed on the site in 1979.

Early life  Juan Bautista Azopardo was born in Senglea, Malta, the son of Rosina (n√©e Romano) and Salvatore Azopardo. As a young man he studied naval architecture at the French arsenal in Toulon.  Privateer  He then served with the French and the British fleets, the latter under the command of Admiral John Jervis. He captained the tartanes San Antonio e Anime del Porgatorio. He later served as a privateer with a Letter of marque from the Netherlands, and later with a Letter of marque from Spain against England. Azopardo arrived in the R√≠o de La Plata area in the first years of the 19th century. During the war between England and the Batavian Republic (the Netherlands), he served on the schooner The Hoop and took part in the capture of the British frigate HMS Neptune which had arrived at the port of Montevideo as a prize on 21 January 1804. It carried 256 slaves. The prize Captain was the Frenchman Hip√≥lite Mordeille. Azopardo served as second in command of the privateer frigate Dromedario with a Letter of marque from Montevideo, captained by Mordeille. = British Invasions of Buenos Aires (1806 - 1807) = The frigate Dromedario transported some of the troops which fought against the first British Invasion (1806) of Buenos Aires. Along with his captain and the rest of the Dromedario crew, they fought in the final assault to the Brisith fortress in Buenos Aires where the remnants of the British forces under general Beresford were.Los marinos en las invasiones inglesas, by Laurio Hedelvio Dest√©fani. Pag 373 During the second British invasion (1807) of Buenos Aires they transported artillery pieces on the Paran√° River for the city's defense. For his valor and gallantry, the Spanish Royal government made him a Lieutenant Colonel of the urban Militias. On 17 November 1807, in Buenos Aires, Santiago de Liniers gives him a Letter of marque for his schooner La Mosca, built by Anselmo Sa√©nz Valiente. The Letter of marque expired in 1808 whereupon Azopardo retired from the privateering business.  Argentine service  = War of independence = Azopardo joined the revolutionary forces on the May Revolution of 1810. He was given back the rank the Spanish viceroy had taken from him. After the poor results of the Paraguay campaign, Manuel Belgrano requested reinforcements from Buenos Aires in order to maintain his fight in the region. The Junta could not send them by land through Entre R√≠os Province, as the rivers were controlled by the royalist navy under Gaspar de Vigodet. At the end of 1810 the government gave Lieutenant Colonel Azopardo, command of the first national navy, comprising three vessels, whose mission was to protect the advance of the reinforcements to Belgrano's force. The ships of this small squadron were the schooner Invencible, the brigantine 25 de Mayo and the sloop Am√©rica. His second in command was captain Hip√≥lito Bouchard. Battle of San Nicol√°s. At the Battle of San Nicol√°s, on 2 March 1811, he was forced to confront a superior royalist navy with seven ships to his three. Azopardo was wounded and made prisoner, with his ships being captured. Belgrano would have to do without reinforcements and be forced to sign a document abandoning Paraguay. Imprisoned by the Spaniards, he was moved to Ceuta, where he shared a prison cell with the Inca Juan Bautista T√∫pac Amaru. The revolution of General Riego (1820) ended with the liberals taking power in Spain, and ordering the freedom of all political prisoners. Azopardo was freed and returned to Argentina where he was received as a hero. He was given the post of Buenos Aires Harbor Master. = War with Brazil = Returning to Buenos Aires he was given command of the brigantine General Belgrano, as second in command to admiral Guillermo Brown, to fight against the naval forces of Pedro I of Brazil who had declared war on Argentina at the end of 1825. = Final service = He returned to the post of Buenos Aires Harbor Master until 1826.

Former Bank of America vice chairman Gene Taylor was chief executive, former Bank of America executive and Fifth Third Bank CFO, Chris Marshall was CFO and former Bank of America executive, R. Bruce Singletary was Chief Risk Officer. Former Morgan Stanley specialty finance research analyst, Kenneth Posner, managed corporate strategy and investor relations. Its original purpose was to take over banks that had difficulties due to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010. The company's main interest was banks in the Carolinas and Florida, but in 2011, NAFH moved into Tennessee and Virginia for the first time. Despite buying seven distressed, money losing banks, Capital Bank was consistently profitable during the duration of its existence and consistently posted improved returns for each of its five years of operations. Capital Bank completed a successful IPO in September 2012, and used to trade on the NASDAQ under the ticker CBF until its acquisition by First Horizon National Corporation in December 2017. History =North American Financial Holdings= In December 2009, NAFH raised $900 million from such sources as private equity firms Crestview Partners, Oak Hill Advisors and Falfurrias Capital Partners. In March 2010 the OCC granted NAFH a national bank charter, and the search began for banks to acquire. On June 29, 2010, Naples, Florida- based TIB Financial Corp., parent of TIB Bank and Naples Capital Advisors, announced that NAFH had agreed to invest $175 million in the company. Over the next 18 months, NAFH would have the right to invest $175 million more. The deal was completed in third quarter 2010. As of July 16, 2010, NAFH owned MetroBank of Dade County, Florida; Turnberry Bank of Aventura, Florida; and First National Bank of the South in Spartanburg, South Carolina. These four banks, after approval of the TIB deal, give NAFH $3.1 billion in assets, and 10 branches in the Miami, Florida area and 13 in South Carolina, plus 28 more branches in southwest Florida with the completion of the TIB deal. NAFH did not pay for the three banks it already owns, but instead divided loan losses with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Hugh McColl, co-founder of Falfurrias and former Bank of America CEO, predicted NAFH would have $20 billion in assets in five to seven years. As of March 31, 2010, MetroBank had $442.3 million in assets with $391.3 million in deposits. Turnberry Bank had $263.9 million in assets with $196.9 million in deposits. First National had $682.0 million in assets and deposits totalling $610.1 million. =Capital Bank= Capital Bank's headquarters in Raleigh On December 16, 2010, shareholders of Raleigh, North Carolina-based Capital Bank approved selling a majority interest to NAFH, which would buy newly issued stock rather than stock from existing shareholders. Capital Bank began in 1997 as the Triangle's first new bank in eight years, after raising $26 million, the most for a new bank in the state's history.Joel B. Obermayer, \\"Capital Bank lives up to name,\\" News & Observer June 24, 1997. By 2005, after expansion and buying other banks, Capital had $915 million in assets,Frank Norton, \\"Bank plans to move downtown,\\" News & Observer, November 2, 2005. and by 2010, assets had reached $1.7 billion. The Late-2000s recession hurt Capital, and regulators expected the bank to act. At one time, selling new stock was considered. Finally, Capital chose to accept help from NAFH.David Ranii, \\"Capital Bank merger outlined,\\" News & Observer, November 6, 2010. The deal originally depended on NAFH being able to get a 50 percent discount on preferred stock and warrants held by the U.S. Treasury as a result of the federal stimulus. However, in a January 18, 2011 interview, Capital CEO Grant Yarber said the federal government would get all its money back. On January 28, 2011, NAFH completed its $181 million deal for 85 percent of Capital. NAFH CEO Gene Taylor became CEO of Capital, replacing Yarber, whose new title was market president for North Carolina. All NAFH-owned banks continued to operate separately but the company announced its intention to re-brand the banks as Capital Bank. Capital had 32 branches before the deal, but after adding the four other NAFH banks, the total was 84. Capital kept its Raleigh headquarters. When the deal was closed, North American's banks had more than $5 billion in assets, placing them among the nations top 125 banks. Late in April 2011, NAFH applied to the Comptroller of the Currency for a merger of all of the banks into NAFH National Bank, a nationally chartered bank which operates as Capital Bank, National Association. The Capital Bank headquarters then relocated from Raleigh's Capital Bank Plaza, where it moved in 2006, to Miami, Florida. Raleigh would still have such operations as technology and loan processing at what CFO Christopher Marshall described as the \\"working headquarters\\". The headquarters change put Capital in the Federal Reserve Bank's Atlanta, Georgia territory, though this made the merger easier because as a Florida-based company, NAFH was already under Atlanta's jurisdiction. A Raleigh headquarters would have put the bank under Richmond, Virginia, which would have required the same changes as a move. On May 5, 2011, NAFH announced a $217 million deal for 90 percent of Greeneville, Tennessee-based Green Bankshares Inc., with 65 GreenBank branches and $2.5 billion in assets. GreenBank CEO Steve Rownd would be Tennessee market president. With the completion of this transaction in the third quarter, NAFH had $7.1 billion in assets (putting the company in the nation's top 100 banks), $5.4 billion in deposits, and 146 branches in five states. NAFH also bought the remainder of TIB and Capital. In June 2011, NAFH filed with the SEC to raise up to $300 million in an initial public offering. Because the market was not doing well, NAFH postponed the IPO until 2012, after the holding company had changed its name to Capital Bank Financial Corp. In a news release dated March 27, 2012, Capital Bank Financial Corp. said it agreed to buy Southern Community Financial Corp. of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, whose Southern Community Bank and Trust had $1.5 billion in assets and 22 branches, for $2.88 a share. Southern Community, started in 1996, was Winston-Salem's third-largest bank by deposits. The completion of the deal was expected to give Capital Bank Financial $8.1 billion in assets and 165 branches. On October 26, 2016, Capital Bank completed its acquisition of CommunityOne Bank, with $2.4 billion in assets and 45 branches and based in Charlotte, North Carolina, in a deal worth $350 million. On December 1, 2017, Memphis, Tennessee-based First Horizon National Corporation completed its $2.2 billion purchase of Capital Bank. The Capital Bank name continued to be used outside Tennessee until October 2019. Former Capital Bank chief Executive Gene Taylor was added to the First Horizon board of directors as vice chair in addition to receiving over $7 million in change-of-control compensation, while Capital Bank CFO Chris Marshall and Capital Bank CRO R.

The business practice has evolved in recent years as a way to keep creative talent in house, reminiscent of the Hollywood studio system. Though industry players initially thought there would be a backlash to the practice, independent producers have embraced the system as a way to lower their overhead and increase the chances of getting their projects funded. The studio can incur large costs from high- profile housekeeping deals which have become less common during economic down turns.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the resignation of the sitting Conservative MP, Robert Gee.The Times, 10 May 1927 p16 Gee had formerly been MP for Woolwich East from 1921 to 1922 and had held his Bosworth seat since the 1924 general election.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 pp 62 & 410 He was clearly disillusioned with Parliamentary life however because he was reported to have been absent from his political duties for over a year at the time of the by-election, having emigrated to the backwoods of Western Australia with no intention of returning.The Times, 24 March 1927 p9  Previous Result  Bosworth was clearly a three-way marginal at this time. It had been won by a Coalition Liberal in 1918, a Tory in 1922, was Liberal in 1923 and Conservative again in 1924. Although Labour had not yet won the seat, the party consistently polled about a third of the vote in all these recent contests, coming second in 1922.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p410 Candidates = Conservatives = The Conservatives selected 40-year-old Brigadier General Edward Spears, a noted First World War soldier who had been head of the British Military Mission in Paris and who was from 1922-1924 the National Liberal MP for Loughborough.The Times, 16 May 1927 p16 = Liberals = The Liberals chose Sir William Edge, a 45-year-old manufacturer who had been MP for Bolton from 1916-1923 and was a former government whip. = Labour = The Labour Party settled upon John Minto, originally from Kilmarnock a member of Leicester City Council since 1922The Times House of Commons, 1929; Politico‚Äôs Publishing, 2003 p90 and an engineer working for Leicester Co- operative Society. Issues In 1926 the retirement of H H Asquith as Liberal leader and his replacement by Lloyd George began to turn the tide for the Liberals. In March 1927, they gained a Labour seat in a by-election at Southwark North. Spears began the campaign with a public announcement that the political tide was running in favour of the government and the Conservative Party. The major issue throughout the campaign was the Trade Unions Bill, a measure brought in following the General Strike of 1926 which outlawed secondary strike action and any strike whose purpose was to coerce the government of the day directly or indirectly. He attacked Minto and Edge for opposing the Bill. In so doing he tried to paint Edge as a socialist who stood against Parliamentary government and the liberty of the workers. He also began by offering himself as the party of safeguarding of industry. Edge‚Äôs supporters too entered the campaign with public declarations of forthcoming victory The Times, 17 May 1927 p9 and Spears‚Äô team seemed less inclined to predict a good result than their candidate. Labour were also confident but wary of making an early public announcement of their prospects. Minto hoped to make headway on the Trade Unions Bill in the Coalville area of the constituency. The town was the main coal mining centre, where nearly a third of the electorate of the constituency lived and Labour stronghold on the local Urban District Council.The Times, 6 April 1927 p11 He attacked the Bill vehemently. Edge tried to steer a middle path on the trades disputes issue, accusing the Labour Party of bringing the law on themselves by their behaviour over the general strike but attacking the Tories for damaging industrial relations and trade and inviting accusations of class animosity.The Times, 19 May 1927 p11 The letters sent by the Labour and Conservative party leaders to their candidates concentrated almost exclusively on the Trade Union Bill. Ramsay MacDonald called it a ‚Äúdisruptive and partisan attack upon the trades unions‚Äù and appealed to the electors of Bosworth to reject this ‚Äúattack upon the workers.‚Äù The Times, 25 May 1927 p13 The prime minister Stanley Baldwin called the Bill. ‚Äúthe great issue before the country at the present time.‚Äù He said it was a measure against ‚Äútyranny and intimidation‚Äù and urged those who valued ‚Äúthe maintenance of the democratic institutions of [the] country‚Äù to vote for Spears.The Times, 26 May 1927 p13 Campaign strengths When the candidates‚Äô nominations which had been handed into the Returning Officer were made public on 23 May 1927, it was the Liberals who seemed to have the advantage if the numbers of supporting signatures was an accurate reflection of opinion in the contest. The Liberals had submitted 330 nomination sheets, signed by 3,300 electors in the constituency. They claimed that one was signed wholly by former Conservative voters and one signed wholly by trade unionists. They had submitted 75 papers signed by 750 electors from the Coalville electoral districts where the voters were largely miners, which would have been seen as a blow to Labour hopes. Compared to this show of support, Spears put in 66 papers, including some signed by ex-Liberals and Minto submitted 33.The Times, 24 May 1927 p13 In other indications of the way things were going, Lloyd George addressed a crowd estimated at 10,000 strong in Coalville, while Arthur Henderson attracted about one quarter of that number for Labour;The Times, 30 May 1927 p11 and one reporter who travelled through the constituency estimated that Liberal window bills in private houses outnumbered those of their rivals by more than twenty times.The Times, 27 May 1927 p13 It is also difficult to estimate the success or otherwise of election publicity but Edge appears to have scored a goal with the working class electorate when he arranged for the visit to the constituency of two former professional football players with Bolton Wanderers. Edge had an association with the Club from his former time as MP for the city and the men supported his candidacy from friendship and on the basis of his personal qualities as good man and a ‚Äògood sport‚Äô. Zinoviev letter The by-election also re-awakened the divisive issue of the Zinoviev letter a controversial document published by the British press in 1924, allegedly sent from the Communist International in Moscow to the Communist Party of Great Britain. The letter, took its name from Bolshevik revolutionary Grigory Zinoviev. Later revealed to be a forgery, purported to be a directive from Moscow calling for intensified Communist agitation in Britain and helped ensure the fall of the MacDonald‚Äôs Labour government at the 1924 general election. In his letter of support to Minto, Ramsay MacDonald referred to the Conservatives as ‚Äúhaving gained its Parliamentary power by a trick.‚Äú This provoked a letter to The Times from Walter Blake Odgers (1880-1969), a barrister at the Middle Temple claiming this was a reference to the Zinoviev letter and re-opening the controversy. MacDonald responded with his own letter, again accusing the Tories of having ‚Äúcreated a stampede of fear in the minds of the electorate.‚ÄùThe Times, 27 May 1927 p12 A number of developments followed, further letters to the press, a speech by J. R. Clynes at Manchester accusing the government of making political capital from forgery The Times, 28 May 1927 p14 and a letter to Spears from the Home Secretary, Sir William Joynson-Hicks accusing Labour of continually displaying the utmost sympathy for the Russian Communists. Edge tried to take advantage of this Tory-Labour spat and the fears of socialism that it evoked by painting Minto as being supported by extremist elements in his party. Edge appealed to moderate electors to vote for him ‚Äúor they [would] hand over the Bosworth division as a gift to the Reds.‚Äù Final days Liberal confidence was beginning to wane with the approach of polling day, although on the eve of poll, Edge declared the race was between himself and the Labour man. However it was reported that only the Conservatives had managed to compete a thorough canvass of the whole constituency and that their organisation was better developed and more effectively directed than the other parties. Spears announced that on the basis of the canvass returns he was sure to win.The Times, 31 May 1927 p13 Labour now sounded more self-assured as well, more optimistic about the turnout from the Labour and mining areas around Coalville and predicting a victory over the Liberals with Spears at the bottom of the poll.The Times, 28 May 1927 p7 Edge‚Äôs supporters would go no further than saying the result was ‚Äòfifty-fifty‚Äô between their candidate and the Labour Party. Result The result was a narrow victory for Sir William Edge by 271 votes over Labour, gaining the seat from the Conservatives. At the 1924 general election Robert Gee had had a majority of 358 votes over the Liberal candidate. The turnout in the by-election was 84.6%.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; p410 The result was declared after an understandable Labour call for a recount.The Times, 2 June 1927 p16  Aftermath  Edge‚Äôs victory at Bosworth was followed at Lancaster, St Ives and Eddisbury by further gains. These results caused the Conservatives to fear the possibility of a Liberal revival Antony Seldon, How Tory governments fall: the Tory party in power since 1783; Fontana Press, 1996 p282 but they should however have been more worried about the rise of Labour. Over the course of the 1924-1929 Parliament, Labour made thirteen by-election gains in all, eleven from the Tories, and two from the Liberals Chris Cook & John Ramsden (eds.), By-election in British Politics; UCL Press, 1997 pp 59-65 and went on to win the 1929 general election. Labour had to wait until 1945 however before finally gaining Bosworth.

Initially founded by Doug Baker at Southern Methodist University in March 1967, under the title NOTES from the Underground, the first issues were run off after hours on a copy machine at Texas Instruments.  History  With a blend of New Left political activism, hippie/drug counterculture, and underground comix and graphics, the paper developed a growing citywide and regional readership, and starting with Vol. 1, No. 26 (Feb. 16-29, 1968) the paper changed its banner to Dallas Notes and is sometimes confused with the competing weekly publication published by Doug Baker, first called \\"Dallas News\\", later, when the U.S. Post Office delivered their mail to \\"The Dallas Morning News\\" and the big morning paper's mail to them, Baker renamed it \\"The Iconoclast\\". Eventually circulation peaked at 20,000 copies after Stony Burns quit. Roy Appleton wrote in the Dallas Morning News that Dallas Notes \\"covered the local scene ‚Äî from music and drug arrests to demonstrations and the men in blue.\\" He reported that the paper \\"decried war, intolerance and hypocrisy with a playful aggression and a cutting edge.\\" The paper's 85-issue run came to an end with the issue of Sept. 16-30, 1970. It was subsequently revived and carried forward under the name H.O.O.K.A. (The Humanitarian Order of Kosmic Awareness, organized as a church, whose purpose was the overthrow of the U.S. Government). When Stoney Burns left, citing he'd \\"dropped acid and flipped out three times, but only came back twice,\\" he introduced J.R. Compton to the staff as the new editor and publisher, from late 1970 to 1972. During its existence Dallas Notes was subjected to repeated police raids and harassment. Thorne Dreyer wrote at The Rag Blog that Notes editor Burns \\"was incessantly harassed by the Dallas authorities, who charged him with obscenity, beat him mercilessly, tore up his offices, and confiscated his equipment.\\" Burns later learned that many of the office tear-ups and equipment thefts were carried out by his father and his father's trusted assistant. The obscenity case against the paper \\"went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court where Justice William O. Douglas commented on the cops' ransacking of the Dallas Notes offices: 'It would be difficult to find in our books a more lawless search-and-destroy raid.'\\" In a widely publicized case former editor Burns was sentenced to prison in 1972 for 10 years and a day for possession of marijuana, but the sentence was commuted by Texas Governor Dolph Briscoe. Time magazine reported that, \\"The law in Dallas, from all appearances, had been bent on getting Stoney Burns for years.\\" In his book, Unamerican Activities: The Campaign Against the Underground Press, Geoffrey Rips wrote that the \\"persistent persecution of Burns stemmed in part from [his] 1967 investigative report in Dallas Notes about Texas Congressman Joe Pool's arrest for drunken driving, after his car hit a carload of soldiers at a red light.\\" Pool was released and the arrest records destroyed, and the story was ignored by the Dallas daily newspapers. Pool, who was a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee, called for an investigation of the underground papers. In October 1972, Burns, founded Buddy magazine, a free bi-monthly named after Buddy Holly that covered, among other things, the rock-n-roll and blues scene in North Texas.

It is a narrow strip of land between the railway line which connects Bristol to Avonmouth, and the River Avon. Flora and fauna Lamplighter's Marsh has two main types of vegetation: an area of marsh, which contains a varied plant community, including water parsnip and wild celery, and an area of wasteland which is also botanically notable, with species including narrow-leaved everlasting-pea. The Severn Way footpath and cycleway sits alongside the river, passing through Lamplighter‚Äôs Marsh where the path is called the \\"yellow brick road\\". Viper‚Äôs bugloss, moth mullein and hornet moth are among the scarce and notable species recorded at the site. The presence of the grass sea couch are a sign of the influence of the nearby Severn Estuary. Bee orchids grow in the area of grassland now known as the Daisy Field lying between the railway and the Portway. Local birdwatchers have recorded a number of species including common swift, Eurasian siskin, common redshank, Eurasian curlew, Eurasian sparrowhawk, great cormorant and goldcrest. The site is designed a Site of Nature Conservation Interest and a Local Nature Reserve. History Lamplighter's Marsh was utilised as grazing marsh up to the modern era. In the 18th century the small, brick-making village of West Town took up part of the site, it has gone now but is recalled in the name of the West Town Road. When the First World War broke out the British Army established a remount Depot at Shirehampton. The depot imported, trained and sent out horses on active service with the army and it was very large, extending from Station Road all the way to the Portway roundabout, including the area now known as the Daisy Field. In the Second World War Lamplighter's Marsh was used to tether barrage balloons which were to protect the nearby docks from bombing by the Luftwaffe and some of the concrete blocks used to anchor these balloons are still on the site. In the post-war years some of Lamplighter's Marsh became a landfill site and when this closed in 1976 the regeneration of the area started.

It's located about 105 km SW of the regional capital city Kostanay on the right bank of the Tobol River (a tributary of the Irtysh River). Population: History The city owes its existence to a high-phosphorus, 1.72 billion-ton iron ore deposit discovered in 1949; development did not begin until the 1960s. The government began to create a village in the wilderness to house miners. In 1971 the village became a city. 1991 ore production was 6.2 million tons, but it began falling after independence; 1994 production was 2.6 MT. In the mid-eighties construction of a chemical plant was begun, but construction was interrupted after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the early 1990s mining in Lisakovsk was in a critical situation due to a sharp fall in demand for iron concentrate in the metallurgical industry in Kazakhstan and Russia. City authorities had to take extraordinary steps to maintain the economy and to develop new industries. By decision of the Kazakhi Parliament, the city became a free economic zone in 1992. It began searching for new kinds of employment in a market economy. Demography Representatives of 51 different nationalities live in the city. Economy During January‚ÄìMay 2010, industrial enterprises of all kinds produced goods worth 8,289.3 million tenge, 148.5% more than it produced in January‚ÄìMay 2009. The mining industry during this period produced goods worth 6292.7 million tenge, which is 175% higher than the corresponding level last year. In comparison with January‚ÄìMay 2009 iron ore (in kind) increased by 0.8%, bauxite by 9.5%, and zinc ore extraction increased 4.5 times. The share of mining citywide was 75.9%. The manufacturing industry in January‚ÄìMay 2010 produced products to 1307 million tenge, which is lower than the corresponding period last year by 4.6%. 80.1% of manufacture by volume is the production of food (including beverages and tobacco): food products produced 1046.7 million tenge. In the machinery industry in January‚ÄìMay of this year 4 agricultural harvesters. Assembling the reapers made when receiving the order. The garment industry produced 1,716 units. amounting to 4.5 million tenge. The production of polyethylene film (139.1%), corrugated cardboard (104.1%), furniture and wood products-on 2.2% (in monetary terms). In the area of distribution of electricity, gas and water production volume amounted to 689.6 million tenge. Archeology In 1984 settlements and cemeteries of the Bronze Age were found. The Andronovo culture complex dates from the 15th-18th centuries BC. Over the years research has revealed more than two thousand square meters of settlements and excavated more than a hundred and fifty burial structures in the form of burial mounds and stone walls. These findings characterize the basic life-support systems and religious ideas of Indo-Iranian tribes that lived in the steppe zone of the Upper Pritobolya in the mid-second millennium BC. The collection of the Lisakovsk city museum, which houses the bulk of the finds, includes more than 200 ceramic vessels, 30 pieces of gold jewelry in the form of rings, more than 40 bronze ornaments (rings, bracelets, ornaments of the braid), stone, bone and bronze tools. In 2011 it was announced that Kazakh archeologists had found a 3000-year-old burial site during excavation of a mound. Three Bronze Age stone vaults were found; one contained a 2-meter skeleton thought to belong to a chieftain.Tengri News: \\"Two-meter skeleton of Bronze Age chieftain found near Lisakovsk\\". April 8, 2011. More than a hundred funerary structures have been studied. Items of funeral rites have been found as well as the remains of wooden structures, fragments of textiles, and evidence of weaving and felt making. One of the rare finds is an idol of anthropomorphic form. The excavations of a Kurgan leader \\"demonstrate the complex cosmogonic idea, inherent in the architectural design of the mound. The city administration supports research archeologists around the city. As a logical extension of this work it is considering the establishment of a \\"Tumar\\" eco-cultural center as the pilot complex of tourist, educational, and ethnographic objects. According to the Journal of Archaeological Science, in July 2020, scientists from South Ural State University studied two Late Bronze Age horses with the aid of radiocarbon dating from Kurgan 5 of the Novoilinovsky 2 cemetery. Researcher Igor Chechushkov, indicated that the Andronovites had an ability on horse riding several centuries earlier than many researchers had previously expected. Among the horses investigated, the stallion was nearly 20 years old and the mare was 18 years old. According to scientists, animals were buried with the person they accompanied throughout their lives, and they were used not only for food, but also for harnessing to vehicles and riding. \\"It is likely that militarized elite, whose power was based on the physical control of fellow tribesmen and neighbors with the help of riding and fighting skills, was buried in the Novoilinovsky-2 burial ground. The rider has a significant advantage over the infantryman. There may be another explanation: These elite fulfilled the function of mediating conflicts within the collective, and therefore had power and high social status. Metaphorically, this kind of elite can be called Sheriffs of the Bronze Age\\" said Igor Chechushkov. Blazon The coat-of-arms of Lisakovsk was adopted in 1995. The emblem depicts a blue sky with the sun. Beneath it runs a fox - the symbol of the city. Under the fox is a dark brown stripe, blended with the frame. The emblem symbolizes the ground, fertile, rich in various minerals.

History The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw the establishment of a number of historical societies in the United States, representing various immigrant groups.Joseph J. Appel, Immigrant Historical Societies in the United States, 1880‚Äì1950. New York: Arno Press, 1980. Amidst this proliferation of immigrant historical societies, Swiss Americans and those interested in them and their history had by the 1920s become disillusioned at \\"the fact that every outstanding person of Swiss origin was claimed by some other nation.‚ÄùSchelbert, Leo (2011). The Reactivated Swiss American Historical Society at Forty: A Retrospective. Among these were Ernest A. K√ºbler, Bruno Bachmann, and August R√ºedy, who on July 4, 1927, founded the Swiss American Historical Society in Chicago. By December the organization had been incorporated into the State of Illinois. The Society immediately set forth to prepare and publish several works increasing awareness of the Swiss in the United States.For example, Prominent Americans of Swiss Origin (1932) and The Swiss in the United States (1940). However, due to several factors, including the Great Depression throughout the 1930s, the Society began to decline in membership and activity. By 1937, only 48 due- paying members remained. Anti-German sentiment in the forties did little to help the Society's standing. The Society continued mostly dormant throughout the forties and fifties. =Since 1963= Beginning in 1963, with the involvement of Dr. Lukas F. Burckhardt, SAHS member and cultural counselor at the Embassy of Switzerland in Washington, Alfred Zehnder, Ambassador of Switzerland to the United States, and Heinz K. Meier, the Society began to be revitalized. By 1965, plans had been established to put out several newsletters per year, to present scholarly papers at their one business meeting per year, and to resume publishing work such as they had started at the Society‚Äôs beginning.Schelbert 2011. In 1979 the organization published an introductory guide to Swiss genealogy to facilitate research for those interested in Swiss family history. After the 1970s, the Society‚Äôs newsletter became increasingly more scholarly, and in 1990 became the Swiss American Historical Society Review, seen by the Society as a voice-giving instrument for Swiss Americans.Schelbert 2011. The Review is currently published three times a year, in February, June, and November. The journal includes book reviews, articles of interest to Swiss Americans, and summaries of Society proceedings. In addition to the Review, the Society has published thirty books; two more are in preparation.

Food As a predominantly rural county with a temperate climate, frequent rains and fertile soils, Devon has for centuries been a net exporter of high quality dairy produce, fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and fish, particularly after the nineteenth-century expansion in the railway network which enabled the fast transport of fresh goods to the cities. This tradition continues, and many food products, such as premium fish and crab landed in Brixham remain highly regarded, particularly in London. , Devon boasts a Michelin Guide two-starred restaurant at Gidleigh Park and three other one-starred establishments.

A monthly county magazine, Devon Life, regularly publishes articles on the food and drink of the county, and the Cornish & Devon Post, a newspaper published in Launceston, also publishes Cornish & Devon Farming Diary and a yearly eating and entertainment guide, Country Cuisine. =Meat and fish= A Red Devon bull The pasty is as popular in Devon as it is in Cornwall, and the earliest known record for the recipe was from the city of Plymouth in 1510, on the Devon- Cornish border. Naturally, this is one of the principal sources of rivalry between the two counties, which in fact form a cultural continuum across the Westcountry, however pasties made in Devon lack Protected Designation of Origin. White pudding is a highly spiced pork dish still popular in Devon and Cornwall, where it is known as Hog's pudding; versions are known from the West Midlands, Scotland and elsewhere. A variant version containing oats is known as \\"Groats pudding\\" and is found on Dartmoor and parts of Cornwall. Both Dartmoor and Exmoor are well known for their production of wild, free-grazing beef and lamb from regional breeds such as Red Ruby Devon Cattle, South Devon cattle, the Greyface Dartmoor and the Devon Closewool sheep. Brixham trawlers Fish and chips also remain particularly popular in the many coastal fishing ports. In New South Wales, Australia, Devon is a name for luncheon meat (processed ham) but is unknown in England. The name changes in different states of Australia (for example, 'Fritz' in South Australia, 'Polony' in Western Australia) but all describe the same type of meat. =Dairy produce= The county has given its name to a number of culinary specialities. The Devonshire cream tea, involving scones or rather Devonshire Splits, jam and clotted cream is considered to have originated in Devon (though claims have also been made for neighbouring counties); in other countries however, such as Australia and New Zealand, it is known as a \\"Devonshire tea\\".Mason, Laura; Brown, Catherine (1999) From Bath Chaps to Bara Brith. Totnes: Prospect BooksPettigrew, Jane (2004) Afternoon Tea. Andover: JarroldFitzgibbon, Theodora (1972) A Taste of England: the West Country. London: J. M. Dent Ice cream is also made by many Devon creameries and is known for its luxurious rich full cream taste. Typical flavours may include summer berries such as brambles or blackcurrant and a local favourite is 'thunder and lightning' made with sugar honeycomb and golden syrup. Ice cream is also often served with additional Devon clotted cream which changes texture when frozen. Curworthy, Sharpham and Vulscombe cheeses are all made in Devon.Mason, L. (1999); pp. 13-22 Devon Blue and Beenleigh Blue are made at a dairy on the Sharpham Estate.Freeman, Sarah (1998) The Real Cheese Companion. London: Little, Brown; (Devon cheeses; pp. 102-14) Devon Blue won an award for the best English cheese in 2011. The Ambrosia creamery with its famous tagline \\"Devon knows how they make it so creamy\\", best known for its custard and creamed rice pudding has been based in the village of Lifton since 1917. Junket is a dairy foodstuff known historically as the food of courting lovers and the base product of the initial stage of the cheesemaking process. It can occasionally still be found on traditional menus. Fudge, often made with Devon clotted cream, can be found all over Devon. =Fruit and vegetables= Potatoes feature prominently after presumably having been introduced to Devon and the rest of Europe by Sir Walter Raleigh of East Budleigh, they formed a major part of the peasant diet in the nineteenth century. An exceptional number of traditional varieties of apple are specific to Devon's ancient orchards, which shares a history of cider production with its Westcountry neighbours along with rare varieties of many other fruits including the Dittisham plum, a dessert variety grown there.Mason, L. (1999); pp. 1-2 The Tamar Valley was historically famous for its early season production of soft fruits in its sheltered south-facing valleys which were exported to London by rail. Today, Riverford distributes its produce via an organic box scheme across the whole of the UK. Drinks Cider, known as 'Cyder' or 'Scrumpy' is the traditional drink of Devon as it was in much of the Westcountry, peasants often paid an allowance of three pints per day.Peasant Life in the West of England, 1880. FG Heath One of the most famous cider producers of the 20th century was Whiteways of Whimple, East Devon. They produced many internationally famous ciders and also some non-alcoholic variants including Cydrax and Peardrax. During Whiteway's heyday they boasted the largest cyder orchards in Britain. There is now a Whiteways museum and heritage centre next to the New Fountain Inn in the village of Whimple. Three Hammers is a brand of strong white cider made in Tiverton by the Devon Cider Company. There are still a large number of cider producers in Devon A Traditional Cider Press Devon has a large number of beer breweries; two well known ones being Otter Brewery (located at Luppitt near Honiton) and Dartmoor Brewery, which, being based in Princetown on Dartmoor, is the highest brewery in England at above sea level. The Heavitree Brewery was a local brewer, located in Heavitree; its history can be traced back to 1790. It was the last brewery in Exeter to cease production, continuing until 1970, the brewery buildings were demolished in 1980. The name continues in use as the owner of a chain of pubs in south west England, and Heavitree Brewery PLC continues as a quoted company with its address in Exeter. The Plymouth Gin Distillery has been producing Plymouth Gin since 1793, which was exported around the world by the Royal Navy. During the 1930s, it was the most widely distributed gin and has a controlled term of origin. There are now a number of vineyards in Devon producing white wines, the oldest being Yearlstone Vineyard which was started in 1976 at Bickleigh in the valley of the River Exe. Others include Sharpham Vineyard, near Totnes, and Pebblebed Vineyard near Topsham. The monks of Buckfast Abbey still produce Buckfast Tonic Wine which has attracted an unlikely down-market cult status in Scotland. Devon has a strong association with the old Westcountry tradition of alcoholic cordials such as Lovage, Grenadine and Shrub. These traditional drinks and mixers are still produced today by J R Phillips of Bristol. See also * Cornish cuisine * Cuisine of Dorset References Further reading *Clark, Philippa, comp.

Littleton brand of upscale leather goods, apparel and specialty products ‚àí most handmade in his Lynnville, TN workshop by local craftsmen. His designs are sold through his Americana Collection catalog and in over 800 stores worldwide. Col. Littleton, The Great American Leather Company, was established in 1987 by Colonel. Early life and career Colonel Littleton was born Garry Allen Littleton in Camden, Tennessee to Avery (n√©e Allen) and Lester Coleman Littleton, a millwright and carpenter. His mother died shortly after his birth and he was initially raised by his grandparents, in Holladay, TN, while his father sought work in east Tennessee. His grandparents, father and stepmother Martha Littleton (n√©e Beech) instilled in him a strong work ethic and foundation of Biblical principles (he often teaches at his local Church of Christ) and he often references those early life lessons in civic talks and incorporates them in his business conduct. He graduated from Bellevue High School in Nashville, TN, attended David Lipscomb University and later served in the US Coast Guard. He married Norma Ann (Susie) Hobbs in 1975. He worked at Tom James Co., where he sold custom men‚Äôs clothing and as National Sales Director at The Benson Company (later known as Benson Records), a music publishing company in Nashville, TN. Later, he worked as an independent Manufacturer Representative, for New York based companies like Ghurka and Trafalgar, selling upscale clothing and accessories to men‚Äôs specialty stores. It was this experience, as well as his desire to produce American-made heirloom quality products, that helped forge the ideas that would become his Col. Littleton brand. Col. Littleton customers note they value the nostalgic designs and quality and many claim to use the products as hand-down heirloom gifts; a time-honored tradition. One of his customary practices is to include a MoonPie and a product story card with every order. He is known for being very patriotic and is a staunch supporter of the US Military and Boy Scouts of America. In fact, these Americana themes can often be found in his original designs, such as his unique adjustable belt and cross swords logo. He was inducted into the Tennessee State Museum, Costume & Textile Institute in 2009, is active in his community and served on the Board of Directors at the Bank of Frankewing in Tennessee. Col. Littleton No.3 Grip Business He launched his label in 1987 from the third floor attic of his home, selling antique cufflinks to specialty stores such as Paul Stuart in New York City, that appreciated his eye for the interesting. He designed the packaging, creating the cross swords logo and Col. Littleton motif that would become his brand mark. From antique cufflinks he moved into pocket knives, which he designed using mother of pearl and bone. To further make each knife individually special, the Colonel offered customers the option to engrave the handle and/or bolsters. His knives quickly became a success and were sought out by fine retailers. Over the years, the business has expanded into leather goods, home accessories, apparel, belts and more. His products have been purchased by numerous celebrities and several US Presidents. His annual catalog contains highly entertaining and intriguing stories which surround each product, and people often read every word of copy and comment on the content. There is little creative hype to his designs and customers recognize the authenticity of the brand and its Americana roots. All business is conducted and most products are handmade in the company‚Äôs Lynnville, TN-based General Office & Works, about an hour south of Nashville. In his office, he is surrounded by artifacts and antiques, which provide inspiration for his designs. His products have garnered a national and international following and can be found in upscale retailers and catalogs, such as Orvis and Sundance. Many products have received US design patents. Automobiles and historic restorations An avid collector and restorer of antique and unique automobiles, he purchased and renovated a building near his office to house his collection and serve as a restoration area. Visitors often inquire about the building and his collection and on occasion he will provide a lucky few with a glimpse inside his space. He can often be seen driving either a ‚Äô72 Chevrolet Corvette, ‚Äô27 Model T Truck, ‚Äô51 Willys Jeep or ‚Äô46 Dodge Power Wagon from his collection. He added a '41 US Army Dodge WC Series Command Car to his collection. Most weekends Colonel may be found working on the Command Car's restoration. True to his roots and brand, he added an upstairs covered balcony to his automobile building, complete with a few rocking chairs so he can sit quietly, look down Main Street of Lynnville and ponder new designs.

Retrieved 10 Apr 2014. also called Meldorf Bay (), is a bay on the coast of the North German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which forms part of the Heligoland Bight.  Location  The bay lies about 90 km (as the crow flies) northwest of Hamburg and 30 km north-northeast of Cuxhaven. It falls within the district of Dithmarschen. To the north is the North Sea resort of B√ºsum, to the south the seaside resort of Friedrichskoog, which does not however border directly onto Meldorf Bay. To the east is the village of Hemmingstedt and the town of Meldorf, which gives the bay its name. To the west the bay opens out into the North Sea. Its most important channel is the Piep, which is up to 20 metres deep and divides in Meldorf Bay into three branches: the W√∂hrdener Loch (north), the Kronenloch and the Sommerkoog-Steertloch (south).  History  As a result of several major storm floods in the late Middle Ages and early modern times, the bay expanded further and further into the low marshes and almost reached the town of Meldorf, sited on a geest ridge. Not until the 16th century was land reclaimed and the polders (K√∂ge) within the bay dyked for the first time. On 17 February 1500 the independent peasant republic of Dithmarschen fought the army of the King of Denmark and his brother at the Battle of Hemmingstedt. The king's cavalry, largely composed of nobles, was almost entirely drowned in the waters of the spring tide in Meldorf Bay.  Today  View over the northern part of Meldorf Bay from Speicherkoog Harbour looking towards B√ºsum When the last dykes were built from April 1969 to March 1978, taking in an area of about 8.5 x 8 kilometres, Meldorf Bay was left with an (estimated) area of 30 km¬≤. The construction of the latest dykes was not, however, primarily aimed at land reclamation but coastal defence. For example, by building new, 8.8 metre high dykes that were only 14.8 km long (in the core area of the bay), the crest of the dyke was raised significantly and the length of the dyke greatly shortened. The newly created Speicherkoog on Meldorf Bay is designed primarily to store water from the interior during inland flooding and to discharge it into the sea through two dyke sluices and scoop wheels. In addition, the salt marshes act as a protected sanctuary for birds. Agriculture only plays a minor role in Speicherkoog. Sheep are grazed here to help to stabilize the dykes. Both the Speicherkoog as well as the other undyked areas of Meldorf Bay belong to protection zone 1 of the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park and are therefore subject to special conservation laws.  Islands  In Meldorf Bay lies the uninhabited island of Helmsand, which is like one of the Halligen and many years ago was linked to the mainland by a causeway. It is also a bird reserve like the island of Trischen, which lies off the bay. Even the sandbanks of Blauort and Tertius may only be visited with special permission.  Human use  The immediate coastal areas are fully developed for tourism. The Norderpiep and S√ºderpiep channels provide access to the port of B√ºsum. The shrimp cutters stationed there fish Meldorf Bay as well as other areas. The southern part of the bay is used by the Bundeswehr as a weapons testing area. In the western part, just north of the Elbe estuary and the Vogelsand is a burial site for those buried at sea.Reederei Fritz Dinklage  References   Literature  * Michelsen, Hans (2008).

Through the program five neighborhood-based studios were opened to teach Atlanta citizens television production skills.Jabari Simama, Community Media Review, ‚ÄúPublic Access, Open Internet, and Civil Rights: The Human Rights Origin of Community-Based Media,‚Äù Alliance for Community Media, Washington, D.C, Spring, 2010, Vol #33, Number 1. http://www.alliancecm.org/cmr/human-rights/public-access-open-internet-and- civil-rights-human-rights-origin-community-based-me At the end of 1986, Simama left the cable company and ran for elected office for the Atlanta City Council. In 1987, he won and became the first African American elected in the South with an African name. He served two terms as the District 3 council member, before embarking on an unsuccessful campaign for council president. In 1994 he became a columnist for Creative Loafing (Atlanta), and as co-author of a series of articles entitled \\"Outside the Fences\\" in 1996 he won third place for the Alternative Newsweeklies Association (AAN). He published the weekly column until 1998. During this same period he was a Visiting Professor in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He taught a course on Race and New Media and conducted research, which was featured in John Barber‚Äôs book, The Information Society and the Black Community.The Information Society and the Black Community, \\"Race, Politics, and Pedagogy of New Media: From Civil Rights to Cyber Rights\\" ed. John Barber, 2001 He returned to the City of Atlanta in 1998 in the position of Director of Communications where he was responsible for all communications and marketing for the city. During his tenure as Director of Communications, he negotiated an 8 million dollar deal with AT&T; and Media One to fund a citywide program designed to bridge the digital divide.The Black Digital Elite, by John Barber, 2006 The City Cyber Program included multiple sites such as recreation centers, libraries, one historical black college, and a cyber bus that brought mobile broadband technology directly to local communities. In 2003, the cyber bus became the operations center for a forum sponsored for U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein. In 2005, Simama left government and returned to education as Vice President for Community Development and External Affairs and Executive Assistant to the President at Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina. There Simama continued his work in community technology, sponsoring four annual summits on Broadband in Cities and Towns. The summits attracted participants from around the country and focused on the idea of expanding broadband to unserved and under-served communities. In June 2009, Simama returned to Atlanta and began working as the Deputy Chief Operating Officer of Development for DeKalb County and Chief of Staff, the third largest county in Georgia. where remained until August, 2012. Simama served as President of Georgia Piedmont Technical College from 2012-2018. The college, which used to be DeKalb Technical College, is located in Clarkston, Georgia. Simama is currently retired and writes a weekly blog on issues of politics, culture and maleness. *Civil Rights to Cyber Rights: Broadband & Digital Equality in the Age of Obama, (2009) *The Information Society and the Black Community, \\"Race, Politics, and Pedagogy of New Media: From Civil Rights to Cyber Rights\\" ed.

The song was composed by Joseph \\"Joe\\" Brooks and served as the title song for the 1978 film If Ever I See You Again, which Brooks directed and also starred in with Shelley Hack as his leading lady. Male vocalist Jamie Carr sang the theme song on the film's soundtrack. Brooks' directorial debut, You Light Up My Life, had become successful largely on the strength of its title song, which as recorded by Debby Boone had spent ten weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977. With Brooks producing, Debby Boone had subsequently recorded the If Ever I See You Again title song plus four other songs heard in the film: \\"California\\", \\"Come Share My Love\\", \\"It Was Such a Good Day\\" and \\"When It's Over\\", at the Hollywood recording studio the Record Plant in January 1978, with the track \\"California\\" being issued as Boone's follow-up single to \\"You Light Up My Life\\" in February 1978 to reach #50 on the Hot 100. Boone's version of the If Ever I See You Again title song, plus the four other songs from the film that she'd recorded, would be included on her July 1978 album release Midstream. Despite Boone's success with the theme song from You Light Up My Life, Brooks was hoping to place the If Ever I See You Again theme song plus other songs from the film with an established artist. According to his partner Robert K. Lifton, Brooks offered the If Ever I See You Again numbers to Arista Records president Clive Davis for Barry Manilow to record only to renege after hearing the existing tracks intended for Manilow's upcoming album, which Brooks felt were sub-par and would sink his own compositions (in fact Manilow's 1978 album release Even Now would be a triple platinum seller). Brooks then approached Atlantic Records president Jerry Greenberg with the intent of having the If Ever I See You Again theme song and other songs from the film recorded by Roberta Flack (Flack has stated that she had been offered \\"You Light Up My Life\\" prior to the Debby Boone recording: (Roberta Flack:)\\"Some people whose opinions I respect very much suggested I should do it...but the song reminded me of too many other things that I had heard or sung and I just didn't like it [although] I think [for] Debby Boone ['You Light Up My Life'] was perfect\\".Chicago Tribune 29 June 1980 \\"Roberta Flack: Grammy winner on the road & on the charts\\" by Lynn van Matre pp.4,13 (Section 6) Flack would eventually describe \\"If Ever I See You Again\\" as \\"a song I couldn't stand\\" that Greenberg insisted she record: (Roberta Flack quote:) \\"I had a very clever lawyer who made a huge money deal for [my recording] that song\\":Vibe Vol. 11 #1 (January 2003) p.40 Flack recorded \\"If Ever I See You Again\\" at A&R; Recording Studios in New York City in a session produced by Brooks which also yielded Flack's versions of \\"Come Share My Love\\" and \\"When It's Over\\". With a track from Flack's 1977 Blue Lights in the Basement album: \\"I'd Like To Be Baby To You\\", as B-side, \\"If Ever I See You Again\\" was released as a single in 21 April 1978 - a month before the film's premiere - to debut the Billboard Hot 100 dated 20 May 1978 at #87 (the same chart ranked the Blue Lights in the Basement single: the Donny Hathaway duet \\"The Closer I Get to You\\" at its #2 peak for a second and final week). With the film If Ever I See You Again quickly proving a massive flop, Flack's single was left to fare on its own merit, and did in July 1978 spend three weeks at No. 1 on the Easy Listening chart with an eventual ranking as the #8 Easy Listening hit for the year: however, while reaching the Top 40 on both the Pop-oriented Hot 100 and the R&B; chart, \\"If Ever I See You Again\\" was not on either chart afforded the impact which had previously been customary for Flack's lead singles, the Hot 100 peak for \\"If Ever I See You Again\\" being #24 with its R&B; peak being #37. On the pop-oriented singles charts published in both Cashbox and Record World, \\"If Ever I See You Again\\" peaked at #38, with the single's peak on the respective magazines' R&B; charts being #37 (Cashbox) and #58 (Record World)). \\"If Ever I See You Again\\" was included on the August 1978 album release Roberta Flack - the planned album title of If Ever I See You Again being dropped due to the single's underperformance - , that album also including the two other tracks cut with Joe Brooks at A&R; Studios: \\"Come Share My Love\\" and \\"When It's Over\\", the two latter tracks being issued on a single in October 1978 with the A-side \\"When It's Over\\" reaching #82 on the R&B; chart. From 1979 Flack would tend to rank on the R&B; chart as opposed to the Hot 100, her only solo Hot 100 entry subsequent to \\"If Ever I See You Again\\" being another movie theme song: \\"Making Love\\", which peaked at #13 in 1982. However Flack did reach the Top 20 of the Hot 100 with two duets: \\"Tonight, I Celebrate My Love\\" with Peabo Bryson (#16/ 1983) and \\"Set the Night to Music\\" with Maxi Priest (#6/ 1991).

It is written by Lance Kinsey and Peter Nelson. It is directed by Harry Basil. The plot centers around boy genius, Michael Dean (Adkins), who teams up with a super-talented chimpanzee and his caretaker (Modine) to take down an animal testing lab. Plot The story is about Alec McCall (Matthew Modine), a spy, who teams up with Clements, a chimp, to save the day. He has a change of heart when his boss, Flick, turns out to be bad and wants to perform experiments on the chimp. These experiments are to create chimp soldiers for the highest bidder. McCall takes Clements away on the run to his hometown, where they meet a genius boy named Michael (Seth Adkins). Michael wants to impress a girl by playing on the football team. The coach (Jeffrey Tambor) allows him on the team only if he tutors the star players who are on the brink of being kicked off due to bad grades. Meanwhile, Flick sends his goons out to find the chimp. Michael's single mom, Megan, a computer programmer, has her eye on McCall, who rents out a room from her. She does not know about Clements, but Michael does. After the goons fail to get the chimp, Flick goes to get Clements himself by breaking in and gassing Clements and Michael. Flick takes them back to his headquarters so the doctor (Gilbert Gottfried) can perform his experiments. McCall rescues them and they head back for the Homecoming football game. Soon the bad guys show up and dress as football players to play in the game and get Clements. Clements and McCall join the team to stop Flick from winning. Michael wins the game, and Flick and his henchmen are arrested for animal cruelty. Michael gets the girl and McCall gets Megan. Cast Reception Funky Monkey received negative reviews from critics. Although the film was originally intended for a theatrical release, it ended up being dumped straight-to-video despite its $30 million budget.

The rim of the caldera forms well-developed circular ridge of altered and indurated Karroo sandstones (gritstones) rising approximately 500 m above the plain of unaltered Karroo sediments. Due to hardness of altered Karroo sediments, after continuous, long-time erosion, Monte Muambe at present is well-developed circular ridge (caldera), basin-shaped, steep-sided and crater-like depression inside. The core of the circular structure is 200 m lower from its periphery.  Geology of adjacent area  The region of Monte Muambe is situated on southern margin of the Tete gabbro-diorite complex of Precambrian ages, in a depression filled in Mesozoik by sediments and volcanic activity products of the Karroo System. = Karroo System = Karroo sediments are in tectonic relationship with older rocks. The boundary of the Tete gabbro-diorite complex is E -W striking dislocation. These sediments form an east-west trending belt, gently dipping to southeast in the sedimentary formation and volcanic rocks of Monte Muambe area. The succession normally progress from north to the south. From the oldest formations in the north as represented by Serie Tilitos ad Serie Produtiva with coal seams (Beaufort), sedimentation progressed continuously to fossiliferous sandstones, often cross-bedded, including clay-marly beds (Stromberg) - which closed the Karroo sedimentation. Volcanic formation of Stromberg Series consists of amygdaloid basalts plates in the form of lava flows over Karroo sandstones, and dolerite in the form of dykes. Post-Karroo deposits are commonly represented by sandstones and conglomerates with interstratified Mesozoic or younger volcanic rocks. In the Monte Muambe region they are recognized as rocks of Lupata Series. This geologic formation is divided into Lower Lupata Sandstones and Upper Lupata Series. Older sandstones consider to include also rhyolite and younger include alkaline rocks. Only the Upper Lupata Sandstones are developed in Monte Muambe region. The formation consists of two members: clastic, mostly feldspathic various grained sandstones, and volcano erupted - alkali lavas. The intrusive members are syenite and carbonatite. The complete sedimentary sequence is separated in Lupata region, about 10 km southeast of Monte Muambe, in Chincongolo area, near to Lupata Gorge, and consists of Upper Lupata Sandstones formation, intrusive rocks (syenite), carbonatites (intrusive and effusive products) and alkaline extrusive rocks. According to field findings geological units in the region as follows: 1\\\\. Coarse-grained and conglomeratic sandstones which transressive overlain basalts, gently dipping to the south. 2\\\\. Agglomerates which developed from sandstones are composed mainly of fragments of Karroo sediments, volcanic carbonatite material, and syenite fragments - cemented with carbonate. The pyroclastic series base consists of agglomerate with carbonatite volcanic bombs and lapilii. 3\\\\. Alkali lava flows which cover sedimentary sequence forming tabular igneous bodies elongated to south, represented by rhomb porphyry trachytes and hyalotrahytes Summarized the major events and characteristics of Lupata Series their time of extent was from Lower Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous, and from that time Monte Muambe, as a part of volcanic system of the East African Rift, represent carbonatite extinct volcano  Carbonatitic Complex  During the Lupate Series formation, in the phase of alkali magmatism, syenite and later carbonatite were also intruded. The concave bottom of caldera, about 5 km in diameter, consists of carbonatite, agglomerate, tuff, feldspathic rocks (fenites) and basic dykes. The bottom periphery, 0.5 km wide, is mostly built of feldspathic rocks and little or no carbonatite. The central circular part of highly dissected, craggy hills of carbonatite is asymmetrical and about 200 m lower than Karroo ridge. It is composed of relics of carbonatite intrusion, now appearing as carbonatite ring and subsided central part. The carbonatite ring is characterized by vertical scarps on inner side, with surface which often shows irregular knots, nodes, or veins of more resistant (silicate) material. Laterite covers are formed on both sides of carbonatite ring with accumulation of residual ferruginous-manganese minerals. Carbonatitic rocks are characterized by considerable variation, or great variety of textures, while the mineral composition is quite uniform and chiefly independent of texture. According to texture of carbonatite, can be distinguished: hypidiomorphic granular, medium-grained, pseudoporphyric and trachytic. The most abundant are carbonatites with granular texture, while porphyric and trachytoid carbonatites are much less abundant. Porphyric carbonatite are formed by fast cooling of semi-crystallized magma, or in contact with cool environment. The primary crystallized and fast crystallized calcites form phenocrysts and fine- grained groundmass, respectively. The slower cooled magma obtained granular texture. Carbonatitic magma was probably separated during the differentiation and crystallization of syenites and alkali basic rocks. The primary silicate magma was enriched with alkalies, carbon-dioxide, calcium and deficient with silica. During the alkali syenite crystallization, the carbonate portion of silicate magma was separated forming carbonatitic magma. Alkalies were already linked with feldspars and feldspathoids both in alkali syenites and in metasomatic fenites to be contained by residual carbonate. That is why carbonatites contained very low alkalies. The carbonatitic magma, after the melt separation, was intruded in Karroo sandstones, or earlier formed fenites. The bottom periphery of caldera, 0.5 km wide, is mostly built of feldspathic rocks (fenites), and little or no carbonatite. Under the name the fenites, several types of rocks are separated: fenised sandstones, syenite-fenite, syenite-fenite with nepheline, and feldspar breccias. The fenised sandstones and syenite-fenite form aureoles around carbonatites. The main characteristic for all fenites is metasomatic substitution and replacement of primary constituents by K-feldspar minerals. At the end of carbonatitic volcano activity, hydrothermal stage have led to the formation of exploitable mineral resources, both in carbonatites and fenites.

Definition  Musar literature is often described as \\"ethical literature.\\" Professors Isaiah Tishby and Joseph Dan have described it more precisely as \\"prose literature that presents to a wide public views, ideas, and ways of life in order to shape the everyday behavior, thought, and beliefs of this public.\\"Isaiah Tishby and Joseph Dan, Mivhar sifrut ha-mussar (Jerusalem, 1970), 12. Musar literature traditionally depicts the nature of moral and spiritual perfection in a methodical way. It is \\"divided according to the component parts of the ideal righteous way of life; the material is treated methodically ‚Äì analyzing, explaining, and demonstrating how to achieve each moral virtue (usually treated in a separate chapter or section) in the author's ethical system.\\"Joseph Dan, \\"Ethical Literature\\" Encyclopaedia Judaica, ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik, 2nd ed., vol. 6. Musar literature can be distinguished from other forms of Jewish ethical literature such as aggadic narrative and halakhic literature.  Early Musar literature  In Judaism, ethical monotheism originated, and along with it came the highly didactic ethics in the Torah and Tanach. An example from the Tanakh is the earliest known text of the positive form of the famous \\"Golden Rule\\":Gunther Plaut, The Torah ‚Äî A Modern Commentary; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, New York 1981; pp.892. Hillel the Elder (c. 110 BCE ‚Äì 10 CE),Jewish Encyclopedia: Hillel: \\"His activity of forty years is perhaps historical; and since it began, according to a trustworthy tradition (Shab. 15a), one hundred years before the destruction of Jerusalem, it must have covered the period 30 B.C.E. -10 C.E.\\" used this verse as a most important message of the Torah for his teachings. Once, he was challenged by a ger toshav who asked to be converted under the condition that the Torah be explained to him while he stood on one foot. Hillel accepted him as a candidate for conversion to Judaism but, drawing on , briefed the man: Pirkei Avot is a compilation of the ethical teachings and maxims of the Rabbis of the Mishnaic period. It is part of didactic Jewish ethical Musar literature. Because of its contents, it is also called Ethics of the Fathers. The teachings of Pirkei Avot appear in the Mishnaic tractate of Avot, the second- to-last tractate in the order of Nezikin in the Mishnah. Pirkei Avot is unique in that it is the only tractate of the Mishnah dealing solely with ethical and moral principles; there is little or no halacha found in Pirkei Avot.  Medieval Musar literature  Medieval works of Musar literature were composed by a range of rabbis and others, including rationalist philosophers and adherents of Kabbalistic mysticism. Joseph Dan has argued that medieval Musar literature reflects four different approaches: the philosophical approach; the standard rabbinic approaches; the approach of Chassidei Ashkenaz; and the Kabbalistic approach. = Philosophical Musar literature = Tikkun Middot ha- Nefesh-The Improvement of the Moral Qualities, by Solomon Ibn Gabirol, Hebrew version 1167. 1869 edition Philosophical works of Musar include: *Chovot ha- Levavot by Bahya ibn Paquda * Hilchot Deot in Sefer ha-Madah of Mishneh Torah by Maimonides * Shemona perakim (\\"The Eight Chapters\\"):, the introduction to Pirkei Avot in Maimonides' commentary to the Mishneh. = Standard Rabbinic Musar literature = Orchot Tzaddikim-The Ways of the Righteous, anonymous author. First Hebrew edition, Prague 1581 Rabbinic Musar literature came as a reaction to philosophical literature, and tried to show that the Torah and standard rabbinic literature taught about the nature of virtue and vice without recourse to Aristotelian or other philosophical concepts. Classic works of this sort include * Ma'alot ha-Middot by Rabbi Yehiel ben Yekutiel Anav of Rome * Shaarei Teshuvah (The Gates of Repentance) by Rabbi Yonah Gerondi * Menorat ha-Ma'or by Israel Al-Nakawa b. Joseph of Toledo * Menorat ha-Ma'or by Isaac Aboab * Orchot Tzaddikim (The Ways of the Righteous), by an anonymous author * Meneket Rivkah by Rebecca bat Meir Tiktiner Similar works were produced by rabbis who were Kabbalists but whose Musar writings did not bear a kabbalistic character: Nahmanides' Sha'ar ha-Gemul, which focuses on various categories of just and wicked people and their punishments in the world to come; and Rabbi Bahya ben Asher's Kad ha-Kemah. = Medieval Kabbalistic Musar literature = Explicitly Kabbalistic mystical works of Musar literature include Tomer Devorah (The Palm Tree of Deborah) by Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, Reshit Chochmah by Eliyahu de Vidas, and Kav ha-Yashar by Zevi Hirsch Koidonover. = Medieval Ashkenazi-Hasidic Musar literature = Chassidei Ashkenaz (literally \\"the Pious of Germany\\") was a Jewish movement in the 12th century and 13th century founded by Rabbi Judah the Pious (Rabbi Yehuda HeChassid) of Regensburg, Germany, which was concerned with promoting Jewish piety and morality. The most famous work of Musar literature produced by this school was The Book of the Pious (Sefer Hasidim).  Modern Musar literature  Literature in the genre of Musar literature continued to be written by modern Jews from a variety of backgrounds. = Mesillat Yesharim = Mesilat Yesharim (Path of the Just): cover page Mesillat Yesharim is a Musar text published in Amsterdam by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in the 18th century. Mesillat Yesharim is perhaps the most important work of Musar literature of the post-medieval period. The Vilna Gaon commented that he couldn't find a superfluous word in the first seven chapters of the work, and stated that he would have traveled to meet the author and learn from his ways if he'd still been alive. = Ottoman Musar literature = According to Julia Phillips Cohen, summarizing the work of Matthias B. Lehmann on Musar literature in Ottoman Sephardic society: > Beginning in the eighteenth century, a number of Ottoman rabbis had > undertaken the task of fighting the ignorance they believed was plaguing > their communities by producing works of Jewish ethics (musar) in Judeo- > Spanish (also known as Ladino). This development was inspired in part by a > particular strain within Jewish mysticism (Lurianic Kabbalah) which > suggested that every Jew would necessarily play a role in the mending of the > world required for redemption. The spread of ignorance among their > coreligionists thus threatened to undo the proper order of things. It was > with this in mind that these Ottoman rabbis--all capable of publishing in > the more highly esteemed Hebrew language of their religious tradition--chose > to write in their vernacular instead. While they democratized rabbinic > knowledge by translating it for the masses, these \\"vernacular rabbis\\" (to > use Matthias Lehmann's term) also attempted to instill in their audiences > the sense that their texts required the mediation of individuals with > religious training. Thus, they explained that common people should gather > together to read their books in meldados, or study sessions, always with the > guidance of someone trained in the study of Jewish law.Julia Phillips Cohen, > http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=26171 Among the most popular works of Musar literature produced in Ottoman society was Elijah ha-Kohen's Shevet Musar, first published in Ladino in 1748.Matthias B. Lehmann, Ladino rabbinic literature and Ottoman Sephardic culture, 6, 9 Pele Yoetz by Rabbi Eliezer Papo (1785‚Äì1826) was another exemplary work of this genre. = Haskalah Musar literature = In Europe, significant contributions to Musar literature were made by leaders of the Haskalah.Shmuel Feiner, David Jan Sorkin, New perspectives on the Haskalah, page 49David Sorkin, The transformation of German Jewry, 1780-1840, page 46 Naphtali Hirz Wessely wrote a Musar text titled Sefer Ha-Middot (Book of Virtues) in approximately 1786. Menachem Mendel Lefin of Satanov wrote a text titled Cheshbon Ha-Nefesh (Moral Accounting) in 1809, based in part on the ethical program described in the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin.Nancy Sinkoff, Out of the shtetl: making Jews modern in the Polish borderlands, 136-142 = Hasidic and Mitnagdic Musar literature = One form of literature in the Hasidic movement were tracts collecting and instructing mystical-ethical practices. These include Tzavaat HaRivash (\\"Testament of Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem\\") and Tzetl Koton by Elimelech of Lizhensk, a seventeen-point program on how to be a good Jew. Rabbi Nachman of Breslov's Sefer ha-Middot is a Hasidic classic of Musar literature. The \\"Musar letter\\" of the Vilna Gaon, an ethical will by an opponent of the Hasidic movement, is regarded by some as a classic of Musar literature.\\"The Mussar Way\\" , Mussar Institute website, accessed 11-22-2010 = Literature by the Musar movement = The modern Musar movement, beginning in the 19th century, encouraged the organised study of medieval Musar literature to an unprecedented degree, while also producing its own Musar literature. Significant Musar writings were produced by leaders of the movement such as Israel Salanter, Simcha Zissel Ziv, Yosef Yozel Horwitz, and Eliyahu Dessler. The movement established Mussar learning as a regular part of the curriculum in the Lithuanian Yeshiva world, acting as a bulwark against contemporary forces of secularism.

It is the sequel to Trine and was released on Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in December 2011, and later for Linux in March 2012. Trine 2 allows three players to play the iconic roles of a wizard, a thief, and a knight in a simultaneous cooperative mode. A Director's Cut edition was released via the Wii U's eShop on the console's launch day in all regions except Australia and Japan. The game was also released as a launch title for the PlayStation 4 in North America and Europe in 2013. On February 13, 2019, it was announced that a port to the Nintendo Switch would be released on February 18, 2019.  Gameplay  Trine 2 is a puzzle platform video game, requiring the player to use the skills of the three characters, Amadeus the wizard, Zoya the thief, and Pontius the knight, to navigate each game level. As with the first game, the mystical \\"Trine\\" has bound the three characters together into one common entity, and thus the player controls only one character which can be switched to the other two at any time. Each of the characters has unique abilities: Amadeus can use magic to grab onto certain objects in the game world, and create boxes and planks to be used to get around; Zoya can strike at objects with her arrows, and grapple onto certain surfaces; and Pontius is strong in combat against foes, can bash apart walls, and deflect projectiles with his shield. A combination of these elements is necessary to complete each stage in the game's world. Characters have individual life meters, and if one character's meter depletes, that character cannot be used until the next checkpoint is reached. If all three characters lose their life meter, the player must start back at the last checkpoint. Throughout the game world are special magical vials, and for every fifty of these collected, the player receives a skill point, which can be used to gain abilities through a skill tree for each character. These skill points can be used collectively for each of the three characters, and can be traded between them. Trine 2 also supports up to three players in a cooperative mode. In this mode, each player controls one of the three characters, but all must be unique; three players will be forced to play as Amadeus, Zoya, and Pontius. Two players can switch characters as long as both agree to the swap. If a character dies, the other players can revive the character at the next checkpoint. The skill tree is shared among all characters, based on the hosting player's saved game. Story elements are incorporated into the game through the use of an all knowing narrator (voiced by Terry Wilton) as well as in-game scripted sequences. Scattered throughout the levels are also letters, poems, and documents which further flesh out the backstory and provide additional insight into the game's characters.  Plot  = Original game = The three heroes of the Trine series depicted in Trine 2 Trine 2 takes places some years after the restoration of the kingdom of the previous game and opens with Amadeus (voiced by Kevin Howarth) sleeping after a long night trying to once again learn the elusive fireball spell. A strange light shines upon him, and beckons him to follow. Although somewhat perturbed, the wizard's curiosity overcomes his fear as he pursues the unearthly glow, which eventually reveals itself to be the Trine. Upon his arrival Pontius (voiced by Brian Bowles) appears, the Trine having already summoned him after he protected peasant farms from magically overgrown vines, and informs Amadeus that they are needed once more. The wizard is less than thrilled, not wanting to leave his wife and kids, but the knight eventually persuades Amadeus that he must come. They then reunite with Zoya (voiced by Vicky Krueger) and the Trine starts them on their adventure, taking them to a mysterious wilderness of which they had never heard of or seen before. The three heroes are immediately thrown into action after being attacked by bands of goblins. Along the way they encounter, of all things, a talking flower, which tasks them with finding her sister at the other side of the forest. The three heroes slowly discover the path out, while a mysterious figure (mentioned by the goblins simply as \\"The Witch\\") is overlooking their progress. The trio then enter an eerie tree house, which Amadeus believes to be the home of a witch. After bypassing several traps meant to keep out the goblins, they finally meet the mysterious person who has been watching them all this time. She reveals herself as the crown princess Rosabel (voiced by Charlotte Moore), and asks the heroes to help her rid the kingdom of all the evil that has befallen it, to which the three agree readily. This includes going to her once glamorous castle which has been taken over by the goblins, where the Goblin King now resides. After the three find and slay the great goblin, Zoya convinces the others to take a look around for treasure. The three heroes navigate platforms being held aloft by a giant octopus in this scene from the Searock Castle chapter. Through a series of book entries, looted poems, and narrative scattered around the levels, a story of two sisters, Rosabel and Isabel (voiced by Alix Wilton Regan), unfolds. They begin with the sisters at the ages of eight and nine, with both of them initially being quite close. The two were talented at magic, but as the stories progress into their later years it becomes clear that it was Isabel that got the most attention, received nicer gifts, and was eventually chosen as Queen. Rosabel, looking on as her sister got the attention and ever increasing status, becomes increasingly jealous and a tad vengeful. On her birthday, Isabel is invited to a 'surprise party' by her sister. Taken to a secret hiding place where they used to play as small children, she is imprisoned by Rosabel and is held captive by an enchanted tree under an irreversible sleep spell. The forest however, starts to rob Isabel of her magical powers, causing all plant and animal life to overgrow. This put the kingdom under unbalance, allowing the goblins to conquer it. After observing the heroes and the Trine, Rosabel wishes to use the powers of the artifact to save Isabel and restore the kingdom. The heroic trio eventually come to realize that Isabel is being held hostage, and decide to confront Rosabel. After unsuccessfully trying to get the heroes to hand over the Trine, she imprisons them in the goblins dungeons. They quickly make their escape and, along the way, overhear goblins talk that the forest's growth has reached their homeland and that the monsters plan to attack. With Isabel using her powers to allow the forest to help them travel, they soon return to Rosabel's tree house. Rosabel summons her pet dragon to take care of the three heroes and steal the Trine, but they manage to defeat the creature and Rosabel, who falls into a lake. This awakens Isabel who quickly dives in to save her sister despite all she had been put through. She reappears with Rosabel's body, but whether she survived is unclear. Isabel then thanks the heroes for their service and the Trine appears to help everyone one last time. Amadeus, Pontius, and Zoya are then teleported back to the forest where their adventure began. The game ends with them sitting by a campfire sharing stories of their grand adventure before finally travelling back to their homes for the night. Isabel and Rosabel's fate are left open, though it is explained that without Isabel's magic, the forest and her kingdom will eventually recover and that the heroes' own homeland is now once again safe. = Goblin Menace expansion = Zoya and Pontius battle a shaman in this scene from the Cloudy Isles chapter, part of the Goblin Menace expansion. The heroes return home after saving Isabel's kingdom, yet they fail to realize they forgot to deal with the invasion on their homeland planned by the goblins they encountered in the wilderness. While relaxing in a tavern, the attack begins, and the three decide to reach the town walls to help defend the city; unbeknownst to them, however, a band of goblins has been dispatched to Amadeus's cottage to kidnap his (very scornful) wife Margaret. The trio reach the walls and fight a goblin siege engine, but then the goblin leader, an inventor named Wheeze, appears and shows their hostage (who angrily demands her husband to save her). Their hands tied, the heroes are captured by a wyvern which spirits them away. They are left next to a temple in a distant desert, but are somewhat perplexed as they are still bound by the Trine's magic yet the artifact is nowhere to be seen and guide them as it did before. Exploring the temple, they discover it was built by an ancient goblin civilization that was destroyed by desert worms; they also find a mural depicting a human-like deity worshipped by the goblins. As they are leaving the temple, they are surprised and eaten alive by such a worm. The three manage to escape from the belly of the beast and find themselves close to a factory of flying machines used by the goblins, where they overhear that Wheeze is building a battle tank on the floating Cloudy Isles. The heroes steal a flying carriage and set course to the Isles. On Cloudy Isles, they confront and defeat Wheeze, then search for Margaret. As it turns out, the Trine was keeping her safe all along by shielding her in light. Pontius realizes that the goblins may have kidnapped her due to her resemblance to the ancient goblin deity. Relieved, Amadeus thanks the Trine and the heroes hope they can return home without starting a new adventure on the way.  Development  The Humble Frozenbyte Bundle, one of the Humble Bundles, started on April 12, 2011 and featured five games from Frozenbyte, including the original Trine, as well as the games Shadowgrounds and Shadowgrounds: Survivor. It also contained an executable version along with source code for an unfinished game, Jack Claw, and a pre-order for their upcoming game, Splot. By April 22, 2011, the Humble Frozenbyte Bundle had surpassed $700,000. Most of the money generated by the sale went to finishing the development of Trine 2 after it was suggested by lead developer, Mike Donovan, that a sequel be made. The Linux version was delayed from the rest to allow for additional development; it was the first Frozenbyte title ported to Linux in-house, with their other games having previously been ported instead by Alternative Games. Jukka Kokkonen, Frozenbyte‚Äôs Senior Programmer, revealed that the actual porting was actually \\"easier than expected\\", although he did comment that they had some trouble with testing. The port was released as a beta in late March, and is to be released on services including Desura and Gameolith. Kokkonen stated that he hopes that Trine 2 \\"shows that Linux can provide a proper gaming experience\\" and that they are \\"very excited to see how Linux users react to the game.‚Äù The basic porting process for the Wii U's Director's Cut edition was achieved by Frozenbyte in just two days, which gave the development team plenty of time to adjust visuals and implement the exclusive touch screen functionality, and subsequently made the game ready to be launched alongside the Wii U console launch date in all regions. According to Frozenbyte's sales and marketing manager Mikael Haveri, Nintendo's initial approach and close contact with their company helped support the process of releasing the game for Wii U, and subsequently made it Frozenbyte's first self-published title without the involvement of Atlus, the game's publisher for other platforms. The support for Trine 2: Director's Cut is cited as one of Nintendo's initial steps into reaching out to the independent video game development community. Haveri adds that working with Nintendo has been \\"very freeform\\" and positive.  Expansions  = Goblin Menace expansion = An expansion pack for the game entitled Trine 2: Goblin Menace was released September 7, 2012. It features six new levels, a new story, and several new skills which will also be available in the original game. Frozenbyte marketing director Mikael Haveri has also revealed that it will also feature several new puzzles based on light, water, low gravity and magnetic elements. The expansion, originally only released for the PC platforms, will be included alongside the Wii U release of the game, and the Wii U is the only non-PC console planned to receive this expansion. On February 7, 2013, a Frozebyte representative reported on their website that due to relatively poor sales for Trine 2 on Xbox 360 Live Arcade and PlayStation 3 Network, the conversion for the expansion for these consoles would not be cost effective, thus Trine 2: Goblin Menace will not likely be seen on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 in the foreseen future. = Director's Cut edition = Pontius navigates platforms dangling over a pit of lava in this scene from the Dwarven Caverns chapter. The Trine 2: Director's Cut edition, released at first only for Nintendo's Wii U console, features the original game with the Goblin Menace expansion, alongside the enhanced controls that take advantage of the GamePad controller, as well as an exclusive level called the \\"Dwarven Caverns\\". A multiplayer mode called Magic Mayhem was in development at one point but was later scrapped in favor of more focus on the Dwarven Caverns level. Director's Cut edition also features a flexible control scheme, especially for the game's multiplayer mode which is both local and online, where players can, alongside the GamePad, use Wii Remotes, Nunchuks, Wii U Pro Controllers, and even the original Wii Classic Controllers. Additionally, Frozenbyte has plans to include some Miiverse support at some point in the future, with Mikael Haveri citing that \\"it's opening up the possibilities of what you can do in terms of interaction with other players and so on.\\" Other additions include minor things such as patching support, although the patching process is currently unknown at this time. The Wii U release is the only version of Trine 2 to be available in Japan, released on January 22, 2014 under the title . The Japanese release was a courtesy of Nintendo. = Complete Story edition = A patch released June 6, 2013 for the Steam version of Trine 2 upgraded it to the Trine 2: Complete Story edition, if the Goblin Menace expansion had been previously purchased. This new edition includes the Dwarven Caverns level previously available only in the Director's Cut version from the Wii U. A cross-platform and DRM free release of Trine 2: Complete Story was then later made available as part of Humble Indie Bundle 9. The Complete Story edition was subsequently released on PlayStation 4 in 2013.  Reception  Trine 2 received largely positive reviews, earning a score of 9/10 by IGN, and 84/100 for the Windows and Wii U versions on Metacritic, as well as a score of 85/100 for the game's release on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. By October 2014, Frozenbyte announced that the Trine series had sold over seven million copies worldwide.

He was forced to step down in the wake of charges of professional misconduct and financial irregularities. Alvarado was born on June 10, 1942, in the South Bronx, where he attended St. Anselm's Catholic School and Fordham Preparatory School. He earned a bachelor's and master's degree in English from Fordham University, and took additional education classwork at Hunter College. He started in the New York City Public Schools in a school in the Bronx and spent a year teaching at James Monroe High School. After a series of administrative positions and promotions at Board of Education headquarters on Livingston Street and in District 9, he was named in 1973 as superintendent of District 4, which covered the largely African American and Hispanic community of East Harlem in Manhattan.Chambers, Marcia. \\"MAN IN THE NEWS; AN INNOVATIVE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR: ANTHONY JOHN ALVARADO\\", The New York Times, April 29, 1983. Accessed July 27, 2010. During a decade heading the 14,000-student District 4, Alvarado established school-within-a-school programs that allowed students to specialize in their preferred area of interest, a program that helped attract attendance from students living outside the district. During his tenure in the district, twice as many students were reading at grade level, growing from 25% to 48% from 1979 to 1982. In recognition of his accomplishments, he received a $5,000 award in 1981 from the Fund for the City of New York. Alvarado replaced many of the supervisory positions in the district with Hispanic educators. A 1975 complaint against the district filed with the New York State Division of Human Rights found that the district had discriminated when it replaced a white school principal and ordered that he be reinstated with back pay and full seniority. The president of the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, which represents supervisors told The New York Times that there had been other conflicts with Alvarado regarding his staffing changes at the assistant principal and principal level. In 1977, then-Chancellor Irving Anker criticized the number of highly paid administrators on the district's staff, though Alvarado argued that they were necessary to put into place the academic changes and improvements he implemented and that spending was in line with that of other districts. Alvarado was named as New York City School Chancellor in April 1983. He committed himself to improving New York City's public high schools and sought to implement in the city's 32 school districts many of the innovations he had planned in District 4. In a report issued in March 1984 by the New York City Department of Investigation, Alvarado was charged with borrowing $88,000 from employees under his supervision \\"in a manner that was inherently coercive and frequently deceptive\\", that he allowed employees who had loaned him money to earn excessive amounts of overtime pay and had used school employees for personal purposes, including having his house painted by district employees. He was also charged with having made false statements on loan applications, failing to pay parking tickets and property taxes, and for a failure to report $128,000 in capital gains and tax refunds on filings with the Internal Revenue Service. Alvarado said that many of the violations were of a technical nature and occurred because he was busy working 60 to 80 hours a week as Schools Chancellor. Citing the example of paying to have his office painted out of funds that had been designated for overtime pay, Alvarado argued that \\"in choosing whether to get work accomplished or not violate a technical procedure, I chose to get the job done\\". Alvarado told Time magazine that he \\"never used public funds or the public system for personal gain\\".Staff. \\"Education: An Innovator in Trouble\\", Time (magazine), April 9, 1984.

Alvarado resigned as School Chancellor in May 1984 in the wake of professional misconduct charges and Nathan Quinones was selected as Chancellor, having served in the position on an interim basis after Alvarado placed himself on leave two months earlier. While Quinones had been relegated to a minor role under Alvarado, once Quinones became acting Chancellor he removed several administrators tied to Alvarado and restored the structure of high school administration that Alvarado had eliminated.via Associated Press. \\"Alvarado resigns N.Y. school post\\", The Day (New London), May 12, 1984.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=534191 on 2012-09-13 Description The shell of T. gallina is typically high and wide, though it may be slightly higher than wide. The imperforate, heavy, solid, thick shell has a conoidal shape and is elevated. Its colors show alternating whitish and purplish-grey or blackish crowded, slanting axial stripes, speckled with whitish. The stripes occupy the interstices between close, narrow superficial folds of the surface, which may be well-marked, or obsolete, continuous or cut into granules by equally close spiral furrows, the latter sometimes predominating. Its 5 to 6 whorls are convex and rough, and usually indented a short distance below the suture. The spire is conoidal. The apex is usually blunt, eroded and yellow. The body whorl is rounded at the periphery. The convex base often has an eroded area in front of the aperture, above a closed umbilicus, the area around which is usually white. The oblique aperture is nearly round. The outer lip is black-edged, smooth and pearly within. The columella is short, arcuate, and strongly bidentate near the base. The place of the umbilicus is marked by a pit The above description applies to the typical form. The sculpture of the surface is superficial and very variable, as is the distribution of the color markings, which is dependent upon the sculpture. It is sometimes difficult to separate this from Tegula funebralis.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia Distribution T. gallina lives on intertidal rocks. Its range extends from Santa Barbara County, California to Baja California (Pacific Ocean). Larger specimens of the species live in the southern portion of its range; it is often found alongside the less-common Black Tegula (T. funebralis). References * Turgeon, D.D., et al. 1998.

McGann and starring Anna May Wong as an astrologer who helps the police. Each of the twelve principal characters was born under a different astrological sign. Plot On an ocean liner sailing from the Orient to San Francisco, Mei Lei Ming (Anna May Wong) gives fellow passenger Nita Kenton (Lola Lane) a reading. When Nita's boyfriend, importer Phillip Corey (James Stephenson), scoffs at her predictions, she informs him that he himself will die within 48 hours. Corey is later found dead in his San Francisco shop, an apparent suicide. Police Inspector Jim C. Gregg (Charles C. Wilson) is certain it is a homicide and has Sergeant Kelly (Frank Jaquet) bring Mei Lei in for questioning. She convinces him she is innocent and, after demonstrating her astrological powers by telling both skeptical policemen about themselves based solely on their birth dates, proceeds to help them solve the case and two subsequent, related killings. Police forensic scientist Dr. Merton (Maurice Cass), however, remains firmly scornful of Mei Lei's unscientific methods. When Corey's Chinese business partner Frederick Gow (Leonard Mudie) shows up at the police station, he recognizes Juggler Barrows (an uncredited Sidney Bracey), who has been brought in for questioning about an unrelated crime. He pretends to cough and uses a handkerchief to conceal his face from Barrows as he enters Gregg's office. There, he announces that he wants to recover certain business letters from Corey's safe. Mei Lei becomes suspicious. When the letters Gow wanted are later examined, Mei Lei discovers a coded message that indicates Corey and Gow were involved in drug smuggling. Corey was engaged to Doris Kane (Margaret Lindsay), though she herself was not attracted to the man, preferring instead crack shot Larry Camp (Anthony Averill). Under questioning, Kane later reluctantly reveals that Corey had blackmailed her mother into pressuring her to accept the arrangement. She also acknowledges that she went to Corey's home the night he was killed to try to persuade him to break the engagement. She was followed by Camp, who then quarreled with the victim. A shot was fired, but Camp claims that Corey fired at him. Corey's valet, Shields (Eric Stanley) is also a suspect. Meanwhile, Gow runs into Juggler Barrows. Barrows is astonished to see him, as Gow had deceived him into believing he was Corey. Gow is relieved to ascertain that Sergeant Kelly did not believe Barrows when he claimed to have spoken to \\"Corey\\" some time after the real Corey had been killed. He lures Barrows away. Later, Barrows' dead body is flung from a speeding car. Convinced that Gow is the killer, Gregg goes to his apartment with Mei Lei and some policemen to search the place. Gow escapes through a hidden passageway. He spots Mei Lei alone in his reading room and takes her captive. However, Shields had seen Gow entering the secret passageway and followed. He shoots Gow dead. Mei Lei, seeing how good a shot he is, gets him to admit he killed his employer. Gow had hired Barrows to open Corey's safe. When Corey returned unexpectedly, they hid. Shields entered the room at just the wrong moment and was accused of theft. He was forced to shoot Corey in self-defense.

Known from a single astragalus (a footbone), the species was assigned to its own genus, Veratalpa, by Florentino Ameghino in 1905. He placed it in Talpidae, the family of the moles, but in 1974, John Howard Hutchison argued that the astragalus was not talpid and more likely came from a rodent. The astragalus is about 4.5 mm long, broad for a talpid, and has the head oriented farther from the axis of the foot than in talpids. Taxonomy Argentine naturalist Florentino Ameghino described Veratalpa in an overview of the astragali from the middle Miocene of Vieux Collonges in France. The astragalus is a bone of the foot that is part of the ankle joint. He listed several species of the family Talpidae (moles and related species) from Vieux Collonges, including \\"esp√®ce C\\" (\\"species C\\"), which he named as a new genus and species, Veratalpa lugdunensiana, in a footnote.Ameghino, 1905, p. 53 In a 1906 review of Ameghino's paper, √âdouard Louis Trouessart affirmed that Veratalpa probably represented a new genus of mole, but noted that the specific name lugdunensiana would have been more correctly written \\"lugdunensis\\". According to Trouessart, the suffix -ana is appropriate for names that reference persons, but not for those that refer to places, such as this name, which is derived from Lugdunum (the Latin name for Lyon).Trouessart, 1906, p. 17 In a 1974 review of Miocene European talpids, John Howard Hutchison wrote that the astragalus of Veratalpa lacked any features that would ally it with talpids and commented that it was most likely a rodent.Hutchison, 1974, p. 237 In their 1997 Classification of Mammals, Malcolm McKenna and Susan Bell listed Veratalpa as a member of Placentalia of uncertain affinities.McKenna and Bell, 1997, p. 81 Description The astragalus of Veratalpa is the largest among those from Vieux Collonges that Ameghino assigned to Talpidae. Although at 4.5 mm it is about as long as his \\"species A\\", it is broader, and Hutchison noted the broadness as one of the characters that argue against classification of Veratalpa in Talpidae. Like living moles, it has a broad, flat, and short head, but it forms a noticeably small angle with the body‚Äîin actual moles, the head is more axially oriented (i.e., towards the central axis of the foot). The surface of the head that contacts the navicula is less rounded than in moles. The body is low and nearly square and has a diameter of about 3 mm. The trochlea‚Äîa surface on the body of the bone that articulates with the tibia (lower leg bone)‚Äîis not large and pulley-like, as in talpids. There is a small perforation on the lower side of the body. This perforation is larger in Ameghino's other supposed talpids, and Trouessart suggested on the basis of this feature that the internal parts of the toes were reduced in Veratalpa. Distribution Veratalpa is known only from the locality of Vieux Collonges near Lyon in southeastern France; Ameghino knew this locality as \\"Mont- Ceindre\\".Ameghino, 1905, pp. 41, 53; Ivanov, 2000, p. 560 This rich fissure filling locality has yielded thousands of fossilsMein and Freudenthal, 1981, pp. 9‚Äì10 and is currently dated to the early-middle Miocene boundary, around 17 million years ago (MN 4/5 in the MN zonation).Ivanov, 2000, p. 560; McKenna and Bell, 1997, fig. 1 As Veratalpa is known from a single astragalus, Ameghino considered it to be rare. He distinguished six talpid species among the astragali,Ameghino, 1905, pp. 51‚Äì56 but according to Hutchison only Ameghino's species F (which was assigned to Talpidae with a query) is really a talpid.Hutchison, 1974, p. 237; Ameghino, 1905, pp. 55‚Äì56 References Literature cited *Ameghino, F. 1905.

Ilsa St√∂be Life Ilse St√∂be grew up in a working-class home in Berlin. St√∂be was the only daughter of carpenter Max St√∂be and his wife Frieda, n√©e Schumann. She had an eight-year- older half-brother from her mother's first marriage, Kurt M√ºller. She grew up in Mainzer Stra√üe 1 in Lichtenberg Berlin There is little information about their youth; many of them come from later interrogations of their half-brother accused by the National Socialists as traitors. St√∂be attended a trade school to learn a profession as a shorthand typist. After school, she was first employed in the publishing house of Rudolf Mosse and then worked as secretary to the journalist and writer Theodor Wolff in the Berliner Tageblatt. Wolff wrote the novel The Swimmer in the US in 1937, in which he described his love of age to Ilse St√∂be and which he wanted to film. There she met Rudolf Herrnstadt, to whom she would later become engaged. In 1929, St√∂be joined the Communist Party of Germany. From 1931, she worked with Herrnstadt, who built up an intelligence group of the Am Apparat (Military section) of the Communist International, which in addition to him and St√∂be, Gerhard Kegel and his wife Charlotte Vogt, at times also the publisher Helmut Kindler and the lawyer Lothar Bolz all belonged. Together with Herrnstadt in 1934, they moved to Warsaw, where she worked as a foreign correspondent for the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung until September 1939 and also wrote for other Swiss newspapers. St√∂be was then a member of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazi Party) and in mid-1934 was appointed Cultural Attach√© of the Nazi party's foreign office in Poland. According to Helmut Kindler, she remained in contact with him as her childhood friend. During the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, St√∂be met the Swiss publisher Rudolf Huber, who left her a major part of his fortune in his will when he died in 1940. Shortly before the German invasion of Poland, she returned to Berlin from Warsaw and worked in the information department of the Foreign Office. There she met the journalist Carl Helfrich, with whom she lived until her arrest in 1942. According to her will, he was the tenant of her flat in Ahornallee 48 in Charlottenburg, Berlin. Career Gerhard Kegel, who was an employee of the Foreign Office in Berlin from 1935 to 1943, wants to have supported St√∂be in her clandestine intelligence activities after returning from Poland. She allegedly continued this activity until her arrest in 1942. She was arrested on 12 September 1942 by the Gestapo, allegedly for spying for the Soviet Union and for membership of the Red Orchestra (Die Rote Kapelle) Soviet espionage ring. A Gestapo report of November 1942 said a radio message from the Soviet Union informed that a parachuted resistance fighter would come to her address. After seven weeks of torture she was compelled to confess to conspiratorial connections to the Soviet secret service and to persons such as Rudolf von Scheliha. He was then also arrested on 12 October 1942. Both were sentenced to death for treason on 14 December 1942 by the Reichskriegsgericht, and executed on 22 December 1942 in the Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin, she by guillotine and he by hanging from a meathook. The Soviet agent, Heinrich Koenen, who had landed in Germany by parachute, was arrested at her house by a waiting Gestapo official. Her mother was also arrested and sent to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, where she died in 1943. St√∂be's brother Kurt M√ºller was able to escape arrest and continue his resistance activities with the resistance group, the European Union Resistance. He was murdered in June 1944. St√∂be (code name \\"Alta\\") repeatedly sent warning messages to the Soviet Union about the impending German invasion of the Soviet Union well in advance of the attack.Article in the Spiegel Online English edition by Klaus Wiegrefe, 2013-10-01 Reception She was the only woman to be featured on a special coin issued by the East German Ministry of State (Stasi) to commemorate important spies in Communist service during the war.

The script was written by Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgall based on Jesse and Evgenia Peretz's story, and tells the story of a dimwitted but idealistic and well-meaning man who intrudes and wreaks havoc in his three sisters' lives. The film was co-produced by Anthony Bregman, Peter Saraf and Marc Turtletaub. It premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and was given wide release on August 26, 2011. The film received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the story and Rudd's performance, but criticizing the uneven script. Plot Ned Rochlin, a biodynamic agriculture farmer living with his girlfriend, Janet, is arrested for selling marijuana ‚Äì with good intentions ‚Äì to a uniformed police officer. Ned has three sisters: Miranda, a journalist hoping to publish her first major article with Vanity Fair, and hiding feelings for her neighbor, Jeremy; Natalie, a hipster living with her girlfriend Cindy and five other roommates; and Liz, married to documentary filmmaker Dylan, who shows no interest in her; they maintain strict control over their son River, leaving him unable to express himself. (He is seen in a boring interpretive dance class, but longs to take karate.) Paroled, Ned discovers Janet is living with Billy and no longer wishes to continue their relationship or allow Ned on the farm. Billy suggests Ned may be able to rent the goat barn behind the farm. Initially staying at his mother's house, Ned asks to stay with Liz. Put in River's room, he is told to help with Dylan's newest documentary about Russian ballerina Tatiana. Miranda reluctantly asks Ned to chauffeur while she interviews Lady Arabella, but is legally unable to pry into her scandalous past, while Ned's friendliness charms Arabella. Ned attends a self-help meeting with Natalie. Her friend Christian is attracted to Natalie but dissuaded by her lesbian relationship, until Ned explains she is bisexual. Christian and Natalie take a cab home and have sex. Ned is told to watch the car while Dylan interviews Tatiana. Ordered by a police officer to move the car, Ned runs upstairs and discovers Dylan naked with Tatiana, believing Dylan's claim that he was only making Tatiana \\"comfortable\\". At her benefit dinner, Arabella shares gossipy details of her life with Ned, who is kicked out of Liz's house after River announces Ned's legal trouble at an important school interview. Staying with Miranda, Ned mentions Dylan's nude interview, and Miranda concludes Dylan is having an affair. Realizing Ned has the details she needs about Arabella, Miranda forces him to tell her. Ashamed, Ned returns to the farm with but Janet does not allow him to rent the barn or leave with his dog, ‚ÄúWillie Nelson‚Äù. Ned asks Cindy, a lawyer, how to get custody of his dog, which she suggests they steal back. He has lunch with Jeremy, who explains that Miranda is too bossy for him. Miranda is hurt when Ned mentions the conversation and reveals her thoughts on Jeremy, leading to a fight between the two. Natalie confides to Ned that she is pregnant. Miranda and Nat try to tell Liz about Dylan's affair, which leads to an argument about all their personal lives. Confronting Dylan, Liz divorces him. Miranda takes Ned to vouch for her article, but he is unwilling to sign a release as Arabella spoke to him in confidence. The company lawyer decides they cannot publish the article, and Miranda kicks Ned out. He stays with Nat, who lies about having told Cindy about Christian. Cindy and Ned sneak onto the farm to retrieve his dog, but Ned mentions Nat's infidelity and Cindy angrily calls her from inside the house, alerting Janet, who refuses to give Ned his dog. Cindy drives away, leaving Ned behind. Ned naively tells his parole officer, Omar, that he smoked marijuana with a neighbor. Arriving for a family dinner, Ned is blamed by his sisters for the trouble in their lives, driving Ned to yell at them for their selfishness. Omar arrives to reluctantly take Ned into custody. Miranda posts Ned's bail, but he opts to stay in prison rather than be with his sisters. They devise a plan to get Willie Nelson from Janet; although she refuses, Billy gives them the dog. Reunited with Willie Nelson, Ned is motivated to leave prison. A few weeks later, Ned is out to lunch with his sisters. Cindy calls Nat, asking to go with her to her OB/GYN appointments, while Miranda has started a relationship with Jeremy, and Liz is dating again and letting River be himself. Ned and Billy have opened up a small homemade candle shop. Searching for Willie Nelson, Ned finds him playing with another runaway dog. Ned asks the owner her dog's name; she replies \\"Dolly Parton\\", to which Ned says his dog is \\"Willie Nelson\\", and they both smile.

They greatly enjoyed working together though, so they decided to draft another story, this time \\"a bit more commercial\\" and with characters in their 30s. They planned to cast actors with whom Peretz was already friends, and created the main character with Paul Rudd in mind. The script was written by Evgenia Peretz and her husband David Schisgall, and was completed by December 2009 under the original title of My Idiot Brother. Peretz brought the script to producer Anthony Bregman, with whom he had worked on the 2007 film The Ex. According to Bregman, \\"I was always looking for something to do with him [Peretz] and he came to me with this script. It was fantastic.\\" Bregman was familiar with producers Peter Saraf and Marc Turtletaub and had previously attempted to collaborate with the two. He sent them the script in April 2010 and Saraf said that he \\"loved it and was eager to work with both of them [Bregman and Peretz].\\" The film was co-financed by Bregman's production company, \\"Likely Story\\" and Saraf and Turtletaub's company, \\"Big Beach\\", with a budget of less than $10 million. The project developed unusually rapidly for an independent film; Bregman remarked in September 2010, \\"We worked on it for a few months and then it came together really quickly for the world of independent film. [...] We will have a cut of the film less than a year after we saw this script.\\" Saraf said, \\"This movie will set a record for how quickly it came together: from the time I first read the script to the time we wrapped the shoot was four months.\\" =Casting= Paul Rudd signed on to play the lead role even before Saraf and Turtletaub had picked up the film. The principal cast was announced in early June, including the roles played by Rudd, Elizabeth Banks, Emily Mortimer, Zooey Deschanel, and Rashida Jones. Additional cast members including Hugh Dancy, Kathryn Hahn, Shirley Knight, Janet Montgomery and Steve Coogan were announced in late July. =Filming= Principal photography began in July 2010 and took a total of 30 days over a six-week span. Filming took place in and around New York City, with a 30% tax credit from the New York State Governor's Office for Motion Picture and Television Development. Various locations were used in Brooklyn and Manhattan as well as Upstate New York; specific locations included Washington Heights, Cold Spring, New York, The Hamptons, Hotel Chelsea and Pete's Candy Store in Williamsburg. Post production was completed in Big Beach's New York offices. Reception Our Idiot Brother received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 70% based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 6.27/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"It's decidedly uneven, but like Paul Rudd's performance in the title role, Our Idiot Brother is too charming to resist.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 60 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, and wrote: \\"It's refreshing, this late in the summer, to find a hot weather comedy that doesn't hate its characters and embed them in scatology and sexual impossibilities.\\" Home media Our Idiot Brother was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on November 29, 2011.

Colonial history It has its origins with the 1527 foundation of Santa Ana de Coro by Juan de Amp√≠es, the province's first governor. Coro was the province's capital until 1546, followed by El Tocuyo (1546 - 1577). The capital was moved to Caracas in 1577 Distrito Capital by Juan de Pimentel. At one time Calabozo (founded 1724) was its capital. Early on, the province was defined in relation to the Venezuelan coastline (with Margarita Province to the north covering the Isla Margarita region). New Andalusia Province (created 1537) soon provided an eastern boundary, excepting a brief period (1633-1654) when the short-lived New Catalonia Province existed between the Venezuela and New Andalusia provinces. Guayana Province (created 1585) formed a southern boundary. Matters in the west were more complex and fluid, but the Maracaibo Province (from 1676) formed clearly the largest part until the Barinas Province was split from it in 1786. For most of its existence the province was subject to the legal and administrative supervision of the Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo (except for two short periods from 1717 to 1723 and 1739 to 1742). Administrative supervision was transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada when this was created in 1717, and in 1777 to the new Captaincy General of Venezuela. Legal supervision by Santo Domingo ended in 1786 when the Royal Audience of Caracas became functional within the new Captaincy- General. Independence The province was one of the 7 which signed the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. Towards the end of the Venezuelan War of Independence it was incorporated into Gran Colombia, initially dissolved within the Venezuela Department which represented the entire Captaincy General. In 1824 it was recreated (minus territory lost to the new Carabobo Province) as a reduced Caracas Province within a much smaller Venezuela Department. With the independence of Venezuela in 1830, the province was one of 11, becoming one of 13 by 1840. In 1848 Aragua Province and Gu√°rico Province were split from Caracas. Following the Federal War, the States of Venezuela were created in 1864, and the province ceased to exist.

The Prestonpans Tapestry, or in full the Battle of Prestonpans Tapestry 1745, is a large embroidery created ‚Äì and normally situated in ‚Äì Prestonpans, East Lothian, Scotland. It depicts the events before, during and after the Battle of Prestonpans on 21 September 1745, when Bonnie Prince Charlie triumphed over the Hanoverian Army led by Sir John Cope. The design, size and style were inspired by the Bayeux Tapestry. Description Bayeux Tapestry The Tapestry is, like the Bayeux Tapestry, an embroidered cloth, rather than a true woven tapestry. It is annotated in English but an animated DVD is also available in French and text materials in French and Gaelic. More than two hundred embroiderers created the work over a two-year period; more than half these reside in Scotland from the places where Bonnie Prince Charlie marched to his victory. Other embroiderers with family links come from as far as the US, Australia and New Zealand. The complete artwork measures , and consists of 103 panels, each one metre long and 500mm high. It is about longer than the Bayeux Tapestry. Design and execution The tapestry was the brainchild of the Prestoungrange Arts Festival, the Battle of Prestonpans 1745 Heritage Trust, the Founding Chairman of the Trust (Dr Gordon Prestoungrange, Baron of Prestoungrange), and the designer Dr Andrew Crummy. Historical and architectural advice was obtained from Professor Martin Margulies, Arran Johnston and Gareth Bryn-Jones. The embroiderers were led by Dorie Wilkie. The completed work was unveiled to a private gathering of 500 of the embroiderers and their friends on 26 July 2010, at The Greenhills near Cockenzie Power Station, which is on the edge of the Prestonpans battlefield itself. Exhibition Festival Interceltique in 2017. Since its creation, the Tapestry has since travelled around the Highlands and Lowlands, and to England and France, attracting over 150,000 visitors in its first two years. Exhibitions have included the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Storytelling Centre, St. Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh, to coincide with the Edinburgh Festival in 2011 and 2012, Alexandra Palace in London and Pornichet, St Nazaire, in France (from where the Prince embarked to launch his campaign in 1745). In September and October 2013 it was exhibited in Bayeux by invitation of the tapestry that was its inspiration. Exhibitions have continued across Scotland and in June/July 2017, after more than 500,000 had seen the artwork, it was displayed in the Scottish Parliament followed in August by exhibition at Festival Interceltique in Lorient in Brittany. The Battle of Prestonpans [1745] Heritage Trust expects to be able to find a permanent home within the next five years that will also be a \\"living history centre\\" for all other aspects of the battle and a hub for a nationwide and international Jacobite Trail. Successor works After seeing the Prestonpans Tapestry, Alexander McCall Smith commissioned the Great Tapestry of Scotland. Designed by historian and co-chairman Alistair Moffat and artist Andrew Crummy, with contributions from approximately 1000 stitchers from across Scotland, it depicts the history of Scotland from prehistoric times until the present day. The longest tapestry in the world at that time, it was unveiled at the Scottish Parliament on 3 September 2013 where it hung for 3 weeks.Susan Mansfield and Alistair Moffat (2013) The Great Tapestry of Scotland Birlinn Books More recently, the Scottish Diaspora Tapestry has been developed by the Prestoungrange Arts Festival, with support from the Scottish Government, Bord na Gaidhlig, Creative Scotland and Homecoming 2014. Dr Gordon Prestoungrange led a team across the globe to embroider the tapestry, telling stories from 34 countries where Scots have settled. Andrew Crummy was again the designer. It was exhibited throughout the 2014 Year of Homecoming in Scotland, at locations in Scotland, England, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy, and France. In 2016‚Äì17 it toured in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US and Iceland, before returning to be shown in London, Edinburgh and Prestonpans. It is intended that it will find a permanent home in Prestonpans alongside the Prestonpans Tapestry.

Biography =Early life= Reh Jones was born in Waco, Texas on (December 21, 1984) and at the age of three, moved to Houston, Texas, where his childhood education was obtained. He is a cousin to former NFL cornerback Denard Walker. =AnimeHorizon (1999)= At the age of fifteen, Jones began to study various programming languages and desired to create a small project. It was originally planned to be a small collaboration of pictures and fan art of one of his favorite Japanese cartoons, Sailor Moon, but it slowly began to become one of the first downloadable anime fan sites obtaining nearly 1,000 hits per day. Today, the website has become more broad and now covers over 150 Japanese animations. Since this change, the website has been subject to several criticisms and legal battles with production companies throughout the United States. In 2003, Cloverway requested removal of the Sailor Moon series as it was licensed for production in English. After non-disclosed communication between the parties, AnimeHorizon agreed to remove the English version of the series until licensing expired. AnimeHorizon now removes all licensed material and is only allowed to offer shows which are subtitled by fans. This caused further criticism for the site and a drastic loss of visitors, dropping over 400,000 slots in Alexa Internet traffic ranking,Alexa Internet \\"AnimeHorizon.com - Site Information from Alexa\\" but the site continues to serve a humble number of visitors. =Ippai Productions (2006)= During the summer of 2006, Ippai Productions (formerly known as Kyo to Ashita Studios), a voice acting and dubbing studio was created. The studio was formed primarily by the staff of AnimeHorizon and began production of an English version of Sailor Moon under the name of Kyo to Ashita Studios. Due to unforeseen casting issues, the project became delayed until Summer of 2007. During the resumed production of the series, a conflict of interest occurred with the co-owner of Kyo to Ashita Studios, which resulted in a name change to Ippai Productions. In early 2008, Ippai Productions released its first episode of the Sailor Moon StarS series to the public. Since its release, the studio has become inactive and the status of the project and the studio is unknown. =Cookin‚Äô Amigo (2014)= On December 31, 2014, Jones created the YouTube channel Cookin‚Äô Amigo.YouTube ‚ÄúCookin‚Äô Amigo\\" He uses the channel as a platform to provide instructional how-to videos for preparing various dishes. =Education= Jones attended University of North Texas from 2005‚Äì2008, where he served as the first president of the school's Japanese Language Exchange club, and obtained a dual bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science. =Other Ventures= Jones made a brief appearance during the filming of The Real World: Austin (aired in late 2005) in a scene involving charity work. He requested production to limit the airing of his segment; however, agreed to allow the scene to be viewed via The Real World's website.

Ltd. (CSM) was an ocean-going merchant shipping company based in the United Kingdom. During the Second World War CSM merchant ships made a substantial contribution to supplying the British war effort, at a cost of 13 ships lost and 163 officers and men killed. Founding of Rethymnis & Kulukundis In 1920 Manuel Kulukundis (1898‚Äì1988) from the Aegean island of Kasos moved to London, England and started work in a shipping office. In 1921 he and his cousin Minas Rethymnis founded the Rethymnis & Kulukundis shipbroking business in London. R&K; was nominally a ship management company, but through a network of family and business relationships this was increasingly intertwined with actual ownership by members of the Kulukundis and related families. Royal Mail Case The Royal Mail Case criminal prosecution of Lord Kylsant, director of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company (RMSP), in 1931 led to the liquidation of that company in 1932. RMSP was restructured as Royal Mail Lines and companies connected with it also had to restructure. One of these was Elder Dempster Lines, whose fleet included 24 First World War standard cargo ships that it had to sell quickly and at low cost in order to survive. R&K; and its Greek associates bought many of the Elder Dempster ships, and with Greek banks and British shipping companies created a new company called Tramp Ship Development Co Ltd to facilitate this. R&K; also started owning ships in its own right. At first they were registered in Greece, but from 1934 some R&K; ships were registered in the UK. R&K; gave the ships a \\"house\\" image by giving each one a name beginning with \\"Mount\\". Their funnels were black with a white band above a blue band, and a five- pointed red star straddling the boundary between the two bands. The white and blue bands denoted R&K;'s Greek heritage. Other shipping companies had previously used a red star as a badge, notably Robert Kermit Red Star Line (1818‚Äì67) and Red Star Line (1871 onwards). Growth of Rethymnis & Kulukundis Kulukundis had a Greek ship-owning company, Kulukundis Shipping Co SA, whose ships were managed by R&K.; Its ships included the Illinois which it bought from Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique in 1934, renamed Mount Pentelikon and registered in Piraeus. R&K; bought old second-hand vessels and established a nominally separate British company to own each ship. Surrey Steamship Co. Ltd. was created to own Box Hill, which Hawthorn Leslie at Hebburn on the River Tyne had built in 1920 as the . Sussex Steamship Co. Ltd. was created to own , which had been built by Richardson, Duck and Company at Thornaby-on-Tees in 1917 as the Cardigan. They were followed in 1935 by the First World War standard cargo ship Hampton Hill which had been built in 1919 as War Jasper. Acquisitions in 1936 included two more First World War standard ships: the Campden Hill and the Muneric. Other 1936 acquisitions included Inverleith which had been built as a tanker but converted to a dry cargo ship. R&K; also bought new ships. William Hamilton & Co built for R&K; in 1938, who created Atlanticos Steam Ship Co to own her and registered her in Piraeus, Greece. On 9 October 1939 she ran aground on Ower Bank in the North Sea off Norfolk, England. The Cromer Lifeboat HF Bailey rescued all hands but one later died of his injuries. In 1934 R&K; created Counties Ship Management Ltd (CSM) to manage ships owned by both its own companies and others. CSM ships had a buff funnel with a black top, and a red letter \\"C\\" inside a red circle on the buff part. Between 1936 and 1939 CSM companies bought ten second hand dry cargo steamships. Some were old. African Prince was a First World War B type standard merchant ship built in 1917 and became Pentridge Hill under CSM's Dorset Steamship Company in 1936. had been built in 1918 and became Dover Hill under CSM in 1936. Others were more modern, such as the 4,318 ton Peebles which had been built by William Doxford & Sons in Sunderland in 1930 and launched as . CSM continued to create single-ship companies for some of its new acquisitions. Brockley Hill Steamship Co Ltd. was created in 1939 to buy the 5,297 ton Penteli, which had been built by Caird & Co. in Greenock in 1919 as the War Burman. Ernels Shipping Co Ltd. seems to have been created in 1939 to buy the 7,178 ton , which had been built for Canadian National Steamships by Halifax Shipyards in Nova Scotia in 1922 and was renamed Argos Hill. Other CSM companies were expanded to own more than one ship. The majority of CSM's early ships were resold at a profit by 1939. Pentridge Hill, for example, was sold to Sir Wm. Reardon Smith & Sons who renamed her Botlea. Exceptions included Sussex Steamships Co's 4,542 ton which was wrecked off the coast of West Africa in 1936 and Pearlstone which reverted to her owners in 1938. The remaining few ships continued with CSM into the Second World War. Ship-naming policies varied between the CSM companies. Many had entirely English names, but Akri Hill (built in 1924) referred to the family's Greek background. Argos Hill sounds half-Greek but is in fact a hill in Mayfield, East Sussex, England. All Tower Steamship Co. ship names began with \\"Tower\\", such as Tower Bridge and Tower Field. Michael E and Marietta E (see below) were Kulukundis family names. CSM's Second World War fleet In 1940 several Kulukundis brothers moved to the safety of the USA, leaving John Kulukundis and his cousin Basil Mavroleon to manage the CSM fleet. From 1940 onwards CSM in turn was controlled by the Ministry of War Transport. British Government support enabled CSM to acquire new ships instead of second hand ones. Six were completed for CSM in 1940. Kingston Hill, Lulworth Hill, Marietta E and Richmond Hill (II) were new steamships while Putney Hill and Tower Grange were new motor ships. By 1943 all except Richmond Hill had been lost, along with the pre-war second-hand steamships Dover Hill, Mill Hill and Brockley Hill (I). Three more new steamships were completed for CSM in 1941: Pentridge Hill (II) and the catapult armed merchantmen (CAM ships) Michael E and Primrose Hill (I). Only Pentridge Hill survived the War. In 1942 William Doxford & Sons in Sunderland built two motor ships for Putney Hill Steamships: Coombe Hill and Tower Hill (II). Both survived the War. CSM made no more acquisitions until 1946. War losses CSM sustained heavy war losses in the Second World War, starting with Surrey Steamships Co's 5,677 ton Box Hill which struck a mine on 31 December 1939. The 4,318 ton Mill Hill was built in 1930 and acquired by CSM in 1936. On 16 August 1940 a U-boat torpedoed her in the North Atlantic. She was laden with pig iron and scrap steel, and quickly sank with the loss of all hands. The 7,628 ton was built in December 1940. She was damaged by Luftwaffe bombing in February 1941 but was repaired. She was torpedoed and sunk in June 1941. The 5,216 ton was completed in 1940. In June 1942 a U-boat sank her with one torpedo and fired 53 rounds from its deck gun. The 5,226 ton was completed in 1940. A U-boat torpedoed and sank her in November 1942. The 5,297 ton Brockley Hill was built in 1918. In 1939 CSM set up a one-ship company, Brockley Hill Steamship Co Ltd, to buy her. On 29 June 1941 U-651 torpedoed and sank her. All hands were rescued by another British cargo steamer in the same convoy. The 4,241 ton Tower Field ran aground and broke in two in 1941. She was salvaged and rebuilt, and the MoWT took her over as . on 5 March 1943 she was torpedoed and sunk. The 7,628 ton was completed in 1940. She was torpedoed by an Italian submarine in March 1943. 14 men had survived the sinking but after 50 days adrift in a liferaft only two were rescued alive. Two of CSM's 7,628 ton cargo steamers were equipped as CAM ships, each having a catapult on her bow to launch a Hawker Sea Hurricane. was the UK's first CAM ship, completed in May 1941. She was torpedoed and sunk on her maiden voyage on 2 June 1941. was completed in September 1941. In October 1942 a German submarine sank her with torpedo and shellfire. The 7,628 ton was completed in June 1940. In March 1943 a U-boat torpedoed and sank her in the Indian Ocean off the coast of South Africa. The 5,818 ton Clan Macvicar had been completed in 1918. CSM had acquired her in 1936 and renamed her . In February 1943 she was at anchor in northern Russia when a Luftwaffe 500 kg bomb crashed through her decks and buried itself in coal in her bunkers without exploding. Volunteers from her crew took two days and nights to dig down into the coal to reach the bomb, which a Soviet bomb disposal specialist then defused. All 19 volunteers were afterwards decorated for bravery. Dover Hill was salvaged and taken over by the Ministry of War Transport. On 9 June 1944 during the Normandy landings she was scuttled as a Corn Cob block ship for a Gooseberry Harbour. CSM's final wartime loss was the 7,178 ton refrigerated steamer Argos Hill. She was built in 1922 as . Ernels Shipping Co of London bought her in 1939, renamed her Argos Hill and placed her under CSM management. She was damaged in an air raid on Convoy OA 178 on 4 July 1940 but survived and remained in service until after the surrender of Germany. She was destroyed by fire on 7 August 1945 just a week before the surrender of Japan. By the end of hostilities CSM had lost 13 ships totalling 81,111 tons, with the deaths of 163 officers and men. Post-war development SS Putney Hill (Formerly SS Empire Celia) in 1948 In 1946 a CSM company bought Empire Nairobi, a standard Empire ship that had been built by Short Brothers in February 1945. CSM renamed her Dover Hill, after the earlier ship that had survived an unexploded bomb and then been scuttled in the Normandy landings. CSM sold her in 1951 to new owners who renamed her Basil. She changed owners and names several more times before being scrapped in Istanbul in 1968. Also in 1946 the MoWT placed the Empire Ship under CSM management. In 1948 the MoWT sold her to Putney Hill Steamships who renamed her SS Putney Hill after that was sunk in 1942. In 1947 Dorset Steamships acquired the Empire ship Empire Mandarin, which the Shipbuilding Corporation Ltd. in Newcastle-upon-Tyne had completed in 1942. Dorset Steamships renamed her Lulworth Hill, replacing an earlier ship of the same name. In about 1947‚Äì48 CSM companies bought seven Liberty ships from the UK Government. None remained under CSM control for very long. In 1948 seven oil tankers joined the fleet. Cardium, a 1931-built 8,300 ton motor tanker bought from Anglo-Saxon Petroleum, was renamed Hawthorn Hill but the other six tankers were not renamed. In 1950 the CSM fleet was radically expanded with 34 Canadian \\"Fort and Park\\" ships. London & Overseas Freighters In 1948 the cousins founded a new company, London & Overseas Freighters Ltd. They intended it to be a tanker company but in 1949‚Äì50 it took over ten dry cargo ships from three R&K; companies: Dorset Steamship Co Ltd, Putney Hill Steamships Co Ltd and Tower Steamship Co Ltd. In order to give the merged fleets a single \\"house\\" identity, in 1950 LOF renamed all of its ships, giving each one a name beginning with \\"London\\". Dorset Steamships' freighter Lulworth Hill (II) became London Builder. Richmond Hill (II), built in 1940 by Bartram & Sons in Sunderland for Putney Hill Steamships became the London Craftsman. The Pentridge Hill (II), built in 1941 by Bartram & Sons for Dorset Steamships, became the London Dealer. The freighters Coombe Hill and Tower Hill (II) became LOF's London Artisan and London Banker respectively. Another Dorset Steamships' vessel, Charmouth Hill, which became LOF's London Mariner in 1950, had been completed in Hartlepool in 1943 as the Empire Peak. Tower Steamships' Tower Grange, which became LOF's London Trader, had been completed by the Shipbuilding Corporation Ltd. in 1945 as the Empire Morley. Putney Hill Steamships' Putney Hill (II) was transferred to LOF but confusingly was at first renamed Castle Hill. In 1950 LOF renamed her again as London Statesman. In 1951 LOF sold her to Panamanian owners who renamed her Morella. Three Liberty ships were transferred to LOF. , which CSM had renamed Primrose Hill (II), was built in 1943. When transferred to LOF she was renamed London Vendor. LOF sold her in 1952 and she was subsequently renamed several more times. She was scrapped at Onomichi, Japan in 1968. , also built in 1943, had become the Mill Hill with CSM, and unlike other transferred ships retained her CSM name with LOF. LOF sold her in 1951 and her subsequent owners renamed her Educator. had been built in 1944 and sold in 1947 to a CSM company, Tramp Shipping Development Co, which renamed her Bisham Hill. She was transferred to LOF in October 1951 and sold in January 1952 to Liberian owners wno renamed her Nausica. CSM after 1950 In 1950 the CSM fleet was radically expanded with 34 Canadian \\"Fort and Park\\" ships. However, during the 1950s LOF became the Kulukundis family's main shipping company and the CSM fleet was reduced in size. Dover Hill (II) was sold in 1951. CSM's last wartime standard cargo ship was Denmark Hill, which had been built as the \\"Fort\\" ship Fort Mattagami and was sold for scrap in 1968. In 1966 CSM took over a modern dry cargo ship. Clarkspey had been built in 1960, but had been bareboat chartered to Port Line who renamed her Port Campbell. When her charter expired CSM bought her and renamed her Kings Reach. CSM sold her in 1970.

In the meantime, Dexter stalks his next victim, Matt Chambers, a man who kills people by running them over while drunk. Plot Debra visits Dexter to talk about the Ice Truck Killer case. Afterwards, Dexter examines the Barbie doll the killer left in his apartment and realizes the hands have differently painted fingernails. After giving evidence at a trial, he enters another courtroom where Matt Chambers (Sam Trammell) is being tried for manslaughter after drunkenly running over a teenager with his car. Dexter travels to a crime scene under the Westbound Causeway, just outside Miami, where he notices a piece of human flesh in the victim's mouth. At the station, Debra tells Dexter about her new boyfriend Sean. They make plans to have a lunch date along with Dexter's girlfriend Rita. The causeway victim is discovered to be a police officer named Ricky Simmons. LaGuerta and Doakes go to his home, where they find his wife Kara injured but alive. While analysing the scene, Dexter finds a drop of blood that is not hers. Dexter tells Rita about the lunch date. Debra calls to tell Dexter she has found a refrigerated truck with human fingertips inside, which have fingernails painted like the doll's. The bitten- off skin from Simmons' mouth is linked to Norberto Cervantes, who is apprehended by Doakes after Cervantes meets with drug lord Carlos Guerrero. Under questioning, Cervantes claims Kara was having an affair. Doakes punches him. LaGuerta takes a blood sample from Cervantes to confirm the skin and blood was his. Meanwhile, Chambers testifies that his car was stolen hours before the teenager's death and that he has been sober for several months. Dexter and Batista find more of Cervantes' blood at Kara's home. Dexter obtains Chambers's fingerprint and discovers that Chambers has killed people while driving drunk in other states. He prepares his kill room before going on the double date. When Rita notices the apparent ease of Debra and Sean's relationship, she starts to feel insecure and Dexter has difficulty comforting her. Cervantes is killed in jail by a man impersonating a police officer. Later, Rita and Dexter agree not to have sex until Rita is ready. Debra learns she is being promoted to Homicide. LaGuerta informs Doakes that Kara has died of heart failure and forces him to admit that they were sleeping together. LaGuerta agrees to keep the secret so Doakes can remain on the case. Dexter sees Guerrero and contemplates killing him, but decides against it. Dexter kidnaps Chambers, forces him to confess, then kills him and disposes of the body. At home, he finds evidence that the Ice Truck Killer has broken into his apartment for a second time. Reception \\"Crocodile\\" received mixed to positive reviews with much appraisal going to the opening sequence, which was first aired in this episode. IGN gave it a \\"Good\\" rating of 7.8, and stated that it was \\"...not as tightly constructed as the pilot, \\"Crocodile\\" still was solid and Michael C. Hall's performance as Dexter continues to be a wonderful one, deftly portraying all of the aspects of this complicated (to say the least) man, who has some unbelievable darkness hiding underneath his friendly exterior. And kudos to the excellent opening credits sequence, which consists of shots of Dexter going about several mundane activities that are made unsettling due to our knowledge that he's a serial killer\\". TVSquad gave it a very positive review and said that \\"Two episodes in and I really can't say anything bad about this show. It's wonderful. You shouldn't feel satisfied after watching a show about this subject matter, but you do and that's because it's done well.\\" and also praised the opening sequence for being \\"slick\\". The review from DenofGeek was considerably worse however, with Sarah Dobbs summing up the episode by saying \\"Dexter goes on a double date, eats some doughnuts, and, oh yeah, kills some more people.

Origins He was born in about 1565 either at Torwood House in his father's manor of Tor Mohun, Devon, or at adjoining Tor Abbey (purchased by his father), the son of Thomas Ridgeway (1543‚Äì1598) of Tor Mohun, Devon (son of John Ridgeway (c. 1517 ‚Äì 1560) of Abbots Carswell and Tor Mohun, MP), a Member of Parliament for Dartmouth in 1584. His mother was Mary Southcott, daughter of Thomas Southcott of Indio in the parish of Bovey Tracey, Devon.

Career He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 17 November 1581, and was admitted a student of the Inner Temple in 1583. Subsequently, he was collector of customs at Exmouth. He succeeded his father on 27 June 1597, and in July of that year fitted out a ship at his own cost to take part in the Islands Voyage under Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. He was High Sheriff of Devon in 1600, and was knighted in the same year. He is said to have taken part in the wars in Ireland, and may have done so under Lord Mountjoy. He was returned M.P. for Devon on 28 February 1604 to the Parliament of 1604‚Äì11, but resigned when appointed Treasurer of Ireland in 1606, a post which would require his long-term absence overseas. In 1603, he had been appointed vice-treasurer and treasurer-at-wars in Ireland under Lord Deputy Sir George Cary, whom he eventually succeeded as treasurer in April 1606. He held that office till 1616, being admitted a privy councillor on 20 October 1606. On 30 November 1606, he submitted a project to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury for increasing the crown revenues. On 18 December, warrant was given to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland to issue a commission to him and certain others to inquire into abbey lands in County Dublin. He had apparently about this time been appointed master of the hawks and game in Ireland, an office formerly in the possession of Sir Geoffrey Fenton. When the news of the rebellion of Sir Cahir O'Doherty reached Dublin (April 1608), the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Arthur Chichester, immediately despatched a strong force into the north, under the marshal, Sir Richard Wingfield and Sir Oliver Lambart. Ridgeway went with them and distinguished himself; and Chichester knighted his eldest son, Robert, at that time sixteen years of age, who had accompanied him. He assisted in the preliminary work of surveying the escheated counties of Ulster preparatory to the plantation, and on 30 November urged on Salisbury the necessity of putting the scheme into execution as speedily as possible. He was thanked by the king for his diligence, but the survey proved defective. On 19 July 1609 a new commission was issued to him and others. On 31 July the commissioners set out from Dublin towards the north, returning about the beginning of October, but it was not until the end of February 1610 that the inquisitions taken by them were drawn up in legal form and the maps properly prepared. Arriving in London about 12 March, Ridgeway had an interview with Salisbury, and handed over to him all the documents connected with the survey. During the next few weeks, he was engaged with Sir John Davies and the commissioners for Irish affairs, before the lords of the council, in assisting to make a selection from the long lists of servitors willing to plant, transmitted by Chichester, and in deciding as to the most suitable districts for locating the principal Irish. In the discharge of these and other duties connected with the grand movement in Ulster, he was in London till the beginning of July. Meanwhile, new commissioners, of whom he was one, had been appointed to carry the scheme into execution; and Ridgeway, as soon as he was relieved from attendance on the council, sailed over in a small boat of seven or eight tons. His arrival caused things to move briskly. He himself was assigned, as an undertaker, two thousand acres (8 km¬≤) in the precinct of Clogher, County Tyrone, lying on the south-eastern border of the barony of Clogher, adjoining the parish of Errigal Trough in County Monaghan, and represented on the map as well-wooded and containing little bog or waste land. To this were subsequently added on 22 April 1613 the lands around Augher. Further, as a servitor, there was assigned to him another estate of two thousand acres (8 km¬≤) in the precinct of Dungannon, County Tyrone, lying along the upper course of the Blackwater, and represented as abounding in woods and bog land. He was one of the first to take out his letters patent, and from a report made of the state of the plantation in 1611 he appears to have been fairly active in fulfilling his obligations as an undertaker. The settlement of Ulster having caused a great drain on the English exchequer, it was suggested to James I in 1611 that there were many gentlemen who would willingly pay for an hereditary title, and that the money thus obtained might be used for the support of the army in Ulster. The king's consent having been obtained, one of the first to take advantage of the new order thus created was Ridgeway, who for the payment of ¬£1,200 was created a baronet on 25 November 1611. In anticipation of the intended calling of a Parliament of Ireland, and with the object of securing a majority in it for the new settlers, a number of boroughs were created in 1612, and on 13 November Ridgeway was constituted a burgess of Balinakill in Gallen-Ridgeway, Queen's County, of which place he was elected M.P. on 17 April 1613. He was likewise returned as one of the knights of the shire for County Tyrone on 23 April to the parliament which met at Dublin on 18 May, and it was on his motion that Sir John Davies was elected speaker, thus giving rise to the counter-election of Sir John Everard. On 1 April 1615 a commission was issued to the Lord Chancellor and others to take his accounts as Treasurer. Some exception was made as to certain sums of money expended by him but he was discharged of his office in 1616, and on 25 May was created Lord Ridgeway, baron of Gallen-Ridgeway. On 19 August 1622, he sold his proportion called Portclare and Ballykillygirie, including Agher, to Sir James Erskine, eleventh son of Alexander, second son of John Erskine, 5th Lord Erskine, and younger brother of Thomas Erskine, 1st Earl of Kellie. The transaction was nominally a sale, but strictly an exchange of the Portclare and Ballykillygirie estate for the title and dignity of an earldom, of which Erskine had the disposal. Accordingly, on 23 August 1623 he became Earl of Londonderry. In the Star chamber proceedings against Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk in October 1619 one of the strongest pieces of evidence against him was a direct statement of Ridgeway that during the time he had been vice- treasurer he had never been able to obtain the money needed for the public service unless his demand was accompanied by a bribe. Death and burial Monument to Sir Thomas Ridgeway (d.1598), Tor Mohun Church, erected by his son Ridgeway died in London in 1631, and was buried in the south aisle of the parish church of Tor Mohun, Devonshire, where as a young man he had erected a grand monument with effigy of his father and adorned with three inscribed tablets to the memory of his father and grandfather. Family He married Cicely (sometime maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth), sister and coheiress of Henry Macwilliam, by whom he had three sons‚ÄîRobert, who succeeded him, Edward, and Macwilliam‚Äîand two daughters‚ÄîMary, who died in her infancy, and Cassandra, who married Sir Francis Willoughby. The peerage became extinct on the death of Robert, fourth earl, in 1714.

Livia Kohn criticizes Campany's translation that \\"ignores the fact that the word was obviously used in dynastic historical and other collections to mean \\"biography.\\" Authorship The Shenxian Zhuan is traditionally attributed to the Jin Dynasty scholar and religious practitioner Ge Hong, who is best known as author of the Baopuzi \\"Master Who Embraces Simplicity\\". \\"The majority of Chinese critics,\\" Sailey notes, \\"believe that the version which we have today is probably not the same one that Ge Hong wrote.\\" Ge's autobiography (Baopuzi Outer Chapter 50) records that he completed writing the Shenxian Zhuan and several other books during the Jianwu Âª∫Ê≠¶ era (317‚Äì318), when Emperor Yuan of Jin founded the Eastern Jin Dynasty. > In all I wrote Ëëó [Baopuzi] neipian ÂÖßÁØá in twenty chapters, [Baopuzi] waipian > in fifty chapters, one hundred chapters of inscriptions Á¢ë, eulogies È†å, poems > Ë©©, and rhapsodies Ë≥¶ and thirty chapters of military dispatches ËªçÊõ∏, > proclamations Ê™ÑÁßª, memorials to the throne Á´†Ë°®, and memoranda ÁÆãË®ò.

Compare other translations of this ambiguous description of the Shenxian Zhuan: *\\"I also compiled a book on those who are not normally listed, which became the Shen hsien chuan in 10 scrolls.\\" (tr. Ware 1966:17) *\\"In addition, he composed writings in which the common people (among the scholar class) were not interested, including the Shen-hsien chuan Á•û‰ªôÂÇ≥, in ten chapters.\\" (Sailey 1978:264) *\\"I also compiled biographies which are not passed down among the common people ‚Äì Shenxian Zhuan ‚Äì in ten chapters.\\" (Kominami 1978:595, tr. Penny 1996:171) *\\"I also compiled (zhuan Êí∞) traditions of those not conventionally listed to form Shenxian Zhuan in ten fascicles.\\" (Campany 2002:118) Ge Hong specifically uses the verb zhuan Êí∞ \\"compose; write; compile\\" for the Shenxian Zhuan and Yinyi Zhuan \\"Biographies of Recluses\\", which is no longer extant. Thus, Durrant (1986:677) writes, \\"Most of the biographies are extracted from various earlier works, so Ko is really much more of an editor than an author of Shen-hsien chuan.\\" Several early sources confirm that Ge Hong wrote the Shenxian Zhuan (Penny 1996:166, Campany 2002:119). The (ca. 429) Sanguozhi commentary by Pei Songzhi (372-451) quotes the Shenxian Zhuan and notes \\"what was recorded by Ge Hong came close to deluding the masses. But as his writings are so widely circulated, I have selected a few of the events.\\" Liu Xiujing Èô∏‰øÆÈùú's (437) List of Lingbao texts states that Ge Hong \\"selected and compiled\\" the Shenxian Zhuan. The Shui Jing Zhu \\"Commentary on the Waterways Classic\\" by Li Daoyuan (d. 527) also attributes the Shenxian Zhuan to Ge. The (6th century) biography of the Shangqing School patriarch Tao Hongjing (456-536) says he \\"obtained Ge Hong's Shenxian Zhuan and studied it day and night and so mastered its ideas on nourishing life.\\" Campany concludes, > We can therefore be as confident that Ge Hong compiled a work titled > Shenxian Zhuan as we can of almost any other authorial attribution in this > period of Chinese history. But it is equally certain that the Shenxian Zhuan > that has come down to us is not exactly the text that Ge Hong wrote. > (2002:119) Some scholars have questioned Ge's authorship of the Shenxian Zhuan based on textual inconsistencies, particularly with Ge's Baopuzi neipian. Arthur Waley doubted that Ge Hong wrote both the Baopuzi (Inner Chapter 16, tr. Ware 1966:264-5) and Shenxian Zhuan (tr. Campany 2002:139-140) biographies about Cheng Wei Á®ãÂÅâ, whose physiognomy caused his wife to refuse teaching him alchemy. > Not only is the style strangely different, but the Shen Hsien Chuan version > is so meagre and so incompetently told that one doubts whether the author of > it is even trying to pass himself off as Ko Hung. It seems indeed likely > that the Shen Hsien Chuan, though a work of the fourth century, was merely > an anonymous series of Taoist biographies, which some mistaken person > labeled as Ko Hung's Shen Hsien Chuan and divided into ten chapters. > (1930:10) Kominami Ichir≈ç (1978) analyzed the principles for immortality in Ge's two books. > For Ge Hong in Baopuzi achieving immortality is a technical problem in which > self-reliance is paramount. The stories in the Shenxian Zhuan, on the other > hand, depict the attainment of immortality as a process based on submission > and complete faith in a teacher who bestows the means of immortality on > proven disciples. In this Iatter version, immortality does not come from > within oneself, but is derived from external sources. (Penny 1996:171) Kominami hypothesized that Shangqing School editors revised the Shenxian Zhuan from Ge's original text to emphasize their belief in external powers, but Penny (1996:173) finds Kominami's evidence \\"unconvincing both for the existence of an \\"original\\" and its stance on the attainability of immortality.\\" Campany faults arguments against Ge Hong's authorship of the Shenxian Zhuan for committing two fallacies. > One is the fallacy of textual holism: the assumption that if one or a small > number of passages are problematic, then the overall attribution of > authorship must be in error. ‚Ä¶ The other fallacy is that of an assumption of > consistency, that texts by a single author, whenever they were written > during his lifetime, must have originally been completely consistent in > their values and priorities as well as in how they handle specific figures, > techniques, and events. (2002:119-120) Since the Shenxian Zhuan is a compilation of biographies from various sources, textual inconsistencies are predictable. Textual versions During the Sui (581-618), Tang (618-907), and Song Dynasties (960-1279), the Shenxian Zhuan was widely known and extensively quoted. Song editions of the Daozang included the text, but copies were lost when Mongol Yuan Dynasty officials burned \\"apocryphal\\" Daoist books in 1258-59 and 1280-81 (Penny 1996:175). The 1444 Ming Dynasty Daozang \\"Daoist canon\\" does not contain a complete version of the Shenxian Zhuan, and most received texts were compiled during the Qing Dynasty. Scholars have long suspected, writes Barrett (2003:229), that \\"the best-known version currently available was actually confected for commercial rather than academic purposes in the sixteenth century from quotations in other sources, and that the direct tradition of the text has been lost.\\" Some editions of the Shenxian Zhuan have different numbers and arrangements of biographies. Modern versions contain around ninety biographies, which differs from Tang-era versions. Zhang Shoujie ÂºµÂÆàÁØÄ's 736 commentary to the Shiji lists 69 biographies (Penny 2008:887). The Buddhist scholar Liang Su Ê¢ÅËÇÖ (753-793) reported that the text had 190 biographies. According to Penny (2008:887), \\"The unfortunate but inescapable conclusion derived from this text is that modern versions of Shenxian Zhuan are possibly less than half the size of an 8th Century version of Shenxian zhuan, and there is no reliable way of determining which biographies have been lost.\\" Modern Shenxian Zhuan texts exist in several ten- chapter versions, one five-chapter version (1868 Yiyuan junhua ËóùËãëÊçÉËèØ), and various one-chapter abstracts (Penny 1996:178-179, 198). Two ten-chapter versions are commonly available, but neither, concludes Penny (2008:888), \\"is entirely satisfactory\\". First, the 1794 Longwei mishu ÈæçÂ®ÅÁßòÊõ∏ edition, which stems from the 1592 Guang Han Wei congshu Âª£Êº¢È≠èÂè¢Êõ∏ version recompiled from sources including Taiping guangji Â§™Âπ≥Âª£Ë®ò quotations, contains 92 hagiographies. Second, the 1782 Siku Quanshu ÂõõÂ∫´ÂÖ®Êõ∏ edition, which stems from the 1641 Jiguge Ê±≤Âè§Èñ£ edition published by Mao Jin ÊØõÊôâ, contains 84 hagiographies. The best known one-chapter Ming Dynasty versions of the Shenxian zhuan include the ca. 1620 Yimen guangdu Â§∑ÈñÄÂª£Áâò and 1646 Shuofu Ë™™ÈÉõ versions (Penny 1996:179). Textual dating Dating \\"the original\\" Shenxian Zhuan text is impossible because its transmission stopped after the Southern Song Dynasty (1127‚Äì1279) book burnings. Campany concludes, > We can be certain neither that Ge Hong himself wrote even the earliest- > attested passages nor that he did not write event he latest attested. What > we can be certain of is the date by which each passage existed and was > attributed to the Shenxian Zhuan. ‚Ä¶ Based on these criteria, we can conclude > that material concerning 15 adepts is reliably attributed to the Shenxian > Zhuan before the year 500, that material about an additional 70 figures is > reliably attributed to Shenxian Zhuan by 650, 9 more figures by 700, 22 more > by the year 1000, and so on. Imagining these groups of material arranged in > concentric circles by source, the earliest at the center, one quickly sees > that there is a substantial body of hagiographic text occupying the inner > rings, attributable with relative confidence to Shenxian Zhuan and securely > datable to the late Tang or earlier. Hence, of the total of 196 > hagiographies (in whole or fragmentary form) included in my translation, > some percentage of at least 87 is attested in Tang or earlier texts. > (2002:127-128) Based upon detailed analysis of Shenxian Zhuan editions and fragments, Stephan Peter Bumbacher (2011:807) confirms the possibility that the text \\"indeed is from Ge Hong's brush\\"; however, if it is a forgery, \\"then it must have been fabricated in the time between Ge Hong's death and the earliest testimonies in the early 5th century, most probably during the first decades after his decease.\\" Translations The earliest English translations from the Shenxian Zhuan, for instance, Lionel Giles (1948) or Eva Wong (1997: 96-104), were only of selected biographies. Robert Campany (2002) wrote the first full translation, which many reviewers have praised. For example, \\"monumental\\" (Kohn 2002:329), \\"a giant leap forward in our understanding of the religious world of early medieval China\\" (Benn 2003:138), and \\"magisterial\\" (Haar 2004:486). Campany's book is more than a critical annotated translation; it is also a painstaking reconstruction of the textual strata. He analyzed Shenxian Zhuan quotations in some forty sources dating from the fifth to seventeenth centuries, and chronologically recompiled them into three groups. Group A are biographies fully attested in works until the end of the Tang Dynasty (618-907), Group B are those only mentioned in these sources, and Group C are those ascribed to the Shenxian Zhuan only since the Song Dynasty (960-1279). Reviewers have criticized some of Campany's translations for disregarding conventions (e.g., \\"traditions\\" for zhuan \\"biographies\\" noted above). For instance (2002:52-60), he translates shijie Â∞∏Ëß£ (lit. \\"corpse separation\\") as \\"escape by means of a simulated corpse\\". This obscure Daoist term, usually translated \\"liberation from the corpse\\" (Benn 2003:139) or \\"corpse liberation\\" (Robson 2004:490), refers to a method of xian transformation involving a substitute corpse to fake death. Other shijie translations include \\"release by means of a corpse\\", \\"one's soul leaves the body and becomes an immortal after death\\", and \\"dissolve bodily into a spirit\\". Campany (2002:58) lists common elements in Shenxian Zhuan narratives involving shijie transcendence. Employing bianhua simulation of death (Robinet 1993: 167-168), an adept will typically pretend to become ill, feign death, and be buried. Later he or she is seen alive, always at a distant place, and when the coffin is opened, instead of a corpse, it contains some other object (talisman, sword, clothing, etc.). Adepts will occasionally change their names as a device to elude detection by spirits in the underworld bureaucracy. In the Baopuzi, Ge Hong ranked shijiexian Â∞∏Ëß£‰ªô \\"escape by means of a simulated corpse transcendents\\" as the lowest of three categories, below tianxian Â§©‰ªô \\"celestial transcendents\\" who ascend into the heavens and dixian Âú∞‰ªô \\"earthbound transcendents\\" who wander in the mountains. Significance Campany lists four reasons for studying the Shenxian Zhuan. > For one thing, Ge Hong's works afford us an unparalleled glimpse into > certain aspects of Chinese religious life and practice at a critical time in > the history of Chinese religions. ‚Ä¶ For another thing, Ge Hong records > elements of religious ideas and disciplines relating to the quest for > transcendence that might otherwise remain unknown to us, and his writings > constitute a valuable terminus ante quem for them. ‚Ä¶ With respect to Daoist > religious history proper, furthermore, Ge Hong's writings, and the > practices, ideas, and values represented in them, constitute an important > voice in ongoing inter- or intrareligious rivalries and self-definitions. ‚Ä¶ > Finally, research on Ge Hong's works has at least two contributions to make > to the cross-cultural study of religions. The religion he documents was an > extraordinary human response to the phenomenon of death. ‚Ä¶ [and contributes] > new material for an as yet unrealized cross-cultural understanding of > hagiography as a type of religious writing, a theme in religious studies > heretofore largely dominated by Christian and Islamic categories. > (2002:9-11) Penny summarizes why the Shenxian Zhuan is important. > The biographies provide a wealth of information about how immortality was > viewed in early medieval China, detailing important features of how > immortals, and those who sought immortality, lived, their extraordinary > abilities, their relationship to other people and society at large, > including government at all levels, the way they interacted with other > spiritual beings, the drugs they concocted, and how they transformed their > environments for themselves.

He built churches in Cologne, the Ruhr area, Swabia, and Hesse. Many of his buildings are examples of Brick Expressionism. Life and career B√∂hm was born in Jettingen as the youngest of six children to builder and major Alois B√∂hm and his wife Katharina (n√©e Hofmiller). He studied at the Augsburg University of Applied Sciences and graduated in 1900. He became a teacher at the Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung Offenbach from 1908-1926. He also attended lectures by Theodor Fischer at the University of Stuttgart. He worked with several partners, including Martin Weber and Rudolf Schwarz, designing and constructing churches. He first taught at the Rheinische Technicum in Bingen, and than from 1908 to 1926 at what is now the College of Design in Offenbach, with the architect Rudolf Schwarz in a joint workshop. In 1926, B√∂hm became professor for Christian art under Richard Riemerschmid at the K√∂lner Werkschulen in Cologne. His works, including the Christ the King church (Christk√∂nigskirche) in Bischofsheim, polarized between support (e.g. by the art historian August Hoff) and rejection (e.g. Michael von Faulhaber). During World War II he became (through his membership in the Block K√∂lner Bauk√ºnstler) member of the NSDAP, but never engaged in construction for the government. While he was reluctant to sign his personal correspondence with the prescribed party greetings, he was willing to compete for government commissions alongside architects like Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe.Kathleen James-Chakraborty, German Architecture for a Mass Audience (London, 2000), p. 100 Four of his largest churches were built during the reign of the Third Reich. He enjoyed high standing within Nazi Germany, demonstrated by the fact that in 1943 he was the subject of one of the last architectural monographs published before the end of the war. Kathleen James- Chakraborty, German Architecture for a Mass Audience (London, 2000), p. 100 His church designs took inspiration from the communal emphasis of Guardini's theology; however his architectural aesthetic and personal behaviour cannot deny the political ramifications of the ideas to which he sought to give built form. After the war, he retook his position in Cologne, and constructed eight new churches in the massively damaged city. He was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit in 1950, and the Order of St. Sylvester in 1952. B√∂hm died in Cologne, where he was buried on August 10, 1955. Architectural expression and legacy B√∂hm took advantage of modern building materials and techniques. By reducing the form of the church to its essential shape, the lighting of the altar and the sophisticated design of the altar, he created a new tradition of modern church architecture. In particular, he treated light as if it were a building material, and as part of the liturgy. B√∂hm also considered liturgical questions which may have indirectly influenced the doctrine of the Second Vatican Council. His special merit was his belief in the participation of the community in worship, using the structure of early church buildings as a model. His churches are characterized by simple monumentality and especially by the new emphasis on the centrally-located altar area. Stained glass was one of his passions. He designed the stained glass windows, built for Holy Ghost Church in Brunswick-Lehndorf in 1952. He also served as a musician and composer, and composed numerous songs and sacred music. The postmodern architect Heinz Bienefeld began his career as his assistant. Part of his legacy is preserved at the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt, while another part was located in the Historical Archive of the City of Cologne but was probably lost in the collapse of the archive building on 3 March 2009.Nine missing as Cologne archives collapse, AFP, March 3, 2009 He is the father of architect Gottfried B√∂hm.

More than anywhere else in Nigeria at the time, Demola Seriki's tenure as chairman of the Lagos State Sports Council was marked by political instability in Nigeria during the struggle for democratic rule by the National Democratic Coalition, Nigeria (NADECO) and civil society organisations following the then military junta's annulment of Nigeria's freest and fairest general elections won by M.K.O. Abiola. This period witnessed very regular youth demonstrations and riots on the streets of Lagos.

Day and Paul J. H. Schoemaker developed a questionnaire with 24 questions.Day, G. S., & Schoemaker, P. J. H. 2005. Scanning the periphery. Harvard Business Review, 83(11): 135-148. Implementation =The five practice dimensions= Based on case study research in 20 multinational companies, Ren√© Rohrbeck proposes a \\"Maturity Model for the Future Orientation of a Firm\\". Its five dimensions are: * information usage describes the information which is collected * method sophistication describes methods used to interpret the information * people & networks describes characteristics of individual employees and networks used by the organization to acquire and disseminate information on change * organization describes how information is gathered, interpreted and used in the organization * culture describes the extent to which the corporate culture is supportive to the organizational future orientation The model is operationalised through 20 elements which have four maturity levels each. These maturity levels are defined and described qualitatively, i.e. by short descriptions that are either true or not true for a given organization. = The three process steps = Organisations need to build foresight through three core process steps, which build on specific practices: * Perceiving: Practices that firm use to identify the factors that drive environmental change. Firm aim to identify (weak) signals ahead of competition to gain a lead-time advantage * Prospecting: Practices through which firms engage in sensemaking and strategizing. Practices include working with analogies, scenario analysis, systems-dynamics mapping, and backcasting * Probing: Probing practices are exercise in dedicated accelerator units and in units/projects that receive the mandate to act. This may include prototyping, R&D; projects, consumer tests, internal venturing, strategic initiatives or external venturing. Probing practices aim at legitimizing and starting a new course of action and ultimately at gaining a competitive advantage. Corporate foresight can be expected to be a determinant of the quality of strategic conversation. It will also, in line with digitalisation of other organisational processes, be driven by online platforms that allow broadening the scope of the people who can get involved in defining new courses of action. = Innovation management = Through an empirical investigation Rohrbeck identified three roles that corporate foresight can play to enhance the innovation management of a firm: * In the Initiator role Corporate Foresight supports the identification of new customer needs and emerging technologies. In addition it might also support the monitoring of competitors. To identify emerging technologies methods such as Technology Scouting can be used. Its particular appeal is the use of expert networks, that can also be used to later source the technologies. * In the Strategist role Corporate Foresight supports the identification of emerging business fields and supports the internal renewal and re-positioning efforts of the firm. * In the Opponent role Corporate Foresight uses the insights from the environmental scanning to challenge ongoing R&D; projects. The aim is to ensure that innovation initiatives are continuously benchmarked against emerging technologies and confronted with current customer needs. The study also showed that only a small number of firms have implemented the third role. In the majority of firms the aims of an innovation development project that have been defined are not challenged after the initial decision has been taken. This carries the risk that changing environmental conditions threaten the success of the innovation in development. Additionally, von der Gracht and Vennemann have developed a portfolio-approach, the so-called ‚ÄòFuture-Fitness-Portfolio‚Äô, which enables companies to qualitatively compare amongst others and identify organizational improvement potential. The authors base their framework on both, corporate foresight and innovation management.  Benefits  Firms that have applied corporate foresight have received a number of benefits: * Identify changes ahead of competition * Trigger innovation initiatives * Challenge innovation projects to make them more successful * Overcoming dominant mental models that stand in the way of necessary organisational response * Moderate strategic discussions * Breaking away from path dependency * Support the search, development, and acquisition of strategic resources On a higher level it has been documented that firms will be able to * Enhance their perception on the external environment * Trigger strategic organisational responses * Trigger new innovation initiatives * Contribute to organisational learning * Shaping the future (by influencing other players to act) More recently a longitudinal study, that tracked 83 companies over a period of 7 years, has found that firms that have the right maturity level of corporate foresight practices (high future preparedness) can expect an on average 33% higher profitability and a 200% higher market capitalisation growth, when compared to the average.  Case studies  In recent years corporate foresight has become more professional and widespread. Documented examples of organizations applying corporate foresight practices include: * Automobile: Audi, Daimler, * Chemical: BASF, * Consumer goods: Pepsi, * Engineering and Electronics: General Electric, Siemens, * Financial service industry: Deutsche Bank, * Information and communication technology industry: Cisco, Deutsche Telekom, EIT Digital, France Telecom, * Oil and gas industry: Shell * Professional services: KPMG * Transport industry: SNCF Such organizations typically use corporate foresight to support strategic management, identify new business fieldsRohrbeck, R., S.

The official launch of the California Watch website took place in January 2010. The team was best known for producing well researched and widely distributed investigative stories on topics of interest to Californians. In small ways, the newsroom pioneered in the digital space, including listing the names of editors and copy editors at the bottom of each story, custom-editing stories for multiple partners, developing unique methods to engage with audiences and distributing the same essential investigative stories to newsrooms across the state. It worked with many news outlets, including newspapers throughout the state, all of the ABC television affiliates in California, KQED radio and television and dozens of websites. The Center for Investigative Reporting created California Watch with $3.5 million in seed funding. The team won several industry awards for its public interest reporting, including the George Polk Award in 2012. In addition to numerous awards won for its investigative reports, the California Watch website also won an Online Journalism Award in the general excellence category from the Online News Association in its first year of existence. History In 2009, the California Watch team began creating reports on statewide issues. The team's mission was to highlight stories related to education, immigration, the environment, politics, public safety, and other areas of public interest. At the time of its launch, California Watch had seven reporters, two multimedia producers, and two editors. Robert J. Rosenthal hired Mark Katches as the editorial director. Katches had led investigative reporting teams at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, where he edited two Pulitzer Prize winning projects and at the Orange County Register. The reporting team hired by Katches included Lance Williams, who uncovered the BALCO steroids in sports scandal while an investigative reporter at the San Francisco Chronicle. California Watch started with offices in Berkeley and Sacramento, California. California Watch hired three additional reporters in mid-2010. Among them was Ryan Gabrielson, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on abusive practices in the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. California Watch shares its editors, TV producers, multimedia producers, news applications developers, data analysts and radio production with the Center for Investigative Reporting. In March 2010, California Watch launched the ‚ÄúPolitics Verbatim‚Äù website created by Chase Davis. The site tracked the statements and promises of the state's candidates for governor, Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown. The site featured search tools, and users could sort statements by topic and geographic location. Reporting targeted at younger audiences includes age-specific media, such as coloring books and finger puppet videos.

Operations model The Center for Investigative Reporting, which runs California Watch, depends largely on foundation grants and individual donors. It also charges for its content. California Watch publishes content on its website and also distributes content to other news outlets, such as The San Francisco Chronicle, San Diego Union Tribune, Sacramento Bee, Orange County Register, KQED, all of the ABC TV affiliates in California and National Public Radio. California Watch has an agreement with New American Media to help distribute translated versions of the team's reports to ethnic news outlets. Distribution is important for the success of California Watch's efforts. In the case of the story on school-district budget cuts, California Watch had 20 media partners for the story. It was distributed in print, on TV, the web, and radio. California Watch has experimented with new ways of distributing its work. To spread the word on a story about earthquake safety at public universities, the team produced fliers. They handed out these fliers on the UC Berkeley campus, which has more unsafe buildings than any other California university. As part of the investigation into the seismic safety of K-12 schools in California, California Watch produced and distributed more than 30,000 coloring books in multiple languages, to help children learn about earthquake safety. In 2012, it partnered with the UCSF Children's Hospital to distribute 50,000 more at San Francisco's Fleet Week. Awards and recognition In 2012, California Watch won the George Polk Award for medical reporting. Its investigation exposed fraudulent medical billing at Prime Healthcare Services. California Watch was the only nonprofit organization on the list of winners. Lance Williams and Christina Jewett were the lead reporters on the investigation. In 2010, California Watch initiated the ‚ÄúOpen Newsroom‚Äù project. The team works from coffee houses and other public areas with free Wi-Fi. Director Mark Katches envisioned the open newsroom as a way to engage with the local community. In June 2012, California Watch partnered with KQED to hold a series of five open newsrooms around the San Francisco Bay Area. The far-reaching ‚ÄúOn Shaky Ground‚Äù investigation was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in 2012. In 2011, the story earned the Roy W. Howard Award and a $10,000 grant from the Scripps Howard Foundation. The Northern California Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists awarded California Watch a Journalism Innovation award in 2011. In the previous year, the society named the group Journalist of the Year. The Broken Shield series of investigations into police failures and abuses picked up the Online News Association‚Äôs Gannett Foundation Award for Innovative Investigative Journalism in 2012. California Watch was nominated for four ONA awards in 2011.

The battle was initiated by Cao Cao's western expansion, which triggered uprisings in Guanxi. Cao Cao scored a decisive victory over the Guanxi coalition and established a hold of the Guanzhong region. Background Towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, the warlord Ma Teng commanded a sizable army in the northwestern frontiers of China that threatened the North China Plain under the dominion of Cao Cao. When Cao Cao finished his unification of northern China in 207, he wished to turn south to attack the warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan. To avoid a potential attack from behind, Cao Cao appointed Ma Teng as an official and summoned him to Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei). Ma Teng and some of his family members were effectively held hostage to prevent Ma Teng's son, Ma Chao, from invading Cao Cao's territory. Cao Cao's southern expedition failed and he was defeated by the combined forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei at the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208. He turned his attention west instead and prepared to invade the Guanzhong region. Around April 211, Cao Cao ordered Zhong Yao to lead an army against the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery and sent Xiahou Yuan at the head of another force from Hedong Commandery to support Zhong Yao.(ÂºµÈ≠ØÊìöÊº¢‰∏≠Ôºå‰∏âÊúàÔºåÈÅ£ÈçæÁπáË®é‰πã„ÄÇÂÖ¨‰ΩøÊ∑µÁ≠âÂá∫Ê≤≥Êù±ËàáÁπáÊúÉ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 1.

The various warlords in the Guanzhong region feared that Cao Cao would to attack them because Zhong Yao's army would pass by the Guanzhong region on the way to Hanzhong Commandery. As soon as Zhong Yao's army entered Guanzhong, the warlords, under the leadership of Ma Chao and Han Sui, formed a coalition (known as the \\"Guanxi Coalition\\", or \\"coalition from the west of Tong Pass\\") and rebelled against the Han imperial court.(ÊòØÊôÇÈóú‰∏≠Ë´∏Â∞áÁñëÁπáÊ¨≤Ëá™Ë•≤ÔºåÈ¶¨Ë∂ÖÈÅÇËàáÈüìÈÅÇ„ÄÅÊ•äÁßã„ÄÅÊùéÂ†™„ÄÅÊàêÂÆúÁ≠âÂèõ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 1.

Many counties in the area joined the uprising. Some civilians escaped to Hanzhong via Ziwu Valley () to avoid the war. In response, Cao Cao sent Cao Ren against the coalition at Tong Pass (in present- day Tongguan County, Shaanxi) and gave strict orders to his generals to refrain from engaging the enemy.(ÈÅ£Êõπ‰ªÅË®é‰πã„ÄÇË∂ÖÁ≠âÂ±ØÊΩºÈóúÔºåÂÖ¨ÂãëË´∏Â∞áÔºö„ÄåÈóúË•øÂÖµÁ≤æÊÇçÔºåÂ†ÖÂ£ÅÂãøËàáÊà∞„ÄÇ„Äç) Sanguozhi vol. 1. Crossing of the Wei River In late July or August 211, Cao Cao personally led an army against the rebels, leaving behind his son Cao Pi to guard his base in Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei). Some of his subordinates advised him: \\"The Guanxi soldiers are warlike and they specialise in using long spears. Only an elite vanguard force can stop them.\\" Cao Cao replied: \\"I am in charge of the war, not the rebels. They may be skilled in using long spears, but I wll make them unable to use their spears.

While Cao Cao and his men were preparing to cross the Wei River to the north bank, they suddenly came under attack by Ma Chao's forces, but Cao remained seated and refused to move. Zhang He and the other officers saw that the situation was very critical, so they led Cao Cao on board a ferry. As the river current was very strong, Cao Cao's vessels quickly sailed four or five li away from the south bank. Ma Chao ordered his troops to rain arrows upon the enemy boats. Ding Fei (), a colonel under Cao Cao, had released the cattle and horses to distract the enemy, so the Guanxi soldiers immediately gave up on attacking and started to seize whatever livestock they could lay their hands on. Cao Cao's officers were worried and panicky when they lost sight of their lord during the chaos, and they shed tears of joy when they reunited with him later.

Construction of sand walls After crossing the river, Cao Cao and his forces then headed south along the riverbank. The coalition retreated and made camp along the Wei River. Cao Cao set up many decoys to confuse the enemy while secretly sending troops to sail across the river and construct pontoon bridges. His forces crossed the river that night and built camps on the south bank. On the same night, the coalition attacked but were driven back by ambush forces deployed earlier by Cao Cao. Ma Chao and his allies also garrisoned at the south bank and they sent a messenger to meet Cao Cao, requesting to give up the territories west of the river in exchange for peace, but Cao Cao refused.(...

In late October or November 211, Cao Cao's forces attempted to cross the Wei River again, but came under attack by Ma Chao and his cavalry each time they tried to cross. Their camps were not stable and they could not build ramparts because the terrain was too sandy. Lou Gui suggested to Cao Cao: \\"The weather is cold. We can mix sand with water and use the mixture to construct walls. They will be ready after one night.\\" Cao Cao heeded Lou Gui's suggestion and ordered his troops to work through the night to build the walls, which were ready by the following day.

Ma Chao led his men to attack the walls but were repelled by Cao Cao's ambushes. However, there were suspicions that the building of the sand walls did not actually occur, because the incident took place in late autumn or early winter (late October to November) and the weather was probably not cold enough to cause water to freeze.(ÊàñÁñë‰∫éÊôÇ‰πùÊúàÔºåÊ∞¥Êú™ÊáâÂáç„ÄÇ) Cao Man Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 1. The fifth- century historian Pei Songzhi commented that the Wei Shu stated that Cao Cao's army reached Tong Pass in late August or September 211, and crossed the Wei River to the north bank in late September or October.

Cao Cao sowing discord between the coalition members Ma Chao and the coalition repeatedly challenged Cao Cao to come out and engage them in battle but Cao ignored them.

Han Sui's father and Cao Cao were nominated as xiaolians (civil service candidates) in the same year, while Cao and Han were also former colleagues when they were working in the old capital Luoyang. When they met at close quarters (they were on horseback and their steeds were side by side but facing opposite directions), they spoke nothing about military affairs and had a mere lighthearted conversation about old times. When Han Sui returned to his camp later, Ma Chao asked him: \\"What did Cao Cao say?\\" Han Sui replied: \\"Nothing.\\" Ma Chao and the others became suspicious of Han Sui.(ÈüìÈÅÇË´ãËàáÂÖ¨Áõ∏Ë¶ãÔºåÂÖ¨ËàáÈÅÇÁà∂ÂêåÊ≠≤Â≠ùÂªâÔºåÂèàËàáÈÅÇÂêåÊôÇÂÑïËº©ÔºåÊñºÊòØ‰∫§È¶¨Ë™ûÁßªÊôÇÔºå‰∏çÂèäËªç‰∫ãÔºå‰ΩÜË™™‰∫¨ÈÉΩËàäÊïÖÔºåÊãäÊâãÊ≠°Á¨ë„ÄÇÊó£ÁΩ∑ÔºåË∂ÖÁ≠âÂïèÈÅÇÔºö„ÄåÂÖ¨‰ΩïË®ÄÔºü„ÄçÈÅÇÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁÑ°ÊâÄË®Ä‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçË∂ÖÁ≠âÁñë‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 1. When Cao Cao was going to meet Han Sui again later (the other coalition members were with Han this time), his subordinates cautioned him: \\"My lord, when you meet the rebels, you may not be able to leave easily. How about using wooden horses as barriers?\\" Cao Cao agreed to their suggestion and spoke to Han Sui and his allies from behind the barriers. The coalition members greeted Cao Cao when they met him while their soldiers pushed their way forward to get a closer look at him. Cao Cao laughed and said: \\"You wish to see how I look like? I am also an ordinary person. I don't have four eyes or two mouths, but I am more intelligent.\\" Cao Cao had brought along 5,000 armoured horsemen and instructed them to arrange themselves in an impressive formation.

Some days later, Cao Cao wrote a letter to Han Sui which contained several \\"amendments\\", making it seem as though the recipient had deliberately edited the letter's contents to cover up something. Ma Chao and the others became even more suspicious of Han Sui after they saw the letter. In the meantime, Cao Cao was preparing for war with the coalition. He sent lightly armed troops to attack first, and then despatched his elite cavalry to launch a pincer attack. Cao Cao scored a major victory over the coalition: Cheng Yi, Li Kan and others were killed in action; Yang Qiu fled to Anding Commandery (ÂÆâÂÆöÈÉ°; around present-day Pingliang, Gansu); Ma Chao and Han Sui retreated back to Liang Province.

Cao Cao's analysis of the battle After the battle, Cao Cao's officers asked their lord: \\"Earlier on, when the rebels were at Tong Pass, the north of the Wei River was not guarded. Why didn't you attack Pingyi (È¶ÆÁøä) from the east bank, and instead choose to defend Tong Pass and cross the river later?\\" Cao Cao replied, \\"The rebels were at Tong Pass. If I went to the east bank, they would definitely increase their defences at the fords and we wouldn't be able to cross over to the west. Hence, I chose to deploy our forces at Tong Pass so that the rebels would concentrate their defences on the south bank and lower their guard in the west. This was why our two generals (Xu Huang and Zhu Ling) were able to capture the west bank first, after which our main army crossed over to the north bank. The rebels were unable to fight for control of the west bank with us because our two generals had already occupied the area. When I gave orders for our carts to be linked together, wooden fences to be erected as defensive structures, and for our army to head south along the riverbank, I knew that we couldn't win then so I decided to display our weakness to the enemy. When we crossed the river back to the south bank and built solid walls, I didn't allow our men to engage the enemy because I wanted the enemy to become overconfident. As such, the rebels didn't attack our walls and instead requested to cede territories in exchange for peace. I pretended to agree so that they would be at ease and would not be on guard while our troops prepared for battle. When we attacked, it was indeed a case of 'a sudden crash of thunder leaves no time for one to cover his ears'. There are more than one way to how the situation on a battlefield can change.\\"(Ë´∏Â∞áÊàñÂïèÂÖ¨Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂàùÔºåË≥äÂÆàÊΩºÈóúÔºåÊ∏≠ÂåóÈÅìÁº∫Ôºå‰∏çÂæûÊ≤≥Êù±ÊìäÈ¶ÆÁøäËÄåÂèçÂÆàÊΩºÈóúÔºåÂºïÊó•ËÄåÂæåÂåóÊ∏°Ôºå‰Ωï‰πüÔºü„ÄçÂÖ¨Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåË≥äÂÆàÊΩºÈóúÔºåËã•ÂêæÂÖ•Ê≤≥Êù±ÔºåË≥äÂøÖÂºïÂÆàË´∏Ê¥•ÔºåÂâáË•øÊ≤≥Êú™ÂèØÊ∏°ÔºåÂêæÊïÖÁõõÂÖµÂêëÊΩºÈóúÔºõË≥äÊÇâË°ÜÂçóÂÆàÔºåË•øÊ≤≥‰πãÂÇôËôõÔºåÊïÖ‰∫åÂ∞áÂæóÊìÖÂèñË•øÊ≤≥ÔºõÁÑ∂ÂæåÂºïËªçÂåóÊ∏°ÔºåË≥ä‰∏çËÉΩËàáÂêæÁà≠Ë•øÊ≤≥ËÄÖÔºå‰ª•Êúâ‰∫åÂ∞á‰πãËªç‰πü„ÄÇÈÄ£ËªäÊ®πÊüµÔºåÁÇ∫Áî¨ÈÅìËÄåÂçóÔºåÊó£ÁÇ∫‰∏çÂèØÂãùÔºå‰∏î‰ª•Á§∫Âº±„ÄÇÊ∏°Ê∏≠ÁÇ∫Â†ÖÂ£òÔºåËôúËá≥‰∏çÂá∫ÔºåÊâÄ‰ª•È©ï‰πã‰πüÔºõÊïÖË≥ä‰∏çÁÇ∫ÁáüÂ£òËÄåÊ±ÇÂâ≤Âú∞„ÄÇÂêæÈ†ÜË®ÄË®±‰πãÔºåÊâÄ‰ª•ÂæûÂÖ∂ÊÑèÔºå‰ΩøËá™ÂÆâËÄå‰∏çÁÇ∫ÂÇôÔºåÂõ†ÁïúÂ£´Âçí‰πãÂäõÔºå‰∏ÄÊó¶Êìä‰πãÔºåÊâÄË¨ÇÁñæÈõ∑‰∏çÂèäÊé©ËÄ≥ÔºåÂÖµ‰πãËÆäÂåñÔºåÂõ∫Èùû‰∏ÄÈÅì‰πü„ÄÇ„Äç) Sanguozhi vol. 1.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Chapters 58 and 59 are dedicated to this battle. Ma Chao rallied an army to attack Cao Cao in revenge after Cao murdered his father Ma Teng and younger brothers Ma Xiu and Ma Tie. Cao Cao was defeated by Ma Chao in the first skirmish of the battle. In the midst of the chaos, Cao Cao fled and was pursued by Ma Chao. Ma Chao shouted that the man dressed in the red robe was Cao Cao, so Cao took off his robe and discarded it to avoid being recognised. When Ma Chao saw that he shouted again that the man with a long beard was Cao Cao, so Cao drew his sword and quickly trimmed his beard until it was very short. Ma Chao then shouted that the man with a short beard was Cao Cao, and Cao responded by wrapping a flag around his jaw. Cao Hong appeared and held off Ma Chao long enough for Cao Cao to escape. The following day, Ma Chao engaged Cao Cao's general Xu Chu in a duel. Xu Chu removed his upper garments, fighting topless against Ma Chao both on horseback and on foot. Neither of them managed to overcome his opponent. Cao Cao eventually followed Jia Xu's strategy to turn Ma Chao and his ally Han Sui against each other. Ma Chao fell for the ruse and believed that Han Sui was planning to betray him so he barged into Han Sui's tent and attacked him. Han Sui lost his left arm during the fight and narrowly escaped under the protection of his subordinates. Cao Cao then took advantage of their internal conflict to attack them and defeated Ma Chao. Ma Chao fled to join the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong after his defeat. ;Historicity Both Ma Chao and Cao Cao's biographies in the Sanguozhi confirmed that Ma Chao started a rebellion in 211 together with Han Sui, Yang Qiu, Li Kan and Cheng Yi in Guanzhong and they formed a coalition army to attack Cao Cao, leading to the Battle of Tong Pass.(Ë∂ÖÊó¢Áµ±ÁúæÔºåÈÅÇËàáÈüìÈÅÇÂêàÂæûÔºåÂèäÊ•äÁßã„ÄÅÊùéÂ†™„ÄÅÊàêÂÆúÁ≠âÁõ∏ÁµêÔºåÈÄ≤ËªçËá≥ÊΩºÈóú„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 36.(ÊòØÊôÇÈóú‰∏≠Ë´∏Â∞áÁñëÁπáÊ¨≤Ëá™Ë•≤ÔºåÈ¶¨Ë∂ÖÈÅÇËàáÈüìÈÅÇ„ÄÅÊ•äÁßã„ÄÅÊùéÂ†™„ÄÅÊàêÂÆúÁ≠âÂèõ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 1.

This proves that the order of events had been reversed in Sanguo Yanyi, because Ma Chao started a rebellion in the first place, and then his clan was exterminated by Cao Cao about a year later. The duel between Ma Chao and Xu Chu is not documented in the Sanguozhi and is likely to be fictional. Ma Chao, Cao Cao and Xu Chu's biographies gave an account of a meeting between Cao Cao, Ma Chao and Han Sui during the battle. Cao Cao rode forth on horseback to speak with Ma Chao and Han Sui. Cao Cao was accompanied only by Xu Chu. Ma Chao had confidence in himself and secretly harboured the intention of charging forward and capturing Cao Cao when they met. However, he had heard of Xu Chu before and suspected that the man with Cao Cao was Xu Chu. He then asked Cao Cao: \\"Where is your Tiger Marquis?\\" Cao Cao pointed at Xu Chu, and Xu glared at Ma Chao. Ma Chao was afraid and did not dare to make his move.(ÊõπÂÖ¨ËàáÈÅÇ„ÄÅË∂ÖÂñÆÈ¶¨ÊúÉË™ûÔºåË∂ÖË≤†ÂÖ∂Â§öÂäõÔºåÈô∞Ê¨≤Á™ÅÂâçÊçâÊõπÂÖ¨ÔºåÊõπÂÖ¨Â∑¶Âè≥Â∞áË®±Ë§öÁûãÁõÆÁõª‰πãÔºåË∂Ö‰πÉ‰∏çÊï¢Âãï„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 36.(ÊõπÂÖ¨ËàáÈÅÇ„ÄÅË∂ÖÂñÆÈ¶¨ÊúÉË™ûÔºåË∂ÖË≤†ÂÖ∂Â§öÂäõÔºåÈô∞Ê¨≤Á™ÅÂâçÊçâÊõπÂÖ¨ÔºåÊõπÂÖ¨Â∑¶Âè≥Â∞áË®±Ë§öÁûãÁõÆÁõª‰πãÔºåË∂Ö‰πÉ‰∏çÊï¢Âãï„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 1.(ÂÖ∂ÂæåÂ§™Á•ñËàáÈÅÇ„ÄÅË∂ÖÁ≠âÂñÆÈ¶¨ÊúÉË™ûÔºåÂ∑¶Âè≥ÁöÜ‰∏çÂæóÂæûÔºåÂîØÂ∞áË§ö„ÄÇË∂ÖË≤†ÂÖ∂ÂäõÔºåÈô∞Ê¨≤ÂâçÁ™ÅÂ§™Á•ñÔºåÁ¥†ËÅûË§öÂãáÔºåÁñëÂæûÈ®éÊòØË§ö„ÄÇ‰πÉÂïèÂ§™Á•ñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÖ¨ÊúâËôé‰æØËÄÖÂÆâÂú®Ôºü„ÄçÂ§™Á•ñÈ°ßÊåáË§öÔºåË§öÁûãÁõÆÁõº‰πã„ÄÇË∂Ö‰∏çÊï¢ÂãïÔºå‰πÉÂêÑÁΩ∑„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 18.

The club got its present name on 1 January 2020 after a merger with FK T√∏nsberg. The football team competes with the name FK Eik T√∏nsberg 871 where the number represents the founding year of the town of T√∏nsberg. History Former logo of Eik IF T√∏nsberg The club was founded as Eik Idrettsforening on 14 March 1928, and included the city name T√∏nsberg in 1989. Before 1988, the district Eik was located in Sem municipality, but Sem was incorporated into T√∏nsberg. It was formerly a team of nationwide importance. The team played their first season in the Norwegian top division in the 1957‚Äì58 season and finished in sixth place out of eight teams in group B. In the 1959‚Äì60 season they finished second in the Main League group B, reaching a bronze play-off match which they won 4‚Äì2 against V√•lerengen. Since this was the first time a bronze play-off was held, Eik became the first bronze medalists in Norwegian football's top division. In the following 1960‚Äì61 season they won the Main League group B, reaching a gold playoff match which they lost to Fredrikstad. Well-known players were Arne Natland, Arne H√∏ivik and Tore Halvorsen, all of whom were capped by Norway. Eik were promoted to the Norwegian top flight in 1982, finished fifth in 1983, and were relegated in 1985. Among the profiles on this team were midfielder Geir \\"Bolla\\" Johansen and striker Nick Sandberg, both of whom played briefly on the international stage, as well as future Tottenham goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt who left the club after the 1983 season. In the 1990s the team was a mainstay in the 1. divisjon, the second tier. After the 1997 season it even contested a playoff to win promotion to the Tippeligaen, but did not win. The team was relegated after the 2000 1. divisjon season, and played in the 2001 2. divisjon. =Merger with FK T√∏nsberg= On 10 October 2001, a new club was founded. FK T√∏nsberg was to be an umbrella team in the district, and was supported by 20 teams in the region. As Eik-T√∏nsberg was the best regional team, FK T√∏nsberg took their place in the league system from 2002 and Eik-T√∏nsberg started anew. Eik-T√∏nsberg won their 3. divisjon group in both 2003, 2004 and 2005, but in each year it succumbed to other clubs in the promotion playoffs. In 2010 the club also contested the playoffs as the 2nd placed team, but was again defeated, and remained in the 3. divisjon. It was relegated to the 4. divisjon after the 2012 season. The men's football team currently plays in the 3. divisjon, the fourth tier of Norwegian football. After the 2020 merger with FK T√∏nsberg, Eik T√∏nsberg advanced a tier since FK T√∏nsberg played in 2. divisjon at the time.

Together, ASBC and Squadron Officer School comprised the Air Force's Basic Developmental Education (BDE) program.Squadron Officer College website Each ASBC class had approximately 12 students and was taught by an Air Force Captain. In addition to newly commissioned Air Force officers, Department of Defense (DoD) civilians in pay grade GS-7 or NSPS Pay Band 2 or above who had completed a baccalaureate degree were also eligible to attend. Air Force guidance was for 100 percent of line, active-duty Air Force officers to attend ASBC, to include direct entry Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard officers who were on active duty for initial officer accession training and follow-on flight training or other technical training. Typical classes included representatives from all major commands and job specialties in the Air Force, and included Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard members as well as DoD civilians, primarily junior Department of the Air Force Civilians (DAFC). History ASBC was activated on 12 September 1997 as part of the Air Education and Training Command. On 8 February 2000 it joined with the Squadron Officer School to form the Squadron Officer College.

Curriculum ASBC was a six-week in-resident course, with approximately ten start dates a year. One week of the course ran concurrently with a combined program at the Senior NCO Academy at Maxwell-Gunter Annex. The aegis for ASBC was The Basic School (TBS), the 6-month initial school for all newly commissioned U.S. Marine Corps officers regardless of commissioning source. ASBC was dedicated to inculcate \\"a warrior ethos in the Air Force‚Äôs youngest officers through a rigorous experiential and academic program aimed at imparting critical warfighting skills while simultaneously introducing students to the full range of Air Force operations, organizational constructs, and doctrinal concepts.\\" A component of the airpower doctrine instruction takes place through classroom \\"wargames\\" that simulate theater-level combat operations.Learning USAF Doctrine Through Simulation (pdf) Prior to its disestablishment, the course has added a \\"combatives\\" element that applied the classroom instruction to the expeditionary combat culture of the modern Air Force. The disestablishment of ASBC was not due to any perceived shortcomings with the curriculum. Rather, given severe financial pressures on the service, it was determined that elimination of ASBC would save over $12 million annually ($13.4 million in 2018 dollars) in temporary duty travel and per diem costs for sending newly commissioned second lieutenants to Maxwell AFB while en route to their follow-on duty stations.

While no permanent version of OPLAN 5029 is known to be in effect, South Korea has repeatedly stated it adheres to the current conceptual plan (CONPLAN 5029) and the United States has said it is preparing concrete plans for collapse scenarios. History In August 1999, General John H. Tilelli, Jr., commander of United States Forces Korea, acknowledged the existence of a scenario and plan by ROK-US Combined Forces Command involving the collapse of North Korea, stating \\"it would be unusual if we didn't have one\\". In early 2005, the South Korean National Security Council vetoed an American proposal to upgrade CONPLAN 5029's general course of action to the specific military plans of an operational plan, where the United States would have command over South Korean military assets in the event of a North Korean collapse. South Korean officials feared the plan might limit \\"South Korea's exercise of its sovereignty\\", though American officials argued it would be necessary for securing sensitive nuclear and military facilities as well as protecting the general public. In June 2005, South Korean Defense Minister Yoon Kwang-ung and US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld agreed to further \\"improve and develop\\" the concept plan. Throughout late 2008, in response to rumors of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il being in poor health, references were made to response plans. Discussions in October between US Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates and South Korean Minister of National Defense Lee Sang-hee over the planned transition of wartime operations to South Korean forces also included continued formulation of an operation plan for a North Korean collapse, after a proposal made in an earlier meeting between the American and South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff. In a speech to the Korea Retired Generals and Admirals Association, U.S. Forces Korea Commander General Walter L. Sharp announced that response plans to a variety of situations involving North Korea, including instability and regime change, had been prepared. The DPRK's Korean Central News Agency responded by claiming that \\"the U.S. and the South Korean war-like forces [had] openly held an anti-DPRK military confab at which they agreed to 'rapidly dispatch reinforcements in contingency'\\" and claimed \\"U.S. belligerent forces would be well advised not to misjudge the army of Songun and the will of the DPRK but stop their reckless moves for a new war.\\" Scenarios A great deal of speculation exists on the outcome of a North Korean collapse, owing to the lack of a detailed operational plan, the circumstances that would lead to an intervention in North Korea, and the choices available to a wide range of actors. Many have speculated on the importance of securing North Korea's nuclear weapons program to prevent their use against South Korea or being used towards nuclear terrorism. South Korean and American officials have stated that American forces would most likely take the lead on securing nuclear material, before and after the planned transfer of wartime operations, though South Korean troops would also be able to aid in matters of nuclear, chemical, and biological materials.http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4361727 =Chinese plans= With the closeness of relations between North Korea and the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government has refused to discuss the existence or details of any contingency plans for unrest in North Korea. Great speculation exists over the nature or intent of any potential Chinese intervention. One report written by the United States Institute of Peace and the Center for Strategic and International Studies suggested a strong preference for authorization and coordination under a UN mandate, but a willingness to act unilaterally in restoring order to the event of a sudden collapse (including the deployment of soldiers and other personnel for humanitarian, peacekeeping, and nonproliferation purposes). Some Chinese specialists interviewed were concerned that the United States and North Korea may strike a compromise deal in which Pyongyang is allowed to keep its nuclear weapons, leaving Beijing isolated in its insistence on a denuclearized Korea, in a similar manner as happened with India's nuclear program. In the trial of former South Korean spy Park Chae-seo, Park claimed knowledge of a contingency plan named \\"the Chick Plan\\" from a director-level Chinese intelligence official (its name referring to a large mothering hen protecting the small eggs beneath her).English Translation of Hani Defense 21: China to Interven in North Korea in emergency.

Park also claimed that no Chinese investment in North Korea had been allowed past this line and that PLA soldiers had been stationed in Shenyang, with operational roads built over the Yalu and Tumen Rivers at the cost of KRW.

On the bottom the alternating sequence of polygons around the circle. In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, a polygon-circle graph is an intersection graph of a set of convex polygons all of whose vertices lie on a common circle. These graphs have also been called spider graphs. This class of graphs was first suggested by Michael Fellows in 1988, motivated by the fact that it is closed under edge contraction and induced subgraph operations.. A polygon-circle graph can be represented as an \\"alternating sequence\\". Such a sequence can be gained by perturbing the polygons representing the graph (if necessary) so that no two share a vertex, and then listing for each vertex (in circular order, starting at an arbitrary point) the polygon attached to that vertex. Closure under induced minors Contracting an edge of a polygon- circle graph results in another polygon-circle graph. A geometric representation of the new graph may be formed by replacing the polygons corresponding to the two endpoints of the contracted edge by their convex hull. Alternatively, in the alternating sequence representing the original graph, combining the subsequences representing the endpoints of the contracted edge into a single subsequence produces an alternating sequence representation of the contracted graph. Polygon circle graphs are also closed under induced subgraph or equivalently vertex deletion operations: to delete a vertex, remove its polygon from the geometric representation, or remove its subsequence of points from the alternating sequence. Recognition M. Koebe announced a polynomial time recognition algorithm,. however his preliminary version had \\"serious errors\\". and a final version was never published. Martin Pergel later proved that the problem of recognizing these graphs is NP- complete.. It is also NP-complete to determine whether a given graph can be represented as a polygon-circle graph with at most vertices per polygon, for any . Related graph families The polygon-circle graphs are a generalization of the circle graphs, which are intersection graphs of the chords of a circle, and the trapezoid graphs, intersection graphs of trapezoids that all have their vertices on the same two parallel lines. They also include the circular arc graphs.Spider graphs, Information System on Graph Classes and their Inclusions, retrieved 2016-07-11. Polygon-circle graphs are not, in general, perfect graphs, but they are near-perfect, in the sense that their chromatic numbers can be bounded by an (exponential) function of their clique numbers..

It is a conduit for communication between industry and academia to ensure that relevant courses can be designed and research initiatives established throughout the UK. The UKAIS has attempted to create a 'uniform' definition of Information Systems: the means by which people and organisations, utilising technologies, gather, process, store, use and disseminate information. By aiming to continually improve the quality and relevance of teaching through innovative and rigorous research the society contributes to both academic development and excellence in IS practice throughout the UK. Part of their role has been to establish links between commercial, government and academic organisations. Teaching, research and practice in the field are supported by UKAIS through its annual conference, PhD consortia, workshops, regional groups and quarterly newsletter. History The society arose from a meeting in 1993 of leading UK academics in information systems. Concerns were expressed at the meeting about the way IS teaching and research were funded which stemmed from a lack of recognition of IS as a growing and important academic discipline. The UKAIS was established in 1994 to remedy this situation as a charity, whose aims are to provide a better knowledge of IS within the UK and to provide a forum for discussing issues in IS teaching and research. It also aims to be influential in obtaining better understanding of the uniqueness of the subject by HEFCE, the UK Research Councils, professional bodies, UK business and Government. They have successfully achieved recognition that IS is not being dealt with sufficiently by such bodies and have suggested ways of improving the situation. Beyond this the work of the society is within the domain involving the study of theories and practices related to the social and technological phenomena, which determine the development, use and effects of information systems in organisations and society. # Theoretical underpinnings of information systems # Data, information and knowledge management # Information in organisational decision making # Integration of information systems with organisational strategy and development # Information systems design # Development, implementation and maintenance of information systems # Information and communication technologies (ICT) # Management of information systems and services # Organisational and social effects of ICT-based information systems # Economic effects of ICT-based information systems References Category:Educational organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Information systems Category:Information technology organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:1994 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations established in 1994 ","title":"UK Academy for Information Systems"},{"id":"28174566","title":"Arkansas Highway 108"},{"id":"28174580","text":"Newtown, () is a townland in the Barony of Ormond Upper in County Tipperary, Ireland.

However, specificity for the Ottawa knee rules is typically poor, meaning that a significant proportion of those who meet Ottawa knee criteria will have no knee fracture on X-ray. The Pittsburgh knee rules have been found to be more specific in diagnosis. Clinical decision guidelines such as these not only avoid unnecessary health care and its costs but also help minimize exposure to ionizing radiation.

The role of firstborn son carries significance in the redemption of the first-born son, in the allocation of a double portion of the inheritance, and in the prophetic application of \\"firstborn\\" to the nation of Israel. Etymology and usage The semitic root B-K-R means \\"early\\" or \\"first\\" in Ancient Near East semitic languages. Classical Hebrew contains various verbs from the B-K-R stem with this association. The plural noun bikkurim (vegetable firstfruits) also derives from this root.Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament 2 p121 G. Johannes Botterweck, Helmer Ringgren - 1975 Article BEKHOR, section FIRSTFRUITS The masculine noun bekhor, firstborn, is used of sons, as \\"Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn\\" (Genesis 10:15), whereas the feminine noun, and female equivalent, is bekirah (◊ë÷∞÷º◊õ÷¥◊ô◊®÷∏◊î), first-born daughter, such as Leah (Genesis 29:26). Derived from bechor is the qualitative noun bekhorah \\"birthright\\" (◊ë÷∞÷º◊õ◊ï÷π◊®÷∏◊î), related to primogeniture, such as that which Esau sold to Jacob. In the plural this qualitative noun \\"birthright\\" can also mean \\"firstlings\\", as when Abel brought out the \\"firstborn\\" (bekhorot feminine plural ◊ë÷∞÷º◊õ÷π◊®÷π◊ï◊™) of his flock to sacrifice (Genesis 4:4). Hebrew Bible The earliest account of primogeniture to be widely known in modern times involved Isaac's son Jacob being born second () and Isaac's son, Esau being born first () and entitled to the \\"birthright\\", but eventually selling it to Isaac's second son, Jacob, for a small amount of food () A similar transfer is shown by the writer of 1 Chronicles 5:1-2 where, although the tribe of Judah prevailed above their brethren, nevertheless the \\"birthright\\", the double portion of two tribal allotments, was Joseph's. According to the Law of Moses, the firstborn may be either the firstborn of his father, who is entitled to receive a double portion of his father's inheritance (compared to the other siblings), (Deuteronomy 21:17) or the firstborn of his mother. provides inheritance rules preventing the husband with more than one wife from leaving property to the son of the favoured wife. =Death of the firstborn of Egypt= The Egyptians also attached significance to primogeniture and birthright. The death of Pharaoh and the Egyptians' firstborn sons at the first Passover is direct recompense for God's identification of Israel as his own firstborn. =Israel as God's firstborn= In Exodus Moses is instructed to say to Pharaoh \\"Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn.\\" This is prophetically attached to Ephraim, the Northern Kingdom of Israel, in Jeremiah 31:9. =Animal firstborn or \\"firstlings\\"= Aside from the sacrifice of the \\"firstlings\\" by Abel, the Law of Moses also proscribes special distinction of animal firstborn. The Second Temple and Dead Sea scrolls The understanding of Israel as the national firstborn of God is found in the Dead Sea scrolls 1Q/4Q \\"Instruction,\\" and probably 4Q369 the \\"Prayer of Enosh\\"Religion in the Dead Sea scrolls - Page 22 John Joseph Collins, Robert A. Kugler \\" \\"firstborn son\\" of 4Q369 (Prayer ofEnosh)\\" as well as in Ben Sira.The self-understanding of the Dead Sea Scrolls Community Page 97 Paul Swarup - 2006 \\"'show mercy to the people called by your name; Israel, whom you established as your firstborn'. Likewise in 44.23b Ben Sira alludes to the recognition that God gives an inheritance to Jacob/Israel as the Hellenistic and Diaspora Judaism The concept of the firstborn was heavily present in Hellenistic Judaism among the Second Temple Diaspora. In the Septuagint Israel, then Ephraim, are God's prototokos (œÄœÅœâœÑœåœÑŒøŒ∫ŒøœÇ) \\"firstborn.\\" The use of \\"firstborn\\" is taken further along figurative lines. In the pseudepigraphical Testament of Abraham disease is personified as the prototokos \\"firstborn\\" of Thanatos, the personification of Death.Abraham meets death: narrative humor in the Testament of Abraham - Page 99 Jared W. Ludlow - 2002 \\"The disease, which eventually will lead to death, is referred to as 'the firstborn of Death', and, as one dies, ... and the 'firstborn of Death', or personified disease,13 is the actual agent of death.\\" In Joseph and Asenath the converted Egyptian princess Asenath prepares to marry Joseph as the prototokos \\"firstborn\\" of her new god, the God of Israel.The Old Testament pseudepigrapha and the New Testament Page 136 James H. Charlesworth - 1985 \\"She is prepared to marry Joseph, God's first-born son. Her new beauty is hers forever (21:4), and her parents are astounded by the change (20:5).\\" Philo of Alexandria comments on the inheritance rites of the firstborn in Deuteronomy, greatly emphasizing and embellishing the superiority of Mosaic Law over Egyptian models.Philo, Josephus, and the Testaments on Sexuality Page 240 William Loader - 2011 \\"Philo then turns to the inheritance rights of the firstborn, expounding Deut 21:15-17. Unlike the biblical text which speaks simply of a loved second wife and a hated first one who produced the firstborn, Philo greatly embellishes the .\\" Rabbinical interpretation According to the rite of redemption of the Son, if the father and mother are both Israelites, the firstborn is required to be redeemed from a Kohen. The firstborn of one's mother is referred to in the Bible (Exodus 13:2) as one who \\"opens the womb\\" of his mother. Therefore, the firstborn of the father exclusively, although considered as a firstborn regarding his father's inheritance, is not considered as a firstborn regarding the requirement to be redeemed, as the mother's womb has already been opened by his half-sibling, the firstborn of his mother. Thus, the Shulchan Aruch rules that only a first born of the mother is required to be redeemed.Kitzur Shulchan Aruch. Translated by Rabbi Avrohom Davis. Metsudah Publishers, 1996. P. 717 There is a matter of dispute among the poskim (early Rabbinic authorities) regarding whether a first-born son who is a Jewish convert (whose biological mother is not considered to be his mother) or from a caesarean section has the laws of a Bechor.See Yaakov Reischer Chok Yaakov 470:2; Kaf Hachayim 470:3. =The firstborn's service to the Jewish people= Originally, the firstborn of every Jewish family was intended to serve as a priest in the temple in Jerusalem as priests to the Jewish people but they lost this role after the sin of the golden calf when this privilege was transferred to the male descendants of Aaron. However, according to some, this role will be given back to the firstborn in a Third Temple when Messiah comes.Sefer Or HaTorah, Parshas Mikaitz (page 688 (shin daled mem)). Sefer Halikutim Beis page 305. Until this time, they say, a firstborn son still has certain other roles. Besides receiving double the father's inheritance and requiring a pidyon haben, a firstborn son is supposed to fast on the Eve of Passover (see: Fast of the Firstborn) and in the absence of a Levite, a Bechor washes the hands of the Kohen prior to blessing the Israelites (see: Priestly Blessing). =Animal firstborns= In the Hebrew Bible the feminine plural noun bechorot is used to describe \\"firstlings\\" of a flock. In rabbinical Hebrew the masculine noun bechor is also used of the first born animal to open the womb of its mother. The animal \\"firstborn beast\\" (Hebrew bechor behema ◊ë◊õ◊ï◊® ◊ë◊î◊û◊î) is listed as one of the twenty-four priestly gifts. Today, when there is no temple in Jerusalem, most Jewish believers do not give first-born animals to Kohanim. Instead it is customary to sell the mother animal to a non-Jew before it gives birth to the firstborn, and then buy back both the animal and its firstborn.Ze æev Grinvald Shaarei Halachah: A Summary of Laws for Jewish Living 2001 Page 384 \\"Firstborn male animals are one of the twenty-four gifts which were given to Kohanim. Many halachos apply to firstborn animals (e.g. one may not slaughter them, eat their meat, etc.). Today, when there is no Temple, and we do not give first-born animals to Kohanim, it is customary to sell the mother cow, sheep, or goat to a non-Jew before she gives birth to her firstborn, and then buy back the mother and the firstborn.\\" Other Abrahamic religions The importance of the literal firstborn son is not as greatly developed in Christianity and Islam as it is in Judaism. * Christianity applies the concept of firstborn to Jesus of Nazareth as \\"firstborn from the dead\\",The Cambridge History of Judaism: The late Roman-Rabbinic period p265 William David Davies, Louis Finkelstein, Steven T. Katz - 2006 \\"He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. ... Undoubtedly this appeared to many as compromising the monotheistic faith of Judaism. ...\\" and adopts the Septuagint terminology prototokoi (plural) to describe the church as \\"firstborns.\\"Three Views on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament ed.

The Gilliss Press, 1922 This firm continued under different names into the 20th Century. Sampson was one of the founders of the Chemical Bank, subscribing to one tenth of the capital stock and asking to take more, but it was not thought wise to let any one hold more than that proportion. Already being a director of the Bank of Commerce, he did not serve as such in the Chemical Bank, but was always one of the leading advisers and directors of its policy, visiting it every day and consulting with its officers. Sampson retired from business at a comparatively early age, but continued to take an active and leading part in the various companies and institutions with which he was connected as director. He was at the time of his death, in 1872, a director in the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company, the Bank of Commerce, the New York Gas Light Company, and the Eagle Fire Company, in most of which, if not in all, he was the largest stockholder.

He served throughout the entire American war of independence, from April 1775 through November 1783, achieving the rank of colonel. After the war, he was a pioneer and surveyor in the Northwest Territory, and became a leader of the militia at Marietta during the Northwest Indian War. He was the first sheriff in the Northwest Territory and Ohio, serving fourteen years as sheriff of Washington County, the oldest county in Ohio. Early life Ebenezer Sproat was born in Middleborough, Massachusetts in 1752. He was the son of Ebenezer Sproat, who owned a farm and was the proprietor of the Sproat Tavern in Middleborough. During his boyhood and youth, he assisted his father in cultivating the farm. When quite young he became interested in the public affairs of the colony. Like his father Ebenezer grew to be a tall man and was of perfect proportions.Hildreth, Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, 230.Weston, History of the Town of Middleboro, Massachusetts, 322. Revolutionary War Ebenezer Sproat was in the field with the Continental Army throughout the American Revolutionary War,Heitman, Officers of the Continental Army, 513.Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors, Vol 14, 777. and was engaged in the battles of Trenton, Princeton, and Monmouth.Hildreth, Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, 231. He was a disciplinarian, but also of cheerful disposition, and was a favorite with both officers and enlisted ranks. He initially served with Colonel Theophilus Cotton's Massachusetts Regiment during 1775. He joined as captain in April 1775, several days after the Battles of Lexington and Concord, and was promoted to major in June 1775.Heitman, Officers of the Continental Army, 32, 513. During 1776 he served with Colonel Ebenezer Learned's 3rd Continental Regiment.Heitma, Officers of the Continental Army, 20. He was subsequently promoted to lieutenant colonel of Colonel William Shepard's 4th Massachusetts Regiment and served with this regiment from January 1777 to September 1778.Heitman, Officers of the Continental Army, 37. While with this regiment, he was one of the officers who wintered at Valley Forge with General George Washington during the winter and spring of 1777 and 1778.Heitman, Officers of the Continental Army, 11. He was said to be the tallest man in his regiment. Ebenezer subsequently transferred to the 12th Massachusetts Regiment, where he served until from September 1778 through year-end 1780.Heitman, Officers of the Continental Army, 39. Ebenezer Sproat next joined the 2nd Massachusetts Regiment where he served from January 1781 until November 1783. During January 1781, he was executive officer under General Robert Howe with a detachment of five hundred men, ordered out to suppress a mutiny of the 2nd New Jersey Regiment at Pompton, New Jersey. Three of the ringleaders of the mutiny were tried on the spot, with Lieutenant Colonel Sproat being president of the court-martial. This was a sorrowful duty for Colonel Sproat; two of the men were sentenced and executed.Hildreth, Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, 231-33. He often said that duty was the most painful ever imposed upon him.Weston, History of the Town of Middleboro, Massachusetts, 324. Ebenezer Sproat was promoted to colonel during September 1783, shortly before the end of his eight and one-half years of service in the Continental Army. An anecdote illustrating Colonel Sproat's good nature with the enlisted ranks concerns a furlough early in the war when he was home visiting his mother. Three private soldiers asked for lunch at his parents' tavern, and when finished eating, asked him the cost. He informed them that the cost was about a shilling for each man. To their surprise, instead of collecting the money from them, he paid each man a shilling and wished them a good journey.Hildreth, Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, 234. Colonel Sproat was also on good terms with the officers such as General Von Steuben, and was a friend of General Washington.Weston, History of the Town of Middleboro, Massachusetts, 322-23. Post-war in Rhode Island After the war, Ebenezer Sproat lived in Providence, Rhode Island, where he married Catherine Whipple, daughter of Commodore Abraham Whipple of the Continental Navy. He purchased a store, and worked as a merchant, but was not successful. In 1786 he was appointed as surveyor for the state of Rhode Island. In that role, he participated in the surveying of the Seven Ranges in the Ohio Country.Hildreth, Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, 234-35.Smith and Vining, American Geographers, 1784-1812, 197. The Ohio Country Ebenezer Sproat became a shareholder of the Ohio Company of Associates, and was engaged as a surveyor with the company.Hulbert, Proceedings of the Ohio Company, Volume I, 26. On April 7, 1788, Ebenezer Sproat and a group of American pioneers to the Northwest Territory, led by Rufus Putnam, arrived at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers to establish Marietta, Ohio as the first permanent American settlement in the Northwest Territory.Hildreth, Pioneer History, 206.Hulbert, Proceedings of the Ohio Company, Volume I, 24.Cutler, Founders of Ohio, 15-17. Ebenezer's wife, daughter, and Commodore Whipple joined him at Marietta the following year. Colonel Sproat, with his tall and commanding presence, was a notable member of the pioneer settlement of Marietta. He greatly impressed the local Indians, who in admiration dubbed him \\"Hetuck\\", meaning \\"eye of the buck dear\\", or \\"Big Buckeye\\".Hildreth, Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, 237.Ohio Division of Forestry, Ohio‚Ä¶The Buckeye State, brochure.Goodman and Brunsman, This Day in Ohio History, 54. Some historians believe this is how Ohio came to be known as the Buckeye State, though a more commonly accepted explanation involves the later presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison. During the Northwest Indian War he was authorized by Secretary of War Henry Knox to superintend the military affairs of the United States in Washington County. He was a founding member of the Society of the Cincinnati,Drake, Memorials of the Society of Cincinnati, 463-64. and helped form the American Union Lodge No. 1 of Freemasons at MariettaSummers, History of Marietta, 294‚Äì95. along with others including Rufus Putnam, Benjamin Tupper, and William Stacy. Ebenezer Sproat was the first sheriff in the Northwest Territory, serving fourteen years from 1788 to 1802 as sheriff of Washington County, the oldest county in Ohio. At that time, the county encompassed lands from the Ohio River in the south, to Lake Erie in the north, embracing half of the eventual state of Ohio. Sheriff Sproat was cheerful and fond of company, and quite attached to horses and dogs. As sheriff, he always rode a horse during his long journeys through the county, accompanied by two or three large dogs.Hildreth, Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, 238. He filled the office of sheriff with dignity, and exhibited a great kindness in his execution of the law. He was often known to furnish a poor family with his own money for repayment of a debt, rather than to make an arrest.Hildreth, Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, 238-39. Later life In his latter years he was fond of physical labor and of cultivating the land.Hildreth, Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, 239. Ebenezer Sproat died in Marietta in early 1805, either on January 7,Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati, Ebenezer Sprout, online database. or perhaps during February,Hildreth, Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, 240. with his oft-repeated wish of a sudden exit fully answered. He is buried adjacent to his father-in-law, Commodore Whipple, and near many other American Revolutionary War soldiers and pioneers at Mound Cemetery in Marietta.Hawley, Mound Cemetery, 415.

The Eintrachth√ºtte labour camp operated from 26 May 1943 to January 1945 as a subcamp of Auschwitz-Birkenau with commanders SS-Hauptscharf√ºhrer Josef Remmele (from the creation to July 1944) and SS-Hauptscharf√ºhrer Wilhelm Gehring (from 18 July 1944 to the end of camp operation on 23 January 1945). Both were brutal in relations to the prisoners, involved in tortures, and personally involved in executions carried out at the camp. Accommodation The camp consisted of a few wooden barracks for the prisoners (the administration building was brick). It was double fenced with high-voltage barbwire. The space between the fences was 1.5 m and covered with sand. There were 10 spotlights and four guard towers in the camp corners. The prisoner living conditions were typical for these kind of camps. The prisoners lived in two-room barracks. The beds were three-level high, with straw-packed mattresses and blankets. Each room accommodated 60 to 80 prisoners. The food was sparse. For breakfast, coffee substitute was given; for dinner, a spinach soup or similar and occasionally a piece of sausage; for supper, coffee substitute, small portion of margarine, some cheese and 0.25 kg of bread, which was meant to be divided between the supper and the following breakfast. Inmates The prisoners were from countries at war with Nazi Germany. The maximum number of prisoners at one time was 1374. The purpose of the camp was to provide workforce to a nearby armament factory (nowadays ZUT Zgoda SA) and the prisoners were employed by companies OSMAG (Oberschlesische Maschinen und Waggonfabrik AG) and Ost-Maschinenbau. Sick or unable to work prisoners were sent back to the mother camp. The mortality was high with a weekly toll of 10 to 15. The overall number of casualties during the period of camp operation is estimated at several hundred (the camp documents perished therefore the exact number is not known). Evacuation The Eintrachth√ºtte camp was evacuated by Germans and taken by the Red Army on 23 January 1945. Part of its facilities were later used by Zgoda labour camp.

The red circle indicates the location of El Baluarte del Conde. La Puerta del Conde La Puerta del Conde (The Count's Gate) was the main entrance to the fortified city of Santo Domingo (in present-day Dominican Republic), named to honor Governor Captain-General Bernardino de Meneses Bracamonte y Zapata, 1st Count of Pe√±alva, who during his tenure saved the city from a siege in 1655 by Englishmen General Robert Venables and Admiral William Penn amid the Third Anglo-Spanish War. The gate is part of a structure called El Baluarte del Conde (The Count's Bulwark), a fort in Ciudad Colonial, the colonial area of Santo Domingo. The fort was part of a larger system of fortifications that ran along a defensive wall which surrounded Ciudad Colonial. The Altar of the Fatherland and Independence Park are located there. Francisco del Rosario S√°nchez, one of the Dominican Founding Fathers, proclaimed Dominican independence and raised the first Dominican Flag, on February 27, 1844. History =Colonial era= The construction of this site began in 1543 and the site was originally named Fort San Genaro. It was designed to defend Santo Domingo from invading armies and attacks by pirates and corsairs. The murralla (defensive wall) was modified in 1655 after the English, led by William Penn and Robert Venables, undertook the Siege of Santo Domingo. The invasion was thwarted by Spanish troops commanded by the Captain General of the Colony, Don Bernardino de Meneses y Bracamonte, Count of Pe√±alva. Due to his valor, the site was named in his honor La Puerta del Conde. The muralla was appended to Fort San Genaro and the structures became indistinguishable and known since 1655 as La Puerta del Conde. El Baluarte del Conde was a typical model of the school of 17th-century bastion fortresses of Italian influence, which are preserved in the Caribbean as a major legacy of 17th-century fortifications. The city's defensive wall reached its full footprint by about the 18th century with the addition of various defensive structures, effectively enclosing Colonial Santo Domingo in a pentagonal wall. La Puerta del Conde was the western entrance into Colonial Santo Domingo. Not much remains of the defensive walls which once surrounded the entire city, except for several sections with gates and forts, including: La Puerta del Conde, La Puerta de la Misericordia, Fuerte San Jose, Fuerte Santa Barbara, Fuerte San Gil, etc. Contemporary Dominican Republic Today, La Puerta del Conde serves as the main entrance to El Parque Nacional (The National Park), also referred to as Independence Park. Inscribed above the arch of La Puerta del Conde is \\"·ªâDulce et Decori est pro patria mori·∏Ø\\", in Latin, which means \\"It is indeed sweet and honorable to die for the fatherland\\". El Baluarte del Conde is a symbol of independence and contains several monuments and structures which attest to the Dominican struggle for freedom. It is common to refer to the fort as La Puerta del Conde/Parque Nacional, being that these are the two most visible and relevant symbols of the Dominican Republic; the park is where the Altar de la Patria (the Altar of the Fatherland) is located. =Parque Independencia= El Parque Independencia (Independence Park) is a historic park within the confines of El Baluarte del Conde so named because it contains the site where Dominican independence was proclaimed in 1844. The Altar de la Patria (see below) is located in the Park. Parque Independencia is nowadays only bound by a section of the original defensive wall, La Puerta del Conde. In 1912, the Park was redesigned by architect Antonin Nechodoma to its present state; no longer was there a street passing through the park. This redesign later facilitated the construction of the Altar de la Patria. =Altar de la Patria= Altar de la Patria The Altar de la Patria, or Altar of the Fatherland, is a mausoleum made of white marble, built in 1976. The Altar houses the remains of the founding fathers of the Dominican Republic: Juan Pablo Duarte, Francisco del Rosario S√°nchez, and Mat√≠as Ram√≥n Mella, collectively known as Los Trinitarios. Within the mausoleum there are statues of the founding fathers, carved by Italian sculptor Nicholas Arrighini, and there is also an \\"eternal flame\\" that is kept lit in memory of the patriots.

Michael is later joined by his father Eddie Moon (David Essex) and half brothers Tyler (Tony Discipline) and Anthony (Matt Lapinskas). A psychopath, Michael is described as a competitive and manipulative risk-taker who lives dangerously. He is a charmer with an eye for the ladies, but is willing to stab anyone in the back. He has a relationship with Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), which is disliked by Roxy's sister Ronnie (Samantha Womack), and marries Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). In March 2013, it was announced that Shepherd decided to leave the role. Michael's last episode is on 1 November 2013, when Michael is murdered by Janine. Shepherd quit to explore new roles. Storylines Michael arrives in Albert Square to lend money to his cousin Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) for the lease of The Queen Victoria public house. Alfie's wife, Kat (Jessie Wallace), is not pleased to see him as she is carrying his baby. Kat agrees to go to Spain with him, but then decides to stay with Alfie so Michael leaves for Spain alone. He returns a few months later, wanting to see his son, Tommy, but Alfie has to break the news that Tommy died from cot death. Michael leaves and is reunited with Max Branning (Jake Wood) and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), with whom he went to school. He stays with Jack and meets his wife, Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack) and her sister, Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), who shows an interest in Michael. Kat, who is still grieving for baby Tommy, tries to get Michael to show his feelings and desperately kisses him, but he rejects her and leaves. Jack and Michael set up a boxing club. Ronnie is paranoid that because Michael is Tommy's biological father, as the baby grows up there will be similarities in their appearances, so she attempts to get rid of Michael by falsely claiming that he kissed her. Her plan fails, however, and Michael and Jack open the boxing club. Ronnie tries again to get rid of Michael by asking Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) for help but is unsuccessful. Michael starts dating Roxy and helps Kat and Alfie reunite when their relationship breaks down. After Ronnie reveals that she swapped her and Kat's babies and Tommy is alive, Michael shows little interest. His relationship with Roxy suffers but they soon reconcile. Michael's father, Eddie Moon (David Essex), visits Alfie, much to Michael's disgust. Michael repeatedly tells his father to leave Walford and to stay away from him. Michael calls Eddie a murderer; Eddie allegedly killed Michael's mother, and Michael rejects his half-brother Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline) when he arrives. Michael sees Jay Mitchell (Jamie Borthwick) and Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) leaving The Queen Vic after breaking into it, but tells Kat, Alfie and Eddie that he saw Ronnie running from the scene. Everyone believes Michael and he sets Ronnie up repeatedly. Roxy refuses to believe Ronnie until she sees a text message on Ronnie's phone sent by Michael and Roxy ends the relationship. Eddie and Michael seem to make amends, but Eddie is unaware that it is part of a scheme, which includes paying a boxer to allow Tyler to believe he is a talented boxer and paying Vanessa Gold (Z√∂e Lucker) to break Eddie's heart. Michael also sets up an unlicensed boxing match between an ambitious Tyler and a superior boxer, Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee). Tyler wins but suffers a seizure afterwards. At the hospital, Eddie reveals Michael has a brother, Craig Moon (Elliott Rosen), who has Down's syndrome. He takes Michael to meet Craig and Eddie reveals that Craig is his full brother, who he placed in a care home. After talking with Craig, Michael accuses Eddie of rejecting him, but Eddie reveals that his mother committed suicide and that she used Michael to get back at Eddie. Michael apologises to Eddie and the two reconcile. Vanessa asks Michael for her money but he says the deal is off, so Vanessa tells Eddie about Michael's scheme. Eddie tells Tyler and Michael's other half-brother Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas) what Michael was doing before leaving Walford, leaving Michael rejected by his family. Michael starts a relationship with Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). When Max and Jack's brother, Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) arrives in Walford, Michael is fearful of him as Derek had bullied him when they were younger. Janine later discovers she is pregnant and the couple decide to keep the baby. Michael suggests to David Wicks (Michael French) that they should team up to get Derek arrested and David agrees. Michael plants stolen goods in Derek's home but Derek catches Michael in the act, and Michael says it was David's plan. Derek uses Michael to lure David to meet him, and Derek forces David to leave Walford. When Tyler and Anthony are in debt to Derek, Anthony asks Michael for help but Michael locks Anthony in his office and calls the police on Derek. Derek threatens to kill Anthony and Tyler, and Michael suggests they leave. They soon discover he called the police and confront him. Janine hears about the trouble and pays the debt. Michael allows Derek to beat him up hoping it will help, but then discovers the debt was already paid. Michael is surprised to find a baby scan photo and annoyed that Janine insists their child will be called Butcher, not Moon. He ends their relationship as he feels she does not trust him and she refuses to let him to be part of the child's life, insisting the child is raised by a nanny. Janine is distraught by this. Michael lures her to a \\"business meeting\\" where he proposes. She accepts on the condition that he signs a prenuptial agreement, which he does. He then cons Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) out of her lottery winnings in order to pay for the wedding so Janine cannot make all the decisions. He persuades Jean to give him more money, promising he will invest it for her. Michael then moves in with Janine. As Jean is working for Janine, Michael worries Janine will find out where his money is coming from and tries to convince Jean to leave her job as the investment will do well. Janine grows suspicious of Michael and Jean's friendship and is angered when Jean tells her that Michael has actually confided in her about his mother's suicide. She then goes to Michael to see if she was telling the truth but he claims that Jean is lying. Jean then invests more money but Michael tries to put her off as it is for The Queen Vic's VAT bill. She soon regrets giving him the money and asks for it back but he ignores her message and claims he does not know what she is talking about. Jean is forced to tell Janine what Michael has done but Michael claims that Jean is obsessed with him and Janine's unborn baby. He attempts to turn everyone against Jean by saying she is obsessed with Roxy's daughter, Amy Mitchell (Amelie Conway), and sets up a bed containing Amy's things in Jean's bedroom. Kat believes Jean over Michael and tries to help her find proof. The day before Michael and Janine's wedding, Michael is arrested for the alleged fraud and released on bail. The truth emerges on the wedding day, when Kat tells Michael that Jean threatened to kill herself if she is sectioned because of him, leading Michael to admit to Kat that he took the money. Michael then confesses to Janine and convinces her to destroy the prenuptial agreement. They marry and Janine then suffers a placental abruption. She is taken to hospital and has the baby by emergency caesarean section. Their daughter is put on a ventilator and Michael struggles to bond with her as she fights for life; he abandons her and Janine at the hospital. However, he soon returns and assures Janine that he will stay. They name the baby Scarlett Moon and they decide to have her christened as she is in a stable condition. Even though Kat understands what he is going through, she insists he repay Jean, which he does, plus ¬£1000 from Janine. Michael begins running Janine's businesses while she in hospital, and becomes a signatory on her bank accounts, which she resents. Janine's lack of trust for Michael is evident and she cannot accept that he is interested in her, not her money. She thinks his behaviour is suspicious, and eventually offers him ¬£450,000 cash, giving him the choice of taking the money or staying, proving that he loves her. Michael does not take the money but calls Janine twisted, saying she will leave their daughter twisted too. Janine begins to doubt herself as a mother and decides to leave Michael and Scarlett. Michael struggles to cope with his daughter and the business, but later discovers Janine has shut the business down and ceased trading. Michael bonds with Scarlett and is a responsible father, hiring Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) as a babysitter. Alice develops an attraction to Michael, and Janine returns several months later, saying she wants sole custody of Scarlett. She manipulates Michael into giving her custody and refuses to let him see Scarlett. Alice works for Janine as Scarlett's nanny, and Michael uses Alice's attraction to manipulate her into letting him see Scarlett. Janine finds out and leaves Walford with Scarlett, so Michael angrily blames Alice but when she states that he is angry because he has no control over anything or anyone, he once again manipulates Alice by kissing her. They have sex after she reveals she is a virgin. However, the next day he coldly tells Alice that he does not love her and that their fling meant nothing, deeply hurting Alice's feelings. This leads to Alice's brother Joey (David Witts) punching Michael in The Queen Vic. Michael then has a one-night stand with Kat, who is vulnerable after Alfie tells her he wants a divorce. Janine returns to Walford with Scarlett and she and Michael agree to be civil when Scarlett is nearly injured while they are arguing. When Janine tells Michael she wants to change Scarlett's last name to Butcher, he pins her up against the wall and puts his hands around her neck, so she has an injunction taken out, stopping him from seeing Scarlett. Michael manipulates Alice, who is Scarlett's nanny again, telling her that he loves her, and they have sex again. He persuades her to carry on as normal when they are not alone, including continuing her relationship with Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel). He decides to kill Janine, so steals her credit card and orders sleeping tablets from the internet, planning to crush them up to put in her drink, telling Alice that they can be a family with Scarlett in Morocco. Alice decides to drug Janine's drink for Michael so he does not break his injunction, but realises that Michael has given a lethal dosage, so does not go through with it and confronts Michael, kneeing him in the groin. When she returns, she says she contemplated telling the police but instead vows to help Michael kill Janine. The next day, Michael invites Janine to meet him at The Queen Vic, so that Alice can babysit, and plant the pills. Alice goes to Janine's, and later Michael finds her at home with blood on her hands. He goes to Janine's house but finds her alive. She reveals that she and Alice have lured him into a trap where he will be framed for attempting to kill Janine. She calls the police and following several arguments, Alice arrives. Michael tries to manipulate Alice further, who tells him to run away, but when he discovers that Scarlett is locked in her room so he cannot see her, he tries to throttle Janine again. Alice stabs Michael in the back to stop him, and then she answers the door to the police. Michael and Janine both try to grab the knife, but Janine gets it first and stabs Michael again, killing him. However, Alice believes she killed him. Janine lies in her police statement, saying that Alice attacked both her and Michael, and Alice is charged with murder. Eventually, Janine is arrested, but she and Alice are both found not guilty of murder. Casting and characterisation Shepherd's casting in the role of Michael was announced on 28 July 2010. Shepherd said of his casting: \\"I can vividly remember watching the first ever episode of EastEnders and I'm very excited to be joining such a fantastic and iconic programme. Michael Moon will be an exciting character to play\\". Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood explained that he had been a fan of Shepherd for many years, adding: \\"He's a fantastic signing for EastEnders, an exciting addition to the Moon family, and is set to cause a big splash in Albert Square from the moment he arrives.\\" Shepherd's contract was a long- running negotiation and he received confirmation whilst filming Waking the Dead. His first appearance on screen was on 1 October 2010. Michael is described as a competitive and manipulative risk-taker who lives dangerously, and a charmer with an eye for the ladies, but he is willing to stab anyone in the back. Shepherd said that \\"on the surface he's a loveable, cheeky chappy, but underneath he has hidden depths which will be exciting to explore.\\" Shepherd opined that viewers would be unlikely to vote for him in polls such as 'sexiest male' because his character is \\"duplicitous\\": \\"I think viewers tend to fall in love with the character you play, and if they go for a duplicitous rogue, I'd be very surprised!\\" He told What's on TV that Michael can be mercenary and has a cruel streak, but \\"there's darkness and light to him, really. Some moments you can see him being really quite cruel and then the next he can be quite compassionate and thoughtful.\\" He told We Love Telly that \\"[Michael] takes pride in the way he dresses and he's always been quite successful with the ladies.\\" Daniel Kileklly from Digital Spy called Michael \\"enigmatic\\", and said he has a nasty side. Kirkwood compared Michael to Ronnie and Roxy's father, Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb), saying they approach life and treat people in similar ways. The EastEnders website additionally calls Michael a \\"sinister\\", \\"flashy\\" and \\"jealous\\" man who \\"wouldn't think twice about screwing people over‚Äîeven those he loves\\". It continues to read: \\"Michael possesses all the charming characteristics of his loveable rogue of a cousin Alfie, a cheeky-chappy with a silver tongue and an eye for the ladies, but with a more sinister and cruel streak. Michael is a serial womaniser and with a string of broken hearts and failed marriages behind him, he‚Äôs got the track record to prove it. Whenever he needs a port in a storm, there‚Äôs a girl he knows that will put him up for a night, a week or more.\\" The London Evening Standard dubbed Moon as the \\"Albert Square psychopath\\"; Shepherd has described the character as a \\"functioning psychopath\\". Storyline development Although Michael leaves Walford when he is rejected by Kat, he returns to see his son, Tommy. Shepherd told Buzz magazine that Michael has feelings for Kat but respects the fact she is married, though finds it hard to resist temptation. When Alfie sees Kat kissing Michael, he feels embarrassed and shocked, but also concerned about Alfie and Kat's marriage, which Shepherd said shows a new side to Michael. Michael is attracted to Roxy but does not want to be tied down. However, after going on a date with Roxy, Shepherd said that Michael likes her no-nonsense, feisty nature and her wild side, adding that they make a good couple. Kirkwood said that \\"Roxy's a little girl lost and Michael could be the worst possible man for her. But how long will it take her to realise that?\\" On 24 January 2011, it was announced that David Essex had joined the cast as Michael's father, Eddie, with whom Michael has a \\"fractured relationship\\". Shepherd said that Eddie's arrival will allow the reasons behind Michael's behaviour and his personality to be explored. Shepherd explained that animosity between Michael and Eddie exists because of \\"something dark and it's still very raw for Michael. It's made him the person he is today. It's why he is so damaged. And dangerous.\\" He added that Eddie's return would stir up bad memories which could have a \\"damaging effect on Michael's relationships with the people around him\\". It was announced on the 10 May 2011 that Michael's half brothers were being introduced; Tony Discipline playing Tyler Moon, and Matt Lapinskas playing Anthony Moon. Kirkwood said, \\"The Moon clan are on their way to becoming an established family in the Square.\\" It was revealed by Inside Soap that the rift between the two is because Michael's mother committed suicide and Michael found her body but he is convinced that Eddie killed her. In May 2011, it was reported that Michael would develop an obsession with Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack) and start to stalk her, with scenes including him sneaking into her bedroom to watch her sleep and going through her underwear drawer. It was also reported that Michael would spread lies about Ronnie, and ask Roxy to wear the same perfume as her sister. A source told the Daily Star, \\"Everyone knows Michael has a mean streak but he is set to get a whole lot worse. He's trying to meddle in as many people's lives as possible. It seems he wants Ronnie all to himself. But what exactly is he up to?\\" The storyline was reportedly filmed in May 2011. Speaking of Ronnie's dislike of Michael, Shepherd said \\"He can't work out why Ronnie doesn't like him, so he assumes she must fancy him.\\" Upon the reintroduction of Derek Branning, it is revealed that Michael and Derek have clashed in the past. Speaking to Inside Soap, Shepherd promised that he will continue to \\"oppose\\" Derek. He commented: \\"It's already been alluded to that Derek and Michael didn't get along in the past. The true extent of Derek's emotional and physical bullying of Michael still hasn't been revealed, but Michael's well aware of how unpleasant he is. Derek's a nasty piece of work.\\" Asked whether Michael will \\"settle the score\\" with Derek, Shepherd replied: \\"Absolutely! Michael holds grudges and doesn't forget anything. He has a bad feeling that the Brannings will become too powerful in Walford if Derek continues to ride roughshod over everyone, so he's definitely in Michael's sights. We can expect these two to clash, that's for sure.\\" After Janine becomes pregnant with Michael's child, their relationship has seemed to be smoother. Shepherd revealed to Inside Soap that their relationship is set to get \\"rockier\\" in the coming weeks. He commented: \\"The relationship is going to get very fraught and rocky‚Äîmountainous, actually. I gather that Janine has made a habit of killing off her husbands, so Michael will have to keep one eye open where she's concerned!\\" Discussing Michael and Janine's connection, he continued: \\"They both have this 'black dog' that follows them around‚Äîit's a darkness. They share similar histories with family dysfunction, so he knows why Janine is so unpredictable and uneven. He sees himself in Janine.\\" Shepherd also joked about how Michael and Janine's child might cope with having such twisted parents. He added: \\"I pity Michael and Janine's baby! How would I rate his skills as a father? Quite low. Imagine Michael changing a nappy! But he sees this as a chance to redeem himself.\\" Shepherd explained why his character starts to turn against his friend Jack Branning in early 2012. It was earlier reported that Michael will discover that Jack has forged Roxy's signature in order to get their daughter Amy and then shares this information with Roxy. Asked whether Michael is worried about betraying Jack, Shepherd commented: \\"No, as Michael doesn't like Jack's attitude towards Derek. Derek has come in and assumed the role as head of the Branning family. He's bossing everyone around and he's committing all sorts of low-level crime. Michael is galled by this. He also doesn't want the Brannings to be too powerful on the Square.\\" Discussing his character's twisted personality, he continued: \\"I like his complexity and I do enjoy playing him. I feel very fortunate to be able to explore his darkness. There's a lot more territory to cover too, so I'm looking forward to that. People have taken to him as well‚Äîbut one woman I met once did scream at me!\\" Even though Janine's pregnancy has brought Janine and Michael closer, Shepherd had revealed that it will not last. =Investment fraud= In April 2012, it was announced that Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) would form an unlikely relationship with Michael. Michael seizes this opportunity to trick Jean into giving him a large sum of money. Michael tells Jean, that because one of the suspects for the murder of Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison) had a large sum of money, the police could easily target Jean as an additional suspect. Jean gives her scratch card winnings consisting of ¬£8000 to Michael so he can invest it into his gym, but in fact Michael plans to use it to pay for his wedding to Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Michael, seeing that Jean is an easy target, decides to con her again by asking her for a second investment by \\"lending\\" him Alfie Moon's (Shane Richie) savings. Even though Jean is initially reluctant at first, she hands over the VAT money for The Queen Victoria. Shepherd expressed his excitement for forthcoming storylines for his character Michael and Wright's character Jean. Speaking to All About Soap, Shepherd said: \\"We are building up to something, but I don't know what the pay-off is. It'll be a real crescendo and the thing with Jean becomes extremely intense. It's a bubbling cauldron.\\" Shepherd later confessed that Michael doesn't care if Janine finds out where the money is coming from. He added: \\"He balances the risk he might be thrown out of the relationship against the benefits and decides it's worth the gamble.\\" Wright has said that viewers are \\"protective\\" of Jean and that Michael's scam against Jean has led to people supporting her. Wright told Inside Soap: \\"It's funny how protective the viewers are of Jean,\\" she said. \\"The other night, I was putting the bins out and a woman screeched up in her car, wound the window down and said, 'Don't give him the money! He's a git!' I thought that was very sweet.\\" Shepherd later said on 24 May 2012 that Michael is playing a \\"dangerous game\\" as his scam intensifies. Wright later reassured viewers that Jean will fight back against Michael and will not remain a victim. Wright commented: \\"This [story is] quite special, I think - it's the longest one I've ever had, but also it's taking advantage of someone with bipolar and making them feel like they are losing the plot - that's a tough story.\\" Wright also said that the storyline is a \\"huge responsibility\\". It was later revealed in 2012 that Jean will become an unlikely Ally to Michael after she urges him not to make a terrible mistake. Wright said that she is thrilled that Jean is standing up for herself as the storyline continues. Speaking on This Morning, Wright said: \\"Jean is a victim and the storyline is about a victim, I suppose. [But] I didn't want it to be played as a victim. So I'm looking for any opportunity for her to seize her own power. Sometimes that might be the smallest thing, like breaking into somebody's house and searching. That's a big thing - hiding under a table is a big thing!\\" =Departure= In March 2013, it was announced that Shepherd had decided to leave EastEnders after three years. The actor explained that he felt it was time to move on from the show and that he had \\"relished every minute\\" of exploring Michael. He added \\"I feel extremely privileged to have had this amazing experience and want to thank everybody ‚Äî most importantly the fans of the show ‚Äî for taking Michael and his numerous flaws into their hearts.\\" Shepherd filmed his final scenes the following month. On 25 August 2013, Susan Hill from the Daily Star reported that Michael would be killed off, following \\"a bitter custody battle\\" with Janine. Reception Michael was called \\"creepy and a bit slimy\\" by a writer for website Holy Soap. In May 2011, Shepherd was nominated in the Best Soap Newcomer category at the 2011 TV Choice Awards for his portrayal of Michael. Kate White of Inside Soap praised the character, saying \\"Darling 'Midnight Michael'...how we love your crazy schemes, oddball ways and eccentric comments. And now you've knocked up Janine, the possibilities are endless. Lots, lots more in 2012, please!\\" Shepherd admitted that playing a villain has made him unpopular with viewers. He said that one woman screamed at him and a child hid behind her mother and would not speak. He commented: \\"It was quite upsetting, but the flip side is that they clearly believe in the drama.\\" See also *List of EastEnders characters (2010) *\\"Who's Been Sleeping with Kat?\\" *List of soap opera villains *Fictional portrayals of psychopaths References External links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2010 Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional con artists Category:Fictional stalkers Category:Male villains Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional characters with psychiatric disorders ","title":"Michael Moon (EastEnders)"},{"id":"28174966","text":"Club Deportivo Domingo Savio is a Dominican soccer team based in La Vega, Dominican Republic.

Since seizing control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 after a violent conflict with rival Palestinian group Fatah, Hamas had been closing down restaurants, coffee shops and hotels in the territory, claiming these places violate Islamic tradition. During the same period, other extreme Islamist groups carried out numerous attacks on establishments perceived as un-Islamic, including coffee shops, beauty salons and even UN-run summer camps. A spokesman for the Hamas interior ministry said it had opened an investigation, and denied a connection between the attack and the closure.

Alarms sounded in Enbridge's Edmonton headquarters at the time of the rupture, but control-room staff were unable to interpret them with certainty and remained unaware of the pipeline breach. It was eighteen hours before a Michigan utilities employee reported spilt oil and the company learned of the escape. For much of that time the operators had shut down the pipeline, so that the bitumen mixture escaped comparatively slowly. But they had thought the alarms were possibly caused by a bubble, in the pipeline, causing anomalous pressure readings, and had twice restarted the line. For a few hours, in total, the material was escaping much faster.\\"Kalamazoo River Spill Yields Record Fine\\", Living on Earth, July 6, 2012. Lisa Song, a reporter for InsideClimate News, interviewed by Bruce Gellerman. Retrieved 2013-01-01. At the time the alarms first sounded the operators were in process of shutting the line down for routine maintenance. The oil was contained to a stretch of the Kalamazoo River as several hundred workers took part in the cleanup. Regional EPA Director Susan Hedman estimated that it would take weeks to remove the bulk of the oil from the river, several months to clear oil from the flood plains, and several more months to clean the oil out of the marsh where the spill originated. However, a year later, a 35-mile stretch of the river remained closed.Johnson, Kirk and Dan Frosch. \\"Rancor Grows Over Planned Oil Pipeline From Canada\\" New York Times. September 28, 2011. Retrieved September 28, 2011. Originally estimated at US$5 million, by September 2011, cleanup costs passed $585 million and were expected to rise by 20 percent. The cleanup expense by summer 2012 had totalled $765 million. By November 2014, the total had risen to $1.21 billion, with an estimated $219 million in costs yet to be paid. Aftermath In June, 2012, authorities reopened most of the of the river that had been closed to recreation after the spill. Part of the river at the Morrow Lake delta remained closed and other sections of the river remain restricted because of the ongoing cleanup of the oil sands product called diluted bitumen (dilbit) oil the pipeline had been transporting.Lawrence, E., (June 21, 2012).

One of the reasons for the vast escalation in time and expense of cleanup was that the EPA had never handled a dilbit spill. In addition, it is reported that Enbridge never informed the EPA of the product distinction. Dilbit, like all crude oil, floats in water but, over time, will sink, complicating cleanup efforts, particularly if dredging is considered too ecologically damaging. Other environmental factors will affect the rate at which this process takes place. This disaster was the largest on-land spill in American history to date.\\"The Arkansas Pipeline Leak Is Another Tar Sands Red Flag\\", The Atlantic, April 1, 2013. In July 2016, Enbridge agreed to pay $177 million in penalties and improved safety measures in a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. =National Transportation Safety Board investigation= In July 2012, the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. federal agency with regulatory authority over the failed pipeline, issued a report representing the official conclusion of the investigation into the incident. The investigators found that the operating firm, which had received an automated signal from the pipeline that a breach had occurred, misunderstood or did not believe the signal and attempted to continue to pump dilbit oil through the pipeline for 17 hours after the breach. Local firefighters were notified, and tried to locate the southern Michigan wetland site of the breach, but were initially unable to do so, further delaying the shutdown of the line. Technicians begin removal of a section of pipe from the Enbridge pipeline oil spill site near Marshall, Michigan The NTSB investigation synopsis pointed to corrosion fatigue as the underlying cause of the catastrophic breach. The incident was exacerbated by the pipeline's disbonded polyethylene tape coating. In July 2012, the cost of the cleanup operations was estimated at $767 million. The NTSB stated the Enbridge dilbit oil spill is, as of 2012, the costliest onshore cleanup in U.S. history. NTSB Chair Deborah Hersman likened \\"Enbridge's poor handling\\" of the spill to the Keystone Kops, asking: \\"Why didn't they recognize what was happening, and what took so long?\\" NPR reported that \\"NTSB investigators determined that the gash in the pipe was caused by a flaw in the outside lining which allowed the pipe to crack and corrode. Now, in 2005, Enbridge actually had learned that this section of pipe was cracked and corroding. ... That same 2005 internal report pointed to 15,000 defects in the 40-year-old pipeline.

According to the party platform the established political parties represented the interests of the privileged classes, and that the R≈çd≈çn≈çmint≈ç sought their overthrow and reform of the parliamentary system. Other demands raised in the platform included universal suffrage (for all persons above 20 years of age), right to form trade unions and to organize strikes, collective bargaining, minimum wages, 8-hour working day, women's rights, free education, increased legal rights to tenant farmers, progressive taxation and the democratization of the military leadership. At the time of its foundation, a party by-law was passed stating that only members of the constituent organizations of the party could acquire party membership. This was done to prevent communists and other left-wing elements to gain influence inside the organization. The anti-communist sectors wanted to block members of leftwing groups like Hy≈çgikai, the Proletarian Youth League and the Society for Political Studies from joining the party. However, large sections of the party considered this by-law as impeding the formation of a single, unified party of the proletarian movement. The by-law was hotly debated within the party leadership. Oyama Ikuo and other younger militants of the Japan Peasant Union demanded that the by-law be scrapped. The result was a compromise, that membership was open for those individuals who were approved by the party branch in question.Beckmann, George M., and Genji Okubo.

The extreme right-wing faction inside the party (represented by section of older Japan Peasant Union leaders such as Okabe Kansuke and Hirano Rikizo) was the first dissident group to desert the party. In October 1926 they formed the Japan Farmers Party. On October 24, 1926, Sodomei and other trade unions withdrew from the party. The party leadership was now in the hands of Oyama Ikuo, Mizutani Chozaburo and Hososako Kanemitsu, and all restrictions on party membership were scrapped.

He was preparing his speech for the Diet in February, but was killed by a right-wing assassin at an inn in the Kanda district of Tokyo.Tsuzuki, Chushichi.

Immediately after the disbanding of the Labour-Farmer Party, the Communist Party instructed its cadres to rebuild the party. The goal to achieve unification with the Japan Labour-Farmer Party was retained. A reorganization committee was formed (named the 'Committee for the Rebuilding of the Labour-Farmer Party and Preparation for New Party'). Oyama Ikou served as the chairman of the committee and Hososako as the general secretary. The committee was quickly banned by the government, but continued to function illegally. In July 1928 the R≈çn≈ç faction broke away from the committee and founded the Proletarian Masses Party. In December 1928 the Proletarian Masses Party merged with the Japan Labour-Farmer Party, forming the Japan Masses Party.Scalapino, Robert A. The Japanese Communist Movement, 1920‚Äì1966.

After having formed this party a final break between Oyama Ikuo and the communists occurred, and the communists began labelling him as a 'traitor'.

In its heyday, it housed retailers such as Big Dog Sportswear, Osh Kosh B'Gosh, Buck-A-Book, and a Sbarro pizzeria. The mall mostly thrived throughout the 1990s, with its apparent decline starting in the early 2000s, after Wrentham Village Premium Outlets opened nearby, siphoning much of their business.

This heartfelt deed, however, causes a terrible misfortune as their parents are killed while on their travels.

Early life Blackburn was born on 11 March 1915 in Bournemouth, Dorset. He was the son of Dr A. E. Blackburn. He was educated at the independent Rugby School. Military service He served in the British Army during World War II. On 21 January 1940, having completed his officer training at Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the East Yorkshire Regiment as a second lieutenant. He was given the service number 113779. On 1 July 1942, he transferred from the East Yorkshire Regiment to the Royal Regiment of Artillery. He reached the rank of captain. On 4 January 1955, having been convicted of a crime by the civil authorities, he was \\"removed from the Army\\". Political career Blackburn stood unsuccessfully for the Common Wealth Party in the 1943 Watford by- election. He then won the King's Norton seat for Labour at the 1945 general election, defeating the sitting Conservative MP Basil Arthur John Peto but at the 1950 general election switched to the newly created Northfield seat. He left Parliament the following year. Blackburn's political career, which began promisingly with his maiden speech being praised by Winston Churchill, was blighted by his alcoholism with the first of a series of arrests for drunkenness coming in 1947. Falling into further legal difficulties Blackburn was declared bankrupt in 1952 and imprisoned in 1956 for fraud regarding the illegal use of a caravan site, and for unlawfully inducing people to buy shares in a worthless company. He served 16 months in prison. He publicly acknowledged his drink problem and even wrote a 1959 book discussing how alcohol had ruined his career.Raymond Blackburn, I Am An Alcoholic, London: Allan Wingate, 1959 Moral and judicial crusader After disappearing from the public view for a time Blackburn returned as a moral crusader, working closely with anti-pornography campaigner Lord Longford. His other campaigns included a failed drive against gambling and attempts to prosecute the films Mera ur k√§rlekens spr√•k and Language of Love for gross indecency, the former successfully, the latter unsuccessfully. Although Mera ur k√§rlekens spr√•k was the sequel of Language of Love Blackburn opted to prosecute the later film first. Blackburn also took part in a number of prominent legal challenges of major constitutional significance, including R v Commissioner of Metropolitan Police, ex parte Blackburn,[1968] 2 Q.B. 118[1968] 1 AER 763 on illegal gambling and the duties of the police, and Blackburn v Attorney-General,[1971] 2 All E.R. 1380 on the constitutionality of the European Communities Act 1972. Blackburn petitioned the court for a writ in regards to the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963. The case was described as follows: \\"A and B are alleged to have committed a crime. A is charged with the crime, convicted and sentenced. B is not charged. At the trial of A there is evidence which suggests that B may have committed or been a participant to the crime. Can the prosecution be compelled to prosecute B?\\" In 1968, the Divisional Court of Queen's Bench consisting of Lord Widgery C.J., Stevenson and Brabin JJ, decided that \\"to prosecute must indisputably be a matter of discretion.\\" The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in autumn of 1972. In 1972, he decided to pursue this matter into the Court of Appeal, which confirmed the 1968 judgment, in a separate matter of enforcement against the British Board of Film Censors and a cinema of the pornography laws then extant. The original Blackburn case in the 1968 Court of Queen's Bench dealt with Blackburn's allegations of a London illegal gambling establishment, whereas in Autumn 1972 the adjudication was in the Court of Appeal of Lord Denning, MR.Reported as [1973] 1 Q.B. 241 (C.A.) The case was noted as recently as the 1998 decision of the Lords Regina v. Chief Constable of Sussex Ex Parte International Trader's Ferry Limited 1998 UKHL 40, concerning police protection for the customers of ITF, a company involved in the export of livestock through the port of Shoreham, during the early months of 1995 when animal rights protesters were trying to stop the trade. The Blackburn cases more recently have attracted the attention of Albert Burgess and the English Constitution Group, in their quest to bring charges of treason against the politicians responsible for the European Communities Act 1972. Personal life Blackburn married three times and had eight children. His first marriage was to Barbara Mary Robison in 1939. Together they had two sons and one daughter. Their marriage was dissolved in 1954. He was married to Marianne Ferguson from 1956 to 1959 when their marriage was dissolved. This was his only marriage to not produce children.

Discovered in 2003 in a submarine hydrothermal vent in the Guaymas Basin about 2,000 m deep off the coast of California, Thermococcus gammatolerans thrives in temperatures between 55 and 95 ¬∞C with an optimum development around 88 ¬∞C. Its optimal growth pH is 6, favoring the presence of sulfur (S), which is reduced to hydrogen sulfide (). It is the organism with the strongest known resistance to radiation, supporting a radiation of gamma rays from 30,000 gray (Gy). Along with the genera Palaeococcus and Pyrococcus, Thermococcus belongs to the Thermococcaceae family, sole family of the Thermococci (called \\"Protoarchaea\\" by Cavalier-Smith), a class in the phylum Euryarchaeota of Archaea. Thermococcus species live in extremely hot environments such as hydrothermal vents with a growth optimum temperature above 80 ¬∞C. Thermococcus and Pyrococcus (literally \\"ball of fire\\") are both chemoorganotrophic anaerobic required. Thermococcus spp. prefer 70‚Äì95 ¬∞C, whereas Pyrococcus species prefer 70‚Äì100 ¬∞C. The resistance to ionizing radiation of T. gammatolerans is enormous. While a dose of 5 Gy is sufficient to kill a human, and a dose of 60 Gy is able to kill all cells in a colony of E. coli, Thermococcus gammatolerans can withstand doses up to 30,000 Gy, and an instantaneous dose up to 5,000 Gy with no loss of viability.  History  Thermococcus gammatolerans was discovered in 2003 in samples collected from a hydrothermal chimney at the Guaymas Basin about 2,000 m deep off the coast of California, (27¬∞ 1' N, 111¬∞ 24' W).  Mechanisms of resistance to radiation  Unlike other organisms, cell survival in T. gammatolerans is not altered by changing conditions in its growth phase, but the lack of ideal conditions and nutrients decreases its radioresistance. The system of chromosomal DNA repair shows that cells in stationary phase of growth reconstitute DNA more rapidly than cells in exponential growth phase. T. gammatolerans can slowly or quickly rebuild damaged chromosomes without loss of viability. Applications  A study has been conducted of its application to the development of new enzymatic markers that are resistant to high temperatures and their application in the study of carcinogenesis and the study of the development of mitochondrial diseases. DNA repair mechanisms of T. gammatolerans could be incorporated into the genome of higher species to improve DNA repair and reduce cellular aging. Etymology Thermococcus: Greek feminine noun therm√™ (Œ∏Œ≠œÅŒºŒ∑), heat; new Latin masculine noun coccus (from Greek masculine noun kokkos (Œ∫œåŒ∫Œ∫ŒøœÇ), berry), coccus; new Latin masculine noun Thermococcus, coccus existing in hot environment. gammatolerans: Gr. gamma (Œ≥Œ¨ŒºŒºŒ±), referring to gamma rays; Latin participle adjective tolerans, tolerating; Neolatin participle adjective gammatolerans, referring to its ability to tolerate high levels of Œ≥-rays.

Jasper is the site of detailed geophysical geological and geochemical studies which suggest that many seamounts, big and small, follow the same pattern of growth and death that was originally used to describe the Hawaiian - Emperor seamount chain. Jasper Seamount is an elongated volcano, with a northwest-northeast summit and several volcanic cones on the summit. The base is 4000 meters below sea level and it rises to a peak of 700 meters below sea level. A total of 15 dredge hauls from the seamount have been collected, and ocean-bottom seismometers have been placed to observe earthquake activity. In-depth studies have given scientists a detailed view of the seamount's internal structure. The model developed by the Jasper Seamount studies closely resembles that of the Hawaiian islands, especially the eruption, in stages, of increasingly alkalic rocks. More than 90% of the volcano is tholeiitic to alkalic basalt in a wide variety of forms, including pillow lava and vesicular lapilli, evidence of shallow submarine eruptions in the past, and a wide range of xenoliths. Jasper Seamount formed years ago. Base volcanics are very similar to those found at Hawaii. The flanks formed about years ago, and its summit years ago. The maintenance of a near-constant silicon dioxide ratio in all of the rocks collected is a sign of increasingly lower degrees of mantle melting. Overall Jasper Seamount rock is very similar, even in trace elements, to Hawaiian volcanics, despite Jasper's much smaller size ( versus ~). These results seem to show that the Hawaiian model could be applied to other seamounts as well, and that many seamounts go through the same processes regardless of their size.

Although many of them speak different languages at the native level, they are primarily identified as native Urdu speakers and hence are called \\"Urdu-speaking people.\\" The term Muhajirs generally refers to those Muslim migrants from India who settled in urban Sindh. Etymology The Urdu term muhƒÅjir () comes from the Arabic muhƒÅjir (), meaning an \\"immigrant\\", and the term is associated in early Islamic history to the migration of Muslims. After the independence of Pakistan, a significant number of Muslims emigrated or were out-migrated from territory that remained India. In the aftermath of partition, a huge population exchange occurred between the two newly formed states. In the riots which preceded the partition in the Punjab region, between 200,000 and 2,000,000 people were killed in the retributive genocide. UNHCR estimates 14 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims were displaced during the partition; it was the largest mass migration in human history. Most of those migrants who settled in the Punjab province of Pakistan came from present day Indian states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Delhi while others were from Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan and the United Provinces. Migrants who moved to the Sindh province of Pakistan came from what then were the British Indian provinces of Bombay, Central Provinces, Berar, and the United Provinces, as well as the princely states of Hyderabad, Baroda, Kutch and the Rajputana Agency. Most of these migrants settled in the towns and cities of Sindh, such as Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur and Mirpurkhas. Many spoke Urdu, or dialects of the language such as Dakhani, Khariboli, Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Mewati, Sadri, Marwari, and Haryanvi and became commonly known as Muhajirs. Over a period of a few decades, these disparate groups sharing the common experience of migration, and political opposition to the military regime of Ayub Khan and his civilian successor Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto evolved or assimilated into a distinct ethnic grouping.Oskar Verkaaik, A people of migrants: ethnicity, state, and religion in Karachi, Amsterdam: VU University Press, 1994 Pakistan Movement Prior to 1857, British territories were controlled by the East India Company. The company maintained the fiction of running the territories on behalf of the Mughal empire. The crushing defeat of Mutineers in 1857 -1858 led to the abolition of the Mughal empire and the British government taking direct control of the Indian territories. In the immediate aftermath of the rebellion, upper-class Muslims were targeted by the British, as some of the leadership for the war came from this community based in areas around Delhi and what is now Uttar Pradesh; thousands of them and their families were shot, hanged or blown by cannon. According to Mirza Ghalib, even women were not spared because the rebel soldiers disguised themselves as women. The Pakistan movement, to constitute a separate state comprising the Muslim-majority provinces, was pioneered by the Muslim elite and many notables of the Aligarh Movement. It was initiated in the 19th century when Sir Syed Ahmed Khan expounded the cause of Muslim autonomy in Aligarh. Many Muslim nobles such as nawabs (aristocrats and landed gentry) supported the idea. As the idea spread, it gained great support amongst the Muslim population and in particular the rising middle and upper classes. The Muslims launched the movement under the banner of the All India Muslim League and Delhi was its main centre. The headquarters of All India Muslim League (the founding party of Pakistan) was based there since its creation in 1906 in Dhaka (present day Bangladesh). The Muslim League won 90 percent of reserved Muslim seats in the 1946 elections and its demand for the creation of Pakistan received overwhelming popular support among Indian Muslims, especially in those provinces of British India such as U.P. where Muslims were a minority.Prof. M. Azam Chaudhary, The History of the Pakistan Movement, p. 368. Abdullah Brothers, Urdu Bazar Lahore.Dhulipala, Venkat (2015). Creating a New Medina: State Power, Islam, and the Quest for Pakistan in Late Colonial North India. Cambridge University Press. p. 496. . \\"The idea of Pakistan may have had its share of ambiguities, but its dismissal as a vague emotive symbol hardly illuminates the reasons as to why it received such overwhelmingly popular support among Indian Muslims, especially those in the 'minority provinces' of British India such as U.P.\\"  Migration  = First stage (August‚ÄìNovember 1947) = There were three predominant stages of Muslim migration from India to West Pakistan. The first stage lasted from August‚ÄìNovember 1947. In this stage of migration the Muslim immigrants originated from East Punjab, Delhi, the four adjacent districts of U.P. and the princely states of Alwar and Bharatpur which are now part of the present day Indian state of Rajasthan. The violence affecting these areas during partition precipitated an exodus of Muslims from these areas to Pakistan. Punjabi Muslims from East Punjab crossed to West Punjab and settled in a culturally and linguistically similar environment. The migration to Sindh was of a different nature to that in Punjab as the migrants to Sindh were ethnically heterogenous and were linguistically different to the locals. The migrants were also more educated than the native, and predominantly rural, Sindhi Muslims who had been less educated and less prosperous than the former Sindhi Hindu residents. The migrants, who were urban, also tended to regard the local Sindhis as backwards and subservient to landowners. Prior to the partition, the majority of urban Sindh's population had been Hindu but after the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the majority of Sindh's Hindus migrated to India, although a substantial number of Hindus did remain in Sindh. 1.1 million Muslims from Uttar Pradesh, Bombay Presidency, Delhi and Rajasthan settled in their place; half in Karachi and the rest across Sindh's other cities. By the 1951 census, the migrants constituted 57 percent of the population of Karachi, 65 percent in Hyderabad and 55 percent in Sukkur. As Karachi was the capital of the new nation, educated urban migrants from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bombay, Bihar and Hyderabad Deccan preferred it as their site of settlement for better access to employment opportunities. The migrants were compensated for their properties lost in India by being granted the evacuee property left behind by the departing Hindus. A sizable community of Malayali Muslims (the Mappila), originally from Kerala in South India, also settled in Karachi.Where Malayalees once held sway , DNA India The partition brought about quite exceptional circumstances that facilitated the implementaion of these strategies.Delage, R., 2014. Muslim Castes in India . India: Books Ideas. = Second stage (December 1947 ‚Äì December 1971) = Many Muslim families from India continued migrating to Pakistan throughout the 1950s and even early 1960s. This second stage (December 1947 ‚Äì December 1971) of the migration was from areas in the present-day Indian states of U.P., Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The main destination of these migrants was Karachi and the other urban centres of Sindh. In 1959 the International Labour Organisation (ILO) published a report stating that between the period of 1951‚Äì1956, a number of 650,000 Muslims from India relocated to West Pakistan. However, Visaria (1969) raised doubts about the authenticity of the claims about Indian Muslim migration to Pakistan, since the 1961 Census of Pakistan did not corroborate these figures. However, the 1961 Census of Pakistan did incorporate a statement suggesting that there had been a migration of 800,000 people from India to Pakistan throughout the previous decade. Of those who had left for Pakistan, most never came back. The Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru conveyed distress about the continued migration of Indian Muslims to West Pakistan: > There has...since 1950 been a movement of some Muslims from India to Western > Pakistan through the Jodhpur-Sindh via Khokhropar. Normally, traffic between > India and West Pakistan was controlled by the permit system. But these > Muslims going via Khokhropar went without permits to West Pakistan. From > January 1952 to the end of September, 53,209 Muslim emigrants went via > Khokhropar....Most of these probably came from the U.P. In October 1952, up > to the 14th, 6,808 went by this route. After that Pakistan became much > stricter on allowing entry on the introduction of the passport system. From > 15 October to the end of October, 1,247 went by this route. From 1 November, > 1,203 went via Khokhropar. Indian Muslim migration to West Pakistan continued unabated despite the cessation of the permit system between the two countries and the introduction of the passport system between the two countries. The Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru once again expressed concern at the continued migration of Indian Muslims to West Pakistan in a communication to one of his chief ministers (dated 1, December 1953): > A fair number of Muslims cross over to Pakistan from India, via Rajasthan > and Sindh daily. Why do these Muslims cross over to Pakistan at the rate of > three to four thousand a month? This is worth enquiring into, because it is > not to our credit that this should be so. Mostly they come from Uttar > Pradesh, Rajasthan or Delhi. It is evident that they do not go there unless > there is some fear or pressure on them. Some may go in the hope of > employment there. But most of them appear to feel that there is no great > future for them in India. I have already drawn your attention to > difficulties in the way of Government service. Another reason, I think, is > the fear of Evacuee Property Laws [EPL]. I have always considered these laws > both in India and Pakistan as most iniquitous. In trying to punish a few > guilty persons, we punish or injure large numbers of perfectly innocent > people...the pressure of the Evacuee Property Laws applies to almost all > Muslims in certain areas of India. They cannot easily dispose of their > property or carry on trade for fear that the long arm of this law might hold > them down in its grip. It is this continuing fear that comes in the way of > normal functioning and normal business and exercises a powerful pressure on > large numbers of Muslims in India, especially in the North and the West. In 1952 the passport system was introduced for travel purposes between the two countries. This made it possible for Indian Muslims to legally move to Pakistan. Pakistan still required educated and skill workers to absorb into its economy at the time, due to relatively low levels of education in the regions which became part of Pakistan. As late as December 1971, the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi was authorized to issue documents to educationally qualified Indians to migrate to Pakistan. The legal route was taken by unemployed but educated Indian Muslims seeking better fortunes, however poorer Muslims from India continued to go illegally via the Rajasthan- Sindh border until the 1965 India-Pakistan war when that route was shut. After the conclusion of the 1965 war, most Muslims who wanted to go to Pakistan had to go there via the India-East Pakistani border. Once reaching Dhaka, most made their way to the final destination-Karachi. However, not all managed to reach West Pakistan from East Pakistan. A large number of Urdu-speaking Muslims from Bihar went to East Pakistan after independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. After the formation of Bangladesh in 1971, the Biharis maintained their loyalty to Pakistan and wanted to leave Bangladesh for Pakistan. The majority of these people still await repatriation, however, 178,000 have been repatriated. In 2015, the Pakistani government stated that the remaining 'Stranded Pakistanis' are not its responsibility but rather the responsibility of Bangladesh. = Third stage (1973-1990s) = The third stage which lasted between 1973 and the 1990s was when migration levels of Indian Muslims to Pakistan was reduced to its lowest levels since 1947. Indian Muslim migration to Pakistan had declined drastically by the 1970s, a trend noticed by the Pakistani authorities. On June 1995, Pakistan's interior minister, Naseerullah Babar, informed the National Assembly that between the period of 1973‚Äì1994, as many as 800,000 visitors came from India on valid travel documents. Of these only 3,393 stayed back. In a related trend, intermarriages between Indian and Pakistani Muslims have declined sharply. According to a November 1995 statement of Riaz Khokhar, the Pakistani High Commissioner in New Delhi, the number of cross-border marriages has declined from 40,000 a year in the 1950s and 1960s to barely 300 annually. Politics =1947‚Äì1958= The Muhajirs (Urdu-speakers) of Pakistan were largely settled in the Sindh province, particularly in the province's capital, Karachi, where the Muhajirs were in a majority. As a result of their domination of major Sindhi cities, there had been tensions between Muhajirs and the native Sindhis. The Muhajirs, upon their arrival in Pakistan, soon joined the Punjabi-dominated ruling elite of the new-born country due to their high rates of education and urban background. They possessed the required expertise for running Pakistan's nascent bureaucracy and economy. Although the Muhajirs were, socially, urbane and liberal they sided with the country's religious political parties such as Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan (JUP). Upon arrival in Pakistan, the Muhajirs did not assert themselves as a separate ethnic identity but were at the forefront of trying to construct an Islamic Pakistani identity. Muhajirs dominated the bureaucracy of Sindh in the early years of the Pakistani state, largely due to their higher levels of educational attainment. Prior to the partition, Hindus dominated the professions of lawyers, teachers and tradesmen in Sindh and the vacancies they left behind were filled up by the Muhajirs. Many Urdu-speaking people had higher education and civil service experience from working for the British Raj and Muslim princely states. Out of the 101 Muslims in India's civil service, 95 chose to leave India. A third of those civil servants were Punjabis but there were many Muhajirs among them too. From 1947 to 1958, Urdu-speaking Muhajirs held more jobs in the Government of Pakistan than their proportion in the country's population (3.3%). In 1951, of the 95 senior civil services jobs, 33 were held by Urdu-speaking people and 40 by Punjabis. The Muhajirs also had a strong hold over the economy, 36 of the 42 largest private companies belonged to Muhajirs, mainly those from the Indian state of Gujarat. Gradually, as education became more widespread, Sindhis and Pashtuns, as well as other ethnic groups, started to take their fair share of the pool in the bureaucracy. But even by the early 1960s, 34.5 percent of Pakistan's civil servants were those who had not been born in the territory comprising Pakistan in 1947, many of them were born in the United Provinces. =1958‚Äì1970= On 27 October 1958, General Ayub Khan stage a coup and imposed martial law across Pakistan. The dichotomy between the Muhajirs' social and political dispositions was a result of the sense of insecurity that the community felt in a country where the majority of its inhabitants were 'natives.' Lacking the historical and cultural roots of native Pakistani ethnicity, the Mohajirs backed the state's project of constructing a homogeneous national identity that repulsed ethnic sentiment. The Mohajirs also echoed the views of the religious parties that eschewed pluralism and ethnic identities and propagated a holistic national unity based on the commonality of the Islamic faith followed by the majority of Pakistanis. By the time of Pakistan's first military regime (Ayub Khan, 1958), the Muhajirs had already begun to lose their influence in the ruling elite. With the Baloch, Bengali and Sindhi nationalists distancing themselves from the state's narratives of nationhood, Ayub (who hailed from what is now the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province), slowly began to pull the Pakhtuns into the mainstream areas of the economy and politics. This caused the Muhajirs' to agitate against the Ayub dictatorship from the early 1960s onwards. The percentage of Urdu-speaking people in the civil service declined while the percentage of Pashtuns in it increased. In the presidential election of 1965, the Muslim League split in two factions: the Muslim League (Fatima Jinnah) supported Fatima Jinnah, the younger sister of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, while the Convention Muslim League supported General Ayub Khan. The Urdu-speaking people had supported the Muslim League before the independence of Pakistan in 1947 and now supported the Muslim League of Fatima Jinnah. The electoral fraud of the 1965 presidential election and a post- election triumphal march by Gohar Ayub Khan, the son of General Ayub Khan, set off ethnic clashes between Pashtuns and Urdu-speaking people in Karachi on 4 January 1965. Four years later on 24 March 1969, President Ayub Khan directed a letter to General Yahya Khan, inviting him to deal with the tense political situation in Pakistan. On 26 March 1969, General Yahya appeared on national television and proclaimed martial law over the country. Yahya subsequently abrogated the 1962 Constitution, dissolved parliament, and dismissed President Ayub's civilian officials. =1970‚Äì1977= The 1970 Pakistani general election on 7 December 1970, Awami League won the elections. The Urdu-speaking people voted for the Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan and Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan. Muhajirs had decisively lost their place in the ruling elite, but they were still an economic force to reckon with (especially in urban Sindh). When a Sindhi, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, became the country's head of state in December 1971, the Muhajirs feared that they would be further side-lined, this time by the economic and political resurgence of Sindhis under Bhutto. The Pakistan Peoples Party government nationalization the financial industry, educational institutions and industry. The nationalization of Pakistan's educational institutions, financial institutions and industry in 1972 by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan Peoples Party impacted the Muhajirs hardest as their educational institutions, commerce and industries were nationalized without any compensation. Subsequently, the quota system was introduced and this limited their access to education and employment. In 1972 language riots broke out between Sindhis and Urdu-speakers after the passage of the \\"Teaching, Promotion and use of Sindhi Language\\" bill in July 1972 by the Sindh Assembly; which declared Sindhi as the only official language of Sindh. Due to the clashes, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto compromised and announced that Urdu and Sindhi would both be official languages of Sindh. The making of Sindhi as an equal language to Urdu for official purposes frustrated the Urdu-speaking people as they did not speak the Sindhi language. =1977‚Äì1988= In the 1977 Pakistani general election, Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan and Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan joined in a coalition named the Pakistan National Alliance. The Mohajirs enthusiastically participated in the 1977 right-wing movement against the Bhutto regime (which was largely led by the religious parties). The movement was particularly strong among Karachi's middle and lower-middle-classes (and aggressively backed by industrialists, traders and the shopkeepers).

It is located at 29 Tacuba Street, near the corner with Bolivar in the historic center of Mexico City. This structure was originally part of a Poor Clares convent founded in the 16th century, but was confiscated by the Reform Laws of the 19th century. Since then, this building has been used as government offices, barracks and even a canteen. It current use was established in 1962, when the Library of Congress was founded by the Mexican government. Since then, the archives it houses have outgrown the building and a number are housed at the Palacio Legislativo de San L√°zaro as well. Poor Clare convent Facade The land in this area was donated in 1568 by the Antonio Sanchez family for the construction of a convent. The convent was constructed for an order of Poor Clare nuns and the institution began with six members. The first church was finished in 1661. It was classified as part of the Baroque architectural movement but very austere, nearly Herrerian. In 1677, a fire destroyed this church. It was rebuilt as a public church and named the Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n church in 1730. The walls and buttress were made of tezontle. The facade, pilasters, arches, vaults and cupola of sandstone with stairs made of granite. The altars were of marble separated from the rest of the church by ironwork railings. The building from the mid 19th to mid 20th centuries During the Reform Laws under Benito Ju√°rez, the convent was shut down and the complex was expropriated in 1859. In 1861, it became the offices of the Direcci√≥n de Beneficiencia. Later, it was used as a barracks and an astronomical observatory. The government sold the entire complex in 1882 for 1,300 pesos to Eugenio Folletete, who then sold it to Carlos Rivas. It eventually came into the possession of General Manuel Gonz√°lez. By the beginning of the 20th century, the complex had become divided. Part of it came back into government hands and used to store legislative archives. The former church building was sold to Manuel Echeverr√≠a, who established a canteen called La Constancia in it in the early years of the century. To adapt the building to this purpose, the bell tower was demolished and a door was opened on the Bolivar Street side. However, beginning from the Mexican Revolution, nationalism was on the rise and Echeverr√≠a was a Spaniard, attracting protests against foreign ownership of the building. These would continue sporadically into the 1930s. The continued pressure finally forced Echeverr√≠a to sell the business to Julio R. Lara Sosa in 1953, as there were moves to nationalize the property. The portion of the complex that belonged to the government from the early 20th century was used to store archives for about 50 years. However, starting in the 1940s, leaks and cracks from age were making major remodeling work necessary. By the 1950s, still nothing had been done and the danger to the archives was getting worse. Many of the archives were moved rather than repairs made because of cost. Another problem was that there was insufficient space to accommodate the students coming in to study the records. Establishment of the library By the 1960s, the church building had fallen into disrepair and mostly abandoned. In 1962, it was acquired by the government and rehabilitated along with the part of the ex-convent it already owned to found the Biblioteca del Congreso de la Uni√≥n (Library of the Congress of the Union). This building has 845m2 of space. However, since then, the library‚Äôs archives have outgrown the building and auxiliary buildings now house archives as well. Archives are now kept at the Palacio Legislativo de San L√°zaro as well. The catalog is still maintained on cards, but a project called ‚ÄúBibliomex‚Äù is converting this to digital format.

Its exact age is unknown, but it is known to have been standing in 1803 and possibly dates back as far as the 17th century. It has been the home of several generations of prominent New Mexicans: merchant Franz Huning, U.S. Representative Harvey Butler Fergusson, writer and historian Erna Fergusson, and writer Harvey Fergusson. History In the mid-17th century, a soldier from Mexico City named Diego de Trujillo established a hacienda near what would later become the Albuquerque plaza. The house was partially destroyed in the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, but was rebuilt by the Trujillo family when they returned to the area in the 1690s. According to some sources, this is the same building that was later known as La Glorieta. Franz Huning, a German immigrant and prominent local businessman, bought the property sometime before 1861 and named it La Glorieta (Spanish for \\"arbor\\" or \\"bower\\"). In 1862, the hacienda was occupied by Confederate soldiers under Henry Hopkins Sibley while Huning was away in St. Louis. Huning returned to Albuquerque in 1864 with a new wife, Ernestine Franke, and moved into the house. During his residence at La Glorieta, Huning added two additional wings to the L-shaped building to create a fully enclosed patio. The house was a popular location for social gatherings and hosted such guests as William Jennings Bryan. In 1883, Huning moved down the street to a new mansion, Castle Huning. He deeded La Glorieta to his eldest daughter Clara on the occasion of her marriage to Harvey Butler Fergusson in 1887. Their four children, including noted authors Erna Fergusson and Harvey Fergusson, grew up there. Since 1942, La Glorieta has been in use by Manzano Day School, a private elementary school. It was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1969 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Architecture and grounds La Glorieta is a one-story adobe building with four wings enclosing a central courtyard. The north and east wings are the oldest parts of the house, while the other two wings were added by Huning in the latter part of the 19th century. The house contains about 12 rooms. In the 19th century, the house was part of a estate encompassing much of the land east of Old Town. Huning, who was described in Harper's as \\"an impassioned tree-planter\\", landscaped the grounds with a variety of trees and shrubs, including a cottonwood in the courtyard that grew to a massive size. Huning also grew crops in the fields around the house and operated a mill, Molino de la Glorieta, on the property. Today La Glorieta has been surrounded by newer buildings, including the rest of the Manzano Day School campus, and no trace remains of its former surroundings. The cottonwood in the courtyard survived well into the 20th century but eventually became diseased and was cut down in 1984.
