He is notable for teaching at Dartmouth College and becoming the first instructor of the first vocational school in America.  Early life  Hale was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, on November 23, 1797. His parents were Thomas Hale and Alice Little Hale. He was the oldest of ten children in the family. Hale's father was an eighth generation descendant of a Thomas Hale from Hertfordshire, England, who came to Newburyport around 1637. Hale attended Atkinson Academy starting in 1813. He entered Dartmouth College in 1814. For health reasons he had to temporarily drop out and entered instead Dummer Academy in Byfield, Massachusetts. There he was privately tutored by Rev. Abbott. Hale entered Bowdoin College at the sophomore class level in February 1816. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from that college in September 1818. Hale first taught a year at Thornton Academy. He was a member of the Theological Seminary at Andover, Massachusetts, in the fall of 1819. Hale became a teacher at Bowdoin College in 1820. He taught natural philosophy and Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding to the Junior class. His teachings to the sophomore class were in advanced mathematics and logic. Hale received a master's degree in September 1821 and delivered a Latin valedictory oration. While he was a teacher at Bowdoin College, Hale pursued theological studies. He became an ordained preacher in 1822 and preached at the Congregational church in Andover. 1827 work by Benjamin Hale  Career  In 1822 Robert Hallowell Gardiner offered Hale a position to become the principal and first main instructor of the first vocational trade school in the United States, a new school in Gardiner, Maine. It was a trade school for the education of farmers and agronomists. Hale accepted the position and delivered an address on the opening of the Gardiner Lyceum on January 1, 1823. Hale established this as the first vocational trade school in America through his curriculum. He had twenty students at the beginning. He organized courses into agricultural chemistry, mathematics, natural philosophy, navigation, surveying, and architecture (using his book Mechanical Principles of Carpentry). Hale also had various courses in husbandry in the winter months. Hale became professor of chemistry at Dartmouth College in 1827. He was for many years an instructor in the Philosophy of Natural History which he taught to the senior class. Hale was at Dartmouth College from 1827 through 1835. He was president of Geneva College (later Hobart and William Smith Colleges) from 1836 to 1858. Hale experimented with student government. He started preaching in 1828 and preached often at the Episcopal church in Dartmouth, Massachusetts.  Family  Hale married Mary Caroline King on April 9, 1823. Their children were: * Caroline Olive Hale b. 16 Aug 1826, d. 9 Feb 1837 *Benjamin Hale b. 31 Oct 1827 *Mary King Hale b. 3 Apr 1830, d. 28 Dec 1838 *Sarah Elizabeth Hale b. 3 Jul 1832 *Thomas Hale b. 11 Jul 1834 *Cyrus King Hale b. 17 Mar 1838, d. 5 Jun 1874 *Dr. Josiah Little Hale b. 1 Apr 1841  Personality  Hale as a youth was known to have the characteristics of a quiet friendly pleasant child and being a studious boy fond of books. Rufus Anderson, Secretary of the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions and Hale's one-time classmate and roommate, writes that their lifetime friendship was founded in similar interests. Anderson says Hale had nearly equal knowledge in all branches of study. He continues in Hale's description of mathematics, languages, and music to be quick and accurate. Anderson says Hale was sociable and willing to strike up a conversation with anyone at any time. Anderson describes Hale as quite religious.  Death and legacy  Hale died July 15, 1863. The various courses in husbandry in the winter he established at the Gardiner Lyceum were followed later by the majority of the agricultural colleges in the United States. Hale conceived the idea of vocational trade schools now seen throughout the United States and the world by his outline of a planned set of technical courses designed for the practical application of science and mathematics to a specific trade.

The ship is in the 130-degree position, with its bow on the left and the starboard deck edge just rising from the water. Parbuckle salvage, or parbuckling, is the righting of a sunken vessel using rotational leverage. A common operation with smaller watercraft, parbuckling is also employed to right large vessels. In 1943, the was rotated nearly 180 degrees to upright after being sunk in the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the Italian cruise ship Costa Concordia was successfully parbuckled off the west coast of Italy in September 2013, the largest salvage operation of that kind to date. Mechanical advantage and difficulties Parbuckling a cask up an incline While the mechanical advantage used by a laborer to parbuckle a cask up an incline is 2:1, parbuckling salvage is not so limited. Each of the 21 winches used to roll the Oklahoma used cables that passed through two 17-part tackle assemblies (17:1 advantage). Eight diameter sheaves, eight diameter sheaves, and one diameter sheave comprised just half the mechanical effort. A major concern during salvage is preventing rotational torque from becoming a transverse force moving the ship sideways. , lost like the Oklahoma in the Pearl Harbor attack, was meant to be recovered by a similar rotation after the Oklahoma. As the Utah was rotated, however, its hull did not catch on the harbor bottom, and the vessel slid towards Ford Island. The Utah recovery effort was abandoned. Righting of Oklahoma Oklahoma weighed about . Twenty-one electric winches were installed on Ford Island, anchored in concrete foundations. They operated in unison. Each winch pulled about by a wire operated through a block system which gave an advantage of seventeen, for a total pull of 21√ó20√ó17, or . In order to increase the leverage, the wire passed over a wooden strut arrangement (a bent) which stood on the bottom of the ship about high. Oil had been removed from the ship through the bottom. The ship was lightened by air inside the hull. There was a large amount of weight in the ship which may have been removed prior to righting, but not all could be accessed. About one-third of the ammunition was taken off together with some of the machinery. The blades of the two propellers were also taken off, but more to avoid damage to them than to reduce weight. Tests were made to check whether restraining forces should be used to prevent sliding toward Ford Island. It was indicated that the soil under the aft part of the ship prevented sliding, whereas the bow section rested in soupy mud which permitted it. To prevent sliding about 2200 tons of coral soil were deposited near the bow section. During righting, excess soil under the starboard side was washed away by high-pressure jets operated by divers. The ship rolled as it should have and was right-side up by 16 June 1943, the work having started 8 March 1943. The mean draft of the ship after righting was c. . Righting of Costa Concordia Costa Concordia parbuckling diagram: In this view looking north (facing bow), chains are on the left of the image (starboard side of ship, facing the coast), sponsons and cables on right side of the image (port side of the ship, facing deeper water). Not shown are the grout pads between the seabed and the platforms. Following its capsizing and sinking in January 2012, the hull of Costa Concordia lay starboard side to the seaward face of a small outcropping very near the mouth of the harbor of Giglio, Italy, resting precariously on the incline to deeper water. To right the vessel, four key pieces of apparatus were required: * a \\"holdback\\" system of chains attached to the island on one end and the hull on the other to ensure Costa Concordia rolled in place; * a man-made ledge inserted into the island face to provide a landing surface for the vessel; * a series of sponsons attached to the hull's port side so as, when flooded, to increase the torque on the hull and to unburden the strand jacks; * an arrangement of cables rising from the edge of the ledge over the sponsons on the port side of the hull. Tensioning the cables started the roll of the ship. At about the halfway-to-vertical position the sponsons were filled with seawater, and Costa Concordia completed its roll to upright upon the ledge. The hull was rotated 65 degrees to become vertical. Parbuckling was accomplished in three phases: #Freeing the hull #Phase of rotation using cables #Rotation by ballasting with sponsons At the completion of parbuckling, Costa Concordia rested on the ledge at a depth of . =Holdback system= The holdback system consisted of 56 chains in total, of which 22 chains were attached to the port side to go under the hull to the island. Each chain was long and weighed about . Each link weighed . =Ledge= The ledge was part steel and part grout. There were six steel platforms. The three larger platforms measured each; the three smaller platforms measured each. The 6 platforms were supported by 21 pillars of diameter each and plunged for an average of in the granite sea face of Giglio. The grout filled the space between the land side of the platforms and the sea bed. It totaled 1,180 individual bags with a volume of over and over in weight. The grout bags contained an \\"ecofriendly cement,\\" and were built with eyelets to aid post-recovery cleanup. =Sponsons= Eleven steel sponsons were installed on the port side of the hull: two long horizontal sponsons; two long vertical sponsons and seven short vertical sponsons. *Each long horizontal sponson **measured , **weighed about , **provided of buoyancy. *Each long vertical sponson **measured , **weighed of about , **provided about of buoyancy. *Each short vertical sponson **measured , **weighed about , **provided about of buoyancy.

The whole blister structure (the two blister tanks, the tubular frame and the three anchor pipes) weighed about . They provided a net buoyancy of to the bow section. =Cables= The cable system provided a force of about to start the Costa Concordia's rotation. =Phase 1 ‚Äì freeing the hull= The hull of Costa Concordia rested on two spurs of rock, and was severely deformed from the weight of the ship pressing down on the spurs. This phase began when the strand jacks exerted force and the ship started to return to an upright position. This was \\"without doubt one of the most delicate phases of the entire recovery plan.\\" =Phase 2 ‚Äì rotation using cables= This phase began when the hull lifted from the seabed. Rotation continued by tensioning the cables operated by the strand jacks, and continued until the sponson water intakes reached sea level. =Phase 3 ‚Äì rotation by ballasting with sponsons= The hull continued to rotate, pulled down by the weight of seawater added to the sponsons. The strand jacks and cables went slack. Redundant systems were designed as a guard against failure. For example, two seawater inlet valves were provided to each sponson.

Secretary of Health and Human Services, also known as Cedillo, was a court case involving the family of Michelle Cedillo, an autistic girl whose parents sued the United States government because they believed that her autism was caused by her receipt of both the measles-mumps- and-rubella vaccine (also known as the MMR vaccine) and thimerosal-containing vaccines. The case was a part of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding, where petitioners were required to present three test cases for each proposed mechanism by which vaccines had, according to them, caused their children's autism; Cedillo was the first such case for the MMR-and-thimerosal hypothesis. The family sought compensation from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), but in order to qualify they were required to prove that it was more likely than not that their children's autism was caused by their vaccines. The scientific community had concluded that vaccines did not cause autism years before the first cases were heard, and concern was therefore expressed that the relatively lax evidentiary standards of the NVICP could lead to compensation being awarded in spite of the compelling scientific evidence to the contrary. This, some vaccine supporters argued, might have serious adverse public health effects by discouraging vaccine manufacturers from producing more childhood vaccines. Though the NVICP had existed since 1988, it was not designed to handle the thousands of cases it received from 1999 to 2007, which led to the establishment of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding in 2002. The trial opened on June 11, 2007 in Washington, D. C.. The Cedillos' six expert witnesses argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded Michelle's immune system, which in turn made it possible for the weakened measles virus in the MMR vaccine to cause a persistent infection leading to autism. In support of this hypothesis, the Cedillos' witnesses relied on the reported detection of measles virus in Michelle's gastrointestinal tract by John O'Leary's Unigenetics laboratory in Dublin. However, the government's expert witnesses conclusively demonstrated that O'Leary's positive results were caused by contamination in the Unigenetics lab rather than an actual infection. On February 12, 2009, the special masters ruled that the Cedillos were not entitled to compensation as they had failed to demonstrate that thimerosal-containing vaccines in combination with the MMR vaccine could cause autism. The special masters concluded, among other things, that the government's experts were considerably more qualified than those testifying on behalf of the families, with special master George Hastings stating that \\"the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment.\\" Background The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was established in 1988 in the United States by the passing of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, and is funded by a 75-cent tax on each vaccine dose. The program's aims were to maintain a steady supply of vaccines while, at the same time, allowing victims of vaccine injury to be compensated more efficiently than was previously possible. The program operates according to a no-fault principle. The family of Michelle Cedillo sought compensation from this program. Cedillo, a then 12-year-old female wheelchair user from Yuma, Arizona, was involved in the first of three test cases chosen by the government to represent the approximately 4,900 other vaccine-autism cases that had been brought before the court. Michelle Cedillo was born on August 30, 1994, and received thimerosal-containing vaccines during the first fifteen months of her life. On December 20, 1995, she received an MMR vaccine. Theresa and Michael Cedillo filed a vaccine injury claim on behalf of their daughter on December 9, 1998 for encephalopathy, but on January 14, 2002, changed their petition to a causation-in-fact claim, meaning they were arguing that Michelle developed autism as a result of the combined effects of thimerosal and the MMR vaccine. They did this as a result of a meeting that had taken place the previous year, between Theresa Cedillo and Andrew Wakefield, at a Defeat Autism Now! conference. In 2001, many other families also filed suit in the NVICP, also because they believed their children's autism had been caused by vaccines and they were therefore entitled to compensation. The following year, the Office of Special Masters of the United States Court of Federal Claims held a series of meetings to decide how to deal with these claims, and that July, issued an order establishing the Omnibus Autism Proceeding. According to the Cedillos, Michelle was developmentally normal until she received her MMR vaccine at the age of 15 months, at which point she developed a 105-degree fever, began vomiting and developed diarrhea. Michelle was diagnosed with autism 18 months after receiving her MMR vaccine. According to The Washington Post, the legal standard to which the cases were subjected in this trial meant that \\"the outcome will hinge not on scientific standards of evidence but on a legal standard of plausibility‚Äîwhat one lawyer for the families called '50 percent and a feather'.\\" It was in 2002 that, given the large number of litigants seeking compensation from the NVICP, the Omnibus Autism Proceeding was established. Its aim was to resolve pending vaccine-autism claims \\"aggressively but fairly.\\" Overview Prior to the Cedillo case beginning, the scientific community had conducted considerable research into the hypothesized link between either the MMR vaccine and autism or thimerosal- containing vaccines and autism. This research had consistently come to the conclusion that no such link existed. However, some vaccine supporters, such as Paul Offit, argued that the standards for proving a vaccine had \\"caused\\" an adverse effect in the NVICP were far too low, and that the court might therefore find in favor of the Cedillos anyway. They also argued that if this happened, the vaccine manufacturers might be discouraged from manufacturing childhood vaccines, which might lead to more frequent vaccine shortages. In the Cedillo case, her family claimed that Michelle was normal until receiving her vaccines, as evidenced by a number of videos of her between the age of 6 and 8 months. They also argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded her immune system, which made it possible for the measles virus to infect her and cause autism and the other health problems from which she suffers, which include inflammatory bowel disease, glaucoma and epilepsy. The evidence presented for this consisted primarily of the detection of measles virus in Michelle Cedillo's GI tract. According to the testimony of Marcel Kinsbourne, a pediatric neurologist and professor of psychology at the New School, the vaccine strain of measles virus caused autism by \\"... infect[ing] the gut and enter[ing] the brain, causing dysfunction of astrocytes and other brain cells, which in turn provokes high levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate, causing a state of overstimulation which manifests itself in the symptoms of autism.\\" =Plaintiff's case= The witnesses testifying on behalf of the state whose testimony attracted the most attention were √âric Fombonne, a psychiatrist at McGill University, Jeffrey Brent, a medical toxicologist at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, and Stephen Bustin of Queen Mary University of London. Other experts who testified on behalf of the state included Edwin Cook, a psychiatrist, Diane Griffin, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University, Stephen Hanauer, a gastroenterologist, Christine McCusker, a pediatric immunologist, Brian Ward, a virologist who, along with Fombonne, published some research which failed to replicate the Unigenetics lab's results, and Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist. Those who testified on behalf of the plaintiffs were H. Vasken Aposhian, a toxicologist at the University of Arizona, Arthur Krigsman, a gastroenterologist at the Johnson Center for Child Health and Development, Karin Hepner, a molecular biologist at Wake Forest University, Vera Byers, a retired immunologist, Ronald C. Kennedy, a virus immunologist at Texas Tech University and Marcel Kinsbourne, a retired pediatric neurologist. On June 11, 2007, the plaintiffs presented their first argument, in which they contended that Michelle Cedillo, as well as other children with autism, suffered from a \\"mercury efflux disorder\\" which was described by Aposhian, their first expert witness, as \\"a problem with getting a metal, in this case mercury, out of a cell.\\" As evidence that such disorders have been documented before, he pointed to Wilson's disease. Aposhian based this claim, in part, on three peer-reviewed papers. The first such study was co-authored by Boyd Haley, and concluded that hair of children with autism contained less mercury than that of children without autism. Aposhian stated that \\"we know that the hair is an excretory organ and that the hair is reflective of the mercury or the metal in the blood, and the blood is a reflection of the mercury in the tissues, and so the fact that the children with autism had less mercury in their hair was a hint or indication that perhaps there was mercury efflux disorder.\\" The second of these studies was conducted by James B. Adams, and found that baby teeth of children with autism had more than twice as much mercury as those of children without autism. Aposhian cited this study as evidence that \\"autistic children have a greater body burden of mercury.\\" Another study which Aposhian used to back up this statement was one conducted by Jeff Bradstreet and Mark Geier, which gave dimercaptosuccinic acid, a chelating agent, to children and concluded that children with autism excreted much more mercury thereafter than children without autism. Aposhian also cited a number of in vitro studies as evidence that thimerosal could cause immune system dysregulation. The following day, the plaintiffs presented their second argument, namely that the measles vaccine had caused intestinal damage. Their witness that day was gastroenterologist Arthur Krigsman, who testified that his opinion in the case depended on whether measles virus had really been detected in the intestinal tissue of Michelle Cedillo and other children with autism by the Unigenetics lab, using a study conducted by him, Dr. Hepner, Steve Walker, and Jeff Segal as evidence that the Unigenetics lab's results were reliable. This study, however, was still in its preliminary stages at the time of the trial, and had only been presented as a poster at the International Meeting for Autism Research the year before, and Walker himself warned that \\"We haven't done anything to demonstrate that the measles virus is causing autism or even causing bowel disease.\\" The plaintiffs also relied on lab testing which had reported that the measles virus, shown, had been detected in Michelle Cedillo's gastrointestinal tract. This argument was refuted by many of the government's witnesses. On the trial's third day, the plaintiffs presented their next argument, which was that the Uhlmann paper, which had reported the presence of vaccine-strain measles virus in the GI tract of children with autism, used reliable PCR techniques to detect said virus. Their witness for that day was molecular biologist Karin Hepner, who testified that \\"... the positive and negative controls used by the Uhlmann authors [led by Dr. John J. O'Leary, who runs the Unigenetics lab in Dublin] were appropriate, that the operating procedure employed in the testing was appropriate to minimize the possibility of \\"contamination,\\" and that the \\"assays\\" utilized were appropriately selected and implemented.\\" She also contended that the two studies that had failed to replicate the Uhlmann paper's results were flawed for two reasons: because they looked at cells of children with autism rather than in their GI tract, and because they did not test children with autism with gastrointestinal dysfunction. Immunologist Vera Byers testified that Michelle Cedillo had a dysregulated immune system, which allowed the measles virus to persist in her system, and that her malfunctioning immune system was in part a result of the virus itself. She also stated that this dysregulation was caused by \\"a combination of genetics and the measles virus vaccination and the thimerosal-containing vaccines that she had received.\\" Viral immunologist Ronald C. Kennedy testified that Michelle Cedillo had a \\"selective immune dysfunction\\". He also, like Dr. Hepner, testified that the Unigenetics lab was reliable and followed appropriate measures to prevent contamination, stating \\"that the laboratory of Dr. John O'Leary, Dr. Orla Sheils, and their colleagues has a good reputation.\\" Kennedy also testified that he attended a meeting during which Dr. Cotter orally reported that his testing reached results similar to those reported by Uhlmann. However, he also acknowledged that this lab never published sequencing data, which is in line with the fact that the Uhlmann paper does not mention the sequencing process. Retired pediatric neurologist Marcel Kinsbourne testified that Michelle was developing normally until December 20, 1995, when she was vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, and that the fever and rash she experienced shortly thereafter was caused by this vaccine. He also testified that Michelle had regressive autism, and that \\"since Michelle has experienced both chronic gastrointestinal problems and the chronic neurologic disorder known as autism, the most reasonable conclusion is that a single causative agent--i.e., the vaccine- strain measles virus--is the cause of both chronic conditions.\\" =Opposing arguments= One of the key lines of evidence presented by the Cedillo family was that Michelle was developmentally normal before she received the MMR vaccine. This, they claimed, was evident from videos taken of her when she was 6 to 8 months old. However, Eric Fombonne testified that Michelle \\"... displayed early signs of autism clearly visibly on family video taken prior to her receiving the MMR vaccine.\\" Thimerosal, a preservative formerly used in vaccines. The plaintiffs claimed that vaccines containing this preservative could cause immune system dysregulation based on a number of in vitro studies, an argument which was refuted by some of the government's witnesses. Jeffrey Brent, the past president of the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, was invited to testify about the potential role of thimerosal-containing vaccines in triggering Michelle's autism. He stated that \\"there was not a single study indicating that any form of mercury could cause serious neurological symptoms in the dosages that were used in vaccines\\" and criticized Aposhian's use of in vitro studies and his equating them to what happens in the actual animal, arguing that \\"the exposure to a cell in a petri dish was far more likely to cause damage than an equivalent dosage in a living system.\\" With regard to specific in vitro studies, Brent argued that the Goth study was flawed because it tested thimerosal on mouse cells, not human cells; because these cells were exposed not to ethylmercury, as the human body would be after receiving a thimerosal-containing vaccine since thimerosal is quickly metabolized to ethylmercury, but to thimerosal itself, and because the cells were exposed to far higher concentrations of thimerosal than could ever occur as a result of the administration of thimerosal-containing vaccines. Brent highlighted similar problems with the Agrawal study, noting that the cells in that study, like those in the Goth study, were exposed to thimerosal, not ethylmercury, and to much higher doses than found in vaccines. He also examined the Bradstreet and Geier study and the Holmes study, noting that \\"much better studies from other investigators could not replicate the results of either the Holmes study or the Bradstreet/Geier study,\\" citing two other peer-reviewed papers which had concluded that hair mercury levels were not significantly different between study participants with autism and controls, as well as a study which had concluded that children with autism had no chelatable heavy- metal body burden whatsoever. Brent also pointed out that, like another of Bradstreet's studies, the Bradstreet-Geier study had been published in a non- indexed journal, the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, which he described as \\"very much of a fringe journal with lots of alternative agendas, and it's not even indexed by the National Library of Medicine.\\" Brent concluded by testifying that thimerosal could not have degraded Michelle's immune system to the extent that when she was vaccinated with MMR nine months later, it caused brain damage, saying \\"That couldn't possibly be the case.\\" In the second set of the proceedings, which pertained to thimerosal alone (as opposed to thimerosal working in conjunction with MMR), Brent testified, with regard to Jordan King and one other child with autism who also served as a test case in this trial, that there was \\"absolutely no reason to chelate them for any mercury-related reason.\\" Many of the plaintiff's experts also relied on the reported detection of measles virus RNA in Michelle's intestinal tissue. This claim was based on results from O'Leary's Unigenetics lab, and was examined by Stephen Bustin, a world-renowned expert on polymerase chain reaction who has authored a number of scientific papers on the subject, as well as a book entitled A-Z of Quantitative PCR. He pointed out that this is based on results from the O'Leary lab, and concluded, based on a 2002 paper by Uhlmann that described their PCR methodology, that this lab contained a lot of contaminating DNA, and that the assays were actually detecting this DNA rather than the RNA which makes up the measles virus. Bustin pointed out that, among other things, O'Leary's Unigenetics lab which published this study neglected to use controls, and also did not discuss contamination. For this reason, Bustin concluded that it was a \\"scientific certainty\\" that none of the children's samples analyzed by the Unigenetics lab actually contained the measles virus. In addition, Bustin and Bertus Rima both testified that Cotter was unable to replicate the Unigenetics lab's results, in contrast to Kennedy's claim that they were able to replicate these results. A bar graph of Michelle's T cell enumerations, left, the lower limits of the normal range of those parameters, center, and the upper limit, right. While Byers had argued that Michelle's immune system was dysregulated, Christine McCusker demonstrated that when compared to values determined by other researchers for children of Michelle's age, her parameters were within the normal ranges. Byers' testimony was countered by that of Christine McCusker, who testified that \\"Dr. Byers had compared the results from several of the tests on Michelle to a set of \\"normal\\" values for such tests. The normal values utilized by Dr. Byers, however, were for adults, not children\\" and that \\"when she herself instead compared Michelle's results to an age-adjusted set of normal values, Michelle's results fell within the normal ranges,\\" with McCusker noting in her expert report that the only marker of Th2 cell activity that was assessed in Michelle's case, namely serum Immunoglobulin E level, was entirely normal.Respondent's Exhibit Z Additionally, Ward's expert report stated that Byers' expert report contained \\"many statements that appear to be entirely unsubstantiated.\\" Kinsbourne's testimony was countered by that of Ward, who noted that if Kinsbourne were correct and persisting measles virus were causing autism, then it ought to be detectable in the blood, since Kinsbourne himself had stated that MV would travel throughout the body via the bloodstream; he also criticized Kinsbourne's expert report for citing Bradstreet et al.'s case series which had been published in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons. With regard to this study, Ward said that \\"the cerebrospinal antibody data from the three ASD children included in this manuscript actually argue powerfully AGAINST a persistent measles infection in the brains of these children.\\" Ward also noted that Krigsman had cited research conducted by Vijendra K. Singh of Utah State University which had concluded that more than 80% of children with autism had elevated measles antibodies. However, Ward stated in his expert report that \\"Unless virtually all cases of autism are caused by measles virus (a position expressly excluded by the MRC, IOM and Cochrane reports), then Singh's work must be in error or there must be an alternate explanation for this finding. We have recently tested anti-measles antibodies in children with ASD and found no differences with control children.\\"Respondent's Exhibit BB Another point of contention was a paper by Paul Ashwood, which had been cited by Kinsbourne in his expert report; however, as Ward noted, Kinsbourne had neglected to mention that Ashwood's paper concluded that \\"the overwhelming majority of epidemiological, population studies indicate there is no established correlation between vaccinations and autism.\\" Additionally, Ward noted that this paper made no mention of the potential link between MMR and autism. =Decision= On February 12, 2009, the three special masters each ruled against the petitioners' causation claims. In his decision, George Hastings noted that, unlike Aposhian, Jeffrey Brent, who testified that there was no evidence that children with autism were uniquely susceptible to mercury exposure, was a medical doctor. Hastings also described Dr. Brent's testimony as \\"persuasive.\\" In addition, with regard to the theory that some children are genetically hypersusceptible to mercury toxicity, Hastings concluded that the \\"petitioners have failed to demonstrate that this theory has any validity.\\" According to Hastings' decision, Byers' testimony \\"was far outweighed by the testimony of Dr. Brent and respondent's other witnesses ...\\"; he also concluded that \\"her insistence that it was acceptable to use adult norms to measure the immune function of infants and young children was, frankly, incredible.\\" Hastings also wrote that Kennedy made the same mistake that Byers made‚Äînamely, comparing the measurements of Michelle's immune system to the parameters for adults, and that while Kennedy testified that Cotter's results were evidence of the Unigenetics lab's testing, that \\"no conclusions can reasonably be drawn\\" regarding these results, noting that they had not yet been published. After examining Kinsbourne's testimony, Hastings concluded that it contained \\"... contradictions and inconsistencies ... concerning the appropriate time period between MMR vaccination and onset of autism symptoms,\\" and also noted that Kinsbourne had not included measles virus as a cause of autism in a chart he wrote for a textbook, but had done so in the proceedings. Hastings, in his decision, noted that \\"all of the petitioners' causation theories depend upon the validity of certain testing that purported to find evidence of persisting measles virus in the biological materials of Michelle and a number of other children with autism.\\" However, Hastings concluded that this testing was \\"not reliable.\\" In his decision, he noted that the authors of the D'Souza paper first performed PCR on PBMCs from children with autism, which resulted in a large proportion of apparently positive results. However, \\"the D'Souza group ... subjected those apparently positive samples to additional testing techniques in order to determine whether the PCR testing using the Uhlmann primers was truly identifying measles virus and only measles virus. ... The application of those two techniques revealed that all but nine of the samples that had initially tested positive by the PCR test using the Uhlmann primers were, in fact, not measles virus.\\" With regard to the 9 remaining samples, the D'Souza paper performed sequencing on 7 of those samples. This step \\"demonstrated that the material, which in the PCR testing had appeared to be measles virus material, was in fact not measles virus material, but human genetic material.\\" With regard to the Michelle Cedillo case in general, Hastings concluded that \\"The evidence was overwhelmingly contrary to the petitioners' contentions.\\" He also said that the Cedillo family had been \\"misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment.\\" The Cedillos appealed this case in March 2009, but the court upheld its dismissal thereof in August 2010. Impact In response to the second rulings in 2010, SafeMinds stated, \\"The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology.\\" Similarly, Rebecca Estepp of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement, \\"The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges,\\" and Generation Rescue's J.B. Handley argued that \\"the courts won't concede something that will bring down the vaccination program.\\" On the other hand, vaccine scientists praised the ruling, with Paul Offit stating \\"the autism theory had 'already had its day in science court and failed to hold up. Additionally, Autism Speaks said that \\"the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases.\\" The Department of Health and Human Services released a statement saying that \\"Hopefully, the determination by the special masters will help reassure parents that vaccines do not cause autism.\\" Similarly, the chairman of the American Medical Association stated that the \\"recent rulings by the Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims provide even more overwhelming evidence that there is no association between vaccines and autism or related disorders.\\" After the ruling, Keelan and Wilson wrote that, in contrast to those who argued that the proceedings gave unnecessary publicity to the scientifically unsupported vaccine-autism hypothesis, \\"the NVICP was successful in its management of these proceedings and met the intent of the original legislation to protect the integrity of the vaccine supply, maintain public confidence in immunization, and provide those injured with a fair hearing.\\" See also * MMR vaccine and autism * Thiomersal and vaccines * Vaccine court References External links * Immunizing Against Bad Science by Lauren Haertlein Category:Thiomersal and vaccines Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit cases Category:2010 in United States case law Category:Health law in the United States Category:Vaccination law Category:MMR vaccine and autism Category:Vaccination in the United States ","title":"Cedillo v.

An≈çshazƒÅd (Middle Persian), known in the Shahnameh as N≈çshzƒÅd (), was a Sasanian prince who was the leader of a revolt in southern Iran in ca. 550. He was the oldest son of king Khosrow I (r. 531-579), while his mother was a Christian and the daughter of the judge (dadwar) of Ray.  Etymology  An≈´≈°zad is a Middle Persian name meaning \\"son of the immortal\\". N≈çshzƒÅd () is the New Persian form, whilst the Greek form of the name is Anasozados.  Biography  Map of the southwestern part of the Sasanian Empire. According to several sources, Anushzad was sometime before his revolt imprisoned in Gundeshapur by his father. According to Dinavari and Ferdowsi, it was because he had converted to Christianity. However, this is unlikely since neither Procopius nor Ibn al-Athir calls him a Christian; according to Procopius, Anushzad was imprisoned for seducing some of his father's wives, while Ibn al-Athir states that he was imprisoned because he was suspected of being a crypto-Manichaean. According to Dinavari, while Khosrow I was campaigning in Syria against the Byzantines, he fell ill at Emesa‚Äîaccording to N√∂ldeke, however, Khosrow never reached the city and instead returned to his capital, Ctesiphon. He further states that Anushzad had spread false rumours of Khosrow having a deadly sickness. Anushzad thereafter raised an army, which consisted of prisoners and Christians from Ahvaz and Gundeshapur. However, according to N√∂ldeke, Fariburz most likely didn't manage to get support from a large number of Christians, which he tried to do so by stating that his mother was a Christian. Nevertheless, he managed to capture Ahvaz and seize its riches. Burzin, who was Khosrow's vice-regent at Ctesiphon, shortly sent an army under Fariburz to besiege Gundeshapur, and informed Khosrow of the revolt. Khosrow thereafter ordered him bring Anushzad back alive if possible, and to kill all the nobles participating in his revolt, but not the ordinary people. The revolt of Anushzad was eventually suppressed, while he was captured and taken to Ctesiphon, where he was blinded.

It follows the plot of the animated film The Lego Movie. The game was published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and released alongside the film in 2014 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One, and on 16 October 2014 for Mac OS X by Feral Interactive. Todd Hansen is the only actor to reprise his role from the film as Gandalf, but Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Nick Offerman, Alison Brie, Charlie Day, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman were credited for their film voices. Gameplay Continuing the trend of gameplay from previous Lego titles by TT Games, the game puts players in control of various characters from the movie, utilizing Lego pieces to make their way through several levels. For the first time in the series, environments are completely made out of Lego pieces. The game introduces two main new character types: Regular Builders (such as Emmet in earlier levels) and Master Builders (such as Batman, Benny, Princess Uni- Kitty, Vitruvius, and Wyldstyle). Regular Builders are unable to normally construct objects out of piles of Lego pieces and instead require instruction pages that are found throughout each level for the construction worker characters to use. Using these, players follow the instructions to build objects with specific pieces like real-life LEGO sets. Master Builders, on the other hand, have the ability to grab Lego pieces from the environment and use them to create something new. Other abilities include using switches as Lord Business in either his Lord or President Business forms, fixing machinery, hacking into computers, destroying gold bricks with lasers, destroying silver bricks with rockets or dynamite, starting fires, and putting out fires. Reception The Lego Movie Videogame received positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the PlayStation 4 version 71/100, the Xbox One version 69/100, and the Xbox 360 version 69/100. Andrew Hayward of IGN gave the game a 6.5 out of 10, calling it \\"Okay\\". He said that some aspects of the game were \\"boring\\", and that the game's \\"diverse backdrops and heroes devolve into tedium and busywork.\\" Game Informer's Andrew Reiner gave the game a positive score of 8 out of 10 in his review. He called it a \\"visual marvel\\" while praising the graphics, characters, and soundtrack. In his generally average review for Destructoid, Ian Bonds scored the game a 7.5 out of 10. He stated: \\"The LEGO Movie Videogame does a decent job telling the movie's story and being its own licensed tie-in game to its own licensed tie- in movie. Thankfully, both are fun in their own right.\\" Giancarlo Saldana of GamesRadar awarded the game a 4/5, writing: \\"The Lego Movie Videogame is one of the better movie tie-in games out there, and it may even get you to see the film if you haven‚Äôt already. Its action-packed stages will keep you on your toes, and all those cheeky quips from its characters are guaranteed to put a smile on your face. It may not bring anything new to the table, but The Lego Movie Videogame takes some of the best elements from the series and delivers it all in a charming package anyone will want to play with.\\" Saldana had minor criticisms of the game; he disliked the smaller amount of content (compared to other Lego games) and said glitches can ruin the fun. Christopher Bratt of VideoGamer.com scored the game a 6/10, mostly praising the mix of humour, locations, and characters. Bratt's main criticisms were concerning the game's familiarity, saying: \\"The Lego Movies main problem is its origin. Whereas past movie tie-ins have gleefully poked fun at their source material, adapting Hogwarts, Middle-Earth, or Gotham (among others) to fit the Lego universe, this game isn't given that opportunity, and is poorer for it. Using clips from the film during cutscenes and rarely making its own gags, I‚Äôm reminded that I don‚Äôt play the Lego games for their simplistic gameplay, which predictably hasn't changed here. Instead, I play them to see other, famous worlds reimagined with that Lego magic. There's nothing wrong with The Lego Movie Videogame, but it just doesn't have the same appeal as other entries in the series.\\" Jason Venter of GameSpot gave the game a positive review; Venter scored the game a 7 out of 10 and stated: \\"The Lego Movie Videogame is a faithful take on its source material, with just enough of the film's content missing to make it worth getting out to the theater, but not so much that the game's narrative becomes difficult to follow. The added interaction is also welcome and is handled in a manner that keeps the experience approachable and generally refined, even if it isn't always as creative and varied as you might hope. While not everything is awesome, The Lego Movie Videogame should be just the ticket if you're ready to spend another 10 to 12 hours in the fantastic world of animated plastic blocks.\\" Blake Peterson from Game Revolution scored the game a 3.5 out of 5. He cited the \\"great\\" comedy, \\"high\\" replay value, and \\"fun\\" mini-games as positives, but criticized the presence of technical issues, disliked the platforming gameplay sections, and felt that the game should have looked better graphically. Peterson thought the first half of the game featured \\"strong\\" gameplay, but felt the second half's gameplay was \\"weak\\". Peterson also praised the game for capturing the feel of the movie. Marc Camron of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a positive score of 8.5 out of 10 in his review. Camron stated: \\"Another smash-and-collect game featuring everyone‚Äôs favorite building toy. This time around, it‚Äôs based on the new animated movie and offers many of the hilarious characters fresh off the screen.

Monroe initially rose to prominence for writing a blog titled A Girl Called Jack (now renamed Cooking on a Bootstrap), and has since written for publications such as The Echo, The Huffington Post, The Guardian, and The New Yorker, as well as publishing several cookbooks focusing on \\"austerity recipes\\" and meals which can be made on a tight budget. Early life Monroe was born in Southend-on-Sea in 1988, to David Hadjicostas MBE, and Evelyn (n√©e Beatty) Hadjicostas, a former nurse. Her father is of Greek-Cypriot heritage; he was in the British Army for seven years and in the fire service for 30 years. He was awarded an MBE in 2007 Birthday Honours for services to children and families. Monroe has three siblings. Described as coming from a working- class background, Monroe passed the 11-plus examinations and attended Westcliff High School for Girls, a grammar school in Westcliff-on-Sea, before leaving at age 16, \\"bullied and disillusioned\\", with insufficient GCSEs to progress to A-level (she sat 7 and passed 4 and a half of them). Monroe left home and worked in a chip shop, before taking a job as a call handler for Essex County Fire and Rescue Service. After having a child, she was unable to arrange the work around childcare responsibilities, and was unable to negotiate adjustments to her working pattern to make continued employment feasible. Monroe resigned the post after serving between 2007 and 2011. After leaving the fire service, Monroe began going by the forename Jack ‚Äì being short for \\"Jack of all trades\\". She spent the following 18 months on benefits and looking for work, and moved from relative affluence to poverty and financial hardship.Monroe, Jack.  Career  = Writing = Monroe came to prominence in the media through writing the blog A Girl Called Jack, sharing cheap recipes created as a single parent with a young child, and aiming to provide family meals for less than ¬£10 per week. In December 2015, the blog was renamed as Cooking on a Bootstrap. In 2012, Monroe became a weekly columnist for The Echo, Part 1 , Part 2 . a south Essex daily newspaper, and in February 2013, was taken on by the same as a trainee reporter ‚Äì the timing was fortunate, as she was having difficulty affording nursery fees. Monroe was later retained as an unpaid columnist for The Huffington Post, before signing a publishing deal with Penguin Group. The book deal, reported as worth ¬£25,000, resulted in housing benefit being cut off and Monroe came close to being evicted, which led to moving into cheaper accommodation. Despite working every day, she was unable to make ends meet. By January 2014, finances had improved, and Monroe was able to move into a small two-bedroom flat with her son. Monroe formerly wrote a twice-monthly food and recipe column for The Guardian and additionally contributed a number of political columns, as well as being featured in The New York Times and The New Yorker. Monroe has written several budget cooking recipe books. In April 2020 it was announced that Monroe would co-host Daily Kitchen Live on BBC One alongside Matt Tebbutt. The programme, made in response to issues stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, offered tips and guidance to families struggling with limited resources, and aired daily for a two week period that commenced on 14 April 2020. = Campaigning and politics = Monroe has been an active campaigner for a number of causes in the UK, particularly those concerned with poverty and hunger, campaigning alongside organisations such as Unite, The Trussell Trust, Child Poverty Action Group and Oxfam. In 2013, Monroe appeared in a six-week advertising campaign for Sainsbury's supermarket. Monroe accepted the equivalent of the living wage for the six weeks that the campaign ran and donated the remainder of the fee to charities including a food bank. Monroe was a supporter of the Labour Party, and appeared in a Labour campaign video in October 2013. She left the party in March 2015 after disagreeing with its rhetoric on immigration, and became a member of the Green Party of England and Wales. In November 2014, Monroe said on Twitter that David Cameron \\"uses stories about his dead son as misty-eyed rhetoric to legitimise selling our NHS to his friends\\". The Daily Mail journalist Sarah Vine criticised Monroe for using the death of Cameron's son for political purposes and \\"choosing\\" a life of poverty. The Independent described this as a \\"caustic attack\\", and Monroe replied on Twitter that the column was \\"homophobic, transphobic, deadnaming [and] ignorant\\". In 2015, Monroe won the Women of the Future Award in the media category. Monroe was \\"surprised\\", saying \\"I'm not sure I'll even be a woman in the future\\". The award was won after Monroe came out as non- binary, which created some controversy. The subsequent \\"gender debate\\" angered Monroe and she questioned the headlines of some newspapers, saying \\"Because of my trans identity, I'm attacked for accepting a real woman's award.\\" In April 2016, Monroe appeared online supporting the Women's Equality Party. In the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Monroe intended to stand in Southend West as a candidate for the National Health Action Party, but withdrew after receiving death threats and because of health problems caused by arthritis. Speaking in 2014, Monroe described life as having \\"changed beyond recognition\\", but said that she is still affected by her experience of poverty. The University of Essex announced in May 2015 that it would be awarding Monroe an honorary degree. Monroe appeared on BBC television's late night political programme This Week in June 2015 and again in May 2019.  Personal life  Monroe came out as non-binary in October 2015, and goes by both \\"she\\" and \\"they\\" pronouns. She has said she did not change her name to Jack while still working at the fire service, out of concern over \\"the potential for deadnaming and bullying in a not-particularly-tolerant organisation. Not a great place to be gay, let alone genderqueer.\\" She also did not take part in a fire-service passing out ceremony, because protocol would have required her to wear a skirt. During this period, Monroe also had a brief relationship with a close male friend which resulted in a son. She also had a long-term relationship with a woman which ended shortly after Monroe told her partner she was considering a mastectomy. Monroe had previously identified as a cisgender lesbian, and prior to coming out as non-binary was careful to downplay any suggestions of gender ambiguity: in a February 2014 interview, she described herself as a \\"lefty, liberal, lezzer cook\\" who had reassured her parents that she identified as female. \\"I was like, no, I'm a little bit tomboyish, a little bit butch. But I have no immediate plans to transition.\\" In 2014, it was reported that Monroe and her son were living with Monroe's then girlfriend Allegra McEvedy and McEvedy's daughter in London; the relationship ended in October 2015. In 2017, Monroe revealed she was suffering from acute arthritis, citing the affliction as a partial cause for her suspending her campaign for candidacy in the National Health Action Party. In January 2019, Monroe stated that she was recovering from alcoholism, discussing how drinking had affected her work and personal life. Later that month, Monroe announced her engagement to her partner, Louisa Compton. Monroe was diagnosed with autism and ADHD as a child, though was not made aware of this until she was an adult. =Legal action= Monroe initiated legal action in 2015 after the Daily Mail claimed that \\"Jack\\" was not her \\"real\\" name, and has requested that her birth name not be used by the media. In 2017, Monroe won a libel case against newspaper columnist and television personality Katie Hopkins, after Hopkins suggested on Twitter that Monroe was supportive of vandalism of a war memorial, having confused Monroe with journalist Laurie Penny. Instead of apologising, Hopkins then labelled Monroe \\"social anthrax\\". The High Court awarded Monroe ¬£24,000 in damages plus costs.Judgment: Monroe -v- Hopkins , HM Courts and Tribunal Service 2017.

The land used to be a mine and now needs significant environmental remediation and reclamation. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress; a previous version () passed the House during the 112th United States Congress, but never received a vote in the Senate. Cleanup efforts of the land are expected to cost between $300 million and $1.2 billion, depending on various estimates and cleanup targets. Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Three Kids Mine Remediation and Reclamation Act would direct the United States Department of the Interior to convey to the Henderson Redevelopment Agency of the city of Henderson, Nevada, the Three Kids Mine Federal Land (the parcel or parcels of federal land consisting of approximately 948 specified acres) for the environmental remediation and reclamation of the Three Kids Mine Project Site. The bill also would direct the Secretary of the Interior to administratively adjust the fair market value of the Three Kids Mine Federal Land based on the reasonable approximate assessment, remediation, and reclamation costs for the Three Kids Mine Project Area. The bill would then require the Henderson Redevelopment Agency to pay the fair market value, if any for the Three Kids Mine Federal Land. The bill would adjust the boundary of the River Mountains Area of Critical Environmental Concern. It also releases the United States, upon making the conveyance, from any and all liabilities or claims of any kind or nature arising from the presence, release, or threat of release of any hazardous substance or mining related materials at the Three Kids Mine Project Site. Finally, it would make the provisions of the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998 () inapplicable to land conveyed under this Act. Congressional Budget office report H.R. 697 would require the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to sell 950 acres of federal land, some of which are contaminated by hazardous waste, to the city of Henderson, Nevada. Under the bill, the agency would determine the sale price by estimating the fair market value of the land and reducing that amount by the estimated cost of any necessary environmental remediation and mining reclamation activities at the site. The city of Henderson would be responsible for those costs following the sale. Based on information from the BLM, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. Roughly 15 percent of the lands that would be sold under the bill are contaminated and will require mine reclamation and environmental remediation. Based on information provided by the BLM and the city of Henderson, the CBO estimates that the agency is unlikely to receive any financial compensation for any of the land because remediation and reclamation costs would exceed the land‚Äôs fair market value. Because the CBO expects that the affected lands would not generate any receipts under current law over the next 10 years, we estimate that conveying the lands under the bill would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Procedural history The Three Kids Mine Remediation and Reclamation Act was introduced into the House by Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) on February 14, 2013. The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and two of its subcommittees: the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation. On July 8, 2013, it was reported (amended) by the Committee on Natural Resources alongside House Report 113-137. On Friday, July 19, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 697 would be on the schedule for consideration under a suspension of the rules on July 22, 2013. The bill passed by voice vote on July 22, 2013. The bill was received in the United States Senate and referred to the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. On July 9, 2014, the Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on July 25, 2014. Debate and discussion The City of Henderson, NV paid a lobbyist organization $10,000 in 2013, part of which went to fund lobbying activities in favor of the Three Kids Mine Remediation and Reclamation Act. In 2013, the Las Vegas Sun listed off the Three Kids Mine Remediation and Reclamation Act as item number three in its list of \\"Top 10 Nevada land swaps stalled in Congress,\\" noting that 87 percent of Nevada's land is federally owned.

Barco (March 13, 1926 ‚Äì May 27, 2000) was an American lawyer and cable television (CATV) executive who played a key role in development of the cable industry. Early years Yolanda Barco was born on March 13, 1926 in Meadville, Pennsylvania, where she would live for the rest of her life. Her father George Barco (born April 11, 1907) was the son of Italian immigrants. Her mother was Emmaline DeLorenzo. George Barco graduated from Meadville High School in 1926, then attended Allegheny College in Meadville while Yolando was an infant, graduating in 1930 with a bachelor of science degree. He then enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh to study law, and on after graduating became assistant district attorney and then deputy attorney general in Pennsylvania, before founding a private law practice. Yolanda Barco also studied at Meadville High School and Allegheny College. She graduated magna cum laude with a degree in economics in 1946. She went on to the University of Pittsburgh law school, graduating in 1949. Career Yolanda Barco and her father formed a legal partnership, Barco & Barco. George Barco became interested in television. In 1953 he established Meadville Master Antenna (MMA), a cable TV system, with help from Milton Shapp of Jerrold Electronics. Yolanda Barco was appointed general manager of the company, and in 1959 was appointed treasurer and executive vice-president. In the early years of cable Meadville Master Antenna was one of the largest systems in the United States. In 1987 MMA merged with Armstrong Communications. Barco became a vice president and director of Armstrong. In the late 1970s the Barcos teamed with Joey Gans in setting up the non-profit Pennsylvania Educational Communications System (PECS). The purpose was to distribute educational material created at Pennsylvania State University to cable operators around Pennsylvania by way of two microwave relay loops. George Barco was president of the corporation, launched in 1979. It distributed \\"Pennarama\\", the first educational cable network in the United States. The eastern loop was completed in 1979, in many cases taking advantage of existing towers, and the western loop in 1982. George Barco died in 1989, and in 1990 Yolanda Barco became president and CEO of PECS. She renamed the corporation the Pennsylvania Cable Network (PCN) and began to reposition it as the state's \\"educational, public affairs and cultural cable TV network.\\" While still carrying educational material from the university, the network now provided much more material on the Pennsylvania state government and its impact on residents of the state. From the early 1950s Barco represented the cable TV industry in several important lawsuits. The Barcos launched a test case for the NCTA in Meadville, where they and one of their subscribers, Gus Pahoulis, sued for recovery of $70.40 paid in 1953 and 1954 for the 8% excise tax on cable subscription fees imposed by the Federal Internal Revenue Service. They argued that local cable TV was not a communications service. They lost this case in the district court. However they appealed the decision, and in March 1957 the Third Circuit Court found that CATV is \\"an aid in reception only\\", and the excise tax did not apply. An estimated $16 million of tax collected was eligible for refund on application by subscribers. Yolanda and George Barco played important roles in obtaining the regulatory rulings that allowed cable companies to use three inches of space on utility poles, an achievement of huge value to the industry. In 1972 Yolanda Barco was a member of the advisory committee on the development of regulatory policy of the Federal Communications Commission, one of the four cable industry representatives. In 1985 the Barcos and other cable pioneers established the National Cable Television Museum at Pennsylvania State University. Barco was a director of the National Cable Television Association (NCTA), and director and president of the Pennsylvania Cable Television Association. She was the first woman to receive the cable industry's Vanguard Award for Leadership. Public service Busts of George and Yolanda Barco in the hall of the Barco Law Building Yolanda Barco served as deputy mayor of Meadville, Pennsylvania, for four years. She was president of the United Fund of Western Crawford County, chair of the legislative committee of the Meadville Chamber of Commerce and director of the Meadville Library. From February 1990 to June 1997 she was a trustee of the University of Pittsburgh. She and her father made many donations to the university's law school, amounting to $11 million in total. Yolanda Barco died at her home in Meadville on May 27, 2000, aged 74. Later that year the PCN headquarters were renamed the \\"PCN Barco Duratz Complex.\\" In June 2003 the University of Pittsburgh law school building was renamed the Barco Law Building in honor of Yolanda and her father. The Oncology Wellness Institute at the Meadville Medical Center was renamed the Yolanda G. Barco Oncology Institute in her honor.

Her grandfather Giuseppe La Puma (1870‚Äì1940), was a Basso buffo opera singer who created the role of Cornelius in the world premiere of Pietro Mascagni‚Äôs opera Isabeau (1911). La Puma also founded the Mascagni Centre of Culture. Giuseppe La Puma's daughter (Masiello's mother), was Giuseppina La Puma, who moved to New York in 1933 with Masiello. La Puma became impresario and changed her name to Josephine La Puma.

According to Anthony Manoly, \\"Madame Masiello was always a stickler for pianists knowing how to \\"flutter\\" the pedal and sing with a beautiful limpid legato produced by a fine balance of legato playing with the fingers in addition to proper pedal usage. She also insisted that all pianists have a fine understanding of the orchestral scores of the opera you were coaching or playing for her that day. If you didn't have access to the score, she would direct you to her closet of full orchestra scores. She would say, \\"What do you see\\"? After you answered what you observed in the orchestral score, she would sternly reply \\"then PLAY IT\\"!!\\".Anthony Manoly, 'Alberta Masiello' 2017 Masiello was also a strict stylist, bandying the vast Zingarelli Italian dictionary to check open and closed vowels, and fighting for clean portamento-free singing.Eytan Pessen, 'Remembering Alberta Masiello', Stuttgart, 1998 As Harvey E. Phillips tells of Masiello's rehearsal with Soprano Christine Weidinger, \\" 'Make sure those releases are clean', said the blond-haired Masiello, her pearl earrings shaking as she suppressed a persistent smoker's cough, \\"and no portamento, God forbid!\\"Harvey E. Phillips, The Carmen Chronicle Stein & Day, NY, 1973, , p.19 Referring to Alberta Masiello's radio broadcasts, the New York Times critic John Rockwell wrote that Masiello's \\"store of knowledge and imperious manner beguiled listeners for more than 30 years\\". According to American Bass Paul Plishka, Masiello \\"was one of the great, great people who influenced generations of singers in her lifetime. I was very upset at the New York Times obituary, which was very brief and gave the impression that she was merely an opera coach. You could have written an entire book about her work, and she deserved front page coverage. She was, a profound inspiration in my career and in so many others.\\"  References  *  External links  * The Alberta Masiello papers in the Music Division of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. * Muni website  * * Category:Juilliard School faculty Category:1916 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Mannes College The New School for Music faculty Category:People from Milan Category:Italian emigrants to the United States Category:Milan Conservatory alumni Category:Juilliard School alumni Category:American mezzo-sopranos Category:Operatic mezzo-sopranos Category:Metropolitan Opera people Category:20th-century American opera singers Category:20th-century women opera singers Category:20th-century American women singers Category:Women music educators ","title":"Alberta Masiello"},{"id":"40040269","text":"West end The Church of Our Lady of Reconciliation is a Roman Catholic church in Eldon Street, Vauxhall, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.

A self-taught photographer, Sanborn learned to photograph wildlife by doing it. He recorded nearly every species that came into the Bronx Zoo during the first three decades of the twentieth century using black and white photography. Career Elwin Roswell Sanborn began his career at the Bronx Zoo in 1899, the same year it opened to the public on 265 acres in the northwestern area of the Bronx. Prior to opening, the Bronx Zoo had its share of uninvited visitors curious about the new park. Sanborn, seeking out animals to sketch, was among them. The Bronx Zoo's first director, William Temple Hornaday, saw and recruited the young artist to help him meet a press deadline for the park's first guidebook for opening day in November 1899. It launched a lifetime career for Sanborn with the organization. Sanborn was among the original staff of Bronx Zoo. His first role with guidebook production led to an array of responsibilities as Hornaday's right-hand man. Sanborn first appeared on the books as a clerk and gatekeeper making fifty dollars a month. He scrupulously monitored Bronx Zoo staff and visitors as they arrived on horse-drawn carriages by way of cobblestone streets. Once in the park, he sold them guidebooks and photographs taken by freelancers that had been hired by Hornaday. It was the director's belief that there was not enough work for a full-time photographer, a notion that was dispelled as the call for creative services increased. With no known formal education beyond the grade school he attended in Bradford, Pennsylvania, chief assistant Sanborn met the challenge. Sanborn's signature on deliveries of freelancers‚Äô negatives read ‚ÄúCurator in Charge of Negatives.‚Äù It was an assumed title, but Sanborn kept it. He went on to establish the Bronx Zoo's first photo department in 1901 and become its official photographer and assistant editor under Hornaday. Sanborn expanded his titles to include official photographer of the New York Aquarium when it became part of the New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation Society) in 1902. Recognizing Sanborn's attention for detail, Hornaday handed over his own title of editor to Sanborn in 1909. Sanborn became editor of The Bulletin of the New York Zoological Society, along with other journals and publications. A slight, energetic man, Sanborn was a perfectionist at his acquired professions and in his dress, and his eccentricities led to legends. According to one, Sanborn kept eighteen complete changes of clothing in his Bronx Zoo darkroom. The gear Sanborn used was larger than most of the wildlife he photographed. Heavy cameras and glass plate negatives moved with him from location to location. Action shots were not the demand; instead, Sanborn sought to produce clear, sharp shots that showed the animals exactly as they appeared and with an attractive background. He established his own style by creating camera setups that captured the likes of monkeys, jaguars, and especially fish. When extra light was needed, he illuminated his subjects by igniting flash powder that flared brightly then covered all in a cloud of gray smoke. It was difficult on any day, but there were no incidents until the winter of 1926-1927. His use of flash powder led to an explosion in his darkroom. It left Sanborn badly burned and unable to work for some time. Based on his diminished output following the accident, it is possible he never fully recovered. Expeditions In addition to his regular duties as official photographer and editor, Sanborn traveled the globe on several New York Zoological Society expeditions to cover conservation efforts. In the early 1900s, massacres of the American bison had brought the iconic species to near extinction. The Bronx Zoo, led by Hornaday and the American Bison Society raised a small herd for reintroduction to their home range. In 1907, Sanborn accompanied H. R. Mitchell, chief clerk for the Bronx Zoo, and the bison during their shipment via railroad from the Bronx to Cache, Oklahoma. He documented the event. In 1928, Sanborn journeyed with Charles H. Townsend, director of the New York Aquarium, to the Galapagos Islands. He photographed the activities as they unfolded. The team brought back 100 giant tortoises to protect the vanishing breed. Contributions and Legacy Sanborn was a distinctive artist in his trades. He gained world recognition as an editor of science publications and as a photographer. His work appeared in numerous publications and prints. Sanborn laid the foundation of the NYZP photo collection with 14,216 negatives of his subjects including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish as well as the park's buildings and scenes, and his expeditions. He retired in 1934 after 35 years of service, still holding the title of official photograph and editor. He was an unpredictable individualist to the end. Around 1914, he refused participation in the Bronx Zoo's newly established pension plan, only to ask for concession to join in later life. At a last turn, he left his estate to the same fund in his final will. Sanborn died at age 78 on December 19, 1947.

It has been developed within the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) by a dedicated ARML 2.0 Standards Working Group. ARML consists of both an XML grammar to describe the location and appearance of virtual objects in the scene, as well as ECMAScript bindings to allow dynamic access to the properties of the virtual objects, as well as event handling, and is currently published in version 2.0. ARML focuses on visual augmented reality (i.e. the camera of an AR-capable device serves as the main output for augmented reality scenarios).  Data model  ARML is built on a generic object model that allows serialization in several languages. Currently, ARML defines an XML serialization, as well as a JSON serialization for the ECMAScript bindings. The ARML object model consists of three main concepts: * Features represent the physical object that should be augmented. * VisualAssets describe the appearance of the virtual object in the augmented scene. * Anchors describe the spatial relation between the physical and the virtual object. = Feature = The definition of a Feature is reused from the Geography Markup Language (GML) and describes the physical object that should be augmented. The physical object is described by a set of metadata, including an ID, a name and a description. A Feature has one or more Anchors. = Anchor = An Anchor describes the location of the physical object in the real world. Four different Anchor types are defined in ARML: # Geometries # Trackables # RelativeTo # ScreenAnchor  Geometries  Geometries describe the location of an object through a set of fixed coordinates. WGS84 (latitude, longitude, altitude) is used as the default coordinate reference system, other arbitrary coordinate reference systems can be supplied if required. ARML allows 0- (Point), 1- (LineString) and 2-dimensional (Polygon) geometries. Geometry Anchors reuse the syntax as defined in GML3. As an example, the following snippet defines the location of the Wiener Riesenrad. 48.216622 16.395901  Trackables  Trackables are patterns that are searched, recognized and tracked in the video screen coming from the camera of the device. A wide variety of different tracking technologies exist, including QR codes, Natural features, 3D and Face Tracking. As all these tracking types use different algorithms and technologies, the definition of a Trackable is abstracted and split into two parts, a Tracker and its associated Trackables. A Tracker describes the technology (or algorithm) with which its associated Trackables should be tracked, using URIs identifying the algorithm. The Trackable itself describes the pattern the algorithm should look for in the video stream. Example: A natural feature tracker and an associated Trackable http://www.example.com/myMarker.jpg 0.20  RelativeTo  RelativeTo Anchors allow the definition of a location relative to other Anchors or the user's position. The former allows the setup of a scene and the location of all included virtual objects based on a single Anchor, like a Trackable placed on a table. The latter allows for scenarios where the actual location of the user is irrelevant. The virtual objects are simply placed around the user, regardless of his or her physical location.  ScreenAnchor  Contrary to the previous three Anchor types, ScreenAnchors do not describe a location in the 3-dimensional virtual scene. Instead, they define an area on the device screen, allowing for status bars and the like. = VisualAsset = VisualAssets describe the appearance of the virtual objects in the augmented scene. ARML allows various kinds of VisualAssets to be described, including plain text, images, HTML content and 3D models. VisualAssets can be oriented (either to always automatically face the user, or to maintain a specific static orientation) and scaled. Additionally, visibility conditions can be applied (i.e. the Asset is only visible on the screen if the distance to the user is within certain boundaries).  History  In late 2009, Wikitude (formerly Mobilizy), the creators of the Wikitude World Browser, started an early initiative on creating a format all AR Browsers at that time could adhere to, called the Augmented Reality Markup Language (ARML). This format is now called ARML 1.0 and serves as an input format for the Wikitude World Browser. In late 2011, Martin Lechner, Wikitude's CTO and the main driver of the ARML initiative, established the Augmented Reality Markup Language 2.0 Standards Working Group (ARML 2.0 SWG) within the OGC. Its goal was to create an internationally accepted standard for Augmented Reality, based on the ideas of ARML 1.0 and similar formats. During ISMAR in Atlanta in November 2012, the first ARML 2.0 specification was officially published, making ARML 2.0 an official OGC Candidate Standard.  Related standards  ARML 2.0 is reusing ideas, structure, syntax and semantics of the following existing and widely used standards:Martin Lechner, The Augmented Reality Markup Language 2.0, Dissertation * HyperText Markup Language, ECMAScript (JavaScript) and Cascading Style Sheets * Geography Markup Language * Keyhole Markup Language * COLLADA * XPath 2.0 In addition, the following, ARML-independent initiatives also deal with creating standards for Augmented Reality environments: * Augmented Reality Application Format (ARAF) developed within ISO/MPEG * KARML developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology * MobAR developed within the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)  Examples  The following example describes a 3D Model (assuming one is available on http://www.example.com/myModel.dae) on a Trackable, like a fiducial marker, located at http://www.example.com/myMarker.jpg: http://www.example.com/myMarker.jpg 0.20  References  Category:Standards Category:Markup languages Category:Augmented reality ","title":"Augmented Reality Markup Language"},{"id":"40040373","text":"The 1919‚Äì20 Swiss National Ice Hockey Championship was the 10th edition of the national ice hockey championship in Switzerland.

It offers collections in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and related sciences. The BIU Sant√© resulted from the merging of two other institutions in 2011: the Biblioth√®que interuniversitaire de m√©decine et d'odontologie (BIUM) and the Biblioth√®que interuniversitaire de pharmacie (BIUP), even though the two sites remain distinct. History =The interuniversity Library of Medicine (BIUM)= The BIUM (\\"Biblioth√®que interuniversitaire de m√©decine\\") used to be the Library of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, which was settled in the Middle Ages at ‚Äúrue de la B√ªcherie‚Äù and then ‚Äúrue Jean-de-Beauvais‚Äù.Andr√© Hahn. La biblioth√®que de la Facult√© de m√©decine de Paris. Paris : Librairie Le Fran√ßois, 1929, p. 31 The Faculty was removed in 1793. But the National Convention established a Medical School in the former Academy of Surgery, in a building constructed by Jacques Gondouin.Ibid., p. 63 Scattered after the closing of the Faculty, the collections were rebuilt by the surgeon and librarian Pierre Sue. They were joined by other holdings from the former Academy of Surgery, the French Royal society of medicine and some of the Capital‚Äôs literary works. During the 19th century and a major part of the 20th century (until the beginning of the 1970s), the library was known as the Library of the Faculty of Medicine in Paris. Its holdings have been increasing since then. =The interuniversity Library of Pharmacy (BIUP)= The history of the collection of the \\"Biblioth√®que interuniversitaire de Pharmacie\\" (BIUP) goes back to 1570, when four masters of the community of apothecaries and grocers donated works to their corporation. The Common Library‚Äôs collection was enhanced by other donations from the guards of the community. Until 1777, when the ‚ÄúColl√®ge de Pharmacie de France‚Äù was created. In 1803, the holdings of work and archives went under the responsibility of the secretary of the School of Pharmacy and some teachers (in particular Nicolas Gaston Guibourt). Librarians weren‚Äôt required by the School of Pharmacy until 1878. Then the post is formalized in February 1882. In the same year, the School and the library moved from the ‚ÄúJardin des apothicaires‚Äù, ‚Äúrue de l‚ÄôArbal√®te‚Äù, to the Faculty of Pharmacy in Paris, ‚Äúavenue de l‚ÄôObservatoire‚Äù. As the establishment‚Äôs librarian between 1884 and 1922, the doctor and historian Paul Dorveaux (1851-1938) left a long- lasting imprint on it thanks to the organization of a policy of conservation and acquisition. This policy concerned current scientific production as well as ancient works and manuscripts. It was under the directions of the doctor and historian Paul Dorveaux (1936-1961) and Yvonne Ruyssen (1961-1973) that the Library experienced new changes: the growing number of staff, the reorganization of the premises and the opening of a new reading room (the Dorveaux room) in 1958.Yvonne Ruyssen. ¬´ La biblioth√®que de la Facult√© de Pharmacie de Paris √† travers le temps ¬ª, Revue d'histoire de la Pharmacie, XXI, no 218, septembre 1973, p. 535 =Since 1972= After the University of Paris‚Äô break-up the two libraries and the Scientific Library were integrated in 1972 the ‚ÄúBiblioth√®que interuniversitaire d‚Äô√éle de France‚Äù granted under decree 72-132 of the 10th of February. By the decree 78-1122 of 16 November 1978, each of these libraries regained their autonomy under the respective names of ‚ÄúBiblioth√®que interuniversitaire de medecine‚Äù(BIUM) and ‚ÄòBiblioth√®que interuniversiaire de pharmacie‚Äù (BIUP).The two entities pertain to the Paris Descartes University. But the Interuniversity Library is a common service for Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University, and Paris Diderot University, while the BIUP is a common service for the University of Paris-Sud. The merging of these two libraries was decided in September 2009 and became effective in 2011. Status and operations The Library is governed by a convention agreed between the Universities of Paris Descartes, Diderot and Paris-Sud. It is administratively attached to Paris-Descartes University. It is run by a librarian, the latest being Guy Cobolet (general curator). The BIU Sant√© is a CADIST (French acronym for center of acquisition and dissemination of scientific and technical information) for medicine, odontology and cosmetology. It is also an associated center of the National Library of France for medicine and pharmacy. As a research library, the BIU Sant√© is especially dedicated to students, researchers and teachers within health disciplines, including psychology. It greets every non-academic health professional and every person who conducts researches matching its collections. The site dedicated to medicine and odontology is established in the old Faculty of M√©decine of Paris, ‚Äúrue de l‚ÄôEcole-de-M√©decine. These premises shelter the presidency of Paris-Descartes University and the History of Medicine Museum. The site dedicated to Pharmacy is part of the old premises of the Faculty of Pharmacy in Paris. A reading room for students (Fialon room) opened in 1991. Readership : 16 000 registered physical users; 130 000 Net surfers consult the library‚Äôs website every month, 60% of them live abroad. Architecture The medical and odontological pole shelters two reading rooms: * The first public space of the library was Louis Landouzy‚Äôs reading room. It currently has the library‚Äôs collections of odontology. * Located alongside the boulevard Saint- Germain, the great hall was inaugurated in 1891. It was built by L√©on Ginain. The architect made a point of honor to see that this hall was six meters longer than Saint-Genevieve Library‚Äôs. In 1908, its floor was raised to allow the building of another storage space. The center of medicine, odontology and cosmetology is currently under construction. It includes two reading rooms: * The Dorveaux room, in the north wing. * The Fialon room, in the south wing. Collections The ¬´ BIU Sant√© ¬ª is a reference library recognized at the international level in medical field. It also owns the total of French dissertations in medicine and dental surgery and keeps one copy of each. The Parisian dissertations collection goes back to 1539. The BIU Sant√© is the depositary of the legal deposits covering works of medicine and dentistry. The whole collection is one of the three richest in the world, with the National Library of Medicine (USA) and the Wellcome Library (London). To gain more room, the BIU Sant√© delivered a part of its collections to the ‚ÄúCentre technique du livre de l‚Äôenseignement sup√©rieur‚Äù (technical book center for higher education), also called CTLes. It mostly concerns dissertations from French provinces or foreign countries and magazines written in non-Latin characters. =Medicine-odontology= * More than 400 000 printed works * Near 16 000 French and foreign periodicals and 2 000 are currently ongoing. * Many electronic resources (electronic documents, databases, online periodicals, websites) =History of health= * 1.118 manuscripts * 3.000 works from the 16th century, 6.700 from the 17th, 16.000 from the 18th and 130.000 from the 19th * Drawings, engravings, photographs and medals =Pharmacy-biology, cosmetology= * More than 88.000 volumes ; * More than 4.000 serial publications (periodicals and collections) * 204 manuscripts =Electronic Library= The website of the BIU Sant√© includes: * A modern section (catalogues, databases, online question-and-answer service available on the website BIUMINFO, remote supply of documents, 15 000 bookmarks, etc.) * And Medic@, a patrimonial electronic library which provides online access to corpus of texts concerning the history of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and health in general, from the 15th to the 20th century. These texts are completed by other documentary products and services (a database containing 85.000 images, virtual exhibitions, a biography and bibliographic database of doctors, electronic publication of thesis and congresses, websites of learned societies).

The company was founded based on the work of plasma physics professor Nikolay Suslov, who developed a technology to apply plasma energy to surgically treat live tissue with minimal thermal damage.  Plasmas in surgery  Cold plasmas are extensively used in industry for critical surface cleaning and have been proposed for multiple applications in Plasma medicine, including sterilization or decontamination processes. Thermal plasmas are characterized as being macroscopically hot and have widespread industrial use in materials cutting, and more recently broad use in surgical procedures. The origins of a thermal plasma with the ability to both cut and coagulate tissue lie in the early studies by the late John Glover and his colleagues at the Indiana University in the mid 1970s. Glover and his team described the first plasma scalpel and compared this to the use of the steel scalpel and electrosurgery. Although effective as a surgical tool, this relatively simple two electrode handpiece device involved a relatively high gas flow and in early pre-clinical and clinical use there was evidence of argon gas in the circulation with the concomitant risk of gas embolism. No subsequent development ensued and no commercially available system arose from this early work. In the mid 1990s, Nikolay Suslov invented a multielectrode system that generated plasma with a higher power density using a very low level of current.Suslov N, Inventor; Plasma Surgical InvestmentsLtd., assignee. Device to stop bleeding in living human and animal tissue. United States Patent No 5,843,079, 1998. This design used a low level DC current to generate a spectrally pure plasma flow in a small electrode group that facilitated the design of small diameter handpieces capable of generating a high power density of plasma flow using a very low argon flow of typically 0.2 - 0.6 l/min. This approach was developed further in 1999‚Äì2008 to create the company's flagship product.  Products  The company's core product is the PlasmaJet system which utilizes an inert gas that is electrically excited to a plasma state, releasing three forms of energy: Light, Kinetic and Thermal. It is used for open and laparoscopic surgical procedures and the cutting, coagulation and removal of soft tissue by vaporization in gynecology, oncology, general surgery, and other areas. and ovarian cysts, and for tumor debulking. The system was selected as the 2008 Innovation of the Year by the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons. The PlasmaJet is currently cleared and available for use in the United States as a neutral plasma surgery system designed for cutting, coagulation and the removal of soft tissue by vaporization in open surgery and laparoscopic surgery. The system also carries a CE mark and is approved and available for use in the European Union as a cutting and coagulation device in open and laparoscopic surgery.  History  In 1994, Professor Nikolay Suslov of Russia described a low voltage DC-excited multiple-electrode plasma surgery handpiece with low gas flow, signalling the possibility for effective clinical applications. Suslov's first US patent for plasma surgery device was published in 1998. Following his findings and patent publication, Suslov and fellow professor Peter Gibson co-founded Plasma Surgical Limited in 2000. The company was headquartered in London, UK and had operations in Gothenburg, Sweden. The company introduced a prototype Neutral Plasma Coagulator at the American College of Surgeons Congress in 2002. In 2010 the company moved its headquarters from Europe to the US, establishing R&D;, manufacturing and commercialization function in Roswell, Georgia, 20 miles north of Atlanta. In 2011, the company began broader commercialization efforts for the PlasmaJet in the US, Europe and Russia, with a total installed base of approximately 100 systems in hospitals and clinics. In 2012 the company received FDA clearance for an expanded indication for use, adding the removal of soft tissue by vaporization.

The park, completed in 1996, is situated on bayou northwest of Lake Monroe (Florida). Description Gemini Springs Park is located immediately northwest of Lake Monroe (Florida) in DeBary, Florida on the DeBary Bayou. The park is situated on of wooded land. 6.5 million gallons of fresh water flow from the park's two flowing springs each day. The park features a fishing pier, a fenced dog park, picnic pavilions, bicycle and hiking trails, a playground, campsites and restrooms. History Cattle rancher Saundra Gray and her husband, Charles Gray, an Orlando attorney, purchased 160 acres of the Gemini Springs Farm in 1969 for $280,000, and later purchased adjacent property. After moving their cattle ranch operation from Osceola County to Gemini Springs Farm, they raised and bred Santa Gertudis cattle. They maintained most of the property in its natural state, only using a portion for cattle. They added an earthen dam near the springs, creating a reservoir at one end of the bayou. =Land acquisition= In 1986, the Grays drew criticism from environmentalists after selling a parcel of the farm along the DeBary bayou to a developer and pursuing plans to dredge the bayou to provide access for boats from a proposed condominium complex. In 1989, they sought permits for a 214-unit subdivision surrounding the springs, again prompting a reaction from environmentalists who urged the county to purchase the property for use as a passive park. Initially, the property was offered to the county for $7 million, $4 million less than the property was privately appraised for, according to Charles Gray. By 1993, the asking price for the property was reduced to $6 million. The Gemini Springs property was jointly purchased in February 1994 for $5.65 million. Volusia County contributed $2.6 to the purchase. Florida Communities Trust contributed $2 million and St. Johns River Water Management District contributed $1.1 million. =Development= After purchasing the Gemini Springs property, Volusia County lacked funding to fully develop the park, but was able to acquire it in the following two years. Beginning in March 1996, $1.1 million in capital improvements were made to the park including building a floating dock for the swimming area, picnic pavilions, a wooden fishing pier and footbridges, a playground, restrooms and other amenities. =Operation= Gemini Springs Park officially opened on October 27, 1996. During the first few years of operation, the park had around 88,250 visitors each year, largely due to a popular swimming area in the reservoir near the spring boil. Just prior to Labor Day in 2000 the swimming area was closed after health department officials detected dangerous levels of enterococci bacteria, a type of bacteria found in the fecal matter of warm-blooded animals. Annual park attendance dropped to 55,348 after the swimming area closed, prompting the Volusia County Council to suspend the $3.50 park admission. The swimming area has not since been re-opened. A fenced dog park was opened in June 2005, at a cost of $35,000. The dog park has a section for large dogs, and a separate section for smaller dogs.

In the 17th-century it was owned by William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle. Early in the next century, it passed to the Rev John Simpson, who commissioned the current building following his acquisition of the estate upon his marriage to the granddaughter of Admiral Benbow. The house was designed by James Paine and built by William Booth. Both men also worked at nearby Chatsworth House. It was later described by Nicholas Pevsner as ‚Äòquite stately'. In about 1850 Simpson's descendant Henry Bridgeman, 5th Earl of Bradford sold the estate to the Hunter family of Greystones. who lived there until at least the late 1930s. The Hall was later occupied by the industrialist Emile Viner, until 1950/1, and was then purchased by Hedley and Ida Abson, becoming a family home.

Due to its common occurrence across Asia and its attractive features as well as ease of harvesting, this species has been introduced widely across Latin America and Africa. It is a sympodial or clumping bamboo that does not show lateral growth and therefore has no invasive properties. This bamboo species of the genus Dendrocalamus grows 15‚Äì20 m tall, and 8‚Äì12 cm in diameter. It is found commonly in India, Sri Lanka, Southwest China and Southeast Asia. and more recently in Latin America and warmer regions in the United States. This timber bamboo has traditionally used as a building material for heavy construction due to the fact that its culms are large diameter and very straight, and its young shoots are consumed as a vegetable. Along with Moso bamboo in China, Dendrocalamus asper is the most popular bamboo species in Asia whose shoots are used as a source of food. Culms of Dendrocalamus asper bamboo are greyish green, becoming dull brown on drying. Lower nodes of young culms are covered with golden brown hairs which are the most easily distinguishing factor of the species. Young shoots are brownish black. Internode length is 25‚Äì60 cm, diameter 3.5‚Äì15 cm. The culm walls are generally very thick but also show great variation in this thickness. The nodes are prominent. The culm sheath is straw-colored and appear large, and broad; the top of the sheath is rounded, and auricles are small. The upper surface is covered with golden brown hairs. The under surface is not hairy. Sheaths fall off early. Mature culms grow very straight with tapering occurring only at the upper level, and the culms show very little branching, making them easier to harvest upon maturity. This species flowers intermittently, with flowering events occurring at time intervals greater than 60 years. The seed is very fragile and seedlings have a high mortality rate requiring considerable care and controlled environments in their first few weeks of growth. Although with a wide natural occurrence and having been introduced at small scale to many countries it has only recently been grown under a commercial setting. EcoPlanet Bamboo became the first entity to grow Dendrocalamus asper from seed with the development of a million plant nursery, the largest of its kind, focused on this species. In 2015 EcoPlanet Bamboo became the first entity globally to grow the species commercially in a Public Private Partnership with the Ghana Forestry Commission.

At its northern end in Camden it will connect with the River Line with which its infrastructure and vehicles will be compatible. At the northern terminus, the Walter Rand Transportation Center, paid transfers will be possible to the PATCO Speedline. The route will generally follow the right of way (ROW) of Conrail's South Jersey/Philadelphia Shared Assets Operations Vineland Secondary freight rail line which continues beyond the light rail terminus in Glassboro. The project is part of a greater plan to expand public transportation in the Delaware Valley metro area. The Glassboro‚ÄìCamden Line will use vehicles similar to the River Line with which converge near the Walter Rand Transportation Center in Camden Background In the early 1990s, NJ Transit (NJT) commissioned a major investment study to look examine mass transit options for the South Jersey region in Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester. A rail connection from Glassboro was proposed in the report released in 1996. In May 2009, New Jersey Governor Jon S. Corzine and the Delaware River Port Authority announced the project. It was expected to cost $1.8 billion and be completed in 2019. Route Located within Camden County and Gloucester County the line would include fourteen stations in Camden, Gloucester City, Westville, Brooklawn, Woodbury, Woodbury Heights, Wenonah, Mantua, Sewell, Pitman, and Glassboro. In a non-binding referendum, Wenonah citizens voted against allowing a station in town. The town council also passed such a resolution. Vineland Secondary right-of-way and freight rail The West Jersey Railroad (WJ) was granted its charter by the state on February 5, 1853, to build a line from Camden to Cape May. The line was built with the backing of the Camden and Amboy Railroad from Camden to Glassboro, with the first 8.2 miles of the line using the abandoned ROW built by the Camden and Woodbury Railroad to Woodbury. In 1896 the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) consolidated all its railroads and several smaller properties in southern New Jersey into the West Jersey and Seashore Railroad (WJ&S;). In 1932, the PRR and Reading Company (RDG) merged their southern New Jersey railroad lines into one company, the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines (PRSL). The line was electrified between 1906‚Äì1949. In 1968 New York Central Railroad was merged into the PRR becoming Penn Central, which was bankrupt by 1970. The last passenger train ran in 1971. The line came under the auspices of Conrail. Following the purchase and division of Conrail it was designated part of the South Jersey/Philadelphia Shared Assets Area. Known as the Vineland Secondary it is owned, operated and maintained by Conrail, the terminal railroad, for the exclusive benefit of CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway. The Vineland Secondary begins at Pavonia Yard in Camden and heads south. It has a spur serving the Port of Camden. It continues another to Millville. Regional rail and bus rapid transit The Glassboro‚ÄìCamden Line is part of a broader plan to expand a regional multimodal transportation network in Delaware Valley metro area including service across the Delaware River to Philadelphia. Other elements of network would include additions and adjustments to PATCO Hi-Speed Line and Atlantic City Line and the development of new system of bus rapid transit in New Jersey. The region is served by NJT buses 400‚Äì499. The bus rapid transit component would be developed along the heavily traveled corridor comprising I-676, Route 42, and Route 55 The southern end of the system would be a newly constructed park and ride in Deptford on Route 55 and an expanded one in Winslow with peak hour buses running at 10‚Äì15 minute intervals. Travelling northwest the two lines would converge to pass through downtown Camden, where transfers would be possible for other components of the network, including at the Walter Rand Transportation Center. They would then continue over the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, equipped with reversible or contra-flow lanes to a point near Philadelphia City Hall. Depending on approval and funding, the BRT system could be completed by 2020. Funding In July 2012, NJT received $2.6 million in federal funding to advance the project. In July 2014 the Federal Transit Administration said it would not proceed with a required environmental study because no owner or operator has been identified. While the Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) is overseeing the $8.1 million environmental study, the agency has not agreed to build or run it. NJT has agreed to fund the $8.1 million study, but has also not committed to building or running it. As of 2016, there was no funding for the project. As New Jersey raised its gas taxes in 2016, the line was targeted to receive funding for construction. an environmental impact report is expected by the end of the year. As of May 2020, the study has not been completed and the study team has shut down its website which had not been updated for several years. Any possible advancement of the project is unlikely to take place until after 2025 according to the vice chairman of DRPA. It is expected that engineering work, if ever approved, would take a minimum of 18 months.

Purging occurs because many deleterious alleles only express all their harmful effect when homozygous, present in two copies. During inbreeding, as related individuals mate, they produce offspring that are more likely to be homozygous. Deleterious alleles appear more often, making individuals less fit genetically, i.e. they pass fewer copies of their genes to future generations. Put another way, natural selection purges the deleterious alleles. Purging reduces both the overall number of recessive deleterious alleles and the decline of mean fitness caused by inbreeding (the inbreeding depression for fitness). The term \\"purge\\" is sometimes used for selection against deleterious alleles in a general way. It would avoid ambiguity to use \\"purifying selection\\" in that general context, and to reserve purging to its more strict meaning defined above.  The mechanism  Deleterious alleles segregating in populations of diploid organisms have a remarkable trend to be, at least, partially recessive. This means that, when they occur in homozygosis (double copies), they reduce fitness by more than twice than when they occur in heterozygosis (single copy). In other words, part of their potential deleterious effect is hidden in heterozygosis but expressed in homozygosis, so that selection is more efficient against them when they occur in homozygosis. Since inbreeding increases the probability of being homozygous, it increases the fraction of the potential deleterious effect that is expressed and, therefore, exposed to selection. This causes some increase in the selective pressure against (partially) recessive deleterious alleles, which is known as purging. Of course, it also causes some reduction in fitness, which is known as inbreeding depression. Purging can reduce the average frequency of deleterious alleles across the genome below the value expected in a non-inbred population. Although this reduction usually does not compensate for all the negative effects of inbreeding, it has several beneficial consequences for fitness. A consequence is the reduction of the so-called inbreeding load. This means that, after purging, further inbreeding is expected to be less harmful. But the most immediate consequence is the reduction of the actual inbreeding depression of fitness: due to purging, mean fitness declines less than would be expected just from inbreeding and, after some initial decline, it can even rebound up to almost its value before inbreeding.  The joint effect of inbreeding and purging on fitness  Accounting for purging when predicting inbreeding depression is important in evolutionary genetics, because the fitness decline caused by inbreeding can be determinant in the evolution of diploidy, sexual reproduction and other main biological features. It is also important in animal breeding and, of course, in conservation genetics, because inbreeding depression may be a relevant factor determining the extinction risk of endangered populations, and because conservation programs can allow some breeding handling in order to control inbreeding. In brief, Due to purging, inbreeding depression is not proportional to the standard measure of inbreeding (Wright's inbreeding coefficient ), since this measure only applies to neutral alleles. Instead, fitness decline is proportional to \\"purged inbreeding\\" , which gives the probability of being homozygous for deleterious alleles due to inbreeding, taking into account how they are being purged. Purging reduces inbreeding depression in two ways: first, it slows its progress; second, it reduces the overall inbreeding depression expected in the long term. The slower the progress of inbreeding, the more efficient is purging. = A more detailed explanation = In the absence of natural selection, mean fitness would be expected to decline exponentially as inbreeding increases, where inbreeding is measured using Wright's inbreeding coefficient (the reason why decline is exponential on instead of linear is just that fitness is usually considered a multiplicative trait). The rate at which fitness declines as increases (the inbreeding depression rate Œ¥) depends on the frequencies and deleterious effects of the alleles present in the population before inbreeding. The above coefficient is the standard measure of inbreeding, and gives the probability that, at any given neutral locus, an individual has inherited two copies of a same gene of a common ancestor (i.e. the probability of being homozygous \\"by descent\\"). In simple conditions, can be easily computed in terms of population size or of genealogical information. is often denoted using lowercase (), but should not be confused with the coancestry coefficient. However, the above prediction for the fitness decline rarely applies, since it was derived assuming no selection, and fitness is precisely the target trait of natural selection. Thus, Wright's inbreeding coefficient for neutral loci does not apply to deleterious alleles, unless inbreeding increases so fast that the change in gene frequency is governed just by random sampling (i.e., by genetic drift). Therefore, the decline of fitness should be predicted using, instead of the standard inbreeding coefficient , a \\"purged inbreeding coefficient\\" () that gives the probability of being homozygous by descent for (partially) recessive deleterious alleles, taking into account how their frequency is reduced by purging. Due to purging, fitness declines at the same rate than in the absence of selection, but as a function of instead of . This purged inbreeding coefficient can also be computed, to a good approximation, using simple expressions in terms of the population size or of the genealogy of individuals (see BOX 1). However this requires some information on the magnitude of the deleterious effects that are hidden in the heterozygous condition but become expressed in homozygosis. The larger this magnitude, denoted purging coefficient d, the more efficient is purging. An interesting property of purging is that, during inbreeding, while increases approaching a final value , can approach a much smaller final value. Hence, it is not just that purging slows the fitness decline, but also that it reduces the overall fitness loss produced by inbreeding in the long term. This is illustrated in BOX 2 for the extreme case of inbreeding depression caused by recessive lethals, which are alleles that cause death before reproduction but only when they occur in homozygosis. Purging is less effective against mildly deleterious alleles than against lethal ones but, in general, the slower is the increase of inbreeding , the smaller becomes the final value of the purged inbreeding coefficient and, therefore, the final reduction in fitness. This implies that, if inbreeding progresses slowly enough, no relevant inbreeding depression is expected in the long term. This results in the fitness of a small population, that has been a small population for a long time, can be the same as a large population with more genetic diversity. In conservation genetics, it would be very useful to ascertain the maximum rate of increase of inbreeding that allows for such efficient purging.  Examples  = Predictive equations when inbreeding is due to small population size = Consider a large non-inbred population with mean fitness . Then, the size of the population reduces to a new smaller value (in fact, the effective population size should be used here), leading to a progressive increase of inbreeding. Then inbreeding depression occurs at a rate , due to (partially) recessive deleterious alleles that were present at low frequencies at different loci. This means that, in the absence of selection, the expected value for mean fitness after generations of inbreeding, would be: W_t = W e^{-\\\\delta F_t} where F_t is the population mean for Wright's inbreeding coefficient after generations of inbreeding. However, since selection operates upon fitness, mean fitness should be predicted taking into account both inbreeding and purging, as W_t = W e^{-\\\\delta g_t} In the above equation, g_t is the average \\"purged inbreeding coefficient\\" after generations of inbreeding. It depends upon the \\"purging coefficient\\" , which represents the deleterious effects that are hidden in heterozygosis but exposed in homozygosis. The average \\"purged inbreeding coefficient\\" can be approximated using the recurrent expression g_t = \\\\left [ \\\\left ( 1 - \\\\frac{1}{2N} \\\\right ) g_{t-1} + \\\\frac{1}{2N} \\\\right ] \\\\left [ 1 - 2dF_{t-1} \\\\right ] There are also predictive equations to be used with genealogical information. = The example of inbreeding depression due to recessive lethals = Average population fitness () against number of generations () of maintenance with population size N=10 when, in the original population, individuals carried on the average one rare recessive lethal. Evolution of expected only from inbreeding (red line) or from inbreeding and purging (blue line). As an example of genetic purging, consider a large population where there are recessive lethal alleles segregating at very low frequency in many loci, so that each individual carries on the average one of these alleles. Although about 63% of the individuals carry at least one of these lethal alleles, almost none carry two copies of the same lethal. Therefore, since lethals are considered completely recessive (i.e., they are harmless in heterozygosis), they cause almost no deaths. Now assume that population size reduces to a small value (say N=10), and remains that small for many generations. As inbreeding increases, the probability of being homozygous for one (or more) of these lethal alleles also increases, causing fitness to decline. However, as those lethals begin to occur in homozygosis, natural selection begins purging them. The figure to the right gives the expected decline of fitness against the number of generations, taking into account just the increase in inbreeding (red line), or both inbreeding and purging (blue line, computed using the purged inbreeding coefficient ). This example shows that purging can be very efficient preventing inbreeding depression. However, for non-lethal deleterious alleles, the efficiency of purging would be smaller, and it can require larger populations to overcome genetic drift. = Genome renewal = The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus have a life cycle that alternates between long periods of asexual reproduction as a diploid, ending in meiosis that is usually immediately followed selfing, with only rare outcrossing. Recessive deleterious mutations accumulate during the diploid expansion phase, and are purged during selfing: this purging has been termed \\"genome renewal\\".  Evidence and problems  When a previously stable population undergoes inbreeding, if nothing else changes, natural selection should consist mainly of purging. The joint consequences of inbreeding and purging on fitness vary depending on many factors: the previous history of the population, the rate of increase of inbreeding, the harshness of the environment or of the competitive conditions, etc. The effects of purging were first noted by Darwin in plants, and have been detected in laboratory experiments and in vertebrate populations undergoing inbreeding in zoos or in the wild, as well as in humans. The detection of purging is often obscured by many factors, but there is consistent evidence that, in agreement with the predictions explained above, slow inbreeding results in more efficient purging, so that a given inbreeding F leads to less threat to population viability if it has been produced more slowly. Nevertheless, in practical situations, the genetic change in fitness also depends on many other factors, besides inbreeding and purging. For example, adaptation to changing environmental conditions often causes relevant genetic changes during inbreeding. Furthermore, if inbreeding is due to a reduction in population size, selection against new deleterious mutations can become less efficient, and this can induce additional fitness decline in the medium-long term. In addition, part of the inbreeding depression could not be due to deleterious alleles, but to an intrinsic advantage of being heterozygous compared to being homozygous for any available allele, which is known as overdominance. Inbreeding depression caused by overdominance cannot be purged, but seems to be a minor cause of overall inbreeding depression, although its actual importance is still a matter of debate. Therefore, predicting the actual evolution of fitness during inbreeding is highly elusive. However, the component of fitness decline expected from inbreeding and purging on deleterious alleles could be predicted using .

Hemry and first published by Ace Books between 2000 and 2002. The books are now being sold with updated cover art http://www.jack- campbell.com/_images_covers/covers_stark/starks_war_2015_300w.jpg highlighting John G. Hemry's nom de plume of Jack Campbell. The series covers the invasion of the Moon by the military forces of Earth in a conqueror's role for the resources of the Moon, as the resources of Earth (or The World, as the citizens of the Moon refer to it) are not sufficient to sustain the American economy. Following a disastrous initial invasion, Sergeant Stark, the titular hero of the series, seizes control of the American military forces on the Moon. Plot summary =Stark's War= After the initial invasion of the Moon succeeds in results in seizure of the Lunar colony, Sergeant Stark is forced to serve under several incompetent commanders. After the commanding General, Meecham, announces a plan to assault the remaining enemy forces that results in wholesale slaughter of the third division, Stark instigates a coup and leads a counterattack to instigate a well-planned rescue mission to retrieve the surviving friendly forces. Despite protests to the contrary, Sgt. Stark's peer non-coms vote him to be their acting Commander, after a bloodless, but risky coup against the remaining officers. After turning down an offer to be promoted to officer status by the wily General, Stark finds himself in command of almost half of the American ground forces in existence, in a heavily fortified position on the Moon, in a de facto rebellion against the US and Earth. =Stark's Command= Following the seizure of the entire officer corps of the American military, Stark forms a tentative agreement with the colony government. After repelling a major US offensive, Stark begins to oversee the administrative aspects of his command, including negotiating with the Earth government, which amounts to little more than a demands for unconditional surrender. Following these failures, special forces operatives attempt to assassinate Stark and colony government. =Stark's Crusade= The novel closes after the final disastrous attack in which Stark teams up with the American reinforcements to defeat the foreign military powers. The stock market takes another massive plunge, and the unrest explodes in outright revolt as the population overthrows the sitting government. Stark and the colony military forces are offered full amnesty and pardon, and immediately roll back a large amount of corporate-written legislation that severely oppressed the colony's population. Major themes A major theme of the novel is the separation of the military and civilian portions of the population, and the further separation between the enlisted and officer corps of the American military. Stark himself is considered an anachronism as he was born a civilian and chose to join the military. With few exceptions, officers are portrayed as either bumbling sycophants, intent on obeying the letter of every law, no matter how asinine, and forcing their subordinates to do the same, or as near- tyrannical overlords, who create plans that are full of doubletalk and invented words and are known to not work but are forced through regardless. The other major force are the corporations that attempt to lay claim to the Moon, through the puppets of the generals and the various political figures they are shown to own through thinly veiled bribes in the form of campaign contributions. The sergeants of the enlisted are almost universally smarter, better trained, and the only force that can bring the officer corps' plans to fruition. In an interview, Hemry stated that Stark \\"came into being as a formed character, as if born of my frustrations with things I had encountered in the service.\\" The second major theme is the presence of the media and corporations in war. Rather than be providers of war material, the corporations portrayed use the war as a medium for entertainment, allowing for real time viewing of combat as part of a paid subscription. Part of the rationale for this is that the economy has reached the point where it can no longer expand, and is technically now a failure, and the major corporations, which are always massive, undefined conglomerates, required the constant media exposure to sustain the bottom line, which is reinforced by the corporations' direct control of various military and political figures. Reception Reception for Stark's War has been positive. References Army Category:Science fiction book series Category:Novel series Category:Novels by John G.

She is currently the mayor of Salem, and is a member of the Democratic Party. Driscoll graduated from Salem State University in 1989, and subsequently served as deputy city manager of Chelsea, Massachusetts for five years. She was elected mayor of Salem in 2005, taking office in January 2006 at City Hall. She was re-elected to the position in 2009 with over 80% of the vote, and won again in 2013 and 2017. Driscoll has considered running for higher office, including the United States Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, or Governor of Massachusetts. As a result of her leadership, Salem became one of 110 cities and towns in the state of Massachusetts designated as Commonwealth \\"Green Communities.\\" This status made the city eligible for municipal renewable power and energy efficiency grants from the state. In 2013, Salem received eight stations where drivers can charge their electric vehicles; four are located at the Museum Place Mall, near the Peabody Essex Museum, and the other four are located inside the South Harbor parking garage across the street from the Salem Waterfront Hotel. Also in 2013, under the leadership of Driscoll, the city moved to a mandatory recycling program for trash pick up in Salem. Driscoll obtained a federal grant to cover 90% of the cost of \\"Nathaniel Bowditch\\", a $2.1 million 92-foot high-speed catamaran that travels from Salem to Boston annually from May to October. The maiden voyage took place on June 22, 2006.

As of 2017, a $1 billion transformation of the Salem waterfront is well underway. The project was originally proposed in 2006, and involved dredging to make the waters deeper for larger boats. In 2016, the city acquired the vacant parcel at 289 Derby Street for redevelopment as gateway park along the waterfront. The Salem Harbor Power Station, an old 1940s coal-powered facility was replaced with a smaller and cleaner natural gas powered plant, occupying one-half of the original footprint, allowing for additional waterfront redevelopment in the future. 40-acres of prime waterfront land is up for sale, the largest deal in the city's modern history.

The name is a paraphrase of the title of the book Facundo: Civilizaci√≥n y Barbarie, published in 1845 by the Argentine statesman and writer Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. Structure =The basic cycle= The basic cycle comprises 18 independent tape pieces, some of them with different versions. Each piece can be performed separately and individually, as well as in open and variable groupings with other pieces of the cycle.

These \\"normal\\" channels have been moulded by our own personal history to react and give answer to a certain \\"system of logics\\" designed to solve the conflict arising between our own inner fantasies, expectations, limitations and desires and the ones which the outer world, society, press on us. This tape-cycle is an experience in trying to break through some of these defences, attempting to voyage some of the forbidden parts of myself, leaving behind \\"sounding traces\\" proof of the existence of other \\"civilizations or barbarisms\\" in me.

This program selection was done in order to try to signal out the mentioned individualities, while at the same time, treating the whole, in the form of a single piece of music, 'silent bridges' between them reflecting its oppositions and coincidences, confronting different processes of listening and listening approaches. For this reason the pieces were selected not only by their own individual qualities, but also by their capacity to behave within a 'chain', i.e. in relation to each other.\\" Same quotation reference as Note Nbr.1.

(Quoted with the permission of the artist) Work history In 1984 Kuczer was invited to perform a first concert with pieces from Civilizaci√≥n o Barbarie at the \\"Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse\\" in Darmstadt. The invitation was made on behalf of Brian Ferneyhough, who had the chance to hear some of the pieces beforehand. In a letter to the organizers he wrote: \\"In my opinion these pieces... are partly of very great interest\\". And later: \\"... I consider him to be a major composer in this area\\".Original German: \\"... Ich halte ihn f√ºr einen bedeutenden Komponisten in diesem Bereich...\\" Taken from a letter from Ferneyhough to the organizers of the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse from 9 May 1984.

Although between 1984 and 1999 several of the works belonging to the Civilizaci√≥n o Barbarie cycle have been performed a number of times either in \\"Group-form\\" and/or also individually as part of mixed concerts in different cities of Europe, a substantial part of the pieces have remained unplayed.The concert in Bremen 1999, which was to be the composers return to concerting after several years, remains as the last performance of pieces of the cycle (August 2013).Note: Masters, copies and materials, which amount to more than 200 tapes, have not yet undergone the process of digitalization (August 2013) Reception The performances of the pieces of Civilizaci√≥n o Barbarie, although generally considered as a \\"secret tip\\",\\"his (i.e. Kuczer's) rare concerts are considered a 'secret hint, in: Weser-Kurier 12 Nov. 1999 have often been surrounded by great controversy and even true scandals: listeners (even full orchestras) running out of the concert hall,\\"...The dynamics and the shock creating chromatic was instead made free.

Per Mortesen, in: Dagens Nyheter, 26 September 1985\\"... the volume drove the orchestra musicians from the stage, the General Musikdirektor (and others) from the hall...\\". M.F. in Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, 6 July 1987 parts of the public being horrified, the pieces being smeared by the most conservative part of the audiences and their music critics. Some reports contain mixed feelings showing that the musicians and critics were somehow under shock, moved, puzzled, perhaps confused, revolted, captivated and outraged at the same time, having to admit, though, that something in a way \\"unforgettable\\" had taken place. The premiere of Civilizaci√≥n o Barbarie in Darmstadt in 1984 was described by Hans-Joachim Hespos as follows: > ... whoever once in his life has stood, with fluttering pant legs, in the > middle of loud blasting sound-waves before loudspeekers, knows what loudness > can bring about. I heard this once in my life, in a performance of a piece > by the Argentinian composer Bernardo Kuczer. An interesting sound-work... > all that has been captured, edited and projected with excessive decibels > through big speakers: such a gross terribleness has remained unforgettable > to me. Other well known musicians and serious music critics have given their opinion. Reinhard Oehlschl√§gel, editor of MusikTexte, called it \\"a highly complex, experimental and political music,\\" and later described it as \\"The sonically most extreme example [of a series of tape compositions by Latin American composers introduced at the Cologne Musikhochschule], as was already the case at the Darmst√§dter Ferienkursen 1986.\\" Citation on p. 58. Monika Lichtenfeld called it \\"a music of bursting wildness and signal setting expressiveness\\" composed of \\"archaic, crude, complexly towered sounds.\\"Monika Lichtenfeld, \\"Aufbruchstimmung in Darmstadt‚Äîeine kursorische Bilanz der Internationalen Ferienkurse f√ºr Neue Musik 1984\\" (A Sense of Optimism in Darmstadt: A Cursory Account of the International Summer Courses for New Music 1984). Hessischer Rundfunk second programme, 29 January 1985 (transcript on deposit in the archive of the Internationales Musikinstitut Darmstadt). The author Antonio Trudu wrote in his comprehensive book about Darmstadt referring to the concert of 1984: > ...the Argentine Bernardo Kuczer, whose immense cycle of electroacoustic > pieces, under the title Civilizaci√≥n o Barbarie, was presented at such a > volume, that induced many of the present to listen from outside the hall, > being this one of the most extraordinary pieces of music that were heard in > Darmstadt this year...Antonio Trudu, La \\"Scuola\\" di Darmstadt: i Ferienkurse > dai 1946 a oggi, Le Sfere 18 (Milan: Ricordi 1992), page 269.

The temple is situated at a distance of about 45 km from Pratapgarh & 145 km from Ayodhya, in Bela Pratapgarh. This magnificent temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, is the center of people's faith & spirituality. It is consider one of the twelve Jyotirlinga find mention in Shiva Puran.  History  According to Shiva Purana, in the southern direction, on a bank of lake lived a Brahmin called Brahmavetta Sudharm along with his wife Sudeha. The couple did not have a child because of which Sudeha was sad. Sudeha prayed and tried all possible remedies but in vain. Frustrated of being childless, Sudeha got her sister Ghushma married to her husband. On the advice of her sister, Ghushma used to make 101 lingas, worship them and discharge them in the nearby lake. With the blessings of Lord Shiva, Ghushma gave birth to a baby boy. Because of this, Ghushma became proud and Sudeha started feeling jealous towards her sister. Out of jealously, one night she killed Ghushma son and threw him in the lake where Ghushma used to discharge the lingas. Next morning, Ghushmas and Sudharm got involved in daily prayers and ablutions. Sudeha too, got up and started performing her daily choirs. Ghushma's daughter-in-law, however, saw stains of blood on her husband's bed and parts of the body drenched in blood. Horrified, she narrated everything to mother-in-law Ghushma who was absorbed in worshipping Shiva. Ghushma did not deter. Even her husband Sudharma did not move an inch. Even when Ghushma saw the bed drenched in blood she did not break down and said he who has given me this child shall protect him and started reciting \\"Shiva- Shiva\\". Later, when she went to discharge the Shivalingas after prayers she saw her son coming. Seeing her son Ghushma was neither happy nor sad. At that time Lord Shiv appeared before her and said ‚Äì I am pleased with your devotion. Your sister had killed your son. Ghushma told Lord to forgive Sudeha and emancipate her. Pleased with her generosity, Lord Shiva asked her another boon. Ghushma said that if he was really happy with her devotion then he should reside here eternally for the benefit of the multitudes in form of a Jyotirling and may you be known by my name. On her request, Lord Shiva manifested himself in the form of a Jyotirling and assumed the name Ghushmeshwar and the lake was named as Sai thereafter.

It was an astrobiology mission developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). It was launched 31 July 1992 by STS-46 - Space Shuttle Atlantis, and put into an orbit at an altitude of 508 km. EURECA was retrieved on 1 July 1993 by STS-57- Space Shuttle Endeavour and returned to Earth for further analysis. Objectives The general goal of the experiment was to study the response of dehydrated and metabolically dormant microorganisms (spores of Bacillus subtilis, cells of Deinococcus radiodurans, conidial spores of Aspergillus species) and cellular constituents (plasmid DNA, proteins, purple membranes, amino acids, urea) to the extremely dehydrating conditions of outer space, in some cases in combination with irradiation by solar UV light. Results The Exobiology Radiation Assembly (ERA) provided information on the exposure of invertebrates, microorganisms and organic molecules to long-term exposure to outer space conditions, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, cosmic radiation and vacuum. Spores of different strains of Bacillus subtilis and the Escherichia coli plasmid pUC19 were exposed to selected conditions of space (space vacuum and/or defined wavebands and intensities of solar ultraviolet radiation). After the approximately 11 months lasting mission, their responses were studied in terms of survival, mutagenesis in the his (B. subtilis) or lac locus (pUC19), induction of DNA strand breaks, efficiency of DNA repair systems, and the role of external protective agents. The data were compared with those of a simultaneously running ground control experiment: *The survival of spores treated with the vacuum of space, however shielded against solar radiation, is substantially increased, if they are exposed in multilayers and/or in the presence of glucose as protective. *All spores in \\"artificial meteorites\\", i.e. embedded in clays or simulated Martian soil, are killed. *Vacuum treatment leads to an increase of mutation frequency in spores, but not in plasmid DNA. *Extraterrestrial solar ultraviolet radiation is mutagenic, induces strand breaks in the DNA and reduces survival substantially. *Action spectroscopy confirms results of previous space experiments of a synergistic action of space vacuum and solar UV radiation with DNA being the critical target. *The decrease in viability of the microorganisms could be correlated with the increase in DNA damage. *The purple membranes, amino acids and urea were not measurably affected by the dehydrating condition of open space, if sheltered from solar radiation. Plasmid DNA, however, suffered a significant amount of strand breaks under these conditions.

(c. 1425 ‚Äì 4 October 1471) was the second son of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Lady Anne Neville, daughter of Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and Lady Joan Beaufort. Henry's elder brother, also named Humphrey, died before their father, and so it was Henry's nephew, also Henry, who became the 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Stafford was the third husband of Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond. The marriage was relatively long and successful and coincided roughly with the minority of Margaret's son, the future Henry VII of England. Both Sir Henry and Lady Margaret were descended from John of Gaunt and were supporters of Henry VI, the head of the House of Lancaster, in the early stages of the Wars of the Roses. However, Stafford later switched his allegiance to the House of York and towards the end of his life contributed to the restoration of Edward IV. Birth and early life The date of Henry's birth is unknown, but since his parents were married some time before 18 October 1424 and he was their second son, it is thought that he was born round about 1425. His youngest brother, John Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, was born on 24 November 1427. The place of Henry's birth is not certain, but the family was closely associated with the town of Stafford, from which it took its name. At the time of Henry's birth his father was 6th Earl of Stafford and had been born in the town, not becoming Duke of Buckingham until 1444. Marriage On 3 January 1458Jones, Michael K.; Underwood, Malcolm G.

Note: This link now appears to be dead, but the text that was on the page which has now gone is preserved here. May 2018. Henry married Margaret Beaufort, who, although still young, was the widow of Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond. This marriage had lasted only about a year and Margaret had given birth to her son, Henry Tudor, after Edmund's death. The wedding of Sir Henry and Lady Margaret is thought to have taken place at Maxstoke Castle, which had been acquired by Henry's father in 1437. She was 14 years old and he was in his early 30s. Since Stafford and Margaret were second cousins, it was necessary to obtain a dispensation for the marriage and this was granted on 6 April 1457. In his will Henry's father settled 400 marks worth of land on the couple, but the main part of their income came from Margaret's estates. It appears from household accounts and personal letters that the marriage was happy. The couple lived for a while at Bourne Castle in Lincolnshire. Wars of the Roses Both Henry and Margaret were great-grandchildren of John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford and early in the Wars of the Roses they both supported the Lancastrian cause. Henry fought on the Lancastrian side at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461. Although in the losing camp, he quickly made his peace with Edward IV, who granted him a pardon on 25 June 1461. Shortly afterwards, Edward purchased Henry Tudor‚Äôs wardship for ¬£1000 and placed him in the household of William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, a staunch Yorkist. In 1466 the King granted Henry and Margaret the former Beaufort manor of Woking in Surrey.Jones & Underwood p.47 This is said to have been in celebration of the marriage of Henry's nephew, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, to Catherine Woodville, sister of the Queen consort. The substantial manor house, known variously as Woking Old Hall and Woking Palace,Woking Palace website.

His brother John, was a regular visitor at Woking ‚Äúto hunt and play cards‚Äù and the staff there included Reginald Bray, who was Henry's Receiver-General. In May 1467 Henry was summoned to attend the Royal Council at Mortlake and in May 1468 Henry and Margaret were in London to hear the King's public announcement of his intention to invade France. On 20 December 1468 Edward IV visited Woking to attend a hunt and afterwards dined with Henry and Margaret at their hunting lodge at Brookwood. On 5 January 1470 Henry's brother John was created Earl of Wiltshire, whereas Henry remained a mere knight. This would indicate that the King was not sure of his loyalty. However, despite his illness (see below), Henry was with Edward IV on 12 March 1470 at the Battle of Losecoat Field, where the rebel forces of Sir Robert Welles were defeated. Robert's father, Richard Welles, who was Margaret's stepbrother, had been summarily executed on the King's orders shortly before the battle and afterwards Henry visited Maxey to give Margaret‚Äôs mother, Lady Welles, the news of her stepson‚Äôs death.Jones & Underwood p.50f In the autumn of 1470, Warwick and Clarence returned to England and King Edward was forced to flee into exile. Henry Stafford was arrested, but was soon released following a petition from his wife. After the Readeption of Henry VI in October, Henry and Margaret, together with Henry Tudor and his uncle, Jasper Tudor, attended an audience with the restored King and dined with the King's chamberlain, Sir Richard Tunstall.Jones & Underwood p.52 In March 1471 Edward IV landed with a small army. The leading Lancastrian commander, the Duke of Somerset, visited Henry and Margaret, his first cousin, at Woking in an attempt to persuade Henry to join the Lancastrian army which was being mustered. Henry was reluctant to commit himself, and adopted delaying tactics. However, on 12 April he made a firm decision to support Edward and to join him, accompanied by his Steward, John Gilpyn, and other retainers. Although ill-prepared, Henry and his men travelled to Barnet, where the Yorkists won a decisive victory on 14 April 1471. The previous day Henry had made a hastily drafted will, in which he referred to Margaret as ‚Äú‚Äù.Jones & Underwood p.54ff Illness Henry is believed to have suffered from the skin disease erysipelas, also known as ‚ÄúSt Anthony‚Äôs Fire‚Äù and thought at the time to be a form of leprosy. In the last few years of his life, he was sometimes so ill that Reginald Bray had to take over his responsibilities.Jones & Underwood p.143 Death Although he had chosen the winning side, Henry was seriously wounded at Barnet and did not return to London with the victorious army. On 17 April Margaret hurried from Woking to London and sent a rider to Barnet for news of her husband. Henry was taken home, but never recovered from his wounds and died in his bed on 4 October 1471. Reginald Bray organized his burial at Pleshey.Jones & Underwood p.56ff In historical fiction and television Henry appears as a character in Philippa Gregory's series of novels The Cousins' War and is played by Michael Maloney in the BBC drama The White Queen, which is based on the novels. Stafford's relationship with Margaret is portrayed in the TV series as heavily strained, with Stafford torn between his obvious concern for his wife's well- being and his exasperation with her fanatical nature, given that he supported the Yorkists despite his wife's loyalty to the Lancastrians.

Originally constructed by the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line Railroad Company (F&PL;). Construction began in late 1871, and continued until July 1872 when the railroad opened that year. It was rebuilt by the Pennsylvania Railroad prior first in 1900-1905 as an open deck riveted iron plate under girder bridge. In 1915, the bridge was surveyed as part of the Interstate Commerce Commission's (\\"ICC\\") effort to establish freight rates for the Parent railroad. In 1927, the Pennsylvania Railroad rebuilt the bridge again using deeper and thicker steel girders, but leaving the masonry piers intact. In 1972, the two 85 foot river spans were washed out by Hurricane Agnes. In 1982, the State of Maryland purchased the bridge as part of the railroad line. In 1995, the State rebuilt the river spans and Pier 3 which is located in the middle of the river crossing was completely reconstructed using concrete to replace the original masonry foundations. In 2015, the State performed minor maintenance on the structure and painted some spans. As of 2016, the bridge is in active rail service, operated by the Walkersville Southern RR. History =Construction= Bollman Iron Bridge The original bridge was a \\"Bollman suspension truss\\". The Monocacy river bridge and viaduct structures were a mixture of wrought iron tension members and cast iron compression members, including other decorative elements, such as Doric styled vertical members and end towers, all cast iron and detailed. In 1872, Bollman's firm, Patapsco Bridge and Iron Works completed the bridge and viaducts with a total length of 326 feet. Pennsylvania Railroad Rebuilds The ICC survey work papers indicate two rebuilds were performed on the Monocacy bridge after the 1872 construction but prior to the 1915 inspection: > The Bollman iron truss bridge of unknown span lengths for the Monocacy > crossing was replaced by the Pennsylvania railroad in 1900 as part of a > major rebuild of the bridge which included the abutments. > In 1900, Pennsylvania replaced the river trusses with a steel under girder, > open deck bridge of four spans. At that time, the abutment and pier masonry > was augmented. Five years later in 1905, the Pennsylvania railroad replaced > the remaining two spans that were erected by Bollman in 1872. > Later in 1927, Pennsylvania rebuilt the entire bridge using steel plate > girders of half-inch thickness and measuring 85 inches in depth. No later rebuild by PRR was made after 1927 and prior to 1982 when the bridge was conveyed to the State of Maryland.. United States Railway Administration (USRA) Rebuild No known USRA rebuild scope has been identified for this bridge. State Railroad Administration (SRA 1995 - ) Subsequent to the conveyance of the railroad from Conrail to the State of Maryland in 1982, State Railroad Administration or (SRA,1978-92), developed a Maryland State Rail Plan. The SRA rebuilt the two 85 foot spans over the river that were damaged by Hurricane Agnes in 1972, as well as Pier 3 which was in the river in 1995. Currently, the Department of Transportation, Maryland Transit Administration (MTA), (2001-) owns and maintains the bridge. In 2015, MTA performed additional maintenance on the spans and painted two of the four spans as well.

In that time, he had formed extensive political partnerships and personal friendships with Jewish fellow students, many of which continue up to the present. The rented apartment where he lived for many years on top of an old building at Rothschild Boulevard in downtown Tel Aviv was a well-known rendezvous for political meetings and also the venue of sometimes boisterous student parties lasting deep into the night. Among numerous other political actions, the first demonstration against the 1982 Lebanon War, held on the war's third day, 7 June 1982, and dispersed by police, was planned at a dramatic meeting held in Barakeh's Tel Aviv apartment. Following the end of his studies, Barakeh returned to his hometown of Shefa-'Amr, a place with considerable importance in the internal politics of Israel's Arab citizens, and took up political activity in the local Maki branch. He was first elected to the Knesset in 1999, and was re-elected in 2003, after which he became Deputy Speaker of the Knesset.

The Union) is an Israeli Arabic-language daily newspaper based in Haifa and established in 1944 during Mandatory Palestine. The newspaper is the oldest Arab media outlet in Israel and is considered the most important, it is owned by Maki, the Israeli Communist Party. It is currently edited by Aida Touma-Suleiman.  History  Emile Habibi, one of the founder of Al-Ittihad, editor of the newspaper from 1944 to 1989, and member of the Knesset The paper was established in 1944 by Emile Toma, Fu'ad Nassar and Emile Habibi.\\"The rocket hit the struggle for peace\\" Haaretz, 8 August 2006. Its first edition was published on 14 May that year. Habibi edited the paper until 1989.Palestinian Writers in Israel Boston Review. The newspaper functioned as an organ for the National Liberation League in Palestine.Yossi Schwartz. (16 June 2003). Arab-Jewish workers' joint struggles prior to the partition of Palestine - Part Two In Defense of Marxism. Retrieved 13 August 2014. From September 1945 onwards it was published in the name of the Arab Workers' Congress.Beinin, Joel. Was the Red Flag Flying There?: Marxist Politics and the Arab-Israeli Conflict in Egypt and Israel, 1948-1965. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990. pp. 42-43. The newspaper was shut down by the British authorities in February 1948, reappearing on 18 October. In July members of the NLL in Haifa contacted the Mapam party, asking them to pressure Israeli authorities to give a license to resume publishing the newspaper.Beinin, Joel. Was the Red Flag Flying There?: Marxist Politics and the Arab-Israeli Conflict in Egypt and Israel, 1948-1965. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990. pp. 48, 50, 52. Al-Ittihad was the only pre-state Arabic-language paper to continue being published after independence. In 1948 it moved into a new building on Al-Hariri Road. In the years after independence when Israeli Arabs were subject to military government, the paper was banned in some areas. It was later banned in the West Bank. In 1953 Al-Ittihad and its Hebrew sister newspaper, Kol HaAm, published a controversial article on the Korean War, which resulted in the Minister of Internal Affairs, Israel Rokach, ordering both papers to close for 15 days. The papers filed a petition to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the suspension had been wrongly issued and should be set aside.Schmidt, Y (2008) Foundations of Civil and Political Rights in Israel and the Occupied Territories GRIN Verlag, p. 126. The ruling utilised the Declaration of Independence in making its judgment on the issue of free speech, the first time the declaration had been used as an instrument for interpretation. While other communist newspapers lost much of their readership after the 1956 war, Al-Ittihad was able to recover, regaining its pre-war readership level by 1961. In 1961, the readership of its Friday edition was twice as large as the readership of Kol HaAm, in spite of the fact that Arabs made up only 11.3% of the country's population, and literacy levels were generally lower in the Arab community. The paper's readership continued to grow gradually for some time.Beinin, Joel. Was the Red Flag Flying There?: Marxist Politics and the Arab-Israeli Conflict in Egypt and Israel, 1948-1965. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990. p. 241. Initially a weekly paper, it was later published biweekly, finally becoming a daily newspaper in 1983. In 1988 the government again ordered it closed for a week, six days before Land Day. Due to financial problems, the newspaper moved to Hadash party headquarters, Beit HaYedidut, in Nazareth, and then returned to Haifa to a building on HaMaronitim Road. In 2006 staff were preparing to return to its Al-Hariri Road location, but the building was hit by a rocket during the 2006 Lebanon War and badly damaged.Haifa: Rocket hits anti-war newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, 7 August 2006. Haaretz reports that the paper lost most of its senior reporters in recent years, and that most of these former employees see it as having discarded its earlier pluralism for the Maki party line.

The Communist Party split along nationalist lines in 1939, and Jabra Nicola refused to join either wing, and, after being imprisoned by the British occupation from 1940‚Äì1942, was recruited to a small Trotskyist movement by Yigael Gluckstein, later better known as Tony Cliff. However, with the collapse of the group in the late 1940s, Jabra Nicola returned to the Palestinian Communist Party. While in the Communist Party he played a leading role on the party's publications, but when, after 1962, a small new left movement, the Matzpen group, revived in what was now Israel, he was to join it for a second and final time.

After his early involvement in the folk music revival in Britain, he came to prominence, singing his own satirical songs, in the BBC's topical TV programme of the early 1960s, That Was The Week That Was. He toured Britain and abroad, singing mainly his own songs and accompanying himself with acoustic guitar. In later years, he has published 17 children's books, the first of which, Rosa's Singing Grandfather, was shortlisted in 1991 for the Carnegie Medal. He continues to write and perform his own songs, and to collaborate with other musicians and performers. Most of his material includes some sort of satirical content or elements of radical politics. Folk years Leon Rosselson was born and brought up in North London, lived in Tufnell Park and attended school in Highgate Road, adjacent to Parliament Hill Fields. His Jewish parents came to England as refugees from the Russian Empire. He joined the London Youth Choir, formed by John Hasted and Eric Winter, which went to a number of World Youth Festivals in the 1950s. At the end of that decade, two Scotsmen, Robin Hall (1936‚Äì1998) and Jimmie Macgregor (b. 1930), came to London and teamed up with Shirley Bland (Jimmie's wife) and Leon Rosselson to form a quartet called The Galliards. Rosselson played 5 string banjo and guitar and did most of the arrangements. Their repertoire consisted of folk songs. They made an EP and two LPs for Decca (Scottish Choice and A-Roving) and one LP for the American label, Monitor. They also made a single for Topic of the Dave Arkin/Earl Robinson song \\"The Ink Is Black\\". The group broke up in 1963. In 1964, Rosselson joined Marian Mackenzie, Ralph Trainer and Martin Carthy (later replaced by Roy Bailey) in a group called The Three City Four. They concentrated on contemporary songs, including some of Rosselson's own, and made two LPs for Decca and for CBS. That Was The Week That Was Britain's satire boom began on 24 November 1962 with the debut of a late-night Saturday television series called That Was The Week That Was, hosted by David Frost. It featured some of Rosselson's early satirical songs. The programme ran until 1963. Folk club singer His song \\"Tim McGuire\\" (who loved to play with fire), written during this period, was the subject of a complaint from the Chairman of Staffordshire Fire Brigades when it was played a number of times on BBC radio. The BBC, however, refused to ban the song, despite the protests, because (they said) the pyromaniac does get caught in the end. An earlier recording, though, the Topic EP Songs for City Squares, was banned (or rather labelled 'for restricted listening only') by the BBC.  With Roy Bailey  Hugga Mugga was released on the Leader label in 1971. Roy Bailey and Rosselson recorded That's Not The Way It's Got To Be in 1975. Two other collaborations followed, Love, Loneliness and Laundry (1977) and If I Knew Who the Enemy Was (1979). Rosselson also scripted two shows for performance with Roy Bailey and Frankie Armstrong: the anti-nuclear No Cause for Alarm and Love Loneliness and Laundry, about personal politics. Billy Bragg took \\"The World Turned Upside Down\\" into the charts in 1985. Dick Gaughan has also covered Rosselson's music (\\"The World Turned Upside Down\\" and \\"Stand Up for Judas\\"). The Dubliners covered Don't Get Married in 1987. Big Red Songs  The original Big Red Songbook, a collection of socialist songs, came out in 1977. Rosselson produced a new collection The New Big Red Songbook in 2003. Spycatcher In 1987, three Law Lords declared that Peter Wright's book 'Spycatcher' could not be published in Britain nor could any of it be quoted in the media. Rosselson set out to break the law. He spent two days reading it, then encapsulated it and quoted from it in a specially written song, Ballad of a Spycatcher which was published in the British weekly New Statesman. A single of it, with backing from Billy Bragg and the Oyster Band, was released and started to get radio play, including by Simon Bates on the BBC pop music channel Radio 1. He appeared to expect a police raid or court order. In the event, nothing happened. In Rosselson's words: \\"So much for subversive intentions.\\" It reached number 7 in the NME indie singles charts. Children's writer Rosselson has published 17 children's books. His first book, Rosa's Singing Grandfather, published by Puffin, was shortlisted in 1991 for the Carnegie Medal. In his most recent novel, Home is a Place Called Nowhere (OUP), Rosselson writes about the experience of being a refugee.

They have released two studio albums to date. Their last album A Long Hereafter / Nothing Beyond has received critical acclaim in Spain and has found a positive reception in other European countries as Austria and United Kingdom. Biography =Early career= Al Berkowitz was founded from blues rock/space rock band The Inhabitants. The Inhabitants consisted of Sim√≥n (guitar and lead vocals), Estrada (bass guitar), Palomares (drums) and Daniel Garabito (guitar and vocals). The band started performing steadily around Madrid in 2005 and became a scarcely known underground act in the city. In June 2006 The Inhabitants crossed their paths with American musician Aldous B. Berkowitz (born 1949) and asked him to join the band. With the addition of Aldous B. Berkowitz (vocals and harmonica), the band renamed Al Berkowitz Band and moved briefly to Berlin, where they recorded an EP, Man in the air, and worked on the songs for their first album Barely Nice. =Barely Nice and Apprenticeship and Attitude= Live performances with Aldous Berkowitz as a frontman eventually became erratic and chaotic and the rest of the band decided he would step aside from it and stay just as a mere advisor and exceptional contributor. Garabito would also leave the band shortly afterwards. However, the band retained the name Al Berkowitz Band and relocated again in Madrid in September 2007. Barely Nice was recorded in Gand√≠a, Spain, in November 2007 but wasn't released until March 2009 by independent Spanish label Producciones Psicotr√≥nicas and the band's own label Temple Records. Barely nice had a short print of 2,000 copies and made a moderate impact in Spanish music scene. The same year, Al Berkowitz Band released a live album, Apprenticeship and Attitude, which featured songs included in Barely Nice and in their forthcoming album A Long Hereafter / Nothing Beyond. Besides, Apprenticehip and Attitude included covers of \\"Light: look at your sun\\", by krautrock champions Ash Ra Tempel, and \\"Movoco Synthaca\\", by Belgian new wavers Nacht Und Nebel (band). =A Long Hereafter / Nothing Beyond= Al Berkowitz live Al Berkowitz Band started working on their second studio effort in July 2010. Around that time, Aldous Berkowitz wasn't collaborating with the band anymore and they dropped the word '\\"Band\\" from their name. A Long hereafter / Nothing beyond' was produced by Al Berkowitz's frontman Ignacio Sim√≥n and its main core was recorded at Paco Loco studio in El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a, Spain in November 2011. \\"The Frenchman and the Rabbitman\\" was the first single from the album and was released in March 2012 along with a videoclip. The band kept working on the album until September 2012 and then signed to Spanish independent label Green Ufos to release the album in 2013. A revised version of A Long Hereafter / Nothing Beyond was reissued in 2015 on their own label Tempel Arts.Al Berkowitz Discography =Albums= *Barely Nice (as Al Berkowitz Band) **Recorded: November‚ÄìDecember 2007 **Released: March 2009 **Label: Producciones Psicotr√≥nicas / Temple Records *A Long Hereafter / Nothing beyond **Released: January 2013 **Reissued: April 2015 **Label: Tempel Arts / Green Ufos =Live albums= *Apprenticeship and Attitude (as Al Berkowitz Band) - Producciones Psicotr√≥nicas (December 2009) *Two Delighful Evenings with Al Berkowitz - Tempel Arts (December 2014) =EPs= *Man in the Air (as Al Berkowitz Band) - Temple Records (October 2006) (limited edition 300 copies) *Football, Women and Knives - Temple Records (April 2009) *A Better Way - Tempel Arts (March 2013) References External links *Spanish National Broadcast *Spanish National Broadcast *Iberoamerica.net *Musica.fnac.es *Amazon.es *Itunes.apple.com *Open.spotify.com *Open.spotify.com *Tecnologia.elpais.com *Spanish National Broadcast *Issuu.com *Issuu.com *Issuu.com *Diariodecadiz.es *Indiefermag.com *Sala- apolo.com *Priceminister.es *Org.icat.cat *Thesirensound.com *Ardemag.com *Crazyminds.es *Rockinspain.es *Antoniamag.com *Thecameraalbum.com *Indienauta.com *Treintayunacanciones.com *Indiephone.com *Monemonkey.com *Are-ezine.com *Festivalsdepop.com *Lizard-crimson.blogpsot.com.es *Crazyminds.es *Ivoox.com *Interview for Spanish Television 2013 *Interview for Spanish Television 2007 *Documentary about Al Berkowitz *Produccionespsicotronicas.com *Produccionespsicotronicas.com *Ivoox.com *Youtube.com *Spoonfed.co.uk *Elcomerico.es *Talibanmusic.blogspot.com.es *Alberkowitzband.bandcamp.com *Issuu.com *Nme.com *Greenufos.es *Vimeo.com *Rtve.es Category:Spanish rock music groups Category:Spanish progressive rock groups Category:Spanish indie rock groups Category:Experimental rock groups Category:Art rock musical groups Category:Space rock musical groups ","title":"Al Berkowitz"},{"id":"40041650","text":"A commuting zone is a geographic area used in population and economic analysis. In addition to the major use of urban areas, it may be used to define rural areas which share a common market.Tolbert, C. and M. Sizer. 1996. \\"U.S. Commuting Zones and Labor Market Areas: A 1990 Update. ERS Staff Paper Number 9614. Economic Research Service, Rural Economy Division, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. According to the Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture: \\"The geographic areas of non-metro America exhibit a great deal of variation in economic and social characteristics. In addition to agricultural areas, non-metro America includes sparsely populated mountainous regions, millions of acres of heavily forested areas, small towns, light manufacturing areas, tiny coastal hamlets, and the suburban fringes of growing metro areas. What we know about this heterogeneity is based largely on data for counties. This means that our understanding of non-metro diversity comes from data on arbitrary political units. Commuting zones (CZ's) and labor market areas (LMA's) were developed because county boundaries are not adequate confines for an area's economy. A local economy and its labor market are bounded not by the nearest county line, but by interrelationships between buyers and sellers of labor. If we are to understand the diversity of non-metro America we need a geographic standard capturing variations in local economic and labor force activities. The central objective of CZ's and LMA's was to develop such a geographic unit that better captures the economic and social diversity of non-metro areas. For 1990, 741 commuting zones were delineated for all U.S. counties and county equivalents. These commuting zones were developed without regard to a minimum population threshold and are intended to be a spatial measure of the local labor market. Where necessary, the commuting zones were aggregated into 394 labor market areas that met the Bureau of the Census criterion of a 100,000 population minimum. This was done to acquire a special 1990 Census Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS-L) that identifies labor market areas in which individuals work. The commuting zones and labor market areas were also classified by the population of the largest city within each of them. In 2000, there were 709 commuting zones delineated for the U.S. using the same methodology as was used in the previous decades. Labor market areas were not estimated for 2000, because many researchers found them to be too large and not as useful as the commuting zones.\\" Notes and references External links and further reading *\\"Labor Market areas for the United States\\" *\\"U.S Commuting Zones and Labor Market Areas: A 1990 Update\\" Category:Demographics ","title":"Commuting zone"},{"id":"40041654","text":"Sarfaryab Rural District () is a rural district (dehestan) in Sarfaryab District, Charam County, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Iran.

Situated on what was possibly a pre-Christian sacred site, the presently visible church was built during the 13th century. Stylistically, its architecture shows a mix of Romanesque and Gothic elements. It still contains some medieval furnishings, including a baptismal font by Sigraf, and murals. The church belongs to the V√§skinde parish in the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden.  History  The present-day church is possibly located on an ancient pre-Christian sacred site. There is a well nearby the church which tradition claims to have been a sacrificial well. More concretely, the area is rich in ancient remains, notably a number of picture stones dating from the 5th century. A first Christian church was probably built in the form of a stave church during the 12th century, of which nothing however remains. Building of the presently visible limestone church probably began in the early 13th century. The present tower, dating from the 1240s, is a remains of this first, Romanesque building. During the middle of the 13th century, a new Gothic apse replaced the previous Romanesque, and likewise a new nave was erected at the end of the century. During this time the profusely rich medieval interior decoration of the church was also successively added. No further greater changes has been made to the exterior of the church since; however, the interior of the church has been affected by additional adornment and also attempts at re-painting the older murals in 1686, ruining the medieval paintings to some extent. Several of the interior details, such as the pulpit and altarpiece, were also added during the Baroque era. Even so, the church remains one of the most well-preserved medieval churches on Gotland. Bro Church today belongs to V√§skinde parish in the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden.  Architecture  Interior, view towards the choir Bro church displays a mix of Romanesque and Gothic architecture and art, with several Baroque details. The tower is a sturdy late Romanesque edifice. The nave is a high, Gothic room with broad vaults which do not rest on any supporting pillars but reach to the walls. The apse is straight, typically for churches on Gotland, instead of semi-circular. Several Romanesque friezes, dating from the earlier church, has been incorporated haphazardly in the Gothic church in the exterior wall. A few considerably older picture stones have also been immured in the church. The church has a richly carved southern portal, with capitals depicting, on one side the childhood of Christ, the Resurrection and Hell, while the other side displays intricately carved foliage. Wall paintings cover much of the interior of the church. The original, medieval paintings display scenes from the Passion of Christ, and Christ in Majesty. These paintings have on several places been painted over during the 17th century with acanthus-motives and other decoration. Bro church still has its original Romanesque baptismal font, a work by the stone sculptor or workshop known as Sigraf (c.1175‚Äì1210). Of the former medieval wooden sculptures, only the triumphal cross dating from the middle of the 12th century remains.

In contemporary security studies, the problems of nuclear warfare, deterrence, proliferation, and so forth are often understood strictly in political, strategic, or military terms. In the study of international organizations and law, however, these problems are also understood in legal terms. Nuclear ethics assumes that the very real possibilities of human extinction, mass human destruction, or mass environmental damage which could result from nuclear warfare are deep ethical or moral problems. Specifically, it assumes that the outcomes of human extinction, mass human destruction, or environmental damage count as moral evils. Another area of inquiry concerns future generations and the burden that nuclear waste and pollution imposes on them. Some scholars have concluded that it is therefore morally wrong to act in ways that produce these outcomes, which means it is morally wrong to engage in nuclear warfare. Trinity shot color Trinity fallout Nuclear ethics is interested in examining policies of nuclear deterrence, nuclear arms control and disarmament, and nuclear energy insofar as they are linked to the cause or prevention of nuclear warfare. Ethical justifications of nuclear deterrence, for example, emphasize its role in preventing great power nuclear war since the end of World War II. Indeed, some scholars claim that nuclear deterrence seems to be the morally rational response to a nuclear-armed world. Moral condemnation of nuclear deterrence, in contrast, emphasizes the seemingly inevitable violations of human and democratic rights which arise. Early ethical issues Worldwide nuclear testing totals, 1945‚Äì1998. US fallout exposure The application of nuclear technology, both as a source of energy and as an instrument of war, has been controversial.Robert Benford.

Murphy The Quarterly Review of Biology, Vol. 52, No. 4 (Dec., 1977), pp. 467‚Äì468.Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press. Even before the first nuclear weapons had been developed, scientists involved with the Manhattan Project were divided over the use of the weapon. The role of the two atomic bombings of the country in Japan's surrender and the U.S.'s ethical justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades. The question of whether nations should have nuclear weapons, or test them, has been continually and nearly universally controversial.Jerry Brown and Rinaldo Brutoco (1997). Profiles in Power: The Anti-nuclear Movement and the Dawn of the Solar Age, Twayne Publishers, pp. 191‚Äì192. The public became concerned about nuclear weapons testing from about 1954, following extensive nuclear testing in the Pacific Ocean. In 1961, at the height of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. In 1963, many countries ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty which prohibited atmospheric nuclear testing. Some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the early 1960s, and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns.Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, p. 52. In the early 1970s, there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in Wyhl, Germany. The project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of Europe and North America. Nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s.Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, pp. 95‚Äì96. Uranium mining and milling United Nuclear Corporation Church Rock Uranium Mill Shiprock, New Mexico uranium mill aerial photo Moab uranium mill tailings pile Between 1949 and 1989, over 4,000 uranium mines in the Four Corner region of the American Southwest produced more than 225,000,000 tons of uranium ore. This activity affected a large number of Native American nations, including the Laguna, Navajo, Zuni, Southern Ute, Ute Mountain, Hopi, Acoma and other Pueblo cultures. Many of these peoples worked in the mines, mills and processing plants in New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado. These workers were not only poorly paid, they were seldom informed of dangers nor were they given appropriate protective gear. The government, mine owners, scientific, and health communities were all well aware of the hazards of working with radioactive materials at this time. Due to the Cold War demand for increasingly destructive and powerful nuclear weapons, these laborers were both exposed to and brought home large amounts of radiation in the form of dust on their clothing and skin. Epidemiologic studies of the families of these workers have shown increased incidents of radiation-induced cancers, miscarriages, cleft palates and other birth defects. The extent of these genetic effects on indigenous populations and the extent of DNA damage remains to be resolved. Uranium mining on the Navajo reservation continues to be a disputed issue as former Navajo mine workers and their families continue to suffer from health problems. Notable nuclear weapons accidents * February 13, 1950: a Convair B-36B crashed in northern British Columbia after jettisoning a Mark IV atomic bomb. This was the first such nuclear weapon loss in history. * May 22, 1957: a 42,000-pound Mark-17 hydrogen bomb accidentally fell from a bomber near Albuquerque, New Mexico. The detonation of the device's conventional explosives destroyed it on impact and formed a crater 25-feet in diameter on land owned by the University of New Mexico. According to a researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council, it was one of the most powerful bombs made to date. * 7 June 1960: the 1960 Fort Dix IM-99 accident destroyed a Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc nuclear missile and shelter and contaminated the BOMARC Missile Accident Site in New Jersey. * 24 January 1961: the 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash occurred near Goldsboro, North Carolina. A B-52 Stratofortress carrying two Mark 39 nuclear bombs broke up in mid-air, dropping its nuclear payload in the process. * 1965 Philippine Sea A-4 crash, where a Skyhawk attack aircraft with a nuclear weapon fell into the sea. The pilot, the aircraft, and the B43 nuclear bomb were never recovered.Broken Arrows at www.atomicarchive.com. Accessed Aug 24, 2007. It was not until the 1980s that the Pentagon revealed the loss of the one-megaton bomb. * January 17, 1966: the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash occurred when a B-52G bomber of the USAF collided with a KC-135 tanker during mid-air refuelling off the coast of Spain. The KC-135 was completely destroyed when its fuel load ignited, killing all four crew members. The B-52G broke apart, killing three of the seven crew members aboard. Of the four Mk28 type hydrogen bombs the B-52G carried, three were found on land near Almer√≠a, Spain. The non-nuclear explosives in two of the weapons detonated upon impact with the ground, resulting in the contamination of a (0.78 square mile) area by radioactive plutonium. The fourth, which fell into the Mediterranean Sea, was recovered intact after a 2¬Ω-month-long search. * January 21, 1968: the 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash involved a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52 bomber. The aircraft was carrying four hydrogen bombs when a cabin fire forced the crew to abandon the aircraft. Six crew members ejected safely, but one who did not have an ejection seat was killed while trying to bail out. The bomber crashed onto sea ice in Greenland, causing the nuclear payload to rupture and disperse, which resulted in widespread radioactive contamination. * September 18‚Äì19, 1980: the Damascus Accident, occurred in Damascus, Arkansas, where a Titan missile equipped with a nuclear warhead exploded. The accident was caused by a maintenance man who dropped a socket from a socket wrench down an 80-foot shaft, puncturing a fuel tank on the rocket. Leaking fuel resulted in a hypergolic fuel explosion, jettisoning the W-53 warhead beyond the launch site. Nuclear fallout Castle Bravo Blast Over 500 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were conducted at various sites around the world from 1945 to 1980. Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when the Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb test at the Pacific Proving Grounds contaminated the crew and catch of the Japanese fishing boat Lucky Dragon. One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later, and the fear of contaminated tuna led to a temporary boycotting of the popular staple in Japan. The incident caused widespread concern around the world, especially regarding the effects of nuclear fallout and atmospheric nuclear testing, and \\"provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in many countries\\".Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti- nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, pp. 54‚Äì55. As public awareness and concern mounted over the possible health hazards associated with exposure to the nuclear fallout, various studies were done to assess the extent of the hazard. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ National Cancer Institute study claims that fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests would lead to perhaps 11,000 excess deaths amongst people alive during atmospheric testing in the United States from all forms of cancer, including leukemia, from 1951 to well into the 21st century. As of March 2009, the U.S. is the only nation that compensates nuclear test victims. Since the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990, more than $1.38 billion in compensation has been approved. The money is going to people who took part in the tests, notably at the Nevada Test Site, and to others exposed to the radiation. Nuclear labor issues VOA Herman ‚Äì April 13, 2011 Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant-04 USRadiumGirls-Argonne Nuclear labor issues exist within the nuclear power industry and the nuclear weapons production sector that impact upon the lives and health of laborers, itinerant workers and their families. This subculture of frequently undocumented workers (e.g., Radium Girls, the Fukushima 50, Liquidators, and Nuclear Samurai) do the dirty, difficult, and potentially dangerous work shunned by regular employees. When they exceed their allowable radiation exposure limit at a specific facility, they often migrate to a different nuclear facility. The industry implicitly accepts this conduct as it can not operate without these practices. Existent labor laws protecting worker‚Äôs health rights are not properly enforced. Records are required to be kept, but frequently they are not. Some personnel were not properly trained resulting in their own exposure to toxic amounts of radiation. At several facilities there are ongoing failures to perform required radiological screenings or to implement corrective actions. Many questions regarding these nuclear worker conditions go unanswered, and with the exception of a few whistleblowers, the vast majority of laborers ‚Äì unseen, underpaid, overworked and exploited, have few incentives to share their stories. The median annual wage for hazardous radioactive materials removal workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is $37,590 in the U.S ‚Äì $18 per hour. A 15-country collaborative cohort study of cancer risks due to exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation, involving 407,391 nuclear industry workers showed significant increase in cancer mortality. The study evaluated 31 types of cancers, primary and secondary. Civil liberties Nuclear power is a potential target for terrorists, such as ISIL, and also increases the chances of nuclear weapons proliferation. Circumventing those problems involves reducing civil liberties, such as freedom of speech and of assembly, and so social scientist Brian Martin says that \\"nuclear power is not a suitable power source for a free society\\".Martin, B. (2015). Nuclear power and civil liberties EnergyScience ‚Äì The Briefing Paper 23 (pp. 1‚Äì6) Australia. Human radiation experiments The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) was formed on January 15, 1994 by President Bill Clinton. Hazel O\\"Leary, the Secretary of Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy called for a policy of \\"new openness\\", initiating the release of over 1.6 million pages of classified documents. These records revealed that since the 1940s, the Atomic Energy Commission was conducting widespread testing on human beings without their consent. Children, pregnant women, as well as male prisoners were injected with or orally consumed radioactive materials.

Facilities and aircraft  Carlisle Municipal Airport covers an area of 640 acres (259 ha) at an elevation of 241 feet (73 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with asphalt surfaces: 9/27 is 4,501 by 75 feet (1,372 x 23 m) and 18/36 is 4,494 by 60 feet (1,370 x 18 m). For the 12-month period ending March 31, 2011, the airport had 48,100 aircraft operations, an average of 131 per day: 99.8% general aviation and 0.2% military. At that time there were 14 aircraft based at this airport: 93% single-engine and 7% multi-engine. History The airport was built by the United States Army Air Forces during 1942/43 as an axillary airfield for Stuttgart Army Airfield, near Stuttgart, Arkansas. It was known simply as Stuttgart Army Airfield Auxiliary #1. The runways in use today were built during that period. It was used to help train medium bomber and transport pilots, who used it for emergencies on it or practiced touch-and-go landings. It was not manned, and at the end of World War II it was simply abandoned and the land turned over to local authorities, like many other small auxiliary airfields.

The most popular of Hussie's works is the webcomic Homestuck, which ran from 2009 to 2016. It tells the story of a group of four kids who play a computer game called Sburb and inadvertently cause the end of the world. A sequel, Homestuck^2: Beyond Canon, was released in late 2019. Homestuck was on the reading list of Nick Mathewson, creator of Tor, and one of Foreign Policy magazine's top 100 global thinkers of 2012. Homestuck was also cited as evidence that the \\"recent rejuvenation of adventure games has legs\\". Homestuck has been compared to Ulysses because of the complex and densely worded storytelling the series often utilizes.

Humanities and Social Sciences Online Reed was assistant professor of Black Studies at the University of Illinois from 1982-1987, and professor of History at Roosevelt University from 1987-2006 as an associate and then full professor. He has published a number of books in his fields.  Personal life  Reed was born to Robert and Josephine Reed in Chicago, Illinois on January 11, 1942. He grew up in Chicago's East Garfield Park neighborhood, where he attended John Marshall Elementary School and graduated from John Marshall High School in 1959. He earned his BA from Roosevelt University in 1963 and his MA from the same institution in 1968.\\"Biography: Christopher R. Reed\\", HistoryMakers, 2009. He received his PhD from Kent State University in 1982, with a thesis \\"A study of Black politics and protest in depression-decade Chicago: 1930-1939\\".WorldCat Notably, Reed's great grandfather served in the 116th Infantry of the United States Colored Troops during the Civil War and participated in the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House in 1865, which marked the end of the war.  Academic career  Historian Christopher R. Reed of Chicago, (who writes under his full family name, Christopher Robert Reed), currently holds the rank of professor emeritus of history at Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois. He previously was awarded a distinguished chair within the history department, serving as Seymour Logan Professor of History and North American Studies between 1998 and 2001. Reed received his B.A. and M.A. in American history from Roosevelt and completed his doctoral studies in American history at Kent State University in 1982. He has published extensively, authoring six books on life in Black Chicago, along with numerous articles and reviews. Recognized popularly as \\"the Dean of Black Chicago History,\\" the most important of Reed's credentials is his connection to the heart and soul of Chicago ‚Äì its people and their history. He is a native Chicagoan who describes himself as attempting to blend a love of place with a holistic, scholarly view of what made Chicago and its citizens think and behave as they have done and presently do, and that is, dynamically. An original resident of the South Side's historic Bronzeville community, he is a permanent resident of the city where he is active in civic, community and political affairs, which include volunteer work at the Du Sable Museum of African American History and within the Black Chicago History Forum (creed@roosevelt.edu). On June 1, 2001, the Roosevelt University Alumni Association honored Reed by naming him the recipient of the St. Clair Drake Award for Outstanding Scholarship. As part of a tribute to the memory and community efforts of the late distinguished social anthropologist, St. Clair Drake, Reed has helped lead the movement to promote Black Chicago history as public history and not just as knowledge suitable for the privileged few. Most recently, Reed co-directed the NEH project, \\"Social Origins of Chicago's New Negro Artists and Intellectuals. 1893-1930,\\" with Richard A. Courage, Distinguished Teaching Professor at Westchester Community College, SUNY. The project produced a website, Black Chicago History (being expanded), and a forthcoming anthology scheduled to being published by the University of Illinois Press. Reed has also taught as a member of the full- time faculties at Northern Illinois University, the University of Illinois at Chicago and in the Chicago City Colleges. Predating his work with the Black Chicago History Forum, a new, multidisciplinary, intergenerational body focusing on African American contributions and achievements in the making of modern Chicago, he has lectured before local and national scholarly conferences, along with speaking before church and community groups as well as to elementary and high school students. Utilizing modern communications, Reed has appeared frequently on radio and television, in PBS film documentaries such as the award-winning Du Sable to Obama and in newspapers, and on the Internet. To inform Chicago citizenry on issues of vital importance, he has appeared in hearings before the Chicago City Council. Likewise, he has served as Historical Coordinator for the 1990 Local Chicago Community Fact Book published under the auspices of the University of Illinois at Chicago. His interest in historical preservation is seen through his over six-year tenure on the City of Chicago's Landmark Commission where he chaired the Program Committee.

She started reading at age 1, began learning college-level calculus and was profiled by a CBS News 48 Hours special on \\"Whiz Kids!\\" at age 7, and at age 13 became the youngest student to complete work for a bachelor's degree from Montana State University in Mathematics.  Early life and education  Promethea was born to Georgia Smith, a Greek-born artist, and has two older siblings, Vanessa and Apollo. Her father, David Li, lives in San Jose, CA. For several months when Promethea was 4, she and her family were homeless and lived in their car in San Francisco. This was when her mother began to teach her advanced mathematics. At age 5, she was enrolled in Stanford University's Education Program for Gifted Youth. After being featured on a national CBS News special \\"Whiz Kids!\\", she was allowed to enroll as a regular student earning credit toward graduation at Montana State University. She audited her first M.S.U. course, calculus, at age 7. At age 13, she completed the course work necessary for a bachelor's degree in Mathematics, and at age 14 she officially graduated with that degree. Paying for college had always been a difficulty for the young student. Due to her young age, she was automatically disqualified for most university scholarships, and couldn't hold a job. A local family had paid for her tuition through the completion of her first degree. After her graduation, she spoke of her desire to continue her education, but due to her family's low income could not afford to continue with her studies. She wrote to Montana politicians, arguing that the state of Montana pledges a taxpayer funded education to other teenagers (throughout what is generally their high school years), but that she was being abandoned. Her alma mater offered to waive her tuition until she turned 16. In 2004, she changed her name, selecting names reflecting her aspirations and the ideals that she admired in ancient Greek history.  Controversy  In 2006, Promethea was awarded a $10,000 scholarship by the PanHellenic Scholarship Foundation. In January 2007, she was invited to speak in Chicago at a banquet to honor the Festival of the Three Hierarchs, a commemoration of the three founders of the Greek Orthodox Church. Her topic was to be the role of the church in education. During her research on the church founders, Promethea became convinced that the Church had committed genocide. In her speech, she demanded a separation of church and state, as well as the end of church control on education. The event was posted to YouTube and seen by Greeks around the world. Promethea received messages from passionate Greeks in America and Greece. Some sent her hate mail, but others commended her courage and sent books and offers of tuition. After her speech, she was invited to visit Greece for five days and was interviewed by Alpha TV. In 2011, she witnessed a shooting involving her mother and a man who was stalking Promethea. The stalker was subsequently shot and killed by sheriff's deputies after pointing a handgun at them. In 2013, a settlement was reached in the subsequent court case.  References  Further reading * .

It was officially named the Bon Ton Ballroom, but was more widely known as the Venice Ballroom, and as of 1942, has been known as the Aragon Ballroom. The hall was large enough to be split into two separate ballrooms with different orchestras. From its inaugural day until 1924, Major Baisden, as he was then billed, led his twelve piece orchestra. The Venice Ballroom engagement included a national broadcast by KFI radio in Los Angeles. In 1924, while engaged at the Venice Ballroom, Baisden became mentally ill. Ben Pollack, who had recently played 11 months in Baisden's orchestra, took over as leader from October 1924 to Fall 1925. ; Illness, hospitalization in Augusta, and death On December 4, 1926, Baisden died.

It is divided in two by the Eau Claire River. The river flows through a rocky gorge to form cascades and waterfalls as it passes over and around weathered boulders, outcrops, and other formations. The depth of the river can vary depending on the time of the year. The park also has areas designated for camping, swimming, hiking, and picnicking. Although the park shares a name with the city of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, that city is over 100 miles away to the west. Also, this park should not be confused with the Wisconsin Dells, an area with its own formations over 100 miles away to the south. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 15, 2016 (#16000429). History In 1923 the Marathon County Park Commission bought 60 acres around the dells of the Eau Claire, establishing its fourth county park. Charles Ramsdell, a landscape architect from Minneapolis, planned the initial development of the park, which included trails, a picnic grove, and a concession stand, keeping in mind the County Park Commission's directive to not \\"replace the natural and picturesque with the artificial and commonplace park development.\\" Through the 20s and early 30s the county cleared brush, built stone steps, and developed a baseball field. The rustic stone highway bridge that carries County K across the river above the gorge was built in 1927. It was designed by G.H. Kirsch of the Wisconsin Highway Commission, a 116.5-foot reinforced concrete, filled spandrel arch bridge. The concrete was faced with a rubble stone veneer to \\"accent its rustic surroundings.\\" W.H. Fischer and Sons of Antigo was the general contractor. In 1937 Ingwal S. Horgen, another landscape architect and by then Marathon County's park superintendent, created the Master Plan for the park, concentrating buildings in one area to preserve the natural features, and laying out trails and paths to highlight those features. He deliberately left large areas in permanent forest. The footbridge was part of his plan, and the Rustic-styled buildings, a style just then becoming common in American parks. Eighty years later, much of Horgen's design is still in place. Civilian Conservation Corps Company 3649th Camp Rib Mountain carried out much of Horgen's design, working with him. That company also worked on Rib Mountain State Park and Eau Pleine County Park. From 1935 to 1942 the CCCs built the foot-bridge, stone steps, the Combination Building, and other structures. They picked the stones for the foot-bridge from the gorge, to match the gorge. The park received designation as a State Natural Area in 1973. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Geography The river in Dells of the Eau Claire County Park runs through a rock gorge with waterfalls and rapids. A portion of the Ice Age Trail passes through the park. Geology Bedrock outcrops along the river have been dated around 1.8 billion years old. Precambrian-age rhyolite schist, formed through metamorphosis, is the type of rock that lies flat and also stands upright at places in the gorge. Geological processes have tilted this rock to near- vertical positions, creating formations of varying heights. The northern edge of the gorge has the highest vertical tilts. The swirling action of sand and gravel in the water current has also produced potholes. Flora The forested areas as well as the river banks and gorge feature a northern mesic forest of hemlock, sugar maple, mountain maple, yellow birch, and Canada yew. Climate With an average annual snowfall of 52 inches in Marathon County, run-off from snowmelt creates higher water levels in the Eau Claire River during the springtime. In summer and fall, water levels in the Eau Claire River tend to be lower, with average rainfall seldom exceeding 4 or 5 inches per month. Recreation Most of the developed recreational areas lie north of the Eau Claire River within the park's boundaries. North of the river and west of a county highway that runs through the park are over 25 campsites (16 with electricity) and a swimming beach above a dam approximately a half-mile from the river gorge. North of the river and east of the highway are a group campground, three shelters, and a playground area. There are a number of nature trails that wind north and south of the river throughout the park. Danger and tragedy A sign along the gorge warns park visitors: ‚ÄúDanger. Use only developed beach. Rocks ‚Äì Undercurrent deadly.‚Äù Between 1977 and 1995, four deaths were attributed to mishaps among the rocks and water of the gorge.

The story is classed as Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 285D, and its theme is that a broken friendship cannot be mended.Ashliman site While this fable does admit the possibility of a mutually beneficial relationship between man and snake, the similarly titled The Farmer and the Viper denies it. Versions of the fable The oldest Greek versions of the fable are numbered 51 in the Perry Index.Aesopica site A snake dwells in a hole at the farmer's threshold and is tolerated until his son accidentally steps on it and is bitten and killed. The enraged father then chases the snake with an axe and cuts off its tail. When he later attempts to make his peace with the snake, it refuses on the grounds that neither of them will ever forget their mutual injuries. Substantially the same story appears in the Neo-Latin poems by Hieronymus OsiusFable 26 and Pantaleon Candidus.Fable 21 However, an alternative version of the story is found in Mediaeval European sources that is separately numbered 573 in the Perry Index.Aesopica site Here the snake feeds on food left by the man, or the left-overs from his table; it brings luck to the man, and as a consequence the man grows rich. Eventually he decides to kill the snake before it withdraw its favours, but the snake survives the attack and kills the man's son in revenge. The man then sues for peace but the snake replies that neither can forgive the other while evidences of former grievances remain. In Marie de France's verse account at the close of the 12th century, the snake asks the farmer for a daily ration of milk and promises him enrichment. He is later persuaded by his wife to kill it and waits by its hole with an axe but only cleaves the stone at its entrance. The snake kills the man's sheep in revenge and when he asks for pardon tells him that he can no longer be trusted. The scar in the rock will always be a reminder of his bad faith. The moral on which Marie ends is never to take a woman's advice.Die Fabeln der Marie de France, Halle 1898, Fable 72, pp.236-43 The broad outlines remain the same in the story that appears in the Gesta Romanorum a century later. A knight in debt makes a bargain with a serpent and is similarly enriched. When he is persuaded to treachery by his wife, the serpent kills his child and he is reduced to poverty. It is interpreted there as an allegory of sin and false repentance.University of Michigan These latter versions may have been influenced by the similar story that was also added to the Indian Panchatantra at the end of the 12th century. A farmer sees a snake emerge from a mound in his field and brings it food as an offering. In return it leaves a gold coin in the bowl. In a development reminiscent of the Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs, the man's son believes he will find a treasure horde in the snake's mound and tries to kill it, but loses his life instead. When the man comes to apologise, the snake rejects his peace making and declares that he is only motivated by greed.Indian Fairy Stories, edited by Joseph Jacobs, London 1892, pp.112-14 Joseph Jacobs has argued that the Indian source is the original and influenced all other versions, including those of antiquity, on the grounds that it is more comprehensive and explains points that are obscure in them.Indian Fairy Stories, pp.246-7 Later research has shown that there is no Sanskrit version of the story earlier than 1199 CE, when it first appears in Purnabhadra's recension (III/6). On this account and others, therefore, Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados proposes that, on the contrary, the Indian version has been influenced by the Greek.History of the Graeco- Latin Fable vol.2, Leiden NL 2000, pp.107-09 He has, however, to theorise that some less fragmentary original, as yet undiscovered, underlies all the others and he does not explain how these variations came about.

The next year, Brantz led a group of other German immigrants to Nash's Station (today's Nashville, Tennessee) via Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where they commissioned riverboats and then sailed them down the Ohio River and up the Cumberland River to their destination.

Barco (11 April 1907 ‚Äì 15 November 1989) was an American lawyer and cable television (CATV) executive who played a key role in development of the cable industry. Early years George Barco was born on 11 April 1907, the son of Italian immigrants. He attended Meadville High School, and before graduating had married Emmaline DeLorenzo and become a father. Emmaline's parents were also Italian, and she had seven siblings. Their first daughter, Yolanda, was born on 13 March 1926 and their second daughter, Helene, was born in 1928. George Barco graduated from Meadville High School in 1926, then attended Allegheny College in Meadville, graduating in 1930 with a Bachelor of Science degree. He then enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh to study law, and joined the Bar in 1934. Career George Barco founded Barco and Barco, a legal firm, in Meadville in 1934. Both his daughters would later join him in this business. He became Assistant District Attorney and then Deputy Attorney General in Pennsylvania, before entering private law practice. For fifteen years he was solicitor for the Meadville Area School District. George Barco became interested in television. In 1953 he established Meadville Master Antenna (MMA), a cable TV system, with help from Milton Shapp of Jerrold Electronics. He was the first to use aluminum sheath cables, which greatly reduced interference with the signal. As a result, MMA could deliver 12 channels, a huge number at the time. In the early years of cable Meadville Master Antenna was one of the largest systems in the United States. In 1987 MMA merged with Armstrong Communications. George Barco was one of the founders of the National Community Television Association (NCTA), now the National Cable and Telecommunications Association. He was National Chairman and Vice Chairman of the NCTA, a long-time member of the NCTA board and chairman of various NCTA committees. From 1956 to 1980 Barco was the general legal counsel to the Pennsylvania Community Television Association, now the Broadband Cable Association of Pennsylvania. From 1959 to 1962 he was a member of the first Board of Governors of the Pennsylvania Bar Association. When the Pennsylvania Bar Institute was established in 1965, he became president. To avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, since he was legal counsel to various cable operators, Barco refrained from expanding MMA. George Barco started to explore the idea of distributing educational programs before 1972. He proposed different channels aimed at young children, high school youth and adults, with the programming supplied by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. There were delays and difficulties, but in the late 1970s the Barcos teamed with Joey Gans in setting up the non-profit Pennsylvania Educational Communications System (PECS). The purpose was to distribute educational material created at Pennsylvania State University to cable operators around Pennsylvania by way of two microwave relay loops. George Barco was president of the corporation, launched in 1979. It distributed \\"Pennarama\\", the first educational cable network in the United States. Barco's son-in-law, James J. Duratz, husband of Helene, worked with Joseph S. Gans III to build the network. This involved constructing 22 new microwave towers, as well as linking in 10 existing towers in the eastern loop. The job was done quickly and at very low cost. The eastern loop was operational in 1979 and the western loop in 1982. George Barco died in November 1989. Emmaline died in January 1999. According to H.F. Lenfest, founder of the CATV network Lenfest Communications, \\"George was an imposing figure. Very tall, very dynamic, very strong-willed ... George looked very stern - a very commanding presence.\\" Achievements Busts of George and Yolanda Barco in the hall of the Barco Law Building From the early 1950s George and Yolanda Barco, who had also become a lawyer and worked closely with her father, represented the cable TV industry in several important lawsuits. The Barcos launched a test case for the NCTA in Meadville, where they and one of their subscribers, Gus Pahoulis, sued for recovery of $70.40 paid in 1953 and 1954 for the 8% excise tax on cable subscription fees imposed by the Federal Internal Revenue Service. They argued that local cable TV was not a communications service. They lost this case in the district court. However they appealed the decision, and in March 1957 the Third Circuit Court found that CATV is \\"an aid in reception only\\", and the excise tax did not apply. An estimated $16 million of tax collected was eligible for refund on application by subscribers. George and Yolanda Barco played important roles in obtaining the regulatory rulings that allowed cable companies to use three inches of space on utility poles in exchange for reasonable fees, an achievement of huge value to the industry. The NCTA fought and lost two lawsuits over whether they needed to pay copyright fees when they retransmitted TV programming. In 1962 George Barco argued that since a CATV company simply received broadcast programming and shared it with subscribers, it was not a transmitter. The Supreme Court heard the case and agreed with Barco. George Barco's will established the Emmaline D. Barco Beautification Fund Trust, which has funded the planting of hundreds of trees in Meadville as well as plantings of bushes, maintenance of city flower beds and other work. The Barco-Duratz Foundation funds educational and literacy programs in the state of Pennsylvania. George and Yolanda Barco made many donations to the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, amounting to $11 million in total. In June 2003 the University of Pittsburgh law school building was renamed the Barco Law Building in their honor.

The bill would \\"extend through FY2017 the authorization of appropriations for volunteer services for programs conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), community partnership projects for national wildlife refuges, and refuge education programs.\\" The bill would authorize the appropriation of $6 million between 2015-2017. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. H.R. 1300 would amend the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to extend through FY2017 the authorization of appropriations for volunteer services for programs conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), community partnership projects for national wildlife refuges, and refuge education programs. Congressional Budget office report H.R. 1300 would authorize the appropriation of $6 million over the 2015-2017 period for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to carry out volunteer programs and community partnerships at national wildlife refuges. Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would cost $6 million over the 2015-2017 period. Enacting H.R. 1300 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. Procedural history H.R. 1300 was introduced into the House on March 20, 2013 by Rep. Jon Runyan (R-NJ). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs. Subcommittee hearings were held on April 25, 2013. The bill was reported (amended) on June 17, 2013 alongside House Report 113-112.

Individuals who considered themselves nympholepts would display a great religious devotion to the nymphs. An example is Archedemos of Thera, who built the sanctuary of the nymphs in the Vari Cave northeast of Attica, Greece. Etymology Nympholepsy, a term first used in 1775 by Richard Chandler in Travels in Greece, is described as ‚Äúfrenzy or rapture [that was] supposed to take hold of a man upon gazing on a nymph‚Äù. It originates from the Greek word nymphe, meaning ‚Äúbride‚Äù, ‚Äúbeautiful young woman‚Äù, then ‚Äúsemi-divine being in the form of a beautiful maiden‚Äù, and epilepsy, from the Greek word epilepsis, meaning ‚Äúa seizure‚Äù. Though the root of nympholepsy implies a fit or seizure, according to Socrates, as presented in the writings of Plato, a person could experience nympholepsy without any ‚Äútearing of clothes, the biting of lips, or convulsions, or frenzies‚Äù. Plato implies in his writings that nympholepsy showed itself in others by ‚Äúheightened awareness and eloquence‚Äù. Ancient Greece also had the word nymphleptos, meaning ‚Äúcaught by nymphs‚Äù. Nymphs Relief sculpture of nymph Basile and Echelos Nymphs were known as female spirits of the natural world, and were minor goddesses of various aspects in nature ‚Äì forests, rivers, springs, meadows, mountains and seas. They were often depicted as beautiful young women with attributes symbolizing whatever natural formation they ruled over. Nymphs are most often described as either the daughters of Zeus, the river Oceanus, or Gaia, though various other gods and goddesses have been attributed to their parentage over the years. Many gods are also described as having various nymph companions; for example, Artemis is known for her band of huntress nymphs, Poseidon is often accompanied by sea nymphs called Nereides, and nymph handmaidens were common companions to the goddesses of Olympos. Some elder nymphs, such as those of the Okeanides and Nereides class, were known as immortal goddesses, but most nymphs had a finite, though very long, lifespan. Archedemos and the Vari Cave The steps in the Vari Cave, featuring a relief that depicts Archedemos The Vari Cave is also known as the Nympholyptos Cave, and lies northeast of Vari in Attica, Greece. Along with being a shrine to the nymphs, the Vari Cave is also a shrine devoted to the gods Pan and Apollo. It is also known as the Cave of Pan, and is unique for the reliefs cut into the rock by nympholept Archedemos. Archedemos was a native of Thera, an island which is now known as modern-day Santorini and is located 318 kilometers from the Vari Cave. According to Richard Chandler's writings in his account in Travels in Greece, Archedemos moved from his native town and settled in Attica, Greece, which was 35.5 kilometers from the Cave of Vari where he would later create his shrine to the nymphs, Apollo, and Pan. Though it is a shrine devoted to Apollo and Pan as well, Archedemos created the cave ‚Äúfor the nymphs, by whom he was possessed‚Äù. By the writings of Archedemos in the cave, it is presumed that the Vari Cave was furnished with a dwelling and a garden for the nymphs, as well as a well of water. Richard Chandler, an English antiquary, was the first scientist to report his findings of the Vari Cave in 1765, but the cave was not excavated until 1901 by Charles Heald Weller. In popular culture In modern culture, nympholepsy is also defined as \\"passion aroused in men by beautiful young girls\\", and \\"wild frenzy caused by desire for an unattainable ideal\\". The most famous example is in Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, where the main character Humbert Humbert has an obsession with prepubescent girls he refers to as nymphets and self-describes as a nympholept. The obsession with young girls is explained with the loss of his first love when she was a young age, referring back to the definition of an unattainable ideal.

It is native to Swabia, which comprises great parts of Wurttemberg and the Bavarian part of Swabia, as well as the Allg√§u which has parts lying in Austria. Of very essential importance are egg noodle products in many variations, e.g. Sp√§tzle or Maultaschen. Also typical are substantial soups and stews. History As the conditions for cattle with meagre and stony soils weren't really good, the people on the Schw√§bische Alb did not breed many and meat was a luxury good. Meat was mainly consumed by lords and rich people while the ordinary people had to be content with tripe and simple flour dishes. Depending on the natural conditions like those the versatility of dishes differs: in Oberschwaben the soils are more fruitful and therefore cattle could be bred so the recipes incorporate more milk, cream and cheese. Another influence on the cuisine of Swabia had the manorial and confessional developments in the region: Old-Wurttemberg was pietistic and the cuisine is rather meagre as the nutritional aspect of the diet was paramount. In the catholic parts of Swabia, mainly influenced by Austria the cuisine is more epicurean and features a lot more opulent flour dishes. In the Plains of Hohenlohe fish, especially carp is a local favourite and the cuisines of the former Empire cities Ulm, Augsburg, Ravensburg and Biberach are very diverse and the regular contacts to Italy and France is perceptible. In the mid 17th century the potato was introduced, soon gained popularity and was integrated in the local cuisine. Many new recipes were developed such as Schupfnudeln, potato salad and home fries. What is nowadays considered the traditional Swabian cuisine is mainly based on the simple, hearty and uncomplicated \\"poor- people-dishes\\" (or peasant dishes) from those days. Noodles and dumplings Thinking of Swabian cuisine the first thing that comes in one's mind are Maultaschen and Sp√§tzle. Fresh noodle products in a wide range of variations are processed to main dishes or served as side dishes and they would be missed as much as a sauce, broth or butter. =Maultaschen= One of the best-known Swabian specialities is Maultaschen, rolled or folded pasta bags with a hearty filling of meat, spinach, onion and soaked stale bread. In the last few years they became an export hit and are now eaten throughout the world, even in Russia and the United States. Their nickname is Herrgottsbschei√üerle, which means little God-cheaters, because as legend says they were first prepared by monks who wanted to evade the Lenten meat prohibition, and the monks thought that God couldn't see the meat inside the pasta. Whether as an add-in to a hearty beef broth, or fused with roasted onions or fried in slices, there are many ways to prepare the pasta. Moreover, different fillings contribute to the diversity of Maultaschen, and because of the composition of different ingredients, they are a very valuable source of nutrition. Although they are eaten throughout the year, it is traditional to eat them on Good Friday. =Sp√§tzle and Kn√∂pfle= Another very famous specialty that gained supra- regional and even supranational popularity is Sp√§tzle, which is to the Swabians the same as the potato is to North Germans: a universal side dish to meat dishes with sauces but also the main ingredient in stand-alone dishes. Used as an accompaniment to meat dishes they are commonly garnished with roasted onions and breadcrumbs which were browned in butter. One of the dishes featuring Sp√§tzle as a main ingredient is K√§ssp√§tzle which is Sp√§tzle that are cooked in salted water and then layered into a casserole with different kinds of cheese (commonly Emmentaler and Gruy√®re or even Wei√ülacker) and roasted onions. The kind of cheese used depends on the region of Swabia as this dish is not only famous in Germany but also in neighbouring Switzerland and Austria). As with many noodle products, Sp√§tzle can also be featured in sweet dishes combined with sugar, apple sauce or other fruit preserves, but they are more famous in hearty dishes and this form of preparation is not too common. Also originally Swabian is Linsen mit Sp√§tzle, a dish featuring lentils cooked in a vinegar broth and Sp√§tzle. They are commonly served with Vienna sausages or smoked bacon. The original preparation of Sp√§tzle is very peculiar and not easy. Traditionally, a viscous dough is scraped in thin bands from the \\"Sp√§tzlesbrett\\" (a simple wooden board), but nowadays there are special \\"Sp√§tzlepresse\\" available which are similar to potato ricers. Shorter Sp√§tzle and the thick, round Kn√∂pfle are prepared with a Sp√§tzlehobel which is a board with little holes. The dough, which is not as thick as in the original form of preparation, is spread over the board in a way that makes little dough \\"drops\\" fall into the boiling water. Sp√§tzle and Kn√∂pfle can be served directly after cooking but usually they are briefly turned in liquid butter before serving. The dough contains nothing but flour, egg and water although occasionally ingredients such as spinach or tomato puree are used for colouring. =Schupfnudeln= Flippantly also called ‚ÄûBuabaspitzla‚Äú, Schupfnudeln are another particularity of the cuisine of Upper-Swabia and the Allg√§u. They are made out of a dough which contains equal parts of flour and potato and their shape is oblong and tapering. After being formed which is usually done by taking little dough pieces and form round strips which are then cooked in saltwater. A traditional combination is to mix them with Sauerkraut and bacon and fry the whole mixture in a pan. This is called \\"Krautschupfnudeln\\" (lit. meaning cabbage Schupfnudeln) and is particularly famous on wine feasts, carnival, and Kermesse. But they may also be served with sweet accompaniments. Either pan-fried or only cooked they are commonly eaten with melted butter, cinnamon sugar, apple sauce or fruit preserves. =Pancakes= Pancakes are also called ‚ÄûFl√§dle‚Äú and are usually very thin and fried in oil. Besides being eaten as a whole with hearty or sweet accompaniments they are often cut in stripes and used as add-in (see Fl√§dle) in soups. Another variation which is very similar to the Austrian Kaiserschmarrn is called ‚ÄûKratzete‚Äú. Unlike in Austria they are not only eaten as a sweet dish but are also a traditional accompaniment to asparagus. Soups and stews There are also some substantial soups and stews that are essential parts of Swabian food culture. The fact that soups and stews are loved by Swabians lead to the nickname Subbaschw√¥b which means \\"Soup Swabian\\". In gastronomy they are usually served as an appetizer but in home-cooking they are also famous as a main dish served with bread =Gaisburger Marsch= The most popular Swabian stew is Gaisburger Marsch, a nourishing stew with diced ox meat, cooked potatoes and Sp√§tzle. The certain something is the garnish consisting of fried onions topping the soup. Legend says that the stew was first served to hungry soldiers in Gaisburg in the 19th century and became so popular that soldiers stationed more distantly marched all the way to Gaisburg to enjoy it. Thus, the name \\"Gaisburger Marsch\\" means \\"March to Gaisburg\\". =Fl√§dle soup= Thin pancakes are cut into slices and are used as an add-in in a clear broth. As they get soaked very quickly, they are added just before serving. Meat and fish specialities Although, due to the fact that the region was not always one of prosperity, not much meat was used in the kitchen there are still some regional specialties with meat, e.g. lamb roast with Sp√§tzle or the fried onion roast. Many recipes use tripe which was inexpensive and therefore affordable for the common and poor people. Very well known (although not loved by everyone) are Saure Kutteln which is tripe cut into slices, steamed in roux and then acidified with vinegar or wine. Other famous dishes using tripe are \\"Saure Nieren\\" (lit. sour kidneys) and \\"Saure Leber\\" (sour liver), both prepared by cutting the innard in slices, pan-fry them and cook them in a sauce before serving them with either Sp√§tzle or home fries and a green salad. Popular is also the Swabian Wurstsalat which is a mixture of different kinds of Wurst that are sliced, mixed together with onion, pickles and chive and dressed with an oil-vinegar-vinaigrette and eaten with bread. Fish dishes are often made with Bodenseefelchen which are caught in the Lake Constance. The bright and consistent flesh is often pan-fried in butter, but can also be served steamed or smoked. Miscellaneous dishes Filderkraut is a special kind of Sauerkraut which is not prepared from ordinary white cabbage but from pointed cabbage which is grown on the Fildern Plains near Stuttgart. Swabian potato salad with Maultaschen The Swabian potato salad is also very famous in Germany and even in other countries. In contrast to the mayonnaise-dressed potato salad in Northern Germany, it is lighter and contains less fat. Waxy potatoes are cooked and peeled when they are still hot. Then they are sliced and mixed with diced onions before they are poured over with warm broth, vinegar and oil (great emphasis is laid on the fact that the liquid components are not mixed before being poured over the potatoes although the chronological order may vary from recipe to recipe). Optionally they can be garnished with chive, diced pickles or spiced with mustard. The salad should rest for a few hours or even overnight before serving and can then be enjoyed as accompaniment for different dishes or solely with bread. Of course there are many recipe variations differing in tiny details: the choice of the potato breed, the temperature for peeling, the thickness of the slices and the way of slicing, the amount and addition order of the liquid component, the amount and kind of spices. Naturally most Swabians are convinced that the potato salad of their mother is the very best and only true one. Brenntar was a Swabian staple foodstuff, particularly prominent in the Swabian Jura and in the Allg√§u. It is made of a specially roasted flour called Musmehl. Sweet dishes Ofenschlupfer (lit. meaning oven slipper) is a kind of bread pudding which consist of stale white bread spiced with sugar, vanilla and cinnamon, which is layered in a casserole dish with apple, raisins and almond biscuits and then soaked in a cream-egg-mixture before being baked in the oven. Kirschenplotzer is very similar: stale white buns are worked into a dough with butter, egg, milk and sugar, under which cherries are folded before the casserole is baked and then served hot. Pfitzauf is also a dish prepared in the oven: a kind of souffl√© prepared in special Pfitzauf-moulds and commonly served with apple sauce or vanilla sauce although there are also salty recipe variations with cheese or bacon. Nun's puffs are small round doughnuts made of a yeast dough or choux pastry dough and fried. They are traditionally eaten during carnival and may be a main dish or a dessert served with confectioner's sugar, cherries or vanilla sauce. Beignets are also very famous and are commonly prepared with apples and served with vanilla sauce. Baked goods Pretzel =Bread and pastries= A broad range of different bread varieties is very characteristic for the Swabian baking culture. Therefore, there are many variations that are not widely distributed and known and are only baked in a special area or even only in one village but there are also some baked good that are baked all over the region and are available in every bakery. This holds true for Laugengeb√§ck, Pretzels, bread rolls and Hefezopf (lit. meaning yeast plaid) which rate among the traditional Swabian baked goods. The Swabian \\"Seele\\" (lit. soul) is a baguette-like white bread made from spelt and has its origin in Upper Swabia. It is prepared from a very runny dough from spelt flour, yeast, water and salt which is formed into an elonged bread and sprinkled with caraway and coarse salt. After baking it is crispy on the outside and very light and fluffy on the inside. It also stays moist inside due to the high gluten content of spelt flour. Briegel is a very similar baked good although it is native in East-Wurttemberg and is even moister than the Seele. It also belongs to the species of moistened breads, such as Wasserwecken and Knauzen from Wendlingen. Another speciality which is native to Reutlingen is the Dreik√∂nigsmutschel, (lit. Three Kings Mutschel), a star-shaped, mellow yeast pastry with eight prongs and a round elevation in the middle which is the circle of a plaided garland. It is traditionally eaten on the Thursday after Epiphany and people play dice to eat it and celebrate. =Savory cakes= B√§tscher The Swabian Cream Cake is a thin yeast flat bread spread with sour cream and topped with onion or leak and bacon, very similar to the Flammkuchen from Alsace. The topping may vary and some add egg or caraway seed. In the area of the city Heilbronn a variation called \\"Peterlingkuchen\\" (parsley cake) is popular and as the name suggests, the flat bread is also topped with parsley. The name also differs depending on the locale, variations are ‚ÄûDennetle‚Äú, ‚ÄûDinnette‚Äú, ‚ÄûBlooz‚Äú and ‚ÄûB√§tscher‚Äú. Very famous is also the Swabian Zwiebelkuchen which is very similar to the French Quiche Lorraine. It is usually eaten in late summer and autumn together with Federweisser or already fermented apple juice. =Sweet cakes= There are a variety of cakes prepared in Swabian homes, since the German tradition of Sunday afternoon Kaffee und Kuchen is widely practiced by Swabians. Also very popular is the Swabian Tr√§ubleskuchen, a cake with a shortcrust pastry base and a filling of redcurrant (Tr√§uble) and beaten egg whites.

The United Way of Metropolitan Chicago serves the city of Chicago and its surrounding suburbs, allocating funding to other charitable organizations, especially those that provide needed healthcare, education, and income services. History =The Great Depression= The United Way of Metropolitan Chicago underwent a variety of name changes and mergers throughout its history. It officially began as an unemployment relief organization.United Way of Metro Chicago. \\"A 75 Year History.\\" (2013), 2. Begun by Chicago business leaders as a means to quell the crippling economic effects of the Great Depression, the as-yet unnamed organization unofficially began in 1930 with a committee of 25 of the city's civic and business leaders.United Way of Metro Chicago. \\"A 75 Year History.\\" (2013), 1. It was in 1932 that the committee was officially recognized as a part of Illinois Governor Louis L. Emerson's Commission on Unemployment and Relief and named the Emergency Welfare Fund. In 1932 the Welfare Fund changed its focus from unemployment relief to providing funding to other nonprofit agencies through the Community Chest model. (See: Community Chest (organization).) Organizations applied to receive funding from the Welfare Fund, which evolved into a fundraising agency.United Way of Metro Chicago. \\"A 75 Year History.\\" (2013), 2. Some of the Welfare Fund's first applications came from Chicago branches of Catholic Charities USA, the American Red Cross, and The Salvation Army, among others. Also in 1932, the Chicago Urban League became the Welfare Fund's first member organization that primarily served minority communities. The Gads Hill Center was the first charity funded by the Welfare Fund to focus on the needs of the Latino community.United Way of Metro Chicago. \\"A 75 Year History.\\" (2013), 2. Similar community chests began to emerge in Chicago's suburbs in the 1930s as well. =Community Fund= In 1933 the Emergency Welfare Fund was renamed the Community Fund of Allied Chicago Charities, only to change again the following year, becoming the Community Fund of Chicago.United Way of Metro Chicago. \\"A 75 Year History.\\" (2013), 2. As the Community Fund, the organization continued to develop its fundraising and allocation systems. During the late 1930s, the Community Fund partnered with the Council of Social Agencies of Chicago, a partnership that would last until 1977.United Way of Metropolitan Chicago Records. Richard J. Daley Library, University of Illinois at Chicago. 2013. The Council managed volunteers and community referrals, while the Community Fund continued to focus on fundraising and allocations. In 1937, as unemployment fell, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made federal budget cuts that caused unemployment to rise again, especially in sectors like Chicago's African American community. In that year, the Community Fund became dedicated to funding organizations that attempted to return that community to self-sufficiency.United Way of Metro Chicago. \\"A 75 Year History.\\" (2013), 3. =World War II= During World War II, national unemployment was greatly alleviated, and the Community Fund accordingly shifted its attention to the war effort, joining with the Community and War Fund between 1943-1945 to provide aid to communities affected deeply by the Holocaust and the aftermath of warfare. During the war and the immediate post-war years, the Community Fund's partnership with Chicago's business community, already robust as a result of the Fund's origins in the business community, expanded and strengthened, reinforcing the Fund's influence and resources. Immediately following the war, Chicago's population boom created new issues that drew the attention of the Community Fund. Rapid growth in the suburbs led to the 1947 creation of the Suburban Community Chest Council, which consolidated disparate community chests in the suburbs. It primarily focused on the needs of the Western suburbs.United Way of Metro Chicago. \\"A 75 Year History.\\" (2013), 4. =Fundraising: The Crusade of Mercy= The Community Fund's increased interaction with Chicago's business community led to the inception of what is today called the Loaned Executive Program (the Program began as an initiative with several different names).United Way of Metro Chicago. \\"A 75 Year History.\\" (2013), 5. Begun in the mid-1950s, this program nominally borrowed executives, from companies like ComEd, Northern Trust, and LaSalle Bank, to fundraise for the Community Fund. Simultaneously, many large corporations began internal fundraising initiatives. These would encourage employees to sign up for automatic donations; that is, a preset amount of money would be deducted from participant's paychecks and donated to the Community Fund.United Way of Metropolitan Chicago Records. Richard J. Daley Library. University of Illinois at Chicago. 2013. These fundraising initiatives were furthered in 1957, when the Community Fund partnered with the Mid-America Chapter of the American Red Cross, forming the Community Fund-Red Cross Joint Appeal.United Way of Metro Chicago. \\"A 75 Year History.\\" (2013), 6. This organization, run by but independent of the Community Fund and the Red Cross, consolidated both organizations' fundraising efforts. In 1959, the organization changed its name to the Crusade of Mercy, and became the Metropolitan Crusade of Mercy in 1964 (it was officially called the Community Fund-Red Cross-Suburban Community Chest Council Crusade of Mercy). Now incorporating suburban Chicago as well as the city proper, the Metropolitan Crusade of Mercy actively campaigned for funds annually, in addition to maintaining Community Chest's corporate employee fundraising program. In 1980, the Crusade of Mercy merged with the United Way of Metropolitan Chicago (what the Community Fund would become in 1977), becoming the United Way/Crusade of Mercy. This merger brought the Crusade of Mercy's wide-ranging fundraising efforts more fully under the auspices of the United Way. The two United Ways, of Metropolitan Chicago and of Suburban Chicago, were United Way/Crusade of Mercy's two allocating agencies. Also at this time, the Red Cross became a primary grant recipient. Finally, in 1995, United Way/Crusade of Mercy was merged into the United Way of Metropolitan Chicago. It continued to service suburban Chicago as well as the city.United Way of Metro Chicago. \\"A 75 Year History.\\" (2013), 7. =The 1970s: Restructuring= In 1963, America's national Community Chest system consolidated and became the United Way of America. The Community Fund, because it was a community chest organization, became an affiliate of the new United Way in that year. By 1975, the Community Fund of Chicago was the largest entity in the national United Way system.United Way of Metro Chicago. \\"A 75 Year History.\\" (2013), 7. The Suburban Community Chest Council was likewise now associated with the United Way, and it became the United Way of Suburban Chicago in 1976. The Council of Social Agencies of Chicago, with which the Community Fund had partnered in the 1940s, had become the Welfare Council of Metropolitan Chicago by 1951, and by 1973 was known as the Council for Community Services of Metropolitan Chicago. By this time, the Council for Community Services performed a function very similar to that of the Community Fund; it was a fundraising entity that allocated funds to other non- profits.United Way of Metropolitan Chicago Records. Richard J. Daley Library. University of Illinois at Chicago. 2013. On July 1, 1977, the Community Fund and the Council for Community Services combined to form United Way of Metropolitan Chicago. This act consolidated allocation efforts and allowed the new United Way to focus more attention on planning, research, public policy issues, and community referral services. The United Way of Metropolitan Chicago received the bulk of its funds from the Metropolitan Crusade of Mercy, and in addition to maintaining its allocation process, it now also ran two additional programs: the Voluntary Action Center and the Community Referral Service.<United Way of Metropolitan Chicago Records. Richard J. Daley Library. University of Illinois at Chicago. 2013. After the 1977 merger, the United Way began to work with Comprehensive Community Services, Inc., an independent agency entirely funded by the United Way. Comprehensive Community Services in turn funded agencies, both several also funded by United Way directly, and others not affiliated with United Way. Begun in 1972, Comprehensive Community Services had a special focus on governmental relations, and dealt frequently with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). Comprehensive Community Services' primary service focus was children; they developed an initiative to assist adolescents, called the Joint Service Program for Adolescents, that helped placement and group home non-profits in their dealings with DCFS. Comprehensive Community Services also participated in GAP, an initiative that aimed to raise awareness about and resources allocated for teen pregnancy.United Way of Metropolitan Chicago Records. Richard J. Daley Library. University of Illinois at Chicago. 2013. =The 80s and 90s= In 1982, the United Way of Metropolitan Chicago underwent yet another name change, becoming simply the United Way of Chicago. In 1983, concurrent with the election of Mayor Harold Washington and renewed fears of unemployment, the United Way of Chicago launched its Special Grants and Incentives Program (also called Priority Grants or Venture Grants). This program allowed United Way to allocate additional funds to severely underserved communities. This initiative required United Way to measure economic need, something that sparked a debate regarding the nature and efficacy of deeming a community especially economically underserved.United Way of Metropolitan Chicago Records. Richard J. Daley Library. University of Illinois at Chicago. 2013. The debate holds that, in essence, determining need requires more than simply evaluating economic factors, and that to privilege one community is to deny another. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the United Way continued to expand its focus on minority groups. In 1994, about 90 percent of the organization's fund recipients were organizations that served minorities.United Way of Metro Chicago. \\"A 75 Year History.\\" (2013), 10. In the mid-1990s, United Way created Outreach Committees to focus on and directly reach out to Chicago's minority communities. =Consolidation= The early 2000s were a time of great change and consolidation within the United Way. In 2000 the organization changed its name to the United Way in Chicago. In 2003, under President and CEO Janet Froetscher, the United Way in Chicago and the by now overwhelmingly numerous suburban United Ways consolidated into one organization, the United Way of Metropolitan Chicago. This was the largest non-profit merger in history.Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management. \\"Alumni Profiles: Janet Froetscher '83.\\" http://alumni.kellogg.northwestern.edu/profiles/alumni/jfroetscher.htm The newly consolidated United Way continued focusing on minority communities, launching the African American Initiative in 2005 and the Latin American Initiative in 2007. Live United 2020 In 2013, United Way of Metropolitan Chicago's primary initiative, Live United 2020, focuses on providing quality healthcare, financial stability, and a good education to underserved communities to aid particularly poverty-stricken communities to battle Chicago's infamous iniquities, especially in the wake of Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the city's decision to close 40 Chicago Public Schools, especially in the economically stricken areas of the West and South sides. Administration The United Way of Metropolitan Chicago consists of an Executive Board and a Board of Directors, and remains intimately tied to Chicago's corporate community through corporate fundraising efforts and the Loaned Executive Program. In 2013, the Chair of the Board of Directors is Ellen Costello, CEO and US Country Head of BMO Financial Group. The Vice-Chairs are Deborah L. DeHaas (CIO, Deloitte), Jay L.

The lake is surrounded by Plummer Peak to the east, a lookout point to the west, the Miners Creek drainage and Glacier Peak to the south, and Canyon Lake to the north. The course of the popular Miners Ridge Trail skirts the lake. Glacier Peak can be seen from the outlet of the lake, and the peak reflected in the lake is a popular photographic subject. As a result of a relatively mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation near the end of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to mid-twentieth century. Climate Image Lake is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, p. 15 Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains, which surround Image Lake. As fronts from approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Global warming is expected to have a number of negative long-term ecological impacts on the region, including drought, increased forest fires, forest degradation to drought and disease, and less healthy or nonexistent salmon runs. The distribution and survival of plant species, especially those that inhabit alpine environments, as well as animals that are specifically adapted to those environments, will also be adversely affected. Glaciers are also expected to recede due to a decreased buildup of snowpack and higher overall temperatures. Hydrology Image Lake at sunset Image Lake has a drainage basin with an area of less than . Its primary outflow is a small, unnamed creek that feeds into Miners Creek, which in turn drains into the Suiattle River. The Suiattle River drains into the Skagit River, which in turn empties into Puget Sound. The highest point in the drainage basin is nearly above sea level. The lake itself is roughly circular, and has an area of about . Geology Subduction and tectonic activity began in the area began during the late cretaceous period, about . The area was previously an oceanic environment, consisting mainly of sedimentary and volcanic rocks.Beckey, pp. 218‚Äì220 Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the oligocene, about . However, mountain building in the area did not begin until the miocene, approximately . Image Lake is located in the Cloudy Pass batholith, an intrusive formation that was formed approximately , during the early miocene. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is south of Image Lake, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene. Due to Glacier Peak's proximity to Image Lake, volcanic ash is quite common in the area, and plays a major role in the formation of soil.Krukeberg, p. 321 Throughout the ice age, the North Cascades were mostly covered in thick glaciers, extending to near Puget Sound. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately , and most valleys were ice-free by .Beckey, pp. 217‚Äì218 As a result, valleys in the area are deep and u-shaped, and mountains tend to be rocky, with steep slopes and narrow summits. Ecology =Flora= A mountain hemlock forest similar to those that grow near Image Lake Image Lake and the surrounding area is in the North Cascades ecoregion, and temperate rainforests grow at lower elevations, such as in the Suiattle River valley.Beckey, pp. 214‚Äì217. Common trees in this habitat include western redcedar, western hemlock, and Douglas fir.Krukeberg, p. 308 At middle elevations, forests are dominated by Pacific silver fir and, to a lesser extent, Alaska cedar. Devil's club and huckleberry grow in moist areas on the forest floor. However, beargrass and salal dominate in drier areas. The mid-elevation forests also receive more precipitation, especially in the form of snowfall, than lower elevations.Krukeberg, p. 313 Western hemlock and Douglas fir are also present, especially at the lower edge of the mid-elevation forest zone.Krukeberg, p. 316 At higher elevations, Douglas fir and redcedar are largely replaced by mountain hemlock and Alaska cedar, which both become more common as elevation increases.Krukeberg, p. 324 The mid- elevation forest zone often occupies the steepest slopes on the mountainside, which result in the occurrence of avalanche tracks. Avalanche tracks are usually occupied by scrub such as Sitka alder, as well as smaller shrubs and herbs.Krukeberg, p. 317 At higher elevations, mountain hemlock and subalpine fir are the most common trees. Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest becomes increasingly fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Scree slopes are also common.Krukeberg, p. 326 Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover. For the same reasons, the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation.Krukeberg, p. 322 At the upper edge of the parkland, trees tend to be stunted, and grow in small clumps. Common shrubs include heather and mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub- alpine zone. Above the subalpine zone, trees become less common. Trees that do manage to gain a foothold are often stunted, with contorted branches due to high winds, increased snowfall, and growing seasons of 2‚Äì3 months. These trees are known as \\"krummholz\\", which means \\"bent wood\\" in German. Heather, herbs, and grasses are also present,Krukeberg, p. 343 but are often very sparse.Krukeberg, p. 344 Temperatures often fluctuate greatly, making for a difficult growing season.Krukeberg, p. 346 =Fauna= Mountain goats are common near Image Lake. Wildlife is common in the area's ecosystem. Marmots tend to live in large social groups, and play a role in regulating the alpine vegetation. Eagles, hawks, coyotes, and badgers are common predatory animals.Krukeberg, p. 334 Clark's nutcrackers and Canada jays are also common, and various species of grouse are present.Krukeberg, p. 335 Insects and hummingbirds are common pollinators.Krukeberg, pp. 335‚Äì336 Larger animals are not as common, but are still present. A grizzly bear was photographed near Cascade pass in October 2010, and as many as twenty grizzlies may be living in the Cascades, south of the Canada‚ÄìUS border. Wolves, pine martens lynx, wolverines, cougars, weasels, and black bears are also present, and are usually detected by camera traps. During the summer, bears consume up to 30,000 calories a day in preparation for hibernation, in a dietary phase known as hyperphagia. There have also been attempts to re-introduce fishers to the region. Cougars are mainly nocturnal and solitary, and are so secretive that they are seldom seen. Wolves were eradicated from the Cascades by the 1930s, but began re-establishing resident packs at least as early as 1990. The most common large herbivore is the black-tailed deer, a subspecies of the mule deer. Elk and moose are less common. Mountain goats are well-adapted to steep terrain and cold temperatures, and are not usually found at lower elevations. There are eight species of bats that live in the North Cascades. History Horse camp at Image Lake, circa 1920‚Äì1930 There is archaeological evidence that Native Americans had been using the area for at least 8,500 years before present, and had been present at Cascade Pass for at least 9,600 years. Wild game was apparently utilized by Native Americans, and obsidian was exploited since at least 5,000 years before present. They used several routes that passed through the region, and may have used its natural resources during the summer.Beckey, p. 220 Some tribes personified the mountains and incorporated them into their religions. Many of these routes followed ridge tops in order to avoid the dense brush and avalanche chutes of the valley bottoms. Horses were also used in the eighteenth century. There was a trail used by Native Americans as a route between Lake Chelan and the Suiattle River valley. The trail apparently traversed Cloudy Pass, which is some distance east of the lake. It was later used by miners and shepherds in the early 1900s. Shepherding was banned on Miners Ridge in 1940, but the popularity of the area continued to grow. Due to the area's popularity, the surrounding meadows deteriorated as a result of livestock grazing and off-trail hiking. As a result, livestock were allocated to the nearby Lady Camp Basin and hardier plants were introduced to the area surrounding the lake. Image Lake was originally called \\"Mirror Lake\\", but was given its present name on by Hugh Ritter and Rudo Fromme, who were employees of the US Forest Service. The lake was first surveyed on by the Forest Service. Kennecott Copper Corporation, as of 1988, planned to dig an open-pit copper mine in a basin approximately one mile east of Image Lake. However, protests by various advocacy groups, such as The Mountaineers, prevented the plan from developing further. In 2003, floods washed out large portions of the Suiattle River Road, beginning from the trailhead, making Image Lake more accessible from Holden or Trinity. As of , construction crews are repairing the road, which was scheduled to be open by 2014. However, the Forest Service has a limited budget, and the effort to rebuild the road has been criticized by environmental groups, partly because of the lower number of visitors, since access from the west has become almost impossible. Since Image Lake is all but inaccessible from the west, it is necessary for hikers to access the lake from the east, via a two-day hike from Holden or Trinity. Hiking Miners Ridge seen from Plummer Mountain The trail to Image Lake can be accessed from the Suiattle River Road. It can also be accessed from Holden, on the east side of the Cascade crest, west of Lake Chelan. The trail begins by following the Suiattle River, eventually reaching open meadows with views of Glacier Peak. There is also an alpine route that leads from the Miners Ridge Trail to Plummer Mountain,Beckey, p. 383 and a little used trail that leads to Canyon Lake and Totem Pass, which is about southeast of Dome Peak.

Hopkins Miranda is largely responsible for creating Puya's 'Latin metal' fusion style. Hopkins Miranda and guitarist Ramon Ortiz are the composers (music and lyrics) of most Puya's songs. Hopkins Miranda is also a developing music producer and plays, composes and directs other musical projects. He is currently the bass player for De La Tierra. History =Beginnings= Hopkins Miranda was born to mother Margarita Miranda (of Corozal, Puerto Rico) and father Harold E. Hopkins Jr. (of Stanwood, Michigan) and was raised in Puerto Rico. He started taking classical piano following the example of his older sister, pianist Brenda Hopkins, at an early age. At age 18, he moved to the bass. He had some garage band experience (AC/DC, GNR, Led Zeppelin). His first live gig on bass was with Gilberto Alomar (Puerto Rico's underground rock guitar legend), the late Pedro Candelario (main vocal and guitar) and Rocco Torres (drums) in a John Lennon tribute band, playing mostly Paul McCartney's bass lines. =The Evidence= After that he formed part of a trio, The Evidence, along with the Alomar brothers, Gilberto (guitar and main vocal) and Hugo (drums), playing rock from the 1960s and 1970s, some originals by Gilberto, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix. In 1990, he got together with high school friend Ramon Ortiz (guitar) and founded Whisker Biscuit (original Latin/rock/funk-fusion). =Puya= In 1992 The Evidence moved to Ft. Lauderdale and changed its name to Puya. The band gained good response from the public in the South Florida alternative/Latin/rock/hardcore music scene. In 1993, the band recorded its first six-song cassette, Puya-Whisker Biscuit and then in 1994-95 released a CD titled Puya under Noiz Boiz Records and produced by Jeff Renza/Puya. In May 1996 the band had its first overseas show in Bogota, Colombia at Rock Al Parque Festival. They played in front of 60,000 people and were the only independent band on the bill. After that they started making recordings in Los Angeles, California with producer Bob Ezrin (Kiss, Pink Floyd) under the umbrella ALMO (Rondor Music) Publishing. In 1997 Hopkins Miranda moved with the band to Los Angeles, CA and played in clubs. After a while the band was signed with MCA Records and recorded the Fundamental CD produced by Gustavo Santaolalla (Juanes, Babel). Fundamental won the Best Rock Fusion album of the year at the 2000 Billboard Latin Music Awards. The success of Fundamental sent the band to the Ozzfest '99 tour. Puya has been the only full Latin band to tour with the Ozzfest playing in Spanish. After that was the Snocore (w/Incubus, System of a Down and Mike Patton's Mr. Bungle). Puya has been the opening act for Fear Factory; Iron Maiden; Red Hot Chili Peppers (So. American tour); Sepultura; Hatebreed; Slipknot and others. In 2001 Puya recorded a second album, Union (MCA) produced by Garth Richardson and Andrew Murdock and co-produced by Puya. It features the collaboration of Latin percussionists Angel 'Cachete' Maldonado and Anthony Carrillo as well as Brenda Hopkins Miranda on the piano for one song and the late trumpet player Juancito Torres (Fania All Stars). =Yeva= Puya took a break in 2004. After having spent some time in Granada, Spain, Hopkins Miranda returned to Puerto Rico and formed another Latin fusion band called Yeva; he also started producing. The three song Yeva EP was produced by Harold. Yeva played Coachella Fest 2007, winning the best newcomer recognition according to the Chicago Tribune. During that time Hopkins Miranda finished producing Puya's first live DVD, Puya P'a Ti- Live in Puerto Rico under his own independent label Ahorake. He also played bass for Tego Calderon, renowned hip hop artist from Puerto Rico, on El Abayarde Contraataca World Tour. =Puya comeback= Puya made a comeback in 2009, playing many Puerto Rican festivals and headlining one stage at the Rock al Parque 2010 festival in Bogota, Colombia. That year Puya recorded a self-produced, five-song EP, Areyto. Areyto is a music/dance ritual of Puerto Rico's native Taino Indians. On that album Hopkins Miranda composed, arranged and produced two songs, one of which is a derivative work of Nicolas Guillen's \\"La Muralla\\" and which featured guest artists Tego Calder√≥n, Tito Auger, Mimi Maura, and Antonio Cab√°n Vale \\"El Topo\\". =Tambores Calientes= In 2011, Hopkins Miranda founded the rock/blues/bomba fusion band Tambores Calientes with Gilberto Alomar and Marcos Pe√±alosa. Bomba is original Puerto Rican music with African roots; it is played with three special bomba drums, maracas, and repetitive vocal chants that also contain elements of Taino music and Spanish Gypsy melodies. Tambores Calientes is the first band with this unique combination of sounds. Other works include Julio Voltio, Garcia Lopez, Antiheroes and Trafico Pesado. In Hopkins Miranda's own words, \\"music never ceases to amaze and nurture the spirits on its ever evolving nature.\\" In 2017 Harold joined Latin American metal supergroup De La Tierra to replace Sr. Flavio.

The HTML layout engines in modern web browsers perform DOCTYPE \\"sniffing\\" or \\"switching\\", wherein the DOCTYPE in a document served as \`text/html\` determines a layout mode, such as \\"quirks mode\\" or \\"standards mode\\". The \`text/html\` serialization of HTML5, which is not SGML-based, uses the DOCTYPE only for mode selection. Since web browsers are implemented with special- purpose HTML parsers, rather than general-purpose DTD-based parsers, they don't use DTDs and will never access them even if a URL is provided. The DOCTYPE is retained in HTML5 as a \\"mostly useless, but required\\" header only to trigger \\"standards mode\\" in common browsers. DTDs =Syntax= The general syntax for a document type declaration is: ]> or ]> In XML, the root element that represents the document is the first element in the document. For example, in XHTML, the root element is <html>, being the first element opened (after the doctype declaration) and last closed. The keywords SYSTEM and PUBLIC suggest what kind of Document Type Definition (DTD) it is (one that is on a private system or one that is open to the public). If the PUBLIC keyword is chosen then this keyword is followed by a restricted form of \\"public identifier\\" called Formal Public Identifier (FPI) enclosed in double quote marks. After that, necessarily, a \\"system identifier\\" enclosed in double quote marks, too, is provided. For example, the FPI for XHTML 1.1 is \\"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN\\" and, there are 3 possible system identifiers available for XHTML 1.1 depending on the needs, one of them is the URI reference \\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\\". If, instead, the SYSTEM keyword is chosen, only a system identifier must be given. It means that the XML parser must locate the DTD in a system specific fashion, in this case, by means of a URI reference of the DTD enclosed in double quote marks. The last part, surrounded by literal square brackets ([]), is called an internal subset which can be used to add/edit entities or add/edit PUBLIC keyword behaviors. The internal subset is always optional (and sometimes even forbidden within simple SGML profiles, notably those for basic HTML parsers that don't implement a full SGML parser). On the other hand, document type declarations are slightly different in SGML-based documents such as HTML, where the public identifier may be associated with the system identifier. This association might be performed, e. g., by means of a catalog file resolving the FPI to a system identifier. =Example= The first line of a World Wide Web page may read as follows: This document type declaration for XHTML includes by reference a DTD, whose public and whose system identifier is \`http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\`. An entity resolver may use either identifier for locating the referenced external entity. No internal subset has been indicated in this example or the next ones. The root element is declared to be \`html\` and, therefore, it is the first tag to be opened after the end of the doctype declaration in this example and the next ones, too. The HTML tag is not part of the doctype declaration but has been included in the examples for orientation purposes.  Common DTDs  Some common DTDs have been put into lists. W3C has produced a list of DTDs commonly used in the web, which contains the \\"bare\\" HTML5 DTD, older XHTML/HTML DTDs, DTDs of common embedded XML-based formats like MathML and SVG as well as \\"compound\\" documents that combine those formats. Both W3C HTML5 and its corresponding WHATWG version recommend browsers to only accept XHTML DTDs of certain FPIs and to prefer using internal logic over fetching external DTD files. It further specifies an \\"internal DTD\\" for XHTML which is merely a list of HTML entity names. =HTML 4.01 DTDs = Strict DTD does not allow presentational markup with the argument that Cascading Style Sheets should be used for that instead. This is how the Strict DTD looks: Transitional DTD allows some older PUBLIC and attributes that have been deprecated: If frames are used, the Frameset DTD must be used instead, like this: =XHTML 1.0 DTDs= XHTML's DTDs are also Strict, Transitional and Frameset. XHTML Strict DTD. No deprecated tags are supported and the code must be written correctly according to XML Specification. XHTML Transitional DTD is like the XHTML Strict DTD, but deprecated tags are allowed. XHTML Frameset DTD is the only XHTML DTD that supports Frameset. The DTD is below. =XHTML 1.1 DTD= XHTML 1.1 is the most current finalized revision of XHTML, introducing support for XHTML Modularization. XHTML 1.1 has the stringency of XHTML 1.0 Strict. =XHTML Basic DTDs= XHTML Basic 1.0 XHTML Basic 1.1 =HTML5 DTD-less DOCTYPE= HTML5 uses a \`DOCTYPE\` declaration which is very short, due to its lack of references to a DTD in the form of a URL or FPI. All it contains is the tag name of the root element of the document, \`HTML\`. In the words of the specification draft itself: > In other words, , case-insensitively. With the exception of the lack of a URI or the FPI string (the FPI string is treated case sensitively by validators), this format (a case-insensitive match of the string \`!DOCTYPE HTML\`) is the same as found in the syntax of the SGML based HTML 4.01 \`DOCTYPE\`. Both in HTML4 and in HTML5, the formal syntax is defined in upper case letters, even if both lower case and mixes of lower case upper case are also treated as valid. In XHTML5 the \`DOCTYPE\` must be a case- sensitive match of the string \\"\\". This is because in XHTML syntax all HTML element names are required to be in lower case, including the root element referenced inside the HTML5 \`DOCTYPE\`. The \`DOCTYPE\` is optional in XHTML5 and may simply be omitted. However, if the markup is to be processed as both XML and HTML, a DOCTYPE should be used.

Life Dubez was born and died in Vienna, Austria, of Italian extraction, according to J. Powrozniak .J√≥zef Powro≈∫niak: Gitarren-Lexikon (Berlin, 1979; 3rd edition, 1986), p. 63. His father was a weaver and young Johann Dubez grew up in Neulerchenfeld, a suburb of Vienna. In 1846, he was engaged as violinist in the Josefstadt Theatre, Vienna, and formed there an acquaintance with the guitar virtuoso Giulio Regondi. Dubez, who frequently heard Regondi perform when the latter appeared in Vienna, was so fascinated that he adopted the guitar, too, and studied it under Regondi and Johann Kaspar Mertz in this city. His progress was very rapid for in 1847 he gave his first guitar concert in the old Vienna Academy of Music, playing Regondi's compositions and meeting with enormous success. Dubez was a brilliant harpist, too, and under Giacomo Meyerbeer's baton he played the well-known harp solo in the opera Vielka. Some few years previous to his death he undertook a protracted concert tour, visiting Bucharest and Constantinople. In the former city he was commanded to perform before the Queen of Romania, and in the latter before the Sultan and Court, receiving the decoration of the Medjidia Order. Dubez was elected the first president of the Vienna Zither Society, founded in 1875, and also created honorary member of the Prague Zither Society. Music Dubez's guitar compositions are written in a similar style as those of his teacher, Mertz, but the majority remain in manuscript. He has also composed several harp solos, published by Spina, B√∂sendorfer, and Cranz of Hamburg, Germany. Dubez's portrait was published by the Vienna Zither Society's Journal in 1891. As a guitarist, he takes rank with Mertz and Regondi, and was one of the most celebrated of Austrian virtuosi. Among his published compositions there are a Fantasia on Hungarian Melodies for guitar, issued by Diabelli and Co., Vienna. His opus numbers 11, 33, 34, 35 and 37 are harp solos, which were published by Cranz, Hamburg.Philip J.

The devices work with a companion mobile app for Android and iOS, which allows users to locate lost items through Bluetooth or where they were last seen. In September 2018 GoPro vet CJ Prober became CEO of Tile. In September 2015, Tile launched Generation 2 hardware that includes find-your- phone functionality and other feature upgrades, which by January 2016 sold over 4.5 million units. In August 2017, two new versions of the Tile were launched, the Tile Sport and Tile Style. , the lineup consists of the Pro, Mate, Slim, and Sticker.  Function  By attaching a Tile hardware device to a keychain or other item, a user can later use the Tile app to help locate the item if the object is lost. The Tile application uses Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 radio technology to locate Tiles within a 150-foot to 300-foot range (depending on the product). Each Tile comes with a built-in speaker so the user can hear it within close range. Generation 2 of the Tile device has a volume of 90 decibels, three times as loud as Generation 1's volume. The Gen 2 adds a \\"find your phone\\" feature. Tiles are 1.5 square inches. The application can locate Tiles beyond the 100-foot Bluetooth range, using \\"crowd GPS\\": if an item with an attached Tile device is reported lost and comes within range of another user's Tile application, the nearby user's application will send the item's owner an anonymous update of that item's location. Alternatively, a user can share their Tile with another user, to let both users locate the Tile. The first generation of Tiles could be shared with any number of users, while the later generations can only be shared for free with a single other user, with unlimited sharing available as part of the $2.99 / month Tile Premium service. Originally, Tile's built-in batteries had a battery life of about one year. Users were automatically notified when the batteries were nearing depletion, and were eligible to receive a discount on a replacement product. The used Tile could then be sent back to be recycled. In October 2018, the Tile Mate and Tile Pro were redesigned to have user-replaceable batteries. These models have lower water-resistance ratings than the models requiring factory battery replacement.  Funding  Tile's developers used Selfstarter, an open source website platform, to crowdfund the project through pre-orders. As of July 7, 2013, Tile had raised over by selling preordered Tiles directly to 50,000 backers through their website. In 2014, Tile raised additional Series A funding of US$13 million led by GGV Capital and a further US$3 million from Khosla Ventures in 2015.  Dispute with Apple  In May 2020, Tile sought assistance from the European Union in a dispute it had with Apple regarding the provision of its services on Apple devices. It claimed that its app was not activated on apple devices while the FindMy service provided by Apple is activated automatically. Apple denied the allegation. In September 2020, Tile joined the Coalition for App Fairness which aims to reach better conditions for the inclusion of apps into app stores.  Lawsuit  On November 7, 2013, Tile's founder Nick Evans and his company Reveal Labs were sued for allegedly stealing the Tile idea while Evans was employed by Jonathan C. Coon. The case was eventually settled out of court.

The battle took place on 14 June 1792, between a detachment of a Polish army of Micha≈Ç Wielhorski and a Russian army group under the command of Michail Kachovski. Main Polish forces under command of Poniatowski withdrew to Po≈Çonne across Czantoria; they were secured from the south by a division under command of Ko≈õciuszko. A Polish army train, secured by a division of Wielhorski, moved the shortest way across Boruszkowice. Wielhorski had under his command 6500 soldiers and 12 cannons. The route which he moved was sodden and an area in which were forests allowing Russian formations cover making it difficult for Polish defence. After getting information about Polish withdrawal, Mikhail Kakhovsky rallied two Cossacks regiments under command of Alexey Orlov and a part of cavalry under command of Alexander Tormasov. These forces attacked and destroyed the rear of the Polish train. There were clashes between the Polish and Russian cavalry and fighting between Polish and Russian infantry and artillery. In all probability, the Polish cavalry successfully defended against the first attack of Russian cavalry then withdrew. Infantry and artillery began defence of train. The collapsing of bridge on the swamp river Derevichka was in truth a trap. Polish infantry (1000 soldiers) and artillery successfully defended against the Russians who were able to receive reinforcements during fight. When the Polish did not get relief, they began withdrawal under enemy fire. The Polish division received heavy losses of soldiers, 7 cannons, and a train. The only positive result was the halting of the Russian rally for several hours. Bibliography Piotr Derdej Ziele≈Ñce- Mir-Dubienka 1792 Bellona Warsaw 2000 48-75 pages.

Early life and education Breyer was born in Vara≈ædin, Croatia on 23 October 1863. He was raised in a Jewish family of Marko Breyer. Breyer's great grandfather Samuel Breyer moved to Rasinja, Croatia from Burgenland, Austria during Austrian Empire. His grandfather Jakov Breyer was born in Rasinja and later moved to Kri≈æevci, Croatia where his son Marko (Breyer's father) was born. Breyer's father was banker and -manager of the \\"Kri≈æevaƒçka dioniƒçka ≈°tedionica\\" (Kri≈æevci equity savings), longtime representative of the Kri≈æevci City Assembly and municipal prefect deputy. Breyer spent his early childhood in Vara≈ædin. He finished elementary school in Kri≈æevci and attended high school in Vara≈ædin, Zagreb and Trieste. Gimnazija Ivana Zakmardija Dijankoveƒçkoga; Ivan Pekliƒá; Kri≈æevaƒçki nakladnik Mirko Breyer; stranica 84, 85; broj 1/2003, godina V., sijeƒçanj 2004. Career After high school education Breyer worked in Trieste as an apprentice in a renowned trading company \\"Binenfeld\\". The company sent him to Aden, Yemen, at the time the important trading center of the East India Company in Arabia. There he started to learn foreign languages, including Arabic. Upon his return from Aden, Breyer pursued higher education in Trieste, Vienna, Leipzig, Munich and Hamburg. He studied commerce. In 1890 he returned to Kri≈æevci. From 1890 to 1893 he wrote poems for \\"Narodni list\\" Zadar (Peoples daily). Breyer moved to Zagreb in 1903. He spent his free time reading and collecting antiquities. In 1903, Breyer founded the educational publishing and antique bookstore \\"Slavenski znanstveni antikvarijat\\" (Slavic research antique store) in Zagreb. He sold the educational publishing bookstore in 1920, which was then renamed to \\"Jugoslavenska znastvena knji≈æara d.d.\\" (Yugoslav research bookstore). Breyer kept his antique bookstore until 1928, when it is liquidated. From 1929 to 1940 he was the general manager of a publishing company \\"Obnova\\" (Renewal). Under Breyer's leadership \\"Obnova\\" published works of a prominent Croatian writers such as Vladimir Nazor and Antun Gustav Mato≈°. Assimilation, persecution and World War II Breyer was supporter of a Jewish assimilation in Croatia, and a longtime member of the Israelites Zagreb community (now Jewish community Zagreb). In 1922 he founded the society \\"Narodni rad - dru≈°tvo ≈æidovskih asimilanata i anticionista u Hrvatskoj\\" (Peoples work - Society of Jewish assimilates and anti Zionists in Croatia). Breyer's aim was to gather all Croatian and Yugoslav Jews regardless of political view. On numerous occasions he called for Croatian Zionists to join him, and objected them on their lack of Croatian and Yugoslav patriotism. In 1924, on a second anniversary of a society, Breyer again called all the Croatian and Yugoslav Jews to join them in their society. Some of society notable members were; Samuel David Alexander, ≈†andor Alexander and Vladimir ≈†terk. During World War II Breyer was imprisoned, as a Jew, at Stara Gradi≈°ka concentration camp for six months. Later he was imprisoned two more times. During his incarceration he wrote a poem \\"U sabirnom logoru\\" (In the internment camp). Independent State of Croatia officials excluded Breyer from wearing the star of David Yellow badge. He managed to survive the Holocaust and after the war he worked as a bibliographer at the \\"Hrvatski nakladni zavod\\" (Croatian publishing bureau). Despite this well-known fact, during the time of communist Yugoslavia he was falsely put on the list of the Stara Gradi≈°ka concentration camp victims killed by Usta≈°e as a part of communist anti-Croatian propaganda. This false information was also accepted by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum during a massive unchecked import of data. Antiquities and donations From an early age Breyer collected antiquities. While in Aden he directed several shipments of ethnographic antiquities to Zagreb museums. Breyer donated to Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts around 80 autographs of notable Croats from 18th and 19th century. He also donated Museum of Arts and Crafts, Zagreb and Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb. After Breyer's death, his heirs donated to National and University Library in Zagreb 353 books and a large number of vintage magazines. Death Breyer died in Zagreb on 29 December 1946. He was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery.

Alagiri's supporters on 9 May 2007 on the Madurai office of Dinakaran, a Tamil newspaper, which resulted in the deaths of three people. The attack was a response to a survey published by Dinakaran on who people preferred as the future heir of M. Karunanidhi, chief of the political party Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). During mass protests throughout the region, the offices of the newspaper were firebombed and two press employees and a private security guard died. 17 people were charged by the Central Bureau of Investigation, but were all acquitted by the district court. Dayanidhi Maran resigned from the Union Cabinet, where he had been the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, as a result of the controversy surrounding the attack, which created a rift between him and DMK. Background M. K. Stalin and M. K. Azhagiri, sons of DMK chief M. Karunanidhi were in a succession battle to be the political heir of Karunanidhi. In May 2007, the newspaper Dinakaran caused controversy when it published the results of a series of opinion polls conducted by A.C. Nielsen Co. which appeared to show that Stalin had more public approval than his elder brother Azhagiri ‚Äì 70% of those polled preferred Stalin, while only 2% preferred Azhagiri (another 2% supported M. K. Kanimozhi, daughter of Karunanidhi). The newspaper is part of the Sun Group which is owned by Kalanidhi Maran, who is grand-nephew of Karunanidhi and brother of DMK politician and ex-Union Minister Dayanidhi Maran. Incident On 9 May 2007, agitated by the results of the survey, DMK cadres in the southern district of Tamil Nadu, particularly the supporters of Azhagiri, engaged in protests at Kamuthi, Dindigul, Tirunelveli, Virudhunagar and Tuticorin and various places in the Theni district. At Madurai, they protested by burning copies of the newspapers and raising slogans against the survey and the Maran brothers. They also held a road block protest, threw stones, and set seven buses on fire. Anticipating trouble, a team of anti-riot police under the Deputy Superintendent of Madurai were deployed outside the offices of the media group. Despite the police presence, a group of men hurled stones at the building housing the offices of Dinakaran, Sun TV and Tamil Murasu, all belonging to Sun Group. They also threw petrol bombs and set the building on fire, resulting in the death by asphyxiation of two employees and a private security guard. The staff of the newspaper blocked the Chennai Madurai highway, demanding the arrest of Azhagiri, charging him with responsibility for the incident. The staff also accused the police of inaction. Madurai Superintendent T. S. Anbu said there was no deliberate dereliction of duty by the police; however, the Director General of Police, D. Mukharjee, later admitted dereliction of duty by policemen and ordered a probe be conducted by a senior police official. Aftermath Kalanidhi Maran, managing director of Sun Networks, called this incident an \\"attack on freedom of the press\\", and vowed to fight for justice. M. Karunanidhi condemned the attack, calling it \\"an attack on democracy and press freedom\\", and promised legal action. On the whole issue of political heirs, he said that \\"there is no place for dynastic succession in the DMK\\". He later told the Tamil Nadu Assembly that he was puzzled by the timing of the survey, and had told the Dinakaran management that such polls may create unnecessary problems, but that the newspaper had ignored his advice. Several journalists' associations condemned the attack and submitted a memorandum calling for immediate police action, urging the government to bring charges against not only the assailants but also \\"the persons behind the conspiracy\\". Dayanidhi Maran, who is usually present along with Karunanidhi on most party functions, stayed away from the celebration of Karunanidhi's 50th year as legislator, which was attended by Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi. DMK's administrative committee suggested that Dayanidhi Maran be removed from the Union Cabinet for violating party discipline. Maran, however, resigned voluntarily, insisting that he had never taken part in anti- party activities and that someone was misleading the party chief. Kalaignar TV, a new channel owned by the Karunanidhi family, was launched as a potential rival to Sun TV when the tensions between Karunanidhi and the Maran brothers were at their highest. The government also announced the formation of Tamil Nadu Arasu Cable TV Corporation Limited, a new multiple-system operator which intended to end the monopoly of Sun Cable Vision. In December 2008, the Marans made peace with the Karunanidhi family. =Court proceedings= The management of Dinakaran accused the police of ignoring their formal complaint, which specifically sought action against Azhagiri, and instead choose to act on a suo motu complaint which did not include his name. On 16 May 2009, police arrested their prime suspect, P. Pandi (aka \\"Attack\\" Pandi), who later confessed to spearheading the attack. The case was transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation, which named 17 accused in a 32-page charge sheet, including a Deputy Superintendent charged with dereliction of duty. In December 2009, all 17 were acquitted by the district sessions court, which claimed that the case had not been proven beyond all reasonable doubt. In March 2011, the Madras High Court allowed an appeal challenging this decision, despite a delay in filing the same. The CBI contended that the trial court \\"ought to have considered the evidentiary value of Prosecution Witness 1\\", even though he had \\"turned hostile\\" during the proceedings.

In ancient Greece it was the site of a sanctuary to Pan and the nymphs. It is also known as Lychnospilia for the large number of oil lamps found in the cave. It has been identified as the cave which occurs in the Dyskolos of Menander. The cave was excavated in 1901. Three votive reliefs found in the cave are now on display in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. Because of its use for the veneration of Pan the cave is also called the Cave of Pan. It was one of the five caves of Pan in the vicinity of ancient Athens. Description In Attica most cave shrines dedicated to Pan and the nymphs featured a common type of votive relief. These show three females led by Hermes, often accompanied by Pan and Achelous (for his association with water), within a rocky framework simulating a cave entrance. The female figures are often identified as nymphs or sometimes more specifically the Charites. These reliefs were also found in the Phyle Cave and are now exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens as inventory numbers 1448, 1859 and 1879. Number 1879 is particularly complex and interesting. The relief shows a mountain god, Pan, a satyr playing the syrinx and Achelous with a cornucopia. They surround the familiar group of three females near a basin fed by a lion-head waterspout. The waterspout is pierced so that it could supply the water for the actual basin in the cave itself. Various dates have been proposed for the relief ranging from the middle of the fourth century BC to the first century BC, with the later Hellenistic date being more likely.

Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The California Coastal National Monument Expansion Act of 2013 would expand the boundary of the California Coastal National Monument, established by Presidential Proclamation 7264, to include the Point Arena-Stornetta public lands in Mendocino County, California. The bill would require management of such lands: (1) in accordance with the Presidential Proclamation, and (2) as part of the Monument. The bill would instruct the Secretary of the Interior to finalize an amendment to the Monument's management plan for the long-term protection and management of the lands added to the Monument under this Act. Finally, the bill would require management of the Monument as part of the National Landscape Conservation System. Congressional Budget office report H.R. 1411 would expand the boundary of the California Coastal National Monument to include 1,255 acres of federal land known as the Point Arena-Stornetta public lands; the new land is currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The bill would require the BLM to manage that land as part of the National Landscape Conservation System. Based on information provided by the BLM, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that implementing the legislation would have no significant impact on the federal budget. The BLM currently has a management plan for the Point Arena-Stornetta public lands, and that plan would not be altered under the bill. Thus, the CBO expects that implementing the legislation would not significantly affect the BLM‚Äôs operating costs. Enacting H.R. 1411 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 1411 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history =House= The California Coastal National Monument Expansion Act of 2013 was introduced by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) on April 9, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation, which held hearings about the bill on May 9, 2013. On July 8, 2013, the bill was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-139. On Friday, July 19, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 1411 would be on the schedule for Monday, July 22, 2013. H.R. 1411 was considered under a suspension of the rules. The bill passed by a voice vote. The bill was freshman Congressman Huffman's first bill to be passed. Debate and discussion Rep. Huffman argued in favor of passage of the bill because it would protect a \\"spectacular stretch of coastline\\" and would \\"provide an accessible way for visitors to see all that the Mendocino coast has to offer.\\" According to a Press Release from Huffman's office, his bill was supported by the following organizations: \\"Point Arena Mayor Lloyd Cross, the Mendocino Coast Chamber of Commerce, Visit Mendocino County, Inc., the Manchester-Point Arena Band of Pomo Indians, the Sierra Club, the Trust for Public Land, Mendocino Land Trust, Redwood Coast Conservancy, the Conservation Lands Foundation, the Wilderness Society, the Northcoast Environmental Center, local business and civic leaders, and the local community.\\" Representatives of some of these groups joined Huffman on March 29, 2013 to discuss the bill and listen to him announce that he would soon be introducing it in Congress. Arguments in favor of the bill included that it would help the regional tourism economy, help protect the habitat for several endangered species (the Point Arena mountain beaver and the Behren's Silverspot butterfly), and maintain current research use of the land.

It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Telephone and Data Systems Inc, and is the seventh-largest local exchange carrier in the U.S. TDS Telecom offers telephone, broadband Internet and television services to customers in thirty states and more than 900 rural and suburban communities, though it also serves some urban metropolitan communities. It also sells businesses communications services including VoIP (managed IP hosted) phone service, dedicated broadband Internet and hosted-managed services. With headquarters in Madison, TDS Telecom operates TDS Broadband LLC, and BendBroadband, and TDS Metrocom, LLC. Combined, the company employs nearly 3,300 people. TDS Telecom and parent company TDS Inc. are celebrating 50 years in business in 2019. On January 1, 2019, the contract between TDS and Nexstar Media, which allowed for TDS to rebroadcast television networks owned by Nexstar, expired, and on February 1, 2019, a new contract was signed. TDS president Jim Butman explained to affected viewers- over 50,000 of them in more than five US states- that the impasse was caused by unreasonable demands from Nexstar, including new rates that were more than double what TDS was previously paying. This was the largest and most protracted dispute in the company's history. TDS Telecom is a participant in the FCC's Connect America Fund, also known as A-CAM. With this funding TDS is on a ten-year push to bring high speed internet to the furthest reaches of its rural serving areas. Depending on location, the vast majority of TDS customers in eligible rural areas are expected to receive broadband speeds of 25Mbit/s download and 3 Mbit/s upload (25/3). The remaining customers are expected to receive broadband speeds at 10/1 and 4/1Mbit/s. In other less rural areas, TDS provides much higher broadband speeds, from 100 Mbit/s to 1Gigabit. More recently, TDS has been launching new fiber to the home services across Wisconsin and Idaho. New markets in Wisconsin include: Deforest, Windsor, McFarland, Monona Grove, Cottage Grove, Oregon and Merrimac communities, all within Dane County Wisconsin. In Idaho the communities of Coeur d'Alene, Rathdrum, Hayden, Post Falls, all within Kootenai County. These services are offered by TDS through CLEC TDS Metrocom, LLC which is operated by TDS Telecom.

Ring (1939 ‚Äì 1 July 2020) was an Irish hurler. At club level he played for a number of clubs, including Castlepollard and Kilmacud Crokes, and was a long-time member of the Westmeath senior hurling team. Playing career Born in Castlepollard, Ring was the son of a Cork-born father and a Louth-born mother and first played hurling when he joined the local Castlepollard club. He earned a call-up to the Westmeath minor team in 1954, before later moving to Cork and lining out with the Meelin club as a junior. On his return to Castlepollard, Ring won a county minor medal in 1956 and was promoted to the Westmeath senior team as goalkeeper at 18 years of age, a position he retained on and off for a further seven years. After winning a National League Division 2 in 1961, he ended the year by captaining Castlepollard to a county senior championship. Work brought Ring to Dublin, where he hurled for New Irelands for three years before later joining the Kilmacud Crokes club. By this stage he had switched from goalkeeper to midfielder and forward with the Westmeath senior team and claimed a second Division 2 title in 1964 before becoming one of the top marksmen of the 1960s and early 1970s. After his inter-county career ended in 1972, Ring continued to line out with Kilmacud Crokes and won county senior championship medals in 1974 and 1976. In retirement he came to be regarded as one of Westmeath's greatest-ever hurlers and was selected in the right wing-forward position on the Westmeath Hurling Team of the Millennium. Personal life Ring died in Rathcoole, County Dublin on 1 July 2020. He was survived by his wife Therese and six children. His son, Connie Ring, lined out with the Craobh Chiar√°in club and was a member of the Dublin senior hurling team.

Several different types of collections are titled spectral atlases: those intended for spectral classification, for key reference, or as a collection of spectra of a general type of object. In any spectral atlas, generally all the spectra have been taken with the same equipment, or with very similar instruments at different locations, to provide data as uniform as possible in its spectral resolution, wavelength coverage, noise characteristics, etc. Types =For spectral classification= When assigning a spectral classification, a spectral atlas is a collection of standard spectra of stars with known spectral types, against which a spectrum of an unknown star is compared. It is analogous to an identification key in biology. Originally, such atlases included reproductions of the monochrome spectra as recorded on photographic plates, as in the original Morgan-Keenan- Kellman atlas and other atlases. These atlases include identifications and notations for use of those spectral features to be used as discriminators between close spectral types. With very large surveys of the sky which include automated assignment of spectral classification from the digital spectra data, graphical atlases have been supplanted by libraries of spectra of standard stars which often can be downloaded from VizieR and other sources. =For key reference= A spectral atlas can be a very high-quality spectrum of a key reference object, often made with very high spectral resolution, generally presented in large-format graphical form as a line chart (but normally strictly without markers at specific data points) of intensity or relative intensity (which for a star whose spectrum is dominated by absorption lines runs from zero to a normalized continuum) as a function of wavelength. Such spectral atlases have been made several times for the Sun (e.g.,), Arcturus, other bright stars, planets, quasars, etc. Unlike classification atlases, such atlases made from data taken with photographic media were digitized with a densitometer and the digitized result is presented. Sometimes these atlases include identifications of spectral features, but often such identifications are presented in tabular form in separate publications (e.g.,). =For objects of a general type= A spectral atlas can be a collection of spectra of different individual objects of a general type, showing the variety of spectra inherent to the type, or a collection of spectra from a single object that varies over time, showing the variations in the spectra.

In the game, the player traverses a procedurally generated environment without prescribed goals. The world's flora and fauna emit unique musical signatures, combinations of which cause dynamic shifts in audio based on the player's surroundings. The game began development in 2008. Key first conceived Proteus as an open-ended role-playing game akin to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion but, because of the work required for such a project, later redesigned it to be \\"nontraditional and nonviolent\\". Audio designer and composer David Kanaga joined the project in 2010. Versions for the PlayStation 3 video game console and Vita handheld console were developed by Curve Studios, whose team added new gameplay features to the Vita edition at Sony's request. Proteus won the prize for Best Audio at the 2011 IndieCade awards, and was a finalist for the 2012 Independent Games Festival's Nuovo Award. Following its release, critics praised the game, especially for its audio features, although some criticised the game's brevity and limited replayability. The game was involved in numerous discussions of video games as art, with some debating whether it could be considered a video game at all. Gameplay alt=Pixelated trees grow across green hills, with gravestones in the foreground. A dark tower is visible in the distance. In Proteus, the player explores an island from a first-person perspective. The island is drawn in a pixel art style and consists of hills, trees, structures, and animals such as frogs and rabbits; the layout of these elements is different each time the game is played. The focus of the game is on exploration rather than interaction, as there is no narrative and the player is given no instructions on how to proceed. Possible interactions are limited‚Äîfor example, animals may run away when the player comes too close. The game's soundtrack varies depending on the player's movements and location; it may fall silent when the player is at the top of a hill and become sonically dense as they travel down it. The soundtrack layers additional sounds and notes when the player nears objects and animals in the world. Many objects on the island are rendered as two dimensional sprites, contrasting with the three-dimensional landscape. When the game begins, the player is situated away from the island and must move across an ocean to reach it. Upon arrival, players are free to explore the whole island during the initial season of spring. During the night, the player can enter a designated area to advance time to the next season, exploring each until the end of winter, after which the game ends. The landscape changes with the season‚Äîfor example, trees shed their leaves in autumn. The player can capture a screenshot via a \\"save a postcard\\" feature, through which they can save and load their progress. In addition to the base gameplay elements, the PlayStation Vita version allows the player to directly affect the environment with the console's rear touch panel and to generate islands based on the current date and location in the real world. Development alt=Dense pixelated trees are colored red and orange. Leaves cover the ground. British game designer Ed Key began work on Proteus in 2008 during his evenings and weekends, though the game only neared its final form when David Kanaga joined development in 2010. Key originally envisioned the game as a procedural role-playing game in the same vein as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, in which the player would visit towns and complete quests. Realizing the extent of the work that would be needed for such a game, the developers decided to instead make something \\"nontraditional and nonviolent\\". The first technology developed for the game was the landscape generator, for which Key was inspired by walking in the village of Avebury, England. While he knew he wanted to make an exploration game, Proteus went through a variety of early iterations as Key explored different gameplay ideas. Key developed Proteus using a game engine written in the C# programming language. He found the game's visual style early in development, with the impressionistic tree design being one of the first he settled on. Art Deco and the work of Paul Nash have been cited as \\"big influences\\". After Kanaga joined the development team as its audio composer, the game's music and sound mechanics were refined through testing a wide range of ideas, including allowing players to create their own music within the game. This idea was ultimately cut because Key and Kanaga felt it would detract from the game's exploratory emphasis and instead turn it into a creative tool. During development, and after the game's release, the developers expressed interest in allowing player-created mods of the game; some have since been created by the community. Proteus was released on 30 January 2013 for Windows and OS X, and on 8 April of the same year for Linux. When pre-orders opened in 2012, an Artifact Edition was also available‚Äîa version which included a boxed copy of the game containing artwork, the soundtrack, and notes on the game's development. Key apologised when the Artifact Edition had not yet shipped at the end of its release year, and offered to refund customers upon request. The edition became available for purchase in July 2016. Around the time of the game's release, Curve Studios approached the developers to port the game for release on PlayStation 3 and Vita. These versions of the game use Curve Studio's own game engine. Sony requested that new features be added to the game, though Key said that the company never attempted to steer the direction of the development of these features. Key added location and date-based world generation and a method for changing the world's color using the Vita's rear touchpad. He stated that the location- and date-specific world generation feature may come to the game's other versions in the future. The PlayStation 3 and Vita versions were released on 29 October 2013. Reception =Pre-release= Before its full release, a beta version of Proteus was featured in a number of indie game festivals and received coverage from video game journalists. It won the 2011 IndieCade Award for Best Audio, and was shortlisted for the 2012 GameCity Prize, ultimately losing to Journey. Proteus was a finalist for the 2012 Independent Games Festival's Nuovo Award, a prize aimed at abstract and unconventional game development, and received honorable mentions in the Excellence in Audio and Seumas McNally Grand Prize categories. The game also won the Most Amazing Indie Game prize at the 2012 A MAZE. Indie Connect Festival and in the same year was featured in the Museum of Modern Art's \\"Common Senses\\" exhibit. In an article that discussed 2011's exploration games, Jim Rossignol of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described Proteus as \\"one of the most charming experiences\\" he had had in an indie game. An IGN preview found the game to be \\"delightfully intoxicating\\", unique, and intriguing, with the author replaying it multiple times. PC Gamer likewise responded positively, drawing particular attention to the game's changing soundtrack and the ways in which it coherently reacts to the player's movement. =Post-release= Proteus also received generally positive reviews following release, holding aggregate scores of 80% and 78% on Metacritic and GameRankings respectively for the Windows PC version. A Shacknews staff poll named Proteus the seventh best game of 2013, calling it \\"delightfully devoid of explanation\\". Reviewers praised the game's dynamic audio, commenting positively on how it accompanied them through the game. Patrick Hancock of Destructoid called the game's dynamic soundtrack its \\"biggest accomplishment\\", with the Hancock investigating every object he saw to uncover its musical contribution. IGN wrote \\"It's oddly captivating to just walk around and let [the sounds] wash over your surroundings\\", going on to say that investigating the sounds that each object and animal made was an enjoyable experience. PC Gamer described the audio as \\"a deeply satisfying emergent arrangement\\". A review in Edge however, though generally positive about the soundtrack, said that the music \\"never truly gets going\\", particularly because of the lack of drums in most seasons. The game's variety and replay value received mixed reactions. IGN's reviewer commented positively on the replayability, finding that the game provided a deeper experience on each subsequent playthrough. GameSpot, on the other hand, wrote that while some events and locations weren't guaranteed on each generated island, later portions of the game were less interesting due to their familiarity. Likewise, PC Gamer said that towards the end of the game they began to find it aimless and unstimulating, in particular because of the sparsity of animal life. The PlayStation 3 and Vita versions were also well received. Pocket Gamer gave a positive review, praising the audio and the extra features present in the Vita version such as PlayStation Trophies, which provided a reason to replay the game. They noted, however, that the game had some performance issues, particularly when moving the camera. Metros review described the game as a \\"fascinating interactive experience\\", particularly as a result of the music. PlayStation Official Magazine called the PlayStation 3 version \\"simple but wonderfully effective\\", commenting positively on the game's uniqueness and sense of wonder. Many players and journalists debated Proteus status as a video game, citing aspects such as the lack of goals or objectives. Some, including the game's developers, called it an anti-game, a description which was controversial. Ian Bogost proposed that the game was intentionally unconventional, arguing that \\"Proteus is a game about being an island instead of a game about being on one\\". IGN argued that Proteus does contain an action (walking) and a goal (proceeding through the seasons). Edges reviewer contended that the day/night cycle, changeable weather, and a player- triggered change of seasons qualified Proteus as a legitimate game. Key responded by pointing out that, while the product does include rudimentary game mechanics, interacting with them is optional and they do not usually provide feedback. However, Key went on to argue that \\"encouraging a strict definition of 'game' does nothing but foster conservatism and defensiveness\\".

This organization works to eliminate all types of violence against women and children, and to promote gender equality in Palestinian society. The vision of SAWA is clearly stated: \\"We aim to be the lead organization working against the prevailing culture of violence and promoting a culture of peace and security which serves human and community development in order to achieve a democratic society based on the principles of equality and social justice and on human rights.\\" SAWA works toward the goals of this vision in several basic ways. Intensively trained volunteers and staff work at the national call center hot line, which is free for callers. Counseling and support is given and if needed, medical and legal guidance as well. People in need of SAWA's services can also contact them through email. In addition to the main call center, SAWA has a mobile clinic which allows them to conduct outreach programs in different parts of the community and outlying areas. SAWA also provides training and technical assistance for law enforcement, school personnel and others in the areas of domestic violence and abuse. A special hotline for children was established by SAWA and became available for use in 2005. It is called the Palestinian Child Protection Helpline and is part of an international network of child help lines called Child Helpline International. SAWA also publishes and distributes printed material for the purpose of education and awareness of physical, psychological and sexual violence. These efforts toward outreach resulted in the major role SAWA had/has in assisting victims of the siege of Gaza in 2008/09. During the siege of Gaza, an emergency hotline was opened up for traumatized children and parents in Gaza. 200-250 calls per day were coming into SAWA's hotline. SAWA is also very active in combatting human trafficking and the prostitution of Palestinian girls and women. SAWA wrote an extensive report regarding this problem, called, \\"Trafficking and Forced Prostitution of Palestinian Women and Girls: Forms of Modern Day Slavery.\\" Sawa's helpline Sawa has several programs combatting Gender Based Violence (GBV). The core program is the helpline which operates in all of the Palestinian Territories. Callers can reach the helpline in various different ways.Otero, Eva (2012). SAWA Organization - Documenting Best Practices and Lessons Learned Sawa Organization. =Phone Counselling= 121 (West Bank and Gaza) or 1-800-500-121 (East Jerusalem) is a toll-free dial number that connects the caller with trained volunteers based in either Ramallah or Jerusalem. It provides support and assistance, primary social and psychological counseling for women, children, and men who have been exposed to various forms of violence and abuse. The call center is open from 09:00 ‚Äì 24:00 every day. =Chat Counselling= Sawa has a Facebook profile dedicated to chat counselling. The page provides a chat counselling program so that it is possible to communicate without talking on the phone, which is often used by residents outside of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The chat is open Monday and Friday from 09:00‚Äì17:00. =Face-to-Face= Sawa provides social and psychological counseling for people in all age groups to cope with different areas of life such as family, school, work, etc.. The center is operated by a team specialized in social and psychological counselling and provides confidential private sessions. The sessions are provided upon request from the caller through any of the media listed above. History In August 1998 a group of eight trained volunteers from the Jerusalem Rape Crisis Centre (JRCC) started operating a special helpline for Arab women. The helpline aimed to \\"provide a comprehensive response to the suffering of loval women subject to the trauma of sexual violence\\". Soon after the start up of the helpline it was decided - in agreement with JRCC - to establish an independently administered organisation in Palestine. For many years the helpline was based in the offices of JRCC, but in 2002 the first funding opportunity from the European Commission came and in April 2003 the organization rented their own office. Sawa conducted one yearly training course every year targeting 15 female participants. The training lasted three months (56 hours), and after completion, the volunteers became members of Sawa's volunteers' forum. In 2004 the need for a Child Protection Helpline was recognized and implemented. The Child Protection Helpline became a member of the Child Helpline International in 2005, and international network of child helplines from 143 countries. In 2008 during the war on Gaza, Sawa Organization expanded its helpline to cover 24 hours, 7 days a week. Sawa also expanded its helpline to cover 24/7 during the Israeli aggressions in 2010. From 2009 to 2011 Sawa went through large technological progress. They added an IP-phone system, which allowed the organization to receive and document more calls. It also allowed the development of an electronic database, the Caller Information Database. The Caller Information Database featured a statistical report function that could be used finding and targeting new problems in society. Sawa won the Arab Gulf Fund for UN Development in 2010 for its technological progress. In 2010 the training program was extended from 80 hours to 110 hours. The additional 30 hours of training consisted of practical training, listening to other counsellors, discussing the various approaches to calls. In 2014 Sawa's facilities were renovated and Sawa installed a solar power system and a generator, allowing the organization to run the helpline in situations of power cuts. Programs The main focus of Sawa Organization is to combat violence against women and children, as stated on their homepage. Besides, the organization runs various programs to combat other issues in the Palestinian society. =Helpline= The Helpline is the core of Sawa's work. It operates from 9‚Äì24 all days of the week. The counsellors are volunteers and go through training. The helpline is toll-free and supported by PalTel. The Helpline offers counselling by phone, chat, e-mail and face-to-face. =Educational programs= Sawa arranges various workshops which lasts from 1‚Äì3 months. The workshops focus on violence and harassment and uses dialogue as the primary approach. Some workshops include sport sessions in order to raise physical awareness. Sawa targets children through specific workshops. These workshops consist of puppets shows and discussion. The puppet shows are used as an indirect way of targeting problems such as sexual abuse to children. Sawa also trains professionals such as police officers, prosecutors, medical staff and the family protection unit of the Palestinian Police. They're trained on how to deal with victims of violence, how to deal with the perpetrator and intervention plans. Publications * Sawa Organization (2014), AIDS 2014 * Khsheiboun, D.

For civil administration it falls under Moshupa Sub District. History Kgomokasitwa gets its name from a hill which is located 6 km from the village. Occasionally there can be seen mist at the top of the hill indicating that it may be cold up there, hence the name Kgomokasitwa or loosely translated, Freezing Cow. ( Kgomo = cow) and (sitwa = freezing). The majority of people in the village are of Bangwaketse tribe even though it is multi tribal. Administration The local councilor is Mr. Sonny Phiri of Botswana Democratic Party. The village Chief or Headman of records is Mr. Sam Tshetlhe Radimpa from May 2013. Geography Kgomokasitwa is located in hilly area. To the central east there is lentswe la Kgomokasitwa (Kgomokasitwa Hill); to the right east there are Mmadithakwe Hill and Mokgorana Hill.

He was also elected as a member of the Yukon Territorial Council, and was the first president of the Yukon Order of Pioneers, Klondike Lodge.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 5. Early years Thomas O'Brien was born on a farm in Oro-Medonte Township, Ontario to James O'Brien and Catherine Elizabeth Stevens. He went to school in the vicinity until the age of 14.\\"Thos. W. O'Brien is Called to his Long Rest,\\" Dawson Daily News, August 25, 1916. He then moved to Toronto where he worked as a streetcar driver on the King Street line.Eric L. Johnson, Biographies: Thomas William O'Brien (Klondike History Library, 1993). O'Brien did not linger long in Ontario and headed west as a young man. He worked as a mail carrier on the Touchwood Hills route, via fort Qu‚ÄôAppelle and established a homestead in the area. When the unrest in the M√©tis community boiled over into Louis Riel's rebellion of 1885, O'Brien took advantage of the conflict. He set up a wagon team that was hired by General Middleton to support his troops.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 5. Drawn back to the transportation business, he next worked as a contractor. laying railway track around Winnipeg. O'Brien then decided to once again head west. He sold out his interest in the contracting outfit and moved to Seattle, where, hearing about Alaska gold, he set his sights northward. Time in the Yukon before the Klondike gold rush Thomas O'Brien reached the Alaska/Yukon area in 1886.Klondike History Library; Dawson City, Yukon, Canada; Census Returns for 1901 for the Unorganized Territories, Roll 1, T06555 NAC, Section F-1,Klondike City. The census reports that O'Brien has been in the Yukon Territory for 15 years, which puts his arrival in 1886. He tried his hand at prospecting, but this appears to have been a short-lived career. He prospected in the Fortymile region on the Beaver River with Chris Sonnickson, T. Evans, and ‚ÄòOld Herman‚Äô.Michael Gates, Gold at Forty Mile Creek: Early Days in the Yukon (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 52. However, like so many gold seekers, he found that wage work was more practical and found work in a saloon, where one contemporary described him as a \\"good-nurtured portly Irish saloon keeper\\".Brian D. Ross, Chronology of Information Available Regarding Thomas W. O'Brien and The Klondike (O'Brien) Brewery, (The Klondike History Library, 1989), 1886. O'Brien was ambitious. He soon saved up enough to start his own trading house with his partner Billie Moran in Fortymile and moved the outfit to Circle City.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 5. O'Brien soon expanded into the production side of the business and started brewing with a whiskey gang. They ran one of the 31 illegal liquor stills that the North-West Mounted Police recorded in the Yukon Valley in 1894.Michael Gates, Gold at Forty Mile Creek: Early Days in the Yukon (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 88. There is some indication that O'Brien may have married and had children with a First Nations woman during this period. O'Brien appears to have abandoned this family when he moved to the Klondike, when gold was famously discovered there.Eric L. Johnson, Biographies: Thomas William O'Brien (Klondike History Library, 1993). In the Klondike In 1896, gold was found in the Klondike region and O'Brien and Moran moved their trading house to Klondike City. This was a settlement that sat just south of Dawson City at the confluence of the Klondike and the Yukon rivers. At this time, Klondike City was government reserve land that was available by lease only. O'Brien, like many of the professional prospectors in the region, was able to get in before the flood of stampeders and get claims on the rich creeks of Bonanza and Eldorado. In 1896, he purchased of claim no.1 on Eldorado Creek from Jay Whipple in a very profitable acquisition.Record Book Placer Mining Eldorado Creek and Tributaries, Klondike History Library: Dawson City. From his many claims, and especially from claim no. 1, O'Brien pulled $250 000 of gold from the earth. With this cash, he greatly expanded his mercantile operations with Moran under the name Yukon Pioneer Trading Co. With his new found wealth, O'Brien diversified his company into numerous enterprises. O'Brien's mouthpiece in the Klondike was the Yukon Sun newspaper. O'Brien was the president of this paper and in its pages, advertisements for his businesses were common. A whole page is taken up by ads for his Yukon Pioneer Trading Co. and for notices that he was selling town lots for Fortymile. The Yukon Sun, September, 1900, pg. 47 There also appears an advertisement for an O'Brien Club, described as a ‚Äúgentlemen‚Äôs resort for prominent men,‚Äù which likely was connected to Thomas O'Brien. The Yukon Sun, September, 1900, pg. 48 His paper ran into legal trouble numerous times, with allegations that it stole other newspapers stories from the telegraph wires and printed them first.‚ÄúNow in General Contempt: Yukon Sun Stands Uncovered a Miserable Impostor, Feeds On Goods of Another,‚Äù Dawson Daily News, Wednesday December 27, 1899. O'Brien also had some business interests in Dawson City and was listed as the co- proprietor of the Monte Carlo Saloon.Brian D. Ross, Chronology of Information Available Regarding Thomas W. O'Brien and The Klondike (O'Brien) Brewery, (The Klondike History Library, 1989), 1901. Transportation endeavors in the Klondike Thomas O'Brien seemingly could not stay away from the business of transport and it was not long before he put his new found wealth into a related scheme. Transportation was a big issue in the Yukon. Dogs were the most reliable draft animal, as they could live off salmon, the most abundant food source in the region. Dog sled was used for winter travel and riverboats dominated summer transportation. A network of trails sprang up, connecting the claims and settlements, but many were in very rough shape. In 1898, Hill M. Henning took this as an opportunity and applied to the government for concessions needed to support the construction of a tramway.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 6. He cleared a roadway from Klondike City to Grand Forks.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 6-7. By October, all the bridges and grading were complete and he was ready to lay tracks. However, Henning's finances gave out and he was unable to pay the 150 laborers for their work. At this point, O'Brien stepped in with a bailout of $30 000 and became the controlling interest.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 7. He renamed the venture the Pioneer Tramway Company and having sunk significant money into the venture, he decided to drop the idea of a tramway. To get the quickest return on his investment, he turned the already graded tramway bed into a toll road instead.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 8. This turned out to be an unpopular move and many miners refused to pay the tolls. The legality of this change was challenged and, as the charter was specific to a tramway, he was brought to court and forced to stop collecting tolls. This debacle would earn O'Brien the nickname ‚Äòtramless Tom‚Äô.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 10. He was able to recoup his losses when he applied to the Yukon Council to recover his money. In 1902, he was awarded $35 000 from the government to cover his losses and interest on the original $30 000. The last payment was made in 1906. Undeterred by this failed first foray in the transportation business in the Klondike, O'Brien started a new transportation venture. In 1899, with the help of the influential new law firm McGiverin, Haydon, and Grieg, Ottawa accepted a charter for the Klondike Mines Railway.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 12. O'Brien was listed as president for the venture, which was granted the right to raise a million dollars for capitalization.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 13. The law firm was influential in O'Brien getting the charter where many other applicants had failed. Treadgold and Boyle had used the same firm when they obtained their mining concessions.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 11. Unfortunately, 1899 was not a fortunate year to begin a train company. Gold was found in Nome, Alaska that year and this signaled the end of the Klondike gold rush. The population of Dawson dropped precipitously as stampeders headed north, down the Yukon River to Nome. However, O'Brien pressed on, seemingly undeterred. He even diversified and started a shipping company with some Fortymile associates. The Dawson White Horse Navigation Company founded in 1900 would be a short-lived venture. More established shipping companies had too firm a grip on the market, and O'Brien's two boats were not competitive.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 15. As for the K.M.R., it was still raising capital and by 1901 was nothing more than a legal entity. Despite two failed business and one that was going nowhere in a hurry, O'Brien was a wealthy man. According to the 1901 census, he had $72 000 in real estate, $15 000 in claims, and $142 000 in personal property. He even owned a horse valued at $300.Klondike History Library; Dawson City, Yukon, Canada; Census Returns for 1901 for the Unorganized Territories, Roll 1, T06555 NAC, Section F-1, Klondike City. In the census, we also learn that he was married to Anna O'Brien. Anna was 15 years his junior: She was 25 to his 40. She was listed as having the occupation of housekeeper. This could either mean that she was a housewife or may suggest that O'Brien had married his housekeeper. At the time of the census, they had two children together: Charlie, aged 4, and Marguerite, aged 2. The family was all of Irish descent, although Thomas O'Brien was born in Canada and was Presbyterian, and Anna was born in the U.S.A. Anna had been 3 years in the Yukon at the time of the census. She was Roman Catholic and the children adopted their mother's religion. O'Brien's occupation was listed as merchant/employer.Klondike History Library; Dawson City, Yukon, Canada; Census Returns for 1901 for the Unorganized Territories, Roll 1, T06555 NAC, Section F-1, Klondike City. The K.M.R. continued to be a major project for O'Brien. However, right of way issues threatened to derail the project. Miners who had staked claims on the gold fields were not keen on tracks covering ground they wanted to dig up. These issues took years to resolve. Construction of the track did not begin until 1904 and the K.M.R. did not officially open for business until 1905.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 40. The same year that the long-awaited train service began also marked the opening of another O'Brien legacy. O'Brien's Brewing and Malting Co. (more commonly known as the Klondike Brewery) opened in 1904. Due to the simultaneous launching of these two endeavors, the first freight carried by the K.M.R. was a load of beer from the brewery in Klondike City, delivered down the tracks on Front Street to Dawson City.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 13. When it was chartered, the K.M.R. was expected to make its revenue by passenger service, but the shrinking population of Dawson could not support this.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 19. The main contract the company fulfilled was the delivery of cord wood, which powered the steam thawing of permafrost to aid the miners. The first profits made by the company did not come until K.M.R. received a contract to haul the first dredges up to the creeks.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 92. Cord wood contracts kept the company running, but when stockpiles developed up on Bonanza, the K.M.R. did not have enough business to open for the 1914 season. Hopes remained of reopening within a few years but in, 1920 cold drip thawing which did not require large quantities of cord wood to melt the permafrost was pioneered, and any future prospects for the company were gone.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 101. O'Brien's Brewing and Malting Co. Unlike O'Brien's foray into trains, his Klondike Brewery was a massive success. The brewery produced steam beer. Steam beer was made through a method pioneered in California, which was desirable because it did not need ice for production.Brian D. Ross, Chronology of Information Available Regarding Thomas W. O'Brien and The Klondike (O'Brien) Brewery, (The Klondike History Library, 1989), 1904. Ironically, this ice free brewing process became the method of choice in the Yukon. Likely, this method was popular because, due to the large number of Americans and the relatively proximity to California, steam beer was a familiar beverage to many. In 1904, the brewery was selling lager beer at $21 (the value of an ounce of gold at the time) per barrel, $18 per keg, or $3.50 a dozen.Dawson Daily News, Friday September 30, 1904. O'Brien was not financially set back too badly by the failure of the K.M.R. as the success of his brewery largely compensated for his losses. In 1905, Thomas O'Brien again ran for a seat on the Yukon territorial council. O'Brien and his supporters were referred to as the ‚Äústeambeers‚Äù or ‚ÄúSteams‚Äù. O'Brien won this election and sat on council from 1905 to 1906.Brian D. Ross, Chronology of Information Available Regarding Thomas W. O'Brien and The Klondike (O'Brien) Brewery, (The Klondike History Library, 1989), 1905. The brewery only lasted until 1919, when prohibition came to the Yukon.Brian D. Ross, Chronology of Information Available Regarding Thomas W. O'Brien and The Klondike (O'Brien) Brewery, (The Klondike History Library, 1989), 1919. An advertisement for O'Brien's brewery ran in the Dawson Daily News in 1913. ‚ÄúHear the doctor ‚Äì So much alcohol is necessary for digestion ‚Äì it helps to assimilate, stimulate digestion, and insures a healthy tone to the stomach ‚Äì Beer ‚Äì contains 3 per cent ‚Äì no more, no less.\\" Dawson Daily News, December 9, 1913. Political career Despite the nickname ‚ÄòTramless Tom‚Äô and the accusations against his paper, O'Brien remained a popular man. The Yukon Order of Pioneers was a prominent fraternal order, so his election to the presidency of the order was indicative to his status. Furthermore, in 1900, he was petitioned to run for the Yukon Council. He ran as a liberal in support of the Laurier government and was accused of bribing The Nugget newspaper to support him. O'Brien received 875 votes in the contest, while Wilson carried the day with 1417 votes.Brian D. Ross, Chronology of Information Available Regarding Thomas W. O'Brien and The Klondike (O'Brien) Brewery, (The Klondike History Library, 1989), 1900. O'Brien served as the president of the Yukon Liberal Association, but switched to support the Conservatives a few years later.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 28. The Yukon Sun newspaper ran an article in 1902 with a petition showing over hundred names supposedly collected over two hours.The Yukon Sun, December 13, 1902 ‚ÄúThey want O'Brien: Candidate for Yukon Council‚Äù During the 1904 election campaign, O'Brien was respected by the electorate due to the fact that he, unlike so many who made their fortunes during the gold rush, had stayed and continued to invest in the community. He was also an excellent public speaker and his speeches were reported as being the best presented during the campaign.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 140. Final years In 1913, a gold discovery was made on a new creek. The creek was named O'Brien Creek as O'Brien was the man who grubstaked the prospector, by giving him supplies and equipment on credit.R. C. Coutts, Yukon Places and Names (Whitehorse: Moose Creek Publishing PR Services Ltd, 1980), 215 With the Klondike in decline, O'Brien sought to use this new discovery to maintain his wealth. He widely publicized his new find and built a store and a hotel in the area of the new gold fields.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 140. O'Brien would not live much longer to enjoy the fruits of this latest scheme. Despite his wealth, O'Brien was not a healthy man. Perhaps the years of working with a whiskey gang and running a brewery had made him a little too familiar with drink. He died at the age of 57 on August 24, 1916, of cirrhosis of the liver.O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs tombstone in the 8th avenue Yukon Order of Pioneers graveyard His funeral was the biggest that Dawson had ever seen. According to the register at the 8th avenue cemetery, the whole town got a half hour off work to come to the funeral. As for his family, Thomas‚Äô son, Charles Thomas O'Brien, lost his life in the First World War. His name can be read on the First World War memorial in Dawson City, together with the name of his brother, James Jonathan who also fought but survived. His daughter, Margaret Mary, studied at the University of California, Berkeley, never married, and died in San Francisco in 1990. His widowed wife Anna remarried after his death. Anna died in 1927 in Riverside, California.Eric L. Johnson, The Bonanza Narrow Gauge Railway: The story of the Klondike Mines Railway (Vancouver: Rusty Spike Publishing, 1997), 141..

The program which made its first presentation in September 2005 to three recipients who had sustained injuries in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), was conceived and implemented with the assistance of Gen. Ralph \\"Ed\\" Eberhart, USAF (Ret), President of the Armed Forces Benefits Association. Following its first presentation, the Segs4Vets program began the process of seeking a waiver which would allow the presentation of Segway's to active-duty military personnel who had been severely injured and permanently disabled while serving in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). In August 2006, the Segs4Vets program became the only recipient of a blanket waiver from the United States military allowing a donation in excess of $1000 to active-duty military personnel. The Segs4Vets program provides successful candidates with a universally designed mobility device which aims to draw attention away from their disability. The Segway is a tool that aims to help many of the mobility issues facing our disabled veterans, in a manner which is psychologically uplifting and physically beneficial. Since 2005, the organization has provided over 1200 Segways to wounded veterans. Severely Injured Marines and Sailors Initiative (SIMS) In May 2006, Colonel William J. O'Brien, USMC (Ret), the Director of the Department of the Navy's Severely Injured Marines and Sailors Initiative (SIMS), a pilot program enacted under Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy H.C. Barney Barnum, to facilitate the full integration of injured service members into the Marine Corps and Navy, or to assist in their transition into the private sector, became aware of the Segs4Vets program. In July 2006, the small staff of the SIMS program, Colonel O'Brien, HMC Christine Jensen, USN, and Joseph Wade began collaborating with the Segs4Vets program to encourage it to serve more OEF & OIF severely injured. The results of this collaboration resulted in the first major Segs4Vets presentation ceremony on December 7, 2006 during a SIMS luncheon at the Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia. In May 2007, the SIMS program concluded its work having identified gaps in coverage for the severely injured and recommended solutions for those deficiencies. However, that first Segs4Vets presentation ceremony set a standard for future Segs4Vets ceremonies held twice annually in Washington DC, San Antonio, TX and San Diego, CA. Colonel O'Brien, HMC Jensen, Joe Wade, and now retired Secretary Barnum continue to play an active role in the Segs4Vets program.

The film stars Mari Blanchard, Jack Kelly, and Albert Dekker and was theatrically released by 20th Century Fox on a double bill with Regal's Kronos. She Devil is based on the science fiction short story \\"The Adaptive Ultimate\\" by Stanley G. Weinbaum. Plot Dr. Dan Scott has developed a serum that cures the ills of animals, although it did alter the color of a leopard used in one experiment. Eager to try it on a human being, despite his mentor Dr. Richard Bach's many concerns, Scott finds a consenting patient in Kyra Zelas, a woman with a meek personality who is dying of tuberculosis. The serum seems to cure her instantly. It also dramatically affects her personality. Kyra shows a flash of temper, then jumps out of a car and runs into a shop, where she steals a dress then disguises her identity by willing her hair color to change from brunette to blonde. Scott falls in love with her. At a party, however, Kyra seduces a guest, Barton Kendall. When his wife Evelyn objects, Kyra disguises herself again and murders her. Then she marries Kendall, but behaves monstrously toward him. The doctors use a ploy that leaves Kyra in an unconscious state, then perform surgery to reverse the serum's effect, which also restores Kyra's terminal disease. Cast * Mari Blanchard as Kyra Zelas * Jack Kelly as Dr. Dan Scott * Albert Dekker as Dr. Richard Bach * John Archer as Barton Kendall * Fay Baker as Evelyn Kendall * Blossom Rock as Hannah, the housekeeper * Paul Cavanagh as Sugar Daddy * George Baxter as Store Manager * Helen Jay as Blond Nurse * Joan Bradshaw as Redhead * X Brands as First Doctor * Tod Griffin as Intern Reception =Critical response= Film critic Glenn Erickson discussed the production in his review of the film, \\"The B&W; 'Regalscope' format gives this modest production a handsome look, along with Kurt Neumann's competent if not stylish direction. Cameraman Karl Struss (of Murnau's Sunrise) slightly over-lights Kyra in the party scene to make her hair seem to glow, a subtle effect for sure. The hair-color changing is a filter trick, an invention Struss first used back in the silent era. A spectacular car crash murder scene is an RKO stock shot lifted from the 1952 Otto Preminger noir Angel Face and cropped for the 'scope format. It still looks frightening. Suggesting an undeveloped noir angle, a 'haunting' portrait of Kyra becomes the focus of Dan's obsession. It's supposed to be the work of an Italian master, but looks more like a Paint By Numbers atrocity.\\"Erickson, Glenn. DVD Savant, film/DVD review, March 1, 2013. Accessed: July 22, 2013.

Sep√∫lveda (born February 11, 1964) is an American attorney and politician who serves as the New York State Senator from the 32nd Senate District in the Bronx, New York. Early life and education Sep√∫lveda was born in Brooklyn, New York, and graduated from Hofstra University, in Hempstead, New York, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in the natural sciences in 1988. Sep√∫lveda later attended the Maurice A. Deane School of Law at Hofstra on a full scholarship, obtaining his law degree in 1991. Career In 2010, Sep√∫lveda made his first run for public office, losing a bid for the New York State Assembly to incumbent Peter M. Rivera in the Democratic primary. Two years later, Rivera retired and Sep√∫lveda was elected as his successor. He would be re-elected twice more. Sep√∫lveda has a history of endorsing populist progressive candidates. Sep√∫lveda was the first member of the Assembly to endorse future New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in the 2013 New York City Mayoral primary elections as well as the first Assembly member to endorse de Blasio in his 2017 reelection campaign. However, in 2018, Sep√∫lveda supported incumbent state senator Martin Malave Dilan against a primary challenge from Julia Salazar, a community organizer endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America, and endorsed former Independent Democratic Conference leader Jeffrey D. Klein against challenger Alessandra Biaggi. He was one of the few New York State politicians to back Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Primary over former New York State Senator Hillary Clinton. He endorsed Sanders again for the 2020 Primary. =New York State Assembly= While in the Assembly from 2013 to 2018, Sep√∫lveda served on the Assembly's Committees on Aging, Agriculture, Banks, Correction, Mental Hygiene, and Housing. Sep√∫lveda also serves as the chair of the Subcommittee on Transitional Services, dealing with post-incarceration issues. = New York State Senate = In 2017, longtime Senator Rub√©n D√≠az Sr. opted to run for the New York City Council, and won. A special election was announced to replace him, and Sep√∫lveda announced his candidacy on December 18, 2017. Sep√∫lveda would easily win the endorsement of the county Democratic party, and in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, easily won the special election. Sep√∫lveda was elected to a full term in 2018 unopposed. In the Senate, he is serving as Chairman of the Crime Victims, Crime and Correction Committee. Sepulveda sponsored the New York State Driver's License Access and Privacy Act, also known as the \\"Green Light\\" bill.

The building's pyramidal roof is supported by columns along the pavilion's perimeter; a triangular truss atop the columns acts as the pavilion's superstructure. A vent at the top of the roof is supported by a Howe truss. A stage and orchestra pit are located inside the pavilion, though the majority of the space inside the pavilion is open, allowing a variety of activities to be held there. The Hastings chapter of the Chautauqua movement held independent assemblies at the pavilion until 1913, when it merged with the national movement. Hastings continued to host Chautauqua events until the 1920s, when the movement declined due to the rise of film and radio.

Founded in 1933 as the Cannery Workers and Farm Laborers Union, Local 18257 of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), it represented Alaska salmon cannery workers and farm workers. In 1937, the union became Cannery Workers and Farm Laborers Union, Local 7 of the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America. In 1945, Local 7 became affiliated with the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers. In 1951 the union became Local 37 of International Longshore and Warehouse Union, and around 1987 it became Region 37 of IBU/ILWU. The membership historically was Filipino American cannery workers. History =Founding= The Cannery Workers' and Farm Laborers' Union was organized June 19, 1933 in Seattle to represent the primarily Filipino-American laborers who worked in the Alaska salmon canneries. Filipino Alaskeros first appeared in the canneries around 1911. In the 1920s as exclusionary immigration laws went into effect, they replaced the Japanese, who had replaced the Chinese in the canneries. Workers were recruited through labor contractors who were paid to provide a work crew for the summer canning season. The contractor paid workers wages and other expenses. This system led to many abuses and harsh working conditions from which grew the movement toward unionization. Attempts to unionize in the salmon canneries was neither new, nor unique to the Filipinos, as during 1867 and again in 1877, the Chinese employees in the canneries that preceded them had also attempted to organize and strike for better job stability and wages, but with little to no improvement to their working conditions.

Prior to 1936, the CWFLU also had to compete with other unions such as the Fishermen and Cannery Workers' Industrial Union (FCWIU), a union sponsored by the Trade Union Unity League as a rival and in response to the CWFLU's slow approach to combating the issue of contracting, but the FCWIU was dissolved in 1935.

He testified that, along with issues of drug and alcohol use, gambling and violation of contracts such as starting work times, there was the issue of sexual perversions white homosexual boys, some as young as 14, who were recruited and smuggled into Bristol Bay, and that typically older homosexual transvestites were hired as prostitutes for cannery workers.

On the night of December 1, 1936 at the Gyokku Ken Caf√©, a Japanese restaurant which was a usual location for union meetings, Dunyungan and union secretary Aurelio Simon were shot and killed by the nephew of a labor contractor, Placidio Patron, who also died the same night.Friday, 1994. p. 146. After Duyungan's death, the union was now more determined to end the contract labor system, and accomplished this after signing an agreement in April 1937 with the salmon canners, outlawing labor agents and labor contractors in the industry. Masson, Jack, and Donald Guimary. ‚ÄúAsian Labor Contractors in the Alaskan Canned Salmon Industry.‚Äù Labor History 22, no. 3 (Summer 1981): 377. doi: 10.1080/00236568108584625. Also, despite this setback the union was able to win a hiring hall. In November 1937, the union voted Ireneo R. Cabatit as the new President, who worked closely alongside Conrad Espe, a Norwegian American labor organizer who also took a leading role in the union, being considered one of the best leading members of the union. Under Cabatit and Espe, the CWFLU made numerous attempts to organize farm workers during the winter months, and the two men also focused on promoting interracial cooperation and ending discrimination in the community. Farm Division organizers attempted to organize workers in Yakima, Kent, Everett, Bainbridge Island and the White River area, but were often met with harsh opposition from local officials and vigilantes. =AFL conflict= Local 18257 came into conflict with the AFL, in 1937 when the parent body, attempting to separate the union along racial lines, recognized a Japanese local organized by Clarence Arai. Local 18257 successfully retained negotiation rights and dispatched its workers in 1937 despite pickets set up by the rival group. Bitterness toward the AFL resulted from the incidents and led to a November 4 vote by the Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco locals to affiliate with the newly formed United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America-CIO (UCAPAWA). In Seattle, Local 18257 became UCAPAWA, Local 7 and in San Francisco and Portland Cannery Workers unions also joined UCAPAWA Opponents of re-affiliation, led by John Ayamo and called the \\"defeated candidates party,\\" received the old 18257 charter and challenged Local 7 for the right to represent cannery workers. On May 4, 1938 the issue was settled in Local 7's favor in a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) supervised election. The industry representative, Canned Salmon Industry Inc., subsequently recognized the victorious union. Ayamo later formed another AFL union, the Alaska Fish Cannery Workers, under the jurisdiction of the Seafarers International Union. In 1937 also, the CWFLU merged with a rival, the Filipino Protective Association. I.R. Cabatit was president of the union during the period of rivalry with the AFL. When he was succeeded by Trinidad Rojo in 1939, the CWFLU, Local 7 was on the verge of bankruptcy. It was discovered that officers had been selling membership cards, misappropriating funds and neglecting their duties. Rojo cut expenses and returned the union to a sound financial footing.

He competed in ten races, but only scored four points, resulting in him finishing 26th overall. In addition to the TC2000, he also entered the only round of the South American Super Touring Car Championship, taking both the victory and the fastest lap in an Alfa Romeo 156 TS, entered by Quadrifoglio Corse. 2002 saw him remain in the TC 2000 with CL Racing along with his father, and this time the younger L√≥pez took 18th in the championship, with 13 points, having entered ten events.

The team were renamed to \\"Exakt Racing\\" for the next event at Jarama, and won the first race of the event. Two further wins followed, plus a second place. The season finale, held at Algarve, was a shared event between the Spanish GT Championship and the International GT Open; the team were the fastest Spanish GT Championship in the first race, and finished fifth overall, and finished tenth overall in the second race, third of all the Spanish GT entries. L√≥pez finished the Spanish GT season classified third in the Super GT category, with 77 points. He also competed in the Master de Pilotos de la Rep√∫blica Argentina karting event, taking sixth, as well as entering an invitational Top Race V6 event, where he finished 15th in a Ford Mondeo. L√≥pez remained in the Spanish GT Championship with Aurora Racing Team in 2010, once more being partnered by Manuel Gi√£o. This time, the opening round of the season, held at Valencia, was also the opening round of the International GT Open; the team finished eighth overall in race one (third of the Spanish GT entries), before finishing third overall in race two, and fastest of all the Spanish GT entries. Following this event, he and GiƒÉo finished all bar one event in the top four overall ‚Äì a tenth-place finish at Estoril being the only exception; and this equated to a third in class - taking six outright wins in the nine races.

Snyder, known as Jeff Snyder (January 19, 1859 - October 18, 1951), was a lawyer and politician from the Mississippi River delta country of northeastern Louisiana. Snyder became a virtual political boss of Madison, Tensas, and East Carroll parishes; his leadership was rarely challenged, and politicians courted his endorsements. Background Snyder and his older brother, Robert H. Snyder, were born in St. Joseph, the Tensas Parish seat of government. Robert \\"Bob\\" Snyder served as Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana from 1896 to 1900 and as Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1904 until his death in office late in 1905. Though Bob Snyder had early formal education and attained higher office in a shorter life span than his younger brother, Jeff Snyder, was a political figure for more than forty-five years. Largely self-educated, he worked in his younger years as a toll collector at a bridge, as a clerk in a store, and as a Tensas Parish deputy sheriff. In 1879, Snyder was part of a posse that chased the Jesse James gang, whose members robbed two stores in far western Mississippi, at Washington in Adams County and Fayette in Jefferson County. The gang absconded with $2,000 cash in the second robbery and took shelter in abandoned cabins on the Kemp Plantation south of St. Joseph. With deputy Snyder included, the posse attacked and killed two of the outlaws but failed to capture the entire gang. Jesse James would live another three years until his demise in, coincidentally, another St. Joseph in northwestern Missouri. Early career Several years after the end of Reconstruction, Snyder relocated forty miles north to Tallulah, the seat of government in Madison Parish. He served on the powerful Fifth District Levee Board, particularly important to his area because of periodic river flooding, the worst in his lifetime having been in 1927.Frederick W. Williamson and George T. Goodman, eds. Eastern Louisiana: A History of the Watershed of the Ouachita River and the Florida Parishes, 3 vols. Monroe: Historical Record Association, 1939, pp. 569-571 From 1888 to 1891, Snyder revived the country newspaper, The Madison Journal, which had ceased publication in 1883. He was the publisher for three years. From 1892 to 1893, he was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for Madison Parish. He resigned from the legislature a year into his term to become a United States Navy officer in the customhouse in New Orleans. The appointment came during the second administration of U.S. President Grover Cleveland through the intervention of U.S. Representative Charles J. Boatner of Louisiana's 5th congressional district. While in New Orleans, Snyder obtained a law degree from Tulane University Law School. He also supported his widowed mother and a sister, Kate, later Kate Watson, who moved with him to New Orleans. Snyder may have remained in New Orleans beyond 1897 had not his position been ended with the arrival of the Republican President William McKinley. Settling in Tallulah Snyder returned to Tallulah and was a delegate to both the 1898 and the 1921 state constitutional conventions held in Baton Rouge. In the 1921 convention he was the first vice president. From 1904 until 1948, he was the district attorney for the 6th Judicial District based in Madison Parish. Frank Voelker Sr., of Lake Providence in East Carroll Parish, like Snyder another supporter of the planter interests served from 1936 until his death in 1963 as a judge on that same court. In May 1923, Snyder spoke before a rally at the courthouse in St. Joseph assembled in defense of the revival of the Ku Klux Klan. After Snyder's remarks, the Reverend William McDougall of Winnsboro, hailed the KKK for its \\"principles of Christianity and Americanism.\\"One Proud Princes, p. 94 Oliver Watson, a candidate for clerk of court, took to the stage to denounce the Klan as divisive and unnecessary because of the restraint long exercised in race relations within Tensas Parish. Watson was subsequently defeated in the election, a point not lost on the observant Snyder.Once Proud Princes, p. 95 Relationship with Huey Long In 1927, Snyder stunned his associates when he endorsed Huey P. Long Jr., for governor in the 1928 primary race against U.S. Representative Riley J. Wilson, the favorite of the planter interests, and the third candidate, sitting Governor Oramel H. Simpson. The decision was surprising because Snyder had enjoyed a close relationship in the past with Long's most vehement critic, former Governor Jared Y. Sanders Sr.\\"Ye Gods, Can It Be?,\\" Tensas Gazette, July 29, 1927 Snyder backed Long because he believed that Long, who had lost the 1924 primary race, would defeat Wilson, and Snyder wanted a good relationship with the new governor over whom he expected to exert much influence on behalf of delta interests. He tried unsuccessfully to get Long to visit his hunting lodge on Lake Bruin.Once Proud Princes, pp. 194-195 The Tensas Gazette questioned Snyder's backing of Long because the district attorney had for \\"practically his whole life-time been hand in glove with the New Orleans Ring\\".Once Proud Princes, p. 195 When Snyder turned aside his old friend Sanders, the Tensas Gazette said that the DA had \\"turned to other gods\\" and now worshipped at \\"another shrine.\\" After the defection, Sanders wrote Snyder that the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 had not only devastated delta lands but also \\"affected your mind.\\"One Proud Princes, p. 195 By the spring of 1930, Snyder expressed regret for his support of Long, who he believed had agitated class warfare and undermined the state constitution which Snyder had helped to write.\\"Jeff Snyder Apologizes for Backing Long,\\" Tensas Gazette, May 16, 1930 Long shut out most delta interests in his administration. Again showing his political flexibility, Long vowed to \\"do all in my power to make amends for that course\\".Once Proud Princes, pp. 203 Long, however, was on another roll; soon he would unseat U.S. Senator Joseph E. Ransdell of Lake Providence, the highest ranking of all delta political advocates. That action left the anti-Long advocates in a sense of bewilderment. Many tried to make peace with the Long forces to survive politically.Once Proud Princes, p. 200 Delayed retirement Snyder could have retired with full pay on his 80th birthday by virtue of his more than 30 years service as a district attorney. The retirement was permissible through a state constitutional amendment pushed by Governor Richard Leche and approved by voters in 1937. The amendment was humorously called the \\"Amendment for the Retirement of Jeff B. Snyder\\" in honor of the long-serving district attorney, held in such esteem that he was usually called \\"Judge Snyder\\" though he was never a judge. However, Snyder continued to serve as DA until 1948; he postponed retirement by nine years under the constitutional amendment approved for his benefit.\\"Jeff B. Snyder Succumbs Thursday At Vicksburg Hospital: Body of Prominent Figure Lay In State at Tallulah Courthouse Thursday\\", Madison Journal, October 19, 1951, p. 1 Political insider Snyder was active in the Louisiana Democratic State Central Committee. He was a delegate to both the 1916 and 1924 Democratic National Conventions, which nominated Woodrow Wilson for a second term and John W. Davis, respectively, the latter to run against Calvin Coolidge. For many years, Snyder maintained a hunting lodge on Lake Bruin near St. Joseph, where he hosted guests, all men, ranging from the governor to a U.S. senator, an architect, a surgeon, a publisher, the local bootlegger, and African Americans of various occupations. Snyder was known as one of the most skilled raconteurs‚Äîhis orations could leave his guests spellbound. Guests included the Kentucky humorist Irvin S. Cobb and the journalist Bob Davis, the columnist who penned \\"Bob Davis Recalls\\" for the Joseph Pulitzer newspaper chain. On April 6, 1943, Snyder attended the Tensas Parish centennial ceremony held in St. Joseph, where he and Sheriff Elliot D. Coleman were among the most acclaimed speakers. Snyder, then eight-four, recalled with nostalgia the time when there were \\"no levees, no bridges, ferries nor roads, but the richest soil in the world, more fertile than the Valley of the Nile River. It was a hunter's paradise.\\" Death Snyder died at ninety-one of a lingering illness in a hospital in Vicksburg, Mississippi. His body lay in state in the Madison Parish Courthouse, with funeral in the Trinity Episcopal Church in Tallulah. He is interred at Silver Cross Cemetery in Tallulah. The list of honorary pallbearers reads like a \\"Who's Who\\" of state and delta politicians: Russell B. Long, Allen J. Ellender, John B. Fournet, Otto Passman, Benjamin C. Dawkins Sr., Joseph E.

Life Marie de Miramion was the daughter of Jacques Bonneau, seigneur de Rubelles, conseiller et secretaire du roi. Her mother died when Marie was nine years old. Left a widower with five small children, her father deemed it prudent to join the household of his brother, M. de Bonneau, Seigneur of Plessis and Valmar. There she came to love dancing and the theatre. Marie is described as a beautiful young woman, with an alabaster complexion, chestnut hair, and dark blue eyes. Upon the death of her father, when she was fifteen, her aunt and uncle took on the responsibility of arranging an appropriate marriage. On 27 April 1645 she married twenty-seven-year-old Jean-Jacques de Beauharnais, seigneur de Miramion, conseiller du roi en sa cour du Parlement de Paris, who later fell ill of a fever and died the same year. They had one child, a daughter also named Marie. Chateau de Launay Villiers-le-Mahieu Entrance Two years later Marie contracted smallpox but recovered. Her young daughter suffered from a serious chest ailment. Fearing the loss of her only child, Marie vowed that if the child recovered, she would make a pilgrimage to the Chapel of St. Valerian. The following August, Marie, accompanied by her mother-in-law and attendants, were waylaid en route by individuals in the employ of a would-be suitor. Her traveling companions were left in the woods and the coach driven post haste to the fortress Chateau de Launay, owned by Count Roger de Bussy- Rabutin, a notorious libertine. But Bussy-Rabutin was forced to free her when Marie refused to take either food or water until released. He had also received word that the Queen Regent of France, upon learning that a lady of the court had been abducted by one of the court nobles, had ordered an armed regiment of soldiers to rescue her. Nor did he have the support of his men, who had been under the impression that the abduction had been a ruse staged for the benefit of the lady's family. Her daughter was put to board at the convent of the Visitation, on the Rue de St. Antoine, where Marie also lived for part of the year. It was not unusual at that time, for ladies to retire for weeks or even months to religious houses to practice prayer and enjoy a period of pious solitude. Her family saw this as a precaution against any second attempt on the part of Bussy-Rabutin. In 1649, Marie made a vow of chastity following a retreat at the motherhouse of the Filles de la Charite and took up the life of a lay devote. She formed a group of girls to teach school and care for the sick in her parish and later combined them with another group of devotes under the name of the \\"Filles de Sainte-Genevieve\\". In addition, she founded an orphanage; a refuge for endangered girls (later absorbed into the Hopital General); and a retreat house. After 1678, she served as a lay superior of the Filles de la Providence. She is remembered as a founder of one of the teaching orders.

She was the paternal grandmother of Fredrika Bremer. After the death of her husband Jacob Bremer in 1785, at the age of 39, she took over his businesses and ships in √Öbo (now Turku, Finland). She successfully managed his business empire over 13 years and was one of the richest Finnish women of her time. Life Salonius was the daughter of the high court judge Eric Gustaf Salonius (d. 1748) and Hedvig Magdalena Wittfooth (d. 1752), and married at the age of 21, the recently widowed merchant Jacob Bremer on 18 April 1767. He was 35 years her senior and had five children, most of them older than Ulrika. Jacob Bremer was the richest business person in Finland and the biggest ship owner in √Öbo. He was also a partner or shareholder in the √Öbo sugar mill, the town's two tobacco factories, the J√§rvenoja paper mill, the √Övik glass factory, the Kuppis brick works, the Koski and Luvia sawmills, the Swedish East India Company, and several smaller businesses, as well as the owner or landlord of various manors, farms, and inns. =Business activity= At the death of her spouse in 1785, Ulrika Fredrika Bremer inherited her husband's guild membership and the right to manage his business empire in her own right. Although she was helped by her eldest two stepsons Isac Bremer (1741‚Äì1774) and Joseph Bremer (1743‚Äì1814) and her own son Carl Fredrik Bremer (1770‚Äì1830), the eldest Isac and the youngest Carl suffered from mental instability and lack of business acumen and she took it upon herself to manage the family holdings. Under her management, the Bremer house maintained a dominant place in Finnish business life, and she left a great fortune after her death. During her lifetime, she was able to donate large sums to charity: she financed a scholarship to √Öbo University, a free bed place at the hospital, and two large donations to the poor widows and orphans of both the Finnish and the Swedish parishes of √Öbo. Her wealth made her a public figure in √Öbo. In 1796, there were rumours that the Governor of √Öbo wished to sell his office, and that Bremer considered buying it for her son-in-law; and then, the rumour claimed that she had reconsidered because she considered her son-in-law unfit for the position.Bladh, Christine, Hennes snilles styrka: kvinnliga grosshandlare i Stockholm och √Öbo 1750‚Äì1820, S√∂dert√∂rns h√∂gskola, Huddinge, 2018 http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:sh:diva-34733 She also had a daughter Agata (Agathe) Bremer (1774‚Äî1810), who married two noblemen, first in 1790 to Adolf Ludvig Carleson and then in 1798 to Fabian Wrede af Elim√§. Her stepson Joseph Bremer became an iron manufacturer, when he acquired Teijo ironworks in his possession in 1794, after marrying the sole heiress of Teijo ironworks, Anna Charlotta Kijk (1750‚Äî1800) in the late 1770s. Following her death 1798, her son Carl (the father of writer Fredrika Bremer sold all her businesses and moved to Sweden in 1804. The last business to be sold was √Övik glass factory in 1806.

He is the immigrant ancestor to an astonishing number of notable Americans. Biography John Cogswell, born in Westbury Leigh, Wiltshire, England, was a successful merchant in London, England before migrating to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635. Cogswell married Elizabeth, the daughter of Rev. William Thompson, vicar of Westbury in 1615. Twenty years later, in 1635, Cogswell and his family embarked on the unlucky ship, the Angel Gabriel, for Massachusetts. However, the ship crashed off of the coast of Maine during the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635. Cogswell salvaged most of what he lost from the wreck and headed south for Boston, Massachusetts before settling in Ipswich. In Ipswich, Cogswell was granted 300 acres of land now known as Cogswell's Grant and he received freeman status to allow him to run for public office. He eventually became a deputy to the General Court for Ipswich, in addition to fulfilling functions for the town. Cogswell died in 1669. He was honored with a five-mile long funeral procession followed by a service conducted by Rev. William Hubbard. The historian Darrett B. Rutman states that Cogswell's will is \\"exceptional in providing for the formal education of a daughter.\\" Although he was a man of reputation in his time, his greatest legacy for posterity is surviving the great hurricane and leaving many celebrated descendants. Descendants John Cogswell and Elizabeth Thompson had many children; however, the following children left notable descendants: William Cogswell (1619-1696). He married Susannah Hawkes. He and his son, Jonathan, signed a petition to protect John Proctor and his wife Elizabeth during the Salem witch trials. An influential citizen of Ipswich, he acquired the Rev. John Wise to be the first pastor of Chebacco Parish. John Cogswell Jr (1622-1653). He died of a snake bite on a return voyage from London, a year after his wife, Elizabeth Thoth's (of England) death. He left behind three children, John, Samuel and Elizabeth Cogswell - the youngest but a year old. Hannah Cogswell (1626-1704). She married Deacon Cornelius Waldo. Abigail Cogswell (1641-1728). She married Thomas Clarke. Sarah Cogswell (1645-1692). She married Simon Tuttle.

The taxonomy of the genus is not clear. Species are separated from those of other genera by the sometimes inconsistent comparison of questionable characters, such as the distribution of minute hairs. There is also little agreement on how to divide the group into subgenera. Former subgenera such as Xanthogaleruca are treated as separate genera by some authors, but not accepted as such by others. A definition of the genus used by some authors includes characters such as a hairy pronotum and elytra, gena (the spaces below the eyes) longer than the eyes themselves, and a labrum with a line of hairy pores.Bezdƒõk, J.

This ideological stance may take the form of ascribing to Asia significance or supremacy at the cost of the rest of the world.Asiacentrism and Asian American Studies? - Retrieved 23 July 2013. Thomas Wier - Dept. of Linguistics The concept arose in the context of a projected Asian Century, the expected economic and cultural dominance of Asia (primarily China) in the 21st century, in the 1990s. 'Asia for Asians' realClearPolitics and South China Morning Post compared Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping's speech to Imperial Japan.  Asian American studies  Paul Wong, Meera Manvi, and Takeo Hirota Wong proposed \\"Asiacentrism\\" in the 1995 special issue of Amerasia Journal on \\"Thinking Theory in Asian American Studies.\\" They envisioned Asiacentrism both as a critique of hegemonic Eurocentrism in theory building in the humanities and social sciences and as a post-Orientalist epistemological paradigm in Asian American Studies. There is a need to tap into Asian traditions of thought for analyzing Asian American behaviors and for advancing global knowledge in the human interest. The objective is to explore a common core of Asian worldviews and values that overlap in their influence on particular regions, nations, and communities. In their view, Asiacentrism may be able to offer an alternative Asian perspective grounded in an awareness of the dynamics of a postcolonial world. Wong, Manvi, and Wong also submitted that Asiacentrism can be a paradigmatic way of integrating Asian American Studies and Asian Studies by acknowledging the colonial histories, recognizing the common interests, and recovering the cultural roots. They stressed that Asian American Studies should play an important role in decolonizing Asian Studies by interrogating its Eurocentric legacies. = Communication studies = Yoshitaka Miike, Professor of Intercultural Communication at the University of Hawaii at Hilo and Past Chair of the International and Intercultural Communication Division of the National Communication Association, is considered as the founding theorist of Asiacentricity in the discipline of communication.Shelton A.

Miike defined Asiacentricity as \\"the self-conscious act of centering Asian languages, religions/philosophies, histories, and aesthetics when addressing Asian people and phenomena.\\" According to him, Asiacentricity \\"insists on revivifying and revitalizing diverse Asian cultural traditions as theoretical resources in order to capture Asians as subjects and actors of their own cultural realities rather than objects and spectators in the lived experiences of others.\\"Yoshitaka Miike, \\"Asiacentricity,\\" Key Concepts in Intercultural Dialogue, No. 24, July 21, 2014, Washington, DC: Center for Intercultural Dialogue. Borrowing from Daisetz Suzuki's words, Miike stated that Asiacentricity is essentially \\"the idea of being deep and open,\\" that is, the idea of being rooted in our own culture and, at the same time, open to other cultures.Yoshitaka Miike, \\"Asiacentricity: The Idea of Being Deep and Open,\\" in Francesca Bargiela-Chiappini, Catherine Nickerson, and Brigitte Planken, Business Discourse (2nd Ed.), Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013, pp. 57‚Äì58. He differentiated Asiacentricity as a particularist position from Asiacentrism as a universalist ideology and maintained that Asiacentricity is a legitimate culture-centric approach to cultural Asia and people of Asian descent, while Asiacentrism is an ethnocentric approach to non-Asian worlds and people of non-Asian heritage. In Miike's conceptualization, therefore, Asiacentrists are not cultural chauvinists and separatists.Yoshitaka Miike, \\"Asiacentricity,\\" in Young Yun Kim (Ed.), The International Encyclopedia of Intercultural Communication (Vol. 1), Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2018, pp. 39‚Äì46. Miike identified six dimensions of Asiacentricity: (1) an assertion of Asians as subjects and agents; (2) the centrality of the collective and humanistic interests of Asia and Asians in the process of knowledge reconstruction about the Asian world; (3) the placement of Asian cultural values and ideals at the center of inquiry into Asian thought and action; (4) the groundedness in Asian historical experiences; (5) an Asian theoretical orientation to data; and (6) an Asian ethical critique and corrective of the dislocation and displacement of Asian people and phenomena.Yoshitaka Miike, \\"An Anatomy of Eurocentrism in Communication Scholarship: The Role of Asiacentricity in De-Westernizing Theory and Research,\\" China Media Research, Vol. 6, No. 1, January 2010. In Miike's comprehensive outline, Asiacentricity (1) generates theoretical knowledge that corresponds to Asian communication discourse, (2) focuses on the multiplicity and complexity of Asian communicative experience, (3) reflexively constitutes and critically transforms Asian communication discourse, (4) theorizes how common aspects of humanity are expressed and understood in Asian cultural particularities, and (5) critiques Eurocentric biases in theory and research and helps Asian researchers overcome academic dependency. Miike's contention is that there has been the established hierarchical relationship between \\"Western theories\\" and \\"non-Western texts\\" in Eurocentric scholarship, where non-Western cultures remain as peripheral targets of data analysis and rhetorical criticism and fail to emerge as central resources of theoretical insight and humanistic inspiration. Miike thus insisted that Asiacentric scholarship reconsider Asian cultures as \\"theories for knowledge reconstruction,\\" not as \\"texts for knowledge deconstruction.\\" Such an Asiacentric approach, according to him, would make it possible for both Asian and non-Asian researchers to theorize as Asians speak in Asian languages, as Asians are influenced by Asian religious-philosophical worldviews, as Asians struggle to live in Asian historical experiences, and as Asians feel ethically good and aesthetically beautiful.Yoshitaka Miike, \\"The Asiacentric Turn in Asian Communication Studies: Shifting Paradigms and Changing Perspectives,\\" in Molefi Kete Asante, Yoshitaka Miike, and Jing Yin (Eds.), The Global Intercultural Communication Reader (2nd Ed.), New York, NY: Routledge, 2014, pp. 116‚Äì117. Miike also synthesized a large body of literature in the field of Asian communication theory while paying homage to such pioneers as Anantha Babbili, Guo-Ming Chen, Godwin C.

He urged Asiacentric research to overcome \\"comparative Eurocentrism\\" and direct more attention to common insights gained from non-Eurocentric comparisons.Yoshitaka Miike, \\"Culture as Text and Culture as Theory: Asiacentricity and Its Raison D‚Äô√™tre in Intercultural Communication Research,\\" in Thomas K. Nakayama and Rona Tamiko Halualani (Eds.), The Handbook of Critical Intercultural Communication, Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, pp. 195‚Äì196. In his opinion, five types of alternative non-Eurocentric comparisons can enlarge the theoretical horizons of Asian communication research: (1) continent-diaspora comparisons; (2) within-region comparisons; (3) between-region comparisons; (4) diachronic comparisons; and (5) co-cultural domestic comparisons.Yoshitaka Miike, \\"Asian Communication Studies at the Crossroads: A View to the Future from an Asiacentric Framework,\\" Journal of Content, Community, and Communication, Vol. 3, June 2016, pp. 3‚Äì4. Miike recently applied Asiacentricity and formulated five principles of intercultural communication ethics: (1) the principle of recognition and respect; (2) the principle of reaffirmation and renewal; (3) the principle of identification and indebtedness; (4) the principle of ecology and sustainability; and (5) the principle of rootedness and openness.Yoshitaka Miike, \\"Between Conflict and Harmony in the Human Family: Asiacentricity and Its Ethical Imperative for Intercultural Communication,\\" in Xiaodong Dai and Guo-Ming Chen (Eds.), Conflict Management and Intercultural Communication: The Art of Intercultural Harmony, London, UK: Routledge, 2017, pp. 45‚Äì57. He reiterated that \\"Asiacentricity does not implicitly suggest that non- Asiacentric standpoints are always incompatible with, or different from, Asiacentric viewpoints,\\" and that \\"the five ethical principles from the ideas and insights rooted in Asian cultural traditions and leave open the possibility that [his] Asiacentric perspective may converge to, and diverge from, other Asiacentric and non-Asiacentric ones.\\"Yoshitaka Miike, \\"Between Conflict and Harmony in the Human Family: Asiacentricity and Its Ethical Imperative for Intercultural Communication,\\" in Xiaodong Dai and Guo-Ming Chen (Eds.), Conflict Management and Intercultural Communication: The Art of Intercultural Harmony, London, UK: Routledge, 2017, p. 47. = Asante on Asiacentricity = Asante made positive comments on the Asiacentric efforts of both Wong, Manvi, and Wong in the 1990s and Miike and Yin in the 2000s. In the revised edition of The Afrocentric Idea, referring to Wong, Manvi, and Wong, Asante wrote: \\"I have been very gratified that educators were quick to see its [the Afrocentric idea's] implications for developing curricula that can empower students of all cultures; one group of scholars even proposes using it to develop an 'Asiacentric' perspective for Asian American Studies.\\"Molefi Kete Asante, The Afrocentric Idea (Rev. Ed.), Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 1998, p. ix. As for Miike and Yin, in An Afrocentric Manifesto, Asante remarked: \\"The original work of Yoshitaka Miike on Asiacentric communication is instructive. Miike, alongside Jing Yin, has articulated a view of Asian culture that seeks to liberate the discourse around Asian communication ideas and rhetorical concepts away from being forced into the straitjacket of Western ideas. This is a remarkable undertaking that will have far-reaching effect on the course of social science and humanities discussions about culture.\\"Molefi Kete Asante, An Afrocentric Manifesto: Toward an African Renaissance, Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 2007, p. 8. Economic The World's Economic Centre of Gravity 1980-2050. It is projected that the world's economic center of gravity will move back to Asia, between India and China by 2050,Quah, Danny. \\"The global economy‚Äôs shifting centre of gravity.\\" Global Policy 2.1 (2011): 3-9. spurred by the economic growth of East Asian economies. Historically, the economic center of gravity is estimated to have been in what is nowadays northern Pakistan in the 11th century, having moved west until the 1980s. The combined GDP of Asia is also projected to surpass that of the rest of the world around 2020, a position which the continent had lost in the 19th century.
