They were John Ravencroft - sax and clarinet, Francis \\"Fritz\\" Bastow - banjo and guitar, George Howard - drums and vibraphone, along with Ray McDermott - piano, accordion, and arranger. They were hired by Paul Whiteman to replace The Rhythm Boys and sang with him from 1930 to 1931. When they left Whiteman, they added vocalist Marjorie Whitney and called her their queen. These five were the core of the King's Jesters. Discovery Ray McDermott became interested in the boys and their story - in their ambition to strike the big time with their singing and vocal orchestra ideas. He listened to them. Became more interested. Trained them, gave them hope, encouragement, ideas. \\"And when he hit Cincinnati with Whiteman, he waited for his opportunity to arrange for an audition for the boys. The time came - and up came the boys suitcases in their hands and hearts in their mouths. \\"Mac\\" was reclassified as a member of the \\"King's Jesters\\" as Whiteman named them. A new band In 1932 the King's Jesters left Whiteman, who replaced them with The Nitecaps trio (later known as The Rhythm Boys). They formed a new band with Fritz Bastow, George Howard and John Ravencroft, members of a six-piece orchestra which was formed in Chicago and Rochester. The King's Jesters is now composed of seven members which include: the three Rochester men, Ray McDermott who has been the piano accompanist for the Jesters, Jimmy Awad on trumpet, Bob Casey on string bass, and a girl blues singer, Marjorie Whitney. The King's Jesters broadcast daily from the Hotel Morrison in Chicago and are heard over the NBC network. In June 1936 the King's Jesters begin playing at the Bismark Hotel in Chicago, IL. Their repertoire has numerous instrumental combinations for fox trot dancing and equally attractive vocal combinations for the bright, straight, and novelty tunes they perform. America's Biggest Little Band After Ray McDermott died of pneumonia in 1937, The King's Jesters and their band opened a new floor show in the Blue Fountain Room at the La Salle Hotel current site for the State of Illinois Building Thompson Center, 2013 in Chicago. In July 1937, The King's Jesters orchestra received much publicity when their band's picture was used on the front cover of the July 3, 1937 issue of the Billboard, one of America's foremost amusement weeklies. The King's Jesters are recognized as \\"America's Biggest Little Band.\\" They were under the management of Consolidated Radio Artists, Inc. of Chicago at that time. In 1937 the King's Jesters performed at the Fairview Hotel & Dance Gardens after completing a several month engagement in the LaSalle Hotel, Chicago.

Their queen, Marjorie Whitney, has a number of songs to herself, which include 'They Can't Take That Away From Me' and 'There'll be Changes Made'. Benny Goodman The King's Jesters band made two guest appearances with Benny Goodman and his orchestra, one on July 7, 1941 and one on July 24, 1941. They appeared at such places as the Sir Francis Drake hotel in San Francisco; William Penn hotel in Pittsburgh; LaSalle hotel in Chicago; the Carlton hotel in Washington, and the Philadelphia hotel in Philadelphia. For all these spots they broadcast over the NBC and Mutual coast-to-coast networks. The end Although Ray McDermott died in 1937, the band grew at one point to 10 members. All the members retired in 1962. The original vocal trio was from Rochester, Indiana and that is where they died. George Howard died in 1991, Francis Bastow died in 1992 and John Ravencroft died in 1996. Marjorie Whitney was from Lincoln NE and died in 1994 in Las Vegas, NV, under the name Marjorie Halter.

Dion, 476 U.S. 734 (1986), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which held that, pursuant to the Eagle Protection Act, American Indians were prohibited from hunting eagles. Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the unanimous opinion of the Court.. Facts Dwight Dion Sr., a member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, was convicted of shooting five bald eagles in violation of the Endangered Species Act, and of selling the carcasses in violation of the Eagle Protection Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The takings occurred on the Yankton Indian Reservation. The reservation was created by an 1858 treaty; the Yankton tribe ceded all but of their territory to the United States. In exchange for the land, the United States guaranteed the tribe quiet and undisturbed possession of the reserved land, as well as monetary compensation. All parties to the litigation acknowledged that the treaty granted exclusive rights to hunt and fish on the reservation. The Eagle Protection Act, by its express terms, made it a federal offense to hunt bald or golden eagles anywhere within the United States unless provided a permit by the Secretary of the Interior. The Endangered Species Act also imposed strict sanctions on the hunting of species such as the bald eagle that have been listed as endangered or threatened. Procedural history The District Court convicted Dion for the shooting of bald eagles in violation of the Endangered Species Act, and for the distribution of carcasses in violation of the Eagle Protection Act. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, however, held that members of the Yankton Sioux Tribe have a treaty right to hunt bald eagles within the Yankton Reservation for noncommercial purposes. It also held that the Eagle Protection Act and Endangered Species Act did not abrogate this treaty right. Since neither the District Court nor the jury ruled on whether the killings were for commercial or noncommercial purposes, the appellate court directed that Dion's convictions for shooting bald eagles be vacated. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine the correctness of the Eighth Circuit's holding that noncommercial hunting of bald eagles on the Yankton reservation was not punishable under the Endangered Species Act or Eagle Protection Act. Decision The Court began by acknowledging that generally Indian tribes enjoy the exclusive rights to hunt and fish on lands granted to them by treaty; such rights, however, could be abrogated by the express terms of Congress. Citing Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock as precedent, the Court concluded that Congress retained the power to modify Indian treaties so long as it does so in clear and explicit terms. Justice Marshall acknowledged that the Court has adopted different standards of review to determine whether Congress intended to abrogate treaty rights. The overriding emphasis, however, is evidence that Congress considered the effect of its actions on existing treaty rights, and chose to resolve the conflict by abrogating the treaty. The Court found that such evidence was strongly suggested on the face of the Eagle Protection Act. The statute allowed for the Secretary of the Interior to grant permits to Indians in some situations; such a framework convincingly showed that Congress was aware of the effect its action would have on Indian hunting rights. The Court also found compelling evidence of congressional intent in the legislative history of the Act. Before hearings on an amendment to extend protection to the golden eagle, Assistant Secretary of the Interior Frank P. Briggs wrote a letter to the subcommittee acknowledging the religious significance of the golden eagle to many Indian tribes of the southwest. The record also revealed that various witnesses gave testimony as to the effects of the ban on Indian tribes. The bill passed with an amendment granting the Secretary the authority to grant case specific permits for Indians to hunt eagles for religious purposes. The Court found adequate evidence in the legislative history that Congress intended to abrogate the treaty rights of Indians. The Court was unconvinced by the respondent's evidence of an Interior Department memorandum stating that the Eagle Protection Act did not apply to Indian tribes. The Court found no evidence that the memorandum was ever shown to, or contemplated by Congress. The respondent argued further that the permit framework was meant to bind non-Indians from hunting eagles for Indian religious ceremonies, but did not deprive Indian hunters of their exclusive right to hunt eagles on reservations. The Court thought this argument strained credulity. Finally, Dion asserted a treaty defense to his convictions under the Endangered Species Act. Because the legislative history of that Act revealed almost no discussion of its effect on Indian rights, Dion argued that he was immune from prosecution. The Court disagreed, however, stating that because the Eagle Protection Act divested Dion of his right to hunt eagles, he was barred from asserting that right as a defense in another context such as the Endangered Species Act. Ruling The Court of Appeals ruling was reversed to the extent it recognized a treaty defense to the Eagle Protection Act and Endangered Species Act prosecutions, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the Court's opinion. Because the issue was not raised on appeal, the Court did not rule on whether Congress' criminalization of hunting eagles violated Dion's religious freedom.

The series first aired July 13, 2008. The show, shot in South Beach, Miami, centers on Brooke Hogan beginning adulthood independent from her parents, no longer living under their roof or being supported by them. The show was canceled after 2 seasons. Overview Brooke Knows Best focuses on singer and daughter of legendary professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, Brooke Hogan, and her friendships with her two roommates, Glenn and Ashley. The series features Hogan dealing with her family's problems, her music career, and her life as she's no longer dependent upon her parents nor lives with her family. The show consists of her friends, Glenn and Ashley ‚Äì who are often encouraging Brooke to get out, have fun, and party. Brooke, Glenn, and Ashley live in a penthouse in South Beach, which is paid for by VH1. Two major problems Brooke deals with in the show's first season are dating and coping through the trials and tribulations of her family which is why the series came about as a spin-off of Hogan Knows Best. Her family is no longer together due to Hulk and Linda Hogan's divorce, as well as Nick Hogan's prior arrest related to a serious car accident in which he permanently injured his best friend; for these reasons, the predecessor show was cancelled. As of the first season of Brooke Knows Best, Hulk Hogan has made many guest appearances, usually to the frustrations of Brooke and her two roommates; Linda has made a couple (one in which she's seen heartbroken and crying over the circumstances surrounding her family); Nick has made one. Cast *Brooke Hogan, now out on her own with the love and support of her family, Brooke often finds herself unsure of how to handle many situations. As one example, she's become confused with what she wants to do in life, reconsidering going to college as opposed to continuing on with her career in music. Because of her passiveness, admittedly hating confrontation, Hogan has had numerous issues being direct and up-front with people, especially considering the fact that her father took over in this area when they lived together. Brooke is not without her goofy and playful side that was seen on Hogan Knows Best. Occasionally, Hogan also finds herself depressed and saddened from reflecting on her family's troubles, as well as in terms of romantic relationships. Despite no longer having her father as an obstacle in meeting boys, Hogan has found that an even bigger obstacle is finding the right one. *Glenn Douglas Packard is Brooke's affable, jovial, fun-loving roommate. Glenn is a music director and choreographer from Clare, Michigan, who handles the choreography for Brooke's music. Glenn is openly gay and Hulk Hogan was quick to make sure of this upon finding out that he would be rooming with Brooke, making it clear that he wasn't ok with any heterosexual or bisexual men living with his daughter. With her parents now out of the picture, Glenn acts as a support system for Brooke, especially when she is feeling sad about something or confused on how to handle certain situations. Very supportive and open-minded, Glenn helps Brooke in making decisions, offers advice, and is always open to whatever decisions Brooke ends up making. *Ashley Menendez is Brooke's second roommate to move in. When Brooke and Glenn were unable to find a fitting second roommate in their area, they both decided on Ashley, who was an old high school friend of Brooke's. Prior to the series, Menendez had moved to New York to become a dancer but had to stop due to an injury.

He was the last surviving former player of the Spokane Canaries. Playing career Fowler played for various senior league teams in his hometown of Saskatoon from 1909 to 1916, appearing in the Allan Cup playoffs in 1916, before turning professional with the Spokane Canaries of the PCHA in 1917. The Canaries, citing poor attendance, disbanded for the following season, and while Fowler had played poorly for Spokane, the defending Stanley Cup champion Seattle Metropolitans were confident enough to sign him as their goaltender. With Fowler at the helm, the Mets won the league championship but were upset in the playoffs by the Vancouver Millionaires. At that point, Fowler enlisted in the military for the last year of World War I, and when he mustered out of the service, signed with the Victoria Cougars for the 1920 season. He played five seasons in all for the Cougars before being sold to the expansion Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League in October 1924. Behind a weak defense, Fowler was repeatedly shelled and released by Boston by the end of December. He signed with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Western Canada Hockey League to finish the season, but took the next year off.

Charles Bukowski called him \\"the best unread poet in America.\\" Early life John Thomas Idlet was born in Baltimore in 1930, the son of a teacher and World War I veteran who claimed to have invented the \\"double header\\" ice-cream cone. His father later committed suicide. Thomas attended Loyola College and described being \\"poisoned by Thomas Wolfe at an early age\\". After school, he considered entering the priesthood, but instead served in the Air Force during the Korean War, working as cryptographer due to his very high IQ. He was a huge man; 6 feet and 4 inches tall, and 300 pounds, the writer John Arthur Maynard described him \\"a cut-down version of Paul Bunyan ‚Äì huge bones, huge ribcage, menacing brow, and beard\\". After his discharge in 1954, he married, had children and worked as a taxi driver, psychiatric orderly and city worker, while writing never completed novels. Despite a hatred of computers, he later became a computer programmer. He required time off following a truck accident, in which he broke his ankle. During his convalescence, he began to write and grew a beard, which he refused to shave off when he returned to work. As a result, he was fired from his job, and was forced to work mixing powders and cleaning vats in his wife's lover's paint factory. Having read Lawrence Lipton's book Holy Barbarians (1959), Thomas sold his books for $20, abandoned his family, and hitchhiked to California. A driver of a Cadillac picked him up outside Pittsburgh and took him to Beverly Hills. Thomas took a bus to Venice Beach, where he lived for the rest of his life. Venice beat years At Venice Beach Thomas worked as the manager and chef of the Gas House, a project which aimed to provide free meals to poets and artists who were living rent-free at the Grand Hotel Menus were planned based on the amount of money gathered in a gallon jar by tourists who had ogled the beatniks during the day. Ingenuity was needed, and Thomas used cheap fish, and \\"filet mignon\\", which as actually horse meat bought from a local pet store. Thomas declared himself a writer, but when the poet Maurice Lacy asked what specifically he wrote, he replied unthinkingly, \\"I'm a poet\\". As a result, he was obliged to write some poems, and was learned much about the craft from the poet Stuart Perkoff. Poetry came more easily than the novels, but even poetry was a struggle for the writer, and \\"NOT writing and deep inability to write became his central theme if not celebrity\\". As he wrote in \\"Apologia\\" > \\"I think maybe today a poem I hope > after breakfast I start trying > pulling it out of my own gut > mostly by force\\" He recognized that he had always wanted to be a man who had written books, rather wanting to do the actual work of writing. He admitted that his earlier \\"novel-writing ambition was just sheer, vulgar pretense, wanting to be a great man.\\" Thomas was member of Venice beats, a little-known group described as \\"an outlaw strain in Southern California letters\\", by the historian John Arthur Maynard. The Venice beats were outsiders who rejected popular culture and fame, preferring lives of poverty and art. According to Maynard, instead of wanting to change the world like other beats, \\"[w]hat they really wanted to do was to write their poems, paint their paintings, take their drugs, love their friends and keep from getting busted by the police.\\" Thomas was highly sexually active and \\"a great connoisseur of fellatio, threesomes and communal erotic activity\\". In early 1970s, he invited his 15-year-old daughter, he had not seen for 12 years, to visit, gave her drugs and engaged in oral sex with her. Thomas was a key founding member of the \\"Venice West Foot Stamping & Poem Eating Society\\", which met at the Venice West Coffee House. Though planned, the group never produced a planned magazine, due to lack of funds. Thomas' abandoned wife sued him for non-support and he had to escape to San Francisco to avoid the police. On his return, Thomas taught classes at the Free University of California, hosted at the Pot-Pourri Coffee House. Thomas' first collection of poems, Apologia was published in 1972 in a limited edition of 405 copies. Thirty of the copies numbered, signed, and \\"sealed\\" by the author, presumably so they could not be read. Four years later Thomas published Epopoeia and the Decay of Satire which consisted of the same works, except that some of the poems in the first collection had been deleted from the second. For most of the 1970s and early 1980s he stopped writing poetry at all, and instead \\"listen[ed] to the trees\\" and write a journal. Thomas published another collection of poetry, \\"Abandoned Latitudes\\" in 1983. Idlet's poem \\"The Ghosts of the Poets\\" is engraved on wall of the Venice boardwalk. Later years Thomas met his fourth wife, the poet Philomene Long in 1983 at a poetry reading. The couple were inseparable in his last years, and Thomas dedicated his final poems to her. He said she \\"resurrected him.\\" They lived together on the edge of American society, maintaining a lifestyle of \\"living poor\\" based on the ancient Zen recluse poets. \\"I would feel uncomfortable and irritable living any other way. I have Philomene, a pen, a pad, shirt and pants. If you start wanting more, it fills you up, leading to a poverty of the heart and mind.\\" Thomas spent the sunset days of his life in his house in Venice Beach and reading while sitting under a sweet gum tree on the grounds of the Zen Center of Los Angeles. In 2002, Idlet pleaded no contest to a charge of unlawful sexual contact with his 15-year-old daughter in the 1970s, and was sentenced to 120 days in jail. Less than 3 weeks into his sentence, Thomas died of congestive heart failure at the age of 71 in the USC Los Angeles County Medical Center. In 2007, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department settled a lawsuit brought by his widow for $475,000. The lawsuit alleged that the prison system did not provide him adequate medical care, including failing to have him seen by a doctor despite evident poor health. Legacy Thomas's poetry was praised for its grace and clarity, and he was an exceptional reader of his own work. He was influenced by Ezra Pound, the Chinese poet Li Po, and the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. His poetry demonstrated his wide reading and immense imagination in spare, uncluttered forms. He was an exacting and ruthless critic of the work of others, which made him unpopular with others at times. Neeli Cherkovski described him as \\"by far the greatest underground poet in Los Angeles for the last 35, 40 years\\". Poet and editor Paul Vangelisti, who knew him well, remembered that \\"He was a gadfly in a time of self-mythologies. John made us understand what's going on inside the mind can have nothing to do with what's going on outside. John made no bones.\\" \\" = Poetry = * Epopoeia and the Decay of Satire.

It commemorates the December 26, 1776, Battle of Trenton, a pivotal victory for the Continental forces during the American Revolutionary War. Description The Trenton Battle Monument concourse during its dedication ceremony on October 19, 1893 Designed by John H. Duncan, the architect of Grant's Tomb, the monument is an early example of Beaux-Arts architecture in America. The design is based on \\"The Monument\\", a 1671 structure built to commemorate the Great Fire of London, on the London street where the 1666 fire started. The height of the Trenton monument is intentionally the same height as the London monument. The hollow Roman-Doric fluted column of the monument is constructed of granite, as is the pedestal which supports it, although slightly darker stone was used to give the base the appearance of more solidity. The column is capped by a small, round pavilion, forming an observation deck; accessible by means of an electric elevator, that has provided thousands of tourists an excellent view of the city and the surrounding scene of the battle. Encircling the column, just above the cap, thirteen electric lights, symbolizing the original Thirteen Colonies, shed their radiance at night. The pavilion is surmounted by an acanthus leaf pedestal where, atop the entire structure, a colossal bronze statue of General George Washington by William Rudolf O'Donovan crowns the monument. Washington is depicted as he appeared at the opening of the engagement and, with his extended right hand, directs the fire of the Continental artillery down King (now Warren) Street. The figure is feet tall, while the monument, including the statue, is above street level. On the base of the pedestal are two bronze relief panels by Thomas Eakins depicting \\"The Continental Army Crossing the Delaware River\\" and \\"The Opening of the Battle.\\" The latter panel depicts the battery of Alexander Hamilton about to fire down King Street. A third bronze relief panel, \\"The Surrender of the Hessians,\\" was modeled by Charles Henry Niehaus. On the north side of the pedestal is a bronze tablet presented by the Society of the Cincinnati of New Jersey. Guarding the entrance to the monument stand two bronze figures of Continental soldiers by O'Donovan. One is a statue of Private John Russell, a member of Colonel John Glover's Marblehead Regiment of seafaring men from Marblehead, Massachusetts, who gained fame by transporting Washington's army across the ice-choked Delaware River on the night of December 25‚Äì26, 1776. The other figure is modeled after a likeness of Private Blair McClenachan, of the Philadelphia Light Horse Troop, a unit which also took part in the battle. History The monument is located in an area of the city known as \\"Five Points\\". It was here, at the intersection of Warren (King) Street, North Broad (Queen) Street, Brunswick, Pennington and Princeton Avenues, that the American artillery was placed. From this high vantage point, they dominated the streets of Trenton, preventing the Hessian troops from organizing an effective counterattack. A movement to erect a monument commemorating the victory at Trenton began in 1843. About forty years later in 1886, the property for the monument was acquired by the Trenton Monument Association. To build the monument, the New Jersey legislature appropriated $15,000, Congress $30,000, and citizens contributed $15,000. Monument Park at the \\"Five Points\\" was acquired under the provisions of an ordinance passed June 28, 1893. The cornerstone was laid Saturday, December 26, 1891, on the 115th anniversary of the Battle of Trenton. The base and pedestal were erected in the spring of 1892, the capstone raised into position on Saturday, August 31, 1893, and the statue of General Washington finally placed atop the shaft September 5 of the same year. The completed memorial was dedicated with elaborate ceremonies on October 19, 1893, the 112th anniversary of the surrender of General Lord Cornwallis at the Siege of Yorktown in Virginia; in attendance were eight governors of the original thirteen states. Although various changes have taken place in the immediate vicinity of the monument since its dedication, the commanding figure of Washington still looks down upon the city, which has developed from what was a small village in 1776. The monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. An inoperable elevator makes visiting the vantage point impossible.

This in turn, led to space travel finally becoming feasible since aging is either non-existent or slowed down to a very slow state. This leads to humans making contact with alien life forms, in a desperate attempt for humans to fit in, they establish Free Trade. Free Trade is one of the biggest if not the biggest corporations in the whole Milky Way galaxy. But humanity doesn't stop there, despite humanity having long abandoned their bodies, they still kept the stubborn will to fight. With contracting being open to the highest bidder, prospectors fight on earth-like planets with rich gold deposits, while being supplied by companies like Alchiral or Free Trade.  Reception  The control system for the unfinished version of the game has been described as \\"too fiddly to be considered entertaining\\" in 2007. Others described the game as requiring patience, asking players to \\"take [their] time and experiment\\". The game has been compared to other games in the genre, such as GunBound and Worms. Positive reviews praise the detailed physics, as well as the chaotic gameplay. Cortex Command was the Indie Games Game of the Month for April 2008.

Bone-setting was a medical practice used to manipulate and fix musculoskeletal injuries using manual force. Mapp grew up in Wiltshire, England, and learned about the practice from her father, who was also a bone-setter. She frequently fixed horse racing injuries, but her most famous case was fixing the spinal deformity of Sir Hans Sloane's niece. Early life Sarah Mapp was baptized in 1706 near Wiltshire, England. She was the daughter of John and Jenny Wallin. John Wallin was a bone-setter as well, and when he was unable to conduct bone setting practices, Mapp carried on and dealt with the cases, often even better than her father. She accordingly left him and established her own practice called 'Cracked Sally - the One and Only Bone Setter'. Mapp's nickname 'Crazy Sally' came from her masculine personality and reputation for quarreling with her father and drinking. Mapp could often be found wandering the country in a drunken state and shouting obscenities, which also contributed to her nickname. Mapp's sister Lavinia Fenton had a considerably different life. Lavinia Fenton played Polly Peachum in The Beggar's Opera in 1728 and later married Charles Powlett, 3rd Duke of Bolton. Practice Bone- setting in the 18th century was often carried out by men, specifically farriers and blacksmiths, because it required a lot of strength. Mapp's career started out when she was a young girl. She served as the announcer at her father's booth during local races and fairs. When Mapp started helping her father's patients when he couldn't see them, she often performed amazing feats and treated them better than her father could. Mapp went on to start her own practice and her fame spread. Around 1735, Mapp's fame for fixing decade-old dislocations and fractures brought her to Epsom. Epsom was home to a large number of wealthy families and horse-racing, which provided Mapp with many patients. Even though Mapp had a limited knowledge of anatomy, she had the strength and innate talent for putting dislocations back into place. The racing community in Epsom appreciated Mapp's work and when they found out she might leave, the town offered Mapp 100 guineas yearly to reside there and set bones in 1736. While living in Epsom, she traveled to London twice a week and saw patients at the Grecian Coffee House. Mapp traveled to London in style with an expensive coach and a team of four horses. She would collect the crutches of her cured patients and decorate her carriage with them. At the same time, Sir Hans Sloane was also prescribing and conducting his private practice out of the Grecian Coffee House. Mapp is credited with fixing a spinal deformity on Sloane's niece, which bolstered her fame in London. Mapp consulted on and fixed multiple cases. Some of her most noteworthy cases are recorded in James Caulfied's Portraits, Memoirs, and Characters of Remarkable Persons where he recorded an account from October 21, 1736, \\"On Monday, Mrs. Mapp performed two extraordinary cures; one on a young lady of the Temple, who had several bones out from the knees to her toes, which she put in their proper places: and the other on a butcher, whose knee-pans were so misplaced that he walked with his knees knocking one against another. Yesterday she performed several other surprising cures; and about one set out for Epsom, and carried with her several crutches, which she calls trophies of honour.\\" At one point, some surgeons tried to fool Mapp and show that she was not skilled by sending her a healthy patient who claimed he had a damaged wrist. This test angered Mapp and she dislocated the patient's wrist and sent him back to the people who had tried to trick her. Later life Mapp was once mistaken for one of George II's mistresses while riding in her carriage by an angry mob. She is reported to have responded to the angry mob by yelling, \\"Damn your blood, don't you know me? I am Mrs. Mapp, the bone-setter.\\" In August 1736, she married an abusive footman named Hill Mapp who absconded with 100 guineas of her savings. After initial confusion and anger, Mapp claimed that the money was worth losing to get rid of her husband. In 1737, Mapp died in Seven Dials and was buried by the parish there. In art Hogarth. Mapp is pictured at the top, center. A song about Mapp appeared in a contemporary play at Lincoln's Inn Fields, The Husband's Relief, comparing her favorably to highly- paid London surgeons. Mapp is reported to have attended the play. Her portrait appears at the top of William Hogarth's The Company of Undertakers (Consultation of Quacks) (1736), which grouped her with \\"quacks\\", but suggested that both the quacks and \\"professional\\" physicians of the day might lead to death. In 1819, George Cruikshank portrayed Mapp, probably based on Hogarth's drawing.  Legacy  Originally, Mapp was well-loved wherever she worked because of her talents as a bone-setter. In Epsom, the racing community especially appreciated her contributions and named a mare Mrs. Mapp in honor of her. However, towards the end of her life, she started to fall out of fame and favor. In 1736, the established medical community started to try to eliminate the \\"quacks\\" operating in London, so Mapp moved to Pall Mall. The famous artist William Hogarth depicted her in his print The Company of Undertakers. Hogarth's print only pushed her further away from fame as he chose to draw her as very masculine and ugly. Hogarth's print was coupled with Sir Percivall Pott's criticism of Mapp when he called her \\"an immortal drunken female savage\\". Both of these attacks on Mapp along with changing social attitudes led to her decline in popularity. This fall from fame caused Mapp to drink heavily and lose her customers. In 1737, Mapp died in Seven Dials and, due to her poverty, was buried by the parish. Sarah Mapp was only alive for thirty years, but she is still well recorded in history because of her character and the fact that she was a very successful female in what was typically considered a male field. In modern literature, Mapp is widely cited as an example of a quack.Stableford, Brian. (2006). Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia. Routledge. p. 294. Chapman, Allan. (2016).

The Snapdragon central processing unit (CPU) uses the ARM RISC. A single SoC may include multiple CPU cores, an Adreno graphics processing unit (GPU), a Snapdragon wireless modem, a Hexagon Digital signal processor (DSP), a Qualcomm Spectra Image Signal Processor (ISP) and other software and hardware to support a smartphone's global positioning system (GPS), camera, video, audio, gesture recognition and AI acceleration. As such, Qualcomm often refers to the Snapdragon as a \\"mobile platform\\" (e.g., Snapdragon 865 5G Mobile Platform). Snapdragon semiconductors are embedded in devices of various systems, including Android, Windows Phone and netbooks. They are also used in cars, wearable devices and other devices. In addition to the processors, the Snapdragon line includes modems, wi-fi chips and mobile charging products. The first Snapdragon product to consumer device manufacturers was the QSD8250, which was released in December 2007. It included the first 1 GHz processor for mobile phones. Qualcomm introduced its \\"Krait\\" microarchitecture in the second generation of Snapdragon SoCs in 2011, allowing each processor core to adjust its speed based on the device's needs. At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show, Qualcomm introduced the first of the Snapdragon 800 series and renamed prior models as the 200, 400 and 600 series. Several new iterations have been introduced since, such as the Snapdragon 805, 810, 615 and 410. Qualcomm re- branded its modem products under the Snapdragon name in February 2015. , Asus, HP and Lenovo have begun selling laptops with Snapdragon-based CPUs running Windows 10 under the name \\"Always Connected PCs\\", marking an entry into the PC market for Qualcomm and the ARM architecture. History =Pre-release= Qualcomm announced it was developing the Scorpion central processing unit (CPU) in November 2007. The Snapdragon system on chip (SoC) was announced in November 2006 and included the Scorpion processor, as well as other semiconductors. This also included Qualcomm's first custom Hexagon digital signal processor (DSP). According to a Qualcomm spokesperson, it was named Snapdragon, because \\"Snap and Dragon sounded fast and fierce.\\" The following month, Qualcomm acquired Airgo Networks for an undisclosed amount; it said Airgo's 802.11a/b/g and 802.11n Wi-Fi technology would be integrated with the Snapdragon product suite. Early versions of Scorpion had a processor core design similar to the Cortex-A8. =Early products (2007-2009)= Qualcomm QSD8250 The first Snapdragon shipments were of the QSD8250 in November 2007. According to CNET, Snapdragon claim to fame was having the first 1 GHz mobile made processor. Most smartphones at the time were using 500 MHz processors. The first generation of Snapdragon products supported a 720p resolution, 3D graphics and a 12-megapixel camera. By November 2008, 15 device manufacturers decided to embed Snapdragon semiconductors in their consumer electronics products. In November 2008, Qualcomm announced it would also compete against Intel in the netbook processor market with dual-core Snapdragon system-on- chips planned for late 2009. It demonstrated a Snapdragon processor that consumed less power than Intel chips announced around the same time and claimed it would also cost less when released. That same month, Qualcomm introduced a Snapdragon-based prototype netbook called Kayak that used 1.5 GHz processors and was intended for developing markets. In May 2009, Java SE was ported and optimized for Snapdragon. At the November 2009 Computex Taipei show, Qualcomm announced the QSD8650A addition to the Snapdragon product suite, which was based on 45 nanometer manufacturing processes. It featured a 1.2 GHz processor and had lower power consumption than prior models. =Adoption (2009-2010)= By late 2009, smartphone manufacturers announced they would be using Snapdragon SoCs in the Acer Liquid Metal, HTC HD2, Toshiba TG01 and the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10. Lenovo announced the first netbook product using Snapdragon SoCs that December. According to PC World, mobile devices using Snapdragon had better battery life and were smaller in size than those using other SoCs. By June 2010, Snapdragon chips were embedded in 20 available consumer devices and incorporated into 120 product designs in development. Apple had a dominant market position for smartphones at the time and did not incorporate Snapdragon into any of its products. The success of Snapdragon therefore relied on competing Android phones, such as Google's Nexus One and the HTC Incredible, challenging Apple's market position. Android devices did end up taking market share from the iPhone and predominantly used Snapdragon. There was an \\"unconfirmed but widely circulated report\\" speculating that Apple was going to start using Snapdragon SoCs in Verizon- based iPhones. As of 2012, Apple was still using their own Ax semiconductor designs. Support for the Windows Phone 7 operating systems was added to Snapdragon in October 2010. By 2011 Snapdragon was embedded in Hewlett Packard's WebOS devices and had a 50% market share of a $7.9 billion smartphone processor market. By 2012, the Snapdragon S4 (Krait core) had taken a dominant share from other Android system-on-chips like Nvidia Tegra and Texas Instruments OMAP which caused the latter to exit the market. As of July 2014, the market share of Android phones had grown to 84.6 percent, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips were embedded in 41% of smartphones. However, the September 2013 debut of Apple's 64-bit A7 chip in the iPhone 5S forced Qualcomm to release a competing 64-bit product, despite the capable performance of the Snapdragon 800/801/805, since their existing Krait cores were only 32-bit. The first 64-bit SoCs, the Snapdragon 808 and 810, were rushed to market using generic Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 cores and suffered from overheating problems and throttling, particularly the 810, which led Samsung to stop using Snapdragon for its Galaxy S6 flagship phone, and Galaxy Note 5 phablet. Snapdragon chips are also used in most Android-based smartwatches. Snapdragon products have also been used in virtual reality products, in vehicles like the Maserati Quattroporte and Cadillac XTS and in other applications. =32-bit ARM era (2010-2015)= Snapdragon S4 Play Processor - Qualcomm MSM8225 In June 2010, Qualcomm began sampling the third generation of Snapdragon products; two dual-core 1.2 GHz system on chips (SoC) called the Mobile Station Modem (MSM) 8260 and 8660. The 8260 was for GSM, UMTS and HSPA+ networks, while the 8660 was for CDMA2000 and EVDO networks. That November Qualcomm announced the MSM8960 for LTE networks. In early 2011, Qualcomm announced a new processor architecture called Krait, which used the ARM v7 instruction set, but was based on Qualcomm's own processor design. The processors were called S4 and had a feature named Asynchronous Symmetrical Multi-Processing (aSMP), meaning each processor core adjusted its clock speed and voltage based on the device's activity in order to optimize battery usage. Prior models were renamed to S1, S2 and S3 to distinguish each generation. The S4-based generation of Snapdragon SoCs began shipping to product manufacturers with the MSM8960 in February 2012. In benchmark tests by Anandtech, the MSM8960 had better performance than any other processor tested. In an overall system benchmark, the 8960 obtained a score of 907, compared to 528 and 658 for the Galaxy Nexus and HTC Rezound respectively. In a Quadrant benchmark test, which assesses raw processing power, a dual-core Krait processor had a score of 4,952, whereas the quad-core Tegra 3 was just under 4,000. The quad- core version, APQ8064, was made available in July 2012. It was the first Snapdragon SoC to use Qualcomm's Adreno 320 graphics processing unit (GPU). Adoption of Snapdragon contributed to Qualcomm's transition from a wireless modem company to one that also produces a wider range of hardware and software for mobile devices. In July 2011 Qualcomm acquired certain assets from GestureTek in order to incorporate its gesture recognition intellectual property into Snapdragon SoCs. In mid-2012 Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon software development kit (SDK) for Android devices at the Uplinq developer conference. The SDK includes tools for facial recognition, gesture recognition, noise cancellation and audio recording. That November Qualcomm acquired some assets from EPOS Development in order to integrate its stylus and gesture recognition technology into Snapdragon products. It also collaborated with Microsoft to optimize Windows Phone 8 for Snapdragon semiconductors. By 2012, the Snapdragon S4 (Krait core) had taken a dominant share from other Android system-on-chips like Nvidia Tegra and Texas Instruments OMAP which caused the latter to exit the market. As of July 2014, the market share of Android phones had grown to 84.6 percent, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips powered 41% of smartphones. However, the September 2013 debut of Apple's 64-bit A7 chip in the iPhone 5S forced Qualcomm to rush out a competing 64-bit solution, despite the capable performance of the Snapdragon 800/801/805, since their existing Krait cores were only 32-bit. The first 64-bit SoCs, the Snapdragon 808 and 810, were rushed to market using generic Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 cores and suffered from overheating problems and throttling, particularly the 810, which led to Samsung ditching Snapdragon for its Galaxy S6 flagship phone. The entry-level 200 series was expanded with six new processors using 28 nanometer manufacturing and dual or quad-core options in June 2013. The entry-level Snapdragon 210, intended for low-cost phones, was announced in September 2014. = Custom 64-bit ARM era (2016-current) = After, Qualcomm's first attempt at 64-bit system on a chip, they created a new in-house architecture, that in later models showed better thermal performance, especially when compared to the Snapdragon models launched after 2015, like the Snapdragon 820. In early 2016, Qualcomm launched the Snapdragon 820, an ARM 64-bit quad-core processor using in-house designed Kryo cores. Qualcomm launched an updated Snapdragon 821 later in the year with higher clock speeds and slightly better performance. The Snapdragon 820 family uses Samsung's 14-nanometer FinFET process. Qualcomm also released the Qualcomm Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK which was the first AI acceleration on smartphones. Qualcomm announced the octa-core Snapdragon 835 SoC on 17 November 2016. Released the following year, it uses Kryo 280 cores and is built using Samsung's 10-nanometer FinFET process. At initial launch, due to Samsung's role in manufacturing the chip, its mobile division also acquired the initial inventory of the chip. That means that no other phone maker was able to manufacture products containing the Snapdragon 835 until Samsung released its flagship device of the year, the Galaxy S8. At Computex 2017 in May, Qualcomm and Microsoft announced plans to launch Snapdragon-based laptops running Windows 10. Qualcomm partnered with HP, Lenovo, and Asus to release slim portables and 2-in-1 devices powered by the Snapdragon 835. In December 2017, Qualcomm announced the octa-core Snapdragon 845. It uses the same 10-nanometer manufacturing process as the earlier Snapdragon 835 but introduced a new processor architecture, Kryo 385, designed for better battery life, photography, and for use with artificial intelligence apps. In early 2018, Qualcomm introduced the 7 series, which sits between the 6 and 8 series in terms of pricing and performance. The 700 launched with octa-core models Snapdragon 710 and 712, using the Kryo 360 processor architecture, and built on a 10-nanometer manufacturing process. In 2019, Qualcomm released new variants of its mobile processors, with the Snapdragon 855 replacing the 845. The Snapdragon 855 competes against other high end system-on-chip solutions like the Apple A12, and Kirin 980. The Snapdragon 855 features Kryo 485 cores, built on TSMC's 7-nanometer process. The Snapdragon 730 and 730G replaced the 710 and 712. The newer 730 and 730G feature Kryo 460 cores, built on Samsung's 8-nanometer process. In December 2019, Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon 865 and Snapdragon 765, which succeeded the Snapdragon 855/855+ and Snapdragon 730/730G respectively. The Snapdragon 765 has integrated 5G, while the Snapdragon 865 is assisted by a separate Qualcomm X55 5G modem. Despite lacking integrated 5G, the Snapdragon 865 is incompatible with 4G phones. In May 2020, Qualcomm announced the new Snapdragon 768G 5G processor, an upgraded version of the 765G processor. The main difference between the 765G and 768G is that the 768G will offer 15 percent increase in performance and higher clock speed on the CPU, up to 2.8GHz from 2.4GHz. In September 2020, Qualcomm unveiled the Snapdragon 750G processor, the latest addition to the 7-series, designed to bring 5G support for low-latency mobile gaming. Description and current models Snapdragon system on chip products typically include a graphics processing unit (GPU), a global positioning system (GPS) and a cellular modem integrated into a single package. It has software included that operates graphics, video and picture-taking. There are 23 different Snapdragon processors under the 200, 400, 600, 700, and the 800 product families spanning from low to high-end respectively, as well as wi-fi and mobile charging products. Some of their components include the Adreno graphics processing, the Qualcomm Hexagon DSP and processors using Qualcomm's S4 processor architecture. In addition to smartphones, the 400 series is used in smart watches and the 602A is intended for electronics in cars. The current Snapdragon naming scheme was implemented after the Snapdragon 800 family was announced at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show; prior models were renamed to the 200, 400 or 600 series. A new Snapdragon 600 was also released, which by mid-year was embedded in most new Android devices. The 400 family is entry- level, the 600 is mass-market or mid-range, and 800 family is for high-end or flagship phones. Snapdragon 410 Snapdragon 600 (model APQ8064) The Snapdragon 805 was released in November 2013. The 410, which is intended for low-cost phones in developing nations, was announced the following month. In January 2014, Qualcomm introduced a modified version of the Snapdragon 600 called 602A that is intended for in-car infotainment screens, backup cameras, and other driver assistance products. The quad-core Snapdragon 610 and eight-core 615 were announced in February 2014. The Snapdragon 808 and 810 were announced in April 2014. The Snapdragon 835, announced in November 2017, is the first Qualcomm SOC that is built on a 10 nm architecture. Qualcomm's new flagship chip for 2018, the 845, was announced in December 2017. According to Qualcomm, the 845 is 25-30% faster than the 835. In February 2015, Qualcomm re-branded its stand-alone modem products under the Snapdragon name; they were distinguished from SoCs using the \\"x\\" designation, such as the X7 or X12 modem. The first Snapdragon modem for 5G networks, the X50, was announced in October 2016. This was followed by the 2GBs X24 modem on a 7 nanometer manufacturing process that was announced in February 2018. According to CNET, Windows phones were growing in US market share and ranked highly in CNET reviews due to their responsiveness. Snapdragon SoCs are also used in most Windows phones and most phones entering the market in mid-2013. The LG G2 was the first phone to market using the Snapdragon 800 in August 2013. In 2017 the 660 and 630 replaced the 653 and 626 mid-range models and several chips in the 400 product family were revved. In February 2017, Qualcomm introduced the Snapdragon X20, intended for 5G cell phone networks, and two new chips for 802.11ax commercial wi-fi networks. This was followed by the addition of the 636 to the 600 product family that October, which Qualcomm said would be 40 percent faster than the 630. In August 2018, the Snapdragon 632, 439 and 429 were released. The new SoC is aimed at mid-range devices such as the Moto G6 Play, Huawei Honor 7A and Nokia 5. In December 2018, Qualcomm announced the 8cx at their Snapdragon Tech Summit 2018. The 8cx is Qualcomm's first SoC specifically designed for Always Connected PC (ACPC) platform. Unlike Qualcomm's past ACPC SoCs which were just their respective mobile SoCs at higher TDP. Qualcomm also showcased their Snapdragon X50 5G modem, Snapdragon 855 and QTM052 mmWave Antenna Module. In February 2019, Qualcomm announced their Snapdragon X55 5G modem, QTM525 mmWave antenna module, QET6100 envelope tracker and the new QAT3555 antenna impedance tuner. In July 2019, Qualcomm announced a refresh of the Snapdragon 855, the Snapdragon 855+, which is essentially an overclocked version of the 855 with both faster CPU and GPU performance. In December 2019, Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon X52 5G modem alongside the Snapdragon 765 and Snapdragon 865. In May 2020, Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon 768G mobile platform which is a direct successor to the Snapdragon 765G and features the same architecture with some major performance improvements. =Benchmark tests= Benchmark tests of the Snapdragon 800's processor by PC Magazine found that its processing power was comparable to similar products from Nvidia. Benchmarks of the Snapdragon 805 found that the Adreno 420 GPU resulted in a 40 percent improvement in graphics processing over the Adreno 330 in the Snapdragon 800, though there were only slight differences in processor benchmarks. Benchmarks of the Snapdragon 801 inside an HTC One found a \\"bump all around\\" in benchmark improvements over the 800. In 2015, Samsung's decision not to use the Snapdragon 810 in its Galaxy S6 had a significant detrimental impact on Snapdragon's revenues and reputation. Benchmark tests by Ars Technica confirmed rumors that the 810 under-performed lower-end models and had overheating issues. A Qualcomm spokesperson said these tests were done with early versions of the 810 that weren't ready for commercial use. An updated version was released and was found to moderately improve thermal throttling, GPU clock speeds, memory latency, and memory bandwidth when tested in a commercial product, the Xiaomi Mi Note Pro. Additionally, the 820/821, 835 and 845 performed substantially better. Qualcomm led the industry in sustained GPU performance and perf/W from the release of the 820 until the release of the Apple A12.

In some states, functional dualism is manifested trough the division of power between two main branches of government (legislative and executive). In other, mainly complex states, structural dualism is expressed as a division of power between two constitutive units. Functional dualism is common in parliamentary systems, like those in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Sweden, where the term dualism is used to refer to the functional separation of powers between the cabinet and parliament. Unlike the presidential system, the legislative branch consists of the cabinet together with the parliament and cabinets are formed on basis of a majority in parliament. Unlike the Westminster parliamentary system, cabinet ministers cannot be members of parliament. An important political issue is whether ministers and leaders of governing parliamentary parties should prepare important political decisions. According to the dualistic position, members of parliament of governing parties should function independently of their cabinet. The term monism is used to refer to a stance that important decisions should be prepared by the members of the governing coalition in order to promote political stability. Dual structure of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy (1867) Structural dualism is manifested in those dual states, like dual monarchies, that are constituted as real unions. One of the most notable examples of state dualism in modern history was the Austro- Hungarian Monarchy (1867-1918), were dualism was manifested as an official political doctrine of co-equality between Austria and Hungary. The phrase \\"during dualism\\" () is used in Hungarian historiography as shorthand for \\"during the Dual Monarchy.\\" Trialism As in dualism, same functional and structural distinctions are also manifested in trialistic political concepts, referring to three instead of two political subjects. In functional trialism, distinction between three main branches of government (legislative, executive and judicial) is emphasized, while structural trialisam refers to internal political structure of triune states. In history, one of the most notable examples of trialism was manifested as a political concept that advocated transformation of the dual Austro-Hungarian Monarchy into a triune state, by creating a third constituent entity.

In 1295 he was created knight in Rovigo by marquis Azzo VIII d'Este and was married to Catherine of Ortenburg, a family with whom his father wanted to create commercial ties. In the 1280s he was frequently sent by his father in diplomatic missions to Friuli and, in 1301, Rizzardo shared with his father the lordship of Treviso, succeeding him after his death in 1306. In 1307 Rizzardo re-married to Giovanna Visconti. Two years later, he forced the Patriarch of Aquileia to flee to Venice and then obtained from him the title of capitano generale of Friuli. However a revolt in Udine had Rizzardo to flee in turn. Seeing his eastwards expansion had failed, he sided with the Ghibelline party, gaining from emperor Henry VII the title of Imperial Vicar. However, this deprived him of the support of the Venetian doge and of the traditionally Guelph Trevisan nobility. Rizzardo was also missing the administrative capabilities and the charisma of his father. On April 5, 1312, while playing chess, Rizzardo was fatally wounded in the loggia of his palace. Dante Alighieri accused the city's nobles of the feat.

The ability to reinterpret and reconstruct for improved clarity and readability is also a component of critical reading. The identification of possible ambiguities and flaws in the author's reasoning, in addition to the ability to address them comprehensively, are essential to this process. Critical reading, much like academic writing, requires the linkage of evidential points to corresponding arguments. As acknowledged by a number of scholars and wordsmiths, > \\"...a story has as many versions as it has readers. Everyone takes what he > wants or can from it and thus changes it to his measure. Some pick out parts > and reject the rest, some strain the story through their mesh of prejudice, > some paint it with their own delight.\\" > ‚Äî John Steinbeck, The Winter of Our Discontent (1961) There are no simple relations between these levels. As the \\"hermeneutic circle\\" demonstrates, the understanding of single words depends on the understanding of the text as a whole (as well as the culture in which the text is produced) and vice versa: You cannot understand a text if you do not understand the words in the text. The critical reading of a given text thus implies a critical examination of the concepts used as well as of the soundness of the arguments and the value and relevance of the assumptions and the traditions on which the text is given. \\"Reading between the lines\\" is the ability to uncover implicit messages and bias. Symptomatic reading Thurston (1993, p. 638) introduces the concept of \\"symptomatic reading\\": \\"Symptomatic reading is used in literary criticism as a means of analyzing the presence of ideology in literary texts. French Marxist philosophers Louis Althusser and √âtienne Balibar develop the technique of symptomatic reading in Reading Capital\\". Dorfman and Mattelart later used symptomatic reading as a means of analyzing the presence of imperialist ideology in Disney comics. The reciprocal nature of reading and writing When you read, you have to seek information, and you are confronted with different views, which forces you to consider your own position. In this process, the reader is converted to a \\"writer\\", whether or not he writes or publishes his own ideas. Reading and writing are thus reciprocal processes, reading is an active process, and the best way to learn critical reading is probably by training academic writing. Charles Bazerman (1994) writes about the active role of the reader, and remarks (p. 23): \\"The cure for real boredom is to find a more advanced book on the subject; the only cure for pseudo-boredom is to become fully and personally involved in the book already in front of you\\". Bazerman's book is informed by an advanced theoretical knowledge of scholarly research, documents and their composition. For example, chapter 6 is about \\"Recognizing the many voices in a text\\". The practical advises given are based on textual theory (Mikhail Bakhtin and Julia Kristeva). Chapter 8 is titled \\"Evaluating the book as a whole: The book review\\", and the first heading is \\"books as tools\\". Epistemological issues Basically critical reading is related to epistemological issues. Hermeneutics (e.g., the version developed by Hans- Georg Gadamer) has demonstrated that the way we read and interpret texts is dependent on our \\"pre-understanding\\" and \\"prejudices\\". Human knowledge is always an interpretative clarification of the world, not a pure, interest-free theory. Hermeneutics may thus be understood as a theory about critical reading. This field was until recently associated with the humanities, not with science. This situation changed when Thomas Samuel Kuhn published his book (1962) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, which can be seen as an hermeneutic interpretation of the sciences because it conceives the scientists as governed by assumptions which are historically embedded and linguistically mediated activities organized around paradigms that direct the conceptualization and investigation of their studies. Scientific revolutions imply that one paradigm replaces another and introduces a new set of theories, approaches and definitions. According to Mallery; Hurwitz & Duffy (1992) the notion of a paradigm-centered scientific community is analogous to Gadamer's notion of a linguistically encoded social tradition. In this way hermeneutics challenge the positivist view that science can cumulate objective facts. Observations are always made on the background of theoretical assumptions: they are theory dependent. By conclusion is critical reading not just something that any scholar is able to do. The way we read is partly determined by the intellectual traditions, which have formed our beliefs and thinking. Generally we read papers within our own culture or tradition less critically compared to our reading of papers from other traditions or \\"paradigms\\". A famous example The psychologist Cyril Burt is known for his studies on the effect of heredity on intelligence. Shortly after he died, his studies of inheritance and intelligence came into disrepute after evidence emerged indicating he had falsified research data. A 1994 paper by William H. Tucker is illuminative on both how \\"critical reading\\" was performed in the discovery of the falsified data as well as in many famous psychologists \\"non-critical reading\\" of Burt's papers. Tucker shows that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research blindly accepted Cyril Burt's research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They wanted to believe that IQ is hereditary and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. This paper thus demonstrates how critical reading (and the opposite) may be related to beliefs as well as to interests and power structures.

In the early 1970s, she returned to Brazil and selected six sites in the Lagoa Santa area, where the Danish paleontologist Peter Wilhelm Lund had dug a century earlier. She found a rock shelter at site IV where in 1974-1975 she discovered most of the fat bones of what was named Lapa Vermelha IV hominid 1, the oldest human fossil in Brazil, around 11 thousand years old. The skull was given the nickname Luzia. \\"Shortly after that, Annette Laming-Emperaire too died tragically. She went on a vacation in 1976 to the Brazilian state of Paran√°, and was asphyxiated in her shower by a defective gas heating element.\\"Dewar, Bones: Discovering the First Americans, p. 269 After her death, work at the site ceased until her assistant Andre Prous (who became a professor at UFMG) returned to Lapa Vermelha IV in 1979 to take over the project.Weber, \\"Lagoa Santa sites (Minas Gerais, Brazil)\\" A memorial by a colleague called her \\"un des esprits les plus riches et les plus f√©conds de la recherche pr√©historique fran√ßaise\\" ['one of the richest and most fertile spirits of French prehistoric research'].Lavall√©e, \\"Annette Laming-Emperaire,\\" p. 224 The passage of the French researcher at region of Lagoa Santa, which includes, in addition to Lagoa Santa and Pedro Leopoldo, the municipalities of Matozinhos, Capim Branco, Vespasiano, Confins, Funil√¢ndia and Prudente de Morais, are at the Archeology Center Annette Laming Emperaire (Caale), of the Municipality of Lagoa Santa, in operation for 35 years. In Annette's team were researchers from the National Museum, where thousands of ceramic, lytic fragments and bones found in the excavations. The Franco-Brazilian mission in Lagoa Santa, under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco), remained in the region between 1974 and 1976 and concentrated the excavations mainly in the Lapa Vermelha de Pedro Leopoldo. It was in this cave that Annette found \\"Luzia\\". In 1998, the \\"first Brazilian\\", as it entered the history, gained a face. When surveying collections of fossils in the museum, anthropologist Walter Neves, from the University of S√£o Paulo (USP), made in-depth studies on the bones and provided the dating, which is 11,400 years. One of the great merits of the Franco-Brazilian mission, according to experts, was to rescue in the world scientific scenario the importance of Lagoa Santa, where Dr. Lund, in more than four decades, collected more than 12 thousand fossils, which were sent in 1845, to the King of Denmark. After Lund, the region, in the Lagoa Santa C√°rstica Environmental Preservation Area (APA C√°rstica), only attracted new glances in the 1950s, when researchers from the Minas Gerais Academy of Sciences and the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro resumed the excavations.

Career  Williamson had shown interest in joining the legendary Temptations music group since 1994. In an effort to help sign a fellow Vegas group to a label, Williamson's manager Dave Wallace introduced Williamson to long-time Temptations vocalist Ron Tyson. After listening to Williamson sing, Tyson mentored him and tried to have Williamson become a member of the Temptations for over a decade. Williamson later explained, \\"Otis Williams was initially against me joining the group, because he thought I was too big and too young,\\" but Williams eventually relented allowing him to enter the group. Many of the Temptations' fans learned of Williamson's entry after former member G.C. Cameron told a New York City radio station that he was leaving the group to continue his solo career. Williamson has been quoted as saying that he had done \\"more in six months of being a Temptation than many artists have done in a lifetime.\\" Williamson appeared on the group's recent albums, Back to Front and Still Here, and has participated in many public events with the Temptations including countless concerts, TV appearances, and a cameo in Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. Williamson left the Temptations in 2015 citing weight problems and wanting to record a gospel album. He was replaced by former Tower of Power vocalist Larry Braggs.  Personal life and death  Born and raised in Los Angeles, California on September 29, 1970, Bruce started singing in church at a young age. Williamson's love for music began after experiencing jealousy over his cousin's frequent choir leads. Having sung gospel music for most of his life, he also began singing R&B; music in local clubs. Williamson later took his talent to the famous Las Vegas Strip, fronting the popular cover, funk band, BlackBerry Jam. In August 2020, Williamson was diagnosed with COVID-19 after having recovered from gall bladder surgery. He died on September 6, 2020, in Las Vegas from complications of COVID-19, three weeks before his 50th birthday.

All three versions are set in the Canadian wilderness. Portions of Rudolf Friml and Herbert Stothart's original score for the Broadway musical are utilized in both the 1936 and 1954 films. Although the original plot was changed, and most of the songs were dropped, the 1936 film was a huge success and became MacDonald and Eddy's best-known film. Their duet of \\"Indian Love Call\\" was a major hit for the two singers and remained a signature song throughout their careers.Bloom, Ken and Vlastnik, Frank. Broadway Musicals: The 101 Greatest Shows of all Time. Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers, New York, 2004. Plot Marie de Flor (Jeanette MacDonald) is a Canadian soprano performing in Rom√©o et Juliette in Montreal; the Premier of Quebec is in the audience. Inviting him and his entourage to supper after the performance, she learns from a 'half-breed' man called Boniface (George Regas), that her brother Jack (James Stewart), supposedly in prison for armed robbery, was wounded as he escaped from prison and has killed a Mountie in the process. Making her excuses, she leaves for the Canadian wilderness with Boniface, hoping to help Jack. At the same time, Sergeant Bruce, of the Mounties (Nelson Eddy) reports to headquarters and receives his latest mission: he must find Jack Flower, believed to be hiding near Lake Chibougam. Marie and Boniface reach an outpost near Lake Chibougam, where Boniface disappears with Marie's money. Marie falls in with Sergeant Bruce, but Marie cannot tell him the truth for fear of compromising Jack. Marie tries singing at a local cafe to earn some money, but is unused to such boisterous singing and fails to attract any tips. Bruce insists that Marie reports Boniface's theft, but she cannot admit her real identity, calling herself 'Rose'. But Bruce has recognised her via her voice. They travel together to an Indian ceremony that night. Bruce, despite his strong sense of duty, proves to be a womaniser, and they sing together. Marie finds Boniface and they leave together. But Bruce has discovered that 'Rose Marie de Flor' is really Jack Flower's sister and sets off after her, knowing that she will lead him to Jack. Boniface and Marie travel on horseback to Hayman's Landing where Jack is hiding. Sergeant Bruce, following her, rescues her from drowning as they cross a deep river and Boniface runs off into the forest. Marie haughtily refuses the Sergeant's help, but realises that she will not reach Jack without that help. She and the Sergeant travel together for the next three days, before she leaves him with a new guide. Marie finds Jack being nursed by Boniface's mother, and tries to persuade him to reform. She gives him the money necessary to escape and start over. But Bruce appears and arrests Jack. Marie begs him to let her brother go, but the Sergeant is unmoved by her plea. No more is heard of Jack, but Marie, although unwell, returns to opera performance. She has the title role in the opera Tosca. She keeps imagining that she hears \\"Indian Love Call\\" throughout the opera and collapses onstage just before the final curtain. She retires to a mountain lodge and refuses to sing for six months. Her manager, Myerson, visits and tells her how disappointed he is not to hear her voice again. After he leaves, she begins singing \\"Indian Love Call\\". Myerson urges Sergeant Bruce, who has been waiting in the foyer, to join her, and they sing together.

The film was originally slated to be in color but makeup man Fred Phillips explained that when this was dropped, the studio ordered him to change Eddy's makeup for the worse. Phillips stated that orders came from Louis B. Mayer, who was angry at Eddy for his personal involvement in MacDonald's life. Reception The New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent enthused that \\"this is Miss MacDonald's and Mr. Eddy's picture\\", a \\"musical feast\\" in which \\"whether singing solo or in duet, they prove to be fully as delightful a combination here as they were in the film of Victor Herbert's 'Naughty Marietta'\\".

Life and work  A general's son, Veselovsky studied privately with Fyodor Buslaev and attended the Moscow University from 1854 to 1858. After a brief stint in Spain as a tutor to the Russian ambassador's son, Veselovsky continued his education with Heymann Steinthal in Berlin and Prague and spent three years working in the libraries of Italy. Upon his return to Russia, he delivered lectures in Moscow and St. Petersburg and was elected a Member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1876. Veselovsky's early studies of medieval Italian literature led him to believe that many plots and literary devices were imported to Europe from the Orient through Byzantium. Looking at literature primarily from a genetic point of view, Alexander Veselovsky and his brother Aleksey (1843-1918) attempted to construct a comprehensive theory of the origin and development of poetry. In 1899, Veselovsky famously argued that \\"the font and syncretic root of poetic genres\\" may be traced to ritualized popular games and folk incantations.Eleazar Meletinsky. The Poetics of Myth. Routledge, 1998. Page 139.  Influence  In the Soviet Union, Veselovsky and his followers were criticized for their \\"ethnographism\\", which allowed \\"source study to grow to a hypertrophied degree, thus dissolving the specific character of the literary work into a collection of influences\\".Rachel Polonsky (English Literature and the Russian Aesthetic Renaissance. Cambridge University Press, 1998. Page 17) quoting: Jauss, Hans Robert. Toward an Aesthetic of Reception. University of Minnesota Press, 1982. On 14 August 1946 the Central Committee of the Communist Party adopted a resolution specifically condemning \\"kowtowing\\" to the bourgeois West by the so-called Veselovskyists.Mikhail Bakhtin, Rabelais and His World. Indiana University Press, 1984. Page XX. The Russian Formalists largely shared a critical view of Veselovsky's theory, although it has been suggested that Veselovsky's doctrine was actually a point from which they evolved \\"in a linear, if polemical, way\\".Dragan Kujundzic. The Returns of History: Russian Nietzscheans After Modernity. SUNY Press, 1997. Page 8. Although his work has been largely forgotten by Western scholarship (probably due to lack of translations), Veselovsky has been called \\"one of the most erudite and original scholars Russia has produced\\"Gogol from the Twentieth Century: Eleven Essays, ed. Robert A. Maguire. Princeton University Press, 1974. Pages 39-40. and \\"the most remarkable representative of comparative literary study in Russian and European scholarship of the nineteenth century\\".Rachel Polonsky (English Literature and the Russian Aesthetic Renaissance.

It carries US 167 for all of its length, but also carries US 71 and LA 28 for some distance also. It follows the original routing of LA 3026 for some distance, as the highway has been extended over time. It also serves as a bypass around the residential areas of Pineville and Tioga. History Construction of the Pineville Expressway began in 1963. It would later be incorporated into US 167. It originally carried four lanes of LA 3026 across the Red River on a lift bridge, carrying the highway along a railroad line, past Louisiana College, and around Pineville to meet US 165. Later in the 1970s, the Pineville Expressway connected north, bypassing Tioga and ending just south of the Grant Parish line. U.S. 167 and U.S. 71 were rerouted onto this alignment, with the old road through Tioga becoming LA 3225. Exit list Louisiana Highway 3026 Louisiana Highway 3026 (LA 3026) was a state highway in Louisiana that served Rapides Parish. Running from Pineville to Tioga, it has been superseded by US 167. LA 3026 began at an intersection with LA 28, which took over the lower half of the Pineville Expressway. LA 3026 was the slow extension of the Expressway, built in segments to meet US 165, and was pushed forward to meet US 71 and US 167.

He previously played for the New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox. Robertson played college baseball for the Alabama Crimson Tide. He was drafted by the Yankees in the 17th round of the 2006 MLB draft and made his MLB debut with the Yankees in 2008. Robertson was a member of the Yankees team that won the 2009 World Series. He was named an MLB All-Star in 2011. After Mariano Rivera retired, Robertson served as the Yankees' closer in 2014. He signed with the White Sox as a free agent after the 2014 season and was traded back to the Yankees in July 2017. Robertson signed with the Phillies as a free agent after the 2018 season. High school and college career Robertson was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and played his first three years at Central-Tuscaloosa High School in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He was a two- year starter for the Falcons at shortstop and pitcher. He helped lead his team to back-to-back area titles, as well as back-to-back 6A State Playoff appearances. After his junior year, Central High School was split into three smaller high schools, and Robertson attended Paul W. Bryant High School in Tuscaloosa, graduating in 2004. He led the Stampede to an area title and the Class 6A State Playoffs in the school's first year of existence. Robertson enrolled at the University of Alabama and played college baseball for the Alabama Crimson Tide. As a freshman in 2005, Robertson appeared in a team-high 32 games with three games started. He compiled a 7‚Äì5 win-loss record with eight saves and a 2.92 earned run average (ERA), and set the single-season rookie record for most strikeouts (105). He led the Southeastern Conference (SEC) by limiting hitters to a .183 batting average.

On August 28, the Yankees optioned him back to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre with an earned run average of 6.31. He was recalled back to the MLB on September 13. He appeared in 25 MLB games in 2008, going 4‚Äì0 with a save and a 5.34 ERA, and 51 strikeouts in 34 innings, averaging 13.1 strikeouts per nine innings. 2009 After starting the 2009 regular season in Triple-A, Robertson was recalled to the MLB on April 16, to replace Xavier Nady, who had been placed on the 15-day disabled list. The next day he was optioned back to Triple-A to open a roster spot for Juan Miranda. On May 25, he was again recalled to the MLB, to replace reliever Brian Bruney. Robertson finished the season 2‚Äì1 with a save and a 3.30 ERA and 63 strikeouts in innings, averaging 13.0 strikeouts per nine innings (among pitchers with at least 40 innings pitched, the second-best ratio in the MLB behind Jonathan Broxton (13.50)). In the 2009 playoffs, Robertson entered two games in high- pressure situations with multiple runners on base, once in the ALDS and once in the ALCS, and managing to escape each inning without letting any runs score. Robertson received the win in each of those games. The Yankees won the 2009 World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies. 2010 Robertson finished the 2010 season with a 4‚Äì5 record, one save, a 3.82 ERA, and 71 strikeouts in innings, averaging 10.4 strikeouts per nine innings.

Robertson lost out to Joba Chamberlain to be the seventh inning specialist whom manager Joe Girardi wanted to bridge to Soriano and closer Mariano Rivera. Injuries to Feliciano, Soriano, and Chamberlain put Robertson in the eighth inning setup role, where he had 55 strikeouts halfway through the season. Robertson was named to the 2011 American League All-Star roster, replacing David Price. Robertson finished his breakout 2011 season 4‚Äì0 with a save, 34 holds (tied for the AL lead), leading the league in ERA (1.08), along with a 13.5 strikeouts per nine innings ratio (second in the AL, and the highest ratio by a Yankee reliever in franchise history), and an MLB-leading adjusted ERA+ of 410, in 70 games pitched (fifth in the AL). He finished the season with 100 strikeouts (leading all AL relievers) in innings, becoming the first Yankee reliever since Rivera (in 1996) to record 100 strikeouts in a single season. He struck out the 300th batter of his career in career innings on June 24, making him the third-fastest pitcher in major league history to reach that mark after Billy Wagner () and Brad Lidge (). He received one point in the voting for both the AL Cy Young Award (the only non-starter or non- closer to receive a vote) and AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award (the only reliever to receive a vote). Robertson also won the This Year in Baseball Setup Man of the Year Award. 2012 In January 2012, the Yankees and Robertson agreed on a one-year non-guaranteed contract worth $1.6 million, plus another $25,000 in incentives. When Rivera went down with a season-ending injury in May 2012, Girardi announced that Robertson and Soriano would share the duties of closing games for the remainder of the season. Robertson himself was placed on the 15-day disabled list however on May 15, after he strained a muscle in his rib cage, 12 days after Rivera's season-ending injury. He returned to action on June 15, but after several appearances became the setup man for Soriano. Robertson finished the 2012 season 2‚Äì7 with a 2.67 ERA and 2 saves and 30 holds (tied for third in the AL) in 65 games, with 81 strikeouts in innings, averaging 12.0 strikeouts per nine innings. 2013 Robertson in 2013 In 2013, Robertson served as the eighth inning setup reliever behind Rivera. He appeared in 70 games, going 5‚Äì1 with three saves and 33 holds (second in the AL) and a 2.04 ERA and 77 strikeouts in innings, averaging 10.4 strikeouts per nine innings. 2014 Rivera retired after the 2013 season. During spring training in 2014, Robertson was named the Yankees' closer. On April 7, Robertson was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a groin strain. Robertson had a successful season in 2014 as he was 4‚Äì5 and compiled a 3.08 ERA, was successful on 39 (3rd in the AL) out of 44 save attempts, and struck out 96 batters in innings, averaging 13.4 strikeouts per nine innings. In his lone season as Yankees' closer, Robertson garnered praise as a worthy successor to Rivera. He was paid $5.215 million in 2014. On November 10, Robertson declined the Yankees' $15.3-million qualifying offer for the 2015 season, making him a free agent. =Chicago White Sox= After the 2014 season, Robertson became a free agent. He subsequently agreed to a four-year, $46 million contract with the Chicago White Sox.  2015  Robertson during his tenure with the Chicago White Sox in 2015 Robertson served as the White Sox closer during his tenure in Chicago. In his first season with the White Sox, Robertson compiled a 6‚Äì5 record with 34 saves (sixth in the AL), a 3.41 ERA, and 86 strikeouts in innings, averaging 12.2 strikeouts per nine innings. He blew seven saves, but struck out 34.4% of batters and lowered his walk rate to a career-best 5.2%, averaging 1.8 walks per nine innings. He limited the first batters he faced to a .100 batting average, the lowest rate in both the AL and in White Sox history.  2016  In his second season as the White Sox closer, Robertson earned 37 saves (fourth in the AL), pitching to a 5‚Äì3 record and 3.47 ERA while striking out 75 batters in innings, averaging 10.8 strikeouts per nine innings. Robertson suffered seven blown saves, with his walk rate rising (4.62 BB/9).  2017  Robertson pitched for the gold-medal-winning Team USA in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. With the White Sox in rebuilding mode, Robertson became enshrouded in trade rumors during the offseason and regular season. Robertson was nearly traded to the Washington Nationals for Jesus Luzardo and Drew Ward; however, the deal was not completed due to disagreements regarding finances. In 2017 for the White Sox Robertson had a 4‚Äì2 record with 13 saves and a 2.70 ERA, and 47 strikeouts in innings,, averaging 12.8 strikeouts per nine innings, before getting traded to the Yankees. =Return to the New York Yankees=  2017  Robertson in 2017 On July 18, 2017, the White Sox traded Robertson, Todd Frazier, and Tommy Kahnle to the New York Yankees for Blake Rutherford, Tyler Clippard, Ian Clarkin, and Tito Polo. In his first appearance after the trade, Robertson struck out the side in the seventh inning to preserve a 5‚Äì1 lead against the Seattle Mariners.

Pitching style With an overhand delivery, Robertson throws a four-seam fastball typically at 92‚Äì93 mph. Robertson's main off-speed pitch is a curveball in the low 80s. Infrequently, he throws a circle changeup to left-handed hitters in the mid-high 80s. Although Robertson's fastball speed is not unusually high, his long stride toward home plate during his delivery appears to \\"add\\" 2 mph to his fastball by shortening the ball's time in flight. His fastball also has a \\"natural cut\\" to it, making it appear as if he is throwing a cut fastball. Robertson has always had a high walk rate (about 1 every 2‚Äì3 innings over his career), but this is mitigated by an outstanding strikeout rate; Robertson has averaged at least one strikeout per inning in every year of his career so far. His high strikeout rate has proved useful in critical late-inning situations ‚Äî in 2011, Robertson struck out 14 of the 19 hitters he faced with the bases loaded and allowed only one hit.

It is regularly requested by top orchestras and conductors for large and varied projects.  History  In 1812 the Handel oratorio Alexander's Feast (Timotheus) was performed in the Winter Riding School of the Vienna Imperial Palace, an event which led to the founding of the Society of Music Friends in Vienna (Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Wien). The first choral activities of the Musikverein go back to the initiative of Antonio Salieri, for example, taking part in the First Performance of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis and the Symphony No. 9 in 1824. The choir was founded in its present form in 1858. The first choir master was Johann von Herbeck until his transfer to the Vienna Court Opera. The Singverein has been substantially involved in many first performances from Schubert‚Äôs musical play Die Verschworenen (The Conspirators), Johannes Brahms‚Äô A German Requiem, Anton Bruckner‚Äôs Te Deum, Gustav Mahler's Symphonie No. 8 and Franz Schmidt‚Äôs Das Buch mit sieben Siegeln up to composers of the second post war period, like Gerd K√ºhr, Christian Muthspiel, Arvo P√§rt, Wolfram Wagner and Otto Zykan. Since its foundation the Singverein has been partner of important conductors, among them Franz Schalk, Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Karl B√∂hm and Leonard Bernstein. From 1947 to 1989 Herbert von Karajan defined the profile of the choir and made it known worldwide through recordings, concert film productions on laser disc. Concert tours took the choir to Australia, Japan and the USA; further concerts among others were in Israel, Athens, Berlin, Budapest, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Moscow, Munich, Paris, Pisa, Rome, and Zurich. In 1959 a performance of the Bruckner Te Deum took place in the Vatican, as well as in 1985 a performance of the Mozart Coronation Mass during the High Mass with Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Basilica under Karajan.  Choir masters  The first choir master Herbeck was followed by Johannes Brahms, then from mid-twentieth century Ferdinand Grossmann, Reinhold Schmid and Helmut Froschauer. Since 1991 Johannes Prinz has been the choir master engaged by the Vienna Musikverein.

He was the leading architect in the Dumfries area, from the 1820s until his retirement.Colvin, Howard, (1978) A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600‚Äì1840, John Murray, pp.697-699 He trained James Barbour who succeeded him as principal architect in the region. Career Newall began his design career in partnership with an upholsterer and a cabinet maker in the Dumfries firm of Newall, Hannah and Reid. Nothing is known of any architectural training, although Howard Colvin suggests that his knowledge of up-to-date styles points to time spent with an architect of standing. Throughout his working life he lived mainly in Dumfries, travelling around Dumfriesshire, Kirkcudbrightshire and Wigtownshire in the course of his work. His papers show him to have made tours of Germany and Italy, as well as parts of England, notably Oxford, Cambridge and Fonthill. The architects John Edgar Gregan (1813‚Äì55), William Reid Corson (1821‚Äì86), his brother George Corson (1829‚Äì1910) and James Barbour (1834‚Äì1912) all served as apprentices under Newall. Newall died at Craigend, New Abbey, on Christmas Day, 1863. An extensive archive of Newall's sketchbooks, drawings and plans have survived and were purchased by Dumfries Museum in the spring of 1991. Newall is buried in St. Michael's Churchyard, Dumfries. Works His built works included villas at Cardoness (1828), for Sir David Maxwell, Baronet, and Glenlair, Corsock (1830), home of mathematician and theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell. In Dumfries, Newall built the Assembly Rooms (1825), several commercial buildings including offices for his own use on the High Street, and several private houses including Moat Brae (1823), whose gardens, a childhood haunt of author J. M. Barrie, were the inspiration for Peter Pan. Newall remodelled a windmill in neoclassical style to serve as the town observatory, which later became Dumfries Museum. He designed St Mary's Church and clergy house at New Abbey built in 1824. He also designed several Gothic churches, including those at Buittle (1818‚Äì19), Anwoth (1826‚Äì27), and Kirkpatrick Durham (1849‚Äì50). His Greek Revival-style villas were admired by J. C. Loudon, and Hannahfield (later called Ladyfield West), on the Nith south of Dumfries (the only Category A-listed building by Newall, but which has sadly not 'enjoyed' statutory protection) featured in his Encyclopaedia of Cottage, Farm, Villa Architecture (1834).

Kalinga Airlines' DC-3s were also used to drop supplies at North Eastern India. In 1953, the airline, along with other seven independent domestic airlines including Deccan Airways, Airways India, Bharat Airways, Himalayan Aviation, Indian National Airways, Air India and Air Services of India was nationalised and merged into the Indian Airlines Corporation.

Perry claims that the singer has ignored her rights in respect of her registered Australian trade mark, and despite being fully aware of those rights, the singer has been using \\"KATY PERRY\\" as a trade mark in Australia to sell clothes and other goods of the same description. Perry alleges that the singer's mark \\"KATY PERRY\\" is substantially identical or deceptively similar to her mark \\"KATIE PERRY\\" which is registered in class 25 for clothes, and thus, that the singer has infringed her registered trade mark.‚ÄòDavid and Goliath battle‚Äô: Singer Katy Perry sued by Australian fashion designer Katie Perry, The Daily Telegraph, published 11 November 2019 References External links * Katie Perry website Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Australian fashion designers Category:British emigrants to Australia Category:Naturalised citizens of Australia Category:People from the London Borough of Camden Category:People from Sydney Category:Fashion designers from London ","title":"Katie Perry"},{"id":"18182300","text":"Mark Farmer (22 May 1962 ‚Äì 26 April 2016) was an English actor and musician.

Formerly, it had been a nunnery founded by French queen Marie Leszczy≈Ñska. However, after the French Revolution, it became a school in 1803. In 1888, the school was named \\"Lyc√©e Hoche\\" after the French general Lazare Hoche who was born in Versailles. Together with Lyc√©e Henri-IV, Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand, Lyc√©e Saint-Louis, Lyc√©e Stanislas and Lyc√©e Sainte-Genevi√®ve, the Lyc√©e Hoche is one of the most prestigious schools in France for undergraduate education. Each year, scores of students coming from its preparatory classes are admitted to France's most renowned graduate schools, such as the √âcole Polytechnique, the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, HEC Paris and ESSEC Business School. Admission to Lyc√©e Hoche is very competitive; the strict selection process is based on academic grades, drawing from middle schools (for entry into high school) and high schools (for entry into the preparatory classes) throughout France. Its educational standards are highly rated and the working conditions are considered optimal due to its demanding recruitment of teachers. Students generally achieve excellent results; topping national rankings for baccalaur√©at grades in high school and entry into the best grandes √©coles in the preparatory classes.

Ship history The iron-hulled ship was built at the Robert Duncan & Co. shipyard in Port Glasgow for the Anchor Line, to operate on the trans-Atlantic route. She was launched on 1 March 1869, and sailed on her maiden voyage on 8 May, sailing from Glasgow, and calling at Moville in County Donegal, Ireland, before heading across the Atlantic to New York City. =Sinking= Cambria departed New York on 8 October 1870 under the command of Captain John Carnighan, carrying a general cargo, a crew of 74, and 105 passengers, on only her twelfth Atlantic crossing. Around 11.00 pm on 19 October the ship was sailing in heavy seas when she struck Tor Beg rock, half a mile north-west of Inishtrahull Island, which is about 6 miles north-east of Malin Head. Lifeboats were launched, but the only survivor was a passenger named John M'Gartland. He had left the ship aboard a lifeboat with about 15 other passengers. The boat almost immediately capsized and all the occupants were thrown into the sea. When M'Gartland regained consciousness he found himself clinging to the boat, which had righted itself. After climbing back into the boat and he found no one aboard except the corpse of a lady passenger dressed in black silk. M'Gartland drifted for several hours before being rescued by the SS Enterprise. Four lifeboats were found empty at the Giant's Causeway, while the stern of the ship drifted ashore at Islay, Scotland.

The assessment is usually the first stage of a treatment process, but psychiatric assessments may also be used for various legal purposes. The assessment includes social and biographical information, direct observations, and data from specific psychological tests. It is typically carried out by a psychiatrist, but it can be a multi-disciplinary process involving nurses, psychologists, occupational therapist, social workers, and licensed professional counselors. Purpose =Clinical assessment= A psychiatric assessment is most commonly carried out for clinical and therapeutic purposes, to establish a diagnosis and formulation of the individual's problems, and to plan their care and treatment. This may be done in a hospital, in an out-patient setting, or as a home-based assessment. =Forensic assessment= A forensic psychiatric assessment may have a number of purposes. A forensic assessment may be required of an individual who has been charged with a crime, to establish whether the person has the legal competence to stand trial. If a person with a mental illness is convicted of an offense, a forensic report may be required to inform the Court's sentencing decision, as a mental illness at the time of the offense may be a mitigating factor. A forensic assessment may also take the form of a risk assessment, to comment on the relationship between the person's mental illness and the risk of further violent offenses. =Medico-legal assessment= A medico-legal psychiatric assessment is required when a psychiatric report is used as evidence in civil litigation, for example in relation to compensation for work-related stress or after a traumatic event such as an accident. The psychiatric assessment may be requested in order to establish a link between the trauma and the victim's psychological condition, or to determine the extent of psychological harm and the amount of compensation to be awarded to the victim. Medico-legal psychiatric assessments are also utilized in the context of child safety and child protection services. A child psychiatrist's assessment can provide information on the psychological impact of abuse or neglect on a child. A child psychiatrist can carry out an assessment of parenting capacity, taking into consideration the mental state of both the child and the parents, and this may be used by child protective services to decide whether a child should be placed in an alternative care arrangement such as foster care. History A standard part of any psychiatric assessment is the obtaining of a body of social, demographic and biographical data known as the history. The standard psychiatric history consists of biographical data (name, age, marital and family contact details, occupation, and first language), the presenting complaint (an account of the onset, nature and development of the individual's current difficulties) and personal history (including birth complications, childhood development, parental care in childhood, educational and employment history, relationship and marital history, and criminal background). The history also includes an enquiry about the individual's current social circumstances, family relationships, current and past use of alcohol and illicit drugs, and the individual's past treatment history (current and past diagnoses, and use of prescribed medication). The psychiatric history includes an exploration of the individual's culture and ethnicity, as cultural values can influence the way a person and their family communicates psychological distress and responds to a diagnosis of mental illness. Certain behaviors and beliefs may be misinterpreted as features of mental illness by a clinician who is from a different cultural background than the individual being assessed. This assessment also includes information from related people. Mental status examination The mental status examination (MSE) is another core part of any psychiatric assessment. The MSE is a structured way of describing a patient's current state of mind, under the domains of appearance, attitude, behavior, speech, mood and affect, thought process, thought content, perception, cognition (including for example orientation, memory and concentration), insight and judgement. The purpose of the MSE is to obtain a comprehensive cross-sectional description of the patient's mental state. The data are collected through a combination of direct and indirect means: unstructured observation while obtaining the biographical and social information, focused questions about current symptoms, and formalized psychological tests. As with the psychiatric history, the MSE is prone to errors if cultural differences between the examiner and the patient are not taken into account, as different cultural backgrounds may be associated with different norms of interpersonal behavior and emotional expression. The MSE differs from a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) which is a brief neuro-psychological screening test for dementia. Physical examination A thorough physical examination is regarded as an integral part of a comprehensive psychiatric assessment. This is because physical illnesses are more common in people with mental disorders, because neurological and other medical conditions may be associated with psychiatric symptoms, and to identify side effects of psychiatric medication. The physical examination would include measurement of body mass index, vital signs such as pulse, blood pressure, temperature and respiratory rate, observation for pallor and nutritional deficiencies, palpation for lymph nodes, palpation of the abdomen for organ enlargement, and examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological systems. Physical investigations Although there are no physiological tests that confirm any mental illness, medical tests may be employed to exclude any co-occurring medical conditions that may present with psychiatric symptoms. These include blood tests measuring TSH to exclude hypo- or hyperthyroidism, basic electrolytes, serum calcium and liver enzymes to rule out a metabolic disturbance, and a full blood count to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease. The investigation of dementia could include measurement of serum vitamin B-12 levels, serology to exclude syphilis or HIV infection, EEG, and a CT scan or MRI scan. People receiving antipsychotic medication require measurement of plasma glucose and lipid levels to detect a medication-induced metabolic syndrome, and an electrocardiogram to detect iatrogenic cardiac arrhythmias. Assessment tools Clinical assessment can be supplemented by the use of symptom scales for specific disorders, such as the Beck Depression Inventory for depression, or the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for psychotic disorders. Scales such as HoNOS or the Global Assessment of Functioning are used to measure global level of functioning and to monitor response to treatment. Multidisciplinary assessment Psychiatric assessment in hospital settings is typically a multidisciplinary process, with contributions from psychiatric nurses, occupational therapists, psychologists and social workers. A psychiatrist takes a history and carries out a mental state examination and physical examination as described above. A nursing assessment includes risk assessment (risk of suicide, aggression, absconding from hospital, self-harm, sexual safety in hospital and medication compliance), physical health screening, and obtaining background personal and health information from the person being admitted and their carers. The immediate purpose of the nursing assessment is to determine the required level of care and supervision, and to have a plan to manage disturbed behavior. Assessment could include a visit to the person's home, for direct observation of the social and living environment. The role of a psychologist includes the use of psychological tests: structured diagnostic instruments such as the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory or psychometric tests such as the WISC or WAIS, to assist with diagnosis and formulation of the person's problems. A psychologist might contribute to the team's assessment by providing a psychological formulation or behavioral analysis, which is an analysis, through systematic observation, of the factors which trigger or perpetuate the presenting problems. Other perspectives This article describes the assessment process within a medical model, with the collection of supposedly objective data, identification of problems, formulation of a diagnosis leading to a specific treatment, but there are other approaches to the assessment of people with social and emotional difficulties. A family therapy or systemic therapy approach is not concerned with diagnoses but seeks to understand the problem in terms of relationships and communication patterns. The systemic tradition is suspicious of the objectivity of medical assessment, sees the individual's account as a subjective narrative, and sees diagnosis as a socially constructed phenomenon. From a solution focused perspective, the assessment deliberately avoids identification of problems, and seeks to elicit strengths and solutions.

Her plays include Bonkers, Addictions, The Last Journey and musical Change The Day. Early life Born in RAF G√ºtersloh, Germany, Walsh-Smith was part of a military family which travelled the world until her RAF father's death when she was twelve. She then settled briefly in her mother's hometown of Beverley in East Yorkshire, England. Walsh-Smith attended the Italia Conti Academy from the age of fifteen. Career Walsh-Smith appeared in over five hundred commercials on British and European television, including as a schoolgirl in the commercial for Hellmann's Mayonnaise. Her television and film roles include the British horror film, Terror (1978), Kenny Everett Video Show, Constant Hot Water, Dick Emery and the children's television drama, Grange Hill. She has written the play Bonkers which premiered in London in 1987. Walsh-Smith's play, Addictions, has been used at a number of benefit readings to raise awareness and generate charitable giving for addicts. In 2007, Walsh- Smith cancelled one production of the play after learning that Smirnoff Vodka had become a sponsor. She said: \\"I was absolutely stunned. I couldn't believe it. The idea of having Smirnoff sponsoring this play, which is about addiction ‚Äì what were they thinking? ... If we had gone ahead, I would have been looked at as a total hypocrite.\\" In December 2008, Walsh-Smith released the song \\"I'm Going Bonkers\\" on iTunes. Its video featured her in bondage gear and dancing around London. The video went viral and quickly became YouTube's number one entertainment video. Walsh-Smith has previewed many of her comedy songs at nightclubs in London and at the O2 Arena and some of the songs were featured in the 12-part television series Pineapple Dance Studios, which aired in 2010 on Sky1 in the UK. The series was popular and after initially indicating that a second series would be produced, Sky1 reverted this decision due to failing to come to terms with studio owner Debbie Moore. In 2011, Walsh Smith appeared in Louie Spence's Showbusiness, also on Sky1. For this series, she made two music videos: \\"Stuff Ding Dong Merrily On High!\\" for the Christmas Special; and \\"Should I Go In The Jungle?\\", which was reportedly a lampooning of the ITV1 series, \\"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\\". Episode Ten featured a workshop of her musical, Change The Day. Pineapple Dance Studios was sold around the world and aired on the US network Ovation in 2014. Walsh-Smith has appeared as a guest on The Insider (CBS), Good Morning America, (ABC), Inside Edition, (CBS), Geraldo, (Fox), Extra, (NBC), The Jeff Probst Show, (CBS), Sunrise (Channel 7), Access Hollywood, (NBC), Harry Hill's TV Burp, (ITV), The Noughties, (BBC Three), and On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. Personal life She met her first husband John Obertelli in 1975 and married him in 1981. They had a son, Jamie. They divorced in 1989. She then had a brief second marriage to American businessman Jerald Arnold. She met her third husband, Philip J. Smith (CEO of The Shubert Organization), at a Park Avenue wedding reception in 1995. The two married in New York City in 1999 and divorced in 2008. Divorce from Philip Smith In April 2008, Walsh-Smith made history and attracted international attention for posting a YouTube video of herself discussing her divorce from her husband, CEO and then president of the Shubert Organization, Philip J. Smith. In the video she stated that she was going to be unfairly evicted from her house and called her husband's secretary on speakerphone saying that she had found, \\"Condoms, viagra and porn ‚Äì what should she do with them\\"? Some legal experts consider this the first known case where a spouse has used YouTube in an attempt to gain leverage over the other in a divorce case. Fox News named the initial video one of \\"The Top 5 Viral Videos of 2008.\\" Walsh-Smith's case generated scrutiny and debate by legal experts on the implications of broadcasting personal issues using media like YouTube. Regarding the legal implications in the divorce case, MSNBC's senior legal analyst Susan Filan told the show, \\"A judge isn't really going to care. In the end, a divorce, as upsetting and emotional as it is, is just a financial transaction. You're trying to make one household go into two. Somebody's going to have to give something to somebody else.\\" On 21 July 2008 a Manhattan judge awarded Philip Smith a divorce from Tricia Walsh-Smith. The judge, Harold Beeler, criticised Walsh-Smith for her YouTube video. \\"She has attempted to turn the life of her husband into a soap opera by directing, writing, acting in and producing a melodrama.\\" Walsh-Smith was unimpressed with the judge's decision, saying that she would be better off in Baghdad.

Defrauded by Giovanni Di Stefano Four of the fraud counts against bogus lawyer Giovanni Di Stefano related to Walsh-Smith. Di Stefano claimed that he could overturn the Walsh- Smith pre-nuptial agreement, and persuaded Walsh-Smith to invest in News of the World online as Walsh-Smith had been a contributor with a weekly column, \\"Livin' an' Lovin' with Tricia Walsh-Smith\\". On 23 March 2012, News International, the paper's former publisher, sued Di Stefano for violating its trademark. On learning that she had been conned, Walsh-Smith set up a fake TV interview with Di Stefano outside the Royal Courts of Justice, in order to challenge him on his fraudulent behavior, and uploaded the video on YouTube. The Scottish Sunday Mail ran a piece headlined; \\"The Devil's Advocate Took me for a Mug.\\" In the article Walsh-Smith said that Di Stefano duped her into handing over more than 100,000 pounds; \\"He got me to invest in an online version of the News of the World after the paper was shut down. He told me Rupert Murdoch was involved but the cash disappeared.\\" (needs registration) Subsequently, Di Stefano complained to the Press Complaints Commission about the article. The Sunday Mail then agreed to print a statement stating, \\"Giovanni Di Stefano has denied ripping off Tricia Walsh-Smith.\\" On 27 March 2013, Di Stefano was found guilty on all four counts relating to Walsh-Smith; nine counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, eight counts of fraud, three counts of acquiring criminal property, two counts of using a false instrument, one count of attempting to obtain a money transfer by deception, one count of obtaining property by deception and one count of using criminal property. He subsequently pleaded guilty to two additional counts: defrauding a couple out of ¬£160,000, including a woman's life savings of ¬£75,000, and stealing ¬£150,000 from a man who had been in a car accident and lost a limb. He was sentenced to fourteen years in prison. On 4 April 2014, eight and a half years were added to Di Stefano's fourteen-year sentence, unless he compensated his victims immediately. The judge who jailed him in March 2013 at Southwark Crown Court, Alistair McCreath, told him to \\"pay back ¬£1.4million forthwith or serve the extra time.\\" He said Di Stefano had no intention of paying and had \\"stuck up two fingers to the court\\".

The World's Assault Rifles. Ironside International Publishers, Inc., 2016. and later for the reduced power Spanish 7.62√ó51mm cartridge). The CETME 58 would become the foundation of the widely deployed German Heckler & Koch G3 battle rifle. Semi-automatic variants were also produced for the civilian market. Development CETME rifle with bayonet The CETME (Centro de Estudios Tecnicos de Materiales Especiales) rifle was designed primarily by the German engineer Ludwig Vorgrimler, who based his design on the experimental German StG 45(M) and the French-made AME 49. The StG45 used a roller-delayed blowback mechanism somewhat similar to the roller-locking system patented by Edward Stecke in the 1930s in Poland and used in the MG 42. The MG42 locking system actually locks completely and requires a short-stroke barrel that travels backward to unlock, compared to the StG45(M) system that never completely locks and does not require a moving barrel. The CETME design inherits the StG45(M)'s fixed-barrel. However, the CETME Model 58 introduced a novel solution to the problem of cartridges sticking in the chamber.The Complete Encyclopedia of Automatic Army Rifles. by A. E. Hartink. Hackberry Press. 2001. pages 119 & 120 That is a fluted chamber, which is horizontal grooves in the chamber, that allows the cartridge cases to float on a layer of gas to aid extraction. The horizontal marking left on spent cartridge cases has become a signature of this design. The requirements for the original design requested the rifle weigh no more than 4.1 kg, an effective range of 1000 metres and a large magazine capacity. This required a very ambitious development of rifle technology to work but the CETME engineers, based on earlier German experiments, believed this was possible by using an unconventional projectile. Thus the 7.92x41mm CETME, CA-001 cartridge was developed and unveiled in 1953. It would be lightweight and elongated to make it aerodynamic, yet fired at normal rifle velocities. The rounds weighed 6.8 grams and had a muzzle velocity of 800 m/s. To allow such a long projectile to be stable in flight, a method was required to achieve proper mass distribution. The solution was that the aluminium core was wrapped around the middle in a copper jacket that was open at both ends, leaving the exposed aluminium core at either end (the core's middle section was compressed to allow the copper jacket to fit without protruding). While such a lightweight bullet would normally be affected by crosswinds compared to a normal weight projectile, the engineers at CETME contended that the bullet's aerodynamic shape minimised this problem. Sources from the time indicate that at 1000 metres, the dispersion characteristics of the bullet were equal to those of normal rifle projectiles despite its light weight. In addition, sources state that at 1000 metres, the projectile could perforate Spanish, Russian, Italian, Czech and German helmets. The bullet reportedly behaved like a standard full metal jacket bullet. The lightness of the projectile meant it had a lower recoil impulse, which was a key objective of the engineers as it would reduce bullet dispersion during fully automatic fire. Later on in development, the Bundesgrenzschutz informed CETME that they were interested in the rifle but requested the cartridge diameter be reduced from 7.92mm to 7.62mm and that the same 41mm cartridge case should be used. This was accomplished after considerable time and effort, with the new round being designated the 7.62x41mm CETME, CA-002. Despite the rifle performing excellently with this cartridge, the Bundesgrenzschutz later stated that they could only adopt it if it was rechambered with the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge due to standardisation agreements and thus the weapon was redesigned for this cartridge, designated by the Spanish as Modelo B. The first prototype rifles fired the same 7.92√ó33mm Kurz round as the StG45, and a variety of experimental 7.92 and 7.62mm cartridges were tested before settling on the 7.62√ó51mm CETME. This round, chosen due to requirements of the then-interested West German Bundesgrenzschutz, was dimensionally identical to 7.62√ó51mm NATO, but with a lighter bullet and powder charge to reduce recoil, making the fully automatic fire more controllable. In December 1956, the West German Bundeswehr received 400 CETME A rifles for intensive trials. Due to the tests performed by the , the ergonomy of the rifle was improved. With feedback from Heckler & Koch, the rifle was able to fire the 7.62 NATO round due to the better quality of its steel. The Model B went on to be the foundation of the widely deployed Heckler & Koch G3 battle rifle. The CETME B rifle in 7.62 CETME was adopted as the Fusil de Asalto CETME Modelo 1958 de 7,62mm by the Spanish Army in September 1957 and its production began in Spain during this year. The CETME series of battle rifles were manufactured in four basic models; the A, B, C and E models. The primary difference in the production models is the modes of fire, the absence of bipod and lighter weight for later models.  Models  CETME prototype. Note: position of rear sight and bi-pod folded back to form fore-stock. Close-up of CETME prototype. Note: position of rear sight and selector markings. Spanish sailor with CETME 58 Model C. = Model A = The Model As were the developmental prototypes. These models were unusual as they fired from the closed bolt in semi-automatic and from the open bolt in full- auto mode. Later production models fire from only the closed bolt. The Model A's are easily identified by the position of rear sight and bi-pod folded back to form fore-stock. In 1954, the rifle saw limited introduction in the Spanish Army. They used the 7.92x41mm CETME cartridge. = Model B = The Model B was the first production model. It had a perforated steel handguard and chambered for the 7.62√ó51mm CETME round. The 7.62 mm CETME differed from the standard 7.62mm NATO round by having a lighter-weight bullet and a smaller propellant charge. The parts for the Model B are for most part interchangeable with the later Model C rifles. The Spanish Army adopted a variant of the Model B re- chambered for the more powerful 7.62√ó51mm NATO round. The Model B could be converted to fire the 7.62mm NATO round if the bolt group and return spring are replaced with that of the Model C. These modified rifles were known as Model 58-64-C and by 1971 all the Spanish CETME B rifles had been upgraded. = Model C = The Model C was a lightweight version that was chambered for the 7.62√ó51mm NATO round and had wooden fore-stocks. The Model C is virtually identical to the Model B. However, certain components had been strengthened to better deal with the increase power of the standard 7.62mm NATO round. It became standard rifle by 1974. = Model E = The CETME Model E replaced the wooden parts of the stock with plastic and the steel components with aluminium. After a short period on the production line, it was discovered that they were weaker than the previous models and that continuous fire deformed the firearms rapidly, and due to this, relatively few were produced and they were quickly discontinued. = Model R = The CETME R was a derivative of the CETME B without buttstock, intended to be used aboard armored vehicles.  Variants  CETME Model L = CETME L and LC = The CETME Model L was a downsized variant of the CETME system, chambered for the 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge. It was adopted by the Spanish Army in 1984 and was in service until it was replaced by the Heckler and Koch G36 rifle in 1999.  Civilian Versions  In the 1960s, the Mars Equipment Corporation of Chicago imported into the USA Spanish-made semiautomatic versions of the CETME B and C rifles. Available accessories included a 1\\" scope mount, a plastic snap-on rifle cover, and the stock CETME magazine loading tool. The model-B rifles included the standard integrated bipod. These rifles can be identified by a large MARS import mark on the right-hand side along with a prominent \\"MADE IN SPAIN\\". They are prized by collectors far above the US-made \\"parts kit\\" rifles. In the late 1990s Century Arms International (CAI) began offering semiautomatic only civilian versions known as the CETME Sporter, which are manufactured from assembled military surplus and US made parts. Although largely built from Model \\"C\\" parts, there have been reports of model \\"B\\" parts in the Model \\"C\\" Century built rifles. Due to the restrictions against importing receivers of select-fire weapons, all receivers for these civilian versions are made in the US. Earlier receivers were of cast aluminum, while later receivers were made from stamped and welded steel. Earlier rifles retained the wood furniture of the originals while later examples were available with Heckler & Koch style composite stocks. Due to state and local laws restricting weapons with assault weapon features, earlier models of the CETME Sporter featured a permanently pinned muzzle brake rather than the original flash hider. After the 1994 Assault Weapons ban expired in 2004, Century produced models with a removable muzzle brake. NATO 7.62√ó51mm ammunition may safely be used in the CETME sporter, while commercial .308 ammunition is not recommended for use due to the tendency of the extractor to tear off the rims of the softer civilian brass. The CETME delayed roller lock design has a violent extraction and ejection process that flings the empty brass far from the weapon. The brass generally cannot be reloaded due to denting during the ejection operation, this is of no consequence when using mil-spec surplus ammunition with Berdan priming.

Elgar's songs In January 1916 Lord Charles Beresford requested Elgar to make songs of some of the verses in Kipling's booklet: Elgar chose four of them, and appropriately set them for four men's voices.Moore, pages 705‚Äì710 Elgar gave different titles to three of the four poems *The Lowestoft Boat used the words of the poem of the same name *Fate's Discourtesy ‚Äì the poem \\"A Song in Storm\\". The words \\"Fate's discourtesy\\" appear in the refrain to all three verses. Edward German set the same poem to music for voice and piano in 1916, giving it the title of the first phrase \\"Be well assured\\". *Submarines ‚Äì the poem \\"Tin Fish\\". *The Sweepers, ‚Äì the poem \\"Mine Sweepers\\".\\"Mine Sweepers\\" is in another small booklet and called \\"Trawlers\\", published in \\"Twenty Poems from Rudyard Kipling\\" The work was dedicated by the composer \\"...to my friend Admiral Lord Beresford\\". The first performance was, at Elgar's suggestion, part of a wartime variety show at the London Coliseum on 11 June 1917, and the singers were baritones Charles Mott (following his performance in \\"The Starlight Express\\"), Harry Barratt, Frederick Henry and Frederick Stewart. The show ran for four weeks with two performances a day and was a great success. In the production the curtain rose on a seaport scene, outside a public house, with the four singers in rough- and-ready merchant-seamen's clothes, seated around a table.Porte, page 201 *\\"Inside the Bar\\" The song Inside the Bar, with words by Sir Gilbert Parker, was subsequently added to the cycle and performed by the same singers at the same theatre exactly two weeks later. The songs were so popular that later that year Elgar conducted the songs around British provincial music-halls (Stoke, Manchester, Leicester, and Chiswick), with Charles Mott (who had been called up) replaced by George Parker. For reasons which Elgar did not understand at the time, when they returned to the Coliseum at the end of that year, Kipling appeared and objected to his songs being performed at music- halls. Kipling was upset by the report that his son John was missing.Foreman, p.209 Elgar's singer, Charles Mott, was later killed in France in May 1918.Foreman, p.321 Recordings * The first recording was made on 4 July 1917, with singers Charles Mott, Frederick Henry, Frederick Stewart and Harry Barratt, and Elgar conducting a 'Symphony Orchestra'.

It was also one of the seven founding members of the International Air Traffic Association, the predecessor of the International Air Transport Association. History A Supermarine Channel with Det Norske Luftfartsrederi in 1920. The first idea to launch a scheduled airline in Norway was put forth at a board meeting in Norsk Aero Klubb (at the time called ) on 27 February 1918. An invitation to purchase shares for NOK 5 million was issued, and by March NOK 3.3 million had been raised. The idea was presented to the public in Tidens Tegn on 2 March, where scheduled services to England, Denmark and the whole coast were presented. Travel times were to be 4 hours and 30 minutes from Oslo (at the time called Kristiania) to Copenhagen, to Bergen in 2 hours and 45 minutes, to Trondheim in 4 hours and to Kirkenes in 17 hours. A route to Stavanger to Aberdeen would be done in 4 hours and 30 minutes.Nerdrum (1986): 28 By about 19 March, the airline had established offices in Prinsensgate in Oslo. It had hired Wilhelm Keilhau as managing director, and Gyth Dehli and Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen as technical consultants. The company had its founding meeting on 25 December 1918, but was not registered until 16 March 1920. In 1918, the company applied for a government grant of NOK 1.3 million to start a postal route between Oslo and Kristiansand, and an international route from Oslo via Gothenburg to Copenhagen. The company was granted NOK 60,000 to operate a trial route between Bergen, Haugesund and Stavanger.Nerdrum (1986): 28‚Äì29 On 28 August 1919, DNL was one of seven airlines which founded the International Air Traffic Association at a meeting in The Hague.Nerdrum (1986): 31 DNL planned to use the island Lind√∏ya outside Oslo as its base, and applied for a 99-year lease from the Oslo Port Authority. They recommended that the application be denied, since it would interfere with ship traffic and there were already negotiations with the state to purchase the island. Yet, the airline was allowed to operate temporarily from Lind√∏ya.Wisting, 1989: 13‚Äì20 In Stavanger, the airline bought land off Hafrsfjord. The company ordered three Supermarine Channel flying boats. The delivery of the planes were delayed and not until 16 August did operations commence, then with Friedrichshafen FF.49C planes owned and operated by A/S Aero. Later, DNL used its ownd planes and crew. One of the aircraft crashed, but without fatalities. On one flight, a drunk passenger tried to choke the pilot Riiser-Larsen, but he managed to fight off the passenger. Operations were terminated on 15 September.Nerdrum (1986): 29‚Äì30 Several problems were encountered, due to weather conditions, mechanical failures of the aircraft, local strikes and delivery problems, so the regularity achieved was a disappointing 94%. Most flights were made with mail only, and only a total of 64 passengers were carried. Additionally the anticipated increase in freight volume did not happen, and towards the end, only around 300 letters were carried per flight. The company was liquidated on 13 December 1920, although this was not completed until 5 June 1923. The owners received 72% of the share capital. Keilhau stated in the 1950s that until then, the company had been the most profitable airline in Norwegian history.

Recordings Roadsongs was released on Sugar Hill Records in 1994, the same year Van Zandt released his final studio album No Deeper Blue, and features live recordings from the mid- seventies through the early eighties. In the liner notes, Van Zandt writes, \\"These songs were recorded over a number of years in joints all over America. I wish I'd written every one. No such luck. This collection represents a lot of love and fun.\\" The fifteen songs range from traditional compositions to songs written by Van Zandt's peers and musical heroes. Foremost of these heroes is Texas bluesman Lightnin' Hopkins, whose songs had been part of Van Zandt's repertoire from the very beginning. \\"I played with him. Visited his house a couple of times,\\" Van Zandt told Patrick Brennan in 1995. \\"I knew Lightnin' when he was a sixty-year old black blues player who came through hard times from wandering around the country and from white people who were ripping him off steadily. So he didn't have much trust in white people. He liked me because I wasn't there to rip him off.\\" In addition to Hopkins, Bob Dylan was a major formative influence on Van Zandt's songwriting, especially The Times Are A-Changin', which the singer described in a 1995 Danish television interview as \\"a collection of very serious songs that make your mind work with a guitar and vocal.\\" \\"Man Gave Name To All Of The Animals\\" originally appeared on Dylan's 1979 album Slow Train Coming. Van Zandt had previously recorded Luther Williams's \\"Fraulein\\", which had been his father's favorite country song, on his classic 1972 album The Late, Great Townes Van Zandt. \\"Indian Cowboy\\" was written by musician Joe Ely who, in the 2004 biopic Be Here To Love Me, recalls first crossing paths with Van Zandt in Lubbock, Texas when he picked the singer up hitchhiking back to Houston from San Francisco in 1971. Van Zandt was carrying only his guitar and a backpack stuffed with records and, as a means of thanking Ely, gave him a brand-new copy of his second album Our Mother the Mountain. \\"I'd never met anybody who'd actually recorded an album before,\\" Ely remembered, \\"and I take the record back to Jimmie Gilmore. We put the record on and we're just mesmerized by it. Ends up we played that record over and over for weeks. It made us rethink what we were doing and what a song was all about.\\" Van Zandt had also been performing Peter La Farge‚Äôs \\"Ira Hayes\\" and the Rolling Stones classic \\"Dead Flowers\\" for many years. Van Zandt's affinity for traditional folk music is represented on Roadsongs as well, with the singer performing \\"Texas River Song\\", \\"Wabash Cannonball\\" and \\"Cocaine Blues\\". Reception Roadsongs was overshadowed by the release of No Deeper Blue the same year, which was Van Zandt's first album of original material since 1987's At My Window, but AllMusic calls the album \\"A snapshot of a true American troubadour doing what he does best: singing about heartbreak in some joint somewhere to folks who know about such things.\\"  Track listing  #\\"Ira Hayes\\" -- (Peter La Farge) 3:45 #\\"Dead Flowers\\" -- (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards) 4:47 #\\"Automobile Blues\\" -- (Lightnin' Hopkins) 5:24 #\\"The Coo Coo\\" -- (T.

She was one of five children of Horatio Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford and Mary Fawkener, daughter of William Augustus Fawkener, sometime envoy extraordinary at St Petersburg and close friend of Empress Catherine. She received no formal education, but was tutored by a governess in French, Greek, Italian and Latin. In 1847, she was embroiled in a scandal when caught in a summerhouse with a notorious rake, George Smythe MP, heir to a peerage. Smythe refused to marry her, and her parents' actions and statements destroyed her reputation. In 1847 she married a cousin twenty years her senior, one Reginald Henry Nevill (d. 1878), a grandson of the 1st Earl of Abergavenny and produced six children, only four of whom survived beyond childhood. She travelled extensively and cultivated a large circle of literary and artistic friends, with a sprinkling of politicians, including James McNeill Whistler, Richard Cobden, Joseph Chamberlain and Disraeli, whom she greatly admired. She was however, never received by Queen Victoria. In 1851 the Nevills acquired a large Sussex property, 'Dangstein' near Petersfield. Dorothy Nevill turned the estate garden into a horticultural landmark. Her exotic plants were housed in seventeen conservatories and were the subject of numerous articles in journals on horticulture. Through her plants she became friendly with both William and Joseph Hooker at Kew, and supplied Charles Darwin with rare plants for his researches. Dorothy was particularly known as an orchid grower, leading to a correspondence with Darwin that began in November 1861 when he wrote to ask for specimens to further his research towards his pamphlet on orchids. Nevill was delighted to comply, and was duly acknowledged with a presentation copy. She kept exotic birds and mammals on the estate, farmed silkworms and maintained a museum of her collections. After her husband's death, when he left all his money to their surviving children to curtail her expenditures, she moved to 'Stillyans' near Heathfield in Sussex which she rented from one of her botanical friends Doctor Robert Hogg.

Known as Clarksburg Road, the highway runs from MD 117 in Boyds north to Stringtown Road between Interstate 270 (I-270) and MD 355 in Clarksburg. MD 121 connects Boyds and Clarksburg in northern Montgomery County. The highway was paved from Clarksburg to Boyds in the early to mid-1910s. MD 121 was extended to north of Clarksburg in the late 1920s and early 1930s. MD 121 was relocated through Clarksburg in the mid-1950s when I-270 was constructed through the area. The highway's northern end was rolled back to MD 355 in the mid-1970s. MD 121 was relocated in Boyds in the mid-1980s. The highway's northern end was moved to its present terminus just north of I-270 when Stringtown Road was constructed in the mid-2000s. In addition to the Boyds- Clarksburg route, MD 121 has also included three disjoint segments in Dawsonville and Germantown. All three of these routes were segments of the original MD 119. Route description View north along MD 121 at MD 117 in Boyds MD 121 begins at a T intersection with MD 117 in the village of Boyds. MD 117 heads west along Barnesville Road and south along a continuation of Clarksburg Road, which passes under CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision next to the Boyds station on MARC's Brunswick Line. MD 121 heads north as a two-lane undivided road that crosses the Tenmile Creek branch of Little Seneca Lake. The highway passes through the hamlet of Burdette and intersects Old Baltimore Road, which provides access to Black Hill Regional Park to the east. On the southern edge of the developed area of Clarksburg, the route comes to roundabouts with Cabin Branch Avenue and the entrance to the Clarksburg Premium Outlets to the southeast of the road. Following this, MD 121 has a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway). Just north of the route's bridge across of the freeway, the highway expands to a four-lane divided highway and reaches its northern terminus where the ramp from northbound I-270 merges onto northbound MD 121. The divided highway continues as Stringtown Road, a county highway that serves as one of the main streets through the developed part of Clarksburg and intersects MD 355 (Frederick Road). History MD 121 northbound south of interchange with I-270 in Clarksburg The first segment of MD 121 was constructed as a macadam road from Clarksburg to north of Tenmile Creek by 1910. The highway was extended south as a macadam road south to Boyds by 1915. Both stretches of the Boyds-Clarksburg road were built by Montgomery County with state aid. In 1929 and 1930, MD 121 was extended north from U.S. Route 240 (now MD 355) as a concrete road along Clarksburg Road to Burnt Hill Road. This concrete road was extended along Burnt Hill Road to Kingsley Road between 1932 and 1934. Washington National Pike (now I-270) was constructed through Clarksburg and the freeway's interchange with MD 121 was built between 1952 and 1954. In conjunction with the freeway construction, MD 121 was relocated west of the center of the village, leaving behind what are now Redgrave Place south of MD 355 and Spire Street north of MD 355. MD 121 was removed from Burnt Hill Road and Clarksburg Road north of MD 355 between 1975 and 1977. Between 1984 and 1987, MD 121 was relocated at its southern end at Boyds due to the construction of Little Seneca Lake. The state highway had previously met MD 117 west of that highway's railroad underpass at a T intersection through which MD 117 formed the east-west primary road through the intersection. MD 121's northern terminus was rolled back to the northern end of the I-270 interchange in 2007 when county-maintained Stringtown Road was completed from the I-270 interchange to MD 355. The disconnected part of Clarksburg Road west of Stringtown Road and south of MD 355 became MD 121A. MD 121 has had three disjoint segments in Germantown and Dawsonville that have never connected with the main Boyds-Clarksburg route. The first segment built was along Sugarland Road near Dawsonville. The concrete road was built from MD 28 south to near Montevideo Road in 1923. The highway was extended south beyond Montevideo Road to near Dry Seneca Creek in 1929 and 1930. Also in Dawsonville, a concrete road was built north from MD 28 along White Ground Road in 1933. The third segment was Schaeffer Road from MD 117 south to near the Maryland SoccerPlex; that highway consisted of macadam and concrete segments built in 1929 and 1930. By 1939, the state highways along Sugarland Road, White Ground Road, and Schaeffer Road were all part of MD 119, a number now used for Great Seneca Highway through Rockville, Gaithersburg, and Germantown. In 1952, White Ground Road and Schaeffer Road were designated MD 121. The following year, Sugarland Road became MD 121 as well. Thus, in 1953, there were four separate portions of MD 121. In 1956, MD 121 along Sugarland Road was transferred to county maintenance. That same year, Schaeffer Road became MD 119 again for a short time until it was turned over to Montgomery County in 1958. The segment of MD 121 along White Ground Road was transferred to county maintenance in 1999 as part of a highway swap to designate Great Seneca Highway as MD 119 (which ironically, was the original number for White Ground Road). Junction list Auxiliary route MD 121A (signed as MD 121) is the designation for the segment of Clarksburg Road that is disconnected from the mainline of MD 121. The highway begins at a cul-de-sac adjacent to MD 121's northern terminus just north of its I-270 interchange. Just north of the cul-de-sac, MD 121A meets the western end of Gateway Center Drive, which links the route with Stringtown Road. The highway continues north to MD 355 (Frederick Road) in Clarksburg, an intersection from which Clarksburg Road continues north as a county highway. MD 121A was assigned in 2007 when MD 121 was cut in two by the construction of Stringtown Road by Montgomery County.

The top right drink is a cappuccino; the others are lattes. A latte with a tulip in the centre, above are two series of hearts, along the bottom a combined rosetta and a series of hearts. Example of a free-poured flat white with feather pattern Latte art is a method of preparing coffee created by pouring microfoam into a shot of espresso and resulting in a pattern or design on the surface of the latte. It can also be created or embellished by simply \\"drawing\\" in the top layer of foam. Latte art is particularly difficult to create consistently, due to the demanding conditions required of both the espresso shot and milk. This, in turn, is limited by the experience of the barista and quality of the espresso machine. The pour itself, then, becomes the last challenge for the latte artist. The term is not reserved to latte coffee only, it also applies for other beverages containing milk foam like cappuccino and hot chocolate.  History  Latte art developed independently in different countries, following the introduction of espresso and the development of microfoam, the combination of crema (which is an emulsion of coffee oil and brewed coffee) and microfoam allowing the pattern; it presumably was initially developed in Italy.David Schomer describes pitcher- shaking in latte art as \\"quite standard in the world of Italian espresso preparation\\", indicating that it was well established in Italy by this time. In the United States, latte art was developed in Seattle in the 1980s and 1990s, and particularly popularized by David Schomer. Schomer credits the development of microfoam (\\"velvet foam\\" or \\"milk texturing\\") to Jack Kelly of Uptown espresso in 1986, and by 1989 the heart pattern was established and a signature at Schomer's Espresso Vivace. The rosette pattern was then developed by Schomer in 1992, recreating the technique based on a photograph he saw from Cafe Mateki in Italy. Schomer subsequently popularized latte art in his course \\"Caffe Latte Art\\". At the same time Luigi Lupi from Italy met Schomer on the internet and they exchanged videos they made on Latteart and Cappuccini Decorati. Luigi Lupi involved and growth up this art and invented the Tulip in Salonnico during an Exhibition in the MUSETTI booth (2004).  Chemistry  Latte art is a mixture of two colloids: the crema, which is an emulsion of coffee oil and brewed coffee; and the microfoam, which is a foam of air in milk. Milk itself is an emulsion of butterfat in water, while coffee is a mixture of coffee solids in water. Neither of these colloids are stable ‚Äì crema dissipates from espresso, while microfoam separates into drier foam and liquid milk ‚Äì both degrading significantly in a matter of seconds, and thus latte art lasts only briefly.  Technique  Leaf Flower Latte art requires first producing espresso with crema and microfoam, and then combining these to make latte art. See microfoam: procedure for how microfoam is made; this article concentrates on the latte art once the foam is made. Before the milk is added, the espresso shot must have a creamy brown surface, an emulsion known as crema. As the white foam from the milk rises to meet the red/brown surface of the shot, a contrast is created and the design emerges. As the milk is poured, the foam separates from the liquid and rises to the top. If the milk and espresso shot are \\"just right\\", and the pitcher is moved during the pour, the foam will rise to create a pattern on the surface. Alternatively, a pattern may be etched with a stick after the milk has been poured, rather than during the pour. Some controversy exists within the coffee community as to whether or not there is excessive focus on latte art amongst baristas. The argument is that too much focus on the superficial appearance of a drink leads some to ignore more important issues, such as taste. This is especially relevant with new baristas.  Styles  The winner of a free-pouring championship creating his signature latte art, that of an angel surfing on waves. There are two main types of latte art: free pouring (pattern created during the pour) and etching (using a tool to create a pattern after the pour). Free pouring is far more common in American caf√©s, and requires little additional time in preparing a drink. = Free pouring = The two most common forms of poured latte art are a heart shape and the \\"rosetta\\" or \\"rosette\\",Both the Italianate rosetta and the Anglicized rosette are used to describe this pattern; compare doppio and double for a double shot of espresso. also known as \\"fern\\" which resembles a type of flower or fern. Of these, hearts are simpler and more common in macchiatos, while rosettes are more complex and more common in lattes. For free pouring, the cup is either kept level or tilted in one direction. As the milk is poured straight into the cup, the foam begins to surface on one side (due to the tilt). The barista then moves the pitcher from side to side as they level the cup, or simply wiggle the spout back and forth, and finishes by making a quick strike through the previously poured pattern. This \\"strike\\" creates the stem portion of the flower design, and bends the poured zig-zag into a flower shape. A more direct pour and less wiggling yields a heart shape, and minor variation (reduced lobes, larger stem) yields an apple shape. More complex patterns are possible, some requiring multiple pours. Some examples of advanced latte art techniques are that of the tulip, wave heart, swan, or even a scorpion.\\"What Is Latte Art?\\", latteartguide.com = Etching = Etching latte art. Etched patterns range from simple geometric shapes to complicated drawings, such as crosshatching, images of animals and flowers, and are generally performed with a coffee stirrer of some sort. Etched latte art typically has a shorter lifespan than free poured latte art as the foam dissolves into the latte more quickly. A crude but quick method with cappuccino is to pour chocolate powder through a metal cutout in which an image, typically a flower, has been incised. This is favoured by chain coffee shops like Costa where speed is of the essence when serving large numbers of clients during peak times.  Variants  Latte art is made by adding microfoam to espresso. Similar patterns, though much fainter, can be achieved by adding microfoam to brewed coffee, as in a caf√© au lait or tea. Alternatively, patterns can be etched in the crema of an espresso, without adding any milk, in order to yield espresso art.

When it began operation in 1991, it was the largest gas-fired steam recovery power plant in the world.\\"Midland Cogeneration Venture\\" EQT Private Equity Funds, Investments Originally designed as the Midland Nuclear Power Plant, the initial design called for two Babcock & Wilcox pressurized water reactors. Reactor one was designed with a 460 MWe rating, and reactor two with an 808 MWe rating. The design called for once-through steam generators (OTSGs) similar to those at Oconee. Consumers Power abandoned the project, which was 85% complete, in 1984 citing numerous construction problems, most notably a sinking foundation. These problems included sinking and cracking of some buildings on the site due to poor soil compaction prior to construction,\\"Response to Request for Information for Environmental Review\\", October 2, 1986 as well as shifting regulatory requirements following the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. The poor soil preparation was then exacerbated when the 880 acre cooling pond was filled to its approximate average depth of 15 feet. This in turn, seemed to raise the water table in and around the site. Construction was also opposed by environmentalists, led by Midland resident, Mary P. Sinclair.Lascari, Tony: \\"Former Midlander, ‚ÄòPioneer for the Environment‚Äô, dies at 92\\" Midland Daily News, January 15, 2011\\"Intervening Nuclear Women\\" A True Blue Progressive, June 14, 2011 By then, 17 years and US$4.3 billion had been invested in the project. Consumers Power, nearly bankrupted by the project, formed a holding company, CMS Energy for it to be a subsidiary of and eventually changed its name to Consumers Energy. Conversion of the plant began in 1986 and was completed at a cost of $500 million, almost twice the original estimate of the nuclear facility. First electrical production occurred in 1990. The plant produces 1,560 Megawatts of electricity for Consumers and 1.35 million pounds per hour of industrial steam for Dow Chemical. The electrical capacity is approximately 10% of the power consumption for the lower peninsula of Michigan. Over time the plant capacity was further up-rated to 1,633 Megawatts and 1.5 million pounds per hour steam. In July 2002, an unused nuclear reactor vessel head from Unit 2 was removed from its containment building for transportation to Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station near Oak Harbor, Ohio, where it replaced a damaged vessel head on a reactor. Consumers owned a 49 percent share in MCV until 2006. Eight other companies owned the remaining 51 percent. In mid-December 2012 Midland Cogeneration Venture was purchased by Borealis Infrastructure. In 2013 the Global Strategic Investment Alliance (GSIA) became a 33% investor. In 2017, Borealis Infrastructure was renamed OMERS Infrastructure Management Inc. Peter (Pete) Milojevic, MCV President and CEO since August 2013, has indicated the company is ready to further expand the electricity capacity of the facility by approximately 800 Megawatts to help replace permanent shutdowns of other generating facilities in the state of Michigan. This would increase MCV's total electricity capacity to about 2,400 Megawatts.

They are an invention of Otto Zobel at AT&T; Corp..Zobel, 1923 They are a generalisation of the m-type filter in that a transform is applied that modifies the transfer function while keeping the image impedance unchanged. For filters that have only one stopband there is no distinction with the m-type filter. However, for a filter that has multiple stopbands, there is the possibility that the form of the transfer function in each stopband can be different. For instance, it may be required to filter one band with the sharpest possible cut-off, but in another to minimise phase distortion while still achieving some attenuation. If the form is identical at each transition from passband to stopband the filter will be the same as an m-type filter (k-type filter in the limiting case of m=1). If they are different, then the general case described here pertains. The k-type filter acts as a prototype for producing the general mn designs. For any given desired bandform there are two classes of mn transformation that can be applied, namely, the mid-series and mid-shunt derived sections; this terminology being more fully explained in the m-derived filter article. Another feature of m-type filters that also applies in the general case is that a half section will have the original k-type image impedance on one side only. The other port will present a new image impedance. The two transformations have equivalent transfer functions but different image impedances and circuit topology. Bandform diagram showing frequency response of a general image filter. The œâc are the critical frequencies (the frequency where cut-off begins) and the œâ‚àû are the poles of attenuation in the stop bands. Mid-series multiple stopband 200px If Z and Y are the series impedance and shunt admittance of a constant k half section and; :Z = Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3 + \\\\dots + Z_N :where Z1, Z2 etc are a cascade of antiresonators, the transformed series impedance for a mid-series derived filter becomes; :Z_{m_n} = m_1Z_1 + m_2Z_2 + m_3Z_3 + \\\\dots + m_NZ_N Where the mn are arbitrary positive coefficients. For an invariant image impedance ZiT and invariant bandform (that is, invariant cut-off frequencies œâc) the transformed shunt admittance, expressed in terms of Zmn, is given by; :Y_{m_n} = \\\\frac {Z_{m_n}} {k^2 + Z^2 - Z_{m_n}^2} :where k = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{Z}{Y}} and is a constant by definition. When the mn are all equal this reduces to the expression for an m-type filter and where they are all equal to one it reduces further to the k-type filter. 2-bandstop mid-series derived m1, m2 filter half-section A result of this relationship is that the N antiresonators in Zmn will transform into 2N resonators in Ymn. The coefficients mn can be adjusted by the designer to set the frequency of one of the two poles of attenuation, œâ‚àû, in each stopband. The second pole of attenuation is dependent and cannot be set separately. =Special cases= In the case of a filter with a stopband extending to zero frequency, one of the antiresonators in Z will reduce to a single inductor. In this case the resonators in Ymn are reduced by one to 2N-1. Similarly, for a filter with a stopband extending to infinity, one antiresonator will reduce to a single capacitor and the resonators will again be reduced by one. In a filter where both conditions pertain, the number of resonators will be 2N-2. For these end stopbands, there is only one pole of attenuation in each, as would be expected from the reduced number of resonators. These forms are the maximum allowable complexity while maintaining invariance of bandform and one image impedance. Mid-shunt multiple stopband 2-bandstop mid-shunt derived m1, m2 filter half-section. Frequency response is equivalent to the corresponding mid-series derived filter By dual analogy, the shunt derived filter starts from; :Y_{m_n} = m_1Y_1 + m_2Y_2 + m_3Y_3 + \\\\dots + m_NY_N For an invariant image admittance YiŒ† and invariant bandform the transformed series impedance is given by; :Z_{m_n} = \\\\frac {Y_{m_n}} {k^2 + Y^2 - Y_{m_n}^2} Simple bandpass section General image bandpass filter, mid-shunt derived The bandpass filter can be characterised as a 2-bandstop filter with œâc = 0 for the lower critical frequency of the lower band and œâc = ‚àû for the upper critical frequency of the upper band. The two resonators reduce to an inductor and a capacitor respectively. The number of antiresonators reduces to two. Image bandpass filter with œâ‚àû1 set to zero and œâ‚àû2 set to correspond to œâc1. If, however, œâ‚àû1 is set to zero (that is, there is no pole of attenuation in the lower stopband) and œâ‚àû2 is set to correspond to the upper critical frequency œâc1, then a particularly simple form of the bandpass filter is obtained consisting of just antiresonators coupled by capacitors. This was a popular topology for multi-section band-pass filters due its low component count, particularly of inductors.Matthaei, p425Bray, p63 Many other such reduced forms are possible by setting one of the poles of attenuation to correspond to one of the critical frequencies for various classes of basic filter.Zobel, pp42-43 See also Filter bandforms: see, low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-stop. *Image impedance *Constant k filter *m-derived filter *mm'-type filter *Composite image filter Notes References :* Zobel, O.

Synthesis  One synthesis uses fluorine and perchloric acid, though the action of ClF5 on water is another method. :F2 + HClO4 -> FClO4 + HF Another method of synthesis involves the thermal decomposition of tetrafluoroammonium perchlorate, , which yields very pure that may be manipulated and frozen without explosions. :NF4ClO4 ->[\\\\ \\\\Delta\\\\ ] NF3{} + FClO4  Structure  Fluorine perchlorate is not analogous to perchloric acid because the fluorine atom does not exist as a positive ion. It contains an oxygen atom in a rare oxidation state of 0 due to the electronegativity of oxygen, which is higher than that of chlorine but lower than that of fluorine.  Safety  FClO4 has a very dangerous and unpredictable series of reactions associated with it, as a covalent perchlorate (chlorine in the +7 oxidation state) and a compound featuring a very sensitive O-F single bond. Small amounts of reducing agent, such as organic compounds, can trigger explosive detonation. Products of these decomposition reactions could include oxygen halides, interhalogen compounds, and other hazardous substances. Accidental synthesis is possible if precursors are carelessly mixed. Like similar covalent fluorides and perchlorates, it needs to be handled with extreme caution.  Reaction  FClO4 is a strong oxidant and it reacts with iodide ion: :FOClO3 + 2I^- -> ClO4^- + F^- + I2 FClO4 can also react with tetrafluoroethylene: :CF2=CF2 + FOClO3 -> CF3CF2OClO3 It may be a radical addition reaction.

One of the plural wives of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, Lightner is credited with rescuing papers that were later published as part of the Doctrine and Covenants from anti-Mormon mobs. Early life Mary Elizabeth Rollins was born April 9, 1818, in Lima, New York, to John D. Rollins and Keziah Keturah Van Benthuysen. She was one of three children. Her father died in a shipwreck on Lake Ontario when she was a child. In 1828, she and her family moved to Kirtland, Ohio, to live with her uncle Algernon Sidney Gilbert. They lived there for two years. During that time, they learned about the church established by Joseph Smith. She was baptized into the church in October 1830. She was lent a Book of Mormon by Isaac Morley for one night. She and her family stayed up late reading it, and she had memorized the first verse by morning. When she went to give the book back to Morley, he was impressed at how much she had read and he let her keep it until she finished. At the time she read the Book of Mormon, Mary was eleven years old. Shortly after she finished reading the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith moved to Kirtland in February 1831. Smith was brought to her home and she received a blessing from him by the laying on of hands. Jackson County In the fall of 1831, she and her family left Kirtland for Independence, Missouri. Here Mary experienced the interpretation of tongues. She interpreted several sermons from other languages. She started working for Peter Whitmer Sr. as a seamstress. She met Governor Lilburn Boggs while working for Whitmer. Boggs tried to convince Mary to leave the church and live with them, but she refused. She recorded that many people persecuted members of the church in Missouri. Mobs destroyed their houses and set fire to their crops. She witnessed the tarring and feathering of Edward Partridge. =Saving papers= Mary also witnessed the tearing down of the printing press in Independence on July 20, 1833. She watched as a mob tore down the building and threw pages of the Book of Commandments into the streets. She and her sister grabbed armfuls of the paper, despite the mob pursuing them. They hid in a cornfield until the mob passed. They turned over the papers to Sister Phelps, the wife of W. W. Phelps. Later, some of the pages were bound and given to Mary. They were later published as part of the Doctrine and Covenants. The members of the church were forced to leave Independence and went to Clay County, Missouri, where Mary began teaching children how to read and write. She taught for two years. Her mother remarried, and Mary lived with her uncle Gilbert until he died in 1834. During this time, she also witnessed the expedition of Zion's Camp, and was reunited with Joseph Smith again. Smith later commented to Mary that in 1834 he received a revelation to marry her as a plural wife. But because of physical separation and distance, Smith did not pursue the marriage. Far West Mary Rollins was married to Adam Lightner on August 11, 1835. He was not a Latter Day Saint. They would go on to have ten children. They moved to Far West, Missouri, to open a store. The couple's first son, Miles Henry, was born in 1836. Towards the end of 1837, they moved to Milford, Missouri, just outside of Far West, to open another branch of the store. They faced persecution in Milford as well. She and her husband were requested to meet with a mob and their leader, a General Clark. They were told that Governor Boggs was going to destroy the city, but that he requested her family and another be safely evacuated first. Mary refused to leave everyone else behind. The next day, the mob took Joseph and Hyrum Smith but did not harm Far West. Mary and her family went to Louisville, Kentucky, to visit Adam's brother, leaving their possessions in Far West. They rented a house there for six months. She was offered work as a seamstress, but refused because the pay was too low. She painted some pictures and sold them, and would go on to give many painting lessons to earn money. Nauvoo Although her family struggled financially, the Lightners traveled through St. Louis, Missouri, on their way to rejoin the Latter Day Saints in Alton, Illinois, where Mary's brother Henry was. On their trip, she taught painting lessons to a woman on board the boat. Mary continued giving painting lessons and found acceptable work as a seamstress when they moved to Farmington, Illinois, where they stayed for two years. They lost their money when their bank failed, and they went to live with Mary's stepfather, Mr. Burt. While their family moved many times, Mary often found work as a seamstress and a painting teacher. Some of her students included Julia Murdock Smith and Sarah Ann Whitney. The Latter Day Saints left the area of Nauvoo, Illinois. Before leaving, Mary recounts that Joseph Smith came to her family and her brother's family and told them to be rebaptized. All were baptized except her husband, who was not a member. Adam said that he did not feel worthy. In February 1842, Mary was sealed to Joseph Smith as a plural wife. In 1843, she was accepted into the women's Relief Society of Nauvoo. Pontoosuc Their family moved to Pontoosuc, Illinois. Joseph Smith was upset by this and told Mary that if they left the church, they would suffer hardships. Her son George died. Mary had her fourth child in May 1843. Shortly after, she became ill with \\"inflammation of the bowels\\". She stayed in bed, and woke up once to find everyone in her household lying on the floor as if they were dead. While she was in bed, lightning had struck the house. She and all members of the family eventually recovered. Men from Pontoosuc sought to kill Joseph Smith in June 1844. They made Mary make a flag for their company. While she refused, they threatened her and she made the flag. This group was part of the mob that attacked Carthage Jail, which resulted in the death of Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum. Mary's family was kept in Pontoosuc for three months and robbed of many of their possessions by these men. Mary became sick again, and doctors said that she would die shortly. She felt the urge to go to Nauvoo to get a blessing from Alpheus Cutler, who worked in the Nauvoo Temple. Her friends and family feared that the trip would kill her, but she insisted on going. She did make it to Nauvoo and received a blessing and felt better within two weeks. Mary received her endowment in the Nauvoo Temple on January 30, 1845. While earning money to make the trip to the temple, she was sewing and got half of a needle stuck in her arm, which doctors couldn't remove in June 1847. Previously, in the fall of 1844, Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball offered themselves as proxy husbands to widows of Joseph Smith. Mary accepted the offer from Young, and she and Young were sealed on May 22, 1845, in the temple. Living in the North After having another son in February 1848, she took a job as a tailor. Her husband had a harder time finding work, and they were offered a job maintaining a hotel in St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin. There Adam and their baby became very sick. Mary's leg swelled and she almost had her leg amputated. She records that she prayed for God to spare her limb. While living there, a man stopped by her house and offered her a medicine that would supposedly heal anything. Uninterested, but in an attempt to get the man to leave, she, her husband and her aunt tasted the medicine. She even gave some to her children. Within moments, they all became ill and two of her children died. The man had given them poison. The man was caught by authorities, but Mary begged them not to hang him. They were going to put the man on trial, but he escaped and was never tried. The family bought a 65-acre farm near Lake St. Croix, Minnesota. However, they faced many hardships and several of their horses died. They accepted a job keeping a three-story hotel in Willow River, Minnesota, and stayed for two years. Mary left to take care of her sister Caroline who was sick and lived in Farmington in 1853; her sister died five weeks later. Mary took some of Caroline's children home with her to raise them. The family later moved to Maine in 1854 and opened their own boarding house. They lost their property in the Civil War. After suffering so many losses, Mary convinced her husband that they should rejoin the Latter Day Saints. Traveling westward After their hotel failed, they moved back to Missouri to Hannibal. After staying only a year, they returned to Minnesota where their tenth child, Adam, was born on October 28, 1862. they boarded the \\"Canada\\" headed for St. Louis on May 25, 1863 and began traveling westward. They were faced by threats from soldiers, Indians and plagues of sickness. They reached Omaha, Nebraska, and met up with other Latter Day Saints from England, South Africa, and Denmark. They traveled across the plains in a wagon company. They arrived in Salt Lake City, Utah on September 15, 1863. Minersville The Lightners settled Minersville, Utah. In 1869, the Relief Society was organized there, and Mary was called to be its president. Mary's mother died in 1877, and Brigham Young died later that same year. After 1880, Adam was unable to find work. Mary wrote to church president John Taylor in September 1881, reporting that she needed financial assistance. In August 1884, Mary went to Salt Lake City to ask for help in person. Adam became ill and died on August 19, 1885. He never joined the church. He left Mary with over $100 in debt. Shortly after her husband's death, Mary's son was convicted of grand larceny. She worked hard to get her son Adam Jr. out of jail; he was released in June 1886. He died four years later. Mary lived the rest of her life destitute. She may have suffered depression. She traveled occasionally to Salt Lake City. She relied on the church to receive money since she was one of Joseph Smith's widows. She did speak at meetings, sharing her life experiences about the early days of the church and her testimony. Mary spoke at the graduation ceremony at Brigham Young University on April 14, 1905. She was promised by Heber C. Kimball before his death that she would see Joseph Smith again during her lifetime. In 1905, she shared that she had been visited by Smith after his death. Mary Rollins Lightner died on December 17, 1913, in Minersville. At the time of her death, she was the last surviving plural wife of Smith. Marriage Mary claimed that Smith had a private conversation with her in 1831, when she was only 12. He told her that she \\"was the first woman God commanded him to take as a plural wife.\\" He approached her in 1834 again; however, she married Adam Lightner on August 11, 1835. She admitted later that she had had dreams of being Smith's wife. She reported that Smith told her that an angel threatened to take away his life unless he followed God's instruction to practice plural marriage. He also predicted that her husband would not join the church and, therefore, she needed to be sealed to a priesthood holder. Mary would not marry Smith until she had received a witness from God for herself. She prayed about the proposal, and reported that she saw an angel pass through her room. Smith then told her that certain events would take place in her life, and they did. Mary consented to be married to Smith, although the sealing did not cancel her marriage to Adam. She was the sixth of Smith's plural wives. They were sealed in February 1842 by Brigham Young. At the time, Mary was pregnant with her son George. Mary mentions that her husband was away at the time of her sealing to Smith, so Adam's consent or knowledge is unclear. Smith's first wife, Emma Smith, knew about the marriage. Mary later reported that she knew that Smith had other children by his plural wives. Mary signed an affidavit in 1902 to document her sealing to Smith. After Joseph Smith's death in 1844, Mary was sealed to Brigham Young. The sealing was performed in the Nauvoo Temple on May 22, 1845. Mary recorded, \\"I was also sealed to Brigham Young as proxy for Joseph.\\" When Mary lived in Minersville, she records that Young stopped by to visit. She wrote to him and updated him on how her family was doing throughout her life. Through correspondence letters between Mary and Eliza R. Snow, it appears that Mary knew and was friendly towards other plural wives of Young. References External links *Mary E. Lightner papers, Vault MSS 363 at L.

Rogerson, 1980, Cambridge University Press The forerunner to the current University of Namibia, UNIN sought to educate Namibians for roles in an independent Republic of Namibia. Background As states across Africa achieved independence, Namibia remained illegally ruled by Apartheid South Africa. Treated as a fifth province, Namibia did not have its own tertiary educational system. Bantu Education, or purposely inferior education for Black Namibians, was the norm education in Namibia for Black Namibians. The United Nations Council for Namibia under Se√°n MacBride put forth a plan in February 1974 for a tertiary educational institution for Namibia in Africa, preferably Zambia. On 26 August 1976 (Namibian Heroes' Day), President of Zambia Kenneth Kaunda formally inaugurated the institute in Lusaka. Funding Funding for UNIN was provided for, on a short-term basis, by the United Nations Fund for Namibia, itself funded by individual government donations and private organizations such as the Ford Foundation.

He became a fencing master, then a director of foil first for Italy, then for Russia. Athletic career With the junior Italy team in 2007: from L to R, Salvatore Di Naro, Valerio Aspromonte, Cerioni, and Martino Minuto Cerioni was born in 1964 in Madrid, where his father was working. His parents moved back to Jesi, in Italy, when he was a child. He learned fencing under Ezio Triccoli, a family friend, who also coached Olympic champions Valentina Vezzali and Giovanna Trillini in their formative years. He practiced both sabre and foil, but foil quickly gained his preference. Cerioni won the silver medal in the 1983 Junior World Championships in Budapest, then the gold medal in 1984 in Leningrad. He made his Olympic d√©but at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He made his way to the semi-finals, where he met teammate Mauro Numa. Despite a 6‚Äì1 lead in the first period he was defeated 11‚Äì9. He fenced Fr√©d√©ric Pietruszka of France in the ‚Äúsmall final‚Äù and prevailed 10‚Äì5 to win the bronze medal. At the World Championships in Barcelona, Cerioni reached the semi-finals, where he was defeated by teammate Andrea Cipressa. He fenced Germany's Harald Stein for the bronze medal, but was disqualified for unsportsmanlike behaviour. His bad temper got the best of him once again in the 1986 World Championships in Sofia: this time he received a full-year suspension after abusing the referees during his bout against Joachim Wendt. After his return to competition Cerioni won the 1987‚Äì88 Fencing World Cup. At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul Cerioni defeated three-time World champion Aleksandr Romankov in the semi-finals, then East Germany's Udo Wagner, to earn the gold medal. The team ranked only 7th. At the 1992 Summer Olympics he was eliminated in the round of 32 and could not defend his title. Italy also failed to earn a medal in the team event. A year later, Cerioni won the gold medal in the 1993 Mediterranean Games and a team silver medal in the 1993 World Championships in Essen, followed by a team gold medal in the 1994 World Championships in Athens. In March 1996 his maestro Ezio Triccoli died. Cerioni took over Club Scherma Jesi while going on with his career, earning a team silver medal at the 1997 World Championships in Cape Town. He retired in 2000 after 16 years in the national team.  Coaching career  Cerioni with the Russian team at the 2014 European Fencing Championships Cerioni became a fencing master after he ended his athlete career. His most famous pupil is Elisa Di Francisca, whom he trained since she was 8. After the 2004 Summer Olympics he succeeded Andrea Magro as director of foil at the Italian Fencing Federation for the men's team. In 2008 his responsibilities were extended to the women's. Under his direction Italy won gold medals in men's team foil and women's team foil and all three medals in women's foil at the 2012 Summer Olympics, amongst which his own student Di Francesca. In December 2012 he announced that he would join the Russian Fencing Federation‚ÄìItaly's main rival‚Äìas director of foil for both men and women, taking with him assistant coach Giovanni Bortolaso and physical conditioning trainer Maurizio Zomparelli. In the 2013 World Championships in Budapest, Italy took the gold medal in men's team foil and two bronze medals in women's foil.

It is no longer managed by the Opera, but instead is part of the Music Department of the National Library of France (Biblioth√®que nationale de France or BnF). The Paris Opera Library-Museum is open daily; an admission fee is charged. Emperor's Pavilion The Library- Museum is housed in the Palais Garnier in the Rotonde de l'Empereur, a pavilion on the west side of the theatre, which was originally designed to be the private entrance for Emperor Napoleon III. Thus, the Emperor's could directly enter in the building and avoid any assassination attempt. The library is located near the intersection of the rue Scribe with the rue Auber, streets which are named after the librettist Eug√®ne Scribe and the composer Daniel Auber, both of whom had works performed by the Paris Opera., originally at the Paris Opera website. Retrieved 3 August 2011. After the Emperor's death in 1873 and the proclamation of the French Third Republic in 1870, President Mac-Mahon refused to use this Pavilion as a private space for the head of state. Charles Nutters succeeded in compelling Charles Garnier to transform the pavilion into a space for the conservation of the Opera's books and archives. The archives and the library From the time of the creation of the Paris Opera in 1669 until the middle of the 19th century there was no official entity in charge of the preservation and management of archival materials produced by the activities of the Opera and its associated theatre. The creation of an archives service and a library was integrated into the project entrusted to the architect Charles Garnier for the construction of a new opera house to replace the Opera's former theatre, the Salle Le Peletier. Thus the current Paris Opera Library-Museum traces its origin to two former services of the Opera, the archives and the library, each created in 1866., originally at the BnF website. Retrieved 3 August 2011. At that time, the Opera director became an entrepreneur. Expenses exceeded the receipts, and the government needed a strong man to run the establishment but was afraid that the archives would be sold to generate money. Around 1863 Charles Nuitter had begun cataloging the Opera's archives, and on 15 May 1866, he became the official archivist. He also published several books on the history of the company.Cooper 1992, p. 635. Th√©odore Lajarte was appointed librarian in 1873 and embarked on the systematic organization of the Opera's scores and instrumental parts. In 1876 he first published his two-volume inventory of the library's holdings covering the period from 1671 to 1876.Huebner 1992. The library (2012) Entrance to an exhibition room The archives and the library were soon merged, and in 1881 augmented with a museum open to the public. In 1899, Nuitter was succeeded by his assistant Charles Malherbe.Lebeau 2001. At first, the Opera Library-Museum was attached to the State Secretariat of the Fine Arts (Secr√©tariat d'√âtat aux Beaux-Arts), but in 1935, it became part of the National Library and in 1942 became a part of the newly established National Library's Music Department. The rooms of the library provide a comfortable environment for work and study, and the staff is knowledgeable and helpful. Much of the library is little changed from its original appearance in the 19th century. Access to the library may be difficult at times (the entrance is through the main foyer of the opera house), and it is advisable to call ahead to confirm the hours when it is open.Simeone 2000, p. 238. Today, the Library conserves around 600,000 documents related to the history of the Op√©ra and the Op√©ra-Comique, including about 100,000 books, 250,000 autograph letters, 16,000 scores, 30,000 libretti, 100,000 photographs, and 30,000 prints. The museum Mus√©e de l'Op√©ra (2011). Dancer Alexandre Kalioujny by Jacques Gestalder The modern museum has five rooms which display three centuries of the Paris Opera's history through paintings, costumes, drawings of scenery, and scale models of set designs. Altogether, the museum conserves 8 500 objects. At the top of the stairs which lead to the museum is a bronze by the sculptor which depicts the dancer Alexandre Kalioujny in mid-leap during a performance of Michel Fokine's ballet which is based on the Polovtsian Dances of Borodin's Prince Igor.This information was translated from the corresponding article in the French Wikip√©dia (version 23 avril 2011 √† 19:27). Visitors are also able to see shelves of books and scores, which are protected by grilles. These materials include fifteen thousand scores and thirty thousand librettos and are accessible to the public on days when the museum is not open for tours. The museum's collections are too extensive to be displayed all at one time, as they consist of approximately 8,500 objects, including 2,500 models of sets, 500 set design drawings, and 3,000 pieces of costume jewelry. The Library-Museum has organized more than 25 exhibitions since 1992, in collaboration with the BnF and others. Some of the items in the collection have also been displayed at the Mus√©e d'Orsay.

He is a supporting antagonist in the story and a rival barber to Sweeney Todd. He is eventually killed by Todd after he threatens him with extortion. Character overview Pirelli is first introduced as an Italian barber, toothpuller, and snake oil salesman who is \\"all the rage\\" in Victorian London. He is very theatrical and dresses in extravagant clothing. Pirelli often abuses his young apprentice, Tobias Ragg, slapping him across the face for the slightest infraction, and often for no reason at all. Pirelli claims to have shaved the King of Naples and the Pope, arrogantly referring to himself as \\"the King of the Barbers and the Barber of Kings.\\" His real name turns out to be Daniel O'Higgins, and he was Sweeney Todd's apprentice as a boy. Pirelli knows Todd's true identity as Benjamin Barker and threatens to expose him unless Todd pays him half of his profits. Todd kills Pirelli in an effort to keep his identity a secret. Fictional character history The main character, Sweeney Todd, and his accomplice Mrs. Lovett are in a square where Pirelli's assistant, Tobias Ragg, is advertising a concoction of his master's entitled Pirelli's Miracle Elixir, which is purported to stimulate the growth of hair. Todd takes one sniff of the mixture and denounces the elixir as \\"an arrant fraud\\" concocted of \\"piss and ink.\\" Enraged, Pirelli emerges from his tent to berate Todd, who offers to wager his own straight razors against five pounds of Pirelli's money. Whoever shaves a person the most quickly and dexterously will win, with Beadle Bamford acting as judge. Pirelli wastes time bragging about his vast talent and superiority over all other barbers. Todd, on the other hand, concentrates on doing the job and, after carefully preparing his razors and mixing the lather, shaves the customer in a matter of seconds to win the five pounds. Pirelli begrudgingly pays him five pounds. The following day, Pirelli and Toby arrive at Mrs. Lovett's Meat Pie Emporium to visit Todd, whose establishment is atop Mrs. Lovett's. While Mrs. Lovett gives Toby a pie downstairs in her parlour, Pirelli ascends the stairs to Todd's room to confront him. Pirelli reveals that his real name is Daniel O'Higgins and he is in fact Irish. He reveals that he knows Todd's true identity as Benjamin Barker, having served as his apprentice as a small boy, and threatens to expose Todd to the Beadle unless he, Todd, pays him half of his profits. Todd, enraged, strangles him and throws his body in a trunk when Tobias enters the shop. While speaking to Tobias, Todd notices that Pirelli's hand is sticking out and feebly moving. After getting rid of the boy, Todd finishes Pirelli off by slashing his throat. Mrs. Lovett later takes his purse, where she finds three pounds, keeping the purse as her own. This scene was changed substantially for Tim Burton's 2007 film adaptation of the musical. In this interpretation, Pirelli is actually a Cockney thief named Davy Collins, rather than the Irish Daniel O'Higgins, and rather than strangling him, Todd bludgeons him into unconsciousness with an iron tea-pot before slitting his throat. Portrayals In the original Broadway production, he was played by Joaquin Romaguera. He was played by John Aron in the 1980 London production. In the 2005 Broadway revival staged by John Doyle, he was played by Donna Lynne Champlin. In Tim Burton's 2007 film adaptation of the musical, he was portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen. Songs In the musical, Adolfo Pirelli sings two numbers by himself and several others with other characters.

He received a gold medal in sabre individual at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. On 11 October 2011, he won the gold medal at the World Championships in Catania, Italy. Biography He is the third generation of his family to win a fencing medal for Italy at the Olympic Games. Aldo initially took up foil, but switched to sabre so he could follow in the footsteps of his grandfather and father. His grandfather, Aldo Montano, won silver medals on the team event in sabre at the 1936 Summer Olympics and the 1948 Summer Olympics. Aldo's father, Mario Aldo Montano, was part of the Italian sabre team that won the gold medal at the 1972 Summer Olympics, and the team silver medals for sabre at the 1976 Summer Olympics, and again at the 1980 Summer Olympics. His uncles (Mario Aldo Montano and Tommaso Montano) were also on the same team as his father (at both the 1972 and 1976 Olympic events). Another uncle, Carlo Montano, won silver in team foil in 1976. Since 2015 he was in a relationship with the Russian track and field athlete Olga Plachina, born in 1996. They got married in 2016 and as of December 2016 are expecting their first child, a girl, who they want to name Olimpia. Achievements Montano is one of the most successful Italian sabre fencers of all time, surpassing the success of his father and grandfather as fencers. He has four Olympic medals, one gold for the individual event in 2004 Summer Olympics, a silver for the team event in 2004 and bronze medals for the team events in 2008 and 2012, respectively. The gold medal bout in 2004 was a \\"thrilling\\" final against Hungary's Zsolt Necsik, with a final score of 15-14. Necsik established an early lead of 5-1, while Montano struggled with a leg cramp. The score remained close during the entire bout, with many close calls, but the final touch by Aldo demonstrated his strength on offense with a powerful redoublement attack. Aldo Montano has also been very successful at the World Championships, having one gold medal, five silver medals and three bronze medals for individual and team events. He also has seven European Championships medals, five of them gold, as well as a gold medal from the 2005 Mediterranean Games.

He was from a Ukrainian Greek Catholic sacerdotal family and nobility with the herbu, de Rogale. Life Mykhailo Levytskyi was born on 17 February 1774on 16 August 1774 according to other sources at Lanchyn, in Pokuttya region, the son of Rev.

He also developed a theory of holors. Biography Moon was born in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, to Ossian C. and Eleanor F. (Parry) Moon. He received a BSEE from University of Wisconsin in 1922 and an MSEE from MIT in 1924. Unfulfilled with his work in transformer design at Westinghouse, Moon obtained a position as research assistant at MIT under Vannevar Bush. He was hospitalized for six months after sustaining injuries from experimental work in the laboratory. He later continued his teaching and research as an associate professor in MIT's Electrical Engineering Department. He married Harriet Tiffany, with whom he had a son. In 1961, after the death of his first wife, he married his co-author, collaborator and former student, Domina Eberle Spencer, a professor of mathematics. They had one son. Moon retired from full-time teaching in the 1960s, but continued his research until his death in 1988. Scientific contributions Moon‚Äôs early career focused in optics applications for engineers. Collaborating with Spencer, he began researching electromagnetism and Amperian forces. The quantity of papers that followed culminated in Foundations of Electrodynamics,Parry Moon & Domina Eberle Spencer, Foundations of Electrodynamics, D. Van Nostrand Co., 314pp. (1960) (ASIN B000OET7UQ). unique for its physical insights, and two field theory books, which became standard references for many years. Much later, Moon and Spencer unified the approach to collections of data (vectors, tensors, etc.), with a concept they coined \\"holors\\". Through their work, they became disillusioned with Albert Einstein's theory of relativity and sought neo-classical explanations for various phenomena. = Holors = Moon and Spencer invented the term \\"holor\\" (; Greek ·ΩÖŒªŒøœÇ \\"whole\\") for a mathematical entity that is made up of one or more \\"independent quantities\\", or \\"merates\\" (; Greek ŒºŒ≠œÅŒøœÇ \\"part\\") as they are called in the theory of holors. With the definitions, properties and examples provided by Moon and Spencer, a holor is equivalent to an array of quantities, and any arbitrary array of quantities is a holor. (A holor with a single merate is equivalent to an array with one element.) The merates or component quantities themselves may be real or complex numbers or more complicated quantities such as matrices. For example, holors include particular representations of: * real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and other hypercomplex numbers; * scalars, vectors and matrices; * (geometric) scalars, (geometric) vectors,and tensors; * non-tensorial geometric arrays of quantities such as the Levi-Civita symbol; and * non-tensorial non-geometric arrays of quantities such as neural network (node and/or link) values or indexed inventory tables. Note that Moon and Spencer's usage of the term \\"tensor\\" may be more precisely interpreted as \\"tensorial array\\", and so the subtitle of their work, Theory of Holors: A Generalization of Tensors, may be more precisely interpreted as \\"a generalization of tensorial arrays\\". To explain the usefulness of coining this term, Moon and Spencer wrote the following: And, as indicated in the promotional blurb on the back of the book, part of the value of holors is the associated notational conventions and terminologies, which can provide a unified setting for a variety of mathematical objects, as well as a general setting that \\"opens up the possibility to devise a holor for a new ... application, without being limited to a few conventional types of holor\\". Although the terminology relating to holors is not currently commonly found online, academic and technical books and papers that use this terminology can be found in literature searches (for instance, using Google Scholar). For example, books and papers on general dynamical systems, Fourier transforms in audio signal processing, and topology in computer graphics contain this terminology. At a high level of abstraction, a holor can be considered as a whole ‚Äî as a quantitative object without regard to whether it can be broken into parts or not. In some cases, it may be manipulated algebraically or transformed symbolically without needing to know about its inner components. At a lower level of abstraction, one can see or investigate how many independent parts the holor can be separated into, or if it can't be broken into pieces at all. The meaning of \\"independent\\" and \\"separable\\" may depend upon the context. Although the examples of holors given by Moon and Spencer are all discrete finite sets of merates (with additional mathematical structure), holors could conceivably include infinite sets, whether countable or not (again, with additional mathematical structure that provides meaning for \\"made up of\\" and \\"independent\\"). At this lower level of abstraction, a particular context for how the parts can be identified and labeled will yield a particular structure for the relationships of merates within and across holors, and different ways that the merates can be organized for display or storage (for example, in a computer data structure and memory system). Different kinds of holors can then be framed as different kinds of general data types or data structures. Holors include arbitrary arrays. A holor is an array of quantities, possibly a single-element array or a multi- element array with one or more indices to label each element. The context of the usage of the holor will determine what sorts of labels are appropriate, how many indices there should be, and what values the indices will range over. The representing array could be jagged (with different dimensionality per index) or of uniform dimensionality across indices. (An array with two or more indices is often called a \\"multidimensional array\\", referring to the dimensionality of the shape of the array rather than other degrees of freedom in the array. The term \\"multi-indexed\\" may be a less-ambiguous description. A multi-dimensional array is a holor, whether that refers to a single-indexed array of dimension two or greater, or a multi-element array with two or more indices.) A holor can thus be represented with a symbol and zero or more indices, such as H^{ij}‚Äîthe symbol H with the two indices i and j shown in superscript. In the theory of holors, the number of indices N used to label the merates is called the valence. This term is to remind one of the concept of chemical valence, indicating the \\"combining power\\" of a holor. (This \\"combining power\\" sense of valence is really only relevant in contexts where the holors can be combined, such as the case of tensor multiplication where indices pair up or \\"bond\\" to be summed-over.) The example holor above, H^{ij}, has a valence of two. For valence equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., a holor can be said to be nilvalent, univalent, bivalent, trivalent, etc., respectively. For each index i, there is number of values n_i that the index may range over. That number n_i is called the plethos of that index, indicating the \\"dimensionality\\" related to that index. For a holor with uniform dimensionality over all of its indices, the holor itself can be said to have a plethos equal to the plethos of each index. (Both terms, valence and plethos, thus help to resolve some of the ambiguity of referring to the \\"dimension\\" of a holor, as well as resolving ambiguity with similar terminology in other mathematical contexts. No special term, however, is provided for the total number of merates, which is another sense of the \\"dimension\\" of a holor.) So, in the special case of holors that are represented as arrays of N-cubic (or hypercubic) shape, they may be classified with respect to their plethos n and valence N, where the plethos is akin to the length of each edge of the N\\\\text{-cube} and the number of merates is given by the \\"volume\\" n^N of the hypercube. If proper index conventions are maintained then certain relations of holor algebra are consistent with that of real algebra, i.e., addition and uncontracted multiplication are both commutative and associative. Moon and Spencer classify holors as either nongeometric objects or geometric objects. They further classify the geometric objects as either akinetors or oudors, where the (contravariant, univalent) akinetors transform as : v^{i'} = \\\\sigma(x^i) {{\\\\partial x^{i'}} \\\\over {\\\\partial x^{i}}} v^i, and the oudors contain all other geometric objects (such as Christoffel symbols). The tensor is a special case of the akinetor where \\\\sigma(x^i) = 1. Akinetors correspond to pseudotensors in standard nomenclature. Moon and Spencer also provide a novel classification of geometric figures in affine space with homogeneous coordinates. For example, a directed line segment that is free to slide along a given line is called a fixed rhabdorGreek ·ø•Œ¨Œ≤Œ¥ŒøœÇ \\"rod\\".}} and corresponds to a sliding vectorA vector whose direction and line of application are prescribed, but whose point of application is not prescribed.}} in standard nomenclature. Other objects in their classification scheme include free rhabdors, kineors, fixed strophors, free strophors, and helissors. More can be said about the relationship between holors and tensors, and how holors may help clarify common confusion about tensors. A tensor is a mathematical object with particular properties, which can be represented as a (potentially multidimensional, multi-indexed) array of quantities‚Äîa tensorial array‚Äîif a basis for the related vector space is chosen for tensors of order greater than zero. A common misconception is that a tensor is simply a multidimensional array‚Äîa kind of generalization of vectors and matrices. But this is not the case (at least in dominant mathematical and physics contexts), since a tensor, when represented as a multidimensional array, must obey certain transformation properties when changing basis vectors or coordinates. So a tensorial array is an array, but an array is not necessarily a tensorial array. In particular, a tensorial array can be a multidimensional array, but a multidimensional array is not necessarily a tensorial array. (This may more sloppily be said as \\"a tensor can be a multidimensional array, but a multidimensional array is not necessarily a tensor\\", where \\"tensor\\" here refers to a tensorial array.) The mathematical term \\"holor\\" was coined in part to help clear up this confusion. Holors, as arbitrary arrays, include tensorial arrays as a special case. Holors can be said to be a generalization of tensorial arrays, in particular because the notation and terminology associated with holors provides a general setting for the algebra and calculus that tensorial arrays are involved in, including providing names and categories for technically non-tensorial objects that tensorial arrays interact with (such as the Levi-Civita symbol and the Christoffel symbols). When encountering the term \\"tensor\\" generally, it may sometimes be more accurate to substitute inequivalent terms such as \\"holor\\" or \\"arbitrary array\\" or \\"multidimensional array\\", depending on the context and potential misusage.

While most other early archosauriforms walked on four limbs, euparkeriids were probably facultative bipeds that had the ability to walk on their hind limbs at times. The most well known member of Euparkeriidae is the species Euparkeria capensis, which was named by paleontologist Robert Broom from the Karoo Basin of South Africa in 1913 and is known from several nearly complete skeletons. The family name was first proposed by German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene in 1920; Huene classified euparkeriids as members of Pseudosuchia, a traditional name for crocodilian-line archosaurs from the Triassic (Pseudosuchia means \\"false crocodiles\\"). However, phylogenetic analyses performed in the 21st century place Euparkeriidae as a group of Archosauriformes, a position outside Pseudosuchia and close to the ancestry of both crocodile-line archosaurs and bird-line archosaurs (which include dinosaurs and pterosaurs). However, they are probably not direct ancestors of archosaurs. Several other species apart from Euparkeria have been assigned to the family, but many are dubious or have been determined to have been placed in the family incorrectly. One study has suggested that Euparkeriidae may not represent a true evolutionary grouping or clade. Instead, the family may represent an evolutionary grade of small archosauriforms (making it paraphyletic) or a group of species that each evolved small body sizes through evolutionary convergence (making it polyphyletic). However, other studies consider the family valid, albeit difficult to diagnose. Euparkeriidae is defined as the most inclusive clade containing Euparkeria capensis but not Crocodylus niloticus (the nile crocodile) or Passer domesticus (the house sparrow).  Description  Life reconstruction of Euparkeria capensis Euparkeriids, as well as several other advanced archosauriformes or early archosaurs (Dorosuchus, Dongusuchus, gracilisuchids) were lightly built and agile terrestrial carnivores which likely competed with cynodonts for food. They had gracile but well-ossified femurs which were capable of, but not well adapted for, bipedalism and cursoriality. Most taxa which can be assigned to Euparkeriidae are incomplete, and shared synapomorphies (defining characteristics) are difficult to assess between members of the family. The only uniting trait observable in Euparkeria, Halazhaisuchus, and Osmolskina (the only genera believed to be valid euparkeriids) relates to their osteoderms. Euparkeriids had two rows of small keeled osteoderms with characteristically pointed anterior processes, although some osteoderms referred to Osmolskina are shorter and blunter than those characteristic of the other genera. Euparkeria and Osmolskina are united by several more traits which may characterize the family but are unknown in the rather incomplete Halazhaisuchus. These include an anterolaterally opening pit on the front of the maxilla, four premaxillary teeth, two exits for the hypoglossal nerve on the exoccipital, and separate interparietals (or postparietals). Osmolskina, Halazhaisuchus, and the dubious (but likely euparkeriid) \\"Turfanosuchus\\" shageduensis form a clade within Euparkeriidae united by the presence of a pronounced tuber on the scapula for the m. triceps. Classification Besides Euparkeria, the most completely known putative euparkeriid is Osmolskina czatkowicensis. Several hundred isolated bones have been found in Poland and referred to this genus. A 2010 phylogenetic analysis found that Osmolskina was more distantly related to Euparkeria than had previously been suspected, although in 2016 it was reinstated as a member of the family. Dorosuchus neoetus, a Russian archosauriform known mostly by hind limb bones, has also been proposed as a possible euparkeriid, but has subsequently been placed outside the family. Three species from China have also been proposed as euparkeriids: Halazhaisuchus qiaoensis, \\"Turfanosuchus\\" shageduensis, and Wangisuchus tzeyii. Sookias et al. (2014) analysed many species that have been considered euparkeriids, finding many outside the group while recovering a slightly supported monophyletic family including \\"Turfanosuchus\\" shageduensis, Halazhaisuchus, and Euparkeria. However, \\"Turfanosuchus\\" shageduensis and Wangisuchus were both also found to be nomen dubium. Their cladogram is shown below. Sookias (2016) also performed another study on Euparkeriidae using both parsimony and Bayesian analysis. This study found Halazhaisuchus, Osmolskina, and \\"Turfanosuchus\\" shageduensis to all be valid members of a monophylectic (albeit poorly supported) Euparkeriidae, and more closely related to each other than to Euparkeria. Dorosuchus was placed outside Euparkeriidae. The strict consensus tree of the parsimony analysis is given below: The Bayesian analysis resolved the trichotomy within Euparkeriidae and recovered Halazhaisuchus and Osmolskina as sister taxa. However, other parts of the tree lost much resolution creating a large polytomy of large groups above Erythrosuchidae.

Staples (born November 2, 1918 in Kanosh, Utah) was a veterinary researcher in animal nutrition and diarheal treatment, and the author of three publications of the Cooperative Extension Service, North Dakota State University. This particular research contributed to the improvement of the livestock industry in the area from the early 1970s to mid-1980s.  Early life  He was the great-grandson of English immigrant George Staples (1834‚Äì1890), the adopted Sioux who is widely credited for making south central Utah hospitable for settlers by befriending many tribes in the area, including Pahvant Ute Chief Kanosh, for whom the town was named. The wife of the original George Staples, Lauraette Rappleye Staples (1840-1916) had died less than two years before his birth, but had so trained the mid-wife who delivered him (and many of the others with medical training in the area) with folk remedies she had learned from the local Utes and numerous pioneer companies in crossing the plains which she and her mother had provided medical assistance a decade before arriving in Kanosh that the birth was uneventful even during the peak of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Staples growing up years were likewise unremarkable for any of his contemporaries growing up at the time‚Äîmuch farm work and local schooling in Kanosh and nearby Millard High School in the county seat of Fillmore, Utah. He attended Utah State Agricultural College at Logan, Utah, produced unremarkable grades, and left early to serve as a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Florida and Georgia from 1939 to 1941, arriving back home in late November of that year. Like so many others of his generation, Staples joined the military shortly after the Pearl Harbor Attack in December 1941 and, after failing to get into the Naval Air Corps, was accepted in Officer Candidate School, served on various vessels for short durations in training and was finally assigned to the as communications officer until the end of the Pacific War. Following his discharge, he graduated from Utah State Agricultural College at Logan, Utah with a B.S. in Animal Science, went on to South Dakota State College of Agricultural & Mechanical Arts at Brookings, South Dakota for his Master's Degree and finally to Colorado A&M; at Ft. Collins, Colorado for his Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine. He worked in private practice at Afton, Wyoming for a few years before landing a field position with the U.S. Department of Agriculture where he was able to work out of his hometown of Kanosh during the peak of the atomic testing in the late 1950s, by which time his family had grown to four sons and a daughter. However, by the end of that decade, some people in that area begin to show symptoms of radiation poisoning and Staples felt it prudent to move his family out in the summer of 1960. The fifth Staples son was born shortly after that move, but died in infancy. His sixth and last son was born in Topeka, Kansas in 1962, where the family had relocated for his employment with Morris Research Laboratories, pioneers in pet nutrition and now part of the Hill's Pet Nutrition Group. Staples' work in the relatively new field attracted the attention of North Dakota State University. He was hired and made the move there December 29, 1964. His unique experience in private practice, USDA field work with livestock diseases and pioneering research in pet nutrition was used to improve the livestock industry in North Dakota. At least one notorious trafficker in diseased cattle was put out of business by the techniques Staples shared in early disease detection and treatment of livestock diseases, particularly calf scours. A major breakthrough to treatment of the disease was put on the market through Staples research shortly after publication of his 1982 publication Calf scours: Causes, prevention, treatment. However, the ingredients were so simple and inexpensive that none of the major pharmaceutical companies felt it profitable to market commercially.  Illness and death  Shortly before his retirement from the university, Staples was diagnosed with myelofibrosis from radiation exposure during his USDA field work more than a quarter century earlier. His eldest son died at age 32 in 1983, Staples died in 1993 and his second son died from the same type of illness in 2003 at age 51.

It originated in the Belgian town of Watermael-Boitsfort (), from which it takes its name, which means \\"bearded [chicken] from Watermael\\". It is closely related to the Barbu d'Anvers, but is distinguished from it by its small, backswept crest of feathers. The Barbu de Boitsfort is a rumpless variation, the only difference being that it lacks the uropygium, the part of the anatomy that carries the tail. History The Barbu de Watermael is among the most recent of Belgian bantam breeds, but its origin is poorly documented. It was created by Antoine Dresse at the estate of La Foug√®res at Watermael-Boitsfort in the early years of the twentieth century, or, according to one source, in 1915. Neither Dresse nor his son ever revealed what breeds contributed to the creation of the Barbu de Watermael, though the contribution of the Barbu d'Anvers is considered certain. Dresse did say that the Polish had not been used; the cranial protuberance typical of that breed is considered a fault in the Barbu de Watermael. The birds were first shown in 1922, but did not achieve great popularity. A breeders' club was formed in France after the Second World War, and another, the , in the Netherlands in 1971. In number, the Barbu de Watermael is today the second bantam breed in Belgium, with a population of 764 in 2010; it was classed as \\"in danger\\" in that year. Characteristics The Barbu de Watermael is one of the smallest of all bantams: males weigh and hens It has a narrow backswept crest, a three-part beard and a unique spined rose comb. It is raised almost exclusively as an ornamental fowl. More than thirty colour varieties are recognised in Belgium. Those usually seen are black, brown red, buff Columbia, cuckoo, quail and white; the other colours are rare, and some are in the hands of only one breeder.

Prior to 1586, Pope Pius V's bull Hebraeorum gens sola (1569) had restricted Jews in the Papal States to Rome and Ancona. The bull was a culmination of Clement VIII's tightening of the anti-Jewish measures of his predecessors which began with his elevation to the papacy in 1592.Toaff, Ariel. 1993. The Jews in Umbria, 1245-1435. Vol. 1. E.J. Brill. p. xxxvii. The bull gave Jews three months to leave the Papal States (with the exception of Rome, Ancona, and the Comtat Venaissin of Avignon). The main effect of the bull was to evict Jews who had returned to areas of the Papal States (mainly Umbria) after 1586 (following their expulsion in 1569) and to expel Jewish communities from cities like Bologna (which had been incorporated under papal dominion since 1569).Foa, Anna, and Grover, Andrea. 2000.

The bull also resulted in the relocation of Jewish cemeteries to Ferrara and Mantua. The bull alleged that Jews in the Papal States had engaged in usury and exploited the hospitality of Clement VIII's predecessors \\"who, in order to lead them from their darkness to knowledge of the true faith, deemed it opportune to use the clemency of Christian piety towards them\\" (alluding to Christiana pietas).Fragnito, Gigliota.

He was primarily known for his architectural partnership with Raymond Unwin. Biography Parker was born in Chesterfield in 1867, the son of bank manager Robert Parker. He trained at T.C. Simmonds Atelier of Art in Derby and the studio of George Faulkner Armitage in Altrincham. In 1891 he joined his father in Buxton and designed three large houses for him there. In 1896 Parker went into partnership with Raymond Unwin, who was Parker's half cousin as well as his brother-in-law, having married his sister Ethel in 1893. One of their earliest commissions was to design and build a large family home on farming land in Clayton Staffordshire, for a local manufacturer of pottery, Charles Frederick Goodfellow. Finished in 1899 the house gave them the opportunity to incorporate many internal and external features including an open, galleried courtyard, and custom furniture and fittings in Arts and Crafts style in many rooms. Originally, as was the custom, named the Goodfellow House, when it was bought in 1926 by another Potteries manufacturer, Colley Shorter (Arthur Colley Austin Shorter, 1882 to 1963) he renamed it Chetwynd House, and that name remains with it to today. Shorter's second wife was the British ceramic designer Clarice Cliff, and it is with her that the house is now most closely identified, as she worked extensively on the large gardens with Shorter for many of her retirement years, and after his death. They collaborated on architectural writing including The Art of Building a Home (1901), applying the Arts and Crafts Movement to working-class housing. In 1902 they were asked to design a model village at New Earswick near York for Joseph and Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree, and the following year they were given the opportunity to take part in the creation of Letchworth, when the First Garden City Company asked them to submit a plan. Two other pairs of architects (W. R. Lethaby & Halsey Ricardo and Geoffry Lucas & Sidney Cranfield) also submitted plans. In 1903 they were involved with the \\"Cottages Near a Town Exhibit\\" for the Northern Art Workers Guild of Manchester. In 1904 after their plan for Letchworth was adopted they opened a second office at Baldock moving to a purpose-built office in Letchworth in 1907. In 1905 they were invited by Henrietta Barnett to design the new Hampstead Garden Suburb, working in association with Edwin Lutyens. Unwin left Letchworth for Hampstead in 1906 leaving Parker to continue the work in Letchworth where, in addition to having a supervision role, the design of some 275 dwellings and a number of public buildings is credited to the Parker & Unwin partnership. In May 1914 the partnership of Parker & Unwin was dissolved, as Unwin became increasingly involved with public sector work. Parker continued his town planning practice, advising on Porto, Portugal in 1915 and S√£o Paulo, Brazil in 1917-1919. From 1927 he advised the Manchester City Council on the development of Wythenshawe, where he had a continuing role until 1941. He died at Letchworth in 1947 at the age of 79. Parker became a Quaker toward the end of his life. Parker was an admirer of the American parkways, notably those in Westchester County, hence the prominence given to Princess Parkway in the Wythenshawe plan. His Presidential Address to the Town Planning Institute in 1929 shows his desire to create parkways in Britain, partly as an answer to the problem of ribbon development on newly built main roads.

Historically, the tribe were the protectors of the sacred Pipestone Quarry for the Oceti Sakowin. The tribe maintains a free-ranging bison herd. Lewis & Clark According to local legend, when Meriwether Lewis learned that a male child had been born near the expedition's encampment in what is today southeastern South Dakota, he sent for the child and wrapped the new born baby boy in an American flag during the council at Calumet Bluff in late August 1804. Lewis declared the baby an American. This boy grew up to become a headman (chief) of the Ihanktonwan Dakota (Yankton Sioux), known as Struck By- the-Ree. However, the journals of the expedition make no mention of this incident. Archery Archery reached an equital technology with the Yankton Sioux. Made from local materials, the tribe used bows and arrows to hunt deer, antelope and small game.

Volume 18 (4). August-September 2010. Pages 22-29. Pressure and land cession By the late 1850s, pressure to open up what is now southeastern South Dakota to white settlement had become very strong. Struck-by-the-Ree and several other headmen journeyed to Washington, D.C., in late 1857 to negotiate a treaty with the federal government. For more than three and a half months, they worked out the terms of a treaty of land cession. The Treaty of Washington was signed April 19, 1858. Returning from Washington, Padaniapapi (Struck-by-The-Ree) told his people, \\"The white men are coming in like maggots. It is useless to resist them. They are many more than we are. We could not hope to stop them. Many of our brave warriors would be killed, our women and children left in sorrow, and still we would not stop them. We must accept it, get the best terms we can get and try to adopt their ways.\\" For about eleven and a half million acres, a payment of approximately $1.6 million in annuities was to paid over the next 50 years. Specific provisions of the treaty called for educating the tribe to develop skills in agriculture, industrial arts and homemaking. This treaty provided for the removal of the tribe to a 475,000-acre reservation on the north side of the Missouri River in what is now Charles Mix County. (Charles E. Mix was the commissioner who signed for the federal government.) The US Senate ratified the treaty on February 16, 1859 and President James Buchanan authorized it ten days later. On July 10, 1859, the Yankton Sioux vacated the ceded lands and moved onto the newly created reservation. Government The tribe's headquarters are in Wagner, South Dakota and it is governed by a democratically elected non-IRA tribal council. Its original constitution was ratified in 1891.Pritzker 341 It is the only Dakota/Lakota tribe in South Dakota that did not agree to comply with the Indian Reorganization Act and retains its traditional government. Officially, the Yankton Sioux Tribe is called \\"Ihanktonowan Dakota Oyate\\" in the local dialect. The Yankton Sioux, or Dakota people, adopted a unique tribal symbol on September 24, 1975. With minor alterations this symbol serves as seal, logo and flag. Crossing the yellow portions of the flag approximately one-third from the bottom is an undulating red line. This symbolizes a \\"prayer\\" to bind the home in love and safety. Red was chosen by designer Gladys L. Moore, a Yankton Sioux from Union Lake (Ibid), Michigan, because it is a symbol of life. The color red was painted around the lower parts of tepees to indicate that those that visited would be fed or that that particular tepee was one of several in which a feast was to be held. Reservation The tribe's reservation is the Yankton Indian Reservation, established in 1853 in Charles Mix County, South Dakota. The tribe has a land base of 36,741 acres.BIA website Most of the tribe moved onto the reservation in the 1860s.Pritzker 340-1 Economic development The tribe owns and operates the Fort Randall Casino and Hotel in Pickstown, South Dakota, and Lucky Lounge and Four Directions Restaurant.\\"Fort Randall Casino.\\" 500 Nations.

In 1930, Gwendolyn Beaufoy published Leaves from a Beech Tree, a history of the Beaufoy family. Career Beaufoy supported the introduction of the eight-hour day for all employees and introduced it in his own vinegar works at Lambeth.By virtue of the Factory Act 1833, the eight-hour day had long been a legal requirement for workers under the age of fourteen. In 1881, he chaired a meeting which founded the Church of England Central Society for Providing Homes for Waifs and Strays, later renamed the Church of England Children's Society, and now known as The Children's Society. The object of the new organisation was \\"to rescue and care for children who are orphaned, homeless, cruelly treated or in moral danger, and to relieve over-burdened homes\\". A Liberal in politics, Beaufoy was elected as member of parliament for the Kennington division of the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth at a by-election on 15 March 1889 and was re-elected at the general election of 1892, holding the seat until 1895.THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONSTITUENCIES BEGINNING WITH \\"K\\" at leighrayment.com, accessed 29 June 2008 He was also a Justice of the Peace. Beaufoy continued his family's support of the City of London School. He also founded the Beaufoy Institute in Black Prince Road, Lambeth (later taken over by the London County Council), to replace a 'ragged school' established by the Beaufoys before 1870. A stone plaque on the Beaufoy Institute reads: \\"This principal stone was laid by Mildred Scott Beaufoy wife of Mark Hanbury Beaufoy, Chairman of Governors, 21 February 1907. F. A.

He had played for Eton College and Cambridge University (although not as a 'Blue' in matches against Oxford). After university he played for the Old Etonians F.C., his most distinguished match being the 1879 FA Cup Final at Kennington Oval when the Old Etonians beat Clapham Rovers 1‚Äì0. At different times he ironically played for Clapham Rovers outside of the FA Cup ties when both clubs were rival competitors. He played in county matches for Surrey. Shooting Beaufoy began to shoot at the age of twenty and became an enthusiast for game shooting, preferring quality of game to quantity. He had his own shoot at Coombe House, near Shaftesbury, in the border country of Wiltshire and Dorset, consisting of about fifteen hundred acres, plus another five hundred which he rented. The land was ideal for pheasant shooting. Beaufoy also ran a second shoot at Ashmore in Dorset.Rose, R. N., The BEAUFOY VERSES, in The Field dated 22 November 1956 online at The BEAUFOY VERSES, accessed 29 June 2008 Throughout the English-speaking world, shooting people are familiar with Beaufoy's verses on gun safety called A Father's Advice.Beaufoy, Gwendolyn, Leaves from a Beech Tree (Oxford, printed for the author by Basil Blackwell, 1930) These begin: at geocities.com/rbeaufoy, accessed 29 June 2008 :\\"If a sportsman true you'd be :Listen carefully to me: :Never, never, let your gun :Pointed be at anyone...\\" Beaufoy had written the verses by Christmas, 1902, when they were given to his fifteen-year-old eldest son, Henry Mark Beaufoy, together with his first gun, a 28-bore. A hundred copies of the verses were printed and given to friends. A Father's Advice quickly became well known in shooting circles, but it was not always credited to Beaufoy.A Father's Advice at ruger-firearms.com, accessed 29 June 2008 The verses appeared in many different publications, sometimes with Beaufoy's permission, more often without it. Gun-makers began to send A Father's Advice out with their cartridges, and a gamekeeper offered the verses to a Sussex magazine, claiming to have written them. It was sometimes said they were by an officer killed in the Boer war, and in a letter to The Sporting Times they were attributed to the Reverend J. L. Browne, an Eastbourne headmaster. Browne replied to say they were not his, and in November 1910 Beaufoy himself wrote in to say he was the author, adding \\"Perhaps they have not been wholly useless ‚Äì if so, I am amply rewarded\\". The verses were highly thought of on the royal shooting estate at Sandringham, and A. S. Gaye translated them into Latin. Kennel Club As a young man, Beaufoy kept mastiffs and bloodhounds and between 1920 and his death in 1922 he served as chairman of The Kennel Club. Marriage and children In 1884, Beaufoy married Mildred Scott Tait, daughter of Robert Tait. They had one daughter, Margaret Hilda (born 1885) and three sons, Henry Mark (1887), George Maurice (1893), and Robert Harvey (1895). Henry Mark Beaufoy, later of Hill House, Steeple Aston in Oxfordshire, became High Sheriff of Oxfordshire in 1944. The youngest son, Robert, lost his left arm during the First World War, but continued with his shooting, going on to become a good one-armed shot. The middle son, George Maurice Beaufoy, was killed on 10 May 1941 when a bomb fell on the family vinegar yard in Lambeth during the Second World War. He was the last of the Beaufoys to manage the business. Honours (civic) *High Sheriff of Wiltshire, 1900London Gazette: no. 27171, page 1520, 6 March 1900. Retrieved on 29 June 2008.

Just applied sustainability  A more refined definition would be called \\"just applied sustainability\\": the just and equitable application of science and innovation, including the social sciences, to ensure a better quality of life for all, now and into the future whilst living within the limits of supporting ecosystems. This comes from the definition of Just Sustainability, which is ‚Äúthe egalitarian conception of sustainable development\\". Jacobs, M., \\"Sustainable Development as a Contested Concept,\\" in A. Dobson, Fairness and Futurity: Essays on Environmental Sustainability and Social Justice (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1999), 32.

Synonymous with applied science The relationship between \\"applied sustainability\\" and sustainability (or sustainability science)The web site of the Forum for Science and Innovation in Sustainable Development Forum for Science and Innovation in Sustainable Development lists Key Overview Documents, Key Journals and Websites, as well as a list of research Institutions and their Programs. is analogous relationship between applied science (engineering) and basic science. Whereas science is the effort to discover, understand, or to understand better, how the physical world works, with observable physical evidence as the basis of that understanding. Applied science is the application of knowledge from one or more natural scientific fields to solve practical problems. Sustainable engineering Applied sustainability is essentially sustainable engineering ‚Äì by utilizing natural laws and physical resources in order to design and implement materials, structures, machines, devices, systems, and processes that meets human need while preserving the environment forever. Applied sustainability is made up of work in engineering, policy, and education ‚Äì whatever methods are necessary to conserve the world for our children.

Clarification regarding terminology  Sustainability, itself, is a term that is often confused because in its most basic form it is a characteristic of a process or state that can be maintained at a certain level indefinitely. When used in the context of development, as sustainable development, it is a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but in the indefinite future.

From the 1950s until the 1970s, he and his younger brother Sandy competed as The Flying Scotts in North American regional promotions including the National Wrestling Alliance, particularly the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic territories, as well as successful stints in the American Wrestling Association, Maple Leaf Wrestling and Stampede Wrestling. Scott was also the longtime head booker for the Jim Crockett Promotions working under promoter Jim Crockett, Jr. during the 1970s and with Vince McMahon during the World Wrestling Federation's national expansion during the early 1980s. He helped organize many of the early PPV events such as WrestleMania I and WrestleMania 2 as well as the early cards for the WWF's weekly television shows Saturday Night's Main Event, Prime Time Wrestling and Superstars of Wrestling. On the Steve Austin Show Unleashed Podcast, Scott was credited by Ric Flair as the person who came up with the idea that to reverse the Figure- four leglock, the opponent would simply turn over onto their stomach. Professional wrestling career =Early life and career= George Scott was the first born son to his parents, Walter and Jeannie. He was born in Dalmeny, Scotland while his parents were visiting relatives and, returning to Canada, was raised in Hamilton, Ontario. He grew up with his siblings Angus (AKA Sandy Scott, 1934-2010), and beloved Walter. His sister Jeannie, near the age of 12, suffered appendicitis during a return trip from Scotland on the , and was pronounced dead in Montreal, Quebec in 1935. She is buried in Hamilton, Ontario. Involved in hockey, basketball and roller skating as a child, Scott began amateur wrestling at the local YMCA at age 12 and, during the next year, also started weightlifting. Living nearby Ben and Mike Sharpe, both well known professional wrestlers in Hamilton at the time, he also faced Martin Hutzler in an amateur bout at the YMCA. Making his professional debut in Wasaga Beach at age 17, he was helped in his early career by Pat Murphy and Dano Macdonald. During the late 1940s, Scott attempted to convince local promoter Joe Maiche to wrestle in the Brantford armories before being signed by Toledo promoter Jack Pfefer and promoted as an up-and-coming wrestler. As Benny Becker, would gain considerable experience from many veteran wrestlers in the territory and would later face \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Rogers and Gorgeous George several times in his early career. =National Wrestling Alliance= After a brief stint with Georgia Championship Wrestling and Jim Crockett Promotions, Scott eventually found his way back to Canada where he wrestled for promoter John Katan in Toronto and made his debut in Maple Leaf Gardens in November 1950. While there, he and Whipper Billy Watson had an altercation in which he appeared with Watson on the undercard facing Lee Henning. The following day, a local newspaper wrote how Scott's match stole the show and Scott began appearing in the opening matches for much of his time in the promotion thereafter. In 1952, following a match against Buddy Rogers in Florida, Scott collapsed in the bathroom of his apartment. He was eventually found by a friend who, noticing the bathroom light on, broke into the apartment when Scott failed to respond to his knocking on the door. Brought to a local hospital, Scott was told he had passed out due to a deep bruise in his hip and was eventually flown back to Toronto where he was diagnosed with three ruptured discs in his back caused when Rogers had kicked him in the back during their match. Although doctors recommended surgery, Scott refused when he was told he would be unable to wrestle again. Taking a year off to recuperate, he lived with his parents while John Katan, Jack Laskin and Jack Tunney held stags and fundraising events to help his family as Scott remained paralyzed for six months. Worried that he might suffer another more serious injury, his parents had tried to encourage him to retire and his mother suggesting a career in law enforcement. Although he began working as a bouncer for a time and was offered a managerial position at the bar he worked for, he declined and eventually returned to active competition in Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling in 1954. =The Flying Scotts= Helping his brother Angus break into the wrestling business in 1953, Scott began teaming with his brother in Stampede Wrestling shortly after his recovery later winning the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship in 1954. After a brief stint in Maple Leaf Gardens in 1955, The Flying Scotts, as they were known, became one of the top tag teams in the Toronto and Buffalo areas during the late 1950s. Defeating Chris and John Tolos for the Stampede International Tag Team Championship in 1958, they would feud with Butcher and Mad Dog Vachon the following year. Scott would also return to the Carolinas with his brother during the 1960s before eventually regained the Stampede International Tag Team Championship in 1963. They would also win the Indiana version of the AWA World Tag Team Championship and, while in Australia during the late 1960s, won the IWA World Tag Team Championship three times between 1966 and 1968. While in Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling in 1954, he and Angus would become one of the most popular tag teams in Western Canada during their six-year stay in the promotion. At one event, in which they were featured in the main event against The Miller Brothers (Bill and Ed Miller), promoters were forced to turn away 6,000 at a Stampede Wrestling event before splitting up. The two would eventually have a falling out after the death of their mother resulting in Angus refusing to attend her funeral. Scott spent a short time (1968) in Championship wrestling based in Fort Worth Texas at the North side arena, the promotion was later bought by Fritz Von Erich and renamed WCCW. Scott as a baby face had bloody matches with Johnny Valentine, once Valentine ripped Scotts shirt off and ran him into the ring post, Scott spent the night in the hospital because Valentine went too far and really injured him. =Stampede Wrestling= Remaining in Calgary, Scott had a successful singles career while with Stampede Wrestling during the 1950s and 60s. When Billy Watson appeared in the area in the late 1960s, he refused to defend his title against Scott as well as Luther Lindsay and George Gordienko. According to Scott, this was the result of their argument in Toronto years before. While wrestling Killer Kowalski during a match in Calgary, fans reportedly began chanting \\"We want Scott\\". The following night at an event in Edmonton, Watson asked Scott to team with him in Toronto to which Scott declined. Scott has stated in later interviews that he regretted that decision as the wrestler who eventually teamed with Watson, Billy Red Lyons whose career would take off after that match. Involved in booking for Stu Hart and Jim Crockett during the early 1970s, he declined offers to tour Japan and instead chose to continue wrestling for both Stampede Wrestling and the Mid-Atlantic territory. He teamed with El Mongol and Jimmy Dancing Bear in 6-man tag team matches against Buddy Colt and The Assassins in late 1971 and, the following year, he lost to Superstar Billy Graham in Chicago, Illinois on November 3, 1972 Suffering a neck injury while wrestling in Texas, he was forced to retire the following year reuniting with his brother Angus against Atlantic Coast Tag Team Champions Gene & Ole Anderson in Winston-Salem, North Carolina on May 26, 1973 retiring later that year. =Jim Crockett Promotions and the Mid-Atlantic territory= In the years following his retirement, George gained a reputation as one of the leading bookers in the industry. Brought in by John Ringly, who had recently taken over Jim Crockett Promotions after the death of his father-in-law Jim Crockett, Sr., and stayed on after David and Jim Crockett, Jr. assumed control of the promotion. During his first few years in the Carolinas, he made major changes in the promotion including changing its focus from traditional tag team wrestling to singles competitors by bringing Wahoo McDaniel, The Super Destroyer and Johnny Valentine, with Valentine being the top wrestler in the territory. Although fans were slow to respond to the sudden shift, Valentine had become one of the most popular wrestlers in the region within several months. He also signed younger wrestlers such as \\"Superfly\\" Jimmy Snuka, Roddy Piper, Rick \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat and \\"Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair, and became a major influence during their early careers. During the late-1970s, Scott became a partner with Jim Crockett buying a third of Toronto promoter Frank Tunney's promotion for $100,000. This allowed them access to southern Ontario and parts of the northeastern United States as well as bringing in wrestlers from Maple Leaf Wrestling and the Carolinas. This would continue for several years until Frank Tunney's death in 1983 and his nephew Jack Tunney sided with the World Wrestling Federation when they entered the area during the mid-1980s; Scott later sued Jack Tunney and eventually received a $500,000 settlement and $150,000 in legal expenses in 1992. In 1981, Scott chose to leave Jim Crockett Promotions due to a pay dispute and resigned his position after giving Jim Crockett six weeks notice. Although Jim Crockett attempted to take Scott to court, the matter was soon dropped. Receiving numerous offers from promoters across the country, Scott took several months off before agreeing to temporarily assist Atlanta promoter Jim Barnett and Georgia Championship Wrestling for two months. # Scott was approached by Eddie Einhorn to become a partner in his International Wrestling Association, offering him a $250,000 salary and a percentage of the promotion, but Scott eventually declined. During this time, he also looking into purchasing the rights for the NWA's Oklahoma territory although he walked away from the deal allowing Bill Watts to purchase the territory for his Universal Wrestling Federation/Mid-South promotion. =World Wrestling Federation= In 1983, Scott received a call from Vince McMahon, Sr. with whom he had a close working relationship while with Jim Crockett Promotions. Agreeing to assist his son Vince McMahon who had recently taken over the World Wrestling Federation, he was immediately sent to Atlanta to oversee the WWF's purchase of the Saturday night timeslot on TBS, forcing out Georgia Championship Wrestling and resulting what became known as \\"Black Saturday\\". He was later involved in negotiations with Keith Hart for the McMahon's buyout of Stampede Wrestling which, according to Stu Hart in his biography Stu Hart: Lord of the Ring, was concluded by a handshake agreement. The official sale was finalized by Jim Barnett on August 24, 1984 for $1,000,000 to be paid off $100,000 a year.McCoy, Heath. Pain and Passion: The History of Stampede Wrestling. Toronto: CanWest Books, 2005. (pg. 203) While in the area, he began running events in Miami, Florida which soon became very profitable for the company and he soon began booking for the entire promotion. Between 1984-1985, the WWF was grossing between $3‚Äì4 million on weekends. He was directly involved in planning some of the biggest events in the promotion's history including WrestleMania I and 2, the first televised shows for Saturday Night's Main Event and the supercard Big Event at Toronto's Exhibition Stadium. Scott appeared on-camera at WrestleMania when, during the main event between Hulk Hogan & Mr. T and \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorff, he pulled guest official Muhammad Ali out of the ring as he was supposed to be an outside-the-ring referee. Prior to WrestleMania, he took part in the initial negotiations with Mr. T to appear in the main event. Despite an argument between him and Mr. T, the disagreement was eventually settled and he agreed to appear; Mr. T later ran up $22,000 in expenses during the week leading up to WrestleMania. Scott was also one of the key officials who attempted to clean up the widespread drug use among wrestlers in the promotion. He was involved in setting up the WWF's initial drug testing program. Those who failed the drug test would be suspended for six weeks and, if caught a second time, would be released from the company. Although having control of most of the roster, he and then WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan became involved in a heated argument during an event at Madison Square Garden regarding \\"some unsavory characters\\" hanging around backstage. Hogan, who by this time was gaining some political clout, went over Scott's head complaining about the incident to promoter Vince McMahon. He worked three days straight with NBC producer Dick Ebersol on Saturday Night's Main Event I. He and Ebersol disagreed on the show's content, with Ebersol in favor of a Saturday Night Live-style show as opposed to Scott's ideas for a traditional wrestling event. The format had been previously used on the WWF's Tuesday Night Titans. Eventually, Scott decided to resign due to overwork, the changing direction of the company and ongoing conflicts with Hogan and other wrestlers. =Later career and retirement= After leaving the WWF in 1986, he briefly worked for Fritz Von Erich in Dallas replacing Ken Mantel, who had left the promotion earlier that year. Although David Meltzer's The Wrestling Observer newsletter reported that he had joined the promotion in August, other sources such as David Manning's Heroes of World Class have claimed he had joined the promotion shortly before Kerry Von Erich's motorcycle accident the previous month. Scott's time in WCCW was brief however and, according to Gary Hart, he resigned his position after failing to force Hart out of the promotion.Matysik, Larry and Barbara Goodish. Brody: The Triumph and Tragedy of Wrestling's Rebel. Toronto: ECW Press, 2007. Scott, who reportedly regarded Hart as a threat to his position, had scheduled a match between Abdullah the Butcher and Bruiser Brody at the supercard Christmas Star Wars '86 later that year. However, he secretly withheld from the participants that the match, in which Abdullah the Butcher would lose to Brody, would be a loser-leaves-Texas match. Brody would eventually find out about the arrangement and instead agreed to lose to Abdullah causing him to leave the promotion. Brody would return to WCCW as the masked wrestler Red River Jack and, with Scott leaving the promotion shortly after, Brody replaced him as head booker. . He later went back to work for Crockett in 1988, taking over creative rights of the promotion but lightning didn't strike twice and his run was brief as he was fired in April 1989, due to the lack of promotion for the Clash of the Champions, and was replaced by the NWA booking committee. He started up a promotion in the Carolinas called South Atlantic Pro Wrestling in the early 1990s. It got off to a promising start but shut down in 1994. Personal life Retiring to Indian Rocks Beach, Florida with his wife Jean, a former City Commissioner who has long been active in local politics. Scott also became involved in real estate and rental property, as well as his involvement in numerous charitable events, specifically his assistance in establishing the Eblen Foundation in Asheville, North Carolina, which helps underprivileged families. In 2001, he was among several honorees at the Cauliflower Alley Club Banquet & Reunion. Scott was also acknowledged by Vince McMahon, who publicly thanked him for his contributions to the World Wrestling Federation during a wrestling event later that year. Scott was diagnosed with lung cancer in November 2011. He entered hospice care in October 2013 and died a few months later on January 20, 2014.

He is best known for the screen adaptation of his 1978 novel Walter, and was the first presenter of the UK TV programme Rainbow. He was born in Preston, Lancashire. He studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London, from 1959 to 1961. His first role was in the 1962 film adaptation of A Kind of Loving. Thereafter, he worked on both stage and television. He began to write novels and also for television in the early 1970s. He presented the first and second series of Rainbow, the first episode of which aired in October 1972. He left the show to concentrate on his writing before the third series in 1973, and was replaced as presenter by Geoffrey Hayes. Cook went on to write Walter, a novel about a young man with learning disabilities. It won the Hawthornden Prize in 1978, and was later made into a film of the same name, starring Ian McKellen and directed by Stephen Frears. It was broadcast on Channel 4's opening night. Cook's follow-up novel, Winter Doves, was also filmed with McKellen, and a 2009 radio play, Walter Now, saw Walter become a pensioner. It also focused on reproductive rights for people with learning disabilities. Cook continued to act, and provided several of the screenplays for the BBC TV series Hetty Wainthropp Investigates, a series based on his 1986 novel Missing Persons. He died on 16 September 2015, only five days before his 75th birthday. He was survived by his long-term partner, novelist and playwright John Bowen.

The label was launched in September 1990, and was the first label by the Group. History Two years after Max Matsuura began a career distributing studio albums from other countries, he and his two Avex co-founders, Tom Yoda and Ken Suzuki, decided to found their own label. Aiming to compete with more established labels such as Nippon Columbia, Nippon Crown, Toshiba-EMI, CBS Sony, and Nippon Phonogram and PolyGram K.K., they created the Avex Trax label. The first artist to sign to the label was the band TRF, which became a success. This led to Avex Trax becoming a \\"house of refuge\\" for artists who either ended contracts with their former labels (e.g. Namie Amuro). It also appealed to artists not content with their current labels (e.g. Gackt) or who had been kicked out by their former labels (e.g. Ayumi Hamasaki). Formerly distributed by the Nippon Crown label excluding several early releases, in 1997 it became a self-distributed label together with Cutting Edge, which was formerly distributed by Toshiba-EMI. Artists Some of their artists include Japanese artists such as AAA, Ai Otsuka, Dream, Namie Amuro, Do As Infinity, Every Little Thing, Gackt, Wagakki Band, Girl Next Door, Ayumi Hamasaki, Mai Oshima, Seikima-II, Dream5, SKE48, Yoji Biomehanika, S2nd, Beverly and Tokyo Girls' Style as well as foreign artists such as BoA, TVXQ, After School, Super Junior, O-Zone, U-KISS, f(x), Exo, NCT, Red Velvet, Lights Over Paris and Blackpink.

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9‚Äì2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,212 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 7¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, the asteroid's observation arc starts with its discovery observation in 1969. A rotational lightcurve for this asteroid was published by several Hungarian astronomers in August 2005. The photometric observations gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.27 magnitude (). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of its orbital family ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 3.7 kilometers.

The monks of the Convento de Santa Cruz do Bu√ßaco not only built a convent but also created a luxurious garden with many species of trees. The garden was supposed to represent Mount Carmel (where the order was founded) and the Earthly Paradise. Date from the late 17th century a series of chapels with representations of a Via Crucis in the garden. Part of the convent, including the church with Baroque altarpieces, is still preserved beside the palace. At the entrance of the old convent, there is a plaque to the Battle of Bussaco which commemorates the fact that Viscount Wellington, who later became the Duke of Wellington, spent the night in the convent after the battle on 27 September 1810. The Carmelites left Bu√ßaco in 1834 century following the dissolution of the monasteries in Portugal. =Palace Hotel= Late in the century there were plans to turn the ancient convent into a royal residence for Queen Maria Pia, wife of King Lu√≠s I. However, difficult political circumstances soon led to the decision to turn the palace into a hotel. Detail of the Neo-Manueline fa√ßade of Palace Hotel of Bussaco (Casa dos Bras√µes). The Palace Hotel of Bu√ßaco was built between 1888 and 1907. The first architect was the Italian Luigi Manini (1848-1936), who designed a Romantic palace in Neo-Manueline style, evoking the 16th-century architectural style that characterised the peak of the Portuguese Age of Discovery. The Bu√ßaco Palace is inspired in iconic Manueline buildings like the Jer√≥nimos Monastery and the Bel√©m Tower, both located in Lisbon. Manini was succeeded by Nicola Bigaglia, Jos√© Alexandre Soares and Manuel Joaquim Norte J√∫nior, the latter responsible for the annex Casa dos Bras√µes (House of the Coat-of-Arms). The inner rooms are richly decorated with Neo-Manueline portals and stucco work imitating Manueline rib vaulting, being also an important showcase of Portuguese painting and sculpture of the early 20th century. The inner walls are also decorated with tile (azulejo) panels by Jorge Cola√ßo. These panels depict scenes taken from Portuguese literature as well as historical events like the Battle of Bussaco.

It is not claimed to be historically accurate. It features an ensemble cast headlined by Damian Lewis and Sophia Myles and was directed by Stuart Orme. The screenplay was written by Peter Morgan and Richard Cottan. Synopsis The series tells several stories of various, mostly British, prisoners of war in the Second World War and their attempts to escape Colditz. The first episode features a fictionalised account of an actual event when three inmates Dick Lorraine, John 'Bosun' Crisp, and the 'Medium Sized Man', Flt Lt Dominic Bruce OBE MC AFM KSG MA RAF attempted to escape using the castle sewers. In reality the escape team were discovered when they attempted to exit a manhole. The Germans threatened to throw grenades down into the sewer chamber and, as the escapees could not reverse back up the sewer pipe, they were forced to surrender. They were immediately put in front of a firing squad, but unlike the fictional TV account, the guards did not fire. Just before the order was to be given, Bruce lost his temper and approached the officer in charge, Eggers, saying \\"you can shoot us, but after the war we'll hang you\\". Eggers stood the squad down. An account of this escape can be found in Reel Five of the oral history version given by Flt. Lt. Bruce to be found in the Imperial War Museum Sound Archive.

Color-coded year stickers appear for the first time in 1982, based on the license plate's color scheme (notable exceptions are in 1983, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1993). Stickers for vehicle classification appeared in the same year.

History  On 1 December 1944, the Taranaki Education Board wrote to the Education Department seeking approval to open a high school. The department in reply asked the board to submit a report on the matter of acquisition of a site, construction of buildings and inauguration of a system of conveyance. On 18 January, eight acres were selected, partly of the Bayly Estate and owned by Mrs O.H. Taylor, as the most suitable site. On 8 June the board forwarded the plans and estimates to the Education Department. On 28 November 1946 contributing schools were notified that Mr Massey had been appointed headmaster from 1 February 1947 and the school opened on that date with a roll of 120 third, fourth and fifth form pupils in five classrooms, a laboratory, a general purpose room and subsidiary accommodation. A further three classrooms and a library were approved in principle in July 1947 and in December of the same year the board was authorised to call tenders for a new manual building comprising a cookery room and woodwork room with a metalwork bay. = The badge = The two shades of blue were decided upon by the founding advisory committee. They chose Cambridge blue (light blue) and Oxford blue (dark blue). It was decided that a heraldic style badge was not appropriate for a new school of the era. Instead it was decided to simply use a shield with interlocking letters. The initial WDHS (Waitara District High School) was later replaced with the present WHS. The founding principal, Mr Massey, looked for a motto in Maori which would say ‚Äì Strive on or Fight on. Mr Rangi Makawe (a member of the committee) was also in favour of this as the school was stood on an old battlefield. Many word combinations were suggested and rejected so finally the words \\"Whawhai Tonu\\" were settled on. This was sent to a Maori scholar for his opinion and there concern as the phrase could be interpreted as \\"Slaughter on\\". Eventually Mr Massey requested a Latin translation from Victoria University. The university provided a quotation from Virgil containing the words \\"Ulterius Tende\\" meaning to \\"strive on\\". = The bell = The school bell was presented to the school from the London County Council in 1946. It is from the Avonmore School at Fulham which was destroyed during the air raids of 1940.

Craig served as Speaker of the Assembly from 1935 through 1936.  Biography  Edward Craig was raised in Olinda, California until 1912, when his family moved to Brea. With only an 8th grade education, Craig's original career was as an oil tool machinist. His lack of a higher education did not stop later success in life. In 1928, Craig was elected to the Brea City Council to fill the seat held by his father, who had just retired. That same year, he won a seat in the State Assembly.LA Times, August 5, 1979, p. A3. In 1928, the legislature was part-time, so legislators were allowed to maintain outside employment, including local government positions. Craig was elected Speaker of the Assembly in 1935. As Speaker, he was instrumental in switching from the archaic and time-consuming \\"oral roll call\\" voting process in the Assembly, to a new push-button electric voting system in 1935.Senate Concurrent Resolution 45, 1979-80 Regular Session, Resolution Chapter 13, Statutes of 1980.(view past year California statutes online at www.assembly.ca.gov/clerk Craig also served as Mayor of Brea while he was Speaker of the Assembly, as the Assembly was a part-time institution in the 1930s. The low legislative salary caused Craig to decide to not run for reelection to his Assembly seat in 1936. That year, during the Great Depression, Democrats would gain a brief Assembly majority for the first time in over 40 years.California's Legislature (2006 Edition), Chief Clerk of the Assembly, Sacramento, CA, p. 265 Craig became a lobbyist for Pacific Lighting Corporation late in 1936, a position he held for 28 years. As a lobbyist, Craig was credited in 1953 for convincing Congress to exempt the El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline from requirements of being a common carrier. In 1964, Craig retired from Pacific Lighting and became the lobbyist for Orange County, California. He was credited for passing a legislative amendment to allow Orange County to use revenue bonds to finance public buildings. As a fixture at the State Capitol for 50 years, Ted Craig was still referred to by legislators and staff as \\"Mr. Speaker\\" as he lobbied the legislature in the late 1970s. He died at age 82 in August 1979, survived by his son, Thomas Craig of Wichita, Kansas. Edward Craig is buried at Loma Vista Cemetery in Fullerton, California. In 1980, the California legislature adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution 45 to honor the life and legacy of former Assembly Speaker Edward Craig. Ted Craig's legacy also exists as Ted Craig Regional Park in Fullerton, California and an alley known as Craig Circle. Ted Craig was also instrumental in helping Richard Nixon (37th President of the United States of America) becoming more involved in politics.

A vehicle for stars Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, and Fabian, it was one of a string of similar racing films from the 1960s. Written by William Asher and Leo Townsend, and directed by William Asher, it tells the story of Dave Owens (Avalon), a stock car racer forced to run moonshine. Plot Stock car racer \\"Fireball\\" Dave Owens from California goes to race in Spartanburg, South Carolina, where he intends on competing against local champ Sonny Leander Fox. Dave beats Leander in a race, impressing the latter's girlfriend, Jane, and the wealthy Martha Brian. Martha persuades Dave to drive in a cross country night race, not telling him he is actually smuggling moonshine. She and her partner, Charlie Bigg, are pleased with Dave's results. Leander, who runs his own still and smuggling operation, is impressed with Dave's success, but this does not change the fact that he wants to beat Dave on the track, even challenging him to a dangerous figure-8 race. Agents from the IRS threaten to send Dave to six months in jail unless he helps them bust the local moonshine ring. After a driver, Joey, is killed during a run, Dave and Leander agree to team up to investigate the accident. They discover it was caused by someone placing a huge mirror across the road. It turns out that Martha's moonshining partner, Charlie Bigg, was solely responsible for the murder of Joey and also tried to kill Dave because he was jealous that the young California driver is sleeping with her. Dave wins the big race but Leander is badly burned. Jane helps him recover and Dave drives off into the sunset with Martha the Moonshiner.

AIP executive Deke Heyward said that: > The next big thing for teenage films is protest. Teenagers empathize with > protest because they are in revolt against their parents... These films > represent a protest against society. These will be moral tales, there will > be good guys and bad guys. But we will show the reasons for young people > going against the dictates of the establishment. Stock car racing had already been the subject of Red Line 7000 but this movie would be specifically told from the teenagers point of view. Fabian signed a multi picture deal with AIP in late 1965 and this was the first movie he made for them. =Shooting= The film was shot in early 1966. The \\"Fireball 500\\" is a 1966 Plymouth Barracuda, heavily customized by George Barris, with a 1966 Hemi 426 Plymouth engine that develops up to 425 h.p. At one point in the film, the car is referred to as the Batmobile, prompting Frankie Avalon's character to quip, \\"Yeah, well this was built first.\\" Barris also built the Batmobile for the Batman television show which premiered in January 1966. Footage from Fireball 500, specifically shots of the 4B car (Jim Douglas' car) toppling over on its roof, show up later in the demolition derby scenes at the beginning of The Love Bug. When making the film AIP would hire a race car driver and install cameras in the front and rear of his car to obtain shots.http://monsterkidclassichorrorforum.yuku.com/reply/202915 The film is notable for its depiction of the inherently dangerous Figure 8 racing. It was the first movie Funicello made after the birth of her daughter. Funicello and Fabian starred together again (without Avalon) the following year in AIP's follow-up feature, Thunder Alley. =Music= The film's soundtrack is by Les Baxter, and features six songs written by Guy Hemric and Jerry Styner. Frankie Avalon sings: *\\"Fireball 500\\", *\\"My Way\\" (not to be confused with the song made popular by Frank Sinatra), *\\"Turn Around\\", *\\"A Chance Like That\\", and *\\"Country Carnival.\\" Annette Funicello sings \\"Step Right Up.\\" Reception =Critical= The Los Angeles Times said the film \\"leaves American International's beach formula pretty much intact despite William Asher's attempt to inject some sophistication into his story\\" but thought it was \\"always easy to watch\\" with \\"a brisk tempo, a stylish verve that leaps over large holes in the story.\\" The New York Times called it \\"a real turkey... one old bird that should have been cremated, not cooked.\\" =Sequel= In July 1966 it was announced Burt Topper would produce a follow up, Malibu 500 with a budget of $1.4 million. This became Thunder Alley. References Further reading * Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide 2006, p. 428\\\\. New York: Penguin/New American Library, 2006.

Both Holt and Beery as well as Lon Chaney and Bull Montana had appeared in Tourneur's Victory the year before. The film reportedly had color sequences, possibly hand-colored with the Handschiegel Color Process.

The grant was contingent on being matched by $49.2 million in private donations and $49.2 million in public money. The Chicago Annenberg Challenge was one of 18 locally designed Annenberg Challenge project sites that received $387 million over five years as part of Walter Annenberg's gift of $500 million over five years to support public school reform. The Chicago Annenberg Challenge helped create a successor organization, the Chicago Public Education Fund (CPEF), committing $2 million in June 1998 as the first donor to Chicago's first community foundation for education.  Annenberg Challenge  In the 1990s, billionaire Walter Annenberg, former ambassador to the United Kingdom under President Richard Nixon, was the United States' most generous living philanthropist. By 1998, Annenberg had given away more than $2 billion and the assets of the Annenberg Foundation he had established in June 1989 with $1 billion had grown to $3 billion and ranked as the 12th largest in the U.S. Every weekday from May through November, Annenberg was driven from his home in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania to his Annenberg Foundation headquarters in St. Davids, Pennsylvania, where, as its sole director, he reserved virtually every decision for himself when making grants. In June 1993, Annenberg announced he was making the largest individual gift to private education in history‚Äî$365 million to four schools: $120 million each to the communication programs at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California, $25 million to Harvard College, and $100 million to his alma mater, the Peddie School in Hightstown, New Jersey. In October 1993, Annenberg announced an unrestricted $25 million gift to Northwestern University bringing his total donations to Northwestern to $55 million, his last major gift to higher education for five years as he shifted the focus of his philanthropy to public K‚Äì12 education. Annenberg told Newton Minow, senior counsel of Sidley & Austin, chairman of the Carnegie Corporation (1993‚Äì1997), Annenberg Professor of Communications Law and Policy at Northwestern University (1987‚Äì2003) and director of its Annenberg Washington Program (1987‚Äì1996): \\"Everybody around the world wants to send their kids to our universities. South America, Asia, Europe, all of them. But nobody wants to send their kids here to public school. Who would, especially in a big city? Nobody. So we've got to do something. If we don't, our civilization will collapse.\\" Annenberg sought recommendations on making a large gift to American public schools from his pro bono education advisors: # Vartan Gregorian, president of Brown University (1989‚Äì1997); president of the Carnegie Corporation (1997‚Äì ); former president of the New York Public Library; former professor of Southwest Asian history, dean, and provost of the University of Pennsylvania # Ted Sizer, founding chairman of the Coalition of Essential Schools (CES) (1984‚Äì1997); professor of education at Brown University (1983‚Äì1997); former headmaster of Phillips Andover (1972‚Äì1981); former dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education (1964‚Äì1972) # David Kearns, chairman of the Alexandria-based New American Schools Development Corporation (NASDC)‚Äîa 1991 school reform initiative of President George H. W. Bush; former Deputy Secretary of Education (1991‚Äì1993) under Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander in the George H. W. Bush administration; former president, CEO and chairman of Xerox On December 17, 1993, the 85-year-old Annenberg announced his five-year $500 million \\"Challenge to the Nation\\" at a ceremony in the Roosevelt Room of the White House with President Bill Clinton, Secretary of Education Richard Riley, Gregorian, Sizer, Kearns, and Frank Newman, Illinois Governor Jim Edgar and Colorado Governor Roy Romer (the president, outgoing and incoming chairman, respectively, of the Denver-based bipartisan Education Commission of the States (ECS). Annenberg announced that he was giving $113 million over five years to three national school reform organizations: # $50 million to a new Annenberg Institute for School Reform (AISR) at Brown University that would incorporate the CES and be chaired by Sizer # $57 million to the NASDC, chaired by Kearns # $6 million to the ECS (chaired by Edgar and then Romer, with president Newman) to disseminate NASDC models for restructuring schools The remaining $387 million was for: school reform in the largest urban school systems, attended by a third of the 47 million public school students in the U.S.; for school reform in rural schools which make up a quarter of all public schools, attended by 1 in 8 public school students in the U.S.; and for arts education. Annenberg delegated how to spend the $387 million to his closest professional friend, Vartan Gregorian, whom he had known for twenty years‚Äîsince Gregorian's tenure at the University of Pennsylvania where Annenberg was a trustee and its largest donor. Annenberg called Gregorian: \\"The best all-around executive I know. A man of great character and absolute integrity. The most outstanding human being I know.\\" Gregorian oversaw everything involved in the Challenge and ensured that it was nonpartisan. Reflecting Annenberg's vision of the Challenge as a catalyst‚Äînot a yardstick‚Äîhe did not require Gregorian to meet specific benchmarks, such as dispensing funds on the basis of the schools' raising their reading or math scores by certain percentage points. Gregorian recruited university presidents and business leaders to assemble civic teams in various cities to pursue Challenge grants, and awarded grants to 18 locally designed projects: * Nine grants were awarded to major urban areas. These awards included matching grants ranging in size from $10 million to $53 million: New York City and Los Angeles in 1994; Chicago, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area in 1995; South Florida, Boston and Detroit in 1996; and Houston in 1997. * Five smaller special opportunity grants ranging from $1 million to $4 million were awarded to Atlanta, Chattanooga, Chelsea, Salt Lake City, and West Baltimore. * $50 million was awarded to set up the national Rural Challenge that involved over 700 schools across the U.S. * Three arts education grants ranging from $3 million to $12 million were awarded to New York City, Minneapolis, and a national arts education program. = Beginnings = The three co-authors of Chicago's winning Annenberg Challenge $49.2 million grant proposal were: # William Ayers, associate professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago; co-director of the Small Schools Workshop; co-director of the Chicago Forum for School Change‚Äîan affiliate of the Coalition of Essential Schools; chairman of the Alliance for Better Chicago Schools (ABCs) coalition; former Chicago assistant deputy mayor for education (1989‚Äì1990); brother of John Ayers, executive director (1994‚Äì2004) of Leadership for Quality Education (an affiliate of the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago) and former associate director (1987‚Äì1994) of the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago; son of Thomas Ayers, former president (1964‚Äì1980), chairman and CEO (1973‚Äì1980) of Commonwealth Edison and former vice president (1980) of the Chicago School Board # Anne Hallett, executive director and founder of the Cross-City Campaign for Urban School Reform; former executive director of the Wieboldt Foundation (1986‚Äì1993); former executive director of the Citizens Education Center in Seattle (1983‚Äì1986); former executive director and founder of the Chicago Panel on School Policy (1982‚Äì1983); former chair, founder, and chief lobbyist for Citizens for Fair School Funding in Seattle (1976‚Äì1982) The roundtable discussion was sponsored by the Woods Charitable Fund and moderated by a trustee of the Wieboldt Foundation, with participants that included Barack Obama, Anne Hallett, Sokoni Karanja, and the assistant director of special grants programs at the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and with guests that included Ken Rolling. The first person mentioned by Obama in the discussion was Peter Martinez. Describes the leadership roles of Ken Rolling of the Woods Charitable Fund with Anne Hallett of the Wieboldt Foundation in fostering collaboration on school reform among foundations and nonprofit organizations from 1987 to 1993.The Cross-City Campaign for Urban School Reform involved school reformers from nine major cities: Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Oakland, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. # Warren Chapman, senior program officer for education at the Joyce Foundation; former state coordinator at the Illinois State Board of Education for the Illinois Alliance of Essential Schools‚Äîa regional center of the Coalition of Essential Schools (1986‚Äì1992)The Joyce Foundation funded urban school reform in four major cities: Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and Milwaukee. On December 17, 1993, Ayers, Hallet and Chapman met to discuss how to win an Annenberg Challenge grant for Chicago. Hallett and Chapman were already informal pro bono advisors to the national Annenberg Challenge, and over the course of the following year they met repeatedly at Brown University with other Annenberg advisors and worked to ensure that Chicago would be one of the first cities selected to receive a grant. In Chicago, Ayers, Hallett and Chapman gathered a 73-member Chicago School Reform Collaborative Working Group from organizations involved in school reform to help them draft a proposal, with Hallett's Cross-City Campaign for Urban School Reform donating its headquarters and providing staff support to the Working Group. In June 1994, Ayers and Hallett submitted a draft proposal to Gregorian on behalf of the Working Group. The presidents of the three largest independent foundations active in Chicago school reform: # Adele Smith Simmons, president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation (1989‚Äì1999); vice chair and senior executive of Chicago Metropolis 2020‚Äîa project of the Commercial Club of Chicago (1999‚Äì ); senior associate at the Center for International Studies at the University of Chicago (1999‚Äì2005); former president of Hampshire College (1977‚Äì1989); former assistant professor of East African history at Princeton University (1972‚Äì1977) and Tufts University (1969‚Äì1972); former dean of students at Princeton University (1972‚Äì1977); former dean of Jackson College for Women of Tufts University (1970‚Äì1972); Ph.D. 1969, University of Oxford; B.A. 1963, Radcliffe College # Deborah Leff, president of the Joyce Foundation (1992‚Äì1999); president and CEO of America's Second Harvest (1999‚Äì2001); director of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library (2001‚Äì2006); president of Public Welfare Foundation (2006‚Äì ); former senior producer at ABC News (1983‚Äì1989); former producer at WLS-TV ABC 7 News in Chicago (1981‚Äì1983); former director of public affairs at the Federal Trade Commission (1980‚Äì1981); former civil rights attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice (1977‚Äì1979); J.D. 1977, University of Chicago Law School; A.B. 1973, Princeton University # Patricia Albjerg Graham, president of the Spencer Foundation (1991‚Äì2000); professor of the history of education (1977‚Äì2006) and former dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education (1982‚Äì1991); former dean of the Radcliffe Institute (1974‚Äì1977) and vice president of Radcliffe College (1976‚Äì1977); former assistant professor (1965‚Äì1968), associate professor (1968‚Äì1972), professor (1972‚Äì1974) of the history of education at Barnard College and Teachers College, Columbia University; former assistant professor of the history of education at Indiana University (1964‚Äì1966); former high school teacher, Norfolk, Virginia (1955‚Äì1956, 1957‚Äì1958), New York City (1958‚Äì1960); Ph.D. 1964, Columbia University; B.S. 1955, M.S. 1957, Purdue University supported the Working Group's proposal, helped negotiate its approval by Gregorian, agreed in advance to provide matching funds, and smoothed negotiations with Chicago Mayor Daley's administration, the Chicago Public Schools administration and the Chicago Teachers Union, which had each submitted competing Annenberg Challenge grant proposals. In November 1994, Ayers and Hallett submitted a final proposal to Gregorian on behalf of the Working Group. On January 23, 1995, in a ceremony attended by Mayor Daley, Governor Edgar, and other dignitaries at Washington Irving Elementary School (where the 1988 School Reform Act had been signed), Walter Annenberg's daughter, Wallis Annenberg, presented a symbolic $49.2 million check from the Annenberg Foundation to 11-year-old Amanda Morado, who accepted it on behalf of the nearly 410,000 Chicago public school children. The $49.2 million challenge grant over 5 years (a planned $3 million the first year, then $11.55 million per year for the next four years) was contingent on being matched 2-to-1 by $49.2 million in private donations and $49.2 million in public money. In recognition of preexisting strong support by local foundations‚Äîwhich were already spending more than $12 million per year on Chicago school reform (including $4 million per year from the MacArthur Foundation and nearly $3 million per year from the Joyce Foundation)‚Äîthe Annenberg Foundation agreed that the Chicago Annenberg Challenge could draw upon existing commitments as a source of matching funds. The public match would come from public funds committed to implementation of the 1988 school reform law, including some of the $261 million per year state Chapter 1 antipoverty funds provided to Chicago public schools (an average of $500,000 per elementary school and an average of $800,000 per high school). Supplemental educational programs provided by local and national school reform groups working with networks of schools expanded in Chicago in the six years after the 1988 School Reform Act devolved state Chapter 1 antipoverty discretionary funding from the Chicago Public Schools administration down to individual schools, and foundations increased their school reform funding from $2 million per year to over $12 million per year. These programs provided by existing groups working with networks of schools became models for the Chicago Annenberg Challenge's grants which were to go to external partners‚Äîsuch as the Coalition of Essential Schools or the Algebra Project ‚Äîworking with networks of 5 to 10 schools, as opposed to going to system-wide initiatives or going directly to individual schools. The external partner could be anything from a school reform group to a teachers union to a community organization to a university to a local business. An 8-member Board of Directors made up of representatives of organizations that had no vested interest in Annenberg money was recruited to approve grants, hire an executive director and project staff, and determine which funds could count towards the required $98.4 million match. The Board of Directors was handpicked by Adele Smith Simmons, president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, who was asked by Gregorian to \\"work with foundation leadership to create a board that would be diverse, including people from the community, business interests and civic leaders, and include no more than nine people.\\" At a meeting with Simmons and Patricia Albjerg Graham, Deborah Leff suggested that Barack Obama would make a good board chairman. After meeting and being impressed by Obama, Graham told Obama that she wanted him to be chairman of the Board of Directors. Obama said that he would agree to serve as chairman if Graham would be vice chairman, to which Graham agreed. A 23-member group of Chicago parents, teachers, activists, funders, administrators, local school council members and academics who were involved in school reform, called the Chicago School Reform Collaborative, was chosen to design the initial Request for Proposals (RFPs), help publicize the Challenge and hold informational sessions for potential grantees, screen and rate the initial letters of intent, aid the Board of Directors in selecting an executive director, and work with the project's staff. Twenty of the 23 members of the Collaborative were elected by all Working Group members who had attended two or more of the drafting sessions during the first ten months of 1994 for the winning $49.2 million grant proposal; the other three members of the Collaborative were appointed representatives of the Office of the Mayor, the Chicago Public Schools administration, and the Chicago Teachers Union. On June 22, 1995, the Chicago Annenberg Challenge announced the members of its Board of Directors and Chicago School Reform Collaborative and said that RFPs had been sent to all 550 Chicago public schools and to numerous community agencies. Two-page letters of intent from schools were due by August 1; by August 23, schools would receive a letter either asking them to apply next year or inviting them to a meeting for further details on how to prepare a proposal to get funding that year, with proposals due by October 1, and grants announced December 4.

Executive director and staff  Ken Rolling, the executive director of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from September 1995 through 2001; then executive director of Parents for Public Schools (2003‚Äì ); was the former associate director and program officer for community organizing and school reform at the Woods Fund of Chicago (1985‚Äì1995). In September 1995, an office administrator was hired. In August 1996, a program director, a grants manager and a financial officer were hired. In 1997, a director of development, a communications director, a communications assistant, a clerical assistant and a data manager were hired, bringing Rolling's staff to nine. The University of Illinois at Chicago provided office space rent-free to the Chicago Annenberg Challenge staff. = Operation = By August 1, 1995, letters of intent were received from 177 networks‚Äîrepresenting two-thirds of Chicago public schools‚Äîof which 89 networks were invited by the Board to submit full proposals. 77 networks‚Äîrepresenting almost 300 schools‚Äîsubmitted proposals (32 for implementation grants and 45 for planning grants) by the October 1 deadline. On November 29, the Board approved grants for 35 networks‚Äîrepresenting 170 schools‚Äîand identified and certified over $9 million in matching private donations which enabled the Chicago Annenberg Challenge to receive its first $3 million from the Annenberg Foundation in early December 1995.The Annenberg Foundation mandated that only public matching funds which directly supported the same schools receiving Chicago Annenberg Challenge funds would be eligible for matching grant purposes. In 1995 the CAC was allowed to delay its 1995 public match requirement‚Äîbut catch up on public matching funds by the end of 1996‚Äîwith a double amount of 1995 private matching funds sufficing to receive the $3 million from the Annenberg Foundation in 1995. At a December 20, 1995 reception at First Chicago National Bank, the Chicago Annenberg Challenge presented $2.58 million in grant certificates to the first 35 networks winning grants. One-year renewable grants of $100,000 to $200,000 were awarded to 13 networks to expand existing programs and 22 other networks received planning grants of $17,000 to $25,000. The number of implementation networks grew from 13 at the beginning of 1996, to 25 in the 1996‚Äì7 school year, to 45 in 1999. The number of schools in a network ranged from 3 to 15, with the average network having 4 to 5 schools. In 1996-7, half of the external partners were universities or professional education organizations (e.g., Chicago State University, Columbia College Chicago, DePaul University, the Erikson Institute, Governors State University, National-Louis University, Northeastern Illinois University, Roosevelt University, the University of Chicago). The other external partners represented a diverse mix of neighborhood organizations (e.g., the Logan Square Neighborhood Association), youth organizations (e.g., Youth Guidance‚Äîimplementing the Comer Process), foundations (e.g., the Great Books Foundation), education reform or advocacy groups (e.g., Designs for Change), museums (e.g., the Chicago Academy of Sciences, the Chicago Children's Museum, the Kohl Children's Museum), parks (e.g., the Garfield Park Conservatory and arts organizations (e.g., the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, The Suzuki-Orff School of Music for implementation of Clap, Sing and READ!, teaching literacy- through-music in Chicago's underserved communities). Of external partners in the 45 networks funded in 1999: 35% were Chicago-area colleges and universities, 28% were education reform and education services organizations, 23% were arts and cultural institutions, and 14% were neighborhood and community-based organizations. The Chicago Annenberg Challenge received its $49.2 million grant from the Annenberg Foundation over five calendar years from 1995 through 1999, but funded grants to its networks of schools for five and a half years from January 1996 through June 2001. The total funding of implementation grants to networks of schools fell steeply in 2000 and 2001, and since the number of schools in networks receiving implementation grants remained steady at 206 schools, per school funding also fell steeply. The exceptions were 18 \\"breakthrough schools\\" that the Chicago Annenberg Challenge identified to receive sustained funding during its last two years to further promote their improvement and encourage them to serve as models and sources of support to other schools. The \\"breakthrough schools\\" selected in December 1999 and announced to the public in February 2000, received their grants directly, not through an external partner as part of a network of schools. * The number of schools in networks receiving Chicago Annenberg Challenge implementation grants rose from 138 in 1996, to 177 in 1997, to a peak of 211 in 1998, and then plateaued at 206 in 1999, 2000 and 2001. * The total annual amount of Chicago Annenberg Challenge funds provided in implementation grants to networks of schools rose from $2.1 million in 1996, to $6.8 million in 1997, to $7.8 million in 1988, to a peak of $9.6 million in 1999, and then fell to $5.9 million in 2000 and to $0.5 million in 2001. * The average annual amount per school of Chicago Annenberg Challenge funds provided in implementation grants to networks of schools rose from $15,000 in 1996, to $38,000 in 1997, to $37,000 in 1998, to a peak of $47,000 in 1999, and then fell to $29,000 in 2000 and to $3,000 in 2001‚Äîexcept in the 18 \\"breakthrough schools\\" where annual funding per school stayed at $50,000 in 2000 and 2001. By December 31, 1999, the Chicago Annenberg Challenge had identified and certified $110,643,651 in matching funds‚Äî$50,655,505 in public matching funds and $59,808,146 in private donations‚Äîmore than the $98.4 million required to earn the $49.2 million grant from the Annenberg Foundation. Less than $5 million in matching funds went to or through the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, most of the matching funds instead went to support school reform programs consistent with its vision and funding criteria. Thirty-six foundations and corporations provided private matching funds for the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, with foundations providing over three-quarters of the private donations. Ten foundations, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, the Polk Bros. Foundation, the Chicago Community Trust, the Spencer Foundation, the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund of New York, the McDougal Family Foundation, the Lloyd A. Fry Foundation, the Prince Charitable Trusts, and the Woods Fund of Chicago, and two corporations, IBM and Bank of America (which had acquired Continental Illinois Bank in 1994), contributed more than $1 million each in private matching donations for the Chicago Annenberg Challenge. The MacArthur Foundation and the Joyce Foundation were two of seven foundations that contributed over $10 million in private matching donations for the Annenberg Challenge nationwide, and the Polk Bros. Foundation‚Äîled by president and CEO Sandra Polk Guthman, a former IBM executive, was one of a further eight foundations that contributed over $5 million in private matching donations for the Annenberg Challenge nationwide. The Chicago Annenberg Challenge raised $3.5 million in research funds to support the largest urban school reform research project in the United States, the Chicago Annenberg Challenge Research Project by the Consortium on Chicago School Research (CCSR). The CCSR was created in 1990 to perform research on the Chicago Public Schools in the wake of the 1988 Chicago School Reform Act. = Chicago Public Education Fund = In 1997, the Chicago Annenberg Challenge Board of Directors and its fundraising Development Committee began development of Chicago's first community foundation for public education.Chicago Annenberg Challenge Development Committee, 1997: Barack Obama, Arnold R. Weber, Susan M. Crown, Edward S. Bottum, Thomas G. Ayers, Sandra Polk Guthman, Iris Krieg, Zoe Mikva, Newton Minow. In June 1998, the Board of Directors committed $2 million as the first donor to the Chicago Public Education Fund, which was incorporated as a non-profit organization on January 29, 1999. The Chicago Tribune Charities became the second lead donor with a commitment of $500,000, with substantial gifts from the Pritzker Foundation and the Polk Bros. Foundation and a number of smaller donations boosting its funds to almost $4 million by March 2000. In September 1999, the Chicago Public Education Fund hired its first president, Janet M. Knupp, who was previously executive director of Chicago Communities In Schools (where she was a successor of its founding executive director Alice Palmer); and in the fall of 1999 issued its first RFPs. The Chicago Public Education Fund and its first grants of $1.5 million were announced to the public on March 28, 2000; its 12-member Board of DirectorsChicago Public Education Fund Board of Directors, March 28, 2000: Scott C. Smith (chairman), David P. Gomez, Anne C. Hallett, Mellody Hobson, Leon Jackson, Martin J. Koldyke, John W. McCarter, Jr., Penny Pritzker, Bruce V. Rauner, Timothy R. Schwertfeger, Adele Smith Simmons, Clare M. Mu√±ana (ex officio). was chaired by CAC board member Scott C. Smith, president, CEO and publisher of the Chicago Tribune and chairman of the Chicago Tribune Charities, and included CAC board member John W. McCarter, Jr., as well as Anne Hallett, Adele Smith Simmons, Penny Pritzker, Golden Apple Foundation founder and chairman Martin J. Koldyke, and six other members; with a supplemental advisory Leadership Council of dozens of business and civic leaders, including CAC board members Barack Obama, Edward S. Bottum, Susan Blankenbaker Noyes, James Reynolds, Jr., Nancy S. Searle, and CAC executive director Ken Rolling. Chicago Public Education Fund 22-member Leadership Council in March 2000 included: John Ayers, Thomas G. Ayers, Edward S. Bottum, Sandra Polk Guthman, Iris Krieg, Alfred L. McDougal, Zoe Mikva, Newton Minow, Susan Blankenbaker Noyes, Barack Obama, Jerry Reinsdorf, James Reynolds, Jr., John W. Rogers, Jr., Ken Rolling, and 8 other business and civic leaders; the Leadership Council expanded to 54 members in 2001, including R. Eden Martin, Andrew J. McKenna, Jr. and Nancy S. Searle. Although the Chicago Public Education Fund grew out of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, it differed in having a broad base of contributors instead of just one contributor, and in making fewer, larger, system-wide grants instead of many smaller grants to small networks of schools. The initial focus of the Chicago Public Education Fund was on improving the recruitment, retention and effectiveness of principals and teachers, with: * The LAUNCH program, led by the Chicago Principals & Administrators Association (CPAA), to develop management and leadership skills of principals through a rigorous program including summer sessions at the Kellogg School of Management of Northwestern University. * National Board Certification, to provide a rigorous and consistent standard for assessing and rewarding experienced and accomplished teachers; with the Chicago Public Schools, Chicago Teachers Union, Chicago Principals & Administrators Association, and National-Louis University working to increase the number of Chicago teachers with this certification. * Alternative Certification, to attract talented individuals in math, science, and other fields into public education: ** The Golden Apple Foundation's GATE program, to bring mid-career math and science professionals into the classroom. ** Teach For America, to recruit talented college graduates into some of the neediest schools. ** The Financial Research and Advisory Committee's (FRAC) Teacher Recruitment Initiative, to assess the quality of teachers recruited into the system. Upon its dissolution in 2002, the CAC donated its records (132 boxes containing 947 file folders) to the Richard J. Daley Library at the University of Illinois at Chicago to be made available for public research. The CAC records in the Special Collections department of the Daley Library were briefly closed to public access for two weeks from August 12, 2008 through August 25, 2008 over concerns by the university about their ownership of the records and the confidentiality of some of the information in the records.http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/specialcoll/ = Evaluation = The Annenberg Challenge was criticized from its outset in 1994 and 1995 by conservative proponents of vouchers for private schools, including James Pierson, executive director of the John M. Olin Foundation, Chester E. Finn, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Education (1985‚Äì1988) under Secretary of Education William Bennett in the Reagan administration, founding partner and senior scholar of Chris Whittle's Edison Project new chain of for-profit private schools (1992‚Äì1994), then John M.

Annenberg ignored criticism from conservatives that he was wasting his money on public schools‚Äîhe believed that government had a responsibility to educate its citizens and that the nation could not walk away from its public schools. Annenberg also ignored criticism from within the education and philanthropic worlds that after five years the Challenge had not produced measurable reform‚Äîhe hoped that good would come of his gift, but was realistic and doubted he would ever see any concrete, measurable results. For Annenberg that was not the point‚Äîhis goal was to spur communities and other donors into action‚Äîand in that he was not disappointed, with the Challenge raising an additional $600 million from foundations, businesses, universities and individuals. On June 12, 2002, the Annenberg Foundation released its final report on the Annenberg Challenge to the press and an audience of education leaders and policymakers at a luncheon in Washington D.C., a few blocks from the White House, with Annenberg's wife, Leonore, on hand to represent her 94-year-old husband. The keynote speaker was the George W. Bush administration's Secretary of Education Rod Paige, who had been Houston superintendent of schools (1994‚Äì2001); in 1997, Houston had become the last of nine cities to win a large urban Annenberg Challenge grant over five years. Paige said he had witnessed the good that came from Annenberg's gift and had no doubts about the Annenberg Challenge's accomplishments. The June 2002 final report listed nine lessons learned over the course of the Annenberg Challenge. The first two were: * Lesson 1: Every child benefits from high expectations and standards. ** In Chicago, where the Challenge sought out the most racially isolated and impoverished schools, the elementary students the Challenge worked with went from a half-grade behind the city average to a quarter-grade ahead of peers in other schools. * Lesson 2: Even large gifts like ours are no substitute for adequate, equitable and reliable funding. ** Although the Challenge made multimillion-dollar grants, nearly every site reached out to hundreds of schools. In Chicago, where the Challenge helped more than 300 schools, the typical grant was $39,000 to an elementary school with an annual budget of $3.8 million. An August 2003 final technical report of the Chicago Annenberg Research Project by the Consortium on Chicago School Research said that while \\"student achievement improved across Annenberg Challenge schools as it did across the Chicago Public School system as a whole, results suggest that among the schools it supported, the Challenge had little impact on school improvement and student outcomes, with no statistically significant differences between Annenberg and non-Annenberg schools in rates of achievement gain, classroom behavior, student self-efficacy, and social competence.\\" \\"Breakthrough Schools,\\" which received special financial and professional support from the Challenge between 1999‚Äì2001, a time during which the Challenge began withdrawing funds from other schools, \\"began to develop in ways that distinguished them from other Annenberg schools and sustained or strengthened aspects of teacher professional community school leadership, and relational trust while other Annenberg schools did not.\\"  See also  *Bill Ayers presidential election controversy *Melissa A McKeever presidential election non controversy  References   External links  * The Chicago Annenberg Challenge * The Chicago Annenberg Challenge Records from the Annenberg Foundation Category:Philanthropic organizations based in the United States Category:Annenberg Category:Education in Chicago Category:1995 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Chicago Annenberg Challenge"},{"id":"18185496","text":"William Moseley Jones (1905‚Äì1988) was a Democratic attorney from Montebello, California who served several terms in the California State Assembly, including one term as Speaker.

The three pillars are: * X√∫ GuƒÅngq«ê (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Hs√º Kuang-ch'i; ÂæêÂÖâÂïü, 1562‚Äì1633) of Shanghai * L«ê Zhƒ´z«éo (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Li Chih-tsao; Êùé‰πãËóª, 1565-November 1, 1630) of Hangzhou * Y√°ng T√≠ngy√∫n (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Yang T'ing-y√ºn; Ê•äÂª∑Á≠†, 1557-1627) of Hangzhou Their combined efforts helped lead Hangzhou and Shanghai to become centres of missionary activity in late Ming China.ÊàëÂ≠òÁΩëÁ´ô These men shared an interest in Western science and mathematics, and it is probable that this was what first attracted them to the Jesuits responsible for their conversion.  Origin of name  This name is derived from a passage in Saint Paul‚Äôs letter to the Galatians (2:9): :‚ÄúAnd when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship‚Ä¶\\" The passage in Chinese is somewhat more obvious: :„ÄåÈÇ£Á®±ÁÇ∫ÊïôÊúÉÊü±Áü≥ÁöÑÈõÖÂêÑ„ÄÅÁ£ØÊ≥ï„ÄÅÁ¥ÑÁø∞ÔºåÂ∞±ÂêëÊàëÂíåÂ∑¥ÊãøÂ∑¥Áî®Âè≥ÊâãË°åÁõ∏‰∫§‰πãÁ¶Æ...„Äç wherein it calls James, Peter and John the \\"pillars of the Church\\". The inevitable connection was then seen between the \\"pillars\\" of the early Church and the three men who helped to evangelize Ming China.  Xu Guangqi  Xu Guangqi was a Chinese scholar-bureaucrat, Catholic convert, agricultural scientist, astronomer, and mathematician. He holds the title of Servant of God, and received his beatification in April 2011.http://shanghaiist.com/2011/04/18/xu-guangqi-beatification.php He contributed to the translation of the first parts of Euclid's Elements into Chinese. He also worked on the reform of the Chinese calendar, which constituted the first major collaboration between scientists from Europe and from the Far East, though it was completed after his death.  Yang Tingyun  Yang Tingyun was born into a devout Buddhist family. At the age of 35 (1592), after taking the Imperial Examinations he became an Inspector in the imperial ministries. In 1600 he met Matteo Ricci, one of the founding fathers of missionary activity in China, but did not convert or receive Baptism at that time. He worked with Ricci and other Jesuits to publish China's first global atlas, the Zhifang waiji. Later however, in 1611, Yang accompanied a fellow official Li Zhizao back to Hangzhou to arrange for his late father's funeral, and saw that Li had not only thrown out his home's Buddhist statues and imagery, but that he did not send for Buddhist priests to give the man his last rites. Instead, he had brought two Jesuit priests, Lazzaro Cattaneo and Nicolas Trigault, to do the job and a Chinese monk Zh≈çng M√≠ngr√©n (ÈçæÈ≥¥‰ªÅ) to explain the rite's significance to the gathered friends and relatives. One month later, impressed by Li's newfound piety, he abandoned his concubine and was himself baptized, receiving the Christian name \\"Michael\\" (M√≠'√©'ƒõr ÂΩåÈ°çÁàæ). Of particular significance is Yang Tingyun's willingness to abandon status symbols such as his family's traditional beliefs and the concubine, for these were some of the main obstacles in the way of the Jesuit mission to China. In the same way that he was impressed by Li Zhizao's conversion (see below), many other Chinese were impressed by his and followed his example, starting with the 30 members of his family and then moving on to his friends, in total convincing over 100 people to accept Christ. His other notable contributions to Christianity in China include his funding of the missionaries in Hangzhou, granting them the use of his estate as their base of operations; using his influence and wealth to offer protection and shelter to Christian refugees during periods of anti-Christian unrest; and also the buying up of land at Tianshui Bridge (Â§©Ê∞¥Ê©ã) and Dafangjing (Â§ßÊñπ‰∫ï) to build the first church in Hangzhou and the Jesuit Cemetery. When the church had for the most part been completed, Yang became severely ill. Knowing it was his end, Yang Tingyun requested the sacraments from the priest, and in January 1628, at the age of 71, died. Because he had been seen as a great scholar and man of excellent moral fibre, the people of Hangzhou had him honoured in the XiƒÅngxi√°n C√≠ (ÈÑïË≥¢Á•†), a hall for honouring local heroes and ancestors. = Writings = * Light Emitted by Heaven, TiƒÅn sh√¨ m√≠ng bi√†n „ÄäÂ§©ÈáãÊòéËæ®„Äã, is a treatise on the union of Confucianist and Christian thought. He writes, ::A spiritual nature is God's gift to man, and it is the greatest gift of all, ... benevolence, righteousness, social etiquette, and wisdom [the four Confucianist virtues] are all indeed of this nature. These things that God has given us are what we've had all along.

Li Zhizao  Li Zhizao was a successful Hangzhounese official who held various posts around China, the most notable of which were in Nanjing and what is now called Puyang County in Henan Province. He was known by the courtesy names of W«íc√∫n (ÊàëÂ≠ò) and Zh√®nzhƒ´ (ÊåØ‰πã), as well as by the pseudonym \\"The Man of Liangyan\\" (Ê∂ºÂ∫µÂ±ÖÂ£´, alternative writings: Ê∂ºÂ∫µÈÄ∏Ê∞ë, Ê∂ºÂ∫µÂ≠ê, or Ê∂ºÂèü). In 1610, while in Beijing, Li became gravely ill and, without any friends or family in Beijing to care for him, was soon on the verge of death. Fortunately, at that point in his life he became acquainted with the Jesuit Matteo Ricci who took him into his care, treated him \\"as a family member\\", and soon brought him back to health. Ricci also during this time taught him much of Western science, mathematics, and Catholicism. Shortly thereafter Li Zhizao was baptized and given the Christian name \\"Leon\\" (li√°ng ËâØ).Êùé‰πãËóª, Êù≠Â∑û‰ΩôÊù≠ÊîøÂ∫úÈó®Êà∑ÁΩëÁ´ô After converting, Li Zhizao took an oath saying, \\"As long as I live, all that God has given me, I shall put to good use for Him.\\" While still in Beijing, he presented Matteo Ricci with 100 taels of gold for the purpose of building a church there. Later Li would also be responsible for introducing Catholicism to his hometown of Hangzhou. The year after he returned home for his father's funeral, he brought with him two other Jesuit missionaries. In 1625 he was the first to publish the Chinese text of the Nestorian Stele. = Writings = Li Zhizao was responsible for translating many works of Western science and mathematics into Chinese. *Plea to Translate Books on Western Calendar Methods, Q«êng y√¨ xƒ´ y√°ng l√¨ f«é dƒõng sh≈´ sh≈´ „ÄäË´ãË≠ØË•øÊ¥ãÊõÜÊ≥ïÁ≠âÊõ∏Áñè„Äã, was submitted to the Ming dynasty Wanli Emperor, beseeching him to hire missionaries and have them make corrections to the Chinese calendar.

He is in love with his model, Bebe Larvache, who cares nothing for him. Bebe meets a wealthy American, Dennis O'Keefe (John Gilbert) and they fall in love. A jealous Santados teams up with Father Marionette and they plot to get rid of O'Keefe. Meanwhile, O'Keefe's father, who strenuously objects to the relationship, convinces Bebe to leave his son alone, for his own good. She asks that she may spend one final night with Dennis at the Mardi Gras Festival. O'Keefe goes to pick Larvache up at the studio but Santados maneuvers her into a compromising position to make O'Keefe think that she is cheating on him. As the heartbroken O'Keefe leaves, he is captured by Marionette, who tortures him in the wax museum. Marionette calls Santados, and Bebe hears O'Keefe's voice over the phone. A friend of O'Keefe's, Georges Morier, manages to rescue him in time and rush him to the hospital where O'Keefe's father finally consents to the marriage.

Farrell MacDonald as George Morier Production Tourneur shot the film in 1920 under the title The Glory of Love, but due to its gruesome nature, he was not able to get it released for three years. In 1923, the W. W. Hodkinson Corporation distributed the film theatrically, after changing the title to While Paris Sleeps. They probably wanted to distribute it since the star of the film, Lon Chaney, had achieved great notoriety in Hollywood during the preceding three years, starring in films such as A Blind Bargain, Outside the Law and The Penalty. Critics commented that the film \\"has all the appearances of a picture that might have been made three or four years ago\\", and they were right. Lon Chaney reunited with John Gilbert in 1924 in He Who Gets Slapped, and director Tod Browning later cast John Gilbert in his 1927 film The Show. Gilbert later became engaged to Greta Garbo, and drifted off into a string of big budget Hollywood romantic drama films before dying in 1936 from heart failure.

He was the CEO of SRI Label Group, a Los Angeles-based, independent record company that specializes in modern and classic jazz, blues, country and rock. In his career as a producer and promoter, he worked with artists ranging from Sammy Davis, Jr. to John Lennon. He licensed recordings worldwide, and worked as a consultant to several major music labels. Early career As a teenager in the early 1960s, Liebowitz was enrolled in The Juilliard School. While studying at Juilliard, he had the opportunity to attend his first recording session. It was soon after that he decided to leave the school to watch and learn hands-on the recording process under top artists and producers. Initially drawn to the industry through performing, he joined a local New York City act called The Phantoms on guitar & vocals.Huffington Post: \\"Music Producer Rocks Old-School In Digital Era\\" http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexandra-holzer/music-producer-rocks- _b_1534439.html Though the group had a strong local following, he realized after a time that his strength and desire was not in performing. Deciding to pursue a career in the business side of recording, he took on jobs in the promotion department for several labels, including Canadian American & Roulette, working his way up to the A&R; department while learning everything he could about the industry.SRI Label Group Website: http://www.srirecords.com Major labels (late 1960s-1980) At Roulette he began a working relationship with Count Basie, who introduced him in turn to Sammy Davis, Jr., an artist who, along with his partners in The Rat Pack, (Frank Sinatra & Dean Martin) Liebowitz would work with through his lifetime. Basie also introduced him to Ella Fitzgerald, with whom Liebowitz would collaborate on several projects. By the 1970s he was moving heavily into production, working with top acts in the jazz and rock worlds, including Miles Davis, the Rolling Stones, Frankie Avalon, and more. In 1978 he was appointed Vice-President of East Coast Operations for Capitol Productions, a management company that represented more than 100 singers, musical groups, songwriters and actors. In this time he also wrote and produced two television pilots for NBC: ‚ÄúAnything Goes‚Äù and ‚ÄúJust for Laughs.‚Äù Neither were picked up. Towards the end of the decade he worked with Harry Nilsson and John Lennon on personal and professional projects, before deciding to leave the big recording companies and create an independent label of his own. Independent (1980-present) In 1980 he left Capitol and formed Belvedere Records, a small independent label focused on rock and country music. The label included several artists carried over from Capitol, along with some new discoveries. In addition to his role as president, he also produced recordings, directed music videos and started a music publishing company division to develop young songwriters. In the early 1980s he donated his services to the Black Music Association to put on two tribute shows at Radio City Music Hall: ‚ÄúTo Basie with Love‚Äù (1982) and ‚ÄúMiles Ahead‚Äù (1983.) Conceived as tributes to Count Basie and Miles Davis respectively, the shows also raised money for the BMA's musical scholarship fund. These were the first of many benefit concerts staged in and around the New York area. In the mid 1980s he sold Belvedere to focus on productions ‚Äì shows, records, and concerts ‚Äì and managing talent. In 1986 he moved to Florida and formed Creative Media, a company with talent management, video, advertising and production divisions. In the following years he signed new talent such as The Johnson Boys, Darrell Chambers, Kim Hoyer, and Da Boyz. It was during this time that Liebowitz produced a benefit concert for the Artificial Reef Foundation called ‚ÄúThe Coconuts Festival‚Äù. In the aftermath of 1992's Hurricane Andrew, Liebowitz co- produced a music video for the Florida Hurricane Relief Fund featuring a rendition of ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll Never Walk Alone‚Äù by one of his recording artists, Darrell Chambers. The filming took place the day after the hurricane in the most devastated areas, with the aid of the Governor's office. It aired within 24 hours of being filmed and helped to raise nearly $4 million in relief funds. In 1996 he took on work as a consultant for The International Jazz Hall of Fame, and assisted in arrangements for host Steve Allen, along with several presenters and sponsors for the IJHF's Inductions Ceremonies. In 1998 Liebowitz moved to Southern California, where he resides currently. There, he acted for a short time as a consultant before founding SRI Records in 1999. He was the executive producer of \\"Judy, Frank & Dean,\\" which aired as part of a pledge drive special nationally for PBS Television stations. This special starred Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. Recent projects Liebowitz has been vocal in his criticism of the modern recording industry, specifically the focus on short-term contracts and lack of artist development. He has also criticized self-publishing artists for the same reason, advocating small independent labels as the best avenue for developing great talent. A recent recording project, Friends and Family, was a duets recording with Ray Brown, Jr., the son of Ella Fitzgerald and Ray Brown, released in September 2008. It features duets with artists Jane Monheit, Melba Moore, James Moody, Maria Muldaur, Dr. John, Dionne Warwick, Freda Payne, Sophie B. Hawkins, Paul Williams, Dr. Lonnie Smith, Dave Somerville, Sally Kellerman, Kim Hoyer, Ella and Haylee Fitzgerald. In 2011, it was announced that he was acting as executive producer on the film The Legend of Fillmore Slim, a biopic of the San Francisco blues legend.Stevie MacKnight Radio: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/comediansteviemack/2009/10/14/steviemacknightradio-1 Rapper Snoop Dogg is slated to play the title role.\\"Snoop Dogg To Topline Fillmore Slim Biopic\\": http://www.deadline.com/2011/09/snoop-dogg-to-topline- fillmore-slim-biopic He is also currently working on ‚ÄúLegs,‚Äù a television pilot with six completed feature-length scripts, as well as a theatrical production, ‚ÄúThe Rock and Roll Bus,‚Äù set on the tour bus of the first integrated rock tour in 1957.

A Canadian Mountie allows an innocent fugitive to escape with the woman he loves. The film is based on the 1919 novel of the same name by American author James Oliver Curwood. Plot When impoverished Nanette Roland refuses to marry Buck McDougall until she is convinced that her long-absent fianc√©, Raoul Challoner, is dead, Buck obtains false evidence of Challoner's death and Nanette yields to his wishes. At their wedding ceremony, Raoul appears and is about to take Nanette away, when Buck attacks him and, in the ensuing battle, Raoul accidentally kills a man and is arrested. That night, Nanette helps him escape and, after a hasty wedding, they flee into the wilderness. Corporal O'Connor of the North- West Mounted Police is given the assignment of capturing him, and three years later, the Mountie, aided by Buck, discovers Raoul's cabin in the woods. Just as he arrests the fugitive, a forest fire breaks out, trapping Nanette, Raoul and their baby in the flames. O'Connor, injured by a fallen tree, is rescued by Raoul and the four reach safety, but Buck perishes in the fire. O'Connor, feeling a debt of gratitude, agrees to testify to Raoul's death and the family realizes that their troubles are at an end. Cast *Betty Blythe as Nanette Roland *Lon Chaney as Raoul Challoner *Lewis Stone as Corporal O'Connor *Francis McDonald as Buck McDougall *Spottiswoode Aitken as Old Roland *Melbourne MacDowell as Duncan McDougall *Charles A. Smiley as The Parson Background MacDowell, Chaney and Blythe Betty Blythe and Lon Chaney were burned while filming the forest fire scene when a blaze that popped up unexpectedly blocked their escape. They were rescued through a tunnel that had been previously built for just such an occurrence, but filming was stopped for ten days while the actors recovered in a local hospital. The crew erected a phony forest on the Universal Studios lot, with fake trees, trimmed with natural foliage, planted in the ground, barked, and painted. The forest fire was filmed with 6 cameras. Although the film was not viewed, onscreen credit information was obtained from a print of the film at the National Archives of Canada. Actor Charles A. Smiley's surname is incorrectly spelled \\"Smily\\" in the film's credits. The 1961 Disney production Nikki, Wild Dog of the North (see AFI Catalog of Feature Films, 1961‚Äì70; F6.3499) is also based on James Oliver Curwood's novel, but the plots of the two films are not similar. A modern source states that the 1953 Allied Artists film Northern Patrol is also based on Curwood's novel, but, again, its plot does not resemble those of the other two films.

Development  The SPAD XII was inspired by the ideas of French flying ace Georges Guynemer, who proposed that a manoeuvrable single-seat aircraft be designed to carry a 37 mm cannon, a weapon which had previously been mounted only in large two-seat \\"pusher\\" aircraft such as the Voisin III. B√©chereau took his own SPAD VII design as the starting point, but the many major and minor changes incorporated into the SPAD XII made it a quite different aircraft. Restored HS.8Ca geared-output engine, similar to the 8Cb used on the SPAD S.XII The gun chosen for the SPAD XII was not the old Hotchkiss cannon but a new 37 mm Semi Automatique Moteur Canon (SAMC), built by Puteaux, for which 12 shots were carried. The Hispano-Suiza aviation engine had to be geared to allow the gun to fire through the propeller shaft. The SPAD XII also carried a single 0.303 inch synchronized (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun mounted on the starboard side of the nose. In order to carry the heavy cannon the airframe was lengthened and the wingspan and wing area increased. The wingtips were rounded rather than squared off and the wings given a slight forward stagger. To accommodate the required geared output propshaft engine, which easily allowed for the hollow propeller shaft for the cannon to fire through, and power the resultingly heavier airframe, compared to the of the SPAD VII, the 180 bhp Hispano-Suiza 8 direct-drive Ab engine was replaced by the geared 220 bhp model 8Cb, and gave the SPAD XII a clockwise rotating propeller, as seen from a \\"nose-on\\" view. Test flown by Guynemer, the early production models of the SPAD XII were highly successful after overcoming initial problems with the reduction gear between engine and propeller. Other aces also had success with the new model. However, deliveries were slow, the SPAD VII and later SPAD XIII having top priority, and even the modest total of 300 aircraft which were ordered were not all completed. Best estimates are only 20 produced. Average pilots found the SPAD XII a difficult aircraft to master, and the cannon difficult to aim and fire, while manual reloading was difficult. The cockpit filled with fumes upon every firing. Its breech mechanism protruded into the cockpit and prevented the use of a conventional stick to control the aircraft, adding to the difficulties encountered by ordinary pilots. The control setup reverted to a split setup on either side of the pilot, a la Deperdussin.  Service  The 13th Aero Squadron SPAD S.XII, showing the slight positive stagger of the wings. No units were entirely equipped with SPAD XIIs. The unknown number of aircraft produced were issued in small numbers, intended for use only by the most skilled pilots, such as Rene Fonck, Lionel de Marmier, Fernand Henri Chavannes, Henri Hay de Slade, Albert Deullin and Fran√ßois Battesti. They were distributed one or two per squadron. Few were delivered to combat units, eight being recorded on strength in April and again in October; this may be contrasted with the thousands of SPAD VIIs and SPAD XIIIs in service.

Supposing it had to be bones, he informed his brother, who in turn, notified the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH; National Institute of Anthropology and History). Since then many studies have been conducted in order to explain the large concentration of bones in the area.

The first studies discussed the possibility that the mammoths were trapped by the flow of an ancient river, or a mudflow (Lahar). Claus Siebe, Peter Schaaf and Jaime Urrutia-Fucugauchi propose the lahar originated from the Popocat√©petl volcano, while the research of S. Gonzalez, D. Huddart, L. Morett-Alatorre, J. Arroyo-Cabrales and O.J. Polaco presents prove that the lahar was caused by the Nevado de Toluca. J. Arroyo-Cabrales, E. Johnson and L. Morett analyzed the fractured bones found in the area, and concluded there was human activity engaged in bone quarrying efforts to produce cores and flakes for future use, similar to the bone technology also seen in North America in the Late Pleistocene to manufacture tools.

San Esteban de Nueva Tlaxcala was a Tlaxcalan municipality in what is now the Mexican state of Coahuila. San Esteban was the northernmost of the six Tlaxcalan colonies established in 1591 at the behest of the Viceroy of New Spain, Luis de Velasco; its founders came from Tizatlan. In 1834, San Esteban was merged into the adjoining city of Saltillo. On the sparsely settled northeastern frontier of Mexico, menaced by hostile American Indians, the Tlaxcalans were allies of the Spanish settlers against the Indians of the region, but also stood apart with an independent society. San Esteban was often in legal controversies with the Spanish settlers of Saltillo.Offutt, Leslie Scott (Jan 2008), \\"Defending Corporate Identity on the Northern New Spanish Frontier: San Esteban de Nueva Tlaxcala,\\" The Americas, Vol 64, No. 3, pp. 357. Downloaded from Project Muse. For simplicity's sake, \\"Spanish\\" and \\"Spaniard\\" in this article refer to all the non-Indian people of the region. Most of the \\"Spanish\\" were, in fact, mixed-blood mestizos. History San Esteban was established as part of a strategy by the Spanish government to end the long-running and destructive Chichimeca War (1550-1590) and to gain control of its northeastern borderlands. The Spanish decided to resettle 400 Tlaxcalan families in the conflicted areas. The Tlaxcalans were Christians and loyal allies of the Spanish. The Tlaxcalans would help the Spanish defend their northern border and pacify the Chichimeca tribes by \\"soft and peaceful means,\\" introducing them to Christianity and Spanish culture and turning them from nomadic hunter- gatherers into sedentary farmers.Guereca Duran, Raquel E. (Jan to Jun 2016), \\"Las milicias tlaxcaltecas en Saltillo y Colotl√°n,\\" Estudios de historia novohispana,, Vol. 54, p. 51, , accessed 30 Dec 2018 The 400 Tlaxcalan families were resettled in six different places, including the struggling Spanish settlement of Saltillo. The resettlement was preceded by a long negotiation between the Spanish authorities and Tlaxcalan leaders. The Tlaxcalans extracted a number of concessions, the most important of which was that their communities would be autonomous, independent of local governments, self-ruled, and answerable only to the office of the Viceroy in Mexico City. Other concessions they received were recognition of the Tlaxcalans as hidalgos (\\"gentlemen,\\" an inheritable status), exemption from tribute and forced labor (the encomienda system), and a prohibition of encroachment on their lands by livestock owned by non-Tlaxcalans.Offutt (2008), pp. 359-360. The Tlaxcalans were also given the right to bear arms as if they were Spaniards and to ride \\"saddled and bridled\\" horses (also as if they were Spaniards).Sheridan Pinto, Cecilia (Jan to Jun 2001), \\"Indios Madrineros: Colonizadores Tlaxcaltecas en el Noreste Novohispano,\\" Estudios de historia novohispana, Vol 24, p. 30 San Esteban would thus be \\"an independent municipality with special privileges that placed it in the netherworld between the Spanish and the indigenous.\\"Offutt (2008), p. 361 In July 1591, 71 Tlaxcalan families and 16 bachelors arrived in Saltillo and the town of San Esteban was foundedSheridan, p. 31. The boundary between Saltillo and San Esteban approximated what is the route in the 21st century of Calle Ignacio Allende in downtown Saltillo. on the western side of the Spanish settlement and separated from the Spaniards only by an irrigation canal. Only 20 Spanish \\"vecinos\\" (property owning householders) lived in Saltillo. Their numbers were diminishing and the settlement was in danger of being extinguished by Chichimeca attacks so the Tlaxcalans were greeted with enthusiasm. The Tlaxcalans armed and equipped their men to assist in defending Saltillo, plus providing a small group, usually 8 to 10 men, to join the Spaniards on expeditions to suppress the nomadic tribes living near Saltillo.Guereca, p. 56-58. In addition to the \\"vecinos\\" there were doubtless also property-less men and families in Saltillo at the time. Although the Chichimeca War had mostly ended, other nomadic tribes, such as the Toboso, in northern Mexico continued to be hostile to the Spaniards. The Tlaxcalans had been tasked by the Viceroy with helping \\"civilize\\" the Chichimeca people. Several hundred formerly-hostile Guachichils were resettled near San Esteban on lands given them as part of a peace agreement. By 1677, San Esteban claimed the Guachichil land as their own, declaring the descendants of the Guachichils as \\"pure Tlaxcalan.\\" The population of San Estaban by then was 1,750. Throughout the more than 200 year history of San Esteban, the Tlaxcalans would claim and strive to maintain their ethnic purity, both out of pride and a desire to keep the privileges granted them in 1591. They married mostly within their own community, and they retained their native language of Nahuatl, as witnessed by the large number of Nahuatl documents, especially wills, preserved from the 17th century.Offutt, Leslie Scott (Jan 2018), \\"Puro tlaxcalteca? Ethnic Integrity and Consciousness in Late Seventeenth-Century Northern New Spain,\\" The Americas,, Vol 75, No. 1, pp. 32-33, 40-45 Tlaxcalan colonies San Esteban sent colonists to the nearby settlement of Parras in 1598 and in the 17th and 18th centuries sent colonists to a dozen other settlements menaced by hostile Indians. The contingents of Tlaxcalans sent to help defend these places and pacify the local Indians usually numbered 10 to 14 families. Thus, Tlaxcalans were widely distributed along the northeastern frontier of Mexico. The Spanish government provided the colonists with tools and seeds and sometimes paid them cash for their collaboration. Tlaxcalan colonists continued to have the privileges they enjoyed in San Esteban de Nueva Tlaxcala.Sheridan Prieto, p. 38 The San Esteban Cathedral is the oldest in Saltillo.Templo de San Esteban, , accessed 1 Jan 2019. Overtaken by events A Spanish priest \\"described San Esteban residents in 1777 as industrious, abhorring laziness and applying themselves enthusiastically to their agricultural labors, and responsible for producing the bulk of vegetables and fruits consumed in neighboring Saltillo.\\"Offutt, Leslie S. (2007), \\"The Nahuatl Testaments of San Esteban,\\" , accessed 1 Jan 2018 Nevertheless, an increasing non-Tlaxcalan population of northeastern Mexico, Indian hostility, drought, and disease began to erode the independence of San Estaban in the 1780s and afterwards. San Estaban steadily lost political and legal battles with the Spanish authorities of Saltillo, and began to struggle more for survival than retaining its traditional privileges and rights.Offutt (2008), pp. 354, 374-375 A reorganization of the colonial government in the 1780s resulted in San Esteban losing much of its autonomy and right of self government.Sheridan Prieto, pp. 43-44 The traditional rights of San Estaban were further eroded after 1821 when Mexican gained independence from Spain. In 1827, San Esteban's name was changed and in 1834 it was merged into the municipality of Saltillo.Esparza Cardenas, Rodolfo (Jan-Mar 2010)), \\"El Ocaso del Pueblo de San Esteban de Nueva Tlaxcala\\", Boletin Digital de Informacion del AGEC, No. 2, pp. 28-23, , accessed 2 Jan 2019 Footnotes References  * * Category:Populated places established in 1591 Category:1827 disestablishments Category:Municipalities of Coahuila Category:History of Tlaxcala Category:Indigenous peoples in Mexico Category:Saltillo ","title":"San Esteban de Nueva Tlaxcala"},{"id":"18185853","text":"Walt Ribeiro (born January 25, 1984) is an American composer of classical music.

Its nearest town is Alton, which lies northeast of the village. According to the 2011 census, the village had a population of 2,036 people. The parish covers an area of and has an average elevation of approximately above sea level. One of the county's high points at , King's Hill, runs through Medstead and Bentworth. The earliest evidence of settlement in the village comes from two Tumuli burial grounds which date from 1000 BC. Roman pottery and coins have also been found in the area. A chapel in the village was first mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086 and was soon replaced by a Norman church. Medstead was one of the first villages in the United Kingdom to receive broadband. The village has six Grade II listed buildings, including the 12th century St Andrew's Church and its war memorial, a farmhouse and a Victorian wheelhouse with a working donkey wheel. The parish contains three individual hamlets; South Town, Soldridge and Hattingley. Medstead also has its own restored railway station on the Watercress Line, services from which connect with the nearest national rail station at Alton railway station. History =Ancient to Roman= Medstead has a history dating back up to 3,000 years. The earliest evidence of settlement in the area comes from two Tumuli burial grounds which are believed to date from 1000 BC, as well as a ringfort which dates from approximately 500 BC. Roman pottery and coins have also been found in the village. The name has been spelt in many different ways in the Middle Ages, including: Maedstede, Maydstede, and Midsted. A theory for the name is that \\"Mid-Stead\\" signified a \\"half way place\\", as in feudal times the village was on a road from Farnham to Winchester. Following the baptism of Cynegils of Wessex in 635, an area of land was granted to the church at Winchester. The area became known as the \\"Liberty of Alresford\\" and contained parts of present-day Old Alresford, New Alresford and Medstead. The first mention of the village itself came from the Domesday Survey of 1086, in which the survey listed a chapel. In 1160, St Andrew's Church was built on the existing site of the chapel and some parts of the original chapel were enlarged. =14th century to Georgian= A map showing the extent of Medstead's parish in 1881. Medstead Manor can be traced from the 14th century. In 1316, the Bishop of Winchester held the manor of Medstead and all adjacent land until 1346 when ownership was transferred. Seven years later, Martin de Hertham and his wife, Isabel, passed control of lands, rents and taxes in Medstead to William de Overton. He was followed by his son, also named William, who held lands in Medstead as well as a settlement called \\"Tadelyng\\" in 1428. By the 18th century, Edward Rookes held Medstead Manor, although it is uncertain if he purchased or inherited it. In 1749, Rookes sold the manor to Sir William Jolliffe for ¬£1400 (), after which the manor of Medstead disappeared from records. In 1852, The British Gazetteer described Medstead as: =Victorian to present day= An underground bunker for the Royal Observer Corps was built in the village in 1863 and was continuously used until its closure in 1968. Medstead's railway station was first opened in August 1868. The 1881 census for the Alton Union Workhouse included three paupers born in Medstead (then named 'Medsted'), including an 86 year old widow labourer, a 63 year old 'disability lunatic' who served as a domestic servant and a 26 year old 'disability idiot'. Medstead's parish boundary was altered in 1973 after the ecclesiastical parish of Four Marks was created. Medstead received broadband internet in 2003, becoming one of the first villages in the United Kingdom to be connected. In 2018, Medstead's upgrade to Superfast broadband was completed as part of a county-wide initiative. Transport Medstead and Four Marks railway station from the east. Medstead's railway station was first opened in August 1868 and was renamed to Medstead and Four Marks railway station on 1 October 1937. Having closed in 1973, the station was restored and re-opened in May 1983, following the reopening of the associated Watercress Line from New Alresford to Ropley having re-opened six years earlier in 1977; the decision was taken by Mid Hants Railway to restore the entire railway so that it could run its course to the town of Alton. Around of second hand track panels were purchased from Eastleigh for the Medstead and Four Marks section. The surviving buildings at the railway station were dilapidated, with one writer from a magazine suggesting they be demolished and replaced by a bus shelter. As the track was relaid at the station, a replacement wooden signal box was obtained from Wilton and placed into position near the track. Geography Medstead is located in the eastern central part of Hampshire in South East England, southwest of Alton, its nearest town. The parish covers an area of and has an average elevation of approximately above sea level. Before parts of the parish were ceded to Four Marks in 1973, Medstead's parish contained and its highest point was . The landscape is dominated by farms and woodland such as Medstead Grange, Imber Farm and Bushy Leaze Wood. The parish contains three individual hamlets: South Town, Soldridge and Hattingley. One of the Hampshire's high points at 716 feet (218 m), King's Hill, runs through Medstead and Bentworth. =Climate= Due to its location in south central England and its proximity to the sea, the average maximum temperature in January is 7.2 ¬∞C (45 ¬∞F) with the average minimum being 1.6 ¬∞C (35 ¬∞F). The average maximum temperature in July is 21.9 ¬∞C (71 ¬∞F), with the average minimum being 12.5 ¬∞C (55 ¬∞F).

The 2011 census reported an almost equal number of males (1016, 49.9%) as females (1020, 50.1%), of which the majority (1988, 97.6%) were white ethnicity, broadly similar to the ethnical diversity of the wider Hampshire region, where 111,635 (96.56%) are registered on the 2011 census as being white ethnicity. Education and activities Medstead Church of England Primary School lies immediately south of the village near the cemetery. Under the Education Act 1944, the previous site of Medstead's school was declared inadequate as it did not have enough space to accommodate a playing field and assembly hall. The school was consequently relocated to a larger site south of the village, where it is today. A pre-school has been in operation since September 1989, located in the grounds of the primary school after a successful petition ensured its relocation from the village hall. The village hall is used for various activities, including hosting the village's gardening and lawn tennis clubs. In addition, Medstead has its own cricket club which has been in operation for over 150 years and a Bowls Club occupying a playing field which houses eight rinks. The main village hall was first built in the 1970s and has a capacity of 200 people; 150 people can be accommodated seated around tables or 120 for formal occasions. A separate small hall can accommodate 50 people with en suite kitchen and a separate bar area. Governance The village falls under the East Hampshire parliament constituency, represented in the House of Commons by Conservative MP Damian Hinds since 2010. In County Council elections, Hampshire is divided into 75 electoral divisions that return a total of 78 councillors; Medstead, along with Bentworth, is in Alton Rural Electoral Division. In district council elections, East Hampshire is divided into 38 electoral wards that return a total of 44 councillors; Medstead is in Downland Electoral Ward, together with Four Marks. Landmarks St Andrew's Church from the south side. A chapel in the village was first mentioned in the Domesday Survey in 1086. The Norman church of St Andrew was first constructed in 1160 after the previous chapel was demolished. The church has flint walls whereas its chancel has cemented walls, along with windows dating from the 14th century. The church was restored in the 19th century, along with a nave extension and the addition of a new chancel arch. The churchyard has a Grade II listed war memorial which is dedicated to fallen soldiers of the First World War. The memorial is made out of Cornish granite and features a Celtic cross with a crusader's sword sculpted in its centre; it was unveiled on 17 October 1920 by Admiral Jervoise and dedicated by the rector of St Andrew's Church. Medstead contains a total of six Grade II listed buildings. Southdown Old Farmhouse is a small manor which dates from the 18th century and has undergone 20th century restorations and extensions; the manor was designated as a listed building on 31 May 1985. Another Grade II listed building is a Victorian wheelhouse with a donkey wheel which lies immediately southwest of Southdown Old Farmhouse. The wheelhouse was built in the early 19th century and consists of weatherboarded timber frames on brick plinths. The donkey wheel is in working order and is made of a large timber axle with a rope hanging over a well.

The company is owned by OSI Systems. The company headquarters, in Torrance, California, USA, is the primary location for research and development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and customer service support. Their European headquarters, and home to Rapiscan Systems Limited, is in Salfords in Surrey, England, near Gatwick Airport. The primary centre for development and distribution of X-ray systems for hold- baggage screening is also at Salfords. In Espoo, Finland, Rapiscan Systems designs and manufactures its Metor Metal Detectors, used in people-screening applications. Rapiscan also has significant research and development, distribution, support, and manufacturing facilities in Melbourne, Australia; Singapore; Sunnyvale, California in the USA; Johor Bahru in Malaysia; Ocean Springs, Mississippi in the USA; and Hyderabad in India. The company is certified to the ISO 9001:2008 Quality Standard. History Rapiscan was formed in the United Kingdom in 1972 as the Security Products Division of International Aeradio Limited (IAL). This company then acquired metal detector manufacturer Adams Electronics in 1984. Two years later Rapiscan's X-Ray Division and Adams Electronics were combined as IAL Security Products, located in Crawley, West Sussex. In 1993 Opto Sensors, Inc. in the United States formed Rapiscan Security Products, Inc., which then acquired Rapiscan in the UK. Opto Sensors, Inc. became OSI Systems. Rapiscan Metor walk-through metal detectors stem originally from Outokumpu, which was one of the first companies to develop walk-through metal detectors for security screening. The systems were originally adapted from metal detectors used in the mining industry to locate parts of broken drill bits in minerals on a conveyor belt.Jarvi, A., Leinonen, E., Thompson, M., Valkonen, K., Designing Modern Walk-Through Metal Detectors, ASTM Digital Library / STP / STP1127-EB / STP15320S, January 1992, The Metor company was spun off from Outokumpu and later acquired by Rapiscan. As of 2008, the company had installed more than 50,000 security and inspection systems globally, and in April 2008, Rapiscan Systems UK won the Queen's Award for International Trade in recognition of its growth over the previous three years, tripling its revenue during 2005-2007. Rapiscan manufactures a controversial backscatter X-ray system for screening airport passengers, the Rapiscan Secure 1000.Steven W. Smith / Original Developer of Secure 1000 On 23 September 1998 the device's inventor, Steven Smith, assuaged the concerns of radiation security experts about the possible risk posed to people by the device, saying \\"The places I think you are not going to see these in the next five years is lower-security facilities, particularly power plants, embassies, courthouses, airports, and governments...I would be extremely surprised in the next five to 10 years if the Secure 1000 is sold to any of these.\\" The company has developed a fast 3D X-ray CT scanner for hold-luggage, the RTT80. They announced in 2008 that this scanner would undergo tests in Manchester Airport and that it would shortly undergo testing by the TSA. The system was originally developed by CXR Ltd in Surrey, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded a grant for the School of Mathematics, University of Manchester to work on the reconstruction problem for Rapiscan. The RTT80 has an 80 cm diameter opening, and the RTT110, a 1.02m aperture. Teaming with the University of Manchester and Manchester Airport, they started a research project, EMBody, to develop the \\"next generation walk- by metal detector\\".

The SPAD 11 was the work of Louis B√©chereau, chief designer of the Soci√©t√© Pour L'Aviation et ses D√©riv√©s (SPAD), who also designed the highly successful SPAD 7 and SPAD 13 single-seat fighter aircraft. It was developed under military specification C2, which called for a two-seat fighter aircraft. As a result of its failure to meet the levels of performance and agility demanded by the C2 specification, the SPAD 11 was used, along with the more successful Salmson 2 and Breguet 14, to replace aging Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter and Dorand AR reconnaissance aircraft. Persistent problems with the SPAD 11 led to its early replacement by the SPAD S.XVI or SPAD 16 variant. The SPAD 11 had some resemblance to B√©chereau's single-seat fighters and employed much the same method of simple construction. Longer and heavier than the fighters, the SPAD 11's lower wings were designed with cut- outs to improve the observer's view of the ground. The aircraft was armed with a single 0.303-inch (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun firing forward and a single Lewis machine gun of the same calibre on a flexible mount for the observer. Testing of the SPAD 11 showed a poor performance, said to be little better than that of the SPAD S.A of 1915 and it was rejected as a C.2 class fighter aircraft, being reclassified as an A.2 reconnaissance aircraft. Further problems were encountered with the SPAD 11's Hispano-Suiza 8B engine. Some aircraft were fitted with a 12-cylinder Renault engine, but this lowered the aircraft's poor performance yet more. Handling problems were encountered, including tail-heaviness, making the aircraft tiring to fly, and a propensity to stall. In spite of these flaws, the SPAD was still superior to the Sopwiths and Dorands, and 12 squadrons were fully equipped with SPAD 11s. Some 1,000 SPAD 11s were built, most of which were out of service by the autumn of 1918, generally replaced by the SPAD S.XVI. Three Belgian squadrons used the SPAD 11 and two from the United States. The SPAD 11 was unpopular in American service, as in French, and so much so that one of the two squadrons issued with SPADs replaced them with Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutters. Uruguay purchased a small number of aircraft after the war and some examples are known to have been used by Russia and Japan. A single SPAD 11 was modified as a night-fighter, fitted with a searchlight on a framework mounted ahead of the propellor, under the Cn2 specification. SPAD S.XVI The SPAD 16 was a development of the SPAD 11. Essentially a SPAD 11 with a Lorraine-Dietrich engine of 240 bhp, or 250 bhp according to some sources. The new engine, while more powerful, resulted in a heavier aircraft and performance was slightly inferior to the SPAD 11. The original handling problems were largely unresolved. The SPAD 16 arrived at the front line around the end of 1917. It equipped 27 French squadrons and 305 two-seater SPADs, mainly SPAD 16s, were in service with French reconnaissance squadrons at the armistice, as opposed to 530 Salmson and 645 Breguet reconnaissance aircraft. The SPAD 16 served with five post-war French squadrons. Six SPAD 16s were bought by the United States. One of these, flown by Billy Mitchell, is preserved at the National Air and Space Museum. He personally flew reconnaissance missions in it when the Second Battle of the Marne started in the Ch√¢teau-Thierry sector, in July 1918. The exact number of SPAD 16s built is uncertain but was probably around 1,000.

It is known for its flagship courses, the Junior Associate of Indian Institute of Bankers (JAIIB)/Diploma in Banking and Finance(DBF) and the Certified Associate of Indian Institute of Bankers (CAIIB). It is the professional institute for Bankers in India. With its membership of over 700 banks and financial institutions as institutional members and about 300,000 of their employees as individual members, IIBF is the largest Institute of its kind in the world.  History  The institute was founded in 1928 as the Indian Institute of Bankers on the model of the London Institute of Banking and Finance to train bankers and finance professionals. In 1925, with the encouragement of Sir Basil Blackett, the finance member in the executive council of the Viceroy of India, the Imperial Bank of India wrote a letter to The London Institute of Bankers requesting the bank to include questions on Indian banking in the institute's examinations failing which banks in India would have to start their own institute. In a reply dated 25 October 1925, Ernest Sykes, the Secretary of the London Institute of Bankers, encouraged Indian bankers to start their own institute. A detailed discussion was held on the subject at the board room of the Bombay head office of the Imperial Bank of India on 12 March 1927 and the Indian Institute of Bankers was established as a result on 30 April 1928 with Sir Norcot Warren, Managing Governor of the Imperial Bank of India as the first President. Sir Warren retired shortly afterwards and was succeeded by Sir Norman Murray. The first general meeting was held at Bombay on 9 July 1928 and the institute conducted its first associate examinations between 6 and 13 April 1929. A total of 89 candidates appeared for the examination of whom, only one, T. M. Srinivasaraghavan of the Imperial Bank of India, Cuddapah passed both parts of the two-part examination.

Photo: NASA Native copper specimen from the New Cornelia mine. Size 6.4 x 4.7 x 4.6 cm. Shattuckite with malachite, polished specimen, New Cornelia mine. Size 5.3 x 5.1 x 5.0 cm. The New Cornelia mine is a currently inactive open-pit copper mine in Pima County, Arizona, United States. It was the only productive mine in the Ajo mining district, and is located just outside the town of Ajo, which was built as a company town to serve the New Cornelia mines. The roughly circular pit is one and a half miles across at its widest point, and 1,100 feet deep at the center. History, archaeological mining history Native Americans had long mined surface exposures of copper veins near the New Cornelia for pigments: red copper oxide and green copper carbonate. Spanish miners are known to have excavated test shafts in the area by 1750, but the amount of copper produced is not known. Americans claimed the location in 1854 and shipped a few loads of selected ore to Swansea, Wales, but high transportation charges left little or no profit, and the mine was abandoned.James Gilluly (1946) The Ajo mining district, Arizona, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 209, p.98 Development of the property was delayed because of its remote location in the Sonoran Desert. The low-grade copper ore could not be economically shipped to a smelter, and had to be concentrated at the site. The Cornelia Copper Company was organized by businessmen from St. Louis in 1900 to develop the property. However, early owners fumbled in their search for a suitable treatment process, and fell victim to \\"process men\\". In 1906 the owners contracted with Fred McGahan to build his unique \\"vacuum smelter\\" to treat the ore. The following year the company had McGahan indicted for obtaining money under false pretenses. It then arranged with another inventor to build facilities to treat the ore by the unproven \\"Anderson Process\\", which proved just as useless as McGahan‚Äôs process. A United States Geological Survey author later described these processes as \\"... among the most bizarre ever to have been floated in American mining.\\"James Gilluly (1946) The Ajo mining district, Arizona, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 209, p.99 Mining commentator Horace Stevens wrote: :\\"The officers of the Cornelia are residents of St. Louis and vicinity, of excellent local standing, and perfectly sincere in their operations, but are totally lacking in practical knowledge of the copper business, and prone to overmuch experimentation with new processes.\\"Horace J. Stevens, The Copper Handbook, v.8 (Houghton, Mich.: Horace Stevens, 1908) 600-601. The company reorganized as the New Cornelia Mining Company. In 1911, the Calumet and Arizona Mining Company, which already had a major operation in Bisbee, took an option to buy 70 percent of New Cornelia stock. Calumet and Arizona confirmed the existence of a large copper carbonate orebody, and exercised the option. It then found a practical way to treat the ore, and located a sufficient source of water several miles north. A pilot plant began operation in 1915, and a railroad connection via Gila Bend was completed in 1916. Full-scale mining using steam shovels was started in 1917, making the New Cornelia the first large open pit mine in Arizona.C. A. Anderson, (1969) Copper, in Mineral and Water Resources of Arizona, Arizona Bureau of Mines, Bulletin 180, p.128. Mining and treatment of the underlying but lower-grade copper sulfide orebody began in 1924. New Cornelia came under the ownership of Phelps Dodge in 1931 when Calumet and Arizona merged with Phelps Dodge. New Cornelia Mine came under the ownership of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Corporation, when it acquired Phelps Dodge, to become the largest publicly traded copper producer in the world in 2007. The mine was shut down in 1983 due to low copper prices, and a worker dispute with the local union. Some of the minerals, that were byproducts of the mining / refining process, are currently being removed and sold for alternative uses by the Minerals Research and Recovery corporation under contract with Freeport McMoRan, (2012), which purchased the New Cornelia Mine in their 2007 acquisition of the Phelps Dodge Corporation. Copper production from the mine totaled 6.304 billion pounds of copper,Arizona Dept. of Mines and Mineral Resources, 2008, Arizona's Metallic Resources Trends and Opportunities - 2008 PDF file, retrieved 9 January 2009. worth about US$20.8 billion at the 2010 copper price of $3.30/pound.

Almost all important party leaders were present to hear Hitler declare the ongoing destruction of the Jewish race, yet it remains less known than the later Wannsee Conference. Background The announcement Hitler made on 12 December to the Reichsleiter and Gauleiter refers to an earlier statement he had made on 30 January 1939: With the entry of Japan and the United States into the Second World War on 7 December 1941 and the resulting declaration of war on the US by Nazi Germany on 11 December, the war, especially in regard to the above statement, had become truly a World War. Hitler announced this declaration of war on 11 December in the German Reichstag, a speech also broadcast on radio. On 12 December 1941, he had a meeting with the most important Nazi leaders. The meeting On the afternoon of 12 December, Hitler ordered the leading members of the Nazi Party to a meeting in his private rooms at the Reich Chancellery. Because the meeting took place in private rooms rather than Hitler's office, no official record of it exists. However, entries in the diaries of Joseph Goebbels and Hans Frank confirm it. Goebbels made the following entry in his diary for 12 December: Apart from the fact that the European war had turned into a world war, another reason for this shift must be seen in the fact that the entry of the United States into the war meant that the Jewish population had lost its value for Hitler as hostages deterring the United States from becoming an active member of the Allied coalition, and he was finally free to act according to his long-term plans. Hitler's presence at the Chancellery meeting undermines claims that he was ignorant of the Holocaust and that it was carried out by subordinates without his knowledge. The meeting marked a turning point in the Nazi regime's attitude towards the Jewish people. It was part of a shift from propaganda, intimidation and attacks to outright and planned extermination. The latter step had already been taken in some parts of Eastern Europe as early as August 1941. The much more well-known Wannsee Conference in January 1942 marked the next step in the Nazis' plans to exterminate the Jews. Attendance Attendance in this meeting was obligatory for Nazis in high party offices. No official list of the people who attended this meeting exists, but the following leaders of Nazi Germany, out of the about 50 present, are known to have been there: * Adolf Hitler * Heinrich Himmler * Joseph Goebbels * Martin Bormann * Hans Frank * Philipp Bouhler In addition, Christian Gerlach writes that it is \\"virtually certain\\" that Alfred Rosenberg; Gauleiters Arthur Greiser, Fritz Bracht, and Fritz Sauckel; Reichskommissars Hinrich Lohse and Erich Koch; and Alfred Meyer were present. Known to have been absent from this meeting were Hermann G√∂ring and probably Reinhard Heydrich. Neither one of them held a party office.

On April 3, 1982, Stephanie Roper, a 22-year-old, was kidnapped, repeatedly and brutally raped, tortured, shot, set afire, and partially dismembered. Murder Roper was home on a college break, and she and a friend were returning from an evening with friends at a West End Washington, D.C. bar, the \\"Twenty-First Amendment\\" late at night. After dropping her friend off in Brandywine, Maryland, Stephanie proceeded toward her own home in Croom, but her car became disabled on a dark rural road. Two men stopped and instead of helping, kidnapped her at gunpoint. The two men, Jack Ronald Jones and Jerry Lee Beatty, kidnapped Stephanie and took her to an abandoned shack in St. Mary's County. There she was tortured and raped repeatedly. One of the men called the other by his first name. Afraid now that Stephanie knew his name, they decided to kill her. Stephanie made several attempts to escape and upon her last capture, her skull was fractured with a logging chain and she was shot to death. In order to hinder identification, the murderers burned her body and severed her hands. They were captured after the younger man bragged about his part in the crime. Both men were charged with kidnapping, rape, and felony murder. The primary killer was convicted in Baltimore County while his co-defendant pleaded guilty to the same charges in Anne Arundel County. Both courts imposed sentences of two concurrent life sentences, with parole eligibility after twelve years. Family response The Roper family was excluded from observing the trial and was denied the opportunity to present a victim impact statement at sentencing. Stephanie's mother, Roberta Roper, has taken on the cause of victims' rights, including the right of victims' families to address the court before sentencing. She actively lobbies and advocates for rights and support services to crime victims and their survivors. She and her husband, Vincent, formed the Stephanie Roper Committee and Foundation, Inc. and she served as its Executive Director for 20 years. The agency is now known as the Maryland Crime Victims' Resource Center, Inc. (MCVRC). Roberta Roper has dedicated her life to these causes. She serves as the Chair of the MCVRC Board of Directors and co-chairs the National Victims' Constitutional Amendment Network. Crime Victims' Rights Act The Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2004 was named, in part, for Stephanie Roper, whose parents were not notified of trial continuances, were excluded from proceedings, and were prevented from giving a victim impact statement.

It was also one of the last works of the firm of Peabody, Wilson & Brown. For these reasons it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, the only property in Mineola listed so far. Building All six sides of the two-story steel frame building are faced in brick laid in Flemish bond. The entrance terrace is granite, paved with bluestone and using limestone coping, flanked with iron lampposts. The middle three of the five bays are recessed to allow for the limestone enframements around the double doors. Each window bay is topped by a roundel and bronze grille in an abstract eagle form. \\"United States Post Office\\" is spelled out by bronze letters between the roundels, and \\"Mineola, New York\\" is carved into the frieze above the main entrance. The entire structure is topped by limestone coping and a flat roof. The interior retains the original pink Tennessee marble wainscoting with a dark marble baseboard. The walls above the marble are plaster with a molded cornice between them and the ceiling. The floor is terrazzo with embedded brass strips dividing it into areas of different color. Unusually for a post office of this size built during the 1930s, there is no mural or other artwork of the type commissioned by the Works Progress Administration in the lobby. History Unincorporated Mineola was already a central community of a primarily agricultural area when it was chosen as the seat of the newly formed county in 1899. In the early decades of the next century, improvements to rail and road transport led to the beginning of suburbanization in Nassau County and the Mineola area. The growth required, among many other things, new postal facilities. In 1931 an amendment to the Public Buildings Act of 1926 authorized the construction of 136 new post offices in New York. Sixteen of these were to be in Long Island, including Mineola. The site was purchased in 1933, and Peabody, Wilson & Brown, a New York firm best known for some large estates on Long Island such as Charles Millard Pratt's Seamoor in Glen Cove and the Huntington Town Hall. A.J. Paretta Contracting of Long Island City began work in 1935, finishing the following year. The Mineola post office is the only federal commission the Peabody Wilson firm is known to have undertaken, and one of its last. Julian Livingston Peabody and his wife drowned in January 1935 in the sinking of the passenger liner SS Mohawk off New Jersey, and Archibald Manning Brown left the firm that same year to head the design team planning the Harlem River Houses, the first federally financed housing project in New York City. Aesthetic The Colonial Revival style had been popular for new post offices in New York from 1905 on, when the Geneva post office in the Finger Lakes region became the first in the state to use it. It was heavily used in the 1920s and later on in the 1930s, when new construction intensified as the government tried to alleviate the effects of the Great Depression. With a few exceptions,The post offices in the Hudson Valley communities of Hyde Park, Poughkeepsie, Rhinebeck and Wappingers Falls were designed to emulate some no-longer-extant local colonial buildings, at the behest of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a native of the area. elements of Colonial buildings were used without trying to emulate any specific building. Aspects of the Mineola post office that most strongly reflect this are its entrance enframements, pediments, roundels and windows. The 1930s also saw the emergence of the Art Deco and associated modernist styles. These made their mark on the Mineola post office in its flat roof, broad limestone decoration and the absence of cornices at the roof line. The abstracted eagle shapes in the roundel grilles are also another touch more in keeping with modernism than Colonial Revival.

Designed by Hassell and Fitzpatrick + Partners, it included the restoration of the surrounding historic Newspaper House Group of Buildings, comprising four heritage-listed buildings, constructed between 1910 and 1932. The offset core protects the enclosed space by buffering the fa√ßade against the adverse northern sun and the associated solar heat gain. Externally, the expressive structural east and west exoskeletons create the distinctive tower aesthetic. The vertical expression of the tower structure accentuates the height of the building, which terminates in a tapered structural roof crown. Tower 2 was designed by Woods Bagot. It features large column-free floor plates of approximately 2,100 square metres. The project also incorporates a sheltered upper-level walkway across Mounts Bay Road to provide greater connectivity between the Elizabeth Quay Bus Station, Elizabeth Quay Train Station and Perth's CBD.

Career =Early years= Berry started his radio career reading news on Radio Caroline in 1965. Before that he had performed administrative duties at Granada Television and Westward Television and went on to do similar for Radio Caroline. After the Marine Offences Act came into force Berry spent time with more administrative duties for the newly opened Yorkshire Television while working as a club DJ, moving on to work in record promotion, and BBC Radio Medway as a Saturday afternoon presenter. He also spent the summer of 1971 as an announcer for HTV. Berry had a brief stint with BBC Radio 1 writing and presenting programme trails, before joining BBC Radio 2 as an announcer/presenter in 1973, where he stayed on the staff for thirty-three years, presenting such shows as Night Ride, The Late Show, Music Through Midnight, European Pop Jury, Band Parade, The Early Show, You & The Night & The Music and countless other shows and concerts. He also deputised for most of the main daytime presenters, including Terry Wogan, Jimmy Young and David Hamilton. During this lengthy period Berry presented programmes for BFBS, and also Inflight Productions for which he remains on their list of presenters. Berry was the UK spokesman for the Eurovision Song Contest for many years, reading out the country's voting results. This was a role he held between 1977 and 2002, with the exceptions of 1980 and 1998. He was also the stand-by television commentator, in case the line of Terry Wogan was lost. This never happened, though it nearly did on one occasion, just 30 seconds before the show began. Berry also appeared on other shows including The Generation Game, Blankety Blank and Bargain Hunt. =Freelance= After going freelance in 2006, Berry continued reading the news on Radio 2 up until September 2012 when big changes occurred resulting in the majority of Radio 2 news summaries being read by journalists. Having presented late night Saturdays on BBC Three Counties from 2004, during 2009 and 2010 Berry presented a weekly show for BBC Local Radio across the Eastern Counties - The Saturday Club: 6 to 9pm, playing music from the 1960s and 1970s. He still has an occasional series for BBC Three Counties Radio - A Little Light Music, along with other music shows on or around Bank Holidays. He has also been heard on The Vintage Top 40 Show periodically on various BBC Local Stations at 5pm on Sundays. Berry was the regular cover for Richard Spendlove's long running show on BBC Local Radio in the east and south east of England on Saturday nights until April 2017. He is represented by BigFish Media for his voiceover work.

Reactor statistics The below summary is from the 2016‚Äì2017 Annual Progress Report submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission: Specifications The reactor core is situated inside a standing pool of high-purity light water on a grid plate suspended from a movable rail bridge. The pool holds of this water in a concrete casing that is at the base with a depth of . The approximately 19 fuel elements contain between 9 and 18 low-enriched uranium fuel plates. The reactor has a maximum power output of 200 kilowatts. The power produced is all thermal energy, and none of it is used to make electricity. The reactor uses a total of four control rods. Three of these control rods are used for coarse power control and emergency SCRAM shutdowns and utilize a combination of stainless steel and boron. The other control rod is used for fine power control and simply uses stainless steel. The building houses several experimental facilities. These facilities are used for research and for classroom lab activities. A thermal column, consisting of a block of graphite, provides a source of slow neutrons. A diameter aluminum tube, called a beam port, can be positioned between the reactor core and an experimental area in the ground floor of the reactor building, allowing irradiation of a sample with higher energy neutrons. Other facilities, called rabbits, are used to pneumatically inject a sample directly into the core of the reactor for a specified amount of time. One of the rabbit facilities is lined with cadmium in order to stop low-energy neutrons while allowing bombardment of the sample with high-energy neutrons. Noteworthy events In June 2017, a suspicious package was found near the reactor that caused the evacuation of four Missouri University of Science and Technology campus buildings. The package was tested and analyzed by University Police and Fort Leonard Wood military specialists, but the package was determined as not dangerous. Research Funded by the DOE, a \\"dual-chambered internet- accessible heavily shielded facility with pneumatic access to the University of Missouri Science and Technology (Missouri S&T;) 200 kW Research Nuclear Reactor (MSTR) core has been built and is currently available for irradiation and analysis of samples. The facility allows authorized distance users engaged in collaborative activities with Missouri S&T; to remotely manipulate and analyze neutron irradiated samples.\\" In October 2012, Westinghouse Electric Corporation signed a multi-year research and collaboration agreement with Missouri S&T; to utilize MSTR and \\"support the development of multiple cutting-edge research projects at the institutions that will benefit the Westinghouse Small Modular Reactor (SMR) project and the nuclear energy industry as a whole\\". Researchers at Missouri S&T; have conducted research with MSTR to study nuclear fuel pebbles for future use in generation IV reactors. Researchers at Missouri S&T; have also developed a new mobile platform for measuring irradiated nuclear fuel pins while still submerged in a cooling pool, which is being used at MSTR for testing new types of nuclear fuel. Involved in cancer research, MSTR has also been used to experiment with ways to improve the synthesis of radioactive gold and silver nanoparticles for targeting cancer cells. Outreach Missouri S&T;'s nuclear engineering department is involved in outreach programs to rising high school juniors, seniors, and college freshmen, such as its summertime Nuclear Engineering Camp. The camp involves tours of the Missouri S&T; reactor, as well as several focused areas of study and lab experiments related to nuclear engineering.

Licensed from Royal Enfield by the indigenous Indian Madras Motors, it is now a subsidiary of Eicher Motors Limited, an Indian automaker. The company makes classic looking motorcycles Royal Enfield Bullet, Classic 350, Meteor 350, Classic 500, Interceptor 650, Continental and many more. Royal Enfield also make adventurous and offroading motorcycles like Royal Enfield Himalayan. Their motorcycles are equipped with single-cylinder and twin-cylinder engine. First produced in 1901, Royal Enfield is the oldest motorcycle brand in the world still in production, with the Bullet model enjoying the longest motorcycle production run of all time. History Bullet with plain \\"Enfield\\" tank badge Royal Enfield Bullet Electra 350, 2004 Royal Enfield Classic 350, 2010 model Logo used from 1995 to early 2014 After the Indian Independence Act 1947 the new government looked for a suitable motorcycle for its army to patrol the country's border. In 1952 the Royal Enfield Bullet was chosen as the most suitable bike for the job. In 1954, the government ordered 800 in units of the 350 cc model. In 1955, the Redditch company partnered with Madras Motors in India to form 'Enfield India' to assemble, under licence, the 350 cc Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle in Madras (now called Chennai). Alt URL The tooling was sold to Enfield India so that they could manufacture components. By 1962, all components were made in India. The Indian Enfield uses the 1960 engine (with metric bearing sizes), Royal Enfield still makes an essentially similar bike in the 350 cc and 500 cc models, along with several different models for different market segments. In 1990, Royal Enfield collaborated with the Eicher Group, an automotive company in India, and merged with it in 1994. Apart from bikes, Eicher Group is involved in the production and sales of commercial vehicles and automotive gears. Although Royal Enfield experienced difficulties in the 1990s, and ceased motorcycle production at their Jaipur factory in 2002, by 2013 the company opened a new primary factory in the Chennai suburb of Oragadam on the strength of increased demand for its motorcycles. This was followed in 2017 by the inauguration of another new factory of a similar size to the facility at Oragadam (capacity 600,000 vehicles per year) at Vallam Vagadal. The original factory at Tiruvottiyur became secondary, and continues to produce some limited-run motorcycle models. Royal Enfield announced its first takeover of another company in May, 2015 with the purchase of a UK motorcycle design and manufacturing firm, Harris Performance Products, that had previously developed the chassis of the Royal Enfield Continental GT Cafe Racer. Harris work with the UK-based part of Royal Enfield's development team, who are based at the UK Technology Centre at Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground in Leicestershire. The team was established in January 2015, and moved into their new, purpose-built facility in May 2017. By the end of 2019, the team numbered 155 and carries out the full spectrum of design and development activities, from concept generation and clay design to engineering design, prototyping and validation. Royal Enfield currently sells motorcycles in more than 50 countries. Royal Enfield surpassed Harley-Davidson in global sales in 2015. 2014 Continental GT 535 In August 2015, Royal Enfield Motors announced it is establishing its North American headquarters and a dealership in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with the intention to offer three bikes, the Bullet 500, Classic 500 and Continental GT 535 Cafe Racer as they feel this engine size represents an underserved market. The dealership will be Royal Enfield's first company-owned store in the U.S., according to Rod Copes, president of Royal Enfield North America. The company wants to establish about 100 dealerships in American cities starting with Milwaukee. \\"I live here, so I am biased. But in my mind, Milwaukee is kind of the center of motorcycling in the United States,\\" said Copes, a former Harley- Davidson executive. \\"We view this as kind of our first flagship dealership,\\" he added. Later in August 2015, parent-business Eicher announced its entry in Indonesia as a part of its global strategy in the mid-sized (250-750 cc) motorcycle segment, initially starting retail operations from a dealership in Jakarta. From April to September, 2015, Royal Enfield's domestic sales were 50% higher than the previous year, despite a declining motorcycle market in India. 2015 floods Flooding, produced by the heaviest rainfall in Chennai in over a century, caused Royal Enfield to cut production by 4,000 motorcycles in November 2015, followed by a shutdown of the plants in Thiruvottiyur and Oragadam on 1 December, as well as the company offices in Chennai. Production resumed at 50% capacity on 7 December and operations at both plants were back to normal on 14 December. Interceptor and Continental GT Royal Enfield unveiled a 650 cc twin-cylinder engine at their Technology Centre in Leicestershire, England, in November 2017 to power a new generation of Royal Enfield motorcycles. It was showcased at the Milan Motorcycle Show on 7 November 2017 in Italy, where two motorcycles based on the engine, the Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650 were revealed. Both models were introduced to the US market in November 2018 to positive reviews. The Interceptor is marketed as the INT650 in the United States where Honda has a trademark on the Interceptor name.

After a short show trial in 1948, he was executed by hanging on charges of selling weapons to Israel and supporting the Iraqi Communist Party.www.ajds.org.au  Early life and career  Ades was born to a wealthy family based in Aleppo, Syria. He migrated to Iraq and based himself in Basra. His main business activity was the establishment and management of the Ford car company agency in Iraq. He further partnered with a Muslim named Naji Al-Khedhairi in purchasing military metal scrap left in Iraq by the British army, selling the unusable parts after usable parts were sold to the government of Iraq. Involved with the Ford concession in the country, Ades accumulated business and personal ties with high-profile Iraqi notables and officials and even had accessibility to the regent, 'Abd al-Ilah. The richest Jew in Iraq, Martin Gilbert writes that Ades ‚Äúhad lunched with Government ministers and dined with the Regent.‚Äù The Ford importer was by 1948 the wealthiest Jewish individual in Iraq. He was described by historians as a ‚Äúpolitical pragmatist‚Äù with ‚Äúno time for ideologues of any stripe, least of all Zionists.‚Äù Trial and death = Trial and conviction= In July 1948, Iraq made Zionist affiliation a criminal offense. When arrested, Ades was ‚Äúaccused simultaneously of being a Zionist and a Communist. For the main charge against him, that he had sold arms to Israel, the military court presented no evidence. He was also refused the right to a proper defense. In a military tribunal, accused of sending cars to Israel, Ades was charged with donating money to the Iraqi Communist Party and with supporting the military efforts of Israel. He was sentenced to death and ordered to pay a fine of 5 million Dinars. The rest of his property was confiscated. Scholars Moshe Gat and Philip Mendes reached the conclusion that Ades was clearly innocent. They cite the following evidence: * No such complaints were ever filed against his Muslim partner or many other scrap traders. * The trial lasted only 3 days and the defendant was not allowed to plead his case. * No witnesses were ever called. * The show trial was presided over by Judge Abdullah al-Naasni, a member of the anti-Jewish, pro-Nazi Istiqlal Party. * No concrete evidence was presented that the arms were shipped from Italy to Israel. His execution was set to take place several days after he was found guilty. Although hundreds of Jewish individuals were detained that summer, Ades was the only one who received a death sentence. The only Jew in his organization, he was also the only member of his business to be punished for the crime the business was convicted of. = Execution = Following the show trial, Ades was hanged in front of his newly completed mansion in Basra on September 23, 1948. 12,000 onlookers came from all parts of Iraq to witness the hanging of the so-called \\"traitor.\\" Authorities left his dead body in the square for hours and it was abused by the celebrating crowds.URJ - Reform Judaism Magazine(hebrew) ◊î◊û◊ó◊™◊®◊™ ◊î◊ó◊ú◊ï◊¶◊ô◊™ ◊ë◊¢◊ô◊®◊ê◊ß, ◊ô◊ï◊°◊£ ◊û◊ê◊ô◊® Mona Yahya, who had family living in Iraq at the time, later wrote about the hanging that ‚Äúcrowds gathered to watch the spectacle and their cheers incited the hangman to a repeat performance. The next day, close-up shots of the hanged man covered the front pages of the Iraqi newspapers. His neck was broken, his corpse dangled over his puddle of excrement. He was labelled the Serpent, the Traitor, the Spy, the Zionist, the Jew, while his estate worth millions was appropriated by the Ministry of Defense.\\" = Aftermath = With one historian calling it the \\"greatest shock to the Jewish community [of Iraq],\\" the execution of Ades came as a profound shock to the Jewish community. As he was an assimilated and non-Zionist Jew, the affair significantly reduced support for assimilation into Iraqi society and increased support for emigration as a solution to the crisis in the Iraqi Jewish community. The Jewish community general sentiment was that if a man as well connected and powerful as Shafiq Ades could be eliminated by the state, other Jews would not be protected any longer. The Israeli National Archives has written that after Ades‚Äô September 1948 hanging under false accusations, as well as other legal repressions such as travel bans, ‚Äúthe persecutions caused many Jews to secretly cross the border to Iran and from there escape to Israel.‚Äù By October following his execution, all Jews were dismissed from their government positions in the Iraqi government, totaling around 1,500 people. The assets confiscated from the Egyptian branch of his family were valued at over 1.4 million Egyptian pounds. Most of the assets confiscated were through David Ades & Son, which operated in Cairo and Alexandria. The family's private property was also confiscated by the Iraqi government. As of 2001, a children's store with the Ades name continued to operate in Cairo, under ownership of the Iraqi government. Legacy There are streets in the Israeli cities of Ramla, Petah Tikva and Herzelia that are named after Ades.

One of seven children of the founder of the church Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana and his wife Te Urumanao Ngapaki, she was born in the family homestead, later to become part of the church settlement, and was with her parents in 1918 when her father started having the visions that would later cause him to found the church. She accompanied her father on his missions around the country and overseas, and in 1925 was married whilst in Japan to Huia Whenuaroa, another member of the Ratana concert group. She later remarried twice, having two children from her second marriage, and six from her third. In 1966, following the death of her aunt Puhi o Aotea Ratahi, Hura succeeded her as head of the church. She succeeded in building a good relationship with Te Atairangikaahu, the then Maori Queen, and raising funds to repair many of the church buildings. Hura continued to take an active role in the church right up to her death in 1991, survived by seven of her children. On Monday 15 August 1983, a handful of followers and herself sanctioned the Ratana Church of Australia. As of 2008, there has been a reported membership of 20,000 Ratana faithful residing in various parts of Australia.http://www.wikichristian.org/index.php?title=Ratana  References  * *Te Haahi Ratana; History of the Ratana Church (official website) Category:1904 births Category:1991 deaths Category:New Zealand religious leaders Category:New Zealand RƒÅtanas ","title":"Maata &quot;Te Reo&quot; Hura"},{"id":"18187299","text":"Springvale is an outer southern suburb of Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia.

Description and ecology This is a tree with buttress roots that ranges from tall. Although it is a freestanding tree when mature, F. insipida begins its growth as a climbing vine. It clings to a mature tree, eventually strangling it. Its favored hosts are Guarea tuisana and Sapium pachystachys, and it is also frequently found on already-dead trees.DeWolf, Gordon P.

Playing career =College and Amateur= Sagare is naturally a striker, but in recent seasons he has opted to play as a midfielder. As a youngster, Sagare played college soccer at the University of Washington and his home town club the Yakima Reds of the USISL. In 2001, he played for a select team in a game for the Seattle Sounders before getting his break with a move to join the Portland Timbers of the old A-League. =Professional= In 2003, Sagare was scouted by English club Grimsby Town, who at the time were playing in the First Division, the second tier of the English game. In February, he joined the Mariners from Portland on a free transfer after negotiating a short term contract with player/manager Paul Groves; Jake needed no international clearance to play in England due to his dual nationality. Sagare was signed as a striker and rarely featured in the first team with the club having such players as Michael Boulding, Steve Livingstone and Darren Mansaram contracted. On 26 April 2003, with Grimsby already relegated Sagare and other fringe players such as Graham Hockless were handed a chance, with this Sagare made his first and only senior appearance against Reading at the Madjeski Stadium. At the end of the season, Sagare was not offered a new contract and released from the club. He briefly spent a week on trial with Chesterfield before returning to the States play for the Portland Timbers in the summer. However in late September he returned to England to sign with Conference Premier side Halifax Town.Transfers in 2003/2004 Soccerbase He would go on to play in 11 games for The Shaymen before being released in May 2004.

It is essentially Draughts played on an expanded Alquerque board. It is especially similar to Draughts in that the moves of the pieces are strictly forward and sideways until they are promoted to Kings by reaching the other player's first rank. The game is also referred to as Dama.  Setup  The game consist of a standard Alquerque board but flanked on two of its opposite sides are triangular boards. Each player has 16 pieces. One player has the black pieces, and the other player has the white pieces, although any two colors or distinguishable objects are appropriate. Players decide among themselves what colored pieces to play. They also decide who will start first. Each player's 16 pieces are placed initially on the first four ranks of each player's side of the board.  Rules  * Players alternate their turns using one piece to either move or capture exclusively per turn. * Pieces may only move one space per turn either straight forward, diagonally forward, or sideways along a line onto a vacant adjacent intersection point. They cannot move backwards in any direction until they are promoted to Kings. However, pieces can make capturing moves backward. * Captures are compulsory. * Captured pieces are removed from the board. * For pieces that have not yet been promoted to King, their captures are done by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque. A piece leaps over an adjacent enemy piece onto a vacant adjacent intersection point on the other side. The leap must be in a straight line following the pattern on the board. Even pieces that are not yet promoted to King can capture enemy pieces backwards. A player's piece must continue to capture within a turn provided each capture meets the criteria of the short leap. * A piece is promoted to King when it reaches the other player's first rank. * Kings can move any number of unoccupied spaces in any available direction following the pattern of the board like the King in international draughts. * Kings can leap over an enemy piece (and only one enemy piece per leap) from any distance and land any distance behind it onto a vacant intersection point as in the King in international draughts. The King must continue to capture within the turn if it is able to do so. * The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces is the winner.

Marian is twenty-one years old, and in contrast to most Robin Hood legends, is not described as Maid Marian, but rather Lady Marian. \\"In those days [21] would be considered quite old to still be a maid,\\" actress Lucy Griffiths explained in the Radio Times preview.\\" She was engaged to Robin before he went to fight in the crusades but is visibly cold and aloof toward him on his return, although in episode twelve she admits that she considered him a hero even while calling him a fool. She was initially disapproving of Robin's outlaw status because she believed that the best way to fight injustice was to work inside the system. However, she aids him in his fight against the Sheriff by frequently spying for him and giving him inside information that she has picked up in the Sheriff's castle, and from Guy of Gisborne. Marian also fights the Sheriff in her own right, disguising herself as the Night Watchman and giving the poor food and supplies. Marian is undoubtedly beautiful and carries some status with her, as the daughter of Edward, the old Sheriff. For those reasons, Gisborne, a dispossessed lord and Vaisey's right hand man, falls in love with her quite obsessively. From the beginning, she frostily resists his attentions and gifts, unable to look past his murderous ways and cruelty. But as time goes on, her status and beauty aren't the only reasons why Guy wants her - he finds himself wondering if her pure heart and empathy could end his compulsive evil and bring about his redemption upon marriage. In the first season, she is coerced by Guy into agreeing to marry him when King Richard returns to England. Though she does not love him, she does agrees to the union to protect both herself and her father from his wrath. Marian is head-strong and no-nonsense, if often derisive of Robin's arrogance and cocky attitude towards her. But despite this, her love for him is evident as the series progresses, and they share many tender moments in secret. When King Richard appears to return to England (but is, in fact, an impostor), Marian must fulfill her promise to marry Guy, and he immediately prepares their wedding. In one final act of defiance against him, she dresses as the Night Watchman and attempts to steal from him, but he stabs her as she makes her escape, unaware that she is Marian. Djaq nurses her and manages to revive her when she goes into cardiac arrest. Soon after though, Marian apparently dies, and the penultimate episode of the first series ends with Robin mourning over her body and confessing his love for her. It is revealed in the following episode that her body merely shut down as a result of a concoction that she had been given by Guy's physician Pitts. Regaining her health shortly afterwards, Marian arrives to marry Guy. The wedding is interrupted by a frantic Much, who informs her that the King is an impostor, and that it is a ruse by the Sheriff and Guy to weed out the Sheriff's enemies. In the hope that she will forgive him, Guy admits that he knew of the plan, but Marian punches him and flees the wedding. Robin rides up on horseback to greet her and Much, and Marian rides off with him. When they arrive at the castle to expose the Sheriff's plot, she and Robin kiss. In the second series, Marian and her father are under house arrest in Nottingham Castle. Marian cannot travel out of the castle without an armed guard, although she has managed to avoid one due to Robin's men creating a diversion, or her being allowed a day off by Guy. With these methods of avoiding an armed chaperon, Marian manages to successfully deliver information to Robin. It is evident that Robin and Marian's relationship has grown stronger; however, Marian seems to be in a love triangle with Robin and Guy. Guy is still ignorant of her being Night Watchman, and Robin's informer, and harbours deep feelings for her. However, she remains faithful to Robin. Also in the second series, she is discovering several uses for her beauty and her role as a Lady - with the leading advantage being able to manipulate Guy's feelings for her. She keeps him believing that he still has a chance to win her heart - to stay close to him and get information to help Robin. When her father dies, she agrees to join Robin in Sherwood Forest, despite several heated arguments as to whether it is the right thing to do. They eventually are able to see the bigger picture - it isn't about what made them happy but about keeping Nottingham safe and looked after. In Lardner's Ring, Episode 9 of the series, Robin proposes to Marian. She accepts his hand and his ring, although by the end of the episode, she is once more back in the castle with Guy. Later on, she hides the ring from Guy, wearing it only in private. In the final episode of series 2 (We Are Robin Hood!), Marian shields King Richard as Guy advances on the injured King. She admits her relationship with Robin and how she would rather die than be with Guy, to which he responds by attacking her, thrusting his sword into her. Only after this does Robin arrive as Guy retreats with the Sheriff. Marian marries Robin while she lies dying. She then dies in her husband's arms and is carried to her grave.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ldgk8 Lady Marian returns as a ghost as Robin is dying in the last episode 'Something Worth Fighting For Part 2'.

Prelude  After the destruction of the Spanish fleet in the Battle of Cape Passaro in August 1718, the invading army of 30,000 men under the Marquis of Lede were isolated on the island of Sicily. In 1718, the Austrians still had most of their troops in the Balkans until the conclusion of the Austro-Turkish War of 1716‚Äì18 in the Treaty of Passarowitz on 21 July 1718. A first Austrian attempt to attack the Spanish from Naples had failed, when they were defeated in the Battle of Milazzo on 15 October 1718. They did succeed to hold a small bridgehead around Milazzo. By June 1719 the Austrians had moved an experienced army of 24,000 men under the Count de Mercy from the Balkans to the south of Italy, where they were sailed across the Messina Strait by the British fleet. The Spanish had abandoned the siege of Milazzo and pulled back to a more favorable position around the village of Francavilla di Sicilia, where they were covered by a river and a monastery on a hill.  The battle  On the morning of 22 June, the Austrians attacked the fortified Spanish positions in three columns. The first column attacked the fortified village of Francavilla three times, but was pushed back every time. The second column succeeded in conquering the trenches on the foot of the monastery hill, but were stopped by the second Spanish line. The Count de Mercy was wounded in this phase of the battle. The third column attacked the Spanish left flank, drove them off the San Juan hill, but were themselves pushed back under heavy Spanish fire and had to take cover in a crevice, suffering many casualties including general Holstein, who led the attack. The Spanish artillery under the Marquis of Villadarias played a crucial role during the battle, causing many casualties and confusion in the Austrian army. The battle raged until evening, when a counterattack by the Spanish cavalry removed all hopes of an Austrian victory. The Austrians withdrew, leaving 3,100 dead and wounded. The Spanish losses were 2,000 dead and wounded.  Aftermath  The Marquis de Lede didn't pursue the Austrians, giving them the opportunity to recover from this defeat. The Austrians later besieged Messina, which fell after 9 enemy attacks. The war continued until the peace was signed in the Treaty of The Hague (1720) on 17 February 1720. The Spanish troops had to evacuate Sicily, and were transported back to Spain by the British Navy. The island of Sicily became an Austrian possession.  References   Bibliography  *Chandler, David G.

It was invented by the ancient Hawaiian Polynesians. The game is played on a rectangular board. It begins with black and white counters filling the board in an alternating pattern. Players then hop over one another's pieces, capturing them similar to checkers. The first player unable to capture is the loser; their opponent is the winner. Before contact with Europeans, the game was played using small pieces of white coral and black lava on a large carved rock which doubled as both board and table. The Pu ªuhonua o H≈çnaunau National Historical Park has one of these stone gameboards on its premises. The game is somewhat similar to draughts. Pieces hop over one another when capturing; however, the similarities end there. In draughts, one player's pieces are initially set up on one side of the board opposite the other player's pieces. In K≈çnane, both players' pieces are intermixed in a checkered pattern of black and white occupying every square of the board. Furthermore, in K≈çnane all moves are capturing moves, captures are made in an orthogonal direction (not diagonally), and in a multiple-capture move the capturing piece may not change direction. K≈çnane has some resemblances to the games of Leap Frog, and Main Chuki or Tjuki.http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/konane-tr9524.pdf In both K≈çnane and Leap Frog, every square of the board is occupied by a playing piece in the beginning of the game, and the only legal moves (after the first turn) are orthogonal captures by the short leap method. However, there are significant differences in K≈çnane and Leap Frog.  Equipment  K≈çnane played with stones on a wooden board The game is played on a rectangular or square board. Pieces can be laid out in the beginning of the game in an alternating checkerboard pattern of two colors on top of a table, on the ground, or on any flat surface. Furthermore, the game can be generalized to any size geometrically. In practice, square K≈çnane boards can range from 6√ó6 to over 14√ó14. Traditional rectangular board dimensions include 9√ó13, 14√ó17, and 13√ó20.  Goal  The first player unable to capture an enemy piece is the loser, and the other player is the winner.  Rules and gameplay  The game begins with all the pieces on the board (or table, ground, etc.) arranged in an alternating pattern. Players decide which colors to play (black or white). # Black traditionally starts first and must remove one of his pieces either from the middle of the board, where there are 2 black and 2 white pieces that are diagonally opposite each other. Or remove a black piece from one of the four corners of the board (which will also consist of 2 black and 2 white pieces diagonally opposite from each other). # White then removes one of his pieces orthogonally adjacent to the empty space created by Black. There are now two orthogonally adjacent empty spaces on the board. # From here on, players take turns capturing each other's pieces. All moves must be capturing moves. A player captures an enemy piece by hopping over it with their own piece similar to draughts; however, unlike draughts, captures can be done only orthogonally and not diagonally. The player's piece hops over the orthogonally adjacent enemy piece, and lands on a vacant space immediately beyond. The player's piece can continue to hop over enemy pieces but only in the same orthogonal direction. The player can stop hopping enemy pieces at any time, but must at least capture one enemy piece in a turn. After the piece has stopped hopping, the player's turn ends. Only one piece may be used in a turn to capture enemy pieces. The player unable to make a capture is the loser; his opponent is the winner. It is impossible to draw in K≈çnane, because one player eventually cannot perform a capture. Mathematical analysis Hearn proved that K≈çnane is PSPACE-complete with respect to the dimensions of the board, by a reduction from Constraint Logic. There have been some positive results for restricted configurations. Ernst derives Combinatorial-Game-Theoretic values for several interesting positions. Chan and Tsai analyze the 1 √ó n game, but even this version of the game is not yet solved.

The issues which Landward addresses are generally those within the rural public consciousness of Scotland, itself a country with a large farming community. Additionally, the show features stories covering Scotland's vast landscape, with various stories covering the wildlife and nature of the country. From 1976 until 2007, it aired Sunday lunchtime, replacing the similar shows Farming and then later Countryfile which aired elsewhere in the UK; In 2007 Landward moved to a regular Friday evening slot, and replaced Countryfile only when it could not be shown in its usual slot (e.g. because of sports coverage).

L√°szl√≥ Borsody  Life  =Early life= He was born L√°szl√≥ Pfeffer, but took on the name Borsody when he converted from Judaism to Catholicism and joined the army to pursue a military career (Cohen 2002:399). He became a captain and taught fencing at the prestigious Wiener-Neustadt military academy. (Gaugler 1998:418). =Borsody's Innovations= In the years between the World Wars, L√°szl√≥ Borsody, returning to earlier principles of Hungarian sabre fencing, developed a system of sabre play that depended upon the articulation of the wrist and fingers, and a defensive system that consisted of the parries of third, fourth, and fifth executed with the arm strongly bent to keep the advanced target well out of the antagonist's reach, as distinguished from the sabre defensive system of Italo Santelli comprising the three parries of second, first, and fifth, executed with the arm three quarters extended (Gaugler 1998:392; 418). \\"In Borsody‚Äôs sabre technique, the cut was emphasized, and to counter this, he wanted the parries to be taken in close. Santelli, in contrast, took a greater interest in the point, and therefore stressed a defensive system that kept the parties at a distance, maintaining the point in a threatening position.‚Äù (Gaugler 1998:392; 418). The modern Hungarian saber style which led to so much success was modeled on Borsody's technique. =Toldi Miklos= Seeking to establish and maintain superiority, Hungary established the prestigious Toldi Miklos Royal Hungarian Sports Institute fencing masters training academy, under the directorship of L√°szl√≥ Borsody during the 1930s. (Cohen 2002:397). Borsody was a strict disciplarian. He was revered because he was such a fine teacher turning out a long line of champion fencers. (Cohen 2002:397). He worked with fencers who had already completed their basic training, and although he would correct his student‚Äôs technical errors he was more interested in tactics and strategy, teaching his students how to observe their students on the piste and how to exploit their weaknesses. (Cohen 2002:397). Julius Palffy-Alpar, in his book Masque and Sword, stated that Maestro Borsody's ‚Äúability to build an artistic compromise from the simplest movements, his personal philosophy, and his natural psychological approach caused him to admired by his students.‚Äù (Palffy-Alpar 1967:21-22). =Borsody's Students= Maestro Borsody taught Olympic Saber Champions Gy√∂rgy Piller, P√°l Kov√°cs, Imre Rajczy, and most of the best Hungarian fencing masters, including Csaba Elthes, Janos Kevey, Bela Bay, Ferenc Marki, Julius Palffy-Alpar, and Bela Imregi.(Cohen 2002:403). =A Tragic Ending= In 1939, Laszlo Borsody's life came to a tragic finish during World War II when he ended his life with a pistol shot rather than be subjected to the Nazi treatment accorded to Jews. He received a funeral with full military honors. (Eisen 1998: n. 39).

They were light, twin-coupled, saturated steam, tank engines. Maffei supplied the first 30 locomotives from 1880 to 1883, and Krauss delivered a further 23 up to 1894.  History  The Class D VI locomotives were procured for branch lines in flat terrain and had a maximum permitted axle load of 12 tons. The first 44 locomotives had no side tanks. Water was stored in a well tank, and coal in the driver's cab. The last nine locomotives, on the other hand, had short tanks on either side, in front of the driver's cab. That increased water capacity from 1.8 to 2.3 m2 and coal capacity from 0.5 to 0.8 t. In the 1920s, several D VI's were on duty in the Palatinate (Pfalz) as pontoon locomotives at Speyer and Maximiliansau. In 1925 the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft took over 26 vehicles as DRG Class 98.75 (Baureihe 98.75), five of which had side tanks. They were retired by the end of the 1920s and some were sold on as industrial locomotives. The final duties of former locomotive number 83, Berg (98 7508), delivered by Krauss in 1883, were in a peat factory in Raubling, where it was not taken out of service until 1964. This locomotive is the only surviving example of its class and is in the care of the German Railway History Company (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Eisenbahngeschichte e. V. or DGEG).  Technical features  The Class D VI was manufactured with a riveted plate frame that also acted as the water tank. The boiler was a riveted two-piece construction; the firebox, with its square cross-section, was arranged between the sole bars. Two injectors fed the boiler. The outside, twin-cylinder, saturated steam engine was furnished with a Stephenson valve gear; the second axle was the driving axle. For the first time on Bavarian locomotives, running plates and Hardy vacuum brakes were installed on these saturated-steam engines. Several examples had gangways as well. An unusual feature was the location of the sandbox under the running plate between the coupled axles. They had slide valves on top and outside Stephenson link motion., p. 279  See also  * Royal Bavarian State Railways * List of Bavarian locomotives and railbuses  References  * Category:0-4-0T locomotives D 06 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Germany Category:Krauss locomotives Category:Maffei locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1880 ","title":"Bavarian D VI"},{"id":"18188505","text":"The Irish League in season 1953‚Äì54 comprised 12 teams, and Linfield won the championship.
