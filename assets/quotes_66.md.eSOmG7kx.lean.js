For a period, the group exerted a promising presence in Los Angeles's music scene, releasing three singles in their recording career, the second of which was produced by Kim Fowley. Much of the band's material found on their first two releases have since been compiled on several compilation albums, including Pebbles, Volume 1, and is cited by critics as classics of the garage rock genre. History Formed in early 1965 by R&B; enthusiasts Douglas \\"Red\\" Mark and Dave Hodgkins, the first lineup of the Grains of Sand, originally known as the Rockin' Bugs, featured Mark (lead guitar), Hodgkins (rhythm guitar, harmonica), Willie Schnider (drums), and Rich Brand (bass guitar). The band almost immediately began making a name for itself on the Sunset Strip, pertaining to 21-and-up audiences a combination of cover versions of Top 40 hits and self-penned material, mainly written by Hodgkins. In mid-1965, the group began a two-week residency at the Whisky a-Go-Go and extended stays at the Red Velvet club and the Hullabaloo. Group manager Jay Coder signed the band with Valiant Records to a recording contract in early 1966. Around the same time, the Rockin' Bugs agreed to change the group moniker to the Grains of Sand, inspired by a pair of college students studying chemistry while the band members proposed possible alternatives. The Grains of Sand entered Golden Star Studios in Hollywood to record \\"That's When Your Happiness Began\\", a catchy pop tune written by the Addrisi Brothers, along with the fuzz-tinged Hodgkins-original \\"She Needs Me\\". Session musician Hal Blaine took part in the recording of \\"That's When Your Happiness Began\\", which was released, coupled by \\"She Needs Me\\" as its B-side, in February 1966. The regional commercial success that followed resulted in the band acquaint themselves with record producer Kim Fowley. In December 1966, the Grains of Sand's second single was issued on the Genesis record label. A young musician that Fowley struck up a friendship with, and also a future member of the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, named Michael Lloyd co-wrote both sides of the release, including the farfisa organ-filled \\"Going Away Baby\\". After signing to Philips Records, Schnider departed and was replaced by Kent Eaton. The band managed to record one more single \\"Nice Girl\\" in a mainstream pop style; however, the group was beginning to disband. Mark left to join the sunshine pop band the Sunshine Company in mid-1967, and was subsequently replaced by Jerry Yearwood. The final change that consequently signaled the end of the Grains of Sand was the loss of their creative-force Hodgkins in 1968. Despite attempting to amend the departure by recruiting singer- songwriter Jim Marshall, the band could not develop a chemistry and dissolved in 1969. Since their disbandment, the Grains of Sand's material has appeared on several compilation albums. \\"That's When Your Happiness Began\\" is compiled on Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 1 and What a Way to Die, while its flip side, \\"She Needs Me\\", appears on Off the Wall and Pebbles, Volume 8. \\"Going Away Baby\\" is featured on Pebbles Box, Pebbles, Volume 4 (ESD), and Essential Pebbles, Volume 1.

The film is an intimate portrait of a young Egyptian fighting for her freedom and independence in a society caught between old traditions and modernisation, against the backdrop of the Arab Spring and its aftermath. Background The revolution took away the fear. We learned we can change things if we want to.\\" This was Nada Ahmed's experience of the revolution that deposed Mubarak in 2011 and that's when she decided to make her old dream come true: work with children's theater. The country is paralyzed by political turmoil, caught between the old traditions and modernization. Nada's religious family is not happy with her being nearly thirty and unmarried. When Nada finally finds love and feels ready to marry she is confronted with the same problems her own mother had to deal with. The story Nada‚Äôs Revolution is an intimate portrait of a young Egyptian woman fighting for her freedom and independence in a society caught between old traditions and modernization. Amidst the political turmoil that has paralyzed the country for almost three years now we follow Nada‚Äôs struggle to establish herself as a professional theater maker. At the same time she is haunted by her personal story. Until the age of 23 Nada led the life her family had chosen for her: she studied to become a primary school teacher and waited to get married. But at that point she decided she did not want to live the life her mother and her grandmother had led. She left her family home for Cairo and started to build up a life of her own. She went from part-time job to part-time job, struggled with male bosses trying to take advantage of her and lived in collectives, moving from flat to flat whenever problems arose. As a young woman without the protection of a male family member, all sorts of problems are routine. When the revolution broke out in 2011, Nada ‚Äì like many of her peers ‚Äì was suddenly full of energy and hope: ‚Äòthe impossible doesn‚Äôt exist anymore‚Äô. She sets out to make her old dream come true: to work with children's theater. She writes a play about the revolution and starts to look for other people to team up with. Meanwhile, Egypt is steeped in political turbulence in the aftermath of the revolution, which the election of President Morsi in 2012 fails to resolve. What seemed possible in the beginning turns out to be much more difficult to attain than Nada imagined. Theaters shut down for lack of an audience, censorship returns to the political agenda, work is even more difficult to find and housing does not improve. Amidst the chaos Nada finds love, and believes the man of her dreams is going to accept her independence ‚Äì she wants to marry, have kids and keep working to establish herself as a theater maker. But conservative ideas about gender roles and women's freedom are hard to get rid of, even for the younger generation. Women's rights suffer a backlash in the new government-approved constitution six months after Morsi takes power. On the streets women are systematically harassed and raped during protests. The situation appears hopeless. Nada is confronted with the question of how to stay true to her own dreams and at the same time be loyal to her family and her boyfriend's conservative principles. It is an impossible equation, especially in a society where a woman's leap to adulthood is still made under the auspices of the family. But Nada's only possible answer is to keep fighting and working to make freedom come true. Director's statement I‚Äôve followed Nada during three years. In the first year the hope, the joy, the energy the revolution brought with it was contagious. The entire world believed alongside with the Egyptians that their society would change rapidly. As Nada‚Äôs life unfolded this hope would become a metaphor for the events that shook her country: the modernization demanded by her generation clashing against the country‚Äôs conservative structure. Ultimately, the young women and men had to postpone their hopes for freedom and modernizations. However, the revolution opened up a window and enabled Nada to start pursuing her dream of emancipation. Her fight is not over, nor is her energy spent, and she can set an example for all women her age.

Located on a terrace above the Penobscot River, the site dates to the Middle Archaic Period (c. 5500 BCE), a rarity in Maine, made even more unusual by the absence of later period artifacts. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 (as Maine Archaeological Survey Site), for its potential to increase what is known about Native settlement patterns in the area.Spiess, Arthur (1983). NRHP nomination for Maine Archaeological Survey Site; redacted version available by request from the National Park Service Description Indian Island, Maine is the site of the Penobscot Indian Island Reservation, with a long documented historical and prehistoric occupation by Native Americans. The island is located in the Penobscot River, between Milford and Old Town. Occupation of the island by the Penobscots has been documented since the 17th century, and the island's archaeological record of human activity goes back at least 7,500 years. Site 74-2 is one of its oldest sites, and is located on a terrace overlooking the river. It occupies the lowest of a series of terraces, where the higher ones have a geology less favorable to Native use, where test pits yielded no finds. At the time of the site's listing on the National Register in 1984, it had only been subjected to test excavations. These yielded two important artifacts, a Neville phase point dated to c. 5,500 BCE, and a stone bayonet dated to c. 1,800 BCE. Significant quantities of fire-cracked rocks (indication of cooking activity) were found in test pits throughout the site. Test pits were only dug into the plow zone, so the possibility of even older artifacts exists. Notably for archaeological sites in the interior of Maine, no ceramic artifacts of any kind were found. This strongly suggests that the site was abandoned before c. 1,000 BCE. These types of sites are extremely rare in Maine, and provide a means to investigate shifting habitation patterns over time.

On 19 November 1890 she collided with the steamer Cuxhaven from Hamburg in the Goole channel. The Cuxhaven received severe damage and was beached to prevent sinking. She grounded on sand at Goole in July 1891, but floated free on the next high tide. In March 1896 the ship fireman, William Costello, was admitted to a charge of smuggling in of compressed tobacco and of cavendish, with an estimated duty of ¬£24, 7s 6d. He was remanded for 8 days. She was badly damaged in a collision with the Goole Steam Shipping Company vessel Aire on 14 December 1896 in the River Humber. She was lengthened in 1900 with a revised tonnage of 924, and obtained in 1905 by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to be employed on the Goole ‚Äì Hamburg service.

Early life Pidgeon was born Monica Lehmann in 1913 in Catemu, Chile. Her father was a French mining engineer; her mother was Scottish. In 1929, her parents moved the family to London so their children could finish their education at English schools; she attended St Martin-in- the-Fields High School for Girls in Lambeth. After graduating, she enrolled in a two-year interior design course at The Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London (UCL). She had initially tried to study architecture but Albert Richardson, the head of the Bartlett school at the time, did not believe women belonged in architecture and her father convinced her to focus on interior design instead. Career After graduating from UCL, Pidgeon worked for a furniture company in Bedford. When the business closed, she began working as a freelance writer and illustrator. In 1941, she joined the staff of Architectural Design as the assistant to its editor, Tony Towndrow. When Towndrow moved to Australia in 1946, Pidgeon was promoted to editor. The magazine's owners, who believed a female editor would not appeal to readers and advertisers and were adverse to the idea themselves, mandated that male architects' names be included on the masthead as \\"consultants\\". Apart from a few book reviews written early in her tenure at Architectural Design, Pidgeon's own writing featured in the magazine only rarely. Under Pidgeon, Architectural Design featured well-known and little-known architects, showcased post-war reconstructive architecture, and promoted sustainable design. Pidgeon also avoided criticism: she believed that it was better not to write anything about poor designs and buildings than to publish critical reviews. Standard Catalogue Company, who owned the magazine, intended to cease production of the magazine in the late 1960s, but Pidgeon convinced them to continue publication using only the revenue earned from subscriptions instead of advertising. She left Architectural Design in 1975 to take up a position as editor of the RIBA Journal, and stayed there until Peter Murray took over in 1979. Pidgeon was an extraordinary photographer whose black and white photographs were prominently featured in the 2018 exhibition entitled Eternal City: Rome in the Photographs Collection of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Organized by the Polo Museo del Lazio, RIBA, and the British School in Rome, the exhibition was held at the Museo Vittoriano in Rome's Monument to Vittorio Emmanuele II from June to October 2018. Pidgeon's photograph of four, young stylish Italian men walking away from the colonnade and piazza of St. Peter's Church was the centerpiece of the exhibition's marketing literature. Her eye and capability for architectural photography compared to the skill of fellow photographers featured in the exhibit. Most of Pidgeon's photography that was presented occurred in 1961. Pidgeon's architectural photography bravely integrated the lives of Italian people from young children to seniors, many of them female, as cultural icons living within the greatest architecture of the Western world. Pidgeon retired in 1979. She established Pidgeon Audio Visual, a collection of materials featuring architects and designers discussing their work, to be shown at architectural schools. She continued compiling recordings for the collection until her late eighties. National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C467/39) with Monica Pigeon in 1999 for its Architects Lives' collection held by the British Library.National Life Stories, 'Pigeon, Monica (1 of 25) National Life Stories Collection: Architects' Lives', The British Library Board, 1999. Retrieved 10 April 2018 Honours Pidgeon joined the Royal Institute of British Architects as an honorary fellow in 1970 and was made an honorary fellow of the Architectural Association in 1979. For her work on the Pidgeon Audio Visual project, she was made an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1987. Family Pidgeon's sister, Olga Lehmann, was a visual artist, while her brother, Andrew George Lehmann, was a literary critic. She married Raymond Pidgeon, whom she met as a student at University College London, in 1936; they had a daughter named Annabel and son named Carl, and divorced in 1946. Her granddaughter is Rebecca Pidgeon, an actress and singer.

Design and construction The Class 735 was designed as a response of the situation developed during the years of World War I; the Italian railways needed more locomotives for freight trains, but there was no possibility of building them at home or in war-ravaged Europe. It was therefore decided to have them built overseas. Using the Class 740 design as a pattern (but allowing for alterations in order to avoid delays in the production), an order for 105 (later raised to 115) locomotives was given to Alco in 1916, and the following year they were completed, disassembled and sent by cargo ship to Italy (with only 108 reaching Italy, however, as a U-boat sank the ship carrying the remaining seven). A subsequent order for another 285 locomotives, with some minor improvements in the boiler, was given in 1918 to the Montreal Locomotive Works. Their American origin showed in their being fitted with a Bissel truck instead of the Italian bogie widespread in Italy, and with the locomotives of the first batch having fireboxes made of steel rather than copper. Operations Nicknamed \\"Wilson\\" (in honour of US president Woodrow Wilson) throughout their career, the Class 735 locomotives proved very successful; they were considered by engineers to be somewhat more powerful than the 740 Class, although their consumes were accordingly higher. Pulling mainly freight trains but often also passenger trains, they operated until the 1960s, when mass withdrawals of the Class began, until the last one was retired in 1971. Preservation Two Class 735 locomotives survived into preservation, 735.128, preserved as a static exhibit at the Pietrarsa railway museum, and 735.155, in possession of the Museo Ferroviario Piemontese, awaiting restoration. Trivia One Class 735 locomotive prominently appeared in the 1965 film Von Ryan's Express, starring Frank Sinatra.

German While the latter were trained by officers of the European colonial powers in Africa, the Ruga-Ruga were mostly hired from tribal warriors during times of conflict.Moyd, Michelle \\"Askari and Askari Myth\\" in Prem Poddar et al. Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures: Continental Europe and its Colonies, Edinburgh University Press, 2008. History The term Ruga-Ruga for armed guards in caravans and mercenary troops of Nyamwezi-chieftains dates back to at least 1820, according to Pesek. Ruga-Ruga came into knowledge first as an auxiliary force of Nyamwezi-chieftain Mirambo, dubbed the Napoleon of Africa by Henry Morton Stanley. Mirambo, a trader of ivory and slaves, gathered a militia of young men without social ties to defend his interests against the Arabs of the Swahili coast. This unit consisted mostly of former slaves or porters. Later, the word Ruga-Ruga was used to denote any unit of auxiliary troops in Eastern Africa. In course of World War I, Ruga-Ruga fought alongside the British as well as the German side in the East African Campaign. The Askari troops of the German Schutztruppe, the armed forces of German East Africa under the command of Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, were often supported by ruga-ruga units of approximately the same size. The ruga-ruga thus effectively doubled the manpower of the German colonial forces after the outbreak of war. Overall, the British War Office estimated that over 12,000 Ruga-Ruga in total served with the Germans during the war. They were most prominent at the western borders of German East Africa, due to the fact that only very few regular Schutztruppe forces were active there. Their reliability in combat varied greatly, however, as Ruga-Ruga often fought for personal reasons such as tribal rivalries and desire for fame and plunder. They were thus equally likely to fight courageously as to flee and desert. When Lettow-Vorbeck accepted the armistice on 23 November 1918 after four years of guerilla warfare and severe casualties on both sides and among civilians, the mixed force of ruga-ruga, some askaris and a few German survivors was the last unit to surrender in World War I.Moyd, Michelle Violent Intermediaries: African Soldiers, Conquest, and Everyday Colonialism Cultural heritage Iron breaks the head, a war song of the ruga-ruga, is still sung in today's Tanzania and can be sometimes heard at political gatherings.

Early life and education The Zonnetrap Center, Rotterdam (1980) Hartsuyker-Curjel was born in 1926 in Karlsruhe, Germany. Her father, Hans Curjel, the son of the architect Robert Curjel, was an art historian and pianist. Her mother, Gabriella Fahrner had also studied music and played the cello. As her parents were Jewish, the family moved to Switzerland when she was six years old. She studied architecture at the ETH Zurich where she met the Dutch Italian architecture student and future husband Enrico Hartsuyker. They were encouraged in their studies by Siegfried Giedion, a close friend of her father, Hans Curjel. Career In 1953, the couple settled in the Netherlands. From the 1960s, they received large commissions for reconstruction work in Amsterdam and Arnhem. Their atrium housing developments in Amsterdam-Buitenveldert (1965) contributed to their evolving reputation. Their social housing designs included alternative layouts with new spatial options, often with a central patio and slight differences in room levels. The kitchens and bathrooms were often centrally located. Their urban planning models, Biopolis and Hydropolis, draw considerable attention as they were aimed at integrating various functions in a building development. While these two projects were not realized, their approach can be seen in the Zonnetrap old people's centre in Rotterdam (1980) which in addition to residential accommodation provided for stores, small businesses and workshops, attracting a variety of people to the neighbourhood, not just the old people. The concept continues to be appreciated today. In the 1980s, Luzia Hartsuyker became known for her \\"women- friendly\\" homes, overcoming the traditionally hierarchical designs with rooms of more equal sizes. Examples can be seen in Amsterdam, Apeldoorn and IJsselstein. Luzia Hartsuyker-Curjel died on 17 April 2011 in Laren.

The film was released on September 4, 2015 by Relativity Digital Studios through video on demand. Synopsis Three best friends named Sydney, Liv and Chloe make the most of their last summer weekend together before going their separate ways to college. After performing her final song at the coffee shop run by Liv's mother, Sophie, Sydney receives an offer from the head of Starmageddon Records, Austin Nicholas, who thinks she has potential to be a star and wants her to check out a video shoot for one of his recording acts. Chloe and Liv encourage her to go, and they make it one of Sydney's goals on their bucket list of things to do before the weekend is over. Sydney sets another goal to hook up with someone, while Liv's goal is to apply to Juilliard, and Chloe's is to throw a wild party at her house with her parents out of town. While at Liv's house finding an outfit to wear for the video shoot, Sydney discovers a letter in Liv's bedroom indicating that she has already been accepted to Juilliard. At the shoot, Sydney meets with Austin but tells him she needs time to weigh his offer and her college plans. Chloe meets an interesting guy on the set named Broom, whom she invites to her party. Sydney's next door neighbor and boyfriend, Liam, who plans to be a traveling filmmaker, also attends the shoot but is troubled by what he sees following her meeting with Austin. As Liv is about to spring the news about Juilliard to her mother, she finds out the coffee shop could be closing due to financial difficulties and decides to throw her dream away as a dancer to help her mother. The girls' friendship is threatened by Liv's sudden change in plans, as Liv takes out her anger over her future on Sydney, who is hurt by the comments hurled at her about how well her life is going by comparison, when she is just as afraid as Liv about her future. Sydney is also disgusted over Liam's insinuation that her meeting with Austin was anything more than professional, for which Liam later apologizes. When Sophie finds the acceptance letter from Juilliard in the trash, she makes Liv realize this opportunity is way too important to pass up. Meanwhile, Sydney reflects on her late mother, particularly when she was learning music from her, and is reminded to listen to her heart in deciding what comes next. Her father also advises her to follow her heart and says her mother would have been proud of her record deal opportunity, though her parents value her education first and foremost. Sydney ultimately turns down Austin's offer, after which she runs into Liv and Chloe, who were intending to stop her from accepting the deal as well. The three make up after Liv apologizes to Sydney for what she said to her. At Chloe's party, following Broom's spectacular rooftop display, things go fine until Liv's ex-boyfriend RJ shows up and becomes disruptive. Liv takes a stand against him, pushing him out of her life for good, but when she literally pushes him inside the house, it causes damage to some valuables belonging to Chloe's parents, forcing Chloe to end the party. One item survives the damage, a doll belonging to her mother, but feeling betrayed by her parents' treatment of her throughout her life, Chloe takes her own stand and breaks the doll. Hours before the girls leave, Liam surprises Sydney in the treehouse by their homes, with many pictures he has taken of her over the years and a song expressing how much he loves her. The two share a kiss, and Liam tells Sydney he will miss her. The girls meet on the beach one more time, with Sydney giving Liv a plane ticket to New York, as she and Chloe surprise her with news that she will be starting at Juilliard this semester. Liv and Chloe will live together in New York, while Sydney heads to Boston.

History She was built by William Dobson and Company in Walker Yard for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and launched on 10 January 1910. In an inauspicious start to her career she was in a collision on 2 March 1910 in the River Elbe with the Union and Castle Line ship Avondale Castle. In 1922 the ship was transferred to the London and North Western Railway and in 1923 to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. On 3 February 1925, Joseph Rockett, aged 53, was assisting in moving the steamer in the Goole Docks. He stepped into the spiral of a wire rope, which became taut, and his right foot was torn off, above the ankle and his left leg was fractured. On 21 December 1936, the Hodder arrived in Goole from Hamburg with four elephants. The elephants were disembarked from the ship, and led to a waiting railway van. Three of the elephants were successfully loaded into the railway van, but the fourth refused. It appeared that the same elephant had had an accident at Goole docks two years previously when it stepped into a railway wagon and part of the floor gave way. Eventually it was tethered to one of the other elephants and persuaded into the van. The train left five hours late. In 1946 she was transferred to the Holyhead to Dublin route. She was broken up on 15 November 1956 by Clayton & Davie at Dunston on Tyne.

The benefit world premiere of Dirty Harry was held here on December 22, 1971. In 1972 it was renamed Market Street Cinema and was used through the early 2000s as an adult entertainment venue.

It is the first white dwarf to be observed with a transiting planetary-mass object orbiting it.  Stellar characteristics  The white dwarf has a mass of 0.6 , radius of 0.02 (1.4 ) and a temperature of 15,900 K, typical for white dwarf stars. It has been a white dwarf for 175 million years. The star included strong absorption lines due to magnesium, aluminium, silicon, calcium, iron and nickel. These elements commonly found in rocky planets are polluting the surface of the star, and would normally be expected to mix through the star and disappear from view after a million years. A circumstellar dust cloud and disk (likely due to disintegrating asteroids, located at 97 to 103 R_wd, and emitting thermal IR radiation) surrounds the star. In addition, a circumstellar gas disk (located ~ 25 to 40 R_wd, and undergoing relativistic precession with a period of ~ 5 years) surrounds the star as well. Based on recent studies and its mass, the star was likely an early F-type main sequence star (spectral type F0) before it became a red giant. The apparent magnitude of the star, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is about 17. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye.  Planetary system  The supposed planetesimal, WD 1145+017 b, with a 4.5 hour orbit, is being ripped apart by the star and is a remnant of the former planetary system that the star hosted before becoming a white dwarf. It is the first observation of a planetary object being shredded by a white dwarf. Several other large pieces have been seen in orbit as well. All the various larger pieces have orbits of 4.5 to 4.9 hours. Rocky material is raining down onto the star, and showing up in the star's spectrum. The system was detected by the Kepler space telescope in its extended K2 mission. Though the system was not a target of interest, it was within the field of view of observing sessions, and analysis of the observed data revealed the system. An excess of infrared radiation indicates that there is a dusty disk with a temperature of . Supporting observational data, along with data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, were also found related to dust debris orbiting WD 1145+017.  Similar systems  In September 2020, astronomers reported the discovery, for the first time, of a very massive Jupiter-sized planet, named WD 1856 b, closely orbiting, every 36 hours, a tiny white dwarf star, named WD 1856+534, a left-over remnant of an earlier much larger sun-like star. This WD 1856 system is similar to the WD 1145+017 system.

On the June 25, 2018 episode of Raw, Wilder pinned Roman Reigns in a tag team match. On SummerSlam pre-show, The Revival lost to The B-Team (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel) in an attempt to become the Raw Tag Team Champions. At Survivor Series, they were part of Team Raw, but lost to Team SmackDown in the 10-on-10 Survivor Series tag team elimination match. Following this they began a feud against Lucha House Party (Kalisto, Gran Metalik and Lince Dorado) and suffered various losses in handicap matches. On Raw, December 17, 2018 they defeated Lucha House Party, The B-Team and AOP in a Fatal 4-Way Match receiving a title shot for the Raw Tag Team Titles. During the next two Raw episodes they challenged Bobby Roode and Chad Gable for the titles but Dawson and Wilder were unsuccessful to win the matches in controversial fashion. Dave Meltzer of The Wrestling Observer reported that the duo asked for their release from their WWE contracts following their match against Lucha House Party on the January 14, 2019 episode of Raw. On February 11, 2019 episode of Raw, Dawson and Wilder defeated the team of Roode and Gable to win the Raw Tag Team Championships. At WrestleMania 35, The Revival lost the titles to the team of Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder. On the August 12, 2019 during a scheduled tag team match at Raw (the episode post-SummerSlam) in which The Revival were facing Lucha House Party (Lince Dorado and Gran Metalik, with Kalisto), R-Truth ran out from backstage, being chased by several wrestlers. The match was called off and The Revival performed a \\"Hart Attack\\" on Truth and simultaneously pinned him to become the first co- champions of the 24/7 Championship. However in the same night R-Truth pinned Dawson, with the help of Carmella, and regained the title. The Revival began to align themselves with Randy Orton in a feud against The New Day.

On April 10, 2020, both Wilder and his tag team partner Dawson were released from their WWE contracts. = All Elite Wrestling (2020‚Äìpresent) = After leaving WWE, Wilder (now known as Cash Wheeler) and Dawson (now known as Dax Harwood) adopted the new name of FTR and signed with All Elite Wrestling. They debuted on the May 27, 2020 episode of AEW Dynamite, entering the Daily's Place amphitheater in a pickup truck and attacking The Butcher and The Blade.  Other media  Wilder made his video game debut as a playable character in WWE 2K17, and has since appeared in WWE 2K18, WWE 2K19, and WWE 2K20.  Personal life  Wheeler stated in a May 2020 interview that all of his matches, his favorites were live event matches between The Revival and American Alpha during their NXT days. He stated that his favorite on-screen match was the match between the two teams at NXT TakeOver: Dallas, as, while he believed that the match between The Revival and DIY at NXT TakeOver: Toronto in 2016 was better, NXT TakeOver: Dallas had \\"a special magical atmosphere\\".

The term \\"continuous cover forestry\\" does not equate exactly to any one particular silvicultural system, but is typified by selection systems. For example coppice with standards and Reiniger's Target diameter harvesting are also continuous cover forestry. Different existing forest stands may require different silvicultural interventions to achieve a continuously productive irregular structure.  Overview  The term continuous cover forestry has been widely adopted in British forestry practice following the creation of the Continuous Cover Forestry Group in 1991. Currently the UK Forestry Standard and the guidelines of the silvicultural-systems UK Woodland Assurance Standard call for wider use and application of CCF in British forestry, as there is evidence that continuously productive irregular structured woodlands are more robust and resilient in response to climate change, and forest health threats in addition to a wide range of other social and environmental benefits.CCFG (2014) Continuous Cover Forestry: Delivering sustainable and resilient woodlands in Britain. Conference Report. Continuous Cover Forestry Group, National Conference, Braithwaite Institute, Cumbria. 3‚Äì4 June 2014. 21 pp. However, there remains some lack of understanding of the definition and practice of CCF among forestry professionals in Britain, and Ireland.V√≠tkov√°, L., √Å. N√≠ Dhubh√°in and V. Upton. (2014). Forestry professionals‚Äô attitudes and beliefs in relation to, and understanding of continuous cover forestry. Scottish Forestry 68(3): 17-25.  Background  CCF is an approach to forest management which respects the characteristics and processes inherent to the site, and will normally involve a mixture of tree species and ages. In French, it is referred to as sylviculture irr√©guli√®re, continue et proche de la nature (SICPN) (i.e., continuous, irregular and close to nature silviculture),Turckheim, Brice de, M. Bruchiamacchie. (2005) La futaie irr√©guli√®re: Th√©orie et pratique de la sylviculture irr√©guli√®re, continue et proche de la nature.

A review of the history, definitions and methods of continuous cover forestry with special attention to afforestation and restocking.Forestry 77(1): 37-44 or naturgem√§sse waldwirtschaft (close to nature forestry). Management is based on the selection and promotion of individual trees, of all sizes, rather than the creation of areas with trees of uniform size. Any monitoring of the development of irregular stand structures will be achieved through periodic re-measurement of stem diameters in sample plots or across whole stands.Poore, A. (2007). CCF at Stourhead - Final Report. Continuous Cover Silviculture & Mensuration in Mixed Conifers at the Stourhead (Western) Estate, Wiltshire, UK. Technical Report. SelectFor. 39 p. Deffee, R. (2014). Continual Inventory for Irregular Forest Stands. , Cranborne Woodlands. Technical Report. SelectFor. 46 p. Repeated interventions, typically at intervals of between 3 and 7 years, focus on the removal of trees which are interfering with the growth of trees with greater potential, the harvesting of crop trees at their optimum size, and the promotion of regeneration and small trees, such that an irregular stand structure is maintained in perpetuity. Regeneration will normally be by the growth of naturally-regenerated seedlings rather than by planting. Artificial regeneration (especially enrichment planting) may be needed to diversify the genetic and species composition, and to increase ecological resilience to threats from climate change, pests, or disease.  Principles  The general approach to CCF can be outlined in terms of the following underlying principles, as defined by the Continuous Cover Forestry Group (CCFG): # Adapt the forest to the site - The forest manager works with the site and respects inherent variation, rather than imposing artificial uniformity. # Adopt a holistic approach - The whole ecosystem is regarded as the production capital of the forest, including soil, carbon, water, fungi, flora, fauna, as well as the trees themselves. # Maintain forest habitats - Maintenance of the forest habitat is essential (which requires that clear- felling is avoided). # Develop the forest structure - Stand improvement is concentrated upon the development of preferred individual trees rather than the creation of a uniform block of stems. A characteristic of permanently irregular stands is that yield control is based upon measurement of stem diameter and increment rather than age and area. These principles link to a rapidly developing evidence-base, from the UK,Wilson, S. McG. (2013). Progress of adoption of alternative silvicultural systems in Britain: an independent review.

He is best known as the founder of the hip-hop label Penalty Recordings, and is currently the CEO of its successor company, Penalty Entertainment. Levine helped to launch the careers of artists such as Capone-N-Noreaga, Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz, and Tha Eastsidaz. Biography =Early years and Penalty Recordings= Levine graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston with a degree in music composition and saxophone. He began his work in the music industry as a session player, and later moved into being an independent marketing professional. Levine founded the marketing company Round the Globe Music in the late 1980s in order to promote and market hip-hop music. The organization, which offered street teaming and retail/video/radio promotions, was influential in the success of the records of artists such as A Tribe Called Quest and Mariah Carey, among others. In 1995, Levine launched Penalty Recordings, which operated as a joint venture between himself and Tommy Boy Records, founded by Tom Silverman. Tommy Boy, at the time, was fully owned by Warner Bros. Records, and Silverman reacquired half of Tommy Boy in 1996 not long after the Penalty deal. Penalty's initial releases included singles and albums by artists such as Lord Finesse and Capone-N-Noreaga. Other artists on the label during the mid-to-late 1990s included Skull Duggery, Crooked Lettaz (David Banner and Kamikaze), and Half a Mill. After Tom Silverman bought half of Tommy Boy back from Warner Bros. Records in 1996, it continued as Penalty's distributor. The label saw two of its most successful releases in with Noreaga's first two solo albums, N.O.R.E. (1998) and Melvin Flynt ‚Äì Da Hustler (1999), the former of which launched the hit single \\"Superthug\\", one of the earliest hits produced by The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo). =A&R; and executive work= Levine sold his 50% interest in Penalty to Tom Silverman and Tommy Boy in 1999, and became the Vice-President of Urban Marketing and Artist Development at the independent label TVT Records. In this capacity, Levine worked with established act Naughty by Nature, and helped develop the careers of Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz and Snoop Dogg's Dogghouse Records artists, including associates Tha Eastsidaz. He re-established Penalty in 2002 as Penalty Associated Labels, which became a joint venture with Ryko Distribution, a company for which Levine would also serve as the general manager of. Artists signed to the Penalty labels at this time included MC Eiht, The Beatnuts, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad (A Tribe Called Quest), and Penalty also struck a deal to produce and market the AND1 Mixtape series. In 2006, Levine was hired by EMI Music, where he worked as the head of Imperial Records and later the head of the urban division at EMI's Capitol Records. While at Imperial, Levine did a deal with Fat Joe, releasing Joe's seventh album Me, Myself & I on the label, including the hit single \\"Make It Rain\\" (featuring Lil Wayne). Two years later, he moved to Sony BMG, where he severed as an A&R; executive for Jive Records and the head of the newly formed BMG imprint Battery Records. Among Levine's signings to Battery were the GS Boyz, and the label nationally distributed their independent single \\"Stanky Legg\\". Battery also released Kamaal/The Abstract, the long-delayed second solo album by A Tribe Call Quest's Q-Tip, in 2009. Deciding to go back to running his own label, Levine established Penalty Entertainment in 2014, re-signing Capone-N- Noreaga to a new deal, and striking deals with established artists such as Trina, Joell Ortiz, eMC, Statik Selektah, and KXNG Crooked (aka Crooked I) and new artists such as BeatKing and Hi-Rez.

Born in Massachusetts, Ensley was a teacher on the eastern coast of the country. She moved to Colorado where she achieved prominence as a leader in the Colorado suffrage movement. She was also a journalist, activist, and a leader and founder of local women's clubs.  Early life and education  Although some sources claim that Ensley was born in 1848 in the Caribbean, census and marriage records, as well as her grave, place her birth at New Bedford, Massachusetts, on January 19, 1847. Her father, Phillip F. Piper, was born in Virginia and her mother, Jane Gibson, was born in Georgia. Her father worked on the ship Rebecca Simms. In 1868, she graduated from the West Newton English and Classical School, also known as the Allen School. From 1869 to December 1870, she traveled to England and Europe.  Marriage and children  Newell Houston Ensley (1852-1888) She married her husband Newell Houston Ensley on September 4, 1882, in Boston. Newell, born in Nashville, Tennessee on August 23, 1852, was the son of Clara and George Ensley. Born into slavery, he was owned by his maternal grandfather who hired a teacher to teach him to read and write. After the Civil War, Newell worked and attended a school near her home and became the teacher and a Sunday school teacher. He desired to become a preacher. He graduated third in his class from Roger Williams University in Nashville in June 1878, and then attended Newton Theological Seminary in Massachusetts, where he was the only black man in his graduating class (ca. 1881). He first taught Latin and theology at a school in Raleigh, North Carolina. He was a professor of rhetoric, Hebrew, and science at Howard University and Alcorn State University. Among his favored topics were \\"Toussaint L'Ouverture,\\" \\"Pluck versus Luck,\\" \\"The Rights of Women,\\" \\"Temperance\\" and \\"The Rights of the Negro.\\" They had three children: Roger (born 1883), Charlotte (born 1885), and Jean (March 1888‚ÄìJune 1888). They lived in Washington in 1880s, and then Mississippi, before moving to Denver, Colorado in 1887 or 1888. The African-American community was only about 2% of Denver's total population. Newell died in Denver, Colorado on May 23, 1888. Ensley lived at 855 S. Emerson, in a craftsman house. She also lived at 1722 Logan, Denver, Colorado in 1900, when her mother and her two surviving children (of three) lived with her.  Career  Upon returning from Europe on December 22, 1870, she established a circulating library in Boston and became a public school teacher, working in Trenton, New Jersey. From 1882 to 1883, Elizabeth was a member of the faculty of Howard University. She taught at Alcorn State University in Mississippi before moving to Denver. Ensley was the Denver correspondent for The Woman's Era, the national publication of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACWC) by 1894, when she reported on the first election in which women could vote. It was the first monthly newspaper published by and for African-American woman. Activism = Relief efforts = Due to the Silver Panic of 1893, miners who had lost their jobs were in Denver with their families. In Colorado, Elizabeth joined Denver's relief efforts for the poor and the homeless, contacting people that she knew in Washington, D.C. and Boston to help fund relief efforts. = Suffrage and politics = Women had the right to vote in school board elections, but not in other elections, in accordance with the state constitution of 1876. Inspired by her experiences with the women's suffrage groups in Boston, Elizabeth joined the campaign to put a women's suffrage amendment on the November 1893 ballot in Colorado, so that women could vote in all elections. She was the treasurer of the Colorado Non-Partisan Equal Suffrage Association, and beginning with a fund of 25 dollars, helped gain the money necessary for the campaign. Ensley worked to persuade African-American men to vote in favor of voting rights for women. The suffrage amendment was approved in November 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant voting rights to women. Alongside Ida Clark DePriest, she organized the Colorado Colored Women's Republican Club to teach African-American women to be educated voters. While she identified most with the Republican Party, she wrote that \\"there should be thorough and systematic organization of the women of all parties.\\" She established the Women's League in 1894 to inform black women how to vote, communicate the importance of voting, and communicate the nature of the issues. She was also very involved in ensuring equality for all and civil rights. = Women's clubs = She founded the Colorado Association of Colored Women's Clubs (CACW) in 1904, which created a stronger alliance by joining eight organizations throughout Colorado. The CACW led community and educational programs, including the George Washington Carver Day Nursery. Ensley served as the second Vice President of the Colorado State Federation of Colored Women's Clubs. She delivered an address to the Federation in 1906 titled \\"Women and the Ballot.\\" Ensley was the only African-American member of the predominantly white board of the Colorado Federation of Women's Clubs. Death and legacy She died on February 23, 1919 in Denver, at the home of her daughter, Charlotte Ensley Britton. She is buried in the Ensley family plot at Riverside Cemetery in Denver, Colorado. In 2020, Ensley was posthumously named an honoree of the National Women's History Alliance.

It lies north of Crediton. In 2011, the parish had a population of 216.2011 census: Neighbourhood Statistics Anciently, Poughill was held by the Poughill or Poghill family and was recorded in the Domesday book in 1086. The topynym, recorded in the Domesday Book as Pochehille, is either from the Old English pohha \\"pouch\\" and hyll \\"hill\\", meaning \\"hill by a pouch or hollow\\", or from a man named Pohha. The historical map of Poughill (in 1945) shows a number of contour lines where land reaches 600 feet above sea level. This variation in relief is shown today, particularly in the image of Poughill towards the Cheriton Fitzpaine.  Social class  83 households were recorded in Poughill in 2011 and 45 of these households were not deprived in any dimension. No houses were recorded to be deprived in either 3 or 4 dimensions however 28 households were deprived in 1 dimension and 10 households were deprived in 2 dimensions. In 2001, only 23 households had been recorded with no selected characteristic of deprivation and 5 households had selected characteristics of 3 dimension deprivation suggesting deprivation had been improved by 2011. Approximated social grades in 2001 recorded 19 residents, of 148 residents aged 16 and over in households, on state benefit, unemployed and/or lowest grade workers (in class E). 50 residents were in class 1 as people with supervisory, clerical, junior managerial/administrative/professional jobs. The highest social grade (AB) included 25 residents of Poughill who worked as higher and intermediate managerial/administrative/professional positions.  Demographics  1841 saw the beginning of a large downward trend in the total population levels. In 1901 we see a 'pause' in the total population changing - in 1911 the total population has increased by 1 to 223. The next census data collection showed Poughill's total population had fallen lower than ever at the time, recorded at 154 residents in 1931 (-69) . A minimal rise was shown again, increasing the population back up to 165 residents however this positive up rise was reduced when the 1951 census data was collected and the lowest population levels for Poughill were collected. 147 residents were recorded, as shown on the total population graph. There is a national school, with a small endowment from Pyncombe's charity; a charity of ¬£1,013 a year for schools, small livings, and the poor. Out of the whole population, 39 of Poughill's residents were of school age in 2011. Census data from 2011 shows that residents aged 45‚Äì59 years made up the highest percent of the total population, accounting for 28.2%. The smallest percentage of the total population is 0.5% (residents aged 85‚Äì89 years). 2001 data shows the highest percentage of the total population to be 24.7% however this percent was due to those aged 30‚Äì44 years, unlike 2011.Historical Map of Poughill, 1945According to the 2011 Census there were 109 males and 107 females living in the parish. As shown in the graph, Poughill's total population has varied since the 1800s. The graph shows a number of troughs and peaks with the highest peak being in 1841 when the population was recorded at 361. Total Population of Poughill Civil Parish, Devon, 1801-2011Poughill, towards Cheriton FItzpaine parish  Religion  The 2001 Census showed 137 residents stating they were Christian.

Data regarding religion varied more in the 2011 census: total population had increased but the number of Christians in Poughill had decreased to 122 residents. 74 residents did not follow a religion and still 16 residents did not state their religion. The parish church, dedicated to St Michael, is a Grade I listed building. The church is early perpendicular English; consists of a double nave and chancel, with a tower; had formerly a chantry; and was thoroughly repaired in 1856.  Housing  1841 shows the highest recorded number of 'total houses' in the Parish: 80 homes were recorded in that year's census. The 'total houses' count in 1951 is 40, this piece of data is the lowest recording of homes in Poughill and correlates with the total population being at its lowest. From the graph we can see that at the last reading, 1950, the total number of homes was rising. In 2011 total 'houses' were recorded at 83. Total Homes, Ploughill  Employment  Census data from 1831 suggests there were 7 active occupational categories in use during this time. With a small population of 325, the highest working occupational category contained only 36 residents. These residents were agricultural laborers. The second highest occupation was retail and handicrafts of which 23 residents worked in this area. No residents worked as servants or manufacturers. In 2011, census data revealed 13 active occupational categories although many of which only had one resident working within it. The highest working category noted in 2011 was in Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing with 15 residents working in this industry. This data shows, similarly to 1831, residents of Poughill don't tend to work in the manufacturing industry. 1881 occupational categories shows a large number of Poughill's population working in agriculture, suggesting land use in Poughill was mostly farmland. Data shows us that out of the 53 members of the community working in agriculture (as shown on the graph below), 52 of these workers were male. Many of the categories shown below on the graph have only a small number of workers attached to them whilst the second largest occupational category with 34 community members related to it is the 'unknown occupation' category. Similarly, there were 74 males and 71 females working in Poughill in this time period. This meant only 145 members of the Poughill community were working out of a total of 260 residents.none  References   External links  *Village website Category:Villages in Mid Devon District Category:Civil parishes in Devon ","title":"Poughill, Devon"},{"id":"48347932","text":"Arturo Alvarado P√©rez (born August 17, 1987 in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, M√©xico) is a professional Mexican footballer who currently plays for Alebrijes de Oaxaca.

It was first exhibited at the 1888 Salon de la Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants (titled Parade de cirque, cat. no. 614) in Paris, where it became one of Seurat's least admired works. Parade de cirque represents the sideshow (or parade) of the Circus Corvi at place de la Nation, and was his first depiction of a nocturnal scene,Gustave Kahn. \\"Seurat\\". L'Art moderne 11 (April 5, 1891), p. 110 and first painting of popular entertainment. Seurat worked on the theme for nearly six years before completing the final painting. Art historian Alfred H. Barr Jr. described Parade de cirque as one of Seurat's most important paintings, its 'formality' and 'symmetry' as highly innovative, and placed it as \\"the most geometric in design as well as the most mysterious in sentiment\\" of Seurat's major canvases.Alfred H.

Painted in the Divisionist style, the work employs pointillist dots of color (primarily violet-gray, blue-gray, orange, and green) and a play of lines governed by rules whose laws Seurat had studied.Rewald, John, Georges Seurat, Wittenborn and Company, New York, 1943] It depicts immobile figures outdoors under artificial lighting at the sideshow of the Circus Corvi at place de la Nation, a working-class quarter in eastern Paris.Robert L. Herbert, Georges Seurat, 1859-1891, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1991, pp. 340-345, archive.org (full text online) A row of cornet and trombone players in solemn formation are seen under the unreal evening lights of a parade. The work is dominated by a monotony of horizontal and vertical lines, suggesting the rhythms of Egyptian reliefs and frescoes.Michael F. Zimmermann. Seurat and the Art Theory of His Time. Antwerp, 1991 Though rather than indicating distance as Egyptian art (by changing scale), or classically (by foreshortening), Seurat establishes the position of his subjects through lighting. Those in the foreground are unlit, painted in dark blue, while those behind the gas jets are brilliantly lit. golden mean overlay, showing a close approximation to the divine proportion Seurat's view of this scene is so radically flattened that it is difficult to identify the composition's multiple levels. The golden section appears to govern its geometric structure,Andr√© Lhote, Encyclop√©die fran√ßaise. Vol. 16, part 1, Arts et litt√©ratures dans la soci√©t√© contemporaine. Paris, 1935, p. 16.30-7, ill. pp. 16.30-6, 16.31-7 though modern consensus among art historians is that Seurat never used this divine proportion in his work.Roger Herz-Fischler. \\"An Examination of Claims Concerning Seurat and The Golden Number\\".

Universit√© de Paris (Ph.D. diss.), 1990 The final study of Parade, executed prior to the oil on canvas, is divided horizontally into fourths and vertically into sixths. The 4 : 6 ratio corresponds to the dimensions of the canvas, which is one and one-half times wider than its vertical dimension. An additional vertical axes was drawn by Seurat, which neither corresponds to the location of the figures, nor to the architectural construction of the work; neither do these axes correspond precisely to the golden section, 1 : 1.6, as might have been expected. Rather, they correspond to basic mathematical divisions (simple ratios that appear to approximate the golden section), as noted by Seurat with citations from Charles Henry. F√™te de Neuilly, Le Cirque Corvi, c.1900 F√™te de Neuilly-sur- Seine, Le Cirque Corvi, postcard c. 1900 The entrance of the circus tent consists of ticket window and doors at the center of a platform atop six steps. On both sides of the doors (here painted green), musicians and acrobats perform a sideshow on the balustraded platform to entice passersby. Those interested in purchasing tickets from the ticket seller‚Äîthe man and woman toward the bottom right of the painting‚Äîclimb the central stairs. Ticket holders queue parallel to the sideshow stage. The diagonal line behind the trombonist is the handrail for the subsidiary stairs. A woman with a young girl is buying a ticket on the platform to the right of the ringmaster. Just as the musicians toward the left, they are immersed in the orange glow of nine gas jets (each possessing a perceptible blue-violet aura) that illuminate the platform. Five yellow-white globes of interior lamps are visible through the ticket windows. The conspicuous tree to the left bares the presence of a human figure. A boy with a ruffled collar stands performing in front of the platform at the top of the central stairs. Despite appearances, the door behind him is on a different plane from the ticket window. The rectangular structure behind the trombonist (to the right), defines the edge of the platform and shows the admission price. Above the poster is the gas pipe support beam. The trombonist stands shadowed on a pedestal (left of the central stairs) several meters in front of the platform, illuminated from the rear. While the tuba player is faceless, the red faces of the clarinetist and cornet players show that they stand on the gaslit platform. A 1990 examination of Circus Sideshow at the Metropolitan Museum of Art laboratory under light similar in color to that given off by gas lamps, revealed an \\"extraordinary transformation\\", writes art historian Robert Herbert: \\"Under the colored light the faces of the figures on the platform no longer appeared unnaturally orange but flesh color, the shadows on the trombonist and on the spectators were no longer bright ultramarine blue but black, and the entire painting glowed as if it were lit from behind, which, of course, is precisely the effect of contre-lumiere on which Seurat predicated the picture.\\" Background and reception Models (Les Poseuses), oil on canvas, 207.6 √ó 308 cm, Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia Itinerant fairs housed in temporary structures such as the Circus Corvi made seasonal appearances along the boulevards of Paris. Seurat's interest in these fairs produced several studies in anticipation of Parade de cirque, including a series of cafe-concert performances, performing saltimbanques or acrobats. The name Fernand Corvi appears on Seurat's small sketch for the ticket window. Gustave Kahn characterized Parade de cirque as \\"so willfully pallid and sad\\". The painting was overshadowed by the much larger Models (Les Poseuses) when first exhibited at the 1888 Salon des Ind√©pendants. Subsequently neglected by Seurat himself, Parade was not included among the large canvases listed in his \\"√©sthetique\\" of 1890. Robert Herbert writes of Parade: > Falling uneasily between the huge, early plein-air paintings Baignade and La > Grande Jatte and the late indoor scenes Chahut and Cirque, Parade has > neither the grandeur of the former nor the posterlike memorability of the > latter. Yet it nonetheless demands a central role in Seurat's concise > oeuvre. Not only is it his first painting of a nocturnal scene and therefore > an important stage in the development of the artist's new \\"chrono- > luminarist\\" style, it is also his first painting to depict the performance > of a popular entertainment, a genre‚Äîalready developed in drawings‚Äîthat would > dominate the artist's large projects for the remainder of his brief career. > Apart from issues of chronological priority, however, Parade also > distinguishes itself as Seurat's most mysterious painting, a brooding > masterpiece that reveals its meaning reluctantly, a disarmingly simple > geometrical schema that conceals a complex spatial arrangement... The > evocative depiction of ethereal, penumbral light is unquestionably the key > feature of Seurat's Parade. Parade de cirque, detail of the central figure With respect to the peculiar mood and appearance of Parade, art historian John Russell has proposed a literary inspiration, as opposed to a political or scientific basis; citing Arthur Rimbaud's poem a La parade, published in the Symbolist review La vogue, 13 May 1886.John Russell. Seurat. New York, 1965. It had long been believed that Charles Henry's theories on the emotional and symbolic expression of lines, shapes and colors were at the root of Parade. Though, it wasn't until the 1890 exhibition of Le Chahut (two year after the completion of Parade) that critics remarked on a connection between the work of Seurat and the theories of Henry. \\"No amount of geometry\\", write's Russell, \\"can hide the fact that this picture offers a criticism of society. But the criticism is a poet's not a politician's.\\" If this were the case, Herbert points out, \\"it is unclear what the artist's message was.\\" The subjects appear to be ordinary middle and working class spectator's and performers, without caricature of the type produced by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec or 19th century satirists such as Paul Gavarni or Honor√© Daumier. Mirroring Seurat's work, Rimbaud writes of the circus sideshow as a reflection of contemporary life: \\"their bantering or their terror lasts one minute, or whole months.\\" Robert Herbert suggested an alternative poem that more closely parallels the mood of Parade, Jules Laforgue's Soir de carnaval: \\"Oh, life is too sad, incurably sad / At festivals here and there I have always sobbed: / 'Vanity, vanity, all is only vanity!' /‚ÄîThen I think: where are the ashes of the psalmist?\\" Seurat almost certainly knew both poems, writes Herbert, \\"and either‚Äîor both‚Äîcould have inspired him.\\" Art historian Roger Fry, commenting on the unforeseen mystery of Parade, compared it to the paintings of Lautrec: > Toulouse-Lautrec would have seized at once on all that was significant of > the moral atmosphere, would have seized most of all on what satisfied his > slightly morbid relish of depravity... But Seurat, one feels, saw it almost > as one might suppose some visitant from another planet would have done. He > saw it with this penetrating exactness of a gaze vacant of all direct > understanding... Each figure seems to be so perfectly enclosed within its > simplified contour, for, however precise and detailed Seurat is, his passion > for geometricizing never deserts him‚Äîenclosed so completely, so shut off in > its partition, that no other relation than a spatial and geometrical one is > any longer possible. The syntax of actual life has been broken up and > replaced by Seurat's own peculiar syntax with all its strange, remote and > unforeseen implications. Andr√© Salmon included this painting among other works by Seurat that were misunderstood by his contemporaries and which demonstrated \\"profound intention\\".Andr√© Salmon. \\"Georges Seurat\\". Burlington Magazine 37 (September 1920), p. 121 Criticism Though Parade de cirque was eclipsed by Les Poseuses at the 1888 Salon des Ind√©pendants, several critics did mention the arduous and innovative lighting effects employed by Seurat. F√©lix F√©n√©on pointed out that it was only \\"interesting insofar as it applies to a nocturne a method pointillism, that has been mainly used for daylight effects.\\"F√©lix F√©n√©on. \\"Le n√©o-impressionnisme √† la IVe exposition des artistes ind√©pendants\\". L'Art moderne 8 (April 15, 1888), p. 122 Georges Seurat, 1891, Le Cirque (The Circus), oil on canvas, 185 x 152 cm, Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris Jules Christophe referred to Parade as a \\"curious essay in nocturnal effects.\\" Gustave Geffroy, following his commentary on Seurat's other entries at the Ind√©pendants, wrote, \\"Parade de cirque, on the contrary, has little allure, a poverty of silhouette, a pallid appearance with awkward contrasts.\\" Gustave Kahn sympathetically stated, \\"In this research, new to him, into the effects of gas [lighting], M. Seurat perhaps may not arrive at the harmonious and seductive impression of Poseuses, but the effort was difficult and the qualities of the painter rest there.\\" Kahn's commentary on the work was similar following its 1892 exhibition in Brussels: \\"Parade de cirque is conceived in a note of hazy fairground light. The sideshow performers are blurred in a kind of mist through which the gaslights attempt to burn. A clown, in the middle of the picture, is silhouetted against a noisy stand. This painting is not as decisive as Cirque... which is incidentally the most beautiful painting in the exhibition.\\"Gustave Kahn. \\"Peinture: Exposition des Ind√©pendants\\". Revue ind√©pendante de litt√©rature et d'art 7 (1888), p. 161 More recently, Meyer Schapiro wrote of Parade's \\"marvelous delicacy of tone, the uncountable variations within a narrow range, the vibrancy and soft luster, which make his canvases ... a joy to contemplate.\\"Meyer Schapiro. \\"New Light on Seurat\\". Art News 57 (April 1958), pp. 22, 45 Influence By 1904 Neo-Impressionism had evolved considerably, in a move away from nature, away from imitation, toward the distillation of essential geometric shapes and harmonious movements. These forms were considered superior to nature because they contained idea, representing the dominance of the artist over nature. Henri-Edmond Cross, Paul Signac, along with Henri Matisse, Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay, Andr√© Derain (of the younger generation) began to paint with large brushstrokes that could never blend in the eye of the observer, with pure bold colors (reds, blues, yellows, greens and magentas) \\"making them as free of the trammels of nature\\", writes Herbert, \\"as any painting then being done in Europe.\\"Robert Herbert, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968, Library of Congress Card Catalogue Number: 68-16803 The work of Paul C√©zanne had been greatly influential during the expressionistic phase of proto-Cubism (between 1908 and 1910), while the work of Seurat, with its flatter, more linear structures captured the attention of the Cubists from 1911.Alex Mittelmann, State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time, 2011 Seurat had been the founder of Neo-Impressionism, its most innovative and fervent protagonist, and proved to be one of the most influential in the eyes of the emerging avant-garde; many of whom‚Äîsuch as Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay, Gino Severini and Piet Mondrian‚Äîtransited through a Neo-Impressionist phase, prior to their Fauve, Cubist or Futurist endeavors.Alfred H. Barr Jr., Cubism and Abstract Art. Exh. cat., Museum of Modern Art. New York, 1936, pp. 22, 223 : \\"With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910‚Äì1911,\\" writes Herbert, \\"questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. As a result of several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists. Pierre Courthion mentions Parade as \\"perhaps the sole work of 19th-century painting that unequivocally anticipates Cubism (and even Purism)\\".Pierre Courthion. Georges Seurat. 1st ed.

She is often worshipped with Mazu and 108 Xiongdi Gong. Her cult was spread along with Hainanese diaspora in the end of Qing dynasty. Her birthday is celebrated on 15th day of the 10th month of the lunar calendar. Legend =Her First temple= Legend has it that a fisherman named Pan lived in Wenchang county, Hainan Island. One day while fishing out at sea, he caught a block of wood which he threw back into the sea, but he caught it again the next day. This happened repeatedly for a few days. As a result, Pan decided to bring the block of wood back to his home. He felt that the block of wood had a magical power and thus prayed to it, asking to be blessed with a great catch the next day. He promised that he would build a temple to enshrine the wood if his prayer were to be granted. Pan's prayer was actually granted. He came back from his fishing trip with a huge catch. However, Pan did not have enough money to build a temple, so he left the wood outside his house by the pig sty and forgot all about the promise he made. The next day, his pigs went ill and his neighbors saw a woman sitting on the branch of the longan tree near his house. It made him remember his promise to the block of wood. He informed his neighbours of the incident and they all raised funds for the construction of the temple and prayed to ask where they should build the new temple. Suddenly a child came by and showed them the location of where the temple should be built. That temple would then be the first temple for Goddess Shui Wei. =Title from palace= A Hainanese scholar named Zhang emerged third in the imperial examination during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor during the Qing Dynasty. One day, the emperor visited Hainan Island and became very ill. The imperial court sent a messenger to summon Zhang but he was already warned by the goddess in a dream that the emperor would soon pass on. A week later after returning to Beijing, the Emperor died. This miraculous event led the new Emperor, Xianfeng, to bestow the goddess the title of n√°n tiƒÅn sh«éndi√†n g«ény√¨ng hu«í lƒõi shu«ê wƒõi sh√®ng ni√°ng (ÂçóÂ§©Èó™ÁîµÊÑüÂ∫îÁÅ´Èõ∑Ê∞¥Â∞æÂú£Â®ò). Cult The worship of the Goddess Shui Wei is unique to the Hainanese community. She is widely worshipped by Hainanese immigrants who migrated to other countries by sea, as she is believed to be the protector of sea travelers. Her worship is popular in Southeast Asia, where her believers and temples can be found in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. =Thailand= Almost every Hainanese household on the northern part of Thailand have an altar dedicated to the Goddess Shui Wei. In Thailand, she is known as Caw Mae Thab Thim, but the Hainanese community of the Wang Thong market prefer addressing the goddess as Caw Mae Thong Kham. Caw Mae Thong Kham has a more local sense than Caw Mae Thab Thim and even the non-Hainanese communities of Wang Thong market feel a sense of belonging to the goddess. cult. =Indonesia= The cult of the Goddess Shui Wei is spread along the Hainanese communities in Indonesia. The oldest Chinese temple in Bali, Caow Eng Bio Chinese Buddhist Temple at Benoa Cape, enshrines her as the main deity of the temple along with the 108 Xiongdi Gong. Another temple that worships her as the tutelary deity is Cao Fuk Miao at Denpasar.

Curiosity drives everything in his life and work.http://artistsandalgorists.com/ubi-de-feo/ In 2007 de Feo began teaching programming, electronics and other things to whoever wants to learn, often developing his own methods to explain really complicated things in a more tangible, down-to-earth fashion. He does do not try to teach things he doesn‚Äôt thoroughly understand, which often leads him to learn entirely new subjects in order to explain them to himself and others. Education \\"I have learned most of what I know by interacting with people far from my location. Internet has been my campus and will be till the end of one of us two, be it mine or the internet's,\\" Ubi de Feo. From 1993-1995 de Feo was enrolled at the University in Salerno (IT) where he studied Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Bored with that track he dropped out and switched his focus to Social Studies. In 1995 he was drafted into the Navy. Shortly thereafter de Feo was in a serious Vespa accident and spent six months in bed recovering and thinking.http://artistsandalgorists.com/ubi-de-feo/ Professional life In 2000 de Feo became a professional creative coder. He began experimenting with mobile devices in 2001. In 2002 he moved to Amsterdam where he worked as a Creative Technologist for Wieden+Kenney [W+K interaction design lab startup], set up the collective Hello, Savants! [a fellowship of creative people with unique disabilities and unexpected talents], and went to work for himself as twodotone. In this range of capacities de Feo produced both personal and commercial projects that span disciplines from teaching and coding to sound and animation while developing projects for Nike, Nokia [Nokia Flagship Stores Bluetooth Framework], Gore-Tex, Heineken, Bottega Veneta, Mandarina Duck, Electronic Arts, Reebok, MTV networks, Nationaal Historisch Museum Amsterdam, Belastingdienst and many more. Currently de Feo is the Director of Secret Space Program at MediaMonks and is a 2015 visiting faculty at Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design (CIID).http://ciid.dk/education/visiting- faculty/faculty-2015/ubi-de-feo/ Teaching Ubi de Feo's project ‚Äúfrom 0 to C‚Äù http://www.creativeapplications.net/theory/from-0-to-c-teaching- programming-using-a-tangible-approach/ is a series of workshops ‚Äì and a framework of objects, methods, stories and games http://breakoutmentors.com/learning-computer-programming-in-the-physical- world/ ‚Äì that aim at teaching programming using a more creative, human approach. Through the use of tangible, hand-made objects, ‚Äúfrom 0 to C‚Äù attempts to establish a clear understanding of how a computer works and what a programming language actually is.http://www.studio28.tv/workshop-from-0-to-c/ During years of teaching‚Äîor trying to teach‚ÄîArduino coding to creatives, de Feo ran into the following scenarios: ‚ÄúFor the beginner, the artist, the industrial designer who wants to start prototyping, [the difficulties of learning to code] can appear as walls they constantly have to crash against,‚Äù de Feo observed. ‚ÄúIf you ask them why, most of the times the answer will be something along the lines of I‚Äôm a creative person, this structured stuff is not for me.\\"http://www.athenna.com/ubi-de-feo-figures-out-how-to-teach-coding- to-code-challenged-designers/athenna/web_design/teoria-de-design/ His Arduino courses at Mediamatic with Massimo Banzihttp://www.digicult.it/news/arduino- basic-bluetooth-workshops/ revealed \\"a really steep entry curve\\" barrier and further motivated de Feo to develop a new approach.http://summn.com/2009/11/arduino-workshop-at-mediamatic/ \\"People got really really excited about the electronic part of it and the entry of the code was really complex. I have studied so many languages that I have learnt a lot of tricks and things that could be useful in learning a new programming language. I wanted to teach people Arduino but I wanted to teach them really really well.\\" http://artistsandalgorists.com/ubi-de-feo/ Realizing that the conventional approach to teaching coding was not working for the [creative] type of student, de Feo created ‚ÄúFrom 0 to C,‚Äù starting with a rather radical step: Removing all of the computers from the classroom. Instead, he introduced physical objects the students are meant to interact with.http://www.core77.com/posts/24625/ubi-de-feo-figures-out-how-to-teach- coding-to-code-challenged-designers-24625‚ÄúFrom 0 to C‚Äù allows people to visualize what happens inside the computer when a program runs ‚Äì how bytes are moved around and manipulated by the program.http://breakoutmentors.com/learning-computer-programming-in-the- physical-world/ Regarding the ‚ÄúFrom 0 to C‚Äùoutcomes, de Feo explains, \\"The scope of this primer is not teaching you to be the best coder or hacker, but to be one who knows what you are dealing with and has a better attitude towards problem solving.\\"https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/13/tangible-coding- workshops \\"After learning the ins and outs of how stupid computers actually are, [Ubi]‚Äôs students then learn the syntax of a language of their choice (C, JavaScript, or Python, for example), and write a few programs.\\"http://hackaday.com/2012/07/19/from-0-to-c-teaching-programming- without-a-computer/http://www.core77.com/posts/24625/ubi-de-feo-figures-out- how-to-teach-coding-to-code-challenged- designers-24625http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/17879/1/how- to-code-like-a-pro Ubi de Feo has taught the Introduction to Electronics class at CIID (Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design) in both 2015 and 2016 during their Interaction Design Programme.

Her main focus was sea stars however she also conducted research into brittle stars and sea urchins. Work Irene Bernasconi - Voyage to Antarctica 1968 - route Over the course of her career, Bernasconi described a number of new genus and species. Her first taxonomic publication, in which new species from the genus Pteraster were described, was published in 1935. In 1941 she described two new species from the genus Luidia. Between 1937 and 1980, Bernasconi revised the taxonomy of a number of families: Pterasteridae, Luidiidae, Odontasteridae, Gonisasteridae, Ganeriidae, Asterinidae and Echinasteridae. In 1965 she described the new genus of Vemaster along with four new species. Bernasconi was one of the first female Argentinean scientists to conduct research in Antarctica after travelling there in 1968, at the age of 72.

The band performed solely as a live act for over a year, locally in Connecticut and New York as well as in a tour to Austin, Texas during South by Southwest music festival in 2012. =To Be Frank (2012-2013)= In late 2012, the band ran a Kickstarter campaign to record their earliest material. Following the success of that campaign, The Nice Ones released their first album, To Be Frank, in 2013. The album was recorded by producer Paul Orofino at Millbrook Sound Studios in Millbrook, New York. The Nice Ones toured heavily in New York City, specifically Manhattan and Brooklyn, before another studio effort. =Hungry Ghosts EP (2014-2015)= In 2014, the band recorded five songs at Stone Studio in Lakeville, Connecticut with producer Graham Stone. The sessions resulted in Hungry Ghosts EP, released in 2015. The supporting Hungry Ghosts EP tour brought The Nice Ones to northeastern cities Boston, Massachusetts and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the first time, as well as regional universities. The EP's song \\"Big Sexi\\" was released as a single in October 2015, followed by the band's first official music video, directed by Al Harney. Musicianship The Nice Ones are categorized as rock and progressive rock. All four members contribute vocally in performances and structurally in the songwriting process, though all lyrics are written by primary-vocalist Patrick Surdam.

Despite disliking conflict, has a strong sense of justice. When he was 15 years old, he saw his childhood friend Nanao's stepfather abusing her and killed the man with his bare hands to protect her. After being released from juvenile prison, he underwent the bugs procedure to follow after her. :He was 22 years old when he was sent to the second expedition and after seeing almost all his companions killed by the Terraformars including Nanao, he swore to one day return and enact his revenge. He indeed returns 20 years later as the Japanese leader of Annex I's squad 1. Komachi's powers are based on the Asian giant hornet, giving him enhanced strength and the ability to inflict lethal doses of poison with his stings. He is mortally wounded by Joseph during their fight, but he manages to kill him thanks to an overdose of the transformation drug keeping his body together. ; : :The other survivor of the BUGS 2 expedition when he was 18, Hiruma swore to never return to Mars after what happened. Being the eldest of eleven siblings, he tried to betray the rest of the BUGS 2 crew along with one of his comrades, Victoria Wood, in order to gain more money by bringing a roach egg, but the egg hatched faster than expected and killed Victoria. He was saved by Shokichi and they fiercely fought the rest of the roaches. He eventually becomes the Prime Minister of Japan and works to enforce his country's position among the countries leading the Annex I mission. Hiruma's powers are based on the sleeping chironomid that just like its larva, bestows him with a seemingly invulnerable carapace along enhanced strength. ; : :Shokichi's childhood friend and love interest who, after her stepfather was killed by Shokichi, joined the BUGS 2 crew. All she wanted was a peaceful life with Shokichi after returning to Earth, but tragically she was the first victim of the Terraformars when one of the roaches snapped her neck, dying in Shokichi's arms. Her powers were based on the silk moth, but died before being able to show them, until one of the Terraformars managed to copy her powers twenty years later. ; : :The Captain of the BUGS 2 mission and Michelle's father. His powers were based on the Paraponera clavata, an ant so ferocious that even Army Ants will steer clear of its path, and is believed to be the world's strongest insect. He was capable of splitting in two the previously untouchable roaches with the pure strength of his arms or crush their heads with one hand. His power allowed him to fight off a horde of roaches singlehanded, giving time for his crew to escape. He was murdered by Victoria Wood. His daughter Michelle inherited his ant powers. Twenty years later, Michelle faces a roach that stole his powers. ; : :Coming from Thailand, his powers were based on the desert locust and acquired an extreme leg strength that could decapitate a Terraformar with one kick. He sacrifices himself to allow Shokichi and Ichiro to use the BUGS 2 emergency escape pod to save themselves, after he overdosed on the drug and his body was more locust than human. He dies while being hugged by Komachi, calling him a friend. Twenty years later a cockroach is able to copy his powers. ; : :The lieutenant of the BUGS 2 crew, her powers were based on a mantis, that gave her 2 mantis-like arms capable of cutting the roaches. She was killed by one of the evolved cockroaches. She was Liu Yiwu's childhood friend and was sent to as a spy to steal the technology on the BUGS surgery in America, only to be captured and underwent the BUGs surgery as part of her release negotiations by the Chinese government. ; : :Coming from Israel, his powers were based on the bombardier beetle, and he was able to mix hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone just like the bug itself. Combining these two substances, he could then release a spray of extremely hot benzoquinone from his palms, creating a huge explosion, not unlike a flame-thrower. He was the first person to die battling the cockroaches. Twenty years later a roach was able to copy his powers and uses them to kill Sheila. ; : :Coming from Russia, her powers were based on the rainbow stag beetle. She was cut in half by one of the roaches swift kick, despite the natural strength of the beetle's shell. Her powers are then used by one of the cockroaches, twenty years later. ; : :Coming from South Africa, her powers were based on the emerald cockroach wasp, and she was capable of enslaving cockroaches by stinging them in the brain and even hiding within their bodies. She tried to betray the rest of the crew alongside Ichiro by bringing a roach egg, but later she revealed her plan on taking over the world using her powers. Unexpectedly the egg hatched and the newly evolved roaches were immune to her poison. She died during the crash landing. Annex I ; : :A Japanese member of the Annex I expedition, he is the son of Nanao Akita who performed the Bug Procedure, earning him some latent powers as well. After undergoing the procedure himself, Akari earned the powers of the Japanese bagworm moth allowing him to generate thin but incredibly strong and elastic strings that even the Terraformars are unable to see or break. In combat he combines his strings with martial arts, proving himself deadly even for the special terraformars. His personal battle weapon is a katana that can easily cut the Terraformars, much like George Smiles' sword, used in tandem with his adoptive family's sword arts. It is revealed that his innate powers come from the mantis, which grew a sharp mantis-like arm, and made his thread become sharp and filled with thorns. He and Michelle have a mutual attraction to one another, although their relationship has thus far remained one of subordinate and superior. ; : :The American leader of the Annex I expedition, Michelle is the daughter of Donatello K. Davis, one of the victims of the BUGS 2 expedition and granddaughter of M. K. Davis, the executive responsible for the BUGS 1 mission. Like Akari, she is the child of a subject of the Bug Procedure, which gives Michelle the same powers her father had, that of the Paraponera. It gives her formidable strength and durability allowing her to sustain hits from the roaches and crush them easily. After receiving her M.O. Operation Michelle gained the powers of the blast ant, that give her the ability of exploding her enemies after a couple seconds like a bomb. While facing the Terraformar with her father's powers, she uses her personal battle weapons: six jet propellants (one for each elbow, one for each foot, and two in her back) that makes her incredibly fast and greatly enhances the impact of her blows. She and Akari have a mutual attraction to one another, although their relationship has thus far remained one of superior and subordinate. ; : :A Mexican boy who joins the Annex I crew alongside his childhood friends Alex and Sheila in order to escape the poverty of his country and gain an American citizenship. His M.O. Operation powers come from the huntsman spider giving him great strength, ferocity and incredible speed that can bypass the roaches, leaving them no time to counterattack. Despite his immeasurable speed, his endurance is a bit low, forcing him to recharge after some time fighting, leaving him vulnerable to attack. In combat Marcos also uses a staff that he calls the \\"Arachnebuster Mk.II\\" that he uses to deflect ranged attacks and impale the roaches. ; : :A Mexican boy who joins the Annex I crew alongside his childhood friends Marcos and Sheila in order to gain an American citizenship and become a professional baseball player. His M.O. Operation powers come from the harpy eagle, that allows him to fly and makes his eyesight eight times stronger than humans and his upper-body muscles incredibly strong. Thanks to his great gripping strength Alex is able to throw things so fast that their impact on the target is like a bullet, and thanks to his great eyesight he can throw things from impossible distances so that the enemy don't even see them coming. ; : :A Mexican girl that along with her two childhood friends Marcos and Alex escaped from her country and joined the Annex I to have the American citizenship. She seems to have a crush on Shokichi. She is killed when, while trying to capture a roach, the insect unexpectedly uses the powers of one of the fallen BUGS 2 crew to shoot a hole through her chest. She dies while trying to confess her feelings for Shokichi, to which he apparently understood her. ; : :A member of the Annex I crew that joined the mission in order to pay the debts of the treatment of his retinal detachment. A former lightweight boxing champion, his M.O. Operation powers come from the peacock mantis shrimp, making him incredibly strong and durable, capable of regenerate any lost limbs after a few minutes with little effort. In addition to their powerful blows, the mantis shrimp also possesses one of the most advanced eyes in the animal kingdom, enabling him to see clearly in pitch-darkness. ; : :A member of the Annex I crew who joined the mission in order to pay and sever her connections with her disgraced family. Her M.O. Operation powers come from the white- throated needletail, which grants her lightweight skin of amylose and strong chest muscles enough to lift her body into the air. While flying, she is so fast that the terraformar cannot match her movements. She uses a special body kit weapon with blades that allows her to swiftly kill several terraformars. ; : :A Japanese girl that joined the Annex Project because of her financial debts. Her M.O. Operation powers come from the striped skunk and is capable of producing a smell so strong even the Terraformars will stay away from her (for some time), but she lacks any offensive capabilities. When used in tandem with Akari, however, the chemicals that produce the smell can cause lethal damage to her opponents. ; : :An American man that joined the Annex Project to pay his economical debts. His M.O. Operation powers come from the killer whale, which makes him able to use echolocation by sending out ultrasonic waves and through the reflection of these waves, he is able to accurately locate and identify enemies even if they are underground or not visible. He was shot in the throat by the Archer Fish Terraformar and then he sacrificed himself to protect the unconscious members of his team from the Echidna Terraformars. ; : :The leader of the Russian squad. He chose to join the Annex Project to save his daughter from the deadly A.E. Virus that afflicts Earth. A very perceptive person, he's able to deduce others' base form powers simply by analyzing. He also has his own theories about the origin of the Terraformars' intelligence and adaptability, calling it \\"The memory left by Rahab\\". His M.O. Operation powers are those of the Tasmanian giant crab, that grants him incredible strength and durability, being able of taking heavy hits from the roaches without even being damaged and crush them easily. Moreover he is able to eventually regenerate any lost limbs after few minutes with little effort. He's also a samba and judo practitioner. He stays behind with Liu and Shoukichi while the other survivors escape. ; : :A member of the Russian squad that joined the Annex crew alongside his sister Elena. Unlike the other members of the Russian team, Ivan is always cheerful and positive. After his sister is killed, he tries to act more serious towards his team, with varying results. His M.O. Operation powers come, surprisingly, from the plant Datura stramonium, and makes him able to cause fever, hallucinations, breathing dysfunction and even heart failure to his opponent when hit. He usually applies the wrong dosage of the poison, which ends killing the terraformars outright. In combat Ivan also uses grenades that release his own poison as a gas, poisoning all the targets who inhale the gas. ; : :A member of the Russian team that joins the Annex project alongside her brother Ivan. Unlike her brother, she is always calm, serious and self-confident. While trying to capture a roach using a special net, the bug unexpectedly uses the super speed powers of one of the fallen members of the BUGS 2 crew to decapitate her. ; : :A member of the Russian squad and Sylvester's son in-law, who joined the Annex Project in order to find the cure of the A.E. Virus and save his wife and unborn child. While laid-back, he's extremely loyal to his cause and his comrades. His M.O. Operation powers originate from the Sumatra stag beetle which, while unremarkable, allows him to burn his innards to create smoke and to easily cut the Terraformars. Despite being wounded, he launches a one-man assault against the Chinese Squad inside the Annex in order to kill Hong. He hesitates in killing the girl and is attacked by Jet, Xi and Dorjiberke. He overdoses on the drug and dies when Hong begs him not to kill Xi. ; : :A member of the Russian team who joined the Annex Project alongside her husband, Aaron. Despite the love for her husband, Nina seems to have a mutual attraction towards Ivan Perepelkin. Her M.O. Operation powers come from the Deathstalker scorpion, which makes her able to grow two scorpion like tails, the first from her ponytail and the second from the tailbone, and produce a very dangerous poison. Aside from her M.O. powers, she's a regular practitioner of Sambo, a Russian self-defense martial art, and uses it efficiently in combination with her powers. She's killed by an Evolved Terraformar. ; : :A member of the Russian team who joined the Annex Project alongside his wife Nina. His M.O. Operation powers originate from the Chinese red-headed centipede, that makes his skin (with the exception of his joints) both resilient and hard. He dies while protecting his wife from the Demon Dragonfly Terraformar, and his corpse is taken by the Terraformars. ; : :A member of the Russian squad. His M.O. Operation powers come from the Japanese mountain mole, which means he's capable of digging tunnels very fast thanks to his great claws and strong arms. He's killed by Terraformars during the final battle to reach the evacuation ship. ; : :A member of the Russian squad and an acquaintance of Nina Yujik. Her M.O. Operation powers come from the trapdoor spider, which means that alongside Sergei are the main tunnel diggers. She and Ivan are the only surviving members of the Russian squad that manage to return to Earth. ; : :The leader of the Chinese squad. He betrays the rest of the Annex crew alongside his team under orders from his home country to kidnap Akari and Michelle, and allow his country to study them and find a way to recreate their natural born abilities in order to make China the earth's governing superpower. He and his team not only lied about their purpose, but even their backgrounds and base forms were false. His M.O. Operation powers come from the blue-ringed octopus, which makes him incredibly strong and durable, being able to recover from heavy hits thanks to some type of body regeneration, generate tentacles, and restrain strong opponents. He is also capable of generating a very strong poison from his tentacles and he's also very skilled in kempo. When his countrymen try to kill him and Joseph, he survives and sides with Komachi. He ultimately stays behind on Mars with Sylvester to help Shoukichi kill Joseph. He sacrifices his life by ripping out his own heart and using it to replace Shoukichi's destroyed heart in order to save his life. ; : :A member of the Chinese team. Coming from Thailand, his M.O. Operation powers originate from the tiger pistol shrimp, which allows him to send \\"shock waves\\" at his enemies. He also possess a special suit with a full-body personal omnidirectional sonar, called \\"Yellow Prawn-Goby\\", that allows him to locate enemies in every direction even if he can't see them. He's also quite skilled in different south-Asian martial arts. He's defeated by Akari but allowed to live and he eventually reunites with the surviving members of his squad. ; : :A member of the Chinese squad very skilled in swordsmanship and hand-to-hand combat. It is later revealed that his M.O. Operation powers come from the sea squirt, which means he was cloned many times, and his amoral personality meant neither he or his clones went insane, and each has a different, albeit very similar personality. One of the clones was killed by Joseph, three more were killed by Marcos, the ones that remained dormant inside the Annex were killed by infiltrated Terraformars, while the remaining ones remain with Liu Yiwu. The true original turned out to be with General Kai aboard the Kuzuryu warship. The original Bao is killed once and for all by Sylvester, who punches his head off. ; : :A member of the Chinese squad. Her M.O. Operation powers come from the Pfeffer's flamboyant cuttlefish, making her able regrow missing limbs and to rapidly alter her skin color at will, making her practically invisible. She is also an expert martial artist. Despite trying to kill Keiji, after he protects Hong, they both agree to work together in order to kill the Ratel Terraformar, before both fall unconscious. She's eventually reunited with both Jet and Dorjiberke and board the Kuzuryu back to earth. ; : :The youngest member of the Chinese Squad. Simple minded and emotive, her M.O. Operation powers come, incredibly, from a lethal bacteria. This makes her a living biological weapon capable of killing every terraformar and human within a certain radius if they do not have a protection suit. She looks up to Xi as an older sister. She and Chun-Li are captured by the other Squads and eventually she's allowed to return to earth alongside the other Chinese members. ; : :A member of the Chinese squad from Mongolia with a keen sense of smell, who was almost forced to join the Annex Project. His M.O. Operation powers originate from the gray wolf and his skills are considered in par with the Insect Types. He's defeated (and possibly killed) by the combined efforts of Akari, Yaeko and Eva. Later it is shown he survived alongside Jet and eventually reunites with Hong and Xi. ; : :The leader of the German squad. He has belonged to the U-NASA from a very young age, since he lost both his parents in a failed Bugs procedure and although he went to school, he was under a strict duty of confidentiality, in addition to the surveillance and health inspection. One day he met a girl and fell in love with her, marrying her and also having a son. After becoming an officer he trained his recruits, becoming a father-figure to them. He eventually found out his wife was having an affair and that his son is most likely not related to him by blood. His M.O. Operation powers come from the electric eel, making his body stronger and more durable, and allowing him to generate incredibly powerful electric shocks from his muscles. Adolf also carries throwing knives that he uses to transmit his electric shocks, allowing them to kill a large group of roaches with a single attack. ; : :A member of the German squad that befriends Akari, Michelle, Sheila, Marcos and Alex. A good hearted and naive girl, but also clumsy and very emotional, prone to collapsing when panicked, but capable of great courage in dire situations. Her family was very overprotective, controlling and hypochondriac, and after they lost their fortune, they sold her to the U-NASA that forced her to undergo the M.O. Operation. Her powers come from the planarian, and allowed her to fully regenerate from the explosion that killed Adolf and the rest of her squad. By absorbing Adolf's cells she now has his electric powers. ; : :A Brazilian girl and member of the German Squad that acts as a big sister for Eva Frost and the other comrades in her squad. Her M.O. Operation powers belong to the Sia ferox, this grants her ferociousness and makes her legs incredibly strong, being able to move and jump very high easily. She's killed by one of the special Terraformars. ; : :The leader of the Roma squad. Laid back and a flirt, he's considered the strongest person in the Annex I crew, being powerful enough to take on enough Terraformars and make a mountain-sized pile out of their bodies. He's the culmination of 600 years of selective breeding in humans, with a superior intellect and superhuman strength. His operation base's origin is never revealed, but it gives him the ability to regrow limbs and generate electricity. His weapon is the same sword used by George Smiles, a member of the BUGS 1 crew, 43 years before. He appears just in time to save Yaeko and Alex from a horde of terraformars, and defeats one of Bao's clones when the latter tries to use Michelle as a decoy. He proposes marriage to Michelle (much to her disbelief) before moving to face Liu Yiwu and the remaining clones. After killing one clone and incapacitating another, he and Liu move to fight one on one. He and Liu are nearly killed by the Chinese, but somehow survive and arrive to help Komachi. He eventually betrays the ANNEX 1 crew, revealing his purpose for being on the mission was to find a suitable mate, which Michelle had proven herself to be, but her and Akari's attraction to one another drove him over the edge, forcing him to remember the first time he had been rejected by a girl he loved, which was an act his ego couldn't allow. He faces Sh≈çkichi in a one-on-one fight and ultimately loses when Sh≈çkichi exploits Joseph's inability to comprehend love or emotional connections and is killed when Sh≈çkichi uses the severed limb of the Praying Mantis roach to split him in half, decapitate him, and slice his head in two. :It is later revealed that he remained alive since he had taken Eva's planarian powers previously and his slowly regenerating body is returned to earth by members of his family, convinced that he has surpassed humanity. It is then revealed that they plan to use him as a figurehead once they take over the world. However, the defeat and the memory of Michelle's rejection have driven him insane. ; : :A member of the American squad who aspires to become and engineer, hence the reason why he joined the Annex Project. His M.O. Operation powers come from the hammerhead shark, which gives him the ampullae of Lorenzini, allowing him to detect even the most minimal electric impulses. ; : :A member of the American squad. Her M.O. Operation powers come from the echidna, being able to dig in the ground with her claws and to grow needles from her body to pierce her enemies. She was killed by the Demon Dragonfly Terraformar. Her powers were then stolen by the cockroaches. ; : :A member of the American squad. Her M.O. Operation powers come from the Schlegel's Japanese gecko, which gives her toepads that allows her to adhere to most surfaces without the use of liquids or surface tension. ; : :A member of the American Squad, whose M.O. Operation powers come from the narwhal, growing a horn in her forehead and also allows her to hold her breath for an incredibly long time. She has fallen in love with Keiji. During the infiltration of the Annex, she manages to remain conscious enough to send a message back to Earth, but is only capable of calling for help, incapable of informing about China's betrayal. ; :Twin brothers members of the American Squad. Their M.O. Operation powers come from the Ogre-faced spider, which allows them to shoot strings from his fingers. However they can shoot those threads only once, which is why they're ranked low. Ryuji is burned alive during the final run towards the evacuation ship, while Ryuichi manages to evacuate. Others ; : :The senior supervisor of U-NASA's BUGS 2 project. He is the one who came up with the idea of the Bugs Procedure as he knew that regular humans didn't stand a chance after his grandson, George Smiles (a member of the BUGS 1 crew) sent a cockroach head to Earth before dying. He observed the BUGS 2 mission from the internal cameras, and understood that the cockroaches learned to use their firearms. He later commented that the roaches have evolved so much on Mars and the humans didn't foresee it. Also that through BUGS 2 Mission, it became clear that the moss that their ancestors planted had been switched. ; : :Ichiro's younger brother. He is the major of the Japan Air and Self Defence Force, and deputy commander of the U-NASA's Annex Project. ; : :A professor from Tokyo Institute of Technology that supervised the BUGS 2 mission. He bribed Victoria and Ichiro in order to obtain a cockroach egg and turn it into a military power. After Victoria was killed and he tried to call her, Alexander answered instead; he had found out his plan and told him to just sit and watch as the crew battled the roaches. Twenty years later he went into hiding, until he was found and questioned by Shichisei, who told him all the advances that had taken place since the Bug Procedure. Then he and his research are used as leverage to guarantee Japan will keep the loyalty of the other countries involved with the Annex project, while keeping China in check. ; : :The President of the USA in 2620 and an ally of Ichiro Hiruma. ; : :The President of the Roma Federation in 2620. He chooses to remain loyal to Japan after Ichiro Hiruma casually mentions that he found professor Kou Honda. He claims that while Ichiro isn't a bright politician, he recognizes that Hiruma was smart enough to wait until his enemies showed themselves. ; : :The Chancellor of Germany in 2620. She chooses to remain loyal to Japan after Ichiro Hiruma casually mentions that he found professor Kou Honda. ; : :An orphan and Akari's childhood friend. She was one of the many infected by the A.E. Virus and needed a transplant in order to live longer, but died 2 days before Akari met Shokichi and Michelle. ; : :A ten-year-old boy infected with the A.E. Virus that Akari befriends during his training at the U-NASA. Akari promises him to find a cure for his illness on the day he embarks to Mars, despite Michelle telling him not to give him much hope. He's currently hospitalized at the U-NASA. ; : :Sylvester's daughter and Alexander's wife, who became infected with the A.E. Virus during her pregnancy. While at first rejected Alexander's advances, his perseverance made her fall in love with him. She's currently hospitalized in the U-NASA. ; : :Adolf's wife, whom he met during his college days. She cheated on her husband a year before he embarked to Mars, having a child with another man. Despite that, Adolf still cared about her, as he was afraid of losing the only person that made him feel \\"human\\". ; : :A scientist working for the German branch of the U-NASA. Her husband, Thomas Bellwood, was a crew member of the BUGS 1 mission. She's the one who told Adolf that his son wasn't his. ; : :Ichiro and Shichisei's brother, who was sent to the German Branch of the U-NASA to discuss Akari's powers. ; :A Chinese general and captain of the Kuzuryu Warship sent by his country to capture Akari and Michelle. His M.O. Operation powers come from the Cordyceps fungus, which allows him to manipulate insect brains and make them a 'puppet' by shooting spores from the palm of his hands. Terraformars The main antagonists, who hold an innate hatred for all humans, are 2m tall Martian cockroaches with humanoid bodies similar to Homo erectus, evolved by a mysterious civilization, the Rahab, who also created humanity. Their internal anatomy is nearly identical to that of regular cockroaches, and can remain mobile even when decapitated as long as the Suboesophageal ganglion remains intact and there is an open passage to the lungs. They don't feel pain and retain the abilities of normal cockroaches, such as incredible speed, strength and resistance on a human scale, allowing them to easily defeat a normal human. There are different types of Terraformars, having adapted quickly during the BUGS 2 mission; furthermore, the Annex I mission discovered some had incorporated dead BUGS 2 crewmember capabilities, somehow copying the Bugs Procedure. Their insect ancestry is revealed by small antenna, a pair of cerci above their posterior, and the elytra covering the wings. They are animalistic, adaptable, bent on survival, and individually intelligent to different degrees. While Terraformars don't initially appear to have social structure, the Evolved Terraformars display leadership, rallying their brothers into a capable fighting force and leading their race from their headquarters in the Martian pyramid, built by the Rahab. A love of fighting humans has caused the Evolved Terraformars to develop hot-blooded personalities who can't resist a one-on-one fight. A Terraformar leader eventually appears in the form of a roach with the appearance of a Buddhist priest who has somehow learned Kalaripayattu, but is ultimately killed by Alex in a last-ditch attack after he is badly wounded by it. A second priest-like Terraformar known as Invoker then takes its place, but this one has mannerisms more in line with a scientist than a warrior, preferring to kidnap and study humans rather than kill them. Their intelligence is so high, they were able to rebuild the BUGS 1's old ship and fly it back to Earth, infiltrating homes in several countries; and, began learning human social knowledge through computers, cellphones and books taken from the humans killed on Earth; and, have stolen cars and clothing. They have a written motto: \\"WE ARE THE COSMOS\\". Under their new leadership, the Terraformars have revealed themselves to the public and now engage in open skirmishes with Annex 1's crew while they attempt to kidnap humans to experiment on. They eventually take up residence on a manmade Chinese island and, following a raid by the Annex 1 crew, reveal that the experiments that they are performing are all in service of Invoker's goal of restoring the Rahab civilization.

It recreates the east London setting in which the unsolved Jack the Ripper murders took place in 1888, and exhibits some original artefacts from the period as well as waxwork recreations of crime scenes and sets. The museum was founded by Mark Palmer-Edgecumbe, a former head of diversity for Google. The museum's planning application described it to the council as a \\"Museum of Women's History\\". Its change of focus to a Jack the Ripper museum was only revealed when the museum opened a year later, leading to numerous protests. Exhibits The museum's exhibits includes the whistle used by police constable Edward Watkins to summon help when he discovered the body of Catherine Eddowes, and the truncheon and notebook case he was carrying. The five-room exhibition includes a recreation of the police station in Leman Street where detectives attempted to identify the murderer, of the bedroom of victim Mary Jane Kelly, and the scene of Catherine Eddowes' murder, with an effigy of PC Edward Watkins standing over her. A mocked-up morgue in the basement includes shrines to the \\"canonical five\\" victims - Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly - as well as Emma Elizabeth Smith, Alice McKenzie and Frances Coles. Museum history The change-of-use planning application from Palmer-Edgecumbe's architects in August 2014 described plans to convert the disused Victorian building into the \\"Museum of Women's History\\", which it described as the first women's museum in the United Kingdom. The application featured illustrations of suffragettes and equal pay campaigners, and made reference to the closure of Whitechapel's Women's Library in 2013, saying that this museum would be \\"the only dedicated resource in the East End to women‚Äôs history\\". The application stated: \\"The museum will recognise and celebrate the women of the East End who have shaped history, telling the story of how they have been instrumental in changing society. It will analyse the social, political and domestic experience from the Victorian period to the present day.\\" When covers were removed from the site in 2015, local residents were shocked to instead see a \\"Jack the Ripper Museum\\", dedicated to the unsolved murders of local women. They had not been informed of the museum's change of focus. Protests were repeatedly staged outside, with anti-gentrification organisation Class War threatening further protests after a Hallowe'en event at which visitors were invited to pose for photographs with actors playing the killer and his mutilated victims. Andrew Waugh, the museum's architect, described the venture as \\"salacious, misogynist rubbish\\" and described himself as having been \\"duped\\" into offering a low fee to work on a museum celebrating women in politics in the East End. Waugh said would not have touched the project \\"with a bargepole\\" if he had known how it would ultimately be marketed. John Biggs, the mayor of Tower Hamlets, said that the council's planning officers had been \\"misled by the applicant\\". In 2016 the museum's owners were refused retrospective planning permission for its shop front and ordered to change the museum's signage and to remove the roller shutter installed without planning permission in 2015 after protestors smashed a window. The Planning Inspectorate considered the shop's frontage to be detrimental to Cable Street, a conservation area. By 2017 the museum had lost an appeal to the Secretary of State and failed to comply with the change of signage and removal of the shutter. In 2018 the museum redesigned its frontage. The museum defended its position, Palmer-Edgecumbe saying that \\"We did plan to do a museum about social history of women but as the project developed we decided a more interesting angle was from the perspective of the victims of Jack the Ripper.\\" He said the Ripper theme would serve as a \\"primary platform\\" from which the stories of other East End women would be told. Palmer-Edgecumbe had been involved in an exhibition about the serial killer at the Museum of London Docklands in 2008, and was co-director of a \\"Jack the Ripper Museum (London) Limited\\" company in 2012. He said he had \\"clearly stated\\" during planning discussions that the Museum of Women's History would be based \\"to a large extent\\" on this Jack the Ripper exhibition, and that the planning document included a number of images from it.

Carlson also explores the role of the museum in the representation and interpretation of cultural objects.

The episode was broadcast on BBC One, PBS and Channel One on 1 January 2016. It depicts the characters of the show in an alternative timeline: the Victorian London setting of the original stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. The title is based on the quote \\"Ricoletti of the club foot and his abominable wife\\" from \\"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual\\" (1893), which refers to a case mentioned by Holmes. The story also draws on elements of original Conan Doyle stories of Holmes such as \\"The Five Orange Pips\\" (1891) and \\"The Final Problem\\" (1893). The episode won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie, the first win of the series in that category. Plot The plot revolves around Victorian England and the present day, with incongruities accepted in good faith. In the 19th century, Dr. John Watson has been medically discharged from the Army and moves to London. Watson is introduced to Sherlock Holmes by a fellow student of Bart's, and becomes interested in his investigative principles. Holmes invites Watson to share his new flat in Baker Street, which Watson accepts. In 1895, Inspector Lestrade arrives and presents Holmes and Watson with a puzzling case: Emelia Ricoletti, a consumptive bride, had fired on by-passers in the street from a balcony before fatally shooting herself. Later that evening, Mr. Ricoletti was confronted by Emelia, who shot him dead before disappearing into the fog. Fascinated by Emelia's apparent survival, Holmes takes the case. At the morgue, Dr. Hooper informs Holmes that the woman who killed herself, the woman who murdered Mr. Ricoletti and the body on hand have all been positively identified as Emelia Ricoletti. Confused, Holmes loses interest in the case. When the bride apparently returns to murder other men, he deduces that these are copycat crimes. Months later, Holmes' brother Mycroft refers to him a case: Lady Carmichael's husband, Sir Eustace Carmichael, received a threatening warning in the form of an envelope full of orange pips. Sir Eustace is uncooperative, describing his wife as \\"hysterical\\"; Holmes and Watson stake out the house for the evening. A ghostly-looking bride appears and disappears in front of them, and the pair hear the sound of breaking glass, followed by screams from both Sir Eustace and Lady Carmichael. They discover Sir Eustace, stabbed to death, by what appears to be Emelia, who then escapes through a broken window. Lestrade arrives and observes a note attached to the dagger, which Holmes says wasn't there when he found the body. The note reads, \\"Miss me?\\", a phrase used by the modern-day James Moriarty. After insisting that the case's solution is so simple that even Lestrade could solve it, Holmes meditates. Moriarty appears and insults Holmes about the mystery of Emelia's seeming-suicide-revival, alluding to his similar apparent-death in the present. Moriarty appears to shoot himself in the head but remains alive. In the present day, it is revealed that the events of Victorian England are actually occurring within Sherlock's drug-laden Mind Palace. The plane has returned to England minutes after taking off after Moriarty's broadcast, and Mycroft, John, and Mary enter the plane to find a frustrated Sherlock rambling about the unsolved Ricoletti case. Sherlock explains he had hoped to solve the case, believing it would prove crucial to solving Moriarty's return. Victorian Holmes awakens, with an awareness of events of the present as a seeming hallucination induced by cocaine. Holmes receives a telegram from Mrs Watson saying she has found Emelia's co-conspirators at a desanctified church. There, Holmes and Watson discover and interrupt a secret group of the Women's Rights Movement (similar to the Suffragette movement in the late 19th century), whose members include Dr. Hooper, Janine Hawkins, and Watson's maidservant. Holmes explains that they used a double to fake Emelia's death, allowing her to kill her husband and create the persona of the avenging ghost bride. Already dying, she was later killed at her request by being shot through the mouth; the duplicate corpse was replaced by her actual corpse, the one Holmes and Watson saw at the morgue, for a positive identification. Since then, the women have used the persona of the bride to murder men who wronged them. Sherlock surmises that Lady Carmichael, being a member of the society, killed her husband. He makes his accusation to the approaching bride, assuming that it is Lady Carmichael. When he lifts the bride's veil, however, he finds that the \\"bride\\" is actually Moriarty. Sherlock reawakens in the present, where he insists on finding Emelia's grave to prove that her body-double was buried under the coffin. While digging, he hears Emelia's corpse repeatedly whisper \\"Do not forget me\\". The corpse moves to attack him, then Holmes awakens in the past on a ledge next to the Reichenbach Falls. Moriarty appears and tells Holmes he is still trapped in his Mind Palace ‚Äì Holmes realises that the incident at the grave was just another episode in the same dream. The men fight and Moriarty gains the upper hand, but Watson appears and holds Moriarty at gunpoint. Watson kicks Moriarty off the ledge and then asks Holmes how he can waken into the present. Holmes decides to fall over the ledge, having confidence he will survive. Sherlock wakes up in the present on the plane. Mycroft asks John to look after Sherlock, hoping he will not use drugs again. After John leaves the plane, Mycroft opens Sherlock's notebook, revealing the word \\"Redbeard\\". Sherlock concludes that, like Ricoletti, Moriarty did indeed die but arranged with others to carry out plans after his death. The episode ends with Victorian Holmes describing his visions of aeroplanes and mobile telephones to a cynical Watson, before looking out the window onto Baker Street in the present day.  Filming Panoramic view of the entrance area of Tyntesfield Filming took place at Tyntesfield House, a National Trust property at Wraxall, near Bristol. Scenes were also shot in the cellars of Colston Hall and at Arnos Vale Cemetery in Bristol, and other locations in Bath, Somerset. Tyntesfield was mainly used as Sir Eustace's house but also the Watsons' London home. The final scene of the episode puts forth a possible concept that all of the series in its modern-day setting are actually playing out from within Victorian Holmes' Mind Palace. Mark Gatiss stated in Sherlock: The Abominable Bride Post-Mortem: > By having that scene right at the end, where we go back to Victorian London > ‚Äì Victorian Baker Street ‚Äì and Sherlock explicitly says, \\"It's an imagined > version of what I think the future might be,\\" we have really opened a > ridiculous window that the entire series of Sherlock might be the drug- > induced ravings of the Victorian Sherlock Holmes. Which means we can do > absolutely anything.

Her specialisation as a bunjin, a painter of Chinese-style art using monochrome ink, was the bamboo plant which she perfected and which inspired her nom de plume. Her kanshi poetry is known for being self-reflective and having autobiographical quality. She was one of the most well-known and most praised Japanese artists of her age.  Early life  Ema Saik≈ç was born in 1787 in Ogaki, Mino province. She was the first daughter born into the wealthy Ema family. Not much is known about her mother or siblings. Her father was Ema Ransai, a scholar of rangaku (‚ÄòDutch studies‚Äô), a discipline entailing knowledge of chemistry and anatomy brought in by the Dutch, only Western foreigners allowed contact to Japan. He soon recognised his daughter's talent in painting and began to support her education. Ema Saik≈ç began to paint at an early age: her bamboo paintings date back to 1792, when she was five years old. The bamboo theme would remain her speciality throughout her career; it was considered one of the 'four gentlemen‚Äô ‚Äì the plum, the orchid, the chrysanthemum and the bamboo ‚Äì which were common subjects represented in art following Chinese fashion. At the age of 13, her father arranged for her to be mentored by Gyokurin, a monk-painter from the temple Eikan-do in Kyoto skilled in bunjinga. Due to the physical distance between student and tutor, she was taught through correspondence as was customary during the time. Thus, she received models from Gyokurin to copy and sent back her results which the monk would inspect to send her his annotations and criticism. Ema maintained correspondence until his death when she was 27, expressing her mourning in a poem. Ema began to compose kanshi, verses in classical Chinese, in her teenage years - much later than she began to paint, but as a direct consequence of it. Chinese-style paintings often included kanshi which served as an addition and elaboration of the painting itself. It was assessed at the times that fluency in Chinese could be achieved by a dedicated and talented student but would take years of practice; and even then, composers would remain insecure about the quality of their verses, especially when leaving a homogenous Japanese environment and presenting their work to native Chinese speakers. Ema Ransai endorsed his daughter's education and aided her in her Chinese studies, enabling Ema Saik≈ç to soon advance in the art and becoming a renowned kanshi poet.  Adulthood and Career  From childhood onwards, there is evidence that Ema Saik≈ç valued her studies and practice of her art highly. When her father selected a husband for his daughter, she refused marriage on the ground that she needed to focus on her paintings and verses. It shows the high respect and affection for his daughter that Ema Ransai adhered to this decision and married Saik≈ç's suitor to her younger sister. The couple would become heads of the Ema household in which Ema Saik≈ç lived her entire life. In her twenties, Ema became increasingly well connected as appreciation for her art increased and intellectuals all over Japan began to recognise her talent. Her tutor Gyokurin had displayed her work, noting that it received more attention than that of his other pupils; the scholar Oyamada Tomokiyo cited a poem of hers in a publication in 1814. = Ema Saik≈ç and Rai San‚Äôy≈ç = The same year, at the age of 27, she met Rai San‚Äôy≈ç, a rising scholar who was also accomplished in Chinese-style writing and calligraphy and an amateur in painting. Their relationship is seen as defining for both artists throughout their lives. Rai San‚Äôy≈ç met Ema when visiting her father, to whom ‚Äì a distinguished physician and scholar of Dutch medicine with a background of studies in Chinese culture ‚Äì Rai San‚Äôy≈ç paid a customary visit to increase his own reputation and connectedness. Rai San‚Äôy≈ç was instantly captivated by Ema, detailing his infatuation in a letter to a friend in Kyoto, Konishi Genzui. In the letter, he describes his attraction to her, her previous abandonment of marriage ideas, insinuates that she should marry him and attests that she share similar feelings. Ema and Rai San‚Äôy≈ç met two more times that year. Through enquiry by her father, Ema became Rai San‚Äôy≈ç's kanshi and calligraphy student to improve her verses. The exact nature of her feelings towards Rai San‚Äôy≈ç remain unclear, as well as the circumstances of a potential union between the two. Some scholars believe that Rai San‚Äôy≈ç did not ask her father for her hand in marriage, assessing himself ‚Äì disowned by his father and with a struggling reputation ‚Äì to be of no status to become marry into the prestigious Ema family. Other scholars assess that in her absence, Rai San‚Äôy≈ç did ask Ema Ransai for Ema Saik≈ç's hand in marriage. Following this version, Ema Ransai, adhering to Saik≈ç's previous rejection of marriage in favour of her art, rejected Rai San‚Äôy≈ç without the knowledge that the feeling might have been mutual. In any event, Rai San‚Äôy≈ç married Rie, his seventeen-year-old maid, soon after. Ema Saik≈ç remained his student until he died, mainly through correspondence. For teaching calligraphy, Rai San‚Äôy≈ç would send her poems that he or other writer composed for her to copy them and send back the result for his inspection. Similarly, she sent him her composed Kanshi which he then would assess and return with his comments. The intimacy of their correspondence and the poems they wrote about each other has prompted speculation about a relationship which was more than platonic; while these primary sources do show closeness and positive feelings, there is no concrete evidence to support these claims and their exchange has not been judged as scandalous by their contemporaries. Rai San‚Äôy≈ç further acted as an agent for her poetry, distributing it to friends and colleagues and suggesting publishing her work. He also indicated that she distance her painting technique from the teachings of her late tutor Gyokurin. Ema refused a publication during her lifetime but continued intellectual exchange and travelling to further her art. In 1819, she was introduced to Uragami Shunkin who was proficient in Southern Sung style and agreed to tutor her through correspondence: her paintings began to mature and become more sophisticated, experimenting with different shades of ink which gave her paintings a more spacious look. = Later Life and Maturity = Two sides of Ema's life begin to emerge from her late thirties onwards. Living with her well-off family, she had little diversion from her art and practice. Her poems, a wide collection of which is known from the age of 27 until the year of her death often discuss solitude, monotonous daily life and quiet surroundings: > All day, as in any other year, the water clock moves slow. A fine rain have > napped fully quiet in my living room. By the afternoon window I have napped > fully quiet in my living room. I am now ready to copy poems of the four > female poets. In addition to an often repetitive daily life, however, Ema was active in literary and intellectual circles as well as travelling often. She was a co- founder of the kanshi-writing groups Haku≈ç Sha (late 1810s), Reiki Gin Sha (1846), and K≈çsai Sha (1848). The groups would meet regularly, discuss kanshi and writing techniques as well as socialise with food and drinks. Ema was elected president for Reiki Gin Sha and K≈çsai Sha and rose to prominence and admiration by her fellow poets. Additionally, she often travelled especially in later years, meeting Rai San‚Äôy≈ç and other intellectuals. These travels often coincided to celebrate events such as the cherry blossoms, which Ema describes in several of her poems: > > White blossoms glow on all the cherry trees. Remember leaving town, chasing > the spring wind? Fifteen years ago we were drunk here, just as now; the > river murmurs, just as it did then. In 1828, her step-mother to whom she had maintained a close relationship died, and in 1832, Rai San‚Äôy≈ç died from tuberculosis. Throughout her life, Ema remained close to her father Ema Ransai, who had continued to support her and her education. She wrote several kanshi in his honour. He died in 1839. After the death of the three people closest to her, Ema's work became more sombre and reflective. Some of her work show her as lonely in her old age, once mentioning ‚Äòone mistake‚Äô in her life which some scholars believe to allege to her relationship with Rai San‚Äôy≈ç. Further, she discusses how most work written by female poets displays the themes of ‚Äúloneliness, isolation, and longing for their heartless lovers‚Äù. On the other hand, she does diverge from these norms of non-married female poets. Her poems describe her not serving any mother-in- law or father-in-law due to not being married, and divorces herself from the traditional women's three obediences to a father, husband and eldest son. Others state that she did not regret dying childless as long as her art continues to exist. While she did discourage other women to take up art and poetry, her mature poems which she composed in her forties and later show that she perceives age as giving her a kind of freedom, and distinguishes her life from typical womanhood through her education, occupation, single status and age which allows her to disregard traditionally feminine qualities. She also took pride in the work of other female artists of the era: one of her scrolls listed paintings and calligraphy from 22 different women which Ema owned. = Last Years and Death = Ema Saik≈ç had grown up in the late Edo period during which Japan was mostly sealed off its surroundings, with little intellectual or artistic exchange between the country and its neighbours. The Japanese were, however, well informed about Western advance into Asia, the Opium Wars in which China was reduced to a semi-colonial status and the West's imperial ambitions. In 1853, U.S. Navy Commodore Matthew Perry sailed to Yokohama in an attempt to open the country to serve U.S. interests. In the following year, he succeeded, resulting in the first trade relations, cultural exchange and foreigners living on Japanese soil in almost three centuries. Ema Saik≈ç and her intellectual associates discussed these developments with interest and . The intellectual elite with which she was associated had formed a close to uniform opinion, viewing the U.S. aggressors as nanban, foreign barbarians without manners or culture who presented an active threat to Japanese lifestyle, culture and political status. Ema's associates as a free-thinking, modern intellectual circle feared Japan to suffer a fate similar to China's, which had experienced a humiliating defeat, decrease in power of its ruler and subjection to foreign commands. In 1856, she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage which severely affected her health. She produced paintings for the Toda clan and was invited to ≈ågaki Castle to be recognized for her work, but suffered a stroke in 1861 and died later that year.  Paiting style: bunjin Ema Saik≈ç  Ema Saik≈ç's style of painting evolved throughout her life, influenced by going through different life stages and being taught by different mentors. Her main influence and object is the bamboo plant, which makes up almost all of her painted work. Her adopted first name, Saik≈ç, is an allegory to the plant. Often, her bamboo paintings would incorporate other elements such as sparrows, rocks, or similar characteristics of nature. Temporary assessment states that her paintwork improved after she became a student of Uragami Shunkin in 1819: her style was composed of crisp and controlled brushwork. Bunjinga paintings were usually created in monochrome black ink; Ema began to experiment with this technique, creating bamboo plants with different intensity of ink. This way, she was able to show overlapping leaves while retaining a clear structure and distinction of the separate plants: her paintings created the illusion of space, receding planes and some plants closer to the viewer than others.  Poetry: kanshi composer Ema Saik≈ç  While Ema Saik≈ç was an accomplished painter and began to paint from an early age, modern scholarship pays closer attention to her poetry work. Kanshi are among the shortest poetic forms worldwide: the version used by Japanese poets in the late Edo period contained 20 syllables, distributed into four lines with five characters each ‚Äì however, strict adherence to rule was not given and some longer kanshi poems exist. Also, in comparison to other Japanese forms of poetry such as the haiku, kanshi are known to diverge in their subject matter. Usually, the four lines of a kanshi are structured to include the beginning, amplification, transition, and conclusion, which Ema Saik≈ç's poetry adheres to, such as in here poem ‚ÄòAutumn Night, Impromptu‚Äù: > Though I ought to love the moonlight I fear the harsh cold of the night air. > I call a maid, have all the windows shut: Flowers in the vase suddenly > fragrant. Ema left more than 1,500 poems upon her death, some of which were written on her art work. As the subject matter was flexible, her poems discuss many and diverging aspects of her life. Some of them reference daily occurrences, a large amount describes observations of nature after the Chinese model. Later, her poetry becomes self-reflective, discussing her age, single status and freedom. Also, many of her poems are dedicated to her relationships and mention her father and her family, Rai San‚Äôy≈ç or her first tutor Gyokurin. This is the reason why her collected work is often referenced as somewhat autobiographical. Her description and reflection of her lifestyle, ageing and the people with whom she was associated reveal her personal thoughts; at times, however, they remain unspecific and reserved.  Legacy  Ema was a well-established poet and painter by the time of her death, having been featured in her contemporaries‚Äô publications and leaving behind many works of art. Due to the volume of kanshi art produced in the Edo period and previously as well as the shift of Japanese intellectuals from learning Western languages rather than Classical Chinese, many poets are lost from today's records. Also, female poets tend to have been preserved or appreciated less accurately than their male counterparts. Still, Ema Saik≈ç has been referenced continuously, many details of her life are known and many of her works preserved by her family. The perception of Ema Saik≈ç changed over time: while she was an accomplished artist and poet during her lifetime, modern critics of the 20th century have focused intensively on her relationship to Rai San‚Äôy≈ç. Especially critics that consider Rai San‚Äôy≈ç's work and life primarily portray Ema as his mistress rather than his associate, student and a poet in her own right. Thus, part of modern scholarship have emphasised her marital status, life style and relationships rather than her paintings and the content of her art. Nevertheless, Ema was ranked as a top female poet by the Chinese poet and scholar Y√º Y√ºeh (1821-1906) who included her poets in an anthology, and she was considered among the ‚Äúthree greatest women poets in Japan‚Äù by Tu Fu scholar Kurokawa Y≈çichi. More recently, scholar Kado Reiko published two volumes of Ema's poems including annotations and commentaries called Ema Saik≈ç Shish≈´: ‚ÄùSh≈çmu Ik≈ç‚Äù. Another 150 of her poems were translated into English and published in the 1998 book ‚ÄúBreeze Through Bamboo: Kanshi of Ema Saik≈ç‚Äù by Hiroaki Sato.

Four people were killed in the crash, and 46 others were reported injured. Event The incident occurred at 10:31 a.m. Central Time (15:31 UTC), during Oklahoma State University's annual Sea of Orange Homecoming Parade, which was being held that morning, leading up to that day's football game between the Oklahoma State Cowboys and the Kansas Jayhawks. After the parade had crossed the intersection of Hall of Fame Avenue and Main Streets ( east of Boone Pickens Stadium) on the university campus, where the parade was supposed to conclude, 25-year-old Adacia Avery Chambers ‚Äì a native of Oologah and resident of Stillwater ‚Äì drove her gray 2014 Hyundai Elantra south on Main at speeds above into several barriers used to block off commuter traffic and then proceeded to hit an unmanned motorcycle belonging to the Stillwater Police Department, which was providing security assistance for the event; Chambers' car then careened into approximately 50 parade spectators before stopping when its two front tires popped the curb on the southwest corner of the intersection. Local paramedics and firefighters participating in the parade immediately began tending to those who were injured. Three of the victims who were hit by Chambers' vehicle in the collision ‚Äì 23-year-old Nikita Prabhaker Nakal, a native of Mumbai, India who was an attending senior at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond; and husband and wife Marvin Lyle and Bonnie Jean Stone, both age 65 and residing in Stillwater ‚Äì died at the scene; 2-year-old Nash Lucas, also of Stillwater, suffered severe injuries and died while being treated at The Children's Hospital at OU Medicine in Oklahoma City hours after the crash (his mother was among those injured in the crash). 47 other people ‚Äì including nine children between the ages of 1 and 13 ‚Äì were admitted for various injuries at Stillwater Medical Center; OU Medical Center and The Children's Hospital in Oklahoma City; and St. Johns Medical Center in Tulsa. The intersection was subsequently blocked off by Stillwater and university law enforcement. =Legal proceedings= Chambers was arrested near the crash site by Stillwater Police Department officers present at the scene of the accident on suspicion of driving under the influence; she was later placed into a detox unit in the Payne County Jail. Results of blood tests to gauge the levels of any alcohol or narcotic intoxicants in Chambers' body ‚Äì a requirement for police to administer for \\"serious\\" vehicle accidents involving a fatality under Oklahoma state law ‚Äì revealed she had a blood alcohol level of .01, not enough to be charged with driving under the influence. Chambers was arraigned at Payne County District Court on October 26, with any additional charges against her pending further investigation into the cause of the collision that is presented to the Payne County District Attorney's office. Chambers was charged with four counts of second-degree murder and 46 charges of assault. Her bail was set at $1 million. Her trial was scheduled to begin January 10, 2017. On January 10, 2017, she was sentenced to life in prison after accepting a plea deal. On January 10, 2017, Adacia Avery Chambers pleaded no contest to four counts of second-degree murder and 39 counts of assault and battery by means or force likely to produce death. Chambers received life in prison for each murder count, to be served concurrently, and 10 years in prison for each assault count, to also be served concurrently. The plea agreement ensures Chambers will serve a 55-year sentence and will not leave prison until her early 70s, pending parole for both the life sentence and assault sentence. Reactions During a press conference on the crash held that afternoon, Burns Hargis, president of Oklahoma State University, stated, \\"Tragically we lost three. I hope we don't lose anymore. [...] The Cowboy family pulls together, unfortunately, we‚Äôve had to do it before, and we're going to do it again.\\" Stillwater mayor Gina Noble, who had served as the parade's grand marshal, later remarked that \\"We are heartbroken at this tragedy.\\" Noble later commented, \\"We‚Äôve never seen anything like this. [...] We‚Äôre shocked. We are definitely subdued in mood and we‚Äôre still trying to understand. [...] We will get through this together and figure out how to help those who need the help.\\" The homecoming football game between Oklahoma State and Kansas ‚Äì in which the Cowboys defeated the Jayhawks, 58-10 ‚Äì was played as scheduled at 2:30 p.m. that afternoon; a pep rally originally set to be held before the game was cancelled, however. Before the game (which was televised nationally on FS1), Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin, an alumna of the university who was in attendance at the game, led players and spectators in a moment of prayer as the United States flag flew at half staff in Boone Pickens Stadium. Fallin expressed condolences during a press conference that occurred during halftime of the game, \\"Our hearts and prayers go out with those who lost loved ones today, to those that were injured in the tragedy,\\" and referenced the two previous tragedies involving the university during the past 14 years (the January 2001 plane crash that killed ten members of the Cowboys basketball team and the November 2011 plane crash that killed four people, including Cowgirls basketball head coach Kurt Budke and assistant coach Miranda Serna), adding \\"One thing I do know about Oklahoma people. They‚Äôre strong. They're very compassionate. They believe in prayer. They believe in comforting people and helping during a time of crisis and need. We‚Äôll get through this again. But certainly it‚Äôs a very painful experience for those of us here, and certainly for all Oklahomans.\\" References External links *Video shows moment of Oklahoma State parade crash Category:2015 disasters in the United States Category:2015 in sports in Oklahoma Category:2015 road incidents Category:Driving under the influence 2015 homecoming parade crash Category:Transportation disasters in Oklahoma Category:Filmed accidental deaths Category:Vehicular rampage in the United States Category:October 2015 events in the United States ","title":"2015 Oklahoma State University homecoming parade crash"},{"id":"48349198","text":"Gertrude Kuh (1893‚Äì1977) was an American landscape architect who worked primarily in the Chicago area. Education and personal life Gertrude Eisendrath was born September 11, 1893, in Racine, Wisconsin, to Benjamin David Eisendrath and Frances Eisendrath. Her family moved to Chicago when she was six. She began her college education at Sweet Briar College in Virginia but quickly transferred to the Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture in Groton, Massachusetts, from which she graduated in 1917. After college, Kuh undertook an apprenticeship with the landscape architect Ellen Biddle Shipman in Massachusetts. In 1921, she returned to Chicago. In 1942, Gertrude married George Kuh, whose ex-wife was Chicago art curator and gallery owner Katharine Kuh. She had been previously married to Jerome Deimel; who died in 1926. She had a son, John (b1926-d2018), with Jerome Deimel. Career Over a career spanning some forty years, Kuh designed over 400 landscaping projects and gardens. Although she never took on partners, she had two associates, Mary Long Rogers and Edith Antognoli. Little is known about her early work (prior to 1950) since Kuh discarded most of the records of these projects. Between 1950 and her retirement in the 1970s, Kuh designed some 250 landscaping projects about which somewhat more is known, mostly for private residences in and around Chicago, Lake Forest, Winnetka, Glencoe, and Highland Park, Illinois. She worked on both plantings for new construction and redesigns of existing landscaping. She was designing in an era when many large estates were being broken up into smaller parcels, and she became known for her skill at helping these small plots maintain a sense of spaciousness and privacy through such techniques as clustering trees and shrubs, planting trees with strong sculptural lines that signaled grandeur, and using color schemes that skewed towards green. Kuh died in September 1977. Her papers are held by the Art Institute of Chicago and include letters from Shipman and an oral interview with Kuh's son John. In November 1997, the Art Institute of Chicago mounted \\"The Modern Midwestern Landscape,\\" an exhibition featuring her work and that of fellow landscape architect Franz Lipp. Further reading *Fitzsimons, Mary Elizabeth.

Grill currently lives and works in Queens, New York. For her undergraduate degree, Grill attended the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. She received instruction in painting at the nearby St. Catherine University because her university did not have an art department. After college, she moved to New York City to pursue her MFA at Pratt Institute. Grill began her career in New York as a figurative painter. In 2008, the New York Times described Grill as a landscape and figurative painter in a profile of her and other artists' work in a group show at Aljira, a Center for Contemporary Art in Newark. In her artist statement for her 2010 show, \\"What You're Told,\\" at the Jen Bekman Gallery, Grill elaborated on her inspiration, source material and process: \\"I think about the beliefs and stories that were handed down to me and I reinterpret them in my paintings. Family folklore, backyard rituals, religious sacraments, ghost stories, church, school, obedience and trust in what you're told are among my subjects. The things we're taught can be learned a thousand different ways. I like for the familiar to seem a little unfamiliar and complicated, because it is. I look at images from the past as I work because they're heartbreaking and so haunting ‚Äì what was never can be again. I mess with my imagery, layering and wearing it away until I've made a painting that makes you notice the paint as much as the pictures.\\" Grill's recent works are abstract, drawing inspiration from early American sampler embroidery. After studying artists Peter Doig and Mamma Andersson, Grill began to rely her source material for a mood, rather than a literal imagery or narrative. Grill's 2015 Touch‚Äôd Lustre was her fifth solo show in New York, and her first show at the gallery Zieher Smith & Horton. The show included eight large, abstract, oil-on-linen paintings. Further departing from her figurative beginnings, the paintings' imagery referred to modernist abstraction. The show attracted critical attention from publications including The New York Times, The Brooklyn Rail, and Hyperallergic. She is represented by Horton Gallery in New York City.

He is notable for being the first Chinese-Guianese member of both the British Guiana Legislative and Executive Councils.  Early life  Wong was born in Georgetown, British Guiana, the eldest son of a wealthy Chinese merchant. He studied engineering and economics at the University of Bristol, receiving a B.Sc. degree in 1917 in England.  Career  = Business = Prevented by poor eyesight from serving in World War I, Wong returned to the Colony to serve as a civil engineer in government service, designing sea walls, bridges, roads, sluices and other infrastructure. He thereafter managed a family sugar plantation and refinery. = Politics = In 1926, at age 31, Wong won election to the British Guiana Court of Policy from the Essequibo Islands. This body became the Legislative Council following a Constitutional change in 1928. As a result, Wong has been identified as the first person of East Asian descent elected to a national legislature in the Americas. His subsequent appointment to the Executive Council was also a first for a West Indian Chinese. As a legislator, Wong was a principal proponent of the introduction of personal income taxation. Wong won election to a subsequent term on the Legislative Council in 1934 under a slogan reflecting his initials: Right Vanquishes Every Wrong. Wong's business interests included Good Hope Ranch in the Rupununi Savannah, Anchor Ranch in Berbice, and interests in an abattoir, tannery and shoemaking factory. He owned a number of stone quarries, as well as oil and bauxite mining concessions. Wong promoted a government and internationally financed sustainable development project for tropical hardwood industry, cut short by World War II. Wong was co-founder and President of the Durban Race Club. Corruption charges leveled at Wong's 1934 election campaign led to a new election, which Wong won narrowly, for his final term in office. Wong was charged in the press with holding a monopoly in the stone quarry business. His stone quarry on the Essequibo was expropriated by the Allies during World War II under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, and supplied stone for air defenses throughout the Caribbean. Wong died on October 19, 1952.  In popular culture  Good Hope Ranch, referred to as Wong's Ranch, is featured in Evelyn Waugh's travel memoir Ninety-Two Days. Wong was a hero to Waugh's guide Yetto, on account of his reputation for high play at cards.  Personal life  Wong married Cheu-Leen Ho-A-Shoo, daughter of another notable Chinese family in the Colony, in Barbados, shortly after they completed their University studies in England. He was survived by Cheu-Leen, four daughters and one son, Evan Wong, named for the family patriarch.

Congdon is the author of Art Inc: The Essential Guide to Building Your Career as an Artist; Whatever You Are, Be a Good One; Twenty Ways to Draw a Tulip; Fortune Favors the Brave; The Joy of Swimming; A Glorious Freedom: Older Women Leading Extraordinary Lives; and A Collection A Day. She has also illustrated six coloring books for adults as part of her Just Add Color series. Notable books adorned by Lisa‚Äôs illustrations include Broad Strokes (Chronicle Books, 2017) and Tender Buttons, by Gertrude Stein (Chronicle Books, 2013). Biography Congdon grew up in upstate New York and Northern California. She married her partner Clay Lauren Walsh on June 1, 2013. She lives and works in Portland, Oregon. =Awards and honors= Congdon was named one of 40 Women Over 40 to Watch in 2015 and she is featured in the 2017 book, 200 Women Who Will Change the Way you See the World.  Authored books  =A Collection A Day= Congdon started a blog called A Collection A Day, which was started in January 2010. Over the course of a year, Congdon posted a collection a day of various items she has acquired. According to Congdon, the collections were assembled from \\"flea markets, thrift stores, junk shops, garage sales, giveaway piles and family attics.\\" The collections featured are often everyday objects such as 14 mid-century napkin rings (day 113) or eight old pencil sharpeners for Day 78). A Collection A Day was published as a printed book in 2011 by UPPERCASE magazine. =Whatever You Are, Be a Good One= Published in April 2014 by Chronicle Books, Whatever You Are, Be a Good One is a collection of 100 timeless quotes from some of histories' most notable minds, all illustrated and hand-lettered by Lisa Congdon. Some of the quotes come from the likes of Albert Camus, Oscar Wilde, Leo Tolstoy, and Anais Nin. The book began when Congdon wanted to incorporate more hand-lettering into her practice, which she started to do by creating her \\"365 Days of Hand Lettering Project\\" on her blog over the course of 2012. The project evolved from drawing individual letters to full quotes. Over time, after Congdon had shared these images, she learned that readers found that the quotes had \\"...comforted them in times of darkness or reminded them to approach a challenge in a new way.\\" From there, the focus of the book became a celebration of great thinkers as well as a way of sharing their words with a larger community. =Art Inc. The Essential Guide for Building Your Career as an Artist= Congdon also authored Art Inc. The Essential Guide for Building Your Career as an Artist which was published in August 2014 by Chronicle Books. The book introduces information about creating and starting a creative business, as well as offers insight from other illustrators, designers and entrepreneurs. The book offers tools and information on how to \\"set actionable goals, diversify your income, manage your bookkeeping, copyright your work, promote with social media, build a standout website, exhibit with galleries, sell and price your work, license your art, acquire an agent, and more.\\" =Fortune Favors the Brave= Published in August 2015 by Chronicle Books, and similar to here prior book Whatever You Are, Be A Good One, Fortune Favors the Brave features 100 illustrated and hand-lettered quotations themed on courage, bravery, authenticity, and being yourself. =The Joy of Swimming: A Celebration of Our Love for Getting in the Water= Debuted in April 2016 and published by Chronicle Books, The Joy of Swimming: A Celebration of Our Love for Getting in the Water, celebrates swimming through inspirational hand lettered quotes, watercolor portraits of swimmers paired with real personal swimming stories, and illustrated collections of swimming objects such and traditional pool signs, bathing suits through history. The book also includes a foreword written by Lynne Cox, an American long-distance open-water swimmer and writer. = A Glorious Freedom: Older Women Leading Extraordinary Lives = Published by Chronicle Books in October 2017, A Glorious Freedom: Older Women Leading Extraordinary Lives, explores the power of women over the age of forty who are thriving and living life on their own terms. Profiles, interviews, and essays from women‚Äîincluding Vera Wang, Laura Ingalls Wilder, Julia Child, Cheryl Strayed, and many more‚Äîwho've found creative fulfillment and accomplished great things in the second half of their lives are lavishly illustrated and hand-lettered in Congdon's signature style.  Art exhibitions  Congdon's gallery (group and solo) shows include participation at the Dorothy Saxe Invitational Exhibition at the Contemporary Jewish Museum (San Francisco, 2012), Museum of Design (Atlanta, 2017), Bedford Gallery (Walnut Creek, CA, 2013, 2014), and Fullerton College in 2018.

After parent protests and the publication in 1976 of a report commissioned by the Inner London Education Authority, the affair led to an increase in government authority over education in England and Wales and a reduction in the autonomy of the local education authorities. Events In January 1974, Terry Ellis was appointed headmaster of the William Tyndale Junior School, located in Islington between the gentrified area of Canonbury Square and several large council estates.John Davis, \\"The Inner London Education Authority and the William Tyndale Junior School Affair, 1974-1976\\", Oxford Review of Education 28.2/3, A Century of Local Education Authorities (June-September 2002) 275-98. He and deputy head Brian Haddow instituted a radical child-centred system, the 'integrated day',Gerald Haigh, \\"Flutterings from the Tyndale affair\\", Times Educational Supplement, 7 July 2006, updated 12 May 2008. under which the school day was divided into alternating 'open' and 'closed' one-hour periods, with pupils free to choose what they did in the open periods. They had great freedom and access to all parts of the school, \\"even the staff common room and lavatories\\".Mark Jackson and John Gretton, William Tyndale: Collapse of a school--or a system?, A Times Educational Supplement special report, London: Allen & Unwin, 1976, , cited in Haigh. Ellis responded to parents' concerns that children were being allowed to roam the streets: \\"What do you expect me to do? Make the school into a concentration camp to keep your children in?\\"Robert Peal, \\"Islington: Children as Guinea Pigs of the Left\\", Standpoint, May 2014. Ellis and his colleagues went beyond traditional progressive education of the period as recommended in the Plowden Report,\\"Plowden‚Äôs progress\\", The Economist, 18 June 1998. which they saw as chiefly benefitting better-off children whose parents could help them with their work; rather, in Ellis's words Tyndale \\"geared its main educational effort towards the disadvantaged.\\"Davis, pp. 283-84. Frank Musgrove, a professor of education, has described the Tyndale experiment as \\"implement[ing] a fair selection of sociologically inspired cliches in the repertoire of advanced diploma courses for serving teachers.\\"Frank Musgrove, School and the Social Order, Chichester, [West Sussex] / New York: Wiley, 1979, , p. 193, quoted in Alan Barcan, Sociological Theory and Educational Reality: Education and Society in Australia since 1949, Kensington, New South Wales: New South Wales University, 1993, , pp. 171-72. A cloakroom was converted into a 'sanctuary' for disturbed children with a special teacher, and to provide all the children with an outlet for their own skills, a steel band was organised which practised as much as eight hours a week. Severe disciplinary problems arose that the staff were unable to solve, including gambling away of lunch money, fire-starting and throwing full milk bottles into the infants' playground from the roof of the toilets. Annie Walker, a part-time remedial reading teacher, led a protest by the minority of staff who objected to the changes, and issued a circular to parents; many parents, particularly of academically able children, withdrew their children or refused to allow them to continue from the infant school in the same building, so that the number enrolled fell sharply, eventually to 55 from 230 in 1973. The teachers had refused to allow the formation of a parent- teacher association because they thought it would be dominated by middle-class parents; since there was none, the parental complaints and staff disagreement caused the school managers to become involved on the side of the protesting staff, including seeking to inspect the school and witness classes. The dispute was widely covered in the pressKathryn Riley, \\"William Tyndale 'nourished agenda', Times Educational Supplement, 18 October 1996. and there was general agreement that the children were receiving a poor education.Brian E. Woolnough, Physics Teaching in Schools, 1960-85: Of People, Policy, and Power, Studies in Curriculum History 8, London/New York: Falmer, 1988, , p. 14. The Inner London Education Authority responded to the managers' appeal in autumn 1975 by sending a team of inspectors to the school, who were at first forced to teach children themselves since the radical teachers had set up a rival 'strike school' elsewhere. The ILEA endorsed pupil-centred teaching and many 'experimental' schools at the time were in London, and under Ellis's predecessor Alan Head, Tyndale had been noted for team teaching, but the authority allowed heads considerable autonomy and had increasingly replaced inspection of primary schools with support for teachers and self-evaluation; the affair revealed a general reluctance of local education authorities to set policy and problems dealing with inadequate teachers.Woolnough, pp. 14-15, 182-83. It also widened the conflict between the ILEA and the Inner London boroughs, which had no control over education but did appoint the boards of secondary schools and the managers of primary schools. Investigation and aftermath A parliamentary inquiry was conducted from October 1975 to February 1976 by Robin Auld, QC. The Auld Report, published in 1976, did not attempt to formally assess children's mastery of skills such as reading, but was critical of all concerned.\\"Freedom that led to chaos in school\\", The Glasgow Herald, 17 July 1976, p. 3. Ellis, Haddow and five other teachers were dismissed based on it, but the local authority itself was found to have not fulfilled its legal responsibilities. A book by two Times Educational Supplement journalists, Mark Jackson and John Gretton, advocated government intervention to define and enforce educational standards: \\"After William Tyndale, the Secretary of State can no longer pretend, as he and his predecessors have so often tended to do, that it is all happening somewhere else.\\" The affair catalysed public loss of confidence in the management of the education system and led to 'The Great Debate' on state education after Prime Minister James Callaghan's speech at Ruskin College in October 1976, in which he referred to \\"the new informal methods of teaching, which seem to produce excellent results when they are in well-qualified hands but are much more dubious when they are not\\", and eventually to state standards and policies which greatly reduced the freedom of the local education authorities and the autonomy of teachers in individual schools.Davis, p. 292.Woolnough, pp. 14-15.Roger Seifert, Teacher Militancy: A History of Teacher Strikes 1896-1987, London: Falmer, 1987, , p. 134: \\"part of the process that has taken us to the brink of central control of all aspects of school and teacher existence in the state sector\\", quoted in Davis, p. 292. It also probably contributed to the eventual dissolution of the ILEA.Davis, p. 293.

After a period of decline in the 17th century mining resurged in the 18th and early 19th century this time revolving chiefly around silver. In the 1870s silver mining declined sharply. Chile took over the highly lucrative saltpetre mining districts of Peru and Bolivia in the War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì83). In the first half of the 20th century copper mining overshadowed the declining saltpetre mining. Pre-Hispanic mining Incas exploited placer gold in the northern half of Chile prior to the arrival of the Spanish. It has been claimed that the Inca Empire expanded into Diaguita lands because of its mineral wealth. This hypothesis was as of 1988 under dispute. Further, an additional possibility is that the Incas invaded the relatively well-populated Eastern Diaguita valleys (present-day Argentina) to obtain labor to send to Chilean mining districts. Archaeologists Tom Dillehay and Am√©rico Gordon claim Incan yanakuna extracted gold south of the Incan frontier in free Mapuche territory. Following this thought, the main motive for Incan expansion into Mapuche territory would have been to access gold mines. Besides gold indigenous people in Chile did also mined native copper and copper minerals producing copper bracelets, earrings and weapons. The use of copper in Chile can be traced to 500 BC. While Pre-Hispanic Mapuche tools are known to have been relatively simple and made of wood and stone a few them were actually made of copper and bronze.Villalobos et al. 1974, p. 50.Bengoa 2003, pp. 190‚Äì191. Colonial mining (1541‚Äì1810) Pedro de Valdivia the conquistador that bought much of Chile under Spanish rule and initiated mining on behalf of the Spanish. Pedro Mari√±o de Lobera records that a common story in Chile at the time of Valdivia's death was that Valdivia had been killed by Mapuches that forced him to drink molten gold. Early Spaniards extracted gold from placer deposits using indigenous labour. This contributed to usher the Arauco War as native Mapuches lacked a tradition of forced labour like the Andean mita and largely refused to serve the Spanish. The key area of the Arauco War were the valleys around Cordillera de Nahuelbuta where the Spanish designs for this region was to exploit the placer deposits of gold using unfree Mapuche labour from the nearby and densely populated valleys. Deaths related to mining contributed to a population decline among native Mapuches. Another site of Spanish mining was the city Villarrica. At this city the Spanish mined gold placers and silver.Petit-Breuilh 2004, pp. 48‚Äì49. The original site of the city was likely close to modern Puc√≥n. However at some point in the 16th century it is presumed the gold placers were buried by lahars flowing down from nearby Villarrica Volcano. This prompted settlers to relocate the city further west at its modern location. While of less importance than gold districts in the south the Spanish did also carried out mining operations in Central Chile. There the whole economy was oriented towards mining. As indigenous populations in Central Chile declined to about 30% its 1540s population towards the end of the 16th century and gold deposits became depleted the Spanish of Central Chile begun to focus on livestock operations. Mining activity declined in the late 16th century as the richest part of placer deposits, which are usually the most shallow, became exhausted. The decline was aggravated by the collapse of the Spanish cities in the south following the battle of Curalaba (1598) which meant for the Spaniards the loss of both the main gold districts and the largest indigenous labour sources.*Salazar, Gabriel; Pinto, Julio (2002). Historia contempor√°nea de Chile III. La econom√≠a: mercados empresarios y trabajadores (in Spanish). LOM Ediciones. p. 15. Compared to the 16th and 18th centuries Chilean mining activity in the 17th century was very limited.Villalobos et al. 1974, p. 168. Gold production totaled as little as 350 kg over the whole century. Chile exported minor amounts of copper to the rest of the Viceryoalty of Peru in the 17th century. Chile saw an unprecedented revival of its mining activity in the 18th century with annual gold production rising from 400 to 1000 kg over the course of the century and the silver annual production rising from 1000 to 5000 kg in the same interval.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 226‚Äì227. Chilean copper mining of high-grade oxidized copper minerals and melted with charcoal produced 80,000 to 85,000 tons of copper in the 1541‚Äì1810 period. Gold, silver and copper from Chilean mining begun to be exported directly to Spain via the Straits of Magellan and Buenos Aires first in the 18th century.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 16‚Äì17. By the first half of the 18th century sulfur was being mined from the extinct volcanoes in the Andes around Copiap√≥.Petit-Breuilh 2004, p. 55. This element was crucial for the fabrication of gunpowder.Petit-Breuilh 2004, p. 44. Early Spanish conquistadores and explorers were aware of the existence of coal in Chilean territory. For example, Diego de Rosales noted that when governor Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza and his men stayed in Quiriquina Island (36.5¬∞ S) in 1557 they made fire using local coals. In Magallanes Region coal was first discovered by the expedition of Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa who visited the Straits of Magellan in 1584. Silver rushes and early coal mining (1810‚Äì1870) Drawing of an early 19th-century Chilean miner. Following the discovery of silver at Agua Amarga (1811) and Arqueros (1825) the Norte Chico mountains north of La Serena (part of the Chilean Iron Belt) were exhaustively prospected.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 469‚Äì472.Los ciclos mineros del cobre y la plata. Memoria Chilena.Bethell, Leslie. 1993. Chile Since Independence. Cambridge University Press. p. 13‚Äì14. In 1832 prospector Juan Godoy found a silver outcrop (revent√≥n) 50 km south of Copiap√≥ in Cha√±arcillo. The finding attracted thousands of people to the place and generated significant wealth. After the discovery of Cha√±arcillo, many other ores were discovered near Copiap√≥ well into the 1840s. Copiap√≥ experienced a large demographic and urbanistic growth during the rush. The town became a centre for trade and services of a large mining district. The mining zone slowly grew northwards into the diffuse border with Bolivia. At the end of the silver rush rich miners had diversified their assets into banking, agriculture, trade and commerce all over Chile. A last major discovery of silver occurred 1870 in Caracoles in Bolivian territory adjacent to Chile. Apart from being discovered by Chileans, the ore was also extracted with Chilean capital and miners. In the 19th century Claudio Gay and Benjam√≠n Vicu√±a Mackenna where among the first to raise the question of the deforestation of Norte Chico caused by the firewood demands of the mining activity. Despite the reality of the degradation caused by mining, and contrary to popular belief, the Norte Chico forests were not pristine either before the onset of mining in the 18th century. Besides silver coal mining also boomed in the early republican period. As coal mining was commonplace in industrialized Britain early British travellers had the opportunity to comment on Chilean coals before they were profitable. British travelers had differing opinions on the economic value of Chilean coals, or more specifically, the coals of Zona Central Sur (36‚Äì38¬∞ S). While David Barry found the coals to be of good quality, Charles Darwin held them of to be of little value. The British consul in Chile correctly predicted in 1825 that the area around the mouth of Biob√≠o River would be a centre of coal industry. It was however not until the mid-19th century that large scale coal mining begun in the region.Endlicher, Wilfried. 1986. Desarrollo Hist√≥rico-gen√©tico y Divisi√≥n Funcional del Centro Carbon√≠fero. Revista de Geograf√≠a Norte Grande. The initial trigger of coal mining was the arrival of steamships to the port of Talcahuano. These steam ships, most of whom were English, bought initially the coal very cheaply and the exploited coal seams were easy to work as they laid almost at ground level. Demand of coal stemmed not only from steam navigation but from the growth of copper mining in northern Chile. As wood in northern Chile became increasingly scarce copper smelters recurred to the coals found around Zona Central Sur. Demand from copper smelters proved in 1840s crucial to stabilize the coal business. Coal mining operations were chiefly owned by Chilean businessmen contrasting with the heavy foreign involvement seen in silver mining and later also in salpeter and copper mining. Silver mining and coal mining were somewhat linked by Mat√≠as Cousi√±o a silver mining magnate who expanded into the coal business. Cousi√±o begun mining operations in Lota in 1852 a move that rapidly transformed the town, from being a sparsely populated frontier zone in the mid-19th century, into a large industrial hub that attracted immigrants from all over Chile well into the 20th century. Saltpetre Era (1870‚Äì1930) Starting in 1873, Chile's economy deteriorated. Several of Chile's key exports were out-competedVillalobos et al. 1974, pp. 6003-605. and Chile's silver mining income dropped. In the mid-1870s, Peru nationalized its nitrate industry, affecting both British and Chilean interests.Palma, Gabriel. Trying to 'Tax and Spend' Oneself out of the 'Dutch Disease': The Chilean Economy from the War of the Pacific to the Great Depression. p. 217‚Äì240 Contemporaries considered the crisis the worst ever of independent Chile. Chilean newspaper El Ferrocarril predicted 1879 to be \\"a year of mass business liquidation\\". In 1878, then-President An√≠bal Pinto expressed his concern through the following statement: Humberstone, a saltpetre work from the Saltpetre Republic epoch. It was during this context of economic crisis that Chile became involved the costly Saltpetre War (1879‚Äì1883) wrestling control of mineral-rich provinces of Peru and Bolivia. The notion that Chile entered the war to obtain economical gains has been a topic of debate among historians. As the victor and possessor of a new coastal territory following the War of the Pacific, Chile benefited by gaining a lucrative territory with significant mineral income. The national treasury grew by 900 percent between 1879 and 1902, due to taxes coming from the newly acquired lands.Crow, The Epic of Latin America, p. 180 British involvement and control of the nitrate industry rose significantly,Foster, John B. & Clark, Brett. (2003). \\"Ecological Imperialism: The Curse of Capitalism\\" (accessed September 2, 2005). The Socialist Register 2004, p190‚Äì192. Also available in print from Merlin Press. but from 1901 to 1921 Chilean ownership increased from 15% to 51%.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 124-125. The growth of Chilean economy sustained in its saltpetre monopoly meant, compared to the previous growth cycle (1832‚Äì1873), that the economy became less diversified and overly dependent on a single natural resource. In addition the Chilean nitrate, used worldwide as fertilizer, was sensitive to economic downturns as farmers made cuts on fertilizer use one of their earliest economic measures in the face of economic decline. It has been questioned on whether the nitrate wealth conquered in the War of the Pacific was a resource curse or not. During the Nitrate Epoch the government increased public spending but was however accused of squandering money.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 25‚Äì29. Photograph of Chilean salpeter miners. When conquering Peruvian territories in 1880 Chile imposed a 1.6 $ tax on each quintal exported. This tax made saltpetre more expensive at a global scale, in other words it was a \\"tax exportation\\". In the 1920s this tax begun to be considered obsolete by Chilean politicians. A new mining code was enacted in 1888. From 1876 to 1891 Chilean copper mining declined, being largely replaced in international markets by copper from the United States and R√≠o Tinto in Spain. This was in part due to the exhaustion of supergene (shallow) high-grade ores. The introduction of new extraction techniques and technology in the early 20th century contributed to a significant resurgence of copper mining. Technological innovation in drilling, blasting, loading and transport made it profitable to mine large low-grade porphyry copper deposits. Copper Era (1930‚Äì2010) Chilean copper miners In the 1910s the main copper mining countries were Chile, Spain and the United States. The tax paid by copper mining amounted to \\"little or nothing\\". In the 1950s the taxation on copper mining was reformed. In 1932 a new mining code replaced the older code from 1888. The Law on Mining Concessions was rectified in 1982 moving mining concessions rights away from the ad coelum principle. Investments in mineral exploration in Chile reached a maximum 1997 and declined from there on to 2003. As a consequence of this by 2004 there were relatively few active mining projects. From 1995 to 2004 the principal discoveries were the copper porphyries of Escondida and Toki. In addition these in the 1995‚Äì2004 period a larger group medium-sized mineral deposits (with non-mineralized cover rocks) were discovered including Candelaria, El Pe√±√≥n, Gaby Sur, Pascua Lama and Spence. Another tendency by 2004 was that the number of companies involved in exploration had diminished due to mergers. References Bibliography * *Salazar, Gabriel; Pinto, Julio (2002).

Biography  Jol√°n Gross-Bettelheim (1900‚Äì1972) was born in Hungary, but lived in the United States from 1925-1956. She studied painting at the Budapest School of Fine Art in 1919, followed by studies at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna and the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnst in Berlin. Gross-Bettelheim then studied in Paris at the Acad√©mie de Grande Chaumi√®re between 1922-24. She married a Hungarian-born radiologist, Frigyes Bettelheim, and settled in Cleveland by 1925. Her studies in Ohio commenced at the Cleveland School of Art with modernist painter Henry Keller. She and her husband relocated to New York City in 1938. As a communist, Gross-Bettelheim was a member of the John Reed Club, as well as the American Artists‚Äô Congress. She contributed to leftist publications such as New Masses and the Daily Worker. Her work was exhibited in Chicago, New York, Ohio, Philadelphia, Seattle, and Washington D.C. throughout the 1930s and 40s. She returned to Hungary after 1956 and died in Budapest in 1972.  Cleveland and the WPA  Gross-Bettelheim worked in Cleveland at a time when printmaking was flourishing. It was a time when lithography was seen as a viable art form, rather than being limited to commercial use. Interest in printmaking was bolstered by art organizations that were founded in the 1920s. And the Cleveland Print Makers (CPM) was formed in 1930 by artist and teacher K√°lm√°n Kubinyi. It engaged in numerous activities to expand exposure for Cleveland printmakers, with the goal of increasing the sales of their works. Its most ambitious activity was the Print Mart or Market during which artists opened a gallery to sell works to the general public. The Print Market featured America Today in November 1936, an exhibition that was held in thirty U.S. cities simultaneously. The show included 100 prints created by artists from the American Artists‚Äô Congress, including Gross-Bettelheim. Gross-Bettelheim also was commissioned to create a print for the CPM‚Äôs Print-a-Month series, a subscription for one print per month by Cleveland and some nonresident artists. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) Federal Art Project (FAP) had a graphic arts division of which printmaking was a part. A graphic arts workshop was set up in Cleveland as a part of the WPA, operating officially as Graphic Arts Project No. 8048 from December 1935 to 1943, being most productive in 1936-37. Gross-Bettelheim produced prints for the WPA graphics workshop, as well. The American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) sponsored a traveling exhibition, Fifty Prints of the Year, which included work by Gross-Bettelheim.  Themes  Gross-Bettelheim‚Äôs prints explore the darkness of the Depression, employing a cubist style that heightens the drama of cityscapes and the industrial landscape. Sabine Kretzschmar describes Gross-Bettelheim as ‚Äúthe purest modernist‚Äù amongst Cleveland printmakers, reflecting the influence of German expressionism, constructivism, and cubism. Her work explored social and political issues. The plight of unemployment is addressed in her print In the Employment Office (ca. 1936, lithograph) and racism in Workers Meeting (Scottsboro Boys) (ca. 1935, drypoint). The stark black and white images convey a sense of humanity being oppressed by the scale of industry. For example, Gross-Bettelheim‚Äôs ca. 1940 lithograph Assembly Line portrays a claustrophobic space filled with workers and a haunting image of lines of gas masks on a factory assembly line. Her 1936 lithograph Civilization at the Crossroads (Fascism II) depicts the rising threat of Fascism in Europe.  Works  * Assembly Line, ca. 1940, lithograph on paper, 11 1/2 x 9 7/8 in.

He attended secondary school in Fiume and later enrolled as a student in the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of Budapest. During World War I he interrupted his studies to fight as artillery officer, and became wounded and was decorated for military valor. From 1916 to 1920 he studied at the University of Rome under supervision of Giulio Cotronei. He graduated on a thesis on the effect of starvation on the digestive tract of the eel. He was assistant to Giovanni Batista Grassi and later succeeded Grassi as director of the Comparative Anatomy Institute of the Sapienza University of Rome. He later moved to the University of Padua where he founded the hydrobiological station in Chioggia that now bears his name. He was a member of the Accademia dei Lincei and a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences. His work covered marine biology and his interests ranged from physiology to hydrobiology, oceanography and evolutionary theory. He described numerous species, published over 300 papers and authored several books, among them Trattato di Zoologia (1953) and Elementi di Biologia Generale (1945). He studied the effect of reduced fishing effort on the fish stocks in the Adriatic Sea during World War I when fisheries were much reduced.Israel, G., & Gasca, A. M. (2002). Letters between Umberto D‚ÄôAncona and Vito Volterra. In The Biology of Numbers (pp. 130-200). Birkh√§user Basel. In 1926 he married Luisa Volterra, daughter of the mathematician Vito Volterra.

The publication of this book in homage to Volterra in 1942 in fascist-controlled Italy is noteworthy as Volterra had refused to sign the oath of allegiance to the fascist government, and had to resign his university post and his membership of scientific academies as a result.Gatto, M.

Geography  The site is located on the former Wauwilersee lakeshore in the municipalities of Egolzwil, Wauwil and Sch√∂tz in the Canton of Luzern in Switzerland. The settlement comprises , and the buffer zone including the lake area comprises in all. To 20000 BC a branch of the Reuss glacier formed a valley whose deepest point was approximately below the present surface. At Sch√∂tz the glacier stopped, as shown by the impressive moraines. During the retreat of the glacier, meltwater jammed between the moraines. Thus in the Wauwilermoos plain three lakes were formed: Wauwilersee, Hagimoos and Mauensee; latter still exists. The meltwater outsourced enormous amounts of sand, so that the lakes never were particularly deep. The depth of Wauwilersee amounted only to about . To 17000 BC the area was finally free of ice, and soon first pioneer plants settled, such as dwarf birch and mountain avens on, typically for a post-glacial tundra landscape. To 14000 BC the silting up of the three lakes by sand, lake marl and peat began. As a result of climatic changes, the lake levels have been fluctuating over the course of the Stone Age era. So the water level rose several times, and the area covered by water was enlarged: on the one hand, the waves formed the beach ridges between Wauwil and Ettiswil, on the other hand, the radicals old Stone Age and middle Stone Age settlement sites were captured by the rising water, wiped and finally covered with lake sediments. The Neolithic lake dwellings also were covered with lake sediments. At the former Wauwilersee lake area, peat was mined between 1820 and about 1920, and the lake was drained around 1859. To date, the area is still drained in order to make it usable for agriculture. The moorlands in Wauwilermoos therefore disappeared except for small residual areas. Since July 2009 there is also a waterbird and migratory bird reserve of national importance, to protect migratory and waterfowl year-round living in Switzerland.  Description  Egolzwil 3 is one of the earliest lake-dwelling settlements in Switzerland. Therefore, it contains an important archaeological Egolzwil culture reference assemblage. The houses in this region were built directly on the ground, as the well-preserved house floors with hearths prove. The village was inhabited only for six years, and thus shows a short but precisely defined episode within the Neolithic period. Moreover, it provides favourable preservation conditions for wood and other organic materials such as plants and bone. The remains of the settlements are an important site for palaeo-ecological studies on the Wauwil bog (German: Wauwilermoos).  Excavations and finds  Wauwilermoos open-air museum upright After the draining of the lake in the mid-19th century, first Stone Age settlements have been found in the vast moorland. Due to the excavations that were carried out until 1929, the Wauwil plain became known as an archaeological region. A research based on scientific criteria began in the early 1930s with excavations in Sch√∂tz and at the Neolithic site Egolzwil E2 under the direction of Hans Reinerth. Emil Vogt started systematic excavations from 1950 to 1966 on the settlement sites E3, E4 and E5. After the excavations under Ren√© Wyss in 1965 and 1985‚Äì88, eleven Neolithic and 30 Mesolithic sites were known at the Wauwilermoos, at the beginning of the 21st century even more than 120 Stone Age sites. The first settlements rose after the withdrawal of the Reuss glacier around 13000 BC at six sites. Late Paleolithic (approx. 12000-9000 BC) includes 46 sites situated on an old elevated shoreline of the former lake. These artifacts, among them many burins and typical back and wide lace tee scratches, are attributed to the F√ºrstein culture. The well- documented Egolzwil culture was named after the Wauwilermoos (E3) site, dated shortly after 4300 BC. In addition to the eponymous locality Egolzwil E3, there are four other settlement sites. The short-lived village was built at the ground level in the sedimentation zone of the lake. Its houses were made of timber ash, oak and alder. The interior was illuminated and heat by a centrally disposed fireplace. The hand-shaped ceramic consisted mainly of pots and bowls with two round-bowed handles and an average volume of 1.8 to 2.8 liters, along with some liquid containers (volume of 6-8 liters) and individual so-called Wauwilerbecher cups. Unique are sickles with a straight wooden handle and diagonally sweeping knives made of Silex that was fixed with birch tar, axe shafts, clubs, sticks, furrows, and a textile jewelry container with shells from the Mediterranean area.  Protection  As well as being part of the 56 Swiss sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps, the settlement is also listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance. Hence, the area is provided as a historical site under federal protection, within the meaning of the Swiss Federal Act on the nature and cultural heritage (German: Bundesgesetz √ºber den Natur- und Heimatschutz NHG) of 1 July 1966.

She was active in abolition, reform, and suffragist movements, and was a philanthropist as well as instrumental in the founding of the Rhode Island Humane Society. She was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2017.  Early life  Eddy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to James Eddy, who worked as a painter and engraver, and Elisa Eddy (n√©e Jackson). Her maternal grandfather was the abolitionist, Francis Jackson, and her maternal great uncle was Massachusetts politician, William Jackson, who was also against slavery. On her paternal side, Eddy comes from a large New England family that originally came from Cranbrook, Kent. Eddy studied painting and sculpture at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and New York's Art Students League. One of her teachers was Christian Schussele. Eddy began exhibiting photographs in 1890, at nearly 40 years of age. Her most important exhibitions were at the New School of American Photography and the selection of American Women photographers at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900.  Career  = Photography = Eddy's photography appeared in American and foreign exhibitions until about 1910. She preferred photographing women, children, and artists, and her photographs were included in camera club exhibitions in Providence and Hartford, and were frequently shown at the Boston Camera Club. Juries for photography salons accepted her work in Philadelphia (1898), Pittsburgh (1899, 1900), and Washington, D.C. (1896). In 1903, her pictures were included in salons in Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Toronto. In 1894, Eddy wrote and illustrated a short article \\"A Good Use for the Camera\\" for The American Annual of Photography. In the article, Eddy concludes that the personal interactions she had with her photographic subjects were as rewarding as the finished images. She writes, \\"We enter into sympathetic relations with the people who furnish us with pictures. We are grateful to them and they are very grateful to us. We meet on common ground.\\" The American Annual of Photography subsequently ran illustrations by her in 1895 and 1902. = Painting = In 1883, Eddy painted a portrait of African- American social reformer, Frederick Douglass. In the portrait, Douglass holds a baton that symbolizes his authority during his tenure as marshal of the District of Columbia. Douglass sat for the portrait twice during the summer of 1883. Eddy also painted a portrait of Susan B. Anthony, a copy of which was donated to Bryn Mawr College in 1920.  Activism and philanthropy  = Abolitionism and suffragist rights = Eddy's mother and other family members were active in the anti-slavery and suffrage movements. Eddy herself was a member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. = Animal welfare = An animal welfare activist and vegetarian, Eddy founded the Rhode Island Humane Education Association. Between 1899 and 1938, Eddy wrote or compiled five children's books on animals and their care, which featured photographs of her own felines. At her death, she was the director of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Eddy financed the 1894 American edition of Henry Stephens Salt's book Animals' Rights.Helstosky, Carol. (2015). The Routledge History of Food. Routledge. p. 187.

She studied under Jean-Baptiste Regnault and Jacques-Louis David and produced historical paintings. She was the first woman to become a history painter during the post French Revolution era. Mongez started studying under Jean-Baptiste Regnault in the early 1790s and then, after mastering the basics, she became a pupil of Jacques-Louis David, who at the time was one of the leaders of the Neoclassical movement in France. Her work was featured at a number of salons between 1802 and 1827. Some male reviewers criticized her for including depictions of nudity in her work.  Personal life  Marie-Jos√©phine- Ang√©lique Levol was born on 1 May 1775 in Conflans-l'Archev√®que, near Paris, to Marcel-Sulpice Levol and Marie-Louise Papillon. She married Antoine Mongez, a Director of the Mint, classical scholar and naturalist, who was 28 years older than her. He was also an author of books on arithmetic and algebra for women and published several books on ancient culture, including four volumes called Dictionnaire d'Antiquit√© in 1804, which were illustrated by his wife. His brother was the mineralogist, Jean-Andr√© Mongez. They had a son, Ir√©n√©e- Alexandre, born in 1803 and died in Paris on November 15, 1808. They actually married three times. On the 9th of June, 1792, accompanied by Bon-Joseph Dacier, his colleague at the Academy, Lacepede and the Abbe Sieyes, Mongez and Angelique were married in a civil ceremony. When a new law relating to civil status had been enacted, Mongez complied with all that it required, and on July 1, 1793, he again presented himself before a civil registrar for marriage. Much later, a writ from Pope Pius VII authorized him to marry according to the canons of the Church; which he did on October 26, 1814, in his parish of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s.  Works  Mongez established herself as a Neoclassical history painter from the very beginning, and disregarded criticisms related to her femininity. Over the course of her career, she possessed two smaller studios in addition to the one she maintained at the Mint, up until her death. From engravings to framed drawings to portraits to busts and much more, Mongez‚Äôs personal inventory of her possessions within her studios alone serves as proof of her devotion to Davidian painting. Mongez‚Äô principle works include her first major painting, Astyanax Snatched from His Mother (1802), Alexander Weeping Over the Death of the Wife of Darius I (1804), Theseus and Pirithous (1806), Orpheus in Hell (1808), The Death of Adonis (1810), Perseus and Andromeda (1812), Mars and Venus (1814), Saint Martin Sharing his Cloak with a Beggar (1819), and her last Salon exhibit The Seven Against Thebes (1827). Her subjects emulated the French academic masters, and were comparable to subjects set for the Prix de Rome competitions, which she could not enter due to her sex. However, her work rivaled if not surpassed the work typically seen in the Prix de Rome. Her paintings contained more dynamic compositions and female nudity, something that her male contemporaries were prohibited from depicting within the confines of the Prix de Rome. Mongez often included nude figures in most of her works, which was significant for several reasons: her emulation of David‚Äôs work; a demonstration of her grasp of the most difficult technical aspects of painting; and a confirmation of her understanding of the most modern developments in neoclassical historical painting. However, she received many comments in regards to her inclusion of the male nude in her paintings, despite her married status. Her work was troubling to notions of morality and conceptions of femininity of the time, specifically among sections of the bourgeoisie. Despite this, she received state encouragement and radical class support, as well as patronage from the Russian Prince Youssoupov and Louis XVIII, whose portrait she painted after the Bourbon Restoration. Her connections with David helped her to sell her works to the prince for a grand total of 6000 francs. = Selected works = File:Mongez TheseusAndPirithous MIA 9772.jpgTheseus and Pirithous, 1806 File:LedruRollin by Mongez.jpgPortrait of Alexandre Ledru-Rollin, 1838 File:Mongez Mars et Venus.jpgMars and Venus, 1814  The Artistic Community  Mongez was the pupil of Regnault and David during the 1790s, and was already recognized by the leaders of the Neoclassical movement in France at that time. It was through David that she met Mongez, of whom he was a friend, and Jean-Paul Marat. His paintings were all in the historical genre. They helped persuade Mongez to pursue a similar course as she had long been interested in historical costume and dress. Her husband provided the verification for the accuracy of her paintings. In return, she illustrated 380 figures in the Dictionnaire d'Antiquit√©, of which her husband composed the text. Ang√©lique Mongez exhibited at the Salon for the first time in 1802 and continued until 1827. At the Salon of 1804, she received the first-class gold medal and received another in 1827. She was the first woman to exhibit a large-scale storyboard at the Salon. Astyanax Snatched From His Mother, a picture which she exhibited at the Salon of 1802 provoked much debate among the critics. For Le Journal des Arts, the painting was one of the finest works of the modern school; yet other critics attributed the most beautiful parts to David. Jean-Baptiste Boutard, of the Journal des D√©bats, wrote: \\"It is quite agreed that this painting is, in more than one part, a masterpiece.\\" At the next Salon (1804), Angelique Mongez exhibited another great figure of history: Alexander Weeping Over the Death of the Wife of Darius I for which she received a gold medal. In 1806 she exhibited Theseus and Pirithous, a large painting that was purchased by Prince Youssoupoff, a great collector of French Neoclassical paintings. The canvas was openly criticized for the nakedness of the two characters. Femininity and history painting were then judged incompatible; the modesty of women demanded it. Several critics even thought that Mongez should stop painting historical subjects and devote herself exclusively to themes more appropriate to her sex, which she refused to do, continuing to paint and display them at the Salon. Under the Restoration she made a portrait of Louis XVIII. In 1827, the critic √âtienne-Jean Del√©cluze wrote: \\"Madame Mongez imitated David. The Romulus of the Sabines reappears there in all its nakedness.\\" This comment was directed at The Seven Against Thebes, now at Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts d'Angers. She never gave up history painting and created, a year before her death, a Christ on the Cross (1854) for the church of Saint Peter in Charenton.  Borrowings  Mongez borrowed from other painters. St√©phanie Dermoncourt of the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon points out that her figure of Polystratus carrying water to Darius is very similar to the Oedipus of Ingres. Later, this art historian indicates, \\"‚Ä¶the style of Madame Mongez seems to have evolved towards the art of Ingres\\". Mongez has received much more respect since the late 1990s. She appears in several articles and books devoted to women painters of the Post- Revolutionary period. Several authors have examined the conditions that allowed her to become a history painter, despite the conservatism of the time. = References = Category:1775 births Category:1855 deaths Category:Neoclassical painters Category:French women painters Category:People from Val-de-Marne ","title":"Ang√©lique Mongez"},{"id":"48349765","text":"The bomb pulse is the sudden increase of carbon-14 (14C) in the Earth's atmosphere due to the hundreds of aboveground nuclear bombs tests that started in 1945 and intensified after 1950 until 1963, when the Limited Test Ban Treaty was signed by the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. These hundreds of blasts were followed by a doubling of the relative concentration of 14C in the atmosphere. We discuss ‚Äúrelative concentration‚Äù, because measurements of 14C levels by mass spectrometers are most accurately made by comparison to another carbon isotope, often the common isotope 12C. Isotope abundance ratios are not only more easily measured, they are what14C carbon daters want, since it is the fraction of carbon in a sample that is 14C, not the absolute concentration, that is of interest in dating measurements. The figure shows how the fraction of carbon in the atmosphere that is 14C, of order only a part per trillion, has changed over the past several decades following the bomb tests. Because 12C concentration has increased by about 30% over the past fifty years, the fact that ‚ÄúpMC‚Äù, measuring the isotope ratio, has returned (almost) to its 1955 value, means that 14C concentration in the atmosphere remains some 30% higher than it once was. Carbon-14, the radioisotope of carbon, is naturally developed in trace amounts in the atmosphere and it can be detected in all living organisms. Carbon of all types is continually used to form the molecules of the cells of organisms. Doubling of the concentration of 14C in the atmosphere is reflected in the tissues and cells of all organisms that lived around the period of nuclear testing. This property has many applications in the fields of biology and forensics. 300x300px  Background  The radioisotope carbon-14 is constantly formed from nitrogen-14 (14N) in the higher atmosphere by incoming cosmic rays which generate neutrons. These neutrons collide with 14N to produce 14C which then combines with oxygen to form 14CO2. This radioactive CO2 spreads through the lower atmosphere and the oceans where it is absorbed by the plants and the animals that eat the plants. The radioisotope 14C thus becomes part of the biosphere so that all living organisms contain a certain amount of 14C. Nuclear testing caused a rapid increase in atmospheric 14C (see figure), since the explosion of an atomic bomb also creates neutrons which collide again with 14N and produce 14C. Since the ban on nuclear testing in 1963, atmospheric 14C relative concentration is slowly decreasing at a pace of 4% annually. This continuous decrease permits scientists to determine among others the age of deceased people and allows them to study cell activity in tissues. By measuring the amount of 14C in a population of cells and comparing that to the amount of 14C in the atmosphere during or after the bomb pulse, scientists can estimate when the cells were created and how often they've turned over since then.  Difference with classical radiocarbon dating  Radiocarbon dating has been used since 1946 to determine the age of organic material as old as 50,000 years. As the organism dies, the exchange of 14C with the environment ceases and the incorporated 14C decays. Given the steady decay of radioisotopes (the half-life of 14C is about 5,730 years), the relative amount of 14C left in the dead organism can be used to calculate how long ago it died. Bomb pulse dating should be considered a special form of carbon dating. As discussed above and in the Radiolab episode, Elements (section 'Carbon'), in bomb pulse dating the slow absorption of atmospheric 14C by the biosphere, can be considered as a chronometer. Starting from the pulse around the years 1963 (see figure), atmospheric radiocarbon relative abundance decreased by about 4% a year. So in bomb pulse dating it is the relative amount of 14C in the atmosphere that is decreasing and not the amount of 14C in a dead organisms, as is the case in classical radiocarbon dating. This decrease in atmospheric 14C can be measured in cells and tissues and has permitted scientists to determine the age of individual cells and of deceased people. These applications are very similar to the experiments conducted with pulse-chase analysis in which cellular processes are examined over time by exposing the cells to a labeled compound (pulse) and then to the same compound in an unlabeled form (chase). Radioactivity is a commonly used label in these experiments. An important difference between pulse-chase analysis and bomb- pulse dating is the absence of the chase in the latter. Around the year 2030 the bomb pulse will die out. Every organism born after this will not bear detectable bomb pulse traces and their cells cannot be dated in this way. Radioactive pulses cannot ethically be administered to people just to study the turnover of their cells so the bomb pulse results may be considered as a useful side effect of nuclear testing.  Applications  The fact that cells and tissues reflect the doubling of 14C in the atmosphere during and after nuclear testing, has been of great use for several biological studies, for forensics and even for the determination of the year in which certain wine was produced. = Biology = Biological studies carried out by Kirsty Spalding demonstrated that neuronal cells are essentially static and do not regenerate during life. She also showed that the number of fat cells is set during childhood and adolescence. Considering the amount of 14C present in DNA she could establish that 10% of fat cells are renewed annually. The radiocarbon bomb pulse has been used to validate otolith annuli (ages scored from otolith sections) across several fish species including the freshwater drum, lake sturgeon, pallid sturgeon, bigmouth buffalo, arctic salmonids, Pristipomoides filamentosus, several reef fishes, among numerous other validated freshwater and marine species. The precision for bomb radiocarbon age validation is typically within +/- 2 years because the rise period (1956-1960) is so steep. The bomb pulse has also been used to estimate (not validate) the age of Greenland sharks by measuring the incorporation of 14C in the eye lens during development. After having determined the age and measured the length of sharks born around the bomb pulse, it was possible to create a mathematical model in which length and age of the sharks were correlated in order to deduce the age of the larger sharks. The study showed that the Greenland shark, with an age of 392 +/- 120 years, is the oldest known vertebrate. = Forensics = At the moment of death, carbon uptake is ended. Considering that tissue that contained the bomb pulse 14C was rapidly diminishing with a rate of 4% per year, it has been possible to establish the time of death of two women in a court case by examining tissues with a rapid turnover. Another important application has been the identification of victims of the Southeast Asian tsunami 2004 by examining their teeth. = Carbon Transport Modeling = The perturbation in atmospheric 14C from the bomb testing was an opportunity to validate atmospheric transport models, and to study the movement of carbon between the atmosphere and oceanic or terrestial sinks. = Other = Atmospheric bomb 14C has been used to validate tree ring ages and to date recent trees that have no annual growth rings.

It was formed in mid-2015 during the Syrian Civil War with a specified purpose of fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in northwestern Syria. History =First units= Before the training program started, about 400 Syrian rebel fighters travelled to the border with Turkey hoping to join the program. Many of them failed to join the program. On May 7, 2015, US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said that nearly 90 fighters had begun their training, and a second group would begin training in the next few weeks. The vetted fighters were being trained to fight the ISIL rather than the Syrian Armed Forces. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan opened training sites for the program. On July 12, 2015, 54 fighters from the first graduates of the program, commanded by an ethnic Syrian Turkmen colonel who had defected from the Syrian army, crossed from Turkey to Syria in a convoy of 30 pickup trucks, according to Turkish news media. They would be able to call in US airstrikes against ISIL. Each fighter that graduated was given a M-16 rifle, $400 US dollars, and 400 Turkish liras. On July 28, 2015, leader Nadim al-Hassan and an unspecified number of companions were allegedly abducted by members of the al-Nusra Front while returning from a meeting in Azaz. In a public statement, the group called for their release. In August 2015, the first group of Division 30 rebels set up a headquarters in Syria, which was attacked and captured by the al-Nusra front, the al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria who kidnapped a number of their members. Later on, following the al-Nusra attack, Assad government warplanes bombed the headquarters causing most remaining members to flee to join other rebel groups. According to Syrian sources, the 75 fighters newly trained in a camp near the Turkish capital crossed through the Bab al- Salama border crossing and entered the Aleppo Governorate, heading to the town of Tell Rifaat, while others went to support the Mountain Hawks Brigade. The group entered in a convoy of a dozen cars with light weapons and ammunition, under air cover from the US-led coalition. =Second units= In September 2015, a second group of Division 30 rebels, consisting of 75 fighters with 12 Toyota pick-up trucks, medium machine guns and ammunition crossed the Syrian- Turkish border and was stopped and captured by the Levant Front. They ended up giving up much of their weaponry and ammunition to the al-Nusra Front in order to secure passage farther into Syria.Syrian rebel commander on why U.S. training program failed, CBS, 29-09-15 By the end of September 2015, General Lloyd Austin, head of US Central Command, said the remaining members of Division 30 were limited in number, \\"We're talking four or five\\". Division 30's current whereabouts are unknown after they allegedly stopped receiving funding and supplies from the U.S. On 17 November 2015, several members of Division 30 appeared in the announcement video of the Syrian Democratic Forces in the Aleppo and northern Idlib governorates alongside other members of the Army of Revolutionaries and the YPG. However, the Division 30 leadership denied the group as a whole joining the SDF. In December 2015, some fighters from the \\"New Syrian Forces\\" based in Mare' and trained by the US have joined the al-Mu'tasim Brigade, another FSA group in northern Aleppo trained and equipped by the US Department of Defense. In May 2016, al-Nusra Front released a statement claiming that they have released 7 Division 30 fighters while the commander and the rest of the group are still in custody.

In such a model, a union election is not held by the entire workforce to determine whether a majority wishes for the workforce to be represented by a local branch of a national union, but a union can nonetheless exist to support members who pay dues. While majority unions tend to possess and guard collective bargaining rights, minority-union members may be organized by the union to privately file group-presented grievances to management. The ability of such unions to meet on workplace grounds also relies upon the discretion of management. Advantages and disadvantages Members-only unionism allows members and organizers to operate under the radar of management, especially in regions rife with anti-union sentiment. It also allows for other activist and organizing models to be tried by a minority local union. A disadvantage of this model is that businesses may not recognize a minority union as a collective bargaining agent for employees who are members. Strikes and pickets are likely not possible for minority unions, meaning that answers to grievances filed by members rely entirely upon the discretion and timing of management. United States Marvit and Schriever wrote about the history of members-only unions in the United States, and how the model fell into near- obscurity after the passage of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The writers covered a number of examples of minority unions, including the Texas Workers Alliance (an independent local in San Antonio, Texas) and CAAMWU in Nash County, Tennessee. A more recent example of a minority union is UAW Local 42, which was formed in July 2014 at the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Despite a failed unionization vote at the plant, Volkswagen recognizes members who have joined the local, and has opted for a German-style works council which would include both union members and non- members.

She is an advocate of regional building standards and mutual recognition agreements for architects of the CARICOM alliance. Biography Courtenay was born in Sri Lanka and grew up Zambia, India, and the United Kingdom. She earned a degree in architecture from the Southern California Institute of Architecture in Los Angeles and then went on to obtain a Master's degree in Business Administration at the University of the West Indies Cave Hill Campus, Barbados. Courtenay is a registered architect in Belize who has designed more than 70 buildings. Predominantly her designs are residential, but she has designed several commercial spaces for both public and private use. Her largest project was the Fort Point Pedestrian Walk in Belize City. In 2007, Courtenay pressed for Belize to join in the Federation of Caribbean Association of Architects, in part to facilitate better cooperation among Caribbean architects. Varying standards among Caribbean nations make regional collaboration difficult and she has been an advocate of adopting a Mutual Recognition Agreement, which would acknowledge the qualification of CARICOM architects among all other member states. In 2009 Courtenay took part in an evaluation of Belize's Building Standards to prepare for meetings on designing and implementing regional building standards. In a historic selection, Courtenay was made the first female head of the Federation of Caribbean Association of Architects in 2012 and had hopes that she could continue to push forward regional collaboration. She has served on the board of the Association of Professional Architects of Belize in various capacities and in 2015 was serving as the Director of International Affairs.

Plot Alex is a quiet, unassuming schoolteacher whose students call him gay because he is unattached. His friend Paul is dating legal receptionist Claire, who has lawyer Eve for a friend. They contrive to have Alex and Eve meet, and from the start it is an uneven and quirky relationship. But they soon fall in love - and herein lies the problem.

Then we discover that Eve's family have arranged for her to marry a Lebanese from overseas. Paul is distraught and after yet another verbal stoush with his prejudiced father, he moves out of his home. Eve's brother, who at first opposed any relationship, now sees that Eve loves Alex. On the day Eve is to wed Mohammed her brother approaches Alex and demands to know if he loves Eve, upon discovering that Alex does in fact love Eve he tells Alex to go after her. Alex bundles his family into his car and confronts Eve at the wedding, after initially saying that she can't be with him she changes her mind as Alex is walking away.

She was instrumental in the formerly private Portland Library Association being opened to the public as what is now the Central Library in Portland. Biography Mary Isom was born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1865 to Dr. John Franklin Isom and Frances A. Isom. Her family was originally from Cleveland, and returned there after the Civil War. She went to Wellesley for one year, but her college was interrupted at the end of that year so she could return to Cleveland to care for her father. When her father died in 1899, she enrolled at the library program at Pratt Institute at the advice of her friend Josephine Rathbone, who was then a faculty member there. Isom received her degree there two years later. Shortly after she graduated, she was hired as a cataloger at the Library Association of Portland. The association had just received a gift from the philanthropist John Wilson of his entire collection of over 8,000 books, but it came with the stipulation that the collection must be made freely available to the public. The association needed a cataloger to help make these books accessible while they were making the final decisions on how their currently private association would go public. By 1902, Isom had taken over as the head librarian of the association and was overseeing its transformation from a subscription-based private library to a tax-funded public institution for all of Portland. One year later it had become the library for all of Multnomah County. This was in part due to Isom's lobbying of the Legislature to expand the law, as she did not feel that only city residents should be able to access libraries. In 1905, she drafted a bill to create the Oregon Library Commission, which became the Oregon State Library in 1913. She recruited Cornelia Marvin of the Wisconsin Free Library Commission to run the Oregon Library Commission, as she wished to model her state's commission on Wisconsin's. When the Central Library Building was constructed in 1912, Isom worked closely with the architect Albert E. Doyle to ensure that the building was efficient for its purpose as a library as well as picturesque. Isom was active within the American Library Association (ALA) as well, drawing it to hold its national conference in Portland in 1905. In 1917, she participated in Liberty Bond Drives and organized hospital and camp libraries in Oregon and Washington. However, a county commissioner rallied an attack against one of her librarians, M. Louise Hunt, for refusing to buy Liberty Bonds as it conflicted with her pacifist beliefs. Isom stood by her employee's right to practice her conscience but in the face of continuing criticism, the librarian wound up resigning. However, the Library Board did censure the county commissioner's behavior and attacks on both Mary Isom and the library, a courageous move considering that the county commission determined the library's tax rate. Upon her return to the U.S. in April 1919, she discovered that the recurring pain in her left arm was a sign of cancer that would shortly take her life. In her will, she bequeathed $5,000 to the Directors of the Library Association of Portland in order that her employees receive pensions. In addition, though she left her cottage Spindrift to her adopted daughter Berenice Langton, Langton offered the use of the cottage to the Library Association, later giving it to the association outright in 1935 to be used for the rest and recreation of library staff. A tablet of her is installed in the stairway at Central Library, and the organization's administration building is named for her.

The town was re-peopled and ruled by Chauhans around thirteenth century. At the start of the seventeenth century, the Palanpur State was taken over by Jhalori dynasty of Pashtun Lohani (Bihari, Pathan) tribe which was founded in 1373 and ruled from Jhalor. The dynasty came into historical prominence during the period of instability that followed the demise of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in the early 18th century. It was overrun soon afterwards by the Marathas; the Lohanis followed the trend of seeking recourse in the British East India Company against them and finally entered the subsidiary alliance system in 1817, along with all other neighbouring states, becoming a British protectorate governed by Palanpur Agency. After independence of India in 1947, Palanpur State was dissolved in 1949 and merged with India as a part of Bombay State. Subsequently, Palanpur became the capital of Banaskantha district of Gujarat. History =Early history= 400x400px Palanpur in early times is said to have been called Prahladan Patan or Prahaladanapura. The Jain texts mentions that Prahladana, brother of Paramara Dharavarsha of Abu, founded Prahladanapur in 1218 and built Prahladana-vihara dedicated to Pallaviya Parshwanatha. It was afterwards re-peopled by Palansi Chauhan from whom it took its modern name. Others say that it was founded by Pal Parmar whose brother Jagdev founded nearby Jagana village. It seems probable that, falling waste about the time of the conquest (1303) of Abu and Chandravati by the Devra Chauhans, it may have been re- peopled by Palansi. The local legends give the city a much higher antiquity, placing its re-founding under its present name as far back as the fifth century. The Chauhans seem to have held Palanpur and the country round till, about the middle of the fourteenth century, they were driven out by the southward progress of the Muslims. Mithi Vav, a stepwell built around 8th century, is the only surviving architecture of the time of Parmar dynasty. =Jhalori rule= Family Tree of Palanpur State rulers Jhalori dynasty According to tradition the dynasty ruling the Palanpur state was founded in 1373 and was ruled by the Jhalori dynasty of Lohani (Bihari, Pathan)Pashtun tribe. While the earlier history of the family is who established themselves in Bihar during the twelfth century and ruled there as governors, Suba. Malik Yusuf, the founder of the Palanpur house, left Bihar in 1370 and entered the service of Vishaldev of Mandore. Appointed Governor of Songad or Jhalor, he took control of that place in the confusion that followed the death of the Mandore ruler in 1373. He possibly has taken control from Viramdev, son of Vishaldev, or from Popanbai, the widow of Vishaldev. He was reputed to have wed the foster-sister of the Mughal emperor Akbar and received Palanpur and surrounding areas as dowry. Dying in 1395 (797 H.), after ruling for twenty-two years, Malik Yusuf was succeeded by his son Malik Hasan, who enlarged his kingdom and was recognized by the Emperor as the ruler of Jhalor. While the Tughlaq dynasty (1325 - 1403) lasted, the Jhaloris, though almost independent, were their vassals under the control of governor, Subedar, at Anhilwad Patan. After Timur's invasion (1399), the Delhi sovereigns were unable to control their distant provinces, and Jhaloris for a time became independent. But soon (1412), Muzaffar I of Gujarat Sultanate, asserted their sway, and the Jhalori house became their vassals, serving them with 7000 horses. After a reign of forty-five years Malik Hasan died in 1440 (19th Zilkaad 843 H.) leaving three sons, Malik Salar, Malik Usman, and Hetam Khan. Of these the eldest, Malik Salar, succeeded, and ruling for twenty-one years died in 1461 (865 H.). Malik Salar was succeeded by his brother Malik Usman, also called Malik Jabdal, a chief famous for his magnificence, who was converted to the Mahdavia sect to which the Jhaloris have since belonged. It is said that the founder of this sect, Muhammad Jaunpuri, stayed for four months at Jhalor, and that it occasion that Malik Jabdal was converted. After a reign of twenty two years Malik Usman was, in 1483 (888 H.) succeeded by his nephew Malik Budhan, son of Salar Khan. Some sources says he was succeeded by his brother Hetam Khan. Malik Budhan ruled for twenty two years and seven months, and, dying in 1505 (911 H.) was succeeded by his son Malik Mujahid Khan. Once, when hunting Malik Mujahid Khan was surprised and carried prisoner to Sirohi. He was treated with great kindness, given a palace to live in, and as much luxury as he choose. In revenge of his capture, Maliks Mina and Piara, the leader of his forces, ravaged the Sirohi districts, and one night making their way to the palace where Malik Mujahid was confined, found him enjoying the society of courtesans. He refused to leave the lady and the Maliks returned disappointed. Shortly after, the succeeded in capturing Kunvar Mandan, the heir to Sirohi, while he was sitting at night over a forest pool waiting for game. Threatening to make the Kunvar a Muslim, the Jhaloris so frightened the Rao of Sirohi, that he not only set Malik Mujahid free but ceded to him the district of Virgam. After ruling at Jhalor for five years Malik Mujahid died in 1509 (915 H.). While Mujahid was in captivity at Sirohi, Malik Hetam Khan ruled in Jhalor. After Mujahid Khan's death, Sultan Mahmud Begada entrusted the rule of Jhalor and Sachor to Shah Jiva, son of Balu Khan. Dying in 1512 (918 H.), he was succeeded by Malik Ali Sher, son of Budhan Khan Jhalori. During Malik Ali Sher's rule, the Rathods of Mandovar in Malwa advanced against Jhalor, forced their way close to the city, and were with difficulty driven back, after a three days fight. Dying in 1525 (931 H.), Ali Sher was followed by his son Malik Sikandar Khan, who, like his father, suffered from the attacks of his Hindu neighbours. In 1542 (949 H.), Rao Maldev of Jodhpur State besieged, took, and plundered Jhalor, and, in the next year (1543), took plundered Sachor. Dying in 1548 (955 H), Malik Sikandar was succeeded by Malik Ghazni Khan, son of Hetam Khan, who, during a reign of two years, restored the power of the Jhalori family, and was succeeded by Malik Khanji, a man of great bravery and of prodigious personal strength. In 1555 (962 H.), five years after the death of Ghazni Khan, Fateh Khan Baloch of Tervada and Radhanpur, one of the most powerful of the Gujarat nobles, marched against Jhalor. Maliks Khanji and Khuram Khan joined battle with the Baloch force before Jhalor. But, in spite of the greatest bravery on the part of its defenders, Jhalor was taken and Khuram Khan slain. For fifteen years Baloch held Jhalor. Then, 1570 (977 H.), Malik Khanji, gathering some followers, came against the city and won it back. Malik Khanji died in 1576 (984 H.). He left two sons Ghazni Khan and Firoz Khan, and a daughter named Tarabai. He was succeeded by Ghazni Khan, who, according to the Mirat-i-Ahmadi, served the state with 7000 horse. Attempting to raise north Gujarat on behalf of Sultan Muzaffar of Gujarat Sultanate, he was imprisoned by Akbar's order, but, afterwards submitting, was in 1589-90 reinstated at Jhalor. Seven years later (1597), according to the Palanpur records, Ghazni Khan driving back an invasion of the Afghan tribes, received the title of Diwan and the government of Lahore. Palanpur State Map of Palanpur State area in 1922 An aerial view of Jorawar Palace, 1936 During his rule Ghazni Khan's brother, Malik Firoz Khan took Palanpur and Deesa, establishing himself at Palanpur. Ghazni Khan, dying in 1614 (1023 H.), was succeeded by his son Pahar Khan, who, found guilty of matricide, was, in 1616, by the Emperor's orders, trampled to death by an elephant. After Pahar Khan came his uncle Malik Firoz Khan, also called Kamal Khan, a distinguished soldier, who, and his son Malik Mujahid Khan, greatly enlarged the family estate, and, it is said, obtained the title of Nawab. He constructed Mansarovar, a lake dedicated to his queen Manbai Jadeja in 1628. Under Mughal prince Murad Baksh, Mujahid Khan was, in 1654, appointed governor, faujdar, of Anhilwad Patan. Twenty years later (1674) his father Kamal Khan, who had been removed from the government of Palanpur, was restored to his former post. In 1697, Mujahid Khan was sent to levy the capitation tax from the Hindus of Palanpur and Jhalor, and, in 1699, the government of Jhalor and Sachor was taken from him and given to Ajitsing Rathod of Jodhpur ; Jhalor was never recovered, and from that time the headquarters of the family had been at Palanpur. Rajgadhi, the residence of queens, was built in 1697. Dying without male issue, Mujahid was succeeded by his brother Salim Khan, and he, in 1700, by his son Kamal Khan. Kamal Khan conducted the affairs of the chiefdom prosperously, and was succeeded in 1708 by his son Firoz Khan also called Ghazni Khan. About eight years later (1716) Ajitsing Rathod of Jodhpur was chosen Viceroy of Gujarat, and, as he passed from Jhalor to Ahmedabad, Firoz Khan went to meet him, and in return for an offer of service, received the Sirohi district of Dantavada. In the anarchy that prevailed about this time (1720), the Jhaloris turned their thoughts to gain independence. On the death of Firoz Khan (about 1722) his two sons Kamal Khan and Karimdad Khan struggled for the chiefship. Karimdad Khan won in the end and put his brother to death. During his viceroyalty of Gujarat, Karimdad accompanied Rathod Abhaysing, Maharaja of Jodhpur, in his expedition against Sirohi, and won Palanpur, Dhanera, Malana, Surbakri, Dabela, Roh, and Sarotra from Sirohi. Dying about 1730 he was succeeded by his son Pahar Khan, who ruled until about 1744, when he died without male issue. Mira Gate, the only surviving gate of city walls built by Bahadur Khan (1743 - 1768) During Pahar Khan's rule, in 1736, Kantaji Kadam and Malhar Rao Holkar made a sudden attack on north Gujarat and plundered Palanpur, when the chief agreed to pay a tribute of ¬£10,000 (Rs. 1,00,000). On Pahar Khan's death his uncle Bahadur Khan, son of Firoz Khan, succeeded and continued in the chiefship till 1768. In 1753 Bahadur Khan was forced by Patel Vithal Sakdev to agree to a yearly payment of ¬£1000 (Rs. 10,000), and five years later (1758), the Peshwa's deputy, Sadashiv Ramchandra, compelled him to pay a tribute of ¬£3500 (Rs. 35,000). In 1750 (Samvat 1806), Bahadur Khan built a brick and mortar city-wall, the Nagarkot of Palanpur. It was 3 miles round, 17 to 20 feet high and 6 feet broad with seven bastioned gateways,and, at the corners, round towers armed with guns. The gateways of the city-walls were Delhi Darwaja, Gathaman Darwaja, Malan Darwaja, Mira Darwaja, Virbai Darwaja, Salempura Darwaja, Sadarpur Darwaja or Shimla Darwaja. Only Mira Darwaja survives today. He was succeeded by his son Salim Khan. Bahadur Khan drove Chauhan Jetmalji of Dhema out of Tharad and held this estate until dispossessed by Nawab Kamal-ud-din Khan Babi, commonly known as Jawan Mard Khan II of Radhanpur State. Salim Khan ruled till 1781, when he died and was succeeded by his son Sher Khan, who killed his brothers fearing that they might compete with him for the chiefship. Sher Khan died without male issue in 1788 or 1791. He was probably poisoned by his sister. On his death his sister Sona Bubu, who had married into the Babi family, raised her son Mubariz Khan to the chiefship. The nobles displeased at her conduct, revolted and dethroning Mubariz Khan placed Shamsher Khan on the throne. Firoz Khan, son of Fateh Khan, the grandson of Firoz Khan, now preferred his claim, and, the old vassals rallying round him, gained the chiefship in 1794. The state was, in 1809, brought in contact with the British East India Company, when an agreement was entered into by the chief to pay the Gaekwad a yearly tribute of ¬£4375 (Babashai Rs. 50,001). For some years, the chief power had been in the hands of a faction of Sindhi Jamadars, who, in 1812, under the suspicion that he was about to reduce their power, murdered Firoz Khan, when out hunting. They offered the succession to his only son Fateh Khan, then thirteen years old. Fateh Khan, by the advice of his mother, refused the offer, and requested the British and Gaekwads for help and protection from his father's murderers. On this the Jamadars seized and imprisoned him, and raised his uncle Shamsher Khan, then chief of the districts of Deesa and Dhanera, to the chiefship. Map of the Palanpur Agency left British Captain Carnac, the Resident at Baroda State, with the British and Gaekwad forces under the command of General Holmes, proceeded to Palanpur. Fateh Khan and Samsher Khan both surrendered to the force and Jamadars fled the town. On 22 December 1813, Fateh Khan was invested with the chiefship of Palanpur, and Shamsher Khan, having no issue, adopted him, and, except a small provision for a son of his own should one be born, made him heir to all his possessions including Deesa and Dhanera. It was also arranged that Shamsher Khan should manage the state and give his daughter in marriage to Fateh Khan. The constant tussle between uncle and nephew resulted in the negotiation between two mediated by the British but later when the negotiations were left by both, British force led by Colonel Elrington attacked Palanpur on 10 October 1817. Shamsher Khan with the Palanpur troops attacked the force, and after a slight skirmish retreated inside the walls. The town was then assaulted and carried. Shamsher Khan and his followers retired to the hills taking Fateh Khan with them. Being pursued, Shamsher Khan took refuge in Nimaj (Neemuch), and Fateh Khan returned to Palanpur and accepted British suzerainty. He entered the subsidiary alliance system in 1817 becoming a British protectorate. Captain Miles was appointed as a British political agent under Palanpur Agency. In 1819, Shamsher Khan surrendered himself and was given nine villages for support. He died in 1834. Kirti Stambh, a tower constructed by Tale Muhammad Khan in 1918 commemorating the history of town and his dynasty. In 1822 Fateh Khan agreed to forbid the transport of contraband opium through his territory. In 1848 the appointment of the Gaekwad's agent was abolished, and, six years later (1854), Fateh Khan died leaving four sons, Zorawar Khan and Ahmad Khan by Shamsher Khan's daughter, and Usman Khan and Sikandar Khan by another wife. He was succeeded by Zorawar Khan who helped British in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He died on 28 August 1878 and was succeeded by his son Sher Muhammad Khan. In 1910, the title was upgraded to the title of Nawab Sahib. He attended the coronation ceremony of King George V in Delhi and built a club named after him in 1913. Sher Muhammad Khan died in 1918 and was succeeded by Tale Muhammad Khan. He constructed Kirti Stambh, a tower near railway station commemorating the gallantry of his father and the history of town and his dynasty, in 1918. He also built Balaram Palace between 1922 and 1936 and later Jorawar Palace also. In 1939, he also built Shashivan, formerly Jahanara Baug, a garden to commemorate his second marriage with Joan Falkiner, a daughter of an Australian businessman. He ruled until the independence of India in 1947. =Post independence= The Palanpur State was abolished in 1949 and merged with Bombay Presidency. It subsequently became the capital of Banaskantha district of Bombay State. When Bombay State was bifurcated on linguistic lines in 1960, the district became a part of Gujarat. In subsequent years, the town show rapid expansion in size and population. The commercial activities of town was fueled by retail cloth business and presence of its diaspora in textile and diamond industries. The Banas Dairy, a cooperative dairy organization, was established in 1969. Last ruler Tale Muhammad Khan died in 1957. As titular head of the dynasty, Tale Muhammad Khan was succeeded by Iqbal Muhammad Khan in 1957 followed by Muzaffar Muhammad Khan in 2010.

A., \\"The Nonidentity Problem\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/ Similarly something can be good only if it is good for someone. Therefore, according to standard person-affecting views, there is no moral obligation to create people nor moral good in creating people because nonexistence means \\"there is never a person who could have benefited from being created\\". Whether one accepts person-affecting views greatly influences to what extent shaping the far future is important (since there may be greatly more humans existing in the future than has ever existed). Person-affecting views are also important in considering human population control. A weaker form of person-affecting views states that an act can only be bad if it is bad for some existing or future person. Person-affecting views can be seen as a revision of total utilitarianism in which the \\"scope of the aggregation\\" is changed from all individuals who would exist to a subset of those individuals (though the details of this vary, see the section below). Some philosophers who have discussed person-affecting views include Derek Parfit, Jan Narveson, John Broome, Jeff McMahan, Larry Temkin, Tatjana Vi≈°ak, Gustaf Arrhenius, Johann Frick, Nick Beckstead, and Hilary Greaves. Variants There is no single \\"person-affecting view\\" but rather a variety of formulations all involving the idea of something being good or bad for someone. Retrieved 14 July 2020 * Gustaf Arrhenius formulates the \\"person-affecting restriction\\" as saying that moral claims \\"necessarily involve a reference to humans\\", so that statements only referencing \\"the scenery\\" or \\"the balance of the ecosystem\\" (without reference to humans) are excluded from moral consideration. * Nick Beckstead states that the person-affecting view claims the following: \\"When aggregating the interests of different people to determine the value of an outcome, the interests of 'extra' people count for less or can be ignored\\" (where \\"extra\\" can mean different things in different contexts, but in each case actions cannot be good or bad for \\"extra\\" people). Beckstead further distinguishes between moderate and strict person-affecting views, where moderate views give less weight to \\"extra\\" people (so that while creating new lives that are good is a good thing, this is inferior to improving already-existing lives) while strict views do not consider \\"extra\\" people at all. * There are also wide and narrow person-affecting views, as well as an asymmetric view (under which it is considered immoral to bring into this world lives that are not worth living, even though it is morally neutral to bring into this world lives that are worth living ‚Äì hence the asymmetry). The asymmetric view in particular can lead one to conclude that human extinction is good, according to Beckstead, but, according to Simon Knutsson, this can be the case for utilitarianism and consequentialism generally, not just asymmetric consequentialist theories, like negative utilitarianism and negative consequentialism.

Bryzhalin proposed the creation of a bird sanctuary on the shores of the Black Sea and the Azov Sea in 1919, following the example of American bird sanctuaries. On July 14, 1927, a resolution was adopted by the Council of People's Commissars No. 172 that created a nature reserve on the coasts of the Black Sea and the Azov Sea. The reserve included Churyuk Island in the bay of Syvash in the Azov Sea; Dzharylhach Island in the Black Sea; Solonoozerna dacha; and the Kinburns πka, Kryva, Bilosarays πka, and Obitochna Spits, and covered 32,000 hectares.

Kharkiv, 1928 The Ukrainian Committee for Natural Monuments Protection aimed for the creation of reserve administrations and special departments for protection; however, their attempts were unsuccessful. In 1928, gravel reserve areas were established, covering many sections of the sandy areas in the Lower Dnieper valley. In 1929, Coastal Reserve areas were discussed at all gatherings of the Bureau of Ukrainian Committee for Natural Monuments Protection; however these discussions did not lead to any action. By 1932, independent coastal reserves were incorporated into the Askania-Nova reserve. From January 1st, 1933, Askania-Nova was divided into two regions, the Black Sea State Reserve and the Azov-Syvash State Reserve, which today are known as the Black Sea Biosphere Reserve and the Azov-Syvash National Nature Park.  History of research  In 1927, scientist M. Sharleman led an expedition to study newly created coastal reserves on behalf of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. The first excursion took place between the June the 10th and June the 23rd, 1927. Present on the trip was A. K. Shepe, a freelance researcher of the Zoological Museum UAS. The second excursion took place later that year, between September the 3rd and September the 14th. Present on this trip was O. Y. U. Borzakovskyy, and research workers from the Chapli Reserve who had partaken in the previous excursion. These individuals were the Heads of the Department of the Scientific Zoological Station, O. O. Schumer and entomologist S. I. Medvedev. In his report of the expedition, Sharleman noted the urgent need to strengthen reserve protection and inform nearby villages about environmental protection. He also acknowledged the need for more detailed study of coastal reserves and the need for permanent research stations in reserve areas.Sharleman M.

With the exception of some college courses, his understanding of music theory was self-taught. Most of his education in music composition came from deconstructing the harmonies of his favorite vocal group, the Four Freshmen, whose repertoire included songs by George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and Cole Porter. Another major influence came from the Ronettes' 1963 song \\"Be My Baby\\". For the decades that followed, Wilson fixated on Phil Spector's Wall of Sound technique showcased in \\"Be My Baby\\" and similar records. Some of Wilson's stylistic markers include slash chords, key modulations, \\"stepwise falloffs\\", the use of minor seventh chords drawn from Burt Bacharach, piano triads \\"hammered\\" in eighths, and a tendency for his harmonic progressions to wander far from the tonal center. Only 21 years old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy, Wilson ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers, supplanting New York as the center of popular records, and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument. Education and virtuosity =Formative years= Wilson playing electric bass guitar with the Beach Boys in 1964 Brian Wilson was born the son of Murry Wilson, a songwriter and machine business owner. Speaking of Brian's unusual musical abilities prior to his first birthday, Murry said that, as a baby, Brian could repeat the melody from \\"When the Caissons Go Rolling Along\\" after only a few verses had been sung. Murry said, \\"He was very clever and quick. I just fell in love with him.\\" A few years later, he was discovered to have extremely diminished hearing in his right ear. The exact cause of this hearing loss is unclear, though theories range from him simply being born partially deaf to a blow to the head from his father, or a neighborhood bully, being to blame. Although he was often dubbed a perfectionist, Wilson was an inexperienced musician, and his understanding of music theory was self-taught. The first instrument he learned to play was a toy accordion before quickly moving to piano and then bass guitar. From an early age, Brian demonstrated an extraordinary skill for learning music by ear on keyboard. By age 10, Brian could play \\"great boogie-woogie piano\\", according to brother Carl Wilson. Carl taught Brian how to play bass guitar. Initially, he stroked the strings using only his thumb, but switched to using a pick about a year later. Brian's experiments with his Wollensak tape recorder provide early examples of his flair for exotica and unusual percussive patterns and arranging ideas that he would recycle in later prominent work. At some point in 1961 he wrote his first all-original melody, loosely based on a Dion and the Belmonts version of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\". The song was eventually known as \\"Surfer Girl\\". Though an early demo of the song was recorded in February 1962 at World Pacific Studios, it was not re-recorded and released until 1963, when it became a top-ten hit. Among the distinct elements of the Beach Boys' style were their voices' nasal quality and the use of falsetto in their harmonies over a run-on melody. Jim Miller observed, \\"On straight rockers they [the Beach Boys] sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead ... on ballads, Brian played his falsetto off against lush, jazz-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures.\\" Music theorist Daniel Harrison adds, \\"But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone.\\" Lyric collaborator Van Dyke Parks argued that, \\"Wilson made music as accessible as a cartoon and yet rewarded repeated listening as much as Bach: Just as the best comic books can turn clich√© into high art, so can the best pop music. Brian does that. He can take common or hackneyed material and raise it from a low place to the highest, and he can do it with an economy of imagery that speaks to the casual observer‚Äîbam! It's no coincidence that he was working at the same time that [Andy] Warhol and [Roy] Lichtenstein were doing pop art.\\" Wilson wrote in 1990: Before 1966, Brian's mastery of songwriting proved that he was capable of applying odd harmonic progressions, unexpected disruptions of hypermeter, jazz theory, tempo changes, metrical ambiguity, and unusual tone colors successfully within a pop context. He made on-the-spot decisions about notes, articulation, and timbre; composing at the mixing board and using the studio as a musical instrument. Through attending Phil Spector's sessions sporadically, Brian learned how to act as a producer for records while being educated on the Wall of Sound process. As his productions advanced, he became recognized for his pop artistry, vocal harmonization, incessant studio perfectionism, forward- thinking song structures, engineering and mixing know-how, and creative multitasking abilities. From then on, Brian received some production advice from Jan Berry. As they collaborated on several hit singles written and produced for other artists, they recorded what would later be regarded the California Sound. Author Irwin Chusid noted Wilson as an \\"ironic\\" example of outsider music for perhaps being one of its biggest-selling artists. He explains that Wilson's history of torment, substance abuse, and \\"loopy\\" material \\"certify\\" him as an outsider artist. =Orchestrations= It was unusual among rock groups that Brian wrote his own arrangements. This included his own string orchestrations, which lyric collaborator Tony Asher referred to for their odd voicings and classical style. He was surprised to learn of Brian's arranging ability, recalling Brian's \\"economic\\" use of a relatively low number of players: \\"Because if you've got 40 strings, somebody'll be playing the right notes. But when you've only got 4 or 5 or a small number of voices, everything's audible, and there's nothing to distract people's ear from what you're writing.\\" Session bassist Carol Kaye noted, \\"We had to create [instrumental] parts for all the other groups we cut for, but not Brian. We were in awe of Brian.\\" She added: \\"He took bass up another step. He saw it as integral in a symphonic orchestra. He used bass as the framework for a hit record. Very few people can write for bass, but his writing was beautiful. There are a lot of jazz musicians who admire him for it.\\" Sometimes he wrote charts that had melodic lines in different keys at the same time, which confused session musicians. \\"Here Today\\" was declared by AllMusic's Donald Guarisco to be one of Wilson's most ambitious arrangements that \\"perfectly blends the complexity of an orchestral piece with the immediacy of a good pop tune\\". Friend Danny Hutton highlighted Brian's studio proficiency, citing what he believed to be an extraordinary talent at harnessing several different studio spaces while piecing together discrete instrumental patterns and timbres cohesively. He noted, \\"Somebody could go in right after Brian's session and try to record, and they could never get the sound he got. There was a lot of subtle stuff he did. ... People don't talk that much about it. They always talk about his music. He was fabulous in the studio, in terms of getting sounds. You'd sit there, and that was him. He was just hands-on. He would change the reverb and the echo, and all of a sudden, something just ‚Äì whoa! ‚Äì got twice as big and fat.\\" =Singing= In 2013, Wilson explained: \\"I first felt I had a good voice when I was about seventeen or eighteen and was able to sing along well to records by the Four Freshmen. By singing along to those records that's how I learned how to sing falsetto. I would sing along to songs like 'I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,' 'I'll Remember April' and 'Day by Day'.\\" He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen, which he considered a \\"groovy sectional sound\\". He added, \\"The harmonies that we [the Beach Boys] are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records ‚Äì some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song ‚Äì and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake.\\" For a period, Wilson avoided singing falsetto for the group, saying, \\"I thought people thought I was a fairy. ... The band told me, 'If that's the way you sing, don't worry about it.'\\" In 1966, Wilson said that the highest note he could sing was D5. Starting with the 1970 sessions for the Surf's Up album, engineer Stephen Desper remembers the emerging corrosive effects of Wilson's incessant chain smoking and cocaine use: \\"He could still do falsettos and stuff, but he'd need Carl to help him. Either that or I'd modify the tape speed-wise to make it artificially higher, so it sounded like the old days.\\" Musical influences In 2015, writer Richard Goldstein related his impression of Wilson based on a meeting in 1967: The influence of the Beach Boys' peers combined with Brian's competitive nature drove him to reach higher creative peaks. He has said, \\"It isn't easy for me. So many things have scared me in my life ‚Äì I've got fears, lots of stuff. I mean, boy, just all the records that have scared me. So many records just rocked my world, man. It's heavy.\\" He named \\"What a Fool Believes\\" (1978) as a song he considers a \\"scary record\\" and once believed that Procol Harum's \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" (1967) was his funeral march. In 1986, Brian told David Toop: \\"I listened to a lot of orchestral music. I learned a lot of tricks too. Nelson Riddle taught me a lot about arranging.\\" Alice Cooper reported that Wilson once considered the traditional standard \\"Shortnin' Bread\\" to be the greatest song ever written, as he quotes Wilson for an explanation: \\"I don't know, it's just the best song ever written.\\" On classical music, Wilson stated in 2015 that he doesn't listen to it. Of soul music, Brian has cited Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder as influences. Regarding surf rock pioneer Dick Dale, Brian clarified that his influence on the group was limited to Carl and his style of guitar playing. In 1965, Brian added that he disdained surfing music. On Jimi Hendrix and \\"heavy\\" music, Wilson said he felt no pressure to go in that direction: \\"We never got into the heavy musical level trip. We never needed to. It's already been done.\\" Of punk rock, he said: \\"I never went for that.\\" When asked for his opinion on artists influenced by him, Wilson responded that he had no knowledge of Kraftwerk, Apples in Stereo, the Shins, Animal Collective, or Elephant 6. , Wilson maintains that he doesn't listen to modern music, only \\"oldies but goodies\\". =Early influences= One of Wilson's earliest memories was hearing Glenn Miller's 1943 recording of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue (1924), later citing it as a pivotal influence in his development as a composer. He recalled: \\"Around our house, when I was a child, I heard things from my parents' record collection like Les Paul and Mary Ford, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Rosemary Clooney, and the Four Freshmen. Those were my first inspirations. To try to describe exactly what each influence was is hard to explain because it's very subtle, but it can be felt when you listen to my music. I don't think people realize just how much Rosemary Clooney affected my singing. She taught me to sing with love in my heart ... I would sing along with it [\\"Hey There\\"], studying her phrasing, and that's how I learned to sing with feeling.\\" John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful noted, \\"Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea. We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like the Crew Cuts. Look what gold he mined out of that.\\" Carl speculated that it was Mike Love who got Brian into doo-wop music. Performed by the Four Freshmen, \\"Their Hearts Were Full of Spring\\" (1961) was a particular favorite of the Beach Boys. Brian explained: \\"My mom turned me on to them. She turned on the radio and goes, 'Hear that song? This is called 'Day By Day' by the Four Freshmen.' And I listened and I went 'Oh, I love it, Mommy! I love it!' ... We went in [the record shop] and she said you can take records into these little booths and play them to see if you wanted to buy them. ... You know how you sit in a sauna bath and the sweat will come out? That's what that whole experience in that room started to be. I purged all kinds of bullshit and picked up the Freshmen. It was magic. Total magic.\\" By deconstructing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Lambert notes, \\"If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song.\\" Wilson continued: \\"I learned them bar by bar. I'd go to my hi-fi set and I'd play a little bit. Then I'd stop and try to figure it out, back and forth, back and forth, until I figured the whole song out.\\" =Phil Spector= Spector (center) at Gold Star Studios with Modern Folk Quartet in 1965 The work of record producer Phil Spector, who popularized the Wall of Sound, was a focal obsession for Wilson. Spector inspired Wilson to produce a variety of artists outside the Beach Boys, such as Jan and Dean, Rachel and the Revolvers, and the Honeys. He also used the same Hollywood studios, session musicians, and engineers as Spector. In a 1966 article, he referred to him as \\"the single most influential producer. He's timeless. He makes a milestone whenever he goes into the studio.\\" Later, he reflected: \\"I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song.\\" He explains: \\"Before Spector, people recorded all the instruments separately. They got great piano, great guitar, and great bass. But he thought of the song as one giant instrument. It was huge. Size was so important to him, how big everything sounded. And he had the best drums I ever heard.\\" In 1999, when asked if he was a religious man, Wilson responded: \\"I believe in Phil Spector.\\" \\"Be My Baby\\" Wilson's creative and songwriting interests were revamped upon hearing the Ronettes' 1963 song \\"Be My Baby\\". \\"Be My Baby\\" is considered the epitome of Spector's Wall of Sound, a recording method that fascinated Wilson for the next several decades. The first time he heard the song was while driving, and he became so overwhelmed that he had to pull over to the side of the road and analyze the chorus. He bought the record and kept it on his living room jukebox, listening to it whenever the mood struck him. Copies of the song were located everywhere inside his home, as well as inside his car and in the studio. Author Luis Sanchez summarizes: For \\"I Do\\" (1964), co-written and produced by Wilson for the Castells, Lambert notes that the intro is \\"directly inspired by the instrumental accumulation in 'Be My Baby' and in the earlier Spector production of the Crystals' 'Oh Yeah Maybe Baby' (1961), which have similar rhythms and instrumental combinations.\\" Additionally, the influence of Spector can \\"easily\\" be heard in Wilson's \\"He's a Doll\\" and \\"The One You Can't Have\\", both written and produced by Wilson for the girl group the Honeys. In \\"He's a Doll\\", Lambert notices that \\"Brian was not just enamored with the Spector 'sound' but also with the way Spector creates musical interrelationships through [a] kind of internal repetition\\". Wilson was also \\"recycling ideas with remarkable frequency, but he was also stretching his creative muscles by challenging himself to create diverse contexts for similar resources.\\" After experiencing a nervous breakdown in December 1964, Wilson endeavored to \\"take the things I learned from Phil Spector and use more instruments whenever I could. I doubled up on basses and tripled up on keyboards, which made everything sound bigger and deeper.\\" He used similar recording techniques as Spector, especially during the Pet Sounds era. Author Domenic Priore observed, \\"The Ronettes had sung a dynamic version of The Students' 1961 hit 'I'm So Young', and Wilson went right for it, but took the Wall of Sound in a different direction. Where Phil would go for total effect by bringing the music to the edge of cacophony ‚Äì and therefore rocking to the tenth power ‚Äì Brian seemed to prefer audio clarity. His production method was to spread out the sound and arrangement, giving the music a more lush, comfortable feel. Music journo David Dalton said that Wilson analyzed \\"Be My Baby\\" \\"like an adept memorizing the Koran.\\" In July 1967, Dalton visited Wilson at his home, later writing about a box of tapes he discovered in Wilson's bedroom: \\"I assumed they were studio demos or reference tracks and threw one on the tape machine. It was the strangest thing ... All the tapes were of Brian talking into a tape recorder. Hour after hour of stoned ramblings on the meaning of life, color vibrations, fate, death, vegetarianism and Phil Spector.\\" At one point in the 1970s, Wilson instructed Stephen Desper to create a tape loop consisting only of the chorus of \\"Be My Baby\\", listening to it for several hours in what Desper saw as \\"some kind of a trance.\\" His daughter Carnie Wilson stated that during her childhood: \\"I woke up every morning to boom boom-boom pow! Boom boom-boom pow! Every day.\\" Another time, Wilson recalls playing the song's drum intro \\"ten times until everyone in the room told me to stop, and then I played it ten more times.\\" Mike Love remembers him comparing the song to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Interplay between Spector and Wilson Most accounts suggest that Spector did not share the same admiration for Wilson's music. He was aware of Wilson's obsession with \\"Be My Baby\\" and remarked that he would \\"like to have a nickel for every joint [Wilson] smoked\\" trying to figure out the record's sound. Wilson unsuccessfully attempted to submit two of his compositions to the producer: \\"Don't Worry Baby\\" and \\"Don't Hurt My Little Sister\\"; both written with the Ronettes in mind. After Spector's \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\\" became a number one hit for the Righteous Brothers in early 1965, Wilson personally phoned songwriters Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil to praise it as \\"the greatest record ever\\". He later recorded multiple (at least two) versions of the song: one in the 1970s and another in the 1990s. Harry Nilsson wrote \\"This Could Be the Night\\" (1966) as a tribute to Wilson, with production helmed by Spector. Modern Folk Quartet's Henry Diltz recalled Wilson at the studio during the sessions: \\"we could see him in the recording booth, in his robe and slippers, sitting there playing our song over and over, for what seemed like hours\\". Wilson deemed it one of Nilsson's very best compositions and one of Spector's best productions, explaining \\"Well, the idea they've been dating and waiting and finally they made love ... I love that message.\\" Wilson also attended the session for the Spector-produced \\"River Deep ‚Äì Mountain High\\" (1966), where he sat \\"transfixed\\" and \\"did not say a word\\". In 1977, Wilson wrote a 1950s style love song, \\"Mona\\", which features the lyric: \\"Come on, listen to 'Da Doo Ron Ron' now, I know you're gonna love Phil Spector\\". =Burt Bacharach= Burt Bacharach in 1972 Wilson has cited Burt Bacharach as his favorite songwriter. Author William Farina, who calls the two \\"direct competitors\\", says that Wilson's compliment is \\"especially self-evident when examining Wilson's more serious and introspective musical forays in the mid-1960s\\". Musicologist Christian Matijas-Mecca noted that Bacharach is \\"often-overlooked [in his] influence upon Brian's work.\\" Priore wrote that, in a \\"subtle\\" way, Wilson grew to appreciate the potential of what a pop song could do after being partly spurred on by the dynamics of Bacharach's \\"Walk On By\\" (1964), a song that became as influential to him as \\"Be My Baby\\", supporting his strive to achieve a sense of dynamics in his recordings while he began pulling away from a purely Spector-inspired approach to production. Wilson said in the 1960s: \\"Burt Bacharach and Hal David are more like me. They're also the best pop team ‚Äì per se ‚Äì today. As a producer, Bacharach has a very fresh, new approach.\\" With production by Wilson, the Beach Boys covered Bacharach's \\"My Little Red Book\\" and \\"Walk On By\\" in 1967 and 1968 but left the recordings unreleased. Wilson has said that Bacharach was a direct influence on his \\"She Knows Me Too Well\\", \\"Let's Go Away for Awhile\\", and \\"Love and Mercy\\". Writers have variously attributed Bacharach influence on Wilson's \\"Guess I'm Dumb\\", \\"Let Him Run Wild, and \\"The Little Girl I Once Knew\\". Discussing \\"Let's Go Away\\", Wilson said: \\"there were a lot of chord changes similar to the way he would put something together. And I think that his music had such a profound thing on my head; he got me going in a direction.\\" He mentions minor seventh chords as a specific point of influence. Like many Bacharach compositions, \\"Let Him Run Wild\\" opens with an off-tonic minor seventh chord. Similar examples in Bacharach's work include \\"Walk On By\\", \\"Wives and Lovers\\" (1963), and \\"Anyone Who Had a Heart\\" (1963). =The Beatles= The Beatles working with George Martin in a studio, 1964 The Beach Boys and the Beatles are often said to have directly reciprocated each other's musical developments during the 1960s. The two bands inspired each other with their artistry and recording techniques, pushing them further out in the studio. Author David Moskowitz identifies \\"I Get Around\\" (May 1964) as representing both a successful response by Wilson to the British Invasion, and the beginning of an unofficial rivalry between him and the Beatles, principally Paul McCartney. In 2002, Wilson recalled that, particularly over 1964‚Äì65, each new Beatles release pushed him \\"to try something new\\" in his work; he cited \\"Girl Don't Tell Me\\" as the most obvious example of his songwriting being directly influenced by the Beatles. After first hearing Rubber Soul in December 1965, Wilson was \\"blown away\\" by the Beatles' ability to create an album of consistently good original songs and resolved to top this achievement when making Pet Sounds. In turn, Beatles producer George Martin said, \\"No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian.\\" Wilson has said: \\"The Beatles inspired me. They didn't influence me.\\" While he was enamored with Rubber Soul, he explained: \\"I liked the way it all went together, the way it was all one thing. It was a challenge to me ... It didn't make me want to copy them but to be as good as them. I didn't want to do the same kind of music, but on the same level.\\" Carl elaborated: \\"[Phil Spector] was Brian's favorite kind of rock; he liked [him] better than the early Beatles stuff. He loved the Beatles' later music when they evolved and started making intelligent, masterful music, but before that Phil was it.\\" According to Mike Love, Carl followed the Beatles more closely than anyone else in the group, but Brian was the most \\"rattled\\" by the Beatles, feeling tremendous pressure to \\"keep pace\\" with them. Brian once characterized himself as \\"fucked up\\" and \\"jealous\\" of Spector and the Beatles, saying; \\"i was flipping out. I couldn't understand how [the Beatles] could be just yelled and screamed at. The music they made, 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' for example, wasn't even that great a record, but they just screamed at it.\\" On another occasion, he's said that he was overwhelmed by the \\"electricity\\" of their voices on the song (\\"It really turned me on\\"). He recalled that he and Love immediately felt threatened by the Beatles and added that he knew the Beach Boys could never match the excitement created by the Beatles as performers, and that this realization led him to concentrate his efforts on trying to outdo them in the recording studio. Brian identified the main difference between his music approach to the Beatles' is that they simplify songs to their \\"skeletal form,\\" whereas he would be \\"impelled to make [them] more complex,\\" and that if he had arranged \\"Norwegian Wood\\", he would have \\"orchestrated it, put in background voices, [and] done a thousand things.\\" On the subject of the Beatles' Revolver (1966), Love responded: \\"No, I don't think he was influenced by Revolver. Brian was in his own world, believe me. If he were influenced by the Beatles, there'd be more fuzz tone and a few sitars on our records, but there never have been, really.\\" Wilson praised McCartney's bass playing, calling it \\"technically fantastic, but his harmonies and the psychological thing he brings to the music comes through. Psychologically he is really strong ... The other thing that I could never get was how versatile he was. . ... we would spend ages trying to work out where he got all those different types of songs from.\\" In 2014, Brian stated that he thought \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" was \\"a weird record ... I liked it\\", although he denied rumors which said that the song had crippled him emotionally. In 2015, he highlighted \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" as a favorite. He views \\"Let It Be\\" as an intensely comforting song, likening it to valium. Non-musical influences =Drugs and spiritual beliefs= In December 1964, Brian was introduced to marijuana before quickly progressing to LSD in early 1965. He names \\"Please Let Me Wonder\\" as the first song he wrote on pot, with \\"She Knows Me Too Well\\" and \\"Let Him Run Wild\\" following soon after. Of his first acid trip, he recalls that LSD had subjected him to \\"a very religious experience\\" which enlightened him to indescribable philosophies. The music for \\"California Girls\\" came from this first LSD experience, as did much of the group's subsequent work where they would partake in drug use during recording sessions. Wilson spoke of his LSD trips as a \\"religious experience\\", and during a session for his a cappella hymn \\"Our Prayer\\", Brian can be heard asking the other Beach Boys: \\"Do you guys feel any acid yet?\\" In 1993, Wilson testified in a legal deposition that by 1965, he was consuming three or four marijuana cigarettes and one LSD pill a day. He believes after he dropped LSD: \\"It expanded my mind a little bit, so I could write better songs ... [While] it was worth it, I wouldn't take it again.\\" After being asked in a 1988 interview about whether his music is or was religiously influenced, Brian referred to the 1962-published A Toehold on Zen, and said that he believed that he possessed what is called a \\"toehold\\", defined metaphorically as \\"any small step which allows one to move toward a greater goal\\". He elaborated: \\"I learned from that book and from people who had a toehold on ... say somebody had a grasp on life, a good grasp‚Äîthey ought to be able to transfer that over to another thing.\\" During the recording of Pet Sounds, Brian held prayer meetings, later reflecting that \\"God was with us the whole time we were doing [the] album ... I could feel that feeling in my brain.\\" In 1966, he explained that he wanted to move into a white spiritual sound, and predicted that the rest of the music industry would follow suit. Wilson elaborated that while he had spiritual beliefs, he did not follow any particular religion. In 1990, he wrote that he believed \\"music is God's voice\\". =Mental illness= Wilson is afflicted with schizoaffective disorder that presents itself in the form of disembodied voices (auditory hallucinations). The illness emerged a week after his first LSD consumption. It formed a major component of Bill Pohlad's Love & Mercy (2014), a biographical film which depicts Wilson's hallucinations as a source of musical inspiration, constructing songs that were partly designed to converse with them. Wilson has said of the voices: \\"Mostly [they're] derogatory. Some of it's cheerful. Most of it isn't.\\" He added that his hallucinations will inspire a song \\"every now and then\\". In 2002, Wilson felt that his successful treatment initiated a writer's block: \\"I haven't been able to write anything for three years. I think I need the demons to write, but the demons have gone. It bothers me a lot. I've tried and tried, but I just can't seem to find a melody.\\" Compositional methods =Songwriting= Writing process In 1966, Wilson elaborated that his writing process involved going to the piano and finding \\"feels,\\" which he described as \\"brief note sequences, fragments of ideas,\\" and that \\"once they're out of my head and into the open air, I can see them and touch them firmly. They're not 'feels' anymore.\\" Mike Love remembered: \\"Brian is so spontaneous that if there's a piano and two or three people around to sing parts, he'll sit down and write a song in five minutes. But if you don't get it right then, he goes off and drops it.\\" According to Van Dyke Parks, Wilson was unique in the way he approached piano by \\"hammering\\" eighth-note triad chords. On the subject of Wilson's Bedroom Tapes, Beach Boys archivist Alan Boyd observed: \\"A lot of the music that Brian was creating during this period was full of syncopated exercises and counterpoints piled on top of jittery eighth-note clusters and loping shuffle grooves. You get hints of it earlier in things like the tags to 'California Girls,' 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' and all throughout Smile, but it takes on an almost manic edge in the '70s.\\" Form and structure A visual representation of the chord progression and melodic structure for the first verse and chorus of \\"God Only Knows\\". Most of his chord progressions stem from at least one of his main music influences: rock and roll, doo-wop, and vocal jazz. Commons devices in Wilson's compositions include: * Jazz chords such as the seventh and ninth. Lambert comments that while the \\"overall style\\" of songs like \\"We'll Run Away\\" (1964), \\"When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)\\" (1965), \\"Let Him Run Wild\\", and \\"Please Let Me Wonder\\" is \\"consistent with popular norms\\", the infusion of such chords \\"add sophistication and artistry.\\" Collaborator Andy Paley said: \\"When I was a kid listening to Beach Boys records, I used to go nuts trying to figure out what the hell was going on. It sounded so easy, but you'd get to a spot where it was, Jesus, is that a major chord or a minor chord? Now that I'm in the studio with Brian, I know that sometimes he's playing both. He'll do things that sound like they're going to be terribly dissonant, but when it's all put together, It's beautiful. It's actually a great sort of philosophy.\\" * Ambiguous tonal centers, with key changes within verse and choruses as well as \\"truck driver's modulations\\". Sound engineer Eugene Gearty refers to \\"God Only Knows\\" as a perfect example of \\"how much [Brian] modulated from key to key. He was far more complex than the Beatles and mostly like [Igor] Stravinsky in orchestral music where the key changes and key centers change four or five times within a pop tune, which is unheard of.\\" On Pet Sounds and other work, author Jim Fussili observed a repeated nuance of Wilson's to \\"wander far from the logic of his composition only to return triumphantly to confirm the emotional intent of his work\\". Tony Asher remembered: \\"one of the things that I really enjoyed, was that first time I'd hear him hunting for a chord change and I'd think 'Man, he's just gone right off the edge because he's not ever gonna get close. He's way out there in some area that's just‚Äîhe'll never get back. And if he's successful, gets out of there, people are going to say, I've lost my tone center, don't know where the hell I am and stuff. And then, eventually, he'd figure out what it was he wanted to do. A lot of it was just hunting and pecking, the way some of us type.\\" *ii ‚Äì V and I ‚Äì VII alternations. The VII chord, which is common in the music of the Four Freshmen and popular music in general, is the nondiatonic chord that appears the most in Wilson's compositions. Alternations between VII and I can be heard in \\"Guess I'm Dumb\\" and the intro to \\"California Girls\\". * Stepwise diatonic rises such as I ‚Äì iii ‚Äì IV ‚Äì V. * A circle of fifths run that begins with the mediant (or iii), derived from \\"Be My Baby\\". *Chord inversions, especially a tonic with a fifth in the bass. Paul McCartney commented on Wilson's bass lines: \\"If you were in the key of C, you would normally use‚Äìthe root note would be, like, a C on the bass ... Brian would be using notes that weren't the obvious notes to use. As I say, 'the G if you're in C‚Äìthat kind of thing. And [he] also [put] melodies in the bass line.\\" * Stepwise-falling melodic lines. As James Perone writes of the second track from Pet Sounds, \\"You Still Believe in Me\\", \\"One of the high points of the composition and Brian's vocal performance ... is the snaky, though generally descending melodic line on the line 'I want to cry,' his response to the realization that his girlfriend still believes in him despite his past failures.\\" He describes the \\"stepwise falloff of the interval of a third at the end of each verse\\" to be a typically \\"Wilsonian\\" feature. The feature recurs alongside a \\"madrigal sigh motif\\" in \\"That's Not Me\\", where the motif concludes each line of the verses. This sighing motif then appears in the next track, \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\\", a piece inspired by classical music, and once again in the closing \\"Caroline, No\\". * Sudden breaks into a cappella ‚Äì another technique borrowed from the Four Freshmen that Lambert calls the \\"interrupting celestial choir\\". It occurs in \\"Salt Lake City\\" (1965) and \\"Sloop John B\\" (1966). Lyricism In most cases, Wilson was forced to rely on outside collaborators when it came to adding lyricism to his compositions. At this stage, Wilson usually worked with bandmate Mike Love, whose assertive persona provided youthful swagger that contrasted Wilson's explorations in romanticism and sensitivity. Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band's circle, in the examples \\"Lonely Sea\\" and \\"In My Room\\". Wilson has said that he had \\"never been the type\\" to preach social messages in his songs. In early 1964, Wilson began his breakaway from beach-themed music. The album The Beach Boys Today! (1965) established Wilson's new lyrical approach toward the autobiographical. Nick Kent writes: \\"In songs like 'She Knows Me Too Well' and 'In the Back of My Mind', Wilson's dream lovers were suddenly no longer simple happy souls harmonizing their sun-kissed innocence and dying devotion to each other over a honey-coated backdrop of surf and sand. Instead, they'd become highly vulnerable, slightly neurotic and riddled with telling insecurities.\\" =Recording and arranging= Production Wilson works out \\"about a third\\" of the finished arrangement of a song as he's writing it, leaving the rest to studio experimentation. As he writes in 1990: \\"Making an instrumental track is a whole experience. It starts after you have written a song. As I write a song, I write some of the instrumental piano and pluck some of the different notes for the arrangement. It's impossible to lay the whole arrangement on the piano but you play just enough to get the overall feelin' of the record. It is an art in itself. I always get that bigger picture of my records at my piano before I record them. I go in there prepared.\\" From the very beginning, Wilson handled most stages of the group's recording process, despite Nik Venet being credited for producing their early recordings. He preferred mixing live as performances were recorded, as opposed to mixing after the fact. He was open to changes suggested by others while recording, often taking advice and even incorporating apparent mistakes if they provided a useful or interesting alternative. On Surfin' U.S.A. (1963), Brian began doubletracking. As was practiced by other record producers from the 1960s, most of his mixes ended up in single-channel monaural, believing that varied stereo speaker placement took his control over the sound image away to the listener. Using major Hollywood recording studios, Wilson arranged many of his compositions for a conglomerate of session musicians informally known as the Wrecking Crew. Their assistance was needed because of the increasingly complicated nature of the material. Wilson said that he \\"was sort of a square\\" with the Wrecking Crew, starting his creative process with how each instrument sounded one-by-one, moving from keyboards, drums, then violins if they were not overdubbed. Although he had arrangements worked out in his head, they were usually written in a shorthand form for the other players by one of his session musicians. On notation and arranging, Wilson clarified: \\"Sometimes I'd just write out a chord sheet and that would be for piano, organ, or harpsichord or anything. ... I wrote out all the horn charts separate from the keyboards. I wrote one basic keyboard chart, violins, horns, and basses, and percussion.\\" One of Wilson's favorite techniques was to apply reverb exclusively to a timpani, as can be heard in \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", \\"You Still Believe in Me\\", and \\"Don't Talk\\". \\"I Get Around\\" chorus vocals Once an instrumental track was completed, vocals would then be overdubbed by the group. Carl said about the Beach Boys' vocal arrangements: \\"Our vocals were voiced like horn parts, the way those R&B; records make background vocals sound like a sax section. It sounded big, because the four parts were all within the same octave; that was really the secret. He used a lot of counterpoint, a lot of layered sound; it had a real depth to it. We didn't just duplicate parts; we didn't just sing at octaves; that would sound really lame, very square.\\" Studios and engineers Now known as EastWest Studios, this building on Sunset Boulevard was formerly known as Western Studio when it was part of United Western Recorders and was one of Brian's preferred studios. Eschewing Capitol Studios, which Brian considered inadequate, engineer Chuck Britz often collaborated with him at Western 3 of United Western Recorders, also serving as a buffer between Brian and the oft- berating Murry whenever he was present. Once Britz assembled a preliminary recording setup, Brian would take over the console, directing the instrumentalists from the booth using an intercom or verbal gestures after supplying them with chord charts that were sometimes written incorrectly. According to some reports, even though Britz was responsible for setting up recording, Brian would then adjust his configuration to a large extent. Asher adds: \\"As unorganized or even unproductive as he [Brian] could be in other situations, when he got into a recording session, you had the sense he had ideas that were gonna get away from him if he didn't get 'em done right away. He was willing to have people be relaxed and joke a little bit, but he wanted to get work done. And he sometimes lost his temper just a little bit if Chuck couldn't find a take.\\" At Gold Star Studios, Brian worked mainly with engineers Stan Ross and, with lesser frequency, Larry Levine. Ross said of Brian, \\"[he] liked the sound Gold Star got on the instrumentation, but he did the voices elsewhere because we were limited to two or three tracks and that wasn't enough for voice overdubbing. ... The tracks were really rhythm pads that would be sweetened after the voices were put on.\\" Notes References Bibliography               * Further reading  Category:Brian Wilson Category:The Beach Boys music Wilson, Brian ","title":"Musicianship of Brian Wilson"},{"id":"48350134","text":"Bill Hudson is a Brazilian-American heavy metal guitarist, currently serving as the main composer, lead guitarist and founder for power metal supergroup NorthTale. He worked with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra as well German heavy metal bands U.D.O. and Dirkschneider, both fronted by former Accept vocalist Udo Dirkschneider and American death metal band I Am Morbid, featuring former Morbid Angel frontman David Vincent and drummer Tim Yeung to name a few. Born and raised in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, he moved to the United States in 2005 in order to join the power metal band Cellador, playing on their debut album Enter Deception and remaining in their line-up until early 2008. He has since gone on to perform and record with several artists, including the Trans- Siberian Orchestra, Savatage, U.D.O, Jon Oliva's Pain, Circle II Circle, Vital Remains, Nightrage and Power Quest. Currently, he is the lead guitarist in I Am Morbid, the new band of former Morbid Angel members David Vincent and Tim Yeung. In 2017 he started his own band, NorthTale and signed a record deal with Nuclear Blast Records.  Early life and education  Hudson started playing guitar at the age of twelve. He was mainly influenced by Slash. His first teacher was Angra guitarist Kiko Loureiro, who is currently a member of Megadeth. After finishing high school, he attended the FAAM music college in his native Brazil, in pursuit of a classical composition degree. A few years later, he attended the Musicians Institute in Hollywood, CA and has been mentioned among the success stories on their website several times. Playing career His first work of note was for a studio project called The Supremacy. The project featured well-known European musicians, such as drummer Mark Cross (ex-Firewind and ex-Helloween), as well as keyboard player Joost Van den Broek, of After Forever, Ayreon, Star One, among others. This project has not done much other than the recording of two songs in 2004. In 2005, Hudson auditioned for German power metal band Freedom Call, after being referred by longtime friend Cede Dupont, who had just quit said band. However, his \\"big\\" break did not come until later that year, when he auditioned for and joined the American power metal band Cellador, on Metal Blade Records. Between 2006 and 2008 he remained in Cellador's lineup as a lead guitarist, traveling through all of the US and Canada both headlining and supporting acts such as Bullet For My Valentine, All That Remains and Trivium. Hudson was featured at the July 2007 issue of Guitar World magazine and in the Betcha Can't Play This series. His last show with the band was in Japan, at the Loud Park Festival, sharing the stage with such acts as Heaven And Hell, Marilyn Manson, Blind Guardian and Arch Enemy. He announced his departure from the group in January 2008. In June, 2008 in a press release from UK based melodic power metal band Power Quest announced that Bill Hudson had joined as co-lead guitarist alongside Andrea Martongelli. Bill had to leave the band ten months later, with band member Steve Williams citing Bill's current location and costs as practical problems for the band. Hudson was then contacted by Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens about joining his band Circle II Circle for a US tour alongside Jon Oliva's Pain. He remains in the band's lineup to date, having toured with them through throughout the US, Europe and Dubai including the world's biggest heavy metal festivals and several headline dates. A 2012 appearance at the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany, resulted in the live album \\"Live At Wacken\\", out via earMUSIC. Hudson's contributions in the studio can be heard in the albums \\"Seasons Will Fall\\" (2012) and \\"Reigh of Darkness\\" (2015). In 2012, while in Dubai with CIIC, he was contacted by longtime friend and Vital Remains vocalist Brian Werner about joining the band for a few shows. This resulted in Hudson joining the band as lead guitarist for an appearance at the 2012 Metal Cruise through the Bahamas Barge To Hell, as well as a tour of 6 shows in his home country, Brazil. It would be the first time he performed there as a professional musician. He was soon after contacted by producer Logan Mader (FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH, FEAR FACTORY, MACHINE HEAD) about recording guitars for the soundtrack of the Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance video game. Hudson's guitar can be heard on the tracks \\"The Only Thing I Know For Real\\" and \\"Red Sun\\". An ongoing relationship with Mader has also led Hudson to record lead guitars on the producer's own band Once Human's, debut album \\"The Life I Remember\\", out on earMUSIC. In 2014, he becomes Jon Oliva's Pain new lead guitarist. The group headlines the 2014 edition of the ProgPower USA festival, playing the Savatage album, \\"Streets\\" in its entirety. That same year he begins working with former SNOT and Divine Heresy vocalist Tommy Vext in what would become the band Westfield Massacre. Hudson and Vext wrote six songs in partnership, all of which are included in the band's debut album, out via Urban Yeti in 2015. Hudson appears in the music video for his composition Darkness Divides as the band's lead guitarist. The video also features former Morbid Angel and Divine Heresy drummer, Tim Yeung. In 2015 he performs at the once again at the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany, this time as a member of Savatage, as headliners. Soon after he announces his recruitment into the Trans-Siberian Orchestra for their 2015 Winter Tour, replacing Joel Hoekstra, who was simultaneously touring with Whitesnake. In 2017, Hudson was announced as the new guitarist for U.D.O. and Dirkschneider, the German bands led by former Accept frontman, Udo Dirkschneider. Around the same time, former Morbid Angel frontman has announced that he would be starting a new band with the band's former drummer Tim Yeung and would be taking Hudson as lead guitarist. On April 24, 2018, it was announced that Hudson left U.D.O and Dirkschneider after only a year due to individual differences with no hard feelings on both sides.http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/guitarist-bill-hudson-exits-u-d-o-and- dirkschneider-after-only-a-year/ In late 2017, he founded NorthTale alongside ex-Twilight Force singer Christian Eriksson and former Yngwie Malmsteen drummer Patrick Johansson.

Education and personal life Cary Blunt Millholland was born in Cumberland, Maryland, on December 11, 1902. She was one of five children of James Allaire and Harriet (or Harriett) Woodward Millholland. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1924 and then continued her studies informally while traveling around Europe and East Asia. Her travels in Asia developed her interest in trees as a landscape element. She went on to enroll in the landscape architecture program at the Cambridge School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, from which she graduated in 1934. In 1954, she married Newton Belmont Parker, who died in 1993. She died on January 21, 2001. Career After obtaining her degree in landscape architecture, she worked in several different temporary jobs: for architect Gertrude Sawyer, for landscape architects Ellen Shipman and Rose Greely, and for the Historic American Buildings Survey. In 1937, she opened her own practice in Washington, D.C., which she ran for five years while also doing freelance drafting work for other firms around town. Parker worked for the U.S. War Department during World War II, initially as a draftsperson and later overseeing the fabrication of relief maps for the Office of Strategic Services. After the war, she reopened her practice, which continued (with interruptions) until 1975. During the 1950s, Parker's husband was stationed in Central America, and she accompanied him there, living in Nicaragua and Guatemala, where she collected orchids. After their return to the United States, she taught at the Catholic University of America (1960‚Äì1963). Parker's landscape design projects include the central plaza at St. John‚Äôs College in Maryland; The Octagon House in Washington, D.C.; and elements of Point Farm in Calvert County, Maryland, which is now the Jefferson Patterson Park & Museum. She created the original plan for a garden for U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter, later expanded on by landscape architect Perry Hunt Wheeler. She also worked with First Lady Lady Bird Johnson on several projects for beautifying Washington, D.C. Parker was active in the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA), serving at various times as secretary, vice-president, and trustee of the Potomac chapter. She was elected a fellow of the ASLA in 1965. She was also a member of Society of Woman Geographers (SWG) and the Garden Club of America, which honored her with its Medal of Merit. As part of an oral histories project, the Society of Woman Geographers conducted an interview with Parker in 1993; the interview by Ada Currier is in the SWG archives.

An entry in the Madden NFL series, the game was released for Android and iOS devices on August 26, 2014. Gameplay Madden NFL Mobile (MM) began as a mobile version of Madden Ultimate Team (MUT), with features like players and cards being available. To earn these, players participate in \\"Live Events\\", which can earn them card packs and coins. Another mode that is available is a season mode. In prior versions of Madden Mobile, this was called \\"Season\\" mode, which allows players to play a full 16-game season, which extends to the Super Bowl. This feature was removed in MADDEN OVERDRIVE but was reintroduced in 2020 as \\"seasons\\". Being a freemium game, players can spend real-life money to purchase packs, in game currency, and \\"Bundles\\" that include a certain number of packs and a topper of an item. The game is also level-based, and features like bonuses for rewards that increase as one reaches higher levels. There is also another mode labeled \\"Leagues\\" where players may join or create a league alongside other players that face in Tournaments against other leagues, offering a chat box, goals with rewards such as players and tokens. The ability for players to send other players within the league packs was discontinued with MM 2017. The game itself features standard football rules, such as scoring mechanics including touchdowns, field goals, and safeties. It also features real plays categorized as \\"long passes\\", \\"short passes\\", \\"play action passes\\", and \\"run\\" plays for the offense; \\"man coverage\\", \\"zone coverage\\", and \\"blitz\\" plays for the defense. It also features multiple special plays available at any point including punts, fake punts, field goals, quarterback kneels, spikes, and fake field goals. There are also up to four different styles for kickoffs, kick returns, punt, punt returns (left, right, middle, duplicates, onside kicks, etc.) The game is connectable with Facebook to allow for more social features, though players can also create unlinked accounts. =Seasons = Seasons have been a part of a game since the start however have been changed every year and were removed in Madden Overdrive. In Madden Mobile 20 they were brought back and new features were added to make it a more realistic experience for the player.https://www.ea.com/games/madden- nfl/madden-nfl-mobile =Events= Events is a game mode in which players may participate in various challenges for rewards. Typically, there is no charge to play Events once, but replays of some events must be played using an in- game reward token called \\"Blitz Tokens\\". The use of \\"Stamina\\" to play events was eliminated with the launch of Madden Overdrive and was reintroduced in season six. Completing these events earn the player rewards, such as card packs, coins, players, experience points, or one of the program specific currencies that were rolled out with the Madden Overdrive version of the game. There are also seasonal live events for things such as Black Friday, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, Easter as well as Super Bowl and Playoff Recap events. Every day of the week, there are new live events. =Head to Head= Madden Overdrive did away with the Head to Head mode with Madden Overdrive, replacing it with the game's namesake \\"Overdrive\\" mode. Madden NFL Overdrive removed the original Head to Head format and replaced it with the Overdrive mode. This new take on Head to Head features real-time multiplayer for the first time in franchise history, in which both players try to score as many \\"Fantasy Points\\" as possible in a 3-minute game. =Blitz Tournaments= Originally implemented in MM18, Blitz Tournaments were a mode that took place every weekend that put opponents in a head to head match, usually with a modification to the gameplay (i.e. Only being able to call pass plays, having a limited amount of plays to score, etc.). Players had to get as many wins as possible over the course of the weekend, with the top players receiving sought after player cards as a reward. This mode was released to overwhelming success, becoming one of the most popular game modes in Madden Mobile's history. When Madden NFL Overdrive launched, the mode was not initially included in the game, which came as both a shock and disappointment to many returning players. However, the mode was re-released in December 2018, with a few changes. Now, blitz tournaments run through the entire week, instead of just the weekends. Tournaments now use Overdrive instead of the original head to head mode, and have yet to include any gameplay modifiers in the tournaments thus far. Doing well in these tournaments awards players with a currency they can use for a variety of rewards, including elite and diamond players, grab bag packs, and 94 OVR Blitz Tournament Masters. While the mode is popular, it most likely will not see the success it had the year before. =Leagues= Joining a League will give the player user interaction with other players inside the game. In a league, one can play each other in a head- to-head match for bragging rights. There are League Tournaments that a league can play in as a team: all players participating in the tournament will have three drives to score as high as possible against another league. The rewards of tournaments is league XP, used to level up. Finally, there are League Championships, in which players compete against each other in a championship tournament that will rank them based on their performances in the tournament. =Auction House= The Auction House is a place where players may bid/buy cards. While since its inception, the Auction House was a place where players could buy items being sold by other players, that system was changed mid- season in MM 18 to a brokered auction house, in which a bot acts as an intermediary between players buying and selling their cards. Bidding allows the player to bid slowly against others with a slightly lower chance of winning the item. Buying the item allows the player to immediately end the bidding process and earn the item for the amount bought for. The player may not buy the item if the buy price is less than the bidding price. A common activity on the Auction House is referred to as \\"sniping,\\" or buying items for low prices as soon as they are available and reselling them for profit. The Auction house shuts down a few days before a new season begins, but posting to the Auction House is disabled 3 days prior to going down. Ten percent of the coins made on the transaction are deducted as a tax. =Players= Players come in the form of cards or captains. Cards can vary in power, scarcity, tier, and the stats on the card. All cards feature a power, a key aspect of the player's team which determines their performance in all multiplayer game modes, such as Overdrive and Arena. Captains are exclusive to the Overdrive game mode, and give boosts to the player's team. They also give a Captain Bonus when the player completes the bonus objective, which gives the player extra points in the match. Different Captains can be unlocked in several ways, including completing a fixed amount of matches or scoring a certain number of points with a captain. =Packs= Packs are another element to the game. Prior to the launch of Madden Overdrive, it was a major element. However, most traditional packs were eliminated and were replaced by packs purchased with various tokens and currencies available in-game. However, some packs require spending of actual money, in the form of Madden Cash. There are many different packs available for different times and lengths. Some packs such as the Pro Pack are available 24/7, while others (such as Super Bowl) are available for a few days. Packs could include rare collectibles, bronze to onyx players, etc. and vary in value. There are uniforms for all 32 teams and some special uniforms. The default uniform depends on the team being used. Some special uniforms come out for example throwback uniforms and special uniforms for the events. Uniforms may be purchased with in-game coins, cash, and gems. They may also be obtained through packs. Release The game received a soft launch on the Canadian App Store on August 12, 2014. The game was released on the iOS App Store and on Android's Google Play, the same day that Madden NFL 15 was released on console. A large update, coinciding with the release of Madden NFL 16, was released in August 2015. The new features were added in the season such as achievements, league improvements, a redesigned hub, more Live Events, and better tuning. Seasonal updates for Madden NFL 17 and Madden NFL 18 were also released. For the 2018‚Äì19 season, the game was renamed to Madden NFL Overdrive. It was renamed back to Madden Mobile for the 2019-20 season. Reception Madden NFL Mobile got mixed reviews. On Metacritic the game got 68%. Pocket Gamer gave it 7 out of 10 and said that \\"Madden NFL Mobile has come a long way, but it feels like it could still go a bit further. It's absolutely worth a look if you're a fan, but it's probably not going to rock your world.\\" Phandroid said that \\"Whether the annoyances of microtransactions and modern-day mobile gaming annoy you, we at least appreciate that there‚Äôs a pretty good game beneath the green veil of dollar bills EA decided to decorate it with.\\".

A wide shot of the front of Blackcraig Castle. Blackcraig Castle is a Baronial mansion house dating from 1856 in Perthshire, Scotland, close to the towns of Ballintuim and Blairgowrie on the banks of the River Ardle. It was built in 1856 by Patrick Allan Fraser, a prominent Scottish artist and architect, and is designated as a Class B-listed building, with its walled garden A-listed. It has undergone extensive renovations/modernisation in recent years to return it to its full former glory and remains one of the finest examples of Baronial architecture in Scotland. History Surveys suggest that, originally occupying the site of Blackcraig Castle was a 16th-century tower house thought to be the property of the Maxwells‚Äô, who were in possession of the barony of Ballmacreuchy by 1550. Patrick Allan Fraser of Hospitalfield, Arbroath purchased the estate of Blackcraig from the trustees of Robert Rattray in 1847, before embarking on renovation of the tower house and construction of an adjoined hunting lodge in 1851, in addition to a bridgehouse and gatehouse. The original tower house stood three storeys in height and the masonry is of lime-mortared rubble, readily distinguishable from the 19th-century extensions. His designs were followed both outside and in and he continued to alter and extend Blackcraig until the 1880s when ill health halted further progress. It became part of the Hospitalfield Arts Trust after the death of Fraser in 1890 and was later sold and run as a guest house for a number of years. The current owners have been renovating Blackcraig and its policies since 2013 with a view to returning it to its former splendour. Two tasteful self-contained holiday apartments have also been incorporated and are available to rent. Although the castle and its policies are private, there are plans to open them to the public for events in the future. Bridgehouse The class A-listed Blackcraig bridgehouse was added by Patrick Allan Fraser in the 19th-century renovations and is not to be confused with the main castle. Also taking over 40 years to complete, it is a magnificent example of bridgehouse architecture.

In October 2015 he set out on a non-stop solo circumnavigation of the world in his yacht, the Marathon, in part to raise funds for charity. White, who was disabled, lost the use of his left arm in 1991 due to a road traffic accident. A sailor since he was 16 years old, he achieved some significant firsts with his circumnavigation of the UK and Ireland, and his circuit of the Atlantic. Yachting achievements =Circumnavigation of UK and Ireland= The Marathon, moored on the DC pontoon in thumb The Marathon leaving port in Dartmouth on 25 October 2015, with no fanfare, no fleet of spectator boats, motoring past thumb In 2005, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, White circumnavigated Great Britain and Ireland solo, travelling anticlockwise, against the prevailing winds. His boat, the Nephele, a Beneteau First 325, encountered a severe storm 60 miles northwest of Arranmore and 40 miles from Tory Island, off the coast of Ireland, and was overwhelmed but remained afloat. The voyage started on 5 June 2005, from Gillingham, and the severe storm, force 11 on the Beaufort scale, caught him on 3 July 2005. His mayday call was relayed to the Malin Coastguard, and the rescue operation lasted 24 hours. After rescue and treatment of injuries received, White completed the circumnavigation on 22 July 2005. Guinness Book of World Records has declined to list White's feat, calling it too complex to stand as a record. =Transatlantic voyage= With a new boat, the Rosiley, a Hanse 400, White completed a successful solo circuit from the UK to the US and back in 2007 and 2008. The route took him from the UK via the Canary Islands, Florida, New York City, and Boston, and then back across the Atlantic to the UK. His yacht had no modifications for disability. =Solo global circumnavigation attempt= White planned a nonstop solo circumnavigation for charity. In 2015 he prepared for his charity solo circumnavigation of the world by entering his yacht, the Marathon, a one-off Feeling 1350 yacht, built for the 1991 BOC Challenge and veteran of two prior circumnavigations, in the Round the Island Race, with crew. The purpose of this was to seek to find and remove any pre- circumnavigation technical problems. The solo circumnavigation attempt started in October 2015. Marathon departed from Cowes on 23 October 2015, pausing in Dartmouth, Devon, on 24 October before setting out to cross the notional circumnavigation start/finish line from Lizard lighthouse to Ushant. He left Dartmouth in the morning of 25 October 2015. Though the voyage was planned to be a nonstop solo circumnavigation (which, with the use of one arm, might have qualified as an around the world sailing record), White's shore team announced on 29 October 2015 that catastrophic gear failure meant it was essential to head for port in northern Spain to undertake repairs. The voyage resumed on 8 November 2015 after a week of repairs in A Coru√±a. A further serious gear failure necessitated a stop for repairs at Las Palmas on Gran Canaria on 22 November 2015, leaving to resume the journey on 30 November 2015. White's 2015 voyage was planned to raise money for two charities, Save the Children, and a foundation to build a sailing replica of the Cutty Sark, to be built on the Isle of Wight. The voyage was estimated to take about ten months. On 23 December 2015 White's shore team announced the postponement of the challenge citing the unserviceability of both of his self-steering mechanisms. White had set course for the Caribbean to make things safe, and announced his intention to return to Cowes to raise additional funding, refit the Marathon, and try again. =Longest solo transatlantic attempt= Returning to the UK from the Cayman Islands, starting in April 2016, White set himself the challenge of the longest disabled solo transatlantic leg. Analogous historical feats Other disabled sailors have been involved in solo circumnavigations. Charl DeVilliers was a deaf round-the-world sailor; Robert E. Case was deaf and circumnavigated; and Vinny Lauwers, is a paraplegic who won the 2001 Laureus Award in the disability category for sailing around the world solo, unassisted, and nonstop. Gerry Hughes, a profoundly deaf Scottish teacher, sailed single-handed round the world \\"past all five capes\\".

History The Castillo de San Juli√°n is located on and takes its name from the Monte de San Juli√°n. In 1706, the British captured Cartagena during the War of the Spanish Succession, and they built a cylindrical tower on the hill. Following the end of the war, the Spanish began to build a fort on the hill in order to protect the mouth of Cartagena's harbour. The new fort incorporated the British tower, and construction took a very long time, being completed in 1883. The fort was used as a military prison during the Spanish Civil War. Today, the fort is still intact but it is in a rather dilapidated state. It is listed on the Bien de Inter√©s Cultural, and is currently owned by Telef√≥nica, who have installed a number of antennas within the fort.

It was released on November 1, 2013.Estreno de Espectro en M√©xico, nueva pel√≠cula de Alfonso Herrera y Paz Vega The film is also known as Demon Inside. Plot Marta (Paz Vega) is a clairvoyant who has been running a small shop and consultation, working mainly with Tarot cards. At the beginning of the movie, she is about to be released from a psychiatric hospital, where she has been for some time, due to very intense conditions of PTSD and agoraphobia. It is soon revealed that prior to her admittance to the hospital, she had fallen in love with Mario (Alfonso Herrera), an architect visiting her shop, who after a few, completely innocuous dates, suddenly appeared in a parking facility, looking very disturbed, and subsequently raped her violently, traumatizing her severely. We see in flashbacks that she has had her special ability since early childhood, apparently inherited from her mother, who explains its nature to her ‚Äì including the fact that ‚ÄúNo one can see everything‚Äù, i.e. that some things will remain hidden even from Marta. In the course of the movie, we learn that Marta's father died when she was very young ‚Äì but that even with a photo of him, and his ghost (smiling lovingly at Marta) sitting nearby (and visible to Marta's mother), Marta cannot see him. Further flashbacks, and press clippings, gradually reveal that she can see and communicate with ghosts, sometimes simply comforting them, sometimes helping police uncover what was actually murder. In the present, her friend Monica (Johanna Murillo) helps Marta settle into a small apartment (in a building belonging to Monica's uncle), since Marta refuses to go home because Mario knows her address. Monica has brought some things from her home and her shop, but Marta instructs Monica to burn the clairvoyance paraphernalia, embittered that in spite of her gift, she never had an inkling about Mario's dark side. Monica explains that Mario is in prison, but Marta still feels very uneasy. Shortly afterwards, Marta is looking out her kitchen window, seeing her neighbor's kitchen window across a very small inner courtyard. Her neighbor, visited by a lesbian lover, ominously takes a kitchen knife, at the same time noticing Marta, who is obviously frightened by the incident. After a little while, the neighbor knocks on Marta's door, alternately saying that she just wants to talk and yelling, ‚ÄúWhat did you see?!‚Äù, meanwhile brandishing a knife. Marta gets glimpses of her new apartment showered in blood and of a presence, seemingly a woman who might have come to a violent end in that very apartment. Marta asks Monica to ask her uncle about it, and does some searching on the internet on her own, discovering that a woman seems to have been killed in the building, with Marta's frightening neighbor as a prime suspect, but never charged. Marta also uses the internet to check up on Mario, discovering to her horror that Mario was acquitted of the rape charges and is therefore on the loose. Later that evening, looking through her living-room window down in the street, she sees someone looking uncannily like Mario. Terrified, Marta calls the police, who tell her that they cannot help her. In a subsequent conversation, Monica admits to having lied about his imprisonment to Marta, in order to make her feel safe. Marta then covers her windows with newspaper pages and orders surveillance gear via the internet. She instructs the delivery man to leave the things at her door and barely manages to retrieve the material before her scary neighbor comes running out on their shared landing. Marta installs surveillance cameras in her home and cameras overlooking the street and the landing. The cameras capture another appearance in the street of Mario, another angry outburst from the neighbor, and many appearances inside the apartment of the ghost of the woman who has apparently been murdered in a horrible fashion. Marta also has these visions on her own, but in a phone conversation Monica reports back from her uncle that Marta's apartment has been empty for months, and that no one has ever been murdered there. Suddenly, while Marta is standing in her bathroom, she is attacked by Mario who stabs her with a pair of scissors while trying to rape her once more. Badly wounded she fights him off momentarily, slowly dragging herself from room to room, trying to reach the landing. Every instant is identical to her visions, and she realizes that her visions were not visitations from a ghost in the past, but her gift trying to warn her about her own imminent future. She calls Monica, trying to explain this, but it is unclear how much of it Monica understands. After a violent setback in the shape of another attack from Mario, Marta manages to escape into the elevator. Here, the movie ends abruptly, leaving the viewer in doubt as to whether she dies from her wounds in the elevator (which seems probable) or might be saved by Monica when the elevator reaches the ground floor.

In addition to grow lights, Illumitex also creates lights for the Commercial & Industrial space, as well as digital horticulture solutions. The company is based in Austin, Texas and has manufacturing facilities in Austin, China, and Malaysia. History Illumitex was founded in 2005 by Matt Thomas, Dung Duong, and Paul Winberg. The company largely stayed under the radar until they began receiving funding in 2008. They raised $10.5 million in a B round of funding in 2008 and, in 2009, added an additional $10 million in another round. By 2010, the company had received around $22 million in investor funding from groups like New Enterprise Associates, DFJ Mercury, and Applied Ventures. Also in 2010, Illumitex released its first product line (dubbed \\"Aduro\\") which consisted of square-shaped LED lights that could theoretically provide more light coverage than traditional rounded LED lights. The company's original goal was to provide residential and commercial lighting solutions for indoor rooms, parking lots, streetlights, and more. One of Illumitex's early clients was an apartment complex in Singapore. In 2011, Illumitex added an additional $13.5 million in equity. In April 2012, the company received an additional $9.3 million from existing investors, bringing the total money raised to $50.3 million. The company continued to pursue options in vertical farming, contained environmental agriculture, and tissue culture laboratories as well as general illumination. Illumitex had 35 employees in 2012. The company raised $3.8 million in 2013 and added around $6 million in 2014. In August 2014, Illumitex announced plans to double the size of its headquarters. In 2015, the company secured $16 million in a funding round led by WP Global Partners. As of 2015, greenhouses account for the largest portion of Illumitex's customer base. The company has also provided lighting to prominent vertical farms like the Chicago-based FarmHere, which provided crops to Whole Foods. Products As of 2015, most of Illumitex's products are used in contained environmental agriculture and vertical farming operations. The company produces a wide range of LED lights with customized intensity and wavelengths. The company's lights produce the \\"theoretical maximum amount of light for photosynthesis.\\" Illumitex also produces its own fixtures and other lighting accessories.

It was built from to the 1940s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005.  History  The Mill Point Settlement Site on Lake Cootharaba contains remnants of a private \\"company\\" township based around a sawmill and sustained by timber extraction from local forests which was in operation from the late 1860s until the early 1890s. Exploration of the timber resources in the Cooloola area commenced in the early 1860s. William Pettigrew visited the area in 1863, exploring the Noosa River and its lakes. Although Pettigrew subsequently concentrated his timber operations in northern Cooloola, he recorded quantities of hardwoods including cedar, Bunya pine, Kauri pine, Hoop pine, Cypress pine, beech, ash, tulip and yellow-wood in various locations. Cedar-getters appear to have been working in the Noosa River area by the mid-1860s. The development of the timber industry in southern Cooloola has been attributed, at least in part, to the capital injected into the area as a result of the exploitation of the gold resource at Gympie. An application to select Portion 1 in the parish of Noosa, the land on which the Mill Point Settlement was established, was lodged by Charles Samuel Russell in March 1869. Portion 1 was later known as Cootharaba Station and fronted Lake Cootharaba. Russell, having previously visited the Noosa area and noted the \\"attractiveness\\" of land at Lake Cootharaba, formed a partnership with four men involved in mining ventures in Gympie: James McGhie, Abraham Fleetwood Luya, Frederick George Goodchap and John Woodburn. Although Russell's name is recorded as the applicant, subsequent references are made to \\"McGhie, Luya and Co.\\" as the company, which established the Cootharaba Sawmills at Mill Point. Following his arrival in Queensland in 1864, Luya had worked on various railways until 1869 when he moved to the Gympie goldfield. He established Cootharaba Sawmills, commencing a 30-year association with the sawmilling industry. Luya established McGhie, Luya and Co., merchants and sawmillers, with an office in South Brisbane. From 1888 to 1899, Luya was also the managing director of the Queensland Milling Company. Luya's involvement in Queensland and Brisbane politics included periods as MLA for South Brisbane (1888‚Äì93 and in 1899), and as Mayor of South Brisbane (1896‚Äì98). Luya died in Brisbane in July 1899. An article in the Brisbane Courier following Luya's death described him as \\"one of the leading business men of the city for many years\\". By the end of 1869, McGhie, Luya and Co. had moved onto Portion 1. Improvements including houses and a sawmill were erected in 1870. A Mill Manager was advertised for in April 1872. Although Russell and his wife lived at Elanda Point, Russell's interest was transferred to the other partners in mid-1871. The \\"second class pastoral land\\" of Cootharaba Station was used as a cattle property to supply meat for the sawmill company's employees and as a source of bullocks and horses to haul the company's wagons and drays. The Mill Point Settlement was built in a swampy area on the edge of Lake Cootharaba. The swamp was progressively filled in with sawdust to create and extend the timber yards. Initially timber was taken from Portion 1 and logs were rafted down Kin Kin Creek to the lake and held in a yard by a double line of piles forming a breakwater. During later sawmill operations, timber was taken from as far away as Mount Coondoo and hauled to a tram terminus. By the early 1870s loads of timber were sent along Cootharaba Road to Gympie. Transporting the timber was initially the most problematic aspect of the operation at Mill Point. Bullock teams became bogged in the saturated, sandy soils and Cootharaba Road had swampy sections, steep pinches and seven miles of scrub along Kin Kin and Tinana Creeks. The difficulties of Cootharaba Road were resolved with the establishment of an outlet by sea via a depot at Tewantin, which was managed by Goodchap. Flat-bottomed paddle-wheel boats known as droghers, (the \\"Black Swan\\", \\"Countess of Belmore\\" and \\"Elanda\\"), towed punts of sawn timber through Lakes Cootharaba and Cooroibah to Tewantin, where the timber was loaded onto the firm's steamer, the \\"S.S. Culgoa\\" and taken to Brisbane three times a fortnight with loads of up to 35,000 super feet of timber. The S.S. Culgoa was built in Adelaide in 1865 and used on the Darling and Murrumbidgee Rivers before acquisition by McGhie, Luya and Co. The Company established \\"Noosa Sawmill\\" at South Brisbane in the early 1880s and the S.S. Culgoa carried passengers, general cargo and sawn timber on each trip between Tewantin and Brisbane until completion of the Brisbane-Gympie railway link in 1891. To overcome the problems with swampy, sticky, low-lying and poorly drained ground conditions at Mill Point, during the mid-1870s the Company constructed a tramway system of gauge wooden rails, in cross-section, across the property. The wooden rails were wedged into slots on sleepers of penda and ironbark. The main tramway line ran for about a quarter of a mile in an easterly direction to the sawmill and settlement on Lake Cootharaba. To raise the tramway above the surrounding swampy country, felled melaleuca were laid with stout girders on top, sleepers were then laid at three feet intervals across the girders to secure the rails, gaps between were slabbed and filled with ballast consisting of sand and gravel from the Lake to provide traction for the bullock and horse teams. The line appears to have run through flat country except for one ridgeline, where a cutting reached the valley of Kin Kin. The line had relatively few curves and a gentle gradient from the hinterland to sea level at the lake. The terminus appears to have been bound by Eulama and Kin Kin Creeks, approximately west of Mill Point. A reporter for the Brisbane Courier in the mid-1870s noted that sections of the rail were \\"smooth as glass\\" and one side appeared to be wearing out faster than the other. He was told that the worn side was made from ironbark wood and needed replacing once every six months, while the penda lasted two years and even then generally did not need replacing. By 1877, only penda was being used for rails, and in 1878 the wooden rails were replaced with steel, negating the need for constant repair. In August 1878, the Brisbane Courier reported that the \\"company is preparing to lay down four miles of railway with 16 pound rails which would carry five ton wagons so logs could be hauled by three or four horses or by a small traction engine\\". Logs were drawn to the sawmill along the tramway on wagons pulled by draughthorse teams; the traction engine option appears never to have been used at Mill Point. The use of the tramway was certainly much faster than the original bullock dragged method where logs were dragged from where they were cut to the sawmill for processing. It has been suggested that the Company was persuaded to establish the expensive tramway, at just under per mile, to overcome the difficulties of inducing teams to work at Mill Point. However, at its peak a total of nine bullock and horse teams were employed at Mill Point. In December 1873, McGhie advertised for six bullock teams to draw cedar logs guaranteeing two years work. In late 1874, 100 men were reported as employed there and in 1878, McGhie, Luya & Co. advertised for teams, emphasising the constant work. The establishment of the tramway also provided certainty for McGhie, Lyua & Co. During periods of wet weather, bullock teams were generally unable to work, but the tramway teams could operate continually. Loading the felled timber onto the tramway wagons was done by using a winch on a trolley that was anchored to the tramway. Five men were killed at the sawmill as the result of a boiler explosion on 29 July 1873. One man was killed instantly with another four men subsequently dying of injuries received as a result of standing near the boiler. Four of the five men died at Mill Point and were buried in the cemetery. The fifth, Patrick Molloy, died after great suffering on 10 September in Gympie Hospital and was buried in the Gympie cemetery (his hearse overturning en route to the cemetery). The explosion was attributed to a weakness in the boiler rather than as a result of careless operation. The explosion was one of a number that occurred in Queensland that year and an inquest into safety ensued. Following the inquest, regulations covering the design of valves on steam boilers were tightened, and boiler operators needed a certificate to operate. During the early period of its establishment the settlement was known as \\"Kin Kin Sawmills\\" however it was subsequently known as \\"Cootharaba Sawmill\\" or \\"Cootharaba Village Settlement\\". It has been known locally as both \\"Mill Point\\" and \\"Elanda Point\\" since the early 20th century. In 1871, the population of the settlement was 22 people. In May 1873, in preparation for a visit by Governor Normanby, an account of a visit by a journalist records \\"Leaving the works and passing to the rear we found a regular little township of workmen's houses and others directly connected with the establishment, a good store, well- equipped, conducted by the owners, a butcher's shop, and there seemed nothing wanting to complete the comfort of all connected with the establishment\\". The Cootharaba School was established at the settlement and opened in August 1874 with an enrolment of 16 students. For the period of its operation the sawmill and associated settlement was a Company enterprise, and the only external employee was the school teacher. The sawmill proprietors provided a school building, including a library, reading room and grounds. The school also served as a community hall. In a report to Parliament in 1875, the school was described as a comfortable building with a verandah near the shores of Lake Cootharaba, better equipped than most schools in the colony. A hotel operated from 1876 until 1878, when the building was destroyed by fire. Community life included picnics, excursions and sports days. For example, New Year's Day in 1877 was celebrated with a cricket match, sawmill hands versus timber-getters and bullock-drivers. A cemetery was established at the Cootharaba Settlement and 43 burials are recorded between 1873 and 1891, comprising 9 men, 4 women and 30 children. The first burials included four of the five men who were injured in the boiler explosion of 29 July 1873. Children buried in the cemetery died of causes such as lung problems, wasting, thrush, convulsions and drowning. The cemetery was never officially gazetted, being a private cemetery on privately owned land. Vera Grady (n√©e Crang) who lived on a later dairy farm in the area during the early 1900s remembered 11 grave markers at the cemetery during the 1920s. Several of the grave markers have since been collected by relatives and concerned locals and are held in the local Elanda Point Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service office. With their removal from original positions and no official record of burial locations, there is no reliable way to identify who was buried where in the cemetery. A single headstone is located in the Museum at Gympie. During the 1880s, at the height of the sawmill's operations, it is estimated that there were between 100 and 150 employees and their families living at the sawmill and settlement. From the mid-1880s, a series of events led to the eventual decline and closure of the sawmill complex in the early 1890s. The Queensland Government's introduction of royalties in 1884, intended to control wasteful cutting and competition from imported timbers, reduced the output of local sawmills and kept the price of timber down. These timber regulations were part of the provisions of the 1884 Crown Lands Act, forestry then being under the control of the Department of Public Lands. This Act established the system of perpetual leasehold and was the product of the philosophy of the new liberal government of Griffith that the state should get a return from the private use of public resources. The new Minister for Lands, Dutton, saw the royalty as the timber equivalent of a pastoral rent. Opposition was intense, especially since the royalty was seen to give an unfair advantage to imports. By the early 1890s the softwood resources in the vicinity of the sawmill were nearing exhaustion, having been exploited for 20 years. Completion of the Brisbane- Gympie railway link in July 1891 ended the need for a ship and coach service between Brisbane and Gympie via Tewantin. The S.S. Culgoa was wrecked on the Noosa River bar in 1891 and the sawmill finally closed in 1892. The sawmill itself was eventually demolished and materials were reused or left to fall down during the subsequent use as farm land. In 1891, Luya attempted to establish a \\"village settlement\\" on Portion 1, offering leases of blocks to prospective farmers. Eleven families moved onto the blocks in March that year and by November over half had left the area as the land proved unfit for cultivation, being either too wet or too sandy. Dairy farmers moved into the area in the early 20th century, but dairy farming was not successful either. This was partly due to the swampy country and the deficiencies of trace elements in the soil. A chimney remains as evidence of where the main dairy farmhouse stood near the former settlement of Mill Point. This chimney appears to date from the time of the sawmill and was adapted and reused during the farming period at the site. Title records indicate that the property and its subsequent subdivisions changed ownership a number of times until it was transferred to the Queensland Government in 1983. The Mill Point area was gazetted as part of Cooloola National Park in 1985 (later becoming part of the Great Sandy National Park). A commemorative plaque was laid at the site in 1988 near the junction of a walking track from the Elanda Point camping ground to the south and tramway formation to the west. Australian poet Judith Wright visited the Mill Point cemetery and wrote a poem, first published in 1956, about life as she imagined it at the settlement during the late 1800s. The poem entitled Graves at Mill Point was written about the life of a man from the settlement known as Alfred Watt. In fact, Alfred was one of the first infants to be buried at the cemetery in 1874 at the age of four months and 20 days. The local branch of the National Trust of Queensland erected a stone on 24 April 1993 bearing the inscription, In memory of the European settlers buried at Mill Point Cemetery, and engraved with the names of persons buried at the cemetery. On 22 June 2004, six interpretive signs, designed by QPWS Elanda Point and Noosa Shire Council, were installed at key locations around the site describing some of its rich history.  Description  = Tramway = The main tramway extends from the settlement area in a curving arc westward. The heritage register boundary extends either side of the middle of the tramway mound. Sections of the original rail remain in situ near the settlement site. Much of the remaining tramway is used as vehicle access. The tramway extends off the National Park into neighbouring properties, but its full extent has yet to be accurately mapped. = Cemetery = The Mill Point cemetery is located west of the settlement area and the boundary forms a square extending from the 1993 memorial stone and interpretive signage in the south a further north and is wide. The eastern boundary is defined by dense revegetation undertaken in mid-late 1990s by QPWS, which is encroaching into the cemetery area and make identification of the full extent of the cemetery difficult. A ploughed field that has also been revegetated by QPWS, although more recently, defines the eastern boundary. Originally there were grave markers at the cemetery, however, these markers have gradually been removed over the years. The base of one headstone remains at the cemetery and has \\"Petrie, Brisbane\\" engraved on it (the Petrie family of Brisbane carried out a business of monumental masonry). Some graves at the cemetery are recognisable by slight depressions in the ground. 15 depressions were mapped in 2004 and are believed to be the probable location of graves. They align in at least 2 rows and are generally orientated east-west as was typical of burial styles in the late 19th century. = Settlement area/Sawmill proper = The settlement area boundary extends from the dairy farmhouse (described separately below) through to the shores of Lake Cootharaba and into Lake Cootharaba itself. The area consists of a section of mounded tramway raised above the melaleuca swamp, which extends for approximately to the shore of Lake Cootharaba. Evidence that the area was once a thriving town is provided by the rich archaeological remains. Most identifiable of these remains are the numerous handmade bricks concentrated under a large fig tree which is less than 80 years old. The bricks were made by many different people (this includes people from the company as well as outsiders) as evidenced in the numerous \\"frogs\\" (indentations in bricks indicating their manufacturer). A large metal boiler dating to the time of the mill stands near the fig tree. Although of the correct period, it is unclear if this boiler comes from the site and is not in situ. The remains of a second boiler are located within Lake Cootharaba and could be related to the 1873 boiler explosion. The remains of the tramway abutment are also located near the fig tree. All that remains above ground level are a number of metal rods and two thick pieces of timber. Two metal pipes extend from beneath the fig tree into Lake Cootharaba and are thought to be related to transporting water from the Lake to the boilers. Between the farmhouse and the shores of Lake Cootharaba are the remains of 20th century yards with hundreds of wooden fence and rail posts. Cecil Potts (a former owner) erected cattle yards in the mid-1940s. Some of the fence posts still have the remains of a three-pronged, handmade barbed wire threaded through the rail holes. Recorded artefacts include numerous pieces of metal (including rose-headed nails, files and saddle buckles), ceramics (including plates, mugs and children's toys), glass (including broken pieces of bottle), and bricks (including different frogs such as \\"J. Petrie\\", \\"CLYDE\\" and 'PATON'). = Lake Cootharaba = The Lake Cootharaba boundary extends from the modern shoreline out into the lake . On the surface and embedded in the lakebed are archaeological remains including bricks, sawn timber, glass, ceramics and metal. The location of pylons from the jetties and wharves associated with the operation of the mill remain in place as large, round stumps. A large metal tram wheel is also located within the waters of the lake. = Dairy farmhouse = The dairy farmhouse is located west of the settlement area. A large, rendered brick chimney is all that remains of the farmhouse, a feature that probably survives from sawmill times. The brick chimney is surrounded by a fence that was erected by QPWS to limit access to the chimney by visitors to the Park and for public health and safety. Three concrete steps are associated with the brick chimney that originally led into the house, but now go nowhere. The concrete is very coarse and of a poor quality. There is a garden associated with the farmhouse that contains a number of historic plantings including crepe myrtles, guavas and bougainvillea. Two mango trees were planted in 1924 by Vera Grady (n√©e Crang), whose family owned and worked the property as a dairy. Near the mango trees is the original brick-lined well dating to the sawmill period. John Crang built a wooden cover for the well that was hinged in the middle in the 1920s, this has since been replaced with a metal ring plate and a wooden platform completely enclosing the well. A windmill, also built by John Crang is associated with the well. The four large timber posts around the windmill were erected by Cecil Potts. A plaque erected in 1993 is located at the junction of a walking track from the Elanda Point camping area to the south and tramway formation to the west.  Heritage listing  The Mill Point Settlement Site was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Mill Point Settlement Site is important in demonstrating part of the pattern of Queensland's history, being associated with the development of the timber industry in the late 19th century. As remnant evidence of a substantial timber extraction and timber processing enterprise and timber settlement in the Cooloola area from 1869 to 1892, it is important in illustrating the pattern of settlement in the Noosa hinterland. It was one of the first and most successful timber mills in the Cooloola area and played an important role in legislative reform in the boiler industry in terms of health and safety following the boiler explosion of 1873. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The survival of extensive remnant material associated with the tramway, the cemetery, dairy area, jetties and wharves at Mill Point, including surface and sub-surface archaeological deposits to a depth of at least below ground level, has the potential to reveal further information about 19th and 20th century life and burial practices at a company timber town in rural Queensland, and about timber extraction and processing. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Mill Point Settlement Site has social significance to the local Boreen Point/Noosa community. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Mill Point Settlement Site has a particular association with the work of McGhie and Luya who were influential in the development of rural southeast Queensland through the development of company towns and involvement in the gold rushes.

It is a year 1 to 6 school with a roll of approximately 230 children. The school runs a Conductive Education Unit for children with motor disorders. History A school was opened in Addington in October 1881, as a side school to the overcrowded West Christchurch School. It was originally called West Christchurch Side School and had a roll of 253 pupils in five classes, with four teachers. By 1887 the roll had increased to 288 and it was decided that the school should become a main school. In 1892 the Addington School district was established, with the railway line as the boundary between it and West Christchurch district. In 1893, when Addington School opened under its new name, the roll was 385 - 135 more than could be accommodated in the buildings. A new infant block was built during the year, and another building was rented. There was a headmaster, five teachers and four pupil-teachers. A swimming pool was built around 1903 and used by the Christchurch Amateur Swimming Club as well as the pupils of the school. The Headmaster from 1893 to at least 1903 was Mr William Nixon Seay, who was born in Ireland in 1863. The First Assistant Master in 1903 was Mr Hans Kennedy. He enjoyed many different sports such as cycling, cricket and rowing. The Infant Mistress from 1893 to at least 1903 was Miss Mary Sisson Shirtcliffe. She had studied at West Christchurch School and then spent four years as a pupil-teacher at East Christchurch School. She then spent two years at the Normal Training College and was Infant Mistress at Ashburton before moving to Addington School. In 1909 a fire destroyed much of the school and pupils were accommodated at West Christchurch and in marquees on the Addington grounds. The buildings were rebuilt and re-opened in February 1910. In 1936, a group of former students formed the Old Students' Association. It operated until 1956, during which time it organised fundraising events to purchase books for the library and to fund the annual school picnic. 60th anniversary celebrations were held in 1941, 75th anniversary celebrations were held in 1956, and centennial celebrations were held in 1981. Notable people = Pupils = Adam Scott, a Christchurch violinist who performed with many orchestras in both New Zealand and Australia, attended Addington School and learned music there with Mona Neale. When Scott was 10 years old, Neale invited him to join a string orchestra with some of her other students. Ali Ahmadi was commended for his work with the Addington Action Committee, formed to help local residents recover after the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. = Staff = David Ching was the principal of Addington School for 17 years, during which time he established the Conductive Education Unit. He also served as a member, and later Chairperson, of the NZ Foundation for Conductive Education. After his retirement from Addington in 2005 he continued to work for the Foundation as National Co-ordinator. In 2016 Ching received a Civic Award from the Mayor of Christchurch, Lianne Dalziel, in recognition of his dedication to primary education and sports.

According to research by Kristin Kulick, director of special projects for the Elizabeth Board of Education, the academic year 1976‚Äì77 was the last year male and female students attended classes separately.\\" In 1957, district officials stated that the inability to determine attendance zones for the two comprehensive high schools after Thomas Jefferson High School opened in 1929 combined with the expansive shop facilities in the new building, led the district to decide to split students by sex, with girls at Battin and boys at Thomas Jefferson. The school closed at the end of the 1976-77 school year, after the Elizabeth High School complex was completed and all of the district's students, male and female, were accommodated at the new four-building facility, ending the city's status as \\"the only community in the state with separate public high schools for boys and girls\\". The $29.3 million project included renovations to Thomas Jefferson High School, which was integrated into the new complex.

She was awarded the Premio Nacional de Arquitectura de Espa√±a (National Architecture Award of Spain) in 2004. Biography Ucelay was the eldest daughter of the lawyer Enrique Sanz and his wife, Pura Ucelay Maort√∫a Lombera. Her sisters were Luz, Margarita y Carmen Ucelay. Her mother, Pure Maort√∫a, who was a great friend of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, belonged to the Lyceum Club and was a founder of the theater company Anfistora. She received her baccalaureate from the Instituto-Escuela. In 1931, she entered the School of Architecture at the University of Madrid where she was an active member of Federaci√≥n Universitaria Escolar (FUE). Ucelay doubled up her course of study, thereby finishing a year ahead of schedule in June 1936. On July 10, at the National Hotel, her peers and friends paid tribute as she became the first woman to receive an architecture degree in Spain. The ceremony was attended by the architect Am√≥s Salvador Carreras, then Minister of the Interior. In the same year, she served on the Governing Board of the Women Association of Architects of Madrid as secretary from August to October (or November), at which time she moved with her family to Valencia. In January 1937, she married Jose Ruiz-Castillo, lawyer and official of the Ministry of Agriculture, a member of a known family of Madrid editors. His father owned Biblioteca Nueva, which Ruiz-Castillo inherited. The couple had two children, Jose Enrique and Javier. After the Spanish Civil War, and because of her participation in the Governing Board of the College of Architects of Madrid in 1936, she was tried and charged with \\"assistance to the rebellion\\". At trial, testimony was presented in her favor by a number of people. However, she was sentenced on 9 July 1942 to disqualification in perpetuity for public office, banned from the private practice of her profession for five years, and fined pesetas. The architecture title she obtained in 1936 was not officially issued to her until 1946. In the 1950s, her candidacy for the board of the Association of University Women, which she founded with card number seven, was vetoed by the Franco authorities. In 1998, the Asociaci√≥n La Mujer Construye (Women Build Association) made a public acknowledgment of Ucelay as the first woman graduate in architecture in Spain. In 2004, she won the National Architecture Award. Two years later, she participated in the Venice Biennale, representing Spain in the event. She died in Madrid on 24 November 2008.

It is a part of Mexican cuisine, and is also common in regions of the United States with significant Mexican-American populations. The drink is most commonly prepared with mango sorbet or mango- flavored shaved ice, and thus is sometimes also called a mangonada or chamango. The drink is essentially a combination of chamoy sauce, shaved ice (or ice cream or sorbet, depending on the preparation), chili powder, and fruit chunks. In certain variations, a whole fruit popsicle, or paleta, is added to the drink and mixed with the shaved ice. The drinking straws served with chamoyadas often have tamarind candy on the outside.

Its origins date back to June 1945, when in Koszalin, the so-called Milicja Obywatelska Sports Club (Milicyjny Klub Sportowy) was established by Stanislaw Fortunski and other sports enthusiasts. First football game in Polish Koszalin (former German Koslin) took place on June 6, 1945. It featured a team of Red Army soldiers, against Milicja Sports Club; the Soviets won 5:3. In February 1946, when local government of this region of Poland was transferred from Koszalin to Szczecin, the team was also moved, and renamed into Milicja Sports Club Szczecin. In 1947 - 1956, the club went through several changes, with different names, such as Gwardia and Chrobry. Finally, after a merger with Stoczniowiec (the team supported by local shipyard), its official name was Stoczniowo-Gwardyjski Klub Sportowy \\"ARKONIA\\" Szczecin. This name remained in use until 1971. In its heyday (1960s, 1970s), Arkonia had as many as 15 departments, with several top national athletes. The organization was famous for its football team, which in the early 1960s played in the Ekstraklasa, waterpolo team, swimmers, boxers and cyclists. Since 1971, several departments were transferred to other organizations, such as volleyball, which was taken over by Gryf Szczecin, and fencing, transferred to Wlokniarz Szczecin.

History The Baron Giorgio Franchetti (1865‚Äì1927), was born to a prominent family of Turin. Initially trained in a military school, he preferred the study of music and collecting art. He married in 1890 the Baroness Maria Hornstein Hohenstoffeln. However, by 1891 he had moved to Venice, and there soon purchased the then dilapidated Ca' d'Oro and set upon restoring the building, as possible, to its 15th-century layout. Franchetti also traveled widely to purchase objects for the palace, including in Paris the palace's original well head (1427) by Bartolomeo Bon. He supervised much of the restoration, added the mosaic floor collections, and constructed a chapel to house his Mantegna St Sebastian. The inner courtyard mosaic was designed by the Baron himself. His grandson helped further his wish, stated in 1916, to make the house and his collection a museum.

It discusses several aspects of the garment industry from production‚Äîmainly exploring the life of low-wage workers in developing countries‚Äîto its after-effects such as river and soil pollution, pesticide contamination, disease and death. Using an approach that looks at environmental, social and psychological aspects, it also examines consumerism and mass media, ultimately linking them to global capitalism. The documentary is a collage of several interviews with environmentalists, garment workers, factory owners, and people organizing fair trade companies or promoting sustainable clothing production. Morgan's attention was drawn to the topic after the 2013 Savar building collapse when a commercial building in Bangladesh named Rana Plaza toppled and killed over a thousand workers. Starting the project in October of that year, he traveled to thirteen countries to collect information and conduct interviews. The film was funded by Kickstarter and premiered as a side screening during the 2015 Cannes Film Festival in May 2015 before its release in select American and British theaters later that month. Critics have been both positive and dismissive, with reviews ranging from \\"vitally important documentary\\" to \\"vague liberal agitprop\\". Content In The True Cost, Morgan examines the garment industry‚Äîspecifically the fast fashion business‚Äî and links it to consumerism, globalization, capitalism, structural poverty, and oppression. In the film, it is stated that in the 1960s, the American fashion industry produced 95% of the clothes its people wore, while in the 2010s only 3% percent is produced in the United States, with the rest produced in developing countries. Operating in countries such as Bangladesh, India, Cambodia, and China, major brand manufacturers minimize costs and maximize profits by having companies in those countries competing against each other. The international brands pressure the factory owners, threatening to close and move production to another country if the clothes are not cheap enough; the owners, in turn, pressure their workers and, as one owner says, \\"They're hampering me, I'm hampering my workers\\". According to Morgan, despite garment manufacturing being a three-trillion- dollar industry, the working conditions in those countries are poor. In addition to having to work in those conditions and live on low salaries, these workers have a difficult time demanding their rights; Bangladeshi workers in Dhaka may be beaten by their employers while Cambodians are shot by police. In Dhaka, workers must work in hot and chemical-ridden environments and structurally unsound buildings. The film shows the events of the 2013 Savar building collapse when an eight-story commercial building named Rana Plaza collapsed. Just prior to that, workers had been forced into the factory even though a crack was seen in the walls. The Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh, an event that sparked Morgan's interest in making the film, is explored as an example of poor working conditions in developing countries. The film shows how the demand for cotton in India has led to the planting of genetically modified (GM) cotton, and how the monopoly inherent in its use by seed companies causes an increase in the price of cotton, leading to suicides among farmers who lose their land to these companies because they cannot pay the higher seed prices. GM crops need more pesticides, causing environmental damage, birth defects leading to mental and physical disabilities among the Punjab people, and an increased rate of cancer. The film claims that sometimes the companies that produce the pesticides are the same ones that produce the needed medications. A similar scenario occurs in contaminated cotton fields in Texas, where pesticides are causing brain tumors. The garment industry is the second-most- polluting industry the world, according to the film, which is illustrated by leather tanneries pouring chromium into the Ganges River in Kanpur, India. In the film, the focus returns to America, where it looks at how media affects the desire of people‚Äîespecially teenagers‚Äîto buy and create an identity focused on consumption. This is borne out by a 500% worldwide increase in clothing consumption compared to the 1990s. However, clothes are quickly disposed of; an average American wastes of textiles a year. Only 10% percent of donated clothes go to thrift shops; the rest go to landfills, such as those in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Aside from weakening local industries by this constant disposal of clothes, land and water are polluted because most apparel is made from non-biodegradable materials. Throughout the film, Morgan shows people who defend the low-cost prices such as Benjamin Powell of the Free Market Institute at Texas Tech University and Kate Ball-Young, former sourcing manager of Joe Fresh. Ball-Young says that, in comparison to more precarious alternative work, the fashion industry is a good choice for workers. Powell argues sweatshops are \\"part of the very process that raises living standards and leads to better working conditions over time\\". In contrast, the film shows a Texas organic cotton farmer, eco fashion activist Livia Firth and her sustainability-focused consulting firm, and people who manage fair trade clothing companies, such as animal-rights activist Stella McCartney, People Tree's Safia Minney, Redress's Christina Dean, and Patagonia's Vincent Stanley. Other individuals interviewed and appearing in the film include: television personalities Stephen Colbert and John Oliver, economist Richard D. Wolff, John Hilary of the charity War on Want, professor of media studies Mark Crispin Miller, psychologist Tim Kasser, physician Pritpal Singh, and environmentalists Rick Ridgeway and Vandana Shiva. Production The True Cost was produced by Morgan's Untold Creative in association with Life is My Movie Entertainment. The documentary's budget of was obtained through individual investors and Kickstarter, with Kickstarter crowd funders contributing . Morgan refused to accept money from companies, non-governmental organizations, and foundations to keep the project \\"autonomous\\". During a two- year period beginning in October 2013, Morgan traveled to twenty-five cities in thirteen countries, where he collected information and conducted interviews. Some of the interviews were made possible through the efforts of executive producer Livia Firth, who introduced Morgan to eco-fashion. Morgan had planned to interview Firth, but when she learned about the project she became interested in it and recommended people for him to talk to. Firth became heavily involved with the project, and after completing several interviews with her, Morgan showed Firth the final cut and made her an executive producer for the film. He had also planned to conduct interviews with 25 \\"major\\" brands, but none of them agreed to appear in the film. With no knowledge of the fashion industry, Morgan decided to make a film on the topic after being shocked by the news of the collapse of Rana Plaza. After spending several days getting information, and discovering the industry's human rights violations and \\"staggering environmental impacts\\", he was sure he had to make the film. He had also previously had an appreciation for the genre, saying he was \\"actually fascinated by those [fashion] films that follow one person\\". Like Morgan a non-connoisseur of fashion, executive producer and eco-activist Lucy Siegle said that she does not like such films as they are usually limited to exploring the aesthetic aspects of the industry. It is The True Cost differential in her opinion; it \\"goes there and then someit unravels the grim, gritty, global supply chain of fast fashion\\". Nevertheless, the film purposely does not give viewers a clear answer on how to solve the problems as there are \\"no straightforward answers\\". Morgan commented, \\"I'm probably most proud that we avoided easy answers and instead chose to trust people to both feel and think deeply about the issues raised.\\" Regarding the ultimate objectives behind the making of the film, Morgan said he was not trying to blame just a single company nor the fast fashion industry as \\"it did not invent a very irresponsible way of manufacturing, it did not invent overmarketing the consumption of things.\\" The director said the film was intended to be a caution on the \\"incessant consumption of mediocre stuff\\" and an incentive to view shopping as something more than a hobby, adding that buying is \\"a moral act and there is a chain reaction of consequences\\". He commented he was not trying to be \\"anti-business or anti-market\\" but was just reaffirming basic human rights and showing the limits of natural resources. Morgan said his main hope for the film was that it would spark a debate on the topic and make people \\"more mindful and choose things that support life and not take it away.\\" Morgan thought he had included a good number of counter-examples of how people can make a difference, so the film does not simply show \\"the destructive ways this industry operates but also the opportunity to reinvent it\\" through \\"small choices [that] actually impact those [big problems].\\" Ultimately, he considered his film an introduction to the topic that was able to connect several elements, any one of which would be worth being covered in a film. Release and response To coincide with Fashion Revolution Day, which seeks transparency in clothes production, the trailer of The True Cost was released on April24, 2015. It premiered at Cannes as a side screening during the 2015 Cannes Film Festival on May15, when film producer Harvey Weinstein said, \\"This movie's going to shock the fashion world\\". A week before the official release, the crowd funders received personal links to allow them watch the film. Distributed by Life is My Movie and Bullfrog Films, It was released on May29 through iTunes, video on demand services, DVD, Blu-Ray, and in select theaters in Los Angeles, New York, Tokyo, and London. It has since been translated into 19 languages. After its release, companies that were subjects of the film, including H&M; and Zara, defended themselves in a CNBC article. The film has been subject to dissonant reviews that ranged from extremely positive to very dismissive. Aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes says there were five positive reviews and three negative reviewswhich indicates that 63% of critics were favorableand that it received an average score of 6.3. Based on one positive, two mixed, and one negative review, Metacritic assigns an average score of 46 out of 100. It also received an Environmental Media Awards nomination for Best Documentary Film. The New York Times reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis praised it for avoiding the dichotomy of \\"corporate greed versus environmental well-being\\", adding that instead of being an expos√©, \\"Under the gentle, humane investigations of its director, what emerges most strongly is a portrait of exploitation that ought to make us more nauseated than elated over those $20 jeans\\". Tamsin Blanchard, for the Daily Telegraph, called it a work that will \\"do for the fast fashion business what Food Inc did for fast food\\". The Hollywood Reporters Frank Scheck commended it for approaching an issue often \\"untouched by major news organizations\\". He said the film was \\"more despair-inducing than instructive\\", but was optimistic about its possible impact on the fashion culture, citing the effect that films such as Super Size Me and Fast Food Nation had on the fast food industry. Carson Quiros of Paste also compared it to the former film. David Noh of Film Journal International called it a \\"vitally important documentary\\" that contains scenes that \\"are enough to make you never want to go shopping again\\". Gabrielle Wilson of MTV stated it is \\"hard to swallow but never feels preach-y or like a barrage of depressive factoids\\" and will empower viewers to change their shopping habits. Casey Jarman said she was disappointed by \\"the only solution offered: eliminating global capitalism\\"; however, ultimately, she wrote for Willamette Week that it is a \\"compelling film, which is, above all else, a badly needed conversation-starter\\". Alan Scherstuhl wrote a very critical piece for The Village Voice; he called the film predictable and repetitive, and said it contained several facts that have been clearly \\"common knowledge for years\\". Scherstuhl said it is scattershot, \\"a litany of Things We Can All Agree Are Bad\\", but ultimately jumps between several topicswithout sufficient detail, in his opinionbut comes to no conclusion or alternative. Scherstuhl said not even common people would have their beliefs challenged and that they would \\"dismiss it as the vague liberal agitprop that it is\\". Similarly, while saying the film discusses important issues, both Genevieve Koski of The Dissolve and Jennie Kermode of Eye for Film said it deals with several themes quickly but does not expand upon any of them. Koski said, \\"The True Cost is methodical to a fault\\", while Kermode said it is \\"a good starting point\\" on the topic. Fashion critic Vanessa Friedman said it has an \\"easy-to- swallow accessibility\\" but that it \\"oversimplifies\\" some aspects of the industry. In addition to commenting on the lack of attribution for \\"lots of eye-popping statements\\", she said, \\"trying to do everything, he skirted a lot of things\\". The Los Angeles Timess Martin Tsai criticized Morgan for interviewing his own executive producers, saying \\"the effects of fertilizers ... don't appear quite as tangible\\", and faulted Morgan for not exploring \\"retailer markups that could have gone toward improving sweatshop conditions instead of profit margins\\", but appreciated that he had interviewed people with both pro and con views. Lizzie Crocker of The Daily Beast said Morgan had socialist views and that the film implies he wants to go back to the 1960s. She also criticized some interviewees, such as Miller, whom she called a \\"conspiracy theorist\\", and Wolff, whom she called a \\"Marxist idealist\\". Crocker was dismissive of the film, saying, \\"the film loses focus and credibility, criticizing not just the fashion industry but the global capitalist system that supports it\\".

He played Australian rules football with South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Football career Tampion, a wingman recruited from the University Blues in the Victorian Amateur Football Association, played 16 VFL games for South Melbourne over three seasons, from 1958 to 1960. His most noted moment as a footballer was a goal he kicked during the 1958 VFL season, in which he made a career high nine appearances. In South Melbourne's round 16 win over St Kilda at Junction Oval, Tampion received a free kick as the three-quarter time siren sounded. As he was the centre wing around 80-yards from goal, he decided he was too far out and handed the ball to the umpire, only to be told by South Melbourne's coach Ron Clegg that he should take the kick. Tampion, who had the wind behind him, kicked a drop punt which cleared the surprised St Kilda defenders who had not pushed back. St Kilda's Bob Kupsch raced back towards the goals but the ball beat him to register what was described in The Age as the goal of the season. He made two appearances for South Melbourne in the 1959 season, then a further five in the 1960 season. In 1961 he played reserves football for the Carlton Football Club. Scientology Tampion was also a high-profile Scientologist who fought legal proceedings to have Scientology recognised in Australia as a church. He had his first contact with Scientology in 1958 and said that it helped him in his football career. Previously a school teacher, Tampion became a professional scientologist in 1961. He was the technical director of Scientology in Victoria. In 1965 a Victorian Board of Inquiry banned the practise of Scientology. With his partner Judy, Tampion set up the Church of the New Faith in Melbourne in 1968, which was able to circumvent these laws. He later sued Justice Kevin Anderson for loss and damages, a result of the Board of Inquiry which he headed. Tampion believed both Anderson and the counsel assisting were biased and went beyond their proper terms of reference. In the writ, Tampion claimed the judges had shown misfeasance, breach of duty and recklessness. The lawsuit was dismissed in the Supreme Court as \\"frivolous and vexatious\\" and an \\"abuse of the process of the court\\". Death Tampion died of cancer at the age of 59.

The buildings in downtown Vermont functioned as the village's shopping and entertainment district as well as the home of fraternal halls such as the Vermont Masonic Hall. While commercial development in Vermont began in the 1840s, the oldest surviving building in the district dates to circa 1858; the building has a Greek Revival design, as was common among Vermont's early commercial buildings. A major building boom took place in the late 1860s and 1870s due to the village's rising population and railroad service; most buildings from this period have Italianate designs. Another building boom in the late 1880s and early 1890s brought several new Late Victorian buildings to the district. After the turn of the century, a number of Commercial style buildings were constructed as well. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 24, 1997.

He was one of the founders of \\"V√´llaz√´ria\\" (Brotherhood) society, established in 1910 in Cairo, and the Beni Suef branch of it with the support of the Khedive office. Du√ßi also started and directed several press organs of the Albanian diaspora in Egypt, mostly short-lived. These included the magazines Toska (The Tosk) during 1901‚Äì02, Besa-Bes√´ (Pledge for a pledge) during 1904‚Äì05 together with Thoma Avrami, Besa (Besa) of 1905 which lasted for 6 issues and was printed by Al-Tawfik in Cairo, and newspapers Shqip√´ria (Albania) from October 1906 to February 1907, a daily of Cairo with the last two issues coming out in Maghagha, and the weekly Bisedimet (The discussions) of 1925‚Äì26 with 60 issues in total, which would be the last Albanian-language newspaper in Egypt. He wrote several articles regarding the necessity for a unified literary Albanian language and the cultural-literary development of the Albanian society. In 1922 he established the publishing company Sht√´pia botonj√´se shqiptare/Soci√©t√© Albanaise d'√©dition (Albanian Publishing House). He also left his footprint as a playwright; some of his comedies were E Th√´na (The saying), Gjaku (The blood), I biri i Begut (Bey's son). He also wrote short stories and poetry in the local press in Egypt. In addition to the Albanian patriotic activity, Du√ßi was a successful entrepreneur. His family emerged as an important player in the economic development of Egypt's Delta region directed by Lord Cromer's office. By 1901, he started working with his well-connected uncle Loni Logori on projects that explicitly tied the commercial interest of the British administration and the local landowners. Beside British, he openly solicited Austro-Hungarian support, despite of the distrust that many Eastern Orthodox south-Albanians had for the Austrian Geo-politics. Toska's initial failure did not dissuade the Austrian authorities to support him; in 1902 they sent him 120 krone for the subscription, ordering the newspaper to be shipped to Vienna from where it would get distributed to Ottoman Albania. Through his uncle, Du√ßi would also get in touch with the Albanian √©migr√© in Bucharest, Italy, Istanbul, and Brussels. The French consul in Shkod√´r reported that Du√ßi collaborated with a defrocked Catholic priest named Gaspar Jakova Merturi who secured funds from a claimant for the Albanian throne, Prince Albert Ghica of Romania. He also collaborated closely with the Arberesh journalist Anselmo Lorecchio, editor of La Nazione Albanese.

After moving from Harvard Medical School in 1960, Magasanik spent the rest of his research career at MIT, including an influential decade as the head of the Department of Biology from 1967‚Äì77. Magasanik's research interests focused on gene regulation, including study of nitrogen metabolic regulation in bacteria, catabolite repression, and intracellular signaling via two-component systems. Magasanik retired in 1990 and died in 2013. Early life and education Magasanik was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine on December 19, 1919, to a family he later described as \\"belonging to the capitalist class\\" and who left for Vienna after Kharkiv was captured by Communist forces during the then-ongoing Ukrainian civil war. Raised in Vienna, Magasanik began his university education studying chemistry in 1937, but was unable to continue due to the Anschluss in 1938, in which Jews were expelled from Austrian universities. He then emigrated to New York City, where his sister and her husband had moved a year prior, and there completed his studies at the City College of New York, from which he graduated in 1941. Magasanik began graduate education at Pennsylvania State University, but was interrupted by the United States' entry into World War II. As Magasanik later recalled, other recent chemistry graduates of the period were able to find jobs in the defense industry, but as he was not yet eligible for American citizenship, he was instead drafted into the army and ultimately spent four years serving as a medical technician. After leaving the army Magasanik returned to Ph.D. studies, this time at Columbia University under the direction of Erwin Chargaff. Magasanik received his Ph.D. in 1948. Asked years later to write a brief autobiography about his life in science, Magasanik described his early life as \\"almost entirely determined by the political events of the period between the two world wars and by World War II.\\" Academic career Magasanik was recruited to a position at Harvard Medical School by J. Howard Mueller and began his faculty career there in 1949, advancing to a tenured position in the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology in 1958. During this period he spent a sabbatical at the Pasteur Institute with Jacques Monod thanks to a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1960, Magasanik was recruited from Harvard to MIT by noted microbiologist Salvador Luria, who sought to raise the MIT Department of Biology's profile in molecular biology. In 1967, Magasanik became the head of the Department of Biology, a position in which he served until 1977. His leadership during this period, especially in decision-making about new faculty hires, has been widely cited as contributing to the success of the department in the molecular biology field. Magasanik became the Jacques Monod Professor of Biology in 1977. After being succeeded by Gene Brown as department head, Magasanik concentrated on research and teaching rather than administrative work until his retirement in 1990, when he became professor emeritus. In 1969, Magasanik became a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, from which he received the Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology in 1993. Teaching Magasanik was known as a skilled and committed educator of undergraduates, and in fact cited the opportunity to teach undergraduate courses as one reason for his move from Harvard Medical School to MIT. During his career at MIT he was engaged in redevelopment of the undergraduate biology curriculum and continued to teach undergraduate courses for several years after his retirement. Personal life Magasanik met his first wife, Adele Karp, when both were graduate students at Columbia; they were married in 1949. Karp was also a researcher at Harvard and later worked with Magasanik at MIT, though she retired from science in the early 1960s to care for her elderly mother. The couple became avid art collectors, with particular interest in African art, and also enjoyed opera and extensive travel. Karp died of lung cancer in 1991. Magasanik married Helen Donis-Keller, a scientist and artist, in 1996. On December 25, 2013, Magasanik died in Cambridge, Massachusetts at age 94.

At trial, the prosecution used peremptory challenges to strike all Black and Hispanic jurors who were available for jury service. The trial court judge allowed the prosecution to explain the basis for the peremptory challenges outside the presence of Ayala's counsel, \\"so as not to disclose trial strategy\\".Davis, slip op. at 1. Ayala was ultimately sentenced to death, but he filed several appeals challenging the constitutionality of the trial court's decision to exclude his counsel from the hearings.Davis, slip op. at 4‚Äì8. In a 5‚Äì4 opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, the Supreme Court held that even if the trial court committed error, the error was harmless and that Ayala did not suffer any actual prejudice.Davis, slip op. at 9‚Äì10, 28‚Äì29. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion in which she argued that Ayala's sentence should be reversed because the exclusion of Ayala's counsel from the hearings \\"substantially influenced the outcome\\" of the case.Davis, slip op. at 15 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Additionally, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he questioned the propriety of Ayala's placement in solitary confinement.Davis, slip op. at 1‚Äì5 (Kennedy, J., concurring). In response, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a one- paragraph concurring opinion in which he stated that Ayala's accommodations were \\"far sight more spacious than those in which his victims ... now rest\\".Davis, slip op. at 1 (Thomas, J., concurring). Commentators have described the case as \\"important\\" and note that will likely have a \\"significant effect\\" on similar cases in the future.See, e.g., Brandon Garrett, UVA Law Faculty Comment on Supreme Court Decisions, ; Steve Vladeck, Opinion analysis: How habeas courts should assess harmless error in a procedural Batson challenge, (Jun. 18, 2015, 2:33 PM). However, some analysts have described the outcome as \\"particularly unjust\\".Lincoln Caplan, The Destruction of Defendants' Rights, (June 21, 2015). Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion also received significant coverage from the media,Steve Vladeck, Opinion analysis: How habeas courts should assess harmless error in a procedural Batson challenge, (Jun. 18, 2015, 2:33 PM) (noting that the case was \\"noteworthy for an unusually testy exchange between two of the Justices in the majority\\"); Mark Joseph Stern, 20 Years in a Windowless Cell, (June 19, 2015) (discussing significance of Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion). and some analysts suggested that solitary confinement may become a \\"new battleground\\" for Justice Kennedy.Matt Ford, Justice Kennedy Denounces Solitary Confinement, (June 18, 2015). One commentator described Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion as \\"the single most surprising and heartening development of the term\\".Marty Lederman, Supreme Court Breakfast Table, (July 2, 2015). Legal Background =Batson challenges= In Batson v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution occurs when prosecutors use peremptory challenges to exclude jurors on the basis of race.Batson v. Kentucky, ; see also Swain v. Alabama, (holding that the \\"purposeful or deliberate\\" of Black jurors violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment). If a defendant alleges that a prosecutor challenged a prospective juror on the basis of that juror's race (a process known as a \\"Batson challenge\\"), trial courts will conduct a three-part analysis of the peremptory challenge in question: \\"[f]irst, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race; second, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question; and third, in light of the parties‚Äô submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.\\"Snyder v. Louisiana, (internal quotations and alterations omitted). A court will only sustain a Batson challenge if all three elements of this test are satisfied.Miller-El v. Cockrell, On appeal, a trial court's findings with respect to a Batson challenge will only be reversed if a trial court judge committed clear error.Rice v. Collins, Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that findings with respect to a prosecutor's explanation of the reasons for their use of peremptory challenges is \\"entitled to 'great deference'\\".Felkner v. Jackson, (per curiam). =The right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus under federal law= When individuals are convicted for crimes under state law, those individuals have the right to challenge the constitutionality of their convictions in federal court by petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus.See U.S. Const. art. I, ¬ß 9, cl. 2 (recognizing a right to habeas corpus); Claudia Wilner, \\"We Would Not Defer to That Which Did Not Exist:\\" AEDPA Meets the Silent State Court Opinion, 77 1442, 1445 (2002) (discussing the history of habeas corpus in the United States). This right was codified by the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867,Habeas Corpus Act, 14 Stat. 385 (1867). and in 1953, the United States Supreme Court held that even when a state court rules against a prisoner, that individual still has the right to seek de novo review of their constitutional claims in federal court.Brown v. Allen, . However, in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\\"AEDPA\\")Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (codified, in part, at 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2254). in 1996 to modify federal habeas corpus procedures.Stephen R. Reinhardt, The Demise of Habeas Corpus and the Rise of Qualified Immunity: The Court's Ever Increasing Limitations on the Development and Enforcement of Constitutional Rights and Some Particularly Unfortunate Consequences, 113 1219, 1224 (2015) (discussing origins of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act). Under the AEDPA's new standards, when a prisoner's claim has been adjudicated in state court, that individual's petition for habeas corpus shall not be granted unless the state court decision \\"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\\".28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2254(d)(1). In 2007, the United States Supreme Court held that, as a \\"precondition\\" for relief under the AEDPA, habeas petitioners must demonstrate evidence that a state court's error resulted in \\"actual prejudice\\".Fry v. Pliler, . =Federal harmless error doctrine= The Supreme Court of the United States has identified a narrow range of errors that require automatic reversal; for all other errors, the decision of a lower court will be upheld if the error was harmless.Glebe v. Frost, No. 14-95, 574 U.S. ____ (2014), slip op. at 3 (per curiam). In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in Chapman v. California that a constitutional error will only be considered harmless when the court is \\"able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\\".Chapman v. California, . Additionally, when reviewing federal habeas corpus petitions, a petitioner must demonstrate that an error \\"had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict\\".Brecht v. Abrahamson, . The Supreme Court has also ruled that when reviewing a determination of harmlessness under Chapman, the AEDPA mandates that the reviewing court may not grant a petition for habeas corpus \\"unless the harmlessness determination itself was unreasonable\\".Fry, 551 U.S. at 119 (emphasis in original). According to the Supreme Court, the rationale underlying this doctrine is the public policy concern that states courts should not be forced to undertake the \\"arduous task\\" of retrying criminal defendants \\"based on mere speculation that the defendant was prejudiced by trial error\\".Calderon v. Coleman, (per curiam). Arrest and Trial of Hector Ayala Hector Ayala was charged with three counts of murder that allegedly occurred during an attempted robbery of an automobile body shop in San Diego, California in April 1985.Davis, slip op. at 2. During jury selection, the prosecution used peremptory challenges to strike all Black and Hispanic jurors who were available for jury service. Ayala, who was of Hispanic descent, filed a series of Batson challenges to contest the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges.Davis, slip op. at 2‚Äì4. The trial judge permitted the prosecution to explain the basis of their peremptory challenges in a closed hearing, outside the presence of Ayala's counsel, \\"so as not to disclose trial strategy\\".Davis, slip op. at 1, 2‚Äì4. The trial court ultimately concluded that the peremptory challenges were based on race-neutral criteria, and Ayala was convicted of the three counts of murder in August 1989.Davis, slip op. at 3‚Äì4. The jury returned a sentence of death for the three murder convictions, and the trial judge entered a judgment consistent with the jury's sentence.Davis, slip op. at 4. On direct appeal, the California Supreme Court upheld Ayala's conviction and sentence, noting that even if the trial judge committed an error when considering the defense's Batson challenges, that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.Davis, slip op. at 5 (citing People v. Ayala, 24 Cal. 4th 243 (2000)). Ayala subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus, which was denied by a district court judge in 2006.Davis, slip op. at 7. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted Ayala's habeas petition in 2013, holding that Ayala was denied due process at trial and that the trial court's error was not harmless.Davis, slip op. at 7‚Äì8; In 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's ruling.Davis, slip op. at 9. Opinion of the Court In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito (pictured) held that Ayala did not suffer \\"actual prejudice\\".Davis, slip op. at 28‚Äì29. In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito held that the exclusion of Ayala's counsel during the Batson hearings was harmless error.Davis, slip op. at 12‚Äì28, 29. Justice Alito emphasized that under federal law, prisoners are not entitled to habeas relief unless they can demonstrate \\"actual prejudice\\".Davis, slip op. at 9‚Äì10 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Additionally, Justice Alito noted that under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, federal courts should be \\"highly deferential\\" to state courts \\"when a prisoner's 'claim' has been 'adjudicated on the merits' in state court\\".Davis, slip op. at 10‚Äì11 (citing 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2254(d); Harrington v. Richter, ). Applying these standards to the facts of this case, Justice Alito ruled that Ayala did not suffer any actual prejudice and that the California Supreme Court's opinion \\"represented an entirely reasonable application of controlling precedent\\". Consequently, Justice Alito held that the Ninth Circuit's ruling should be reversed and that the case should be remanded for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision.Davis, slip op. at 29. =Concurring opinions= Although he noted that his support for the majority's opinion was \\"unqualified\\", Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he questioned the propriety of solitary confinement.Davis, slip op. at 1‚Äì4 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice Kennedy observed that since 1989, Ayala had spent more than twenty five years in solitary confinement.Davis, slip op. at 1 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Although the conditions of Ayala's confinement were not established in the record, Justice Kennedy wrote that \\"it is likely [he] has been held for all or most of the past 20 years or more in a windowless cell no larger than a typical parking spot for 23 hours a day; and in the one hour when he leaves it, he likely is allowed little or no opportunity for conversation or interaction with anyone\\".Davis, slip op. at 1 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (citing Wilkinson v. Austin, ; Amnesty International, Entombed: Isolation in the U. S. Federal Prison System (2014)). Justice Kennedy wrote that \\"[t]he human toll wrought by extended terms of isolation long has been understood, and questioned, by writers and commentators\\" and that solitary confinement \\"bears a further terror and peculiar mark of infamy\\".Davis, slip op. at 2 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (internal quotations omitted) (citing In re Medley, ). Justice Kennedy conceded that \\"in some instances temporary, solitary confinement is a useful or necessary means to impose discipline and to protect prison employees and other inmates\\", but that courts should ultimately determine \\"whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them\\".Davis, slip op. at 4 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate, one-paragraph concurring opinion to respond to Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion. He wrote that the \\"accommodations in which Ayala is housed are a far sight more spacious than those in which his victims, Ernesto Dominguez Mendez, Marcos Antonio Zamora, and Jose Luis Rositas, now rest\\". Justice Thomas also noted that because Ayala's victims were all 31 years of age or younger, \\"Ayala will soon have had as much or more time to enjoy those accommodations as his victims had time to enjoy this Earth\\". =Justice Sotomayor's dissenting opinion= Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion in which she was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Stephen Breyer, and Justice Elena Kagan.Davis, slip op. at 1 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Justice Sotomayor argued that the exclusion of Ayala's counsel from the Batson hearings \\"substantially influenced the outcome\\" of the case and that \\"grave doubt exists as to whether [the exclusion] was harmless\\".Davis, slip op. at 1, 15 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). She critiqued Justice Alito's methodological approach, arguing that \\"[t]he proper inquiry is not whether the trial court‚Äôs determination can be sustained, but whether it may have been different had counsel been present\\". Considering the evidence presented in this case, Justice Sotomayor concluded that there \\"is neither a factual nor a legal basis for the Court‚Äôs confidence\\" that the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges was race neutral. She argued that in light of \\"the strength of Ayala‚Äôs prima facie case\\", the Court should have upheld the Ninth Circuit's ruling. Commentary and analysis Following the release of the Court's opinion, commentators described Davis v. Ayala as \\"an important case raising claims about jury selection and harmless error\\".Brandon Garrett, UVA Law Faculty Comment on Supreme Court Decisions, . Steve Vladeck wrote that \\"[g]oing forward, the dispute between the majority and dissent will have an especially significant effect on cases in which trial courts conduct Batson proceedings ex parte\\".Steve Vladeck, Opinion analysis: How habeas courts should assess harmless error in a procedural Batson challenge, (Jun. 18, 2015, 2:33 PM).

Ayala: Post-conviction review of Batson, Harmless Error, and a Surprising Dignity Opinion from Justice Kennedy, (June 18, 2015). In his review of the case for The New Yorker, Lincoln Caplan described the Court's opinion as \\"particularly unjust\\" because the Court \\"had the opportunity to hold a state prosecutor to account for using trumped-up reasons to justify racial discrimination in a jury selection\\" but failed to do so. =Commentary about Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion= Much of the initial commentary about the case focused on Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion.See, e.g., Steve Vladeck, Opinion analysis: How habeas courts should assess harmless error in a procedural Batson challenge, (Jun. 18, 2015, 2:33 PM) (noting that the case was \\"noteworthy for an unusually testy exchange between two of the Justices in the majority\\"). Writing for the Los Angeles Times, David G. Savage described Justice Kennedy's opinion as \\"unusual\\" and \\"a rare instance of a Supreme Court justice virtually inviting a constitutional challenge to a prison policy\\".David G. Savage, Justice Kennedy practically invites a challenge to solitary confinement, (June 19, 2015). Marty Lederman described Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion as \\"the single most surprising and heartening development of the term\\". Matt Ford wrote that \\"Kennedy‚Äôs critique of solitary confinement in Davis came without warning or fanfare\\" and that \\"[s]olitary confinement is a new battleground for the Court‚Äôs second-longest serving justice, but not a surprising one\\". Although he suggested Justice Kennedy's concurrence may be \\"more consequential\\" than Justice Harry Blackmun's dissent in Callins v. Collins,Callins v. Collins, (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (\\"From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death.\\"). Mark Joseph Stern described Justice Kennedy's concurrence as \\"myopic\\", noting that \\"large chunks of the 'legal academy' in the 'public' were aware‚Äîand outraged‚Äîby the practice long before Kennedy condemned it\\".Mark Joseph Stern, 20 Years in a Windowless Cell, (June 19, 2015).

Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155 (2015), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court clarified when municipalities may impose content-based restrictions on signage. The case also clarified the level of constitutional scrutiny that should be applied to content-based restrictions on speech. In 2005, Gilbert, Arizona adopted a municipal sign ordinance that regulated the manner in which signs could be displayed in public areas. The ordinance imposed stricter limitations on signs advertising religious services than signs that displayed \\"political\\" or \\"ideological\\" messages. When the town's Sign Code compliance manager cited a local church for violating the ordinance, the church filed a lawsuit in which they argued the town's sign regulations violated its First Amendment right to the freedom of speech. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the town's sign ordinance imposed content-based restrictions that did not survive strict scrutiny because the ordinance was not narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest.Reed v. Town of Gilbert, No. 13-502, 576 U.S. ___, slip op. at 15, 17 (2015). Justice Thomas also clarified that strict scrutiny should always be applied when a law is content-based on its face.Reed, slip op. at 8. Justice Stephen Breyer and Justice Elena Kagan both wrote opinions concurring in the judgment, in which they argued that content- based regulations should not always automatically trigger strict scrutiny.Reed, slip op. at 1 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment); Reed, slip op. at 3 (Kagan, J., concurring in judgment). Although some commentators praised the court's decision as a victory for \\"individual liberty\\",See, e.g., David A. Cortman, Supreme Court Decision Ensures Fair Playing Field In Marketplace of Ideas, JURIST (August 4, 2015). other commentators criticized the Court's methodology.See, e.g., Hadley Arkes, Victory in Spite of Ourselves, (June 20, 2015). Some analysts have also suggested that the case left open several important questions within First Amendment jurisprudence that may be re-litigated in future years.See, e.g., Steve Butler, The Importance of Bringing Your Sign Code Up-to-Date, (October 29, 2015); Eugene Volokh, Supreme Court reaffirms broad prohibition on content-based speech restrictions, in today‚Äôs Reed v. Town of Gilbert decision, (June 18, 2015). Background =Content-based restrictions on speech= The First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits states from enacting laws that abridge the freedom of speech.U.S. Const. amend. I; see also Gitlow v New York 368 U.S. 652 (1925) (incorporating First Amendment protections for freedom of expression to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution). Municipal governments may not \\"restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content\\".Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972). Laws that regulate speech based on the expressive content of the speech are presumptively unconstitutional; such restrictions are only permissible when they are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 395 (1992); Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115, 118 (1991). For the purposes of the First Amendment, government regulation of speech is considered \\"content- based\\" when it targets speech because of ideas or messages that are expressed.Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 462 (1980); Mosley, 408 U.S. at 95. Furthermore, some laws may still be considered \\"content-based\\" even though they appear to be facially content-neutral.Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Laws are considered \\"content-based\\" if they cannot be \\"justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech\\" or if they were adopted \\"because of disagreement with the message [the speech] conveys\\".Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. at 791. =Gilbert, Arizona municipal sign ordinance= In 2005, the town of Gilbert, Arizona adopted a municipal sign ordinance that regulated the manner in which signs could be displayed in public areas.Reed, slip op. at 1 (citing Gilbert, Ariz., Land Development Code, ch. 1, ¬ß4.402 (2005)). Although the ordinance banned the display of most outdoor signs without a permit, twenty three categories of signs were exempt from the permit requirement.Reed, slip op. at 1‚Äì2. Three of those categories were relevant to this case.Reed, slip op. at 2. First, \\"ideological signs\\", which contained \\"a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes\\", could be up to twenty square feet in size and could be placed in any \\"zoning district\\" for any length of time.Reed, slip op. at 2 (citing Gilbert, Ariz., Land Development Code, ch. 1, ¬ß4.402(J)) (internal quotations omitted). Second, \\"political signs\\", which included content \\"designed to influence the outcome of an election called by a public body\\", could be no larger than thirty two square feet on nonresidential property and sixteen square feet on residential property.Reed, slip op. at 2 (citing Gilbert, Ariz., Land Development Code, ch. 1, ¬ß4.402(I)) (internal quotations omitted). Additionally, political signs could only be displayed \\"up to 60 days before a primary election and up to 15 days following a general election\\".Reed, slip op. at 2 (citing Gilbert, Ariz., Land Development Code, ch. 1, ¬ß4.402(I)). Third, ‚Äútemporary directional signs relating to a qualifying event\\", which directed \\"pedestrians, motorists, and other passersby\\" to events hosted by non-profit organizations, could be no larger than six square feet.Reed, slip op. at 3 (citing Gilbert, Ariz., Land Development Code, ch. 1, ¬ß4.402(P)) (internal quotations omitted). Additionally, temporary directional signs relating to a qualifying event could be displayed no earlier than twelve hours before the start of a qualifying event and no later than one hour after the end of the event; these signs could only be displayed in private property or public rights-of-way, but no more than four signs could be placed on a single property at the same time.Reed, slip op. at 3 (citing Gilbert, Ariz., Land Development Code, ch. 1, ¬ß4.402(P)). =Good News Community Church= Downtown Gilbert, Arizona (pictured), the town in which the lawsuit originated. The named plaintiff, Clyde Reed, is the pastor of Good News Community Church.Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 832 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1073 (D. Ariz. 2011), withdrawn from bound volume, aff'd sub nom. Reed v. Town of Gilbert, Ariz., 707 F.3d 1057 (9th Cir. 2013) rev'd and remanded, 135 S. Ct. 2218, 192 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2015) The church is a \\"small, cash-strapped entity that own[ed] no building\\" and held services in elementary schools and other buildings in Gilbert, Arizona.Reed, slip op. at 3. On the original docket, the name was Good News Presbyterian Church because according to Reed, the church's name has actually \\"vacillated\\" between that and Good News Community Church.Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 832 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1073 fn.1 (D. Ariz. 2011), withdrawn from bound volume, aff'd sub nom. Reed v. Town of Gilbert, Ariz., 707 F.3d 1057 (9th Cir. 2013) rev'd and remanded, 135 S. Ct. 2218, 192 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2015) Because the briefs had used \\"Community\\", the District Court used it as well. To advertise their services, the church placed fifteen-to-twenty temporary signs in various locations around Gilbert.Reed, slip op. at 3‚Äì4. The signs would typically include the church's name as well as the location and time of services.Reed, slip op. at 4. Members of the church \\"would post the signs early in the day on Saturday and then remove them around midday on Sunday\\". However, the town's Sign Code compliance manager cited the church on two occasions, for exceeding time limits when displaying signs and for failing to include the date of the event on a sign, respectively. = Initial lawsuit = The church filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona in March 2008, where they claimed the town \\"abridged their freedom of speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments\\".Reed, slip op. at 4; Reed v. Town of Gilbert, Ariz., 587 F.3d 966, 972 (9th Cir. 2009) The district court first denied the church's request for a preliminary injunction, and the church then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.Reed, slip op. at 4‚Äì5. The Ninth Circuit, analyzing the likelihood of success on the merits requirement for a preliminary injunction, affirmed the decision of the district court, holding that the town's restrictions for temporary directional signs \\"did not regulate speech on the basis of content\\"Reed, slip op. at 4 (citing Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 587 F.3d 966, 979 (9th Cir. 2009)). Although the Ninth Circuit conceded that enforcement officers would need to read a sign to determine which portions of the sign ordinance applied to the sign, the Ninth Circuit concluded that this \\"cursory examination\\" was not equivalent to \\"synthesizing the expressive content of the sign\\".Reed, slip op. at 5 (citing Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 587 F.3d at 978) (internal quotations omitted). The Ninth Circuit then remanded the case back to the district court to determine \\"in the first instance whether the Sign Code‚Äôs distinctions among temporary directional signs, political signs, and ideological signs nevertheless constituted a content-based regulation of speech.\\"Reed, slip op. at 5. =Remand and appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States= At a subsequent status conference after the appellate court decision, the parties decided to resolve all the issues on summary judgment, rather than via new preliminary injunction motions.Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 832 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1073-74 (D. Ariz. 2011), withdrawn from bound volume, aff'd sub nom. Reed v. Town of Gilbert, Ariz., 707 F.3d 1057 (9th Cir. 2013) rev'd and remanded, 135 S. Ct. 2218, 192 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2015) The United States District Court for the District of Arizona granted the Town's motion for summary judgment. The church then appealed that ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, but the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court, holding the town's ordinance was content neutral. Citing Hill v. Colorado, the Ninth Circuit ruled that \\"Gilbert did not adopt its regulation of speech because it disagreed with the message conveyed‚Äù and that the town's ‚Äúinterests in regulat[ing] temporary signs are unrelated to the content of the sign\\".Reed, slip op. at 5 (citing Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 707 F.3d 1057, 1071‚Äì72 (9th Cir. 2013)) (internal quotations omitted). Additionally, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the distinctions between ideological signs, political signs, and temporary directional signs were \\"based on objective factors relevant to Gilbert‚Äôs creation of the specific exemption from the permit requirement and do not otherwise consider the substance of the sign‚Äù.Reed, slip op. at 5 (citing Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 707 F.3d at 1069). Based on its determination that the ordinance was content-neutral, the Ninth Circuit \\"applied a lower level of scrutiny to the Sign Code\\" and held it did not violate the First Amendment.Reed, slip op. at 5 (citing Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 707 F.3d at 1073‚Äì76). The church then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on July 1, 2014.Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 134 S. Ct. 2900 (2014) (granting petition for certiorari). Opinion of the Court In his majority opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas emphasized that \\"innocent motives\\" do not eliminate the danger of censorship.Reed, slip op. at 10. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the town's sign ordinance was \\"content-based on its face\\" in light of the fact that the \\"restrictions in the Sign Code that apply to any given sign [depend] entirely on the communicative content of the sign\\".Reed, slip op. at 7. Because the church's signs were \\"treated differently from signs conveying other types of ideas\\", there was \\"no need to consider the government‚Äôs justifications or purposes for enacting the Code to determine whether it is subject to strict scrutiny\\". Justice Thomas rejected the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the ordinance was content-neutral because the regulations were not based on \\"disagree[ment] with the message conveyed\\" and the reasons for regulating the various categories of signs were \\"unrelated to the content of the sign[s]\\".Reed, slip op. at 8 (citing Reed, 707 F.3d, at 1071‚Äì72) (internal quotations omitted). Rather, he emphasized that \\"[a] law that is content-based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government‚Äôs benign motive, content-neutral justification, or lack of 'animus toward the ideas contained' in the regulated speech\\".Reed, slip op. at 8 (citing Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 429 (1993)). Justice Thomas explained that \\"innocent motives\\" do not eliminate the danger of censorship, because governments may one day use content-based laws to regulate \\"disfavored speech\\". Additionally, Justice Thomas rejected the town's assertion that a law is only content-based if it \\"censor[s] or favor[s]\\" specific viewpoints or ideas.Reed, slip op. at 11. The town argued that its sign code was not unconstitutional because it neither endorsed nor suppressed any particular viewpoints or ideas. However, Justice Thomas clarified that a statute is content-based if it singles out a specific subject, even though it may not target ideas or viewpoints within that subject matter.Reed, slip op. at 11‚Äì12. Furthermore, he also rejected the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the ordinance was content-neutral because it targeted specific classes of speakers, rather than the content of their speech.Reed, slip op. at 12‚Äì13. Although he recognized that speaker-based restrictions were only \\"the beginning ‚Äî not the end ‚Äî of the inquiry\\", Justice Thomas held that \\"laws favoring some speakers over others demand strict scrutiny when the legislature‚Äôs speaker preference reflects a content preference\\".Reed, slip op. at 13 (citing Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U S. 622, 658 (1994)). Because the ordinance imposed content-based restrictions on free speech, Justice Thomas held that the ordinance would only be constitutional if it survived strict scrutiny.Reed, slip op. at 14. Assuming that the town's interests of preserving aesthetic appeal and traffic safety were compelling, he concluded that these were \\"hopelessly underinclusive\\" because the ordinance allowed for the proliferation of an unlimited number of larger, ideological signs that pose the same threats to aesthetics and traffic as directional signs.Reed, slip op. at 15. In fact, Justice Thomas suggested that a \\"sharply worded\\" ideological sign may be more likely to distract drivers than a directional sign. Justice Thomas also suggested that some directional signs \\"may be essential, both for vehicles and pedestrians, to guide traffic or to identify hazards and ensure safety\\".Reed, slip op. at 16‚Äì17. Therefore, Justice Thomas remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the Court's opinion.Reed, slip op. at 17. =Justice Alito's concurring opinion= Justice Samuel Alito wrote a separate concurring opinion, in which he was joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Sonia Sotomayor.Reed, slip op. at 1 (Alito, J., concurring). He agreed that content-based regulations present the same dangers as viewpoint-based regulations because content-based regulations \\"may interfere with democratic self-government and the search for truth\\".Reed, slip op. at 1 (Alito, J., concurring) (citing Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 530, 537 (1980)). He also agreed that the town's ordinance was \\"replete with content-based distinctions\\" that were subject to strict scrutiny. However, Justice Alito wrote separately to emphasize that the Court's opinion would not \\"prevent cities from regulating signs in a way that fully protects public safety and serves legitimate esthetic objectives\\".Reed, slip op. at 1‚Äì2 (Alito, J., concurring). To support his argument, Justice Alito provided a list of examples of content-neutral sign regulations, including: regulations that target the size of signs, regulations that target the locations at which signs may be placed, regulations distinguishing between lighted and unlighted signs, regulations that distinguish between the placement of signs on public and private property, rules that restrict the total number of signs \\"per mile of roadway\\", and rules that distinguish between freestanding signs and signs that are attached to buildings. =Justice Breyer's opinion concurring in the judgment= Justice Stephen Breyer wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which he argued that content-based discrimination should be considered a \\"rule of thumb, rather than as an automatic 'strict scrutiny' trigger, leading to almost certain legal condemnation\\".Reed, slip op. at 1 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). Justice Breyer conceded that content- based regulations sometimes reveal weaknesses in the government's rationale for limiting speech, and that content-based regulations interfere with the \\"free marketplace of idea[s]\\".Reed, slip op. at 2 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). However, he also argued that \\"virtually all government activities involve speech\\", and many involve content-based regulations on speech. Therefore, he concluded that a rule triggering strict scrutiny for all cases involving content-based restrictions would be a \\"recipe for judicial management of ordinary government regulatory activity\\".Reed, slip op. at 2‚Äì3 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). Justice Breyer argued that instead of the automatic trigger, courts should determine the constitutionality of content-based regulations by \\"examining the seriousness of the harm to speech, the importance of the countervailing objectives, the extent to which the law will achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive ways of doing so\\". Although he did not believe strict scrutiny should be applied to the town's sign ordinance, he agreed that the town's ordinance was unconstitutional because the town did not provide a rational justification for treating some signs differently than others.Reed, slip op. at 5 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). =Justice Kagan's opinion concurring in the judgment= In her concurring opinion, Justice Elena Kagan cautioned that the Court may soon become \\"a veritable Supreme Board of Sign Review\\".Reed, slip op. at 6 (Kagan, J., concurring in judgment). Justice Elena Kagan also wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which she was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer.Reed, slip op. at 1 (Kagan, J., concurring in judgment). Like Justice Breyer, Justice Kagan argued that it was not necessary to apply strict scrutiny to all content-based restrictions on speech.Reed, slip op. at 3 (Kagan, J., concurring in judgment). She argued that the majority's opinion would jeopardize too many \\"entirely reasonable\\" existing sign ordinances across the country.Reed, slip op. at 1‚Äì2 (Kagan, J., concurring in judgment). In light of the court's opinion, Justice Kagan suggested that municipalities will now be forced to choose between repealing \\"exemptions that allow for helpful signs on streets and sidewalks\\" and lifting \\"sign restrictions altogether and resign[ing] themselves to the resulting clutter\\".Reed, slip op. at 2 (Kagan, J., concurring in judgment). Instead of applying strict scrutiny in every case, Justice Kagan claimed that strict scrutiny is only appropriate when there is a \\"realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot\\".Reed, slip op. at 3 (Kagan, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Likewise, she also claimed that strict scrutiny is not necessary when there is no risk that regulations will \\"skew the public‚Äôs debate of ideas\\".Reed, slip op. at 4 (Kagan, J., concurring in judgment) (citing Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U.S. 177, 188 (2007)). Applying these principles to this case, Justice Kagan held the ordinance \\"does not pass strict scrutiny, or intermediate scrutiny, or even the laugh test\\" because the town did not provide \\"any sensible basis\\" for the content-based distinctions within its sign ordinance. Analysis and commentary After the court issued its decision, some commentators praised the Court's ruling for \\"further[ing] individual liberty by striking down a government‚Äôs unjustified censorship of protected speech\\".See, e.g., Deborah J. LaFetra, Supreme Court victory for free speech: Reed v. Town of Gilbert, (June 18, 2015). David A.

Some analysts also claimed the majority's opinion left open unanswered questions within the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence.See, e.g., Steve Butler, The Importance of Bringing Your Sign Code Up-to-Date, (October 29, 2015) (noting that Reed \\"raises a lot of unanswered questions\\"). Lyle Denniston, for example, suggested that after the Court issued its decisions in Reed and Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, \\"the meaning of the First Amendment, in general, became somewhat more confusing\\".Lyle Denniston, Opinion analysis: The message determines the right, SCOTUSblog (June 18, 2015).

Owens, 574 U.S. 81 (2015), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States clarified procedures for removing a class action lawsuit from state court to federal court. The case involved a dispute about revenue from oil and gas leases in which the defendant filed a motion to remove the case from a state court in Kansas to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. However, the plaintiff argued that the defendant's motion was defective because the defendant's notice of removal did not include evidence demonstrating that the amount in controversy satisfied the jurisdictional threshold. The United States District Court for the District of Kansas ultimately ruled the case should be returned to the state court, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit declined to review the district court's decision. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg held that the defendant's notice of removal did not need to contain evidence of the amount in controversy because congress intended for courts to \\"apply the same liberal rules [to removal allegations] that are applied to other matters of pleading\\".Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co. v. Owens, no. 13-719, 574 U.S. ___, slip op. at 4-5, 7 (2015) (citing H. R. Rep. No. 100‚Äì889, p. 71 (1988) (internal quotations omitted) (alteration in original). Justice Ginsburg also held that the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion by declining to review the district court's ruling.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 7-14. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued the Court should dismiss the case as improvidently granted because the Court had \\"no basis\\" to determine whether the Tenth Circuit denied review for an impermissible reason.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 1, 7-8 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Justice Clarence Thomas also filed a separate dissenting opinion in which he argued the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction to review the Tenth Circuit's ruling because the decision to deny review was not a \\"case\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 1-2 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1254). Although some commentators expressed concern that the Court's ruling would cause \\"damage to the law of review\\",Ronald Mann, Opinion analysis: Court stretches to correct anachronistic Tenth Circuit pleading rule, (Dec. 16, 2014, 9:24 AM). others described it as a victory for attorneys who defend against class actions.Patrick H. Sims, Feature: Removing Diversity Cases: The Thrill Is Gone, 76 166, 169 (2015). Background =Removal jurisdiction in federal courts= Title 28 of the United States Code outlines procedures for transferring a case from state court to federal court.28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1446. When a defendant files a motion to remove a case from a state court to a federal court, the defendant must file a notice of removal that contains \\"a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal\\".28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1446(a). If a defendant wishes to remove a case on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, the amount in controversy must be in excess of $5 million for class actions or $75,000 for all other cases.28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1332. Additionally, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) allows litigants in a class action \\"to remove to federal court any sizable class action involving minimal diversity of citizenship\\" in accordance with the provisions set forth in 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1446.Smith v. Bayer Corp., 131 S.Ct. 2368, 2382 (2011). If the plaintiff's complaint specifies monetary damages, those damages are \\"deemed to be the amount in controversy\\", as long as they are asserted in good faith.28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1446(c)(2). If the complaint does not specify monetary damages, then the defendant may specify the amount in controversy in their notice of removal.28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1446(c)(2)(A). =Initial lawsuit= Brandon W. Owens filed a class action in the district court for Wilson County, Kansas to recover royalties that he claimed were owed to members of the class by Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Company, LLC, and Cherokee Basin Pipeline, LLC for oil and gas leases.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 2. Although he did not specify damages in his complaint, Owens requested \\"a fair and reasonable amount\\" to compensate the class for the alleged underpayments.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 2; Pet. for Cert., Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co. v. Owens, No. 13-719 (Dec. 13, 2013) at 12-13. The defendants then filed a motion to remove the case to federal district court, in which they stated the \\"purported underpayments to putative class members totaled more than $8.2 million\\". In response, Owens filed a motion to return the case to the Kansas state court on the grounds that the defendants produced \\"no evidence\\" to prove the amount in controversy was actually over the $5 million threshold.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 2 (internal quotations omitted). To support their motion, the defendants submitted a deceleration by one of their executive officers that indicated the amount in controversy was over $11 million, but Owens argued this declaration came too late and that deficient notice of removal \\"could not be cured by post-removal evidence about the amount in controversy\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 3 (internal quotations omitted). The United States District Court for the District of Kansas ruled the case should be returned to the state court, citing circuit precedent that held \\"factual allegations or evidence outside of the petition and notice of removal is not permitted to determine the amount in controversy\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 3. =Appeal to the Tenth Circuit= Although orders returning cases to state courts usually cannot be reviewed on appeal,28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1447(d). federal circuit courts of appeals may consider appeals involving the Class Action Fairness Act.28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1453(c)(1). Dart Cherokee filed a petition for review pursuant to this exception in United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, but the Tenth Circuit denied their petition. Dart Cherokee then filed a petition for en banc review, but a divided panel of Tenth Circuit judges denied Dart Cherokee's petition.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 3-4 (citing Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co., LLC v. Owens, 730 F.3d 1234 (10th Cir. 2013)). Judge Harris Hartz filed an opinion dissenting from denial of review en banc, in which he argued the Tenth Circuit's requirements for notices of removal were \\"even more onerous than the code pleading requirements that I had thought the federal courts abandoned long ago\\".Dart Cherokee, 730 F.3d at 1234. Judge Hartz concluded the Tenth Circuit had an \\"obligation\\" to grant review en banc \\"to provide clarity in this important area of the law\\".Dart Cherokee, 730 F.3d at 1238. After the Tenth Circuit denied review en banc, Dart Cherokee filed a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States, which was granted on April 7, 2014.Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co., LLC v. Owens, 134 S. Ct. 1788 (2014) (granting writ of certiorari). The Supreme Court later stated that the Court granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 4 (citing Ellenburg v. Spartan Motors Chassis, Inc., 519 F.3d 192, 200 (4th Cir. 2008); Laughlin v. Kmart Corp., 50 F.3d 871, 873 (10th Cir. 1995)). Opinion of the Court In her majority opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (pictured) held that evidence of the amount in controversy only needs to be included in a defendant's notice of removal when the plaintiff or the court challenges the defendant's allegations.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 7. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg held that a \\"short and plain\\" statement in a notice of removal need not contain evidentiary submissions.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 1-2, 14. Justice Ginsburg stated that the notice requirements in 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1446 are modeled after the general pleading requirements in Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and that congress intended for courts to \\"apply the same liberal rules [to removal allegations] that are applied to other matters of pleading\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 4-5 (citing H. R. Rep. No. 100‚Äì889, p. 71 (1988) (internal quotations omitted) (alteration in original). Because a plaintiff's \\"amount-in-controversy allegation is accepted if made in good faith,\\" Justice Ginsburg argued that \\"when a defendant seeks federal-court adjudication, the defendant‚Äôs amount-in-controversy allegation should be accepted when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 5. Justice Ginsburg also noted that 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1446 includes procedures for resolving disputes about amounts in controversy, but those procedures are only available \\"after the defendant files a notice of removal\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 6-7 (emphasis in original). Although Justice Ginsburg declined to consider whether a \\"presumption\\" against removal is proper in \\"mine-run diversity cases\\", Justice Ginsburg observed that \\"no antiremoval presumption attends cases invoking CAFA, which Congress enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal court\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 7 (citing S. Rep. No. 109‚Äì14, p. 43 (2005)). Therefore, Justice Ginsburg Concluded that evidence of the amount in controversy only needs to be included in a defendant's notice of removal when the plaintiff or the court challenges the defendant's allegations. Justice Ginsburg also responded to an amicus brief filed by Public Citizen, Inc., which argued that the Tenth Circuit acted within its discretion when it decided to decline review because 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1453(c)(1) states that \\"a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the State court from which it was removed\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 7-8 (quoting 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1453(c)(1)) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in Justice Ginsburg's opinion). She concluded that there was \\"no jurisdictional barrier to our settlement of the question presented\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 8. Justice Ginsburg emphasized that Tenth Circuit's decision to deny Dart Cherokee's petition to review the remand order \\"was infected by legal error\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 11. Because the Tenth Circuit \\"froze the governing rule in the Circuit for this case and future CAFA removal notices\\" and denied Dart Cherokee the opportunity to \\"resist making the evidentiary submission\\", Justice Ginsburg held the Tenth Circuit's abused its decision by denying review.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 12-13. Justice Ginsburg concluded by stating that the Supreme Court \\"no doubt [has] authority to review for abuse of discretion the Tenth Circuit‚Äôs denial of Dart‚Äôs appeal from the District Court‚Äôs remand order\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 13-14. =Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion= Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Elena Kagan.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 1 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Justice Clarence Thomas also joined all but the last sentence of the opinion. Although Justice Scalia recognized that the Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide whether notices of removal must contain evidentiary support, he argued the Court should dismiss the case as improvidently granted in light of the fact that the issue the Court granted certiorari to review was not properly before the Court.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 1-2 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Because the Court was reviewing the Tenth Circuit's decision to deny review, Justice Scalia explained that \\"the only question before us is whether the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in denying Dart permission to appeal the District Court‚Äôs remand order\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 2 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Justice Scalia argued that the majority impermissibly concluded the Tenth Circuit denied review because it agreed with the District Court's legal analysis. Instead, Justice Scalia suggested the Tenth Circuit may have denied review for a legally permissible reason, and it would be inappropriate to assume that a court adopted a party's erroneous reasoning.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 2-3, 4-5 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing Sprint/United Management Co. v. Mendelsohn, . In the final sentence of his opinion, Justice Scalia argued that because the Court failed to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, it should have affirmed the Tenth Circuit's decision to deny review \\"since we have absolutely no basis for concluding that it abused its discretion\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 7-8 (Scalia, J., dissenting). =Justice Thomas' dissenting opinion= Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate dissenting opinion in which he argued that the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction \\"to review even the Court of Appeals' denial of permission to appeal\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 1 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Justice Thomas noted that federal statutory law permits the Supreme Court to review \\"[c]ases in the courts of appeals\\",See 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1254. but he argued an application for permission to appeal a remand order is not a \\"case\\" because \\"it does not assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does not even require a 'party' on the other side\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 1 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (internal quotations and citations omitted). He concluded that no \\"osmosis could transform an application for permission to appeal a remand order into a case\\".Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 2 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (internal quotations omitted). Additionally, Justice Thomas also criticized the majority opinion for extending precedent that held certificates of appealability in federal habeas corpus cases should be considered \\"cases\\" for the purpose of appellate jurisdiction.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 1-2 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Because the Tenth Circuit did not decide a \\"case\\", Justice Thomas concluded that the Court should dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.Dart Cherokee, slip op. at 2 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Commentary and analysis Commentators have described the Court's ruling in Dart Cherokee as a victory for attorneys who defend against class actions.See, e.g., Patrick H. Sims, Feature: Removing Diversity Cases: The Thrill Is Gone, 76 166, 169 (2015). Patrick H. Sims described the case as a \\"stress reliever\\" and noted that it \\"contains language that is rhapsodic to a prospective removing defendant's lawyer, both specifically as to the issue of jurisdictional amount and as to removal notices in general\\". Mark Moller suggested that \\"[t]he Court's affirmance in Dart that CAFA's findings section overcomes any 'antiremoval presumption with respect to CAFA' may presage a significant narrowing of some [CAFA] loopholes\\".Mark Moller, The Class Action After a Decade of Roberts Court Decisions: The New Class Action Federalism, 48 861, 871-72 (2015). Jessica K. Pruitt also observed that the Court's ruling in Dart Cherokee \\"effectively expands\\" the Court's 2013 ruling in Standard Fire Insurance Co. v. Knowles,Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 133 S. Ct. 1345 (2013). a case in which the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs in a class action could not avoid federal court jurisdiction by stipulating that damages would be less than the $5 million threshold set by CAFA.Jessica K. Pruitt, \\"CAFA-nated\\": A Jittery Interpretation of Forum Selection in Standard Fire Insurance Co. v. Knowles, 68 511, 529 (2015). However, Ronald Mann wrote that the decision in Dart Cherokee may actually force the Court to spend \\"several years repairing the damage to the law of review, steadily limiting the broad review of discretion applied here\\".

Though the KSDC recommended setting up of the KVU in its report submitted in 2010, the plan has been lying in cold storage, allegedly because of the apathy of the previous BJP dispensation and the present Congress government. The government approving the project now will be considered as a gift to the people at a time the State celebrates the 60th Kannada Rajyotsava. At its recent meeting, the KSDC decided to take forward the plan of setting up the KVU and submit a detailed project report (DPR) to the government shortly. \\"We are optimistic about getting positive response from the government,\\" said K.A. Dayanand, Director, Kannada and Culture. According to Chidananda Gowda, president of the KSDC who visited the TVA and studied its model, Tamilians living outside Tamil Nadu have been benefiting from the TVA to a large extent. Similarly, the KVU will be a boon to the Kannada diaspora, he said. Internet-based resources Once the KVU or Kannada Vastavopama Vishwavidyalaya is established, Kannada community living in different parts of the globe, as well as others interested in learning the language and acquiring knowledge on the history, art, literature and culture of Kannadigas will get Internet-based resources, he explained. The KVU will help in developing and delivering Internet-based learning material in Kannada, customised programmes to meet the cultural needs, and initiate and continue measures to coordinate and pool together knowledge resources, besides offering academic programmes in Kannada and awarding certificate, diploma and degree on completion of prescribed requirements, said a member of the KSDC on condition of anonymity. He said that had the government acted immediately after the KSDC submitted its report in 2010, the process of establishing the KVU would have commenced by now. \\"Even now it is not too late. If the department takes the initiative after getting approval from the government, it could be possible to put a skeletal structure in place by the Kannada Rajyotsava,\\" he said. Tamil Virtual Academy Tamil Nadu government established the Tamil Virtual University in 2001 and renamed it later as Tamil Virtual Academy (TVA). The TVA is providing Internet-based resources and opportunities for Tamil communities living in different parts of the globe, as well as others interested in learning Tamil, science, technology, Tamil computing software and acquiring knowledge on the history, art, literature and culture of Tamils.

Early life Beethoven's funeral procession. Watercolour by Franz St√∂ber, 1827. He was a pupil of the organist and composer :de:Joseph Preindl (1756-1823), who succeeded Johann Albrechtsberger as Domkapellmeister at St Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna in 1809; Krall was also a pupil of Preindl's successor Ignaz von Seyfried.\\"Seyfried, Ignaz Ritter von\\". (In German) Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich, Vol. 34, p. 176. German Wikisource. An Offertory of Krall's was sung in Vienna in 1825. Johann Krall may be the same Krall who was a dedicatee of the two Concertant Duos for two Violins, Op. 9, by Louis Spohr.2 Concertant Duos for 2 Violins, Op.9 (Spohr, Louis) at IMSLPe.g. and other websites mention Krall or J. B. Krall). The Spohr pieces were likely written in c1808 when Johann B. Krall would have been only around five years old. Krall was a torchbearer (Fackeltr√§ger) aged c.23 in Beethoven's funeral procession on 29 March 1826, in which his teacher von Seyfried held one of the cords attached to the pall covering Beethoven's coffin. Concerts at the Piarist church The Piarist Church, Vienna In early 1845, Krall was the chorus director of the Music Society of the Piarist Church, Vienna ('Piaristenkirche Musikverein'). The church (finished 1758) dedicated to Maria Treu (Faithful Maria) has a long-standing musical tradition because of its excellent acoustics: the Piarists, the oldest Catholic educational order, had commissioned Haydn's Missa in tempore belli, first performed there in 1796. A church musical society ('Musikverein') was first established there in 1828 by Baron Joseph von Blumenthal, who was also the Chordirektor. The high cost of the productions (copying of parts etc.) led to its disbanding in 1834. A second society founded in 1844 had 200 subscribing members. Krall, as Chordirektor, began with brisk activity and conducted a number of performances. Haydn's Theresienmesse was performed on 1 January 1845, as well as Tantum ergo of Herr Winter, Vias Tuas Domine from :de:Joseph Preindl, Krall's teacher, and the Gradual and the duet for tenor and bass Domine exaudi (Psalm 101/102) by Diabelli.Diabelli's Domine exaudi performed on Youtube The production was certified a \\"brilliant performance\\", the soprano solo in the Graduale perceived as \\"very nice\\", only an Offertorium of Diabelli inserted into the Haydn Mass was perceived as \\"inappropriate\\"., citing Allgemeiner Weiner musicalische Zeitung, 1845 p. 22 On Easter Sunday, 27 April 1848, the Mass in F minor by Bernhard Molique was given. Also sung were an Alleluja by Albrechtsberger and Alma Dei by Hummel.The concert was elaborately reviewed (in German) in the Allgemeiner Weiner musikalische Zeitung, 1845 p. 22, cited in On 19 January 1845 the service was sung to Mozart's Mass in C with Misericordias Domini, K.222 by Mozart as the Offertorium, and on 26 January 1845, Preindl's C major Mass, Op. 7. On 2 February 1845 Haydn's G major Mass (St. Nicholas) (Hob.XXII:6)Mass in G major, Hob.XXII:6 Score at IMSLP. was performed along with Krall's own Tantum ergo and Offertorium for bass voice and solo violin. The first performance of Schubert's Mass in G major took place on 9 February 1845, with Schubert's brother Ferdinand at the organ. On 30 November 1845, the Mass in G Major by Krall was performed under his leadership. A review of the performance called it a melodically very rich, truly ecclesiastical work. The four-part solo Et incarnatus was very wittily conceived, the Benedictus had interesting harmonic effects, the Agnus Dei offered surprising modulations; only the Osanna was not so successful and not adapted to the Church's attitude. Krall's own Tantum ergo and Asperges me by Ferdinand Klo√ü rounded off the Mass. Beethoven's Mass in C major, Op. 86, and the Laudate from his oratorio Christ on the Mount of Olives was given on 21 November 1847. Re-interment of Beethoven and Schubert Krall became a member of the board of directors of the Wiener Singverein in 1858. In 1863, at the instigation of Krall and Joseph Hellmesberger, Sr., the board of directors of the Gesellschaft der Musik decided to exhume the graves of Schubert and Beethoven in order to prevent further decomposition and at the same time to establish their resting places in a ‚Äúworthy manner‚Äù. On Friday morning, 23 October 1863, the remains of both composers were reburied in newly constructed vaults in the W√§hring Cemetery. In February 1867 Krall received the Musikverein's gold service cross from the Duke of Coburg (of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koh√°ry).. On the same news page were also announced: * The death of Verdi's father aged 80 in Busseto; * Hans Bronsart von Schellendorff's appointment as general manager of the Royal Hoftheater in Hanover; * and that Rittmeister Prince Thurn und Taxis until then Adjutant of the King of Bavaria, wished to resign his commission and marry the actress Fonteline.

She also - since her singing voice subsided on the route Philadelphia-San Francisco - chats about Schiller, Goethe, Heine. et al. She was married twice, once with a Herr Kapp, under which Italian-sounding name Kappiani she performed as a singer; the other time she married Herr Holzschuher. This marriage produced two children: a daughter Leopoldine, married to EH Mildmay, official at the British consulate in Milan, and Gilbert (see above). * J. B.

Synopsis Darius Bell and his family are living in the Bell estate, the mansion given to his ancestors, under the condition that every 25 years they would produce a gift for the town. The next gift (meant to be given by Darius‚Äô father) is coming up shortly. Darius soon discovers that his father has no gift to give to the town and that his family is broke. Even though the gift can be anything, even a barrel of vegetables, Darius‚Äô father insists that the gift needs to be astonishing and needs to honour the Bell name. Then, an earthquake happened and Darius goes outside to assess the damage. Darius then discovers, that due to the earthquake, a hole in the ground had opened up. Along with his two friends, Oliver and Paul, Darius goes down into the hole, and discovers that inside the hole, was what he believed to be rubies and gold. Darius is really excited about the ‚Äúgems‚Äù and believes that the Glitter Pool is the solution to all his problems. He even starts fantasizing about revealing the Glitter Pool to his parents. But first, Darius decides that he needs to go to an expert to confirm that it truly was ruby and gold. This is where Darius goes and seeks help from the geology professor, Professor Heggarty, who unfortunately breaks the truth to Darius and tells him that it isn‚Äôt ruby and gold, and is instead limonite and vanadinite. This is Darius‚Äô darkest moment. The next part of the story is where Darius learns a big lesson. He takes Marguerite down to the Glitter Pool and tells her that it is worthless. She then tells him that she prefers it that way, because if it had high financial value, all the gems would be torn down, but this way, the beauty of it is intact and she can look at it. She specified that she would rather have this sight as a gift then any number of gems around her neck. So Darius is transformed and sees the world at a whole new perspective. He now knows that value is not just money. He decides that if Marguerite likes the Glitter Pool for its beauty, then others will too. He decides to give the town the gift of being able to see the Glitter Pool. But first, he needed to fix up the Glitter Pool so that it was fit and safe for visiting. After requesting help from friends to fix up the pool and getting really excited about the revelation of the Glitter Pool, Darius discovers that the Glitter Pool can‚Äôt be used as the gift because it is on the land that is part of the Bell estate. Darius and his family have no choice but to give a barrel of vegetables as their gift and the mayor starts mocking them, but then Hector (Darius‚Äô father) stands up to Mayor Podcock and makes him feel like dirt. Darius then realises that an extreme gift wasn‚Äôt necessary, not even the Glitter Pool. He also learns that a gift is better given from free will rather than from obligation. Afterwards, as the Bells are driving home, they notice that heaps of people are crowded around the Glitter Pool, and Darius‚Äô parents find out about everything that Darius has done and they are very proud of him. Even Cyrus, Darius‚Äô older brother who is convinced that Darius is completely useless admits that he is not a complete waste of space. Life is back to normal for the Bell family, but now everyone has a newfound respect for Darius and they have all learned two very important lessons.
