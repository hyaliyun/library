Both of which are non-profit, non-governmental organizations that benefit LGBTI individuals in South Africa. A survivor of corrective rape, she advocates against gender violence and homophobia in her country. Soldaat spoke to a Khayelitsha commission of inquiry in January 2014 about the 1995 rape. Free Gender calls out on homophobic and racist symptoms of society and called for a boycott of the 2014 Cape Town Pride event, alleging racism, with Soldaat claiming that the event excludes women and nonwhites and instead targeting money strong white gay men. (Event director Matthew van As disputed her claim.) Soldaat has been the subject of two short films, Ndim, Ndim (It's Me, It's Me), directed by Martha Qumbe in 2005, and Episode 2 of the SABC-commissioned series I Am Woman: Leap of Faith in 2013.  Life and activism  Soldaat was inspired to create Free Gender after her own rape, and the murder of nineteen-year-old lesbian Zoliswa Nkonyana who was stoned and stabbed by a group of men in 2006. Soldaat‚Äôs corrective rape occurred in 1995, not far from her home in Khayelitsha. When she went to the local police to seek aid and to report the crime, they were unhelpful. She said that \\"By the time it came for me to lay a complaint, a police officer looked at me from head to toe. He asked me what had happened. I told him I was raped. But what happened was he didn't take my statement and he went to talk to other police officers. They came and asked me what happened. It looked like they were considering my sexual orientation.\\" She also experienced violence and abuse, later saying that ‚ÄúThey [the police officers] threw me so hard into the jail cell, that my feet were no longer touching the ground.‚Äù Soldaat‚Äôs attackers were never found. As a result of this, she partnered with other women in her community to create Free Gender in 2008, to get justice for lesbians who have faced violence due to their gender and/or their sexuality. As a result, five years after the murder of Zoliswa Nkonyana, a verdict was reached and four men were sentenced to 18 years in prison. Funeka Soldaat is also an advocate for women‚Äôs education, and believes that one of the best ways to fight injustice is to be educated. ‚ÄúThe only way to survive is to go to school,‚Äù said Soldaat. In 2010 a member of Free Gender, Millicent Gaika was raped, beaten, and tortured for five hours by a neighbor who wanted to ‚Äúcure‚Äù her of homosexuality, and in 2013, her attacker, Andile Ngocka was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment. \\"They know each other because Millicent grew up in front of that boy. And then we were so scared, because he can come back and finish up Millicent's life,\\" said Funeka after the trial. The case seemed to give hope to other black lesbians living in townships, that other magistrates might rule in their favor. In 2014, Funeka Soldaat announced that Free Gender would be boycotting the Cape Town Pride event because of its tendency to favor rich white men as opposed to reflecting the diverse community it represented, although Matthew Van As, the director of the event, disputed this claim. Many black lesbians, including Soldaat felt excluded by the Cape Town Pride celebrations saying that, ‚ÄúWhen we attended or participated, it was through invitation by a few white gay men who are gatekeepers in Cape Town Pride,‚Äù she said of the event. The controversy over the lack of diversity in Cape Town Pride Events and the white-male-centric running of the event is still an ongoing issue.  Free Gender  Since its founding by Soldaat in 2008, Free Gender has grown significantly. It is now a blog, a home for black LGBTI women, and has worked to raise awareness of LGBTI individuals. They now enjoy strong relations with the local police of Khayelitsha, making it easier for victims to report harassment, violence, and other crimes. Some churches have even reached out to Free Gender to talk about LGBTI issues. They still fight for the rights of black Lesbians and other black LGBTI individuals, and are dedicated to opposing forms of violence and hate directed at the LGBTI community. Free Gender also supports the families of Lesbian victims of violence. Their goal is to connect LGBTI individuals with their own community and to remove the stigma from homosexuality. \\"The organisation was established in Khayelitsha mainly because of the community's lack of understanding and its intolerance of LGBT lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people,‚Äù Soldaat later said of her organization‚Äôs location. In 2016 they moved out of Soldaat‚Äôs home and obtained an official office space located in Khayelitsha.  The Triangle Project  Funeka Soldaat is also associated with the Triangle Project. This nonprofit is based in Cape Town, South Africa and offers resources and assistance to LGBTI people throughout the city. They offer three types of services; Health and Support, Community Engagement and Empowerment, and Research and advocacy. Health and Support Services offers aid towards the health, mental and physical, of LGBTI people. It offers counseling and a clinic in order to support its community. Community Engagement and Empowerment aims to strengthen the communities of South Africa by creating and servicing safe spaces for LGBTI people. The Research Advocacy and Policy Program works to promote the rights of the community by transforming legislation and policy. The Triangle Project also works in tandem with the South African Department of Justice to fight for LGBTI legislation and protection in court cases and policies.

Constructed in the early twentieth century, it carries one of the city's most important streets and connects the city's northern and southern sections. One of several large concrete bridges designed by a Cleveland engineer, it has been named a historic site. History As late as 1857, Greenville was restricted to the southeastern side of Greenville Creek; only about four or five houses were located in what has since become the northern part of the city. However, a Greenville Creek bridge existed by this time, and around it existed a smattering of industries. Like today, Broadway was an important thoroughfare, with the old courthouse occupying a place on the public square, and a dense commercial district lining both sides of the street for several blocks to the south of the square.Wilson, Frazer E. History of Darke County Ohio: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time. Vol. 1. Milford: Hobart, 1914. The current courthouse was constructed in 1874, and Broadway was paved with brick in 1900 as numerous commercial buildings continued to rise along its sides. The location of the present bridge is close to the Treaty of Greenville signing grounds; construction by the bridge in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries revealed burials of officers from the Legion of the United States. Architecture Upstream side of the bridge, pictured circa 1920 Constructed in 1909, the Broadway Bridge is a three-hinged arch bridge built of concrete. A single span crosses the entire stream, and a balustrade prevents vehicles and pedestrians from falling over the side into the stream., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-01-13. The bridge's designer, A.W. Zesiger, constructed multiple three-hinged arch concrete bridges; one that spanned a creek at Brookside Park in Cleveland was once considered the world's flattest semi-elliptical arch. These two bridges were constructed in a similar manner, although the slightly flatter Cleveland bridge was lighter and smaller than the Greenville bridge, whose location required it to carry heavier loads than a bridge placed in a park.Orth, Samuel P. A History of Cleveland, Ohio. Chicago and Cleveland: S.J. Clarke, 1910, 677. Not long after completing the bridge in Greenville, Zesiger became known for a substantially larger structure: as the Cuyahoga County Bridge Engineer, he helped to supervise the construction of the concrete-and-steel Detroit- Superior High Level Bridge,Miller, Carol Poh. \\"Photographs and Historical Data: Detroit Superior High Level Bridge \\". Historic American Engineering Record, 1978-08, 3. Accessed 2014-01-13. which was completed in 1917. Preservation In 1996, the Broadway Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its place in local history and because it remained a well-preserved example of early twentieth- century engineering. It is one of twelve National Register-listed locations in Greenville; among the others are the courthouse and the business district on Broadway, which has been named a historic district. Today, two state highways ‚Äî State Routes 49 and 571 ‚Äî cross Greenville Creek on the bridge.DeLorme. Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. 7th ed. Yarmouth, 2004, 54.

The historic property replaced the Eagle Hotel, which had been on the site since 1840. Many businesses have occupied the hotel's first floor, and the structure has contained the Bentonville Public Library twice. Coupled with Massey Hotel's community heritage, the building's architectural style is uncommon in Arkansas, and even more rare in the Ozarks. With this duality of significance, the property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Location Located at the intersection of Central Avenue (Highway 72) and A Street, the hotel is located in the Original Town plat of Bentonville, today known as Downtown Bentonville. Historically, the intersection was the junction of US Highway 71, Highway 72, and Highway 100, with US 71 turning left and following Central Avenue on its path north at the junction. As US 71 was the major through highway, the hotel was easily accessible by many travelers during its early history. US 71 was later rerouted to bypass downtown, with the A Street/Central Avenue route seeing redesignation as U.S. Route 71B (US 71B). This routing also has changed, with US 71B now rerouted to the west away from downtown. Even without the through traffic, the district has seen significant redevelopment upon opening of Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art north of the town square. The increased tourist traffic related to the museum has made Downtown Bentonville one of the state's most popular tourism destinations. History The Massey Hotel replaced the Eagle Hotel, which had stood on the same corner since 1840. The Eagle Hotel was also a historically significant property, housing Union general Franz Sigel during the Civil War prior to the Battle of Pea Ridge. However, the property had deteriorated, containing a monument shop beginning around 1900 until it was destroyed for redevelopment as the Hotel Massey in 1908. Construction began in February 1909, and the grand opening ceremony was held on June 28, 1910. The 240 guests were welcomed by an orchestra, with a reception and open house following the hotel's opening. In November 1918, the city's first public library was established in the hotel's east room. This library would later close due to a lack of funding. However, several other shops and businesses were located on the Hotel Massey's first floor, including the ticket office for the train to Rogers. A fire in 1975 devastated the building, and it was left vacant for over a year following the fire. In 1977, Jim Walton, Sam Walton, and Helen Walton purchased the Massey Hotel building. They renovated the structure into office space, with the Bentonville Public Library on the first floor. The library opened on November 11, 1979 and operated in the Massey Hotel for 27 years, before outgrowing the historic structure and moving to its current location. The Massey Hotel also temporarily housed some Crystal Bridges works prior to the museum's opening in 2011. Architecture The three-story brick structure displays many common elements of the restrained Second Renaissance Revival architectural style, including a fenestrated porch along Central Avenue and A Street, stone belt course and frieze, and ornamented pediment bearing the structure's name. The porch roof is supported by round stone Romanesque columns atop rusticated granite pedestals. Above the columns are a cornice and frieze with a bracketed soffett. Both the tops of the columns and the brackets along the building wall bear acanthus leaf ornamentation. A larger-scale cornice matching the porch, brick parapet, and cast stone cap top the building. A flat porch roof formerly housed a promenade, as indicated by two doors still present today. Inside, the former parlor and ballroom contained tile floors and pressed tin ceilings. The first floor has fixed windows with transoms, while the upper floors bear double-hung windows. All window openings bear stone lintels.

Idlib Governorate. History Excavations of the tell have identified humans living here in the Bronze and neolithic ages, however the area is principally known as an Iron Age settlement. The tell at Mastuma is 18 metres high and 200 metres in diameter. It was excavated by a Japanese archaeological team between 1980 and 1995.Bryce, 2013, pp. 459-460. =Iron Age= Capture of Astamaku, near Al-Mastumah, described on the Balawat GatesThe bronze ornaments of the palace gates of Balawat (Shalmaneser II, B.C. 859-825) edited, with an introduction by Samuel Birch ; with descriptions and translations by Theophilus G. Pinches. Al-Mastumah is near the site of the Iron Age I settlement of Astamaku (also known as Tell Mastuma). Astamaku is five kilometres south of the town of Idlib. Of the roughly 90 cities Assyrian king Shalmaneser III claimed to have conquered in the Aramaean kingdom of Hamath, Astamaku was the only one mentioned by name on the Balawat Gates. The city was fortified and was taken over in 848 BC by a force of Assyrian archers according to the images on the gates. It was also the farthest city in Hamath that Shalmaneser conquered during his military campaign.Lipinsky, 2000, pp. 280-281. The border settlement had streets and small dwellings that suggest that the town had a governor but mostly housed the small families of members of the garrison. =Modern era= Al-Mastumah was described as \\"a village in green surroundings\\" by author Robert Boulanger in the 1960s. He also noted the village's \\"mound-shaped houses\\", then a common feature of north Syrian localities.Boulanger, 1966, p. 478. The houses were made of mud brick and had cone-shaped roofs.Avi-Yonah, 1942, p. 131. During the ongoing Syrian civil war, in January 2013, heavy fighting took place between opposition rebels and pro-government forces in al-Mastumah. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), an unknown number of people were killed during the clashes or executed. The village's Ba'ath Party camp was reportedly converted to a detention center in 2011 and contains a weapons arsenal and tanks. The pro-opposition Local Coordination Committees (LCC) claimed that 70 people were killed in the Idlib region whilst forces fought for control of al- Mastumah.Syrian regime commits new massacre in Idlib: opposition group .

Parliament Rolls of Medieval England, Roll 5 (SC 9/5). Proceedings on the complaint of the earl of Hereford against the earl of Gloucester It is probable that de Bohun's defiant actions in support of baronial rights may have contributed to an unfavorable disposition by King Edward I towards the Devereux family. Stephen's grandfather, Baron Devereux of Lyonshall, to meet debts incurred in the service of the King in Gascony, was forced to grant in 1299 his castle of Lyonshall to Roger, 1st Baron de la Warr. Within the year de la Warr transferred it to Walter de Langton, Bishop of Coventry, and in 1300 the Baron is shown granting Lyonshall to the Bishop for life. Later that same year Langton in turn placed Lyonshall in the possession of William Tuchet who began styling himself as Lord of Lyonshall. Following the death of Edward I in July 1307, Walter de Langton was arrested, and his lands seized. The bishop was brought to trial for corruption, and during the proceedings the court dealt with the ownership of Lyonshall.Alice Beardwood. Records of the Trial of Walter Langeton, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, 1307-1312. (London: University College, 1969). Pages 71, 201, 202, and 258 The sheriff of Herefordshire was ordered to determine if Sir William Devereux, Lord of Lyonshall, or his heirs held the castle. The sheriff reported that William Devereux held nothing, but William Tuchet and Richard de AbyndonAppointed baron of the Exchequer in 1299, he worked closely with Walter de Langton and would receive a prebend in Lichfield Cathedral in 1304. possessed certain lands and tenements previously held by Devereux. On 30 November 1307 William Tuchet testified that William Devereux currently held the manor of Tasley, Shropshire, and the Bishop of ChesterThe bishopric of Chester at this time was held by Walter de Langton as part of the bishopric of Coventry held some of the other tenements in the county of Salop, which together Devereux held on the day of the debt's recognition in 1300. The court proceedings continued from term to term, and William Devereux failed to appear to protect his family's interests (possibly due to some incapacity either from old age or injuries suffered from many years of military service). The reversion of Lyonshall after the death of William Devereux and his second wife, Lucy Burnell, had been granted to Walter Devereux, William's son by his first marriage and Stephen's father. As his father had died in 1305, Stephen Devereux seized this opportunity in 1308 to drive Tuchet from Lyonshall by force.Placitorum in domo capitulari Westmonasteriensi asservatorum abbrevatio, temporibus regum Ric. I., Johann., Henr. III, Edw. I, Edw. II. (London: Public Record Office, 1811). Page 304 In June 1308 Tuchet requested 30 pounds compensation for damages and losses caused by the attacks executed by Stephen Devereux and 4 others.Placitorum in domo capitulari Westmonasteriensi asservatorum abbrevatio, temporibus regum Ric.

Page 304 On 14 October 1309 the part of Langton's trial concerning Lyonshall was dismissed because no recognizance was found. As Stephen was under-age, his guardian (and uncle, John Devereux of Frome) brought suit on his behalf in 1310 against William Tuchet demanding the restoration of Lyonshall as the transfer violated Stephen's rights of reversion as heir of Walter Devereux, son of William Devereux and his first wife, Alice Grandison. Stephen was granted the right to be heard despite being under-age, as the potential damage was occurring while he was under-age. Stephen's suit was denied based on the terms of the recovery of Lyonshall under the dictum of Kenilworth. It had been granted to William Devereux and his second wife, Lucy Burnell, for the term of their two lives, and after their decease reverted to Stephen's father, Walter Devereux, and his heirs. As the Baron and his second wife were both alive and tenants-for-life, any action on behalf of Stephen was not supported by common law or Statute (which only gave right of recovery for alienation by a tenant- in-dower). Stephen Devereux yielded control of Lyonshall in 1310.F.W. Maitland (Editor). Year Books of Edward II. Volume III, 3 Edward II, AD 1309-1310.

By the time of Langton's death in 1321 control of Lyonshall castle had passed from the Devereux family. Stephen Devereux's alignment with Humphrey de Bohun during the killing of Edward II's first favorite, Piers Gaveston, probably contributed to the failure of the family to retain their Barony upon the death of Stephen's grandfather in 1314. As the Baron's widow, Lucy, was still alive, he still had no legal claim to a large portion of his inheritance. In Easter 1315, her right to dower was upheld despite a claim that she was living in adultery at the time of her husband's death.William Craddock Bolland, Year Books of Edward II, volume 17: 8 Edward II (1314-1315). (London 1925). Pasch. 8 Edw. 2, pl. [6], Vulgate p. 268 (version I), pl. [12], Vulgate p. 272 (version II) The court found in her favor as she had not abandoned her husband's home by continuing to live in a Devereux manor. As a member of the Earl of Hereford's retinue, Stephen Devereux was probably present at the Battle of Bannockburn in June 1314. In the subsidy rolls of 1316 Stephen was listed as holding lands in Bodenham and Burghope in Herefordshire.Anthony Story. Inquisitions and Assessments Relating to Feudal Aids: 1284-1431, Volume II: Dorset to Huntingdon. (London: Public Record Office, 1900). Page 383 As later the Despenser War played out, Devereux was also probably with Humphrey de Bohun when he was killed at the Battle of Boroughbridge on 16 March 1322. Stephen Devereux served on the jury on 24 January 1324 attesting to Adam Orleton, Bishop of Hereford's complicity in the rebellion of Roger de Mortimer in 1321, and his brother, John Devereux of Manne, was among the men conducting the inquiry into Orleton's actions.Placitorum in domo capitulari Westmonasteriensi asservatorum abbrevatio, temporibus regum Ric.

Printed by Command of His Majesty King George III in pursuance of an address of The House of Commons of Great Britain. 1811. page 345 Although Stephen was in the party opposing the king's favorites, the Devereux of Bodenham bore a grudge against Mortimer that had its roots in his being granted their lands under the Dictum of Kenilworth described above. This placed Stephen Devereux further at odds with the Devereux of Frome. His half-uncle, John Devereux, had become associated with Henry Mortimer of Chelmarsh prior to his death in 1310, and John's widow, Constance Burnell, had married Henry Mortimer as her second husband. Stephen Devereux's cousin, William Devereux of Frome, would be part of the Mortimer retinue throughout his life. The Despencer War also caught up with William Tuchet who was executed along with Bartholomew de Badlesmere in 1322 following the Battle of Boroughbridge. His death brought Lyonshall Castle back into the King's hands as Baron Devereux's widow was still alive, and Badlesmere's heir was a minor.UK National Archives, Lyonshall Collection: Records of the Exchequer, and its related bodies, with those of the Office of First Fruits and Tenths, and the Court of Augmentations.

Edward III bestowed it back on the Badlesmere heir, Giles de Badlesmere. Upon Giles‚Äô death, William Devereux's son, another William Devereux of Frome would make one last attempt to gain the castle by filing suit in 1340 against John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford who had gained possession by right of his wife, but was again denied.In 1335, William de Bohun, earl of Northampton, married Elizabeth de Badlesmere, widow of Edmund Mortimer, to promote an end to the hostilities between the two families. This probably also contributed to the failure of the de Bohun‚Äôs to support any effort on Stephen Devereux to regain Lyonshall Stephen Devereux, like his cousin, lacked enough royal favor to regain Lyonshall during his lifetime, but remained a key retainer of the de Bohun family. William and Edward de Bohun participated in the coup against Roger Mortimer that freed Edward III from his control.Dan Jones. The Plantagenets, The Warrior Kings and Queens Who Made England. New York: Viking. 2012, Pages 363, 375. The king later rewarded the family by creating William de Bohun Earl of Northampton. The influence of the de Bohuns provided a path for the Devereux family to regain royal favor, and facilitated the placement of Devereux's nephew, John, in the company of Edward, the Black Prince. Stephen witnessed land transactions in Whitchurch Maund in 1335 along with his brother, John Devereux of Manne.John Duncumb.

The site is considered sacred to the Ojibwa, on whose traditional land it is located:  Pre-history, pre-contact  The Rainy River, a relatively wide, straight and peaceful river (with the exception of the fluvial terraces at Long Sault Rapids), was a major North American waterway. With waterways the most important means of transportation, it served as a superhighway for a vibrant continent-wide trading network for thousands of years. Archaeological artefacts and sites dated at approximately 5,000 BP, provides evidence that the first residents of the area were nomadic hunters, fishers and gatherers known as Archaic people. They inhabited many parts of North America and traded extensively over large areas. First Nations consider these traditional lands to have been theirs for time immemorial. Kay-Nah-Chi- Wah-Nung has the largest concentration of earthwork burial mounds in Canada. The mounds were built on river terraces along the north side of the Long Sault Rapids on Rainy River.

Interpretive centre and museum Opened in 1987, the interpretive centre showcases 10,000 years of aboriginal history. There is also a reconstructed village and tepee camp. In 1995, Parks Canada provided funds to improve the park, including the construction of the Kay-Nah-Chi-Wah- Nung Historical Centre and traditional Roundhouse for visitors and the local First Nations communities. Along with a conservation lab and collection storage, the centre is also used as a meeting place for Elders. It is an educational resource for teaching Ojibway culture, continuing its role as gathering place that began thousands of years ago.

The building contains seven two-bedroom units, 24 one-bedroom units, 10 studios, and 13 sleepers that share a bath, shower, and kitchen. History Parkway Manor was designed by architects Bennes & Herzog in 1931 for owner and real estate developer Harry Mittleman. Mittleman had planned to begin construction sometime later, but he was pressured by the Citizens Employment Committee to hire as many workers as possible and break ground immediately as the Great Depression continued into its second year. He placed a steam shovel on the job site and began digging even before the architects had completed their design, and Mittleman created 250 jobs during construction. The building opened a few months later with 42 units ranging from studios to four-room apartments. Each living room contained an artificial fireplace, and ceilings were covered with \\"California stucco,\\" a then-new product with colorful pigments added at the factory.

It is the cathedral for the Holy Protection of Mary Byzantine Catholic Eparchy of Phoenix. History Byzantine Catholics moved to the western United States from the east and in Phoenix they began to plan for a church of their own as early as 1956. Ten years later they formally requested a parish from Bishop Nicholas Elko of Pittsburgh. Permission was granted to acquire the property of the former St. Thomas the Apostle Antiochene Orthodox Church in 1968. The first Divine Liturgy was celebrated on Easter Sunday. The church was dedicated by Bishop Stephen Kocisko under the patronage of St. Stephen, the Proto-Martyr, on June 28, 1968. The Rev. Paul Bovankovich was appointed the parish's first pastor. A rectory and parish hall were built in 1974, and a columbarium was added in 1991. The Northridge earthquake in 1994 damaged the chancery offices of the Eparchy of Van Nuys and the Cathedral of St. Mary. Bishop George Kuzma and his staff relocated to Phoenix and as a result St. Stephen's was named the pro- cathedral. In 2010 the Eparchy of Van Nuys was officially renamed the Holy Protection of Mary Byzantine Catholic Eparchy of Phoenix and St. Stephen's was elevated to a cathedral from its pro-cathedral status. In 2016, Father Diodoro Mendoza was appointed rector and pastor of St. Stephen Cathedral. In 2016, Bishop John Stephen Pazak succeeded Bishop Gerald Nicholas Dino as the bishop. Bishop Dino remains Bishop Emeritus.

As the owner of one of Waconia's longest-running businesses, she remains a prominent figure in the history of that town. Susan \\"Susie\\" Schmitt was born on August 13, 1860 in the village of Chaska. She was one of eight children of John and Rosina Schmitt. The others were Andrew, Casper, Anna, Caroline, Bernice, and twins Joseph and Josephine. Schmitt was a talented seamstress from a young age. She turned that gift into a career spanning nearly seven decades, working on quilts, dresses, hats, hat pins, and more. Susie Schmitt first entered the millinery (hat making) business in 1888 as an apprentice for four years in the city of St. Paul. Afterward, she returned to Chaska to run a dressmaking business. That business operated for twelve years. In 1898, Schmitt opened her own dressmaking and millinery shop in Waconia. Four years later, she moved the shop to a prime location on Main Street after purchasing the A. Ed. Kauder property for $2,300. At this new location, the store focused on millinery. Schmitt operated the business for forty-eight years, until she sold it to Mrs. Elva Ellison in 1946. She continued making and remodeling hats in a smaller shop. Schmitt also maintained scrapbooks of newspaper clippings of weddings, obituaries and key events, which are now in the Carver County Historical Society collection along with many of her photographs and examples of her work as a milliner. In July, 1912, Susie Schmitt married Charles Hanson, a local carpenter born in March 1861. The couple never had children of their own, leaving Schmitt to care for and spoil her nieces and nephews. After Hanson died on June 16, 1932, Schmitt outlived him by twenty-three years, until her own death on October 7, 1956 at the age of ninety-six.

Her father Peng Gan (ÂΩ≠Áéï) had served as the prefect of Ji Prefecture (ÂêâÂ∑û, in modern Ji'an, Jiangxi), late in the Tang Dynasty and early in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period, under the warlord Wei Quanfeng, who then controlled four prefectures, including Ji, centered on Fu Prefecture (Êí´Â∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi). In 909, when Wei was defeated and captured by the Wu general Zhou Ben, Zhou then followed up by attacking Ji. Peng Gan abandoned Ji and fled to Chu. Chu's prince Ma Yin, appreciating Peng for his faithfulness to Wei, made him the prefect of Chen Prefecture (ÈÉ¥Â∑û, in modern Chenzhou, Hunan).

Waller. The film premiered on April 21, 2013 at the Tribeca Film Festival and stars Zo√´ Bell and Rachel Nichols. The story focuses on women forced to fight to death for the twisted entertainment of the wealthy elite. Synopsis Sabrina (Zo√´ Bell), along with 49 other women, is kidnapped by the diabolical husband and wife team of Elizabeth (Sherilyn Fenn) and Joseph (Doug Jones), and kept in a prison where they are all barefoot in matching white tank tops and gray sweatpants. The women are told that they will fight to the death for the entertainment of a group of bored rich people. If they lose or refuse to fight, a sniper will kill their loved ones.

Waller also tried to avoid gratuitous gore. Raze was shot with a very tight schedule and the crew had only thirty days to film nineteen action sequences. Partway through filming, Rosario Dawson was brought onto the set for a cameo as she had previously worked together with Bell and Thoms on the 2007 film Death Proof. Bell was not made aware of Dawson's casting or arrival, as Waller wanted her appearance to come as a surprise. Reception Critical reception for Raze has been mixed and the film currently holds a rating of 44% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 32 reviews. Criticism for the film predominantly centered upon the familiarity of the film's plot, and Fearnet reviewer Scott Weinberg commented that \\" Raze is simply a gender-friendly twist on a very conventional tale, but it's still a rather fun way to spend 85 minutes if you're tired of the same old action.\\" The Hollywood Reporter criticized the movie's screenplay, as they felt that it did not give actors Jones and Fenn enough to work with and also opined that the movie's \\"opening title card, which cites statistics about the number of women who go missing in any given year -- the co-opting of real-world suffering making it that much harder to go along with Waller's idea of it's-only-a-midnight-movie kicks.\\" In contrast Twitch Film praised Bell's acting as one of the film's highlights, as they felt that it helped \\"lift Raze above similarly themed genre film endeavors.\\" The New York Times opined that the film would not appeal to everyone but that \\"there is food for thought here about the subjugation and exploitation of women, the limits of psychological and physical endurance, and more.\\" =Awards= *Grand Jury Prize for Best Supporting Actress at the Las Vegas International Film Festival (2013, won - Tracie Thoms) ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 horror films Category:American action horror films Category:American action films Category:American films Category:American exploitation films Category:English-language films Category:Films about kidnapping Category:Films about death games ","title":"Raze (film)"},{"id":"41637159","text":"Bucksville is an unincorporated community in Nockamixon Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States.

Founded in 2008 by Michael Ableman and Seann Dory, Sole Food's mission is to provide low- income residents of the Downtown Eastside with \\"jobs, agricultural training, and inclusion in a supportive community of farmers and food lovers.\\" It is a subsidiary of Cultivate Canada, a local charity that promotes human ecology- related social projects. Sole Food is the largest urban farm attempted in Vancouver, and through it Ableman hopes to demonstrate that \\"urban agriculture can in fact be considered a serious enterprise for urban areas.\\" He emphasizes that it is of a larger scale than community gardens, and that it could be a \\"serious enterprise for urban areas.\\" Since its inception, Sole Food has been met with significant community support. Grants from a variety of sources including the city of Vancouver, banks, as well as philanthropists enable Sole Food to continue expanding their operations. Sole Food's vision aligns closely with Vancouver‚Äôs Greenest City 2020 Action plan to increase production of locally grown food, hence the city has provided them with generous support. Being a non-profit social initiative, priority is placed upon improving the community: employees, many of whom are current or recovering drug addicts receive paid training, and 10% of the produce harvested is donated to neighborhood agencies. Due to the small scale of Sole Food and the use of high quality seeds, the food produced is relatively expensive compared to conventionally grown crops. As such, the food grown does not go toward feeding impoverished residents of the Downtown Eastside, but rather to a number of upscale restaurants that specialize in locally sourced ingredients. The produce is sold to 30 restaurants in Vancouver that specialize in using locally-sourced ingredients. It also sells to 7 local farmers‚Äô markets.  Locations  Sole Food Street Farms planter boxes at Strathcona location Sole Food currently operates farms in four locations in East Vancouver. These sites, established on un-used land are leased to Sole Food by the city or Landowners on a temporary year-to-year basis. Like most urban areas, the soil at these sites is not suitable for growing due to contamination. In order to grow food in these circumstances, crops are planted in specially designed boxes which keep them separate from the soil or concrete below. In addition, they are built on shipping pallets allowing them to be moved with a forklift on short notice should the land be developed. These portable planters enable Sole Food to relocate without having to replant their crops, which is important because the land they use is only temporarily leased. = Main Street: Sole Food Urban Ochard = Sole Food Urban Orchard at the Main Street Location In July 2013 Sole Food opened the largest urban orchard in North America at the corner of Main St. and Terminal Ave. in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was leased to Sole Food by the city of Vancouver for $1 per year. The land, which had previously been an old gas station site, had been empty for over a decade due to contamination in the soil. Sole Food was able to circumvent this by the use of the aforementioned portable planters. They planted 500 trees at the orchard which includes several types of fruits such as apple and pear as well as many different types of culinary herbs. The orchard is scheduled to reach commercial production levels between 2016 and 2018. Other than providing large quantities of food, it provides many jobs with some employees working year round. Normally, Sole Food is required to reduce the number of work hours during the slow winter months. Installation of the site took place over a year and a half period with most of the work being completed 2 months prior to the official opening. = Strathcona = This is the first site farmed by Sole Food beginning in 2010. It is located next to the Astoria Hotel at Hastings and Hawks Avenue. Many of the original staff reside in this neighborhood. Techniques and ideas were developed at this site such as the space saving vertical strawberry planters and are being used at other locations. = False Creek = This site is located close to BC Place, a sports stadium at Pacific Boulevard and Carrall Street. This is their biggest site totalling 2 acres and receives a great deal of traffic from pedestrians, cyclists and drivers. = East Van = This site is located in an industrial area below the Grandview Viaduct at East 1st and Clark Avenue. Here, Sole Foods operates 1 acre of unheated greenhouses allowing them to grow warmer weather crops and extend their growing season into the colder winter months.

After teaching in New York City, she came to Minnesota in 1868 and became an advocate for temperance and women's suffrage. She was president of the Minnesota Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) for seventeen years and urged the WCTU to work on behalf of women's rights more broadly. Early life Harriet A. Duncan, born in the north of Ireland in 1825, immigrated to the United States and landed in New York City in 1843. She became a successful teacher, working in classrooms for twenty-five years. She also doubled as a principal for fifteen of those years. In April 1868, Duncan came to Red Wing, Minnesota, to marry a recently widowed Methodist Episcopal churchman, Chauncey Hobart. Her groom had built an impressive reputation serving Methodists in Illinois and Wisconsin frontier towns before reaching Minnesota. Temperance Movement Hobart became part of the Temperance Movement. She took an active role in the 1874 Minnesota Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) convention in Red Wing. She was a speaker at the meeting, along with Julia Bullard Nelson and Elizabeth Hutchinson. These three WCTU leaders also believed women should have the right to vote, and argued successfully for a vote in support of women's suffrage. In 1877, Hobart helped to organize the local Red Wing Woman's Christian Temperance Union. She became president and continued in that role for seventeen years. Seen by her colleagues as an effective leader and speaker, Hobart became president of the Minnesota WCTU in 1881. She held that position for thirteen years. Her tenure as president proved the longest in the group's history. Hobart's 1891 speech before the Minnesota WCTU's Fifteenth Convention argued for women's rights broadly. She and other leaders were widening the scope of their organization. Some critics within the WCTU felt such efforts were a sideshow that weakened the struggle against liquor. But Hobart believed strongly in women's equality. Hobart, like many of her WCTU sisters, believed that getting the vote would empower women and eventually bring about equal rights. This strength would help them in their war on intoxicating beverages. During her 1892 presidential address before the WCTU, Hobart told of the Union's power to influence others. She told members to share their views about regulation of the liquor traffic with every man they dealt with-husbands, brothers, sons, friends, merchants, and workmen. Death Hobart died in 1898 at age 74. NotesReferences *Angell, Madeline. Red Wing, Minnesota: Saga of a River Town. Minneapolis: Dillon Press, 1977. *Bordin, Ruth.

The Hollywood Reporter, May 1, 2013. The film stars Thomas Haden Church as Bruce, an unemployed snowplow driver in rural Quebec who develops a pseudo-friendship with Paul, a man who hides his deep disturbances behind a facade of warm demeanor which is slowly revealed through a series of sporadic flashbacks. The film's cast also includes Anie Pascale, Marc Labr√®che, Isabelle N√©lisse, Genevi√®ve Laroche, Emanuel Hoss-Desmarais and Vincent Hoss-Desmarais. Plot Bruce is a snowplow driver in a small remote town in Quebec. While driving drunk during a snowstorm, Bruce fatally strikes a pedestrian. After Bruce panics and hides the body in a snowbank, he drives deep into the woods in a stupor and falls asleep. When he wakes, he finds that the vehicle has become stuck. Stranded in the freezing cold without supplies, he initially sets off to find help but returns to the snowplow when he sees no nearby signs of civilization. Left with nothing but his own thoughts, Bruce practices his statement to the police. During the imaginary conversations, he becomes overcome with emotion when told that his victim had children. As Bruce wrestles with his guilty conscience, flashbacks reveal that the dead man, Paul, was Bruce's houseguest. Leaving a convenience store and coming across Paul in his vehicle attempting to commit suicide by inhaling vehicle exhaust fumes, unplugging the hose, Bruce starts conversation with Paul, admiring his vehicle and eventually commandeers the vehicle, driving around casually with Paul, developing a casual friendship, though Bruce becomes frustrated when Paul takes advantage of his hospitality and requests a loan. Bruce, a widower who has fallen on hard times after he lost his job due to drunkenly crashing his snowplow into a restaurant, explains that he can not help Paul. When Paul notices Bruce's collection of highly realistic ocular prostheses, Paul claims his proficiency with web design to Bruce and offers to set up an online presence to sell the collection. Bruce declines the offer and says that he can not bring himself to sell his wife's crafts. In the present, Bruce leaves his snowplow once again after he runs out of gas. After a long trek, he finds a restaurant, where he learns from the newspaper that both he and Paul have been reported missing. After stocking up on supplies, he returns to his snowplow. When his supplies run out again, he investigates the area further and finds a large house near a frozen lake. He breaks into the shed and steals supplies, then hides there overnight when the owners return. In the morning, Simone, the owner's daughter, discovers him, and he frightens her. He apologizes to her father, Eric, and retreats into the woods. Later, when Eric and his friend go into the woods to look for him, Bruce injures his ankle while he hides. Frustrated and unable to hobble back to civilization, he camps out on Eric's land and engages in more imaginary conversations with the police. Further flashbacks reveal that Bruce caught Paul stealing; he was pursuing Paul when he accidentally struck him. Paul seemingly smiles as the snowplow hits him, which causes Bruce to wonder if it was a second suicide attempt. Bruce also implicates the snowplow itself in the accident and becomes increasingly hostile toward it. This culminates as Bruce dumps his remaining gasoline on the snowplow and lights it on fire. When Bruce's ankle heals, he breaks into Eric's shed again and steals a snowmobile. He digs up Paul's body and disposes of it in a frozen lake, but he is caught in the act. The witnesses flee, and Bruce returns to his own home, where he becomes increasingly paranoid. When he realises that two men are looking for him either the police or accomplices of Eric, Bruce attempts to hide in the snowplow banging his boot and attracting attention but they pass away. Bruce attempts to repair the snowplow but his expertise is limited. Bruce is obviously beginning to starve as he attempts to eat tree bark and is numbingly bored as the area around the snowplow becomes increasingly worn down. In the last moments, the winter gets milder but the cold quickly returns. The film's epilogue is Bruce voice of thought; with two life observances: \\"every guilty person is his own hangman\\", \\"...and each new day will be better\\"; concluding with, \\"Goddamn, it's freezing.\\" Cast * Thomas Haden Church as Bruce * Marc Labr√®che as Paul * Anie Pascale as Waitress * Isabelle N√©lisse as Simone * Genevi√®ve Laroche as Julie * Vincent Hoss-Desmarais as Eric Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 83% of 24 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6.84/10.

Following the death of her husband and their only child, she bravely headed south to Texas, in 1869, to teach former slaves in U.S. government-backed Freedmen's Bureau schools. Nelson spent the summers of the 1870s and 1880s in Minnesota, where she emerged as a state and national leader in the movement for women's suffrage and the temperance campaign against alcohol use. Biography Julia Bullard was born in High Ridge, Connecticut, on May 13, 1842, the daughter of Edward and Angeline Raymond Bullard. Julia Bullard moved to Minnesota with her family in 1857. She earned a teaching degree at Hamline University, which was then located in Red Wing, around 1862. On September 1866, Bullard married former classmate Ole Nelson. Tragedy struck the Nelsons when their infant son, Cyrus, died in August 1867. Just five months later, Ole died. Newly widowed, the twenty-six- year-old teacher decided to put her teaching skills to use for a greater cause, educating newly-freed slaves in the South. In 1869, Nelson chose a dangerous task. She traveled to Texas where she would teach freed slaves through the Freedmen's Bureau. Congress created the Freedmen's Bureau to assist newly-freed slaves in adjusting to their release following the Civil War. By 1869, there were about three thousand schools for freed men and women, including the one at which Nelson taught. Most Southern whites, angry at their defeat during the Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), deeply resented teachers from the North. Although she was threatened with violence and shunned by some whites, Nelson taught in the South from 1870 until 1888. In the early 1880s, Nelson, a member of the Minnesota Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), assumed duty as a public speaker for the group. In 1886, while part of a delegation to a U.S. House of Representatives judiciary committee hearing woman suffrage, Nelson stated, \\"If I am capable of preparing citizens, I am capable of possessing the rights of a citizen myself. I ask you to remove the barriers which restrain women from equal opportunities and privileges with men.\\" Nelson also worked as superintendent for the state WCTU and was its vice president from 1889‚Äì1890. She handled editing the group's newspaper, the Minnesota White Ribboner. \\"Julia B.\\" made good use of summers free from teaching duty. In 1881, she joined fourteen other women, including Dr. Martha George Ripley and Sarah Burger Stearns, in forming the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association (MWSA). The MWSA led the state effort to allow women to vote, a right denied them when the United States was formed. An excellent public speaker, Nelson became one of the group's most sought-after orators. She became a paid lecturer for the National Woman Suffrage Association. Nelson, now a Red Wing resident, served as MWSA president from 1890 to 1896. President Nelson allied the MWSA with Ignatius Donnelly in 1893. Donnelly, a well-known Minnesota politician and famed orator, believed in a woman's right to vote. Nelson, Donnelly, and their allies, persuaded the Minnesota Senate to consider a suffrage amendment to the constitution. By a thirty-two to nineteen margin, the Senate voted to drop the word \\"male\\" from voting requirement language. But the bill did not become a law, because the House, under time constraints, did not vote on it. The MWSA continued to bring their amendment before future legislatures without success. Her heavy schedule convinced Nelson to recruit twenty-one-year-old Jeremiah Patterson, a freed slave and former student, to run her Belvidere farm south of Red Wing. Patterson became part of the community. He married Verna Gaylord and moved to Red Wing. In spring 1897, Nelson and Patterson opened the Equal Rights Meat Market. This black‚Äìwhite business partnership, most rare in Minnesota at this time, proved unsuccessful, but the Pattersons and their children continued to live in Red Wing. They stayed friends with Nelson. Julia B. Nelson continued her demanding work but by the winter of 1912, at age seventy-one, she was feeling the effects of bronchitis. In 1913, her physician suggested a long rest in Florida, and she followed his advice. But on her way south she stopped in Washington, D.C. to attend the national woman's suffrage convention. Nelson could not resist working, and in late fall 1914, started a strenuous train tour of North Dakota, working for women's voting rights. Weakened by this effort, Nelson died of pneumonia on December 24, 1914. A newspaper article reported she was \\"The Last of the Grand Old Women of Suffrage.\\" NotesReferences *Hurd, Ethel Edgerton.

It was originally released by the Daiei Motion Picture Company (later acquired by Kadokawa Pictures). Fight, Zatoichi, Fight is the eighth episode in the 26-part film series devoted to the character of Zatoichi. Plot A group of assassins stop a blind men pilgrimage making their way down the road. The assassins ask for Ichi, but they all claim variations of that name. They line them up against a building to look at their faces, but do not find Ichi and leave. One of the blind men brings Ichi out from his hiding place in the building, and they laugh at playing a prank on sighted men. Ichi goes on his way. A pair of kago bearers convince Ichi to transport him so they don't have to return with an empty fare. The assassins see him enter, and head up the road to ambush him. On the way, the bearers stop for a woman who has collapsed in the road with her infant. Ichi insists she takes the carriage. The assassins ambush and kill the mother. The bearers, running back along the road, find Ichi who comes back with them. The headmen of the city arrive just after. In the nearby city, they read the travel documents and learn that the woman, Otoyo, was traveling back home to meet her husband, Unosuke, a silkworm cocoon broker, in Miyagi Village. There is also a promissory note indicating Unosuke had run out of money while travelling, and left his wife behind as collateral in Nirazakizai. She seems to have paid off the debt and was travelling back to her husband with the baby boy. Because Ichi feels responsible for the woman's death, he volunteers to take the baby to Unosuke, and express his regrets. The village leader asks two villagers to accompany Ichi on the 60+ mile trip. They reluctantly agree. The leader also gives Zatoichi a lock of the dead woman's hair. The assassins note his departure, and follow to catch him once his guard is down. They catch up with him in a town a short ways away. He makes out the five of them and accuses them of killing the woman. Ichi offers to meet them to fight after he delivers the baby. One attacks and is killed, but the rest of them retreat vowing that the Monju clan does not give up once it has accepted payment. Ichi returns to find his companions have run off in fear. While continuing to following, the clan meets another boss, Hangoro, and asks for his help. He agrees and the two groups set off together. They catch up with Ichi and attack while he is changing the baby's diaper. Ichi defends himself and kills several of them. The four remaining men from the Monju clan survive and retreat. Ichi raises some money gambling, hoping to buy some softer diapers than the ones he's been scavenging from scarecrows and flags along the way. During his streak, the game boss offers some one-on-one gaming. The boss tries to rig the game, but Ichi catches him, evening the odds back up and winning a substantial amount. The boss's men follow and Ichi dispatches them while shushing them so the baby can continue sleeping. The next night, Ichi hires a woman of the evening to watch the baby while he gets some sleep. She thinks it's weird, but agrees, deciding it is an easier evening than usual. The next day, a woman thief, tries to use Ichi as cover from a victim. The victim wishes to punish the woman, even after Ichi returns the wallet. He poses as the thief's husband, then puts on a display of swordsmanship to dissuade him. The woman, Oko, after seeing how much money Ichi is carrying, offers to come with him and watch the baby. After some discussion he agrees to hire her. At the next inn, Ichi exchanges greetings with the blind men's pilgrimage which is headed out as Ichi's party is checking in. During the night, Ichi is being watched. After Oko steals a nightingale whistle and Ichi calls her out on it, she quits in a huff. Ichi manages to make amends using the child. When she takes the baby to pee and it splashes on some wrestlers, Ichi goes to talk to them. While he is letting them pummel him a bit, one of the watching assassins throws Ichi's sword away from where it had dropped, and states to the wrestlers that he has a prior claim. Some sand in the face and hand-to-hand scuffling gives Ichi time to reach his sword and he dispatches three more of the assassins. The leader, Waheiji, slinks away. During a scene on the road, the woman decides she will not steal any more. At last, they arrive at Miyagi Village. The woman doesn't want to give up the baby right away, but Ichi insists they must give him up that day as he was only looking after him because of responsibility. She wishes to stay with Ichi, but he pays her and sends her on her way. He brings the child to the house of Unosuke. When confronted with the documents, and the situation explained, he tears up the documents, and denies that he's ever been married. Furthermore, he accuses Ichi of trying to hit him up for support. He again denies having been married, and says he will soon be marrying the daughter of a boss in the area. Ichi sees what has happened and says he will take the child and raise him himself. Outside, Waheiji waits, hiding. Oko also finds Ichi and notes he is still holding the baby. He tells her that Unosuke leaving his wife behind as collateral was his way of getting rid of her. Oko is happy; now she and Ichi can raise the child together. But Ichi insists that she stop following him. At Unosuke's, Waheiji talks to him about Ichi, saying he knows his weakness, and asking for help in exchange for Unosake making a name for himself. At the temple, Ichi pays respects to Otoyo. The Monk suggests that the temple take the child, pointing out that Ichi is yakuza and a drifter, and that it would be best for the child. One of Unosuke's men comes demanding Ichi upon threat of burning the temple down. Ichi leaves the child at the temple to face his pursuers in the woods, even though the Monk offers to hide him.. Men with tiki torches encircle Ichi, the sound of fire whooshing through the air. During the fight, Ichi is set on fire a few places, but manages to roll and put out most of the flames just as Waheiji attacks. Ichi kills him, then calls out to Unosuke asking if he's sure the child isn't his. Unosake admits he was lying, and swears he will raise the baby to be a man. However, as Ichi is trying to retrieve his sword, Unosuke tries to jump him and is killed. Ichi leaves the baby at the temple and walks past Oyo without saying a word. On the road, he is passed by the blind man's pilgrimage, but continues on his own way.

Ratu Djoewariah (also known as Djoeariah; Enhanced Spelling: Juwariah) was an Indonesian actress active in the 1940s and 1950s. Biography Djoewariah originated from Lampung. She entered cinema in 1940, when she was signed by Union Films in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia), for Bajar dengan Djiwa. In her film debut, she played the role of Djuliah, a young woman who is sold to a loan shark by her father. This was followed by another two films, both produced in 1941. In Wanita dan Satria she appeared alongside Ratna Djoewita and Hidajat in the story of a playboy who ultimately receives his comeuppance, whereas in Asmara Moerni, Djoewariah as a maid who becomes the target of the affections of a young doctor (played by Adnan Kapau Gani). Union Films was closed in 1942 following the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, and film production throughout the 1940s was much slower than it had been under the Dutch. During this time Djoewariah acted on stage, touring with Fred Young's Bintang Soerabaja troupe; she is recorded as acting for them in a 1944 performance of the stage play Sehidup Semati. The occupation ended in 1945, and President Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesian nation. During the ensuing national revolution, Djoewariah remained active as a stage actress and kroncong singer, winning a vocal competition in September 1947; by this time she was a member of the Fifi Young troupe, named for its star. In 1949, as the revolution was winding down, Djoewariah returned to film with a role in the film version of Sehidup Semati. During the following five years she appeared in several roles of decreasing prominence. She made her last two films in 1954. In Karina (Gadis Pasaran), she portrayed a woman who had to become a radio singer in order to support her family after her husband is exiled to Papua. Meanwhile, in Kantjil Mas (Pedang dari Damascus), she portrayed a queen of Basan who attempts to wrest all power from her sister and co-queen before ultimately being defeated by a swordsman from Damascus. Ultimately, in 1954, Djoewariah left the cinema to return to the stage. Filmography Djoewariah is recorded as appearing in some 12 films. *Bajar dengan Djiwa (1940) *Asmara Moerni (1941) *Wanita dan Satria (1941) *Sehidup Semati (1949) *Bintang Surabaja 1951 (1950) *Irawaty (Aju Kesuma) (1950) *Musim Bunga di Selabintana (1951) *Surjani Mulia (1951) *Penjelundup (1952) *Tunggal (1953) *Kantjil Mas (Pedang dari Damascus) (1954) *Karina (Gadis Pasaran) (1954) ReferencesWorks cited    * (book acquired from the collection of Museum Tamansiswa Dewantara Kirti Griya, Yogyakarta) * External links * Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Actresses of the Dutch East Indies Category:20th-century Indonesian actresses Category:Indonesian female singers Category:Indonesian film actresses Category:Indonesian stage actresses Category:People from Lampung ","title":"Djoewariah"},{"id":"41637624","text":"Wich'iqucha (Quechua wich'i a large, wide-mouthed pitcher, qucha lake, \\"pitcher lake\\", Hispanicized spelling Vichecocha) is a lake in Peru.

Life The third son of Sir Charles Oakeley, 1st Baronet, he was born in Madras on 10 February 1791, and brought to England in 1794 by his family. After some years at Westminster School, he entered Christ Church, Oxford. In 1810 he took a first-class in liter√¶ humaniores, graduated B.A. on 23 February 1811, and obtained a senior studentship. He proceeded M.A. on 4 November 1813. Oakeley was ordained, and became in 1814 domestic chaplain to William Howley, then Bishop of London, to whom he owed subsequent preferment, and resided with the bishop for 12 years, until his marriage. He was presented by Howley to the vicarage of Ealing in 1822, and to the prebendal stall of Wenlock's Barn in St Paul's Cathedral. As a married man he took up residence at Ealing. By the death of his elder brother Charles, without male issue, Oakeley succeeded in 1830 to the baronetcy. In 1834 Howley, now Archbishop of Canterbury, presented him to the rectory of Bocking, Essex, a living once held by his father-in-law; the anomalous \\"archbishop's peculiar\\" of Bocking was abolished shortly after Oakeley's death. Both at Ealing and at Bocking, Oakeley was one of the first to carry out the system of parochial organisation by means of district visitors, weekday services, and Sunday-schools. Bocking contained many nonconformists, with whom Oakeley engaged in disputes about church rates. In 1841 Oakeley succeeded William Lyall in the archdeaconry of Colchester; and when the bishopric of Gibraltar was founded in 1842, it was offered to him, though he declined it. He died in London on 27 March 1845. He wrote for private circulation short poems, and a memoir of his father. Family On 5 June 1826 Oakeley was married at St. Margaret's Church, Westminster, to Atholl Keturah Murray, daughter of Lord Charles Murray Aynsley. She died on 26 January 1844.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and a mayor of the Borough of Ipswich. Early life James Foote was born on 2 March 1829 in either Frampton Cotterell, Gloucestershire, England or in Calne, Wiltshire, England, the son of Joseph Foote (a hat maker) and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Clarke). In January 1848, his father Joseph emigrated to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) as an agent of the Van Dieman's Land Colonial Mission Society and was appointed the resident Independent minister at Richmond within a few weeks of his arrival. Unfortunately, on 10 September 1848 Joseph died after being seized with an apoplectic fit while preaching the divine service. He immigrated with his mother, three sisters, his brother John Clarke Foote and his sister-in-law on the Emigrant arriving in Moreton Bay on 12 August 1850. During the voyage, there was an outbreak of typhus and around 20 people died. The ship on arrival in Moreton Bay was placed under quarantine, and was not brought into Brisbane until 28 September 1850. On 21 July 1863, James Foote married Catherine Keith (n√©e Cramb), the widow of James Keith, at Clydebank Cottage, Petrie Terrace, Brisbane. After some time, he established a grocery business in Ipswich to which he later added ironmongery. Politics Foote was an alderman of Borough of Ipswich in 1866-1869 and 1871 and was mayor of Ipswich in 1870. Foote was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the electoral district of West Moreton in the 1873 Queensland colonial election on 18 November 1873. He held the seat until the 1878 election on 15 November 1878. On 21 January 1879, following the defeat of the Douglas Ministry, the McIlwraith Ministry was sworn in. The Constitution required all of them to stand down and contest their parliamentary seats at ministerial by-elections. Only one of its members was opposed at election: John Malbon Thompson, the member for Ipswich, who was returned by a narrow majority at the poll on 1 February 1879 against Foote. On 26 October 1880, William Hendren, the member for Bundamba, resigned following his being declared insolvent. Foote won the resulting by-election on 12 November 1880. He held the seat until 12 May 1888. He was nominated as a candidate for Bundamba in the 1888 election. However, on 13 March 1888, he broke his leg when he stood up in his buggy and the horse suddenly moved forward, throwing him backwards. and after a few weeks decided to withdraw from the contest due to the broken leg. On 15 October 1892, Jean- Baptiste Isambert, the member for Rosewood, resigned following his being adjudicated as insolvent. Foote won the resulting by-election on 15 November 1892 and held the seat until the 1893 election on 6 May 1893. Later life James Foote died on 4 September 1895 at his residence in Ipswich; He had been ill for some months prior to his death. His funeral service the following day (5 September 1895) was an \\"imposing spectacle\\". The Old Ipswich Town Hall had its flag at half-mast, many businesses with which James Foote was associated closed for the day, and there was a very large funeral cortege. Led by the Baptist pastor, Rev. Young, the hearse was followed by all of James Foote's employees walking, James Foote's favourite buggy bearing a pet dog, then 60 to 70 vehicles and a considerable number of horsemen, while many citizens lined the route to the Ipswich General Cemetery, where a graveside service was conducted.

Myers (January 14, 1926‚ÄìNovember 23, 2001) was known as the ‚Äúgrandmother of American Indian Education in Minnesota.‚Äù A persistent voice for American Indian children and their families, Myers focused on education policy. She focused on learning opportunities for American Indian children. She also worked for curriculum and resource materials that reflected the American Indian history and culture for all Minnesota learners. Myers was a member of the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. She was not a professional educator. Her interest in education came first as a concerned mother of four children. As a child she was sent to an Indian boarding school. This fact shaped her life. She spoke little of her experiences there but harnessed the pain to inspire positive change. She left Duluth in the 11th grade to go to work in a military airplane factory in Oklahoma. Always an active member of her tribal community, Myers was urged to run for the Duluth School Board in 1971. She was elected, becoming the first non-White elected to public office in Duluth. Four years later, Myers wanted to take her advocacy to a statewide level. She asked Governor Rudy Perpich to be appointed to the Minnesota State Board of Education (SBE). Myers was its first American Indian member. From that position she was appointed to numerous other posts, including a term on the Education Commission of the States. Myers had great impact on the direction of the SBE. She twice served as its chair. She encouraged review of how American Indians were presented in textbooks, library materials, and the core curriculum. She fought for preservation of American Indian languages in the schools. Myers also insisted that every Minnesota student know something about Indian culture. Myers looked at proposed rules from the perspective of their effect on American Indian families. For example, she charged that educators ignored specific nutritional needs and dietary restrictions, such as sensitivity to dairy products among native youth. She also reminded policy-makers of the American Indian origins of the University of Minnesota Morris (UM-Morris) campus. With this history in mind, she advocated for native students to be able to attend UM-Morris without paying tuition. In the early 1990s Myers joined the staff of the University of Minnesota Duluth (UM-D) Medical School. She had been at UM-D since 1973, as part of the Education Department. While there she started sixteen of seventeen UM-D programs for American Indian students. As Co-Director of the Center of American Indian and Minority Health at the UM-D School of Medicine, she recruited students and gave them academic coaching. She also helped them with life‚Äôs details. For example, she regularly bought food for the UM-D medical students who might not have time to shop or be able to afford it. When Myers retired from UM-D in 1994, the university honored her by establishing the Ruth A. Myers Endowed Chair of American Indian Studies. Her interest in education showed in other ways as well. In 1986 Myers chaired the Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College (FLTCC) task force. The task force helped establish the permanent campus of Fond du Lac Community College in Cloquet. The FLTCC library is named the Ruth A. Myers Library in her honor. The Library contains a wealth of American Indian materials including the Anishinaabe and Minnesota regional collections. It also holds a juvenile/young adult collection of American Indian materials. During her lifetime Myers represented the interests of American Indians in many ways. She was on as many as seventy boards and commissions. She was named the Elder of the Year by the Minnesota Indian Education Association. Other awards included the Marvelous Minnesota Woman Award, the Marge Wilkins Award, the UM-D Chancellor‚Äôs Distinguished Civil Service Award, and University of Minnesota President Hasselmo‚Äôs Diversity Award.

She is perhaps best known for her china painting, a popular turn- of-the-century pastime. Born in Red Wing, Minnesota in 1870, she studied ceramics in Germany, watercolor painting in Minneapolis, and design in Chicago before settling in the Twin Cities, where she also found time to marry and raise a family. Internationally recognized, Paist won the gold medal in 1896 at Chicago's National Exhibition of Ceramic Workers for a collection of painted porcelain and garnered an award for a portrait on porcelain at the 1900 Paris Exposition. Over her long career, she exhibited work in the Twin Cities, Chicago, New York, and Detroit. Her nineteenth-century pieces, typical of the popular Realistic style, focused on flora and fauna, while her twentieth-century work rendered many of the same subjects in the more stylized manner of the Arts and Crafts movement. The busy artist also taught at the St. Paul Institute of Arts and Sciences (forerunner of the Science Museum of Minnesota), published watercolor studies and designs for pitchers, vases, and plate borders, and served as a porcelain judge at the Minnesota State Fair for more than twenty years. A member of the Twin City Keramic Club, she was also a frequent contributor and assistant editor of the national magazine for china painters, Keramic Studio.

Early life The son of James Parkinson, he was born at Witney, Oxfordshire, on 3 March 1653, and matriculated at Oxford on 2 April 1669 as a servitor of Brasenose College. He was admitted scholar of Corpus Christi College on 31 January 1671, but was expelled for abusing its President Robert Newlyn, in Lent 1674. Moving to Gloucester Hall, where he proceeded B.A. on 6 April 1674, and then to Hart Hall, he made a reputation by a speech at the Enc√¶nia, and was nominated fellow of Lincoln College by William Fuller the bishop of Lincoln, its visitor, in November 1674. He was admitted M.A. in November 1675, and took holy orders about the same time, though never holding any living. Expulsion from Oxford Parkinson was a successful college tutor, by his own account, but his Whig views made him unpopular with colleagues: Thomas Hearne wrote that he was \\"a rank stinking whigg, who us'd to defend ye Murther of King Charles 1st, and recommend Milton and such other Republican Rascalls to his Pupills\\". After Convocation, by decree of 21 July 1683, had condemned the tenets professed by the exclusion party, the fellows of Lincoln drew up a set of twelve articles against Parkinson, accusing him of advocating anti-monarchical and anti-Anglican principles, both in his private conversation, and from the pulpit of St. Michael's. Thomas Marshall, then Rector of Lincoln College, declined to act in the matter; and the fellows then appealed to Timothy Halton, Provost of The Queen's College and pro-vice- chancellor. He summoned Parkinson and bound him to appear at the next assizes. Parkinson appeared in court on 3 September 1683, and pleading not guilty to an indictment charging him with holding republican views, was released on bail. The next day Halton informed him that, in accordance with orders \\"from above\\", he must expel him from the university. The \\"bannitus\\" or proclamation of expulsion was posted on 6 September 1683. Parkinson appeared at several assizes and then before Chief-justice George Jeffreys in the Court of King's Bench, the proceedings against him continuing till April 1686. Later life After spending some years in London Parkinson was readmitted to the university early in 1689 by Gilbert Ironside, vice-chancellor, but failed to regain his fellowship. He published a vindication of his own conduct anonymously, and took some part in the controversy with the nonjurors. His Whiggish pamphlets probably recommended him to Archbishop John Tillotson, who found Parkinson the headmastership of King Edward's School, Birmingham, in 1694. Though Birmingham had already given its name to the extreme section of the Whig faction, Parkinson had a turbulent time there. His differences with the school governing body were such that in 1709 they unanimously resolved on his ejectment, alleging that the school under his direction had declined both in numbers and reputation. Costly proceedings in chancery had no result: Parkinson as headmaster maintained his position until his death; but no exhibitioners were sent to the universities, and the number of his pupils diminished. Rebuilding of the school started in 1701, and Parkinson was said by Hearne in his diary not to be a partisan as a teacher. Parkinson died on 28 March 1722, and was buried in the middle chancel of St. Martin's Church, Birmingham, near the altar steps. A stone, with inscription, was placed on the grave by his son. Works Among Parkinson's works were: * An Account of Mr. Parkinson's Expulsion from the University of Oxford, in the Late Times. In Vindication of him from the False Aspersions cast on him in a late Pamphlet, Entituled \\"The History of Passive Obedience\\" (anon.), London, 1689.

His only son, James, was baptised at Birmingham on 4 September 1700, and educated in his father's school. He matriculated at Oxford from Wadham College on 6 June 1717, proceeded B.A. on 20 February 1721, was admitted M.A. on 11 May 1724, was elected sub-dean, and died on 28 December 1724, being buried near his father.

The park is the largest of the five reserves in the municipality. Pellegrino Park features tennis courts, pavilions, playground equipment, picnic tables, restroom facilities, forest, and a two acre lake for fishing. The park began planning in 1969 and was established in 1972 on 31 acres of city owned land. The park was founded by Frank Pellegrino, the former president and chairman of the International Hat Company of St. Louis. The company operated one of its factories in Marble Hill until 1989, employing approximately 300 people. The park was built on land donated by the company located directly adjacent to International Hat's manufacturing plant. Pellegrino named the park in honor of his Italian-American mother, Maria Pellegrino. The plaque located at the entrance gate reads that the park is dedicated to her \\"as an expression of her concern for the betterment of her fellowman.\\"  History  Park founder Frank Pellegrino (1901-1975). =Planning= In 1969, Frank P. Pellegrino, president and chairman of the International Hat Company, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, made an offer to establish a new municipal park in Lutesville. The city was chosen by Pellegrino because of the International Hat factory located nearby, as a gift of appreciation to the local employees and townspeople. He believed in improving the quality of life in the places where his factories were built. This was the second park Pellegrino had built in a city with an International Hat factory, the first being George Tilles, Jr. Park in Oran, Missouri in 1962. =Construction= Pellegrino donated the land in 1969, agreeing to fund the development of the recreational facilities, park roads, playground equipment, a small pavilion shelter, and tree planting. At the time of its donation to the city, the land was an empty field. Construction of the park began in earnest, in 1970, following voter approval of Pellegrino's gift of land and cash to the city of Lutesville and Marble Hill. The two acre lake was completed by February 1971. Additionally, a road was cleared around the perimeter of the lake by that same month. The initial fifteen picnic tables were funded by a grant from the US federal government and were constructed by employees the Office of Economic Opportunity. While only one pavilion was originally slated for construction, a larger pavilion was added to the plans in 1971, after a late donation of funds by the board of the International Hat Company. According to the first Pellegrino Park board president, Gene Ward, it was decided that the large pavilion would be named the Frank Pellegrino Shelter, in honor of Pellegrino's 50 years of service for the International Hat Company. =Dedication= Ribbon cutting ceremony at the opening dedication to Pellegrino Park, June 4, 1972. The park was dedicated on June 4, 1972 to much fanfare. Over 800 individuals attended the dedication. Pellegrino, Missouri State Representative Frank Ellis, Lutesville Mayor Orville Liley, Marble Hill Mayor Leon Sander, and Bollinger Chamber of Commerce Vice President F. X. Peters took part in the ribbon cutting. The mayors declared June 4 to be \\"Pellegrino Appreciation Day\\" in their cities. Representative Frank Ellis read an official resolution passed by the Missouri House of Representatives thanking Pellegrino for his philanthropic donations to the state over the years. =Renovations= In 1976, Larma A. Wisely established a trust for the construction of a municipal pool in Pellegrino Park. In 1990, Marble Hill was bequeathed $682,000 by the estate of Larma Wisely. However, despite the explicit instructions of the trust, the municipal pool was never constructed inside the limits of the park. The pool was completed in 1992 and was named in her honor. Additionally, the park's roads were repaved under the administration of Mayor Russell P. \\"Bat\\" Masterson (2009‚Äì2011). Description The park is bordered on the north side by Missouri Highway 34. To the south and west, the park is surrounded by forest. To the immediate east of the park is located an industrial facility of MTX Loudspeaker. Inc. The site was formerly owned by the International Hat Company. Points of Interest=Pellegrino Lake= Pellegrino Lake is a two acre geographical feature located on the southern portion of the municipal park. In 2016, the Missouri Department of Conservation partnered with the City of Marble Hill to manage the health and population of fish living in Pellegrino Lake. Subsequently, Jason Crites, a fisheries management biologist with the department, became the first scientist assigned to monitoring the lake's ecology. On May 21, 2016, the Missouri Department of Conservation had a grand opening at Pellegrino Lake to promote fishing by teaching casting, knot tying, and other fishing skills. The city has expressed interest in the conservation project as a means of boosting tourism to Marble Hill from fishers. Activities In 2007, local organizers of Christmas in the Foothills, began sponsoring an annual ice block racing event in Pellegrino Park, a recreational activity in which individuals race to the bottom of a hill sitting on large blocks of ice. A tarp has used in the past during the event to avoid damaging the grass. In 2009, proceeds from the event were donated towards building a community stage at Magnolia Park. Some local residents have partaken in wood cutting for personal use. The City of Marble Hill allows for the legal extraction of timber from Pellegrino Park with a valid waiver procured from the city hall. Issues In 2012, new city officials on the Marble Hill board of alderman became concerned about the commercial timber policy instituted at Pellegrino Park. Alderwoman Beverly Johnson, newly appointed in 2012, questioned the city's earlier decision to seek a contract for a logging crew, in order to cut down trees and sell the lumber on a 14.8 acre stretch of woods. In 2014, 74 black oak, 10 white oak, 8 scarlet oak, 9 black cheery, and 12 miscellaneous trees were bid upon for timber extraction. The timber sale originated as a city initiative to raise some emergency capital to pay for municipal sewer repairs, rebuilding the city lagoon, and water infrastructure, due to past flooding, as well as state and federal fines for noncompliance of city upgrades.

Design and development From about 1950 to his death in February 1981, Iosif Silimon was Romania's most prominent glider designer, his aircraft distinguished by his initials. The IS-5 first flew on 14 June 1960. It was a shoulder wing cantilever monoplane developed from the URMV-3 IS-3 and of mixed wood and metal construction. The wings had an all wood structure and were plywood skinned. Mounted with 3¬∞ of dihedral, they were straight tapered in plan and built around a single spar with a forward torsion box between it and the leading edge. The tips carried the small streamlined bodies known as salmons, common at the time. The slotted ailerons, which filled about half the span, were ply skinned but with an outer fabric covering. The IS-5's pod and boom style fuselage was a metal monocoque with the pod ending abruptly at the wing trailing edge and a slender boom aft. The cockpit was enclosed by a single piece, side hinged, moulded perspex canopy. Rectangular airbrakes hinged outwards from the fuselage sides under the wing, each with an area of . The empennage was conventional, with a ply covered fin which was narrow at the top but faired into the boom above and below. It carried a fabric covered, rounded, unbalanced rudder, broad at its heel, as well as the straight edged tailplane placed just above the boom. There were rounded, spring balanced elevators with gaps at their roots to clear the fin and a small cut out for rudder movement; these control surfaces were ply skinned and fabric covered like the ailerons. The IS-5 had a short, rubber sprung skid under the cockpit and a fixed, unsprung monowheel under the wing, fitted with a brake. There was also a small extension of the fin to act as a tail bumper.

Major league sports teams The Major League Baseball team in Orange County is the Los Angeles Angels. The team, at the time known as the Anaheim Angels, won the World Series under manager Mike Scioscia in 2002. In 2005, new owner Arte Moreno wanted to change the name to \\"Los Angeles Angels\\" in order to better tap into the Los Angeles media market, the second largest in the country. However, the standing agreement with the city of Anaheim demanded that they have \\"Anaheim\\" in the name, so they became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. This name change was hotly disputed by the city of Anaheim, prompting a lawsuit by the city of Anaheim against Angels owner Arte Moreno, won by Moreno. The county's National Hockey League team, the Anaheim Ducks, won the 2007 Stanley Cup beating the Ottawa Senators. They also came close to winning the 2003 Stanley Cup finals after winning three games in a seven-game series against the New Jersey Devils. The National Football League left the county when the Los Angeles Rams relocated to St. Louis in 1995. However, upon the Chargers relocation to Los Angeles a year after the Rams' return to Southern California, they established headquarters in Costa Mesa, despite playing across the county line in Los Angeles County.

Located in the old Can Framis factory complex, the museum displays more than 250 paintings from the sixties to the present made by artists born or currently living in Catalonia. In addition to the permanent collection which is divided in three floors, Can Framis Museum has an area dedicated to temporary exhibitions named Espai A√∏. The permanent collection is updated periodically, and two new temporary exhibitions are opened every three months.

The Can Framis Museum of Contemporary Painting. The Can Framis Museum is located in Roc Boronat Street in the 22@ District of Barcelona, Spain. It was opened to the public on April 27, 2009. The museum is situated in an old textile factory that dates backs to the 18th century and was originally owned by the Framis family. Over the years it fell into disuse, becoming a monument to the industry of the area. The renovation was directed by the architect Jordi Badia, founder and director of BAAS architecture studio. This project consisted of restoring two current factory buildings and constructing a new one to link them, coinciding with the site of another former warehouse which, as a whole, forms a courtyard. This square contains a Jaume Plensa sculpture named Dell'Arte (1990), a donation from the Vila Casas Foundation to the city of Barcelona in 2012. All the interventions were made in situ using concrete in line with the old structure. Outside, the lime mortar which blends with the existing stonework merges with the exposed concrete of the new buildings. The fa√ßade then becomes a collage of textures, niches and coverings which reflect the different ups-and-downs of the building throughout time. The Can Framis Museum is located below the contemporary city roads, since the factory was built based on the former agricultural sketches prior to the implementation of the Cerd√† Plan (1860). The road surface is covered by ivy and other plants and the museum is surrounded by white poplars and oaks. Inside, the museum is divided in 36 rooms and there's an elevator in each of the three floors. The block is surrounded by Llacuna Street, T√†nger Street, Roc Boronat Street and Sancho de √Åvila Street and measures more than (with a capacity of indoor exhibition space).

He reportedly came to the American colonies in 1639 to escape persecution for his Puritan views. Later, he and other emigrants from the Massachusetts Bay Colony formed a new township on Long Island which they named Southampton. His last relocation was in 1666, when Pierson and many of his church followers left the Connecticut Colony and established a new church and township at Newark. Early life Born in Thornton, Bradford, West Ridings, Yorkshire, Pierson graduated B.A. from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1632. That year he was found to be an unlicensed curate at All Saints' Church, Pavement, York. He was ordained deacon at York in September 1632. Family genealogy says he was ordained in Newark-on-Trent and this is how he chose the name for the New Jersey town he founded later in life. On 19 March 1640 Pierson was summoned to the Court of High Commission, described as of Ardsley. He did not attend, and was fined. Family genealogy says he came to America in 1639, to escape persecution for his Puritan views. Pierson was in New England in the early part of 1640, and became ordained a Congregational minister in Boston. Pastor in New England In 1640 Pierson and a party of emigrants from Lynn, Massachusetts formed a new township on Long Island, which they named Southampton. There Pierson remained as minister of the congregational church for four years. In 1644 this church became divided and a number of the inhabitants left. They united with another body from the township of Wethersfield and formed, under Pierson, a fresh church at a settlement at Branford, within the jurisdiction of the New Haven Colony. Later life In 1666 Pierson moved again. The background to this was that a new charter was granted to the Connecticut Colony by King Charles II, incorporating New Haven with the colony, several of the townships of New Haven resisted. New Haven, rigidly ecclesiastical from the outset, had, like Massachusetts, made church membership a needful condition for the enjoyment of civic rights. No such restriction was imposed in Connecticut. Pierson disapproved of the Half-Way Covenant, and moved to pursue his vision of theocracy. The men of Branford, were therefore supported by Pierson, when they opposed the union with Connecticut. When their opposition proved fruitless, they left their homes, leaving Branford almost empty of people. Taking their civil and ecclesiastical records with them, they established a fresh church and township at Newark. There Pierson died on 9 August 1678. Works In 1659 Pierson published a pamphlet entitled Some Helps for the Indians, showing them how to improve their natural reason, to know the true God and the true Christian Religion. It is a short statement of the fundamental principles of monotheism, with a linear translation into the Quiripi language that Pierson made with Thomas Stanton. Verses in Latin by Pierson on the death of Theophilus Eaton have been published. Family Pierson married Abigail Mitchell, daughter of Matthew Mitchell and Susan Wood. The often repeated claim that she was Abigail Wheelright was proven wrong in Winthrop, Massachusetts by Col. Charles Banks and Mr. Horace Dickerman of New Haven. Abraham and Abigail's son, the younger Abraham Pierson was the first rector, from 1701 to 1707, and one of the founders of, the Collegiate School ‚Äî which later became Yale University; and their daughter Abigail married John, son of John Davenport (died 1670). At least six other children are mentioned.

These DIN knuckle threads also use a steep thread angle. Knuckle threads are an unusual highly rounded thread form. The large space between the rounded crests and roots provides space for debris to be shifted to not interfere with the thread, making this form resistant to debris and thread damage.  Standards  Knuckle threads with a flat 30 degree flank thread angle are standardized in DIN 405 for inch pitches and diameters ranging from 8 mm to 200 mm. A more recent standard DIN 20400 uses metric thread pitch and lists diameters from 10 mm to 300 mm. As DIN is a German organization, many instances of the DIN thread charts write numbers with a comma as the decimal marker. For a thread pitch p, the crest and root rounding radius is slightly less than p/4, and approximately the middle third of each thread flank is flat. The American Petroleum Institute (API) specification 5B lists a \\"round thread\\" for tubing, often referred to as \\"8 round\\" or \\"8rd\\" for 8 threads per inch. The only other pitch listed is 10 threads per inch. The thread angle at the flank is 60 degrees, and the crest and root rounding radius is approximately p/6 for threads of pitch p. Both the thread angle and rounding radius are more like ordinary ISO threads than DIN. For 0.125 inch thread pitch (8 threads per inch), the API round thread root radius is 0.017 inch, and the crest radius is 0.020 inch. API threads taper at 3/4 inch of diameter per foot of length. Many knuckle threads follow neither the DIN nor API standards, and are custom designed and fabricated for the particular application.  Applications  This thread form's good debris tolerance is the source of its use in oilfields, where it provides a leak-free connection in field use. Many European automobiles use a knuckle thread for their \\"tow eye,\\" an external threaded recess where a steel towing lug can be fitted. For example, some Porsche cars use DIN 405 Rd 20 x 1/8\\", and some BMW use a thread similar to DIN 405 Rd 16 x 1/8\\". This leadscrew's smooth rounded knuckle thread protects the actuator's white plastic nut from wear. Other applications use a knuckle thread's rounded edges to reduce the stress on softer materials at a point of connection. Some linear actuators use a knuckle thread to reduce the wear of the steel leadscrew against a plastic sliding nut. Firefighting respirator standard EN 148-1 \\"Respiratory protective devices - Threads for facepieces\\" lists a knuckle thread to connect metal and rubber parts. The rounded crest and root of knuckle threads resembles the Edison screw used on light bulbs, although bulbs have a much shallower thread angle than most knuckle threads. The root profile of knuckle threads resembles a ball screw thread, although the flank and crest of ball screw threads is often truncated.

It enables its users to avoid the Envalira Pass. It is amongst the highest road tunnels in Europe. Although situated within the borders of Andorra, the entrance at Pas de la Casa can only be reached via a bridge that is situated in France. The Andorra/France border post is therefore situated a short distance within France at the start of the access bridge. On the French side it is connected to the RN22 and on the Andorran side to the CGII. Plans for a tunnel were developed in Andorra during the late 1950s. In 1963, the Envalira Tunnel design tender was awarded to French engineers Semet and Phillip Studies, and subsequent negotiations were conducted for years and the access roads were improved. On June 1, 1999, Spanish companies FCC and NECSO (today ACCIONA) began construction work on the Grau Roig side of the massif; and on August 2, 1999, work began on the Pas de la Casa side. Operator & concession The Tunnel is operated by Globalvia (a joint venture between Spanish companies Caja Madrid and FCC) as a toll tunnel. The concession period is for 50 years.

It was written near the beginning of his writing career, his first published book having appeared in 1848. Collins met Dickens in 1851, and this story was the first contribution by Collins to Dickens's magazine Household Words. After several more pieces for the magazine, he became a paid member of staff in 1856.Wilkie Collins - A Short Biography Wilkie Collins Information Pages. Accessed 8 Oct 2014.Wilkie Collins's A Terribly Strange Bed The Victorian Web. Accessed 8 Oct 2014. In the story, an English visitor to a gambling-house in Paris stays overnight in the building, and is nearly killed by a specially constructed bed. The story in After Dark The story was one of six short stories by Collins in his collection entitled After Dark, published in 1856. In the preface, he acknowledged the painter W. S. Herrick as his source for the idea of this story. The stories in After Dark are linked by a narrative framework. At the beginning and end of the book are \\"Leaves from Leah's Diary\\": William Kerby, a travelling portrait-painter, is in danger of losing his sight, and is required by his doctor to cease painting for a while. His wife Leah realizes that destitution threatens. He is a good story-teller, and Leah has the idea of writing down his stories and publishing them. Each story has a prologue, added to the original story that appeared in Household Words. In the prologue of this story, now entitled \\"The Traveller's Story of a Terribly Strange Bed\\", Kerby is in a hotel in Liverpool, making a portrait in chalk of Faulkner, who is staying there while waiting to sail to Brazil. Kerby has with him a portfolio containing sketches he made in Paris, which interests Faulkner; one of the sketches is of a back street, which he recognizes, and he tells Kerby of his adventure in a house in that street. Story summary The narrator (Faulkner) is staying in Paris, after finishing his college education, and is exploring the amusements there. As a change from respectable establishments, he visits a low gambling house, where a variety of unsavoury characters are playing Rouge e Noir. He starts to win a great amount, which causes great interest and excitement among the other players. The atmosphere of the room, as a contrast to the respectable establishments he visited before, is powerfully described. This leads to a colourful depiction of a dissolute-looking elderly man, formerly a soldier in the French army, who encourages him to continue. The narrator continues to win, until the bank is broken and playing ends. The old soldier advises him to keep his winnings safely tied in a handkerchief, and they drink champagne with the entire company. The old soldier brings coffee for them both, as the other players leave; he seems anxious that the narrator should not be drunk when he goes home with his winnings. The narrator feels giddy and the old soldier advises him to stay there overnight, as it would not be safe for him to go home. The bedroom where he is to stay, on the first floor, is a peaceful contrast to the atmosphere below, but he is aware of possible dangers. He locks the door of his room and lies on the bed, which is a four-poster bed, with his winnings under the pillow. He cannot sleep. He tries to distract his mind by studying the items in the room, which include a wash-stand, chairs and a picture on the wall; thus a convincing image of the room is given to the reader. The moonlight in the room brings to his mind a moonlit evening after a picnic years ago, which he thought he had forgotten. This recollection is brought to an end when he becomes aware that the top of the bed is slowly descending. He moves away as the canopy, which contains a mattress, approaches and reaches the bed, evidently to suffocate the occupant. It is moved by a wooden screw which goes through the ceiling. After a few minutes the canopy gradually returns to its original position. He realizes his coffee was drugged, but too strongly for him to sleep as intended. He escapes from the room, which is on the first floor, through the window and down a drainpipe. He goes to a prefecture of police, where a sub-prefect, who happens to be discussing a recent murder with colleagues, becomes quickly interested in the narrator's story. He returns with the sub-prefect and several assistants, who arrest the residents of the gambling house and investigate the machinery which moved the bed canopy. The sub-prefect speculates that many individuals found drowned in the Seine were victims of the gambling house, with fake suicide notes. The old soldier was master of the gambling house; he is one of several later brought to justice.

It is continuous with Lunglei within 1 km area. It is 107 km from the state capital Aizawl. The place chosen by British missionaries, it is the home of Christianity and formal education in southern Mizoram. The oldest schools and hospital in southern Mizoram were established there. It still is the centre of administration of Baptist Church of Mizoram. The British used to call it (as a literal translation) \\"Lemonvale\\". The name is due to abundant lemon trees native to the place during the British occupation. It remained the principal centre of learning and music during the 20th century. History There is no available record of habitation in S√™rk√¢wn before the advent of British missionaries. James Herbert Lorrain and Frederick William Savidge, sent by Baptist Missionary Society of London, arrived in Lunglei on 13 March 1903 and chose their settlement at Serkawn. They started organising school, theology classes and medical services. The medical services were strengthened as a small dispensary in 1919 with the help new missionaries. The dispensary ultimately developed into the present day Christian Hospital Serkawn. The present Baptist Higher Secondary School was established as an extension of Savidge's school. By the 1930s there were some twenty isolated families in the village, and became a village of educated people. Between 1932 and 1946 the school authority held annual festivals, famously known as \\"S√™rk√¢wn Concert\\". Major activities included music concert and plays. This was the first ever entertainment festival of any kind in Mizoram. Geography and climate S√™rk√¢wn is only a kilometre away from the centre of Lunglei town, the district capital of the region. It is a smooth running hillock with rich natural vegetation. It is naturally covered by plenty of grassland, fir and banyan trees. Climatic condition is very mild with an annual average temperature of ~20¬∞C. Education and institutions Established by British missionaries, S√™rk√¢wn has the best developed school in southern Mizoram. The first elementary school was started by F.W. Savidge, and was gradually expanded to different levels. There are Serkawn Primary School, Serkawn Middle English School and Baptist Higher Secondary School. In addition Serkawn Christian College is a major institute of nursing. Other landmarks *Old Age Hall worth INR 1.15 million was constructed by Government of Mizoram in 2013 for public recreation. It consists of a recreational hall for senior citizens, health clinic and a nursery, along with a garage. *Sports stadium is currently under construction. The foundation stone was laid down by Lal Thanhawla, Chief Minister of Mizoram, on 23 September 2013. The project worth INR 241,808,000 was sanctioned by the Government of India.

At least one trillion fish are slaughtered each year for human consumption. Some relatively humane slaughter methods have been developed, including percussive and electric stunning. However, most fish harvesting continues to use methods like suffocation in air, carbon-dioxide stunning, or ice chilling that may not optimise fish welfare in some instances. Numbers According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a total of 156.2 million tons of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and other aquatic animals were captured in 2011. This is a sum of 93.5 million tons of wild animals and 62.7 million tons of farmed animals. 56.8% of this total was freshwater fish, 6.4% diadromous fish, and 3.2% marine fish, with the remainder being molluscs, crustaceans, and miscellaneous. The number of individual wild fish killed each year is estimated as 0.97-2.74 trillion (based on FAO tonnage statistics combined with estimated mean weights of fish species). The FAO numbers do not include illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, nor discarded fish. If these are included and over-reporting by China subtracted, the totals increase by about 16.6% to 33.3%. A similar estimate for the number of farmed fish slaughtered each year is 0.037 to 0.120 trillion. Mid-sized trout farms in the UK may process more than 10,000 fish per hour. They are often operated by only a few people, and it may be necessary to kill trout on short notice or even at night. Welfare indicators Research on fish suffering during slaughter relies on measures to indicate when fish are stressed. Some indicators used by welfare studies include * Behavior ** Swimming, gill movement, eye movement in response to body re-orientation, reaction when inverted, etc. * Electrical measures ** EEG, ECG, evoked responses, etc. ** These are quite accurate but also require high levels of expertise. * Hematic measures ** Cortisol, plasma glucose, plasma lactate, hematocrit, etc. * Tissue measures ** Indicators of stress in the muscle tissue, like lactic acid, pH, and the catabolites of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ** These indicators typically also correlate with lower- quality meat. Following electric stunning, as fish gradually resume consciousness, they begin to make rhythmic gill-cover movements. Based on EEG correlations, it is believed that stunned fish remain insensible until they have resumed rhythmic gill patterns. This can be used as a convenient assessment tool for the effectiveness of electric stunning. Inhumane methods In 2004, the European Food Safety Authority observed that \\"Many existing commercial killing methods expose fish to substantial suffering over a prolonged period of time.\\" The Aquatic Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health considers the following slaughter methods inhumane. Some ethicists have gone further and argued that there are no available humane slaughter methods for fish. Browning, H.; Veit, W. Is Humane Slaughter Possible? Animals 2020, 10, 799. https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10050799 =Air asphyxiation= This is the oldest slaughter method for fish and is considered inhumane because it can take the fish over an hour to die. One Dutch study found that it took 55‚Äì250 minutes for various species of fish to become insensible during asphyxiation. Fish that evolved for low-oxygen environments take longer to die. At higher temperatures, fish lose consciousness more quickly. Meat quality and shelf-life are also diminished when this method is used. =Ice bath= Also called live chilling, this method involves putting fish in baths of ice water, where they chill and eventually die of anoxia. Because chilling slows metabolic rate and oxygen needs, it may prolong the duration until death in some instances, with some cold adapted species taking more than an hour to die. On these grounds, the Farm Animal Welfare Council's 1996 report on farmed-fish welfare stated: \\"The cooling of live trout on ice after they have been removed from water should be prohibited.\\" In contrast, later research suggested that for warm Mediterranean species such as sea bream and sea bass, the method might at least be preferable to air asphyxiation, with fish showing lower levels of stress indicators. More recent research has shown that ice water is faster and less stressful than anaesthetics for killing tropical ornamental fishes like zebrafish.Wilson et al. 2009.Evaluation of Rapid Cooling and Tricaine Methanesulfonate (MS222) as Methods of Euthanasia in Zebrafish (Danio rerio). Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science 48, 785‚Äì789. =CO2 narcosis= Most often applied for salmon and trout, CO2 narcosis involves filling the fish water with CO2 to produce acidic pH, which injures the brain. The procedure is apparently stressful, as evidenced by fish swimming vigorously and trying to escape from the tank. CO2 immobilizes the fish within 2‚Äì4 minutes, but the fish remain conscious until subsequent stunning or killing. =Salt or ammonia baths= Salting involves application of salt to the container holding the fish, the salt applied should be just enough to weaken the fish. Salting of fish as a slaughtering (killing method) is only applicable to freshwater species =Exsanguination without stunning= Exsanguination is the process whereby an animal is cut so that it bleeds to death. Fish are cut in highly vascular body regions, and the process is stressful unless the animals are unconscious. If not stunned, according to behavioral and neural criteria, fish may remain conscious for 15 minutes or more between the time when major blood vessels have been cut and when they lose consciousness. Eel brains may continue to process information for 13‚Äì30 minutes after being decapitated, and some fish may remain sensible for 20‚Äì40 minutes after evisceration. Potentially more humane methods=Percussive stunning= Also known as knocking, percussive stunning involves hitting the fish's head with a wooden or plastic club, called a priest. One or two appropriate blows can disrupt the brain sufficiently to render the fish insensible and potentially even kill it directly. However, applying this method correctly requires training and effort. Percussive stunning must be applied one fish at a time and so is typically only used for large fish, such as salmon and trout. If the operator is skilled, percussive stunning can be among the most humane methods and can also yield high meat quality. One comparison of slaughter methods found that percussive stunning had the best welfare performance as measured by low hematocrit, low plasma glucose, low lactate, and high muscle energy charge. For some fish species, there are automated percussive stunning tools, such as a pneumatic club for salmon. However, building an automated machine to process, orient, percussively stun, and bleed bulk quantities of small fish would be difficult. =Pithing= Pithing, also known as ikejime (or ikijime), involves sticking a sharp spike through the brain of the fish. If done properly, it can kill quickly, however, if the operator misses the brain, the results may be stressful for the fish. As with percussive stunning, spiking is used to kill one fish at a time and so is mainly used for large species such as tuna and salmon. =Shooting= Shooting large fish is also possible. =Electrical stunning= Electricity can be more humane than alternatives if applied correctly. In addition to potentially producing unconsciousness quickly, stunning reduces the stress of restraint and being removed from water. If electrical parameters are not optimized, electrical stunning may produce immobility without loss of consciousness, which is inhumane. There is little public data comparing optimal stun settings found by researchers with the settings used in commercial slaughter operations, so it is unknown how effective real-world stunning is. In addition, proper stun parameters vary significantly by species. Electricity may introduce bleedspots, so proper settings are required. Modern systems Systems have been developed to slaughter large numbers of fish whilst maintaining welfare standards. A paper published by Jeff Lines and his collaborators in 2003 announced that stunning trout for 60 seconds in an electric field of 250 V/m r.m.s. with a sinusoidal waveform of 1,000 Hz rendered them permanently unconscious without degrading meat quality. A stunning system, called HS1, has been developed in accordance with Lines' study. The system first stuns fish and then keeps them unconscious, through electronarcosis, until death. The machine has been widely adopted in the UK, processing an estimated 80% of all UK trout killed for meat. According to the Humane Slaughter Association's James Kirkwood: \\"Before ten years ago there was no way to humanely kill farmed fish en masse ‚Äì they died slowly through suffocation when harvested from the water. This welfare benefit affects millions of fish.\\" Regulations No welfare standards exist for the trillion or more fish harvested from the wild each year. Since 2008, Norway has banned CO2 stunning. By January 2010, 80% of Norwegian fish-slaughter facilities had switched to either percussive or electrical stunning. Germany has banned use of salt or ammonia baths.

The factory was established in what was then a small town, a short distance to the west of Paris, called Chatou. In 1925 production was relocated to Nanterre in the west of the country. The business The first Ryjan car was being promoted at the Paris Motor Show in October 1919, and almost immediately, in 1920, the newly formed business started to produce their first model. The car The 1920 ‚ÄúRyjan HJ4‚Äù sat on a wheelbase and was priced by the manufacturer at 21,000 francs for a four-seater ‚ÄùTorpedo‚Äù bodied car and 25,000 francs for a four-seater ‚Äúconduite interieure‚Äù (closed sedan/saloon/berline) bodied car. The engine was a 4-cylinder 2,292cc unit. Other sources indicate that early cars used a 1690cc engine bought in from S.C.A.P. (Soci√©t√© de Constructeur Automobiles Paris), a specialist engine manufacturer located nearby. Five years later the manufacturer took at stand at the Auto Salon in October 1924. This car still had a S.C.A.P. engine, now of 1,614cc: customers were able to choose between a sidevalve and an overhead valve version of this engine. The 1924/25 car sat on the same wheelbase as before. The manufacturer‚Äôs listed price for a four-seater ‚ÄùTorpedo‚Äù bodied car had increased to 27,000 francs, however, reflecting general inflation in the French economy.

One of the city's finest examples of Renaissance architecture, it was almost completely destroyed by bombing in 1943. The entrance flanked by projecting bay windows is the only part of the building which has been restored. History The house was built in 1618 in the ornate Renaissance style. With its richly decorated facade and interior, it was known well beyond the bounds of the city. Located on Langenstra√üe in the city's Schlachte district, the building takes its name from a vinegar factory (German Essig means vinegar) on the property at the beginning of the 19th century, but it may also be a corruption of Esich-Haus, as the Esich family originally lived there. Combining living quarters, an office and a shop, it was typical of Bremen's old merchants' houses. In 1897, a wine bar called the \\"Alt-Bremer Haus\\" opened on the premises. The Bremen branch of the East Asian Company was founded there by local merchants in 1901. Essighaus was the location of a fainting spell by Sigmund Freud in 1909. This was not seen as a minor event by his student Carl Jung who saw it as evidence of the psychoanalyst's own neurosis. Rebuilding In 1956, after suffering serious war damage, the house was rebuilt by the architects Wilhelm Wortmann and Erik Schott who restored the lower facade from the remains. Following conversion work in 1985, the building now belongs to the Deutsche Factoring Bank. Since 1973, it has been listed as a heritage monument.

Life Born at Alkerton, Oxfordshire, on 19 May 1668, he was son of John Pointer, rector there from 1663 till his death in 1710, and Elizabeth (d. 1709), daughter of John Hobel, a London merchant. He was educated at Banbury grammar school, and then at Preston Deanery school, Northamptonshire. He matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, on 24 January 1687, graduating B.A. 1691, and M.A. 1694. Pointer took holy orders, being ordained deacon on 24 December 1693, and priest on 23 September 1694, and from 1693 until he resigned the office in 1732 he was chaplain to his college. According to Thomas Hearne, Pointer was removed for sodomy. Instituted in September 1694 to the rectory of Slapton, Northamptonshire, Pointer retained the post for life. He was lord of the manor of Keresley in Warwickshire, and in December 1722 he came into other property in the parish. He died on 16 January 1754 in the house of his niece, Mrs. Bradborne of Chesterton in Worfield, Shropshire, and was buried in the chancel of Worfield parish church on 19 January. A tablet was erected to his memory. Works Pointer was author of: * An Account of a Roman pavement lately found at Stunsfield, Oxfordshire, 1713; dedicated to John Holland, Warden of Merton College. In reply to criticism, Pointer created an advertisement containing praise from White Kennett, William Musgrave, and others. * Chronological History of England, 1714, 2 vols. Rather complete in description of events occurring after 1660. It was intended that the narrative should end with the peace of Utrecht (1713), but the second volume was not published until after the death of Queen Anne, when the history was brought down to her death. Six supplements, each containing the incidents of a year, and the last two with the name of \\"Mr. Brockwel\\" on the title-page, carried it on to the close of July 1720. Pointer was paid by Bernard Lintot for his work on it. * Miscellanea in usum juventutis Academic√¶, 1718. It contained characters, chronology, and a catalogue of the classical authors with notes for reading them. * A Rational Account of the Weather, 1723; 2nd ed. corrected and enlarged, 1738.

He was a prominent representative of the 1960s art movement and a major figure in Czech non-conformist avant-garde art. His drawings and graphical work earned him several awards and distinctions. Starting in 1965, his work was showcased regularly in group expositions in Czechoslovakia and abroad; he had his first solo show in 1966.  Life  After attending art school in Prague for four years (1952‚Äì56), Ne≈°leha studied at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague in the studio of monumental and applied painting headed by Professor Alois Fi≈°√°rek (1956‚Äì62). His diploma work, an abstract painting that he had designed for the Concert Hall in Hradec Kr√°lov√©, was banned and destroyed because it was judged ideologically objectionable by the communist state. To complete his degree, Ne≈°leha then used a collection of expressionist paintings that he had made in the course of his studies; he received a school prize for this work. In 1960 he joined a group of avant-garde artists in Prague called \\"Confrontations I and II\\". Through the activities of this group, he met graphic artist Vladim√≠r Boudn√≠k and became friends with theoreticians Franti≈°ek ≈†mejkal and Jan K≈ô√≠≈æ. His career was interrupted for two years by compulsory military service (1962‚Äì64). In 1966 he became involved in the activities of theoretician and art critic Jind≈ôich Chalupeck√Ω. In the spring of 1968 the French Government awarded him a scholarship to spend three months in Paris; he took this opportunity to visit various museums and monuments in France. He married Mahulena Hrom√°dkova (now , an art historian) later that year; their daughter Johanna G. Ne≈°lehov√°, a statistician, was born in 1977. In 1970 Ne≈°leha was offered a position as Professor of Drawing at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kassel, Germany; he had to decline, however, because the Czechoslovak state denied him the right to leave the country. Throughout the normalization period (1970‚Äì1989), he was a member of Jind≈ôich Chalupeck√Ω's circle. In 1987 he participated in the foundation of the group Zaostal√≠ (The Odd Ones) with painters Bed≈ôich Dlouh√Ω and Zdenƒõk Beran, sculptor Hugo Demartini, architect Karel Kouba, and composer Jan Klus√°k. In 1990 he received a grant from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. In the same year, he became head of the studio of painting at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague, a position he held until 2002. He was appointed full professor in 1991 and also served as vice-rector. He became a member of the M√°nes Union of Fine Arts in 1995. He died of cancer in September 2003.  Artwork  Ne≈°leha's work is rich in themes; it includes paintings, drawings, prints and photographs, as well as installations, collages, luminous objects and reliefs. His work from the late 1950s and 1960s is influenced by expressive and informel art currents in which work is guided by imagination. He depicts the drama of human existence in its various forms. In the mid 1960s, his work gradually becomes more figurative and eventually leads to paintings, graphic art and large-scale drawings that amplify detailed parts of the human body. Starting in 1968, he develops an interest in photography and explores the extent to which the objective depiction of reality can be influenced by an artistic viewpoint; in his work, objects from day-to-day life intersect with the grotesque, the ironic or the absurd. In the 1970s, he develops individualistic themes with surreal overtones; an interest in meditation and the symbolic value of light leads him to explore how light influences man's perception of objects and reliefs. The 1980s bring a different trend to the artist's work. Influenced by the romantic views of K. H. M√°cha and C. D. Friedrich, Ne≈°leha explores the relationship between man and nature and the symbolic nature of light through various themes. His paintings highlight paradoxes by combining reality and illusion; he gives relief to his work using doors and various other objects, assembled and sometimes animated with video. His pastels, drawings, and photographs reflect some of the artist's leitmotifs: nature, myth, and fate. By the end of the 1990s, his attention turns once again to light, which is now endowed with spiritual significance ‚Äî he uses light pastel to depict reality gradually disappearing in abstract colorful characters and visions. His creativity then comes to an end abruptly with his premature death in 2003.  Most prominent artwork = Paintings and objects = *Hlava III (Head III), 1969; oil, Heraklith woodwool slab, 91 x 66 cm.

It consists of a cenotaph in Portland stone with carved figures and panels in Westmorland stone. The memorial was designed by Lionel Budden, and the sculptor was H. Tyson Smith. It was unveiled in 1925 by Lieutenant-General Sir Richard H. K. Butler. The memorial is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History In 1922 Birkenhead's War Memorial Executive Committee organised a competition to design a war memorial for the town. There were 21 designs submitted and they were exhibited in the Birkenhead Art Gallery and Museum in February 1923. Of these, 20 were in the Classical style used by Edwin Lutyens for The Cenotaph in Whitehall, London. The designs were reviewed by Charles Reilly, the Professor at the Liverpool School of Architecture. Among the designs of which he approved was that of Lionel Budden, one of his former students, who was then a senior lecturer at the School of Architecture. The assessor for the competition was Major Gilbert Fraser, President of the Liverpool Architectural Society. He selected Budden's design, and this was approved by the committee. Budden appointed H. Tyson Smith as sculptor for the figures on the memorial, which was made by Joseph Davies of Birkenhead and H. A. Clegg and Sons of Chester. Initially it had been planned for the memorial to stand on the north side of Hamilton Square, which was vacant. However there was strong opinion that it should be on the east side of the square, opposite the Town Hall. This site was occupied by the Statue of John Laird, but it was agreed that the Laird statue should be moved to the west side of the square, and be replaced by the war memorial. The memorial was unveiled on 1 July 1925 by Sir Richard H. K. Butler, and the ceremony was attended by about 20,000 people. Following the Second World War, the names of those who fell in that conflict were added to the memorial. In 1987, the monument was removed for 2 months for repair work. In 2013 the monument was cleaned and restored. Description The memorial is in Portland stone with the figures and the names of those lost in Westmorland stone. The memorial stands about high. It has a rectangular plan, the longer sides facing east and west. The monument is set on three steps on a paved plateau, and is flanked by flagstaffs. On the longer sides are panels containing the names of those who fell in the First World War, and on the shorter sides, in smaller panels, are those who died in the Second World War.

He studied theology in Vienna and was elected \\"procurator of the Rhenish nation\\" (a kind of association of students from the Rhineland in Vienna) in 1460. He received his degree of Baccalaureus artium in 1465 and acted as a priest in Vienna from 1473. Thea abbot of Klosterneuburg in 1485 asked Sunthaym to compile a family history of Leopold III, Duke of Austria in connection with the duke's canonization. Sunthaym worked on a history and genealogy of the Babenberg family until 1489, perusing the histories of Otto von Freising and Thomas Ebendorfer. The finished work was exhibited in Klosterneuburg abbey as a richly illuminated parchment manuscript, the so-called Tabulae Claustroneoburgenses. The manuscript was supplemented by a great triptych based on the Babenberg family tree, made by the workshop of Hans Part during c. 1489 to 1492, for the benefit of the pilgrims visiting Klosterneuburg (now in the monastery museum). In 1491, the work was published in print by Michael Furter of Basel. As a result, Sunthaym became widely known as a historiographer. He was a member of the Sodalitas litteraria Danubiana (\\"Danubian literary society\\") in 1498, and emperor Maximilian charged Sunthaym with a major project of reviewing the genealogy of the House of Habsburg. In 1504, Sunthaym was a member of the chapter of St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna. In 1505, he presented his Habsburg genealogy to the emperor. Sunthaym's geographical works, covering Austria, Bavaria, Swabia, the Alsace and parts of Franconia, are an important source for the economy and demographics of these regions at. the end of the medieval period.

He was elected about 1534 fellow of Corpus and also of the college of St. John the Baptist at Stoke-by-Clare, Suffolk, where Matthew Parker, to whose friendship Pory owed preferments, was dean. In 1557 Pory was elected Master of Corpus, and on 13 December of the year following he became vice-chancellor of Cambridge University. From 1555 to 1564 he was rector of Bunwell, Norfolk; from 1555 or 1556 till 1561 vicar of St Stephen's Church, Norwich; from 1558 to 1569 rector of Landbeach, Cambridgeshire; from 21 December 1559 prebendary of Ely Cathedral; from 19 August 1560 rector of Pulham St. Mary, Norfolk; and from 1 May 1564 prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral, resigning this prebend in 1567 for the seventh stall at Westminster Abbey.

He also took part in the divinity act held before the queen, on the thesis major est scriptur√¶ quam ecclesi√¶ auctoritas. He afterwards attended Elizabeth when she visited Oxford in 1566, and was incorporated there. During his mastership a new library was fitted up in his college, the north side of which was reserved for the manuscripts which Parker was intending to present. Pory also persuaded him to increase the endowment. Pory declined to resign his mastership when disabled by failing health from performing his duties; and Parker instigated complaints against him before the ecclesiastical commissioners. Pressure was applied before Pory withdrew, and Thomas Aldrich was appointed master of Corpus on 3 February 1570. Pory gave up all his preferments about the same time.

The lead characters in the movie are Kyra Sedgwick, Kiefer Sutherland and Stockard Channing. The film depicts the relationship between a sister and her brother, who is suffering from the fatal disease AIDS. Plot Natalie Haddad (Kyra Sedgwick) is a talented photographer living in New York City who is undergoing a financial crisis. Her friend Julia (Stockard Channing) finds for her a two-day job in Boston for US$20,000, which Natalie has to accept. Upon her arrival at Boston, she finds that her arrogant gay brother Roy (Kiefer Sutherland), a successful designer, had hired her. Their relationship was broken 10 years earlier and since then they had not seen each other. When Natalie finishes her assignment, her brother Roy asks her to stay for the next day, as he has organised a birthday party for himself. After the birthday party, Roy tells her that he is suffering from AIDS. Although Roy is insufferably snobbish and manipulative, he manages to exert a curious control over Natalie, forcing her to confront several disturbing, long-suppressed memories of her past (shown in black-and-white flashbacks). She agrees to stay with him and in due course of time their fraternal relationship develops again.

Rotten Tomatoes rated its freshness at 78%. Jerry Weinstein of Culturevulture.net said: \\"The awkward set-up finally gives way to a portrait of a family of two, who are at last there for one another.\\" Weinstein praised Sedgwick and Sutherland's portrayal of sister and brother, saying, \\"Although Behind the Red Door is in parts a schematic, more than a nuanced drama, both Kyra Sedgwick and Kiefer Sutherland portray sister and brother with dignity.\\" He also praised the portrayal of a gay man suffering from AIDS and expressed hope that Viacom's corporate \\"synergy\\" might \\"be leveraged in such a fashion that it can make a positive difference, fostering dialogue and promoting understanding\\". Multichannel News liked the film, calling it \\"[a]n elegant little Showtime telefilm . . . saddled with a truly unfortunate name\\". Houston Chronicle critic Ann Hodges said that it \\"comes close, at times, to sentimental melodrama, but it recovers\\" and \\"builds to a two-hanky ending.\\" In a brief review, the Chicago Tribune noted the \\"sensitive performances\\" by Sedgwick and Sutherland, but found the murder subplot to be \\"unnecessary\\". On the other hand, The New York Times critic Anita Gates wrote a mainly negative review, concluding that despite the director's evident personal connection to the material (her own brother had died of AIDS), the film \\"is undermined by simplistic dialog and one-note direction\\" as well as by what Gates found to be the unpleasant personalities of the main characters.

Initially he developed the practice in eastern Shropshire and Staffordshire and continued to work for many of clients of Francis Smith after Smith's death in 1738. Houses by Smith which Baker continued to work on included Mawley Hall in Shropshire, Swynerton Hall in Derbyshire and Wingerworth Hall in Derbyshire. He always had a close relationship with the innovative Shrewsbury architect Thomas Farnolls Pritchard.Ionides J. \\"Thomas Farnolls Pritchard of Shrewsbury, Architect and ‚ÄòInventor of Cast Iron Bridges‚Äô\\". The Dog Rose Press, Ludlow 1999, 31-34 In 1743 at Ludlow, both Prichard and Baker put forward plans for the Buttercross, but it was Baker who was selected to do the work. In 1746 Baker was paid for the plans and work at the Royal Shrewsbury Infirmary, but the plans are signed by Thomas Farnolls Pritchard. It is likely that Pritchard was working under Baker on this project. Again for the building of St John's Church, Wolverhampton it is likely that Pritchard was the supervising architect working under Baker. In 1775‚Äì1775, after Baker's death, Pritchard continued Baker's survey work at Powis Castle.‚ÄúColvin‚Äù 784 =The Ludlow Buttercross and Henry Arthur Herbert= Most notably Baker gained the patronage of Henry Arthur Herbert (1703‚Äì72), who became Earl of Powis in 1748Henry Arthur Herbert was the 1st Earl of Powis of the 2nd creation and between 1743 and 1748 was Lord Herbert of Chirbury. He was the son of Francis Herbert of Oakley Park. Oakly Park was his main country home until 1771, when he sold it to Lord Clive ('Clive of India') and moved into Powis Castle. The National Trust. \\"Powis Castle\\" guidebook. 1996. p. 58.J. Smith \\"Herbert Correspondence\\", Univ. Wales Press 1963, 2-5. Ludlow Buttercross from the east Baker would have known Henry Herbert from his Ludlow connections. Herbert was the Whig Member of Parliament and a member of Ludlow Town Council when Baker was awarded the contract to build the Ludlow Buttercross. Also in 1743 Henry Herbert relinquished his position as Member of Parliament when he inherited Powis Castle and became Lord Herbert of Chirbury. In 1735 he had been appointed Custos Rotulorum of Montgomeryshire and Lord-Lieutenant of Shropshire. and this now provided him with a power base to dispense patronage in both Montgomeryshire and Shropshire. Baker's design of the Buttercross (which housed the Ludlow Council Chamber) is based on James Gibbs \\"A Book of Architecture\\" (1728). Clearly the Buttercross impressed him. Between 1748 and 1758 he got Baker to alter his house at Oakly Park at Bromfield, just outside Ludlow. Then, between 1748 and 1754 Baker undertook repairs at Powis Castle, possibly in preparation for Herbert to move into the castle. Also in 1748, Herbert got William Baker to design and build the Town Hall at Montgomery.J D K Lloyd, ‚ÄòMontgomery Town Hall and its Architect‚Äô Montgomeryshire Collections, 1958, 128‚Äì132 The new Town Hall was intended to accommodate the Court of Great Sessions when it met at Montgomery and over which Herbert presided as Custos Rotulorum. At Bishops Castle Baker submitted designs for a new Town Hall to Herbert in 1745, but it was slightly later that the Town Hall was built and to modified designs. Richard Baker His son Richard Baker (1743‚Äì1803), continued the practice after his father's death in 1771. Richard seems to have practised mainly as a building surveyor, and there are few buildings that he designed.\\"Colvin\\" 93.

A major interdigitation of Australian and Malesian flora is estimated to have occur in the late Tertiary and Quaternary time. Vegetation types Major forest types in Malaysia are lowland dipterocarp forest, hill dipterocarp forest, low hill dipterocarp forest, oak-laurel forest, montane ericaceous forest, peat swamp forest and mangrove forest. In addition, there also smaller areas of freshwater swamp forest, heath forest, forest on limestone and forest on quartz ridges. Habitat The forests in Malaysia are mostly dominated by trees from the dipterocarp forests. The dipterocarp forest occurs on dry land just above sea level to an altitude of around 900 metres. Other than that, the forest canopy is very dense where a small amount of sunlight can penetrate it. Because of that, the undergrowth plants are usually poorly developed and believed to be impenetrable. A large amount of rainforest has been destroyed due to agricultural or commercial purposes, and also by severe wind and lightning storms.

During their membership, the academicians can access a fixed personal budget as well as the central research budget. The latter serves to fund collaborative academic projects, workshops or symposia. Eligibility for membership is dependent on the completion of i) an outstanding doctorate no more than three to seven years before election and ii) at least one additional outstanding academic piece of work. Members of the BBAW, the Leopoldina, and the Junge Akademie are at liberty to put forward candidates for membership. The Junge Akademie also uses calls for application to attract new members. In addition, interested candidates are invited to put themselves forward independently. New members are elected on an annual basis by the General Assembly of the Junge Akademie on the one hand and its two parent academies on the other. The average age of the Akademie's membership is 35; its gender mix is almost equal and is not subject to any quota system. Members are equally spread across the natural sciences and the humanities/social sciences, and also include representatives from the fields of art and architecture. = Board = The Junge Akademie is managed by its Board, which consists of a Spokesperson and four further members of the Akademie. The Spokesperson is granted guest status on the boards of the two parent academies (BBAW and Leopoldina). The Board is elected by the General Assembly at its spring meeting, and has a term of one year, beginning in the summer after the annual celebration event. = Advisory Board = Founded in 2002, the Advisory Board is concerned with the substance of the Junge Akademie's work. It currently has seven members (2014 figure), and provides the Junge Akademie with both guidance and support. The Advisory Board consists of ‚Äúhigh-ranking figures from the fields of academia, the economy, culture, and the media‚Äù. They are each elected for a term of three years, and are to ‚Äúact as a critical observer and advisor of the Junge Akademie, providing ideas and constructive criticism within the framework of specific projects and encouraging or posing questions to the Junge Akademie‚Äôs members‚Äù. They are also responsible for supporting projects at the interface between academia on the one hand and politics, the economy, and culture on the other. = Budget & Funding = Since 2011, the Junge Akademie is no longer a project, but an independent institution. Its budget is permanently integrated in the overall budget of the Leopoldina. The Junge Akademie is state-funded; the Federal Ministry of Education and Research contributes 90 per cent while the state of Saxony-Anhalt and the Berlin- Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities contribute 5 per cent each.  Activities  The Junge Akademie is at liberty to choose how and where it works. Unlike the situation in many other national academies, members of the Junge Akademie do not receive any direct instructions: It is up to them to decide which interdisciplinary projects make it onto the agenda. Each year sees members meet at three plenary sessions to discuss their current research projects and propose joint undertakings and publications. An annual ideas workshop also gives members an opportunity to develop new initiatives and projects.Frederike Buhse, Die Junge Akademie an der Berlin-Brandenburgischen Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Deutschen Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina (Hrsg.): Die Junge Akademie. Berlin 2013. S. 4. Subject-specific work is frequently carried out by Research Groups. = Research Groups = The Junge Akademie's General Assembly establishes Research Groups (RGs) proposed by its members in order to promote interdisciplinary co-operation. RGs are open to all interested members. Working on a co-operative basis, they carry out studies, publish the results of their research, and organise symposia and cultural events. Over 40 of these interdisciplinary groups have been brought into existence since the founding of the Junge Akademie. In addition to research topics, they also deal with issues of general societal relevance, placing special emphasis on the fields of education and science policy. = International Contacts = The Junge Akademie was the world's only institution of its type when founded in the year 2000.

Each edition is dedicated to a specific topic, which is examined from the perspective of a variety of academic disciplines. In addition, the magazine provides insights into the Akademie's activities, introduces new members, and presents the results of the various Research Groups. The work of the Junge Akademie is also presented and discussed in a large number of other publications.  History  The Junge Akademie is a joint project of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW) and the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. It was established as a result of its founders‚Äô critical stance on ‚Äúthe anomalies of the German academic system, which offers young academics few opportunities to develop without restriction and participate in the shaping of the system itself.‚Äù The inspiration to establish the world's first academy for young academics came from Paul B. Baltes, former director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. It was in 1996 that he presented his idea to Dieter Simon, then president of the BBAW. The latter refined the blueprint, and in the same year presented it to an internal committee responsible for organising the celebration of the 300th anniversary of the BBAW. The celebration committee in turn recommended to the General Assembly that ‚Äúthe proposal made by Paul B. Baltes and Dieter Simon regarding the foundation of an academy for highly talented young academics be adopted, with the new institution to be established upon the election of founding members during the anniversary year‚Äù. When passing the concept for establishment of the ‚ÄúYoung Academy at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities‚Äù at a session held on February 12, 1999, the General Assembly suggested that the idea should be implemented in co-operation with the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, with which the BBAW was already planning a close partnership in the medium term. Subsequent discussions between the presidents of the two organisations quickly bore fruit, and before the beginning of the summer of 1999 the Leopoldina announced its decision in favour of getting involved in the Junge Akademie ‚Äì and with it the initiation of the first joint project of the nascent co-operation between the two organisations. The Junge Akademie was founded by its two parent academies on June 30, 2000, and initially took the form of a five-year project based at the BBAW under the auspices of Edelgard Bulmahn, then Federal Minister of Education.Pressemitteilung des Bundesministeriums f√ºr Bildung und Forschung vom 30. Juni 2000: ‚ÄûJunge Akademie‚Äú f√ºr wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchs gegr√ºndet. Bulmahn: ‚ÄûRaum f√ºr kreative Ideen und innovative Forschungsans√§tze schaffen‚Äú (PDF; 19 kB). Aufgerufen am 23. Oktober 2013 The project phase of the Akademie's existence was financed by funds from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Volkswagen Foundation (limited to 2005, subsequently extended to 2008). The positive results arrived at by a project evaluation carried out in 2005 convinced the Federal Ministry of Education and Research to extend financing for another five years (i.e. until 2010). An expert commission re-evaluated the Junge Akademie in 2007, concluding in its final report that ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] as an instrument for the provision of institutional support to highly gifted young academics in Germany, the Junge Akademie is not only unique, but also incomparable with other German academies in terms of its promotion of young talent.‚Äù With the ten-year project phase having finished in 2010, 2011 saw the Junge Akademie become an institution operated on a permanent basis and firmly anchored in the budget of the Leopoldina.Die Junge Akademie: Aufgaben und Arbeitsformen. Eingesehen am 23. Oktober 2013. It has since been financed by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research as well as the federal states of Saxony-Anhalt, Berlin, and Brandenburg.

Constructed for the Royal Virgilian Academy of Science and Arts (the \\"Accademia Virgiliana\\"), the theatre in Mantua was designed in late Baroque or early Rococo style by Antonio Galli Bibiena and erected between 1767 and 1769. With a bell-shaped floorplan and four rows of boxes, it followed the new style of theatres then in vogue. It was intended to host both theatre productions and concerts, and scientific discourses and conventions. Bibiena also provided the monochrome frescoes in the interior. The theatre is now considered to be his most important work. It was opened officially on 3 December 1769. A few weeks later, on 16 January 1770, thirteen-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played a concert here, with resounding success. His father, Leopold Mozart, wrote about the theatre: \\"In all my life, I have never seen anything more beautiful of its kind\\". In 1773, Giuseppe Piermarini, who constructed the neighbouring palazzo for the Accademia Virgiliana, designed and built the fa√ßade of the theatre. Still used for its original purposes, it now can also be visited by tourists as one of Mantua's museums. The theatre is relatively small, with a scene 12,3 metres wide and 5,6 metres deep, and a maximum audience of 363 persons.

Background  Olav Torkelsson belonged to a noble family that owned properties on the islands of Finn√∏y in Rogaland. He was mentioned for the first time in 1511, when he was a priest in Voss in Hordaland and a canon in Bergen, both in Bergenhus len. By 1519, he had gone to Bergen to be an archdeacon. He was still there three years later, in 1522, when the Bishop of Bergen, Andor Kentilsson, died. The Cathedral Chapter of Bergen asked the King of Denmark and Norway, Christian II, about his preferences for the successor. He replied that he would like to see the Dean of the Chapter, Hans Knudsson, chosen but he allowed the Cathedral Chapter to have the election itself. On 15 April 1523, the canons chose Olav Torkelsson as their next Bishop and he was appointed nine weeks later, on 1 July, by Pope Adrian VI. Archbishop of Nidaros, Olav Engelbrektsson, then consecrated Torkelsson as the Bishop of Bergen and the new Bishop automatically became a member of the Riksr√•d.  The Bishop of Bergen  In the meantime, Christian II had fled from the two kingdoms. In the autumn of 1523, Olaf Torkelsson and the rikshovmester (Lord High Steward) of Norway, Nils Henriksson of Austr√•ttNils's wife and widow, Inger Ottesdotter R√∏mer, was the inspiration of Henrik Ibsen's 1857 play, Lady Inger of Ostrat. (who died soon afterwards), answered the summons of the Bishop of Stavanger, Hoskuld Hoskuldsson, to attend the meeting in Bergen to deliver the support at the Bergenhus Fortress to Christian's uncle, Frederick, the new King of Denmark. For their efforts, he appointed Torkelsson, Hoskuldsson and Vincens Lunge (the son-in-law of Nils Henriksson) to be advisers to the stattholders, as well as the Archbishop of Nidaros Olav Engelbrektsson, for Norway north of Lindesnes. On 5 August 1524, at the meeting of the Riksr√•d of Norway in Bergen, all the councilors, including Torkelsson, swore their allegiance to King Frederick, two days before his coronation in Copenhagen. To reward the Bishop, the new King added to the Diocese of Bergen the lands of Hardanger, Nordfjord and Troms but, in 1528, the Diocese lost Troms and the parish of Gloppen.  The Turnstile of Troubles  One of Olav's first acts as the Bishop was to strengthen the finances of his Cathedral Chapter. To do that, he bought the deanery, which paid the annual pension of the Dean, but it was a royal prelature. So he got into a lengthy dispute with the King and it lasted until 1528, when the Deanery was returned to the King. Torkelsson's support of Frederick I did not keep him out of trouble. The outgoing Governor of the Bergenhus len, J√∏rgen Hansson, before he followed Christian II to exile in the Netherlands, counted the Bishop as one of the supporters of his King and called him \\"true and good\\" [ tru og god ].Terje Bratberg, \\"Olav Torkellsson\\", Norsk biografisk lekikson, retrieved 13 January 2014. But that did not keep the Bishop from being kidnapped in 1525 by Christian II's men in Sandviken, Norway. He was released only after paying a ransom and promising his fidelity to their King. That did not please the new Governor of the Bergenhus len, Vincens Lunge, who was also the rikshovmester [ Lord High Steward ] of Norway. He believed that the Bishop's loyalty was being questioned so he persuaded Olav to promise his allegiance to Frederick once more. Olav was so depressed by this whole experience that he was ready to resign and retire to a monastery. But he remained in Bergen. The relationship between Torkelsson and Lunge went from good to bad after 1526, when Lunge allowed the Lutherans to stay in Bergen. They made it difficult for Olav to assert his authority over the whole city as its Bishop. The local clergy and monks were not any better. Some of them were supporting the teachings of Martin Luther and a few more were even making plans to marry. Ole Peter Grell, \\"The Reformation in Norway: a political and religious takeover\\", in: Aspeket der Reformation im Ostseeraum [ Aspects of the Reformation in the Baltic Sea Area ], Nordost-Institut Archiv, Band XIII ( 2004 ), page 128. Lunge's personal chaplain, Soren Clemmentson, and the latter's own assistants went to every tavern in Bergen with the announcement that the parishioners did not have to donate any more money to the cost of candles for the Mass in the Cathedral. The news pleased many of the people, especially the merchants from the Hanseatic League, who were not pleased with the Bishop's obsession with the finances. They called him \\"Bishop Butter- barrel\\". Once in a while, they would march around his residence as they drummed on empty butter barrels and sang pasquinades.‚ÄúOration om Mester Geble‚Äù, page 27, note 8. In 1527, Olav complained to a fellow bishop about the dissolute lives of the Dominican friars, who had been spending their evenings everywhere but at their monastery. Then his relationship with Lunge went from bad to worse when Lunge demanded that the Bishop put his journeymen at the disposal of the King. By then, the fight was out of the Bishop. He began to spend more and more time at his Ask estate near Ask√∏y in Hordaland. King Frederick made the conditions in Bergen even more difficult for Bishop Olav. In 1528, the King secularized the Nonneseter Monastery in Bergen and gave it to Lunge to be used as a private ( and fortified ) residence. The King also gave letters of protection to two Lutheran preachers for them to start preaching in Bergen in 1529, inflaming the atmosphere so much that one of them almost had his house blown to the heavens. Bishop Torkelsson then told Archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson that he had had to leave the town to avoid the harassment from Lunge and de sect lutheriana.Ole Peter Grell, editor, The Scandinavian Reformation : From Evangelical Movement to Institutionalisation of Reform ( Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1995 ), , pages 97-98. At that time, Bergen was the home of about 6,000 but 3,000 of them were German. They were allowed to have their own church but the Lutherans took over three of the city's 26 churches for their own services. Then it was Eske Bille's turn. Having just succeeded Lunge as the Governor of the Bergenhus len and the rikshovmester, he wanted to expand and strengthen the defenses of his headquarters, the Bergenhus Fortress, but the Cathedral of Christ Church, the Royal Chapel of the Apostles, the Bishop's Palace, the Dominican convent and other ecclesiastical buildings were all sitting too close to the walls of the castle. He was the brother of a Catholic bishopThe brother was Ove Pedersson Bille, the Bishop of Aarhus in Denmark. When the Reformation came to Denmark, he was sent to prison for refusing to abandon the Catholic Church but, because of his loyalty to the King and of his family's connections, he was allowed to retire to a monastery for the rest of his life. He died in 1555. and himself a faithful Catholic but he still demanded that these buildings should be demolished at once. The Bishop and the Cathedral Chapter both agreed in 1531 in exchange for the wealthy Munkeliv Abbey as their compensation.Heiberg and Petersen, Norske Rigs-Registranter, pages 25-26. In November of the same year, Christian II returned and reconquered Norway. He went to the Riksr√•d [ National Council ] and asked for its support but three of the most important of its members, Olav Torkelsson, Eske Bille and Vincens Lunge, all refused to betray Frederick I. Eventually, in July 1532, Christian II was captured and imprisoned, ending the War of the Two Kings. The show of unity upset Archbishop Engelbrektsson, who had been feuding with Lunge since 1529. He felt that Bishop Torkelsson was aiding and abetting the enemy but the Bishop assured him in 1533 that he was willing to be friends with him again.  Decline and Death  Since he became the Bishop of Bergen, Olav Torkelsson had been a member of the Riksr√•d. But, after the great events of 1523 and 1524, he attended very few meetings. In 1531, he did not even go to any of the meetings at all besides the united Herredag [ Assembly of the Nobles ] in Copenhagen. When he missed the national assembly in Bud in 1533, he pleaded poor security and poor health. He was indeed very ill at that time. After a long illness, he died on 25 May 1535 at his estate, the Dukstad manor near Voss. Olav's death spared him from the fate that befell his fellow bishops two years later, when the Reformation came to Norway from Denmark. Archbishop Engelbrektsson had to flee to exile and safety but two of the three other bishops of Norway were captured and imprisoned. The Bishop of Stavanger, Hoskuld Hoskuldsson, already elderly and sickly, was left alone as long as his ally, Eske Bille, was the rikshovmester but, as soon as Bille was transferred, the Bishop was taken to prison, where he quickly died. The Bishop of Hamar, Mogens Lauritss√∏n, died in captivity in 1542. The third bishop, Hans Rev of Oslo, went over to the Lutheran side and stayed in office for eight more years before he died. He was joined by Olav Thorkelsson's archdeacon, Gjeble Pederss√∏n, who became the first Lutheran Bishop of Bergen. Thomas B[enjamin]. Willson, History of the Church and State in Norway from the Tenth Century to the Sixteenth Century (Westminster : Archibald Constable & Co., Ltd., 1903), pages 346-349. Olav Torkelsson, the last Catholic Bishop of Bergen, was summarized by one of his biographers as \\"a committed Catholic, a man of peace and a good administrator\\" [ en overbevist katolikk, fredselskende og en flink administrator. ] with a \\"well-developed financial acumen, and he collected lands with great style. As an administrator, he was talented but rough, and he tried to change the terms of land rent to the advantage of the bishop's chair\\" [ en velutviklet √∏konomisk sans, og han samlet jordegods i stor stil. Som administrator var han dyktig, men hardhendt, og han pr√∏vde √• endre vilk√•rene for jordleie til bispestolens fordel ]. But he still owed large sums of money to the German merchants of Bergen when he died. He was not thought to be an educated man but he was interested in history, especially when the subject was Norway.

Background 4Culture's offices are located in Seattle's historic Tashiro Kaplan building 4Culture evolved from the Office of Cultural Resources, a department of King County government, which housed King County's arts, heritage, preservation and public art office. In 2001, in reaction to the post-9/11 economic recession and subsequent elimination of its Current Expense (CX) funding, the Office of Cultural Resources staff proposed to the King County Executive and Council that they transition the office to a Public Development Authority (PDA). This structure would allow dedicated public funds to be stretched further through business innovations and allow access to other revenues, including grants and earned income through consulting services, that are traditionally beyond the reach of a government agency. The County Executive agreed and the County Council adopted an Ordinance approving the establishment of the Cultural Development Authority of King County in September 2002, effective January 1, 2003. Governance The work of 4Culture is accomplished by over 150 individuals each year. 4Culture is governed by a fifteen member Board of Directors, who are nominated by the King County Executive and confirmed by the King County Council.

Life The son of George Gayton of Little Britain, London, he was born there 30 November 1608. In 1623 he entered Merchant Taylors' School, and went to St John's College, Oxford, in 1625. He proceeded B.A. 30 April 1629, and M.A. 9 May 1633, and was elected fellow of his college. Gayton visited the wits in London, and claimed to be a \\"son of Ben\\", one of Ben Jonson's followers (the sons of Ben and tribe of Ben). In 1636 he was appointed superior beadle (bedel) in arts and physic in Oxford University, and was in the same year one of the actors in Love's Hospital, or the Hospital for Lovers, a dramatic entertainment provided by William Laud when the king and queen were his guests at St. John's College (30 August 1636). Gayton studied medicine and received a dispensation from the parliamentary delegates for the degree of bachelor of physic 1 February 1648. In 1648, however, the delegates expelled him from his beadleship. In London, Gayton became a professional writer. He composed verses for the pageant of Lord Mayor John Dethick, exhibited 29 October 1655, the first allowed since Oliver Cromwell was in power; when the performance took place Gayton was in a debtors' prison. On 22 September 1655 he was taken to the Wood Street counter, and in 1659 was moved to the King's Bench Prison. Later, in 1659, Gayton was in Suffolk. At the Restoration of 1660 he again became beadle at Oxford, and wrote many broadside verses. He died in his lodgings on Cat Street, Oxford, 12 December 1666, and was buried in St Mary's Church. Seven days before his death he had published his Glorious and Living Cinque Ports. When convocation proceeded three days after his death to elect a new beadle, Gayton was denounced by the vice-chancellor, John Fell, as \\"an ill husband and so improvident that he had but one farthing in his pocket when he died\\". Works His contemporaries had a low opinion of Gayton as an author. His major work was Pleasant Notes upon Don Quixot (London, 1654), in the headlines of the pages called \\"Festivous Notes\\". It is a gossipy and anecdotal commentary in four books, in prose and verse, with quotations, social asides, and references to the theatre. There is prefatory verse by John Speed, Anthony Hodges, and others. An expurgated, corrected, and abbreviated edition appeared in 1768 as Festivous Notes on the History and Adventures of the Renowned Don Quixote; its editor, John Potter, described Gayton as \\"a man of sense, a scholar, and a wit\\". Gayton's other works were: * Chart√¶ Script√¶, or a new Game at Cards call'd Play by the Booke, printed in 1645; fantastic verse description of a pack of cards. * Charity Triumphant, or the Virgin Hero. Exhibited 29 Oct. 1655, being the Lord Mayor's Day, London, 1655, dedicated to Alderman John Dethick. * Hymnus de Febribus, London, 1655, dedicated to William, Marquess of Hertford, with commendatory verse by Francis Aston: an account in Latin elegiac verse of the symptoms and causes of fevers. * Will. Bagnall's Ghost, or the Merry Devil of Gadmunton in his Perambulation of the Prisons of London, London, 1655, in prose and verse. Against William Bagwell. * The Art of Longevity, or A Di√¶teticall Institution, London; printed for the author 1659, dedicated to Elizabeth, wife of John Rous of Henham Hall, Suffolk. Sir Robert Stapylton, E. Aldrich, Captain Francis Aston, and others prefix verses. The book is a verse description of the wholesomeness or otherwise of various foods. * Wit Revived, or a new excellent way of Divertisement digested into most ingenious Questions and Answers, London, 1660, under the pseudonym \\"Asdryasdust Tossoffacan\\". * Poem upon Mr. Jacob Bobard's Yewmen of the Guards to the Physic Garden to the tune of the Counter Scuffle, Oxford, 1662. * Diegerticon ad Britanniam, Oxford, 1662. * The Religion of a Physician, or Divine Meditations on the Grand and Lesser Festivals, London, 1663. * The Glorious and Living Cinque Ports of our fortunate Island twice happy in the Person of his Sacred Majestie (Oxford, 1666), poems in heroic verse addressed to naval leaders engaged in the Four Days' Battle of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, June 1666. * Poem written from Oxon. to Mr. Rob. Whitehall at the Wells at Astrop, Oxford, 1666. An answer prepared by Robert Whitehall was not printed. Gayton also edited Harry Martens Familiar Letters to his Lady of Delight, Oxford, 1663. He was the author of a parodic sermon, put in the mouth of the chaplain of John Hewson, on how to wax boots: Walk, Knaves, Walk; a discourse intended to have been spoken at Court. ‚Ä¶ By Hodge Turberville, chaplain to the late lord Hewson, London.

He previously played in MLB for the San Francisco Giants, Milwaukee Brewers, Baltimore Orioles, and Kansas City Royals. Susac played college baseball at Oregon State University. Career=Amateur= Susac attended Jesuit High School in Carmichael, California, where he played for the school's baseball team as a catcher. He signed a letter of intent with Oregon State University to play college baseball for the Oregon State Beavers baseball team, but was also coveted by Major League Baseball (MLB) organizations. Baseball America rated Susac as the 40th-best available player in the upcoming 2009 MLB Draft. After Susac graduated from Jesuit, the Philadelphia Phillies selected Susac in the 16th round of the draft. Susac opted not to sign, instead enrolling at Oregon State. In 2010, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Susac batting for the Richmond Flying Squirrels in 2013 =San Francisco Giants= Eligible for the 2011 MLB Draft, the San Francisco Giants selected Susac in the second round. Susac signed with the Giants, receiving a $1.1 million signing bonus. The Giants assigned Susac to the San Jose Giants of the Class A-Advanced California League in 2012 and the Richmond Flying Squirrels of the Class AA Eastern League in 2013. He hit .256 in Richmond with 12 home runs and 46 RBIs, earning an Eastern League All-Star selection, and was invited to the Arizona Fall League, where he adjusted his swing and improved to hit .360 with two home runs and 11 walks in 17 games. Susac was listed as MLB.com's #3 prospect in the Giants organization for 2014. Susac began the 2014 season with the Fresno Grizzlies of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL), where he batted .268 in 63 games through July 26. The Giants called Susac up to the major league club late on July 25, 2014, to replace backup catcher H√©ctor S√°nchez after S√°nchez showed concussion symptoms. Susac flew to San Francisco the next morning and played his first MLB game that evening vs. the Los Angeles Dodgers, grounding out to third base in a single at-bat against Clayton Kershaw who shut out the Giants that day. Susac got his first major league hit, a single, on July 30, 2014, and his first major-league home run (a two-run homer) at Wrigley Field against Chicago Cubs pitcher Edwin Jackson on August 20, 2014. However, Susac later played in the September 1 continuation of the Giants vs. Colorado Rockies game from May 22 (over three months earlier), which was suspended by rain, and due to MLB's record-keeping rules, May 22 is the date given for his official MLB debut. Susac also singled to left field and was later driven home by a double from Hunter Pence. Because the game was a continuation, May 22 is also the official date for Susac's first hit and first run scored, and with a swinging strikeout later in the same game his batting average was briefly .500. Susac finished the regular season with three home runs and 19 RBIs, batting .273 in 35 games played. Susac was the Giants' backup catcher behind Buster Posey during the 2014 postseason. He appeared in four games, batting 1-for-4 (.250) as the Giants won the 2014 World Series. In 2015, Susac was the only Giants prospect in Baseball America's top 100 list. However, he was set back in Spring Training with a tooth infection and wrist injury and subsequently started the season with the Sacramento River Cats of the PCL. Susac was called up to the Giants on April 18 when Jake Peavy went on the disabled list. On June 27, Susac hit a bases-loaded double that drove in three runs and helped the Giants come from behind to defeat the Colorado Rockies 7‚Äì5. In late June, Susac was named the Giants' regular catcher as the team dealt with outfield injuries that pushed Buster Posey to first base and Brandon Belt to left field. On July 18, Susac sprained his right thumb while sliding into third base and was placed on the 15-day disabled list.

History Copperopolis served originally as a stage station. It was halfway between White Sulphur Springs and Martinsdale. In 1866 copper veins were discovered in the area north of the Castle Mountains and started attracting attention as a mining center. The deepest shafts ran to 550 feet although much of the ore was recovered close to the grass roots. Hauling costs were extremely expensive until a railroad was built in Martinsdale in 1896. Copperopolis developed into a family town containing a general store, livery stable, blacksmith shop, barber shop, boarding house, restaurant, and bunkhouses. During the first nine months of operation a quarter of a million dollars was uncovered from the mines. In 1901 copper export prices were cut in half due to the depression in Germany. The mines were forced to close down in 1903 and the families moved away. A story goes that two men remained in town but hated each other. They even visited the town spring at different times to avoid each other. In 1915 attempts were made to homestead the land. All of the buildings have been torn down except for one cabin. The lumber was hauled away. What remains is a true ghost town.

W. Bain (born ) is known for intelligence work done behind the Iron Curtain in 1988 under the pseudonym \\"Orange\\". He is currently a dean at the International School of Project Management in New Delhi, India. Early life Bain was born in London. He lived Kingston upon Thames attending prep school at Highfield School (Liphook, Hampshire). He suffered from Dyslexia, and made slow progress in the educational system. In 1982 he moved to Spain, and took up Hispanic Studies in a small private college in Salamanca where he met up with friends of Golo Mann. Upon return to France he qualified for the Classe pr√©paratoire aux grandes √©coles. He accomplished his Kh√¢gne in the Lyce√© Jules Ferry. The same year he discovered a new archeological area at Les Baux-de-Provence. He accomplished his BA Humanities in the radical Paris Nanterre University. He completed M. Phil at the Geneva-based IUEE (Institute for European Studies), and later attended the doctoral seminars of Wlad Godzich in the University of Geneva. April 1988 The students of the IUEE (as above), sympathising with many of the faculty in exile, organised two study tours of the Soviet Union. The first one went to Kiev and Moscow, the second to Budapest and Prague. He attended both. The tour of the Ukraine gave him insight into the degree of hostility vis-√†-vis Moscow, and the signs of dissidence in the leadership of the Komsomol. In Moscow, a student from the highest school of politics and administration leaked the shape of the army: suicides and an organizational incapacity. Moving on to Budapest, the dissent was quite open, and Bain saw the opportunity of a break-apart of the Communist Block. In a meeting with the then dissident Professor G√©za Jeszenszky the option of letting East Germans out of Hungary was discussed as a means of bringing the Wall down. Bain also met with FIDESZ leaders, and learned that recently NGOs in Hungary were allowed to be financed internationally, an open door for the West to finance dissident organisations. He went to Prague to meet leaders of the democratic opposition, in an underground Caf√© called \\"U Kafku\\" and further discussed the plan of letting East Germans through Czechoslovakia into Hungary. He was followed in Prague by the police, and in a jest of defiance took them on a 14 kilometre walk around Prague. On his return to the Europa Hotel, the receptionist called him into the lift and explained that the police had been through his belongings. He had to leave. Bain escaped from Prague due to an InterRail pass, he was able to get into a train without buying a ticket (he would have been noticed at the ticket counter). On the train, stooges noticed him but it was too late; the train had already crossed the border into Germany. In Munich, he was hidden by a friend for 5 days, while the German television showed pictures of him as accused of common crimes of murder in Czechoslovakia. He escaped from Munich thanks to former Hungarian exiles, in a freight compartment, then from Zurich to Geneva in a toilet compartment. On arriving in Geneva he went to the house of Professor Dusan Sidjanski. Here he discussed all the plans of the dissidence to bring down the Wall, and subsequently hid for a month in a flat in neighbouring France, in Annemasse. His research report signed with the pseudonym \\"Orange\\" was shared with Emile Noel, Secretary General of the European Commission. It was also shared with the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), as well as the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It is said to be one of the key documents that alerted the West of changes in the East, and triggered of a change in their foreign policy towards the East and Central Europe just a year and a half before the Wall falling. Pro-European militancy In the summer of 1991, Bain led a group of young European enthusiasts from different European Union (EU) Member States during a 2-day meeting in Romainm√¥tier, Switzerland on the theme \\"An EU Constitution\\". The same year he initiated a process in the Budapest University of Economic Sciences (Currently Corvinus University of Budapest) that led to the attribution of a Doctorate Honoris Causa (see Honorary degree) to the President of the EU Commission Jacques Delors (attributed in 1994). He is a member of the UK European Movement and the French Mouvement Europ√©en. He has taken part in the UK Liberal Democrats Brussels Chapter, and has been a close friend of UK Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg during his European years. In 1993, as shadow director projects for Fidesz, in the Hungarian Ministry of Interior, he revised the firstly refused Hungarian application for the EU. His draft was approved by both the EU Parliament and the EU Commission, paving the way for an accession to the EU for Hungary in the first round of enlargement of the EU. At the same time, Bain has been a public opinion maker in Hungary, with a series of articles published in the Budapest Sun,\\"Moment of Transition Calls for Party Changes\\", The Budapest Post, 22‚Äì28 October 1992\\"A Commission for Partnership\\", The Budapest Post, 5‚Äì11 November 1992\\"Yeltsin's Visit Signals New Era\\", The Budapest Post, 26 November ‚Äì 2 December 1992 and the Budapest Week.\\"Dissolving the legacy of Trianon\\", Budapest Week, 5‚Äì11 August 1993\\"Considering a Socialist government\\", Budapest Week, 17‚Äì23 March 1994 He has held several postings with the European Commission, including as a diplomat in New Delhi, India. Alternative activism Bain's alternative action started after seeing the film \\"Gandhi\\" in Madrid at the age of 18. He had a Basque companion, and befriended the Basque cause. In the early eighties he took part in the Aberri Eguna nationalist demonstrations, in despite of serious deterrence by the Spanish Guardia Civil. His basque friends used to call him \\"la naranja\\" (because of his orange hair), from which his nickname emerged. He subsequently went to Kreuzberg, Berlin, the heart of alternative Germany. This is where he got a first sight of the Wall, and a first taste for the underground exchanges between the East and the West. Bain was militant in the French Lyc√©e system, and as d√©l√©gu√© sat on two school boards (Conseils d'√©tablissement). In 1988, Bain took the French Ministry of Education to court for discrimination on the ground of nationality after his refusal to take the CAPES (secondary school teachers' exam). He won his case in 1992 under European law,Arr√™t Tribunal de Paris 1 1992 opening the secondary school exams to foreign European nationals in France and several other countries of the EU. In 1991, out of idealism, he set up the trainee's newsletter \\"Le Piston\\" (nepotism) in the European Commission, and denounced several scandals. For this, he was tortured by the French Direction de la surveillance du territoire (DST) for more than two hours. The \\"Piston\\", which lasted for 4 years, is considered by the grapevine in Brussels to be one of the elements that forced the European Commission to adopt a reform including contractual and financial control over all expenditures. In the same 1991 he left for Budapest where he founded the Rugby club the Budapest Exiles RFC Dyslexia As soon as 1988 he realised to potential of IT for the dyslexic, in particular the possibility of correcting himself before printing. In 1991‚Äì1992 he worked with Microsoft managers in Budapest to determine how to create grammar correctors in Microsoft Word. Bain established the relationship between a database structure of language rules (encoded), and the scientific structural linguistic approach developed in Nanterre University. The matter was taken up as a research project in Harvard University, and finally when it came to be in MS Word, the grammar corrector logic enabled Microsoft to also improve the spelling correctors. Scholarship Whilst in the last year of high school, Bain attended the post-graduate seminars of the literary critic Lucette Finasse in the \\"Coll√®ge International de Philosophie\\" in Paris. Later on he joined the group of young Spanish language scholars that surrounded Golo Mann in the later years of his life, and stayed regularly in Golo Mann's country residency in Berzona, Switzerland.

Force (December 25, 1876August 28, 1948) was an American art museum administrator and director.  Early life and education Force was born Julianna Reiser in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, on December 25, 1876. She became known as \\"Juliana\\". She was a twin and had seven other siblings besides her twin sister. Force's last name was spelled Reiser; she later changed the spelling to Rieser. Her father was a grocer and a hatter. The Rieser family moved to Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1886. As a child Force attended a Christian boarding school for girls. For a short time in 1908 Force taught at a secretarial business school in Manhattan, downtown New York City. At the age of 35 Force married Willard Force, a dentist, then becoming known as \\"Juliana Rieser Force\\" or \\"Juliana Reiser Force\\" or \\"Juliana R. Force\\", which is sometimes shortened to \\"Juliana Force\\". Career Force's first job was as the personal secretary of socialite Helen Hay (wife of Payne Whitney). At the age of 38 in 1914 she became the private secretary for Helen Hay's sister-in- law, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, a great-granddaughter of \\"Commodore\\" Cornelius Vanderbilt and eldest surviving daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt II. Whitney, an art sculptress and art collector, had inherited a Vanderbilt fortune. Whitney gave as Force's first duty an assignment to help organize art exhibitions at the Colony Club, an exclusive conservative social club for wealthy socialite women in New York City. Here Force showed off Whitney's art and a different kind of new unusual art by creative artists of a group called The Eight. Whitney was making a statement that all kinds of art, including different styles of art from new artists, should be represented to the public. Whitney was interested in displaying her collection of work as well as other art from modernist artists, especially living Americans. Whitney assigned Force in 1929 to contact the Metropolitan Museum of Art to prepare a plan for a gift of Whitney's collection. Whitney's art collection gift was to be displayed in a new wing, partly financed by her. The museum turned down the gift. Whitney then displayed her work in her own studios and galleries, that were under her name. Force managed these art enterprises and then in 1930 became director of the new Whitney Museum of American Art that developed from these art studio and gallery enterprises. Force was not trained as an art historian. She hired Lloyd Goodrich, an art historian, to be curator of the Whitney Museum of American Art, best known throughout the United States for displaying new kinds and unusual styles of modern art from living artists. Force's passion for new styles of art and her organizational traits made her an administrative director of the nationally known art museum notable for twentieth and twenty-first century art. =Folk art= Force initiated the first display of American folk art in a gallery in the United States, the \\"Early American Art\\" collection. On February 9, 1924 she began a presentation of folk art in a Whitney gallery that she administered, intending to bring folk art attractiveness closer to the level of contemporary art. Because of her passion for folk art, this initial display led to the first official public exhibition of folk art in a public showing presentation. Although her interactions with artists at the Whitney Studio Club inspired her to personally collect modern art, her collections of nineteenth-century and older folk art and decorative arts were larger and more significant. Her Eighth Street apartment was decorated in a Victorian style, contrary to contemporary tastes, and her home at Barley Sheaf Farm in Doylestown was filled with her folk art collection. Primarily acquired from rural antique dealers, her collection included portraits by early American limners, theorem paintings on velvet, and eclectic objects like cigar store Indians and toys. Later life Force became chair of the American Art Research Council in 1942. The United States government did a national tour show of German art in 1946 of war booty. Force shortly thereafter undertook a course of action to return the art to its rightful owner. The Whitney Museum of American Art directed by Force did art shows between 1946 and 1948 on Albert Pinkham Ryder, Robert Feke and Winslow Homer to promote public awareness of these artists. Death Force died in New York City on August 28, 1948, and buried at the Doylestown Cemetery in Pennsylvania. The museum held a memorial exhibition in her honor in 1949. Personal life Juliana Reiser married Willard Force in 1911. Her husband died in 1928, and they had no children.

When the company returned to Palestine, it produced The Good Soldier Schweik (1935), one of its most successful offerings. In 1961, Ohel staged a comedy by Ephraim Kishon, Ha-Ketubbah (\\"The Marriage Contract\\"), which played for three seasons.

Orbitel is present in more than 20 states of the United States and Canada (through its subsidiary Cinco Telecom Corp. ), and in Spain (under the name of Orbitel Comunicaciones Latinoamericanas S.A.U.). Orbitel provides a large array of services to serve the needs of Latin Americans abroad such as prepaid services, long distance plans, virtual numbers, international top-ups and carrier class traffic termination services. History Around the mid 1990s, the Colombian telecommunications industry was liberalized,https://www.dnp.gov.co/Portals/0/archivos/documentos/DEE/Archivos_Economia/262.pdf which was followed by the entrance of several independent telecommunications providers. In 1998, a group of investors (led by Santo Domingo and Sarmiento Angulo) joined UPM to incorporate Orbitel, company born to provide long- distance telecommunications services inside Colombia and worldwide. In 2006, Orbitel bids and wins the right to a governmental license to operate the promising WiMAX technology, starting to provide its service that same year in the city of Cali. In the context of the increased rivalry in the Colombian telecommunications industry (due to the entry of Movistar M√≥viles Colombia, Claro and Am√©rica M√≥vil), EPM spins off its telecommunications business in an independent new venture. To achieve a more competitive position in the long distance market and to make good use of the newly gained WiMAX license of Orbitel, EPM buys the 50% of the company that still rests in the hands of the Santo Domingo's and Sarmiento Angulo's holdings. The following year, the 1st of August 2007, EPM Telecomunicaciones, Orbitel and Emelco's telecommunications business merge into a single company under the umbrella of the brand UNE. From the very beginning of its history, UNE tries to blend together the different brands that made up the group. Already in 2007, UNE tries to homogenize the logos and the culture of all of its brands under the slogan: ‚Äúuna marca UNE‚Äù. That same year, UNE takes over the Colombian business from Orbitel, which leaves Orbitel as an international services provider for the Latin Americans abroad in the United States and Spain. International Presence In the United States and Canada. Orbitel incorporates its subsidiary in USA in the year 2000, opening its first corporate venue in Miami, closely followed by the opening of the New York office. The American subsidiary also offers its services to Orbitel's clients in Canada. Orbitel's flagship product, ‚Äúthe Colombia Card‚Äù, has become the most frequently used card among Colombians in the United States. In Spain. Orbitel starts providing service to Latin Americans in Spain in the year 2004 through its pre-paid card ‚ÄúOrbitel Latina‚Äù. Currently, Orbitel operates in Spain through a mobile virtual network thanks to the agreement reached with Vodafone in 2009, which grants Orbitel access to Vizzavi's infrastructures in Spain.

Family and early life  Garstang was born in Southport, England in September 1925 to Percy Brocklehurst and Eunice (Gledhill) Garstang. He attended Cambridge University on a Caius College scholarship. Due to the war, he completed three years of course work in two years, ultimately receiving his B.A. in 1946. He spent 1945 to 1946 as scientific officer at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, England and 1946 to 1948 as scientific officer at the Ministry of Works. Returning to Cambridge, he pursued his studies in mathematics receiving an M.A. in 1950 and his Ph.D. in 1954, under the supervision of D.R. Hartree. His thesis examined atomic transitions in astrophysics. He also received a Sc.D. from Cambridge in Physics and Chemistry in 1983.  Early work  Garstang started working at the Yerkes Observatory while he was still enrolled in the Ph.D. program at Cambridge. During that time, he began to calculate atomic structures and transition probabilities for forbidden transitions, which was of special interest to astrophysicists. Upon the completion of his Ph.D., he started teaching at the University of London and served as the assistant director for the London Observatory. He also edited The Observatory magazine from 1953 through 1960. In 1964, Garstang headed to Boulder, Colorado to join the faculty at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Soon after arriving, he was appointed Chairman of the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics. He also served as the Director of the Division of Physics and Astro-Geophysics from 1979 to 1980 and the acting Director of the Fiske Planetarium from 1980 to 1981. During his career, he published over 50 papers, including calculations on neutral technetium and line strengths for ionized neon. He also calculated the energy levels and spectra of highly ionized species of iron, and spent time studying the effects of strong magnetic field on atomic spectra, ranging from the thousand gauss fields of sunspots to megagauss fields of white dwarfs.  Late career  Later in his career, Garstang began to work on light pollution. Between 1984 and 2007, he published 40 scientific papers concerning the phenomenon, and constructed a light pollution model which included an ozone layer, scattering of light by molecules and aerosols with improved variations with altitude, curvature of the earth, and a dust layer of dust either volcanic or desert origin. The models he created have since become standard in the field, and led to efforts to reduce light pollution in urban areas.

On its 10th anniversary the club's namesake festival presented what it calls the Nublu Sound, a combination of jazz, African, South American, Caribbean, electronic, and dance music. Among the bands associated with Nublu are The Brazilian Girls, Forro in the Dark, Love Trio, and Wax Poetic. Associates who perform there include Butch Morris, John Zorn, Sun Ra Arkestra, David Byrne, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Norah Jones, and Bebel Gilberto. Nublu currently has two locations, Nublu 151 located at 151 Ave C, and Nublu Classic located at 62 Ave C, as well as a Record Label \\"Nublu Records\\" History Ersahin had been developing festival programming from New York since moving there from Sweden when he was 20 years old, in addition to packaging performance for festivals in Turkey, his father's homeland. Before opening Nublu, Ersahin had worked for a decade at the Sweet Basil Jazz Club. The musicians he performed with became part of the Nublu collective. Nublu Club grew out of parties he was throwing at venues in Manhattan where friends performed. He came up with the term \\"Nublu\\" to convey his eclectic aesthetic. The club has a nondescript exterior with a concrete ramp to a blank door. The layout of the club was designed to ensure that music was central to the patrons' experience by placing the performers on floor level in the middle of the long club, as opposed to being up on a stage at one end. When the club briefly lost its license, it closed for one year from 2011‚Äì2012, during which Nublu events such as Butch Morris and the Nublu Orchestra were held downstairs at Lucky Cheng's on 1st Avenue. Nublu reopened with a new beer and wine license in 2012 at a new location further north on Ave C. The club's return featured one of the Nublu's touchstones, the Sun Ra Arkestra led by Marshall Allen. Nublu bands and label The house band was Love Trio, the group Ersahin put together in 2002 with Jesse Murphy and drummer Kenny Wollesen who had worked with him at his Saturday brunch jams at Sweet Basil's in the West Village. Another band at the heart of the Nublu experience in the early days was Wax Poetic, an improvising collective. Their first performances took place at Save the Robots on Avenue B. The recordings featured spoken word from poet Saul Williams. Its first vocalists include Norah Jones, Bebel Gilberto, and Sabina of the Brazilian Girls. Other Ersahin ensembles that refined their sound at the Nublu club are Wonderland and Our Theory. A key member of the scene was Butch Morris, the creator of Conduction, who led the Nublu Orchestra from the opening of the club until his death in 2013.

Although short, it leads to Lateral Shaft, a direct descent into Gaping Gill Main Chamber which is a popular caving route, and has had considerable significance in the history of the exploration of Gaping Gill. It lies within the designated Ingleborough Site of Special Scientific Interest. Description A short wriggle between the shakehole wall and a large boulder leads into the roomy passage. After this abruptly drops to the floor of the Main Chamber. Although a direct descent is possible, a considerable waterfall enters from Spout Tunnel below the lip, so the modern route, known as Dihedral, deviates away from this to land on a ledge some down. The route then leaves the shaft to drop down the rift above the Main Chamber, before emerging through the roof and dropping the final to the floor. Spout Tunnel can be entered by swinging in from a rope or ladder. The passage becomes narrow, and after the main water enters down a pitch. Above this a further climb enters of passage which gets too small close to a sink in Fell Beck opposite Rat Hole Sink. Below the pitch a small passage continues for another , and is thought to drain the area just to the east of the blind valley. History Professor McKenny Hughes reported that the entrance was blocked with glacial fill until a flood in 1872, when it got washed out. He wriggled round the large boulder and reached the shaft which he estimated as being in excess of deep. In 1895 Edward Calvert, of the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club, attempted to replicate Edouard Martel's descent of the Main Shaft of a few weeks earlier, but failed to get beyond Birkbeck's Ledge at because of the quantity of water. Looking up, he could see that the shaft divided behind a curtain. Later in the year he entered Jib Tunnel, and realised that this was the parallel shaft that he had seen, and that a man could be lowered directly to the floor of the Main Chamber from its lip. The following year, he set up a series of jibs and pulleys, and was lowered in a boatswain's chair, becoming the second person to reach the Main Chamber. Jib Tunnel was used for explorations of the system until 1921, when the current system of lowering the winch from a gantry positioned across the corner of the Main Shaft was developed. There have been three deaths in the cave. In 1982 Ted Holstead died after losing control when abseiling down the shaft. In 1989 Keith Mann died of exposure whilst prusiking up the shaft on rope. In 1995 eleven-year-old Lee Craddock wandered into Jib Tunnel and fell down the shaft to his death whilst on an outing organised by the Scouting Association.

The Novice (\\"Mtsyri\\", –ú—Ü—ã—Ä–∏ in Russian, distortion of Georgian ·Éõ·É¨·Éò·É†·Éò /mts'iri/) is a poem by Mikhail Lermontov written in 1839 and first published in 1840, hailed as \\"one of the last examples of the classic Russian romantic poetry,\\" according to the Lermontov Encyclopedia. Background Some Russian scholars (like S. Durylin) consider three poems ‚Äì \\"The Confession\\", Boyarin Orsha and Mtsyry as three different execution of one original idea. In 1831 15-year-old Lermontov wrote in his diary: \\"To write the tale of a young 17-year old monk who's lived in a monastery from childhood. Read nothing but the sacred books. The passionate soul, he feels imprisoned...\\" The poem's central episode, Mtsyri's fight with a wild cat was apparently based on the traditional Georgian folklore; there are 14 versions of the old Georgian song \\"Young Man and a Tiger\\", one of which (the Khevsur song) has been used by Shota Rustaveli in his epic poem The Knight in the Panther's Skin. Citing the poet's relatives Akim Shan-Girey and Akim Khastatov, biographer Pavel Viskovatov suggested the following version of the poem's background: > While travelling along the old Georgian Military Road and collecting the > local tales and legends (which later have been incorporated into the new > version of the Demon poem), Lermontov in Mtskheta came across an old Beri, a > Georgian monk, a guardian and the last surviving member of the local > monastery that had been closed earlier. Lermontov had a conversation with > him and learned that he was a highlander imprisoned by General Yermolov > during the latter's Caucasian campaign. The boy fell ill and the general > left him for local monks to take care for. Here he grew up but couldn't get > used to his new home and made several attempts to escape. One such attempt > proved to be all but fatal: he fell severely ill, nearly died and after that > apparently submitted to his fate and even became friends with an elderly > Georgian monk. This emotional tale impressed Lermontov. He used parts of his > earlier poems, \\"The Confession\\" and Boyarin Orsha, merged them into one, > added new details and took the story from Spain and (in case of Orsha) > Lithuania to Georgia, making the best of this chance to extol the free and > daring spirit of Caucasian highlanders he admired, and to praise the beauty > of the Caucasian mountains that he loved.Russkaya Starina, 1887, No.10, > Pp.125‚Äì125 Some scholars (I.Andronnikov, A.Lyubovich) later questioned the reliability of such version, others pointed out that taking away native Caucasian people's children was common practice for the Russian officers, and painter P.Z. Zakharov, an ethnic Chechen, has been brought to Tiflis personally by General Yermolov. Lermontov might have been aware of Zakharov's life drama, noted biographer L.N.Nazarova. History The exact date of the poem's completion, according to the autograph, was August 5, 1839. According to the same manuscript, Mtsyri was called originally Beri (A Monk, in Georgian) and featured an epigraph (\\"On n'a qu'une seule patria\\", There is only one fatherland) which later had been crossed out by the author. It was this hand- written document that allowed researchers decades later to return into the poem two fragments cut out by censors. Those were the two lines from Verse 8 (\\"...To learn if it if for freedom or for prison that we are born into this world\\") and seven lines from the penultimate Verse 25 (\\"...But what's in it for me?

They were straight tapered in plan, with a slightly forward swept leading edge and a quarter chord forward sweep of 6¬∞, built around a single spar with a forward, plywood skinned torsion box between it and the leading edge; behind the spar the wing was fabric covered. The tips carried the small sreamlined bodies known as salmons, common at the time. Its slotted ailerons, which filled about half the span and were divided into two pairs, were ply skinned but with an outer fabric covering. Spoilers, situated immediately inboard of the ailerons at about 40% chord, opened both above and below the wing. The IS-7 had an ovoid cross-section plywood monocoque fuselage. Its tandem two seat cockpit stretched from the extreme nose to behind the wing leading edge, enclosed by a long, two part perspex canopy following the lines of the fuselage. The longer forward part opened to the side and the short aft section to the rear. Behind the wing the fuselage tapered to the tail. The horizontal tail was straight tapered in plan with squared tips, raised a little above the fuselage on a fin fillet and constructed in the same way as the ailerons. There were gaps at both ends of the elevators, between the fin at the root and between a rearwards tailplane extension at the tip. The elevators carried trim tabs. The ply-skinned fin and fabric, unbalanced rudder were straight edged, the latter reaching down to the keel. The IS-7 had a short, rubber sprung skid under the cockpit and a fixed, unsprung monowheel under the wing, fitted with a brake. There was also a small tail skid. The IS-7 was classed as semi-aerobatic. Development of it ceased when it was decided that the IIL IS-8, another Silimon designed two seater but with a smaller span, would be operationally simpler and more economical to run.

History  Basketball Club Sparta Praha (short: BC Sparta Praha) is a Czech men's basketball club from Prague founded in 1939 as a section of omnisport club Sparta Prague. Since that time it has been a long-term member of the basketball elite. This is confirmed by its results both in the First League and the participation of its players in the national team. During the course of its history, BC Sparta Praha has been headed by as few as four representatives. The first chairman was V√°clav Je≈ô√°bek (1939‚Äì52), the second Josef Ezr (1952‚Äì90, a full 38 years!), the third Miloslav K≈ô√≠≈æ (1990‚Äì93) and the fourth Pavel Majerik (1993‚Äì2005).

Synopsis  The Butterfly Spring on the slopes of the Cang Mountain range The film opens with Ah Peng (Mo Zijiang), an ethnic Bai, on his way to a festival in Dali City, Yunnan. Along the way he meets Jinhua (played by the sixteen- year-old Yang Likun) who needs help to fix her wagon. Ah Peng helps her and later goes on to win the horse race at the festival. Impressed with his skill and kindness Jinhua falls in love with him. Ah Peng and Jinhua agree to meet one year thence, but when Ah Peng returns he cannot find her. He and his companions search for Jinhua (which is a common Chinese name for both sexes), and come across four other women named Jinhua ‚Äî a steelworker, a tractor driver, a herder and a fertilizer maker ‚Äî before he eventually finds his love, who works as a commune director. After some initial confusion, the two get married and there is a final chorus under the Butterfly Spring.  Modern Interpretation  Five Golden Flowers is a canonical example of films produced by state-run production companies in China during the 1950s and 60s depicting ethnic minorities in society. The Bai minority featured in Five Golden Flowers is shown to wear colourful costumes, engage in festive song and dance, and in romance, yet they are fully committed to socialist construction. The filmmakers took care to use folk songs from the region and hire a Yunnanese leading lady. The film is of particular interest because the portrayal of ethnic minorities allowed filmmakers to probe areas deemed too sensitive by the Chinese government.

Layshafts are best known through their use in car gearboxes, where they were a ubiquitous part of the rear-wheel drive layout. With the shift to front-wheel drive, the use of layshafts is now rarer. The driving shaft carries the input power into the gearbox. The driven shaft is the output shaft from the gearbox. In car gearboxes with layshafts, these two shafts emerge from opposite ends of the gearbox, which is convenient for RWD cars but may be a disadvantage for other layouts. For gearboxes in general, gear clusters mounted on a layshaft may either turn freely on a fixed shaft, or may be part of a shaft that then rotates in bearings. There may be multiple separate clusters on a shared shaft and these are allowed to turn freely relative to each other.  Origins  The term layshaft originates with watermill machinery. The layshaft is the gear- carrying shaft that links the wallower (the small spur gear driven at increased speed by the waterwheel) to any upright shafts that carry the millstones. The term, layshaft, was also used by millwrights, in both wind- and watermills, to refer to a shaft that drove secondary machinery such as sack hoists, rather than the main milling machinery. The term layshaft was also applied to back-geared lathes. These were lathes with a slow-speed mechanism in addition to their usual belt drive. This used two gears on a layshaft behind the headstock, giving a double reduction gear.  Car manual transmissions  In the typical manual gearbox for a RWD car, the driving shaft (input) is in-line with the driven shaft (output), but not permanently connected to it. A reduction gear on the driving shaft drives the layshaft. In car transmissions, the term countershaft is also used. A number of gears on the layshaft may then be connected, one at a time, to the driven shaft. Selecting each of these gears in turn gives the various ratios of the gearbox. All of these gear ratios are reduction gears, the engine speed being higher than the input speed to the final drive of the rear axle. Early gearboxes used sliding gears to engage and disengage the drive. These were difficult to operate and also wore on the main working surfaces of the gears. An early improvement was to use separate dog clutches instead to engage gears, leaving the gears themselves in 'constant mesh'. A later, and more gradual development, was the introduction of synchromesh. This is an all-metal friction clutch in addition to the positive dog clutch, that gradually engages the gears and matches their speed before the dog clutch engages. The top gear of the gearbox is achieved without these gears, but by coupling the driven shaft directly to the driving shaft through another dog clutch. This gives a 'direct drive' top gear, which has advantages for both efficiency and quietness at cruising speed. A typical gearbox had 2% losses in each gear set, so 4% for intermediate ranges through their two gears, but approaching 0% for the direct-drive top gear. As the direct top gear is not transmitting torque through the gears, it is also quieter. In theory, it is also possible to provide an overdrive top gear, another indirect gear, but of a speed-up ratio rather than the reduction ratio of the other gears. The direct-drive ratio then becomes the second-to-top or third gear. This arrangement was used on some early cars, but was uncommon. Where overdrive is provided for a RWD car, this is almost always done by adding a separate overdrive gearbox to the output driven shaft of the gearbox, usually outside the gear casing. Because of the layout of the gearbox, the layshaft is normally mounted low-down in the gearbox casing below the other shafts. The gear lever enters through the top of the casing and so it is more convenient for the sliding components of the dog clutches to be mounted on the driven shaft, rather than the layshaft. The layshaft gear cluster is thus often a simple one-piece component, typically cast iron gears running in bearings on a fixed steel shaft. The bearings may be plain phosphor bronze bushes, or for high-load applications needle rollers. Where large numbers of gear ratios, six or more, are to be provided then these will require a third or more gear clusters on the layshaft. To maintain the proportions of the overall gearbox as more compact, rather than becoming long and thin, these gearboxes may use twin layshafts. This requires an additional driven gear for each layshaft, but the mechanism is otherwise very similar. The use of multiple layshafts also developed into the multiple clutch gearbox, used for some buses, where each ratio has its own layshaft and separate plate or hydraulic clutches, rather than dog clutches, are used to select between them. Where a power take-off is required, usually for industrial vehicles to drive winches, hydraulic pumps etc., this is often driven from one end of the layshaft, as this is more accessible shaft than the main shafts, already in use by the drivetrain. = 'All-indirect' gearboxes = Early, pre-1911, all- indirect gearbox Some gearboxes do not use a layshaft, but rely on indirect gears throughout. All-indirect were used for some very early cars, before the advantages of the direct-drive top gear were recognised. They contain no dog clutches; at the time, gear changing was still carried out by sliding the gears in and out of mesh. Once the dog clutch came into use, the further advantage of a direct-drive top gear was immediately recognised. FWD all- indirect manual gearbox, with final drive taken from the second shaft With the popularity of front-wheel drive from the 1960s, the all-indirect gearbox has become common. These have been used for both transverse engine layouts, where the offset of two shafts is more convenient than the in-line arrangement of a layshaft gearbox, and for longitudinal transaxle designs, such as the VW Beetle or many Renaults, where the requirement was to have both driven and driving shafts at the same end of the gearbox. Although the loss of the direct-drive top ratio loses the ability for 0% losses when cruising, this is compensated for by reducing losses in other ratios from 4% to 2%. Noise is also reduced by modern metallurgy and gear cutting, which give quieter and more efficient gear profiles. As the gearbox efficiency remains constant for all ratios of an all-indirect gearbox, it is now convenient to provide overdrive top gears, even when these are no longer direct-drive or 1:1 ratios. One of the first mass-market cars to offer such a feature was the VW Polo and the Formel E, with a deliberately-labelled '-E' for 'economy' overdrive ratio.
