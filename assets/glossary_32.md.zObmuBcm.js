The original company was founded in 1978 as Zimmer Motorcars Corporation by Paul Zimmer. Art Zimmer purchased the rights to the company in 1997 and established the Art Zimmer Neo-Classic Motor Car Company (a.k.a. Zimmer Motorcars) which currently builds 10-20 automobiles and 10‚Äì20 fully custom 4-door dually Silverado trucks each year. History Zimmer Golden Spirit Zimmer Motorcars Corporation was established in 1978 as a manufacturer of neo-classic automobiles. The idea for this automobile was initially drawn on a napkin at a private dinner between Paul Zimmer, Chairman and President of Zimmer Corporation and Bob Zimmer, Paul Zimmer's son, employee and shareholder of the company. Paul Zimmer drew what was to become the Golden Spirit on a napkin, handed it to Bob Zimmer and told him that not only were we going to build a neo-classic automobile, but that the younger Zimmer would be responsible for all functions of the operation and ongoing supervision of Zimmer Motorcars Corporation. Bob Zimmer eventually became the company's President. At its peak in the 1980s, Zimmer Motorcars Corporation employed 175 people and generated $25 million in annual revenue. =Models= A Zimmer Quicksilver A wedding Zimmer limousine in Tallinn, Estonia The Zimmer Golden Spirit was the flagship of the Zimmer Motorcars Corporation with more than 1,500 produced during its production run from 1978 to 1988. The original Golden Spirit was built using a Ford Mustang chassis and drivetrain. The second Zimmer Motorcars Corporation offering was the mid- engined Pontiac Fiero-based Quicksilver which was built between 1984 and 1988. The Quicksilver is a two-seat personal luxury car designed by General Motors terminated designer Don \\"D.A.\\" Johnson. Each Quicksilver was constructed from a complete Fiero donor car, which was dismantled at the Zimmer factory in order to lengthen the chassis by 16\\". The Fiero bodywork was replaced by a new fiberglass body with styling similar to the Lincoln Mark series but with a sloping nose and pop-up hidden headlamps. The interior was trimmed in leather and wood, and the new body had increased luggage space in the front. The retail price of the Quicksilver was $52,000. Both models were built in the same factory in Pompano Beach, Florida, on simultaneous production lines between the years 1979 to 1988. Ford supplied new Mustangs, which were then modified by stretching the frame for a longer wheelbase and modifying the bodywork etc. The Mustang VIN was retained as it met all the required US safety features at the time. =Original company failures= In 1988, Bob Zimmer sold his shares in the company and purchased an automobile dealership. Shortly after that, Paul Zimmer suffered a major heart attack and became less involved. At that time a group of employees and members of the Board of Directors attempted to direct the operation of the company and were not able to navigate such a large entity during a difficult economy and the loss of the company's most important and influential member. Zimmer Corporation fell into serious economic distress and the $325 million a year parent company was forced into bankruptcy, taking down with it all of its operating divisions, including the highly successful and profitable $25 million a year car company. =Company acquired= Zimmer Showroom in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia In September 1996, Art Zimmer (who is no relation to the original Zimmer family) became aware that an automobile had been manufactured which shared his surname. Shortly thereafter, he acquired the \\"Zimmer Motorcars\\" name and various Zimmer Motorcars Corporation materials and established the Zimmer Motor Car Club for Zimmer car owners. By 2001, there were over 500 members in the club. In 1997, Art Zimmer, president and CEO, started the Art Zimmer Neo-Classic Motor Car Company after buying a model in a local automobile dealership. The company, also known as Zimmer Motor Car Company, currently builds 10 to 20 automobiles each year and is headquartered in Jamesville, New York. =Retro style - modern chassis= The current Zimmer Golden Spirit retails for $175,900 and is billed by the company as \\"the most awesome automobile in the world.\\" It is the first four-door convertible produced in decades and is based on a Lincoln Town Car chassis. The company also offers a two-door model that is built on a Ford Mustang chassis which retails for $109,900. The advantage to owners is that the automobile can be serviced at any Ford or Lincoln Mercury dealer. This includes full service and Ford parts and warranty work. Additionally, the automobile has all the latest safety and modern engineering features available. Because Zimmers are built atop existing chassis, the company can use the legal certification of the Town Car and Mustang, obviating the need for separate crash and emissions certification by Zimmer. =Manufacturing facilities= Art Zimmer established the company's manufacturing facilities in Cambridge, Maryland, and in December 1998 the first Zimmer Golden Spirit produced by the newly formed Zimmer Motorcars rolled out of the factory. During 2000, the company established a Syracuse presence when two of its operations, Rosenthal and Chadwick, a metal fabricating company, won the contract to supply heavy-duty steel bumpers, badge bars, and associated support parts. For the first time since 1934, when Franklin Automobile Company closed, automotive manufacturing returned to Syracuse. In May 2000, Zimmer and Sam Vigliotti, president of Sam's Auto Body and Service Center on West Genesee Street, located in Syracuse's historic Automobile Row, announced that the latest Zimmer model, currently in development, would be manufactured at Sam's Auto Body. Because of this alliance, by 2001, the company was able to manufacture a new vehicle every six to eight weeks. =Distribution network= Zimmers are manufactured \\"on order\\" and sold through an international distribution network. There are distribution centers in several states in the United States, as well as throughout the world such as Saudi Arabia.

Founded in 1970 by the members of a food-buying club, the co-op is owned by over 3000 member owners and is a member of the National Cooperative Grocers Association and the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives.  Governance and management =Board of Directors= The Board of Directors at People's consists of 5-9 members elected by the membership of the co-op. The Board uses a modified version of consensus decision-making to reach its decisions. In 2006, the Board adopted Policy Governance as its governance model. =Collective management= People's is managed by a non-hierarchical collective. As of 2007, there are 27 co- managers. Collective meetings are held once a month where co-managers make decisions regarding the co-op's operations. Like the Board, the collective uses a modified version of consensus decision-making. 26 out of the 27 co- managers have to agree on given proposals. The collective is divided into semi-autonomous ‚Äúteams‚Äù which are responsible for reporting and heading up their various departments. The collective is accountable to the membership via the Board.  Expansion  In 2002, People's embarked upon an expansion project to increase its retail space. People's secured loans from its membership and Shorebank Pacific to finance the $900,000 expansion project. The expansion doubled the store's retail space and included an expanded Community Room as well as an elevator for wheelchair access. The co-op's efforts won them a BEST (Businesses for an Environmentally Sustainable Tomorrow) award from the City of Portland‚Äôs Office of Sustainable Development in 2003 for energy efficiency. Building features The building which People's occupies incorporates a number of environmentally friendly technologies. All of the wood used for the expansion was either salvaged or FSC certified. The building's natural ventilation was improved by use of a solar chimney. =Green roofs= One of People's Green Roofs People's added two green roofs to its building during its expansion. Drought-tolerant plant species were chosen for the green roofs. Due to the stormwater management benefits, People's received a $2,500 grant from the Community Watershed Stewardship Program. =Cob= Cob, a mixture of earth, sand and straw, was used as infill for two walls of the building as well as for benches inside and outside of the store. People's was the first commercially zoned building in North America to build with cob wall infill. =Geothermal= The co-op is heated and cooled by use of a geothermal exchange heat pump which includes a series of tubes coursing water through the store's floor. This system, in conjunction with other design strategies, has reduced the heating and cooling energy consumption at the co-op by approximately 40%.  People's farmers' market  People's hosts a year round farmers market in its courtyard on Wednesday afternoons. In the summer months, there are typically 15-20 vendors offering a variety of locally grown and produced goods. Philosophy and buying guidelines People's has adopted a model of ethical consumerism and adheres to strict guidelines for the products that are retailed as well as its practices. By vote of the membership, the co-op does not carry any products containing meat with the exception of pet food. The Board of Directors has approved product selection guidelines which prohibit products containing artificial colors, flavoring, or preservatives. The guidelines also allow for the exclusion of products from companies that test on animals or operate in contradiction to the co-op's mission. People's composts all of its vegetable waste off site at the 47th Avenue Farm in Portland via an industrial vermicomposting bin. People's maintains connections to the cooperative movement via its membership in regional and national cooperative federations. People's is currently a member of the National Cooperative Grocers Association, the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives, and the Portland Alliance of Worker Cooperatives. People's community room People's has a meeting space on site used for public and private events. Free yoga classes for members are held in the room. The room is also used for capoeira and t'ai chi, as well as for meetings of both the membership and Board of Directors. A lift was built during the expansion to ensure accessibility to the space. IS4C In 2006, People's began using IS4C, a Point of Sale (PoS) System. The program was developed by Tak Tang of the Wedge Community Co-op in Minneapolis, Minnesota. IS4C People's ported the IS4C software to the Linux platform, making it the only open-source software made specifically for food cooperatives.

The service is provided by two motorised pontoons and operates between border posts at Kazungula, Zambia and Kazungula, Botswana.Camerapix: \\"Spectrum Guide to Zambia.\\" Camerapix International Publishing, Nairobi, 1996. It links the Livingstone-Sesheke road (which connects to the Trans‚ÄìCaprivi Highway at Katima Mulilo and forms part of the Walvis Bay Corridor) to the main north-south highway of Botswana through Francistown and Gaborone to South Africa, and also to the Kasane-Victoria Falls road through Zimbabwe. It serves the international road traffic of three countries directly (Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana) and of three more indirectly (Namibia, South Africa and DR Congo).Terracarta/International Travel Maps, Vancouver Canada: \\"Zambia, 2nd edition\\", 2000. Whether Botswana and Zambia actually shared a common border, or whether the ferry was illegally crossing into Namibian or Rhodesian territory, was the subject of dispute. In 1970, South Africa (which at the time occupied Namibia) informed Botswana that there was no common border between Botswana and Zambia, claiming that a quadripoint existed. As a result, South Africa claimed, the Kazungula Ferry, which links Botswana and Zambia at the quadripoint, was illegal. Botswana firmly rejected both claims. There was actually a confrontation and shots were fired at the ferry; some years later, the Rhodesian Army attacked and sank the ferry, maintaining that it was serving military purposes. In 2003 the ferry was the site of a disaster when a severely overloaded Zambian truck capsized one of the pontoons and 18 people drowned. The accident was blamed on the lack of weighbridges in Zambia to check the weight of trucks.Times of Zambia website \\"Stiffer law against overloading ready\\" 7 February 2007, accessed 1 March 2007. The bridge under construction, March 2019 In August 2007 the governments of Zambia and Botswana announced a deal to construct a bridge at the site to replace the ferry.\\"Zambia and Botswana reach Kazungula bridge deal.\\" Palapye News blog. Retrieved 12 November 2007. The existence of a short boundary of about between Zambia and Botswana was apparently agreed to during various meetings involving heads of state and/or officials from all four states in the 2006-10 period and is clearly shown in the African Development Fund project map, matching the US Department of State Office of the Geographer depiction in Google Earth. The planned route for the new bridge crosses this boundary without entering Zimbabwe or Namibia. Zimbabwe already has a bridge into Zambia at Victoria Falls, from Kazungula. Namibia already has a bridge into Zambia at Katima Mulilo about upriver. This proposed bridge will give a direct connection between Zambia and Botswana. But there is still no direct connection between Namibia and Zimbabwe, nor is one planned. Traffic from Namibia to Zimbabwe has to cross to Zambia at Katimo Mulilo, and then from Zambia into Zimbabwe at the Victoria Falls; or over this new bridge into Botswana, and thence into Zimbabwe at Pandamatenga. In practice, though, there is very little such traffic along this route, or demand. Most traffic between Namibia and Zimbabwe goes through Botswana via Maun, which is a considerably shorter route.

Harper & Brothers) Honey in the Horn is a 1935 debut novel by Harold L. Davis. The novel received the Harper Prize for best first novel of 1935 and won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1936. The title of the book is from a line in a square dancing tune, and is only found in the book in the author's introductory overleaf.  Synopsis  Honey in the Horn is a novel about life in the homesteading days of Oregon, 1906-1908. It is about the coming of age of an orphan boy named Clay Calvert, but it is also about the trials of the pioneers who came to Oregon following the American Dream. Through the characters that Clay meets along the way, the author introduces the readers to the various occupations of the settlers of that era. Plot summary In the opening section of the story, Clay Calvert is a hand on the sheep ranch of Preston Shiveley, his stepfather's father. Without really intending to, Clay helps his stepbrother, Wade Shiveley, escape from jail, and becomes a fugitive himself. He and a Tunne Indian boy flee into the wilderness where Clay joins up with a horse-trader who has a beautiful young daughter, Luce. In the second section of the story, Clay and Luce are married and living in the sparsely populated coastal regions. There they meet with a group of settlers who are planning a trip to eastern Oregon where they can put down stakes. On the trip east, they meet again with Wade Shiveley, who is accusing Clay of stealing his horse. Wade Shiveley is eventually hanged for a crime he did not commit, and Clay is free to move on. Shortly after, Luce falls ill and Clay goes for help. When he returns Luce is gone, apparently with her father. In the final section of the story, Clay decides not to pursue Luce, but follows the wheat harvest, and eventually ends up as a hand on a scow on the Columbia River. Clay goes back to the Eastern plains to harvest grass for hay where he once again meets the Tunne Indian boy. He later discovers the Indian boy dead and suspects that he was killed by Luce's father. He decides then to rejoin the settlers who had moved from the Coast and stays with them until a harsh winter drives them off of their homesteads. On the way back west Clay once again unites with Luce.  Characters  * Clay Calvert - a boy of 16 whose mother married Wade Shiveley, then died. Clay is then adopted by Wade's father, Uncle Preston. * Luce - a young girl who is living a gypsy life with her father, a horse trader, and stepmother. * Wade Shiveley - one of two sons of Preston Shiveley, who kills his own brother in a fight over a squaw and is put in jail. Clay's role in slipping Wade a gun sent from \\"Uncle Preston\\" is what sets off the action of the novel. * Luce's father - a horse trader and notorious gambler * Uncle Preston Shiveley - the eccentric father of Wade, sheep rancher, and toll-bridge owner who takes Clay in * Tunne Indian boy - who is also a ward of Uncle Preston and helps Clay escape in to the wilderness * Clark Burdon - a disfigured and retired gun for hire who was one of the leaders of the caravan west and took a liking to Clay and Luce * Captain Waller - who owned a scow that ferried cordwood up and down the Columbia River  References  *Honey in the Horn, New York, Harper & Brothers, 1935, Category:1935 American novels Category:Pulitzer Prize for the Novel-winning works Category:Novels set in Oregon Category:Fiction set in the 1900s Category:Harper & Brothers books Category:1935 debut novels ","title":"Honey in the Horn"},{"id":"9802323","text":"Raintime is an Italian progressive / power metal band, founded in 1999. The band was initially significantly inspired by Dream Theater, and as such composed songs which leaned towards the progressive metal genre. They then recorded an instrumental demo entitled Jump in the Past. After the demo was released, the band's original drummer quit and Enrico Fabris replaced him. Also, Claudio Coassin, who played keyboards, switched to vocals, leaving keyboards to Andrea Corona. Their sound evolved into a new hybrid and borrows elements both from extreme metal, such as death growls and lower tuning of their instruments, and from more melodic genres, especially in regard to keyboards and vocals. With this new direction, the band recorded their debut album Tales from Sadness in 2005 with Arise Records. The second \\"official\\" chapter of the band, Flies & Lies (Lifeforce), released in 2007 and produced by Tommy Handsen, gave Raintime the possibility to perform live at ProgPower USA with bands like After Forever, Virgin Steele and Sonata Arctica. Their latest album, entitled Psychromatic, was released on 16 March 2010. Raintime stated on their Facebook on 27 May 2012 that the band would be disbanding due to \\"too many new members\\".

Between 1296 and 1300, James led a series of military operations in Murcia with the intention of conquering a large zone between Elda in the north and Hu√©rcal-Overa in the south.

She appeared on camera (identified as Dorothy Mengering) on Late Night with David Letterman on the \\"Parents' Night\\" broadcast of February 25, 1986, in which the parents of many Late Night staffers were also seen. Following several years of appearing via telephone, Mengering (usually billed as \\"Dave's Mom\\" or \\"Dave's Mom Dorothy\\", with no mention of her surname) became a recurring on-camera guest on Letterman's subsequent Late Show, initially by covering the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. She lived in Carmel, Indiana, at the time of her death. Personal life Dorothy Mengering was born Dorothy Marie Hofert in Linton, Indiana, the oldest child of Lena M. (n√©e Strietelmeier) and Earl Jacob Hofert. Mengering's maternal grandparents, Fredricke Hilgediek and William Strietelmeier, were born in Germany, and her father was of German descent.Ancestry of David Letterman A younger brother, Earl Jr. (1922‚Äì2009), and sister, Hazel (1923‚Äì2017) who died at age 93, less than three months after Mengering, were born respectively. Dorothy's first cousin is the grandmother of the model and actress Rebecca Romijn, a fact which was discussed on the Late Show with David Letterman. Mengering spent a year at Indiana University before marrying Harry Joseph (Joe) Letterman in 1942, with whom she had three children: Jan, David, and Gretchen. While raising her children, she assisted her husband, a florist, and worked as a secretary at her church, Second Presbyterian; she was widowed in 1973. In 1983, she married again, this time to Hans Mengering, a retired engineer and decorated World War II veteran who died on March 12, 2013. Appearances on Late Night Mengering made her first (and only) in-person appearance on Late Night as part of the \\"Parents' Day\\" broadcast of February 25, 1986. As part of the broadcast, Letterman cajoled her into yelling out the production office window with a bullhorn. Beginning in June 1990, Letterman would occasionally call his mother at home during the show. Mengering, who always addressed her son as \\"David\\", would patiently answer her son's questions and generally play along with his suggestions‚Äîthough some of Letterman's more deliberately nonsensical suggestions were kindly but firmly shut down. Letterman's phone calls would usually involve Mengering being asked to review a movie or a TV show, share a recipe, or recount a recent event in her life; on one occasion, she was asked to present a Top Ten list of things in her refrigerator. Appearances on The Late Show =Olympics= Mengering's first on-camera appearance on The Late Show was in 1994, when she provided nightly coverage of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. In the days immediately prior to her television debut, she fell and received eight stitches on her eyebrow and a black eye, and spent much of her on-camera time under many layers of makeup. While in Lillehammer, she interviewed Hillary Clinton (inquiring if her husband might be able to \\"fix\\" Dave's speeding tickets), Nancy Kerrigan (repeatedly asking her if she would like a cup of hot cocoa), and several other winter Olympians, including gold medal-winner Tommy Moe. Mengering reprised her role as Late Show Olympic commentator in 1998 and 2002, covering the Winter Games held in Nagano, Japan and Salt Lake City, Utah. =Other appearances= After her first appearance in 1994, Mengering appeared on the show several times each year. She made annual appearances on Thanksgiving, via satellite from her Indiana home, for a feature entitled \\"Guess Mom's Pies\\". She also appeared regularly a few days before Mothers' Day and made occasional visits on her birthday. In 1995, she traveled to London to film remote spots for The Late Show, which were aired later that year. Death In 2015, Mengering suffered a stroke, but recovered months later. Mengering died on April 11, 2017 of natural causes at her home in Carmel, Indiana, at the age of 95. She died one day shy of the 70th birthday of her son, David Letterman.https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/nation-now/2017/04/12/dorothy- mengering-david-lettermans-mom- dies-95/100362440/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/arts/television/obituary- dorothy-mengering-david-letterman-mother.html Quotes \\"The positive response to my appearances on David's show has nothing to do with my amateur abilities as a broadcaster.

Patel has worked in the area of biomedical informatics, in particular studying the mediating roles of technology on performance. Her work includes studies of medical errors and error reduction in emergency care and other critical medical environments, (including telephone triage). Her past work in health cognition includes studies of risk- taking behavior and sexual decision making as it pertains to HIV in youth and adolescents. Her current work focuses mostly on identifying underlying cognition in medical error and learning. Biography and career Patel was born in Fiji and obtained a degree in biochemistry and microbiology from University of Otago in New Zealand, and MA and PhD in Educational Psychology (Medical Cognition,1980,1981) from McGill University in Montreal, where she also served as professor of Medicine and Psychology and director of the Centre for Medical Education. She was a founding member of HEALnet (Health Evidence Application and Linkage Network), which made seminal contributions furthering informatics research and application in Canada. She was also a member of the InterMed Collaboratory, which developed guidelines for medical decision support, and has done extensive work in India, Africa, and Colombia in cross- cultural cognition research. In 2000 she became director of the Laboratory of Cognition and Decision Making in the department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University, where she was also faculty in the department of Psychiatry and Teacher's College. From 2007-09, she served as interim chair and vice chair of Department of BMI at Arizona State University. Patel was a Professor of Biomedical Informatics and Co-Director of the Center for Cognitive Informatics and Decision Making at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston from 2009-11. As of November 2011, Patel joined the New York Academy of Medicine as a Senior Research Scientist and is the head of the Center for Cognitive Studies in Medicine and Public Health and is an adjunct professor of Biomedical informatics at Columbia University in NY. Research In 1978 Elstein, Shulman and Sprafka applied cognitive science methods to investigate physicians‚Äô clinical competence, developing a model of hypothetico-deductive reasoning which proposed that physicians reason by generating and testing a set of hypotheses to explain clinical data. This is an example of backward (hypothesis-to-data) reasoning.Elstein, A.S., Shulman, L.S., and Sprafka, S.A. Medical Problem-Solving: An Analysis of Clinical Reasoning. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1978. In 1986, Patel and Groen demonstrated that experts who accurately diagnosed complex clinical problems used forward reasoning (data to hypothesis), in contrast to novice subjects who used backward reasoning and misdiagnosed or partially diagnosed the same problems.Patel, V.L. & Groen, G.J. (1986) Knowledge-based solution strategies in medical reasoning. Cognitive Science, 10, 91-116. Patel also applied text comprehension methods to understanding the use of clinical practice guidelines with the goal of increasing adoption of best practices.Patel, V.L., Kaufman, D.R. (2006) Cognitive Science and Biomedical Informatics. - E.H. Shortliffe & J.J. Cimino (Eds.) Biomedical Informatics: Computer Applications in Health Care and Biomedicine. New York: Springer- Verlag. P176. Patel and colleagues have recently argued for new paradigm for error studies, where instead of zero error tolerance, detection and correction of potential error is viewed as an integral part of cognitive work in a complex workplace.Patel, V.L., Cohen, T., Murarka, T., Olsen, J., Kagita, S., Myneni, S., Ghaemmaghami, V., (2010) Recovery at the Edge of Error: Debunking the Myth of the Infallible Expert.

In 2005 he was sentenced in U.S. court to 18 months in prison for tax fraud.http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2005/03/23/2003247453 Early life Axelrod was born to a Jewish family in New Jersey, the son of immigrant parents from Russia. His father was a mathematics and violin teacher, and his mother was a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy. Aquatics and publishing While serving in an Army MASH unit in Korea, he wrote his book The Handbook of Tropical Aquarium Fishes, which eventually sold more than one million copies. After returning from Korea, Axelrod earned a Ph.D. in biostatistics at New York University and started the magazine Tropical Fish Hobbyist. He wrote many other books on tropical fish and founded a publishing firm, TFH Publications (named for the magazine) that became the largest publisher of pet books in the world. TFH Publications was headquartered first in Jersey City, New Jersey, and then in Neptune, New Jersey. The New York Times has written that \\"his importance was undeniable. In an era before web forums and Google, collectors turned to Tropical Fish Hobbyist and Axelrod's dozens of books\\". In 1956, Leonard P. Schultz described the cardinal tetra, a popular aquarium fish, and gave it its scientific name, Paracheirodon axelrodi, which honors Axelrod. Although the fish had been discovered in Brazil in 1953 by Harald Sioli, a discus collector, Axelrod claimed that he had made the discovery himself during a steamboat trip on the Rio Negro, and he sent fish that he purchased from a dealer in New Jersey to the Smithsonian Institution, where the species was identified. In 1989, Axelrod donated his collection of fossil fish to the University of Guelph, which the university says is one of the largest donations by an individual to a Canadian university.Axelrod page at the University of Guelph The Axelrod Institute of Ichthyology at that university was named for him. The University of Guelph also named a lecture hall after him, the Axelrod Building, but in 2010 renamed it the Alexander Building, after Lincoln Alexander.U of G Honours Lincoln Alexander - News Release November 03, 2010 In 1997 Axelrod sold TFH Publications to Central Garden & Pet Company of California for $70 million. The contract included potential payouts to Axelrod if TFH reached earnings targets after the sale. He sued under that provision, accusing Central Garden of suppressing earnings to avoid paying the extra money. The following year, however, the purchaser filed a countersuit against him, claiming that he had grossly and illegally inflated the value of the company before the purchase. On September 1, 2005, Axelrod was ordered to pay Central Garden & Pet Company $16.4 million (net, after deducting $3.7 million the company was ordered to pay Axelrod due to earnings targets). Musical instruments collection The Axelrod quartet, on display in the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History Axelrod, a violinist himself, assembled a large collection of old and rare stringed instruments, including the Hellier Stradivarius. In 1975 he bought his first Stradivarius violin. In 1998 he donated four Stradivari instruments -- two violins, a viola and a cello -- to the Smithsonian Institution. Known as the Axelrod quartet, their value was estimated at $50 million. In February 2003 he sold about 30 other instruments to the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra (NJSO) for $18 million. This collection was estimated to be worth $49 million. (Axelrod was a long-time supporter of the NJSO.) Further legal difficulties Questions surfaced about the value of the instruments he had donated to the Smithsonian and the NJSO. Although the instruments were all old and valuable, several unnamed experts determined them not to be the instruments he represented them as, and not to be as valuable as he claimed. He was said to have invented histories for the instruments to explain away doubts or to increase their worth. In an unrelated case, Axelrod was indicted in federal court in New Jersey on April 13, 2004, accused of funneling millions of dollars into Swiss bank accounts over 20 years without paying taxes. The following April 21, he failed to appear for his arraignment, having fled to Cuba. He was arrested in Berlin on June 15, 2004 as he got off a plane from Switzerland, and then extradited to the United States. On March 21, 2005 he was sentenced in U.S. court to 18 months in prison for tax fraud. Legacy The cardinal tetra, Paracheirodon axelrodi, was named for Axelrod.

He was born in an aristocratic family from Piedmont. Under Fascism Sogno was born in Piedmont. He joined the Italian military at 18 and was named sublieutenant in the regiment Nizza Cavalleria. After graduating in jurisprudence, he volunteered for Benito Mussolini's auxiliary units which fought in the Spanish Civil War in 1938 on the Francoist side. He then became collaborator of the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1940 during World War II. He achieved two other diplomas in Rome and started frequenting some antifascist circles, which included Benedetto Croce and Giaime Pintor. He was called by the army in 1942 to go to Vichy France. However, he was arrested a year later on charges of high treason for having publicly predicted the victory of the United States. A monarchist, he was then close to the Italian Liberal Party (PLI), and he became representative of the PLI at the National Liberation Committee (Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale). He created the Partisan group Organizzazione Franchi and earned a gold medal for his acts, helping hundreds of Italian Jews and others seek safe haven in Switzerland. After the war Edgardo Sogno as military in 1940s. After the Liberation, he founded the Corriere Lombardo newspaper as well as Costume. Edgardo Sogno was then elected deputy to the Constituent Assembly during the 1946 general election. He contested the June 2, 1946 referendum creating the Republic of Italy, deposing numerous appeals before the Corte di Cassazione in the aim of repealing the results of the vote (and restore monarchy). Although this failed, he became diplomat of the new regime, first in Buenos Aires where Juan Peron was head of state, then in Paris, London, Washington DC and, last, he was ambassador in Rangoon. While posted to Budapest, Hungary, in 1956, he helped people flee the country after the Soviet Union invaded Hungary and crushed the Hungarian Revolution. He returned to Italy in 1971, where he founded the Comitati di Resistenza Democratica (Committee of Democratic Resistance), an anti-communist organization of the political center. Three years later, he was accused by the communist magistrate Luciano Violante of having planned, along with Luigi Cavallo and Randolfo Pacciardi, the Golpe bianco (\\"white coup d'etat\\"), a supposed coup. Following a year and a half of prison, he was freed in 1978, the investigative magistrate declaring that he was in the impossibility to proceed in the trial. He was later completely exonerated for attempting to plot a coup. Liberal, monarchist, then admirer of Charles de Gaulle, Edgardo Sogno returned to politics only in 1996, as candidate to the Italian Senate, in Cuneo, for the National Alliance (Alleanza Nazionale) party founded by Gianfranco Fini. Failing to be elected, he retired to private life. In his 1998 memoirs, Sogno revealed how he had visited the CIA station chief in Rome in July 1974 to inform him of his plans for an anti- communist coup. He wrote: \\"I told him that I was informing him as an ally in the struggle for the freedom of the west and asked him what the attitude of the American government would be,\\" and then: \\"He answered what I already knew: the United States would have supported any initiative tending to keep the communists out of government.\\"Philip Willan, The Guardian, March 26, 2001 Terrorists 'helped by CIA' to stop rise of left in Italy  See also  *History of Italy as a monarchy and in the World Wars *History of the Italian Republic *Italian Resistance and Partisans *Spanish Civil War  References   Bibliography  * *Due fronti (1998), memoirs (\\"Two Fronts\\", two accounts of the Spanish Civil War, one from the Francist side and Sogno, the other from Nino Isaia who took part to the International Brigades) *La grande utopia: I confini delleconomia, della natura, della morale Sugarco (1982) ASIN: B0000ECLR6 *De Gaulle: La spada appesa al filo Bietti (1997) Category:1915 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Counts of Italy Category:People from Turin Category:Italian monarchists Category:Italian nobility Category:Italian military personnel of World War II Category:Italian anti-communists Category:Italian resistance members Category:Italian Liberal Party politicians Category:National Alliance (Italy) politicians Category:20th-century Italian politicians Category:Italian people of the Spanish Civil War ","title":"Edgardo Sogno"},{"id":"9802606","text":"The Bradley-Martin Ball by Harry Whitney McVickar The Bradley-Martin Ball was a lavish costume ball at the Waldorf Hotel in New York City on the night of February 10, 1897. Cornelia Bradley-Martin, wife of Bradley Martin, organized the ball, with the intention of making it \\"the greatest party in the history of the city\\". Eight hundred socialites spent about $400,000 imitating kings and queens. Bradley-Martin's stated intention was to create an economic stimulus for New York City, which was at the end of the Long Depression which began in 1873 and included the Panic of 1893. The Bradley-Martins spent approximately $9.7 million in today's money to throw the ball. Across the country, preachers and editorial writers argued over the propriety of a party that would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In the end, the ball was a social triumph but created negative publicity.McGerr, Michael. A Fierce Discontent. Oxford University Press, Inc. NY, pages 4-6, 2003.  Before the Ball  Although the Bradley-Martin's stated intention was to benefit New York city through an economic stimulus, Bradley Martin's wife, Cornelia Bradley Martin, had other intentions as well. Cornelia Bradley Martin wished to arrange a costume ball that would surpass every other ball in history. She specifically wished to throw a greater ball than that of Alva Vanderbilt's famous ball of 1883, which was previously to be the greatest party in the history of the city. For weeks, Cornelia would have her secretary make sure that the papers had all the important details and would be widespread through the city. Before long, the public began to backlash. In the three weeks leading up to it, New York society made the ball its one topic of discussion. The Commercial Advertiser exclaimed: \\"There is a great stir today in fashionable circles and even in public circles. The cause of it all is the Bradley Martin ball, beside which the arbitration treaty, the Cuban question, and the Lexow investigation seem to have become secondary matters of public interest.\\" The guests included: Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, known simply as Mrs. Astor, costumed as Mary, Queen of Scots, her son John Jacob Astor as Henry IV of France and his wife as Marie Antoinette, James L. Breese as the Duke of Guise, John Pierpont Morgan, Charles Childs as Lady Teazle, Hermann Oelrichs as a Dutch Bergomaster, Charles Post as Madame de Maintenon, Stanford White in a Court costume of black velvet and white satin, the artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury as a Spanish toreador, Pierpont Morgan as Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and Hamilton Fish Webster as Maria Theresa of Austria. The Ball James L. Breese dressed as the Duke of Guise in white corded silk with embroidery of pearls and silver lace. = Concept = Cornelia Bradley- Martin's idea was to give a costume ball at so short notice that her guests would not have time to get their dresses from Paris, and instead support local businesses. This overlapped with the idea that it was much better for the laboring people if the wealthy spent their money locally instead of taking it to Europe. The Reverend Dr. Rainsford believed in the rich giving money to be distributed as charity, whereas others, including the members of the Musical Mutual Protective Union (MMPU), disagreed. They believed in the wealthy spending their wealth in enjoying themselves, and thus giving hundreds and thousands of working people an opportunity to earn money and maintain their self-respect instead of having to accept charity. The MMPU became indignant when they heard that the Marine Band was to be at the ball instead of musicians from their union. The members of the Marine Band did not urgently need the money that they were going to receive from the ball. = Preparations = Florist Small was in charge of the decorations for the Bradley-Martin ball. Decorating the Waldorf began on the morning of February 9 by A.W. Merritt, Small's colleague. In the days leading up to the event, dealers‚Äô stocks and household stores were ransacked to supply the demand for ornaments and historical accuracy. All the jewelers who dealt in antiques were cleaned out of all they had on hand. Jewels held as heirlooms by the old families of New York were taken from safety vaults. Laces that had been locked away in family chests or in safe deposit vaults for long years had been retrieved. Twelve hundred invitations were issued for the event, and more than half of those invited were in attendance. Some who did come also left early, seeming to have made an appearance out of curiosity. = The Waldorf = \\"The interior of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel was transformed into a replica of Versailles, and rare tapestries, beautiful flowers and countless lights made an effective background for the wonderful gowns and their wearers.\\" Police officers stood guard at the entrance to the Waldorf. The Bradley-Martins arrived first at 10:15 pm. At half past 10 a group of carriages arrived and before 11 the stream of guests had become continuous. The guests were ushered into the Waldorf, whereupon they ascended to the corridors on the second floor where 15 dressing rooms were available for the use and comfort of the guests. Some guests, preferring not to expose themselves on the street while wearing tempting fortunes in jewels and laces, changed into their costumes at this point. This wasn't done through any feeling of fear, but merely as a wise precaution. Wigmakers and make-up artists were available in these rooms. When leaving the dressing rooms the guests headed to the smaller ballroom. It was here where Cornelia Bradley-Martin received her guests. A lackey announced the guests‚Äô names and the characters they impersonated to her. This stream of guests poured by her for nearly 90 minutes and it was after midnight before she was able to enter the main ballroom to take her place in the opening quadrille d‚Äôhonneur. A Cameo of Cornelia Bradley-Martin dressed as Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, for the Ball. = Costumes = Cornelia Bradley-Martin requested her guests to pick something from the 16th, 17th, or 18th centuries, and some came dressed as George Washington, a Japanese nobleman, an Egyptian princess and Pocahontas. A list was compiled and published in the New York Times three days prior to the event, listing guests and the historical characters they were going to impersonate and what costumes they were going to wear. Bradley-Martin \\"personated Mary Stuart, and her gold embroidered gown was trimmed with pearls and precious stones worth more than $60,000. Bradley (Martin), as Louis XV, wore a Court suit of brocade\\". \\"In many cases the diamond buttons worn by the men represented thousands of dollars, and the value of the historic gems worn by the ladies baffles description.\\" At the time, the average income of an American was $400 a year. Otho Cushing, a young artist from Boston, created quite a stir when he appeared as an Italian falconer's costume which consisted of full body tights, a short jacket and a cap with a stuffed falcon on one arm. \\"The costume left little to the imagination as far as the figure was concerned, and, although historically correct in every detail, was so decidedly pronounced that he made a sensation wherever he moved.\\" = Decorations = The smaller ballroom was set throughout with furniture of the Louis XV period, and the walls were hung with tapestry draperies. Roses were hurled en masse against the draperies and let remain where they landed. The side of the room, where the Hungarian band was placed, was concealed by long-stemmed roses and garlands were dropped from the center to each side and over the mirrors. The Hungarian Band, under the leadership of Carl Berlinger, played 12 concert selections, chosen by Mrs. Bradley-Martin, throughout the evening. Upon entering the grand ballroom the guests faced a wall in which 15 mirrors were imbedded. The far side of the room, the musicians‚Äô balcony, was concealed by pink roses, with garlands also hanging from above. There were over 5,000 roses and 3,000 orchids in these various groupings. The caf√© and the court were also decorated, with a desired homelike effect. 125 tables were set up, each to accommodate six guests, with a centerpiece of Beauty roses. = Music = The danse d‚Äôhonneur, arranged by Caroline Astor, opened the ball. The company was led by Cornelia Bradley- Martin, in the role of the Queen, escorted by John Jacob Astor as the King. For this danse d‚Äôhonneur, the orchestra played music composed by Beethoven. Following this, the orchestra started playing one of Chopin's polonaises announcing the approach of the wife of Edmund L. Baylies and her associates for the minuet. When they formed for the minuet the orchestra struck into Mozart's dance music out of \\"Don Giovanni\\". The dance of the debutantes was next, and it was livelier than the others and the most difficult of all. The members of this set, organized by the wife of Frederic Bronson, danced a Hungarian Court quadrille, the Kormagyar, in music arranged by Allen Dodworth. This quadrille ended the exhibition dances. General dancing followed the three quadrilles until supper time. = Entertainment and Favors = The cotillion commenced at three, and spectators found amusement as the gentlemen danced it with swords at their sides. Swords got tangled in gowns and laces, and courtiers tripped over them, to the delight of the spectators. Elisha Dyer, Jr. led the cotillion. Cornelia Bradley-Martin selected small silver figures and a staff as ‚Äúfavors‚Äù for each of the guests of the ball. The ‚Äúfavors‚Äù were awarded by Elisha Dyer, Jr. as leader of the cotillion.  Reaction and Controversy  Before the Ball took place, the Bradley-Martins drew fire from all directions, as newspapers criticized its extravagance and clergymen urged their congregations not to attend. One clergyman denounced the ball by saying: \\"You rich people put next to nothing in the collection plate, and yet you‚Äôll spend thousands of dollars on Mrs. Bradley-Martin‚Äôs ball‚Äù. After the ball many ministers preached against its excessive consumption and the authorities promptly raised Bradley-Martin's taxes (as well as those of their friends and fellow-attendees the Astors) quite out of proportion to those paid by anyone else. The Bradley-Martins returned to England, where they had owned a home for several years, and Scotland, where they leased a estate, Balmacaan. Although historians have repeated oft-told half-truths without conducting primary research, the Bradley-Martin ball is perhaps best-remembered as the end of the excesses of the Gilded Age.

Non-use value as a category may include: * \\"option value\\" ‚Äì the value placed on individual willingness to pay for maintaining an asset or resource even if there is little or no likelihood of the individual actually ever using it, occurring because of uncertainty about future supply (the continued existence of the asset) and potential future demand (the possibility that it may someday be used).Brookshire, D.S., L.S.

The continued availability of the good provides some value to the individual insofar as s/he may eventually be in a position to use the good. All of these categories are offspring of the original concept of option value that was introduced into the cost benefit analysis lexicon in 1964 by Burton Weisbrod to justify individuals' valuation of goods, assets and resources that they do not actually use.Weisbrod, Burton. 1964. \\"Collective Consumption Services of Individual Consumption Goods,\\" Quarterly Journal of Economics, 78 (3):471-477 In general, it is not possible to use market prices or other revealed preference methods to measure non-use value.

Laid down on 9 January 1943, she was named for the Kennebago River located in Rangeley, Maine. Kennebago, a type T2-SE-A2 tanker hull, was built at Marinship, Sausalito, California, and launched on 9 May 1943, sponsored by Mrs. W. E. Waste, the ship was commissioned by the US Navy on 4 December 1943. Service history =United States Navy, 1943-1946= After an initial shakedown cruise off the west coast, Kennebago departed San Diego on 24 January 1944 for various bases in the Aleutians carrying fuel oil and aviation gasoline. She returned to San Diego on 28 February, loaded with fuel, and departed for the Marshall Islands. She arrived on 15 April and continued to make fueling runs from Pearl Harbor to the Marshalls. After the United States invasion of the Marianas, Kennebago departed the Marshalls on 19 June, and arrived in Saipan on 22 June to refuel ships of the 5th Fleet. After continuing refueling operations in the area, she departed Manus on 9 October to rendezvous with Vice Admiral Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force, Task Force 38, conducting operations in the Philippine Sea. After refueling ships until 23 October, she departed for Ulithi, continuing to refuel ships east of the Philippines until 25 December. Next, she would support the landing operations in Lingayen Gulf, fueling ships that were operating as part of the task force. She continued on refueling operations in the theater until 6 April 1945, when she would sail for Los Angeles, California, arriving there 24 April. After a brief overhaul, Kennebago was again ready for operations in the Western Pacific, departing on 12 June, after brief stops in San Francisco, California, and Pearl Harbor. After arriving back at Ulithi on 4 July, she continued refueling ships operating in Japanese waters off Honsh≈´. After the Japanese surrender, she operated out of Okinawa until 9 October, when she would steam to Taku, China to support the United States 7th Fleet in support of the Nationalist Chinese troops fighting the Communist Chinese for control of China. After returning to Pearl Harbor on 28 December, she returned to Hong Kong on 26 January 1946 and sailed for San Francisco on 17 February. Once returning stateside, Kennebago sailed for Boston, Massachusetts on 28 March, arriving 19 April. =Military Sea Transportation Service, 1949-1959= After over a year, Kennebago was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 27 May 1947 as part of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. She was reacquired by the United States Navy on 1 October 1949 and was placed in service with the Military Sea Transportation Service as USNS Kennebago (T-AO-81) in September 1950. After serving in the Korean War and supporting the American naval power during the early Cold War, she was released to the Maritime Administration on 27 November 1957 in Beaumont, Texas. Again, she was reacquired by the Navy on 23 May 1958 for logistical supply in the Pacific. During 1959, she served the 6th Fleet operating in the Mediterranean Sea. After returning to New York City on 22 May 1959 she was transferred to the National Defense Reserve Fleet again in the James River, Virginia on 23 June 1959. =United States Army, 1966-1971= On 20 May 1966, Kennebago served her final mission for the United States Army in Vietnam.

He was advised instead to live the life of a crypto-Jew. He suffered martyrdom by being burned at the stake in Geneva on April 20, 1632. Early life  Nicolas Antoine was born of Catholic parents in 1602 or 1603 at Briey, a small town of Lorraine. For five years he attended the college at Luxemburg, and was then sent to Pont-√†-Mousson, Treves, and Cologne for higher instruction under the Jesuits. Their influence, however, seems to have been nil; for when Antoine returned to Briey, at the age of twenty, he was no longer an ardent Catholic. The doctrines of Protestantism attracted him, and he allowed himself to be converted by the fervent eloquence of Ferri, a preacher of reputation, and pastor of the Reformed Church in Metz. The young convert then attended the academies of Sedan and Geneva in order to study the Reformed faith, but the deeper he delved into the study of Protestantism the less fervent became his enthusiasm; and he very soon arrived at the most unexpected conclusion; namely, that the Old Testament alone contained the truth. Crypto-Judaism The rabbinate of Metz refused to receive the young man into Judaism, offering as an excuse the fear of reprisals on the part of the authorities, and Antoine was advised to go to the Netherlands or to Italy, where Jews enjoyed more liberty. Accompanied by a Christian clergyman whom he had known in Sedan, and whom he attempted to convert to Judaism on the way, he traveled to Venice. There he found that the prevailing conditions had been too favorably depicted. The Jews were tolerated by the Venetian Republic merely for commercial reasons; they lived in the Venetian Ghetto and were obliged to wear a yellow disk. The Venetian Jews could offer Antoine no more encouragement than their brethren of Metz. At Padua he met with a similar check. According to the documents produced at his trial, the Italian Jews gave him the \\"diabolical advice\\" to pursue the life of a pious Jew under the cloak of the Church. Antoine proceeded to Geneva, where he accepted a position as tutor in the family of the pastor and professor Diodati. For some time he also taught the upper class of the college, but, being an apostate from Catholicism, he was not considered sufficiently orthodox to be entrusted with the chair of philosophy at the Academy of Geneva. Protestant pastor Antoine, desiring to marry, sought another appointment. A new Protestant parish had just been formed at Divonne, a little village of the district of Gex, which had belonged to France since 1602, but was now under the religious jurisdiction of Geneva; and there Antoine obtained the position of pastor. Once installed, he sought to pacify his conscience. Revealing his inmost convictions to no one, he secretly observed a thoroughly Jewish mode of life, saying his prayers in Hebrew and observing all the Mosaic rites. In his public services he pronounced the name of Jesus as seldom as possible. He was never known to read the apostolic confession audibly. In the communion service, instead of the words \\"This is my body, this is my blood\\" he was once heard to say \\"Your Savior remembers you\\". His sermons, the texts for which were taken exclusively from Isaiah and the other prophets, became celebrated far and wide; yet they lacked any peculiarly Christian characteristics. The peasants of Divonne were perfectly satisfied with their pastor, who was eloquent in the extreme and full of kindness toward them; they were not shocked by the vague form of his sermons, but the lord of the adjoining manor was outraged. One Sunday, Antoine preached on the second Psalm, which, according to orthodox Christian theology, announces the coming of the son of God. Antoine, on the contrary, declared that God had no son and that there was but the one God. This was too much for the lord, he remonstrated loudly with the heretical pastor and threatened to denounce him to the synod. Antoine fell into gloomy despair; a nervous attack deprived him of his reason. To several colleagues from Geneva who had come to see him he began to chant the seventy-fourth Psalm, then he suddenly stopped, and, exclaiming that he was a Jew, blasphemed Christianity. He was put to bed but he escaped his watchers, passed the night wandering through the country, and was found the next morning in Geneva in a most pitiable condition, kneeling in the streets and calling loudly upon the God of Israel. He was placed in an asylum for the insane on Feb. 11, 1632. Medical treatment accomplished but little for him. His clerical colleagues did all they could to induce him to change his religion but he never ceased to proclaim that he was a Jew and desired to remain a Jew. Imprisonment and execution A charge of heresy could no longer be avoided; the chief of the Geneva police arrested Antoine, and instituted proceedings. While he was in prison the clergy were tireless in seeking his reconversion, trying in vain to make him sign a declaration of orthodox faith. Bidden to formulate his religious belief, he drew up twelve articles, which were submitted to an ecclesiastical court. In them he gave the tenets of Judaism in the style of Maimonides' Thirteen Principles of Faith, and added \\"eleven philosophical objections against the dogma of the Trinity.\\" At the same time he addressed to the judges three memorials, two of which have been preserved. In spite of the exertions of Metrezat, a pastor of Paris, and others, the judges were immovable. The trial commenced April 11; Antoine's attitude, full of dignity, aroused much sympathy. The threats of the judges were of no more avail than the persuasions of his colleagues. He repeated constantly: \\"I am a Jew; and all I ask of God's grace is to die for Judaism.\\" The court sought to show that he had promulgated his heretical doctrines at Geneva: this he contradicted most forcibly. All the efforts of the judges were met with the unchanging reply, \\"With the help of God I am determined to die in my present belief.\\" Fifteen clergymen or professors of theology were summoned as witnesses. Several of them begged for a light sentence, since, in their opinion, Antoine had committed no sin by becoming a Jew, although for his hypocrisy he deserved unfrocking or banishment, or, at worst, excommunication. Furthermore, they said that the matter ought not to be hastened, and that the advice of the various churches and academies should be sought. A fanatical majority, however, insisted that the judges should seize the present opportunity to demonstrate their faith, since it was most dangerous to absolve one who had professed Judaism while wearing the garb of a Christian priest. For some days longer the judges waited for Antoine to recant. As his recantation was not forthcoming, they pronounced sentence April 20, 1632; condemning him to be loaded with chains, placed upon a pyre, to be there strangled, and then burned. In vain the clergy petitioned for a respite; Antoine was executed the same day.

Dent & Sons Ltd, London) - Chapter 10: The Mature Baroque: Vocal Music - p318 \\"Masques continued to be given privately throughout the period of the Civil war (1642 - 49), the Commonwealth (1649 - 60) and the early years of the Restoration of Charles II (reg. 1660 - 85). The most elaborate of these private entertainments was Cupid and Death (1653)...\\" Background After the closure of the theatres in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War, Shirley earned a living as a schoolteacher. As part of his new occupation, he wrote dramas -- morality plays and masques -- for his students to perform. The final works of his career, including Honoria and Mammon and The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses (both published in 1659), were works for student performers. Cupid and Death is another work in this category, though its resemblances with the great masques of the late Stuart Court have been noted by critics -- it \\"is much more like a Court Masque than any of Shirley's other school Masques\\".Edward Dent, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 160. Perhaps this aspect of the work made it seem appropriate for the Portuguese ambassador, the Count of Peneguia√µ. Shirley's past Royalist connections with the Stuart Court, and even his Roman Catholicism, clearly (if surprisingly) did not stand as insuperable obstacles to a public staging of the work.Clare, pp. 153-4. Publication Cupid and Death was first published in quarto in 1653, by the booksellers John Crook and John Baker. It was reprinted in 1659. The full musical score for the masque, by Matthew Locke and Christopher Gibbons, has survived, and was published together with Shirley's text in a modern edition in 1951.By Edward J. Dent, in Musica Britanica, Vol. 2 (1951). Sources The drama depends on a traditional tale, found in Aesop and many subsequent versions. For his source, Shirley employed a 1651 translation of Aesop by John Ogilby, with whom he'd worked at the Werburgh Street Theatre in the later 1630s. Shirley wrote commendatory verses for Ogilby's volume. Plot In the tale and in Shirley's retelling, Death and Cupid accidentally exchange their arrows and cause chaos as a result. Cupid shoots potential lovers and inadvertently kills them. Death shoots at elderly people whose time of passing has come, and strikes them ardent instead; he shoots duellists about to fight, and they drop their swords to embrace and dance and sing. The \\"serious\\" portion of the masque features the kind of personifications standard in the masque form: Nature, Folly, Madness, and Despair. As usual in masques of Shirley's era, the work contains a comic anti-masque, with a tavern Host and a Chamberlain, and a dance of \\"Satyrs and Apes.\\" (The poor Chamberlain is struck by Death with Cupid's arrow, and falls in love with an ape.) The god Mercury eventually intervenes to set things right; Cupid is banished from the courts of princes to common people's cottages (a suitably sober moral for the Puritan regime then in power). The slain lovers are shown rejoicing in Elysium. \\"Cupid and Death resembles Caroline masque in its use of staging, music, dance, singing and dialogue. Yet it differs in that the masquers take part in the action and they do not dance with the audience at the end...The balance between spoken prose dialogue, recitative and song carries the performance away from masque and towards opera, a form Davenant planned to introduce to the London stage as early as 1639.\\"Corns, p. 276. Cupid and Death was performed at Rutland Boughton's Glastonbury Festival in 1919,Rose, p. 29. by the Consorte of Musicke (notably Anthony Rooley and Emma Kirkby) in 1985, and by the Halast√≥ K√≥rus (directed by G√∂ttinger P√°l) in Budapest in 2008.

The first commission, formed in 1963, was established as a body of inquiry tasked with investigating the \\"phenomenon of the [Sicilian] Mafia\\". Subsequent commissions expanded their scope to investigate all \\"organized crime of the Mafia type\\", which included other major criminal organizations in Italy such as the Camorra, the 'Ndrangheta and the Sacra Corona Unita. The Commission's goal is to study the phenomenon of organized crime in all its forms and to measure the adequacy of existing anti-crime measures, legislative and administrative, according to their results. The Commission also has judicial powers in that it may instruct the judicial police to carry out investigations, it can ask for copies of court proceedings, and is entitled to request any form of collaboration that it deems necessary. Those who provide testimony to the Commission are obliged by law to tell the truth. The Commission can also submit reports to the Parliament as often as desired, but does so at least on an annual basis.Jamieson, The Antimafia, p. 52 Preceding events The first proposal to constitute a commission of inquiry into the Mafia was the result of post-war struggles for land reform and the violent reaction against peasant organizations and its leaders, culminating in the killing of 11 people and the wounding of over thirty at a May 1 labour day parade in Portella della Ginestra. The attack was attributed to the bandit and separatist leader Salvatore Giuliano. Nevertheless, the Mafia was suspected of involvement in the Portella della Ginestra massacre and many other previous and subsequent attacks. La Commissione parlamentare antimafia On September 14, 1948, a Parliamentary commission of inquiry into the public security situation on Sicily (Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sulla situazione dell'ordine pubblico) was proposed by deputy Giuseppe Berti of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in a debate on the violence in Sicily. However, the proposal was turned down by the Minister of the Interior, Mario Scelba, amidst indignant voices about prejudice against Sicily and Sicilians. L'istituzione della prima Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sulla mafia in: L'art. 41-bis l. 354/75 come strumento di lotta contro la mafia, by Elisa Fontanelli, bachelor's degree dissertation, Florence university, 2005Servadio, Mafioso, p. 197-220 Ten years later, in 1958, senator Ferruccio Parri again proposed to form a Commission. The proposal was not taken up by the parliamentary majority and in 1961 the Christian Democrat party (DC - Democrazia Cristiana) in the Senate and Sicilian politicians like Bernardo Mattarella and Giovanni Gioia (both later accused of links with the Mafia) dismissed the proposal as \\"useless\\". However, in March 1962, amidst gang wars in Palermo, the Sicilian Assembly asked for an official inquiry. On April 11, 1962, the Senate in Rome approved the bill, but it took eight months before the Chamber of Deputies put the law to a vote. It was finally approved it on December 20, 1962. First Commission (1963-1982) The first Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry on the Mafia phenomenon in Sicily (Italian: Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul fenomeno della mafia in Sicilia) was formed in February 1963, in the midst of the First Mafia War, under the presidency of Paolo Rossi of the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (Partito Socialista Democratico Italiano, PSDI). It took a long time to form because newspapers and parliamentarians alike were opposed to the inclusion of Sicilians. It lasted less than three months before the general elections of April 28, 1963. The second president in the new legislature was the Christian Democrat Donato Pafundi, and was formed on June 5, 1963. Later that month, on June 30, 1963, a car bomb exploded in Ciaculli, an outlying suburb of Palermo, killing seven police and military officers sent to defuse it after an anonymous phone call. The bomb was intended for Salvatore \\"Ciaschiteddu\\" Greco, head of the Sicilian Mafia Commission and the boss of the Ciaculli Mafia family. The Ciaculli massacre changed the Mafia war into a war against the Mafia. It prompted the first concerted anti-mafia efforts by the state in post-war Italy. On July 6, 1963 the Antimafia Commission met for the first time. It would take 13 years and two more legislatures before a final report was submitted in 1976. The PCI claimed the Christian Democrat party (DC) put members on the Commission to stop the inquiry moving too far in the political field, such as the Commission‚Äôs vice- president Antonio Gullotti and Giovanni Matta, a former member of the Palermo city council. Matta‚Äôs arrival in 1972 created a scandal, he had been mentioned in a report and was summoned to testify in the previous legislature about the role of the Mafia in real estate speculation. The PCI called for his resignation, and in the end the whole Commission under the presidency of Luigi Carraro had to resign and be recomposed without Matta again.I pregiudicati nell'Antimafia , by Umberto Santino, Centro Siciliano di Documentazione \\"Giuseppe Impastato\\" =New legislation= In September 1963 the Commission presented a draft law, passed by Parliament in May 1965 as Law 575 entitled ‚ÄòDispositions against the Mafia‚Äô, the first time the word Mafia had been used in legislation. The law extended 1956 legislation concerning individuals considered to be ‚Äòsocially dangerous‚Äô to those ‚Äòsuspected of belonging to associations of the Mafia type‚Äô. The measures included special surveillance; the possibility of ordering a suspect to reside in a designed place outside his home area and the suspension of publicly issued licenses, grants or authorizations. The law gave powers to a public prosecutor or questor (chief of police) to identify and trace the assets of anyone suspected of involvement in a Mafia-type association.Jamieson, The Antimafia, p. 16-23 However, the efficacy of the new law was severely limited. Firstly, because there was no legal definition of a Mafia association. Secondly, because the obligation for mafiosi to reside in areas outside Sicily, actually opened up new opportunities to develop illicit activities in the cities of northern and central Italy. Amending this law, during the next four decades, was the main aim in the legislative fight against mafia: it happened by \\"La Torre-Rognoni law\\" (1982) and by some cornerstone judgement of Supreme Court of Cassation.\\"The Supreme Court now recognizes a bilateral relationship between the parties of the illicit exchange, but states that it is not always between material benefits, but also between the promised benefits\\": =Interim reports= Francesco Cattanei, second president of the Antimafia Commission In 1966 Pafundi declared: ‚ÄúThese rooms here are like an ammunition store. In order to give us the chance to the very root of the truth we don‚Äôt want them to explode too soon. We have here a load of dynamite.‚Äù However, the store never exploded, and in March 1968 Pafundi summed up the efforts of the Commission in three discreet pages. All the documents were locked away. Pafundi‚Äôs successor who took over the Commission in 1968 was a different man. Francesco Cattanei was a Christian Democrat from the north of Italy and he was determined to investigate thoroughly. Cattanei came under attack of his fellow Christian Democrats. The party‚Äôs official newspaper, Il Popolo, wrote that the Commission had become an instrument of the Communists. Everything was tried to smear his reputation, but supported by the majority of the Commission and public opinion he resisted the pressure to resign. In July 1971 the Commission published an intermediary report with biographies of prominent mafiosi such as Tommaso Buscetta and summarized the characteristics of the Mafia. The Commission investigated the activities and failed prosecution of Luciano Leggio, the administration of Palermo and the wholesale markets in the city, as well as the links between the Mafia and banditry in the post-War period. In its report of March 1972, the Commission said in its introduction: ‚ÄúGenerally speaking magistrates, trade unionists, prefects, journalists and the police authorities expressed an affirmative judgement on the existence of more or less intimate links between Mafia and the public authorities ‚Ä¶ some trade unionists reached the point of saying that ‚Äòthe mafioso is a man of politics‚Äô.‚Äù The Commission‚Äôs main conclusion was that the Mafia was strong because it had penetrated the structure of the State. The Commission was dissolved when new elections made an end to the legislature. In the next legislature, Cattanei was replaced with Luigi Carraro, a Christian Democrat that was more sensitive to the fears of the Christian Democrat Party that had been under attack of the Commission. =Disappointing results= Judge Cesare Terranova, member of the Antimafia Commission In 1972 Cesare Terranova, previously chief investigative prosecutor in Palermo who had prepared several Mafia Trials in the 1960s, such as the Trial of the 114, that had ended with disappointing little convictions, entered the Commission. He was elected for the Independent Left under the auspices of the Italian Communist Party (PCI). He became the secretary of the Commission. Terranova, together with PCI deputy Pio La Torre, wrote the minority report of the Commission, which pointed to links between the Mafia and prominent politicians, in particular of the Christian Democrat party (DC - Democrazia Cristiana). Terranova had urged his colleagues of the majority to take their responsibility. According to the minority report: :‚Ä¶ it would be a grave error on the part of the Commission to accept the theory that the Mafia-political link has been eliminated. Even today the behaviour of the ruling DC group in the running of the City and the Provincional Councils offers the most favourable terrain for the perpetuation of the system of Mafia power. In the final report of the first Commission, the former mayor of Palermo, Salvo Lima was described as one of the pillars of Mafia power in Palermo. It had no formal consequences for Lima. (In 1993 the fourth Commission led by Luciano Violante concluded that there were strong indications of relations between Lima and members of Cosa Nostra. By then Lima had been killed by the Mafia). In its conclusions, the Commission made many recommendations and offered much advice to those bodies that were going to take the job on. It criticized some authorities and condemned others. The government did nothing, however. When the results were published, every effort was made to confuse their message and diminish their value, and drowned in a sea of slander. The reports and the documentation of the Antimafia Commission were essentially disregarded. Terranova would talk of ‚Äúthirteen wasted years‚Äù of the Antimafia Commission. The final report was issued at a time when the question of the Mafia was pushed to the background by the political turmoil in the 1970s, known as the years of lead (it: anni di piombo), a period characterized by widespread social conflicts and terrorism acts attributed to far-right and far-left political movements and the secret services. Second Commission (1982-1987) Pio La Torre The second Antimafia Commission was installed on September 13, 1982, in the midst of the Second Mafia War, after the killing of former deputy and member of the first Antimafia Commission, Pio La Torre, on April 30, 1982, and the prefect of Palermo, general Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa on September 3, 1982. The first president was the Christian Democrat senator Nicola La Penta, who was succeeded by the Communist deputy Abdon Alinovi. The Commission had no power to investigate. It analysed Antimafia legislation, in particular the new Antimafia law (known as the Rognoni-La Torre law) and the performance of the state and judicial authorities. While the Commission was in function, the Maxi Trial against the Mafia took place in Palermo. The Commission also analysed new developments in Cosa Nostra after their entry in drug trafficking. The Commission was dissolved at the end of the legislature in July 1987. Third Commission (1987-1992) The third Commission was installed in 1987 under the presidency of PCI senator Gerardo Chiaromonte. This Commission marked a change in operations: the focus shifted from analyses and knowledge about the Mafia to proposals at the legislative and administrative level. The Commission studied the connections between the four Mafia-type organizations and the links between the Mafia and secret Masonic lodges. It lobbied for the introduction of new legislation such as the reform of the Rognoni-La Torre law whereby asset seizure and confiscation provisions were applicable to other forms of criminal association including drug trafficking, extortion and usury among others.Jamieson, The Antimafia, p. 37-38 The third Commission decided to make public the 2.750 files on links between the Mafia and politicians that had been kept secret by the first Commission. Looking ahead to the general elections of April 5, 1992, in February 1992 the Commission urged political parties to apply a code of self-regulation when presenting candidates, a measure intended to mirror the legislative provisions for public-office holders in 1990: no one should stand for election who had been committed for trial, was a fugitive from the law, was serving a criminal sentence, was subject to preventive measures or was convicted, even though not definitively, for crimes of corruption, Mafia association and a range of others. A week before the election the Commission reported that on the basis of information received from two-thirds of the prefectures in the country, 33 candidates standing in the forthcoming elections were ‚Äònon presentable‚Äô according to the code of self-regulation. Fourth Commission (1992-1994) Luciano Violante The fourth Commission was installed on June 8, 1992, after the murder of judge Giovanni Falcone on May 23 and was modified after the killing of his colleague Paolo Borsellino on July 19. On September 23, Luciano Violante from the Democratic Party of the Left (Partito democratico della Sinistra, PDS) was appointed president of the Commission. Under Violante‚Äôs leadership the Commission worked for 17 months until the dissolution of Parliament in February 1994. It passed 13 reports, but its most important one was on the relations between the Mafia and politics, the so-called terzo livello (third level) of the Mafia, on April 6, 1993.Jamieson, The Antimafia, p. 52-60 The Commission had to work in one of Italy‚Äôs most critical moment when the country‚Äôs democracy was challenged by criminal subversion by the Mafia and the Mani pulite investigation that unravelled Tangentopoli (Italian for bribeville), the corruption-based political system that dominated Italy. Despite the political sensitive nature of the Commission‚Äôs work, Violante‚Äôs greatest achievement was that the most important reports were backed by all major parties instead, as in the past, of producing majority (government) and minority (opposition) reports on the same theme. Important pentiti like Tommaso Buscetta, Antonio Calderone, Leonardo Messina and Gaspare Mutolo gave testimonies. It found that Salvo Lima, a former Christian Democrat mayor of Palermo who was murdered in March 1992, had been linked to the Mafia and that former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti had been Lima's \\"political contact\\" in Rome. On November 16, 1992 Tommaso Buscetta testified before the Antimafia Commission. \\"Salvo Lima was, in fact, the politician to whom Cosa Nostra turned most often to resolve problems for the organisation whose solution lay in Rome,\\" Buscetta said. Other collaborating witnesses confirmed that Lima had been specifically ordered to \\"fix\\" the appeal of the Maxi Trial with Italy's Supreme Court and had been murdered because he failed to do so. Audizione del collaboratore della giustizia Tommaso Buscetta Gaspare Mutolo warned the Commission in February 1993 of the likelihood that further attacks were being planned by the Corleonesi on the mainland. Audizione del collaboratore di giustizia Gaspare Mutolo, Antimafia Commission, February 9, 1993 The Senate authorized to proceed with the criminal investigation of Giulio Andreotti on June 10, 1993 (he was formally committed for trial in Palermo on March 2, 1995).

Early life Bosch was born at Osborne's Flat, near Beechworth, Victoria, the son of George Bosch, a miner from Bavaria, and his wife Emily, n√©e Spann, of Hamburg. His father belonged to a Dutch family, which migrated to Hamburg and became prosperous merchants. George Henry Bosch was educated at T. and C. McAlpine's private school at Richmond, a suburb of Melbourne, and was then apprenticed to a watchmaker. Career Bosch went to Sydney in 1881 and with his father's help, established a small watchmaker's business. He began importing watchmakers' and jewellers' supplies, and about 1884 joined forces with Emil Barthel, who had a similar business, under the name of Bosch, Barthel and Company. The importing of dental and opticians' supplies was added in 1885, and the business became the largest of its kind in Australia. In 1894 Bosch bought Barthel's interest in the business, which continued to progress and expand with branches in Melbourne and Brisbane. Working very hard and living simply, Bosch became very wealthy, and he quietly gave away considerable sums of money. His first public gift was a large donation to the Dreadnought Fund in 1909. He had a breakdown in 1915 due to overwork, and henceforth had to go more quietly. In 1924 he gave a sum of ¬£1000 to the University of Sydney for research on paralysis; his mother was a partial cripple. This was followed in 1925 by ¬£2000 for cancer research, and in 1928 ¬£27,000 was given to establish a chair in histology and embryology, and ¬£1500 for the purchase of apparatus for the anatomy department. In October 1929, ¬£220,000 in city properties and securities was transferred to the university to establish full-time chairs in medicine, surgery and bacteriology, and for the building and equipping of laboratories or the promotion of medical and surgical knowledge. Another large donation was ¬£10,000 to Trinity Grammar School (New South Wales), and he contributed largely to the upkeep of the Millewa boys' home and the Windsor boys' farm. Though he practically retired in 1924, he had another breakdown in 1928, but after a long holiday in the east, he came back in much improved health. In July 1932 the university received a further sum of ¬£6000. Death and legacy Bosch died at Sydney on 30 August 1934. He had married Gwendoline Jupp in 1929, who had nursed him through an illness. She survived him with two sons. After providing for legacies and a life interest for his widow, further substantial benefits will eventually accrue to the University of Sydney.Gwendoline, and separately the two infant boys, sought further provision from the estate. The history is recounted in the advice of the Privy Council in Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Company Limited [1938] A.C. 463. Gwendoline and the boys were successful in some measure. A portrait of Bosch by George Washington Lambert is in the great hall at the university, and there is a memorial window at St John's Church, Gordon, Sydney. Bosch was a keen business man, whose only recreation was walking until he took up golf in middle life; he was honorary treasurer of Manly Golf Club for many years. He looked upon his wealth as a responsibility and gave much thought to his benefactions, his chief desire being that he might alleviate human suffering.

It contains an aquatics centre, meeting and convention rooms, a fitness centre, two NHL size ice surface arenas, bowling lanes and an indoor walking track. The swimming portion (Phase 1) consists of a 25 metre competition pool, pleasure pool, a water slide, a water mushroom, a hot tub, steam room, and sauna. There is also a conference centre over in size, and Iron Haven Gym, with two squash courts and weight lifting equipment. The second portion (Phase 2), the Arenas, were designed to replace Cahill Stadium and Steele Arena. Beginning in the fall of 2011, the venue was home to the Summerside Storm of the National Basketball League of Canada until the team relocated to the Eastlink Centre in Charlottetown. History Main arena, with the main entrance/pool/fitness centre to the rear, bowling alley and VIP boxes to the right and second ice pad to the left The 3,728 seat arena opened March 1, 2007, featuring a game between divisional rivals: the Summerside Capitals, and Charlottetown Abbies. The Capitals won the game 11‚Äì3 in front of 3,417 fans. The ice surface measures 200 x 85 Ft (61 x 26 m). The rink has ten luxury boxes lining the east wall, and has high glass surrounding the entire ice surface. The rink employs angled lights for the benefit of players in sports such as volleyball, so the lights do not shine into their eyes, and the scoreboard retracts into the rafters quite easily for shows requiring a high ceiling, such as a Monster Truck event. There is also a running track at the top of the seating bowl. These features make no difference for the game of hockey, but make the facility much more attractive in its mission of being a multifunction facility. The secondary ice surface consists of a 200 x 85 Ft (61 x 26 m) rink, as well as bleacher style seating for approximately seven hundred people. The secondary ice surface opened March 2, 2007. A new set of bowling lanes was opened in the facility as a replacement to the old lanes at Cahill Stadium. There was a large explosion on the roof during construction, setting the construction back many months. The facility cost the City of Summerside approximately C$36 million, shared between the Municipal, Provincial, and Federal Governments. The venue hosted the first ever National Hockey League game in Prince Edward Island when the Florida Panthers played the New York Islanders on September 27, 2008. The Islanders won the game 4‚Äì2 in front of three thousand and twenty nine spectators.Associated Press game recap via ESPN.com The venue hosted the 2017 Kraft Hockeyville pre-season game between the Ottawa Senators and New Jersey Devils on September 25, 2017, with the Devils winning 8-1.

It is operated by the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board and has approximately 1,350 students. The school includes an Extended French Program as well as an Advanced Placement Program for Mathematics and the Sciences (Biology, Physics, Chemistry). The school building is similar to that of St. Joseph Secondary School in Mississauga, which was modelled after Philip Pocock. The school's athletes are called the \\"Pocock Pirates.\\" History The first Philip Pocock location opened in 1981 by the Dufferin-Peel Separate School Board and was at the site where John Cabot Catholic Secondary School is currently located. Then, due to an increasing student population, Philip Pocock's grade 11-13 students were temporarily located at Vincent Massey Collegiate Institute in Etobicoke, Ontario, from 1987 to 1992 until construction of the new, permanent third location was completed at the intersection of Tomken Road and Eglinton Avenue in Mississauga. This third and current location at Tomken and Eglinton opened in 1992. Presently, Massey became the Metropolitan Separate School Board (now the Toronto Catholic District School Board)'s Michael Power/St. Joseph High School campus in 1993. =Origins= Philip Francis Pocock was born in St. Thomas, Ontario, on July 2, 1906. He studied Theology at St. Peter's Seminary, London, and was ordained on June 14, 1930, by Bp. Denis P. O'Connor of Peterborough at St. Peter's Cathedral, London. In 1933, Father Pocock went to Rome for graduate studies and obtained the degree of Doctor of Canon Law. On April 7, 1944, he was appointed Bishop of Saskatoon. On June 16, 1951, Bp. Pocock was named Apostolic Administrator of Winnipeg, and on August 6 of the same year, Coadjutor Archbishop of Winnipeg. Abp. Pocock succeeded to the See as Archbishop on January 14, 1952. Due to Card. McGuigan's poor health, Abp. Pocock was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Toronto on February 18, 1961. He succeeded to the See of Toronto and became Archbishop upon Cardinal McGuigan's resignation on March 30, 1971. On April 29, 1978, Archbishop Pocock resigned the See of Toronto and took up residence at St. Mary's Parish, Brampton. He remained active as a priest, celebrating mass at elementary schools, confirming students, and visiting a senior citizens' home as well as performing his parish duties. He died on September 6, 1984, and was interred in Holy Cross Cemetery, Thornhill. =Athletics= The Philip Pocock Pirates compete locally in the Region of Peel Athletics Association (ROPSSAA) and provincially with OFSAA. Philip Pocock Athletics has a storied past with many ROPSSAA, DPAA, and TDCAA championships. Some of the notable championship teams include boys football, which have achieved 3 championships at both the junior and senior levels; Track and Field, which achieved overall ROPSSAA championships in 1999‚Äì2002; and girls rugby, which won ROPSSAA gold in 2008. =Feeder Schools= * St. Alfred Catholic Elementary School * St. Basil Catholic Elementary School * St. Sofia Catholic Elementary School (Ukrainian Catholic) * St. Thomas More Catholic Elementary School * Sts.

The original design of the Mall, from 1977 to 2007 The Portland Transit Mall is a public transit corridor that travels north‚Äìsouth through the center of downtown Portland, Oregon, United States. It encompasses a pair of one-way streets‚Äîone for northbound traffic, the other for southbound‚Äîalong which two of the three lanes are restricted to transit vehicles only. The transit mall opened in 1977 and until light rail trains were added in 2009, buses were the only transit vehicles using it. The mall was rebuilt and extended southwards from 2007 to 2009, and it reopened for buses on May 24, 2009. Light rail service on the mall was introduced on August 30, 2009, with the shifting of the MAX Yellow Line to the mall from its original routing in downtown, and a second MAX line, the Green Line, began serving the mall a month later on September 12. Between fall 2009 and July 2014, the Portland Vintage Trolley also served the transit mall on certain Sundays. Although the mall's stops are mainly served by TriMet vehicles, on weekdays buses on express routes operated by C-Tran and the Columbia County Rider also serve the mall. In September 2015, the new MAX Orange Line replaced the Yellow Line service in the southbound direction on the mall, on 5th Avenue, with the Orange and Yellow lines being through-routed at all times. History Interior of Portland Mall shelter in 1987, with a pay phone The Portland Transit Mall (formally named simply the Portland Mall) was constructed by TriMet, the Portland metropolitan area's regional transit agency, in 1976‚Äì77 and opened on December 11, 1977.\\"Mall makes it\\". (December 12, 1977). The Oregonian, p. A1.\\"Mall enters future - and it works!\\" (March 19, 1978). The Sunday Oregonian, p. M11. Excerpt: \\"Although the Portland Mall has [now] been officially dedicated, it has been in full operation since December.\\" It was formally dedicated in March 1978. The mall comprises 5th Avenue, for southbound buses, and 6th Avenue, for northbound buses, and when first opened it involved the sections of those streets extending from West Burnside Street to SW Madison Street: the central core of downtown. In June 1994, the mall was extended northward through Chinatown to Union Station (used by Amtrak) and the Greyhound bus depot.Oliver, Gordon (June 20, 1994). \\"More mall for all\\". The Oregonian, p. B1. Short, unconnected additions were made in the area around Portland State University in the early 2000s. TriMet's Fareless Square (renamed the \\"Free Rail Zone\\" in 2010) encompassed the entire mall until discontinued in 2012, and these two facilities/measures, among others, have contributed to TriMet's having become one of the nation's most successful and most-studied public transportation systems. Prior to its closure for rebuilding in 2007, the Portland Mall's design permitted private vehicle traffic to use the left lane, but only in short, two-block segments. In every third block, the lefthand (auto) lane disappeared for one block, and the otherwise three-lane-wide street became two lanes wide and restricted to buses only. In this way, two- thirds of the specific blocks along 5th Avenue and 6th Avenue remained open to cars, but use of those streets for through travel by cars was prohibited. Design and amenities The 1970s rebuilding of 5th and 6th avenues as transit-priority streets included several changes designed to create an environment that was more attractive and inviting to transit users and other pedestrians. Sidewalks were widened and repaved in brick, many additional trees were planted, new works of public art were commissioned and installed, and amenities such as benches and flower planters were added. The CCTV schedule-information monitors in each shelter, black-and-white until 1988, were considered groundbreaking in urban transit use when the mall opened. At each bus stop, a large new passenger shelter was installed. In addition to a pay telephone, every shelter was equipped with a closed-circuit television monitor giving riders information as to the next three departures on each bus route serving that particular stop.\\"Bus kiosks chock full of trip-planning aids\\" [headline is not referring to the shelters] (March 19, 1978). The Sunday Oregonian (Special Section), p. M6. This particular feature of the Portland Transit Mall was said to be a \\"first\\" for urban transit at the time (1977), having previously been used only in intercity transportation terminals, mainly airports.\\"Bus rider information system begins Sunday\\" (January 20, 1978). The Oregonian, p. C4. The information system came into use in January 1978. The monitors were originally black-and-white, but were replaced by color ones in 1988. Most bus routes serving downtown Portland followed the transit mall, but a few remained on so-called \\"cross-mall\\" routings, along east-west streets, originally Morrison and Yamhill streets but shifted to Washington and Salmon streets with the start of MAX construction in the early 1980s. Passengers boarding in 1993 at a stop marked by one of the eight \\"sector symbols\\" With regard to operations, the mall was designed with two bus stops in each block, or about one stop every . However, a bus operating on any given route only stopped at every fourth stop, i.e., every two blocks. TriMet adopted symbols and colors for each grouping of stops, so that bus riders could easily determine which particular stop locations were served by their routes.Graydon, Charlotte (March 19, 1978). \\"Tri-Met uses symbols to designate bus lines\\". The Sunday Oregonian, p. M7. The colors/symbols, which were marked by large signs at each stop and also shown on public schedules and maps, were as follows: Brown Beaver, Green Leaf, Yellow Rose, Orange Deer, Red Fish, Purple Raindrops and Blue Snowflake. They were also called \\"sector symbols\\", as each one corresponded to a particular sector of the city, e.g., the Rose being for routes serving Southwest Portland and the Fish for North Portland routes. When TriMet's first light rail line opened in 1986, use of the Snowflake symbol on the mall was discontinued, as all TriMet routes in that sector were curtailed to terminate at a light rail station, such as the Gateway Transit Center, and no longer traveled to downtown. Flower planters on the mall This operating configuration for the Portland Mall remained largely unchanged for 29 years, before the mall closed for rebuilding in early 2007. TriMet discontinued use of the distinctive graphic symbols used at mall stops at that time, but the symbols had already been relegated to secondary status in 2002, when they were replaced by purely geographic, letter designations such as N or NE (for North Portland or Northeast Portland) for each grouping. The graphic sector symbols were retained only at a greatly reduced size on the mall signs (much smaller in size than the new letter indications) and were no longer used at all in other TriMet media, such as the covers of bus schedules. They disappeared entirely in January 2007. Renovation and rebuilding A July 2007 photo, during the mall's 2007‚Äì09 rebuilding In 2004, it was decided to add MAX light rail to the transit mall, as TriMet's existing MAX routing through downtown was nearing its design capacity and another line (the Green Line) was being planned and was expected to be added to the system within a few years. Also, the mall was approaching three decades of use, and was in need of a heavy renovation. TriMet and transportation planners from the city and Metro studied how best to accommodate both buses and light rail on the mall. During this process, it was also decided, at the urging of the downtown business community, to reconfigure the mall's traffic lanes in such a way as to permit autos and other private traffic to use the left lane for the entire lengths of 5th and 6th avenues, a controversial decision. The project would also extend the mall south, from Madison Street all the way to the southern end of downtown and of Fareless Square, at the Stadium Freeway (I-405), thereby reaching Portland State University. The mall's southbound street, 5th Avenue, at Morrison Street in June 2009. The roof of the shelter at this bus stop had not yet been installed. The Portland Transit Mall temporarily closed for rebuilding on January 14, 2007. The work carried out over the next two years included the addition of light rail tracks and widening, to three lanes, all of the few south-of-Burnside sections which had previously been intentionally narrowed (by the original 1970s design) to two lanes and bus-only. During the lengthy closure, all bus routes using the mall were diverted to other streets, many to the nearby pair of 3rd Avenue (southbound) and 4th Avenue (northbound), where they had to share all traffic lanes with private vehicles but with parking temporarily removed at all of the new bus stops. Some routes were cut back to the southern part of downtown, making a loop along Columbia and Jefferson Streets. In 2007, local officials and businessmen expressed confidence that the renovation and extension of the transit mall would foster major new property redevelopment in downtown over the next several years. Bus service returned to the mall on May 24, 2009. Three months later, on August 30, 2009, MAX light rail began serving the mall, when the Yellow Line was shifted from its original (2004) downtown routing. On September 12, 2009, the new Green Line opened, and it serves the transit mall as well. Digital sign mounted in a shelter on the mall, giving real-time schedule information New shelter design introduced in 2009 In the new design, MAX stops are located every 4‚Äì5 blocks, and a bus (on a given route) also stops only every 4‚Äì5 blocks. Groupings of stops are marked by letters: A, B, C or D on 5th Avenue, and W, X, Y or Z on 6th Avenue. All of the few routes that were shortened slightly, to terminate in the southern part of downtown upon the mall's closure for rebuilding in 2007, have been permanently revised so as to no longer serve the mall, where replacement service is now being provided by light rail. The mall is currently served by 17 TriMet bus routes, six of which only operate in peak hours (at least on that part of their route). Only one 1977 shelter survived demolition; located near Southwest 5th and Salmon streets, it was spared as a reminder of the previous transit mall, later re- purposed as a concession stand. Although cars and trucks are now allowed to use the left lane for the entire length of the transit mall, they are‚Äîwith the exception of a very few locations‚Äînot permitted to turn right at any intersections. A motorist wanting to turn right from the transit mall must turn left, and make two additional left turns, to end up in the desired direction. This prevents cars' making right turns into the path of an oncoming bus or light rail car, which might be unable safely to stop in time to prevent a serious collision. Vintage Trolley service On September 13, 2009, the Sundays-only Portland Vintage Trolley service moved to the transit mall from a different route it had followed since 1991. The trolley cars served the full length of the mall, from Union Station to Portland State University. However, the Vintage Trolley service was discontinued in 2014, running for the last time on July 6 of that year. MAX Mall Shuttle The MAX Mall Shuttle was a service that operated from 2009 until 2011, weekday afternoons only. Introduced on September 14, 2009, it supplemented the light-rail service provided on the mall by the Yellow and Green lines and operated only between Union Station and PSU, about every 30 minutes on weekdays from noon until 5:30 p.m. TriMet discontinued this supplementary shuttle service effective June 5, 2011 (making Friday, June 3 the final day of operation). Along with bus service, the mall continues to be served by two MAX lines in each directionGreen and Yellow northbound and Green and Orange southboundwhich provide a combined average headway of 7.5 minutes in each direction at most times.

The installation was established in 1943 as a U.S. Army radio station, taking over and refurbishing a pre-existing Italian naval radio station, Radio Marina, after Italian forces based in Asmara surrendered to the Allies in 1941. Kagnew Station operated until April 29, 1977, when the last Americans left. The station was home to the United States Army's 4th Detachment of the Second Signal Service Battalion. Overview Kagnew Station The Cold War listening station, Kagnew Station, was located fairly close to the equator and at an altitude of above sea level. Its altitude and close proximity to the equator made Kagnew Station an ideal site for the Cold War listening station's dishes and the antenna farm. In all Kagnew sprawled over containing eight fenced or walled tracts. Kagnew Station became home for over 5,000 American citizens at a time during its peak years of operation during the 1960s. Fighting between the Ethiopian military and Eritrean resistance fighters forced the closing of military's Keren R & R Center, located in the city of Keren in 1971. The Massawa R&R; Center, located on the Red Sea, was closed shortly after the Keren R & R Center. The U.S. Army's 12 million dollar cost for maintaining their soldiers at Kagnew Station faced a budget axe in 1972 and the U.S. Army withdrew from Kagnew Station in 1973 but the Navy personnel remained. Fighting between the Eritrean resistance and the Ethiopian government forces began affecting operations at Kagnew Station in the 1970s. In March 1971, 3,500 Americans remained at Kagnew Station, 1,900 personnel (1,700 of whom were military) and 1,600 dependents. By July 18, 1972, U.S. personnel at Kagnew Station were reduced to 900 personnel. In March 1974, only 100 civilian technicians remained to operate the residual communications facility, along with their families, and eight to ten U.S. military personnel. On the night of January 31, 1975, heavy fighting broke out in Eritrea and incoming rocket-propelled grenades landed inside the Tract E compound. This began a season of frequent nighttime firefights between the Eritrean resistance and the Soviet-backed Ethiopian forces. On 14 July 1975, gunmen abducted two Americans and four Ethiopians from Kagnew Communications Station. The Americans, Steve Campbell and Jim Harrel, worked for Collins International Service Company (CISCO), a government contractor. On Friday 12 September 1975, the Eritrean Liberation Front, ELF, raided the US facility at Asmara, kidnapping a further eight people, including two Americans. On February 12, 1976 a meeting at the White House Situation Room took place discussing Kagnew Station. Lt. General Smith stated, \\"Right now fleet operations are dependent on Kagnew. The Navy has a strong interest in keeping it. They have reaffirmed to me that if they don't have Kagnew they would need a similar site elsewhere\\". At one point in the discussion, Mr. Noyes said, \\"Yes. If we didn't have Kagnew there would be communications delays 25% of the time. By December 1976 the only critical function appeared to be Mystic Star. In the same memorandum, the United States Department of Defense stated, \\"It recommends closing Kagnew by September 1977 if Mystic Star can be relocated\\". U.S. Department of State Department \\"Background Notes: State of Eritrea, March 1998,\\" stated, \\"In the 1970s, technological advances in the satellite and communications fields were making the communications station at Kagnew increasingly obsolete. Early in 1977, the United States informed the Ethiopian Government that it intended to close Kagnew Station by September 30, 1977. In the meantime, U.S. relations with the Mengistu regime were worsening. In April 1977, Mengistu abrogated the 1953 mutual defense treaty and ordered a reduction of U.S. personnel in Ethiopia, including the closure of Kagnew Communications Center and the consulate in Asmara\\". Not included in the report are the circumstances of the closing of Kagnew Station. In April, 1977, The Ethiopian Government closed the United States military installations and gave Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) personnel a week's notice to leave the country. A large store of equipment remained behind in the rapid American departure. Ethiopia then abrogated the 1953 United States-Ethiopian Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement and terminated the lease on Kagnew station. On April 29, 1977, the last Americans left Kagnew Station. History =Early history= In March 1941 Roosevelt administration declared Ethiopia eligible for the military aid program known as the Lend- Lease program. This was done to support the British troops in Libya and Egypt which were fighting Germany's Afrika Korps. The focus of the lend-lease program was in Eritrea, a former Italian colony which strategically bordered the Red Sea. British forces had established a communications base at the former Italian radio communications base named called Radio Marina, which was located in Asmara, Eritrea. The British used the former Italian name for the base, Radio Marina. The United States received access to the base from the British beginning in 1942. The United States would initially call the former Radio Marina the \\"Asmara Barracks,\\" but the name \\"Radio Marina\\" would become the more enduring name for the base until the base was officially named \\"Kagnew Station\\". In 1943 a seven-man detachment refurbished the former British facilities and began testing the new equipment they installed. Eritrea's geographical location; 15 degrees north of the equator at an altitude of , was excellent for sending and receiving radio signals. Early testing proved so promising that the War Department moved to expand operations before Asmara Barracks officially opened. On June 1, 1943, two officers, one warrant officer and 44 enlisted men began intensive training at Vint Hill Farms to man Radio Marina. In December, 4 officers and 50 enlisted men staffed Radio Marina, a base located on an arrowhead-shaped tract of land, designated as Tract A by the U.S. Military. While the United States had access to base since 1942, a formalized agreement to permit the United States use of the site did not exist until 1952 when the Ethiopian government, the federation of Eritrea and the United States signed an agreement. Kagnew Station Tract E: In 1953, the base officially acquired the name of Kagnew Station. The United States obtained from the Ethiopian government, a tract of land several city blocks to the west of Tract A, which it designated Tract E. In 1957 the activities and headquarters for Kagnew Station began moving to Tract E. Kagnew Station was officially dedicated in 1958 on Tract E. Kagnew Station was supplied by planes from the U.S. Airbase in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and by ships docking at the Red Sea port of Massawa. Its chapel had a seating capacity of 220 and an over-flow space to accommodate 150 more persons. The Guest House had eight rooms, a lobby and a kitchen, all made of concrete-block construction. The Roosevelt Theatre seated 320 patrons and was equipped with a CinemaScope screen and the latest sound and projection equipment. The gymnasium had a regulation basketball court with bleachers, retractable backboards and an electric scoreboard. It also housed ten bowling lanes, a boxing ring, gymnastic equipment, a locker room and shower rooms. The Dependent School had 17 classrooms, a large auditorium, science laboratory and library. A combined laundry-and-dry-cleaning plant could clean 50,000 pieces a month. KANU TV and KANU Radio provided television and radio services. Kagnew also had the usual Commissary, Post Exchange, snack bar and post office. The base Service Center included a music room, craft shop, photography darkroom, library and an auto shop. A football field, softball field and an indoor pool were also available. Children could play golf on the $22,000 miniature golf course; and adults played on the 18-hole golf course. Kagnew Farms, located northwest of Tract E, on the old Radio Marina Transmitter Site, became a recreation and picnic are known as Kagnew Farms until construction of STONEHOUSE at the same site in 1964. Kagnew Farms contained a skeet range, a small-bore rifle and pistol range, the Afro-American Racing Club's banked-dirt oval track (Used for car races, motorcycle scrambles and gherry cart races.), and a large picnic area. The military passed off Kagnew Station as a \\"telephone relay station\\" to disguise its real activities. The secret of Kagnew Station was kept not by hiding the equipment but by openly displaying the equipment and passing it off as something innocent: a telephone relay station and deep space research site. In 1964, an dish and a dish arrived in Massawa and were brought up the mountain in sections to Kagnew Station. The dishes were used at Stonehouse, the military's \\"Deep Space Research Site,\\" which was a joint project of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the Army Security Agency (ASA). Other agencies operating at Kagnew Station included the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Army Security Agency (ASA), the U.S. Strategic Communications Command (STRATCOM), the Navy Communications (NAVCOMM) and a signal research unit. Located on nearly the same longitude as the Soviet deep space command center in the Crimea, the large Stonehouse antennas were used to monitor telemetry from a variety of Russian spacecraft. As more personnel and dependants began to arrive in the 1960s a severe family housing shortage saw portions of Tract A, become a housing area. New apartment buildings replaced the older barracks buildings and football field. The United States spent 77 million dollars building Kagnew Station. In terms of 2006 dollars, Kagnew Station would have cost 495 million dollars to build. Tracts A through H: Kagnew Station consisted of eight (8) separate sections of land called tracts. Kagnew Station's tracts were designated by the letters A through H. Tract A is the old Italian Navy's Radio Marina site. \\"Radio Marina\\" translates to \\"Radio Navy\\". It is located within the city of Asmara. When the Italians were defeated by the English forces during World War II, Radio Marina became controlled by the British military administration until they left Eritrea. At that time the British handed off Radio Marina to the United States. While the United States had access to base since 1942, a formalized agreement to permit the United States use of the site did not exist until 1952 when the Ethiopian government, the federation of Eritrea and the United States signed an agreement. When construction had progressed enough on Tract E, Kagnew Station officially opened on Tract E in 1958. Tract A remained active and underwent changes in the following two decades including the former parade ground and ball field becoming dependent housing areas. Following the withdrawal from Kagnew Station by the U.S. military, Tract A by Mengistu Haile Mariam's troops and Tract A was then called Algen Camp. Tract B was the STRATCOM receiver site and was the site closest to the Asmara airport. Following the withdrawal from Tract B by U.S. Military forces the Tract B site was used as a prison. On May 19, 2004, Amnesty International reported, under the heading of \\"Secret Prisons in Eritrea\\" the existence of a secret prison on Tract B (also known as \\"Track B,\\" which they stated was located near the airport in Asmara. The prison was said to hold Eritrean People's Liberation Front veterans, conscripts, alleged armed Islamists, and people accused or forging identity documents or smuggling army deserters out of the country. Tract C was known as the Operations Site. It was located west of Tract E and its large antenna field was slangly referred to as \\"the funny farm\\". The site operated 24 hours a day. Operations on Tract C ceased March 24, 1972. Tract D was the STRATCOM transmitter site and was located near a dam. The dam by tract D blown up by shifta in mid-1972. Tract E was the Kagnew Station headquarters for the completely self-contained U.S. Cold War intelligence facility located in the isolated province of Eritrea, Ethiopia, (now the State of Eritrea). Kagnew Station was an oasis of luxury in the poverty stricken land of Eritrea. Tract E was supplied by aircraft from the U.S. Airbase in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and by ships docking at the Red Sea port of Massawa. Tract E's chapel had a seating capacity of 220 and an over- flow space to accommodate 150 more persons. The Guest House on Tract E had eight rooms, a lobby and a kitchen, all made of concrete-block construction. The Roosevelt Theatre seated 320 patrons and was equipped with a Cinemascope screen and the latest sound and projection equipment. The gymnasium on Tract E had a regulation basketball court with bleachers, retractable backboards and an electric scoreboard. It also housed ten bowling lanes, a boxing ring, gymnastic equipment, a locker room and shower rooms. The Dependent School inside Tract E had 17 classrooms, a large auditorium, science laboratory and library. Tract E contained a combined laundry-and-dry-cleaning plant the KANU Television and KANU Radio services, a Commissary, Post Exchange, snack bar and post office. The base Service Center included a music room, craft shop, photography darkroom, library and an auto shop. A football field, softball field and an indoor pool were also located inside the walls surrounding Tract E. Children played golf on a $22,000 miniature golf course and adults played golf on the 18-hole golf course. Tract F was the home of the Navy receiver site. Tract G was the home of the U.S. Army STRATCOM Satellite terminal at Gura. Tract H was the home of the Navy Transmitter site at Gura. Recreation: Recreation at Kagnew Station was available in many forms. In addition to on and off base recreation, Kagnew Station had R & R centers available for those serving at Kagnew Station and their dependants (wives and children). Kagnew Farms was located by Asmara and opened October 22, 1961 on the old Radio Marina transmitter site northwest of Tract E. Kagnew Farms contained a skeet range, a small-bore rifle and pistol range, the Afro-American Racing Club's banked-dirt oval track which was used for car races, motorcycle scrambles and gherry cart races. Kagnew Farms also contained a large picnic Area. In 1964 Kagnew Farms was over-taken by the construction of Stonehouse. The Keren (Cheren) R & R Center opened June 1959 and closed January 1971. The U.S. Army Massawa R & R Center, located in the C.I.A.A.O. Hotel, a hotel prefabricated in Italy and put together in Massawa in 1937, closed in 1963 for financial reasons. On November 4, 1967, the U.S. Army Red Sea Rest Center, opened in Massawa and was maintained by TTU (Transportation Terminal Unit). References  Further reading  * Wrong, Michaela. 2005.

The \\"Inner Sanctum\\" franchise originated with a popular radio series and all of the films star Lon Chaney, Jr.. The movie stars Chaney, Jr. and Patricia Morison, and was directed by Reginald Le Borg. Chaney, Jr. plays a neurologist, Dr. Mark Steele, who loses memory of the past few days after learning that his wife has been brutally murdered. Aware of his wife's infidelity and believing he could be the killer, Steele asks his office nurse Stella Madden to help him recover his lost memories. Plot A respected neurologist, Dr. Mark Steele (Lon Chaney, Jr.) treats his patients successfully with hypnosis, but has troubles of his own from a marriage falling apart, that he cannot treat himself in the same way. His wife Maria (Ramsay Ames) is cheating on him on a regular basis, which is something Mark is well aware of. When Maria returns home one night in the early morning hours after a rendez-vous with her lover, Mark finally tells her that he has had enough and that he wants a divorce. Maria, who is leading a very comfortable life as a doctor's wife, refuses her consent to a divorce, and laughs at him as she does so. That night Mark has a dream about strangling his wife to death. When Maria goes away for the weekend, Mark decides to leave and gets into his car and drives off. Come Monday morning he wakes up in his office only to learn that he is suffering a mental blackout and that the memories of the weekend is missing. He is informed by the police that his wife has been murdered, and that her face was disfigured by some kind of acid. Mark begins to worry about not remembering the slightest thing about his own actions during the weekend. His worries increase after finding a button from his own jacket near where his wife's body was found. He starts suspecting that he himself has done away with her. His nurse, Stella Madden (Patricia Morison) tells him not to air his suspicions to the police until he knows more. The police go on to arrest Maria's lover, an architect named Robert Duval (David Bruce), for the murder. Inspector Gregg (J. Carroll Naish), one of the detectives on the case still believes that Mark is the murderer. Duval's disabled wife (Fay Helm) pays Mark a visit, trying to convince him to help her prove that her husband is innocent. Duval is eventually convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. In a moment of guilt Mark gets the idea to hypnotize himself to find out if he really is the real murderer. The hypnosis, however, is not completed because inspector Gregg arrives and interrupts. Nurse Stella does make an audio recording of the session though, and on the audio Mark talks about meeting up with his wife at a cabin in the mountains. He also tells of having a quarrel with her and leaving the cabin just as Duval arrives, going straight to his office and sedating himself into deep sleep. Gregg listens to the recording, but still seems to suspect Mark of being the real murderer. Curious and craving for information Mark visits the incarcerated Duval and finds out that he borrowed $10,000 from Maria in order to pay off some gambling debts. After the visit Mark hears that Duval's request for pardoning has been denied by the governor. He talks to nurse Stella, who faints right in front of him in the office. Mark assumes that the nurse is beat from too much work. He suggests hiring another nurse as a secretary to handle the bills for the time being, and drives Stella to visit her family. Upon his return to the office Mark gets a visit from inspector Gregg. Mark is confronted with the fact that there's a connection between Mark's private clinic and the acid used on the face of his murdered wife. Mark realizes there might be more at stake than he first thought and decides to hypnotize Stella to see if she knows more than she is letting him believe. On the night of Duval's scheduled execution, with very little time left, Mark gets to hypnotize Stella. She tells him the truth about her plan together with Duval to get the $10,000 and that she killed Maria when Duval tried to give the money back. She also admits having tried to burn down the medical office, destroying numerous records, to cover the fact that she had been embezzling from him. Gregg overhears this and arrests Stella, explaining to Mark that he had never really suspected him but needed to gather evidence against Stella.Calling Dr. Death, Turner Classic Movies website; accessed June 8, 2016. Cast Cast is sourced from the book Universal Horrors. Production Gale Sondergaard (pictured) was considered for the role of Stella Madden but was replaced last minute by Patricia Morison. Calling Dr. Death was the first film in the \\"Inner Sanctum Mystery\\" series. In June 1943, Universal purchased the screen rights to the series from Simon and Schuster, Inc. who were publishers of the popular mystery novels and radio shows. Simon and Schuster were using the title Inner Sanctum for their series of mystery novels they had published published starting in the 1930s. The radio adaptations had initially started in January 1941 on the NBC Blue Network and was broadcast weekly. Ben Pivar of Universal sought out a suitable entry for the first film in the series, and purchased an original screenplay by freelance writer Edward Dein titled Calling Dr. Death. Dein has previously worked on various mystery films such as The Falcon, Lone Wolf and Boston Blackie series. Dein later reflected on his work at Universal, stating that he worked there \\"as a reader for a few weeks, which was another horror story. We called this the Snake Pit. In those days, we were not considered to be prolific writers; we were hacks.\\" The Inner Sanctum Mysteries feature a \\"stream of consciousness\\" voiceover which Dein stated he incorporated into his script at Lon Chaney, Jr.'s insistence. Dein stated that Chaney felt the dialogue was too technical and he couldn't say the words. LeBorg stated it was both Chaney and Pivar who suggested it, stating \\"Pivar was very, very crude, not very intelligent, and he couldn't read very well.\\" Lon Chaney, Jr. was hopeful for the series, craving diversity in his roles after Universal had placed him in various monster roles in their horror films. Pivar planned to produced two Inner Sanctum mystery films a year with each film featuring Chaney and Gale Sondergaard in the lead roles. Director Reginald LeBorg was chosen by Pivar to direct the film, with LeBorg recalling that \\"Pivar had confidence in me because I was a fighter who tried to get better and better material.\\" Just before filming was set to be begin, Sondergarrd was dropped from the cast and her role was rewritten and given to Patricia Morison. LeBorg speculated that Sondergaard was dropped from the film as \\"she was a leftist and she and her husband [Herbert J. Biberman] were shooting their mouths off quite often.\\" Calling Dr. Death went into production on October 25, 1943 and was finished filming in 20 days. Patrica Morison recalled working on the film with Chaney, stating she \\"didn't get to know him terribly well - he was a rather shy man, but I enjoyed working with him very much. He was very nice to me.\\" Release Calling Dr. Death was distributed by Universal on December 17, 1943. The film was followed by the second Inner Sanctum film that was also directed by LeBorg, titled Weird Woman. It was released on April 14, 1944. Reception From contemporary reviews, A. H. Weiler wrote in The New York Times that the film was \\"mildly interesting but not thrilling. [I]t has a dreary habit of talking itself out of promising situations\\" and that Chaney's voice-overs dissipated the suspense. Dorothy Masters of The New York Daily News opined that if \\"Reginald LeBorg been as masterful with his cast as he was with the script, Calling Dr. Death could have been a most promising introduction to Universal's new \\"Inner Sanctum\\" series\\" and concluded that the film was \\"good enough for everyday consumption, and likely to encourage an appreciable following.\\" The Hollywood Reporter found LeBorg's direction was \\"filled with imaginative touches and extracts a maximum of susespense from the psychological plot\\" and that Chaney \\"gives an arresting portrayal of the doctor.\\" From retrospective reviews, the authors of the book Universal Horrors declared the series \\"feeble melodramas with little to recommend them beyond their camp qualities and the morose spectacle of seeing a badly miscast Chaney struggle his way through acting assignments that were painfully beyond his depth.\\" They concluded that the series were \\"generally regarded by buffs and film historians as a missed cinematic opportunity.\\" References =Footnotes= =Sources= * External links  * Category:1943 films Category:1943 mystery films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films based on radio series Category:Films directed by Reginald Le Borg Category:Medical-themed films Category:American mystery films ","title":"Calling Dr. Death"},{"id":"9803142","text":"Thomas Thacher (May 3, 1850 ‚Äì July 30, 1919) was an American lawyer. Life Thacher was a descendant of the Rev. Peter Thacher, the rector of St. Edmonds, Salisbury, England; and of his son, Thomas Thacher, who came to America in 1635, settled in Salem, Massachusetts, and later became the first minister of the Old South Church in Boston. His father, Thomas Anthony Thacher, LL D. (Yale BA 1835), was professor of Latin at Yale College from 1842 to 1886, and his mother, Elizabeth (Day) Thacher, was the daughter of Jeremiah Day (Yale BA 1795), president of Yale from 1817 to 1846, and Olivia (Jones) Day. On his mother's side he traced his ancestry to Robert Day, who emigrated from Ipswich, England in 1634, settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in a few years removed to Connecticut and helped to found Hartford. Thomas Thacher prepared for college at the Hopkins Grammar School. He received a first prize for declamation in Sophomore year. His appointments were a high oration in Junior year and an oration in Senior year. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Skull and Bones, and Brothers in Unity. After graduation he taught for a year in the Hopkins Grammar School, and then spent a year in graduate study at Yale University. He entered the Columbia Law School in 1873, and was graduated with the degree of LL.B. in 1875, immediately upon graduation being admitted to the bar of New York, of which he became an active and influential member. His first professional association was with Ashbel Green, then one of the leaders of the New York Bar, with whom he collaborated in the preparation of Brice's Ultra Vires, which became a standard American work on corporation law. After completing this work he was associated with Judge Green in the office of Alexander & Green, and later served as attorney for one of the largest mortgage companies in New York City. On January 1, 1884, he formed the firm of Simpson, Thacher & Barnum (now Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett), with John W. Simpson and William M. Barnum (B A. 1877) as partners. In this, and its successor firms, he was an active partner until his death. Among his partners were Philip G. Bartlett, Yale 1881; his brother, Alfred Beaumont Thacher, Yale 1874; Charles B. Eddy, Yale 1893; Graham Sumner, Yale 1897; Reeve Schley, Yale 1903; and his son, Thomas Day Thacher, Yale 1904. During his forty-five years of active practice at the bar, the economic life of the country was undergoing a great transformation in the rapid development of production on a large scale. In preparing the structure of the new business organization Mr. Thacher had no small part, performing as he did, much of the legal work in connection with the organization of the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the American Smelting & Refining Company, the Republic Iron & Steel Company, the American Sheet Steel Company, the American Steel Hoop Company, the American Can Company, the American Locomotive Company, the Railway Steel-Spring Company, and other large consolidations. He combined with such activities the work of a court lawyer, and often appeared before the courts in cases of importance. He was actively interested in the Bar Association of New York City, and for two years (1907‚Äì09) was its vice-president. From 1887 to 1914, Mr. Thacher was a lecturer on corporations in the Yale School of Law. He was a frequent contributor to the law reviews. At the Yale Bicentennial, he was chosen to deliver the address on \\"Yale in Relation to Law.\\" In 1903 Yale conferred upon him the degree of LL. D. He served as president of the Yale Alumni Association in New York from 1895 to 1897 and from that time until 1904 as president of the Yale Club of New York City. At the time of his death he was an honorary member of the club. He was one of the founders of the Yale Alumni University Fund and gave himself enthusiastically to the work of the Alumni Fund Association, of which he was chairman from 1894 to 1897 and a director for many years. From 1906 until his death he was a member of the Alumni Advisory Board. Mr. Thacher was married December 1, 1880, in New York City, to Sarah McCullough, daughter of Ashbel and Louise B. (Walker) Green, of Tenafly, who survives him with a son, Thomas Day Thacher (Yale BA 1904), and three daughters.

The organization serves the youth residing in the Baltimore- Washington Metropolitan Area. The organization focuses its efforts on its two primary youth-centered missions: positive recreational opportunities and educational enhancement and support.  History  The organization was founded in December 2005. It received its 501(c)(3) exemption in January 2006. The organization's first year of business solely entailed recreational activities for the area youth. In January 2007 The Twenty-Twenty Corporation joined the Maryland Association of Nonprofit Organizations (MD Nonprofits).MANO  Organization  The Twenty-Twenty Corporation is organized into five divisions of appointed staff and two elected offices, the Office of the President and the Board of Trustees. The Office of the President includes the President/Chief Executive Officer, the Public Policy Liaison, the Secretary and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees (who also serves on the Board of Trustees). With the exception of the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, none of the elected officials have voting powers. The Board of Trustees has nine elected officials. Trustees are elected by the Corporate Members. Members of the Corporation are divided into two categories: Corporate Members and Members. Corporate Members are those donors in the top 75th percentile, based on accumulated donations and who have a vested interest in the organization. Corporate members are allowed to participate in nominations and elections, present and organize events (with Corporate endorsements), participate on special committees, represent the Corporation at certain events (with Presidential endorsements) and authorize/sponsor the participation of any otherwise unqualified individual in any Corporate program. Members are the participants, in general, of the organization's programs. Members do not have voting or sponsoring power, but are recognized as regular participants in programs and are entitled to preferential access to such programs.  Recreational opportunities  Originally, the Corporation's mission was solely to provide positive activities for area youth to have the opportunity to engage in. The founder's premise was that time spent enjoying the events offered by the organization would be well invested in positive activities and not in negative and delinquent behavior. Thus, the backbone of The Twenty- Twenty Corporation's operations focuses on providing recreational activities to the youth. Many of the activities are organized based on inquiries and requests from the youth consensus. All activities are offered at no cost to the attendees.  Educational enhancement and support  The organization manages a tutoring program which focuses on educational support. The STRIKE (Supplemental Training Remedies and Individual Knowledge Enhancement) Program is designed to provide free, effective tutoring services to the membership base served. Since its inception the tutoring services have been provided at no cost to the student. Students must be enrolled in a primary or secondary school in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and their performance should be deemed to be in need of assistance by the Board of Trustees. Tutors evaluate the needs of the students and organize tutoring sessions to accommodate the student's academic needs, the guardian's transportation capabilities and the organization's capacity to provide quality services to a number of students. The STRIKE Program's Goals and Vision The Twenty-Twenty Corporation's investment is in the early education and empowerment of the Baltimore-Washington community. The organization seeks to deter the desire to drop out of school, increase the students' understanding of each subject matter, inculcate the seriousness of a basic secondary education in the student and encourage college as a continuation of education. Tutors offer one-on-one attention to the student to help supplement the concepts learned in school. Many people utilize tutoring services to brush up on concepts that they may have forgotten over time, to better understand concepts that they find to be more difficult than others, or to help prepare themselves for an important exam that is forthcoming.GuideStar nonprofit reports and Forms 990 for donors, grantmakers and businesses  Other missions  The Greatest Gift Program is an incentive for area youth to receive a gift for any occasion at no cost to them. Youth are required to have attended at least two of the Corporation's events, complete a short application and a 500 word essay on a pre-selected topic.

Hazard, Jr. ‚Ä¢ Penn LawFormer Yale SOM Dean Geoffrey Hazard Dies  Yale School of Management was Trustee Professor of Law Emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he taught from 1994 to 2005, and the Thomas E. Miller Distinguished Professor of Law Emeritus at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law. He was also Sterling Professor Emeritus of Law at Yale Law School. Biography Hazard was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Kirkwood, Missouri. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Swarthmore College with a B.A. in 1953, and received his LL.B. in 1954 from Columbia Law School, where he was Reviews Editor of the Columbia Law Review. Hazard was Trustee Professor of Law Emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he taught from 1994 to 2005. From 1984 until 1999, Hazard served as Director of the American Law Institute (ALI). In that capacity, he was responsible for supervising the launch of the third series of the Restatements of the Law, which continues to the present. He has been credited by ALI with coming up with the idea of breaking up the larger Restatements (Torts and Property) into smaller pieces to be analyzed one at a time in Restatement Third. As Director Emeritus, he continued to serve on the Institute's council. Hazard was a leading expert in the fields of civil procedure and legal ethics. His treatise, Civil Procedure (5th ed. 2001, with Fleming James Jr. and John Leubsdorf), is a mainstay of American legal education. He continued to write prodigiously including the ALI/UNIDROIT Principles of Transnational Civil Procedure which upon approval by the sponsoring organizations has become a model of civil procedure for international commercial disputes, and many articles, particularly on joinder, including class actions, and discovery. His casebook, Pleading and Procedure: State and Federal (9th ed. 2005, with Colin Tait, William A. Fletcher and Stephen Bundy), is widely used in American law schools. In professional ethics, his book, Legal Ethics: A Comparative Study (with Angelo Dondi) compares ethics in the legal professions of modern industrialized countries. He is also author of The Law of Lawyering (3rd ed. 2000, with William Hodes, and, after 2007, Peter R. Jarvis), a treatise on legal ethics that is updated annually. He often acted as an expert witness in both fields. Among Hazard's better-known students is current US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. Alito also worked as Hazard's research assistant when he taught at Yale. He taught at U.C. Berkeley's Boalt Hall and at the University of Chicago Law School. From 1980 to 1981 he also served as the 2nd Dean of the Yale School of Management, succeeding the former SEC Chairman and US Under Secretary of State, Bill Donaldson who was the inaugural Dean.PepsiCo Chairman & CEO Indra K.

Achi Chokyi Drolma is the grandmother of Jigten Sumg√∂n, the founder of Drikung Kagyu. She also appears as a protector in the Karma Kagyu refuge tree as Achi Chodron and is a dharmapƒÅla and dakini in the life story of the Nyingma tert√∂n Tsasum Lingpa ().  Prophecy  According to a prophecy in the Cakrasa·πÉvara Tantra, it is said, \\"The head of the Karma Dakinis will come to the area of Tidro cave in Drikung. This will be a nirmanakaya manifestation of Vajrayogini\\".  Birth  Around the eleventh century in Shoto in the area of Drikung (√ú-Tsang), there lived a family who could not conceive a child. In order to bear a child they made a pilgrimage to Swayambhu in Nepal. They prayed fervently for a child and one night the woman, Driza Dharzam, had a dream that a brightly shining sun appeared in the east and radiated light in the ten directions and the sun then dissolved into her womb and radiated light which filled the whole universe, especially illuminating the country of her birth. In the same night, her husband Nanam Chowopal had a dream that a rosary of clear white light emanated from the eastern Buddha field and entered the womb of his wife. In the morning they discussed their dreams and he said, 'a special son will be born to us and we should take much care until this child is born.' They performed a ganachakra offering; made strong prayers for the fulfillment of their wishes and then returned to their native land in Drikung. The time came for the birth and an extraordinary daughter was born in the place called Kyetrag Thang. There were numerous auspicious signs and her body was of purest white and radiating rays of light. As a small child she was always reciting the mantra of Tara and at the age of three she was teaching the mantra to others. She grew quickly and was incredibly beautiful. Her parents died when she was quite young and she then stayed with her uncle.  Young adulthood  Many wanted to marry her but she refused all stating, 'I will go to Kham and there lives a great yogi who is descended from the noble clan of the Kyura race. This yogi I will marry and our sons and daughters and future generations will be extraordinary persons who will benefit all sentient beings by spreading the essence of the Buddha's teachings.' Then accompanying a merchant, she traveled to Kham. They arrived at a place called Dentod Tsonrur and she said to her companion, 'This is the place I have to stay.' She departed and went to meet the great saint Ame Tsultrim Gyatso to whom she said, 'Although I have no attachment to the worldly life, if we join together our descendants will bear many enlightened beings who will do great benefit for the teachings of the Buddha.' On their marriage day, Ame Tsultrim Gyatso did not have any possessions to arrange for the ceremony. Drolma said, 'Do not worry, I will take care of it.' So saying she miraculously pulled a damaru from her right pocket and a kapala from her left. Then beating the damaru and holding the kapala in her hand she made a mystic dance while gazing into the sky. Immediately the house was filled with the finest food and drink and the richest garments with which to clothe themselves - thus giving great satisfaction and pleasure to all the guests. They lived together and in time she gave birth to four sons: Namkhe Wangchuk, Pekar Wangyal, Sonam Pal and Kathung Trushi. These sons were exceptionally intelligent and became scholars on both the temporal and spiritual levels. Of her four sons, Pekar Wangyal fathered four sons. They were Khenpo Dharma, Konchog Rinchen, Tsunpo Bar and Naljor Dorje - of these four, Naljor Dorje became the father of the great Ratnashri Jigten Sumgon, the great Drikungpa, who was the reincarnation of Nagarjuna.  Death  At a later time Drolma said, 'I have knowingly taken birth into samsara in order to fulfill my aspirations to protect the teachings of the Buddha and for the welfare of all sentient beings. Because of this, I will grant the ordinary and supreme siddhis to my followers. She led her followers to a huge cave called Tingring. The cave was very sacred, containing many precious termas and many self- created statues of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, Yidams, Dakinis, and Dharma Protectors on the rocks inside the cave. A human corpse was brought and she transformed that corpse into a great tsog offering. Those who could partake of that tsog were granted the ordinary and supreme siddhis. Then she composed a text containing a sadhana of herself and promised to look after the teachings of the Buddha in general and to protect the essence of the Buddha's teaching that will appear in the future. With that she said, 'My activities through this body have come to an end,' and she flew up to the Buddha Field on her blue horse without leaving her body.\\" See also *Tibetan Buddhism References *https://web.archive.org/web/20070219004055/http://home.swipnet.se/ratnashri/Achi.htm *http://www.turtlehill.org/khen/tsa.html *http://www.dharmadownload.net/pages/english/Natsok/0003_lineage/001_RefugeTree/001_natsok_0003.htm *http://www.himalayanart.org/image.cfm/73896.html Category:Drikung Kagyu Category:Dharmapalas Category:Female buddhas and supernatural beings ","title":"Achi Chokyi Drolma"},{"id":"9803274","text":"Pesotum Township is a township in Champaign County, Illinois, USA.

The website was established in 2006 by American homeschool teacher and attorney Andrew Schlafly, son of the conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, to counter what he perceived as a liberal bias in Wikipedia. It uses editorials and a wiki-based system for content generation. Examples of Conservapedia's ideology include its accusations against and strong criticism of former US President Barack Obama‚Äîincluding belief in Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories‚Äîalong with open criticisms of atheism, homosexuality, the Democratic Party, and evolution. Furthermore, it views the theory of relativity as promoting moral relativism, claims that abortion increases risk of breast cancer, praises a number of Republican politicians, supports celebrities and artistic works that it believes represent moral standards in line with Christian family values, and accepts fundamentalist Christian doctrines such as Young Earth creationism. Conservapedia's \\"Conservative Bible Project\\" is a crowd-sourced retranslation of the English- language Bible which Conservapedia claims will be \\"free of corruption by liberal untruths\\". The site has received negative reactions from the mainstream media, as well as from prominent political figures, and has been criticized by liberal and conservative critics alike for bias and inaccuracies. As of September 2020, Conservapedia has approximately 50,100 articles.  Background  Conservapedia founder Andrew Schlafly Conservapedia was created in November 2006 by Andrew Schlafly, a Harvard and Princeton- educated attorney and a homeschool advocate. He started the project after reading a student's assignment written using the Common Era notation rather than Anno Domini. Although Schlafly was \\"an early Wikipedia enthusiast,\\" as reported by Shawn Zeller of Congressional Quarterly, Schlafly became concerned about bias after Wikipedia editors repeatedly undid his edits to the article about the 2005 Kansas evolution hearings. Schlafly expressed hope that Conservapedia would become a general resource for American educators and a counterpoint to the liberal bias that he perceived in Wikipedia. The \\"Eagle Forum University\\" online education program, which is associated with Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum organization, uses material for various online courses, including U.S. history, stored on Conservapedia. Editing of Conservapedia articles related to a particular course topic is also a certain assignment for Eagle Forum University students. Running on MediaWiki software, the site was founded in 2006, with its earliest articles dating from November 22. By January 2012, Conservapedia contained over 38,000 pages, not counting pages intended for internal discussion and collaboration, minimal \\"stub\\" articles, and other miscellany. Regular features on the front page of Conservapedia include links to news articles and blogs that the site's editors consider relevant to conservatism. Editors of Conservapedia also maintain a page titled \\"Examples of Bias in Wikipedia\\" that compiles alleged instances of bias or errors on Wikipedia pages. It was, at one point, the most-viewed page on the site.  Editorial viewpoints and policies  Conservapedia has editorial policies designed to prevent vandalism and what Schlafly sees as liberal bias. According to The Australian, although the site's operators claim that the site \\"strives to keep its articles concise, informative, family-friendly, and true to the facts, which often back up conservative ideas more than liberal ones\\", on Conservapedia‚Äôs \\"arguments are often circular\\" and \\"contradictions, self- serving rationalizations and hypocrisies abound.\\" = Comparison to Wikipedia = Shortly after its launch in 2006, Schlafly described the site as being competition for Wikipedia, saying \\"Wikipedia has gone the way of CBS News. It's long overdue to have competition like Fox News.\\" Many editorial practices of Conservapedia differ from those of Wikipedia. Articles and other content on the site frequently include criticism of Wikipedia as well as criticism of its alleged liberal ideology. Launching the online encyclopedia project, Schlafly asserted the need for an alternative to Wikipedia due to editorial philosophy conflicts. The site's \\"Conservapedia Commandments\\" differ from Wikipedia's editorial policies. Wikipedia's policies include following a neutral point of view and avoiding original research. In response to Wikipedia's core policy of neutrality, Schlafly has stated: \\"It's impossible for an encyclopedia to be neutral. I mean let's take a point of view, let's disclose that point of view to the reader\\", and \\"Wikipedia does not poll the views of its editors and administrators. They make no effort to retain balance. It ends up having all the neutrality of a lynch mob\\". In a March 2007 interview with The Guardian, Schlafly stated, \\"I've tried editing Wikipedia, and found it and the biased editors who dominate it censor or change facts to suit their views. In one case my factual edits were removed within 60 seconds‚Äîso editing Wikipedia is no longer a viable approach\\". On March 7, 2007, Schlafly was interviewed on BBC Radio 4's flagship morning show, Today, opposite Wikipedia administrator Jim Redmond. Schlafly argued that the article on the Renaissance does not give sufficient credit to Christianity, that Wikipedia articles apparently prefer to use non-American spellings even though most users are American, that the article on American activities in the Philippines has a distinctly anti- American bias, and that attempts to include pro-Christian or pro-American views are removed very quickly. Schlafly also claimed that Wikipedia's allowance of both Common Era and Anno Domini notation was anti-Christian bias. = Licensing of content = Conservapedia allows users to \\"use any of the content on this site with or without attribution.\\" The copyright policy also states, \\"This license is revocable only in very rare instances of self- defense, such as protecting continued use by Conservapedia editors or other licensees.\\" It also does not permit \\"unauthorized mirroring\\". Wikipedia co- founder Jimmy Wales has raised concerns about the fact that the project is not licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) or a similar copyleft license, stating that \\"[p]eople who contribute [to Conservapedia] are giving them full control of the content, which may lead to unpleasant results.\\" = Vandalism = The site has stated that it prohibits unregistered users from editing entries due to concerns over vandalism, disruption or defamation. Brian Macdonald, a Conservapedia editor, commented that vandalism was intended to \\"cause people to say, 'That Conservapedia is just wacko.'\\" According to Stephanie Simon of the Los Angeles Times, Macdonald spent many hours every day reverting \\"malicious editing\\". Vandals had inserted \\"errors, pornographic photos and satire\\". For example, U.S. Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales was said to be \\"a strong supporter of torture as a law enforcement tool for use against Democrats and third world inhabitants\\". = Other editorial policies = Conservapedia states on its \\"Manual of Style\\" page that \\"American English spellings are preferred but Commonwealth spellings, for de novo or otherwise well-maintained articles are welcome.\\" It prefers that articles about the United Kingdom use British English, while articles about the United States use American English, to resolve editorial disputes. Initially, Schlafly and other Conservapedia editors considered Wikipedia's policy allowing British English spelling to be anti-American bias. The \\"Conservapedia Commandments\\" require edits to be \\"family-friendly, clean, concise, and without gossip or foul language\\" and that users make most edits on the site quality edits to articles. Accounts that engage in what it considers \\"unproductive activity, such as 90% talk and only 10% quality edits\\" may be blocked. The commandments also cite the United States Code at 18 USC ¬ß 1470 as justification for legal action against edits that contain obscenities or are vandalism or spam.\\"Conservapedia Commandments , Conservapedia (21 March 2007) Conservapedia policies encourage its users to choose usernames \\"based on [their] real name or initials\\", and users that have usernames deemed \\"frivolous\\" by the admins are blocked; one of the site's criticisms of Wikipedia is \\"silly administrator names\\", which is claimed to reflect Wikipedia's \\"substantial anti-intellectual element\\". Because of Schlafly's claim that Wikipedia's allowance of both Common Era and Anno Domini notation is anti-Christian bias, the commandments disallow use of the former.  Conflict with scientific views  Various Conservapedia articles contradict established science. On March 19, 2007, the British free newspaper Metro ran the article \\"Weird, wild wiki on which anything goes\\", articulating the dismissal of Conservapedia by the Royal Society, saying \\"People need to be very careful about where they look for scientific information\\". A Los Angeles Times journalist noted Conservapedia's critics voiced concern that children stumbling on the site may assume Conservapedia's scientific content is accurate. = Creation = Although not all Conservapedia contributors subscribe to a young-Earth creationist point of view ‚Äî the late administrator Terry Koeckritz stated to the Los Angeles Times that he did not take the Genesis creation account literally ‚Äî sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the young-Earth creationist perspective and an over-reliance on Christian creationist home-schooling textbooks. In an analysis in early 2007, science writer Carl Zimmer found evidence that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile. = Evolution = Conservapedia's article on evolution presents it as a naturalistic theory that lacks support and that conflicts with evidence in the fossil record that creationists perceive to support creationism. The entry also suggests that sometimes the Bible has been more scientifically correct than the scientific community. Schlafly has defended the statement as presenting an alternative to evolution. Furthermore, the encyclopedia rejects the idea of creationist and evolutionary concepts being compatible with one another, as in theistic evolution (to which even Charles Darwin was open) or Old Earth creationism. = Environmentalism = Conservapedia has described global warming as a \\"liberal hoax\\". An article on the \\"Pacific Northwest Arboreal Octopus\\" received particular attention, although Schlafly asserted that it was intended as a parody of environmentalism. By March 4, 2007, the entry had been deleted. = Abortion = Conservapedia asserts that induced abortion increases the risk of breast cancer, while the scientific consensus is that the best studies indicate no such association. = Relativity = Conservapedia has also been criticised for its articles regarding the theory of relativity, particularly on their entry titled \\"Counterexamples to relativity\\" which lists examples purportedly demonstrating that the theory is incorrect. Attention was drawn to the article by a Talking Points Memo posting that reported on Conservapedia's entry and stated that Andy Schlafly, Conservapedia's founder, \\"has found one more liberal plot: the theory of relativity\\". New Scientist, a science magazine, criticized Conservapedia's views on relativity and responded to several of Conservapedia's arguments against it. Against Conservapedia's statements, New Scientist stated that, while one is unlikely to find a single physicist who would claim that the theory of general relativity is the whole answer to how the universe works, the theory has passed every test to which it has been subjected. University of Maryland physics professor Robert L. Park has also criticized Conservapedia's entry on the theory of relativity, arguing that its criticism of the principle as \\"heavily promoted by liberals who like its encouragement of relativism and its tendency to mislead people in how they view the world\\" confuses a physical theory with a moral value.Park, Robert L. \\"Conservapedia: Countering the Liberal Bias of Wikipedia\\" . BobPark.org; August 13, 2010. Similarly, New Scientist stated at the end of their article that: In October 2010, Scientific American criticized Conservapedia's attitude towards the Theory of Relativity, assigning them a zero score on their 0 to 100 fallacy-versus-fact \\"Science Index\\", describing Conservapedia as \\"the online encyclopedia run by conservative lawyer Andrew Schlafly, [which] implies that Einstein's theory of relativity is part of a liberal plot.\\"Scientific American, October 2010, issue, \\"Science Index\\", Page 22 Another claim is that \\"Albert Einstein's work had nothing to do with the development of the atomic bomb\\", and that Einstein was only a minor contributor to the theory of relativity.  Ideology  The Guardian has referred to Conservapedia's politics as \\"right-wing\\", although it is sometimes described as far-right or New Right.Walker, Clarence Earl, and George Smithers. The preacher and the politician: Jeremiah Wright, Barack Obama, and race in America. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2009. \\"Those who express this view are on the far right of American politics (Though they often describe themselves as defenders of 'traditional' American Values). The Website Conservapedia for example ...\\"Stecker, Frederick. The Podium, the Pulpit, and the Republicans: How Presidential Candidates Use Religious Language in American Political Debate. ABC-CLIO, 2011 = Liberalism = Many Conservapedia articles criticise values that its editors associate with \\"liberal ideology\\". The article \\"Liberal\\" once began with text originating from Schlafly personally: \\"A liberal (also leftist) is someone who rejects logical and biblical standards, often for self-centered reasons. There are no coherent liberal standards; often a liberal is merely someone who craves attention, and who uses many words to say nothing.\\" Leonard Pitts quoted it in a critical comment saying \\"You may judge Conservapedia's own bias by reading its definition of liberal\\". The opening text has since been changed and now features claims that all politically liberal Americans favor increased government intervention, oppose religion, support same-sex marriage and a welfare state, and believe in conspiracy theories. = Partisan politics = Schlafly said in an interview with National Public Radio that Wikipedia's article on the history of the Democratic Party is an \\"attempt to legitimize the modern Democratic Party by going back to Thomas Jefferson\\" and that this statement is \\"specious and worth criticizing\\". He also has claimed that Wikipedia is \\"six times more liberal than the American public\\", a claim that has been labeled \\"sensational\\" by Andrew Chung of the Toronto Star. John Cotey of the St. Petersburg Times observed that the Conservapedia article about the Democratic Party contained a criticism about the party's alleged support for same-sex marriage, and associated the party with the homosexual agenda. The Conservapedia entries on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama are critical of their respective subjects. During the 2008 presidential campaign, its entry on Obama asserted that he \\"has no clear personal achievement that cannot be explained as the likely result of affirmative action\\". Some Conservapedia editors urged that the statement be changed or deleted, but Schlafly, a classmate of Obama, responded by asserting that the Harvard Law Review, the Harvard University legal journal for which Obama and Schlafly worked together,Harvard Law Review Board of Editors, Volume 104, 1990‚Äì1991 , Group photo; A. Schlafly is second row from the top, second from left; B. Obama is in the third row from top, 7th from left. Retrieved from Harvard University Library Visual Information Access, August 10, 2011. See also Harvard Law Review#Alumni. uses racial quotas and stated: \\"The statement about affirmative action is accurate and will remain in the entry\\". In addition, Hugh Muir of The Guardian mockingly referred to Conservapedia's assertion that Obama has links to radical Islam as \\"dynamite\\" and an excellent resource for \\"US rightwingers\\". In contrast, the articles about conservative politicians, such as former U.S. Republican president Ronald Reagan and former British Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, have been observed as praising their respective subjects. Mark Sabbatini of the Juneau Empire considered the Conservapedia entry on Sarah Palin, the Republican vice- presidential candidate for the 2008 U.S. presidential election, a \\"kinder, gentler\\" and \\"far shorter and less controversial\\" reference for one wishing to learn about Palin in contrast with the corresponding Wikipedia entry, which Sabbatini found to be plagued by disputes over inclusion of potentially controversial details about her life. = Atheism = In July 2008, American Prospect associate editor Ezra Klein derided the Conservapedia article on atheism in his weekly column: \\"As Daniel DeGroot notes, you've got to wonder which 'unreasonable' explanations they rejected when formulating that entry\\". The website sometimes adopts a strongly critical stance against figures that it perceives as political, religious, or ideological opponents. For instance, in May 2009, Vanity Fair and The Spectator reported that Conservapedia's article on atheist Richard Dawkins featured a picture of Adolf Hitler at the top. The picture was later moved to a lower position in the article.  Reception  The Conservapedia project has come under significant criticism for numerous factual inaccuracies and factual relativism. Wired magazine noted that Conservapedia was \\"attracting lots of derisive comments on blogs and a growing number of phony articles written by mischief makers\\". Iain Thomson in Information World Review wrote that \\"leftist subversives\\" may have been creating deliberate parody entries. Conservapedia has been compared to CreationWiki, a wiki written from a creationist perspective, and Theopedia, a wiki with a Reformed theology focus. Fox News obliquely compared it with other new conservative websites competing with mainstream ones, such as MyChurch, a Christian version of social networking site MySpace, and GodTube, a Christian version of video site YouTube. Tom Flanagan, a conservative professor of political science at the University of Calgary, has argued that Conservapedia is more about religion, specifically Christianity, than political or social conservatism and that it \\"is far more guilty of the crime they're attributing to Wikipedia\\" than Wikipedia itself. Matt Millham of the military-oriented newspaper Stars and Stripes called Conservapedia \\"a Web site that caters mostly to evangelical Christians\\". Its scope as an encyclopedia, according to its founders, \\"offers a historical record from a Christian and conservative perspective\\". APC magazine perceives this to be representative of Conservapedia's own problem with bias. Conservative Christian commentator Rod Dreher has been highly critical of the website's \\"Conservative Bible Project\\", an ongoing retranslation of the Bible which Dreher attributes to \\"insane hubris\\" on the part of \\"right-wing ideologues\\". The project has also been criticized for promoting a false dichotomy between conservatism and liberalism and for promoting relativism with the implicit idea that there \\"often are two equally valid interpretations of the facts\\". Matthew Sheffield, writing in the conservative daily newspaper The Washington Times, argued that conservatives concerned about bias should contribute more often to Wikipedia rather than use Conservapedia as an alternative since he felt that alternative websites like Conservapedia are often \\"incomplete\\". Author Damian Thompson asserts that the purpose of Conservapedia is to \\"dress up nonsense as science\\". Bryan Ochalla, writing for the LGBT magazine The Advocate, referred to the project as \\"Wikipedia for the bigoted\\".Bryan Ochalla, \\"Wikipedia for the bigoted\\". The Advocate, March 25, 2008, p. 12. On the satirical news program The Daily Show, comedian Lewis Black lampooned its article on homosexuality. Black highlighted Conservapedia's introductory sentence \\"homosexuality is an immoral sexual lifestyle\\". In response, he said: \\"On Conservapedia, 'gay' sounds way more interesting!\\" Writing in The Australian, columnist Emma Jane described Conservapedia as \\"a disturbing parallel universe where the ice age is a theoretical period, intelligent design is empirically testable, and relativity and geology are junk sciences.\\" Opinions criticizing the site rapidly spread throughout the blogosphere around early 2007. Schlafly appeared on radio programs Today on BBC Radio 4 and All Things Considered on NPR to discuss the site around that time. In May 2008, Schlafly and one of his homeschooled students appeared on the CBC program The Hour for the same purpose. Stephanie Simon of the Los Angeles Times quoted two Conservapedia editors who commented favorably about Conservapedia. Matt Barber, policy director for the conservative Christian political action group Concerned Women for America, praised Conservapedia as a more family-friendly and accurate alternative to Wikipedia. Wired magazine, in an article entitled \\"Ten Impressive, Weird And Amazing Facts About Wikipedia\\", highlighted several of Conservapedia's articles, including those on \\"Atheism and obesity\\" and \\"Hollywood values\\", amongst others. It also highlighted Conservapedia's \\"Examples of bias in Wikipedia\\" article, which encourages readers to contact Jimmy Wales and tell him to \\"sort it out\\". Conservapedia's use of Wikipedia's format to create a conservative Christian alternative encyclopedia has been mirrored by other sites, such as GodTube, QubeTV and MyChurch, which adopted the format of the more prominent YouTube and MySpace, respectively. Wikipedia's co-creator Jimmy Wales said about Conservapedia that \\"free culture knows no bounds\\" and \\"the reuse of our work to build variants [is] directly in line with our mission\\". Wales denied Schlafly's claims of liberal bias in Wikipedia. = RationalWiki = In April 2007, Peter Lipson, a doctor of internal medicine, attempted to edit Conservapedia's article on breast cancer to include evidence against Conservapedia's claim that abortion increases risk of contracting it. Schlafly and Conservapedia administrators \\"questioned [Lipson's] credentials and shut down debate.\\" After they were blocked, \\"Lipson and several other contributors quit trying to moderate the articles [on Conservapedia] and instead started their own website, RationalWiki.\\" RationalWiki's self-stated purpose is to analyze and refute \\"pseudoscience\\", the \\"anti-science movement\\", and \\"crank ideas\\", as well as to conduct \\"explorations of authoritarianism and fundamentalism\\" and explore \\"how these subjects are handled in the media.\\"Keeler, Mary, Josh Johnson, and Arun Majumdar. \\"Crowdsourced Knowledge: Peril and Promise for Complex Knowledge Systems.\\" According to an article published in the Los Angeles Times in 2007, RationalWiki members \\"monitor Conservapedia. And‚Äîby their own admission‚Äîengage in acts of cyber-vandalism.\\" = Lenski dialogue = On June 9, 2008, New Scientist published an article describing Richard Lenski's 20-year E. coli experiment, which reported that the bacteria had evolved, acquiring the ability to metabolize citrate. Schlafly contacted Lenski to request the data. Lenski explained that the relevant data was in the paper and that Schlafly fundamentally misunderstood it. Schlafly wrote again and requested the raw data. Lenski replied again that the relevant data was already in the paper, that the \\"raw data\\" were living bacterial samples, which he would willingly share with qualified researchers at properly equipped biology labs, and that he felt insulted by letters and comments on Conservapedia which he saw as brusque and offensive, including claims of outright deceit. The Daily Telegraph later called Lenski's reply \\"one of the greatest and most comprehensive put-downs in scientific argument\\". The exchange, recorded on a Conservapedia page entitled \\"Lenski dialog\\", was widely reported on news-aggregating sites and web logs. Carl Zimmer wrote that it was readily apparent that \\"Schlafly had not bothered to read [Lenski's paper] closely\\", and PZ Myers criticized Schlafly for demanding data despite having neither a plan to use it nor the expertise to analyze it. During and after the Lenski dialogue on Conservapedia, several users on the site were blocked for \\"insubordination\\" for expressing disagreement with Schlafly's stance on the issue.Conservapedia has a little hangup over evolution , Charles Arthur, July 1, 2008, The Guardian Technology blog The dialogue between Lenski and Conservapedia is noted in Richard Dawkins' The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution in a chapter concerning Lenski's research.Chapter 5: \\"Before our very eyes (examples of evolution observed)\\"  Conservative Bible Project  Conservapedia hosts the \\"Conservative Bible Project\\", a project aiming to rewrite the English translation of the Bible in order to remove or alter terms described as importing \\"liberal bias\\". The project intends to remove sections of the Bible which are judged by Conservapedia's founder to be later liberal additions. These include the story of the adulteress in the Gospel of John in which Jesus declares \\"Let him who is without sin cast the first stone\\". The project also intends to remove Jesus's prayer on the cross, \\"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing\\", since it appears only in the Gospel of Luke and since, according to Schlafly, \\"the simple fact is that some of the persecutors of Jesus did know what they were doing. This quotation is a favorite of liberals but should not appear in a conservative Bible\\". The Bible project has met with extensive criticism, including from fellow evangelistic Christian conservatives. Rod Dreher, a conservative writer and editor, described the project as \\"insane hubris\\" and \\"crazy\\"; he further described the project as \\"It's like what you'd get if you crossed the Jesus Seminar with the College Republican chapter at a rural institution of Bible learnin. Ed Morrissey, another conservative Christian writer, wrote that bending the word of God to one's own ideology makes God subservient to an ideology, rather than the other way around. Creation Ministries International wrote \\"Forcing the Bible to conform to a certain political agenda, no matter if one happens to agree with that agenda, is a perversion of the Word of God and should therefore be opposed by Christians as much as 'politically correct' Bibles.\\"Politicizing Scripture: Should Christians welcome a 'conservative Bible translation'? (Lita Cosner, Creation Ministries International, December 24, 2009) On October 7, 2009, Stephen Colbert called for his viewers to incorporate him into the Conservapedia Bible as a Biblical figure and viewers responded by editing the Conservapedia Bible to include his name. The edits were, as a matter of course, treated as vandalism and removed. This was followed by an interview between Colbert and Schlafly on December 8, 2009.

Literally thousands of these expressive and diverse figurines have been unearthed, found across a wide variety of settings, including burials and middens.

Many of the figurines of this period function as flutes, whistles, and ocarinas. Some animal figurines, interpreted as toys or more likely ritual items, are equipped with wheels, one of the few recorded instances of the application of wheel technology in the pre-Columbian Americas.Diehl and Mandeville, p. 243. Many figurines have filed teeth, representing a common practice in the Remojadas culture. The earliest figurines were handmade while the later ones were created using molds.

Smiling figurines are rare in Mesoamerican art, and the sheer number of Sonrientes figurines likely attests to their special role in the Remojadas society, although what that role might be has produced much speculation. Some researchers see the characteristic smile as being hallucinogenically producedDavies, p. 91. or perhaps the result of consumption of the alcoholic pulque.Metropolitan Museum of Art. One researcher boldly states that they are \\"undoubtedly related to the cult of the dead\\".Ochoa, p. 68.

It is under the jurisdiction of Coastal Carolina University and is used primarily as an educational research facility. Maritime forest on Waties Island History Waties Island is named for either William Waties Jr. or Sr., who searched out and claimed large tracts of land in the Waccamaw, Pee Dee, and Horry/Georgetown areas. The island was inhabited by the Waccamaw Indians prior to the arrival of Europeans. The area was originally given to James Minor via a land grant, eventually coming into possession by Waties' family. For a short period, the island was known as Waiters Island on maps, due to a typographical error. The land was purchased in the 1920s by Horace Tilghman and given to Coastal Carolina University as a grant by his daughter, Anne. Significance Waties Island is, for the most part, land untouched by human development. This is the result of the entire mass tending to fall under the jurisdiction of a single family or facility who choose not to develop it or have a distinct purpose in keeping the island undeveloped. This underdevelopment of the island contrasts sharply with the surrounding Grand Strand area, a beach region that is mostly developed. In addition, Waties Island is a barrier island with a significantly varying climate and ecology compared to the surrounding city land. It is one of the last remaining undeveloped barrier islands on the South Carolina coast. These factors have contributed to its use as a research area by students and faculty of Coastal Carolina University. The island has a conservation easement with The Nature Conservancy placed on it. Apart from its significance as an ecological research facility, it also has a rich anthropological history. The island is home to many American Indian artifacts, including burial mounds and ceramics.

Description Vaccinium ovatum is a true huckleberry plant, growing well in shade or sun and thriving in acidic soils. Not needing much sun, the plant has a wide variety of forest homes; it is often seen sprouting out of old coast redwood stumps or dense brambles of other forest growths. The shiny, alternately arranged, egg-shaped leaves are 2 to 3 centimeters (0.8-1.2 inches) long and about a centimeter wide (0.4 inches) with finely serrated edges.Jepson Manual treatment, University of California ‚Äî Vaccinium ovatum During the summer the plant produces round, edible black berries up to a centimeter (0.4 inches) in diameter.Flora of North America, Vaccinium ovatum Pursh, 1813. California huckleberry Uses The berries are eaten by birds and mammals throughout autumn. =Culinary= Traditionally, huckleberries were sought after and collected by many Native American tribes along the Pacific coast in the region, including the Karok. The berries are delicious raw, similar to but sweeter and more intense than blueberries, and are a favorite ingredient in jams and jellies. Meriwether Lewis recorded that he observed indigenous people eating the berries raw, dried, and in bread, which preserved the fruit for a season. =Cultivation= Vaccinium ovatum is grown as an ornamental plant for horticultural use by specialty wholesale, retail, and botanic garden native plant nurseries. The plant is successful in natural landscape and native plant palette style, and habitat gardens and public sustainable landscape and restoration projects that are similar to its habitat conditions.Jepson Horticultural Database for Vaccinium ovatum . 11.10.2010CNPLX: Vaccinium ovatum . accessed 11.10.2010 See also *Vaccinium parvifolium *California mixed evergreen forest *Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve Gallery Image:Vaccinium ovatum 3.jpgLeaves Image:Vaccinium ovatum 2.jpgPlant References * Stephen Foster and Christopher Hobbs. 2002.

He never played in the official Australian team, but did play for Australia in World Series Cricket. Born in Salisbury, South Australia, Prior played cricket and Australian rules football as a junior before developing into a tall, rangy right-arm fast bowler, who, on his day, was one of the fastest in Australia. Prior made his first-class debut for South Australia on 1 November 1974 against the touring MCC team at Adelaide Oval, taking 1/60 and 0/18. After a moderately successful debut season, Prior became one of the stand out performers of the 1975‚Äì76 Australian cricket season, taking 43 wickets at 19.67, including 6/41 against the touring West Indian team and match figures of 10/168 against New South Wales, including a hat trick. Prior's bowling was a key element in South Australia winning the Sheffield Shield and led to media speculation that he would be included in the Australian Test side against the West Indies. While the large pool of talented fast bowlers available in Australia kept Prior out of the Test team, former English fast bowler Frank Tyson was sufficiently impressed by his performances to confidentially predict that Prior would be a future mainstay of the Australian side.Tyson, F. (1976) The Hapless Hookers, Garry Sparke & Associates, Melbourne. Prior spent the 1976 English cricket season playing English club cricket, as well as stints for the Kent Second XI and DH Robins' XI. His 1976-77 season for South Australia was disappointing in comparison to his previous season, realising only 17 wickets at 43.00, but Prior was still considered as a future Test player. His problem, common to many cricketers of his era, was monetary. With cricket providing little financial compensation, Prior was required to work to earn a living, doing so as a casual labourer with a suburban Adelaide council until South Australian Cricket Association officials organised work for him with an Adelaide car dealer.Pollard, J. (1982) Australian Cricket: The Game and the Players, Hodder & Stoughton, Sydney. World Series Cricket Prior's financial situation was still precarious however, and so when he was offered a significant contract to join the new World Series Cricket (WSC) competition (as well as the opportunity to again play under his former captain at South Australia, Ian Chappell), Prior jumped at the opportunity. Prior played two WSC Super Tests, taking two wickets at 116.00, and eight WSC International Cup matches, taking four wickets at 54.00. While Prior's bowling statistics were poor, teammates were impressed with his attitude and his pace, once breaking Kepler Wessels' ribs in a country match.Haigh, G. (1993) The Cricket War, The Text Publishing Co. Pty Ltd, East Melbourne, Victoria. . Following the end of World Series Cricket, Prior returned to South Australia for the 1979-80 season, taking 26 wickets at 41.53. He also bought a farm in Lobethal, South Australia with the proceeds of his WSC payments, and his ensuing farm duties led to his unavailability for some matches. Prior missed most of the 1981-82 season due to a mixture of farm commitments and a suspension arising from disputing an umpire's decision in an Adelaide grade match At his retirement at the end of the 1984/85 season, Prior had played 48 first-class matches for 140 wickets at 33.07.Cricket Archive Page on Wayne Prior Referred to as \\"a placid, easy-going character until he gets a ball in his hand and sees a batsman at the other end\\", Prior was usually known by his nickname \\"Fang\\". After losing his front teeth in an Australian rules football match, Prior wore dentures, which he then lost while surfing, leading South Australian teammate Terry Jenner to name him \\"Fang.Sexton, p. 21. Some cricket writers have named Prior amongst the most unlucky players not to have played for Australia. David Hookes, Prior's captain at South Australia, was one who believed Prior should have played Test cricket, calling him \\"a genuine fast and away-swing bowler\\", and noting that Prior often troubled West Indian champion Viv Richards more than any of his Australian fast bowling counterparts.Poulter, G.

The modern rock format known as \\"The Dam 104.7\\" debuted days later. It became popular, and gained larger Arbitron ratings than rival heritage active rock station KQWB-FM \\"Q98\\" at times. Despite a rimshot signal, \\"The Dam\\" also attracted more than 2% of radio listeners in the Grand Forks, North Dakota market, somewhat competing with co-owned active rock station KJKJ \\"KJ 108\\". =104.7 The Wolf= KDAM began stunting as \\"Quick 104.7\\" again, and later flipped to a country music format as \\"104.7 The Wolf\\" in December 2005, competing with KVOX-FM \\"Froggy 99.9\\". The format flip caused controversy with listeners, and several online petitions were created to bring The Dam back. The Wolf was not as successful as \\"The Dam\\", and attracted less than 1% of listeners in the Fargo-Moorhead Arbitron radio market. On September 28, 2006, it was announced that KDAM and the other Clear Channel stations in Fargo were being sold to Radio Fargo-Moorhead, Inc., a company owned by Fargo native James Ingstad. Ingstad had previously sold his stations in 2000, though KDAM didn't sign on until 2002. The sale was approved by the FCC on January 19, 2007. =Mix 104.7= On February 26, 2007, KDAM began stunting with an adult hits format, as \\"Ed FM\\", with talk show host Ed Schultz in the logo on its Web site. The station changed its call sign to KMXW and became an adult contemporary station as \\"Mix 104.7\\" on March 1, 2007, competing with Triad Broadcasting's Hot AC station KLTA \\"FM 105.1\\". =Mojo 104.7= The station began airing Christmas music as a stunt on November 9, 2007 along with KEGK. On November 26, 2007, the station changed to an oldies/classic hits format with the name \\"Mojo 104.7\\", and changed its call sign to KMJO.

College The 6-foot 11 inch (2.11 m) forward came to the Gonzaga Bulldogs in 2004 after a high school career in Clarkston, Washington that saw him named the state's Class 3A Player of the Year for three consecutive years. He sat out the 2004-05 season as a redshirt. Coach Mark Few and the Bulldogs counted on Heytvelt to be a major contributor in his freshman season of eligibility in 2005-06 as part of the supporting cast behind superstar Adam Morrison, but he missed most of the season due to a broken ankle suffered in the Maui Invitational. In the 2006-07 season, he emerged as a potential star, becoming the team's second-leading scorer with 15.5 per game (behind Derek Raivio), top rebounder (7.7 per game), and leading shot-blocker (1.7 per game). The best game of his career came on February 26, 2009 against Santa Clara, when he scored 29 points and grabbed 9 rebounds. However, in what was effectively his freshman year as a player, there were several games in which he made only sporadic impact. Professional career Following his senior season with Gonzaga in 2008-09, he declared for the 2009 NBA Draft, where he went undrafted. In 2009 Heytvelt played for the Washington Wizards in the NBA Summer League. For his first pro season, he went to Turkey to play for Oyak Renault. In May 2010, he signed with Lottomatica Roma until the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season and then was re-signed for another season, but left the team in January 2011. On January 13, 2011 he signed with KK Zagreb in Croatia until the end of the season. He later re-signed with Zagreb for one more season. On June 28, 2012, Heytvelt returned to Turkey after signing a contract with Tofa≈ü for the 2012‚Äì13 season. For the 2013‚Äì14 season, he signed with Ye≈üilgiresun Belediye of the Turkish Basketball Second League.

Education and career He was born in 1917 in Warsaw, of Jewish parents, and as a law student was active in student politics at the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski (Warsaw) University. His early sympathies with communism were shattered by events such as the Soviet purges of the 1930s and the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and he remained a vigorous lifelong anti-communist.Peter Coleman, \\"Krygier, Henry Richard (1917‚Äì1986)\\", Dictionary of Australian Biography, anu.edu. Retrieved 6 October 2020. In 1939, he and his wife, Roma, escaped to Kaunas, Lithuania, where they obtained Japanese transit visas. They reached Sydney, via Vladivostok, Japan and Shanghai, in 1941. In Sydney, he was active in Polish journalism and import-export businesses. Krygier's anti-totalitarian, liberal, democratic perspective led him to sympathies with the international Congress for Cultural Freedom, founded in West Berlin in 1950. In 1954, he formed and became secretary of its Australian arm, the Australian Committee (later Association) for Cultural Freedom. The Association's principal achievement, as well as his, was the creation in 1956 of the literary- political magazine Quadrant, under the editorship of James McAuley.Rafe Champion, Quadrant Magazine: The McAuley Years, the-rathouse.com.

The station is owned by Cumulus Media and airs an adult standards radio format, known as \\"Tucson's All Time Favorites.\\" On Sunday mornings, it plays three hours of big band music. Most hours begin with co-owned Westwood One News. KTUC's studios and transmitter are on Nixon Low Way, off Roger Road.Radio- Locator.com/KTUC History =Early Years= KTUC is the oldest station in Tucson, signing on the air on July 10, 1926. Originally it broadcast on 1370 kilocycles, using the call sign KGAR.Broadcasting Yearbook 1936 page 21 It was owned by Tucson Motor Services, with studios on South 6th Avenue. KGAR was the CBS Radio Network affiliate, carrying its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" In 1941, the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) switched the station's frequency to AM 1400, broadcasting at 250 watts. The call letters were changed to the current KTUC. It continued as a CBS news affiliate for more than half a century, even after network programming moved from radio to TV in the 1950s. At that time, KTUC switched to a full service, middle of the road format of popular music, news and sports. =News and Talk= In the early 1970s KTUC used the slogan \\"Formula 1400,\\" which referred to its practice of airing 35 minutes of news programming and 25 minutes of music programming to round out the hour. The hour started with the news programming then went to the music programming. In the late 1970s, the station segued to a news/talk format, airing news all day and syndicated talk shows at night. It was an affiliate of the Arizona Broadcasting System and picked up newscasts from KTAR in Phoenix on a phone line. By 1977, it was airing a 20-minute newsreel format, with CBS, ABC and Mutual radio newscasts all heard each hour on 20 minute intervals. ABC and Mutual were both tape-delayed. Larry King's Mutual Network talk show aired overnight, although those broadcasts were replaced by the short-lived Enterprise Radio Network in 1981. Tucson Toros baseball games were carried live, although the studio recreated road games in 1980. It was named the AP Broadcast News Station of The Year in 1980. That year, its news staff broke the story about chemical contamination in the underground aquifers of southern Tucson, news items that prompted a major political controversy and subsequent cleanup. It also won investigative awards for breaking and following up on the story of a factory that painted glow-in- the-dark watch dials and instrument panels using tritium, a radioactive isotope that was found in school lunches prepared in a commissary across the street. Throughout the entire period from the 1970s until the Arizona Diamondbacks came into existence, KTUC was the Tucson affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers radio network syndicated from KABC radio in Los Angeles. The station also carried California Angels broadcasts picked up from KMPC in Los Angeles, and would tape delay the Angels games when the Dodgers were on the air. In the days before cable television, when baseball games could be only be seen once a week on Major League Baseball on NBC, the Dodgers and Angels radio broadcasts developed a popular following in Tucson. 1970s sports director Rory Markas went to the 2002 World Series to cover the Angels for KTUC. General manager Tom Maples vowed he could sell ads for a play-by-play of two kids playing basketball with peach basket hoops. In the late 1980s, the station was the Tucson affiliate of the Arizona State University Sun Devils radio network. In the 1990s, the station reversed affiliations and became the flagship of the Arizona Wildcats. KTUC also was the Tucson affiliate of the Phoenix Suns radio network. =Switch from Talk to Standards= In 1998, Sloane Broadcasting bought KTUC and its FM sister station 97.5 KOAZ (now KSZR) for $6.5 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-25 Sloane switched KTUC's format from talk to adult standards. In 2001, KTUC was acquired by Citadel Broadcasting, a forerunner to today's Cumulus Media. Citadel and Cumulus continued the adult standards format, aimed at older listeners and retirees who have settled in the Tucson metropolitan area.

In 2012, a new band room was added on to help hold two separate bands and ensembles during different time periods, and to help with the number of students in the program. During this period, the band received what is now the current band uniforms, along with more funding towards the band program itself. After the football season is over, the band switches from marching season into what is known as \\"Concert Season.\\" Each year, the band becomes divided into two bands: the Symphonic Band and the Wind Ensemble.

Audio production was handled by Ultramagnetic MCs, except for four tracks produced by Godfather Don, who helped to incorporate a darker, jazzier sound than the group's previous work. \\"Checkin' My Style\\" and \\"See the Man on the Street\\" were originally recorded in 1992 during Godfather Don-produced sessions for a projected solo album for Kool Keith's alias Rhythm X. Those same sessions also produced songs released on Cenobites LP, the CD edition of which contains the original extended version of \\"Checkin' My Style,\\" retitled \\"Return To Zero.\\" The Four Horsemen includes recurring science fiction and baseball themes and was viewed by fans as a welcome return to the group's hardcore roots. Because of a manufacturing error, the current Fontana Distribution pressing is identified as the U.M.C.'s on the covering sticker under the shrink wrap.

University of Wisconsin Press, 2005. p15Shindler, Colin. The Triumph of Military Zionism: Nationalism and the Origins of the Israeli Right. I.B.Tauris, 2006. p13. It was founded by the trio of Abba Ahimeir, Uri Zvi Greenberg and Yehoshua Yeivin. History The 1929 Arab riots and the Haganah's inability to successfully prevent the 1929 Hebron massacre and the Safed massacre led to the creation of the first militant organization characterized by its complete disassociation from the existing Zionist establishment dominated by the Labor Zionist movement. Ideology The organization's official ideology was Revisionist Maximalism, which was modelled upon Italian Fascism.Ofira Seliktar. New Zionism and the foreign policy system of Israel. Beckenham, England, UK: Croom Helm, Ltd., 1986. Pp. 84 It sought to create a fascist corporatist state. It is also influenced by the Canaanite ideology of Yonatan Ratosh and the theories of Oswald Spengler in The Decline of the West (1918). It called for the Zionist Revisionist Movement (ZRM) to adopt the fascist principles of the regime of Benito Mussolini in Italy to create an integralist \\"pure nationalism\\" amongst Jews.Larsen, p364-365. Revisionist Maximalism rejects communism, humanism, internationalism, liberalism, pacifism and socialism; condemned liberal Zionists for only working for middle-class Jews rather than the Jewish nation as a whole.Kaplan, p15Shindler, Colin. The Triumph of Military Zionism: Nationalism and the Origins of the Israeli Right. I.B.Tauris, 2006. p156. Revisionist Maximalism's minimal goals were presented in 1932 where Ahimeir officially called for the leadership of the Zionist Revisionist Movement to be redesigned into the form of a dictatorship, called for the creation of an independent Zionist federation, called for a \\"war on funds\\" to end corruption in the Zionist movement, and called for a war on anti-Semitism.Larsen, Stein Ugelvik (ed.). Fascism Outside of Europe. New York: Columbia University Press, 2001. . p378. The movement's psychology was emphasized in its motto of \\"conquer or die\\". Operations Abba Ahimeir (handcuffed) and other members of Brit HaBirionim, among them Haim Dviri, being brought to court in Jerusalem. Members of Brit HaBirionim carried out several operations, including demonstrations against visiting British dignitaries, rallies against the British arrest and deportation to Europe of Jewish refugees who overstayed their tourist visas, attempts to interrupt a census conducted by the British, and other illegal activities intended as public provocations such as blowing the Shofar at the Western Wall (forbidden to Jews at that time), and removing the Nazi flags from two German consulates.Golan, Zev. Free Jerusalem: Heroes, Heroines and Rogues Who Created the State of Israel, (Israel: Devora, 2003), pp. 49-53, 66-77. In 1933, the British Mandatory Authority arrested several members, including Ahimeir, and charged them with the murder of Chaim Arlosoroff. Though acquitted of the charges in 1934, the trial tarnished the group's reputation and led to its isolation by former political supporters among the Jewish populace, and eventually to its demise.

The David Bradford House is a historic house museum at 175 South Main Street in Washington, Pennsylvania. Completed in 1788, it was the home of David Bradford, a leader of the Whiskey Rebellion. It has both architectural and historic importance, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1983. It is open weekly between April and November, or by appointment. History The house was built by David Bradford, a successful lawyer and deputy attorney-general for Washington County, Pennsylvania who would later become a leader in the Whiskey Rebellion. It was the first stone house on South Main Street in Washington, Pennsylvania in 1788, which, by frontier standards, ranked as a mansion. The two-story building was built in the Georgian style, with dressed stone four-bay windows. The house has side hall entry with a fanlight transom. The stairway was solid mahogany; the mantel-pieces and other interior furnishings, imported from Philadelphia, were transported across the Alleghenies at considerable expense. While restoring the house a secret underground passage was discovered leading to a nearby ravine. This tunnel was presumably used as an escape route in the event of an attack on the house. Bradford and his family occupied the house only for 6 years, until 1794, when he fled following the Whiskey Rebellion. It was in this home that author Rebecca Harding Davis was born on June 24, 1831. A historical marker honoring her a few blocks away was the first dedicated to a woman in Washington, Pennsylvania.http://www.observer- reporter.com/article/20130413/NEWS01/130419666/-1/NEWS10 By the 1930s, the building was in such disrepair that Charles Morse Stotz did not include the building in his The Early Architecture of Western Pennsylvania. However, by the book's 2nd printing in 1966, Stotz himself has led the rehabilitation. Among other extensive modifications, a storefront had added to the house. In 1953, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker noting the historic importance of the building. In 1959, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission assumed control of the house and supervised restoration of its eighteenth-century design. They installed furnishings of that time in Pennsylvania that they felt reflected Bradford's place in society. A management agreement was signed in 1982, turning the management of the Bradford House over to the Bradford House Historical Association. The museum is open from early May through mid December, giving group tours and hosting other special events. The home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1983. It is also designated as a historic public landmark by the Washington County History & Landmarks Foundation.

Charlton is a former United States Attorney and current partner at the law firm of Dentons US LLP in the firm's Phoenix, Arizona office. Charlton concentrates his practice on high-profile and complex litigation, internal investigations and white-collar criminal defense. Charlton also represents a number of Arizona Native American governments, including Ak-Chin, Salt River Pima-Maricopa, Haulapai, the Navajo Nation, and Tohono O'odham. Prior to joining Dentons, he served as managing partner at law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP. Charlton served as the United States Attorney for the District of Arizona from 2001‚Äì2007. He was nominated in November 2001 by President George W. Bush. He oversaw a staff of more than 220 employees, four offices throughout the state, and an approximately $20 million budget. During his tenure, Charlton led enforcement initiatives against terrorism, public corruption, illegal immigration and crime in Indian Country.Wagner, Dennis. \\"The Arizona Republic\\", December 20, 2006. Charlton began his legal career in 1989 as an Assistant Attorney General with the Arizona Attorney General's Office. In March 1991, Charlton joined the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona as an Assistant U.S. Attorney where he prosecuted a wide variety of matters from homicides to complex fraud cases. Charlton was one of seven U.S. attorneys dismissed on December 7, 2006 by the Bush administration in 2006 for \\"performance-related issues\\" (see Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy). Subsequent disclosures revealed that three or more additional attorneys were dismissed under similar circumstances between 2005-2006. Charlton was confirmed as the United States Attorney for the United States District Court for the District of Arizona on November 6, 2001.Presidential Nomination: Michael Aaron Butler Charlton was informed of his dismissal by Justice Department official Michael A. Battle on December 7, 2006, and announced his resignation on December 19, 2006, effective January 31, 2007. Charlton's office had been honored with the Federal Service Award and hailed by the Justice Department as a \\"model program\\" for its protection of crime victims. Charlton ranked in the top third among the nation's 93 US attorneys in contributing to an overall 106,188 federal prosecutions filed in 2006; scored in the top third in number of convictions; oversaw a district in the top five highest in number of immigration-related prosecutions; ranked among the top 20 offices for drug prosecutions; and, unlike in the other seven cases, ranked high in weapons cases, prosecuting 199 of the United States' 9,313 such cases in 2006, the tenth-highest in the country and up fourfold from 2002. Overall, Charlton ranked number one in the nation for convictions in 2006. United States attorney Paul K. Charlton as U.S. Attorney In September 2006, it became clear that Charlton had launched an investigation of Rep. Rick Renzi, R-Ariz, over a land-swap deal. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales's chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, subsequently included Charlton on a list of U.S. attorneys \\"we now should consider pushing out.\\" Sampson made the comment in a Sept. 13, 2006, letter to then-White House Counsel Harriet Miers. As recently as February 2005, Charlton had been on the so-called \\"retain\\" list. On March 19, 2007, the White House released 3,000 pages of records connected to the controversy, including emails sent by Charlton to the Justice Department about his dismissal. On Dec. 21, 2006, Charlton sent a message to William W. Mercer, the third-ranking official in the department, writing, \\"Media now asking if I was asked to resign over leak in Congressman Renzi investigation.\\" Charlton never received a response. The Wall Street Journal explained further allegations: that the Department of Justice intentionally delayed part of the investigation of Renzi until after the November 2006 election. They wrote: Further, the Journal noted that investigators had lobbied Washington for clearance to tap Renzi's phone for months. That clearance was only given in October 2006, but unfortunately for the investigators, word broke of the investigation soon after, disrupting their wiretap. On April 24, 2007, Charlton revealed to House investigators that Brian Murray, Renzi's top aide, called Charlton spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle shortly after news of Renzi's investigation became public, asking for information on the case. Charlton, in turn, notified the Department of Justice about the call. Justice, however, had not previously notified Congress of the contact. A second motivation for removing Charlton may have been the suggestions of Justice official Brent Ward, who said in a September 20, 2006 e-mail that Charlton was \\"unwilling to take good cases.\\" Ward's reason for discounting Charlton appeared to be the US attorney's reluctance to pursue obscenity charges against adult video manufacturers in connection to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales's Obscenity Prosecution Task Force. After a disagreement over initiating the tape- recording of interviews and confessions by the FBI on American Indian reservations, which Charlton supported and the Justice Department opposed, Charlton offered to resign. In his congressional testimony on March 6, 2007, Charlton said he found \\"no small amount of irony\\" in the fact that he was eventually fired. The Justice Department reversed its longstanding no- recording policy in May 2014, now requiring federal law enforcement agencies to tape-record interviews with suspects in most instances. Charlton was quoted, > The most difficult part of proving a crime is the state of mind, and that is > almost always obtained through a statement of the suspect. It was an > unjustifiable policy. I think this one of the most significant improvements > in the criminal justice system in a long time. Charlton had clashed with the Bush Administration over the death penalty; in at least two cases he did not seek capital punishment but was overruled from Washington. In its formal investigation regarding the firing of the US Attorneys, the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General found as follows: > We concluded that the most significant factor in Charlton's removal was his > actions in a death penalty case. Charlton persistently opposed the > Department's decision to seek the death penalty in a homicide case, and he > irritated Department leaders by seeking a meeting with the Attorney General > to urge him to reconsider his decision. We are troubled that Department > officials considered Charlton's actions in the death penalty case, including > requesting a meeting with the Attorney General, to be inappropriate. We do > not believe his actions were insubordinate or that they justified his > removal. Since leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office, Charlton was awarded Arizona's State Bar Criminal Justice Award, the University of Arizona Alumni Association Public Service Award and the Phoenix Business Journal's Most Admired Leaders Award.

Its mascot is the Warrior, and its colors are brown and gold. The school fight song consists of music from the march Winchester (from Winchester High School, Winchester, Virginia), with original words written for Western High. The entrance roads to the school are Bryant Boulevard and Noell Way, named in honor of the school district administrator and head of the school board at the time. History Western High School opened its doors in September 1973 after two years of construction. It was built due to overcrowding at Bay City Central and T. L. Handy High School. During this time the students who lived in Bay City would go to school in the morning from 7:00 AM to 12:00 Noon; and those outside of the city would go in the afternoon, from 12:00 Noon through 5:00 PM. In 1973, new boundaries were established, with mostly everyone west of Two Mile Road attending Western High School. Seniors (and some juniors) were given the option to complete their education at Handy or Central. On the first day of school there were Handy kids on one side of the room and Central kids on the other side. By the end of the year they were all Western High Students. When the building opened, construction on some parts of the facility had not yet been completed, including the main hallway, the swimming pool, the football stadium, and the commons. There were student desks still in boxes in some parts of the building. In some cases students ate their lunches on top of carpet rolls in the commons that had not yet been installed. It has been claimed that, after Handy High School was converted back to T.L Handy middle school (having been Handy High school since 1940) in 1990, two of its former students, now being forced to attend Western, went to their old school's parking lot and danced their own personal Homecoming, rather than attending Western's. At commencement that year former Handy students were permitted to wear their traditional red caps and gowns while Western students wore brown and gold. In the 1980s it was announced that Western Middle School would be created and would share a building with Western High School. To this day, Western Middle School occupies half of the building that was originally designed for the high school. The two schools are able to operate simultaneously because of different schedules. In addition, classrooms are physically separated into different areas of the building. The two schools share the building's swimming pool, gymnasium, and commons. In the 1980s, some portions of the school's tunnel systems collapsed due to water damage and was fixed with wooden beams and to prevent future damage. Bay City Western has earned athletic state championships in 1999 in Michigan Division I Boys' Golf, and in 2013 and 2014 in Division 1 Baseball. In 2006 the Pompon team earned a state championship at the Highkick competition. Building Western High School has the usual number of academic departments. These include English, Math, Social Studies, Science, Computers, Arts, Broadcasting and Communications, Human Services, Physical Education and Industrial Arts, all of which are separated into wings. There is a library in between the high school and middle school sides; they are connected as one room, but students are restricted from the other school's library. Recent renovation is shown to halls with the addition of new lockers. There is also a second floor which consists mostly of Math, Human Services, Social Studies, and Computers as of which a middle school portion is connected in the East wing. The lower portion of the first floor on the south side of school consists of Science, Social Studies, and English. The library entrance is also in this area as well as a locker bay. The south portion also consists of most of the classrooms in middle school. Heading north are the administration offices which are halfway between the lower level and the second floor which leads to the main entrances, commons, gym on the west side. And towards the east are Bryant Auditorium and the Arts Department The Arts Department contains classes such as Art, Auto-Mechanics, Industrial Drawings, Welding, Wood Shop, Video and Radio, Drama, Choir and Band. There is a backside and backstage entrance to Bryant Auditorium as well as a locker bay and entrances to the school's tunnel system. Bryant Auditorium seats about 1200 people and is used for various activities including school plays and presentations. Beneath the stage is a rehearsal/dressing room and behind the stage contains the part of the Sound system and access stairs to the technical aspects of the lighting system. There is also a loading dock behind the stage. In the upper portion of the auditorium there is a lounge and spot light access. The Commons is the area in which students of Western High and Middle school eat, although is separated into areas for them. It consists of a small vending area a corner store that students can buy school supplies and snacks from. There are also two lunch lines on each end of the common which are shared by the Western High and middle school students which sometimes can cause problems with shared lunch periods between the schools. A trophy case is in the hallway at the front of the commons. High school students have an open campus lunch due to the sharing of the commons with the middle school. The upper and lower gym are located next to the commons as of which there are two entrances from the commons. Access to the locker rooms are also provided. Through the locker rooms there is a pool that can be reached from other points in the building such as the \\"190's hallway\\" above the gym. The \\"190's hallway\\" consists of middle school and the Economics class. There are access points to the pool, gym, and school grounds in this hallway. The \\"190's hallway\\" has lockers against its walls and are used by high school and middle school students. Some students think the \\"190's hallway\\" can be used to skip classes due to its distance away from the main classes and little student traffic. There is also a set of bathrooms that are always locked due to little traffic and vandalism. The Bay City Western Football Stadium is commonly referred to as \\"The Cornfield\\" due to its close proximity to various farm fields around Auburn. The Bay City Western Marching Band also performs a \\"train\\" routine where they begin in concentric circles, and slowly rotate before speeding up and spreading out, while playing the sound of a moving train. This is due to a set of train tracks running directly behind the north end of the field that are visible from all around the stadium. It is believed that the most attended game at the stadium was between Bay City Western and Midland High on November 4, 2005 in a district championship playoff game, which Western won 35-21.MHSAA-2005 Football Playoff Scores and Pairings Grounds The grounds consist of tennis courts, practice fields, baseball fields, and track surrounding the football field. Also the student parking lot which is placed next to the baseball and football fields, there are also some old, unused basketball hoops in the center of the parking lot. There is a visitors and staff parking lot on the other side of the building which is not accessible through the student parking lot nor can students park in this lot. Sidewalks are surrounding the building guiding to Midland Road. The courtyard is located at the main entrance in which some students eat during lunch.  Demographics  The demographic breakdown of the 1,256 students enrolled in 2015-16 was: * Male - 53.5% * Female - 46.4% * Native American/Alaskan - .32% * Asian - .80% * Black - .48% * Hispanic - 2.9% * Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander - 0% * White - 93.6% * Multiracial - 1.9% 23.2% of the students were eligible for free or reduced-cost lunch.

The screenplay was written by Allen Kahn. Plot Magician Montag the Magnificent delivers hectoring speeches about the nature of reality to his audience and then performs mutilation tricks on female \\"volunteers\\". The women appear unharmed immediately afterward but later collapse, dead, in public or at home‚Äîmutilated in the same grisly fashion suggested by Montag's stage tricks (cut in half with a chainsaw, drilled through with a punch press, etc.). Audience member Sherry Carson, a local TV talk show hostess, and her boyfriend Jack begin to suspect that Montag is somehow involved in the murders. Jack and fellow reporter Greg attempt to research the case but are unable to come up with any solid evidence. Montag agrees to appear on Sherry's show to perform a fire trick; when the cameras roll, he hypnotizes not only everyone in the studio, but also the viewing audience at home. With a wave of his hand, Montag starts a blaze and is guiding Sherry and two plainclothes cops toward it when Jack intervenes and pushes Montag into the fire instead. Screaming, the magician dies. Back at home, Sherry and Jack have a drink as they discuss their strange experience. Suddenly, Jack laughs and begins peeling his own skin from his face to reveal that he is actually Montag. \\"What makes you think you know what reality is?\\" he asks Sherry before disemboweling her with his bare hands. But Sherry, still alive and laughing maniacally, tells the baffled Montag that none of what has happened was real‚Äîand that even he is part of her illusion. \\"You are no longer even here,\\" she informs Montag. \\"You'll have to start your little charade all over again.\\" \\"But I...I am Montag!\\" the magician stammers helplessly. Then he is back onstage, dazed, reciting the same speech that he delivered to his audience at the beginning of the film: \\"What is real? How do you know that at this second you aren't asleep in your beds, dreaming that you are here in this theater?\\" And in the audience an unimpressed Sherry turns to Jack, muttering, \\"You know what I think? I think he's a phony.\\" Cast * Ray Sager as Montag the Magnificent * Judy Cler as Sherry Carson * Wayne Ratay as Jack * Phil Laurenson as Greg * Jim Rau as Steve * Don Alexander as Detective Kramer * John Elliot as Detective Harlan Production Principal photography took place in 1969 and lasted two weeks. According to Lewis, the initial actor cast as Montag the Magnificent walked off the set following a confrontation with Lewis collaborator Fred Sandy. Crew member Ray Sager assumed the starring role. A. Louise Downe aided Lewis in special effects design as she had on Blood Feast. Lewis' son Robert assisted in the execution of the gore effects because of his willingness to handle animal viscera. In The Amazing Herschell Gordon Lewis, Daniel Krogh notes that the film's graphic gore effects were accomplished with two sheep carcasses. The carcasses, which had to be carried around for more than two weeks while the film was being shot, were soaked in Pine-Sol. Krogh also describes how the chainsaw sequence was filmed: two women, one whose upper body was exposed and another whose legs were exposed, played the single victim. A fake midsection filled with animal organs, mortician's wax and condoms full of stage blood was placed between the two women. According to Allmovie, the film's special effects were compromised \\"due to rushed schedules, budgetary limitations, and unforeseen accidents on the set\\", and Lewis claimed to be unhappy with the final product. Critical reception Allmovie called the film \\"arguably the most interesting product from cinematic gorehound Herschell Gordon Lewis\\", though a \\"standard Lewis collection of non-actors and clumsy cinematography, and it isn't unlikely that the script's elliptical qualities are due more to the hasty plugging of plot holes than any grand design.\\" TV Guide felt that the film represented one the directors worst efforts, criticizing the acting (particularly Sager), cinematography, and editing. Remake The film was remade in 2007, starring Crispin Glover as Montag the Magnificent. In popular culture The film was notably referenced and a scene is shown in the 2007 film Juno.

The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Savoy-led Kingdom of Sardinia, which can be considered its legal predecessor state. Italy declared war on Austria in alliance with Prussia in 1866 and received the region of Veneto following their victory. Italian troops entered Rome in 1870, thereby ending more than one thousand years of Papal temporal power. Italy entered into a Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1882, following strong disagreements with France about the respective colonial expansions. However, even if relations with Berlin became very friendly, the alliance with Vienna remained purely formal as the Italians were keen to acquire Trentino and Trieste, corners of Austria-Hungary populated by Italians. So during World War I, Italy accepted the British invitation to join the Allied Powers, as the western powers promised territorial compensation (at the expense of Austria- Hungary) for participation that was more generous than Vienna's offer in exchange for Italian neutrality. Victory in the war gave Italy a permanent seat in the Council of the League of Nations. \\"Fascist Italy\\" is the era of National Fascist Party government from 1922 to 1943 with Benito Mussolini as head of government. The fascists imposed totalitarian rule and crushed the political and intellectual opposition, while promoting economic modernization, traditional social values and a rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church. According to Payne (1996), \\"[the] Fascist government passed through several relatively distinct phases\\". The first phase (1923‚Äì1925) was nominally a continuation of the parliamentary system, albeit with a \\"legally-organized executive dictatorship\\". Then came the second phase, \\"the construction of the Fascist dictatorship proper, from 1925 to 1929\\". The third phase, with less activism, was 1929 to 1934. The fourth phase, 1935‚Äì1940, was characterized by an aggressive foreign policy: war against Ethiopia, launched from Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, which resulted in its annexation; confrontations with the League of Nations, leading to sanctions; growing economic autarky; and the signing of the Pact of Steel. The war itself (1940‚Äì1943) was the fifth phase with its disasters and defeats, while the rump Sal√≤ Government under German control was the final stage (1943‚Äì1945).Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914‚Äì1945 (1996) p 212 Italy was an important member of the Axis powers in World War II, battling on several fronts with initial success. However, after the German-Italian defeat in Africa and in the Soviet Union and the subsequent Allied landings in Sicily, King Victor Emmanuel III placed Mussolini under arrest, and the Fascist Party in areas (south of Rome) controlled by the Allied invaders was shut down. The new government signed an armistice in September 1943. German forces immediately occupied northern Italy with Fascists' help, setting up the Italian Social Republic, a collaborationist puppet state still led by Mussolini and his Fascist loyalists. As a consequence, the country descended into civil war, with the Italian Co-belligerent Army and the resistance movement contended the Social Republic's forces and its German allies. Shortly after the war and the liberation of the country, civil discontent led to the institutional referendum on whether Italy would remain a monarchy or become a republic. Italians decided to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic, the present-day Italian state. Overview =Territory= Map of the Kingdom of Italy at its greatest extent in 1943 The Kingdom of Italy claimed all of the territory which covers present-day Italy and even more. The development of the Kingdom's territory progressed under Italian re-unification until 1870. The state for a long period of time did not include Trieste or Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol, which were annexed in 1919 and remain Italian territories today. The Triple Entente promised to grant to Italy ‚Äì if the state joined the Allies in World War I ‚Äì several territories including former Austrian Littoral, western parts of former Duchy of Carniola, Northern Dalmazia and notably Zara, Sebenico and most of the Dalmatian islands (except Krk and Rab), according to the secret London Pact of 1915. After the compromise was nullified under pressure of President Woodrow Wilson with the Treaty of Versailles, Italian claims on Northern Dalmazia were voided. During World War II, the Kingdom gained additional territory: it gained Corsica, Nizza and Savoia from France after its surrender in 1940, territory in Slovenia and Dalmazia from Yugoslavia after its breakup in 1941 and Monaco in 1942. After World War II, the borders of present-day Italy were founded and the Kingdom abandoned its land claims. The Italian Empire also gained territory until the end of World War II through colonies, protectorates, military occupations and puppet states. These included Eritrea, Italian Somaliland, Libya, Ethiopia (occupied by Italy from 1936 to 1941), Albania, British Somaliland, Greece (occupied in World War II), Tunisia, Croatia (Italian and German client state in World War II), Kosovo (occupied in World War II), Montenegro (occupied in World War II) and a 46-hectare concession from China in Tianjin (see Italian concession in Tianjin). =Government= King Umberto II behind of the Flag of Kingdom of Italy The Kingdom of Italy was theoretically a constitutional monarchy. Executive power belonged to the monarch, who exercised his power through appointed ministers. The legislative branch was a bicameral Parliament comprising an appointive Senate and an elective Chamber of Deputies. The kingdom's constitution was the Statuto Albertino, the former governing document of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In theory, ministers were solely responsible to the king. However, by this time it was impossible for a king to appoint a government entirely of his own choosing or keep it in office, against the express will of Parliament. Members of the Chamber of Deputies were elected by plurality voting system elections in uninominal districts. A candidate needed the support of 50% of those voting and of 25% of all enrolled voters to be elected on the first round of balloting. If not all seats were filled on the first ballot, a runoff was held shortly afterwards for the remaining vacancies. After a brief multinominal experimentation in 1882, proportional representation into large, regional, multi-seat electoral constituencies was introduced after World War I. Socialists became the major party, but they were unable to form a government in a parliament split into three different factions, with Christian populists and classical liberals. Elections took place in 1919, 1921 and 1924: in this last occasion, Mussolini abolished proportional representation, replacing it with the Acerbo Law, by which the party that won the largest share of the votes got two-thirds of the seats, which gave the Fascist Party an absolute majority of the Chamber seats. Between 1925 and 1943, Italy was a quasi-de jure Fascist dictatorship, as the constitution formally remained in effect without alteration by the Fascists, though the monarchy also formally accepted Fascist policies and Fascist institutions. Changes in politics occurred, consisting of the establishment of the Grand Council of Fascism as a government body in 1928, which took control of the government system, as well as the Chamber of Deputies being replaced with the Chamber of Fasces and Corporations as of 1939. =Monarchs= The monarchs of the House of Savoy who led Italy were: * Victor Emmanuel II (r. 1861‚Äì1878) ‚Äì last King of Sardinia and first king of united Italy * Umberto I (r. 1878‚Äì1900) ‚Äì approved the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria- Hungary, assassinated in 1900 by the anarchist Gaetano Bresci * Victor Emmanuel III (r. 1900‚Äì1946) ‚Äì King of Italy during the First World War and during the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini * Umberto II (r. 1946) ‚Äì the last King of Italy who was pressured to call a referendum on whether Italy would retain the monarchy, but Italians voted to become a republic instead of a constitutional monarchy =Military structure= * King of Italy ‚Äì supreme commander of the Italian Royal Army, Navy and later Air Force from 1861 to 1938 and 1943 to 1946 * First Marshal of the Empire ‚Äì supreme commander of the Italian Royal Army, Air Force, Navy and the Voluntary Militia for National Security from 1938 to 1943 during the Fascist era, held by both Victor Emmanuel III and Benito Mussolini * Regio Esercito (Royal Army) * Regia Marina (Royal Navy) * Regia Aeronautica (Royal Air Force) * Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale (Voluntary Militia for National Security also known as the \\"Blackshirts\\") ‚Äì militia loyal to Mussolini during the Fascist era, abolished in 1943  Unification process (1848‚Äì1870)  Italian unification between 1815 and 1870 The creation of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of concerted efforts of Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula. After the Revolutions of 1848, the apparent leader of the Italian unification movement was Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi, renowned for his extremely loyal followers.Dennis Mack Smith, Modern Italy; A Political History, (University of Michigan Press, 1997) p. 15. A literary echo may be found in the character of Giorgio Viola in Joseph Conrad's Nostromo. Garibaldi led the Italian republican drive for unification in Southern Italy, but the Northern Italy monarchy of the House of Savoy in the Kingdom of Sardinia, a state with an important Italian population, whose government was led by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. Though the Kingdom had no physical connection to Rome (seen by all as the natural capital of Italy, but still capital of the Papal States), the Kingdom had successfully challenged Austria in the Second Italian War of Independence, liberating Lombardy-Venetia from Austrian rule. The Kingdom also had established important alliances which helped it improve the possibility of Italian unification, such as with the United Kingdom and France in the Crimean War. Sardinia was dependent on French protection and in 1860 Sardinia was forced to cede territory to France to maintain relations, including Garibaldi's birthplace, Nizza. Count Camillo Benso of Cavour, the first Prime Minister of the unified Italy Cavour moved to challenge republican unification efforts by Garibaldi by organizing popular revolts in the Papal States and used these revolts as a pretext to invade the country, even though the invasion angered the Roman Catholics, whom he told that the invasion was an effort to protect the Roman Catholic Church from the anti-clerical secularist nationalist republicans of Garibaldi. Only a small portion of the Papal States around Rome remained in the control of Pope Pius IX.Smith (1997), pp. 23‚Äì24 Despite their differences, Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. Subsequently, the Parliament declared the creation of the Kingdom of Italy on 18 February 1861 (officially proclaiming it on 17 March 1861) composed of both Northern Italy and Southern Italy. King Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy was then declared King of Italy, though he did not renumber himself with the assumption of the new title. This title had been out of use since the abdication of Napoleon I of France on 6 April 1814. Victor Emmanuel II, the first King of the united Italy Following the unification of most of Italy, tensions between the royalists and republicans erupted. In April 1861, Garibaldi entered the Italian parliament and challenged Cavour's leadership of the government, accusing him of dividing Italy and spoke of the threat of civil war between the Kingdom in the North and Garibaldi's forces in the South. On 6 June 1861, the Kingdom's strongman Cavour died. During the ensuing political instability, Garibaldi and the republicans became increasingly revolutionary in tone. Garibaldi's arrest in 1862 set off worldwide controversy.Smith (1997), p. 61 Giuseppe Garibaldi, a major military leader during Italian unification In 1866, Otto von Bismarck, Minister President of Prussia, offered Victor Emmanuel II an alliance with the Kingdom of Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War. In exchange, Prussia would allow Italy to annex Austrian-controlled Veneto. King Emmanuel agreed to the alliance and the Third Italian War of Independence began. Italy fared poorly in the war with a badly- organized military against Austria, but Prussia's victory allowed Italy to annex Veneto. At this point, one major obstacle to Italian unity remained: Rome. In 1870, Prussia went to war with France, igniting the Franco-Prussian War. To keep the large Prussian Army at bay, France abandoned its positions in Rome ‚Äì which protected the remnants of the Papal States and Pius IX ‚Äì in order to fight the Prussians. Italy benefited from Prussia's victory against France by being able to take over the Papal States from French authority. Rome was captured by the Kingdom of Italy after several battles and guerrilla-like warfare by Papal Zouaves and official troops of the Holy See against the Italian invaders. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterward Italy's capital was moved to Rome. Economic conditions in the united Italy were poor.Smith (1997), pp. 95‚Äì96 There were no industry or transportation facilities, extreme poverty (especially in the \\"Mezzogiorno\\"), high illiteracy and only a small percent of wealthy Italians had the right to vote. The unification movement had largely been dependent on the support of foreign powers and remained so afterwards. Following the capture of Rome in 1870 from French forces of Napoleon III, Papal troops and Zouaves, relations between Italy and the Vatican remained sour for the next sixty years with the Popes declaring themselves to be prisoners in the Vatican. The Roman Catholic Church frequently protested the actions of the secular and anticlerical-influenced Italian governments, refused to meet with envoys from the King and urged Roman Catholics not to vote in Italian elections.Smith (1997), p. 91 It would not be until 1929 that positive relations would be restored between the Kingdom of Italy and the Vatican after the signing of the Lateran Pacts. = Unifying multiple bureaucracies = A major challenge for the prime ministers of the new Kingdom of Italy was integrating the political and administrative systems of the seven different major components into a unified set of policies. The different regions were proud of their own historic patterns and could not easily be fitted into the Sardinian model. Cavour started the planning, but died before it was fully developed‚Äîindeed, the challenges of administration the various bureaucracies are thought to have hastened his death. The easiest challenge was to harmonize the administrative bureaucracies of Italy's regions. They practically all followed the Napoleonic precedent, so harmonization was straightforward. The second challenge was to develop a parliamentary system. Cavour and most liberals up and down the peninsula highly admired the British system, so it became the model for Italy to this day. Harmonizing the Army and Navy were much more complex, chiefly because the systems of recruiting soldiers and selecting and promoting officers were so different and needed to be grandfathered in over decades. The disorganization helps explain why the Italian naval performance in the 1866 war was so abysmal. The military system was slowly integrated over several decades. The multiple educational system likewise proved complicated for there were few common elements. Shortly before his death, Cavour appointed Francesco De Sanctis as minister of education. De Sanctis was an eminent scholar from the University of Naples who proved an able and patient administrator. The addition of Veneto in 1866 and Rome in 1870 further complicated the challenges of bureaucratic coordination.Harry Hearder, Cavour (1994 p 203-5. = Culture and society = Italian society after unification and throughout most of the Liberal Period was sharply divided along class, linguistic, regional and social lines.Martin Clark, Modern Italy: 1871‚Äì1995 (1996) p. 35 The north‚Äìsouth divide is still present. On 20 September 1870, the military forces of the King of Italy overthrew what little was left of the Papal States, capturing in particular the city of Rome. The following year, the capital was moved from Florence to Rome. For the next 59 years after 1870, the Church denied the legitimacy of the Italian King's dominion in Rome, which it claimed rightfully belonged to the Papal States. In 1929, the dispute was settled by the Lateran Treaty, in which the King recognized Vatican City as an independent state and paid a large sum of money to compensate the Church for the loss of the Papal States. Liberal governments generally followed a policy of limiting the role of the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy as the state confiscated church lands. Similar policies were supported by such anticlerical and secular movements as republicanism, socialism, anarchism, Freemasonry, Lazzarettism and Protestantism. Common cultural traits in Italy in this time were social conservative in nature, including a strong belief in the family as an institution and patriarchal values. In other areas, Italian culture was divided: aristocrats and upper middle class families in Italy at this time were highly traditional in nature and they emphasized honor above all, with challenges to honor ending in duels. After unification, a number of descendants of former royal nobility became residents of Italy, comprising 7,400 noble families. Many wealthy landowners maintained a feudal-like tight control over \\"their\\" peasants. Italian society in this period remained highly divided along regional and local sub-societies which often had historical rivalries with each other.Clark, pp. 29‚Äì33 In 1860, Italy lacked a single national language: toscano (Tuscan), which is what we now know as Italian, was only used as a literary language and in Tuscany, while outside other languages were dominant. Even the kingdom's first king, Victor Emmanuel II, was known to speak almost entirely in Piedmontese and French, even to his cabinet ministers. Illiteracy was high, with the 1871 census indicating that 61.9% of Italian men were illiterate and 75.7% of Italian women were illiterate. This illiteracy rate was far higher than that of western European countries in the same time period and also no national popular press was possible due to the multiplicity of regional languages.Clark, pp. 35‚Äì36. Italy had very few public schools upon unification, so the Italian government in the Liberal Period attempted to increase literacy by establishing state-funded schools to teach the official Italian language.Roberto Sani, \\"State, church and school in Italy from 1861 to 1870,\\" History of Education and Children's Literature (2011) 6#2 pp 81‚Äì114. Living standards were low during the Liberal Period, especially in southern Italy, due to various diseases such as malaria and epidemics that occurred during the period. As a whole, there was initially a high death rate in 1871 at 30 people dying per 1,000 people, though this reduced to 24.2 per 1,000 by the 1890s. In addition, the mortality rate of children dying in their first year after birth in 1871 was 22.7 percent while the number of children dying before reaching their fifth birthday was very high at 50 percent. The mortality rate of children dying in their first year after birth decreased to an average of 17.6 percent in the time period of 1891 to 1900.Clark, pp. 14, 31 = Economy = In terms of the entire period, Giovanni Federico has argued that Italy was not economically backward, for there was substantial development at various times between 1860 and 1940. Unlike most modern nations that relied on large corporations, industrial growth in Italy was a product of the entrepreneurial efforts of small, family-owned firms that succeeded in a local competitive environment.Giovanni Federico, \\"Italy, 1860‚Äì1940: A Little- Known Success Story,\\" Economic History Review (1996) 49#4 pp. 764‚Äì786 Political unification did not systematically bring economic integration, as Italy faced serious economic problems and economic division along political, social and regional lines. In the Liberal Period, Italy remained highly economically dependent on foreign trade and the international price of coal and grain.Clark, Modern Italy p. 27 A factory machinery exposition in Turin, set in 1898, during the period of early industrialization, National Exhibition of Turin, 1898 Upon unifying, Italy had a predominantly agrarian society as 60% of the active population worked in agriculture. Advances in technology, the sale of vast Church estates, foreign competition along with export opportunities rapidly transformed the agricultural sector in Italy shortly after unification. However, these developments did not benefit all of Italy in this period, as southern Italy's agriculture suffered from hot summers and aridity damaged crops while the presence of malaria prevented cultivation of low-lying areas along Italy's Adriatic Sea coast.Clark, Modern Italy pp 12‚Äì14 A 1899 FIAT advertisement The overwhelming attention paid to foreign policy alienated the agricultural community in Italy which had been in decline since 1873. Both radical and conservative forces in the Italian parliament demanded that the government investigate how to improve agriculture in Italy. The investigation, which started in 1877 and was released eight years later, showed that agriculture was not improving, that landowners were earning revenue from their lands and contributing almost nothing to the development of the land. Lower class Italians were hurt by the break-up of communal lands to the benefit of landlords. Most of the workers on the agricultural lands were not peasants, but short-term laborers (\\"braccianti\\") who at best were employed for one year. Peasants without stable income were forced to live off of meager food supplies, disease was spreading rapidly and plagues were reported, including a major cholera epidemic which killed at least 55,000 people.Smith (1997), pp 12‚Äì21) The Italian government could not deal with the situation effectively because of overspending that left Italy heavily in debt. Italy also suffered economically as a consequence of overproduction of grapes by their vineyards. In the 1870s and 1880s, France's vineyard industry was suffering from vine disease caused by insects. Italy prospered as the largest exporter of wine in Europe, but following the recovery of France in 1888 Southern Italy was overproducing and had to cut back, which caused greater unemployment and bankruptcies.Smith (1997), p. 139 The Italian government invested heavily in developing railways in the 1870s, more than doubling the existing length of railway line between 1870 and 1890. = \\"Il Mezzogiorno\\" (Southern Italy) = Italy's population remained severely divided between wealthy elites and impoverished workers, especially in the South. An 1881 census found that over 1 million southern day-laborers were chronically under- employed and were very likely to become seasonal emigrants in order to economically sustain themselves.Clark. pp. 15 Southern peasants as well as small landowners and tenants often were in a state of conflict and revolt throughout the late 19th century.Clark. pp. 16 There were exceptions to the generally poor economic condition of agricultural workers of the South, as some regions near cities such as Naples and Palermo as well as along the Tyrrhenian Sea coast. From the 1870s onward, intellectuals, scholars and politicians examined the economic and social conditions of Southern Italy (\\"Il Mezzogiorno\\"), a movement known as meridionalismo (\\"Meridionalism\\"). For example, the 1910 Commission of Inquiry into the South indicated that the Italian government thus far had failed to ameliorate the severe economic differences and the limitation of voting rights only to those with sufficient property allowed rich landowners to exploit the poor.Clark. pp. 17 ‚Äì18.  Liberal era of politics (1870‚Äì1914)  Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milano was an architectural work created by Giuseppe Mengoni between 1865 and 1877 and named after the first King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel II. After unification, Italy's politics favored liberalism: the liberal-conservative right (destra storica or Historical Right) was regionally fragmented and liberal-conservative Prime Minister Marco Minghetti only held on to power by enacting revolutionary and left-leaning policies (such as the nationalization of railways) to appease the opposition. = Agostino Depretis = In 1876, Minghetti was ousted and replaced by liberal Agostino Depretis, who began the long Liberal Period. The Liberal Period was marked by corruption, government instability, continued poverty in Southern Italy and use of authoritarian measures by the Italian government. Depretis began his term as Prime Minister by initiating an experimental political notion known as trasformismo (\\"transformism\\"). The theory of trasformismo was that a cabinet should select a variety of moderates and capable politicians from a non-partisan perspective. In practice, trasformismo was authoritarian and corrupt as Depretis pressured districts to vote for his candidates, if they wished to gain favourable concessions from Depretis when in power. The results of the Italian general election of 1876 resulted in only four representatives from the right being elected, allowing the government to be dominated by Depretis. Despotic and corrupt actions are believed to be the key means in which Depretis managed to keep support in Southern Italy. Depretis put through authoritarian measures, such as banning public meetings, placing \\"dangerous\\" individuals in internal exile on remote penal islands across Italy and adopting militarist policies. Depretis enacted controversial legislation for the time, such as abolishing arrest for debt, making elementary education free and compulsory while ending compulsory religious teaching in elementary schools.Smith (1997), pp. 95‚Äì107 The Triple Alliance in 1913, shown in red In 1887, Francesco Crispi became Prime Minister and began focusing government efforts on foreign policy. Crispi worked to build Italy as a great world power through increased military expenditures, advocacy of expansionismSmith (1997), pp. 132‚Äì133 and trying to win the favor of Germany. Italy joined the Triple Alliance which included both Germany and Austria‚ÄìHungary in 1882 and which remained officially intact until 1915. While helping Italy develop strategically, he continued trasformismo and became authoritarian, once suggesting the use of martial law to ban opposition parties.Smith (1997), p. 133 Despite being authoritarian, Crispi put through liberal policies such as the Public Health Act of 1888 and establishing tribunals for redress against abuses by the government.Smith (1997), p. 128 = Francesco Crispi = Francesco Crispi was Prime Minister for a total of six years, from 1887 until 1891 and again from 1893 until 1896. Historian R. J. B. Bosworth says of his foreign policy: Crispi greatly admired the United Kingdom, but was unable to get British assistance for his aggressive foreign policy and turned instead to Germany.Christopher Duggan. \\"Francesco Crispi's relationship with Britain: from admiration to disillusionment\\". Modern Italy (2011) 16#4 pp. 427‚Äì436 Crispi also enlarged the army and navy and advocated expansionism as he sought Germany's favor by joining the Triple Alliance which included both Germany and Austria‚ÄìHungary in 1882. It remained officially intact until 1915 and prevented hostilities between Italy and Austria, which controlled border regions that Italy claimed. Original coat of arms = Colonialism = Francesco Crispi promoted the Italian colonialism in Africa in the late 19th century. Ain Zara oasis during the Italo-Turkish War: propaganda postcard made by the Italian Army In the late 19th and early 20th century, Italy emulated the Great Powers in acquiring colonies, especially in the scramble to take control of Africa that took place in the 1870s. Italy was weak in military and economic resources in comparison with Britain, France and Germany, but it proved difficult due to popular resistance and it was unprofitable due to heavy military costs and the lesser economic value of spheres of influence remaining when Italy began to colonize. Britain was eager to block French influence and assisted Italy in gaining territory of the Red Sea.Agatha Ramm, \\"Great Britain and the Planting of Italian Power in the Red Sea, 1868‚Äì1885,\\" English Historical Review (1944) 59#234 pp. 211‚Äì236 A number of colonial projects were undertaken by the government. These were done to gain support of Italian nationalists and imperialists, who wanted to rebuild a Roman Empire. Italy had already large settlements in Alexandria, Cairo and Tunis. Italy first attempted to gain colonies through negotiations with other world powers to make colonial concessions, but these negotiations failed. Italy also sent missionaries to uncolonized lands to investigate the potential for Italian colonization. The most promising and realistic of these were parts of Africa. Italian missionaries had already established a foothold at Massawa (in present-day Eritrea) in the 1830s and had entered deep into the Ethiopian Empire.Smith (1997), pp. 115‚Äì117. The beginning of colonialism came in 1885, shortly after the fall of Egyptian rule in Khartoum, when Italy landed soldiers at Massawa in East Africa. In 1888, Italy annexed Massawa by force, creating the colony of Italian Eritrea. The Eritrean ports of Massawa and Assab handled trade with Italy and Ethiopia. The trade was promoted by the low duties paid on Italian trade. Italy exported manufactured products and imported coffee, beeswax and hides.H. Ahmad Abdussamad, \\"Trade Relations of Northern Ethiopia with Italian Eritrea 1903‚Äì1935,\\" Africa (1997) 52#3 pp 416‚Äì430 At the same time, Italy occupied territory on the south side of the horn of Africa, forming what would become Italian Somaliland. The Treaty of Wuchale, signed in 1889, stated in the Italian language version that Ethiopia was to become an Italian protectorate, while the Ethiopian Amharic language version stated that the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II could go through Italy to conduct foreign affairs. This happened presumably due to the mistranslation of a verb, which formed a permissive clause in Amharic and a mandatory one in Italian. When the differences in the versions came to light, in 1895 Menelik II abrogated the treaty and abandoned the agreement to follow Italian foreign policy; Italy used this renunciation as a reason to invade Ethiopia.Barclay (1997), p. 34 Ethiopia gained the help of the Russian Empire, whose own interests in East Africa led the government of Nicholas II of Russia to send large amounts of modern weaponry to the Ethiopians to hold back an Italian invasion. In response, Britain decided to back the Italians to challenge Russian influence in Africa and declared that all of Ethiopia was within the sphere of Italian interest. On the verge of war, Italian militarism and nationalism reached a peak, with Italians flocking to the Royal Italian Army, hoping to take part in the upcoming war.Barclay (1973), pp. 33‚Äì34 The Italian and British army failed on the battlefield and were overwhelmed by a huge Ethiopian army at the Battle of Adwa. At that point, the Italian invasion force was forced to retreat into Eritrea. The war formally ended with the Treaty of Addis Ababa in 1896, which abrogated the Treaty of Wuchale recognizing Ethiopia as an independent country. The failed Ethiopian campaign was one of the few military victories scored by the Africans against an imperial power at this time.Raymond Anthony Jonas, The Battle of Adwa: African Victory in the Age of Empire (2011) except and text search China during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy participated as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance forces during the Boxer Rebellion in China. On 7 September 1901, a concession in Tientsin was ceded to the Italy by the Qing Dynasty. On 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by an Italian consul. In 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire and invaded Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica. These provinces together formed what became known as Libya. The war ended only one year later, but the occupation resulted in acts of discrimination against Libyans such as the forced deportation of Libyans to the Tremiti Islands in October 1911. By 1912, one third of these Libyan refugees had died from a lack of food and shelter.Bosworth, RJB (2005) Mussolini's Italy, New Work: Allen Lane, , p. 50 The annexation of Libya led nationalists to advocate Italian domination of the Mediterranean Sea by occupying Greece and the Adriatic Sea coastal region of Dalmazia.Bosworth (2005), p 49 Italian dirigibles bomb Turkish positions in Libya, as the Italo- Turkish War of 1911‚Äì1912 was the first in history in which air attacks (carried out here by dirigible airships) determined the outcome. = Giovanni Giolitti = Giovanni Giolitti was Prime Minister of Italy five times between 1892 and 1921. In 1892, Giovanni Giolitti became Prime Minister of Italy for his first term. Although his first government quickly collapsed one year later, Giolitti returned in 1903 to lead Italy's government during a fragmented period that lasted until 1914. Giolitti had spent his earlier life as a civil servant and then took positions within the cabinets of Crispi. Giolitti was the first long-term Italian Prime Minister in many years because he mastered the political concept of trasformismo by manipulating, coercing and bribing officials to his side. In elections during Giolitti's government voting fraud was common and Giolitti helped improve voting only in well-off, more supportive areas, while attempting to isolate and intimidate poor areas where opposition was strong.Smith, Dennis Mack (1997) Modern Italy; A Political History, Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, , p. 199 Southern Italy was in terrible shape prior to and during Giolitti's tenure as Prime Minister: four-fifths of southern Italians were illiterate and the dire situation there ranged from problems of large numbers of absentee landlords to rebellion and even starvation.Smith (1997), p. 209‚Äì210 Corruption was such a large problem that Giolitti himself admitted that there were places \\"where the law does not operate at all\\".Smith (1997), p. 199 In 1911, Giolitti's government sent forces to occupy Libya. While the success of the Libyan War improved the status of the nationalists, it did not help Giolitti's administration as a whole. The government attempted to discourage criticism by speaking about Italy's strategic achievements and inventiveness of their military in the war: Italy was the first country to use the airship for military purposes and undertook aerial bombing on the Ottoman forces.Bosworth, Richard. (1983). Italy and the Approach of the First World War. London: The Macmillan Press Ltd, p. 42 The war radicalized the Italian Socialist Party: anti-war revolutionaries led by future-Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini called for violence to bring down the government. Giolitti returned as Prime Minister only briefly in 1920, but the era of liberalism was effectively over in Italy. The 1913 and 1919 elections saw gains made by Socialist, Catholic and nationalist parties at the expense of the traditionally dominant Liberals and Radicals, who were increasingly fractured and weakened as a result.  World War I and the failure of the liberal state (1915‚Äì1922)  = Prelude to war and internal dilemma = In the lead-up to World War I, the Kingdom of Italy faced a number of short-term and long-term problems in determining its allies and objectives. Italy's recent success in occupying Libya as a result of the Italo-Turkish War had sparked tension with its Triple Alliance allies, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, because both countries had been seeking closer relations with the Ottoman Empire. In Munich, Germans reacted to Italy's aggression by singing anti-Italian songs.Bosworth (1983), pp. 99‚Äì100 Italy's relations with France were also in bad shape: France felt betrayed by Italy's support of Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War, opening the possibility of war erupting between the two countries.Bosworth (1983), p. 101 Italy's relations with the United Kingdom had also been impaired by constant Italian demands for more recognition in the international stage following the occupation of Libya and its demands that other nations accept its spheres of influence in Eastern Africa and the Mediterranean Sea.Bosworth (1983), p. 112 Italy and its colonial possessions at the time of the outbreak of World War I: the area between British Egypt and the firmly held Italian territories is the region of southern Cyrenaica which was under dispute of ownership between Italy and the United Kingdom. In the Mediterranean Sea, Italy's relations with the Kingdom of Greece were aggravated when Italy occupied the Greek-populated Dodecanese Islands, including Rhodes, from 1912 to 1914. These islands had been formerly controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Italy and Greece were also in open rivalry over the desire to occupy Albania.Bosworth (1983), pp 112‚Äì114 King Victor Emmanuel III himself was uneasy about Italy pursuing distant colonial adventures and said that Italy should prepare to take back Italian- populated land from Austria-Hungary as the \\"completion of the Risorgimento\\".Bosworth (1983), p. 119 This idea put Italy at odds with Austria-Hungary. A major hindrance to Italy's decision on what to do about the war was the political instability throughout Italy in 1914. After the formation of the government of Prime Minister Antonio Salandra in March 1914, the government attempted to win the support of nationalists and moved to the political right.(Clark, 1984. p.180) At the same time, the left became more repulsed by the government after the killing of three anti-militarist demonstrators in June. Many elements of the left including syndicalists, republicans and anarchists protested against this and the Italian Socialist Party declared a general strike in Italy.(Clark, Martin. 1984. Modern Italy: 1871‚Äì1982. London and New York: Longman Group UK Limited. p. 180) The protests that ensued became known as \\"Red Week\\" as leftists rioted and various acts of civil disobedience occurred in major cities and small towns such as seizing railway stations, cutting telephone wires and burning tax-registers. However, only two days later the strike was officially called off, though the civil strife continued. Militarist nationalists and anti-militarist leftists fought on the streets until the Italian Royal Army forcefully restored calm after having used thousands of men to put down the various protesting forces. Following the invasion of Serbia by Austria-Hungary in 1914, World War I broke out. Despite Italy's official alliance to Germany and membership in the Triple Alliance, the Kingdom of Italy initially remained neutral, claiming that the Triple Alliance was only for defensive purposes.Giordano Merlicco, Italy and the Austro‚ÄêSerbian crisis of July 1914, in VVAA, Serbian‚ÄêItalian Relations: History and Modern Times, The Institute of History, Belgrade, 2015, pp. 121‚Äì35 Gabriele D'Annunzio, national poet (vate) of Italy and a prominent nationalist revolutionary who was a supporter of Italy joining action in World War I In Italy, society was divided over the war: Italian socialists generally opposed the war and supported pacificism, while nationalists militantly supported the war. Long-time nationalists Gabriele D'Annunzio and Luigi Federzoni and an obscure Marxist journalist and new convert to nationalist sentiment, future Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, demanded that Italy join the war. For nationalists, Italy had to maintain its alliance with the Central Powers in order to gain colonial territories at the expense of France. For the liberals, the war presented Italy a long-awaited opportunity to use an alliance with the Entente to gain certain Italian-populated and other territories from Austria- Hungary, which had long been part of Italian patriotic aims since unification. In 1915, relatives of Italian revolutionary and republican hero Giuseppe Garibaldi died on the battlefield of France, where they had volunteered to fight. Federzoni used the memorial services to declare the importance of Italy joining the war and to warn the monarchy of the consequences of continued disunity in Italy if it did not: Mussolini used his new newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia and his strong oratorical skills to urge nationalists and patriotic revolutionary leftists to support Italy's entry into the war to gain back Italian populated territories from Austria-Hungary, by saying \\"enough of Libya, and on to Trento and Trieste\\".(Thayer, John A. (1964). Italy and the Great War. Madison and Milwaukee: University of Wisconsin Press. p279) Mussolini claimed that it was in the interests of socialists to join the war to tear down the aristocratic Hohenzollern dynasty of Germany which he claimed was the enemy of all European workers.Thayer, p. 272 Mussolini and other nationalists warned the Italian government that Italy must join the war or face revolution and called for violence against pacifists and neutralists.Thayer, p. 253 Left-wing nationalism also erupted in Southern Italy as socialist and nationalist Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida saw joining the war as essential to relieving southern Italy of the rising cost of bread which had caused riots in the south, and advocated a \\"war of revolution\\".Thayer, p. 254 With nationalist sentiment firmly on the side of reclaiming Italian territories of Austria-Hungary, Italy entered negotiations with the Triple Entente. The negotiations ended successfully in April 1915 when the London Pact was brokered with the Italian government. The pact ensured Italy the right to attain all Italian-populated lands it wanted from Austria-Hungary, as well as concessions in the Balkan Peninsula and suitable compensation for any territory gained by the United Kingdom and France from Germany in Africa. The proposal fulfilled the desires of Italian nationalists and Italian imperialism and was agreed to. Italy joined the Triple Entente in its war against Austria-Hungary. The reaction in Italy was divided: former Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti was furious over Italy's decision to go to war against its former allies, Germany and Austria-Hungary. Giolitti claimed that Italy would fail in the war, predicting high numbers of mutinies, Austro- Hungarian occupation of even more Italian territory and that the failure would produce a catastrophic rebellion that would destroy the liberal-democratic monarchy and the liberal-democratic secular institutions of the state.Clark, Martin. 1984. Modern Italy: 1871‚Äì1982. London and New York: Longman Group UK Limited, p. 184. = Italy's war effort = Generalissimo Luigi Cadorna (the man to the left of two officers to whom he is speaking) while visiting British batteries during World War I The outset of the campaign against Austria‚ÄìHungary looked to initially favor Italy: Austria‚ÄìHungary's army was spread to cover its fronts with Serbia and Russia and Italy had a numerical superiority against the Austro-Hungarian Army. However, this advantage was never fully utilized because Italian military commander Luigi Cadorna insisted on a dangerous frontal assault against Austria‚ÄìHungary in an attempt to occupy the Slovenian plateau and Ljubljana. This assault would put the Italian army not far away from Austria‚ÄìHungary's imperial capital, Vienna. After eleven offensives with enormous loss of life and the final victory of the Central Powers, the Italian campaign to take Vienna collapsed. Upon entering the war, geography was also a difficulty for Italy as its border with Austria‚ÄìHungary was along mountainous terrain. In May 1915, Italian forces at 400,000 men along the border outnumbered the Austrian and Germans almost precisely four to one.Seton-Watson, Christopher. 1967. Italy from Liberalism to Fascism: 1870 to 1925. London: Methuen & Co. Ltd., p. 451. However, the Austrian defenses were strong even though they were undermanned and managed to hold off the Italian offensive.Seton-Watson, p. 451. The battles with the Austro-Hungarian Army along the Alpine foothills in the trench warfare there were drawn-out, long engagements with little progress.Clark, p. 185. Italian officers were poorly trained in contrast to the Austro-Hungarian and German armies, Italian artillery was inferior to the Austrian machine guns and the Italian forces had dangerously low supply of ammunition; this shortage would continually hamper attempts to make advances into Austrian territory. This combined with the constant replacement of officers by Cadorna resulted in few officers gaining the experience necessary to lead military missions.Clark, p. 186. In the first year of the war, poor conditions on the battlefield led to outbreaks of cholera causing a significant number of Italian soldiers to die.Seton-Watson, p. 452 Despite these serious problems, Cadorna refused to back down on the strategy of offense. Naval battles occurred between the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) and the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Italy's warships were outclassed by the Austro-Hungarian fleet and the situation was made more dire for Italy in that both the French Navy and the (British) Royal Navy were not sent into the Adriatic Sea. Their respective governments viewed the Adriatic Sea as \\"far too dangerous to operate in due the concentration of the Austro-Hungarian fleet there\\". Morale fell among Italian soldiers who lived a tedious life when not on the front lines, as they were forbidden to enter theaters or bars, even when on leave. However, when battles were about to occur alcohol was made freely available to the soldiers in order to reduce tension before the battle. In order to escape the tedium after battles, some groups of soldiers worked to create improvized whorehouses.Clark, p. 187. In order to maintain morale, the Italian army had propaganda lectures of the importance of the war to Italy, especially in order to retrieve Trento and Trieste from Austria-Hungary. Some of these lectures were carried out by popular nationalist war proponents such as Gabriele D'Annunzio. D'Annunzio himself would participate in a number of paramilitary raids on Austrian positions along the Adriatic Sea coastline during the war and temporaly lost his sight after an air raid.Seton-Watson, p. 502. Prominent pro-war advocate Benito Mussolini was prevented from giving lecture by the government, most likely because of his revolutionary socialist past. Italian propaganda poster depicting the Battle of the Piave River The Italian government became increasingly aggravated in 1915 with the passive nature of the Serbian army, which had not engaged in a serious offensive against Austria-Hungary for months.Seton-Watson, pp. 452‚Äì453 The Italian government blamed Serbian military inactiveness for allowing the Austro- Hungarians to muster their armies against Italy.Seton-Watson, p. 453 Cadorna suspected that Serbia was attempting to negotiate an end to fighting with Austria-Hungary and addressed this to foreign minister Sidney Sonnino, who himself bitterly claimed that Serbia was an unreliable ally. Relations between Italy and Serbia became so cold that the other Allied nations were forced to abandon the idea of forming a united Balkan front against Austria‚ÄìHungary. In negotiations, Sonnino remained prepared to allow Bosnia to join Serbia, but refused to discuss the fate of Dalmazia, which was claimed both by Italy and by Pan-Slavists in Serbia. As Serbia fell to the Austro-Hungarian and German forces in 1915, Cadorna proposed sending 60,000 men to land in Thessaloniki to help the Serbs now in exile in Greece and the Principality of Albania to fight off the opposing forces, but the Italian government's bitterness to Serbia resulted in the proposal being rejected. In the spring of 1916, Austro- Hungarians counterattacked in the Altopiano of Asiago, towards Verona and Padova, in their Strafexpedition, but were defeated by the Italians. In August, after the Battle of Doberd√≤, the Italians also captured the town of Gorizia; after this, the front remained static for over a year. At the same time, Italy faced a shortage of warships, increased attacks by submarines, soaring freight charges threatening the ability to supply food to soldiers, lack of raw materials and equipment and Italians faced high taxes to pay for the war.Seton-Watson, p. 456. Austro-Hungarian and German forces had gone deep into Northern Italian territory. Finally in November 1916, Cadorna ended offensive operations and began a defensive approach. In 1917, France, the United Kingdom and the United States offered to send troops to Italy to help it fend off the offensive of the Central Powers, but the Italian government refused as Sonnino did not want Italy to be seen as a client state of the Allies and preferred isolation as the more brave alternative.Seton-Watson, pp. 461‚Äì462 Italy also wanted to keep Greece out of the war as the Italian government feared that should Greece join the war on the side of the Allies, it would intend to annex Albania, which Italy claimed.Seton-Watson, p. 463. The Venizelist pro-war advocates in Greece failed to succeed in pressuring Constantine I of Greece to bring Italy into the conflict and Italian aims on Albania remained unthreatened. Members of the Arditi corps in 1918. More than 650,000 Italian soldiers lost their lives on the battlefields of World War I. The Russian Empire collapsed in a 1917 Russian Revolution, eventually resulting in the rise of the communist Bolshevik regime of Vladimir Lenin. The resulting marginalization of the Eastern Front allowed for more Austro- Hungarian and German forces to arrive on the front against Italy. Internal dissent against the war grew with increasingly poor economic and social conditions in Italy due to the strain of the war. Much of the profit of the war was being made in the cities, while rural areas were losing income.Seton- Watson, pp. 468‚Äì469. The number of men available for agricultural work had fallen from 4.8 million to 2.2 million, though with the help of women, agricultural production managed to be maintained at 90% of its pre-war total during the war.Seton-Watson, p. 468. Many pacifist and internationalist Italian socialists turned to Bolshevism and advocated negotiations with the workers of Germany and Austria‚ÄìHungary to help end the war and bring about Bolshevik revolutions. Avanti!, the newspaper of the Italian Socialist Party, declared: \\"Let the bourgeoisie fight its own war\\".Seton-Watson, p. 469. Leftist women in Northern Italian cities led protests demanding action against the high cost of living and demanding an end to the war.Seton-Watson, p. 470. In Milan in May 1917, communist revolutionaries organized and engaged in rioting, calling for an end to the war and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.Seton-Watson, p. 471. The Italian Army was forced to enter Milan with tanks and machine guns to face communists and anarchists who fought violently until 23 May, when the Army gained control of the city with almost 50 people killed (three of which were Italian soldiers) and over 800 people arrested. Armando Diaz, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army since November 1917, halted the Austro-Hungarian advance along the Piave River and launched counter-offensives which led to a decisive victory on the Italian Front. He is celebrated as one of the greatest generals of World War I. After the disastrous Battle of Caporetto in 1917, Italian forces were forced far back into Italian territory as far as the Piave river. The humiliation led to the appointment of Vittorio Emanuele Orlando as Prime Minister, who managed to solve some of Italy's wartime problems. Orlando abandoned the previous isolationist approach to the war and increased coordination with the Allies. The convoy system was introduced to fend off submarine attacks, and allowed Italy to end food shortages from February 1918 onward. Also Italy received more raw materials from the Allies.Seton-Watson, pp. 486 The new Italian chief of staff, Armando Diaz, ordered the Army to defend the Monte Grappa summit, where fortified defenses were constructed; despite numerically inferior, the Italians managed to repel the Austro-Hungarian and German Army. The year 1918 also saw the beginning of official suppression of enemy aliens. The Italian socialists were increasingly suppressed by the Italian government. At the Battle of the Piave River, the Italian Army managed to hold off the Austro- Hungarian and German armies. The opposing armies repeatedly failed afterwards in major battles such as Battle of Monte Grappa and the Battle of Vittorio Veneto. After four days the Italian Army defeated the Austro-Hungarian Army in the latter battle aided by British and French divisions and the fact that the Imperial-Royal Army started to melt away as news arrived that the constituent regions of the Dual Monarchy had declared independence. Austria‚ÄìHungary ended the fighting against Italy with the armistice on 4 November 1918 which ended World War I on this front (one week before the 11 November armistice on the Western front). dropped over Vienna by Gabriele D'Annunzio in 1918 The Italian government was infuriated by the Fourteen Points of Woodrow Wilson, the President of the United States, as advocating national self-determination which meant that Italy would not gain Dalmazia as had been promised in the Treaty of London.Seton-Watson, p. 493 In the Parliament of Italy, nationalists condemned Wilson's fourteen points as betraying the Treaty of London, while socialists claimed that Wilson's points were valid and claimed the Treaty of London was an offense to the rights of Slavs, Greeks and Albanians. Negotiations between Italy and the Allies, particularly the new Yugoslav delegation (replacing the Serbian delegation), agreed to a trade off between Italy and the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which was that Dalmazia, despite being claimed by Italy, would be accepted as Yugoslav, while Istria, claimed by Yugoslavia, would be accepted as Italian.Seton-Watson, p. 495 During the war, the Italian Royal Army increased in size from 15,000 men in 1914 to 160,000 men in 1918, with 5 million recruits in total entering service during the war. This came at a terrible cost: by the end of the war, Italy had lost 700,000 soldiers and had a budget deficit of twelve billion lira. Italian society was divided between the majority pacifists who opposed Italian involvement in the war and the minority of pro-war nationalists who had condemned the Italian government for not having immediately gone to war with Austria‚ÄìHungary in 1914. = Italy's territorial settlements and the reaction = Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando (2nd from left) at the World War I peace negotiations in Versailles with David Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau and Woodrow Wilson (from left) As the war came to an end, Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando met with British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Prime Minister of France Georges Clemenceau and United States President Woodrow Wilson in Versailles to discuss how the borders of Europe should be redefined to help avoid a future European war. The talks provided little territorial gain to Italy because during the peace talks Wilson promised freedom to all European nationalities to form their own nation states. As a result, the Treaty of Versailles did not assign Dalmazia and Albania to Italy as had been promised in the Treaty of London. Furthermore, the British and French decided to divide the German overseas colonies into mandates of their own, with Italy receiving none of them. Italy also gained no territory from the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, despite a proposal being issued to Italy by the United Kingdom and France during the war, only to see these nations carve up the Ottoman Empire between themselves (also exploiting the forces of the Arab Revolt). Despite this, Orlando agreed to sign the Treaty of Versailles, which caused uproar against his government. Civil unrest erupted in Italy between nationalists who supported the war effort and opposed the \\"mutilated victory\\" (as nationalists referred to it) and leftists who were opposed to the war.H. James Burgwyn, The legend of the mutilated victory: Italy, the Great War, and the Paris Peace Conference, 1915‚Äì1919 (1993). Residents of Fiume cheering D'Annunzio and his Legionari in September 1919, when Fiume had 22,488 (62% of the population) Italians in a total population of 35,839 inhabitants Furious over the peace settlement, the Italian nationalist poet Gabriele D'Annunzio led disaffected war veterans and nationalists to form the Free State of Fiume in September 1919. His popularity among nationalists led him to be called Il Duce (\\"The Leader\\") and he used blackshirted paramilitary in his assault on Fiume. The leadership title of Duce and the blackshirt paramilitary uniform would later be adopted by the Fascist movement of Benito Mussolini. The demand for the Italian annexation of Fiume spread to all sides of the political spectrum, including Mussolini's Fascists.Smith (1997), p. 293. D'Annunzio's stirring speeches drew Croat nationalists to his side and also kept contact with the Irish Republican Army and Egyptian nationalists.Bosworth (2005), pp. 112‚Äì113. Italy annexed territories that included not only ethnically-mixed places, but also exclusively ethnic Slovene and Croat places, especially within the former Austrian Littoral and the former Duchy of Carniola. They included one-third of the entire territory inhabited by Slovenes at the time and one-quarter of the entire Slovene population,Cresciani, Gianfranco (2004) Clash of civilisations, Italian Historical Society Journal, Vol. 12, No. 2, p. 4 who was during the 20 years long period of Italian Fascism (1922‚Äì1943) subjected to forced Italianization alongside 25,000 ethnic Germans. According to author Paul N. Hehn, \\"the treaty left half a million Slavs inside Italy, while only a few hundred Italians in the fledgling Yugoslav (i.e. Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes renamed Yugoslavia in 1929) state\\".Hehn, Paul N. (2005) A Low Dishonest Decade: Italy, the Powers and Eastern Europe, 1918‚Äì1939. , Chapter 2, Mussolini, Prisoner of the Mediterranean  Fascist regime (1922‚Äì1943)  = Mussolini in war and postwar = In 1914, Benito Mussolini was forced out of the Italian Socialist Party after calling for Italian intervention against Austria-Hungary. Prior to World War I, Mussolini had opposed military conscription, protested against Italy's occupation of Libya and was the editor of the Socialist Party's official newspaper, Avanti!, but over time he simply called for revolution without mentioning class struggle.Smith (1997), p. 284. Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from Ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies to create his own newspaper, Il Popolo d'Italia, to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war. The Allied Powers, eager to draw Italy to the war, helped finance the newspaper.Clark, p. 183. This publication became the official newspaper of the Fascist movement. During the war, Mussolini served in the Army and was wounded once. Benito Mussolini (second from left) and his Fascist Blackshirts in 1920 Following the end of the war and the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, Mussolini created the Fasci di Combattimento or Combat League. It was originally dominated by patriotic socialist and syndicalist veterans who opposed the pacifist policies of the Italian Socialist Party. The Fascists initially had a platform far more inclined to the left, promising social revolution, proportional representation, women's suffrage (partly realized in 1925) and dividing private property held by estates.Passmore Women, Gender and Fascism, pp. 11‚Äì16.Smith (1997), pp. 284‚Äì286. On 15 April 1919, the Fascists made their debut in political violence, when a group of members from the Fasci di Combattimento attacked the offices of Avanti!. Recognizing the failures of the Fascists' initial revolutionary and left-leaning policy, Mussolini moved the organization away from the left and turned the revolutionary movement into an electoral movement in 1921 named the Partito Nazionale Fascista (National Fascist Party). The party echoed the nationalist themes of D'Annunzio and rejected parliamentary democracy while still operating within it in order to destroy it. Mussolini changed his original revolutionary policies, such as moving away from anti-clericalism to supporting the Roman Catholic Church and abandoned his public opposition to the monarchy.Smith (1997), p. 298. Support for the Fascists began to grow in 1921 and pro-Fascist army officers began taking arms and vehicles from the army to use in counter-revolutionary attacks on socialists.Smith (1997), p. 302. In 1920, Giolitti had come back as Prime Minister in an attempt to solve the deadlock. One year later, Giolitti's government had already become unstable and a growing socialist opposition further endangered his government. Giolitti believed that the Fascists could be toned down and used to protect the state from the socialists. He decided to include Fascists on his electoral list for the 1921 elections. In the elections, the Fascists did not make large gains, but Giolitti's government failed to gather a large enough coalition to govern and offered the Fascists placements in his government. The Fascists rejected Giolitti's offers and joined with socialists in bringing down his government.Bosworth (2005), p. 112. A number of descendants of those who had served Garibaldi's revolutionaries during unification were won over to Mussolini's nationalist revolutionary ideals.(Smith (1997), p. 312. His advocacy of corporatism and futurism had attracted advocates of the \\"third way\\",Smith (1997), p. 312. but most importantly he had won over politicians like Facta and Giolitti who did not condemn him for his Blackshirts' mistreatment of socialists.Smith (1997), p. 315. = March on Rome = Mussolini was initially a highly popular leader in Italy until Italy's military failures in World War II. In October 1922, Mussolini took advantage of a general strike by workers and announced his demands to the government to give the Fascist Party political power or face a coup. With no immediate response, a small number of Fascists began a long trek across Italy to Rome which was known as the \\"March on Rome\\", claiming to Italians that Fascists were intending to restore law and order. Mussolini himself did not participate until the very end of the march, with D'Annunzio being hailed as leader of the march until it was learned that he had been pushed out of a window and severely wounded in a failed assassination attempt, depriving him of the possibility of leading an actual coup d'√©tat orchestrated by an organization founded by himself. Under the leadership of Mussolini, the Fascists demanded Prime Minister Luigi Facta's resignation and that Mussolini be named Prime Minister. Although the Italian Army was far better armed than the Fascist paramilitaries, the Italian government under King Vittorio Emmanuele III faced a political crisis. The King was forced to decide which of the two rival movements in Italy would form the new government: Mussolini's Fascists or the anti-royalist Italian Socialist Party, ultimately deciding to endorse the Fascists.Charles Keserich, \\"The Fiftieth Year of the\\" March on Rome\\": Recent Interpretations of Fascism.\\" History Teacher (1972) 6#1 pp: 135‚Äì142 .Giulia Albanese, \\"Reconsidering the March on Rome,\\" European History Quarterly (2012) 42#3 pp 403‚Äì421. On 28 October 1922, the King invited Mussolini to become Prime Minister, allowing Mussolini and the Fascist Party to pursue their political ambitions as long as they supported the monarchy and its interests. At 39, Mussolini was young compared to other Italian and European leaders. His supporters named him \\"Il Duce\\" (\\"The Leader\\"). A personality cult was developed that portrayed him as the nation's saviour which was aided by the personal popularity he held with Italians already, which would remain strong until Italy faced continuous military defeats in World War II. Upon taking power, Mussolini formed a legislative coalition with nationalists, liberals and populists. However, goodwill by the Fascists towards parliamentary democracy faded quickly: Mussolini's coalition passed the electoral Acerbo Law of 1923, which gave two-thirds of the seats in parliament to the party or coalition that achieved 25% of the vote. The Fascist Party used violence and intimidation to achieve the 25% threshold in the 1924 election and became the ruling political party of Italy. Haile Selassie's resistance to the Italian invasion of Ethiopia made him Man of the Year in 1935 by Time magazine. Following the election, Socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti was assassinated after calling for an annulment of the elections because of the irregularities. Following the assassination, the Socialists walked out of parliament, allowing Mussolini to pass more authoritarian laws. In 1925, Mussolini accepted responsibility for the Fascist violence in 1924 and promised that dissenters would be dealt with harshly. Before the speech, Blackshirts smashed opposition presses and beat up several of Mussolini's opponents. This event is considered the onset of undisguised Fascist dictatorship in Italy, though it would be 1928 before the Fascist Party was formally declared the only legal party in the country. Over the next four years, Mussolini eliminated nearly all checks and balances on his power. In 1926, Mussolini passed a law that declared he was responsible only to the King and made him the sole person able to determine Parliament's agenda. The fact that Mussolini had to pass such a law underscored how firmly the convention of parliamentary rule had been established; as mentioned above, the letter of the Statuto made ministers solely responsible to the King. Local autonomy was swept away; appointed podestas replaced communal mayors and councils. Soon after all other parties were banned in 1928, parliamentary elections were replaced by plebiscites in which the Grand Council nominated a single list of candidates. Mussolini wielded enormous political powers as the effective ruler of Italy. The King was a figurehead and handled ceremonial roles. However, he retained the power to dismiss the Prime Minister on the advice of the Grand Council, on paper the only check on Mussolini's power‚Äîwhich is what happened in 1943. = World War II and the fall of fascism = The Italian Empire (red) before World War II. Pink areas were annexed/occupied for various periods between 1940 and 1943 (the Tientsin concession in China is not shown). When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 beginning World War II, Mussolini publicly declared on 24 September 1939 that Italy had the choice of entering the war or to remain neutral which would cause the country to lose its national dignity. Nevertheless, despite his aggressive posture, Mussolini kept Italy out of the conflict for several months. Mussolini told his son in law Count Ciano that he was personally jealous over Hitler's accomplishments and hoped that Hitler's prowess would be slowed down by Allied counterattack.Smith, 1997. p. 402. Mussolini went so far as to lessen Germany's successes in Europe by giving advanced notice to Belgium and the Netherlands of an imminent German invasion, of which Germany had informed Italy. In drawing out war plans, Mussolini and the Fascist regime decided that Italy would aim to annex large portions of Africa and the Middle East to be included in its colonial empire. Hesitance remained from the King and military commander Pietro Badoglio, who warned Mussolini that Italy had too few tanks, armoured vehicles and aircraft available to be able to carry out a long-term war; Badoglio told Mussolini \\"It is suicide\\" for Italy to get involved in the European conflict.Smith, 1997. p. 405. Mussolini and the Fascist regime took the advice to a degree and waited as France was invaded by Germany before deciding to get involved. As France collapsed under the German Blitzkrieg, Italy declared war on France and Britain on 10 June 1940, fulfilling its obligations of the Pact of Steel. Italy hoped to quickly conquer Savoia, Nizza, Corsica and the African colonies of Tunisia and Algeria from the French, but this was quickly stopped when Germany signed an armistice with the French commander Philippe Petain who established Vichy France which retained control over these territories. This decision by Nazi Germany angered Mussolini's Fascist regime.Smith, 1997. p. 406. Raimondo Montecuccoli, used in many successful battles such as the First Battle of Sirte (1941) and Operation Harpoon (1942) The one Italian strength that concerned the Allies was the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina), the fourth-largest navy in the world at the time. In November 1940, the British Royal Navy launched a surprise air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto which crippled Italy's major warships. Although the Italian fleet did not inflict serious damage as was feared, it did keep significant British Commonwealth naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea. This fleet needed to fight the Italian fleet to keep British Commonwealth forces in Egypt and the Middle East from being cut off from Britain. In 1941 on the Italian-controlled island of Kastelorizo, off of the coast of Turkey, Italian forces succeeded in repelling British and Australian forces attempting to occupy the island during Operation Abstention. In December 1941, a covert attack by Italian forces took place in Alexandria, Egypt, in which Italian divers attached explosives to British warships resulting in two British battleships being severely damaged. This was known as the Raid on Alexandria. In 1942, the Italian navy inflicted a serious blow to a British convoy fleet attempting to reach Malta during Operation Harpoon, sinking multiple British vessels. Over time, the Allied navies inflicted serious damage to the Italian fleet, and ruined Italy's one advantage to Germany. Erwin Rommel meeting Italian General Italo Gariboldi in Tripoli, February 1941 Continuing indications of Italy's subordinate nature to Germany arose during the Greco- Italian War; the British air force prevented the Italian invasion and allowed the Greeks to push the Italians back to Albania. Mussolini had intended the war with Greece to prove to Germany that Italy was no minor power in the alliance, but a capable empire which could hold its own weight. Mussolini boasted to his government that he would even resign from being Italian if anyone found fighting the Greeks to be difficult.Smith, 1997. p. 407. Hitler and the German government were frustrated with Italy's failing campaigns, but so was Mussolini. Mussolini in private angrily accused Italians on the battlefield of becoming \\"overcome with a crisis of artistic sentimentalism and throwing in the towel\\".Smith, 1997. p. 409. To gain back ground in Greece, Germany reluctantly began a Balkans Campaign alongside Italy which resulted also in the destruction of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941 and the ceding of Dalmazia to Italy. Mussolini and Hitler compensated Croatian nationalists by endorsing the creation of the Independent State of Croatia under the extreme nationalist Usta≈°e. In order to receive the support of Italy, the Usta≈°e agreed to concede the main central portion of Dalmazia as well as various Adriatic Sea islands to Italy, as Dalmazia held a significant number of Italians. The ceding of the Adriatic Sea islands was considered by the Independent State of Croatia to be a minimal loss, as in exchange for those cessions they were allowed to annex all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, which led to the persecution of the Serb population there. Officially, the Independent State of Croatia was a kingdom and an Italian protectorate, ruled by Italian House of Savoy member Tomislav II of Croatia, but he never personally set foot on Croatian soil and the government was run by Ante Paveliƒá, the leader of the Usta≈°e. However, Italy did hold military control across all of Croatia's coast, which combined with Italian control of Albania and Montenegro gave Italy complete control of the Adriatic Sea, thus completing a key part of the Mare Nostrum policy of the Fascists. The Usta≈°e movement proved valuable to Italy and Germany as a means to counter Royalist Chetnik guerrillas (although they did work with them because they did not really like the Usta≈°e movement whom they left up to the Germans) and the communist Yugoslav Partisans under Josip Broz Tito who opposed the occupation of Yugoslavia. The Italian Army in Russia fought on the Eastern Front. Under Italian army commander Mario Roatta's watch, the violence against the Slovene civil population in the Province of Ljubljana easily matched that of the Germans with summary executions, hostage-taking and hostage killing, reprisals, internments to Rab and Gonars concentration camps and the burning of houses and whole villages. Roatta issued additional special instructions stating that the repression orders must be \\"carried out most energetically and without any false compassion\\".Giuseppe Piemontese (1946): Twenty-nine months of Italian occupation of the Province of Ljubljana. On page 10. According to historians James WalstonJames Walston (1997) History and Memory of the Italian Concentration Camps , Historical Journal, 40. and Carlo Spartaco Capogeco,Cresciani, Gianfranco (2004) Clash of civilisations, Italian Historical Society Journal, Vol. 12, No. 2, p. 7 the annual mortality rate in the Italian concentration camps was higher than the average mortality rate in Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald (which was 15%), at least 18%. On 5 August 1943, Monsignor Joze Srebnic, Bishop of Veglia (Krk island), reported to Pope Pius XII that \\"witnesses, who took part in the burials, state unequivocally that the number of the dead totals at least 3,500\\". After the war, Yugoslavia, Greece and Ethiopia requested the extradition of 1,200 Italian war criminals for trial, but they never saw anything like the Nuremberg trials because the British government with the beginning of the Cold War saw in Pietro Badoglio a guarantee of an anti-communist post-war Italy.Effie Pedaliu (2004) Britain and the 'Hand-over' of Italian War Criminals to Yugoslavia, 1945‚Äì48. Journal of Contemporary History. Vol. 39, No. 4, Special Issue: Collective Memory, pp. 503‚Äì529 The repression of memory led to historical revisionism in Italy about the country's actions during the war.

In 2003, the Italian media published Silvio Berlusconi's statement that Mussolini merely \\"used to send people on vacation\\".Survivors of war camp lament Italy's amnesia, 2003, International Herald Tribune An Italian \\"AB 41\\" armored car in Egypt In 1940, Italy invaded Egypt and was soon driven far back into Libya by British Commonwealth forces. The German army sent a detachment to join the Italian army in Libya to save the colony from the British advance. German army units in the Afrika Korps under General Erwin Rommel were the mainstay in the campaign to push the British out of Libya and into central Egypt in 1941 to 1942. The victories in Egypt were almost entirely credited to Rommel's strategic brilliance. The Italian forces received little media attention in North Africa because of their dependence on the superior weaponry and experience of Rommel's forces. For a time in 1942, Italy from an official standpoint controlled large amounts of territory along the Mediterranean Sea. With the collapse of Vichy France, Italy gained control of Corsica, Nizza, Savoia and other portions of southwestern France. Italy also oversaw a military occupation over significant sections of southern France, but despite the official territorial achievements, the so-called \\"Italian Empire\\" was a paper tiger by 1942: it was faltering as its economy failed to adapt to the conditions of war and Italian cities were being bombed by the Allies. Also despite Rommel's advances in 1941 and early 1942, the campaign in Northern Africa began to collapse in late 1942. Complete collapse came in 1943 when German and Italian forces fled Northern Africa to Sicilia. By 1943, Italy was failing on every front, by January of the year, half of the Italian forces serving on the Eastern Front had been destroyed,Smith, 1997. p. 412. the African campaign had collapsed, the Balkans remained unstable and demoralised Italians wanted an end to the war.Smith, 1997. p 412‚Äì413. King Victor Emmanuel III urged Count Ciano to overstep Mussolini to try to begin talks with the Allies. In mid-1943, the Allies commenced an invasion of Sicily in an effort to knock Italy out of the war and establish a foothold in Europe. Allied troops landed in Sicily with little initial opposition from Italian forces. The situation changed as the Allies ran into German forces, who held out for some time before Sicily was taken over by the Allies. The invasion made Mussolini dependent on the German Armed Forces (Wehrmacht) to protect his regime. The Allies steadily advanced through Italy with little opposition from demoralized Italian soldiers, while facing serious opposition from German forces.  Civil war (1943‚Äì1945)  Territory of the Italian Social Republic and the \\"South Kingdom\\" By 1943, Mussolini had lost the support of the Italian population for having led a disastrous war effort. To the world, Mussolini was viewed as a \\"sawdust caesar\\" for having led his country to war with ill- equipped and poorly trained armed forces that failed in battle. The embarrassment of Mussolini to Italy led King Victor Emmanuel III and even members of the Fascist Party to desire Mussolini's removal. The first stage of his ousting took place when the Fascist Party's Grand Council, under the direction of Dino Grandi, voted to ask Victor Emmanuel to resume his constitutional powers‚Äìin effect, a vote of no confidence in Mussolini. Days later on 26 July 1943, Victor Emmanuel officially sacked Mussolini as Prime Minister and replaced him with Marshal Pietro Badoglio. Mussolini was immediately arrested upon his removal. When the radio brought the unexpected news, Italians assumed the war was practically over. The Fascist organizations that had for two decades pledged their loyalty to Il Duce were silent‚Äîno effort was made by any of them to protest. The new Badoglio government stripped away the final elements of Fascist government by banning the Fascist Party. The Fascists had never controlled the army, but they did have a separately armed militia, which was merged into the army. The main Fascist organs including the Grand Council, the Special Tribunal for the Defense of the State and the Chambers were all disbanded. All local Fascist formations clubs and meetings were shut down. Slowly, the most outspoken Fascists were purged from office.Martin Clark, Modern Italy: 1871‚Äì1995 (1996) p 299 Three men executed by public hanging in a street of Rimini, 1944 Italy then signed an armistice in Cassabile, ending its war with the Allies. However, Mussolini's reign in Italy was not over as a German commando unit, led by Otto Skorzeny, rescued Mussolini from the mountain hotel where he was being held under arrest. Hitler instructed Mussolini to establish the Italian Social Republic, a German puppet state in the portion of northern and central Italy held by the Wehrmacht. As result, the country descended into civil war; the new Royalist government of Victor Emmanuel III and Marshal Badoglio raised an Italian Co-belligerent Army, Navy and Air Force, which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his new Fascist state, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army. Also, a large anti-fascist Italian resistance movement fought a guerrilla war against the German and RSI forces. Rebels celebrating the liberation of Naples, after the Four days of Naples (27‚Äì30 September 1943) Italian resistance in Ossola, 1944 The RSI armed forces were a combination of Mussolini loyalist Fascists and German armed forces, although Mussolini had little power. Hitler and the German armed forces led the campaign against the Allies and saw little interest in preserving Italy as more than a buffer zone against an Allied invasion of Germany.Smith, 1997. p. 419. The Badoglio government attempted to establish a non-partisan administration and a number of political parties were allowed to exist again after years of being banned under Fascism. These ranged from liberal to communist parties which all were part of the government.Smith, 1997. p. 418. Italians celebrated the fall of Mussolini, and as more Italian territory was taken by the Allies, the Allies were welcomed as liberators by Italians who opposed the German occupation. Life for Italians under German occupation was hard, especially in Rome. Rome's citizens by 1943 had grown tired of the war and upon Italy signing an armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943, Rome's citizens took to the streets chanting \\"Viva la pace!\\" (\\"Long live the peace!), but within hours German forces raided the city and attacked anti- Fascists, royalists and Jews.Wallace, Robert. 1979. World War II: The Italian Campaign. New York: Time-Life Books. p. 36. Roman citizens were harassed by German soldiers to provide them food and fuel and German authorities would arrest all opposition and many were sent into forced labor.Wallace, 1979. p. 36. Rome's citizens upon being liberated reported that during the first week of German occupation of Rome, crimes against Italian citizens took place as German soldiers looted stores and robbed Roman citizens at gunpoint. Martial law was imposed on Rome by German authorities requiring all citizens to obey a curfew forbidding people to be out on the street after 9 p.m. During winter of 1943, Rome's citizens were denied access to sufficient food, firewood and coal which was taken by German authorities to be given to German soldiers housed in occupied hotels. These actions left Rome's citizens to live in the harsh cold and on the verge of starvation.Wallace, 1979. pp. 41‚Äì42. German authorities began arresting able-bodied Roman men to be conscripted into forced labour.Wallace, 1979. p. 45. On 4 June 1944, the German occupation of Rome came to an end as German forces retreated as the Allies advanced. Mussolini was captured on 27 April 1945 by Communist Italian partisans near the Swiss border as he tried to escape Italy. On the next day, he was executed for high treason as sentenced in absentia by a tribunal of the National Liberation Committee. Afterwards, the bodies of Mussolini, his mistress and about fifteen other Fascists were taken to Milan, where they were displayed to the public. Days later on 2 May 1945, the German forces in Italy surrendered. The government of Badoglio remained in being for some nine months. On 9 June 1944, he was replaced as Prime Minister by the 70-year-old anti-fascist leader Ivanoe Bonomi. In June 1945, Bonomi was in turn replaced by Ferruccio Parri, who in turn gave way to Alcide de Gasperi on 4 December 1945. It was De Gasperi who supervised the transition to a republic following the abdication of Vittorio Emanuele III on 9 May 1946. He briefly became acting Head of State as well as Prime Minister on 18 June 1946, but ceded the former role to Provisional President Enrico De Nicola ten days later.  End of the Kingdom of Italy  = Italian constitutional referendum (1946) = Umberto II, the last King of Italy Much like Japan and Germany, the aftermath of World War II left Italy with a destroyed economy, a divided society, and anger against the monarchy for its endorsement of the Fascist regime for the previous twenty years. 1946 referendum Even prior to the rise of the Fascists, the monarchy was seen to have performed poorly, with society extremely divided between the wealthy North and poor South. World War I resulted in Italy making few gains and was seen as what fostered the rise of Fascism. These frustrations compacted into a revival of the Italian republican movement.Robert Katz, The Fall of the House of Savoy: A Study in the Relevance of the Commonplace or the Vulgarity of History (1971) By the spring of 1944, it was obvious Victor Emmanuel was too tainted by his previous support for Mussolini to have any further role. He transferred his constitutional powers to Crown Prince Umberto, whom he named Lieutenant General of the Realm and de facto regent. Victor Emmanuel III nominally remained King until shortly before a 1946 referendum on whether to remain a monarchy or become a republic. On 9 May 1946, he abdicated in favour of the Crown Prince, who then ascended as King Umberto II. However, on 2 June 1946, the republican side won 54% of the vote and Italy officially became a republic. The table of results shows some relevant differences in the different parts of Italy. The peninsula seemed to be drastically cut into two, as if there were two different, respectively homogeneous countries: the North for the republic (with 66.2%); the South for the monarchy (with 63.8%). Some monarchist groups claimed that there was manipulation by northern republicans, socialists and communists. Others argued that Italy was still too chaotic in 1946 to have an accurate referendum. Regardless, to prevent civil war Umberto II accepted the results, and the new republic was born on June 12, with bitter resentment by the new government against the House of Savoy. All male members of the House of Savoy were barred from entering Italy in 1948, which was only repealed in 2002.

It is located on the Tilligerry Peninsula between Lemon Tree Passage and Tanilba Bay. The origin of the name may mean \\"three swamps\\" in the local Aboriginal language. Geography Mallabula is a low-lying suburb, almost at sea level. It is bisected by Lemon Tree Passage Road, which stretches for the full length of the peninsula, from Salt Ash in the south-west, to Lemon Tree Passage. In the northern part of the suburb is a small subdivision covering on the banks of Tanilba Bay. Tanilba Bay from Mallabula showing the beaches typical of both suburbs The beach consists mainly of sand flats that are exposed at low tide and almost completely covered at high tide preventing the beach from being useful as either a swimming or surfing beach. Near Rookes Point, at the mouth of Tanilba Bay, the land rises to a height of AMSL. At the eastern extremity of this area the land reaches a peak of in a heavily forested area. However, between these two points and throughout the remainder of the suburb the land is generally no more than AMSL and is predominantly sandy. The land south of Lemon Tree Passage Road is generally uninhabited, occupied only by a handful of homes in a single cul-de-sac and a sewage treatment plant.

Facts  Ramnarine Khelawon was accused of aggravated assault, uttering a death threat, assault causing bodily harm, and assault with a weapon. The offences involved five residents of a nursing home, in which Khelawon worked as a registered nurse. Four of the alleged victims died before trial from unrelated causes. The fifth was found incompetent to testify. Two of the deceased complainants, Mr. Skupien and Mr. Dinino, had given videotaped statements to police, concerning the alleged incidents. Since the declarants were deceased, the videotaped statements became hearsay, and the issue for the trial judge was whether or not the statements were reliable enough to be admitted.  Courts below  The trial judge, Grossi J, \\"...held that the hearsay statements from each of the complainants were sufficiently reliable to be admitted in evidence, based in large part on the 'striking' similarity between them\\". Khelawon was convicted. The Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed Khelawon's appeal. Rosenberg JA (Armstrong JA concurring) rejected the statements, while Blair JA (dissenting) would have admitted the statements and dismissed the appeal. The Crown sought leave to appeal to the SCC to restore Khelawon's convictions. Leave to appeal was allowed in respect of Mr. Skupien's statement, but denied in respect of Mr. Dinino's statement.  Supreme Court of Canada  Charron J delivered the SCC's unanimous decision. The Court held that Mr. Skupien's statement was inadmissible, as it was not sufficiently reliable. In delivering the Court's decision, Charron J rendered a major alteration to the threshold reliability branch of the principled approach, effectively overruling this portion of R v Starr. In particular, the bar Starr erected on the use of corroborative evidence in the threshold reliability assessment no longer applies. Instead of categorizing reliability factors into discreet, non-mutually exclusive threshold and ultimate stages, courts should now \\"adopt a more functional approach... and focus on the particular dangers raised by the hearsay evidence sought to be introduced and on those attributes or circumstances relied upon by the proponent to overcome those dangers\\". In effect, trial judges may now consider evidence going beyond the circumstances under which the statement was made at the threshold reliability stage, which includes corroborative and/or conflicting evidence.

Since retiring he would move into management where he returned to Guangzhou FC as an assistant before becoming their manager for a short spell. Playing career Wu Qunli was born in the Baiyun District within Guangzhou and would join second tier football club Guangzhou FC within the 1983 league season. He would soon see his club win promotion to the top tier at the end of the 1984 league season, via the Chinese FA Cup. The following season would see him called up to the Chinese national team for the first time where he would become a regular before playing with the senior team in the 1988 Summer Olympics. By the 1990 league season Guangzhou FC were in the second tier, however Wu made sure this was short lived and aided the club to a runners-up position and promotion back up to the top tier, this wouldn't go unnoticed and he personally won the Chinese footballer of the year award.

It was formerly considered that there was a single species of Hepsetus pike characin but recent studies have led to the species being split and Hepsetus odoe sensu stricto is the west African representative of the group. Description It is an elongated fish with a pike-like body, however this species is a characin and the pike resemblance is due to convergent evolution. This species can reach up to about in length. The back is normally dark brown or green while the belly is silver. The head is normally light green or brown with distinct dark brown or black stripes radiating out from the eye. The colour and pattern of adult fish is relatively stable but juveniles are more variable. Distribution Hepsetus odoe is found in western sub-Saharan Africa, from the Sassandra River in the Cote d'Ivoire in the west to the Shari River in the Central African Republic in the east, and southwards up to the Kienke River in Cameroon. Biology The species prefers quiet and deep water, and may only live about five years. Spawning normally begins in August and continues until January. Although in some locations there is an extended spawning season which lasts until May. The eggs are laid in a bubble nest, which they then guard until the young have attached themselves to the bottom of the nest, at which stage the adults abandon the nest and their young. The nest breaks up about four days afterwards and the juveniles disperse to live in well-vegetated marginal habitats. Hepsetus odoe is piscivorous and preys on a variety of smaller fish. It is mainly diurnal and is an ambush predator, waiting among dense submerged or emergent vegetation until prey comes within range and the fish can lunge at it. The diet of Hepsetus odoe consists predominantly of cichlids and mormyrids; although smaller individuals have been recorded eating mochokid catfishes more than cichlids or mormyrids. Hepsetus odoe prefers the upper courses of small rivers where the elongate tigerfish (Hydrocynus forskahlii) is absent or less abundant. It uses weeds and vegetation along with its coloring to avoid detection. Human use Hepsetus odoe is a gamefish. It also, on occasion, is found as an aquarium fish, though its large size and piscivorous nature make it unsuitable for most aquarists.Nelson, Joseph S. (2006). Fishes of the World. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Taxonomy It was formerly believed to the only species in the genus and widespread in sub- Saharan Africa, but studies in 2011-2013 have found that there are several species, and the true H. odoe is restricted to West and Central Africa from the Sassandra River, Ivory Coast, to the Kienk√© River, Cameroon (species elsewhere are now recognized as separate; H. cuvieri, H. kingsleyae, H. lineata and H. occidentalis).Decru, E., Vreven, E. & Snoeks, J.

He was the mayor of West Valley City, Utah between 2010 and 2014. A Republican, he currently represents District 30 in the Utah House of Representatives, a position to which he was first elected in November 2016. He is the author of twelve published books on Utah and LDS history, including Presidents and Prophets: The Story of America's Presidents and the LDS Church. He has received criticism in the press for using false identities and undisclosed pseudonyms for city promotion, for a political attack, and for editing of the Wikipedia article about him. Education and family Winder was born in Salt Lake City, Utah and graduated from Taylorsville High School. From 1995 to 1997 he was a missionary in Taipei, Taiwan for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He holds a Masters in Business Administration and an Honors B.A. degree in History from the University of Utah. He has also completed an executive leadership program with Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Winder is married to Karyn Hermansen, who was elected to the Granite School District Board of Education in November 2014. They have four children. Business career Winder was Business Development Manager for West Valley City from 2000‚Äì2004, during which time he also chaired the Chamber West Economic Development Committee. From 2004-2009 he was vice president of marketing for Winder Farms. He was director of public affairs for The Summit Group Communications from 2009‚Äì2011. Winder founded Neptune Strategies in 2012, a marketing and development firm. During the 2016 election cycle, Neptune Strategies was paid at least $65,000 for consulting by Friends of Traditional Banking, a Super PAC. Winder is the executive director of Friends of Traditional Banking. Since July 2014, Winder has been employed as director of entrepreneurship programs for Zions Bank. Political career Winder has served as a member of the state and Salt Lake County Republican Party Executive Committees, deputy campaign manager for Congressman James V. Hansen, and chair of the Research and Policy Committee for the Jon Huntsman, Jr. for Governor campaign. He is the founder of the GenX GOP Network. He was elected to an at-large seat on the West Valley City Council in November 2005 with 71% of the vote over 12-year incumbent Barbara Thomas. He was elected on November 3, 2009 as the seventh mayor of West Valley City, Utah, with 76% of the vote; his opponent was Kevin Fayles. At 29, he was the youngest council person in city history, and when sworn in on January 4, 2010, at age 33, he became the youngest mayor in city history. In 2012, Winder and former county council member Mark Crockett emerged from the Salt Lake County Republican Convention field of six to face off for the GOP nomination for county mayor. Crockett narrowly defeated Winder in the GOP primary election, 50.7% to 49.3%. In 2016, Winder ran for the Utah State House of Representatives, defeating his Democratic opponent. He was sworn in as a member of the Utah State House of Representatives on January 1, 2017. Author and historian An historian, he is the author of twelve published books on Utah and LDS history, including Presidents and Prophets: The Story of America's Presidents and the LDS Church. In 2005, Winder was appointed by Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. to a four-year term on the Utah Board of State History, and reappointed in 2009. In 2012, he was appointed by Governor Gary Herbert to a four-year term on the Advisory Board for the Office of Museum Services. Winder presented an academic paper as part of the Abraham Lincoln Sesquicentennial in 2009 and was published in the Journal of the Theodore Roosevelt Association in 2011. As mayor in 2012, he also authored the first photographic history of West Valley City for Arcadia Publishing. Winder is a past president of the Utah British Isles Association. Controversies In 2011, Winder wrote articles promoting West Valley City for the Deseret News and KSL.com under the assumed name \\"Richard Burwash\\". The name was a pseudonym inspired by a 16th-century ancestor of Winder's. In the articles, Winder quoted himself as mayor. Winder confessed to the use of a pseudonym and said he wrote the articles because he was \\"frustrated that the newspaper had drastically reduced its city government coverage after layoffs last year but not its crime coverage and wanted to try to restore balance.\\" Winder accepted a reprimand by the West Valley City Council, resigned from his job with a public relations firm, and issued a public apology to his constituents. In 2017, he sent robocalls to display a false source phone number in telephone caller ID systems, causing it to appear that the calls were coming from the cell phone of the leader of Americans for Prosperity (AFP). AFP had sent out attack mail that falsely criticized Winder's stance on an issue that never came before a vote on the House floor. This practice, known as \\"spoofing\\", is illegal.

Note that the well is cross-shaped; most of the Sundays of the Pentecostarion deal with the subject of water, a reference to Baptism. The Pentecostarion (Greek: Œ†ŒµŒΩœÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÅŒπŒøŒΩ, Pentekost√°rion; Slavonic: –¶–≤—£—Ç–Ω–∞—ß –¢—Ä—óœâ–¥—å, Tsvyetnaya Triod' , literally \\"Flowery Triodon\\"; ) is the liturgical book used by the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches during the Paschal Season which extends from Pascha (Easter) to the Sunday following All Saints Sunday (i.e., the Second Sunday After Pentecost). The name means the Book of the \\"Fifty Days\\", referring to the period of time from Pascha to Pentecost. In Greek, it is also sometimes called the Joyful Pentecostarion (Œ†ŒµŒΩœÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÅŒπŒøŒΩ œáŒ±œÅŒºœåœÉœÖŒΩŒøŒΩ, Pentekost√°rion Charm√≥synon). In English, it is sometimes called the Paschal Triodion. The name \\"Pentecostarion\\" is also applied to the liturgical season covered by the book. The Pentecostarion is part of the Paschal cycle or \\"Moveable Cycle\\" of the ecclesiastical year. This cycle is dependent upon the date of Pascha and continued throughout the coming year until the next Pascha. Pascha (Easter) is the most important feast of the entire year, outranking by far all others. Each week of the Pentecostarion is named after the Gospel lesson which is read on the Sunday which begins it; for instance, the week that follows Thomas Sunday is referred to as Thomas Week. During the liturgical season of the Pentecostarion, the Gospel of John is read in full, as is the Acts of the Apostles. Both of these books were chosen because of their instructive content. Pascha (Easter) is the traditional time for baptizing new converts to the faith. So, just as Great Lent, with its liturgical book, the Triodion, was the final period of preparation for the catechumens before their baptism, so the time of the Pentecostarion is the time of initiation into the Sacred Mysteries of the Christian religion for the \\"Newly Illumined\\" (i.e., the newly baptized). The two Sacred Mysteries of baptism and chrismation are reflected in the two feasts which mark the beginning and ending points of the Pentecostarion: Pascha and Pentecost. Baptism is naturally tied to the Resurrection, according to the Apostle Paul (, , ). Chrismation, the reception of the Gifts of the Holy Spirit is naturally reflected in Pentecost. Because of this, the imagery of water figures prominently in the hymns of the Pentecostarion., p. 7 The services of the Pentecostarion begin during the Paschal Vigil starting at the stroke of midnight on Easter Sunday. The service for Pascha is radically different from the services of any other time of the year. Throughout the course of the Pentecostarion, they gradually return to normal (see Canonical hours and Divine Liturgy). Afterfeast of Pascha The Afterfeast of Pascha lasts for 40 days, beginning on the Sunday of Pascha and concluding with the Apodosis (\\"leave-taking\\") of Pascha on the day before the Ascension of the Lord. =Bright Week= The seven days beginning on the Sunday of Pascha are referred to as \\"Bright Week\\" or \\"Renewal Week\\". On these days the services are completely different that the rest of the year. Everything is chanted rather than being simply read. Most of the services are much shorter than usual. Even the Divine Liturgy, which normally has little variation in it, has a number of changes which are particular to the Paschal celebration. The Little Hours are chanted in a special format known as the Paschal Hours. The reading of the Psalter, which normally forms a major portion of all of the Daily Offices, is completely omitted. In the temple (church building), the Holy Doors on the iconostasis are left open for the entire week, symbolizing the open Tomb of Christ, and the Epitaphion (shroud) is visible on the Holy Table (altar), representing the burial cloths () which, according to Christian tradition, bore witness to the Resurrection of Jesus. The Paschal Artos (Greek: √ÅœÅœÑŒøœÇ, \\"leavened loaf\\") is a loaf of risen bread bearing an icon of the Resurrection on it, which is blessed near the end the Paschal Vigil. It is then is placed either near the Icon of Christ on the iconostasis or in the nave of the church. The Artos represents the physical presence of Jesus after his Resurrection, and is venerated by the faithful when they enter or leave the temple as a way of greeting the Resurrected Christ. At the end of either Matins or the Divine Liturgy, there is often a crucession (procession headed by the cross), during which the Paschal Canon is chanted, and the priest blesses with holy water. Unique to Vespers and Matins during Bright Week is the use of the singing of the verse of Psalm 67 responsorially with the Paschal Troparion in place of the usual Psalm 104 at Vespers and the Hexapsalms at Matins. Only on Bright Friday are the Paschal hymns joined to another commemoration, that of the icon of the Theotokos, \\"Life-giving Spring\\". On all of the other days of Bright Week, only the Resurrection may be celebrated. Exceptions are made for the feast day of a local patron saint, or for important feast days such as Saint George, which may be combined with the paschal celebration. If it becomes necessary to celebrate a funeral during Bright Week, even this service is radically different, and follows for the most part the format for Paschal Matins, with only a few funeral hymns being chanted. =Thomas Sunday= The Sunday which follows Pascha (the Second Sunday of Pascha) is called \\"Thomas Sunday\\", because it recounts the appearance of Jesus to the Apostle Thomas eight days after his resurrection (). Thomas Sunday is also called \\"Antipascha\\" (literally, \\"in the place of Pascha\\") because those who for honorable reason were not able to attend the Paschal Vigil, may attend services on this day instead. In middle Greek \\"anti\\" Pascha also means \\"enter\\" Pascha. Pascha is a unique feast in the church year; being the \\"Feast of Feasts\\" it follows a format unlike any other day. Those liturgical elements normal to a Great Feast of the Lord which were displaced by Pascha's unique elements are instead chanted on Thomas Sunday. Radonitza Radonitza (Russian: \\"Day of Rejoicing\\"), is a day of commemoration of the departed. Because the celebration of any memorial service for the departed is forbidden from Holy Thursday through Thomas Sunday, a popular tradition has arisen of visiting the graves of departed loved ones and chanting memorial services on the first day this is permitted. There are no special hymns appointed in the Pentecostarion for Radonitza, and nothing different is done in the Daily Office. However, after the Divine Liturgy, it is customary for the faithful to visit cemeteries and serve memorial services, and to give alms in the name of the departed. It is not unusual for families to bring a picnic with them to the cemeteries, which would include paschal foods, especially Easter eggs. Some people leave Easter eggs on the graves of their beloved departed as a way of giving the Paschal greeting to the departed, and as a sign of their belief in the resurrection of the dead. =Sunday of the Myrrhbearers= The Third Sunday of Pascha is dedicated to the 'Myrrhbearing Women' (the Theotokos, Mary Magdalene, and the other women who brought spices to the Tomb of Jesus) and also to Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, who cared for the burial of Jesus after his crucifixion. The placement of this feast is based upon the idea of the synaxis, wherein secondary persons directly involved in the events celebrated in one of the feasts are celebrated on the day after. However, since Bright Week is devoted exclusively to the celebration of the Resurrection, and Thomas Sunday falls logically on the eighth day of the Resurrection (according to its biblical source), this day becomes the first Sunday on which these persons can be commemorated. =Sunday of the Paralytic= The Sunday of the Paralytic is the Fourth Sunday of Pascha, and recalls Jesus' healing of the Paralytic, as recounted in the Gospel reading for the day: . The theme for this Sunday is the man who lay by the Sheep's Pool in Jerusalem for thirty-eight years. The first one to enter the pool after an angel troubled the water would be healed of his infirmities; but because the man was paralyzed, someone else always entered the pool before him. According to the Gospel account, Jesus had pity on the man, seeing he had no one to put him into the pool, and healed him. The Kontakion for this day asks Christ to raise up the souls of the faithful, \\"paralyzed by sins and thoughtless acts.\\" The underlying symbolism of the feast is that mankind, being unable to raise itself from the fall by its own will or power, needed \\"some man\\" (i.e., the Son of Man, the Messiah) to come and raise it up. The feast of the Paralytic is unusual in the Pentecostarion in that it does not last a full week, but ends on the day before Mid- Pentecost. Mid-Pentecost The Wednesday following the Sunday of the Paralytic is the Feast of Mid-Pentecost This is a \\"feast within a feast\\", and propers of the Resurrection are combined with propers for Mid-Pentecost. The hymns of the feast speak of it drawing together the themes of Pascha and Ascension. The Apodosis (leave-taking) of Mid-Pentecost comes one week later, on the following Wednesday. =Sunday of the Samaritan Woman= The Sunday of the Samaritan Woman is the Fifth Sunday of Pascha, commemorating the Woman by the well, (traditionally known as Photina in Greek or Svetlana in Russian), as recounted in the Gospel reading for the day: . Like the Paralytic, the Samaritan Woman is commemorated only on Sunday and half the week (in this case, the second half), the first half of the week being dedicated to the afterfeast of Mid-Pentecost. =Sunday of the Blind Man= The Sixth Sunday of Pascha is the Sunday of the Blind Man, commemorating Jesus' healing of the man born blind (), recounted in the Gospel lesson for this day's Divine Liturgy. The Pentecostarion's theme of water is continued by the fact that Jesus sent the man to wash the clay from his eyes in the Pool of Siloam (the name 'Siloam' is interpreted as \\"sent\\", implying that the blind man's cure was bestowed for his obedience to Jesus). The miracle of the blind man (traditionally named Celidonius) is remarkable in two respects: firstly, that although there are other accounts in both the Old Testament and the New of the blind having their sight restored, this is the only time someone born blind was given sight for the first time. Although the biblical text does not explicitly say so, the hymns in the Pentecostarion follow the traditional interpretation that not only was this man born without sight, he was born even without eyes. Jesus' act of making clay is an act of creation (creating eyes where none were before), a repetition of the first act of the creation of man in . This indicates the traditional Christian teaching that in the act of salvation Jesus makes his disciples a \\"new creation\\" (). The second remarkable aspect of the miracle is that not only did Jesus give the man physical sight, but he bestowed upon him spiritual sight as well. In the blind man's dialogue with the Pharisees, he holds his own in the dispute, engaging in reasoned theological discourse as though he were educated. These three Sundays of the Paralytic, of the Samaritian Woman and of the Blind Man are characterized by their reference to the Sacrament of Baptism, each illustrating a different dimension or aspect of the Sacrament. Apodosis of Pascha The Week of the Blindman is the last week in the Afterfeast of Pascha, and the Apodosis of Pascha is the final day of the Paschal celebration. There are currently two different practices with regard to the celebration of the Apodosis of Pascha. According to the older practice, hymns of the Resurrection are chanted together with those for the Aposdosis of the Blind Man on Wednesday. According to the more modern practice in the Greek Orthodox Church (those following the \\"Typicon of the Great Church\\") the Apodosis of the Blind Man is chanted on Tuesday, while all of the services of Wednesday (Vespers on Tuesday evening; Matins, Little Hours and Divine Liturgy on Wednesday morning) are chanted in the special Paschal form that was used during Bright Week. Ascension The Great Feast of the Ascension falls on the 40th day after Pascha (inclusive), always on a Thursday. The feast is celebrated with an All-Night Vigil starting on Wednesday evening. The Epitaphion (shroud), which had been on the Holy Table since the Paschal Vigil, is removed before the beginning of this service as an indication that the Ascension marked the end of Jesus' physical presence with his disciples after the Resurrection. The Afterfeast of Ascension lasts for eight days until the Apodosis on the following Friday. =Sunday of the Holy Fathers= The Seventh Sunday of Pascha, which falls during the Afterfeast of the Ascension, commemorates the Holy Fathers of the First Ecumenical Council (325 AD). In addition to defending Christianity against Arianism, the Council also passed a number of canons concerning church discipline, and also decreed that the date for celebrating Pascha both be reckoned independently from the Jewish Passover and be uniform throughout the world. (http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-27.htm) . The hymns and readings in the Pentecostarion are very rich in drawing out relevant symbolism from biblical texts. The Epistle for the Divine Liturgy is from and . The Gospel is from . =Saturday of the Dead= The Seventh Saturday of Pascha, the day before Pentecost, is a Saturday of the Dead, on which the church commemorates all of the faithful departed \\"who in ages past have reposed in a godly manner, in hope of the resurrection of eternal life.\\"Pentecostarion, op. cit., p. 383. Two Epistles (, ) and two Gospels (, ) are appointed to be read at the Divine Liturgy. On this day, the readings from Acts and the Gospel of St. John, which began on Pascha, are concluded. Traditionally, St. John Chrysostom's homily \\"On Patience and Gratitude\\" is appointed to be read in church (the same homily is also appointed for funerals). Since the Apodosis of the Ascension fell on the previous day, there are no hymns appointed for this day which speak of either the Ascension or of Pentecost. Instead, the hymns are devoted to prayer for the dead. The prokeimenon at Vespers and God is the Lord at Matins are replaced by Alleluia, and a number of structural changes are made to the services following the pattern of the Saturdays of the Dead which fall during Great Lent. A general Panikhida (memorial service) is served either after Vespers or after the Divine Liturgy, and the Ektenia (litany) for the Departed is chanted at the Liturgy. Pentecost Pentecost is the second most important feast of the church year, second in importance only to Pascha itself. The Great Feast lasts for seven days, with its Apodosis falling on the following Saturday. It is celebrated with an All-Night Vigil on the Eve of the Feast and Divine Liturgy on the day of the Feast. An extraordinary service called the Kneeling Prayer, is served on the night of Pentecost. This is a Vespers service to which are added three sets of long poetical prayers, the composition of Saint Basil the Great, during which everyone makes a full prostration, touching their foreheads to the floor (prostrations in church having been forbidden from the day of Pascha up to this point). The churches are decorated with greenery, and among the Russians the clergy and faithful carry flowers and green branches in their hands during the services. Pentecost is a traditional time for baptisms. The week prior to the feast is known as \\"green week\\", during which all manner of plants and herbs are gathered. The Sunday of Pentecost is called \\"Trinity Sunday,\\" the next day is called \\"Monday of the Holy Spirit\\", and Tuesday of Pentecost week is called the \\"Third Day of the Trinity.\\"Trinity Week - 3rd Day of the Trinity The whole week following Pentecost is an important ecclesiastical feast, and is a fast-free week, during which meat and dairy products may be eaten, even on Wednesday and Friday. Theologically, the Orthodox do not consider Pentecost to be the \\"birthday\\" of the Church; they see the Church as having existed before the creation of the world (cf. The Shepherd of Hermas).The Shepherd of Hermas, Migne, Patrologia Graecae, 35:1108‚Äì9. The Orthodox icon of the feast depicts the Twelve Apostles seated in a semicircle (sometimes the Theotokos (Virgin Mary) is shown sitting in the center of them). At the top of the icon, the Holy Spirit, in the form of tongues of fire, is descending upon them. At the bottom is an allegorical figure, called Kosmos, which symbolizes the world. Although Kosmos is crowned with glory he sits in the darkness caused by the ignorance of God. He is holding a towel on which have been placed 12 scrolls, representing the teaching of the Twelve Apostles. =Day of the Holy Spirit= The Monday of the Holy Spirit, also called Whit Monday or Pentecost Monday, falls on the day after Pentecost Sunday. This day commemorates the Holy Spirit's role in the feast of Pentecost. Churches named after the Holy Spirit and, in Western Christianity, those named after the Holy Trinity, commemorate their feast on this day (In Eastern Christianity, churches named after the Holy Trinity, commemorate their feast on Pentecost Sunday). All Saints Sunday The First Sunday After Pentecost is dedicated to the commemoration of All Saints. The next day (Monday) is the beginning of the Apostles' Fast. This is a unique fast in that it is of variable duration, beginning on the moveable calendar, but ending on the fixed calendar feast day of the Apostles Peter and Paul on June 29 (for those churches which follow the Julian Calendar June 29 falls on July 12 of the modern Gregorian Calendar). While all of the Orthodox Churches celebrate Pascha on the same day (with the exception of the Finnish Orthodox Church, which follows the Western Paschalion), some churches follow the traditional Julian Calendar (\\"Old Calendar\\") and some follow the Revised Julian Calendar (\\"New Calendar\\") which uses the modern Gregorian Calendar to calculate their fixed feasts. Since there is currently a difference of thirteen days between the two calendars, the Apostles' Fast will be almost two weeks shorter for New Calendar churches, or in some years non-existent. All Saints of Local Church All-Saints of Local Commemoration. This will differ from one national church to another. For instance, in Romania, the commemoration will be \\"All Saints of Romania\\", on Mount Athos the commemoration will be \\"All Saints of the Holy Mountain\\", etc. In the Orthodox Church of America, the commemoration is \\"All Saints of America\\". Different traditions In the edition of the Pentecostarion used by the Old Believers and those who follow the Ruthenian recension, the contents of the Pentecostarion begin with the service of Palm Sunday and contain the services of Holy Week.

It was the first novel by Pelevin, who until then was known for his short stories. Pelevin traces the absurd fate of the protagonist Omon, named by his policeman father (after OMON, Soviet and Russian special police forces, pronounced \\"Amon\\"), placing him in circumstances that are both fantastic and at the same time have recognizable everyday detail. Pelevin uses this story to illustrate the underlying absurdity of the Soviet establishment with its fixation on \\"heroic achievements\\", especially in those fields of human endeavor which could be favorably presented to the outside world‚Äîscience, the military, and most significantly space exploration. The book met with a significant success in the early post-Soviet cultural landscape and continues to be reprinted.

In 1993 the book was awarded with two literary prizes, the \\"Interpresson\\" and the \\"Bronze Snail\\". Plot summary The book is narrated in the first person. It is a coming-of-age story, or Bildungsroman. The protagonist is Omon Krivomazov, who was born in Moscow post-World War II. The plot traces his life from early childhood. In his teenage years, the realization strikes him that he must break free of Earth's gravity to free himself of the demands of the Soviet society and the rigid ideological confines of the state. After finishing high school, he immediately enrolls in a military academy. Omon soon finds that the academy does not, in fact, create future pilots, but instead exposes cadets to a series of treacherous trials, beginning with the amputation of both of their feet. The goal of the trials is to manifest Soviet heroism in the cadets. These amputations come as a reference to a famous Soviet ace-pilot Alexey Maresyev, who, despite being badly injured in a plane crash after a dogfight, managed to return to Soviet-controlled territory on his own. During his 18-day-long journey, his injuries deteriorated so badly that both of his legs had to be amputated below the knee. Desperate to return to his fighter pilot career, he subjected himself to nearly a year of physical therapy and exercise to master control of his prosthetic devices. He succeeded and returned to flying in June 1943. Before any intentional amputation can occur, Omon and his friend are whisked out of the academy into a top-secret installation, located under KGB headquarters in Moscow. There, they start preparing for an \\"unmanned\\" mission to the Moon. Omon is told that to substitute for researching, building and launching an automated probe, the Party prefers to use people, trained for \\"heroism\\", to fulfill the tasks nominally performed by machines, such as rocket stage separation, space vehicle course correction and so on. Soon Omon indeed seems to be launched to the Moon, strapped into a seat inside a Lunokhod, which he is meant to drive like a bicycle on the lunar surface. He is the final piece in a multi-stage mission to deliver a radio beacon to a specific point on the Moon and activate it. This he does, even though once he leaves the confines of the hermetically sealed Lunokhod, his protection against the vacuum and the interstellar cold consists of a cotton-filled overcoat and \\"special hydrocompensatory tampons\\"Plevin, Victor. Omon Ra. New Directions. 1998. 137. stuffed up his nose. However, when the time comes for Omon to shoot himself after he places the beacon, according to his orders, the gun he was given for the purpose misfires. Omon finds himself not on the Moon at all, but in an abandoned subway tunnel, where he had been driving his Lunokhod all along, ignoring all signs which might have given him a clue as to his real whereabouts. He tries to escape and is chased and shot at, but he manages to find his way into the \\"normal\\" world again, coming up into one of the stations of the Moscow Metro. One of Omon's \\"teachers\\" explains the idea behind the charade: even if the fact that the Soviet Union is a champion of peaceful space exploration holds true only inside a person's head (namely, the hero's; no one knows of him or his mission apart from its organizers), this is not any different from it being the reality. The reality, when it concerns subjects not capable of being experienced, is in fact only a perception formed in people's consciousness, and can be manipulated to the extent that the question of \\"true\\" version of events becomes meaningless. Title The title, Omon Ra, refers to the main character's given and chosen names. Omon's first name comes from the acronym for a branch of the Russian police force. It was given to him by his father. Ra is an allusion to the Egyptian Sun god, whose body is human and whose head is that of a falcon. Omon bestowed this surname upon himself, inspired by the fact that the word falcon was sometimes applied to cosmonauts and heroes. Ra is connected with the Egyptian myth of the sun orbiting the earth, which connects to Omon's obsession with spaceflight. Later, Ra becomes his call sign for the lunar mission. Together these names relate to Omon's dream of flight and the absurd military system he must go through to achieve it. Major characters ;Omon Ra (Omon Krivomazov): Raised by the Soviet apparatus due to his apathetic aunt and absent father, Omon dreams of becoming a cosmonaut. He enters the Soviet space program and is selected for a special program. ;Mitiok: Omon's friend, who also dreams of going into space. He was executed after the \\"reincarnational test\\" which revealed that he had been a Nazi officer in his previous life. ;Colonel Urchagin: Blind and paralysed graduate of the military political academy named after Pavel Korchagin, the protagonist of the novel How the Steel was Tempered (his injury is the reference to the author of the novel Nikolai Ostrovsky, who also became blind and paralysed due to his illness). Idealistic leader of the space program. Tells Omon that ‚Äújust one pure soul is enough for the banner of triumphant socialism to be unfurled on the surface of the distant moon.‚ÄùPlevin, Victor. Omon Ra. New Directions. 1998. 150. Themes Throughout much of the novel, Pelevin establishes space travel as a metaphor for maturation and heroism as one for responsibility. In the beginning of the novel, Omon straddles the boundary between childhood and adulthood. He yearns to become a cosmonaut and a hero; however, when he has the opportunity to do so, he realizes that heroism is nothing but a glorified illusion. Although children believe that the world holds an infinite number of opportunities for adults, they eventually learn that the responsibility adults have is extremely constraining rather than liberating.

It was staged from 1996 to 1998 at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club Ground. The series consisted of 5 ODIs, and all the matches were played in daylight. Pakistan won the first series 3‚Äì2 in 1996. India won 4‚Äì1 in 1997. Pakistan again won 4‚Äì1 in 1998. A total of 15 matches were played over a span of 3 years. Pakistan have been more successful amongst the two, with a total of 8 victories. India have 7 victories. The series was a five-year agreement by both the PCB and the BCCI, with the International Management Group (IMG). Trans World International (TWI) and ESPN had telecast rights. The series had gained good popularity in the cricketing arena, just like the Sharjah cup - where two arch-rivals met at a neutral venue. However, the series was later called off after Sahara India - the sponsors - pulled out in the wake of the Pakistani intrusion in Kashmir in 1999. The diplomatic relations between the two countries considerably worsened during the Kargil war in 1999, and further, India suspended all cricketing ties with Pakistan from 2000 until 2004.

It is described by Yoshifumi Hashimoto, producer of the Harvest Moon/Story of Season series, as \\"Harvest Moon where you wield a sword.\\" Common gameplay elements The gameplay of the Rune Factory series is similar to that of Harvest Moon/Story of Season. For every one real-world second, one in-game minute passes. The player can grow crops, using upgradeable farm equipment. However, the Harvest Moon game mechanic of purchasing animals has been replaced by defeating and befriending monsters in dungeons. If a monster is tamed, it can help the player in battle, produce goods, or help to tend the crops. The game's combat is in the action role- playing game style. Like most Harvest Moon/Story of Season games, the player is given a limited amount of stamina, in the form of \\"Rune Points\\", or \\"RP\\". Rune Points get depleted as the player performs tasks at the farm or fights using a weapon or skills. The player is given hit points as well. The player can attack with no RP by sacrificing HP. The player can replenish RP by using Runes created by fully-grown crops or potions, while HP can be restored using medicine or healing abilities. The town bathhouse restores both HP and RP. If the player runs out of HP while working on their farm, they will collapse and be rescued; however, in Rune Factory and Rune Factory 2, dying outside the town causes game over. In all other games, the player will not die while fighting in the caves or ruins. Crops can be planted in different areas to sell for gold; other activities include mining for metal and minerals, fishing, or collecting food such as milk and eggs from befriended monsters. The player can then spend money and material to buy a variety of upgrades for their house, weapons, and tools. In addition to their open-ended gameplay, the games possess a linear storyline, which can be furthered by exploring dungeons and defeating certain monsters. Just like in the Harvest Moon series, the main character's relationship with the other villagers increase by talking to them or performing actions that please them, like giving items they like as presents for example. Some of them can even be married if their relationship improves enough. Some games of the series require the protagonist to get married as part of the storyline.

This was done in order to grow Rune Factory as an independent series and Marvelous will continue to do this with all future installments including Rune Factory Frontier. Despite this, Natsume applied the subtitle A Fantasy Harvest Moon to Rune Factory 2 and Rune Factory 3. Rune Factory Frontier was announced during an interview between Cubed3 and Yasuhiro Wada on June 6, 2007, and was fully revealed on June 4, 2008 in the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. On July 11, 2008, Marvelous Entertainment USA and Xseed Games announced that they were both bringing Rune Factory Frontier to North America. Rune Factory Frontier released in the NA region on March 17, 2009. Rune Factory 5 was said to be expected at \\"some point in time\\", according to series producer Yoshifumi Hashimoto. In November 2013, Neverland Co. filed for bankruptcy, leaving the future of the series in question at the time. However, in February 2014 it was revealed that the Rune Factory development team had been hired by Marvelous AQL, and that they were developing the Nintendo 3DS simulation role-playing video game Lord of Magna: Maiden Heaven. In February 2019, during the 13.02.19 Nintendo Direct, Rune Factory 5 was once again confirmed to be in development by Hakama, a new studio founded by Hashimoto. In September 2020, during a Nintendo Direct Mini presentation the game's release date was slated for Spring 2021 in Japan and later in the same year worldwide. Media Rune Factory 2 has had multiple manga series to help promote the game, in such magazines as Dengeki Nintendo DS, Monthly Wings, Dragon Age, and Dengeki Maoh. If players pre-ordered the game in Japan, they would receive a free CD with three mini-dramas as well as an 18-page art book. Sometime after the release of the game in Japan, a CD with all the background music, three mini-dramas, and the two theme songs was released with a novel based on the game following sometime after. The American pre-order bonus was a plush Chipp, a monster in the series similar in appearance to a squirrel, that was included in the box when ordered from participating websites. Reception The Rune Factory series has been well received. Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest Moon received an 8.4 rating from IGN's Mark Bozon. Bozon commented that the art style was \\"amazing\\", and that it was \\"the Harvest Moon you've been waiting for\\". 7/10 from Nintendo Power, and 4/5 from X-Play. IGN rated Rune Factory 2: A Fantasy Harvest Moon at 8.4/10, commenting on its similarity to the original.

It exists in a number of different versions, none of which are considered either canonical or normative within rabbinic literature, but which appear to have been widely circulated in Europe and the Middle East in the medieval period. A 15th-century Yemenite work of the same was titled Maaseh Yeshu, or the \\"Episode of Jesus\\" in which Jesus is described either as being the son of Joseph, or the son of Pandera. The account portrays Jesus as an impostor. The story is that Jesus (Yeshu) was an illegitimate child, and that he practiced magic and heresy, seduced women, and died a shameful death. But they also show a paradoxical respect for Jesus. As Joseph Dan notes in the Encyclopedia Judaica, \\"The narrative in all versions treats Jesus as an exceptional person who, from his youth, demonstrated unusual wit and wisdom, but disrespect toward his elders and the sages of his age.\\" Dan, Joseph, \\"Toledot Yeshu\\" in Encyclopaedia Judaica, 2nd ed. (2007) Robert Van Voorst calls the Toledot a record of popular polemic \\"run wild\\". The Toledot's profane portrayal of the person Christians consider divine has provided material for antisemitic polemics. Up until the early 21st century, with only a few exceptions, mainstream Jewish and Christian scholars, paid little attention to the Toledot.Van Voorst. p. 123 The opinion of Father Edward H. Flannery is representative: > This scurrilous fable of the life of Jesus is a medieval work, probably > written down in the tenth century. .... Though its contents enjoyed a > certain currency in the oral traditions of the Jewish masses, it was almost > totally ignored by official or scholarly Judaism. Anti-Semites have not > failed to employ it as an illustration of the blasphemous character of the > Synagogue.\\"Flannery, Edward H., The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-three > centuries of Anti-Semitism (1965, NY, Macmillan) page 283 (footnote 30 to > chapter 2). This disregard has recently been lifting as the text becomes discussed as a possible window into the early history of polemic between Christians and Jews.*Meerson, Michael, and Peter Sch√§fer. Toledot Yeshu : The life story of Jesus. Texts and Studies in Ancient Judaism ; 159. Tubinger: Mohr Siueck, 2014. Contents: Vol.1, Introduction and translation Composition and dating Recent scholarship has drawn increased attention to the date of origin of the Toledot Yeshu; the early layers are considered to have been manufactured orally. The first textual proof consists of fragments of Aramaic manuscripts discovered in Cairo. A recent study reports that more than 100 manuscripts of the Toledot exist, almost all of them late medieval (the oldest manuscript being from the 11th century).Ben Ezra, Daniel Stokl, An Ancient List of Christian Festivals in Toledot Yeshu, Harvard Theological Review, vol. 102, nr. 4 (Oct. 2009) pages 483-484. The earliest stratum of composition was probably in Aramaic. There are recensions extant in Hebrew, and later versions in Judeo-Persian and Arabic, as well as in Yiddish and Ladino (Judeo-Spanish). The date of composition cannot be ascertained with certainty and there are conflicting views as to what markers denote dates. For instance, the Toledot refers to Christian festivals and observances that only originated after the 4th century.Ben Ezra, Daniel Stokl, An Ancient List of Christian Festivals in Toledot Yeshu, Harvard Theological Review, vol. 102, nr. 4 (Oct. 2009) p. 488; also, Leiman, Sid Z., The Scroll of Fasts: The Ninth of Tebeth, Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. n.s. 74, nr. 2 (Oct. 1983) p.186-188, p.195. See also Van Voorst, ‚Äò‚Äôop. cit.‚Äô‚Äô, p.122, 127. However, in his Incredible Shrinking Son of Man Robert M. Price states that the Toledot Yeshu is \\"dependent on second- century Jewish-Christian gospel\\",Price, Robert (2003) Incredible Shrinking Son of Man pg 40 and Alexander argues that the oral traditions behind the written versions of the Toledot Yeshu might go all the way back to the formation of the canonical narratives themselves.Alexander, P. ‚ÄòJesus and his Mother in the Jewish Anti-Gospel (the Toledot Yeshu)‚Äô, in eds. C. Clivaz et al., Infancy Gospels, T√ºbingen: Mohr Siebeck GmbH & Co. KG, 2011, pp. 588-616. It is unlikely that one person is the author, since the narrative itself has a number of different versions, which differ in terms of the story details and the attitude towards the central characters. Even individual versions seem to come from a number of storytellers. Some scholars assert that the source material is no earlier than the 6th century, and the compilation no earlier than the 9th century.Worth, Roland H., Jr., Alternative Lives of Jesus: Noncanonical accounts through the early Middle Ages (2003, NC, McFarland & Co.) pages 49-50; also, Dan, Joseph, \\"Toledot Yeshu\\" in Encyclopaedia Judaica (2nd ed. 2007, Farmington Hills, Mich., Macmillin Reference USA) page 29; \\"The complete narrative, which could not have been written before the tenth century, used earlier sources ....\\". Although individual anecdotes that make up the Toledot Yeshu may all come from sources dating before the sixth century, there is no evidence that their gathering into a single narrative is that early.Klausner, Joseph, Jesus of Nazareth: His life, times, and teaching (orig. 1922, Engl. transl. 1925, London, George Allen & Unwin) pages 52-53 (\\"The present Hebrew Tol'doth Yeshu, even in its earliest form, ... was not composed before the tenth century\\"). Some scholars, like Jeffrey Rubenstein, favour a later composition date, posterior to the seventh century.Jeffrey L. Rubenstein, Stories of the Babylonian Talmud‚Äô‚Äô (2010), p 272: \\"There is not one shred of evidence that Toledot Yeshu existed in written form in Babylonian in the seventh century, as Gero claims it did, nor that the Bavli knew it.\\" The earliest known mention is an oblique mention by Agobard, archbishop of Lyon, circa. 826, and then another mention by his successor, Amulo, circa 849.Agobard of Lyons, De Iudaicis Superstitionibus, cited in Van Voorst, op. cit. Schonfield, Hugh J., According to the Hebrews (1937, London: Duckworth) pages 29-30. However, since Agobard does not refer to the source by name it cannot be certain that this is the Toledot.See Klausner, Joseph, Jesus of Nazareth: His life, times, and teaching (London: George Allen & Unwin, 1925), page 53 note. The source material for the Toledot can be said to derive from four sources: (1) Jewish rabbinic literature; (2) canonical Christian scriptures; (3) noncanonical Christian writings; (4) pagan anti-Christian writings of the Roman period. The largest source of input to the Toledot seems to be anecdotes gathered from various parts of the Talmud and Midrash.E.g., the Talmudic references in Division 1.A of Herford, R. Travers, Christianity in Talmud and Midrash (1903, London; reprinted 1966, NJ, Reference Book Publ'rs) pages 35-96 https://archive.org/details/christianityinta00herfuoft . These appear to be popular adaptations of material aimed against two Christian doctrines: the virgin birth and the ascension. Some of the Talmudic anecdotes are clearly fictitious or absurd, and some seem incompatible with each other or with known historical fact.Klausner, Joseph, Jesus of Nazareth: His life, times, and teaching (orig. 1922, Engl. transl. 1925, London, George Allen & Unwin) pages 26 & 51 (\\"the book contains no history worth the name\\"), as an example. In some instances, the Talmudic source of the Toledot is very obscure or of doubtful authenticity, and may not originally have been relevant to Jesus.For example, the \\"nativity\\" account in chapter 1 of the Strassburg version of the Toledot is derived from Kallah, a purported Talmudic tractate whose provenance is so uncertain that it did not appear in print until 1864. (See Herford, R. Travers, Christianity in Talmud and Midrash (London, 1903) pages 487-50; Strack, H.L., & Stemberger, G., Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1991) page 250; Klausner, Joseph, Jesus of Nazareth: His life, times, and teaching (London: George Allen & Unwin, 1925) page 52.) Moreover, the anecdote in Kallah may not refer to Jesus at all (See Schonfield, Hugh J., According to the Hebrews (London: Duckworth, 1937) page 222; Herford, op.cit, page 49; and Klausner, op.cit., page 31. Significantly, the Toledot seems to know (though sometimes only superficially) of the miracles of the canonical Gospels, and does not deny their occurrence, but instead attributes them to Yeshu's use of Egyptian magic, or his appropriation of the Ineffable Name (the Divine Name), but not to diabolical incantations.Concurrences with the gospel accounts include the fact that Jesus's parents were named Joseph and Mary; that he was born in Bethlehem; that he was bold toward the Jewish elders; that he could perform miracles (here made out to be sorcery); that he claimed to be born of a virgin; that he claimed to be the Son of God; that he applied Isaiah 7:14 to himself; that he raised the dead; that he healed a leper; that Jews fell down and worshipped him; that he entered Jerusalem upon an ass; that he applied to himself Zacharias 9:9; that he charged the Jews with being stiff-necked people; that he applied to himself the 2nd and 110th Psalms; that he walked on water; that he was betrayed by Judas; that he was scourged, crowned with thorns, and given vinegar to drink; that he was put to death on the Passover and buried before the Sabbath began; and that his twelve apostles spread a story of his resurrection. Trachtenberg, Joshua, The Devil and the Jews (1961, Philadelphia, Jewish Publ'n Society) page 230 (footnote 11 to chapter 4). Some of the anecdotes recounted in the Toledot seem to have been drawn from non- canonical early Christian writings known as apocryphal gospels, datable to the 4th ‚Äì 6th centuries CE.e.g., the Strassburg version of Toledot tells the story that Yeshu, using magic, made clay birds come to life and fly. This closely resembles a story about the young Jesus found in the apocryphal ‚ÄúInfancy gospel of Thomas‚Äù and ‚ÄúInfancy gospel of pseudo-Matthew‚Äù. See Schonfield, Hugh J., According to the Hebrews (London: Duckworth, 1937), page 43; James, M.R., The Apocryphal New Testament (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924), pages 49, 55, and 76; Mead, George R.S., Did Jesus Live 100 BC? (London: Theosophical Publ'g Society, 1903), pages 264-265. For other examples see Baring-Gould, Sabine, The Lost and Hostile Gospels: an essay on the Toledoth Jeschu, and the Petrine and Pauline Gospels of the first three centuries of which fragments remain (London, 1874), pages 103-104. The attribution of Yeshu's paternity to a soldier named Pandera or Pantera can be traced to the second-century Greek philosopher Celsus,Cited by Origen, Contra Celsus 1.32 though Celsus himself may have picked up this detail from a Jewish source. Jews apparently polemicised actively against the new Christian religion, as can be inferred from the 2nd century Christian writer Justin Martyr's Dialogue with Trypho, a fictional dialogue between a Christian and a Jew. In chapter 17 Justin claims that the Jews had sent out \\"chosen men\\" throughout the Roman Empire to polemicize against Christianity, calling it a \\"godless heresy\\".Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho ch. 17. One early version of the Toledot Yeshu gave a milder description of Christianity. It did not cast aspersions on the characters of Mary and Jesus, instead it sought to undermine the tenets of the Christian faith. The goal was to seek the return of apostates to the Jewish fold. To Tartakoff it seems that the Toledot may have been modified by Jews to fit into specific situations. Christian response From the 9th through the 20th centuries the Toledot has inflamed Christian hostility towards Jews.Schonfield, Hugh J., The History of Jewish Christianity, (1936, London, Duckworth) page 129. In 1405, the Toledot was banned by Church authoritiesCarmilly-Weinberger, Moshe, Censorship and Freedom of Expression in Jewish History (1977, NY, Yeshiva Univ. Press) pages 185-186. A book under this title was strongly condemned by Francesc Eiximenis (d. 1409) in his Vita Christi. but in 1614 it was largely reprinted by a Jewish convert to Christianity, Samuel Friedrich Brenz, in Nuremberg, as part of his book vilifying his former religion, titled \\"Skin Shed by the Jewish Snake\\".Carmilly-Weinberger, Moshe, Censorship and Freedom of Expression in Jewish History (1977, NY, Yeshiva Univ. Press) page 186. An indirect witness to the Christian condemnation of the book can be found in one manuscript of the Toledot, which has this cautionary note in its introduction: > [This booklet] should be shown only to people of discretion, for one never > knows what the morrow may bring. ... I copied it from three different > pamphlets from three different countries, not just one, The contents of all > these pamphlets were identical, except that I wrote it in the language of > prudence [- namely, Hebrew, because Gentiles do not understand it].Carmilly- > Weinberger, Moshe, Censorship and Freedom of Expression in Jewish History > (1977, NY, Yeshiva Univ. Press), page 185 (quoting a reprint in Krauss). Martin Luther quoted the Toledot (evidently the Strassburg version) at length in his general condemnation of Jews in his book Vom Schem Hamphoras in 1543.Falk, Gerhard, The Jew in Christian Theology: Martin Luther's anti-Jewish Von Schem Hampharos, previously unpublished in English, and other milestones in church doctrine concerning Judaism (1992, Jefferson, NC, McFarland) 296 pages. In the two centuries after Luther, the Toledot reached the height of its fame and was well sought after by scholars and travelers alike. In 1681 Professor Johann Christoph Wagenseil published an entire volume devoted to refuting the Toledot. Attitudes towards the work became more diversified during the Age of Enlightenment. Historiography =Ram√≥n Mart√≠ version= Long unknown to Christians, the Toledot was first translated into Latin by Ram√≥n Mart√≠, a Dominican friar, toward the end of the 13th century. =Wagenseil version, 1681= Among the versions of the Toledot, the version published by Johann Christian Wagenseil is perhaps the most prominent. In 1681 Wagenseil, a professor at the University of Altdorf, published a Hebrew text of the Toledot Yeshu with a Latin translation, in a book titled \\"Satan's Flaming Arrow\\" (Tela Ignea Satanae).Carmilly-Weinberger, Moshe, Censorship and Freedom of Expression in Jewish History (1977, NY, Yeshiva Univ. Press) page 185. The first section treats Jesus's life; later sections deal with the exploits of his apostles. Supplementary chapters tell of Nestorius and his attempts to keep Christians obeying Jewish custom, and the story of Simeon Kepha who is construed to be the Apostle Peter or Paul. Jesus is portrayed as a deceiver and a heretic, showing a connection to the traditions in Celsus and Justin Martyr (see above). Summary of Wagenseil version A great misfortune struck Israel in the year 3651 (c. 90 BCE). A man of the tribe of Judah, Joseph Pandera, lived near a widow who had a daughter called Miriam. This virgin was betrothed to Yohanan, a Torah-learned and God-fearing man of the house of David. Before the end of a certain Sabbath, Joseph looked lustfully at Miriam, knocked on her door and pretended to be her husband, but she only submitted against her will. When Yohanan came later to see her, she was surprised how strange his behavior was. Thus they both knew of Pandera's crime and Miriam's fault. Without witnesses to punish Pandera, Yohanan left for Babylonia. Miriam gave birth to Yeshua, whose name later depreciated to Yeshu. When old enough, she took him to study the Jewish tradition. One day he walked with his head uncovered, showing disrespect, in front of the sages. This betrayed his illegitimacy and Miriam admitted him as Pandera's son. Scandalised, he fled to Upper Galilee. Yeshu later went to the Jerusalem Temple and learned the letters of God's ineffable name (one could do anything desired by them). He gathered 310 young men and proclaimed himself the Messiah, claiming Isaiah‚Äôs ‚Äúa virgin shall conceive and bear a son‚Äù and other prophets prophesied about him. Using God's name he healed a lame man, they worshipped him as the Messiah. The Sanhedrin decided to arrest him, and sent messengers to invite him to Jerusalem. They pretended to be his disciples to trick him. When he was brought, bound, before Queen Helen, the sages accused him of sorcery. When he brought a corpse to life, she released him. Accused again, the queen sent for his arrest. He asked his disciples not to resist. Using God's name he made birds of clay and caused them to fly. The sages then got Judah Iskarioto to learn the name. At a contest of miracles between the two, they both lost knowledge of the name. Yeshu was arrested and beaten with pomegranate staves. He was taken to Tiberias and bound to a synagogue pillar. Vinegar was given to him to drink and a crown of thorns was put on his head. An argument broke out between the elders and Yeshu followers resulting in their escape to Antioch (or Egypt). On the day before the Passover, Yeshu decided to go to the Temple and recover the secret name. He entered Jerusalem riding on an ass, but one of his followers, Judah Iskarioto, told the sages he was in the Temple. On a day before the Passover, they tried to hang him on a tree; using the name, he caused it (and any tree they should use) to break. A cabbage stalk, not being a tree, was used successfully to hang him on, and he was buried. His followers on Sunday told the queen that he was not in his grave, that he ascended to heaven as he had prophesied. As a gardener took him from the grave, they searched it and could not find him. But the gardener confessed he had taken it to prevent his followers from stealing his body and claiming his ascension to heaven. Recovering the body, the sages tied it to a horse's tail and took it to the queen. Convinced he was a false prophet, she ridiculed his followers and commended the sages.Van Voorst. pp. 123‚Äì6. =Strassburg Manuscript= In the Strassburg Manuscript, Mary was seduced by a soldier called Ben Pandera. The child Jesus shows great impudence by appearing bareheaded and disputing the Law with teachers. The miracle working powers of Jesus are attributed to having stolen the Name of God from the Temple. Jesus claims messianic dignity and is accused of sorcery by the Jews in front of Queen Helena of Jerusalem, but Jesus raises a man from the dead in front of the Queen's eyes and is released. Jesus goes to Galilee where he brings clay birds to life and makes a millstone float. (Klausner notes that the Toledot scarcely ever denies Gospel miracles, but merely changes good to evil.Klausner, Joseph, Jesus of Nazareth: His life, times, and teaching (orig. 1922, Engl. transl. 1925, London, George Allen & Unwin) page 51.) Judas Iscariot, the hero of the tale, learns the Divine Name as well, and Jesus and Judas fly through the sky engaged in aerial combat, with Judas victorious. The now powerless Jesus is arrested and put to death by being hung upon a carob tree, and buried. The body is taken away and his ascension is claimed by his apostles on the basis of the empty tomb. But Jesus's body is found hidden in a garden and is dragged back to Jerusalem and shown to Queen Helena. =Huldreich version, 1705= A third major recension was published by Johann Jacob Huldreich (or Huldrich) in Leyden, Holland, in 1705, with a Latin translation, as Historia Jeschuae Nazareni by \\"Johannes Jocabus Huldricus\\". This was based on a Hebrew manuscript, now lost, and has its own unique variants.Schonfield, Hugh J., According to the Hebrews (1937, London: Duckworth) page 31. A summary of it is presented by Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould, The Lost and Hostile Gospels (1874, London) pages 102-115, who surmised (because of some of the errors and anecdotes) that it was of medieval German origin, perhaps not even predating Martin Luther (page 115). Baring-Gould noted (pages 69‚Äì71) that the Wagenseil version contains historical references that place its 'Yeshu' at least a century before the Jesus and Pontius Pilate of the New Testament, and the Huldrich version contains references that place its 'Yeshu' at least a full century after the time of the Gospels. =Krauss compilation, 1902= Samuel Krauss reprinted a version recounting that Miriam had been betrothed to a nobleman by the name of Yochanan, who was both a descendant of the House of David, and a God-fearing Torah scholar. In Yochanan's absence her neighbor, Yosef ben Pandera forced himself upon her,Later Slavonic versions portray Mary as active in the adulterous affair. Schafer, Op cit. coercing her into an act of sexual intercourse during her Niddah (i.e., menstruation, a period of ritual impurity during which relations are forbidden according to Jewish Law). The fruit of the affair was a son she named Yeshu, \\"the bastard son of a menstruate woman.\\" Krauss's book, Das Leben Jesu nach juedischen Quellen, published in Berlin in 1902, contained a study of nine different versions of the Toledot, and remains the leading scholarly work in the field (but has not yet been translated into English). Krauss's work has been joined by \\"Meerson, Michael, and Peter Sch√§fer. Toledot Yeshu : The life story of Jesus. Texts and Studies in Ancient Judaism ; 159. Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2014\\" which contains English translations of several versions of the Toldoth Yeschu and lists all of the known manuscripts (as of 2014). =English versions= The first translation into English seems to date from 1874, when Sabine Baring-Gould published The Lost and Hostile Gospels, which included lengthy summaries of two versions of the Toledot ‚Äì one called the Wagenseil and one called the Huldreich (so named from the editor of a 1705 Latin edition) - as well as quotations and descriptions of apocryphal and lost gospels of early Christian history. He regarded the Toledot as being a kind of early anti-Christian folklore, largely motivated by the oppression suffered by Jews.https://archive.org/details/lostandhostileg00barigoog Baring-Gould, Sabine, The Lost and Hostile Gospels: an essay on the Toledoth Jeschu, and the Petrine and Pauline Gospels of the first three centuries of which fragments remain (London, 1874). The Wagenseil Toledoth is summarized on pages 76-101, the Huldreich version summarized on pages 102-115. In 1903, G.R.S. Mead, a well known Theosophist, published Did Jesus Live 100 BC?, which treated the Toledoth Yeshu as sufficiently authentic and reliable to postulate, on the basis of its mention of historic figures such as Queen Helene, that Jesus actually lived a century earlier than commonly believed.Mead, George R.S., Did Jesus Live 100 BC? (1903, London, Theosophical Publ'g Society) 440 pages, the Toledoth text (primarily from Strassburg ms) on pages 258-280; https://archive.org/details/didjesuslive100b00meaduoft . Baring-Gould (page 71) notes that, although the Wagenseil version named the Queen as Helene, she is also expressly described as the widow of Alexander Jannaeus, who died BCE 76, and whose widow was named Salome Alexandra and she died in BCE 67. In 1937, the Jewish New Testament scholar Hugh J. Schonfield published According to the Hebrews, which theorized that the Toledot was considerably more ancient than commonly thought and may have originally been derived from the Gospel of the Hebrews, a lost (and presumably heretical) book mentioned by name, but not otherwise described, in some early Christian literature.Schonfield, Hugh J., According to the Hebrews (1937, London: Duckworth) 272 page, the Toledoth text (primarily from the Stassburg ms) on pages 35-61. However, scholarly consensus generally sees the Toledot as an unreliable source for the historical Jesus.According to Van Voorst, \\"It may contain a few older traditions from ancient Jewish polemics against Christians, but we learn nothing new or significant from it\\". However, Jane Schaberg contends that the Toledot lend weight to the theory that Mary conceived Jesus as the result of being raped. See Van Voorst, ‚Äò‚Äôop. cit.‚Äô‚Äô These books provided translations of the Toledot. Mead included some indelicate verses which Schonfield edited out, but Schonfield was the more erudite scholar, and he identified Talmudic and Islamic passages that may have supplied the content of the Toledoth.

Founded in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1961 as the Association des Universit√©s Partiellement ou Enti√®rement de Langue Fran√ßaise (AUPELF),Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, History the AUF is a multilateral institution supporting co-operation and solidarity among French- speaking universities and institutions. It operates in French-speaking and non-speaking countries of Africa, the Arab world, Southeast Asia, North and South America and the Caribbean, Central, Eastern and Western Europe. The AUF has 944 members (public and private universities, institutes of higher education, research centers and institutions, institutional networks, and networks of university administrators) distributed throughout francophone countries on six continents. It is active in 104 countries, and represented by regional offices and information centers on campuses and in institutes. The Association receives funding from the OIF, and its headquarters are located at the Universit√© de Montr√©al, Quebec. History =Origins= In 1959, Jean- Marc L√©ger (Canadian journalist at Le Devoir) and Andr√© Bachand (public- relations director at the University of Montreal) voiced the idea of a worldwide organisation which would create a link between French-speaking universities. On 13 September 1961 in Montreal, some 150 representatives of the French-speaking world created the foundation of what would become Association des Universit√©s Partiellement ou Enti√®rement de Langue Fran√ßaise (AUPELF),Agence francophone pour l‚Äôenseignement sup√©rieur et la recherche French for the \\"Association of Partially or Entirely French-speaking Universities.\\" =Expansion= In 1987 during the heads of state summit in Quebec, an \\"exchange university\\" project was implemented under the name UREF (Universit√© des R√©seaux d'Expression Fran√ßais, University French Expression Networks). Its purpose was to create a university network for research and education. In November 1993, AUPELF became AUPELF-UREF. In April 1998 in Beirut, AUPELF-UREF became the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie.Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, History =Reforms= To answer the Moncton action plan's request, the AUF undertook reforms in three fields in 1999: * Modification of its status * Administration * Programmes In 2005 the AUF endowed a four-year program to meet the goals and priorities of the decennial strategic agreement of the institutional French-speaking world. This agreement, adopted in 2004 by member states of the French-speaking world, sets the principles and strategies of the institutional French-speaking world and controls its activities.Agence canadienne de d√©veloppement international Structure The association is composed of seven bodies: *General assembly: Main body of the AUF. Every four years, the 774 members of the association gather to decide goals and strategy for the four next years. It oversees the board of directors. *Association council: Enhances solidarity among higher- education and research institutions of the association, encouraging them to pursue relevant objectives *Board of directors: The management body, comprising university and government representatives *Scientific council: Decides the methodology of AUF programs and ensures their academic quality. Its members are selected for their technical and professional skills in culture, science and technology. *President: Elected by the general assembly for a single four-year term, they head the association council and board of directors. *Rector: Elected by the board of directors for a four-year term, their primary function is to implement financial commitments by higher- education and research institutions. *University development and co-operation fund: Administered by the rector Activities The primary activities of the AUF are distributed among four scientific administrations,Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, Scientific Departments each aiming at a specific goal. These four branches are: *Language and communication: Supports French-language development through instruction in the scientific disciplines; promotes multilingualism and cultural diversity by stimulating the production, spread and teaching of scientific knowledge in French. Coordinates research projects, training and curriculum reform in linguistics, culture, literature and education. Monitors meetings and scientific conferences, emphasizing publication (particularly online publication). Significantly, more than 2,250 specialists improve understanding of the French-speaking world and the impact of cultural and linguistic diversity on societies. *Economic development: Fundraising and public relations *Scientific skill reinforcement: Acts as liaison between scientific departments and regional offices. Administers French-speaking digital campuses and institutes in four-year cycles. Evaluates relations between the association and the French-speaking scientific community in the fields of the environment, water, energy, climate, sustainable development and well-being of populations; supports research. *Education: Supports communication and information technology in higher education and research; encourages digital development and offers training in the Technologies of Information and Communication (TICE) for teachers, students and staff). Partnerships The Agence universitaire de la Francophonie has developed partnerships with three objectives:Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, Partnerships *To establish more universities and giving them significant developmental roles *To develop ties between the AUF, its member institutions and developmental agencies (foundations, NGOs, territorial collectivities, etc.) *To increase development in the following ways: ** Place the association's knowledge at the disposal of the projects in question ** Promote scientific evaluation ** Use tools of university and scientific co- operation AUF numbers among its partners the European Union, UNESCO and the World Bank.Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, List of Partnerships It has been requested to assist in: * Project management * Technical evaluations * Information technology and communication * Developmental networks Publishing In 2001, the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie facilitated the creation of electronic French-language science journals.

Early life Bonwick was born Lingfield, Surrey, England, the eldest son of James Bonwick, carpenter, and his second wife Mary Ann n√©e Preston. James Bonwick, the elder, was a man of some mechanical ability, but he suffered from ill health, and his children were brought up in poor circumstances. His eldest son was educated at the Borough Road school, Southwark, and at 17 years of age began teaching at a school at Hemel Hempstead and similar positions followed at Bexley and Liverpool. In April 1840 he married Esther Ann Beddow, the daughter of a Baptist clergyman, and in the following year obtained a position at the Normal School, Hobart, Tasmania. Career in Australia = Teacher = Bonwick and his wife arrived at Hobart on 10 October 1841. He was a successful teacher in Hobart for eight years and published the first of his many school books Geography for the Use of Australian Youth in 1845. He went to Adelaide in 1850, and opened a private school. In 1852 made his way to the Victorian gold diggings after finding himself in debt. He did not find much gold, but his health benefited. He then went to Melbourne where he published The Australian Gold-Diggers' Monthly Magazine from October 1852 until its final edition in May 1853. In 1852 he also published \\"Notes of a gold digger: and gold digger's guide\\". He then established a successful boarding school at Kew now a suburb of Melbourne. He had already published several school books and pamphlets, when in 1856 he published his Discovery and Settlement of Port Phillip, the first of his historical works. About this time he joined the Victorian government service as an inspector of denominational schools, and in 1857 made a tour of inspection through the western district of Victoria. He then made Ballarat his centre and worked there for about four years. During his journeys he suffered from sunstroke and a coaching accident, and became so ill that he had to retire from the service. He was given 18 months' leave of absence, but was unable to continue this work. His head had been injured in the accident. He was never able to ride a horse again, and he was always liable to have an attack of giddiness. He visited England in 1860 and then returned to Melbourne in July 1862 and opened a school in the suburb of St Kilda, which became very prosperous. He paid another visit to England with his wife, leaving the school in the hands of a son and a friend of his. They, however, mismanaged the school, and Bonwick was compelled to return and put things in order again. He was doing much writing, and in the ensuing years travelled in various parts of Australia, New Zealand and Europe. = Author = Bonwick's initial works drew on his experience as a teacher and later of the Victorian gold diggings. He extended his repertoire, focusing on the history of Colonial Australia and religious subjects. Some of Bonwick's more important volumes were John Batman (1867); The Last of the Tasmanians, Daily Life and Origin of the Tasmanians, and Curious Facts of Old Colonial Days, all of which were published in 1870; Egyptian Belief and Modern Thought (1878), First Twenty Years of Australia (1882), Port Phillip Settlement (1883), Romance of the Wool Trade (1887) and Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions (1894). = Archivist = James Bonwick began examining historical records of Australian interest in London in 1884 and in 1887 he was authorised by the New South Wales Colonial Secretary, Sir Henry Parkes to transcribe Governors‚Äô despatches from the Public Record Office as part of a drive to collect records for an official centenary history of New South Wales. Bonwick was appointed archivist for the New South Wales government in 1888 and continued until 1902. He compiled what became known as the Bonwick Transcripts. These handwritten transcripts of records held in the Public Record Office, London (now The National Archives) were published in the series Historical Records of New South Wales (1892-1901).  Later life  In 1900 he had celebrated with his wife the sixtieth anniversary of their wedding. She died in 1901 and he felt her loss keenly. He completed and published in 1902 his final volume, an autobiography, An Octogenarian's Reminiscences, and died on 6 February 1906. He was survived by five children. Legacy Bonwick was a religious man, full of nervous energy and passion for his work. History, religion, astronomy, geography, anthropology and trade were among the subjects of his books. Some of the more important have been mentioned, some fifty others are listed in \\"A Bibliography of James Bonwick\\" by Dr G. Mackaness (Journal and Proceedings, Royal Australian Historical Society, 1937). An even longer list of his writings is appended to James Bonwick by E. E. Pescott. His school books were of great value at a time when it was difficult to obtain suitable books in Australia, and his historical work was always conscientious. Bonwick is best remembered for his transcripts of British Government records that formed the basis of the reference work: Historical Records of New South Wales. These records were his principal work until in 1902, at the age of 85, he resigned his position. It is true that Bonwick's transcripts and the resulting 7 volumes of Historical Records of New South Wales received later criticism. His selections were arbitrary and he was accused of censorship and excluding material that reflected poorly on individuals whether government officials, the military and free settlers, or drew attention to convict origins. However, these transcripts and publications had great utilitarian value for researchers, students and general readers who had no chance of seeing the original documents in Britain. Eventually the National Library of Australia and the State Library of New South Wales were to approach the Public Record Office with requests to microfilm these records comprehensively. This ultimately led to the two libraries signing an agreement with the PRO to establish the Australian Joint Copying Project (AJCP). The Bonwick Transcripts were transferred to the Mitchell Library when it was founded in 1910 as the \\"Australiana\\" Wing of the Library. In 1856, the Victorian government botanist Ferdinand von Mueller, named Euodia bonwickii (now Melicope bonwickii) in his honour.

The name \\"Woroni\\" derives from an Indigenous Australian word meaning \\"mouthpiece\\". Woroni is published fortnightly in full colour tabloid format, and features broad coverage of university and local news, opinion, features, arts and culture, sports, and leisure. It was formerly published as Student Notes: Canberra University College Students Association. History Woroni was first published on 23 May 1947 under the title Student Notes: Canberra University College Students Association. From 14 February 1950 the name was changed to Woroni. Traditionally, the editorial tone has been light-hearted and satirical. However, in recent years Woroni has increased its coverage of serious issues such as VSU, \\"Wadgate\\", and changes to the ANU School of Humanities. From 1948 to 2010 Woroni was published by ANUSA; its editors were officers of the Association, and responsible to the ANUSA Board of Trustees. In 2010/2011, Woroni became ANU Student Media Inc., a financially and editorially independent student-run publishing house - the first of its kind in Australia. = Independence = Since its inception in 1947 Woroni was published by Australian National University Students Association, formerly the Canberra University College Students Association, under the portfolio of the general secretary of the association. The editors were officers of the Association, and responsible to the ANUSA Board of Trustees. Throughout its history, Woroni had consistently asserted that it acted independently of the association, however had officially been published by ANUSA, and interference by elected student representatives featured as a concern in light of student union interference in publications elsewhere in Australia. The successful 2009 'Stand Up!' ticket for election on ANUSA's student representative council, led by 2010 ANUSA President (and 2008 Woroni editor) Tully Fletcher, ran on a platform to deliver an independent student newspaper, similar to student publications at North American universities. ANU Student Media was formed in October of 2010 and formally incorporated as an independent association under the Associations Incorporation Act 1991 (ACT). The first edition of the newspaper printed in 2011 commemorated the incorporation with the front page headline reading \\"Woroni is No Longer Listed as Married: After 62 years, the ANU Students' Association and Woroni call it quits.\\" Editorial board As of 2011, the Woroni editorial board is composed of eight editors, elected in alternating groups of four to terms of 12 months. Elections employ optional preferential voting, and are conducted online at the ANU website. Any ANU student who has submitted three substantive contributions to Woroni is eligible to run for editor. The editor-in-chief serves for a period of six months and is appointed to the position by the editorial board. Only current serving members of the editorial board are eligible to be appointed to the position.  Related projects  Each year, the editors of Woroni also oversee several other related departments and projects. = Woroni Radio = Woroni Radio is ANU Student Media's student radio station broadcast online through the Woroni website. Founded in 2012, Woroni Radio comprises student presenters creating their own radio content, and features a number of shows, flagship programs and podcasts. Each semester the schedule comprises between 40-60 shows. = Woroni TV = Woroni TV was conceived in 2016 and launched in 2017. It includes all video and moving content created and produced by Woroni. Content produced crosses genres, featuring a compilation satirical and creative pieces, features on Canberra lifestyle and personalities as well summaries of recent campus news.

Apparently the robbers were scared of something, and when they ran away, the accidentally left their welding flame on. Humppila was without a proper station building for nearly a decade, because the new building designed by Mauri Liedenpohja was only completed in 1983. Before this, traffic control was handled from a cargo warehouse. The station is nowadays unmanned. The traffic control is handled remotely from the Tampere railway station. Ticket sales were discontinued in March 2000. Passenger trains between Turku and Tampere still stop at the station. This is partly because the station is about halfway between the Turku Central railway station and the Toijala railway station, so trains having left at the same time meet at the station. Many trains do meet at Humppila regularly. Another reason why passenger traffic has been retained in Humppila is because inhabitants of Forssa and people visiting there have a practical train connection from Humppila. The distance is about 20 kilometres. There is regular bus traffic between Forssa and Humppila, and express buses between Helsinki and Pori also stop there.

Early life Bonney was the youngest son of the Rev. George Bonney, a fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, and his wife Susanna, n√©e Knight. He was born at Sandon, Staffordshire, England. After his father died in 1826 his brother Thomas, headmaster of Rugeley Grammar School, gave him an education and a home for seven years. (Two of Thomas's sons, Edward and Frederic Bonney, later went to Australia.) Pioneering in Australia Bonney left Britain on 5 August 1834 in the John Craig and arrived at Sydney on 12 December 1834, where he became clerk to Mr Justice Burton. About 18 months later he went with Charles Ebden to the Murray River around the present site of Albury, New South Wales. In December 1836, he crossed the Murray and took cattle to Port Phillip District, having been preceded by only Gardiner and Joseph Hawdon. On 1 March 1837 he was the first to overland sheep, bringing some 10,000 belonging to Ebden to Sugarloaf Creek, Victoria station a tributary of the Goulburn River. This was up to twenty times a typical ship load of sheep,Cornwall Chronicle, 24 October 1835, p. 2. eliminated catastrophic losses of entire ship loadsBent's News and Tasmanian Three-Penny Register, 27 February 1836, p. 3. and transformed the economics of the wool industry in Victoria as other overlanders followed his path. On about 21 March 1837 he discovered the rich, fertile Kilmore Plains in a journey that included blazing the trail of the Sydney Road. Kilmore became the inland agricultural powerhouse of the infant State of Victoria. These discoveries had a major impact on the economy of Victoria.Williams, Martin. Charles Bonney and the fertile Kilmore Plains, Victorian Historical Journal, Vol. 90, No. 1, June 2019. p108 p117. Bonney later wrote that amongst his proudest achievements were founding the fertile district of Kilmore and the route of the Sydney Road.Bonney, Charles. Autobiographical Notes, National Library of Australia, NLA digitised item, JAFp BIO 55 copy In January 1838, acting as overseer to Joseph Hawdon, he went with him and a party with about 300 cattle, from the Murray, near Albury, to Adelaide. It was the hottest season of the year, and groups of aborigines were continually being encountered, but the party kept on good terms with them by Bonney using the unique and peaceful process of playing his flute for them.Hawdon, J., The journal of a journey from New South Wales to Adelaide [The Capital of South Australia] Performed in 1838, Georgian House, Melbourne, 1952, p. 30, p. 46. On 1 March 1838 they came to the junction of the Darling River with the Murray, and the whole journey took about three months. A beautiful lake was found on 4 March and named after the young Queen Victoria, and on 12 March another lake was found and named by Hawdon after Bonney ‚Äì see Lake Bonney Riverland. They left the Murray on 23 March, and after travelling many miles, Mount Barker was reached. About 1 April they reached the seashore near where the township of Noarlunga now stands. Meeting some settlers, they made for Adelaide, where they arrived on 3 April and found a ready market for their cattle. Returning to Port Phillip by sea, Bonney brought another herd of cattle overland to Adelaide in February 1839, travelling through south-west Victoria rather than following the River Murray, a longer but safer route. Near the border the country became very dry, and disaster was narrowly averted. Fortunately water was found, and when the Murray was crossed only one bullock and one horse were lost. In spite of their difficulties, only 23 cattle were lost on the whole journey (Edward John Eyre, who had taken a similar route around the time of Hawdon and Bonney's first cattle drive, had not been so fortunate). He was a member of O'Halloran's 1840 punitive expedition following the massacre of survivors of the wreck of the Maria. Bonney stayed at Adelaide for a time and then joined Ebden again at the Murray. In 1841 a period of depression led to cattle becoming almost unsaleable. Political career In 1842 Bonney became a magistrate and commissioner of crown lands in South Australia. He held this position for about 15 years. When responsible government came in, Bonney was elected a member of the South Australian House of Assembly for East Torrens, and became commissioner of crown lands in the first ministry under B. T. Finniss. This ministry went out of office in August 1857 and Bonney resigned his seat in the following January. He was in England from 1858 to 1862, and returning to South Australia, was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council in 1865, retiring in 1866. In 1861 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. From 1869 to 1871 he was manager of the South Australian railways. In 1871 he was appointed inspector of lands purchased on credit, and in 1880 retired on a pension. In 1885 he went to Sydney and died there, at his residence, \\"Thornley\\", Woollahra, on 15 March 1897. He had been afflicted with blindness for some years. He left a widow, Charlotte (died 20 September 1902), two sons and three daughters.H. J.

The word Bapticostal is a combination of Baptist and Pentecostal. The term has been used in a limited manner to describe a worship style of high-tempo Contemporary Christian music accompanied with spontaneous shouts, clapping and hand raising. But it also describes those churches where members profess to have and exhibit the charismatic gifts that are practiced in Pentecostalism such as speaking in tongues, being slain in the Spirit, or being granted a word of knowledge. The prevalence of such beliefs within Baptist churches worldwide is unknown. In some unions or conventions it hardly exists (e.g. Eastern Europe) but in others (Australia, New Zealand) it is common. In the United States, it has been estimated that among Southern Baptist churches, 5% of the churches could be classified as Bapticostal, and the numbers are growing. According to a study in 1989, 69% of Baptist churches belonging to the Baptist Union of New Zealand, the main Baptist association in New Zealand, identified positively with the charismatic movement. Southern Baptist Response While the Bapticostal movement may be gaining support with individual churches in the convention, the movement has been met with official opposition. In 1999, a regional Southern Baptist association of churches expelled the Calvary Baptist Church in Marshfield, Missouri for the church teaching and exhibition of speaking in tongues and church members being slain in the Spirit. More recently, in 2006 the International Mission Board passed standards for missionaries which would disqualify those who espoused opposition to traditional Southern Baptist doctrines of eternal security and a rejection of a salvific view of baptism, and also engaged in speaking in tongues or had a \\"private prayer language\\". Following the new qualification of missionary appointments, the Rev. Dwight McKissic gave a sermon during a chapel service to students attending Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and announced that he speaks in tongues and uses a private prayer language and emphasized not taking a cessationist view of the charismatic gifts. Southwestern quickly distanced itself from McKissic's comments saying, :\\"Rev. McKissic‚Äôs interpretation of tongues as 'ecstatic utterance' is not a position that we suspect would be advocated by most faculty or trustees. In keeping with Baptist convictions regarding religious liberty, we affirm Rev. McKissic‚Äôs right to believe and advocate his position. Equally in keeping with our emphasis of religious liberty we reserve the right not to disseminate openly views which we fear may be harmful to the churches.\\" However, shortly after his election as president of the Convention, Rev. Frank Page expanded on his \\"big tent\\" view of Southern Baptists by saying, :\\"Churches must deal with charismatic issues and theology as a part of their own autonomous structure. I think that many charismatics function well within traditional Southern Baptist churches. In fact, we have several in our church. Some are more vocal and sometimes disruptive. Churches must deal with those kinds of attitudes on a case by case basis. Trustee bodies must do the same.\\" Mike Huckabee in describing his home church said in a sermon on December 2, 2007, \\"we tend to be a little Bapticostal where I go.\\" Mike Huckabee. \\"Gov. Huckabee in the Pulpit\\" Newsweek Video. December 17, 2007. Retrieved January 6, 2008.  National Baptist Convention  The National Baptist Convention, the largest predominantly African-American Baptist denomination in the United States, does not have any official beliefs or standpoints regarding Pentecostal and charismatic expressions of worship in their churches' services or in their national and district meetings and conventions, as they believe their churches have autonomous authority to deal with how they handle and address Pentecostal and charismatic expressions of worship. In fact, in many churches that are a part of the National Baptist Convention, and in many of their national and district meetings and conventions across the United States, their adherents and clergy often practice, believe in, and exhibit the charismatic gifts of the Spirit that are practiced in Pentecostalism such as speaking in tongues and being slain in the Spirit in their worship services. They also make very consistent use of high-tempo Traditional Black Gospel and Contemporary Christian music in their worship style and practices as well. Also, as many Pentecostal and Charismatic denominations adhere to Christian perfection teachings that originated from the Holiness movement, the National Baptist Convention does officially teach and believe in Christian perfection, and refers to it also as many Pentecostal denominations do as \\"sanctification.\\" See also * Continuationism References External links *\\"Fire in My Bones: Confessions of a Bapticostal\\" in Charisma Magazine Category:Baptist Christianity Category:Charismatic and Pentecostal Christianity Category:Christian theological movements Category:Protestantism-related controversies ","title":"Bapticostal movement"},{"id":"9804785","text":"Christopher Murray Maxwell is an Australian jurist.

The present diocese, erected 13 March 1963, revives a larger colonial bishopric. Its present cathedral episcopal see is the Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepci√≥n, devoted to the Immaculate Concepcion, in Comayagua, which city also has the former cathedral: Iglesia de La Merced Iglesia de La Merced, devoted to Our Lady of Mercy.  History  In 1561, the first bishopric was established as Diocese of Comayagua, on territory split off from the then Roman Catholic Diocese of Trujillo (founded as diocese of Honduras), and in 1571 gained its mother bishopric's remaining territory at its suppression (Trujillo would however be restored in 1987). Like many missionary dioceses, it had mainly regular priests as Ordinaries, who generally died in office or were transferred/promoted within the vast Spanish colonial empire. On 1916.02.02 it was suppressed, its territory being divided to establish the Archdiocese of Tegucigalpa (its Metropolitan still, in the national capital), the then Apostolic Vicariate of San Pedro Sula and the Diocese of Santa Rosa de Cop√°n. It was restored on 1963.03.13, as Diocese of Comayagua, on much smaller territory (7,527 km¬≤) split off from its Metropolitan, the Archdiocese of Tegucigalpa.  Statistics  As per 2014, it has a population of 635,586 Catholics (93.3% of 681,546 total), pastorally served in 32 parishes by 56 priests (46 diocesan, 10 religious), 102 lay religious (33 brothers, 69 sisters) and 30 seminarians.

The group consists of singer, songwriter and keyboardist Dan Muckala, guitarist Alex Nifong, and drummer Jason Collum. They released one album, Fiction, in 1998. History Dan Muckala was a musical composition student at Belmont University in Tennessee. In 1996, he became a professional songwriter and penned a number of Top Ten songs on contemporary hit radio. Prior to forming the band, Muckala had also toured with other artists and led worship for a youth group. According to Muckala, \\"the band got started out of a desire that God gave me to put together a group that . . . really was focused on reaching kids and not just playing music either. I've always felt that Christian music should be a medium that reaches into the mainstream.\\" Signed in early 1998 to Essential Records, Mukala released their debut album, Fiction, in September. The band's musical style drew comparisons to Silage, Smash Mouth, and Beck. Their first single, \\"Soap\\", received airplay on Christian rock and Top 40 radio stations. In an industry first, the single \\"Regret\\" was released as an Internet download. \\"Regret\\" was also featured on the soundtrack of the 1999 movie Drive Me Crazy, starring Melissa Joan Hart and Adrian Grenier.

Mount Gambier Airport is an airport in the Limestone Coast, South Australia. It is located on the Riddoch Highway in Wandilo, about north of Mount Gambier. It is the only commercial airport servicing the Limestone Coast region of South Australia. Currently, Regional Express Airlines is the only airline servicing the airport, with multiple daily flights to Adelaide and Melbourne, using Saab 340 turboprop aircraft.  History  The original Mount Gambier aerodrome was established when Mr H.S. (Stan) May and Mr S.C. Davis purchased land directly opposite the present airport on the Riddoch Highway. An aerodrome was established and basic infrastructure provided with the aerodrome officially opened on 21 May 1930. Scheduled airline services to Adelaide and Melbourne began the same year. The aerodrome owners then purchased 82 hectares of land that was part of 'Croyle Estate' and then another 66 hectares of the same property on 2 June 1936. This site is where the airport is today. A licence was granted by the then-Civil Aviation Branch of the Department of Defence on 1 July 1936 and the new airport began hosting regular public transport flights. In July 1939 the Federal Government purchased the aerodrome from its civilian owners and commenced the construction of a Royal Australian Air Force base which was to house the No. 2 Air Observers School (2AOS). It was officially formed on 6 February 1941 and the first intake of trainees began on 6 March 1941. The school had its own ambulance, hospital, butcher, gymnasium and even cinema and at its peak was home to over 1000 personnel. It was eventually disbanded in January 1946 after training over 4000 Air Observers, Navigators and Wireless Operators, of which many served with RAF Bomber Command over Germany, Atlantic Ocean, the Middle East and South East Asia. 2AOS also conducted coastal surveillance operations in the South East of South Australia, reporting a number of submarine sightings. On 29 May 1947 the airport was handed over to the Department of Civil Aviation and this saw the return of regular public transport flights to the region with Ansett Airways announcing that a daily service would operate between Mount Gambier and Melbourne. In July 1947 the Mount Gambier Gliding Club was formed and over the next 40 years the airport continued to prosper as a critical port for flights from Adelaide and Melbourne.  Upgrade  In 2011 it was announced that Mount Gambier Airport would be upgraded under a $3.4 million program. This project was partly funded by the Government of South Australia who awarded a $500,000 infrastructure grant with the balance coming from the airport's reserve fund. The upgrade, part of a 15-year redevelopment plan, will strengthen the main runway, aprons and taxiways, to enable larger aircraft to operate to the airport and help increase the area's tourism appeal.  Operations  = Ansett Airways = The defunct airline Ansett Airways formerly operated scheduled domestic services with routes to Adelaide and Melbourne before being placed into administration in 2001. = Aerostar Aviation = In 2014 Adelaide-based company Aerostar Aviation announced they would open a flight training school utilising existing infrastructure. The facility will include 1 full-time flight instructor and a Cessna 172. It had been 15 years since the airport had been able to offer flight training, since the closure of the O'Connor Airlines training facility in 1999. = deBruin Air = de Bruin Air Jetstream 32 takes off at Mount Gambier Airport (2014) In 2008 Mount Gambier businessman Adrian deBruin formed air charter company deBruin Air after acquiring the assets of defunct airline O'Connor Airlines. The company catered for executive and business charter, contract charter including fly-in fly-out, aerial photography, fire spotting and freight. DeBruin Air was formally closed in early 2016. = Gambier Flying School = In mid-2016, flight instructor Tony Peters commenced operations trading as Gambier Flying School. The school currently operates two small aircraft and caters for students working towards either their RA, GA or Commercial Pilots licences. = O'Connor Airlines = O'Connor Airlines, which ceased operations 14 December 2007, was formerly based at the airport before going into voluntary administration. The airline initially began with a flight training school in 1973 before expanding into freight and passenger services with scheduled domestic routes to Adelaide and Melbourne.. = Regional Express Airlines = In 2002 Australiawide Airlines, a consortium of former Ansett Australia employees) acquired Hazelton Airlines and Kendell Airlines to form a new regional airline. Regional Express continues to operate daily flights between Adelaide, Mount Gambier and Melbourne. = QantasLink = In 2009 QantasLink announced it was exploring further services into regional South Australia, including flights to Mount Gambier. The airline has announced it will introduce a new air service between Adelaide to Port Lincoln, however QantasLink says while Port Lincoln is its primary focus, it will explore further expansion into regional areas. In 2014 QantasLink announced a further 1 of 2 destinations were under consideration - Mount Gambier and Whyalla. The new service was awarded to Whyalla.

Their first album with drummer Bob Leith and their second as a four-piece, it was recorded throughout 1995, breaking a hiatus by the band that had lasted since the band's previous album Heaven Born and Ever Bright (1992). During writing and recording, Jon Poole took a greater role than before, contributing to many songs written by band leader Tim Smith, and writing some of his own. The band decided to create a double album to encompass the great wealth of material written after their previous album. As with the band's previous albums, it presents a unique sound, and is seen as more eclectic than the band's previous albums, with one reviewer describing the record as \\"essentially [taking] everything Cardiacs had always been and [ramping] it up to maximum,\\" and another saying the album was where \\"Smith's ability to express the music inside his head really began to transcend any sort of identifiable genre and turned Cardiacs into something truly unique.\\" The album was released in June 1996 by the band's own record label Alphabet Business Concern, originally as a limited edition double-disc CD set, before being re-released as two separate albums. Three singles were released from the album; \\"Bellyeye\\", \\"Manhoo\\" and \\"Odd Even\\". Upon release, the music press mostly overlooked the album with the exception of some hostile reviews, reflecting the band's unpopularity with the music press at the time. However, over time, it has gone on to be regarded as a masterpiece and the band's magnum opus. Sam Shepherd of MusicOMH said the album is \\"quite possibly one of the greatest albums ever made.\\" The album was re-released in 2014 as a double LP set, the first time it had been released on vinyl. Background After Cardiacs released their fifth album On Land and in the Sea (1989), the group's line up drastically change; percussionist Tim Quy, keyboardist William D. Drake, saxophonist Sarah Smith and guitarist Bic Hayes all left the band. For the band's subsequent album Heaven Born and Ever Bright (1992), the band became a four-piece, with Jon Poole replacing Bic Hayes' place on guitar during the sessions, and the results gave the album a more direct, heavier direction than the band's previous albums. The album was initially released on Rough Trade instead of the band's own label Alphabet Business Concern, who usually release the band's albums. However, as soon as the album was released, Rough Trade \\"went under\\" and closed, ceasing to exist, which put the band \\"in a bit of a financial trap\\". Following its release, their drummer Dominic Luckman left the band and was replaced by Bob \\"Babba\\" Leith, and the band subsequently became their second \\"classic\\" line-up, sometimes referred to as \\"Cardiacs Mark II\\". During this period, the members of the band \\"all got up to other things.\\" Band leader Tim Smith \\"produced some other bands albums and things like that.\\" In doing this, the band got the money to re-release their own, older material and carry on, \\"so it was kind of a blessing in disguise in a funny kind of way.\\" As a four-piece, their next album would utilise the studio to flesh out the band's sound. Due to the sheer amount of material that group leader Tim Smith had written over a number of years with little or no Cardiacs live performances, they decided the new album would be a double album.  Recording The band recorded the album between Spring and Winter 1995 at the London studio Apollo 8 Studios in Merritt Island and Sally Birthday House Studios, a studio of an unknown location described as simply being \\"somewhere.\\" Jon Poole recalled that \\"Jim and Jane's\\" house was a location for recording.\\" Although the band have a status as a cult band, during recording, the band opened for Blur at Mile End Stadium and recorded a Radio 1 live session with Mark Radcliffe, which aired 24 April 1995, and a Lunchtime Acoustic Session broadcast live on GLR Radio on 16 May 1995. To fill the increasing gap between Cardiacs releases as Sing to God was not yet finished, a live album recorded in Salisbury in 1990, All That Glitters Is a Mares Nest, was released in 1995 to satisfy fans. The album sessions presented a change in Cardiacs' working methods. Whereas most previous material had been written and arranged by band leader Tim Smith, Sing to God features extensive contributions from Jon Poole, who played a strong role in orchestrating Smith's basic material with detailed riffs and keyboard parts and contributed several songs entirely written by himself, whilst drummer Bob Leith also made significant contributions to the album's lyrics, marking the first time that Smith was not the only songwriter for the band. In a 1996 interview, Smith said \\"I really like the stuff [Poole]'s written, we all do. We're really dead lucky to have someone like him. He's written some great stuff for the new album.\\" Poole recalled that \\"this was a joyous and creative time and easily the best time I had in the band which is strange as I was going through upheaval in my personal life and had to keep walking off into the fields to have a good old blub but maybe this added to it all! We took the studio to Jim and Jane's place in the country. When I arrived there Jim and Jane were adding snipping sounds with garden tools to 'Wireless'. To this day I think it's one of Jane's proudest moments and I love hearing her tell other people about how surreal it was.\\" During recording there, Tim Smith would create drums and rough keyboard chords on tape and would ask Poole to come up with guitar and bass riffs. Poole recalled \\"I was literally allowed to do pretty much anything I wanted.\\" Tim would then \\"do the production bit\\" and \\"get the best out of\\" Poole. The two sometimes contributed to the writing of each other's tracks, including Smith contributing the string arrangement to Poole's \\"Manhoo\\". During this phase of recording, Jim and Jane invited all the band's friends over \\"every so often for parties that have now gone down in history as being nothing short of legendary.\\" In 2009, Poole recalled that \\"I still can't listen to Mr Bungle or Mercury Rev without having disturbing flashbacks! It was a wonderful time and something that I'm so lucky to have been a part of. Tim would no doubt echo that.\\"  Music  Sing to God presents a unique sound that critics found hard to classify, and is seen as \\"a record that is scarcely comparable to anything else by anyone else.\\" A journalist from PIEmag said the album was \\"more original and dynamic than ever before; they mix their classic Cardiacesque, huge orchestral harmonies with delicate pop, fast rocking and furious, at times almost Naked City-ish jazz structures. To add yet another dimension to their music, they experiment with sound and production in a way we haven't heard since the heyday of Psychic TV, or even the old 'kraut' bands like Faust, Neu!, Can etc..\\" Benjamin Bland of Drowned in Sound said that \\"somewhat approximate to the notion of Cardiacs squared, Sing to God essentially takes everything Cardiacs had always been and ramps it up to maximum.\\" He noted that \\"this is a record drenched in deranged pomposity, from the massive riffs to the expansive keyboards and theatrical vocals. That's without even mentioning the bits that sound something like Sgt Pepper being performed by a Frank Zappa conducted London Symphony Orchestra on speed.\\" Sean Kitching of The Quietus said the album is \\"the pinnacle of Tim Smith's studio mastery and exhibits elements of the gentler side of his Sea Nymphs project alongside the full-on helter skelter, breakneck velocity more usually associated with the band. It is also, despite the richness of its orchestration and more experimental tendencies, decidedly a pop record‚Äìone as quintessentially English sounding as Pink Floyd's seminal Piper at the Gates of Dawn or XTC's classic English Settlement.\\" He also commented that the album marked the point where \\"Smith's ability to express the music inside his head really began to transcend any sort of identifiable genre and turned Cardiacs into something truly unique.\\" Philip Whitehead of Sputnikmusic said \\"there is a wide range of styles on display here with the album spinning off in all sorts of directions at unexpected times but it's never 'too much' for the listener, with the softer tracks coming in at perfect times to provide a break after the chaos of Tim Smith let loose, and the closers on each disc do their part perfectly to end proceedings.\\" The album also features material originally written for various other Cardiacs related projects. The track \\"Nurses Whispering Verses\\" had been recorded twice before, once on the band's 1981 cassette album Toy World and once on the original cassette release of the band's 1983 album The Seaside (it was removed from the 1995 CD reissue, but reinstated on the 2015 CD and Vinyl reissue in remastered form). \\"Bell Stinks\\", \\"Bell Clinks\\" and \\"Angleworm Angel\\", all written by Poole, were all taken from the repertoire of the thrash band Panixsphere, which featured Tim Smith and Jon Poole alongside Christian Hayes and David Francolini of Levitation. \\"Billion\\" is allegedly the first song which Tim Smith ever wrote, resurrected and recorded many years after its composition, whilst \\"Wireless\\" features Tim Smith reading from a children's story called \\"Peril on the Sea\\" written by Dawn Staple, who would join the band in 2004 as a percussionist and backing singer.Sing to God liner notes. Sam Shepherd opined that \\"if you were to take a guess at what Smith was suggesting with this album it would simply be that the world is a magical, wondrous place, and that it is still possible to see it through a child's eyes. To that end, any religious themes that can be detected are swamped in childlike word play or muted understanding. Creation is covered in the beautifully grotesque \\"Insect Hooves on Lassie\\", which finds Tim indulging in a little re-designing and making his own kind of hero. dog.\\" =Songs= A Happy Apple sound begins the album, like \\"the twinkling of the stars on the album cover\\". Kitching, describing opening track \\"Eden on the Air\\", said \\"a sound like a wind chime being struck followed by some seconds silence proceeds from the initial drop of the needle as 'Eden on the Air' swells, imperceptibly at first, to coalesce like early morning mist, beautiful but only briefly there.\\" Sam Shepherd of MusicOMH said that the \\"gently tinkling wind chime and then short passage\\" sound like \\"the twinkling of the stars that grace the cover of the album.\\" \\"Eat It Up Worms Hero\\" has been described as coming \\"something of a shock, shaking the listener rudely out of their reverie\\" and as \\"easily the album's most abrasive and chaotic sounding track.\\" It is a product of Smith using the studio as instrument, conducting a mass of choral voices against buzzsaw guitars and manic electronic pulses. The \\"singalong craziness\\" of \\"Dog Like Sparky\\" combines \\"a tale of everyday pet disablement to a wonky oompah knees up\\". Kitching called it a \\"stupidly, almost overwhelmingly happy song with a playful blasphemy hidden in its heart (\\"Put your hands on the Holy Bible and scream wank\\") and an utterly demented keyboard refrain that sounds like a fleet of ice-cream vans chiming simultaneously.\\" Shepherd noted that \\"three songs in, and already there's been enough ideas thrown into the mix to fill most bands entire careers.\\" \\"Fiery Gun Hand\\" keeps the pace of the album up and then \\"floors the accelerator. In anybody else's hands it's a song that could be described as metal or punk, but there are so many flourishes, so many deviations and any number of ridiculous fuck yous to convention that it can't be labelled. Which is of course exactly how it should be.\\" Kitching called it \\"an electrifying piece of avant-pop orchestration with Jon Poole's guitar solo (spliced together by Smith from several Poole solos) redefining the term 'incendiary'.\\" \\"Bellyeye\\" and \\"Manhoo\\" have both been compared to Blur, a band influenced by Cardiacs. The latter, written by Poole, \\"has a skip in its step and a rumbling and forceful bassline that somehow couldn't be poppier if it was covered in glitter,\\" and features a string arrangement written by Tim Smith. \\"Wireless\\" was described as one of the \\"most beautiful\\" tracks on the album, is Smith's re-imagining of Faust's song \\"Psalter\\", also known as 'Lauft... Heisst Das es Lauft Oder es Kommt Bald... Lauft', but performed primarily on piano and scissor-wielding percussive ensemble that ends with Smith reading a \\"bizarre aquatic-themed children's story.\\" Jim and Jane Smith added snipping sounds with garden tools to the song. \\"Dirty Boy\\", which opens the second disc, is \\"perhaps the album's crowning achievement\\" according to Kitching, beginning with a guitar riff and alchemically transmuting that song over the course of its nearly nine minutes duration with \\"celestially ringing sounds\\" constructed by \\"innumerably overlaid strata of acoustic guitar and incredibly drawn out sustained vocals that when performed live had an undeniably consciousness- altering effect on all those present.\\" \\"Quiet as a Mouse\\", described as a \\"weird piece\\", was described by Tim Smith as the sound of \\"just somebody who left the tape running when we were doing these orchestral bits.\\" The band came across it \\"kind of accidentally\\" and enjoyed it enough to include it on the album. \\"Odd Even\\" is \\"an airy dip into baroque pop incorporating lush string arrangements.\\" \\"Red Fire Coming Out Of His Gills\\" returns to the \\"aquatic fairy tale theme\\" of the end of \\"Wireless\\" and \\"turns it into a classically infused anthem that wouldn't be out of place as the soundtrack to a really strange animated children's TV show.\\" \\"Foundling\\" was described as having \\"subdued beauty,\\" and alongside \\"No Gold\\", return the album \\"once more to gentler Sea Nymphs territory, whilst \\"Nurses Whispering Verses\\", which takes its title from the Slapp Happy and Henry Cow song \\"In the Sickbay\\" from their album Desperate Straights (1975), is a \\"definitive\\" re-recording of one of the band's earliest songs, having originally been recorded and released twice for the band's first two albums, Toy World (1981) and The Seaside (1983), when it had become a firm favourite in the band's live performances at the time. Philip Whitehead of Sputnikmusic said it adds \\"an extra sense of urgency to the original and adding a whole new element to just lift it to pure majesty.\\" After thirty seconds at the end of the album, a brief bell jingle plays as a hidden track, bringing the album to a peaceful close. Promotion and release Tim Smith denied that the album title, Sing to God, was a reference to faith. He said that the album was named it \\"merely because [former Cardiacs keyboardist] Bill Drake had this little kid-hymn book and it was called Sing to God and we thought it was a nice title.\\" He said that \\"it's just if the word \\"Jesus\\" appears [in the album's lyrics], it's just because it mentions Jesus in the same way that anyone's name would appear.\\" The album cover, featuring the band's disembodied heads floating against a dark night sky dotted with stars, was inspired by Night of the Hunter. Sean Kitching of The Quietus said that \\"the creepy fairytale atmosphere\\" of the film \\"makes it an entirely appropriate image that resonates perfectly with the album's overall vibe. The fact that the band members' eyes are all rendered artificially larger, suggesting wide-eyed children, or perhaps adults returned to that beatific state by the administration of some pharmaceutical philtre, also attests to the truly psychedelic nature of the sounds contained within.\\" The album was released in the UK on 11 June 1996 by the band's long-running own label Alphabet Business Concern, alongside re-releases of all their previous albums. Originally a limited edition 2CD double album set, limited to 3,000 copies, Sing to God was subsequently re-released as two separate albums, Sing to God ‚Äì Part One and Sing to God ‚Äì Part Two. The band's website explained this, saying the album \\"was later split into two separate albums due to a mistake\\". \\"Bellyeye\\" was released as the album's first single several months ahead of the album on Org Records, the record-releasing wing of long-term Cardiacs' supporters Organ Magazine. It was one of the band's few releases on a label other than Alphabet Business Concern. Tim Smith said the single was \\"only a small release made by some friends who run a fanzine over here. Since we hadn't released anything for a couple of years they offered to put that out for us. That was a part of the new album that we were recording at the time anyway.\\" A comment about not disturbing commercial sensibilities was slightly edited in the \\"Manhoo\\" single because \\"it was too long and when it's too long it won't be played on the radio.\\" The part in question was \\"that middle bit where it goes off the wall a little bit, it comes off the rail and then lands back where it was in the first place. [The band] thought [they'd] just keep it on the rail. [Tim Smith] likes both versions.\\" Two further singles were released from the album, \\"Manhoo\\" and \\"Odd Even\\", both released like the album on the band's own Alphabet Business Concern label. Additional singles for ‚ÄúBell Clinks‚Äù and ‚ÄúDirty Boy‚Äù were planned but never released. None of the singles charted. The album was re-released as a 2xLP set on 7 July 2014, the first time it was released on vinyl. This re-release was a 180g \\"heavyweight\\" vinyl set, described by The Quietus as being \\"always deserved\\" and \\"beautiful\\". The set features previously unseen band photographs inside the sleeve and the individual band members' faces from the album cover now adorning a side each of the centre labels. Sam Shepherd of MusicOMH called it \\"the latest in a series of re-issues of albums that have long been unavailable, except to those with exceedingly deep pockets on eBay.\\"  Critical reception  = Initial reaction = The album was an instant hit with fans, but due to the ongoing neglect and disdain of the band by the British music press, one of the only original reviews was an infamous review in Vox, who rated the album a score of 0/10. When asked by upon release by PIE Mag how the album had been received by fans and the media, Tim Smith replied \\"oh, the media? No, we don't get received at all in the media over here. We did a couple of live radio sessions on Radio 1 over here. Luckily we've got this DJ, Mark Radcliffe, who's on our side, which is nice. I reckon he must be the only person in the media that sticks his neck out for us. I think we've seen review of it so far and it got nought out of ten.\\" When asked about the media's treatment of the band, Smith said \\"you can't rock the boat in this country! It's really not allowed to play anything that might go against the grain of the current fashion. I think it's because we've been around for a long time and we refuse to go away. We really, genuinely do love what we do and there's a bunch of people over here who like it enough to make us carry on. But you know, British media... I mean, every other country in the world know about the British media and how thick they are. We're just a prime target for their dartboard. The fact that we're not good looking, the fact that we're probably getting on a bit now, that kind of thing.\\" One British journalist in a later review of Sing to God said that \\"such negative feelings [about the band] must be discouraged, given the joys contained within their kaleidoscopic world.\\" = Retrospective assessment = Over time, music critics have re- evaluated Cardiacs and their albums, and today Sing to God is considered a masterpiece, and is often regarded as the band's magnum opus. Original copies for the album command high prices in second hand retail. A reviewer for PIEmag said the album was considered by \\"many (myself included)\\" to be \\"one of the finest moments in Cardiac history. Benjamin Bland of Drowned in Sound said that \\"to say it's highly regarded amongst Cardiacs fans everywhere would be the understatement of the century.\\" Sam Shepherd of MusicOMH was very favourable, called the album \\"the band's crowning glory\\" and \\"quite possibly one of the greatest albums ever made.\\" He said \\"it would be possible to write about Sing to God and the sheer brilliance of Cardiacs for ever, but the truth is, words will never be able to describe just how incredible the band and this album is. The only way to find out is to hear it, and once you do, things will never be quite the same again. This really is an album worthy of laudation.\\" He also noted that \\"It is an incorrect received wisdom that double-albums are fundamentally flawed. Prior to Sing to God, it's an argument that may have held some water, but over the course of two discs (or four sides of vinyl) there is not an ounce of fat or mindless folly. This is an album of unmitigated genius from start to finish.\\" Sean Kitching of The Quietus said \\"this is a wonderful album for those whose hearts lack the cynicism to ridicule its often delirious flights of fancy, a cornucopia of synaesthetically rendered technicolor delights for those who have not yet lost the innocence required to be receptive its psychedelic splendour.\\" Michael Rodham-Heaps of Freq.org.uk called it \\"an absolute joy from start to finish\\". Alex Wisgard of The Line of Best Fit gave the album a score of 8.5/10, saying \\"no one was writing music like this in the Nineties ‚Äì okay, Mansun came close with Six, but they never made a career out of songs like that, did they? And you can't imagine Cardiacs ever having an \\"I Can Only Disappoint U\\" moment - and I doubt anyone has really ever tried since. With Tim Smith still recovering from a life-threatening heart-attack-and-stroke combination which befell him in 2008, sadly the man himself is in no position either. But with their work slowly coming back into circulation, now is as good a time as any to try and unravel their mystery before anyone else catches up.\\" Andrew \\"Tiny\\" Wood, singer of the band Ultrasound, reviewed the album as an \\"Under Rated Album\\" for Crackle Feedback as part of an article about his record collection. Wood said that Sing To God was released \\"right in the middle of the so called Britpop thing, and if anyone can lay claim to the Britpop crown it is the Cardiacs, largely ignored in a period which was desperately in need of a nostalgia for something that never really happened in the first place, instead of a celebration of what we Brits can achieve when we really put our minds and imaginations to it. The Cardiacs were probably the greatest band ever to come out of Britain, and one day they will be recognised.\\" He commented that \\"It sprawls over two discs like a many-tendrilled beast, taking in influences from Krautrock to the Kinks in a lysergic soup like a scorpion sting to the head, sharp yet soporific, making me dizzy with intense spins and swirls of sound and colour.\\" When asked in a 2001 interview with Margen Magazine, whether he thinks Sing to God is the band's best album due to it being their \\"more known album\\", Tim Smith replied \\"no‚Ä¶ I sort of like them all in one way or another.\\" The band followed Sing to God with Guns (1999), their final album, which shocked fans due to its less restless sound. In an interview with Prog, Devin Townsend said Sing to God is the prog album he plays to \\"get [him] in a good mood\\": \\"It's uplifting and intense. Some of the chord changes are so unconventional and hilarious.\\"Prog issue 69, page 130 In a 2014 list entitled \\"The Arresting Sound of Cardiacs\\", written by Ben Saunders for The Hooded Utilitarian, \\"Fiery Gun Hand\\" and \\"Dirty Boy\\" from Sing to God featured as the seventh and eighth tracks. In a 2015 list for Team Rock, musician Mike Vennart included \\"Eat it Up Worms Hero\\", \\"Dog Like Sparky\\" and \\"Dirty Boy\\" in his list of \\"The 10 Best Cardiacs Songs\\".

A juggling ball refers to any juggling object that is roughly spherical in nature.  Types  Vinyl \\"beach\\" beanbags Beanbags are the most common type of juggling ball. Juggling beanbags are typically constructed with an outer shell made from several pieces of vinyl or microfiber (imitation leather), and filled with millet, birdseed, plastic pellets, sand, crushed rock, ground rubber, or other material designed to give the beanbag bulk.Besmehn, Bobby (1994). Juggling Step-by-Step, p.78. Sterling. \\"Bean Bag: Juggling object often round or square shaped and about 2\\" diameter. It is filled with rice or bird seed.\\" Beanbags come in a variety of colors, the most common being \\"beach\\" (a combination of 4 panels colored red, yellow, blue and green), white, and other combinations of colors that are easily visible. Beanbags are preferred by many jugglers because beanbags don't bounce or roll when dropped, are caught the most easily, and have reasonable pricing and availability. Beanbags are generally found in sizes ranging from 2.5\\"-3\\" in diameter, with weights of 90-130g. Smaller beanbags with less filling in them are sometimes used by numbers jugglers, who require a smaller and lighter ball so they can throw and catch many balls using the same hand. Stage balls in use Stage balls are often used during juggling performances. Stage balls have a polished outer shell, typically made of plastic or hard rubber, and are hollow. For this reason, stage balls can be manufactured to a greater diameter than beanbags, whilst maintaining a more manageable weight for the juggler. Furthermore, stage balls hold their shape and color better than beanbags making them a more visual prop. Stage balls, however, tend to roll away when dropped, and therefore are not commonly used during practice. Stage balls are generally found in sizes ranging from 2.5\\"-4\\" in diameter, though many performers such as Sergej Ignatov have used balls larger than 4\\" when performing for extra dramatic effect. DX/Russian balls are a style of juggling balls that combines many of the benefits of both beanbags and stage balls. DX balls are constructed with a hard PVC outer shell, similar to a stage ball, and are part-filled with millet seed, to give the ball a consistent weight. This produces a juggling ball that flies consistently in the air, and does not roll away when dropped. The DX ball is patented in the UK by Beard Enterprises Ltd. Bouncing balls are designed for bounce juggling, and feature a 75-90% bounce return. They are made of silicone or a synthetic rubber compound. Silicone balls are a type of bouncing ball most commonly used during bounce juggling and stage performances. These balls are made of silicone and have the same clean appearance as stage balls, a surface which is easy to grip and catch, and have a consistent, high bounce. Silicone balls are also easier to clean than stage balls, which can often scuff permanently. Unfortunately, these balls often cost 5-7 times more than beanbags or stage balls, which often limits the use of these balls to performers and serious hobbyists. Many jugglers choose to use non-silicone bouncing balls instead, due to their far cheaper price and similar performance. Russian balls share some of the advantages of stage balls (rigidity, visibility) and some advantages of beanbags (dead drop). They have a thin shell, and most of the weight is provided by a filling of granular material (most commonly sand or salt). This gives them slightly unusual flight characteristics, but the low centre of mass makes them well suited for catches using other parts of the body than hands. Russian balls are sometimes home-made since the materials needed are cheap. This makes them well-suited for experimentation regarding different sizes and weights, with the main limitation being the availability of the shells. Play, from Italy, makes similar balls with a soft and slightly thicker shell, partially filled with liquid silicone or fine sand. Use Juggling balls are usually the first props that beginners attempt to juggle with, due to their simplicity (compared to other juggling props such as clubs) and availability. Additionally, many common types of balls can function as juggling balls for a beginning juggler (such as tennis balls or baseballs). Most novice jugglers often spend much time learning how to juggle three balls before moving on to other juggling props. However, some jugglers prefer to focus on only one juggling prop in order to achieve \\"mastery\\" of one art. For the more advanced juggler, juggling balls are often used to demonstrate basic patterns such as the cascade, fountain, shower and half-shower, and can be used to form more creative juggling patterns as well, such as patterns involving throws around the body, blind throws or catches, and throwing or catching with parts of the body other than the hands. Many advanced jugglers can juggle seven or more balls at once, but not seven or more rings or clubs. This is because juggling balls are the easiest to juggle, can be manufactured (or home-made) in small sizes and light weights, and beanbags can be underfilled to facilitate catching. However, some juggling tricks, such as those typically done with clubs or rings that involve spinning or twirling the prop are impossible or not as effective with balls, since a juggling ball appears the same from whichever angle it is viewed. The use of juggling balls in passing is, for this reason, less popular than the use of clubs, since the spin of the clubs in the air is often one of the appeals of passing with juggling clubs. Clubs are also larger and therefore easier to catch when thrown from a great height or distance. Juggling balls can also be used for contact juggling, a form of juggling in which the juggler never throws the objects. Typically, the contact juggler will use stage balls or balls specifically designed for contact juggling.  Records  The record for the most juggling balls juggled (where a \\"juggle\\" is defined as at least two throws and catches of each prop) in toss juggling is eleven (Alex Barron, 2012, 25 catches). The record for most balls juggled in bounce juggling is ten.JISCON Juggling Records. Enrico Rastelli is also widely reported to have been able to juggle ten balls in the 1920s.Enrico Rastelli.

The Gore Baronetcy, of Magherabegg (or Manor Gore) in the County of Donegal was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 2 February 1622 for Paul Gore (shown also as 1st baronet of Manor Gore, the Anglicized version). The fourth Baronet served as Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer and as Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. The fifth Baronet represented County Donegal in the Irish Parliament. The sixth Baronet was a prominent military commander. In 1764 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Gore, of Manor Gore in the County of Donegal, and in 1768 he was further created Viscount Belleisle, of Belleisle, in the County of Fermanagh. In 1772 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Ross, in the County of Fermanagh. All three titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. However, Lord Ross had no surviving male issue and the peerages became extinct on his death in 1802, while the baronetcy passed to his nephew.

Boyce (1947‚Äì1974) was an American computer scientist who was known for his research in relational databases. He is best known for his work co- developing the SQL database language and Boyce-Codd normal form. Biography Boyce grew up in New York, and went to college at Providence College, from which he graduated in 1968. He earned his PhD in computer science at Purdue in 1972. His wife Sandy, whom he met in college, was a nurse. After leaving Purdue he worked on database projects for IBM in Yorktown Heights, New York. In the short period that he had, which was not quite two years long, he co- developed Boyce‚ÄìCodd normal form. Together with Donald D. Chamberlin, he co- developed Structured Query Language (SQL) while managing the Relation Database development group for IBM in San Jose, California. He died in 1974 as a result of an aneurysm, leaving behind his wife Sandy and his infant daughter Kristin. SQL SQL was initially co-developed at IBM by Boyce alongside Donald D. Chamberlin in the early 1970s. Initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) and based on their original language called SQUARE (Specifying Queries As Relational Expressions). SEQUEL was designed to manipulate and retrieve data in relational databases. By 1974, Chamberlin and Boyce published ‚ÄúSEQUEL: A Structured English Query Language‚Äù which detailed their refinements to SQUARE and introduced us to the data retrieval aspects of SEQUEL. It was one of the first languages to use Edgar F. Codd's relational model. SEQUEL was later renamed to SQL by dropping the vowels, because SEQUEL was a trade mark registered by the Hawker Siddeley aircraft company. Today, SQL has become the most widely used relational database language. Boyce-Codd normal form Boyce‚ÄìCodd normal form (or BCNF) was developed in 1974 by Boyce and Edgar F. Codd. It is a type of normal form that is used in database normalization. The goal of relational database design is to generate a set of database schemas that store information without unnecessary redundancy. Boyce-Codd accomplishes this and allows users to retrieve information easily. Using BCNF, databases will have all redundancy removed based on functional dependencies. It is a slightly stronger version of the third normal form.

Her 2008 book about American anti-intellectualism, The Age of American Unreason, was a New York Times best seller. She is an atheist and a secularist. Jacoby graduated from Michigan State University in 1965. She lives in New York City and is program director of the New York branch of the Center for Inquiry. Life and career Jacoby, who began her career as a reporter for The Washington Post, has been a contributor to a variety of national publications, including The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The American Prospect, Mother Jones, The Nation, Glamour, and the AARP Bulletin and AARP Magazine. She is currently a panelist for \\"On Faith,\\" a Washington Post-Newsweek blog on religion. As a young reporter she lived for two years in the USSR. Raised in a Catholic home (her mother was from an Irish Catholic family), Jacoby was 24 before she learned that her father, Robert, had been born into a Jewish family. Jacoby explored these roots in her 2000 book Half-Jew: A Daughter's Search for Her Family's Buried Past. (Robert Jacoby's brother was the great bridge player Oswald Jacoby.) Her book Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism was named a notable book of 2004 by The Washington Post and The New York Times. It was also named an Outstanding International Book of the Year by The Times Literary Supplement (London) and The Guardian. Wild Justice: The Evolution of Revenge (1984) was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Jacoby also won an Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship in 1974 to research and write about the new Americans: immigration into the U.S. In The Age of American Unreason (2008) Jacoby contends that the dumbing down of America, which she describes as \\"a virulent mixture of anti-rationalism and low expectations\\", is more a permanent state than a temporary one whose basis is the top down influence of false populist politicians striving to be seen as approachable instead of intelligent. She writes that the increasing use of colloquial and casual language in official speech, such as referring to everyone as \\"folks\\", is \\"symptomatic of a debasement of public speech inseparable from a more general erosion of American cultural standards\\" and \\"conveys an implicit denial of the seriousness of whatever issue is being debated: talking about folks going off to war is the equivalent of describing rape victims as girls.\\" In February 2010 she was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers. Also in 2010, she was awarded The Richard Dawkins Award by Atheist Alliance International. = Ideas = Center for Inquiry Libraries Director Tim Binga and Susan Jacoby display a letter in Robert G. Ingersoll's hand. Jacoby has spoken about the important role secularism played in the development of political and social events in the history of the United States, and she has argued that this fact is often written out of American history by the religious right. One of the most important events in which Jacoby believes secularism played an enormous part was the writing of the United States Constitution. She has explained that it is a false claim that the founders of the United States intended the government to be religious. She believes instead that they were strongly in favor of the separation of Church and State, and that they purposely omitted the word God from the Constitution, partly influenced by the horrors that occurred in places such as France under non-secular rule, as well as inspired by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. The idea that a secular government is, in fact, necessary for the existence of religious liberty, has also been defended by Susan Jacoby. She has suggested that the religiosity of the American people, as well as the proliferation of different religious denominations in the United States, are examples of situations that have occurred precisely thanks to the existence of a secular system. Jacoby has said that the separation of church and state offered people the possibility to disagree with their church without having to oppose the established political order, which would have been impossible under a system where church and state were united. Jacoby has pointed out that the presence of some religious elements in the governmental scene of the United States is a matter of customs and not of laws, and that many of those elements are more recent than people tend to believe. She has cited as an example the pledge of allegiance, only written in 1892 and which did not include the expression 'Under God' until 1954. These words were added with the sole purpose of distinguishing the American government from the Soviet one, which was considered atheist. The influence of secularism in the Civil Rights Movement in the United States is another important subject for Jacoby. She believes that accepting the importance of secularism in the civil rights movement does not deny the role religion played in it, and while she has admitted that \\"the driving force in the early civil rights movement were the black churches of the South\\", she has also pointed out that the movement was not intrinsically religious, and that in fact, the white churches of the South were strongly opposed to it. Susan Jacoby has also highlighted the link and similarities between secularism and feminism. She has noticed that both movements gain and lose strength throughout history and are constantly renewed or revived by later generations. She has used as an example the case of Thomas Paine, whose ideas were prominent in the 18th Century but which were almost forgotten by later generations until the last quarter of the 19th Century, when they were revived by Robert G. Ingersoll. According to Jacoby, secularism is also important in feminism because the latter implies dealing with \\"overturning ideas that very conservative religions, and many parts of the Bible, have proclaimed about women for thousands of years\\". Jacoby has argued that the idea of anti- Catholicism being \\"a significant force in American life today is a complete canard, perpetrated by theologically and politically right-wing Roman Catholics . . . and aimed at anyone who stands up to the Church's continuing attempts to impose its values on all Americans.\\" Books * Moscow Conversations (1972) * The Friendship Barrier: Ten Russian Encounters (1972, British edition) * Inside Soviet Schools (1974) * The Possible She (1979) * Wild Justice: The Evolution of Revenge (1983) * Soul to Soul: A Black Russian American Family, 1865-1992 (with Yelena Khanga) (1994) * Half-Jew: A Daughter's Search for Her Family's Buried Past (2000) * Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism (2004) * The Age of American Unreason, Pantheon (2008) * Alger Hiss and the Battle for History (2009) * Never Say Die (2011) * The Great Agnostic: Robert Ingersoll and American Freethought (2013) * Strange Gods: A Secular History of Conversion (2016) See also * List of atheist authors * Freethought References External links * * Susan Jacoby article archives, The Washington Post * Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:American former Christians Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American people of Jewish descent Category:American skeptics Category:Anti-Catholicism in the United States Category:American atheism activists Category:Former Roman Catholics Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:21st- century American non-fiction writers Category:20th-century American women writers Category:21st-century American women writers Category:American women journalists Category:People from Okemos, Michigan Category:Writers from Michigan ","title":"Susan Jacoby"},{"id":"9805641","text":"is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Shiho Sugiura. It is published in the monthly magazine Ichiraci. It has been licensed for an English-language release in North America by Tokyopop, which only released nine volumes.  Overview  The story starts with a man (Chigusa Senrou) who tries to assassinate the prince of the Amato Empire and fails. He is pushed into a distortion in space and falls into the real world. Rakan, a high school student who lives by himself, returns home from school one day to find Chigusa lying unconscious in his garden, carrying a gun made of wood. Chigusa awakens, and attempts to kill Rakan, thinking him to be the prince, only to be stopped when Rakan unconsciously turns the gun into a tree. Chigusa recognizes him as a \\"Sanome\\" and decides to protect him to later bring to the Amato Empire to defeat the prince. After this first encounter, Narushige and then Touji are also brought to the real world through the portal between the Real World and the Alternate World, Amato Empire and become loyal friends to Rakan and Chigusa. When Rakan learns of the state of the Amato Empire and meeting its so-called 'prince', he forces Chigusa into allowing him to come and help stop their world from being destroyed. Rakan vowed to return the alternate world into a green one again and stop the 'prince'.  Key Terms  A Sanome or sand sprout is someone who has the ability to grow plants by simply touching the seeds or the plant itself. Their presence alone cause the plants' growth to increase, but when they touch any plant, their growth increases dramatically and comically. An acolyte for all plants. Supposedly only virgin women of the Shigeka family can bear Sanome girls. In reality, Sanome women are born from plants (a tree in particular). Sanome women can only bear Sanome boys, by a union with an ordinary man. An Ayame is a being who has the power to destroys plants and turn soil into sand by taking the nutrients of the world around them. Can also take nutrients from people. Usually seen as lizard type of creature arising from the sand. A Numbered Child is a child that has a number in their name, indicating that their family has deemed them useless. The alternate world's legal system of abandoning a child, whether because of the family's inability to feed them or because the child carries an imperfection or is a liability, instead of killing the child. The people are very superstitious and believe death brings more death. Amato Empire is the alternate world's equivalent to the country of Japan. The name means 'The Kingdom of Heaven'. Japan's name means 'The Land of the Rising Sun'.  Characters  ; Rakan Sawa : A kind-hearted high school boy with a garden that looks like a jungle, and when the flowers bloom a little too much, he gives them to his classmates and teachers for free. He lives by himself, and supports himself using his inheritance from his late adoptive grandfather. His mother and grandfather have both died. He is fond of normal household chores (cooking, cleaning, etc.) He has the power of the Sanome to grow plants and he looks like the prince of the alternate world (apparently is the prince's 'little brother'). He and his mother were found in the gardens by his adoptive grandfather, who gave him the name Rakan. His world is turned upside-down when he finds Chigusa in his garden, in the exact place he and his mother were found. He learns that he is born from a sanome and an ordinary man, who may still be alive in Chigusa's world. His attitude and hair color helps distinguish him from the ayame prince. His attitude also wins over people who may have once tried to kill him. A bish≈çnen in this world and the other world. Naive and trusts people easily. Has a righteous attitude and always tries to see the best in others. Likes to do things at his own pace. Also is always being put into suggestive positions by Chigusa, who is usually stopped by Narushige. Died together with Chigusa but was revived due to the Sanome resembling his mother. In the last chapter, he was made to repeat a year, as he disappears for almost a year and was seen living with Chigusa in Japan. ; Chigusa Senroh : Man of the alternate world with an immortal body. He suffers from amnesia, only remembering his name, his world, and his goal to wipe out all the Ayame. He needs the power of the Sanome for his battle. His family name, Senroh, means he is considered to be from a family of criminals. He, like his ancestor before him, is charged to continue hunting ayame until he goes insane. (the manga explains that his ancestor is chained in a mountain after becoming mad). He has the ability to see the 'unseen.' He can locate any objects, whether hidden or at a distance, sense if others are hostile or harmless, communicate telepathically, and enter into dreams. He often states, \\"I have good eyes.\\" His main weapon is a wooden (plant) gun, which he uses with great skill. His blood has the ability to turn into bandages and he finds it difficult to feel physical pain. Chigusa is part plant and states that as long as Rakan (a sanome, who can regenerate and grow plants) is near him, he can't die. Once thought as a merciless killer, he begins to change his disposition after meeting Rakan. At first, he attaches himself to Rakan when he learns that he is a Sanome, but he eventually develops a sense of affection to Rakan, vowing to protect him at all costs. He often displays his liking for Rakan by hugging him or picking him up (physically, or with really odd pickup lines.) He has a very blunt way of speaking, and seems to be a bit of a masochist despite his inability to feel most pain. Later it was revealed that the Senroh family consist of only one member that is Chigusa. He's been living for almost 1000 years due to experiment conducted by Hoshiminokoto. Died together with Rakan near the end of manga but was revived. In the last chapter, he is seen living together with Rakan in Japan and has taken the name 'Sawa Chigusa' there. ; Narushige Shigeka : The only man of the Shigeka family, which holds a tradition of bearing only women that can bring forth a Sanome (Later, that is found not to be true; the Shigeka family only raises the sanomes and don't actually give birth to them). As a result, he is considered an ill-omen. He is abandoned by his mother, Shigeyuki, as a sacrifice to the orochi, Mitama, but was instead treated with kindness by the giant snake. As a result, he holds a great dislike for Shigeyuki. His sister, Sae, is also later abandoned by Shigeyuki and meets up with Mitama, while trying to find where her brother once lived. He has a companion, Kou, a poisonous snake that can talk and turn into a sword, whom he met when during his youth with Mitama. Kou is very protective of Narushige and often stands up for him when someone speaks ill of his position. As one of the Shigeka family, Narushige possesses such beauty that he is sometimes mistaken for a woman at first. The second person Rakan meets from the Amato Empire. When he is swept into Rakan's world, he was rumored to have been taken by the gods in his own world. Very protective of Rakan, especially against Chigusa and can understand the foundation of how something works after observing it once. His main weapon is Kou and is an extremely talented swordsman. Later it was revealed that Narushige is the half brother of Kinrei and his father is Kingen Kinjou. ; Touji Touno : Was given a number in his name because he was born blind, and thus \\"useless\\". The Prince healed his eyes, and sent him to the real world to kill Rakan, Chigusa, and anyone associated with them. This was simply an excuse to dispose of him. the third person who Rakan meets from the Amato Empire. He is taken prisoner and after learning the truth about the prince, becomes a loyal and close friend to Rakan. When the gang arrives back in the Amato Empire, they find a group of bandits/frontier guards (number children abandoned by the prince) and discover that the leader, Kazuhi, is actually Touno's older brother. Touji means 'second light' and Touno means 'field of light'. He is usually paired with Chigusa to protect Rakan from his suggestive tendencies and isn't afraid to admit his thoughts about Chigusa. His main weapon is a bow and arrow, both grown from seeds, and is quite a good shot. He also possesses good eyesight (not by Chigusa's standards) and can see in long distances. He tends to misunderstand anything he does not understand (mostly because of Chigusa). After realizing that his eyes, gifted by The Prince, was allowing The Prince to spy on their group, Touji blinded himself. His vision is restored by Chigusa connecting Kazuhi's third eye to Touji. ; The Prince : The most powerful man in the alternate world. Believes to be able to tell the future, and can find hidden resources (water and plants). He is an Ayame, although most of his subjects do not know this. Arms are black and clawed; hair is blond. Speaks telepathically. He also states to Rakan, in answer to why he is destroying the world, that he likes destroying. Later it was revealed that he was manipulated by Hoshiminokoto. Near the end of manga, he died together with Kinrei but was revived. He immediately was attached to Rakan after Rakan hugged him. He was also made to keep watch over the shining sand as an atonement. ; Kinrei Kingen : The only one close to the prince. He is the only one who can hear the Prince's voice (the Prince communicates by speaking directly into someone's mind). As such, he is immediately assigned as the Prince's personal helper and assistant. When the Prince has something to say, Kinrei speaks for him. Though he appears to be working for the prince, Kinrei has his own agendas and is really using the prince to create his perfect, immortal world. After the prince cuts his neck , he started to care more for the prince. Died together with the prince but was revived and lives with the prince underground as atonement. ; Touno Kazuhi : The leader of Sanome Prince Guard. He used to be the type who does not care about anything, but changed when Rakan sprouted flowers from his talisman. He was abandoned by his mother. His mother gave him a talisman which is in fact a seed for light flower. He is Touji's older brother. He has a third eye on his forehead, which gives him the ability to see long distances and in the dark. Likes to tease people together with Miya. Despite his tough attitude, he cares a lot for his brother and the other guards. When Chigusa gains the ability to see and manipulate the circuits of people, Kazuhi's third eye is connected to Touji to let him see again. ; Miya : A member of Sanome Prince Guard and Kazuhi and Goushi's best friend. A member of the Yorubashi clan but was thrown out as he was a number child. Likes to tease people with Kazuhi. A twin to Yorubashi Yoruaki. Miya's fondness for reading makes him adept in creating names for the stone creatures the Prince Guard travels with. He is also responsible with renaming his and Kazuhi's name to not include a number in it. ; Goushi :A member of Sanome Prince Guard and Kazuhi and Miya's friend. Mentally the oldest out of the guard. In the last chapter, he appears to be in a relationship with Sae, Narushige's sister. ; Shigeyuki Shigeka : The head of the Shigeka clan, a clan that cares for the Sanome. A mother to Narushige and Sae. She is cold even to her children as she was able to throw out her children and called them useless. Later it was revealed that she wish for obliteration of the Shigeka clan and that she throws out her children to protect them. In the last chapter, she is living as guest in one of the Kingen's house and has reconcile with Narushige and Sae. ; Hoshiminokoto : The 'God' of the Amato Empire. He is the one who created Chigusa, Rakan, the Prince and Kinrei. Hoshiminokoto used the shining sand to communicate with people. He created the current world as an experiment and planned to destroy it to build anew. He created the prince to announce \\"prophecies\\" about upcoming disasters. Chigusa was created as a trigger for the giant snakes to turn into streams and awaken other objects that would destroy the world. :  Reception   References   External links  * Official TOKYOPOP Silver Diamond English manga site * * Review of Silver Diamond on Anime News Network Category:Adventure anime and manga Category:2003 manga Category:Romance anime and manga Category:Sh≈çnen-ai anime and manga Category:Supernatural anime and manga Category:Tokyopop titles ","title":"Silver Diamond"},{"id":"9805674","text":"USGS overhead image of the Bellevue Arts Museum The Bellevue Arts Museum traces its roots back to street fair art in 1947. After several temporary locations, it moved to the third floor of Bellevue Square, a large shopping center in the center of downtown Bellevue, Washington in 1983. In 2001 the museum finally moved into its own building. Located just across the street from Bellevue Square, the distinctive new building was designed by noted architect Steven Holl. It is seen by many residents of Bellevue as playing a role in the transformation of the downtown from series of suburban strip malls to a sophisticated city with a variety of cultural attractions. The museum subsequently ran into financial difficulties and was forced to close to the public in 2003. After a lengthy fund raising campaign, extensive interior remodeling, a slight change in name and a new focus on crafts and design, the museum re-opened on June 18, 2005 with an exhibition of teapots. In contrast to conventional art museums, Bellevue Arts Museum has no permanent collection. Rather, it emphasizes education and hands-on involvement through an extensive selection of classes and workshops.

A large manhunt for him ensued, and a white mob started rioting, attacking blacks throughout the city. The manhunt for Charles began on Monday, July 23, 1900, and ended when Charles was killed on Friday, July 27, shot by a special police volunteer. The mob shot him hundreds more times, and beat the body. White rioting continued, with several blacks killed after Charles had died. A total of 28 people were killed in the riots, including Charles. More than 50 people were wounded in the riots, including at least 11 who had to be hospitalized. Blacks made up most of the fatalities and casualties. Robert Charles (b. circa 1865) had come to New Orleans from Mississippi. He was a self-educated activist for civil rights. He believed in self-defense for the African-American community and encouraged African Americans to move to Liberia to escape racial discrimination and violence.\\"Robert Charles Riots (1900)\\", Black Past Background =White supremacy= Robert Charles Daily Picayune, July 27, 1900 Louisiana was a slave society before the American Civil War, with hundreds of enslaved people working on each of numerous large cotton and sugar cane plantations, and many others in smaller groups, including in port cities such as New Orleans. Some also worked on the steamboats that traveled the rivers. At the start of the 20th century, the population of New Orleans was recorded in 1900 at 208,946 'white' and 77,714 'negro' by the Twelfth Census of the United States.Twelfth Census of the United States, taken in the Year 1900. Volume I. Part I p. 725 Among the latter were many mixed-race people, most of whose ancestors had formerly had a distinct status as free people of color before the Civil War, particularly during the years of French and Spanish control. They are also known as Creoles of color. The white-dominated legislature, primarily Democrats, had passed a new state constitution in 1898 with provisions that disenfranchised most African Americans by making voter registration more difficult, through poll taxes, literacy tests and similar measures. After that, the Democratic-dominated legislature passed eight Jim Crow laws by 1900.[http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/resources/lessonplans/hs_es_jim_crow_laws.htm \\"Jim Crow Laws\\" , Jim Crow History website These included a law establishing racial segregation for public facilities, including interstate railroad cars, which were nominally under federal law. Plessy vs. Ferguson (1896) was a Louisiana test case of segregation on interstate railroad cars, which was appealed to the US Supreme Court. Opponents argued that federal laws and constitutional rights should apply on interstate transportation, but the Court ruled the state could establish \\"separate but equal\\" facilities. In practice, however, the \\"separate\\" facilities were seldom equal. These laws aggravated racial relations. Historian William Ivy Hair has written, \\"Signs of increasing animosity between the races were to be seen almost daily in New Orleans during June and July 1900. Both the police and press received an unprecedented number of complaints.\\"Hair ‚Äì Carnival of Fury p. 140‚Äì141 New Orleans newspapers contributed to racial tensions, as they were \\"becoming more stridently racist in their editorial columns and treatment of the news.\\" The confrontational journalistic practices of Henry J. Hearsay and the States newspaper caused racial rifts in New Orleans. Hearsay, a former major in the Confederate Army, said in one article that \\"if [negroes] listen to the screeds of agitators in the North...the result will be a race war, and race war means extermination...Then the negro problem of Louisiana at least will be solved‚Äìand that by extermination.\\"Hair ‚Äì Carnival of Fury, p. 91 =Racial attitudes= In southern Louisiana, African Americans had been allowed much more freedom than in other areas, largely owing to the racial demographics in New Orleans particularly and its history. During the colonial period, New Orleans had developed three racial groups, as was typical of other French and Latin colonies: white, free persons of color (mixed race or gens de couleur libre), and enslaved black people. Robert Charles was classified as mixed-race (mulatto in the terms of the time) and his ancestors may have been free before the Civil War. In colonial French society, free people of color had more rights and often gained education, property and more skilled jobs and professions. After the United States takeover in the Louisiana Purchase, and particularly after Reconstruction, the increasingly numerous whites from United States southern Protestant culture worked to impose the Southern binary system of classifying everyone as black or white. Mixed-race people still formed a class elite in New Orleans.http://www.knowla.org/entry.php?rec=735 By the 1900s the line of segregation separating whites and blacks (people of African descent) had been imposed in New Orleans culture, including the segregation by color on New Orleans' streetcars. Events =Altercations= At approximately 11 p.m. on July 23, 1900, three white police officers, Sergeant Jules C. Aucion, August T. Mora, and Joseph D. Cantrelle, investigated reports of \\"two suspicious looking negroes\\" sitting on a porch in a predominantly white neighborhood. They found Robert Charles and his roommate, 19-year-old Leonard Pierce, at the scene. The policemen questioned the two men, demanding to know what they \\"were doing and how long they had been there.\\" One of the two men replied that they were \\"waiting for a friend.\\" Charles stood up, which the police took as an aggressive move. Mora grabbed him and the two struggled. Mora hit Charles with his billy club. Mora and Charles pulled guns and exchanged shots. Reports vary on who drew first; both men received non-lethal gunshot wounds to the legs. Charles fled to his residence, leaving a trail of blood.Hair ‚Äì Carnival of Fury p. 119‚Äì121 Pierce, also armed, was covered by a police officer when Charles ran. Charles had returned to his residence by early the next morning, when police were trying to find him. Captain Day and a patrol wagon approached Charles's residence on the 2000 block of Fourth Street at approximately 3 a.m. on the morning of July 24, 1900. When the police tried to apprehend Charles, he fired upon them with a .38-caliber Winchester rifle, fatally hitting Day in the heart. Charles fatally shot another policeman Peter Lamb in the head. The remaining policemen took refuge in a nearby room and Charles escaped. The police started a manhunt.Hair ‚Äì Carnival of Fury p. 125‚Äì126 =Manhunt and riot= Front page of the New Orleans Daily Picayune, July 28, 1900, after Charles was killed; picture of Noiret in center; picture at upper right is Sgt Porteus On July 24 a crowd of whites gathered on Fourth Street where the policemen had been killed. There were shouts for lynching Charles, but the crowds dispersed when they were falsely told Charles had been located and jailed.Hair ‚Äì Carnival of Fury p. 144‚Äì145 On July 25, Acting Mayor William L. Mehle (Mayor Paul Capdevielle was out of town) announced a $250 reward for the arrest of Charles, while issuing a proclamation urging peace. In contrast, New Orleans newspapers, particularly the Times-Democrat, blamed the black community for Charles' crimes and called for action.Hair ‚Äì Carnival of Fury p. 148‚Äì149 In the following days, several riots occurred as mobs of armed whites roamed the streets. On the night of the July 25 they killed three blacks and wounded six more so severely that they had to be hospitalized. Five whites were also hospitalized, and more than 50 people suffered lesser injuries.Hair ‚Äì Carnival of Fury p. 153 Charles had taken refuge at 1208 Saratoga Street, where he remained safe from the police until Friday, July 27. Upon receiving a tip about the whereabouts of Charles from an informant, police searched the house. As the officers neared Charles' hiding place beneath the stairs, Charles opened fire, killing two of the officers [Sgt Gabe Porteus and Corporal John Lally]. Other officers, upon hearing the gunshots, quickly brought in reinforcements to both surround Charles and to protect the black residents from white mob violence. Historian William Ivy Hair described the scene: > The Mayor, knowing the mood of the city and fearing that some massive > butchery of the black population might take place, called upon the state > militia units, which had been mobilized since Thursday, to go to the scene > with‚Äîand he made a special point of this‚Äîtheir two Gatling guns. Capdevielle > declared that if things got completely out of hand, the Gatling guns should > be fired into the white mob. Throughout the day, the police fired on the house, where Charles returned fire from the second-story windows. By 5pm, Charles had killed or fatally wounded five law officers,His fifth victim was New Orleans Jail Keeper Andrew van Kuren and wounded nineteen other persons.Hair ‚Äì Carnival of Fury pp. 170‚Äì171 A fire captain and other volunteers snuck into the first floor beneath Charles and ignited a mattress. The smoke from the mattress forced Charles out of the house. As he tried to escape, he was shot by Charles A. Noiret, a medical student and member of the special police (a militia group of volunteer citizens). The policemen continued to shoot Charles. When they dragged his body outside, a mob of bystanders beat his body. Aftermath After learning of Charles' death, mobs of white people renewed their attacks on black residents. Police had difficulty taking Charles' body to the morgue as angry white mobs tried to mutilate his corpse. The mob killed several African Americans and burned down the Thomy Lafon schoolhouse, known as \\"the best Negro schoolhouse in Louisiana,\\"Hair ‚Äì Carnival of Fury p. 175‚Äì177 and a second black school. By the next morning, the special police and state militia had quelled the rioting and brought the city under control. Several days later, Lewis Forstall murdered Fred Clark for tipping off police to Charles' whereabouts. In total, Charles killed seven people over the course of the week, four of whom were policemen. The exact number of black casualties at the hands of the white mobs is unknown, but most sources report more than a dozen black people killed and over fifty wounded.Hair ‚Äì Carnival of Fury p. 185 http://www.nola.com/175years/index.ssf/2011/10/1900_one_of_the_bloodiest_epis.html Joel Williamson, The Crucible of Race: Black-White Relations in the American South Since Emancipation(New York: Oxford University Press, 1984) The events in New Orleans received national coverage and had ramifications beyond the state. Lillian Jewett, a young white member of the Anti-Lynching League, was fundraising at a Boston, Massachusetts meeting hours after Charles' death to raise money for the injured in New Orleans. The Louisiana Times Picayune reported \\"Insane Ravings at a Boston Meeting\\". A group of wealthy young white men from New Orleans had formed the Green Turtles the previous year. This group required an \\"oath of allegiance to white supremacy and the Democratic Party.\\" Because of this group's subsequent threats on Jewett's life, she would not travel further South than Richmond, Virginia.Hair ‚Äì Carnival of Fury p. 193‚Äì195 After the Robert Charles riots, whites intensified and increased the reach of racial segregation in the state. In 1908 the state legislature passed a miscegenation law, prohibiting interracial marriage or domestic partnerships. These were seldom enforced in cases of white men have relations with black women. Such legislation at the time was associated with the progressive movement, and was also influenced by European ideas on eugenics. Many states passed miscegenation laws in those years. In 1920, New Orleans established racial segregation in jails. The Catholic Church established a segregated parish in downtown New Orleans, the Congregation of Corpus Christi. Racial violence and hate crimes increased in frequency. New Orleans jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton recounted the 1900 riot in his 1938 oral history recorded for the Library of Congress. Lynchings were still high at the turn of the century, reflecting white efforts to suppress black voting and maintain white supremacy. The agricultural economy was not doing well, adding to economic and social tensions. See also * List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States Citations References * William R.

Je t'aime moi non plus (English title: I Love You, I Don't) is a 1976 feature film written, directed, and scored by Serge Gainsbourg, starring Jane Birkin, Hugues Quester and Joe Dallesandro, and featuring a cameo by G√©rard Depardieu.  Plot  A frail and love-starved young woman, Johnny (Jane Birkin), works in a truckstop caf√© in the middle of nowhere. One day enter two gay truckers, manly and worldwise Krassky (Joe Dallesandro) and his lover Padovan (Hugues Quester), young and handsome, but immature and rather a handful. Krassky, tired of taking care of Padovan who keeps getting into trouble, discovers in himself an attraction for this boyish girl, and she falls head over heels for him. They start a relationship; and even if at first Krassky's body hesitates before the meager feminine graces of curveless Johnny, he ends up being charmed by her na√Øve and unconditional love. She is ready to accept anything out of love for him, including anal sex, though quite inexperienced at this, so that her screams of pain cause them to be thrown out of several motels. In the end, the back of Krassky's dirty garbage truck will be the theatre of their union. Furiously jealous, Padovan tries to kill Johnny by suffocating her. Krassky intervenes and saves Johnny, but does it so idly that Johnny gets enraged and furiously insults him. Krassky then returns to his first love and leaves with him, abandoning Johnny in her caf√©, brokenhearted and lonely again.

The tree was vandalized about a year after the agreement but was repaired and survived. Location Despite some news reports to the contrary, Luna is not located in the Headwaters Forest, a preserved old growth forest, but on a windswept ridge overlooking the community of Stafford, south of Scotia. Due to its proximity to the small community of Stafford, this tree has also been referred to as the \\"Stafford Giant.\\" On New Year's Eve 1996, a landslide in Stafford caused by clearcut logging by Pacific Lumber Company (Maxxam) on steep slopes above the community resulted in most of the community buried up to in mud and tree debris; eight homes were completely destroyed. History The 1,000-year-old lightning-struck tree was named by a group of Earth First! members, who built a small platform from salvaged wood to serve as a tree-sit platform. As the moon was rising at the time, they chose the name Luna, the Latin word for moon, to commemorate the event. For 738 days, from December 10, 1997 to December 18, 1999, forest activist Julia Butterfly Hill lived on the platform in the tree, above the ground. Hill occupied Luna in order to save it and the surrounding grove from being clear-cut by the Pacific Lumber Company (owned by Maxxam Inc and Houston millionaire Charles Hurwitz). The Pacific Lumber company and Hill reached an agreement to save the tree and a buffer zone around it for $50,000 after which Hill left the tree. Later she wrote a book called The Legacy of Luna about her experiences treesitting in the giant redwood. Some of her predictions came true, as Maxxam failed in bankruptcy after cutting a 100-year timber reserve in 20 years, leaving employees and suppliers in the lurch. In November 2000, an unknown vandal used a chainsaw to cut halfway through the tree. In 2001, Eureka civil engineer Steve Salzman headed Luna's \\"medical team\\" which designed and built a bracing system to help the tree withstand the extreme windstorms with peak winds between 60 and 100 miles per hour. They were assisted by Humboldt State University professor Steven Sillett. In early 2002, naturalist Paul Donahue noted that Luna had survived the cut. Luna is currently under the stewardship of Sanctuary Forest, a Nonprofit Organization.

It was first shown at the 1983 Tokyo Motor Show and also shown at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1984. It was a showcase for new technologies in driver controls, engine, suspension, materials and aerodynamics. Driver controls Colour CRTs were used in the dash to display speed, rpm, fuel, temperature, etc. Engine and driveline It used an enhanced prototype form of the 1G-GEU engine called the LASREŒ±-X, a 1,988 cc EFI twin cam 24-valve inline six engine equipped with dual turbo- chargers and intercooler, computer-controlled valve timing, variable displacement and induction. At low speeds, the variable displacement system shut down half the engine to conserve fuel. The system never went into production but a simplified version later appeared as the 1G-GTE, slightly modified for production and without the variable cam timing and variable displacement. In search of reducing maintenance, the FX-1's engine also featured computer-controlled distributorless ignition. Transmission was via a four-speed automatic ECT (Electronically Controlled Transmission) with overdrive. Suspension It used a pneumatic suspension combined with TEMS electronic damping control. The pneumatic suspension automatically raised and lowered the front and rear of the car separately for maximum stability. TEMS was also used on the Supra and the Soarer (2 stage) and on the highest spec Crown (3 stage). Materials Many exotic materials were used, including Fibre Reinforced Metal (body panels) and Shape Memory Effect Alloy (body panels) and Ceramics (brake rotors).

The culture that produced Chankillo is called the Casma/Sechin culture or the Sechin Complex. The site covers about four square kilometres (1.5 square miles) and has been interpreted as a fortified temple. The Thirteen Towers solar observatory The regularly- spaced thirteen towers of Chankillo were constructed atop the ridge of a low hill running near north to south, forming a \\"toothed\\" horizon with narrow gaps at regular intervals. To the east and west investigators designated two possible observation points. From these vantages, the 300m long spread of the towers along the horizon corresponds very closely to the rising and setting positions of the sun over the year, albeit they are not all visible. On the winter solstice, the sun would rise behind the leftmost tower of Chankillo and rise behind each of the towers until it reached the rightmost tower six months later on the summer solstice, marking the passage of time. The Thirteen Towers of Chankillo could be the earliest known observatory in the Americas. Inhabitants of Chankillo would have been able to determine an accurate date, with an error of a day or two, by observing the sunrise or sunset from the correct tower.

She was the producer and host of Style with Elsa Klensch, CNN's weekly fashion and design television program, which ran from 1980 to 2001. She married Chuck Klensch in 1966. Biography Klensch was born on 21 February 1933 in Cooranbong, in the Lake Macquarie District of New South Wales, to Johann Ernst and Mary Margaret (n√©e Miles) Aeschbacher. She is married to Charles Klensch, whom she met in Hong Kong while he was on leave from his post as Saigon news bureau manager for the American Broadcasting Company. They were married in 1966 in wartime Saigon and then settled in New York. She has worked at the Sydney Telegraph, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Public Information Office of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. She edited the Hong Kong Trade Bulletin, Women's Wear Daily, and was senior fashion editor at Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, The New York Post and WCBS-TV. She hosted and produced Style with Elsa Klensch, which ran from 1980 to 2000 on CNN. She has also authored four mystery novels. Career as a journalist Klensch began her career in 1958, at the Sydney Daily Telegraph while studying journalism at Sydney University. With the byline Elsa Barker (she adopted Barker as her professional name because Aeschbacher was difficult for people to pronounce, spell, or remember.) She also reported for the London Star and the London Sunday Express. By 1961 she returned to Sydney and for the home journey accepted the position of press officer for the S/S Canberra maiden voyage with Pacific ports of call. Subsequently, she was a regional editor for the Australian Broadcasting's TV Weekly where she raised circulation and advertising with promotion and livelier editorial content, setting the pattern for a successful national campaign for the magazine which earned her praise for \\"splendid work and exceptional efforts.\\" From 1963 to 1964 she was a public relations officer for the Australian administration of Papua and New Guinea, editing a fortnightly newspaper and running a news service. In 1966 she moved to Hong Kong as editor and Publications Section Chief for the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, responsible for a trade-promotion magazine, as well as organizing and promoting fashion shows and international trade fairs. In 1966, she retired from her Hong Kong assignments in order to marry Charles Klensch in Saigon and move to New York where, from 1966 through 1972, she reported for Fairchild Publications. Her last assignment there was as a senior market editor at Women's Wear Daily. In 1973, Elsa moved to Vogue as a senior fashion editor and writer. In March 1976, she became the senior fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar, and then served as fashion editor of the New York Post. Her first television assignment was in 1978, when she reported for WPIX in New York City. During an August 1978 newspaper strike, local TV stations brought in newspaper columnists to give reports that would not be appearing in print. Elsa appeared on WCBS, and in a coup, persuaded Yves Saint Laurent (who hated being on TV and usually refused requests) to appear with her as a personal favor. From April 1980 through January 2001 Elsa was host and producer of CNN's Style With Elsa Klensch. The years at CNN: Style With Elsa Klensch In April 1980, Elsa joined Cable News Network (CNN) and appeared on-air from its first week in June 1980 with her groundbreaking Style with Elsa Klensch. For more than twenty years, she produced and hosted the program, which was broadcast globally in 142 countries on both CNN and its 24/7 Headline News channel. Her half hour, Style with Elsa Klensch was scheduled three times each weekend, and individually produced segments from the program were broadcast up to four times each weekday. Style with Elsa Klensch reached 2.5 million households in the United States each week, becoming CNN's highest-rated weekend feature-news program at its time. She created Style as a journalistic reflection of her own fashion and design sense. Hers was the first regularly scheduled U.S. television program reporting exclusively on the worlds of fashion, beauty and design. Its worldwide popularity established her as the preeminent TV fashion journalist. Her name became an international byword among fashion and design professionals. Elsa set the pace for television coverage of fashion. \\"I always believed that television was a natural outlet for visually exciting design, but in the first days, when I arrived with my crew to cover a show, designers resisted setting aside a place for our camera. All that changed when Style proved how powerful television could be as an international showcase for design.\\" Based in New York, Elsa traveled overseas three or four months a year to report from the other fashion capitals of Paris, Milan, Tokyo and London. She also covered fashion and design from Bali, Beijing, Havana, Madrid, Manila, Moscow, Rio de Janeiro and Sydney. The network estimated that over the years her coverage was seen by 200 million viewers worldwide. She set a goal for herself \\"I wanted to remain with my program to cover fashion and design into the new millennium.\\" Once having accomplished that, and though she still had more than two years left on her contract, she decided to leave CNN in 2001, and asked to be released to devote herself to other non-television interests. Published works In 1995, (together with Beryl Meyer) she wrote Style, a practical, illustrated advice book focused on helping women to define and develop a personal, individual style. Style was published by the Perigee imprint of the Berkley Publishing Group. It reached audiences worldwide. After leaving CNN in early 2001, she turned her attention back to writing. She created a monthly jewelry column for the Internet magazine Gem.net, and wrote articles for Elle Decor, House Beautiful, Architectural Digest, and others. In June 2002, Forge Books, a division of the Holtzbrinck Publishers group, signed Elsa to write a series of four mystery novels featuring television news producer Sonya Iverson as amateur sleuth. The first novel, Live at 10:00, Dead at 10:15, was published in hardcover in September 2004, followed by the paperback in 2005. The second, Shooting Script, came out in October 2005. The third, Take Two, was published in December 2007. The fourth, The Third Sin, was published in hard cover in 2014. Other notable professional activities While still at CNN, she wrote a weekly nationally syndicated newspaper advice column on personal style for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate and served as contributing editor of Connoisseur Magazine. She also became a regular lecturer on fashion and design for professional organizations as well as costume departments of art museums in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Toledo, Ohio, and at Auburn University and the Savannah College of Art and Design. In 1994, she appeared as herself in cameos for Robert Altman's Pret-a-Porter (Ready To Wear) and in several episodes of TV's The Bold and the Beautiful soap opera. Honors and awards Her honors include: Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) in 1987 cited Elsa for ‚ÄúConsistently bringing international fashion to the largest audience in the history of television, and for consistently ‚Äúgetting the story first and getting it right.‚Äù In 1999, she received a second CFDA Award for ‚Äúcareer achievement in fashion journalism.‚Äù Anti-Defamation League's 1995 Woman of Achievement Award.

From 1984 it was a division of Supermarkets General Holdings Corporation. It operated from a headquarters located in North Billerica, Massachusetts. At its height, the company operated 64 supermarkets in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, and Connecticut. They also operated 63 owned and franchised Li'l Peach convenience stores and 23 drugstores in Massachusetts. They also ran the successful Heartland Foods, a warehouse-style supermarket chain. In 1984, at the time of the buyout by Supermarkets General, Purity, had an annual sales of $800 million with 28 supermarkets, 13 warehouse stores and 23 drugstores. Purity Supreme and Li'l Peach had combined sales of about US$1.3 billion in 1990 before the company was bought out again by Freeman Spogli & Co., an investment firm for about US$300 million, including the acquisition of debt. In 1995, Purity Supreme was acquired by competitor Stop & Shop, agreeing with regulators to sell 15 stores to address antitrust concerns. Stop & Shop continued to operate 56 stores under the Purity Supreme name until 1997 when it renovated and converted all but three of them into Stop & Shop stores. The three remaining Purity Supreme stores were closed. Purity Supreme was led for most of its existence by Leo Kahn who started Purity Sav-Mor Markets with some of its first stores in Billerica, Chelmsford and Bedford. In 1968, Kahn bought out the Supreme Market chain of Boston and thus Purity Supreme was born.

Scott, \\"Veblen not an Institutional Economist.\\" The American Economic Review. Vol. 23. No.2. June 1933. pp. 274‚Äì77. John Commons, Wesley Mitchell and John Dewey. It emphasizes the impact of historical and socio-political factors on the evolution of economic practices, often opposing more rational approaches. In the political sense, this implies the influences actors like the state have on socio-economic practices and the shaping of institutions via political decision-making. Relevant variables for the study of political institutions include the structures that indicate voting rules, the political system, preferences and ideological leanings of leaders. Overview The institutionalist political economics perspective builds upon core theories from institutional economics and further apply them to the field of contemporary political economy. Wesley Mitchell originally differentiated the institutionalist approach to economics from previous schools of economic thought by emphasizing its focus on the cumulative process of evolutionary change in economics. Contemporary theorists further expand this definition by emphasizing the effects of the historical shift from the classical system of laissez-faire capitalism to contemporary or neoliberal capitalism in the current international economic society, in which various institutions are major actors. The institutional basis of the rights-obligations structure classically assumed of the market is also examined. This includes processes deciding how legitimate actors and legitimate objects of exchange are determined. At their core, proponents of this school of thought maintain that economics cannot be divorced from the social and political context since the market itself is an institution, which is to say is politically constructed. In this sense institutionalist political economists place themselves in opposition to neoclassical economists who assert that the market is an autonomous, apolitical domain. They also differ from proponents of the new institutional economics perspective in that institutions are viewed as being able to fundamentally shape the individual rather than as merely placing constraints on the theoretically pre-defined and unchanging individual. = Actors = J. R. Commons had discussed how institutions were the result of past choices made on the individual level. These choices then decide the structure in which the institutions operate, and how they enable and constrain market actors. The element of evolution returns by institutions changing in terms of workability, marking his pragmatist influence on the subject. Commons therefore separates himself from other institutionalists by implementing this notion of workability, absent in Veblen. The political implications here mainly effect the way in which political parties interact with private collectives in which parties maximize power and collectives maximize their own organisational efficiencies. Here reasonability is decisive for outcome according to Commons. The political dimension of these institutions lies in the way they exercise control over individual action, along with formal and informal rules and customs. An important aspect of actors within institutional approaches is their potential for morally grounded decision making, which marks a difference from rational approaches. Institutionalist approaches often consider situations in which actors act against their predicted most profitable way of action. This is where institutionalists argue that concepts like habit evolution via institutions come in. Institutionalist accounts have been used to criticize neo-liberal accounts, as it is the institutions that influence how certain actions are understood. The assumption that maximizing profits is the main goal behind incentive-making is widely held in many paradigms, including regulation theory and comparative political economy. This distinction between actors is therefore important for identifying institutional approaches.  Institutionalist economics in political case studies  The 'East Asian Tigers', considered to be successful examples of developmental states Studies of developmental states, countries with recent, fast economic development, have identified common traits that can be classified as institutional. Some of these institutionalist characteristics include elite- and bureaucracy-led intervention and weak civil society, all with the intent of creating institutions that are designed to further bolster economic and human developmental performance. The way states actively participate in the creation of institutions is therefore object of study, and how they might accomplish the structural changes within the institutions that are necessary to bring about economic development, downplaying the role of the free market. Case studies of states have identified traits belonging to institutionalist theory, such as historical influences on present situations and socio-political contestation over policies. In a study of Latin American countries economic underperformance has been linked to institutional durability, due to established elites clinging onto arrangements detrimental to national resources. In addition, dominance of these elites has been linked to their relative organizational strength, compared to the weak national elites of various Latin American countries.

Gameplay  The game is played on 2, 3, or 4 separate boards, depending on the number of players, on which the players attempt to grow corals to feed to their parrotfish. Board space is limited, so the players' corals compete with one another for space. Corals are grown by placing polyp tiles on the board. The corals come in five different colors, and each color is weak or strong relative to each of the other colors‚Äîfor example, red corals may be stronger than orange. Strong corals may overgrow weak ones, allowing the player who placed the tiles to consume the overgrown tiles. Consumed polyp tiles are strategically important, as they are required to perform certain actions and can allow a player to grow corals faster than would be possible otherwise. This hierarchy changes throughout the course of the game. All polyp tiles in a coral must be the same color. Each player starts the game with four shrimps. When placed on a coral, the shrimp claims the coral for that player and protects adjacent tiles (but not necessarily the entire coral) from being overgrown. Shrimp may be moved freely around the boards during a player's turn. There are a variety of actions which a player may take during their turn, including: * Grow a coral or start a new coral by laying polyp tiles on the board. This action required a larva cube of the same color. * Introduce a shrimp onto the board (once per turn). * Alter the dominance hierarchy of the corals. * As the player's last action, draft a larva cube and polyp tiles. At the beginning of a turn, a player may have their parrotfish eat one shrimp and the coral it is on. Players who have eaten at least one shrimp may \\"lock\\" elements of the dominance hierarchy so they cannot be changed by other players. This is important strategically, as the more dominant colors are worth more points. The game typically ends when one player's parrotfish has eaten all four shrimp, or all elements of the dominance hierarchy have been locked.  Scoring  Players' scores are based on the polyp tiles eaten by the parrotfish. Each tile is worth between 1 and 5 points, depending on where the tile is in the dominance hierarchy. For example, suppose the hierarchy at the end of the game is the following: * Grey dominates pink, orange, white, and yellow. * Pink dominates white and yellow. * Orange dominates pink and yellow. * White dominates orange and yellow. * Yellow is dominated by all other colors. In this case, grey tiles are worth five points (one point, plus one point for each of four dominated colors). Pink, orange, and white are each worth three points (one point, plus one point for each of two dominated colors). Yellow tiles, which do not dominate any other colors, are worth one point each. The player with the most points wins.

Bill 63 fell short of the expectations of many citizens (among them many Quebec Nationalists) who expected that French would become the common public language of all Quebec residents. The main criticism of the law was that it kept the existing educational system in place, under which all Quebec residents could send their children to schools whose language of instruction was either French or English.Sean Mills.

Schwartz Shalom H. Schwartz () is a social psychologist, cross- cultural researcher and creator of the Theory of Basic Human Values (universal values as latent motivations and needs). He also contributed to the formulation of the values scale in the context of social learning theory and social cognitive theory. Biography After completing his master's degree in social psychology and group development at Columbia University and completing his rabbinical studies, Schwartz received his Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of Michigan, and subsequently taught in the sociology department of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and in 1973 became a professor. From 1971-73, Schwartz was a visiting lecturer in the department of psychology at the Hebrew University. In 1979, Schwartz moved to Israel with his wife and three children. He joined the department of psychology at the Hebrew University, where he holds the post of Leon and Clara Sznajderman Professor Emeritus of Psychology. He is now retired, but continues his research activity, as well as developing and promoting his Basic Human Values Theory. During the 1970s and 1980s, Schwartz was following the studies of Geert Hofstede about human values and built upon them in his research on pro- social and altruistic behavior. His research has since included studies on the development and consequences of a range of behavioral attitudes and orientations, such as religious belief, political orientation and voting, social group relations, consumer behavior, as well as the conceptualization of human values across cultures. Schwartz is a fellow of the American Psychological Foundation and is a member of the American Sociological Foundation, European Association of Experimental Social Psychology, the Israel Psychological Association, the Society for Experimental Social Psychology, and the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. He is president of the International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology. He coordinates an international project in more than 70 countries that studies the antecedents and consequences of individual differences in value priorities and the relations of cultural dimensions of values to societal characteristics and policies. His value theory and instruments are part of the ongoing, biannual European Social Survey. Awards * In 2007, Schwartz was awarded the Israel Prize in psychology.. Main publications *Schwartz, S.

The New York Times, March 9, 2009.Ara Sarafian, \\"Talaat Pasha's Report on the Armenian Genocide\\". London: Gomidas Institute, 2011. Page 12, footnote 4. (), also known in Turkey as The Abandoned Documents of Talaat PashaOfficial 1915 document swept under the carpet. Agos, December 17, 2014. and Talaat Pasha's Black Book, is the title of a 2008 book by the Turkish journalist Murat Bardak√ßƒ±. It reproduces in modern Turkish script a selection of documents from the WWI period by Mehmed Talaat Pasha, the Ottoman Empire's Grand Vizier and Minister of Interior, that deal with the relocations of both Muslim Turks and Armenians and the expropriation of abandoned Armenian and Greek property. Its full English title is The Remaining Documents of Talaat Pasha: Documents and Important Correspondence Found in the Private Archives of Sadrazam Talaat Pasha about the Armenian Deportations. The notebook was handed over to Bardak√ßƒ± by Talat Pasha's widow Hayriye Talat Bafralƒ±, along with a batch of other documents comprising letters he had sent her and telegrammes exchanged between Committee of Union and Progress members. The book cites the resettlements in 1915‚Äì1916 of 702,905 Turks from regions under threat of occupation by Russian forces and the deportation of 924,158 Armenians in accordance with the Tehcir Law of May 27, 1915. The existence of the original documents was disclosed in 2005 by Bardak√ßƒ± in the first of a series of articles reproducing their contents in the Turkish newspaper H√ºrriyet. The first article was published in April 2005, a second in September 2005, a third full re-edit in April 2006,http://www.kitapyurdu.com/kitap/default.asp?id=443436 with a fourth appearing in the Turkish newspaper Sabah in February 2007.Ara Sarafian, \\"Talaat Pasha's Report on the Armenian Genocide\\". London: Gomidas Institute, 2011. Page 12, footnote 4. Notes The 1915‚Äì1916 resettlements cited in Talaat Pasha's Black Book of 702,905 Turks from regions under threat of occupation by Russian forces and of 924,158 Armenians. The cited figures do not fall in discordance with a February 29, 1916 letter sent to the US Secretary of State from the embassy in Constantinople (Istanbul) reporting upon the number of Armenian immigrants (for Syria only). Funds were liberated on the basis of the numbers provided. Bardak√ßƒ± denies that the data in the papers indicate that a genocide of the Ottoman Empire's Armenian population had taken place. In accordance with May 27, 1915 Tehcir Law is qualified as exposing the genocide by one Armenian source which goes on to recall the clauses of the 1948 UN Convention on Genocide. In 2011, the Gomidas Institute published a 70-page English-language book by Ara Sarafian titled \\"Talaat Pasha's Report on the Armenian Genocide\\". It contained the population statistics and other data from the Talaat Pasha papers that had been published in Bardak√ßƒ±'s book, with additional analysis that included investigating what sources Talaat Pasha might have used for his population figures. About the \\"Black Book\\", Sarafian concluded that its terminology and data should not be taken at face value, but that its existence gives insights into the inner world of the Ottoman government, and that its use of sanitised language was particularly noteworthy. Murat Bardak√ßƒ± complained that the 2011 Sarafian's translation into English of content derived from Talaat Pasha's Abandoned Documents was copyright theft, that it distorted his book, and the publisher Everest has sued Gomidas Institute on August 9, 2011.http://www.haberturk.com/yazarlar/murat-bardakci/656496-diyaspora- kitabimi-caldi Footnotes External links * Archive of articles by Murat Bardak√ßƒ± in the newspaper Sabah Category:Armenian Genocide Category:Books about Armenia Category:Books about Turkey Category:2008 non-fiction books ","title":"The Remaining Documents of Talaat Pasha"},{"id":"9806181","text":"Otakar Batliƒçka (12 March 1895, Prague, Czech Republic (then part of the Kingdom of Bohemia in Austria-Hungary) ‚Äì 13 February 1942, Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp) was a Czech adventurer, journalist, ham (amateur) radio operator, and member of the Czech-based Nazi resistance group Obrana N√°roda during World War II.

After his return to Prague, he was active in many areas: in the 1920s he took part in motorcycle races and experimented with electricity; in 1932 he registered as an amateur radio operator, and constructed his own transmitter which he presented at exhibitions and lectures, working for the Prague tram network. War years After the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia and the subsequent establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, he became a member of the Obrana N√°roda; as a radio operator he communicated with Moscow. At the same time, he started writing semi-autobiographical adventure stories for young people for the magazine Mlad√Ω hlasatel (English: Young Announcer), based on his travels. He wrote more than 150 stories. In his stories, he described his experiences, which he supplemented with stories of people he met. Death He was arrested by the Gestapo on 14 October 1941, interrogated in the Petschek Palace, and transferred to the Theresienstadt concentration camp, eventually ending in the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. He died there on 13 February 1942, probably being killed by Eduard Krebsbach. After the war, he was awarded the Czechoslovak War Cross 1939‚Äì1945 in memoriam.

She started her musical career in 1995 with the Florida punk rock band Discount which disbanded in 2000. She then co- founded the Kills with British guitarist Jamie Hince (formerly of Scarfo and Blyth Power) in 2000 in London. In the Kills' first album, Mosshart was known by her stage name \\"VV\\" and Hince was known as \\"Hotel\\". In early 2009, she joined the supergroup the Dead Weather, formed by Jack White, along with Jack Lawrence and Dean Fertita. In that band, her stage name is \\"Baby Ruthless.\\" Musical career =Discount= Mosshart formed pop-punk band Discount (for which she was the singer) at the age of 17 with skateboarding friends in Vero Beach, Florida. The band recorded their first album, Ataxia's Alright Tonight when the band members were still in high school, and began touring aggressively throughout the DIY punk underground in North America and Europe. As a front-person, Mosshart distinguished herself through her intense, erratic, and earnest stage presence. Discount's subsequent album, Half Fiction, was subsequently named the 50th Greatest Pop-Punk Album of all time by Rolling Stone magazine. The band moved from Vero Beach to Gainesville, and released their final album, Crash Diagnostic in 2000. The album reflected a move toward more angular sounds and detached lyrics than the emotionally frank pop-punk of the previous two albums. After touring in support of the album, the band played their last show in Gainesville in August, 2000. =The Kills= Before the two even met, Mosshart, while on tour with Discount, overheard Hince playing music in a squat above where she and the band were staying. She finally approached him, after which they started playing around with some music ideas. After she went back to Florida, she continued writing songs with Hince, by sending her ideas overseas to London where he lived. She became very exhausted and ill, so after saving money, Mosshart moved to London and the duo officially started. She has tattooed the date of their first concert on her left hand: 14 February 2002. In 2003, the Kills released their first album Keep on Your Mean Side. In 2005, they released their follow-up album No Wow. In 2008, Midnight Boom was released, and singles \\"U R A Fever\\", \\"Cheap and Cheerful\\", and \\"Sour Cherry\\" got much more exposure than the Kills' previous singles on shows and movies like House M.D., 90210, The House Bunny, Friday the 13th (2009 film), and The Losers. On January 11, 2011, Mosshart announced the name of the new album Blood Pressures. It was released April 5 in the U.S. and April 4 elsewhere. The album is their most commercially successful to date. During the 'Blood Pressures' tour they celebrated their 10-year anniversary on February 11, 2012. They have released a photography book called Dream & Drive of their past 9 years with the photographer Kenneth Capello. On June 26, 2014, the Kills opened for Jack White in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Dublin, for White's Lazaretto tour. Mosshart joined White to perform White's song \\"Love Interruption\\", and both Mosshart and Hince joined White to perform Leadbelly's \\"Goodnight Irene\\". On June 3, 2016, the Kills released their new album Ash and Ice. =The Dead Weather= Alison Mosshart and Jack White performing live with the Dead Weather at the Glastonbury Festival, June 26, 2009.

The lead single, Die By the Drop, was written by Mosshart, Fertita, and Lawrence. Mosshart and White jammed with Seasick Steve and John Paul Jones for the 2011 ITunes Festival. White's Third Man Records released a book made by Mosshart for her three bandmates called Shark Infested Soda Fountain containing pictures she took during their tour. In 2014, she joined Jack White on stage for his show at Bridge School Benefit to perform I Cut Like A Buffalo (from the Dead Weather) and Love Interruption with him while Dean Fertita was playing guitar. On 29 August 2013, the Dead Weather announced that they had returned to the studio to record a follow-up to 2010's \\"Sea of Cowards.\\" Announcement of their third album, Dodge & Burn, came in July 2015 for a release in September by Third Man Records. Along with four previously released tracks, remixed and remastered, the album features eight new songs. =Other= Mosshart features on the 2006 Primal Scream song \\"Dolls (Sweet Rock and Roll)\\", from the album Riot City Blues, as well as on the Placebo song \\"Meds\\", the title track of their 2006 album.

(Click on image for more details). Fluorescent image of cultivated neutrophils isolated from venous blood of human with Alzheimer Disease. Sample was treated with Hoechst 33342 dye that is used to stain DNA. The picture shows the release of DNA by a neutrophil as foggy area in the center of the view field indicating the spontaneous activation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in AD patients that is not usually observed in healthy mates. Magnification x40. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are networks of extracellular fibers, primarily composed of DNA from neutrophils, which bind pathogens. Neutrophils are the immune system's first line of defense against infection and have conventionally been thought to kill invading pathogens through two strategies: engulfment of microbes and secretion of anti-microbials. In 2004, a novel third function was identified: formation of NETs. NETs allow neutrophils to kill extracellular pathogens while minimizing damage to the host cellsNirmala GJ and Lopus M (2020) Cell death mechanisms in eukaryotes. Cell Biol Toxicol, 36, 145‚Äì164. doi: /10.1007/s10565-019-09496-2. PMID: 31820165. Upon in vitro activation with the pharmacological agent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), Interleukin 8 (IL-8) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), neutrophils release granule proteins and chromatin to form an extracellular fibril matrix known as NET through an active process.  Structure and composition  High-resolution scanning electron microscopy has shown that NETs consist of stretches of DNA and globular protein domains with diameters of 15-17 nm and 25 nm, respectively. These aggregate into larger threads with a diameter of 50 nm. However, under flow conditions, NETs can form much larger structures, reaching hundreds of nanometers in length and width. Analysis by immunofluorescence corroborated that NETs contain proteins from azurophilic granules (neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and myeloperoxidase), specific granules (lactoferrin), tertiary granules (gelatinase), and the cytoplasm; however, CD63, actin, tubulin and various other cytoplasmatic proteins are not present in NETs.  Anti-microbial activity  NETs disarm pathogens with antimicrobial proteins such as neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and histones that have a high affinity for DNA. NETs provide for a high local concentration of antimicrobial components and bind, disarm, and kill microbes extracellularly independent of phagocytic uptake. In addition to their antimicrobial properties, NETs may serve as a physical barrier that prevents further spread of the pathogens. Furthermore, delivering the granule proteins into NETs may keep potentially injurious proteins like proteases from diffusing away and inducing damage in tissue adjacent to the site of inflammation. More recently, it has also been shown that not only bacteria but also pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans induce neutrophils to form NETs that capture and kill C. albicans hyphal as well as yeast-form cells. NETs have also been documented in association with Plasmodium falciparum infections in children. While it was originally proposed that NETs would be formed in tissues at a site of bacterial/yeast infection, NETs have also been shown to form within blood vessels during sepsis (specifically in the lung capillaries and liver sinusoids). Intra-vascular NET formation is tightly controlled and is regulated by platelets, which sense severe infection via platelet TLR4 and then bind to and activate neutrophils to form NETs. Platelet-induced NET formation occurs very rapidly (in minutes) and may or may not result in death of the neutrophils. NETs formed in blood vessels can catch circulating bacteria as they pass through the vessels. Trapping of bacteria under flow has been imaged directly in flow chambers in vitro and intravital microscopy demonstrated that bacterial trapping occurs in the liver sinusoids and lung capillaries (sites where platelets bind neutrophils).  NETosis  NET activation and release, or NETosis, is a dynamic process that can come in two forms, suicidal and vital NETosis. Overall, many of the key components of the process are similar for both types of NETosis, however, there are key differences in stimuli, timing, and ultimate end result. = Activation pathway = The full NETosis activation pathway is still under investigation but a few key proteins have been identified and slowly a full picture of the pathway is emerging. The process is thought to begin with NADPH oxidase activation of protein-arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) via reactive-oxygen species (ROS) intermediaries. PAD4 is responsible for the citrullination of histones in the neutrophil, resulting in decondensation of chromatin. Azurophilic granule proteins such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase (NE) then enter the nucleus and further the decondensation process, resulting in the rupture of the nuclear envelope. The uncondensed chromatin enter the cytoplasm where additional granule and cytoplasmic proteins are added to the early-stage NET. The end result of the process then depends on which NETosis pathway is activated. = Suicidal NETosis = Suicidal NETosis was first described in a 2007 study that noted that the release of NETs resulted in neutrophil death through a different pathway than apoptosis or necrosis. In suicidal NETosis, the intracellular NET formation is followed by the rupture of the plasma membrane, releasing it into the extracellular space. This NETosis pathway can be initiated through activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Fc receptors, and complement receptors with various ligands such as antibodies, PMA, and so on. The current understanding is that upon activation of these receptors, downstream signaling results in the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. This intracellular influx of calcium in turn activates NADPH oxidase, resulting in activation of the NETosis pathway as described above. Of note, suicidal NETosis can take hours, even with high levels of PMA stimulation, while vital NETosis that can be completed in a matter of minutes. = Vital NETosis = Vital NETosis can be stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), other \\"bacterial products, TLR4-activated platelets, or complement proteins in tandem with TLR2 ligands.\\" Vital NETosis is made possible through the blebbing of the nucleus, resulting in a DNA- filled vesicle that is exocytosed and leaves the plasma membrane intact. Its rapid formation and release does not result in neutrophil death, however, the cell is without DNA, raising questions about whether a cell without DNA can be considered alive. It has been noted that neutrophils can continue to phagocytose and kill microbes after vital NETosis, highlighting the neutrophil's anti-microbial versatility. = Regulation = The formation of NETs is regulated by the lipoxygenase pathway ‚Äì during certain forms of activation (including contact with bacteria) neutrophil 5-lipoxygenase forms 5-HETE-phospholipids that inhibit NET formation. Evidence from laboratory experiments suggests that NETs are cleaned away by macrophages that phagocytose and degrade them.  NET-associated host damage  NETs might also have a deleterious effect on the host, because the extracellular exposure of histone complexes could play a role during the development of autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus. NETs could also play a role in inflammatory diseases, as NETs could be identified in preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related inflammatory disorder in which neutrophils are known to be activated. NETs have also been reported in the colon mucosa of patients with the inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis. NETs have also been associated with the production of IgG antinuclear double stranded DNA antibodies in children infected with P. falciparum malaria. NETs have also been found in cancer patients. Preclinical research suggests that NETs are jointly responsible for cancer-related pathologies like thrombosis, organ failure and metastasis formation. NETs have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV/SIV. NETs are capable of capturing HIV virions and destroying them. There is an increase in NET production throughout the course of HIV/SIV, which is reduced by ART. In addition, NETs are able to capture and kill various immune cell groups such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes. This effect is seen not only with neutrophils in the blood, but also in various tissues such as the gut, lung, liver, and blood vessels. NETs possibly contribute to the hypercoagulable state in HIV by trapping platelets, and expressing tissue factor. NETs also have a role in thrombosis and have been associated with stroke. These observations suggest that NETs might play an important role in the pathogenesis of infectious, inflammatory and thrombotic disorders. Due to the charged and 'sticky' nature of NETs, they may become a problem in Cystic fibrosis sufferers, by increasing sputum viscosity. Treatments have focused on breaking down DNA within sputum, which is largely composed of host NET DNA.

The company specialised in puppetry using black light theatre techniques, particularly animating everyday objects such as umbrellas, dishcloths, balls or shoes.  History  The company was founded by two Czech refugees from the 1968 invasion of Prague, Susan Kodicek and Rosta Cerny, along with producer Maggie Clarke. Kodicek and Cerny had worked together in the theatre for a number of years as the Black Theatre Group of Prague (as distinct from the better known Black Light Theatre of Prague), performing puppet-based Variety acts with Mike Yarwood and Paul Daniels, and two full-length shows, Plop and Big Me and the Wilting Witch for Greenwich Theatre. They moved into television when the BBC gave them a regular slot on the children's show Vision On. They moved to Granada TV for the series Daisy, Daisy where they performed black theatre segments and the in-show puppets Wriggle and Splodge, and eventually pitched a new idea for a further series Once Upon a Time, which featured a short black-theatre puppetry sequence accompanying a story with a similar theme. The show ran for several years, first with presenter Peter Davison, later with singer Mark Wynter; it transmuted into Sounds like a Story. They also contributed characters named Mr and Mrs Macaroni (notable for speaking a language consisting entirely of the names of Russian composers) to Our Backyard.  Pullover  Keen to create something more of their own, Kodicek and Cerny created Pullover Productions to make a series for pre-schoolers called Pullover. The programme was about a stuffed toy that comes to life each night and has adventures in the bedroom of its owner (played by Kodicek's son Danny). In most of the episodes, Pullover would find himself in a different world, where he would meet a friend, get into some mild peril and finally return to his world and his bed. The programme was notable for the fact that apart from a few lines spoken by the child at the beginning (he would read a short story to Pullover before going to sleep, introducing the subject of the episode), there was no speech. Instead, all episodes were scored with music throughout, providing a kind of 'narration'. Only thirteen episodes of Pullover were produced. The series was part financed by ITC Entertainment, who also handled international distribution rights. UK broadcast was by Central on the ITV Network. At its peak in 1982 it reached number 3 in the children's viewing charts. A knitting pattern, produced by Robin, which if faithfully followed would result in a home-made Pullover toy, was released. Some long-established wool shops still have the pattern in stock!  FoxTales  Following Pullover, the company created a more mainstream programme, FoxTales, adapting a number of classic Eastern European folk tales to a cast of animal characters, narrated by Grandpa Fox (again Peter Davison). The show was well received but suffered from the fact that budgets for children's programming were being cut as imported animated series became increasingly cheaper to obtain.  Later work  Kodicek and Cerny continued to produce programmes for a few more years, but eventually moved on. Kodicek went on to write and direct a feature film about her experiences as a child in Stalinist Czechoslovakia, and died in 2011. Cerny worked for the German-language branch of Czech radio and died in 2015.

The baggage cart was invented by supermarket entrepreneur and inventor of the shopping cart Sylvan Goldman.Shopping Carts: Carrying the Load Across U.S. The carts are provided in airports, large bus stations, hotels, or train stations for transporting luggage and may be free of charge. They are sometimes owned by the operator of the establishment. In some facilities carts may be provided by a contractor such as Smarte Carte for a rental fee. Baggage carts are usually built out of steel and equipped with three or four wheels. For safety reasons, they are generally fitted with a brake. Usually, a handle has to be pushed down in order to move the cart, however, in some cases, such as London airports, the handle activates the brake. Very few carts, e.g. in developing countries such as Sri Lanka, do not have this feature. Where a charge is made, this can be either a deposit, which is returned automatically when the cart is returned; or a rental fee can be charged.

She has a particular focus on the Aboriginal people of Australia, Indigenous land rights, human rights, Indigenous religions, violence against women, and on environmental issues. She is Professor Emerita of Anthropology at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and Writer and Editor in Residence at Flinders University, South Australia. Bell was born in and grew up in Melbourne. In 2005, after 17 years in the United States, she returned to Australia and worked on a number of projects in South Australia. Bell lives and writes in Canberra. Her books include Daughters of the Dreaming (1983/93); Generations: Grandmothers, mothers, and daughters (1987); Law: The old and the new (1980); Religion in Aboriginal Australia (co-edited 1984); and Radically Speaking: Feminism reclaimed (co-edited 1996). Ngarrindjeri Wurruwarrin: A world that is, was, and will be (1998) won a NSW Premier's Literary Award and was shortlisted for The Age Book of the Year Award, the Queensland Premier's History Book Award and the Australian Literary Society Gold Medallion. Evil: A novel (2005) was made into a play and performed in DC and Adelaide. She also wrote Kungun Ngarrindjeri Miminar Yunnan: Listen to Ngarrindjeri Women Speaking (2008).  Work life as a teacher, researcher, consultant, writer and editor  Bell trained as a primary teacher in the 1960s in Victoria, Australia. She returned to study in the 1970s but first had to complete high school which she did by attending night school at Box Hill High School, Victoria. Bell continued onto university and received her BA (Hons) in Anthropology at Monash University in 1975, and a Ph.D. from Australian National University (ANU) in 1981 which was based on field work with Aboriginal women in central Australia. During the 1980s, Bell held a range of positions in Australia. She worked for the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority in the early 1980s, before establishing her own anthropological consultancy in Canberra. She consulted for the Central Land Council, the Northern Land Council, Aboriginal Legal Aid Services, the Australian Law Reform Commission, and the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. She subsequently held academic posts, first as a Research Fellow at the ANU, and then as the Chair of Australian Studies at Deakin University in Geelong where she was the first female professor on staff. In 1989, Bell moved to the United States to take up the Chair of Religion, Economic Development and Social Justice endowed by the Henry R. Luce Foundation, at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1999 she moved to Washington, D.C. where she was Director of Women's Studies and Professor of Anthropology at the George Washington University (GWU). As the recipient of a fellowship in 2003‚Äì4, awarded by the peak educational body, the American Council on Education (ACE), Bell also worked closely with the senior administration of Virginia Tech as they revised their curriculum. Bell served on the Board of Trustees for Hampshire College for eight years. On her retirement from GWU in 2005 she was awarded the title \\"Professor Emerita of Anthropology\\" by The George Washington University. On her return to Australia she was appointed Writer and Editor in Residence at Flinders University (South Australia) and Visiting Professor, School of Social Sciences at the University of Adelaide (South Australia). Bell is the author/editor of 10 books, including several significant monographs on Australian Aboriginal culture and numerous articles and book chapters dealing with religion, land rights, law reform, art, history and social change. She has served on the editorial boards of several journals (Aboriginal History 1979‚Äì1988; Women's Studies International Forum 1990-) and was a contributing member of the Editorial Board for the Longmans Encyclopedia (1989) Macmillan, Encyclopedia of World Religions (2005) and the Encyclopedia of Religion in Australia (2009). Bell was a contributing consultant to National Geographic on their Taboo TV series (2002-4). Anthropological work Bell's first full-length anthropological monograph was Daughters of the Dreaming, which focused on the religious, spiritual and ceremonial lives of Aboriginal women in central Australia. The book has been in continuous print since its first publication in 1983 and subsequent editions in 1993 and 2002 engage with the debates the work stimulated. It is now well-established practice to have women's councils as part of the decision-making and consultative structures in Aboriginal affairs. Through her research and in giving expert evidence, Bell has been able to demonstrate that Aboriginal women are owners and managers of land in their own right. Bell worked on some 10 land claims for the Central Land Council, the Northern Land Council and the then Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Mr Justice Toohey. In 1986, Melbourne publishers McPhee Gribble, with Bell as author, won the competitive tender from the Australian Bicentennial Authority (ABA) to write a book about women in Australia for the 1988 Bicentenary. The book, Generations: Grandmothers, Mothers and Daughters (with photos by Ponch Hawkes) explored generations of Australian women and \\"the way the significant objects in their lives have been passed from hand to hand, generation to generation\\".from the back page blurb of the Penguin edition of Generations It focused on ordinary people through the stories they had been told by and were passing onto their female kin. Bell used an ethnographic approach to explore the commonalities of Australian women's cultures across age, time, race and region. Shortly after it was published, the book reached number one on the Age best seller list for works of non-fiction. Throughout the latter part of the 1970s, and through most of the 1980s, Bell was involved in issues about Aboriginal land rights and law reform. With lawyer, Pam Ditton, she authored Law: the old and the new. Aboriginal Women in Central Australia Speak Out (Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service, 1980) which addressed issues of law reform in Central Australia, in the wake of the passage of the Northern Territory Land Rights Act (1976). Bell worked on a number of land claim cases in the Northern Territory, particularly in central Australia, but also in and around the Top End. In the late 1990s, Bell became a key player in the Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy. In 1994 a group of Ngarrindjeri women, traditional owners of the Lower River Murray, Lakes Alexandrina and Albert and the Coorong (South Australia) had objected that a proposal to build a bridge from Goolwa to Kumarangk (Hindmarsh Island) near the Murray Mouth would desecrate sites sacred to them as women. The gender restricted knowledge that underwrote their claim became known as 'secret women's business' and was contested in the media, courts and academy. In 1996 a South Australian Royal Commission found that the women had deliberately fabricated their beliefs to thwart the development. However, the women who claimed knowledge of the sacred tradition did not give evidence at the Royal Commission because they considered it to be a violation of their religious freedoms. Five years later these women and those experts who had testified on their behalf were vindicated. In 2001, federal court judge, Mr John von Doussa, heard from all parties to the dispute and found the women had not lied. Nonetheless the notion that the women lied persists in some quarters and 'secret women's business' is used as a term of derision and disrespect. Bell became involved in this matter of gender-restricted knowledge after the Royal Commission. On the basis of her research in the SA archives and fieldwork with the women in 1996‚Äì8, Bell was convinced there was sufficient evidence to support the women's claims that there was gender-restricted knowledge in Ngarrindjeri society and that the women had told the truth. Bell's subsequent monograph, Ngarrindjeri Wurruwarrin (1998), won the NSW Premier's Gleebook Award for cultural and literary criticism in 1999. The judges wrote: \\"An erudite capacious book on the politically contentious and culturally sensitive subject of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair, in which the author allows diverse voices to be heard and refuses to simplify an inherently complicated and pressing set of issues. This is an outstanding book of cultural criticism, which brings together feminist anthropology, oral and archival history, political and legal narrative.\\" The book was also short listed for The Age Book of the Year and the Queensland Premier's History Award in 1999 and the Gold Medal of the Australian Literary Society in 2000. Ngarrindjeri Wurruwarrin is often cited as an important example of alternate ethnographic prose. Bell's most recent writing with Ngarrindjeri women, Kungun Ngarrindjeri Miminar Yunnan (2008) is a further contribution to collaborative research and writing and documents the impact of the contesting of cultural knowledge on the Ngarrindjeri. Bell continued to work with the Ngarrindjeri and from 2005‚Äì2012 lives on their traditional lands as she researched and wrote the Connection Report for their Native Title Claim.  Creative writing  Bell has also delved into the writing of fiction and plays. Her first book, titled Evil, addresses secrets within the churches and is set on the campus of an American college. Performed as a play adapted by Leslie Jacobson for the \\"From Page to Stage\\" season on new plays at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., USA, 3 September 2006 and presented as a staged reading in Adelaide, 16 May 2008. Her play \\"Weaving and Whispers\\" was performed at the TarraWarra Museum of Arts Biennial in 2014. Her short story \\"Blenders\\" appeared in Island magazine 2010.  Politics  Bell ran as an independent candidate in the 2008 Mayo by-election, caused by the resignation of former foreign minister and Liberal leader Alexander Downer. Her campaign was called Vote4Di and was supported by a campaign website. South Australian independent Senator Nick Xenophon gave support to Bell's campaign. In a field of eleven candidates and the absence of a Labor candidate, Bell finished third on a 16.3 percent primary vote, behind the Greens on 21.4 (+10.4) percent and the Liberals on 41.3 (‚Äì9.8) percent. The seat became marginal for the Liberals on a 53.0 (‚Äì4.0) two-candidate vote.  River advocate  Bell campaigned for fresh water flows for the River Murray, Lakes Alexandrina and Albert and the Coorong. In 2007, she was a co-founder of the 'StoptheWeir' website and worked with the River, Lakes and Coorong Action Group Inc to stop the construction of a weir across the River Murray at Pomanda Island (at the point where the river enters Lake Alexandrina). She administered the \\"Hurry Save The Murray\\" website and has been a frequent speaker and commentator on environmental matters on line, in the media and in preparing submissions and giving evidence to various environmental inquiries.

It is the 5th largest shopping centre in Western Australia, with several major retailers and approximately 300 specialty retailers. The Shopping centre consists of major retailers including Woolworths, Coles. Kmart, ALDI, Target, Rebel Sports, Myer, Event Cinemas and facilities including toilets, restrooms, info desk, lost and found, wheelchair hire, payphones, recycling stations, Uber and Taxi bays. The present centre was constructed in stages between 1988 with Coles and Kmart Australia, and in 1994 with Event Cinemas and Myer. In 2008 a new level was constructed for Myer. Revised plans for the $350 million Morley Galleria shopping centre expansion were approved on 11 February 2019 ‚Äî though some elements of the development are not expected to be completed until 2031. The redevelopment will expand the shopping centre floor area from 73,365sqm to 180,235sqm with the number of car bays rising from 4086 to 7200. The centre could ultimately end up with as much as 263,500sqm in floor space.  History  The shopping centre was developed as a joint construction between Colonial Mutual Group and Coles Myer. Construction started in 1989 after a fire had destroyed the Boans complex in June 1986. Construction joined three separate shopping centres ‚Äî Morley Shopping Centre (Coles and Kmart), Morley City Shopping Centre (Woolworths and Target) and Boans Shopping Centre, which were demolished to make way for Galleria. The 1994 redevelopment was designed by the Los Angeles architects RTKL Associates Inc and local firm Oldham Boas Ednie-Brown Architects, Planners & Interior Designers (now known as The Buchan Group). The centre was officially opened on 26 September 1994. In 1996, Galleria was sold in its entirety by joint owners Coles Myer and Colonial Mutual Group to Westfield Group for $289 million; the centre was renamed as Westfield Galleria. In 2003, Galleria was acquired from Westfield by Centro Properties Group for $414 million, the centre being renamed as Centro Galleria. Westfield Group continued to operate the centre until late 2004 when Centro Properties Group officially took over management of the centre. In 2012, private property investment group, Perron Group, acquired 50% of Galleria, entering a co- ownership arrangement with Centro. In mid 2012, Centro Galleria rebranded as Galleria 220 (to represent its 220 stores), and later simply Galleria, while still under Centro's management. In 2013, Centro rebranded as Federation Centres, and in November, Galleria shopping centre was rebranded as simply Galleria, to match the other centres in the chain. In 2015, Federation Centres rebranded as Vicinity Centres after merging with Novion Property Group. On 3 February 2015, a transformer exploded around 9.30am near the Woolworths loading bay area resulting in the deaths of 2 people, others suffered serious burn injuries. In March 2017, major German tenant ALDI opened outside of the complex, replacing the old Morley Library.

Food contact materials are materials that are intended to be in contact with food. These can be things that are quite obvious like a glass or a can for soft drinks as well as machinery in a food factory or a coffee machine. Food contact materials can be constructed from a variety of materials, including plastics, rubber, paper, coatings, metal, etc. In many cases, a combination is used; for example, a carton box for juices can include (from the inside to the outside) a plastic layer, aluminum, paper, printing, and top coating. During contact with the food, molecules can migrate from the food contact material to the food, for example, via blooming. Because of this, in many countries, regulations are made to ensure food safety. Food safe symbol The wine glass and fork symbol. The international symbol for \\"food safe\\" material is a wine glass and a fork symbol. The symbol indicates that the material used in the product is considered safe for food contact. This includes food and water containers, packaging materials, cutlery etc. The regulation is applicable to any product intended for food contact whether it be made of metals, ceramics, paper and board, and plastics. Use of the symbol is more significant in products which should be explicitly identified whether food safe or not, i.e. wherever there is an ambiguity whether the container could be used to hold food stuff. The symbol is used in North America, Europe and parts of Asia. It is mandatory for products sold in Europe after the Framework Regulation EC 1935/2004. In plastic containers, over and above the prescribed resin identification codes (viz; alt=‚ô≥, alt=‚ô¥, alt=‚ô∑, alt=‚ô∏), the food safe assurance is required because the resin identification codes do not explicitly communicate the food safe property (or more significantly, the lack of it). Even though the legal requirement in various nations would be different, the food safe symbol generally assures that: # The container surface is free of any toxic contaminants which could be contacted from the manufacturing process. # The container material shall not potentially become a source of toxic contamination through usage (degeneration). This is assured by estimating and regulating the \\"migration limits\\" of the material. In EU regulation, the overall migration is limited to 10 mg of substances/dm¬≤ of the potential contact surface. The specific migration for various materials would be different for different temperature levels (of food as well as storage) and for different food items depending on variables such as pH of the food stuff. The toxicity considerations of a specific material may include the carcinogenity of the substance. The regulations governing these aspects may vary in different nations.Food and Drug Administration. \\"Regulatory Report: Assessing the Safety of Food Contact Substances.\\"Food and Drug Administration. \\"Regulatory Report: FDA's Food Contact Substance Notification Program\\". Note that the \\"food safe\\" symbol doesn't guarantee food safety under all conditions. The composition of materials contacting foodstuffs aren't the only factor controlling carcinogen migration into foodstuffs; there are other factors that can have a significant role in food safety. Examples include: the temperature of food products, the fat content of the food products and total time of contact with a surface. The safety of foam food containers is currently debated and is a good example of all three of these factors at play. Polystyrene may melt when in contact with hot or fatty foods and may pose a safety risk. In the United States, materials in contact with food may not contain more than 1% polystyrene by weight (0.5% for fatty foods). Legislation = European Union = The framework Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and repealing Directives 80/590/EEC and 89/109/EEC, Official Journal of the European Union L338, 4‚Äì17 (2004) applies to all food contact materials. Article 3 contains general safety requirements such as not endanger human health, no unacceptable change in the composition and no deterioration of the organoleptic characteristics. Article 4 set out special requirements for active and intelligent materials. Article 5 specifies measures for groups of materials that may be detailed in separate regulations of directives. Member States may maintain or adopt national provisions (Article 6).website on food contact materials Articles 7‚Äì14 and 22‚Äì23 deal with the requirements and application for authorisation of a substance, modification of authorisation, the role of the European Food Safety Authority, the Member States and the Community. Article 15 is about labeling of food contact materials not yet in contact with food. Article 16 requires a declaration of compliance and appropriate documentation that demonstrate compliance. Articles 17‚Äì21 deal with traceability, safeguard measures, public access of applications, confidentiality, and data sharing. Article 24 sets out the inspection and control measures. Specific measures for materials and articles such as ceramics, regenerated cellulose, plastics, gaskets and active and intelligent materials, and substances such as vinyl chloride, N-nitrosamines and N-nitrostable substances in rubber, and epoxy derivatives, exist.Legislative list of food contact materials in the European Union EU No 10/2011 is applicable regulation for all the Food contact material or Article made up of Plastics. = United States = The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers three different types of food additives: * Direct food additives ‚Äì components added directly to the food * Secondary direct food additives ‚Äì components that are added to the food due to food treatment like treating food with ionic resins, solvent extraction * Indirect food additives ‚Äì substances that may come into contact with food as part of packaging or processing equipment, but are not intended to be added directly to food The food contact materials are described in the Code of Federal Legislation (CFR): 21 CFR 174 ‚Äì 21 CFR 190.

He was one of the most influential music figures in Catalan music during the latter half of the 20th century. Biography =Life= Montsalvatge was born in Girona, and studied violin and composition at the Barcelona Conservatory. His principal teachers were Llu√≠s Maria Millet, Enric Morera, Jaume Pahissa, and Eduard Toldr√†. After the Spanish Civil War, Montsalvatge began work as a music critic when he joined the weekly Destino in 1942, a publication he would eventually direct in 1968 and 1975. He wrote additionally for the daily La Vanguardia after 1962. Montsalvatge also returned to teach at his alma mater, becoming a lecturer in 1970, and then a professor of composition in 1978. He was awarded Spain's Premio Nacional de M√∫sica for composition in 1985. He died in Barcelona, aged 90 and was buried at the Sant Gervasi Cemetery Barcelona. =Work= Montsalvatge's style evolved over several different phases. At the start of his career, he was strongly influenced by the twelve-tone technique and by Wagnerism, which together dominated the Catalan music scene during the period represented by his Sinfon√≠a mediterr√°nea of 1949. In the following period, he found inspiration in the music of the Antilles (Cinco canciones negras, 1945; Cuarteto indiano, 1952). His steady contact with the French composers Olivier Messiaen and Georges Auric led to a crucial change in his style, which soon became characterized by free polytonality (Partida, 1958). The final phase of Montsalvatge's work revealed the influence of the avant-garde. Montsalvatge explored virtually all musical forms in his composition. His work ranges in scale from operas (El gato con botas, Una voz en off) to chamber music (Cuarteto indiano), in between which lie his orchestral works, such as the Desintegraci√≥n morfol√≥gica de la Chacona de Bach, the Laberinto o Sinfon√≠a de r√©quiem, and the prizewinning Sinfon√≠a mediterr√°nea. He owed his international fame chiefly to one charming and outstanding work: the Cinco canciones negras for mezzo-soprano and orchestra, a blend of Antillean rhythms and themes; among them, the best known is the Canci√≥n de cuna para dormir un negrito (Lullaby to sleep a black child). He wrote film music and in 1987, his score for the picture Dragon Rapide, about Francisco Franco, was nominated as the best original music at the Goya Awards.

Mainstream scientists dismiss his theories as fringe science. Biography Ruggero Maria Santilli was born September 8, 1935) in Capracotta. He studied physics at the University of Naples and earned his PhD in physics from the University of Turin, graduating in 1965. He held various academic positions in Italy until 1967, when he took a position at University of Miami; a year later he moved to Boston University, and subsequently held visiting scientist positions at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. In September 1981, Santilli established a one-man organization, the Institute for Basic Research in Boston; he told a reporter from St. Petersburg Times in 2007 that he left Harvard because scientists there viewed his work as \\"heresy\\". In 1982 Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper wrote that Santilli's calls for tests on the validity of quantum mechanics within nuclear and hadronic structures, represented a return to scientific sanity. In 1985 he published a book, Il Grande Grido: Ethical Probe on Einstein's Followers in the U.S.A, an Insider's View, in which he said that in many institutions there is an effective conspiracy to suppress or not investigate novel theories which may conflict with established scientific theories, such as Einstein's theory of relativity. According to Santilli, institutions receive funding and have established entire departments dedicated to long established theories, and so he argues that these same institutions are ill-equipped to challenge their own scientific paradigms with new theories. Santilli claimed that a number of scientists, including Nobel Laureates Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg, conspired to stop him from conducting research which might have led to the inapplicability of part of Einstein's theory of relativity while he was at Harvard. He has complained that papers he has submitted to peer-reviewed American Physical Society journals were rejected because they were controlled by a group of Jewish physicists led by Weinberg. Santilli has filed a number of lawsuits alleging the suppression of his scientific ideas, including a lawsuit against the magazine Infinite Energy. Santilli worked on new mathematics and new understandings of physics, to address what he saw as unsolved problems in quantum chemistry; he has published papers and books describing new chemical species called \\"magnecules\\" that he says are explained by his mathematics and theories. He told the reporter from St. Petersburg Times that the scientific establishment has not accepted this work. Around 1990 he moved with the institute back to Florida. In Florida he worked as a consultant and started companies to support the development and commercialization of his work. In 1990 his publishing company, Hadronic Press, Inc, was registered in Florida under the names of Santilli and his wife. Santilli consulted for a company called EarthFirst from 1998 to 2001, and after the relationship ended he sent letters to several of EarthFirst's clients saying they were infringing patents he owned on MagneGas. This led to five years of litigation. In 2007 he founded MagneGas Corporation which went public through a reverse merger in early 2008; the reconstituted company acquired a license to Santilli's inventions in the territory of the western hemisphere from a company called Hyfuels, Inc. of which Santilli was the CEO, and later that year directly acquired other patents and trademarks related to MagneGas from Santilli. Index page According to MagneGas' annual report for the financial year ending December 31, 2017, Santilli's son, Ermanno, was the President and CEO, and due to their holdings of preferred stock, \\"the Santilli Family has the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by stockholders of our company.\\" His wife Carla is a director. Their daughter and Ermanno's sister, Luisa Ingargiola, is a director and was formerly the CFO. Ruggero had no executive or director role, but the licenses with Hyfuels remain in place and he \\"personally contributed a small refinery\\" for the company's use. As of Nov 2nd, 2018, Carla Santilli and Luisa Ingargiola had both resigned from their roles as directors with the company and Ermanno Santilli had stepped down as CEO. After an explosion at its facility in 2016, the company changed its raw material from organic waste to soybean oil. As of 2018, the company was not profitable; it had revenue from selling its gas to metalworking companies as an alternative to acetylene, and aspired to compete more broadly with natural gas. As of 2018 two people had been killed and one person injured by MagneGas canisters; as of July 2018 the company was under investigation by OSHA as well as the US gas transport regulator. In 2013, Santilli became involved with another publicly traded company called Thunder Fusion Corporation, formed when a publicly traded shell company acquired intellectual property generated by Santilli around fusion power that had been owned by Hyfuels. Index page. The company changed its name to Thunder Energies Corporation in 2014. Index page Thunder Energies said that it developed a telescope that could detect galaxies, asteroids and other objects in space that were made of antimatter, and in early 2016 Santilli announced that the company had taken pictures of otherwise invisible antimatter objects on Earth. Order adopting the report Santilli claimed he was able to use the telescope‚Äîa standard, commercial telescope re-fitted with concave lenses, to view antimatter galaxies and images that he interpreted as invisible beings. He planned to sell the telescopes to amateur astronomers in America. In 2016, Santilli sued Dutch mathematician and skeptic Pepijn van Erp, his webhost, and the chairman of Skepsis Foundation over blog postings in which van Erp had criticized Santelli's work as pseudoscience and ridiculous. The suit against the foundation's chairman was dismissed in August 2018 and shortly thereafter the suit against van Erp was settled. In 2017 an article in Perspectives on Science described Santilli's Institute for Basic Research as follows: \\"The substance of the IBR's program is more directed at a Kuhnian rather than an institutional revolution but the readiness with which its supporters endorse the idea of a Jewish conspiracy could class it as having revolutionary intent and being norm violating. Its strong leadership style suggests pathological individualism and an emphasis on opposition to mainstream science.\\" It also noted, describing tendencies of advocates for fringe science: \\"...there is a surprising readiness to discuss the possibility that the resistance of the mainstream to fringe ideas is the consequence of mainstream cabals, particularly, a Jewish conspiracy. The website scientificethics.org, makes allegations of Jewish corruption and scientific gangsterism as a cause of the 'persecut[ion] of the Italian American scientist R. M. Santilli,' leading to the suppression of unorthodox scientific ideas, particularly those that conflict with 'organized Jewish interests on Einstein.'\\" Selected publications   * References External links * Category:1935 births Category:21st-century American physicists Category:Italian physicists Category:Living people Category:American conspiracy theorists Category:University of Turin alumni Category:People from the Province of Isernia Category:University of Naples Federico II alumni Category:Fringe science ","title":"Ruggero Santilli"},{"id":"9806491","title":"World Maths Day"},{"id":"9806510","text":"A plate depicting the Trial of Charles I in January 1649, from John Nalson's \\"Record of the Trial of Charles I, 1688\\" in the British Museum. The High Court of Justice was the court established by the Rump Parliament to try Charles I, King of England, Scotland and Ireland. Even though this was an ad hoc tribunal that was specifically created for the purpose of trying the king, its name was eventually used by the government as a designation for subsequent courts. Background The English Civil War had been raging for nearly an entire decade. After the First English Civil War, the parliamentarians accepted the premise that the King, although wrong, had been able to justify his fight, and that he would still be entitled to limited powers as King under a new constitutional settlement. By provoking the Second English Civil War even while defeated and in captivity, Charles was held responsible for unjustifiable bloodshed. The secret \\"Engagement\\" treaty with the Scots was considered particularly unpardonable; \\"a more prodigious treason\\", said Oliver Cromwell, \\"than any that had been perfected before; because the former quarrel was that Englishmen might rule over one another; this to vassalize us to a foreign nation.\\" Cromwell up to this point had supported negotiations with the king but now rejected further negotiations. In making war against Parliament, the king had caused the deaths of thousands. Estimated deaths from the first two English civil wars has been reported as 84,830 killed with estimates of another 100,000 dying from war-related disease. The war deaths totalled approximately 3.6% of the population, estimated to be around 5.1 million in 1850. Following the second civil war, the New Model Army and the Independents in Parliament were determined that the King should be punished, but they did not command a majority. Parliament debated whether to return the King to power and those who still supported Charles's place on the throne, mainly Presbyterians, tried once more to negotiate with him. Furious that Parliament continued to countenance Charles as King, troops of the New Model Army marched on Parliament and purged the House of Commons in an act later known as \\"Pride's Purge\\" after the commanding officer of the operation. On Wednesday, 6 December 1648, Colonel Thomas Pride's Regiment of Foot took up position on the stairs leading to the House, while Nathaniel Rich's Regiment of Horse provided backup. Pride himself stood at the top of the stairs. As Members of Parliament (MPs) arrived, he checked them against the list provided to him. Troops arrested 45 MPs and kept 146 out of parliament. Only seventy-five people were allowed to enter and, even then, only at the army's bidding. On 13 December, the \\"Rump Parliament\\", as the purged House of Commons came to be known, broke off negotiations with the King. Two days later, the Council of Officers of the New Model Army voted that the King be moved to Windsor \\"in order to the bringing of him speedily to justice\\".\\"Historical preface: 1647‚Äì49\\", Charters and Documents relating to the City of Glasgow 1175‚Äì1649, Part 1 (1897), pp. CDLXXV‚ÄìDXIX. Accessed 12 March 2007. In the middle of December, the King was moved from Windsor to London. The role of Parliament in ending a reign Neither the involvement of Parliament in ending a reign nor the idea of trying a monarch was entirely novel. In two prior examples, the parliament had requested both the abdication of Edward II, and that of Richard II, in 1327 and 1399 respectively. However, in both these cases, Parliament acted at the behest of the new monarch. Parliament had established a regency council for Henry VI, although this was at the instigation of senior noblemen and Parliament claimed to be acting in the King's name. In the case of Lady Jane Grey, Parliament rescinded her proclamation as queen. She was subsequently tried, convicted and executed for high treason, but she was not brought to trial while still a reigning monarch. Establishing the court After the King had been moved to London, the Rump Parliament passed a Bill setting up what was described as a High Court of Justice in order to try Charles I for high treason in the name of the people of England. The bill initially nominated 3 judges and 150 commissioners, but following opposition in the House of Lords, the judges and members of the Lords were removed. When the trial began, there were 135 commissioners who were empowered to try the King, but only 68 would ever sit in judgement. The Solicitor General John Cook was appointed prosecutor. Charles was accused of treason against England by using his power to pursue his personal interest rather than the good of England. The charge against Charles I stated that the king, \\"for accomplishment of such his designs, and for the protecting of himself and his adherents in his and their wicked practices, to the same ends hath traitorously and maliciously levied war against the present Parliament, and the people therein represented\\", that the \\"wicked designs, wars, and evil practices of him, the said Charles Stuart, have been, and are carried on for the advancement and upholding of a personal interest of will, power, and pretended prerogative to himself and his family, against the public interest, common right, liberty, justice, and peace of the people of this nation\\". The indictment held him \\"guilty of all the treasons, murders, rapines, burnings, spoils, desolations, damages and mischiefs to this nation, acted and committed in the said wars, or occasioned thereby\\". Although the House of Lords refused to pass the bill and the Royal Assent naturally was lacking, the Rump Parliament referred to the ordinance as an \\"Act\\" and pressed on with the trial anyway. The intention to place the King on trial was re- affirmed on 6 January by a vote of 29 to 26 with An Act of the Commons Assembled in Parliament.Edwards, G., The Last Days of Charles I, Sutton, 1999. citing Wedgwood, p. 122. At the same time, the number of commissioners was reduced to 135 any twenty of whom would form a quorum when the judges, members of the House of Lords and others who might be sympathetic to the King were removed. The commissioners met to make arrangements for the trial on 8 January when well under half were present a pattern that was to be repeated at subsequent sessions. On 10 January, John Bradshaw was chosen as President of the Court. During the following ten days, arrangements for the trial were completed; the charges were finalised and the evidence to be presented was collected. Trial The trial began on 20 January 1649 in Westminster Hall, with a moment of high drama. After the proceedings were declared open, Solicitor General John Cook rose to announce the indictment; standing immediately to the right of the King, he began to speak, but he had uttered only a few words when Charles attempted to stop him by tapping him sharply on the shoulder with his cane and ordering him to \\"Hold\\". Cook ignored this and continued, so Charles poked him a second time and rose to speak; despite this, Cook continued. At this point Charles, incensed at being thus ignored, struck Cook across the shoulder so forcefully that the ornate silver tip of the cane broke off, rolled down Cook's gown and clattered onto the floor between them. With nobody willing to pick it up for him, Charles had to stoop down to retrieve it himself. When given the opportunity to speak, Charles refused to enter a plea, claiming that no court had jurisdiction over a monarch. He believed that his own authority to rule had been due to the divine right of kings given to him by God, and by the traditions and laws of England when he was crowned and anointed, and that the power wielded by those trying him was simply that of force of arms. Charles insisted that the trial was illegal, explaining, \\"No learned lawyer will affirm that an impeachment can lie against the King ... one of their maxims is, that the King can do no wrong.\\" Charles asked \\"I would know by what power I am called hither. I would know by what authority, I mean lawful [authority]\\".Charles I opening speech at his trial Charles maintained that the House of Commons on its own could not try anybody, and so he refused to plead. The court challenged the doctrine of sovereign immunity and proposed that \\"the King of England was not a person, but an office whose every occupant was entrusted with a limited power to govern 'by and according to the laws of the land and not otherwise'.\\" The court proceeded as if the king had pleaded guilty (pro confesso), rather than subjecting Charles to the peine forte et dure, that is, pressing with stones, as was standard practice in case of a refusal to plead.‚ÄìJenkins, J. P. \\"Peine forte et dure\\". Encyclopaedia Britannica. Accessed 22 September 2019 However, witnesses were heard by the judges for \\"the further and clearer satisfaction of their own judgement and consciences\\". Thirty witnesses were summoned, but some were later excused. The evidence was heard in the Painted Chamber rather than Westminster Hall. King Charles was not present to hear the evidence against him and he had no opportunity to question witnesses. The King was declared guilty at a public session on Saturday 27 January 1649 and sentenced to death. His sentence read: \\"That the court being satisfied that he, Charles Stuart, was guilty of the crimes of which he had been accused, did judge him tyrant, traitor, murderer, and public enemy to the good people of the nation, to be put to death by the severing of his head from his body.\\" To show their agreement with the sentence, all of the 67 Commissioners who were present rose to their feet. During the rest of that day and on the following day, signatures were collected for his death warrant. This was eventually signed by 59 of the Commissioners, including two who had not been present when the sentence was passed.\\"The Death Warrant of King Charles I\\". House of Lords Record Office. Execution King Charles was beheaded in front of the Banqueting House of the Palace of Whitehall on 30 January 1649. He declared that he had desired the liberty and freedom of the people as much as any; > but I must tell you that their liberty and freedom consists in having > government. ... It is not their having a share in the government; that is > nothing appertaining unto them. A subject and a sovereign are clean > different things. Francis Allen arranged payments and prepared accounts for the execution event. Aftermath Following the execution of Charles I, there was further large- scale fighting in Ireland, Scotland and England, known collectively as the Third English Civil War. A year and a half after the execution, Prince Charles was proclaimed King Charles II by the Scots and he led an invasion of England where he was defeated at the Battle of Worcester. This marked the end of the civil wars. The High Court of Justice during the Interregnum The name continued to be used during the interregnum (the period from the execution of Charles I until the restoration). James Earl of Cambridge was tried and executed on 9 March 1649 by the 'High Court of Justice'. In subsequent years the High Court of Justice was reconstituted under the following Acts, all voided upon the Restoration since they did not receive royal assent: * March 1650: An Act for Establishing an High Court of Justice * August 1650: An Act giving further Power to the High Court of Justice * December 1650: An Act for Establishing an High Court of Justice within the Counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Huntington, Cambridge, Lincoln, and the Counties of the Cities of Norwich and Lincoln, and within the Isle of Ely. * November 1653: An Act For The Establishing An High Court of Justice. On 30 June 1654, John Gerard and Peter Vowell were tried for high treason by the High Court of Justice sitting in Westminster Hall. They had planned to assassinate the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell and restore Charles II as king. The plotters were found guilty and executed. The restoration and beyond After the Restoration in 1660, all who had been active in the court that had tried and sentenced Charles I were targets for the new king. Most of those that were still alive attempted to flee the country. Many fled to the Continent while several of the regicides were sheltered by leaders of New Haven Colony. With the exception of the repentant and eventually pardoned Richard Ingoldsby, all those that were captured were executed or sentenced to life imprisonment. The charges against the king were echoed in the American colonists against George III a century later, that the king had been \\"trusted with a limited power to govern by and according to the laws of the land, and not otherwise; and by his trust, oath, and office, being obliged to use the power committed to him for the good and benefit of the people, and for the preservation of their rights and liberties; yet, nevertheless, out of a wicked design to erect and uphold in himself an unlimited and tyrannical power to rule according to his will, and to overthrow the rights and liberties of the people...\\" References * * The Hon Justice Michael Kirby AC CMG The trial of King Charles I - defining moment for our constitutional liberties, to the Anglo-Australasian Lawyers' association, on 22 January 1999. * February 1649 An Act to prevent the printing of any the Proceedings in the High Court of Justice, Erected for Trying of James Earl of Cambridge, and others, Without leave of the House of Commons, or the said Court * British History online Further reading *Trial of King Charles I - UK Parliament Living Heritage * Full text of the Ordinance that established the court * Victor Louis Stater.

Life Gueinzius was born in Trotha, a suburb of Halle. In his youth he attended the grammar school \\"Franckesche Stiftung\\" in Halle, but showed little academic inclination. In 1833 he became an apprentice apothecary, and was employed at the hospital of Charit√© in Berlin between 1836 and 1837. Working at a pharmacy in Dessau, he made the acquaintance of the police director Brueckner who introduced him to the founder of the zoological museum in Leipzig, Professor Eduard Friedrich P√∂ppig. Gueinzius was probably trained at Leipzig under P√∂ppig. He arrived in the Cape Colony in 1838 and registered as an apothecary. From 1839 to 1840 he collected in the Cape Colony, in particular in the Stellenbosch district and lived in the house of the lay magistrate Theunissen in Somerset West, about 40 km southeast of Cape Town. Around 1840 he moved to the Swellendam area where he worked as a tutor at Morkel's farm Onverwacht in the Hottentots Holland until 1841, when he left for Natal, on an English war frigate commanded by John Marshall, shortly before Natal's annexation by the United Kingdom in 1843. Initially all his specimens were sent to P√∂ppig, who praised the quality of his collecting in a letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker. P√∂ppig lodged these specimens under his own name in his herbarium, which has since been moved to Vienna. P√∂ppig collected extensively in Central and South America, never visiting South Africa. Gueinzius settled on the Tugela River and supplied the medical needs of the Zulu chief Mpande (Dingaan's half-brother) and his wives. Returning from an expedition to the north, he found that armed conflict had erupted between the English, Boers and Zulus, and that his home had been plundered by British troops. With no reparation forthcoming and destitute, he left Natal to stay with friends in Cape Town. Here he met Charlotte Tayler, the young sister of two English businessmen. Despite being attracted to her, no permanent relationship resulted, largely because of his impoverished state. His relationship with the druggist Juritz in Cape Town, who was to send his collections and letters to Europe, fared no better when it transpired that Juritz had held back letters and had appropriated collection pieces for himself. Gueinzius returned to Natal in 1844 on the schooner Margaret, after a storm-tossed journey of sixteen days. He stayed at first with a friend, Campion, and found that almost all the Boer families he had known earlier, had left Natal and gone north to escape British dominion. Owing money to Juritz in Cape Town and with his health failing, Gueinzius wrote to P√∂ppig on 12 December 1848, holding him accountable for a large part of his financial woes in that his reimbursements to Gueinzius were few and paltry. He now turned to the company of W. Schl√ºter in Halle, to buy his collected items - his ornithological collection ended up at the museum of Leipzig University, insects at the museum in Stettin, and the Ethnology Museum in Dresden gained an ethnographic collection of the Bantu tribes of Natal. With the independence of Natal as an English crown colony in 1856, Gueinzius acquired a small piece of land. Here he had meetings with other German colonists sent out by Jonas Bergtheil of Bramsche in order to establish a cotton-growing industry in Natal - the \\"Natal Cotton Company\\". These colonists had settled in a place they called Neu-Deutschland, today part of the suburb of Westville in Durban. The cotton endeavour soon failed and the Germans turned to growing vegetables to satisfy the growing demands of Durban. Some of the Germans settled in New Hanover outside Pietermaritzburg. The missionary Karl Wilhelm Posselt (1815-1885) of the Berlin Missionary Society had moved to the mission station Christianenburg, near Neu-Deutschland, in 1858. He wrote \\"A German naturalist, named Gueinzius ... lives in this forest fissure. He leads an ingenious hermit life, very lonesome in the forest among the birds, and four-footed and crawling animals with which he has an affinity. He collects beetles and butterflies, stuffs birds and also dabbles in the spiritual world\\". Gueinzius also shared his home with a python. In addition to specimens of flowering plants, he collected marine algae, mosses and ferns, as well as bats, snakes and insects. He often raised butterflies from larvae and eggs. Contemporary writings describe him as striking in appearance with a wide knowledge of the natural world. He died at Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, shortly before he was due to return to Germany to live with his brother Karl August Gueinzius in the Province of Saxony. Legacy Gueinzius is commemorated in numerous specific names such as Combretum gueinzii Sond., Rhus gueinzii Sond., Psoralea gueinzii Harv., Asplenium gueinzii Mett., Fabronia gueinzii Hampe and Keetia gueinzii (Sond.)

Before the advent of chiropractors, osteopaths and physical therapists, bonesetters were the main providers of this type of treatment. Traditionally, they practiced without any formal training in accepted medical procedures. Bonesetters would also reduce joint dislocations and \\"re-set\\" bone fractures. History The practice of joint manipulation and treating fractures dates back to ancient times and has roots in most countries. The earliest known medical text, the Edwin Smith papyrus of 1552 BC, describes the Ancient Egyptian treatment of bone-related injuries. These early bonesetters would treat fractures with wooden splints wrapped in bandages or made a cast around the injury out of a plaster-like mixture. It is not known whether they performed amputations as well. In the 16th century, monks and nuns with some knowledge of medicine went on to become healers and bonesetters after the dissolution of monasteries in the British Isles. However, many bonesetters were non-religious and the majority of them were self-taught. Their skills were then passed on from generation to generation, creating families of bonesetters. Notable families include the Taylor family of Whitworth and the Matthew family of the Midlands. With the advancement of modern medicine beginning in the 18th century, bonesetters began to be recognised for their efficiency in treatment but did not receive the praise or status that physicians did. Some of these self-taught healers were considered legitimate, while others were perceived as \\"quacks\\". In Great Britain, one of the most famous was the bonesetter Sally Mapp (d. 1737). Known as \\"Crazy Sally\\", she learned her skill from her father and was known for her arm strength and ability to reset almost any bone. Though she lacked the medical education of physicians, she successfully treated dislocated shoulders and knees, among other treatments, at the Grecian Coffee House in London and in the town of Epsom. Bonesetters treated the majority of the population since they were cheaper than licensed physicians. Royal families would employ bonesetters when the court physicians were inadequate or inefficient. The Apothecaries Act 1815 in Great Britain called for surgeons to take courses similar to physicians, a move that would raise the status of surgeons to be more in line with that of the elite physician. This allowed for some bonesetters to transition into the medical profession and encouraged interest in bone and joint surgery. As a result, surgical instruments and tools for bone-related injuries were then developed. 21st century In some developing countries, traditional bonesetters are popular and can be the only address for treatment of bone-related injuries. Most often it will be the case that there is a shortage of orthopedic doctors and surgeons in the country and so the two practitioners coexist in the same setting. In parts of South America, Asia and Africa, traditional bonesetters treat musculoskeletal injuries in general, not just fractures and dislocations.

It was also the first occasion on which the UN had taken over the administration of an independent state, organised and run an election (as opposed to monitoring or supervising), had its own radio station and jail, and been responsible for promoting and safeguarding human rights at the national level.  History  UNTAC was established in February 1992 under United Nations Security Council Resolution 745 in agreement with the State of Cambodia, the de facto government of the country at that time, to implement the Paris Peace Accords of October 1991. UNTAC was the product of intense diplomatic activity over many years. Headed by Chief of Mission Yasushi Akashi (Japan), Force Commander Lieutenant-General John Sanderson (Australia), and Police Commissioner Brigadier-General Klaas Roos (Netherlands), UNTAC involved approximately 15,900 military, 3,400 civilian police, 2,000 civilians and 450 UN Volunteers, as well as locally recruited staff and interpreters. During the electoral period, more than 50,000 Cambodians served as electoral staff and some 900 international polling station officers were seconded from Governments. The whole operation cost over $1.6 billion (equivalent to $2.5 billion in 2017), mostly in salaries for expatriates. The 46 participating countries providing military observers, police, or troops were:                 * *Cambodia. Lonely Planet =Goals= UNTAC's aim was to restore peace and civil government in a country ruined by decades of civil war and Cold War machinations, to hold free and fair elections leading to a new constitution and to \\"kick-start\\" the rehabilitation of the country. It was to exercise 'supervision' or 'supervision or control' over all aspects of government, including foreign affairs, national defence, finance, public security and information, and to supervise, monitor and verify the withdrawal and non-return of foreign military forces; to canton, disarm and demobilise Cambodia's fighting factions, confiscate caches of weapons and military supplies, promote and protect human rights, oversee military security and maintain law and order, repatriate and resettle refugees and displaced persons, assist in mine clearance and the establishment of training programmes in mine clearance and mine awareness, rehabilitate essential infrastructure and assist in economic reconstruction and development. Another important goal was the trial of senior Khmer Rouge leaders. The process that was initiated during the UNTAC led on 4 October 2004, to the ratification of an agreement with the United Nations by the Cambodian National Assembly on the establishment of a tribunal to try senior leaders responsible for the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge. Donor countries pledged the $43 million international share of the three-year tribunal budget, while the Cambodian government's share of the budget was $13.3 million. The first trials of senior Khmer Rouge leaders took place only in 2007, when many of them were already dead or in ill-health. =Disarmament= Australian Army Patch - UNTAC Despite UNTAC's boasting of its effectiveness and being feted by the international community as a success, UNTAC failed to disarm the Khmer Rouge, while effectively disarming the SOC's local militias.Daniel Bultmann (2015) 'Inside Cambodian Insurgency. A Sociological Perspective on Civil Wars and Conflict', Ashgate: Burlington, VT/Farnham, UK, . This bias allowed the Khmer Rouge to make territorial gains and gave rise to political violence.Margaret Slocomb, The People's Republic of Kampuchea, 1979-1989: The revolution after Pol Pot The State of Cambodia's military leaders were furious, claiming that UNTAC was extremely exacting with the disarmament of the CPAF, but too lenient and ineffective when it came to disarm the Khmer Rouge.Benny Widyono, Dancing in Shadows: Sihanouk, the Khmer Rouge, and the United Nations in Cambodia, - =1993 elections= Over 4 million Cambodians (about 90% of eligible voters) participated in the May 1993 elections, although the Khmer Rouge or Party of Democratic Kampuchea (PDK), whose forces were never actually disarmed or demobilised, barred some people from participating. Prince Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC Party was the top vote recipient with a 45.5% vote, followed by Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party and the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party, respectively. FUNCINPEC then entered into a coalition with the other parties that had participated in the election. The parties represented in the 120-member assembly proceeded to draft and approve a new constitution, which was promulgated 24 September 1993. It established a multiparty liberal democracy in the framework of a constitutional monarchy, with the former Prince Sihanouk elevated to King. Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen became First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively, in the Royal Cambodian Government (RGC). The constitution provides for a wide range of internationally recognised human rights.

Aryeh Leib HaCohen Heller. The name of the book is Aramaic, and means \\"seven passages\\".The term first appears in Tractate Chullin 42b It consists of seven sections, each with approximately 25 chapters, which explains intricate halakhic topics including the validity of a single witness and the practical ramifications of a doubt. The reasoning process that Heller employs to analyse and resolve these very basic conflicts and contradictions in the Talmud is considered the basis for the analytical method used in modern times in Talmudic study. Although an early form of this work was initially presented by R. Heller when he was still a young man during his seven days of celebration after his wedding, it was actually one of his later publications and underwent significant editing by the author. Contents = Introduction = R. Heller's introduction to this celebrated work explains his outlook on Judaism, and includes complex and profound biblical exegesis. His basic stance is a blend of Kabbalah and Italian Neoplatonism, somewhat similar to that found in Isaiah Horowitz's Shene Luchot ha-Berit and the works of Moshe Chaim Luzzatto. The starting point is a doctrine of the Fall, according to which the effect of Adam's sin was a confusion between soul and body, causing the soul to become dependent on the gratification of the body's desires. The correct relationship is one in which the body is simply an instrument for the soul, and the purpose of religious endeavour is to restore this position. Through analysis of a series of Biblical incidents, he illustrates his contention that there would be no value in an understanding and observance of Torah that was ready-made and which one had no choice but to follow. Rather, just as practical halachah is a code which one strives to follow using one's free will, so the intellectual content of Torah is presented in a cryptic and open- ended form the value of which depends on one's struggle to understand it. Talmudic analysis is accordingly the highest form of religious endeavour, and the purpose of the book is to furnish the tools for this activity. = The Shema'tata = The overall subject of the book is the way in which Jewish law addresses doubts, either as to the facts or as to the applicable law. The Talmud provides a series of presumptions, in favour of strictness or leniency depending on the circumstances. One series of questions concern the way in which these presumptions interact. Another is the more fundamental question of how presumptions work. That is, does a presumption have the effect of assimilating the doubtful cases to the certain cases in all respects, or are doubtful cases a third category with its own special laws, alongside the certainly included and the certainly excluded? Although each section focuses on a specific Halachic principle, invariably other principles are brought up and discussed. These principles involve focal points that have applications throughout the entire Rabbinical corpus. Heller's method is to test each principle against a variety of Talmudic passages. If the concept would cause a difficulty in the passage (e.g. the concept should apply and doesn't), Heller resolves the difficult by demonstrating that for whatever reason this passage doesn't fit underneath the rubric of that particular concept (see Casuistry). In this way the exact boundaries of each principle are clearly defined, thus clarifying the exact applications of each principle.The above details are taken from R. Binyomin Rabinowitz-Teomim, Pesichta di-Shma'tata (a commentary on the Shev Shema'tata). Section One The first section analyses whether the concept of \\"A doubt in a biblical issue is dealt with stringently\\" is actually a biblical concept itself or whether it is entirely of Rabbinic origin. This section continues into a discussion of the principles that, if there is a doubt concerning a case of spiritual impurity, if this occurred in the public domain we rule leniently and in the private domain stringently (Sotah 28b). Finally, the ruling that in a case of Sefek Sefeika - a case of doubt in which one side of the question is itself subject to doubt - we rule leniently is explained. The reason is that since most sides of this question lean to the lenient side, the principle of Rov - that we follow the majority - is called in and we rule leniently. Section Two  The second section analyses the presumption of chazakah. Chazakah is the presumption that in case of doubt one may assume that the physical or legal status of the object (or person) in question remains constant. At this point the focus is on Chezkat Ha'Guf - that the physical status of the object remains unchanged - and Chezkat Mammon - that we assume that an object belongs to its current possessor unless otherwise proven. The relative strengths of these two Chazakot are compared and contrasted. Also the importance of the strength of each parties claim is analysed - in a case where one party is doubtful of his claim then a chazakah may not decide the case.  Section Three  The third section builds on the previous section. The focal passage here is Niddah 2b - this discusses a case in which we were certain about the status of an object (in that passage a ritual bath) on day one and again on day seven but we are unsure about the time in between (days 2-6). The question is whether the certainty on day one is of primary importance in deciding the status of the next few days (Chazakah D' Me'ikara) or the certainty of day seven is more important (Chazaka D' Hashta). Heller points out (based on various Talmudic passages) that if the object is likely to change (in his example a girl who is likely to mature) then the Chazakah D'Hashta takes precedence.  Section Four  Section Four discusses the principle (Bava Batra 23b) that in case of a conflict between the principle that we follow the majority (Rov) and the presumption that if an object is found near a certain place we can assume the object originated in that place (Karov) the law of Rov has decisive power. It further discusses the power of Rov in regards to monetary cases and the power of Rov to take an object away from its present possessor.  Section Five  Section Five involves a disagreement among the Rishonim. This refers to case wherein a person or object is under the influence of a specific type of spiritual impurity or halachic prohibition. The subject then becomes involved with something that leaves it under a doubt of a different type of prohibition or impurity and then becomes cleared of the original impurity. The question is whether the Chazakah of the first impurity holds good to decide his status in reference to the second impurity.  Section Six  This section compares the power of a single witness (that is believed for prohibitions and to require an oath) and the power of Chazakah. The status of two sets of witnesses contradicting each other is also discussed.  Section Seven  Section Seven discusses the Halachic concept that an ordinarily unfit witness (e.g. a child) is believed if in the middle of an ordinary conversation he mentions something in passing. The belief of certain people who state that they recognize a specific object or person without mentioning specific identifying charasteristics is also elaborated. Influence Rabbi Aryeh Leib HaCohen Heller's approach was influential in the nineteenth century Lithuanian school, and Shimon Shkop's work Sha'are Yosher is widely regarded as based on the earlier work. Parallels in other religions Rabbi Aryeh Leib HaCohen Heller's analysis of doubts and presumptions bears a distinct resemblance to the analysis of probability in Shi'a Islamic law, as developed by Muhammad Baqir Behbahani and refined by Shaykh Murtada al-Ansari. In cases where the primary sources cannot yield an unequivocal principled answer, there are still presumptions, sufficient in ordinary life, for deciding on the better view. For example, where there is doubt whether a given situation (such as ritual purity) exists but it has certainly existed in the past, one can rely on a presumption that it is more likely to have continued the same than to have changed (cf. chezkat haguf). In Roman Catholic moral theology, a distinction is recognised between \\"direct principles\\" and \\"reflex principles\\". Reflex principles are presumptions to be applied in cases of doubt, such as the rule that where the moral right to something is unclear one favours the person in possession (cf. chezkat mamon). (See Catholic Probabilism.) Such principles are widely found in Western legal systems.

Career Heaney started out playing on his native Teesside before being signed by London club Arsenal on schoolboy forms in January 1987. He was part of the side that won the FA Youth Cup in 1987‚Äì88 and turned professional in 1989. After spells on loan at Hartlepool United and Cambridge United, he made his Arsenal d√©but as a substitute against Sheffield United on 18 April 1992. A winger with considerable pace, he was on the fringes of the Arsenal first team over the next two seasons, before being suddenly sold by George Graham to Southampton for ¬£300,000 in March 1994. He made nine senior appearances for Arsenal in total, failing to score. He became Alan Ball's third signing for the Saints (just before the transfer deadline) and scored his first goal against Newcastle United on 22 March 1995. Saints had failed to win a game since before Christmas and had dropped into 20th place, just above the relegation zone. Heaney came on as a substitute with Saints 1‚Äì0 down, and with four minutes left he prodded home a loose ball after a save by Pavel Srn√≠ƒçek from Gordon Watson's header. Watson and Neil Shipperley completed the scoring to see Saints run out unlikely 3‚Äì1 winners. Saints then managed to climb up the table to finish in 10th place. According to Holley & Chalk, Heaney \\"had the ability and pace to turn matches, but could frustrate with a tendency to run up blind alleys.\\" Heaney made 61 league appearances for Southampton in two and a half seasons (scoring five goals), before being sold for ¬£500,000 to Frank Clark's Manchester City in November 1996. Heaney had a loan spell with Charlton Athletic in 1997‚Äì98. He was part of the Valiants side that played against Sunderland in the dramatic 1998 Championship play-off final which they won 7‚Äì6 on penalties after a 4‚Äì4 draw to earn promotion to the Premier League. Heaney though only started sixteen matches during his two-and-a-half years with City. He eventually left Maine Road in August 1999, to link up at the Ashton Gate Stadium with Bristol City. Heaney then linked up on a free transfer to Darlington in the summer of 1999 for ¬£30,000. He became a crowd favourite as helped take the club to the 2000 Third Division play-off final. Playing as a left winger he scored five goals for the club altogether. Heaney then joined up with Scottish side Dundee United for ¬£175,000 in July 2000. Being described by club chairman Jim McLean as a \\"bad\\" signing, Heaney went on to make only fourteen appearances for Dundee. On the 4 December, 2001 he moved on to Plymouth Argyle. Heaney eventually retired a year later due to injury. After football After retiring, Heaney left football and became CEO of Judicare, an English firm of Solicitors that deals with international legal issues and is known particularly for recovering monies invested into problematic property abroad, based partly on his own problems investing in Spanish property.

Chita, a city in eastern Siberia, Russia, and a place of exile for early revolutionaries and combatants of the Russo-Japanese War, was a center for worker unrest in the early 1900s. During the Russian Revolution of 1905 armed revolutionaries under the leadership of the RSDLP headed by Viktor Kurnatovsky, Anton Kostiushko-Voliuzhanich, and Ivan Babushkin organized themselves into a \\"Soviet of Soldiers' and Cossacks' Deputies\\" and took control over the city, declaring the Chita Republic in December 1905. Background The Transbaikal region on the eve of the 1905 Russian Revolution was a hotbed for workers' unrest. Although Siberian wages were high (on average, 30% higher than wages in European Russia), there was much inflation in the region. Food prices jumped in the decade before the revolution by 40-50%, but incomes only rose by half that. Poor harvests in 1901 and 1902 led to up to 200% increases in prices for food. On the Trans- Siberian Railroad, the number of new workers coming in could not keep up with the increase in the number of people using the railway. There was little medical care for workers who had to work in the cold, and accidents were common due to the climate and the lack of workers. Thus, left-wing influence grew rapidly in the Transbaikal region. Chita, in particular, was more influenced by the Bolsheviks than by the Mensheviks. By 1904, serious unrest began caused by inflation from the Russo-Japanese War. The RSDLP started agitating against the war in various cities along the Trans-Siberian Railroad, with major strikes starting in January 1905. Revolution in Chita Initially, railway workers in Chita reacted to Bloody Sunday with a one-day walkout. In late January, there was a three-day strike by the railway workers over late wages. In July, agitation by the RSDLP led to a group of 20 craftsmen presenting demands to local authorities. Negotiations devolved into strikes from July 25 and 26. Workshops were closed on the 27th, and on the 28th, workers came up with 33 new demands, including a demand for an eight- hour work day. It is noted that speeches by local Social-Democratic leaders received up to 2,000 listeners from the striking workers. These strikes spread along the Trans-Siberian Railway to cities like Irkutsk, Innokenty, Zima and Verkhneudinsk. In September, Chita Social Democrats convened a congress of Transbaikal activists, with 18 delegates representing railway workers from the region, as well as from shop and depot workers in Chita, and 5 RSDLP representatives. In the wake of the general strike of October 1905, Transbaikal railway telegraph employees voiced their demands, including radical land reform. Later, Chita railway engineers tried to create a national congress of workers based on their local \\"union of engineers\\". Chita organizers built a separate union for shop and depot workers. By December, the Chita Republic encompassed most of the major stations, and in January 3-6, 1906, 2,500 workers were organized under the local union at twelve stations and were represented by 37 representatives.Reichman, Henry. \\"The 1905 Revolution on the Siberian Railroad.\\" The Russian Review 47, no. 1 (1988): 25-48. Accessed July 31, 2020. doi:10.2307/130442. On November 16, 1905, around 4,000 workers rallied under the RSDLP to create a republic fighting against the autocracy of the Russian government. Anton Kostiushko-Voliuzhanich headed the \\"Soviet of Soldiers' and Cossacks' Deputies\\" on 22 November. Railway workers proclaimed an eight-hour workday. To prevent fighting along the railway, the revolutionaries formed the \\"Joint Committee of Railway Workers and Service Personnel\\". A railway congress was called in mid-December in Irkutsk, resolving on revolutionary self-government in Chita (but not for the takeover of the Trans-Siberian Railway). On December 18, a mass rally called for the convening of the Congress of Delegates of Transbaikalia, an organization comprising the Chita Municipal Duma and the representatives from local unions and political parties. On December 21, the congress, chaired by mayor of Chita Sergei Kirillovich Sheshmintev, agreed on self-government for the city of Chita with universal elections. Sanctioned by Governor-General Kholshchelvnikov, the Chita Post and Telegraph Office came under the jurisdiction of an elected committee. The \\"Joint Committee of Railway Workers and Service Personnel\\" extended the Chita Republic's power through much of the surrounding Transbaikal region. Workers under it exercised heavy control over the local railroads. The local military governor-general, I. V. Kholshchelvnikov, complied with the demands of the revolutionaries, and so was not removed. He was later tried through court-martial. The workers and soldiers of Chita who controlled the railroads were so well-armed, the local Siberian units passing through the city did not wish to fight them.WILDMAN, ALLAN K. \\"THE LEGACY OF DEFEAT AND REVOLUTION.\\" In The End of the Russian Imperial Army: The Old Army and the Soldiers' Revolt (March-April, 1917), 41-74.

Suppression The leaders of the republic tried to organize and establish administration in the city and its outskirts, and the new periodical Zabaykalsky Rabochy was issued in Chita on December 7, 1905, but the republic was fated to fail after the suppression of the uprisings in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Troops loyal to the regime, led by Paul von Rennenkampf and general Meller-Zakomelsky, were sent to suppress the rebellious territory; it was quickly subjugated and Chita was occupied by government troops on 22 January 1906. > \\"At the beginning of 1906 Kurnatovsky was again arrested and sentenced to > death. General Rennenkampf, the pacifier of Siberia, carried the condemned > man in his train so that he might witness with his own eyes the executions > of workers at every railway station.\\" The six leaders of the Chita Republic were shot on the slope of Titovsky sopka. Kurnatovsky's death sentence was later commuted to life-long exile to Siberia. Military courts gave death sentences to many others, as well as twenty-six soldiers. In the memory of the leaders of the Chita Republic, several central streets of Chita were named after them (Babushkina street, Kurnatovsky street, etc.).

Life Radclyffe was the son of Edward Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Derwentwater and Lady Mary Tudor, the natural daughter of Charles II by Moll Davis. He was brought up at the exiled court of St Germain as a companion to the young prince, James Francis Edward Stuart (the 'Old Pretender' after his father James II died), and remained there at the wish of Queen Mary of Modena, until his father's death in 1705. He succeeded to the family titles and estates in Northumberland on the death of his father in 1705. After that he travelled on the continent, sailed from Holland for London in November 1709, and then set out to visit his Cumberland estates for the first time early in 1710. He spent the next two years at Dilston Hall, Northumberland, the mansion built by his grandfather on the site of the ancestral home from 1521; the estates were sequestrated after the Civil War due to the recusancy of his grandfather the first Earl. He regained those and began the construction of a grand mansion to replace the old Hall, a task that was never completed. He joined the conspiracy of 1715; he was suspected by the government, and on the eve of the insurrection the secretary of state, Stanhope, signed a warrant for his arrest. A messenger was sent to Durham to secure him, but Radclyffe went into hiding. He heard that Thomas Forster had raised the standard of the Pretender, and Radclyffe joined him at Greenrigg, on 6 October 1715, at the head of a company of gentlemen and armed servants from Dilston Hall. His following, at most 70, was under the immediate command of his brother, Charles Radclyffe. Their plan was to march through Lancashire to Staffordshire, where they looked for support, and the expedition was left mainly in the hands of Colonel Henry Oxburgh, who had served under the Duke of Marlborough in Flanders. When the rebels occupied Preston, Derwentwater encouraged the men to throw up trenches. The Jacobite army was defeated at the Battle of Preston. Radclyffe acquiesced in Forster's decision to capitulate to the inferior force of General Charles Wills. He was escorted with the other prisoners to London by General Henry Lumley, and lodged in the Devereux tower of the Tower of London, along with the Earls of Nithsdale and of Carnwath, and Lords Widdrington, Kenmure, and Nairne. He was examined before the Privy Council on 10 January 1716, and impeached with the other lords on 19 January. Derwentwater pleaded guilty, urging in extenuation his inexperience, and his advice to those who were about him to throw themselves upon the royal clemency. He was attainted, and condemned to death. Efforts were made to procure his pardon. Petitions were brought before both Houses of Parliament, and an address was carried from the upper house to the throne on 22 February, praying that his majesty George I of Great Britain would reprieve 'such of the condemned lords as might appear to him deserving of clemency.' Widdrington, Carnwath, and Nairn were reprieved. The countess, accompanied by her sister, their maternal aunt, Anne Brudenell, Duchess of Richmond, the Duchess of Cleveland, and other ladies, was introduced by the Duke of Richmond into the king's bedchamber, where the countess, in French, asked for his majesty's mercy. The king, however, prompted by Robert Walpole (who declared that he had been offered ¬£60,000 to save Derwentwater, but that he was determined to make an example), was obdurate. Derwentwater was beheaded on Tower Hill on 24 February 1716. On the scaffold he expressed regret at having pleaded guilty, and declared his devotion to his Roman Catholic religion and to James III. Lord Kenmure suffered at the same time. The Earl of Nithsdale escaped from the Tower the day before. Charles Radclyffe escaped to France but was captured in 1745 on his return to support the 1745 uprising and was executed in 1746. Nairne was still in the Tower of London in 1717, so was able to benefit from the Indemnity Act 1717 and was released.Melville Henry Massue, Marquess of Ruvigny & Raineval, The Jacobite Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage, and Grants of Honour (Genealogical Publishing Co., 2003 edition), p. 126 On the day of his beheading the northern lights were said to be unusually brilliant, and have since been known as Lord Derwentwater's Lights.Brewer, E Cobham (1978) The Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, Avenel Books, New York (originally published 1870). Derwentwater was stripped of his honours and titles (but his successors continued to use the titles); and his estates were confiscated. In 1748 Dilston Hall and the rest of the Derwentwater estates were granted by Act of Parliament (Public Act 22 George II chapter 56) to the Royal Hospital, Greenwich. Family Radclyffe married Anna Maria Webb (d. 19 August 1723) on 10 July 1712. She was the eldest daughter of Sir John Webb, 3rd baronet, of Odstock, Wiltshire, by Barbara, daughter and coheiress of John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse. Their only son John Radclyffe, titular 4th Earl of Derwentwater (1713‚Äì1731) succeeded. John is generally accepted to have died at the age of 19 after a cutting for the stone. In the mid 19th century a woman claiming to be his great granddaughter and referring to herself as the Countess of Derwentwater made claim upon the Derwentwater estates, but was eventually discredited. She claimed that John had not died in 1731 but had fled to Germany to avoid an attempt on his life by the Hanoverian government. They also had a daughter, Lady Mary Radclyffe (1714‚Äì31 January 1760), who married Robert James Petre, 8th Baron Petre; they had three daughters and one son Robert Petre, 9th Baron Petre. Lady Derwentwater and her children fled to Brussels in 1721, and she died there of smallpox in 1723.Northumbrian Jacobites Northumbrian Jacobite Society  Ballads  Radclyffe's death is recounted in two English traditional ballads: * \\"Lord Derwentwater\\", collected by Francis James Child and published as Child Ballad 208 in English and Scottish Popular Ballads (1882-98). * \\"Lord Allenwater\\", collected by Ralph Vaughan Williams in 1904 from the singing of Emily Stears.Historical notes compiled by Anderson/Edmonds/Mandelson for the cover of CD \\"Stubble\\" by Blue Blokes 3 In literature Radclyffe figures prominently in the historical novels Dorothy Forster by Walter Besant and Devil Water by Anya Seton.

A 2015 study found it to actually be within the Charadrius clade, with its closest relatives other plovers found in New Zealand, the nearest the New Zealand dotterel or New Zealand plover (Charadrius obscurus), and then the double-banded plover or banded dotterel (Charadrius bicinctus). It lays its eggs among the rocks along rivers and distracts intruders by pretending to be in distress and moving away from its \\"nest\\". It is rated as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Threatened Species. Taxonomy French naturalists Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard described the wrybill in 1830. Description Wrybill female The wrybill is a small, plump plover, measuring in length and weighing between . The plumage is slightly sexually dimorphic. The male has a white forehead and pale grey crown, nape, back, wings and tail and a white throat, breast, belly and rump, with a thin black band across the breast. This band is thinner in the female, and much less distinct in both sexes in the non-breeding season. The other difference between the sexes is a small black bar between the white forehead and the grey crown, which is present in the males but not the females. As with the breast band it is reduced in the non-breeding season. The most distinctive feature of the bird is the long black bill, which is always curved to the right. The wrybill is the only species of bird with an asymmetrically turned bill. The eggs are very pale grey and covered with very small brown spots which blend in very well to the surrounding shingle As well as the eggs being very well camouflaged, the adult birds and chicks are very difficult to see when they are standing still.Heather, B & Robertson, H. (2005). The field guide to the birds of New Zealand. Auckland: Penguin Books (NZ) Ltd Chicks are very pale grey on upper half of body with black speckles and white on lower half of body grey.Complete book of New Zealand birds (1985). Sydney, New South Wales: Reader‚Äôs Digest Services Pty Limited The wrybill's voice has been described as a short weet when in flight and used to signal alarm, and a harsher call is used to signal greater alarm. A chirring sound is used to challenge an aggressor. Fledglings and juveniles have a high-pitched short peep. Wrybills on mud flat, Firth of Thames Distribution and habitat The wrybill is endemic to New Zealand. It breeds on large braided rivers in Canterbury and Otago, South Island, preferring large dynamic rivers that will not become overgrown with weeds. The main breeding rivers include the Waimakariri, Rakaia, Rangitata, Waitaki and Ashley. It used to occur more frequently on smaller rivers, but has undergone a range contraction, and now only occupies around 60% of its estimated original range. After breeding, around late December till early February, they leave their breeding sites and migrate to shallow estuaries and sheltered coastal areas in the North Island. These areas include Firth of Thames, Manukau Harbour, Kaipara Harbour and Tauranga Harbour. Behaviour Wrybills like to roost in large flocks during winter which differs greatly from breeding time when they become very territorial towards other birds. They usually roost on one leg and hop away when approached too close. Wrybills are known to perform large aerial displays with their flocks, this usually happens shortly before the migration south. =Breeding= Wrybill eggs showing camouflage Wrybills have monogamous bonds with their mates and will return to the same territory each year to breed again, if their mate does not return, the bird will move territories. Nesting territories are strongly defended, these can be anywhere between 1 and 11 hectares in size, with an average size of 5 hectares. They show strong philopatry to their territories, and young birds show strong philopatric tendencies towards breeding close to where they were hatched. Many breeding pairs will lay two clutches in a breeding season, especially if the first clutch was destroyed by flooding or predators. Nesting sites are shallow scrapes in areas of large stones or sand. The clutch size is two eggs, which are incubated by both parents (but more so by the female) for 30 to 36 days. The chicks have downy feathers on hatching, grey-to off white above and white underneath. Both parents attend to the chicks, which fledge after around 35 days and are immediately independent after this. Young birds start breeding when they are two years old. = Ecology = Moulting of wrybills happens between December and May, the moulting process advances quickly at the start of the process when the first feathers are dropped. And then slows as the longer outer feathers start to grow. Migration starts in November with the earliest fledged birds, adults follow in January/February when breeding is finished with the rest of the fledglings. Migration back to breeding sites in the South Island happens in August Current population around 5000 individuals and slowing declining  Diet and foraging  Wrybills are usually found foraging around shallow channels and around the edges of pools on insect larvae, aquatic invertebrate and sometimes small fish. They have evolved in a very distinct way to thrive on braided river beds- with their beak tilted on a slight tilt towards the right right angle about 12-26 degrees which is speculated to help them get insect larvae and small invertebrates that take refuge under the crevices of rocks however this has never been officially proven.  Predators and threats  Threats are higher during the breeding season when the birds are at their most vulnerable, threats include predation, flooding during nesting time, habitat degradation and disturbance from vehicles along the river beds. Introduced mammalian predators such as ferrets, stoats, weasels and hedgehogs pose a significant threat to the survival of the remaining population. Wrybills have adapted to bird predators such as raptors, gulls and owls, since mammalian predators have only been a threat since the arrival of people. Their chicks and eggs blend in very well with the surrounding shingle, camouflaging them from the predators flying overhead. With rabbits being the main diet of these mammalian predators, when rabbit numbers are low these predators search further for their food and prey upon the ground nesting birds on the braided rivers. Flooding can destroy nests whole nesting areas if large enough and can effect the number of chicks to reach fledging. As wrybills prefer an open clear area of shingle on the river bed to nest, introduced plant species such as gorse (Ulex europaeus), willow (Salix spp.), broom (Cytisus scoparius) and lupin (Lupinus spp.), all threaten the wrybills habitat as they spread over the landscape easily and quickly.  Conservation status  The wrybill is rated as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Threatened Species, The population declined during the 1800s as they were collected as museum specimens because of their strange bent bill. In 1940 they were protected and the population has increased from around 2000 birds to 5000 birds today.

The water flowing in a spring creek may additionally be fed by snow pack or rain run-off, as in most traditional free-flowing rivers, but often the entire water source for a spring creek is an aquifer or other underground water source. For this reason, spring creeks are often filled with very pure, clean water and also demonstrate water flows that are smooth, consistent, and unwavering throughout the seasons of the year - unlike rivers filled with run-off or spring and summer melt-off from snow pack, whose water flows, water clarity, and water conditions often vary highly over the course of the year. In addition, water temperatures in spring creeks tend to vary less throughout the seasons of the year than traditional creeks and rivers because they are fed by underground water sources. Because of the depths of these water sources, spring creeks often emerge from their source or headwaters very cold and stay that way over the length of their runs. In addition, due to the consistent water flows and the fact that spring creek water is \\"pushed\\" by the force of pressure from the source rather than \\"pulled\\" by the force of gravity downhill, spring creeks can flow through very flat sections of land with minimal depths over grades that might not sustain run-off creeks and rivers. In these low-grade or flat sections of spring creeks, water flows can appear almost laminar with the surface of the creek appearing to be nearly flat and without the prominent riffles and surface disturbances caused by more rough or uneven surface bottoms found below free- stone run-off creeks and rivers surfaces. Due to the characteristics described above, spring creeks are often well known in the context of trout and other freshwater fly fishing as excellent riparian habitats. Trout, particularly sport fish such as brown trout and rainbow trout, often thrive and grow rapidly in spring creeks due not only to the consistent water flows and low temperatures, but also due to the advantageous insect environments they foster. Insects such as mayflies (baetis and callibaetis, among others) and caddis flies find spring creek habitats very appealing and often live, mate, and hatch on these waterways in great numbers throughout the year. Because these insects in pupal and winged form represent the principal diet of freshwater trout, the fish living in spring creeks often have ample food supply throughout the year. This element of spring creek habitats, combined with the advantageous water conditions, can create the ideal conditions for large, healthy, hefty local populations of the kind of trout that fly fisherman pursue. Some examples of spring creeks famous for their fly fishing conditions are the Henrys Fork, in southeastern Idaho, the Silver Creek, in central southern Idaho, and the Metolius River, in central Oregon. In this context, fly fisherman often refer to creeks and rivers as \\"like a spring creek\\" if the water flows and habitat display the characteristics described above.

He served in both China and in the Pacific campaign. After Japanese forces were defeated in the Battle of Saipan, he led a group of soldiers and civilians deep into the jungle to evade capture by Allied forces. Under ≈åba's leadership, the group survived for over a year after the battle and finally surrendered in December 1945, three months after the war had ended. Following his return to Japan, he became a successful businessman and served on the city council of Gamagori, Aichi. Early life Sakae ≈åba was born on 21 March 1914 in the town of Gamagori, Aichi prefecture. He was the first son of Isuke ≈åba, a farmer. In March 1933, ≈åba graduated from the Aichi Prefecture Teacher Training School of Practical Education () and the following month he accepted a faculty position at a public school in the area. While working as a teacher, he married Mineko Hirano (1912‚Äì1992), also of Gamagori. Mineko Oba, ca.1937. Military career In 1934, ≈åba joined the 18th Infantry Regiment of the Imperial Japanese Army, based in the nearby city of Toyohashi.Hata (2005) He was designated a Ground Officer Candidate, First Class, received specialized training, and was sent to Manchukuo, where the bulk of the 18th Regiment was already stationed on occupation duty. In 1936, the regiment returned to its home garrison in Toyohashi, and ≈åba was briefly reunited with his wife. In July 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War erupted, and the 18th Infantry was mobilized. In August, ≈åba and his regiment were deployed to China where they joined the amphibious invasion of Shanghai. By December of that year, ≈åba had been promoted to Second Lieutenant. In 1939, he was promoted to First Lieutenant, and in November 1941 he was given command of an infantry company. In March 1943 he was promoted to captain. =Saipan= Early in 1944, the 18th Regiment was pulled out of Manchuria and re-deployed to the Pacific Theatre. Captain ≈åba was placed in charge of the regiment's company of combat medics. At about 3:00pm, 29 February, the transport ship carrying the regiment, the Sakito Maru, was struck by a torpedo fired by the American submarine USS Trout, near the island of Saipan.Gailey (1988), p.36.Hoyt (1980), p.240.Jones (1986), p.10. The ship sank, taking with it over half the regiment. Escort vessels moved in quickly and rescued about 1,800 survivors and delivered them to Saipan. After hasty reorganization, most of the regiment was successfully transported to Guam.Gailey (1988) Almost 600 troops, including Captain ≈åba, had to be left behind on Saipan. ≈åba was assigned to organize a 225-man medical company composed of tankers, engineers, and medics that survived the Sakito-maru disaster. They obtained what few medical supplies were available and by mid-May had set up a medical aid station.Jones (1986), p.20. On the morning of 15 June 1944, United States Marines landed on the beaches for the Battle of Saipan. Despite a fierce defense, the Japanese were gradually pushed back with heavy losses. The Japanese commander used Mount Tapochau at the center of the island as headquarters and organized defensive lines around the mountain. With no re- supply or relief available, the situation became untenable for the defenders, and a final attack was ordered. On 7 July, Captain ≈åba and his men participated in the largest banzai charge of the war in the Pacific. After 15 hours of intense and unrelenting hand to hand combat, almost 4,300 Japanese soldiers were dead. Allied forces declared the island secured on 9 July 1944. By 30 September 1944, the Japanese Army made an official presumption of death for all personnel of unknown status and they were declared killed in action. That included Captain ≈åba, and he was awarded a \\"posthumous\\" promotion to Major. Captain ≈åba, 1 December 1945. Holdout In reality, Captain ≈åba survived the battle and took command of 46 other soldiers. ≈åba then led over 200 Japanese civilians deeper into the jungles to evade capture. He and his men organized the civilians and placed them in mountain caves and hidden jungle villages. When the soldiers were not assisting the civilians with survival tasks, Captain ≈åba and his men continued their battle against the garrison of U.S. Marines. ≈åba used Mount Tapochau as their primary base; at , the peak offered an unobstructed 360-degree view of the island. From their base camp on the western slope of the mountain, ≈åba and his men occasionally conducted guerrilla-style raids on American positions. Due to the speed and stealth of these operations, and the frustrated attempts to find him, the Marines on Saipan eventually referred to ≈åba as \\"The Fox\\". In September 1944, the Marines began conducting patrols in the island's interior, searching for survivors who were raiding their camp for supplies. These patrols sometimes encountered Japanese soldiers or civilians, and when they were captured, they were interrogated and sent to an appropriate prison camp. It was during these interrogations that the Marines learned of ≈åba's name.Jones (1986), p.2. At the peak of the hunt for ≈åba, the Marine commander devised a plan in which his men would line up across the width of the island, about two meters separating one Marine from the next, and they were to march from the south end of the island to the north. The commander felt that ≈åba and his men would have to fight, surrender, or be driven north and eventually captured. Due to this dragnet, the elderly and infirm civilians volunteered to surrender. Although some of the soldiers wanted to fight, Captain ≈åba asserted that their primary concerns were to protect the civilians and to stay alive to continue the war. As the line of Marines approached the area, most of the remaining soldiers and civilians climbed up to a concealed mountain clearing, while others stood on narrow ledges and clung to the side of the mountain. They maintained their precarious positions for most of the day, as the Marines crossed through the area, ransacking huts and gardens when they found them. In some places, the Japanese on the ledges were less than above the heads of the Marines. The Marines' search proved futile, and eventually led to the chagrined commander's reassignment. Surrender Captain ≈åba and his men held out on the island for 512 days, or about 16 months. On 27 November 1945, former Major General Umahachi Am≈ç, commander of the 9th Independent Mixed Brigade during the Battle of Saipan, was able to draw out some of the Japanese in hiding by singing the anthem of the Japanese infantry branch. Am≈ç was then able to present documents from the defunct Imperial General Headquarters to Captain ≈åba ordering him and his men to surrender themselves to the Americans. On 1 December 1945, three months after the official surrender of Japan, the Japanese soldiers gathered once more on Mt. Tapochau and sang a song of departure to the spirits of the war dead. ≈åba then led his people out of the jungle and they presented themselves to the Marines of the 18th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company. With great formality and commensurate dignity, Captain ≈åba surrendered his sword to Lieutenant Colonel Howard G. Kirgis, and his men surrendered their arms and colors.Jones (1986), p.3. They were the last organized resistance of Japanese forces on Saipan.Jones (1986) Post-war After the Japanese government confirmed that ≈åba was alive on Saipan, his \\"posthumous\\" promotion was rescinded. Following his release from Allied custody, he was repatriated. Once back in Japan, ≈åba was reunited with his wife and met his son for the first time; the child had been born in 1937, just after his father had left for China. ≈åba was hired by the Maruei Department Store Company in 1952, where he was employed as a representative and spokesman for the board of directors until 1992. From 1967 until 1979, ≈åba served on the city council in the town of Gamagori, in Aichi Prefecture. Don Jones, a former U.S. Marine stationed on Saipan and once part of a group ambushed by ≈åba's men, was intrigued by the story of the Japanese holdouts and sought out ≈åba after the war. With ≈åba's cooperation, Jones wrote a book about his experiences on Saipan (detailed below). Jones became a lifelong friend of the ≈åba family, and went so far as to locate the retired LTC Kirgis, to whom ≈åba surrendered in 1945, and asked if he could return the sword that ≈åba had handed over when he surrendered. Kirgis agreed, and Jones took the sword to Japan where he presented it to his grateful friend. The heirloom sword remains in the possession of the ≈åba family. ≈åba Sakae died on 8 June 1992, at the age of 78. His remains were interred in the ≈åba family grave at Kou'un Temple in Gamagori. Literature and film The collaborative effort between ≈åba and Don Jones resulted in a novelized account that was first translated into Japanese and published in 1982.Jones (1982) It became a popular success,Sato (August 23, 2010) and the English version was published in 1986 under the title Oba, The Last Samurai: Saipan 1944‚Äì1945. In May 2010, Sakae ≈åba's second son, Hisamitsu, discovered more than 1,200 pages of letters and postcards written between his parents Sakae and Mineko, most dated between 1937 and 1941, though some are dated as late as 1944.Ando (August 25, 2010) Hisamitsu showed the letters to his cousin, Keiichiro Hirano,According to Sato (2010), Mineko ≈åba's brother's grandson is Keiichiro Hirano. Hisamitsu and Keiichiro are thus first cousins, once removed (See Culbertson, Fredd (1997) Cousin Relationships) a novelist and the 1998 recipient of the prestigious Akutagawa Prize. Hirano was deeply moved by what he read in the wartime correspondence, and helped find a local publisher. They offered the task of publication to Mari Mizutani, of Toyohashi, who has stated that she believes the letters are especially significant for their detailed descriptions of daily life during the war; while both husband and wife wrote of their deep affection for each other, both also wrote about innumerable daily activities, Mineko in Gamagori and ≈åba in China or on occupation duty in Manchuria, prior to being shipped to the Pacific. The letters were reviewed by a panel of local volunteers, most of whom had a professional background in literature, publication, history, or were somehow tied to local affairs. A selection of the letters has been compiled and was published in January 2011 under the title Senka no rabu retah, or Love Letters from the Fires of War.

His second candidacy for the Presidency of the United States, he had previously run for his party's nomination in the 2000 primaries and was considered as a potential running mate for his party's nominee, then-Governor George W. Bush of Texas. After winning a majority of delegates in the Republican primaries of 2008, on August 29, leading up to the convention, McCain selected Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate for Vice President. Five days later, at the 2008 Republican National Convention, McCain was formally selected as the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 2008 presidential election. McCain began the campaign as the apparent frontrunner among Republicans, with a strategy of appearing as the establishment, inevitable candidate; his campaign website featured an Associated Press article describing him as \\"[a] political celebrity\\". He made substantial overtures towards elements of the Republican base that had resisted his 2000 insurgency campaign. However, he soon fell behind in polls and fundraising; by July 2007 his campaign was forced to restructure its size and operations. The tide of Republican sentiment against immigration reform legislation he sponsored also led to the erosion of his lead. Towards the end of 2007, McCain began a resurgence, which was capped by his January 2008 wins in the New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Florida primaries. This made him the front-runner for the Republican nomination. On Super Tuesday, McCain won both the majority of states and delegates in the Republican primaries, giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination. McCain clinched a majority of the delegates and became the presumptive Republican nominee with wins in several more primaries on March 4. The following day, President George W. Bush endorsed McCain at the White House. In the general election, facing Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, McCain was trailing during most of the season, only gaining a lead in national polls for a period after the Palin announcement and the 2008 Republican National Convention. The dominant issue of the campaign became the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Unable to gain traction against Obama in presidential debates, the final stages of the campaign saw McCain criticizing Obama for being a \\"redistributionist\\" and adopting symbols such as Joe the Plumber. On November 4, 2008, McCain lost to Barack Obama in the general election, receiving 173 votes of the electoral college to Obama's 365 and gaining 46 percent of the popular vote to Obama's 53 percent. Had McCain been elected, he would have been the oldest President to take office at age 72, succeeding Ronald Reagan, who did so at age 69, and the first not born in the 50 states, as he was born in the Panama Canal Zone (a U.S. Territory at the time of McCain's birth). McCain would've also been the first president from the state of Arizona, whereas Palin would have been the first female vice president, as well as the first vice president from Alaska and outside the mainland United States. Leading up to the announcement McCain's oft-cited strengths as a potential presidential candidate in 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives and leadership in exposing the Abramoff scandal.Schmidt, Susan; Grimaldi, James. \\"Panel Says Abramoff Laundered Tribal Funds; McCain Cites Possible Fraud by Lobbyist\\", Washington Post (June 23, 2005).Anderson, John. Follow the Money (Simon and Schuster 2007), p. 254. He was well known for his military service (including years as a tortured POW) and competing in the 2000 presidential campaign, in which he won the New Hampshire primary before eventually losing the nomination to George W. Bush. McCain also impressed many Republicans with his strong support for President Bush's re-election campaign in 2004, and his role in the confirmation of many of Bush's judicial nominees. Since 1993, he also has served as chairman of the International Republican Institute, a U.S. government-funded organization involved in supporting political democracy around the world. A Time magazine poll dated January 2007 showed McCain deadlocked with possible Democratic opponent Senator Hillary Clinton at 46%; in the same poll McCain trailed Democratic Senator Barack Obama 41% to 48%. An earlier Time poll indicated that more Americans were familiar with McCain than any of the other frontrunners, including Obama and Republican candidate and former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain attended 346 events and raised more than $10.5 million on behalf of Republican candidates. He also donated nearly $1.5 million to federal, state and county parties. In May 2006, McCain gave the commencement address at Jerry Falwell's Liberty University. During his 2000 presidential bid, McCain had called Falwell an \\"agent of intolerance.\\" With significant coverage during the campaign, McCain said that he would never back down from his earlier statement. His later appearance at Liberty University prompted questions about the McCain‚ÄìFalwell relationship and a possible presidential run in 2008. McCain backtracked and stated that Falwell is no longer as divisive and the two have discussed their shared values. McCain delivered a similar address at The New School commencement in Madison Square Garden. McCain was booed, and several students and professors turned their backs or waved fliers reading \\"McCain does not speak for me.\\" McCain's speech mentioned his unwavering support for the Iraq War and focused on hearing opposing viewpoints, listening to each other, and the relevance of opposition in a democracy. Announcement John McCain officially announcing his 2008 run for President in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, April 25, 2007. McCain informally announced his candidacy on the Wednesday, February 28, 2007, telecast of the Late Show with David Letterman. He then announced his formal candidacy for the presidency of the United States and in turn, his intention to seek the nomination of the Republican Party for the 2008 presidential election, shortly after noon in Prescott Park on the waterfront of Portsmouth, New Hampshire on Wednesday, April 25, 2007. In his announcement, McCain emphasized that \\"America should never undertake a war unless we are prepared to do everything necessary to succeed,\\" and he also stated that, \\"I'm not running for President to be somebody, but to do something; to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things.\\"\\"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery: Senator McCain's Announcement Speech\\" (April 25, 2007). Via 4president.org. Retrieved March 30, 2008. The audience was somewhat listless. He then visited Saint Anselm College and several other spots around Manchester, New Hampshire on a cold rainy day, before starting a planned three-day campaign rally in South Carolina, Iowa, Nevada, and Arizona. Campaign staff and policy team On July 2, 2008, Steve Schmidt was given \\"full operational control\\" of McCain's campaign. Schmidt had managed Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2006 re-election and was a top Dick Cheney aide. Rick Davis had the title of McCain's campaign manager throughout 2008, but his role was reduced when Schmidt was given control. Davis was previously the campaign's chief executive, and had become campaign manager when John Weaver, McCain's chief aide, and Terry Nelson, his previous campaign manager, resigned on July 11, 2007.\\"Top Aides Leave McCain Camp\\" Dan Balz and Anne E. Kornblut, The Washington Post, July 11, 2007. Davis was also campaign manager during McCain's 2000 presidential campaign, when Weaver had been McCain's chief campaign strategist.\\"The McCain Makeover\\" Glenn Frankel, The Washington Post, August 27, 2006. In 2005 and 2006, U.S. intelligence warned McCain's Senate staff about the Senator's involvement with Davis, who was then a lobbyist in business with Paul Manafort, but U.S. intelligence gave no further warnings about Davis's Russian connections when Davis was McCain's national campaign manager from July 2007 to November 2008.Birnbaum, Jeffrey and Solomon, John. ‚ÄúAide Helped Controversial Russian Meet McCain‚Äù, Washington Post (January 25, 2008).Carter, Sara. ‚ÄúGrassley gets backlash from McCain camp after asking FBI if Trump's campaign was warned about Russia‚Äù, Circa News (September 22, 2017).King, John and Raju, Manu. ‚ÄúGrassley asks FBI if it warned Trump about Manafort‚Äù, CNN (September 22, 2017). Other top staffers included McCain's former chief of staff Mark Salter and long-time political strategist Charlie Black who worked for Reagan, both Bushes and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. Former Bush advisor Mark McKinnon also worked for the campaign before leaving in May 2008 to avoid working against Barack Obama.\\"McCain's Inner Circle - Revisited\\" Chris Cillizza, The Washington Post, February 14, 2008. Jill Hazelbaker was the campaign's chief spokeswoman.\\"McCain's 'nucleus' revived campaign\\" Joseph Curl, The Washington Times, April 12, 2008. McCain's press secretary was Melissa Shuffield. Neoconservative pundit Bill Kristol served as a foreign policy advisor. Randy Scheunemann, a board member of the Project for the New American Century, was hired in January 2007 as McCain's foreign-policy aide. He was the top advisor for security and international issues. Douglas Holtz-Eakin was a senior policy adviser, Nicolas Muzin was medical advisor and Nicolle Wallace was senior adviser on message.Ken Herman, \\"Who's on McCain's team\\" The Austin American-Statesman, June 29, 2008.JTA Canadian-born Orthodox Jew Nick Muzin helps boost black GOP Sen.

Political positions Campaign developments 2007 =Initial stages= Senator John McCain interviewed at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, prior to the ribbon cutting ceremony of The Center for the Intrepid, a $50 million physical rehabilitation facility designed for servicemembers wounded in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. January 29, 2007. By a few weeks prior to making his announcement on Letterman, McCain was already beginning to trail behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in the polls, a situation attributed to his steadfast support for the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. In March 2007, with considerable press attention and in hopes of reigniting his efforts, McCain brought back the \\"Straight Talk Express\\" campaign bus that he had used to much positive effect in his outsider run in 2000. Like many candidates, McCain took to the internet in order to help boost his campaign; appealing to younger audiences by creating Facebook and MySpace pages, along with an account on YouTube. =Claims about Iraq safety= McCain supported the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 proposed by President George W. Bush. On March 28, 2007, McCain said that, \\"General Petraeus goes out [in Baghdad] almost every day in an unarmed humvee\\". On March 29, CNN's John Roberts reported, \\"I checked with General Petraeus's people overnight and they said he never goes out in anything less than an up-armored humvee.\\" On the same day, McCain also said that, \\"There are neighborhoods in Baghdad where you and I could walk through those neighborhoods, today... The US is beginning to succeed in Iraq.\\" On the same day, retired U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey issued a report saying, \\"... no Iraqi government official, coalition soldier, diplomat, reporter could walk the streets of Baghdad without heavily armed protection\\". On April 1, 2007, McCain and other lawmakers visited a Baghdad market and claimed that \\"things are better and there are encouraging signs\\". The visit was accompanied by enormous security measures, as McCain himself wore a bullet-proof vest, and was surrounded by more than 100 troops and escorted by attack helicopters. The day after McCain's visit, 21 workers and children from the market were killed in a suicide bombing. =Missed votes in Senate= In May 2007, it was reported that McCain had missed 42 consecutive votes (five straight weeks) in the Senate while he was conducting his presidential campaign. From March to May, McCain only attended three-floor votes in the Senate, though none of McCain's missed votes altered a bill's fate. According to Washington Post statistics, McCain missed more votes than any Senator including Tim Johnson, who missed many votes after suffering a brain hemorrhage in December 2006. As of August 2008, McCain had missed 63.8% of votes in the 110th Congress during his campaign. Because of their majority status, Senate Democrats could sometimes delay votes in order to accommodate the schedules of Democratic presidential candidates.Merten, Andy.\\"McCain Misses Most Votes of Candiddates?\\" , First Read, MSNBC (April 23, 2008). Retrieved August 19, 2008. =Immigration bill= As early as 2005, McCain conducted bipartisan efforts with fellow Senator Ted Kennedy to create a bill‚Äîthe Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act‚Äîthat would have changed America's immigration policy and provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country. Later McCain championed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007. In an interview in June 2007, potential candidate Fred Thompson criticized Reagan's immigration policy of 1986, saying: \\"Twelve million illegal immigrants later, we are now living in a nation that is beset by people who are suicidal maniacs and want to kill countless innocent men, women and children around the world. We're sitting here now with essentially open borders.\\" McCain responded, \\"I travel around the country extensively and that's certainly not the impression I have. I have not detected a nation full of suicidal maniacs.\\" A Thompson spokesman said he was not calling immigrants \\"suicidal maniacs\\" but rather saying that terrorists could infiltrate the borders. =Iowa Straw Poll= In June 2007, McCain drew some criticism for dropping out of the August Iowa Straw Poll.\\"McCain, Giuliani skip Iowa straw poll.\\" The Des Moines Register, June 7, 2007. Some Republican officials felt the move could be seen as \\"dissing Iowa.\\" In response, a man in a chicken suit, known as the Iowa Chicken, began demonstrating at McCain's appearances in Iowa and carrying a sign reading \\"you balked at the straw poll.\\"\\"Chickens, bunnies, felons and other candidate stalkers \\". Scripps News, June 2007. Despite this, McCain maintained that he was still planning on competing in the Iowa Caucus.\\"McCain defends decision to skip Iowa straw poll \\". Associated Press, June 11, 2007. Some political observers have opined that the Straw Poll results are bought by campaigns. However, polls taken in June showed that McCain's Iowa support had dropped to the single digits, from the mid-20s to 6%.\\"McCain not worried about latest poll numbers\\". CNN, June 21, 2007. =Campaign downsizing and restructuring= McCain's second quarter 2007 fundraising results and campaign financials were poor. Both McCain supporters and political observers pointed to McCain's support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, very unpopular among the Republican base electorate, as a primary cause of his fundraising problems.\\"McCain lags in fundraising, cuts staff\\", cnn.com, July 2, 2007. Retrieved July 6, 2007.\\"Lagging in Fundraising, McCain Reorganizes Staff\\", NPR, July 2, 2007. Retrieved July 6, 2007. Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, with 50 to 100 staffers let go and others taking pay cuts or switching to no pay. McCain's aides said the campaign was considering taking public matching funds, and would focus its efforts on the early primary and caucus states. McCain however said he was not considering dropping out of the race. Fellow Senator, but Immigration Reform Act opponent, Tom Coburn, wrote a piece for National Review praising McCain for showing great political courage in sticking behind the Act even though it was damaging his presidential hopes. Campaign shakeups reached the top level on July 10, 2007, when campaign manager Terry Nelson and campaign chief strategist John Weaver both departed. Another senior aide and co-author of McCain's books, Mark Salter, reduced his role in the campaign as well (he would later return to a full role). McCain's co-chair for his Florida campaign, State Rep Bob Allen, was arrested on July 11, 2007, on charges of sexual solicitation (prostitution). In addition, on July 16, 2007, nine members of McCain's staff, including Brian Jones, McCain's communications director, and two deputies, Matt David and Danny Diaz, announced their resignations.[https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6783011,00.html McCain Loses More StaffWorld LatestGuardian Unlimited =\\"Living off the Land\\"= Following the upheaval, the new McCain campaign put out a plan for how to continue on. Entitled \\"Living Off the Land: A Plan for Financial Viability\\", it called for expenses to be greatly cut and for McCain to take advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events. McCain would focus on the early caucus and primary states, instead of trying to run a nationally-scoped effort, would try to \\"win debates and outperform other candidates,\\" and thereby regain momentum and recapture the faith of potential donors. McCain's strategy was hampered by several other events within the Republicans dominating the political discussion in the ensuing months: Fred Thompson's entry into the race in early September; the focus in debates over battles between Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney; and the discussion over the impact of Romney's religion. Mike Huckabee's sudden surge from the second tier into near-frontrunner status dominated much of the news in November and December 2007. Nevertheless, McCain persevered, riding his \\"Straight Talk Express\\" bus through New Hampshire and, as in the past, granting reporters and bloggers far more direct access than would other campaigns. =December 2007: Comeback= John McCain campaigning in Merrimack, New Hampshire on December 29, 2007. \\"Mac is back!\\" became a familiar chant in his appearances once his campaign fortunes improved. In the final months before the caucuses and primaries began, McCain had still not nearly reclaimed his previous front- runner status. However, the Republican race was quite unsettled, with none of the top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities. Huckabee's ascendence was damaging to Romney, as they traded shots during the days leading up to the Iowa caucuses. Romney and Huckabee put much of their early efforts into Iowa, making the caucus particularly crucial for each of them.Romney, Huckabee sharpen barbs, LA Times, Dec. 22, 2007. Giuliani's campaign was suffering from conflicts regarding strategy, damaging revelations about his personal life and the federal indictment of longtime ally and friend Bernard Kerik.Andrew Nagourney, Giuliani Hits a Rocky Stretch as Voting Nears New York Times, Dec. 24, 2007.Giuliani Campaign Hitting Potholes , The Gothamist, Dec. 15, 2007. Thompson's campaign had not gained momentum after his late entry to the race and had been described as \\"lackluster\\". Through November, McCain had put little effort into Iowa, instead focusing on New Hampshire, where he had staged a big win in his 2000 campaign. By mid-December McCain had climbed back to second place in some New Hampshire polls, and also hoped to benefit from independents, who are able to vote in the New Hampshire Republican primary. Political observers also saw McCain as the \\"second choice\\" of many voters, one who could benefit from the troubles of Romney and Giuliani in particular. McCain's candidacy in New Hampshire was bolstered by a December 2 endorsement from the often-influential New Hampshire Union Leader.John McCain is the man to lead America Manchester Union Leader, Dec. 2, 2007 This was followed by an endorsement from The Boston Globe, which is circulated within New Hampshire, on December 15.For Republicans: John McCain Boston Globe, Dec. 16, 2007. He was endorsed by the smaller Portsmouth Herald on December 16, and by the Boston Herald on December 20. The Boston Herald endorsement prompted McCain to state in an ad that \\"Romney's hometown newspaper says the choice is clear: John McCain\\". These coincided with an unusual national candidate-level, cross-party endorsement of McCain by 2000 Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Lieberman on December 16; the McCain camp hoped that this would help him appeal to independent voters in New Hampshire. McCain also won the endorsement of the influential Des Moines Register in Iowa,Republican endorsement editorial: Why McCain Des Moines Register, Dec. 15, 2007. which surprised even McCain because he had not focused many resources on the state, and because of his opposition to federal subsidies for ethanol‚Äîa favorite issue of Iowan farmers. By a few days before Christmas, there were multiple press reports of a \\"McCain surge\\", with poll numbers improving both in early states‚Äîincluding Iowa‚Äîand nationwide.John McCain Back In Contention In Early States Investors Business Daily, Dec. 21, 2007. The New Hampshire resurgence was further confirmed by Romney now changing the focus of his criticisms from Giuliani to McCain. By the time the Concord Monitor endorsed him on December 29, over twenty New Hampshire papers, large and small, had given him their nods. Some political analysts cautioned that even if the McCain campaign staged some surprise early showings or victories, it was still short on the money and ground organization necessary to exploit a breakthrough. Conservative columnist Robert Novak, though, predicted on December 27 that if McCain could win New Hampshire, he would be the favorite to \\"sweep through subsequent primaries despite meager finances and organization\\". Novak also stated that McCain was seen by Republican insiders as the \\"best bet\\" to win the nomination and the candidate most likely to defeat a Democrat in the November general election.Robert Novak, McCain could be last man standing Chicago Sun Times, Dec. 27, 2007.

Despite McCain's resurgence, his campaign was still strapped for funds: top-level staff was working without paychecks, commercials were being prepared at cost, and event mailers were only a quarter of what he was able to send out in his 2000 campaign. A strong performance in the ABC, Facebook Debates at Saint Anselm College, combined with months of hard work from his dedicated staff resulted in McCain winning the New Hampshire primary, gaining about 37 percent of the vote to Mitt Romney's 32 percent. Amid chants of \\"Mac is back!\\", McCain made his victory remarks. \\"When the pundits declared us finished, I told them, 'I'm going to New Hampshire where the voters don't let you make their decisions for them...

McCain's campaign garnered about $1 million in newly contributed funds immediately after the New Hampshire win, but still had $3.5 million in bank debt. He was not alone in feeling a financial pinch; the entire Republican field suffered from a lack of enthusiasm and lower donations than the Democratic candidates were receiving. Nevertheless, some polls showed McCain getting a significant national bounce from his New Hampshire win; the January 11 CNN nationwide poll had him leading with 34 percent support, a 21-point increase from where he had been just a month before. As the Michigan race entered its final days, McCain gained some notoriety by sending out mailers there and in South Carolina attacking Romney's tax record and touting his own. A Romney campaign spokesman called the ad \\"as sloppy as it is factually incorrect\\", and FactCheck.org called the piece \\"misleading\\". McCain responded by saying, \\"It's not negative campaigning. I think it's what his record is.\\" \\"It's a tough business,\\" he added.Today on the Presidential Campaign Trail Associated Press, Jan. 14, 2008 McCain on that new mailer v.

Michigan had by far the nation's largest unemployment rate, at 7.4 percent, and was continuing to lose jobs from its historical manufacturing base. McCain offered a bit of his \\"straight talk\\" strategy, saying that \\"There are some jobs that aren't coming back to Michigan,\\" and proposing federal job training plans and other remedies to compensate. Romney seized on McCain's statement as overly pessimistic and promoted instead his family heritage‚Äî\\"[I've] got the automobile industry in my blood veins\\"‚Äîas well as his being a Washington outsider who would go there and \\"turn Washington inside out.\\" In the end, McCain finished second in the primary behind Romney, gaining 30 percent of the vote to Romney's 39 percent.Romney claims victory in Michigan CNN.com, Jan. 15, 2008. =South Carolina and Nevada= The campaign then moved towards the January 19 South Carolina primary, the state which effectively ended McCain's 2000 campaign for President. Unlike 2000, McCain had the support of much of the state Republican establishment, both in terms of endorsements and campaign staff support. Nevertheless a bit of 2000 surfaced when a group of unknown size called \\"Vietnam Veterans Against John McCain\\" set up a website and began sending crude mailers to media members alleging that McCain passed military information to the North Vietnamese during his time as a POW. McCain set up a Truth Squad to combat such attacks and emphasized that he was supported by 75 former POWs. Orson Swindle, who was a POW with McCain, called the flier a \\"vicious\\" fraud. \\"Nothing could be further from the truth,\\" Swindle said. \\"I know because I was there. The truth is, the North Vietnamese offered John McCain early release, and he refused.\\"Elisabeth Bumiller, McCain Parries a Reprise of '00 Smear Tactics NY Times, Jan. 16, 2008. After that, however, there was little in the way of dirty tricks during the rest of the campaign. McCain won the South Carolina primary on January 19, gaining 33% of the vote compared to second-place finisher Mike Huckabee's 30%, winning groups he usually did well with, such as veterans and seniors, and doing well enough with other groups, such as evangelicals.

Indeed, The New York Times described McCain's win as \\"exorcising the ghosts of the attack-filled primary here that derailed his presidential hopes eight years ago.\\" Pundits credited third-place finisher Fred Thompson with drawing votes from Huckabee in South Carolina, thereby giving a narrow victory to McCain.\\"Thompson Quits US Presidential Race\\", Reuters (January 22, 2008).. Retrieved June 2, 2008. There had been a steady barrage of apocalyptic statements and predictions in the days before the South Carolina vote from movement conservative icons: Rush Limbaugh said that if Huckabee or McCain won the nomination, it would \\"destroy the Republican Party... be the end of it,\\" while Tom DeLay said \\"McCain has done more to hurt the Republican Party than any elected official I know of.\\" Other talk radio hosts also subjected McCain to criticism for being insufficiently conservative. Prominent conservative radio host Michael Medved said after McCain's win that talk radio was the \\"big loser\\" of the primary, adding that the medium has \\"unmistakably collapsed in terms of impact, influence and credibility because of its hysterical and one- dimensional involvement in the GOP nomination fight.\\" The Nevada caucus the same day drew less attention from Republican candidates, although the state had 31 delegates at stake compared to South Carolina's 24.Court Case Could Alter Nev.

Associated Press, Jan. 16, 2008 McCain did not seriously compete in Nevada, and finished third with 13% of the vote, finishing behind both Romney and Ron Paul. =Florida= The race then moved to the January 29 Florida primary. This would be a test for McCain among core Republican voters, as unlike New Hampshire and South Carolina, independents and Democrats would not be able to vote in the Republican primary. McCain, Giuliani and Romney were closely matched in pre-election polls, and the contest was seen as important to each campaign, as it was the last primary before Super Tuesday, when 41% of the total delegates were up for grabs. It was also the first time that Rudy Giuliani would seriously compete for delegates since a partial effort in New Hampshire, and the first primary after Fred Thompson withdrew his candidacy.Jackie Calmes, In Close Race, Every Delegate Is Prized Wall Street Journal, Jan. 22, 2008.Thompson departs race as rivals saturate Florida Chicago Tribune, Jan. 23, 2008. A January 24 debate at Florida Atlantic University was sedate, with none of the candidates attacking each other and economics the predominant theme. By the next day, however, McCain and Romney were going at each other, with McCain accusing Romney of having once advocated timetables for withdrawal from Iraq, and Romney saying that was untrue‚Äîan assessment shared by news organizations, which labeled McCain's charge as misleading‚Äîand demanding an apology. Certain statements dogged McCain. NBC News' Tim Russert during a debate raised a McCain quote in which McCain said, \\"I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues. I still need to be educated.\\"McCainonomics: \\"Ask Any Of The Voters ‚Äì It's The Economy\\" Romney seized on these and declared that he, not McCain, was the right choice to lead the country during times of economic uncertainty. On the day before the vote, McCain slammed Romney for flip-flopping, while Romney released a \\"top ten list\\" of times McCain had attacked fellow Republicans. Both candidates used the ultimate Republican insult, calling each other a liberal. Overall, McCain was outspent by Romney on Florida television ads by a 3-to-1 margin. Conservative talk radio continued to hammer McCain, with Laura Ingraham saying she was \\"concerned about the mental stability of the McCain campaign\\" and Mark Levin continuing his practice of calling him \\"John McLame\\". As the election neared, Giuliani slumped to a battle for third place with Huckabee, while McCain and Romney each had polls showing them in the lead. McCain garnered the late endorsements of Florida Senator and former Chairman of the Republican National Committee Mel Martinez and the highly popular Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist; Crist had reportedly pledged his support to Giuliani, and the Giuliani campaign was described as \\"visibly upset\\" by the McCain endorsement. On January 29, 2008, McCain won the Florida primary and the state's 57 delegates, taking 36% of the total vote. Romney was second with 31% and Giuliani was third at 15%.McCain wins Florida, CNN projects CNN.com, Jan. 29, 2008. =Super Tuesday= After Florida, the campaigns focused their attention on the 21 states voting on February 5, known as Super Tuesday. McCain was seen as the front-runner for the nomination heading in to this most important of primary dates. He had the lead in delegates to the national convention, and on January 30 he was officially endorsed by the withdrawing Giuliani.McCain gains Schwarzenegger endorsement Jan. 31, 2008. The candidates sparred at a debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, on January 30, with former First Lady Nancy Reagan present in the front row.

Meanwhile, Romney, still burning about McCain's misleading Iraq withdrawal timetable charge, compared McCain to disgraced former President Richard Nixon, saying that McCain's claim was \\"reminiscent of the Nixon era\\" and that \\"I don't think I want to see our party go back to that kind of campaigning.\\" McCain won his home state of Arizona, taking all 53 of the state's delegates, and won too the largest of the Super Tuesday prizes, garnering nearly all of California's 173 delegates. McCain also scored wins in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Oklahoma.February 5: Super Tuesday CNN.com. =Romney ends campaign= Both McCain and Romney addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, D.C., on February 7. Romney used his speech to announce the end of his campaign, solidifying McCain's status as the likely Republican nominee. McCain spoke about an hour later, again appealing to conservative uncertainty about his ideology.

Huckabee won an easy victory in Kansas, claiming all 36 of the state's delegates to the national convention. Only 14,016 votes were cast, and the McCain campaign expressed no concern over the lightly attended caucus. However, social conservatives had a strong presence in the Kansas Republican party, and the results served to highlight conservative dissatisfaction with the Senator.Kansas Republican Delegation 2008, TheGreenPapers.com.Kansas highlights McCain's difficulty with conservatives USAToday.com, Feb. 9, 2008.For McCain, Losses Signal Challenges NY Times, Feb. 11, 2008.

On February 19, McCain continued his winning ways, picking up wins over Huckabee in the Wisconsin primary and the Washington state primary. McCain and Barack Obama engaged in a pointed exchange over Al-Qaeda in Iraq on February 27. =New York Times article on lobbyist= On February 20, 2008, The New York Times broke a story involving an alleged romantic affair eight years earlier between McCain and lobbyist Vicki Iseman, both of whom deny the allegations. The relationship allegedly existed during McCain's 2000 presidential campaign. In separate interviews with The New York Times, two unnamed former associates of McCain said they \\"became convinced\\" that a romantic relationship existed and warned him that he was risking his campaign and his political career. Both said McCain acknowledged behaving inappropriately and that he pledged to keep his distance from Iseman. The associates said they had become disillusioned with the senator, spoke independently of each other and provided details that were corroborated by others. A McCain spokesperson characterized the story as a \\"hit and run smear campaign\\" and \\"gutter politics\\" and went on to say, \\"It is a shame that the New York Times has lowered its standards [...]\\" Iseman's employer, Lowell Paxson, disputed McCain's assertion that he had never met with Paxson over a Federal Communications Commission matter mentioned in the original New York Times article. The article received widespread criticism among both liberals and conservatives, McCain supporters and non-supporters as well as talk radio personalities.Rush, right rally to McCain Politico.com, Feb. 21, 2008. Former staffer to President Bill Clinton and current Hillary Clinton supporter Lanny Davis said the article \\"had no merit.\\" Stating that he did not support McCain's bid for the White House, Davis, who had himself lobbied for the same cause Iseman lobbied McCain for, said that McCain only wrote a letter to the FCC to ask them to \\"act soon\\" and refused to write a letter that supported the sale of the television station the article talked about. In December 2008, Iseman filed a $27 million defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, alleging that the paper falsely communicated an illicit romantic relationship between her and McCain. In February 2009, the lawsuit was settled and no money exchanged hands. From the Times coverage of the settlement: \\"On Thursday, the two sides released a joint statement saying: 'To resolve the lawsuit, Ms. Iseman has accepted The Times's explanation, which will appear in a Note to Readers to be published in the newspaper on Feb. 20, that the article did not state, and The Times did not intend to conclude, that Ms. Iseman had engaged in a romantic affair with Senator McCain or an unethical relationship on behalf of her clients in breach of the public trust.' (and) \\"a statement from Ms. Iseman's lawyers. They wrote, in part: 'Had this case proceeded to trial, the judicial determination of whether she is entitled to the protections afforded a private citizen would have been the subject of a ferocious, pivotal battle, with Ms. Iseman insisting on her status as a private person and The New York Times asserting that she had entered the public arena, and was therefore fair game.'\\"\\"Libel Suit Against The Times Ends\\" by Richard P√©rez-Pe√±a, The New York Times, Feb. 19, 2009.

That night, Mike Huckabee withdrew from the race and endorsed McCain. =Delegate counts= General election campaign 2008 President George W. Bush endorsing Senator McCain at the White House March 5, 2008, following McCain's March 4 primary victory. =Main issues= The McCain campaign focused on many issues. These issues included national security, education reform, energy independence, and tax cuts to stimulate the economy. =Eligibility= Article Two of the Constitution sets one of the principal qualifications to be eligible for election of the office of President as being a natural born citizen of the United States. Although McCain was not born within a state of the United States, his status as a natural-born citizen (and future eligibility to be elected to the presidency) may have been assured at birth by either jus sanguinis, since his parents were U.S. citizens, or jus soli, as the Panama Canal Zone was at that time (1936) a United States possession (1903‚Äì1979), or both. However, Internet talk questioned whether McCain, who was born at Coco Solo Naval Air StationTimberg, American Odyssey, 17‚Äì34. in Panama, qualified as a natural-born citizen. A bipartisan legal review by Laurence Tribe and Theodore Olson, as well as a unanimous but nonbinding Senate resolution, indicate that McCain does indeed fulfill the requirement.Dobbs, Michael. \\"McCain's Birth Abroad Stirs Legal Debate\\", The Washington Post (May 2, 2008)..

However, University of Arizona constitutional law professor Gabriel J. Chin argues both that the Tribe-Olson opinion is unsound under current law and that McCain was actually granted citizenship by a law which was passed eleven months after McCain's birth, disqualifying him under the Constitution from natural-born citizenship and the Presidency.Gabriel J.

Commenting on the Chin paper, Temple University law and citizenship expert Peter Spiro said, \\"No court will get close to it, and everyone else is on board, so there's a constitutional consensus, the merits of arguments such as this one aside.\\" Catholic University law professor Sarah Duggan agreed that no legal challenge would prevail, but said only a constitutional amendment could fully resolve the question. During the general election phase of the campaign, a lawsuit by an American Independent Party member challenging McCain's eligibility was dismissed by a federal judge in San Francisco in September 2008 due both to lack of evidence and lack of standing; U.S. District Court Judge William Haskell Alsup also issued an order stating that it was \\"highly probable\\" that McCain was a natural born citizen.Baxter, Brian. \\"Gibson Dunn Associates Fight for McCain in Suits Over Citizenship\\", The American Lawyer (September 19, 2008). The McCain campaign also looked into lawsuits claiming that Barack Obama was not a natural-born citizen, but saw no evidence or chance of success behind them. =Bush endorsement= On March 5, 2008, President Bush welcomed McCain to the White House and officially endorsed the man who would be his party's standard-bearer in November. The endorsement was seen as helping McCain rally conservatives, and brought with it the promise of much-needed fundraising help heading in to the general election. Democrats painted a different picture, hoping to capitalize on Bush's low approval ratings. The Democratic National Committee said that McCain would offer a \\"third term of George W. Bush\\".Bush endorses McCain for presidency Bloomberg.com, March 5, 2008. =Establishing himself= McCain turned his attention to the November general election, while the Democratic primaries continued to be a battle between Clinton and Obama. McCain faced the challenge of staying in the news as the Democrats garnered headlines with their protracted nomination battle, which showed no signs of ending before the Democratic National Convention in late August. However, having the nomination locked up early also gave McCain time to build a national organization and put his general election strategy into action for the six months leading up to the Republican National Convention. McCain planned to raise money and visit several sites in the U.S. before embarking on a tour of Europe and the Middle East as part of a congressional delegation. McCain did not immediately indicate when he would make his choice for Vice President.Edwin Chen and Hans Nichols, McCain Fights to Keep Place in Presidential Campaign Spotlight , Bloomberg.com, March 6, 2008.

McCain began his overseas trip on March 16, arriving in Baghdad to meet with U.S. military officials as well as Iraqi political leaders.

Reagan released a statement, reading, \\"John McCain has been a good friend for over thirty years. My husband and I first came to know him as a returning Vietnam War POW, and were impressed by the courage he had shown through his terrible ordeal. I believe John's record and experience have prepared him well to be our next president.\\" Standing with Reagan, McCain said, \\"This is an important, most important kind of expression of confidence in my ability to lead the party that I could have.\\" McCain's friendship with Nancy Reagan had survived a period of coldness following his divorce from his first wife Carol, whom the Reagans were quite fond of. pp. 85‚Äì86. =Reiterating and elaborating positions= On March 26, McCain gave his first major speech on foreign policy since securing the nomination. While McCain warned that national security could not be achieved through \\"passive\\" measures, he sounded a conciliatory tone in regards to foreign policy in general. Speaking to the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles, he stressed the need for more cooperation with allies, called for nuclear disarmament and said that he \\"detest[s]\\" war. He stated that America's power \\"does not mean we can do whatever we want, whenever we want.\\"McCain stresses cooperation in L.A. Chicago Tribune, March 27, 2008. On March 31, McCain began a \\"biographical tour\\", visiting several places that were key to his early life and military career.

Despite the earlier opposition from conservatives, in April 2008, there were signs that the Republican Party base was coalescing behind McCain's candidacy. A CBS News/New York Times poll showed that McCain was viewed favorably by 78 percent of conservatives, and unfavorably by only 18 percent. This was the same percentage who had an unfavorable opinion of George W. Bush at the same time in 2000.McCain overcomes rank-and-file concerns Politico.com, April 20, 2008.

During a May 15 speech in Columbus, Ohio, McCain laid out his vision for January 2013, which would be the end of his first term had he won the presidency.

In May 2008, the campaign issued new rules regarding possible lobbying or other conflict-of-interest entanglements, which required campaign workers to either cut ties to lobbying groups or outside political groups that did political advertising, or leave the campaign. The rules also looked forward, and stated that \\"anyone serving in a McCain administration must commit not to lobby the administration during his presidency.\\" After the new rules were issued, two campaign staffers, regional campaign manager Doug Davenport and Republican National Convention chief Doug Goodyear, both of whom had represented the Burmese military government, departed. So too did Eric Burgeson, who had lobbied the U.S. government on energy issues. Republican political consultant Craig Shirley left the campaign due to ties with anti- Hillary Clinton group Stop Her Now. National finance co-chair Tom Loeffler left the campaign due to his lobbying group's work for Saudi Arabia and other foreign countries. Other top campaign staff such as campaign manager Rick Davis (who devised the new rules), strategist Charles Black, and foreign policy advisor Randy Scheunemann, had already stopped such activities and remained with the campaign. McCain was criticized by Campaign Money Watch and MoveOn.org for retaining Black, but Public Citizen came to McCain's defense, saying that \\"Regardless of how many lobbyists are working on his campaign or raising money for him, John McCain has fought for 14 long, hard years for reforms that seriously limit lobbyists' power.\\" Some other lobbyists and academics said that despite highly publicized abuses, lobbyists were an important part of the governmental process, and that the campaign-time criticisms and reactions were grandstanding. Meanwhile, outside Republicans feared the lobbying rules activities were hampering the McCain campaign, which was lagging in organizational and fundraising progress. As of May 19, 2008, McCain had at least 134 lobbyists involved with his campaign, either directly or as fundraisers.\\"McCain Has Had At Least 134 Lobbyists Running His Campaign & Raising Money For Him\\" , Progressive Media USA Research, May 19, 2008. =Barack Obama the presumptive Democratic nominee= Barack Obama became the Democratic presumptive nominee on June 3. McCain immediately proposed a series of ten joint town hall meetings with him, at which the two could engage each other, beginning the next week. Obama first agreed in principle to the notion, but later rejected McCain's proposal, offering instead one town-hall event on the Independence Day holiday and four traditional debate-style joint appearances. McCain, in turn, rejected that proposal saying that Americans would pay less attention to the town-hall appearance due to the holiday. He was quoted as having said, \\"I want the American people to have the exposure to a number of town hall meetings, not just one.\\" Following the exchange, former first lady Nancy Reagan as well as Luci Baines Johnson and Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, daughters of former President Lyndon B. Johnson, invited both McCain and Obama to town-hall appearances at the Reagan and Johnson presidential libraries. McCain accepted the invitation, though the candidates never reached agreement on the event formats.\\"McCain & Obama Invited to Town Halls at Reagan and Johnson Libraries,\\" ABC News, June 12, 2008. Retrieved June 19, 2008; \\"Debate over the Debates; McCain, Obama Clash over Joint Town Halls,\\" Fox News, June 13, 2008. Retrieved June 16, 2008. Following Obama's victory over Hillary Clinton, and taking advantage of a divide within the Democratic Party, McCain encouraged Clinton supporters to abandon their party and vote for him in November. The McCain campaign viewed the Democratic divide as an opportunity to court the \\"Reagan Democrats\\" who supported Clinton, and began sending high-profile female supporters to states that Clinton won in an effort to garner their votes. =Gramm departs= Former Senator Phil Gramm was a co- chairman of the McCain campaign, and McCain's chief economic adviser. He stepped down from the campaign on July 18, 2008, about a week after he made remarks to The Washington Times about the nation's economic conditions. Gramm had said, \\"You've heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession,\\" and \\"We have sort of become a nation of whiners. You just hear this constant whining.\\" McCain had quickly repudiated Gramm's remarks, saying \\"Phil Gramm doesn't speak for me, I speak for me. I strongly disagree.\\" When asked if Gramm was still in contention for the U.S. Treasury Secretary position as previously speculated, McCain had said, \\"I think Senator Gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador of Belarus, though I'm not sure the citizens of Minsk would welcome that.\\" Gramm said upon leaving that he had become a distraction to the campaign. =Obama-as-celebrity TV advertisement= A McCain campaign ad crafted by Fred Davis compared Barack Obama to known celebrities such as Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, and questioned his readiness to lead while criticizing his energy policy. The ads resulted in a tightening of Obama's lead in polls. After the election, Obama deputy campaign manager Steve Hildebrand said: \\"It was the first time during the general election where I started to freak out... I thought if they can brand him as a celebrity rather than as a serious leader we're going to be in serious trouble.\\" =Saddleback Civil Forum on the Presidency= =Running mate selection= McCain began a search for a running mate to join the Republican ticket after clinching the Republican nomination. Former candidates Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee were mentioned as possibilities, as were many other leaders in the Republican Party and the business world. Over Memorial Day weekend, McCain invited Romney, Florida Governor Charlie Crist, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal to his Sedona, Arizona ranch for informal get- togethers intended to assess personal chemistry for possible running mate selection. McCain then announced plans to reveal his running mate the day following the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention, and just a few days before the start of the Republican National Convention. During the running mate deliberations, McCain had favored Joe Lieberman, who shared his romantic sense of righteousness and honor.Thomas, A Long Time Coming, pp. 120‚Äì122. But the opposition from social conservatives, who objected to Lieberman's pro-choice views, was too strong, and a Lieberman pick might have caused a floor fight at the convention. McCain wanted someone who would shake up the race and reinforce his image as a maverick, so he decided against more conventional choices on his short list including Romney and Governor Tim Pawlenty. According to the book Game Change, on the weekend before John McCain made his vice-presidential pick, McCain's advisor Arthur Culvahouse asked attorney Ted Frank to prepare a written vetting report on Sarah Palin:Heilemann and Halperin, Game Change, p. 362. On August 29 (McCain's 72nd birthday), at the Nutter Center of Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, McCain's running mate was revealed in a surprise pick as Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. \\"McCain taps Alaska Gov. Palin as vice president pick\\" , CNN (August 29, 2008).. Retrieved August 29, 2008. McCain had only talked to her a few times, and the campaign's vetting operation had mostly relied on Internet searches to check her background.Thomas, A Long Time Coming, pp. 122‚Äì25. Palin's career in Alaska had shown maverick tendencies similar to McCain's, and McCain hoped that Palin's youth, reformist record, appeal to social conservatives, and appeal to disaffected Hillary Clinton voters would outweigh her lack of national and international visibility and experience. One of McCain's aides privately remarked via an American football metaphor during the announcement: \\"We just threw long.\\" =Convention= The McCains campaign on September 15, 2008, following the Republican National Convention At the 2008 Republican National Convention, McCain was formally nominated by roll call on the night of September 3, following Palin's vice-presidential acceptance speech. McCain himself appeared onstage at the convention for the first time following her speech, telling the cheering delegates, \\"Don't you think we made the right choice for the next vice president of the United States?\\" McCain accepted his party's nomination the following night. According to Nielsen Media Research, almost 39 million Americans watched McCain deliver his acceptance speech, while 37 million watched Palin the night before. Television viewership was unusually high for both parties' conventions, indicating that the election season was producing compelling drama. =Sarah Palin's Vice Presidential candidacy= Initial reaction After announcing Palin as the presumptive vice-presidential nominee, the McCain campaign received US$7 million in contributions in a single day. According to a Washington Post/ABC News survey published on September 9, 2008, he had gained huge support among white women voters since the announcement; he had not only surpassed Obama in white women voters, but also amassed a lead of five percentage points in the Gallup polls. John Zogby found that the effects of Palin's selection were helping the McCain ticket since \\"She has high favorability numbers, and has unified the Republican Party.\\" Sarah Palin at campaign rally in Carson City, Nevada, September 13, 2008 The choice received generally positive reactions from Republicans and conservatives. Victor Davis Hanson stated \\"the timing and choice were inspired\\", and Mark Steyn stated he was \\"happy\\" over the choice. Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell said of Palin, \\"She is strong. She is capable. She is articulate,\\" and suggested opponents should not underestimate her. Independent-Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman stated that McCain made a \\"bold choice\\" in picking a \\"maverick who has done exactly the same thing at the state level that he's done at the federal level.\\" However, some Republicans did not receive the choice favorably. Charles Krauthammer of the Washington Post wrote, \\"The Palin selection completely undercuts the argument about Obama's inexperience and readiness to lead.... To gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful 'Is he ready to lead' line of attack seems near suicidal.\\" David Frum of National Review wrote: \\"The longer I think about it, the less well this selection sits with me.... If it were your decision, and you were putting your country first, would you put an untested small-town mayor [sic] a heartbeat away from the presidency?\\". Following an NBC interview, Peggy Noonan commented, \\"It's over... the most qualified? No.\\"Noonan, Murphy trash Palin on hot mike: 'It's over', by Ben Smith, September 3, 2008. Republicans in Palin's home state, Alaska, had mixed reactions to the news. Alaskan Attorney General Talis Colberg, a Palin appointee, remarked that, \\"It's wonderful. It was an emotional thing to see the governor walk out with her family and I say, wow, I work for her.\\" Alaskan State Senate President Lyda Green, a Republican who had repeatedly sparred with Palin after she became governor, remarked, \\"She's not prepared to be governor. How can she be prepared to be vice president or president?\\" Larry Persily, a Palin staffer, and Jim Whitaker, the Republican mayor of Fairbanks, indicated their support of Palin as Governor, but questioned whether she was ready to serve as vice president. Other Alaskan politicians, such as Republican Gail Phillips, expressed surprise. Kari Sleight, publisher of the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman, which covered much of Palin's life in Wasilla, endorsed Palin for Vice-President. \\"While some question Palin's experience, they cannot question her leadership. A person is either a good leader or not, and Palin has exhibited great leadership skills in all positions she's held. There is an argument to be made that leadership, and the qualities that define a good leader, are inherently more important than experience.\\" Palin's positions and policies became the focus of \\"intense media attention\\" and \\"scrutiny\\" following her selection. Expectations from her speech at the Republican National Convention was heavily covered by the media. Some Republicans argued that Palin was subjected to unreasonable media coverage, and a Rasmussen survey showed that slightly more than half of Americans believed that the press was \\"trying to hurt\\" Palin with negative coverage, a sentiment referenced by Palin in her acceptance speech. A poll taken just after the speech found that Palin was then slightly more popular than either Obama or McCain with a 58% favorability rating. Palin was also a draw with Catholic voters; the poll found that 54% favor Palin and 42% find her unfavorable, a 12% difference, while Joe Biden was viewed favorable by 49% to 47% unfavorable. Palin also became a \\"ubiquitous presence on newsstands,\\" appearing on the cover of both Newsweek and Time, among others. The appearance on the cover of Time was particularly notable as Jay Carney, the newsmagazine's Washington bureau chief, has been vocally critical on what he has said is a lack of media access to Palin, concerns which were dismissed by the McCain campaign. The Palins and McCains campaigning in Fairfax, Virginia, September 10, 2008, following the Republican National Convention Former New York City Mayor Giuliani said that Palin was more qualified to be president than Democratic presidential nominee Obama, citing Palin's executive experience, saying of her, \\"She's vetoed legislation, she's taken on corruption, and in her party, and won. She took on the oil companies and won. She administered a budget successfully,\\" and of Obama, \\"He's never run a city, he's never run a state, he's never run a business, he's never administered a payroll, he's never led people in crisis\\". He also stated, if Sarah Palin had been president when the U.S. came under attack on Sept. 11, 2001, he is confident she would have been able to handle the crisis. According to the Washington Times, Palin's faith has made her a \\"favorite with the staunchly pro-Israel neoconservative elements in the Republican Party.\\" Palin displays an Israeli flag in her governor's office in Juneau.

Obama commented on Palin in an interview with 60 Minutes: Sarah Palin at a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa VP campaign developments By September 2008, Governor Palin had submitted to two media interviews, the first with ABC's Charles Gibson, and the second with Fox News's Sean Hannity. Gibson asked Palin, \\"Do you agree with the Bush doctrine?,\\" to which Palin responded, \\"In what respect, Charlie?\\" After asking Palin for her definition, Gibson defined the concept to be for the United States to \\"have the right of anticipatory self-defense.\\" Gibson also asked Palin about a prayer she had offered with regard to soldiers in Iraq. Commentators' reactions varied. Those generally critical of Palin's candidacy applauded Gibson's penetrating questions and thought aspects of Palin's responses showed that she was not ready to serve as Vice President, whereas those generally supportive of her candidacy took a more positive view of her performance. During the campaign, some pointed out alleged differences between Palin's positions as a gubernatorial candidate and her position as a vice-presidential candidate. While campaigning for vice- president, Palin touted her stance on \\"the bridge to nowhere\\" as an example of her opposition to pork barrel spending. In her nomination acceptance speech and on the campaign trail, Palin often said, \\"I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere.\\" Although Palin was originally a main proponent of the Gravina Island Bridge, McCain‚ÄìPalin television advertisements asserted that Palin \\"stopped the Bridge to Nowhere.\\" These statements have been widely questioned or described as misleading or exaggerations by many media groups in the U.S. Newsweek remarked, \\"Now she talks as if she always opposed the funding.\\" After McCain announced Palin as his running mate, Newsweek and Time put Palin on their magazine covers, as some of the media alleged that McCain's campaign was restricting press access to Palin by allowing only three one-on-one interviews and no press conferences with her. Besides the perceived motive of protecting the Vice Presidential nominee from media questions, the McCain campaign sought to have her constantly at McCain's side because Palin drew crowds. Among the reasons that the news organizations criticized the restrictions was Palin's first major interview, with Charles Gibson of ABC News, met with mixed reviews. Her interview five days later with Fox News's Sean Hannity focuses on many of the same questions from Gibson's interview. However, Palin's performance in her third interview, with Katie Couric of CBS News, was widely criticized. Palin's responses to several of Couric's questions were considered embarrassing, most notably failing to name any newspapers she read. The fallout from the interview prompted a decline in her poll numbers, concern among Republicans that she was becoming a political liability, and calls from some conservative commentators for Palin to resign from the Presidential ticket. Other conservatives remain ardent in their support for Palin, accusing the columnists of elitism. Following this interview, some Republicans, including Mitt Romney and Bill Kristol, questioned the McCain campaign's strategy of sheltering Palin from unscripted encounters with the press. Palin was reported to have prepared intensively for the October 2 vice-presidential debate with Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee Joe Biden at Washington University in St. Louis. Some Republicans suggested that Palin's performance in the interviews would improve public perceptions of her debate performance by lowering expectations. Polling from CNN, Fox and CBS found that while Palin exceeded most voters' expectations, they felt that Biden had won the debate. Palin signing an autograph at a campaign rally in O'Fallon, Missouri Upon returning to the campaign trail after her debate preparation, Palin stepped up her attacks on the Democratic candidate for President, Senator Barack Obama. At a fundraising event, Palin explained her new aggressiveness, saying, \\"There does come a time when you have to take the gloves off and that time is right now.\\" In a campaign appearance on October 4, Palin accused Obama of regarding America as \\"so imperfect that he's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country.\\" The accusation referred to Obama's contacts with Bill Ayers, a founder of the 1960s radical group called the Weathermen, and a New York Times article describing such contacts.Cooper, Michael. Palin, on Offensive, Attacks Obama's Ties to '60s Radical. The New York Times. October 4, 2008. The Obama campaign called the allegation a \\"smear\\", citing newspaper commentaries critical of Palin's attack. Obama has condemned the Weathermen's violent actions. The criticism of Obama based on his purported relationship with Ayers was subsequently carried on by McCain himself.Johnson, Alex. \\"McCain hammers Obama on Ayers ties\\", NBC News (October 23, 2008)..

By late October, voter reactions to Palin had grown increasingly negative, especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications.Cohen, Jon and Agiesta, Jennifer. \\"Perceptions of Palin Grow Increasingly Negative, Poll Says\\", The Washington Post (October 25, 2008).. Retrieved December 31, 2008. Republican and former US Secretary of State Gen. Colin Powell endorsed Obama on October 19 and said of Palin \\"Now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president.\\" A McCain aide said Palin had \\"gone rogue\\", placing her own future political interests ahead of the McCain/Palin ticket, directly contradicting her running mate's positions and disobeying directions from campaign managers. (A year after the election, Palin would title her memoir after this accusation.) Although McCain said later in life that he expressed regret for not choosing the independent Senator Joe Lieberman as his VP candidate instead, he has consistently defended Palin's performances at his events. RNC campaign expenditures The Republican National Committee's monthly financial disclosure report for September 2008 showed that US$150,000 had been spent on Palin's wardrobe, hair and makeup as well as clothing and accessories for her family. Campaign finance experts expressed concern about the legality of the spending and the tax implications to Palin. A campaign spokesperson responded saying that the clothing will be donated to charity following the election. By January 2009, it was reported that the clothing was stored in garbage bags at the Republican National Convention headquarters. In March 2009, a spokesperson for Palin stated that the clothes had been donated to charities The spending was later reviewed and approved by the U.S. Federal Elections Commission by a 5‚Äì0 vote. Another controversy erupted when it was revealed that her campaign paid makeup artist, Amy Strozzi, a sum of $22,800, making her the highest paid staffer on the McCain campaign. This prompted calls from Republican donors to \\"return the money.\\" Legacy New York Times journalist David Brooks says that, in nominating Palin as his running mate, McCain \\"took a disease that was running through the Republican party ‚Äì anti-intellectualism, disrespect for facts ‚Äì and he put it right at the centre of the party\\". Laura McGann in Vox says that McCain gave the \\"reality TV politics\\" and Tea Party movement more political legitimacy, as well as solidifying \\"the Republican Party's comfort with a candidate who would say absurdities ... unleashing a political style and a values system that animated the Tea Party movement and laid the groundwork for a Trump presidency.\\" =Post-convention poll surge and retreat= After the Republican National Convention, McCain saw his poll numbers increase nationwide, traced in part to movement among previously undecided voters. In the first half of September, McCain appointed William Timmons (a former senior adviser to Vice President George H. W. Bush in 1988, an advisor to Senator Bob Dole in 1996, the founder and chairman emeritus of lobbying firm Timmons and Company, and a former lobbyist for Freddie Mac) as his transition chief. From mid-September to mid-October, however, the trend lines were all in Obama's direction. For example, the RealClearPolitics electoral map went from an Obama 228‚Äì163 electoral vote lead on August 20 to a 227‚Äì207 McCain lead on September 17 and then back to a 306‚Äì157 Obama lead on October 24. =U.S. financial crisis= proposed bailout of U.S. financial system, September 25, 2008 In September 2008, the subprime mortgage crisis worsened and precipitated the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008; the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was quickly followed by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, sale of Merrill Lynch, and government bailout of American International Group. At first McCain emphasized that \\"the fundamentals of our economy are strong\\", but when questioned on that statement he clarified that the fundamentals refer to the American workforce. He then recast his message into emphasizing that the country's economy was in \\"a total crisis\\", condemning \\"greed\\", and proposing that a national commission be set up to study the situation, akin to the 9/11 Commission. He later commented on the Federal Reserve loan of $85 billion to AIG by saying, \\"I didn't want to do that...and I don't think anybody I know wanted to do that.\\" McCain then said that government regulators had been \\"asleep at the switch\\" and said if he were president he would fire U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Christopher Cox. On September 24, McCain announced that he would \\"suspend\\" his campaign and seek to delay a debate with Barack Obama scheduled for September 26 so that he could work with Congress toward a reworking of and agreement on the Paulson financial rescue plan. McCain urged Obama to do the same, but Obama did not. McCain's intervention helped dissatisfied House Republicans forestall a bailout plan that was otherwise close to agreement between the White House, Senate Republicans, and Congressional Democrats.Weisman, Jonathan. \\"How McCain Stirred a Simmering Pot\\", The Washington Post (September 27, 2008)..

Wurzelbacher was videotaped questioning Democratic candidate Barack Obama about his small business tax policy during a campaign stop in Ohio. He received prominence when he was mentioned frequently as \\"Joe the Plumber\\" in exchanges between Republican candidate McCain and Obama during the third presidential debate on October 15, 2008. After that \\"Joe the Plumber\\" was often used by the McCain campaign and the media as a metaphor for middle class Americans and to refer to Wurzelbacher himself. Tito the Builder Tito Mu√±oz, also known as Tito the Builder, received substantial media attention for various campaign activities. Mu√±oz publicly defended Joe Wurzelbacher in front of the media.

On October 10, 2008, a female McCain supporter at a rally said she did not trust Barack Obama because \\"he's an Arab.\\" McCain's rallies had become increasingly vitriolic, with hecklers denigrating Obama and with rallygoers displaying a growing anti-Arab, anti-Muslim, and anti-African-American sentiment. McCain replied to the woman, \\"No ma'am. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.\\" McCain's response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as marker for civility in American politics. However, several commentators criticised McCain for not challenging the supporter's anti-Arab racism: in a blog post Campbell Brown praised McCain for \\"setting the record straight\\", but asked: \\"So what if Obama was Arab or Muslim? So what if John McCain was Arab or Muslim?... Whenever this gets raised, the implication is that there is something wrong with being an Arab- American or a Muslim\\". Academic Juan Cole stated: \\"McCain should have said, 'there would be nothing wrong with being an Arab, but Obama is not.' The way he put it strongly implied that he had a low opinion of Arabs\\". Afghan- American novelist Khaled Hosseini wrote that \\"simply calling Obama 'a decent person' is not enough\\", whilst US-resident Jordanian journalist Salameh Nematt said: \\"Instead of rejecting the notion that being an Arab is a pejorative term, the Arizona senator, by denying that Obama is an Arab, succeeded in insulting millions of Arabs and Arab-Americans\\".

Palin criticized McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt heavily, and contended that the McCain campaign had mismanaged her media appearances. Schmidt replied that Palin's telling was \\"all fiction\\", and prior McCain strategist John Weaver denounced Palin for \\"petty and pathetic\\" attempts to get even.

Poll numbers varied greatly the day before the election and through the election season. This can be attributed to varying polling methods, demographics, and sample sizes between pollsters, amongst other things. Final polls ranged from an 11% advantage for Obama to only a 2% advantage. The most accurate final poll numbers were from Fox News, Ipsos/McClatchy, and CNN/Opinion Research which predicted a 7% advantage for Obama. Rasmussen Reports and Pew Research predicted a 6% advantage.

Media coverage An October 29, 2007, study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism and the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy found that through the first five months of 2007, McCain had received the most unfavorable media coverage of any of the major 2008 presidential candidates, with 12 percent of the stories having a favorable tone towards him, 48 percent having an unfavorable tone, and with the balance neutral. In terms of amount of coverage, McCain was the subject of 7 percent of all stories, second-most among Republicans and fourth-most overall. McCain's negative coverage mostly included pessimistic \\"horse race\\" stories that focused on his campaign's slippage in national polls and fundraising difficulty; it also included his support for the then-unpopular Iraq troop surge. McCain's campaign went through its near-total collapse soon after the window of this study; the press subsequently focused on a \\"McCain is dead\\" story line through the summer, which it was slow to change away from. By the time the 2008 primary season began, McCain's media coverage had shifted and he was now viewed as a \\"comeback\\" story. In addition, McCain returned to his long-standing practice of granting almost unlimited media access to him on this bus; this as well as the notion that he engages in \\"straight talk\\" free of political calculation gave him a positive personal sentiment in the press. Reflecting this feeling, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough joked of the media, \\"I think every last one of them would move to Massachusetts and marry John McCain if they could.\\" Measurements by the University of Navarra indicated that throughout January 2008, McCain's global media attention surged from being a distant third among Republican candidates to being the equal of Romney and Huckabee. In July 2008, the McCain campaign shifted to a much more restrictive attitude toward the press, virtually ending the former time for open-ended questions. McCain's press conferences became infrequent and, as one reporter stated, \\"He no longer ventures to the press section of his campaign plane to talk to reporters.\\" Music use John Rich performing his song \\"Raisin' McCain\\" at a campaign rally in O'Fallon, Missouri, August 31, 2008 The campaign was criticized and in one case a lawsuit filed for its use of music during campaign events and in advertising. Pioneering rock-n-roll artist Chuck Berry publicly snubbed McCain's use of his song \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" on the campaign, which had been selected by McCain \\"mainly because it has the chorus \\"Go Johnny Go Go Go\\" in it.\\" When Berry publicly stated his support for Obama in June, the McCain campaign began using ABBA's \\"Take a Chance on Me\\" instead. In August 2008, singer Jackson Browne filed suit against the McCain Campaign, The Republican National Committee and the Ohio Republican Party for use of \\"Running on Empty\\" in a commercial stating that the use violates the Lanham Act by implying an endorsement by Browne. In October, the Foo Fighters asked the campaign to stop using \\"My Hero\\", stating that this use of the song \\"tarnished\\" the original intent. The campaign also drew criticism from Heart for its use of \\"Barracuda\\" to accompany Sarah Palin's appearance at the Republican National Convention, with the group saying \\"Sarah Palin's views and values in no way represent us as American women.\\" Members of Van Halen objected to use of \\"Right Now\\", although former lead singer and co-writer of the song Sammy Hagar said he had no problem with the use: \\"Whether it was McCain who used the song or if Obama had chosen to use the song, with the current political climate, the lyrics still have the same meaning.\\" A McCain- Palin spokesperson responded saying that the campaign had properly licensed these songs giving them to permission to play them. The music has reportedly been used under blanket licensing, which does not require the artists' permission but still follows proper legal channels and includes royalty payments. McCain had better success in country music, where award-winning and popular songwriter John Rich wrote the campaign song \\"Raisin' McCain\\" in August 2008. Rich had a penchant for producing songs with political overtones, although The New York Times called this a \\"far less imaginative slice of propaganda\\" than some of his other efforts. He performed it at the closing ceremony of the Republican National Convention and at campaign rallies. In February 2009, a judge rejected motions made by the legal team for McCain and the Republican National Committee to dismiss the Browne lawsuit which charged possible copyright infringement, false endorsement and violation of Browne's right of publicity. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in July 2009, with the McCain campaign, the Ohio Republican Party, and the Republican National Committee issuing a joint apology for using the song. Their statement declared that McCain himself had been unaware of the use and did not condone it. Fundraising and finances After first-quarter fundraising totals were released in early April, totals showed McCain's $13.6 million lagging behind rivals in the race. He spent more than $8 million in campaign funds during the first quarter, leaving him with $5.2 million in the bank and $1.8 million in debts.Campaign Financial Reports Show McCain Lagging Rivals Washington Post. April 15, 2007. Retrieved June 21, 2007. McCain exceeded 51,000 individual donors, more than rivals Giuliani, with 28,356, and Romney, with 36,538. However, McCain was worried at the high \\"burn rate\\" of money used during the first quarter and retooled his entire financial operations after the reports came back.McCain Retools Money Team, Delays Entry Politico. April 3, 2007 Retrieved June 23, 2007. McCain's second-quarter fundraising totals were worse, with intake falling to $11.2 million and expenses continuing such that only $2 million cash was on hand. McCain's aides said the campaign was considering taking public matching funds There are some indications that although the campaign has $2 million cash on hand at the end of Q2, a 7-figure debt will make the monetary situation even more dire. As of September 30, 2007, McCain had raised $32,124,785 for his campaign for presidency. Private donors have given $30,183,761 toward his campaign, PACs have given $458,307, and $1,482,717 has come from other sources. 70% of the PAC contributions have come from business groups, 1% from labor groups, and the final 29% from ideological organizations. So far 95.6% of his finances have been disclosed, while 4.4% has not. McCain was the first candidate to accept financing from the presidential election campaign fund checkoff. During the campaign's summer 2007 financial woes, it used a list of donors as collateral in order to get approval on a bank loan. This raised the question of whether the campaign's privacy policy was violated by such a use. A McCain spokesperson said it did not, since all of the campaign's assets were pledged as collateral at the time, not just the donor list. By December 2007, McCain was using 32 lobbyists as fundraisers, more than any other candidate. Although McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, his opponent did not, and McCain criticized Obama for becoming the first major party candidate in history to opt out of public financing.Wayne, Leslie. \\"McCain Raised $27 Million in July\\", The New York Times (August 15, 2008).. Retrieved August 16, 2008.Barr, Andy. \\"Obama passes 2 million donors\\", The Hill (August 14, 2008).. Retrieved August 16, 2008. The McCain campaign received US$7 million in contributions in a single day after announcing Palin as the presumptive vice-presidential nominee. Nevertheless, down the stretch run of the general election campaign, McCain was outspent by Obama by a four-to-one margin. In the end, from September 1 to the end of the campaign, McCain spent directly the $84 million allotted to him by the public financing rules, while Obama, having opted out of that system, spent $315 million directly during the same period.\\"Obama raised $104 million as campaign ended\\", NBC News, December 4, 2008. Endorsements McCain gained the endorsements of many high profile Republican figures and organizations, including President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, former President George H. W. Bush, former First Lady Nancy Reagan, and the National Rifle Association. An endorsement by Texas pastor John Hagee stirred controversy due to past remarks, which some alleged to be anti-Catholic and anti-Jewish.George Interviews John McCain This Week with George Stephanopoulos, April 20, 2008, video.Transcript of McCain on ABC's \\"This Week\\" , time.com, April 20, 2008.McCain Admits Hagee Endorsement Was A Mistake , ABC News, April 20, 2008. McCain initially sought and accepted Hagee's endorsement, but on April 20, 2008, he described accepting the endorsement as a mistake. He formally rejected the endorsement on May 22, 2008, following news reports of a sermon Hagee gave in the 1990s alleging that Adolf Hitler driving the Jewish people from Europe was \\"God's will\\" as it was part of a divine plan to gather Jews in the Holy Land. McCain condemned Hagee's sermon as \\"crazy and unacceptable\\".

Because of his method of attack (entering his victims' homes through balconies off the ground) and the fact that his identity was unknown, he was called the Balcony Rapist by the popular media. Life in the 1980s After stalking his victims, Callow climbed onto their second- or third-story balconies and entered through broken windows or doors. Callow had already sexually attacked two women in the 1970s before he raped five women at knife-point during the Toronto attacks. His string of rapes in the Wellesley and Sherbourne area included the brutalization of a woman who became known as \\"Jane Doe\\". Jane Doe v. Board of Commissioners His fifth victim, using the pseudonym \\"Jane Doe\\", successfully sued the Toronto police for not having warned women in her neighbourhood about the four earlier rapes. She also claimed that the police were using her as bait to draw out the predator. The police took the position that if they had publicized the fact that a serial rapist was attacking women in the area, he would have simply committed his crimes in a different location, making his apprehension difficult. In fact, the Toronto police had threatened to charge Doe with mischief, because she put up posters in her neighbourhood warning about the Balcony Rapist.\\"Balcony Rapist's Jane Doe refuses to be victimized\\". CTV News, February 23, 2007. In a case filed as Jane Doe v. Board of Commissioners of Police for the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, Doe won her case and on July 3, 1998, was awarded damages of $220,000 plus interest by the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division). She was subsequently named Woman of the Year by the Canadian women's magazine Chatelaine in 1999, and published the book The Story of Jane Doe: A Book About Rape in 2003. Prison and later life Callow served the full length of his 20-year sentence in prison. While in prison, Callow was accused by a prison employee of sexual assault. After this accusation, Callow refused to participate in any treatment programs. On February 23, 2007, Callow, then 52 years old, was released from jail in British Columbia. He initially settled in Newton Town Centre in Surrey, British Columbia. Police did not release Callow's precise address. Following a protest in Surrey, Callow moved to New Westminster, British Columbia. On March 3, 2007 New Westminster had a rally of protest. It was reported on March 7, 2007, that Callow lived in an emergency shelter in New Westminster, and the only help he receives is a 20-minute daily meeting with a third-year social-work student. Callow was reported as saying he was \\"worried about vigilantism\\". When he was sentenced, Callow was not designated a dangerous offender. Concern about his release has led to a proposal by some elected officials from New Westminster for legislative change allowing convicts to be designated dangerous offenders after they have been sentenced, if they exhibit violent behaviour while in jail.

(1860) Yale University was an American physician, born in New York City. His father, Dr. Edward Delafield, was the son of the prominent John Delafield who had emigrated to America from London, England in 1783 carrying the provisional peace treaty between England and The United States. While his father Edward graduated Yale in 1812, Francis graduated at Yale (1860) and at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University (1863), and after further study abroad practiced medicine in New York. Francis was appointed to the staff of Bellevue Hospital (1874), and to the chair of pathology and practice of medicine in the College of Physicians and Surgeons (1875‚Äì82). Francis Delafield resided for many years at 5 West 50th Street in Manhattan, New York.Fifth Av. History In Razed Buildings, The New York Times, September 25, 1932, p. RE1. In 1886, he became the first president of the Association of American Physicians. Early life Francis Delafield was born in New York City, the son of Edward Delafield by his second marriage to Julia Floyd. Julia Floyd was the granddaughter of William Floyd, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. She was born, raised and married on the Floyd estate in Mastic, Long Island. Francis Delafield's mother Julia Floyd married Dr Edward Delafield in 1839 on the Floyd family's property in Long Island (currently the William Floyd House museum). She kept an extensive journal of her life during the Civil war until her death. She was one of a few women invited to attend Lincoln's 2nd inauguration. Julia Floyd was also the first women in New York to use ether to ease pain during childbirth. She endured hardship. Julia Floyd Delafield watched all of her husband's six children die of tuberculosis (his first wife had died of it also). Some of her five biological children also suffered from tuberculosis and died. And even her son [Francis Delafield] became gravely sick and nearly died. Francis' brother Augustus Floyd Delafield travelled extensively around Scotland and brought back a set of golf clubs in 1880s. The sport became popular in Darien and Augustus founded the Wee Burn Country Club in 1893. From London, Francis' grandfather (John Delafied) emigrated to New York City. The ship upon which he took passage bore letters of marque, and captured a French vessel. John Delafield volunteered in the action, and shared the prize money to the extent of ¬£100. He landed in New York City on April 5, 1783, and found himself especially welcomed as the bearer of a manuscript copy of the text of the treaty of peace, which had been handed him at the moment of sailing by an official in the British service. The conditions of peace were known, but the text had not yet been made public in England; and, although the official copy had been forwarded, the \\"Vigilant\\" had outstripped the bearer of the government dispatches by some days. John Delafield was a founder and director of the Mutual insurance company, established on June 15, 1787, that being the first company organized to take risks against fire in the City of New York after the Revolution. On January 12, 1792, he was appointed director of the branch of the U. S. bank, and was afterward elected to the same office. He was one of forty gentlemen who subscribed $10,000 each, and founded (February 1, 1796) the United insurance company, also acting as a director, and serving as president for many years. His summer residence on the East River, opposite Blackwell's Island, known as\\" Sunswick,\\" built in 1791, was one of the largest and best appointed private houses near New York. John Delafield had nine sons and four daughters. Two of his sons died young. Francis Delafield was fitted for college in private schools in New York City, and at Yale received a dissertation appointment in junior year and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. In 1863, he graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia, and then for some months continued his medical studies abroad ‚Äî in Paris, Berlin and London. Career Upon his return to the U.S. in 1865, he became surgeon in the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, and physician and pathologist in 1871 to the Roosevelt Hospital (now Mount Sinai West). He was the founder of the first pathological laboratory in US, and his writings upon pathological subjects were accepted as standard authorities. His first important literary work, \\"A Handbook of Post- Mortem Examination and Morbid Anatomy\\" (1872) was later rewritten and enlarged into \\"A Handbook of Pathological Anatomy and Histology\\" (1885) and became a textbook for medical colleges. In 1878, appeared his \\"Manual of Physical Diagnosis,\\" and in 1895 \\"Diseases of the Kidneys\\". Another achievement was his classification of the group of diseases generally treated under pulmonary consumption. Probably his most important contribution to medicine was \\"Studies in Pathological Anatomy,\\" published in 1882. Since 1868, when he became a lecturer on pathological anatomy in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Delafield had been a member of the Faculty of Columbia University. In 1875, he was appointed adjunct professor of medicine under Professor Alonzo Clark, and upon the latter's retirement in 1882 was elected his successor, as professor of pathology and the practice of medicine, being made professor emeritus in 1901. For a number of years since 1874, he was attached to the staff of Bellevue Hospital, at first as a member of the house staff, later as attending physician, and finally as consulting physician. He had served also as pathologist and attending physician to Roosevelt Hospital and as surgeon to the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. In 1890, he was honored with the degree of LL.D. from Yale, and, in 1904, Columbia conferred a similar degree upon him. He held membership in the New York County Medical Society, the New York Academy of Medicine, the Pathological Society, and the Association of American Physicians, becoming the first president of the latter organization in 1886. =The Delafield Commission= Francis Delafield was the nephew of Major Richard Delafield. In 1855, Secretary of War Jefferson Davis dispatched Maj. Richard Delafield, Maj. Alfred Mordecai, and Capt. George B. McClellan to the battlefields of Crimea to observe the European military in action. American military commanders had studied European armies before, but the Delafield Commission was the most ambitious military observation mission up to that time and the first to observe an ongoing war. Major Delafield procured illustrations of Crimean weaponry that informed designs for the United States Civil War. =Attended William McKinley= Francis Delafield was the primary physician who was consulted following the shooting of United States President William McKinley in September 1901. While Francis argued to use the X-Ray machine to photograph McKinley's organs and assess the damage, he met opposition from others unwilling to use the new technology. Some attribute this inaction to contributing to McKinley's ultimate demise. =Legacy= In 1948, in recognition for his career in medicine, the Francis Delafield Hospital opened as a cancer research center for Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. The six-story building was located at 163rd Street and Fort Washington Avenue in Manhattan. Its 2,000,000 volt roentgen ray installation was the second ever in New York City.New developments in cancer, CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, Volume 1, Issue 2, pages 64‚Äì67, January 1951 =Terms= * Delafield's hematoxylin ‚Äî a strong solution of hematoxylin crystals, 4 cc.; 95% alcohol, 25 cc.; saturated aqueous solution of ammonia alum, 400 cc.; expose in an unstoppered bottle to sun and air three or four days; filter and add 100 cc. of glycerin and 100 cc. of 95% alcohol. ::Dorland's Medical Dictionary (1938) Personal life On January 17, 1870 in Mulenburgh's church (6th avenue and 20th) Francis Delafield married Katherine Van Rensselaer (1849‚Äì1901), the daughter of Henry Bell Van Rensselaer and the granddaughter of Stephen Van Rensselaer III. Together, they were the parents of one son and three daughters: * Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Ray Delafield (1872‚Äì1923), who was active in the missions of the Episcopal Church and worked with the wounded during World War I. * Julia Floyd Delafield (1874‚Äì1952), who married Frederick S. Crosby. They were the grandparents of the musician David Crosby. * Cornelia Van Rensselaer Delafield (b. 1876) * Edward Henry Delafield (1880‚Äì1955) Delafield died in Noroton, Connecticut while visiting his sister. For some time he had been in poor health, and a week before his death suffered an attack of apoplexy. He was buried in Grace Church Cemetery at Jamaica, Long Island. Delafield Island Between 1859 and 1865, his father Dr. Edward Delafield, assembled a tract of land in Darien, Connecticut. After his parents died, in the summer of 1879, Francis Delafield inherited the entirety of the property in Darien then called \\"Delafield Farm\\". After the death of Francis, the property was looked after by his spinster sister Emma Harriot Delafield. When she died in 1921, the property then went to the only son of Francis: Edward Henry Delafield. After the 1929 stock market crash, Edward partitioned and parcelled off the land over the ensuing years. In an effort to sell land, the name was changed to \\"Delafield Wood\\" then \\"Delafield Estates\\" until Edward settled on the current name \\"Delafield Island\\". Edward Henry Delafield was a graduate of Yale college. He married Winifred Folsom and had four daughters. He lived on Delafield Island until his death in 1955. His daughter Elizabeth Van Rensselaer Delafield (1908‚Äì1983) lived on Delafield Island for many years. She had two children from her first marriage to the architect Robert Spurgeon; And two children from her second marriage to the attorney Frank A. Zunino Jr. Lineage Francis Delafield was of the family of Count de la Feld, which dates back to the darkest period of the Middle Ages (about the sixth century) and seated at the Chateaux of La Feld, in Alsace (extensive ruins still remain). Hubertus De La Feld from Alsace-Lorraine near Colmar, was the first of the family that emigrated to England. Because of his service in Hastings during the 1066 invasion of England, Hubertus De La Feld received large grants of land from William the Conqueror and settled near Halifax. In England, the family rose in stature when John Delafield distinguished himself in the imperial service against the Turks: having taken a standard from the enemy at the Battle of Zenta in Hungary was in 1697 created a Count of the Holy Roman Empire by Emperor Leopold I.

Pteah Kangaroo ‚Äì HQ of Australian Contingent- UNTAC The four groups were the Vietnamese-installed government of the State of Cambodia (SOC) which was supported by the Cambodian People's Armed Forces (CPAF); the communist Democratic Kampuchea (DK ‚Äì commonly known as the Khmer Rouge) which is supported by the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea (NADK); and the two non communist factions, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) which was supported by Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF); and the United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC) which was supported by the National Army of Independent Cambodia (ANKI). In August 1989, the UN proposed an observer mission to monitor the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia and supervise an internal peace process between the four factions. From 6‚Äì22 August 1989, two Australian officers were deployed to Thailand and Cambodia on the UN reconnaissance team planning the mission. In late March 1992, UNTAC was established under the 1991 Paris Agreements to supervise a cease-fire and general election in Cambodia. Australian diplomacy during 1989‚Äì1991 assisted the successful conclusion of the Agreements.  United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia  In October 1991, prior to UNTAC being formally established in United Nations Security Council Resolution 717. On 10 November 1991 45 Australian Army personnel flew to Cambodia as part of Australias advanced party to UNAMIC. The advanced party established an Australian HQ and provided basic radio communications to the 4 military factions headquarters. Australia contributed a 65-strong communications unit to its precursor, the UN Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC). The Australians (under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Russell Stuart) were among the first UN troops in Cambodia, to provide communications support to UNAMIC which was tasked to set in motion the peace process and pave the way for the deployment of UNTAC. UNAMIC's mandate ended in March 1992 and was absorbed into UNTAC at its establishment in United Nations Security Council Resolution 745. United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia On UNTACs establishment, the Australian Defence Force contingent increased to 502 personnel, comprising the 488 strong Force Communications Unit (FCU) and 14 staff on HQ UNTAC spread out across 60 locations throughout Cambodia. The FCU was originally based on the 2nd Signal Regiment (based in Watsonia, Melbourne), but reinforced from many other units, including 20 personnel each from the RAN and the RAAF. The FCU also included a further 40 New Zealand personnel. UNTAC's military component comprised some 16,000 personnel from 32 countries. The Force Commander of this operation was Australia's Lieutenant General J.M. Sanderson AC. Front Gate ‚Äì Pteah Australii Since 1991 when the original Australian UNAMIC contingent provided the communications network between the four Cambodian factions' military headquarters and the UNAMIC headquarters, the task of the Australians mushroomed under its UNTAC mandate. To achieve those tasks, the FCU based its RHQ in Phnom Penh (Pteah Kangaroo), along with the headquarters of its administrative squadron and 1 Sig Sqn (Pteah Australii). 2 Sig Sqn was based in the northern provincial capital of Battambang. The FCU was spread across 56 locations throughout Cambodia and was the only unit to serve in Cambodia to see more action than any other UN unit. Other major FCU locations included Siem Reap, Kampong Som, Banteay Meanchey, Khu, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, Pailin and Sisophon.

From 15 May to 19 July 1993, Australia contributed a further 115 troops and six S70A Blackhawk helicopters, with the deployment of a squadron from the 5th Aviation Regiment and an infantry platoon protection party from the 2nd/4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Australian Army Patch ‚Äì UNTAC Post UNTAC After the elections, UNTAC was closed on 15 November 1993 and replaced by the United Nations Military Liaison Team (UNMLT). UNMLT comprises 20 military observers and their task is to maintain close liaison with the Cambodian Government and report to the Secretary-General on matters affecting security in Cambodia and also assisting the Government in dealing with residual military matters related to the Paris Agreement. UNMLT was established for a single period of six months. Military observers are eligible to receive the UNTAC medal.

The producers of Buitenhof fired Livestro after just four months, saying that his columns were subpar. Livestro said in a Telegraaf op-ed that he was fired for his \\"right-wing views,\\" that the show routinely ignores alternate viewpoints and even censures columnists' views. He also called one of the broadcaster of Buitenhof, the NPS, a \\"left-wing funnel,\\" where \\"a DDR mentality reigns.\\" In wake of Livestro's firing, political parties D66 and VVD asked parliamentary questions to the culture minister, Ronald Plasterk, who incidentally was Livestro's predecessor at Buitenhof. Plasterk answered that there was enough diversity in Dutch public television. Livestro later wrote a longer account his experiences at Buitenhof for Pajamas Media.

Identified as having a natural talent as an onnagata (female impersonator), he has been trained in that field, and performs in female roles onstage. He has acted in two films by director Takeshi Kitano. In 2003, in Zatoichi, he portrayed the child Seitaro who, when older, disguised himself as a geisha (played by Daigoro Tachibana). Though in a different troupe from Tachibana, the two have frequently practiced and performed together. Saotome was also in Kitano's 2005 film, Takeshis', in which he was credited as himself, playing a young female impersonator and dancer. Saotome also plays young male roles, particularly those with a bish≈çnen aesthetic, i.e. graceful, beautiful young men. In 2005, he played the role of Mori Ranmaru in a National Museum event called \\"Sengoku Fantasy\\", and on New Year's 2007, he played a young Horibe Yasubee in the NHK New Year's jidaigeki play.

On August 30, 1983 Casey defeated Adrian Adonis to win the Southwest Championship Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship. A month later, on September 11 he defeated Tully Blanchard to win the SWCW Southwest Heavyweight Championship. In September, Casey also held the SWCW Southwest Tag Team Championship with Buddy Mareno, replacing the 'injured' Bobby Jaggers. After leaving SCW he went to World Class Championship Wrestling where he was managed by Sunshine. Casey and Sunshine would also bring in The Great Kabuki in a feud with Jim Cornette and Midnight Express, and later Kabuki after he turned on Scott and Sunshine. John Tatum and Missy Hyatt would also show up and work a program with Casey and Sunshine too. However he would leave WCCW in the middle of the program and Sunshine would keep the program going with other wrestlers involved. = World Wrestling Federation (1987-1989) = On the June 13, 1987 edition of WWF Superstars Casey made his debut, teaming with Lanny Poffo in a loss to Demolition. He immediately began wrestling full-time for the World Wrestling Federation and was programmed into a short house show series against heel cowboy wrestler Ron Bass. Casey was slotted into an upper level opening card enhancement talent, losing that summer to the likes of Rick Rude and The Honky Tonk Man but also defeating Jose Estrada, Mike Sharpe and Steve Lombardi. On WWF television he was used primarily as an enhancement talent, and would not gain his first televised victory until the September 24, 1987 edition of Prime Time Wrestling where he teamed with SD Jones to defeat The Shadows.

Brian Pillman was another very close wrestler to the family and the only person who was neither related to the Hart through blood or marriage to be a member of the Hart Foundation. He has stated that he considered Bret and Owen as brothers to him and that he would have done anything for them.

Bret Hart referred to him as like a family member.  Storyline relatives  During the 1980s, Stampede Wrestling featured a villainous commentator and manager by the name Hugh Hart. He was said to be a cousin of the Hart family and would often ostracize Stu Hart over what he perceived as letting his children get away with bad behaviour. He also managed a team called \\"The Blackharts\\". In the late 80s the Stampede storylines also included a fictional brother of Davey Boy Smith by the name of Johnny Smith who feuded with Davey and Owen, the storyline also involved Diana Hart, who was worried over how Johnny's behaviour would affect their family. In PWA Canada, Smith Hart's fictional son Corey Hart (actually Corey Wyniarsky) has worked with Smith's actual step-son Mike as his manager and also later in-ring rival.http://www.pro-wrestling.com/news/viewArticle/canada-pure-wrestling- association-5-30-kitchener-on-resultshttp://www.pro- wrestling.com/news/viewArticle/canada-pure-wrestling- association-3-19-kitchener-on-resultshttp://tjrwrestling.net/the-heart-of- indy-wrestling-beats-in-every-fan-by-heather-hickey/  History  = Amateur wrestling = Stu Hart was an experienced grappler who held many national championships. Several of his sons, including Keith, Dean, Bret and Owen had experience in amateur wrestling. With Bret and Owen being considered outstanding as young men.Hardcore Wrestling! ‚Äì Page 1978 Conor and Stewart Hart, two of Keith's sons pursued amateur wrestling, Conor did so at the University of Calgary and Stewart won a medal in his school championship. = Professional wrestling = The Hart family is one of the most well-known professional wrestling families in history. The patriarch of the family, Stu Hart was a professional wrestler and a trainer as well as the owner of Stampede Wrestling. Many of his children became professional wrestlers. He became involved with wrestling after retiring from his career with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. Stu began promoting wrestling in 1948 and operated Stampede Wrestling until selling it to Vince McMahon in 1984. In 1985, however, he decided to revive the promotion, which remained in operation until December 1989. It was brought back again in 1999 by Bruce and Ross Hart and remains active today. Stu Hart has been noted from training some of North America's most famous wrestlers, including Andr√© the Giant, the \\"British Bulldog\\" Davey Boy Smith, Dynamite Kid, Junkyard Dog, and dozens more in addition to his own sons. Bret Hart has won the most wrestling championships of anyone in the family. He won his first title belt in the World Wrestling Federation while teaming with brother-in-law Jim Neidhart (Ellie Hart's husband) to form The Hart Foundation tag team. They had a feud with the British Bulldogs (Diana Hart's husband Davey Boy Smith and Bret Hart's sister-in-law's husband Dynamite Kid, who were first cousins in real life). On January 26, 1987, Hart and Neidhart defeated the Bulldogs to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. After the Hart Foundation split up, Owen Hart began teaming with Neidhart as The New Foundation. Bret went on to have a successful career as a singles wrestler, holding the WWF World Heavyweight Championship five times. The family connection played a role in two major WWF storylines. Four of the Hart brothers (Bret, Owen, Keith, and Bruce) formed a team at Survivor Series 1993.Davies, 62. Animosity began to build between Bret and Owen, and Owen turned on Bret at Royal Rumble 1994. This led to a feud between the two brothers; Neidhart later became involved on Owen's side, while Smith sided with Bret.Davies, 68. The feud culminated with Owen costing Bret the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. While Bret was defending the title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994, Owen tricked his mother Helen into throwing a towel into the ring to signify that Bret conceded defeat. Several years later, the Hart Foundation was formed again, this time as a stable of anti- American wrestlers. Bret and Owen reconciled, and they were joined by Neidhart, Smith, and Brian Pillman (Pillman was not related, but had trained with the Hart family and was a friend of the family). At the In Your House: Canadian Stampede pay-per-view in Calgary on July 6, 1997, the Hart Foundation won a five-on-five match against \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust, and The Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal). Bret Hart left the WWF in 1997 after what has come to be known as the Montreal Screwjob, while Owen died as the result of a failed stunt during his ring entrance at the Over the Edge 1999 pay-per-view. Bret would eventually return to the renamed WWE in 2010 after settling his differences with the promotion. Three of Stu and Helen Hart's grandchildren have begun careers in professional wrestling. Nattie Neidhart, daughter of Ellie and Jim, trained in Calgary and now wrestles for World Wrestling Entertainment (formerly the WWF) under the ring name Natalya. She was the first female from the Hart family to win a championship gold, when she won the Divas Championship at Survivor Series 2010. Harry Smith, son of Diana and Davey Boy Smith, currently uses the name Davey Boy Smith Jr. and also wrestled for WWE, under the name David Hart Smith. Teddy Hart, son of Georgia Hart and BJ Annis, has also competed in WWE, but was released by the company. In the mid and late 90s Harry Smith, T.J. Wilson, Teddy and his brother Matthew were all training together. Matthew would later wrestle shortly together with Wilson, Smith and his brother before dying of a flesh eating disease in 1996. Two of Bruce Hart's sons Bruce Jr and Torrin have been involved in pro wrestling. Torrin began wrestling when he was 17 years old.http://www.sportsnet.ca/960/the-big-show/bruce-hart-studio-w-rob-kerr/ Two of Smith Hart's sons, Mike and Matt Herweg have started a career in wrestling. They perform under the names Matt Hart and Mike Hart, using their father's surname. Matt gained his first championship on December 15, 2017, for the Real Canadian Wrestling promotion.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=188999 Both of Alison's daughters, Lindsay and Brooke have had relationships with wrestlers, Lindsay with Randy Myers and Brooke with Peter Minnema better known under his ring name \\"Pistol\\" Pete Wilson. Brooke and Peter Minnema are now married since 2014. Minnema was trained in by the Hart family and has appeared for the Hart Legacy promotion.

A person with a life interest is known as a life tenant. A life interest ends when the life tenant dies. An interest in possession trust is the most common example of a life interest trust. In a typical interest in possession trust, the life tenant receives all the income from the trust for the rest of his or her life. On the life tenant's death, the trust comes to an end, and the capital of the trust is paid to another person, known as the remainderman, as specified by the trust document. One form of life interest is a life estate, an ownership interest in property that lasts for the life of the party to whom it has been granted. Unlike the beneficiary of a trust, the owner of a life estate in property has the right to possession of the property and may use it as any other owner, subject only to a duty to avoid waste of the property value affecting parties with a future interest.

History On April 6th 1996, the MKSS announced a strike in the city of Beawar in Ajmer, Rajasthan.After a series of public hearings exposed systemic corruption across Rajasthan, and the reneging of the promise of the Right to Information given by the then Chief Minister of Rajasthan, the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan began a historic forty-day-long dharna (sit in protest) to demand the Right to Information. Protestors came from across rural Rajasthan to the city of Beawar. The novelty of this protest was the demand for information by the poor instead of expected basic needs like food and shelter. During the protest, a memorandum was given to the sub- divisional officer at Beawar that demanded local expenditure records. The protest began with support from over one hundred and fifty villages. It was supported by donations of grain from these villages and individuals in Beawar. Almost forty-six thousand rupees were donated to keep the protest going. Nearby vegetable vendors donated to the protestors providing them with food and water. Doctors offered their services. Local people joined in and walked with the rural protestors. The people of Beawar embraced the protest and began to make it their own. The protest was marked by cultural expression including song, theatre and puppetry. Local cultural groups joined in. These included a group of devotional singers (Bhajan Mandali) who would sing parodies of devotional songs in support of the demands of the protestors. Bagpipers and local poets also joined in. Local cadres of trade unions also lent their support. As the protest gained momentum, people began to visit Beawar from across the country to see the extraordinary happenings that were taking place in this small city in Rajasthan. Journalists, lawmakers, and artists, amongst many others came to the city of Beawar. Senior journalists who visited included Nikhil Chakravartty, Kuldip Nayar, and Prabhash Joshi. Prabhash Joshi wrote a historic editorial in the Jansatta newspaper entitled \\"Hum Jaanenge, Hum Jiyenge\\" (We will know, we will live). This title became a slogan of the RTI movement in India and was modified to say \\"the right to know is the right to live\\". = Remembering the Fight= In April 2015, the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan returned to Chang gate, the site of the forty day long protest to commemorate entering the tenth year of remembering the protest. Celebration of 40-day dharna, 2015, Beawar, RajasthanA street exhibition entitled \\"Beawar ka Junoon bana desh ka kanoon\\" (Beawar's determination became the nation's law) with archival photos, posters and newspaper articles was set up. Old protest songs were sung as many citizens of Beawar who had been part of the protests remembered the struggle. A museum with archival material to remember the city that gave birth to the RTI movement is being planned at Bewar. Jan Sunwaii (Public Hearings) One of the innovations of the MKSS was the method of Jan Sunwaiis or Public Hearings where detailed documents derived from official expenditure records were read aloud to the people of the villages who gathered. Jan Sunwaiis are organised independent of the government but government officials are invited to attend.

In 1605, he was professed in the Dominican Order and in 1611, he arrived in the Philippines where he worked as missionary to Pangasinan and later as Professor of Theology at the Colegio de Santo Tomas. In 1623, he departed for Japan when the persecution was most violent. During ten years he worked among the Christians, comforting them, reconciling the apostates, administering the sacraments in painfully difficult circumstances. Constantly sought by the authorities, and desiring martyrdom, he was captured in July 1633 and interned in the prison of Nagoya. Taken to Nagasaki, and after refusing to renounce his faith, he was placed in the torment of gallows and the pit on August 13, 1633 and died the next day. Ib√°√±ez was aided in his missionary efforts by Francis Shoyemon, a Japanese layman who later was received into the Order of Preachers as a Dominican Cooperator Brother. Shoyemon served as a catechist and translator, and when Ib√°√±ez was imprisoned, Shoyemon was with him. It was while they were in prison that Ib√°√±ez received Shoyemon into the Dominican Order as a cooperator brother. The two coworkers in the faith were put to death on the same day. Cause of beatification and canonization The Positio Super Introductione Causae or the cause of beatification was authored by respected historian, Fidel Villarroel, which led to his beatification during Pope John Paul II's papal visit to the Philippines. It was the first beatification ceremony to be held outside the Vatican in the modern era (often during the middle ages beatifications were delegated to papal legates).

The treaty confirmed the terms of the August 12th Armistice of Cormons, resulting in the transfer of Venetia and most of Friuli to the French Empire, who then gave the region to Italy. This represented the final division of the Habsburg ruled Kingdom of Lombardy- Venetia, as the Lombard half had been ceded to the Kingdom of Sardinia in the earlier 1859 Treaty of Zurich. The treaty forced the Austrian government to recognise the sovereignty of the new Italian Kingdom. This coupled with the Prussian defeat of Austria made apparent the decline of the Habsburg Monarchy as a great power. The treaty also signalled the rise of Italy as the sixth great power of Europe. Background alt= Since 1848 Italian nationalist societies and the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia had been trying to unify the post-Napoleonic Italian states into a single Italian nation. The main obstacle to Italian Unification was the Habsburg Monarchy, which directly or indirectly controlled much of Italy and was actively invested in keeping Italy divided . To overcome Austrian military might Piedmont (then Italy from 1861) would need to rely on foreign intervention by other European nations to overcome Austria. To this end the Piedmontese Prime Minister, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, forged an alliance with France, agreeing to turn over the French speaking provinces of Savoy and Nice to France in exchange for military support against Austria . This support would be vital to Italian success in the Second War of Italian Unification, which resulted in the Austrians ceding Lombardy to Piedmont. In mid-June of 1866 war broke out between Austria and Prussia over the administration of Schleswig and Holstein and the future of the German Confederation. Italy took advantage of the situation by siding with Prussia in the conflict, declaring war on Austria on 20 June. The Italian government hoped that the ongoing Austro-Prussian campaign would allow their armies to flank the Austrian forces, seizing Venice, Friuli, Trentino, and Trieste with little difficulty. Austrian forces defeated the Italian Army at the Battle of Custova and the Italian Navy at Battle of Lissa; however, in the meantime, Giuseppe Garibaldi's volunteers had advanced in the direction of Trento in the invasion of Trentino, winning the battle of Bezzecca. Later, the Habsburgs were forced to seek an armistice with Italy due to the collapse of their northern armies following the decisive Battle of Sadowa and the rapid Prussian advance into Bohemia and towards Vienna. On 12 August, an armistice was signed by Austria and Italy at Cormons bringing an end to the fighting. Provisions of the Treaty The land ceded to France by Austria per the terms of the treaty shown in Dark Blue. Later incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy following a plebiscite. Although Italy was on the winning side of the conflict, its poor military performance left it in a weak bargaining position at the negotiating table. As a result, Austria only agreed to surrender the land of the former Venetian Republic, which excluded the Italian speaking areas of Gorizia and Trieste. Furthermore, Austria refused to give this land directly to Italy, instead handing it to the French Empire, who then gifted it to Italy, at last fulfilling their obligations to Italy for ceding Savoy and Nice. The Italians felt this was a humiliation and called for a plebiscite within Venetia, allowing them to decide whether or not to join the Kingdom of Italy, so that it could be said Venice joined the Italian Nation willingly. The treaty also forced Italy to pay a cash indemnity for each Austrian fort present in Venetia, as well as requiring them to assume the state debt Venetia had accumulated while under Austrian control. The treaty required Austria to formally acknowledge the existence of the Kingdom of Italy. Austria was also made to give Italy the Iron Crown of Lombardy, the crown used by the medieval Kings of Lombardy. Consequences of the Treaty For Austria the Treaty of Vienna and the concurrent Treaty of Prague with Prussia were national humiliations, one Austrian general remarked ‚Äòthat we [Austria] have sunk to the level of Turkey‚Äô. As a result of the twin defeat to both Prussia and Italy the Austrian government incurred a massive state debt, throwing the government into turmoil. With the Empire on the brink of collapse the Viennese government was forced to partake in the 1867 Austro-Hungarian Compromise, which forced the Austrian government to grant significant autonomy to the Hungarian portion of the Empire. This resulted in the Empire being renamed as the Austro- Hungarian Empire and brought about greater equality between Hungarian and German speaking peoples of the Empire. With the loss of Venetia Austrian influence on the Italian Peninsula established by the Congress of Vienna was brought to an end. All this combined reinforced the idea that Austria had become a second-rate great power. The treaty brought the Italian state greater prestige and elevated its diplomatic position in Europe as a great power. However, due to Italy‚Äôs poor performance in the war Austria was able to retain several strategic mountains passes and mountain peaks in the Alps. This would have serious strategic implications for Italy during the First World War when fighting on the Alpine Front against Austria. Italian Unification Giuseppe Garibaldi leading Italian soldiers in the Battle of Bezzecca, in modern day Trentino-Alto Adige. The Treaty of Vienna was a major milestone for the Unification of Italy, bringing Venice and the Veneto into the Italian State. After the war the Italian King, Victor Emmanuel, proclaimed that ‚ÄòItaly was made but not complete‚Äô. Although the treaty secured Venetia for Italy, sects of the Italian government and many Italian nationalists, including Garibaldi, did not feel Italy had gained enough territory, with many had hoping the treaty would also gain Trieste and Trentino for Italy, with some going as far lay claim to the South Tyrol, Fiume (Rijeka), and the Dalmatian Coast . This disappointment became the driving force of Italian Irredentism in the late nineteenth century. It would be this ongoing desire to claim Trieste and Trentino that would be the main cause for Italy‚Äôs entry into the First World War against Austria-Hungary. After the 1919 Paris Peace Settlement Italy‚Äôs territorial ambitions would be partially fulfilled with the acquisition of Trentino-South Tyrol, and Trieste, however, it was only under Mussolini that the full goals of 1866 would accomplished when Fascist Italy occupied the Dalmatian coast, an acquisition that was reversed following the end of the Second World War.

Shot on location at Machu Picchu in Peru, the film is often credited as the inspiration for Raiders of the Lost Ark. The supporting cast features Robert Young, Nicole Maurey and Thomas Mitchell, as well as a rare film appearance by Peruvian singer Yma Sumac. Plot American adventurer Harry Steele (Charlton Heston) earns a living as a tourist guide in Cusco, Peru but plans to make his fortune by finding the Sunburst, an Inca treasure. He possesses an ancient carved stone which gives the location of the Sunburst but has no means to travel there. He is also menaced by his dubious associate Ed Morgan (Thomas Mitchell) who wants the treasure for himself and tries to have Harry killed. When Romanian defector Elena Antonescu (Nicole Maurey) arrives, Harry apparently agrees to help her travel to Mexico so she can then get to America, but in reality he uses her situation to his own advantage. Together with Elena, he steals a plane used by a Romanian official who is attempting to get Elena to return and uses it to fly to Machu Picchu. There he discovers an archaeological expedition headed by Dr Stanley Moorehead (Robert Young), who is preparing to enter the tomb where the Sunburst is said to be located. Moorehead becomes infatuated with Elena, while Morgan arrives and coerces Harry into helping him find the treasure. While Morgan is asleep, Harry slips away and enters the tomb, locating the Sunburst hidden inside a hollow pillar. Morgan then appears and grabs the Sunburst at gunpoint before shooting his way out of the temple while being pursued by Harry and a group of locals. Trapping Morgan on a cliff edge, Harry gets the Sunburst back while Morgan falls to his death. Rather than take it for himself, he gives the Sunburst back to the local Indians who believe it must be returned to the temple.

Paramount announced it as part of their 1953 slate in July 1952. Adventure films set outside America were popular in Hollywood at the time; producer Mel Epstein says that Paramount decided to make this film mostly because there had not been one shot in Peru before. Wendell Corey was originally announced as the leading star. In July 1953 Paramount took over Hal B. Wallis' contract with Charlton Heston and announced he would make the film after he finished The Naked Jungle. Secret of the Incas was filmed on location in Peru at Cuzco and Machu Picchu, the first time that a major Hollywood studio filmed at this archeological site. A sixteen-person unit, including Heston, producer Mel Epstein and director Jerry Hopper, spent a month filming footage in Peru in 1953. Five hundred indigenous people were used as extras.Production Notes ‚Äì Secret Of The Incas @ TCM Database The film also featured the Peruvian singer Yma Sumac as Kori-Tica. The female lead was to have been played by Viveca Lindfors. However, after the positive response to Nicole Maurey's performance in Little Boy Lost Paramount gave her the role. Thomas Mitchell was signed to play the villain. Studio filming started in October 1953. Shortly beforehand, Wendell Corey dropped out of the film. He was replaced by Robert Young. Filming ended on 22 November. The film caused a surge in tourism to Peru in 1954. Influence on Raiders of the Lost Ark Charlton Heston and Nicole Maurey The film is often cited by film buffs as a direct inspiration for the Indiana Jones film franchise, with many of the scenes in Secret of the Incas bearing a striking resemblance in tone and structure to scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Throughout Secret of the Incas, the main character, Harry Steele, can be seen wearing the \\"Indiana Jones\\" outfit: brown leather jacket, fedora, tan pants, an over-the-shoulder bag, and revolver.Review @ TheRaider.Net The character also sometimes wears a light beard, unusual for films of its time, and there is a tomb scene involving a revelatory shaft of light similar to the \\"Map Room\\" sequence in Raiders. Raiders' costume designer Deborah Nadoolman Landis noted that the inspiration for Indiana's costume was Charlton Heston's Harry Steele in Secret of the Incas: \\"We did watch this film together as a crew several times, and I always thought it strange that the filmmakers did not credit it later as the inspiration for the series\\" and quipped that the film is \\"almost a shot for shot Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\" Other media On December 14, 1954, Charlton Heston and Nicole Maurey reprised their roles in a Lux Radio Theater version of Secret of the Incas.

It was built in the traditional Minangkabau Rumah Gadang vernacular architectural style, but had a number of atypical elements including a three-story structure and a larger dimension in comparison to common rumah gadang. Since the Pagaruyung Kingdom was disbanded in 1833, no king or royal family resides in the palace today but is still held in high esteem among Minangkabau people, as the descendants of scattered Minang nobles (bangsawan) still find roots and links to the former royal house of Pagaruyung. The palace has been destroyed by fire several times, in 1804, 1966 and 2007. It has been rebuilt again and today functions as a museum and popular tourist attraction. Architecture Rangkiang (Minang rice barn) in the palace complex The original Pagaruyung palace was built entirely from timber masonry, however, the current building frame was built using modern concrete structure. Nevertheless, the Istano Basa Pagaruyung was quite faithfully restored using traditional techniques and materials adorned with 60 carvings that signify Minang philosophy and culture. The palace has three stories with 72 pillars and the typical Rumah gadang gonjong, a horn-like curved roof made from 26 tons of black ijuk aren palm fibers. The palace is also furnished with over 100 replicas of Minang antique furniture and artifacts, aiming the palace to be revived as Minangkabau cultural center as well as a tourism attraction in West Sumatra. History The original Pagaruyung palace was built on Batu Patah Hill and was burned down during a riot in Padri War in 1804. The palace was rebuilt but was destroyed again by a fire in 1966. The building was then rebuilt again in 1976 as a replica of the original Pagaruyung palace. It was built after the suppression of the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) movement in 1958, which was based in West Sumatra. Then-West Sumatra governor Harun Zen initiated construction of the Istano Basa Pagaruyung in 1976 as a way of reviving the flagging pride of the Minang community after the suppression. The restoration of the palace marked with the erection of tunggak tuo (main columns) on 27 December 1976 by West Sumatra Governor Harun Zain. After completion, the palace has become well-known to the public as a museum and tourist attraction. This building was not built on the original site but moved south from the original site. The palace was destroyed by fire on the evening of February 27, 2007 after the roof was struck by lightning. It was estimated that only 15 percent of the valuable artifacts survived the fire. Today the surviving artifacts are stored in Balai Benda Purbakala Kabupaten Tanah Datar (Archaeology Authority of Tanah Datar Regency). The pusaka or heirloom of the Pagaruyung Kingdom was stored in Silinduang Bulan Palace, located about 2 kilometers from Pagaruyung Palace. Restoration of the building took six years and an estimated RP20 billion (US$1,71 million) to complete. The building was completed and inaugurated by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in October 2013.

She became particularly associated with the works of Jules Massenet and was an admired interpreter of the title role in Bizet's Carmen. For many years Leblanc was the lover of Belgian playwright and writer Maurice Maeterlinck, and he wrote several parts for her within his stage plays. She portrayed the role of Ariane in Ariane et Barbe-bleue, both in the original 1899 stage play by Maeterlinck and in the 1907 opera adaptation by Paul Dukas. Leblanc also appeared in a couple of French films, most notably L'Inhumaine in 1924. In the last few decades of her life she turned to writing, producing two commercially successful autobiographies and several children's books and travelogues. Biography Georgette Leblanc was born into a cultured family that valued the arts of all forms and encouraged her to pursue music, acting, and writing. She initially worked for a short time as an actress on the Paris stage before studying music under Jules Massenet in that city.Biography of Georgette Leblanc on Operissimo.com (in German); accessed 31 January 2009. She made her professional opera debut at the Op√©ra-Comique on 23 November 1893 as Fran√ßoise in Alfred Bruneau's L'attaque du moulin. Shortly thereafter she returned to that opera house to sing the title role in Bizet's Carmen. In 1894 she joined the roster at the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie where she sang numerous parts for the next three seasons, including: Anita in La Navarraise and the title roles in both Massenet's Tha√Øs and Carmen once again.Elizabeth Forbes: \\"Georgette Leblanc\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (accessed 30 January 2009), (subscription access) In 1895, Leblanc met playwright Maurice Maeterlinck in Brussels with whom she began a 23-year romantic relationship. That same year the couple moved to the district of Passy in Paris, living together openly to the chagrin of their Catholic families. Leblanc had married a Spanish man a few years previously, and the Roman Catholic Church refused to give her a divorce from her unhappy marriage. The couple's home became a center for the artistic community with individuals like Octave Mirbeau, Jean Lorrain, and Paul Fort frequently being entertained at their house. The couple also owned a home in Normandy where they would go for the summers.Bettina Knapp, Maurice Maeterlinck, (Thackery Publishers: Boston, 1975), pp. 87-92. Beginning with Aglavaine and S√©lysette in 1896, she began to appear in a number of Maeterlinck's plays, several of which included characters specifically written for or based on her. She also sang in a number of recitals and concerts in Paris that included German lieder by Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann that had been translated into French by Maeterlinck. She remained active in opera in Paris, notably appearing as Fanny in Massenet‚Äôs Sapho at the Op√©ra-Comique in 1897. She later recorded several arias from Sapho with the composer on the piano in 1903.Knapp, 87-92.Profile, historicopera.com; accessed 14 March 2019. Beginning in August 1893, Maeterlinck collaborated with Claude Debussy on the opera Pell√©as et M√©lisande, which was based on Maeterlinck's play of the same name. Leblanc was originally slated to perform the role of M√©lisande in the opera's 1902 premiere, but she was replaced by Mary Garden. This angered Maeterlinck, who threatened legal action and physical violence against Debussy for ousting his lover from the part. She did, however, originate the title role in the world premiere of Paul Dukas's operatic adaptation of Maeterlinck's Ariane et Barbe- bleue in 1907, having already portrayed Ariane in the original stage play in 1899 in Paris. Mary Magdalene (1910) In 1906, Leblanc and Maeterlinck moved to a villa in Grasse where their relationship began to experience difficulties. Maeterlinck became increasingly depressed and was eventually diagnosed with neurasthenia. He did however write several plays during this time, two of which, Marie-Victoire (1907) and Mary Magdalene (1910), had leading roles for Leblanc. In 1912-13, she sang at both the Manhattan Opera House in New York and at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo. She finally got to sing M√©lisande in 1912 in its premiere in Boston with the Boston Opera Company, where she acted the part in the play and recorded four songs with Columbia Records. In 1914, Leblanc and Maeterlinck left Grasse for a villa near Nice and the following year Leblanc portrayed the role of Lady Macbeth in a French film adaptation of William Shakespear's Macbeth. The couple stayed together four more years, but the relationship ended in 1918 when it became clear that he was involved with another woman, the actress Ren√©e Dahon.Knapp, pp. 129, 147-50. Georgette Leblanc, 1921 After her relationship with Maeterlinck ended, Leblanc remained active on the stage within his plays throughout the 1920s, although her singing career was pretty much over. She had a number of romantic relationships with high profile individuals during the 1920s and 1930s. For a brief time she was involved with Greco-Armenian mystic G. I. Gurdjieff. She was also a close friend of fellow Gurdjieff student Margaret Anderson. She continued to be popular among the Parisian artistic social circles and was notably friends with Jean Cocteau and Marcel L'Herbier, in whose film L'Inhumaine (1924) she starred.Griffin, Gabriele. Who's Who in Lesbian and Gay Writing. Routledge, 2002. In 1930, Leblanc published Souvenirs (1895‚Äì1918), an account of her liaison with Maeterlinck. She also authored a further autobiography and several children's books and travelogues. She died at Cannes, Alpes-Maritimes in 1941 and was buried in the Notre Dame des Anges Cemetery beside Margaret Anderson.

She performed a wide variety of classical and popular works from opera to musical theatre, jazz, and popular songs. She sang on a number of radio programs during her career, including The American Album of Familiar Music, The American Melody Hour, and The Standard Hour among others. A particularly important triumph for her radio career was a 1943 radio concert of Brahms‚Äôs Deutsches Requiem with conductor Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. In addition to her radio career, Della Chiesa performed actively on the opera stage, mostly at the Chicago City Opera Company and the Chicago Opera Company, during the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1950s, she became a successful nightclub singer, headlining at major clubs in Las Vegas, Reno, and in major venues in other cities throughout the United States. After her singing career ended she worked as a voice teacher and a fundraiser for charity. Early life and education Della Chiesa was born into an Italian family in Chicago.

It is an annotated, open access database originally developed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in collaboration with Janelia Farm, and currently hosted at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Rfam is designed to be similar to the Pfam database for annotating protein families. Unlike proteins, ncRNAs often have similar secondary structure without sharing much similarity in the primary sequence. Rfam divides ncRNAs into families based on evolution from a common ancestor. Producing multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of these families can provide insight into their structure and function, similar to the case of protein families. These MSAs become more useful with the addition of secondary structure information. Rfam researchers also contribute to Wikipedia's RNA WikiProject.  Uses  The Rfam database can be used for a variety of functions. For each ncRNA family, the interface allows users to: view and download multiple sequence alignments; read annotation; and examine species distribution of family members. There are also links provided to literature references and other RNA databases. Rfam also provides links to Wikipedia so that entries can be created or edited by users. The interface at the Rfam website allows users to search ncRNAs by keyword, family name, or genome as well as to search by ncRNA sequence or EMBL accession number. The database information is also available for download, installation and use using the INFERNAL software package. The INFERNAL package can also be used with Rfam to annotate sequences (including complete genomes) for homologues to known ncRNAs.  Methods  A theoretical ncRNA alignment from 6 species. Secondary structure base pairs are coloured in blocks and identified in the secondary structure consensus sequence (bottom line) by the < and > symbols. In the database, the information of the secondary structure and the primary sequence, represented by the MSA, is combined in statistical models called profile stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), also known as covariance models. These are analogous to hidden Markov models used for protein family annotation in the Pfam database. Each family in the database is represented by two multiple sequence alignments in Stockholm format and a SCFG. The first MSA is the \\"seed\\" alignment. It is a hand-curated alignment that contains representative members of the ncRNA family and is annotated with structural information. This seed alignment is used to create the SCFG, which is used with the Rfam software INFERNAL to identify additional family members and add them to the alignment. A family-specific threshold value is chosen to avoid false positives. Until release 12, Rfam used an initial BLAST filtering step because profile SCFGs were too computationally expensive. However, the latest versions of INFERNAL are fast enough so that the BLAST step is no longer necessary. The second MSA is the ‚Äúfull‚Äù alignment, and is created as a result of a search using the covariance model against the sequence database. All detected homologs are aligned to the model, giving the automatically produced full alignment.  History  Version 1.0 of Rfam was launched in 2003 and contained 25 ncRNA families and annotated about 50 000 ncRNA genes. In 2005, version 6.1 was released and contained 379 families annotating over 280 000 genes. In August 2012, version 11.0 contained 2208 RNA families, while the current version (14.1) annotates 3016 families.  Problems  #The genomes of higher eukaryotes contain many ncRNA-derived pseudogenes and repeats. Distinguishing these non-functional copies from functional ncRNA is a formidable challenge. #Introns are not modeled by covariance models.

As of 2007, the organization had 40,000 members, including 15,000 in Canada, and was present in 26 countries. Since 2010 the Society refers to Taoist Tai Chi as Taoist Tai Chi internal arts of health. Society aims and objectives The International Taoist Tai Chi Society has four stated aims and objectives: * To make Taoist Tai Chi internal arts of health available to all. * To promote the health- improving qualities of Taoist Tai Chi internal arts. * To promote cultural exchange (specifically: ...to make the richness of Chinese culture more accessible...). * To help others.  History  The Taoist Tai Chi Society was founded by Moy Lin-shin (Ê¢ÖÈÄ£Áæ® m√©i li√°n xi√†n). He arrived in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1970 and started teaching Tai Chi and related internal arts. The primary style Moy taught was a T'ai chi ch'uan (Â§™Ê•µÊã≥ t√†ij√≠ qu√°n) form. He also taught a Lok Hup Ba Fa (ÂÖ≠ÂêàÂÖ´Ê≥ïÊã≥ li√π h√© bƒÅ f«é qu√°n) form. Moy modified the orthodox Yang-style tai chi chuan form that he knew, in order to maximize the health benefits obtainable from the form. Over the years Moy trained many of his students to become instructors/teachers of this art of health. On a 42-hectare rural property near Orangeville, Ontario, the Society has built its residential Health Recovery Centre and Quiet Cultivation Centre, where members from around the world can gather and train together. The Quiet Cultivation Centre includes a large temple of Chinese-inspired design dedicated to Confucian, Buddhist and Taoist teachings, which was opened on 2007-09-08 with the participation of some 2500 members. The construction was funded entirely by donations.  Instruction  Classes are taught by volunteer instructors accredited by the Society. In order to become a volunteer instructor one has to express the desire to do so, and be able to show the elements of the form to new students. A teacher of Taoist Tai Chi is encouraged to live by what Moy called \\"Eight Heavenly Virtues\\": * Filial piety * Sibling Harmony * Dedication * Trustworthiness * Propriety * Sacrifice * Honor * Sense of Shame These principles are rooted in traditional Chinese Confucian ethics. Much of the corporate model is likewise reflected in Confucianism. The society also draws influences from the Buddhist philosophy of non attachment generally, but compassion specifically as part of the aims and objectives of the society. Moy's stated goal for Taoist Tai Chi was to help people regain their health and to provide a method for cultivation of the whole body and mind. Moy encouraged his students to engage with both traditional Eastern perspectives on health and energetic development (for example the three Taoist treasures of jing, chi and shen) as well as modern Western medical perspectives. As a Taoist meditative practice of 'dual cultivation of mind and body', Moy also considered that Taoist Tai Chi arts of health would lead practitioners towards \\"taming the heart\\" i.e. developing an attitude of calm and compassion when dealing with stress and the activities of daily life. In the Taoist tradition such a training path is referred to as ‚Äúcultivating both inner nature and life\\" (xing ming shuang xiu). A healthy body is considered to be one where the internal organs are interacting in a balanced and harmonious manner. Negative emotions, cravings and selfish desires can disturb this harmony.  Celebration  Taoist Tai Chi Awareness Days have been proclaimed by municipal governments across Canada since the 1980s to acknowledge that \\"the slow and graceful movements of Tai Chi relax and strengthen the body and mind, help to relieve stress, develop flexibility and coordination which is particularly beneficial to seniors and others in combating a variety of health conditions and disabilities\\". These proclaimed days also serve to acknowledge that \\"members of the Taoist Tai Chi Society contribute many hours of service to our community, conducting fund-raising campaigns and events that have benefited many charitable organizations and other worthy causes,\\"  Corporate information  In order to coordinate the initiatives that Moy Lin-shin undertook, together with the increasing number of people that he trained over time, and their activities, a formal organization was necessary. In the early seventies the organization was called the Toronto Tai Chi Association. In 1982 it was renamed and incorporated as the Taoist Tai Chi Society of Canada. After expansion into the United States, and later into Europe, New Zealand and Australia the International Taoist Tai Chi Society was formally incorporated in 1995. Member associations are incorporated as non-profit organizations in their own countries and many are also registered as charitable organizations. For example, the Taoist Tai Chi Society of Canada is registered as a charitable organization in Canada. and the Taoist Tai Chi Society of the USA is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, charitable organization in the United States. Since the death of Moy Lin-shin in 1998 the Taoist Tai Chi Society of Canada and the Fung Loy Kok Institute of Taoism (ÈÅìÊïôËì¨ËêäÈñ£ or Fung Loy Pavilion Taoism) continue to operate as separate charitable organizations within Canada, under the umbrella of the International Taoist Tai Chi Society. As of 2012 the corporate structure has changed with the Fung Loy Kok Institute of Taoism as the central organisation internationally. The international centre at Orangeville is also the property of the Fung Loy Kok Institute of Taoism (ÈÅìÊïôËì¨ËêäÈñ£) and Taoist Tai Chi and other practices as demonstrated by Moy Lin-Shin come under the Fung Loy Kok umbrella. Fung Loy Kok Taoist Tai Chi (Ëì¨ËêäÈñ£ÈÅìÂÆ∂Â§™Ê•µÊã≥) is becoming more frequently used as a term within the society to be able to familiarise members with the merger.

It is the third and final novel in the Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman trilogy, a series of novels examining Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice from the perspective of Fitzwilliam Darcy, the central male character of that novel. The title uses the words of the First Epistle to the Corinthians, as rendered in the New International Version of the Bible, (1 Corinthians 13): \\"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love\\". Plot The novel is set in the later chapters of Pride and Prejudice. After a series of unpleasant experiences while visiting Norwycke Castle (as depicted in the previous novel in the sequence) Fitzwilliam Darcy accompanies his cousin, Colonel Richard Fitzwilliam, to the home of their aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Although not looking forward to spending time with his self- impressed aunt, Darcy has resolved to use the time to forget what he views as his unacceptable desire for Elizabeth Bennet. Much to his surprise and chagrin, however, she is also in the area visiting her cousin, the pompous clergyman Mr Collins and his new wife (and her close friend) Charlotte, who are frequent visitors to Lady Catherine. Darcy is therefore thrown daily into Elizabeth's company, and finds himself unable to further resist her charms. Driven to jealousy by the developing friendship between Elizabeth and Colonel Fitzwilliam, Darcy finally accepts the strength of his love for her and, after weighing the consideration of her lowly social standing and its possible effect on his future status, decides to propose marriage to her. Much to Darcy's shock and anger, however, his proposal is rejected; not only is Elizabeth greatly insulted by Darcy's high-handed manner of proposal, but she has also heard from Colonel Fitzwilliam of Darcy's role in persuading his friend Charles Bingley to break his ties with Jane Bennet, Elizabeth's sister, who is in love with Bingley. Furthermore, she has been poisoned towards him by slanderous lies spread by Darcy's nemesis, George Wickham, and is convinced that Darcy is \\"the last man in the world whom [she] could ever be prevailed upon to marry\\". Heartbroken by Elizabeth's refusal and stunned by the depth of her dislike towards him, Darcy decides to put Elizabeth behind him and leaves Rosings, but not before writing her a letter explaining the true history between himself, Wickham, and his sister Georgiana, and attempting to justify his actions regarding Bingley and Jane Bennet. Upon his return to London, however, Darcy begins acting in an increasingly uncharacteristic and erratic fashion towards his friends and Georgiana, culminating in his unwise acceptance of an invitation to a party held by Lady Sylvanie Monmouth, who attempted to seduce him at Norwycke Castle. She holds Darcy responsible for the death of her mother during those events. He is rescued from calamity by his good friend Lord Dyfed Brougham, a seemingly foppish aristocrat who in actually is a government agent. Brougham is investigating Sylvanie, who has links to Irish revolutionaries and intends to drug Darcy and then blackmail him into funding their operations. No longer trusting his own judgement, Darcy proceeds to get drunk in a nearby tavern before confessing the entire matter and his relationship with Elizabeth to Brougham. Brougham sympathizes with him but nevertheless criticises Darcy's manner towards Elizabeth. The next morning, Darcy realizes the truth of Brougham's criticisms and is mortified by his own arrogance and pride, resolving to improve himself. He confesses the matter to Georgiana and begins to act in a less arrogant, aloof fashion to those around him. Soon after, Darcy returns to his estate of Pemberley, and is astonished to find himself once more in the company of Elizabeth, who is on a tour of Derbyshire with her aunt and uncle, the Gardiners. After a chance encounter with Elizabeth, Darcy realises that her behaviour towards him is much warmer than their last meeting, while still guarded. Eager to show that he has taken her criticisms of his character on board and is mending his ways, Darcy makes a sincere effort to make her and her relatives feel comfortable and welcome. He soon finds that he genuinely likes Mr and Mrs Gardiner, and is delighted when, upon introducing Georgiana to Elizabeth, the two women take an instant liking to each other. Just as Darcy believes their relationship is thawing, however, Elizabeth receives news from home that her younger sister, Lydia, has eloped with none other than George Wickham, who is fleeing gambling debts accumulated with the other officers in his militia unit. Determined to help Elizabeth in any possible way, Darcy returns to London and, unknown to either the Bennets or the Gardiners, uses Dyfed Brougham's contacts in the London demimonde to quickly find Wickham and Lydia. After failing to persuade Lydia to leave Wickham, Darcy proceeds to blackmail and bribe Wickham into marrying her, assuring Wickham's future good conduct by buying his many debts. This carries the implicit threat that Darcy will have Wickham sent to debtors' prison if he misbehaves. Darcy also purchases for him a commission in an obscure army regiment whose home barracks are in Newcastle upon Tyne, over two hundred miles from Lydia's family. Wickham is forced to agree, and after Darcy has approached the Gardiners with this plan (on the condition that his own role in the affair be kept secret), Wickham and Lydia are married. Soon after, Bingley decides to return to his estate at Netherfield, to which he invites Darcy; upon seeing Jane Bennet and Bingley reunited, Darcy guiltily confesses his role in keeping the two separate. Bingley is angry, but quickly forgives Darcy; after straightening out the misunderstanding, Bingley and Jane are soon engaged. After hearing a false report that Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy are also to be married, an outraged Lady Catherine arrives at Darcy's London home having attempted to bully Elizabeth into promising to never enter into an engagement with Darcy. Darcy is elated when he learns that Elizabeth refused, realizing that her feelings towards him might have changed, and he returns to Netherfield. Once again, Darcy proposes to Elizabeth; this time she happily accepts, and the two are married. Relationship to Pride and Prejudice These Three Remain quite closely follows the plot of the last chapters of Austen's novel, primarily because Elizabeth Bennet is once again in the picture. Unique to this book are its vivid glimpses of Regency London's high society, underworld, and political scene. Some compelling characters are new creations (Lady Monmouth and Lord Brougham, for example), while others (like Colonel Fitzwilliam and Anne de Bourgh) are given much more color and depth. Anne de Bourgh reveals herself to be a budding writer of novels and not at all interested in becoming mistress of a great country house, as Lady Catherine intends. In doing so, she relieves Darcy of any obligation to consider marriage to her, allowing him to propose to Elizabeth. References to historical people, places and events The author chose to set the novels in the trilogy in a definite historical time, namely late 1811 to late 1812. Letters between characters are dated appropriately. Contemporary events are referenced, and in some cases have a significant effect on the plot. At Lady Sylvanie's house Darcy is questioned by a man whom Lady Sylvanie addresses as \\"Bellingham\\", and who is a fervent supporter of the cause of Irish independence from Britain. Later in the novel Dy Brougham is unable to directly help Darcy locate Wickham as he is involved in the investigation of the assassination of Spencer Perceval, the then Prime Minister. The actual event involved a man named John Bellingham. However the real-life Bellingham was carrying out a grudge that had nothing to do with Ireland. There are also references to the War of 1812 where the United States of America attacked Canada, provoking a British response that included an attack on the US capital. One character mentions that Darcy is trading with the US even though the two countries are at war. Dy Brougham re-appears late in the novel having been on a secret mission to America.

The term \\"P\\" refers to (a)(15)(P), Section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. P visa classifications are as follows: *P-1 applies to individual or team athletes, or members of an entertainment group (P-1B) that are internationally recognized. A maximum of 25,000 P visas are issued annually. *P-2 applies to artists or entertainers who will perform under a reciprocal exchange program. *P-3 applies to artists or entertainers who perform under a program that is culturally unique. *P-4 is for the spouse, or child under the age of 21, of a P-1, P-2, or P-3 alien and who is accompanying, or following to join, the alien. A sports team can file petition for its foreign athlete and for a P-1 visa to be granted to the team it must have achieved \\"international recognition\\" in the sport. An athlete who will come to the United States to compete in individual events rather than as a team must show that he or she is internationally recognized. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has defined \\"international recognition\\" as \\"having a high level of achievement in a field evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition substantially above that ordinarily encountered, to the extent that such achievement is renowned, leading, or well-known in more than one country.\\" The event the athlete is coming to the United States to participate in must have a distinguished reputation and must require the participation of athletes and teams of international recognition. The definition is similar to that of O-1B \\"extraordinary ability,\\" but somewhat more stringent. The reputation of the group, not the individual achievements of its members nor the acclaim of a particular production, is paramount. Entertainers must be part of an entertainment group to obtain a P-1 visa. Individual artists cannot usually obtain a P-1 visa, except when joining the rest of their foreign entertainment group already in the United States. Like athletes, entertainers must be \\"internationally recognized\\" as outstanding in their area to be granted P visas, and have a sustained period of achievement no less than one year. Additionally, a minimum for 75 percent of the group's individual members must have a substantial relationship to the group, generally satisfied by at least one year of membership. To establish \\"international recognition,\\" a petitioner may rely either on documentation of a major, one-time achievement by the group, such as the nomination for, or receipt of, a significant international award or prize, or at least three of the following: *Has and will perform as leading/starring group in productions/events with distinguished reputations; *International recognition/acclaim for outstanding achievements; *Has and will perform as leading/starring group for organizations with distinguished reputations; *Record of major commercial/critically acclaimed success; *Significant recognition from organizations, critics, governments, other recognized experts; *Commanded/will command high salary/other substantial remuneration relative to others similarly situated.

He served briefly as the chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard from November 2010 until his firing in September 2011. He also served as co- chief executive officer of SAP from April 2008 until he resigned in February 2010 following a decision by that company not to renew his contract.http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/sap-founder-hasso- plattner-it-was-a-shock-that-something-like-this-could-happen-a-677851.html During his tenure as chief executive at HP, the company lost more than $30 billion in market capitalization after a series of strategic missteps by the company, leading to his resignation. At SAP, which he joined in 1988 and where he spent more than twenty years, he played an instrumental role in developing and implementing a number of significant changes. Apotheker currently sits on the board of KMD, Schneider Electric SA, Steria, and PlaNet Finance - a non- profit organization. He previously served on the Board of Directors of GT Nexus. Apotheker is fluent in five languages‚ÄîGerman, Dutch, French, English and Hebrew. Early life and education Apotheker's parents were Polish Jews who fled to the Soviet-Chinese border after the Nazis invaded Poland at the outbreak of World War II. After the war, they settled in Aachen, Germany, where L√©o Apotheker was born on September 18, 1953. He later moved to Antwerp, Belgium. By his own account, he organized a student strike in high school, and had two of his teeth knocked out by a policeman on horseback in the melee that followed. At the age of 18 he moved to Israel where he studied economics at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Career =Early career and SAP: 1988‚Äì2010= Prior to joining SAP in 1988, Apotheker held several financial and operations positions at European companies. After joining SAP, he held positions of increasing responsibility; and in 1995 was promoted to CEO and founder of SAP France and SAP Belgium. Later in 1997, he became the president of SAP's South West Europe region; and by 1999, president of SAP EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) sales region. He joined the SAP AG executive board in 2002, and served as the president of global customer solutions and operations from 2002 to 2007. He was appointed deputy CEO in 2007; and promoted to co-CEO of the company in April 2008 to ensure a smooth handover from his predecessor, Henning Kagermann, when the latter's contract with the company expired. The succession plan was communicated in the business media early in 2008, including Forbes magazine. The transition received praise as an example of SAP's corporate culture, \\"a seemingly contradictory mix of internal consensus and competition\\". Apotheker's appointment to lead SAP was the second occasion, after 1997 Ron Sommer's appointment as CEO of Deutsche Telekom, that a large German company was run by a Jewish executive whose parents escaped the Holocaust. ‚ÄúIf SAP had a pre-war history, I would never have joined the company,‚Äù he told The Economist.The Economist (December 30 2008). Apotheker took an early opportunity to set out his vision for the IT industry, and explained enterprise software in layman's terms (likening it to the human nervous system), in an interview with prominent American journalist Charlie Rose.Charlie Rose Show (January 6 2009) . He also articulated SAP's commitment to sustainability.VNUnet.com (November 11 2008). On February 7, 2010, the SAP supervisory board reached an agreement with Apotheker not to extend his contract as a member of the SAP executive board. With this decision, he stepped down as CEO and resigned from SAP. =Hewlett-Packard: 2010‚Äì2011= On September 30, 2010, the Board of Directors of Hewlett-Packard announced the election of Apotheker as the company's Chief Executive Officer and President, effective November 1.https://web.archive.org/web/20101004140440/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/leo- apotheker-named-ceo-and-president-of-hp-2010-09-30 He succeeded Cathie Lesjak, who served as the company's interim CEO since August 6, following the abrupt departure of former CEO Mark Hurd. Hurd had been forced to resign after an internal investigation into a sexual harassment claim (that found him not guilty) uncovered expense-account irregularities. During Apotheker's tenure at HP the stock dropped about 40%. It dropped nearly 25% on 19 August 2011, after HP announced a number of seemingly abrupt strategic decisions: to discontinue its webOS device business (mobile phones and tablet computers), to begin planning to divest its personal computer division, and to acquire British software firm Autonomy for a significant premium. Over the months following Apotheker's departure, HP eventually spun off the remaining webOS assets into a new subsidiary, Gram; backtracked on any plans to spin-off its personal computer division; and wrote-down almost $9 billion related to the Autonomy acquisition, which it indicated was due to a lack of due diligence during the acquisition process under Apotheker. On September 22, 2011, the HP Board of Directors replaced Apotheker as chief executive, effective immediately, with fellow board member and former eBay chief Meg Whitman. Though Apotheker served barely ten months, he received over $13 million in compensation: a severance payment of $7.2 million, shares worth $3.56 million, and a performance bonus of $2.4 million,New Hewlett-Packard chief Meg Whitman gets $1 salary, Leo Apotheker gets $13m, The Australian, sept. 30 2011 although the company lost more than $30 billion in market capitalization during his tenure. =After HP: 2011 to present= After HP, Apotheker returned to Paris.

Characters in this section range from homeless drug addicts up to drug king-pins in charge of entire criminal empires. Barksdale organization =Omar's crew= Stanfield organization New Day Co-Op West Side =Avon Barksdale= Avon Barksdale was the head of the Barksdale organization in season one. He comes from the projects, lives in the projects and plans to stay in the projects. For most of season 1 he is the target of a homicide detective Jimmy McNulty who seems to be the only authoritative figure aware of his presence or his empire that spans the most sought after territory in Baltimore for drug dealers. Avon is uniformly feared by all other drug dealing criminal organizations in Baltimore due to his ferocity but due to his 'West Side' mentality is no threat to 'East Side' gangs. Together with his closest friend Russell \\"Stringer\\" Bell, Avon and their enforcers hold a monopoly on the drug trade in West Baltimore through intimidation and murder. =Russell \\"Stringer\\" Bell= Stringer was Avon Barksdale's second-in-command, closest friend, advisor and the main strategist behind coordinating their street dealing organization which he does as the main contact for all business, while he attends a business college in relation to his aspiration as a clean businessman. Together, they operate out of a strip club which is a front for money laundering owned and licensed under a clean member of their gang. Stringer is portrayed as more humble and quiet than Avon but is every bit as ruthless as his friend. He has aspirations to eventually leave the streets and drug life as a whole behind him despite his close and long relationship with Avon. In the third season Bell is killed by Omar and Brother Mouzone in his own commercial building that was in development at the time. =D'Angelo Barksdale= D'Angelo Barksdale was Avon's nephew and a lieutenant in his drug dealing organization. He was mainly responsible for leading the corner boys in their street dealings and coordinating their earnings and performance. He was the main connection between the upper levels of the crew and the street kids that were selling the product. He struggles with the morality behind his trade and came close to informing on the crew because of it, only relenting because of loyalty to family ties his mother reminded him of before signing. He took the sentence and went to prison where he was killed by a hitman sent by Stringer Bell in season 2. =Bodie= Bodie was a dealer who came of age working for Avon Barksdale. After the Barksdale organization dissolves, he is briefly independent (supplied by the New Day Co-Op) until Marlo forces him to join his crew. He is shot in the head by O-dog with Snoop and Chris providing a distraction after being seen having a conversation with McNulty, because Marlo suspects he may be a snitch. =Poot Carr= Poot is a loyal drug dealer for the Barksdale organization, who serves brief prison time for his crimes. By the end of the series he is working at a shoe store attempting to distance himself from the game after growing tired of it and reeling from the loss of many friends. =Marlo Stanfield= Stanfield is a rising gang leader who gets into a turf war with the Barksdale Organization, becoming the key West Baltimore drug kingpin following Stringer Bell's death and Avon Barksdale's arrest. Stanfield is played by Jamie Hector. =Chris Partlow= Partlow is Marlo Stanfield's second-in-command and best friend in his drug dealing operation. He is played by Gbenga Akinnagbe. =Monk Metcalf= Monk is a lieutenant in the Stanfield organization, and the third most recognized leader of the Stanfield Organization. =Felicia \\"Snoop\\" Pearson= Snoop is a chief enforcer in the Stanfield Organization, she is a mid-way gangster and she is always seen with Chris Partlow. =Fruit= *Played by: Brandon Fobbs *Appears in: :Season three: \\"Time after Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\". Fruit is a prominent crew chief of one of Marlo Stanfield's drug dealing crews, and works closely with Jamal and Justin. Fruit is identifiable by his ever-present Kangol hat, and is the chief for one of West Baltimore's most prominent street corners. He is first seen negotiating with Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise over how to distribute a package of dope; he seems to be fair, but he later rips Cutty off, saying the package was taken by the police. Cutty protests, but Fruit pulls a gun on him and forces Cutty to withdraw. Later in the season, his crew's territory is encroached upon by Bodie Broadus and his crew, which sparks the turf war with the Barksdale organization. Fruit is pressured by Marlo to force the Barksdale Organization away, and Fruit responds by gathering his muscle and beating most of the crew into submission with baseball bats. Cutty, now working for the Barksdale organization, takes part in the subsequent retaliation strike against Fruit's corner. Slim Charles kills one of Fruit's dealers, but Fruit escapes death because Cutty is unable to bring himself to kill again. In \\"Boys of Summer\\", the season four premiere, Lex, the father of Patrice's child, watches Fruit and Patrice entering a nightclub. On leaving,they walk through the parking lot. Lex kills Fruit with a single gun shot to the head. He shows no regret for his action. To Patrice's horror, he simply asks, Sup Patrice? but Fruit's death results in Marlo ordering an immediate retaliation hit on Lex. East Side =\\"Proposition Joe\\" Stewart= Joseph \\"Proposition Joe\\" Stewart is an Eastside drug kingpin who supplies much of Baltimore through his direct connection to The Greek's smuggling organization. He is murdered and replaced as leader of New Day Co-op by Marlo Stanfield. =Melvin \\"Cheese\\" Wagstaff= Cheese is the nephew of Proposition Joe and a crew chief in his Eastside drug crew. He is murdered by Slim Charles in the final episode as retribution for his role in Joe‚Äôs death. Although never revealed in the series, Cheese is Randy Wagstaff's father. Originally, his first name was listed as \\"Calvin\\" on the official HBO site, but it was later changed to \\"Melvin\\". The character is played by rapper Method Man. =Frog= *Played by: Gary \\"D.Reign\\" *Appears in season two: \\"Undertow\\"; \\"Backwash\\" and \\"Port in a Storm\\" (uncredited). season five: \\"-30-\\" (uncredited) Frog is a white street-level dealer from Greektown, Baltimore who was raised on Rapolla Street just like Nick. He was raised by a single mother and used to attend St. Casimir Church, Baltimore. His allegiances are never made clear, though from the photo on the crime board in Season 2 he is shown with Petey Dixon. He is seen early in season two distributing a package for Ziggy Sobotka (and stealing from him in the process), and later negotiates with Nick Sobotka, who first admonishes him for being a wigga, to distribute another. During the early stages of season two's investigation, he sells heroin to Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk and is photographed by Kima Greggs and Ellis Carver. He can also be seen for a split second in the series finale during the closing montage. =Nick Sobotka= Louis and Joan's son and Frank's nephew, Nick is a well-liked young stevedore with extensive family connections to the Baltimore port and links to the criminal underworld. =Ziggy Sobotka= Ziggy is Frank's son, an impulsive and often reckless young checker, loosely based on Pinkie Bannion, a real life docker in the Baltimore area, at the docks with a desire to prove himself and a respected father to live up to. =\\"White\\" Mike McArdle= *Played by: Brook Yeaton *Appears in season two: \\"Collateral Damage\\"; \\"Stray Rounds\\" (uncredited); \\"Bad Dreams\\" and \\"Port in a Storm\\" (Uncredited). White Mike is a mid-level South Baltimore drug dealer from Curtis Bay with his own territory. He supplied Ziggy Sobotka with packages of narcotics to distribute but their relationship soured when Ziggy failed to make adequate profit from the package. He is one of several characters in The Wire who are fond of strawberry soda. McArdle was supplied by The Greek's smuggling operation and was arrested as part of an investigation into that operation. He was quick to turn against his suppliers and gave up all the information he had. McNulty's last name was originally McArdle, according to a draft of the pilot script. Brook Yeaton is also credited as an assistant set dresser and set dressing buyer for the show.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0947092/ =Fat Face Rick= *Played by: Troj Marquis Strickland *Appears in: :Season three: \\"Straight and True\\" (uncredited); \\"Slapstick\\"; \\"Reformation\\" :Season four: \\"Home Rooms\\" (uncredited); \\"Final Grades\\" :Season five: \\"More with Less\\"; \\"Transitions\\"; \\"The Dickensian Aspect\\"; and \\"‚Äì30‚Äì.\\" Ricardo \\"Fat Face Rick\\" Hendrix is a drug kingpin from Baltimore's Veronica Avenue, on the East Side. He is typically seen smoking (sometimes a cigar, sometimes a cigarette), and is among the first to join the New Day Co-Op. He is a dissenting voice in the Co-Op for Stringer Bell when Avon Barksdale is warring with Marlo Stanfield. Rick and Phil Boy assist Proposition Joe when he gives Bell the ultimatum, to either end the war with Stanfield or lose access to the high-quality heroin. Later, he is the first to bring up the idea that West Sider Marlo Stanfield should work with the Co-Op against the encroachment from New York dealers. In season four, episode 11 (\\"A New Day\\"), Omar and Renaldo are spying on the New-Day Co- Op and briefly discuss a time when they robbed Fat Face Rick, who \\"fell down on his knees, wept like a little baby.\\" At the end of the fourth season, Rick leads the quorum confronting Joe, after Omar has stolen the shipment. In the fifth season Rick's full name is revealed as Ricardo Hendrix when The Baltimore Sun runs a story exposing a corrupt property deal. Rick owns a strip club named Desperado and the council wants to relocate him to redevelop the land. However, they are offering to pay Hendrix more than his club is worth and to sell him better council owned property elsewhere so that he will net a million dollars for moving. The paper exposes a history of campaign donations from Rick and people using the address of his club including several to city council president Nerese Campbell who is sponsoring the property deal. Hendrix continues his involvement with the Co-Op and brags in a meeting about his property deal with his friend Hungry Man - drawing the ire of Stanfield. After Stanfield's arrest and sale of the connection to the Greeks, Hendrix, along with Slim Charles, is seen, in the series finale, meeting with Spiros Vondas and The Greek, discussing the new business arrangement for importing the drugs into Baltimore. =Hungry Man= *Played by: Duane Chandler Rawlings *Appears in: :Season four: \\"Home Rooms\\" (uncredited) and \\"Final Grades\\". :Season five: \\"More With Less\\" and \\"Transitions\\". Nathaniel \\"Hungry Man\\" Manns is an older East Side drug kingpin and charter member of the New Day Co-Op. He is at the meeting to discuss encouraging Marlo Stanfield to join the Co-Op to combat the incursion of New York drug dealers into eastern Baltimore. Hungry Man believes that Stanfield is hiding bodies by putting several into individual coffins through a funeral home front until he is corrected by Slim Charles. He is part of the quorum that confronts \\"Proposition Joe\\" Stewart following Omar Little's robbery of the Co-Op. In the fifth season, Baltimore County territory is divided among Eastside kingpins to compensate for territory lost in the gentrification of east Baltimore. Hungry Man is one of the people to benefit from the arrangement. He tells Marlo Stanfield that he is out of line for encouraging Prop Joe to delegate control of the territory to his subordinates. Later Hungry Man airs a grievance with Prop Joe's nephew Cheese because Cheese has been encroaching upon the territory assigned to Hungry Man. Cheese is furious, but Prop Joe promises that Cheese will respect the agreed boundaries. Stanfield observes Cheese storming out of the meeting, and later has his enforcers Chris Partlow and Snoop kidnap Hungry Man and deliver him to Cheese as a gift to encourage Cheese to betray Prop Joe. When Hungry Man's body surfaces, the implication is that Cheese has killed him. =Ghost= *Played by: Mike D. Anderson *Appears in: :Season three: \\"Straight and True\\" (uncredited); \\"Slapstick\\" (uncredited). :Season four: \\"Final Grades\\" (uncredited). :Season five: \\"More With Less\\" (uncredited)\\"Transitions\\" (uncredited) and \\"The Dickensian Aspect\\"(uncredited) Ghost is an East side drug kingpin and Co-Op member. He is part of the quorum that confronts \\"Proposition Joe\\" Stewart following Omar Little's robbery of the Co-Op. In the fifth season Ghost receives Baltimore County territory to compensate for territory lost in the gentrification of East Baltimore. Ghost continues to attend Co-Op meetings throughout the fifth season. =George \\"Double G\\" Glekas= *Played by: Teddy Ca√±ez *Appears in season two: \\"Ebb Tide\\"; \\"Hot Shots\\";\\"Hard Cases\\"; \\"Duck and Cover\\"; \\"Stray Rounds\\" and \\"Storm Warnings\\". George Alexander Glekas (Greek: ŒìŒπœéœÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ ŒëŒªŒ≠ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ ŒìŒªŒµŒ∫Œ±œÇ; February 18, 1960 - 2003) runs a warehouse and appliance store for The Greek under the name Pyramid Industries and acts as the organization's fence. Glekas often gets advice from Spiros \\"Vondas\\" Vondopoulos on important deals. The retail store he owns was used as a front to move their stolen goods from the docks. Prior to appearing in the series Glekas had been charged with fencing stolen goods in San Diego, but the case was dropped for lack of evidence. Glekas was indicted in the smuggling investigation but was not arrested because he was shot and killed by Ziggy Sobotka in a dispute over payment for a stolen car smuggling deal. Ziggy confesses to the murder and was shown serving time for the crime. Others =Bubbles= Bubbles is a heroin addict with a vast knowledge of the streets of Baltimore. He becomes an informant after a friend whom he introduced to the drug lifestyle gets badly beaten when using counterfeit money upon Bubbles' advice. Bubbles volunteers information and creatively points out key figures to the police in exchange for small amounts of cash for him and for his friend's escaping prosecution for a drug-related crime. Bubbles also befriends Kima, and despite their different situations, they share a level of mutual respect and empathy. =Brother Mouzone= Brother Mouzone, meaning \\"judicious\\" in Arabic, is a drug enforcer and hitman from New York City. \\"The Brother\\" does not fit the usual picture of drug-trade \\"muscle\\", always wearing a suit, bowtie, and glasses, speaking politely and precisely. He is also quite erudite, reading magazines such as The Economist, Harper's, The Atlantic, The New Republic, and The Nation. His dress, along with an extremely proper and pious persona is a manner typically associated with the Nation of Islam, more particularly its paramilitary wing, the Fruit of Islam, although it is never explicitly stated that he belongs to either organization. On first encountering Mouzone, the street dealer Cheese mocked his formal style of dress by remarking that he must either be in \\"the Nation\\", or he still lets his mother pick out his clothes. He reveals himself as a Muslim by mouthing \\"Allahu akbar\\" repeatedly after Omar shoots him and he believes he is about to die. He is always accompanied by his \\"man\\" Lamar, who runs errands for Mouzone. =The Deacon = *Played by: Melvin Williams *Appears in :Season three: \\"All Due Respect\\", \\"Straight and True\\", \\"Back Burners\\", \\"Moral Midgetry\\", \\"Slapstick\\", \\"Reformation\\", :Season four: \\"Home Rooms\\", \\"Refugees\\", \\"Margin of Error\\", \\"That's Got His Own\\". :Season five: \\"Late Editions\\" The Deacon is a West Side church figure who is involved in many community projects. He also has many contacts within the city‚Äôs academic population. He is a friend of teacher Grace Sampson and helps her ex-boyfriend Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise when he is released after a long prison sentence. Initially he tries to encourage Cutty to enroll in a GED program, but Cutty is not interested in this idea. The deacon then helps Cutty to open a community boxing gym. He puts Cutty in touch with State Delegate Odell Watkins through the politically influential Reverend Frank Reid to help with obtaining the necessary permits for the gym. He also helps Cutty to get a paying job working as a school custodian at Edward Tilghman Middle, where Grace teaches the eighth grade. The Deacon is also friends with Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin. When Colvin was Western District police commander the Deacon often served as his conscience. Colvin started three drug tolerant zones in his district and the deacon was dismayed at the poor conditions addicts faced in these areas and convinced Colvin to involve public health academics in providing services for the addicts now he had gathered them into an easy to reach area. Colvin was forced to retire because of his actions and the deacon found him a new job working with a sociologist in studying the prevention of repeat violent offender behavior. In his youth Melvin Williams, the actor who plays the Deacon, was a real-life drug kingpin who was arrested by series writer Ed Burns in 1984 when the latter was a Baltimore city police officer. Creator David Simon was responsible for covering the arrest for The Baltimore Sun at the time. Williams received a 34-year sentence for his crimes and much of the evidence against him came from a wiretap investigation like the one featured in the first season of the show. =Dee-Dee= *Played by: Genevieve Hudson- Price *Appears in :Season three: \\"Moral Midgetry\\" :Season four: \\"Corner Boys\\" :Season five: \\"Unconfirmed Reports\\" Dee-Dee is a drug addict. In Season Three she shows up in the Hamsterdam area buying an eight-ball of cocaine from a car. A year later she is living in West Baltimore and working as a prostitute. Fifteen months later again she is seen at a narcotics anonymous meeting. She is played by Genevieve Hudson-Price, the daughter of author Richard Price, who writes for the show. =Hucklebuck= *Played by: Gil Deeble *Appears in: :Season one: \\"The Wire\\" :Season two: \\"Stray Rounds\\" (uncredited) :Season three: \\"Middle Ground\\" (uncredited) :Season five: \\"More with Less\\" Hucklebuck is a drug addict and friend to Bubbles and Johnny. He often assists them on their \\"capers\\" to make money for drugs. He is a part of Johnny's copper house robbery scam in season 1. Hucklebuck continues to live on the street when Bubbles is in recovery in season 5. =Lamar= *Played by: DeAndre McCullough *Appears in: :Season two: \\"Storm Warnings\\" (uncredited); \\"Bad Dreams\\" (uncredited) and \\"Port in a Storm\\" (uncredited). :Season three: \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". Lamar is the assistant and inept bodyguard of New York mercenary Brother Mouzone. He has accompanied Mouzone on both his visits to Baltimore. On their first trip they worked at the Franklin Terrace high rises for Avon Barksdale ‚Äì guarding his territory against East Side drug dealers. Lamar failed to protect his charge against Omar Little on this trip. He was distracted by a dog and knocked unconscious by Omar while guarding a motel room door. His failure allowed Omar to enter the room and shoot Brother Mouzone. Brother Mouzone recovered and returned to Baltimore for revenge. He had Lamar seek out Omar in various gay bars, having learned that he was homosexual. Lamar resented the task and his visceral homophobia made him confrontational with those he came across while searching for Omar. Eventually Lamar was approached by Omar‚Äôs boyfriend Dante allowing Mouzone to capture him and find Omar. DeAndre McCullough, the actor who plays Lamar, was profiled in David Simon and Edward Burns's book and television miniseries The Corner. McCullough was found dead on August 1, 2012, in the Woodlawn section of Baltimore County. =Raylene Lee= *Played by: Shamika Cotton *Appears in: :Season four: \\"Refugees\\", \\"Corner Boys\\", \\"Misgivings\\", \\"A New Day\\" (uncredited) and \\"That's Got His Own\\" :Season five: \\"Transitions\\" and \\"The Dickensian Aspect\\" Raylene Lee is Michael Lee and \\"Bug\\"'s mother. She is a drug addict. =Devar Manigault= *Played by: Cyrus Farmer *Appears in: :Season four: \\"Corner Boys\\", \\"Know Your Place\\" and \\"Misgivings\\" Devar Manigault is Raylene Lee's partner and father to her younger son \\"Bug\\". Devar is feared by Michael and it is implied that Michael suffered sexual abuse by Devar. Shortly after Devar is released from prison he is savagely beaten to death by Chris Partlow at Michael's behest. Chris spits on him at the crime scene, leaving his DNA, leading to his arrest for murder. =Squeak= *Played by: Mia Arnice Chambers *Appears in season three: \\"Back Burners\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Slapstick\\"; \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". Squeak is the girlfriend of Bernard, a low level member of the Barksdale organization. Bernard was responsible for supplying the organization with disposable mobile phones and was told to buy no more than two phones at any one outlet and provide receipts for his purchases. Squeak's nagging convinced Bernard to start breaking these rules. Squeak was an old acquaintance of Bubbles and their association allowed the police to use her as an inroad to the Barksdale organization. Bubbles put Squeak and Bernard in touch with Lester Freamon who was a posing as a conman who could provide them with phones at lower price. With Squeak's encouragement, Bernard accepted Freamon's offer and began buying solely from him on the condition that he provide him with receipts. Freamon gave Bernard pre-wiretapped phones that eventually brought down the Barksdale organization. When the investigation was closed with the arrest of Avon Barksdale, Bernard and Squeak were also brought in. Bernard joked that he could not wait to go to jail to get away from Squeak. =Sherrod= Sherrod played by Rashad Orange *Played by: Rashad Orange *Appears in :Season three: \\"All Due Respect\\" (uncredited); \\"Mission Accomplished\\" (uncredited) :Season four: \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Alliances\\"; \\"Unto Others\\"; \\"A New Day\\"; \\"That's Got His Own\\". Sherrod is a young homeless boy who is befriended by Bubbles. He has been living on the streets since his mother succumbed to drug addiction. He last regularly attended school in the fifth grade at Steuart Hill elementary, though Bubbles tried to get him to go back at some point between the third and fourth seasons. As the fourth season starts, Bubbles is selling small items from a shopping cart to get by, and is trying to train Sherrod to run his own business. Sherrod's basic math skills prove to be extremely poor, and Bubbles insists that he return to school. Bubbles visits Edward Tilghman middle school with Sherrod and convinces the Assistant Principal, Marcia Donnelly, to take him in, even though he has been missing from the school system for years. Sherrod only attends class once, when Bubbles forces him to, cutting class instead to go on the corner and deal drugs for \\"Jojo\\". He tries to fake doing homework by bringing books from school back to the squat he shares with Bubbles. It is thus revealed that Sherrod is illiterate as well as innumerate, as he does not know that the two books he is trying to pass off to Bubbles as a textbook and its associated workbook are actually an algebra textbook and a dictionary; Sherrod is completely unaware of his blunder, as he cannot read the titles on the covers. Bubbles, who can read, immediately notices Sherrod's lie and shows disappointment. When Bubbles finds Sherrod dealing on a school day, he tries to talk to him and is attacked by an addict who needs money. Bubbles then tells Sherrod that he cannot stay with him any more unless he returns to school. Sherrod continues to deal drugs and is involved in an assault on Namond Brice when they vie for territory. He also becomes a drug addict. Eventually, he returns to Bubbles, saying he wants to get away but he owes Jojo money. Bubbles offers Sherrod the chance to return home and says he will help with the debt. Bubbles, however, had previously prepared a lethal \\"hot shot\\" of narcotics he intended to use to kill another addict who had repeatedly harassed and assaulted Bubbles. Sherrod finds the vial Bubbles has prepared and takes it himself, dying soon afterwards. =Walon= Walon played by Steve Earle *Played by: Steve Earle *Appears in: :Season one: \\"One Arrest\\", \\"Game Day\\" and \\"The Cost\\". :Season four: \\"Final Grades\\". :Season five: \\"Unconfirmed Reports\\", \\"React Quotes\\", \\"Late Editions\\", and \\"‚Äì30‚Äì\\". Walon is an HIV-positive recovering drug addict. He first appears in season one when Bubbles and Johnny see him speaking at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. Bubbles is moved by the strength Walon conveys in his speech. They see Walon again in the projects looking after his drug addicted nephew. Bubbles' conversations with Walon help him realise that he wants to get clean. When he makes a serious attempt, Walon gives him advice on keeping clean, which Bubbles is unable to stick with. Years later, when Bubbles is locked in a medical rehab facility, Walon visits him to again help him with his sobriety and grief. In season five he acts as Bubbles' sponsor, pushing him to be more open about his struggles and the death of Sherrod. Walon is played by singer/songwriter and recovering heroin addict Steve Earle. Earle also performs the theme song for Season 5, and his track \\"I Feel Alright\\" is featured in the montage at the end of Season 2. =Johnny Weeks= Johnny Weeks, an unfortunate drug addict played by Leo Fitzpatrick *Played by: Leo Fitzpatrick *Appears in: :Season one: \\"The Target\\"; \\"The Pager\\"; \\"The Wire\\"; \\"One Arrest\\"; \\"Game Day\\" and \\"Sentencing\\". :Season two: \\"Hard Cases\\" and \\"Port in a Storm\\". :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Back Burners\\"; \\"Middle Ground\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". In season one Johnny is Bubbles' best friend and a drug addict with notoriously bad luck. He is naive and enthusiastic for \\"the game\\", allowing Bubbles to play the role of teacher. In the pilot episode he is badly beaten by Bodie Broadus, Poot Carr and Wallace after trying to pass counterfeit money to D'Angelo Barksdale's operation. This spurs Bubbles to become a police informant but Johnny disapproves and takes no part in it except when arrested by police. While in the hospital for that beating, Johnny discovers he is HIV positive; he also undergoes a colostomy operation. Unlike Bubbles he shows no interest in giving up his addiction and continues thievery and various other scams with Bubbles, despite carrying a colostomy bag. In the season three finale he dies from an overdose and his body is discovered in a vacant house in the \\"Hamsterdam\\" free zone that Major Colvin had set up. Johnny is based on a young white homeless addict that David Simon met while researching The Corner. This man would follow Simon's subject, drug addict Gary McCullough, around. =Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise= After getting out of prison he joins back up with the Barksdale crew as muscle, but cannot complete a task he was assigned. Instead, he leaves the criminal world and starts up a boxing center in an attempt to reach out to local street youths. He is later wounded trying to talk Michael Lee out of a life of crime. He reappears in Season 5 to briefly train Dukie as well as to give him advice on how to deal with people that give him trouble.

He moved into working with potential repeat violent offenders in the school system. =Marcia Donnelly= Marcia Donnelly played by Tootsie Duvall *Played by: Tootsie Duvall *Appears in :Season 4: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Home Rooms\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Alliances\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\"; \\"Unto Others\\"; \\"Know Your Place\\"; \\"Misgivings\\"; \\"A New Day\\"; \\"That's Got His Own\\" :Season 5: \\"‚Äì30‚Äì\\". Marcia Donnelly is the Assistant Principal of Edward J. Tilghman Middle School. She is a disciplinary, no-nonsense person whom the students have learned to obey. A veteran administrator, Mrs. Donnelly has become used to the chaotic environment of the school, but she often feels frustrated with the difficulty of keeping order among the children and retaining teachers from year to year. Donnelly is world-weary to the point where she sees an in-school stabbing victim being HIV-negative as a silver lining. She performs sweeps of the school grounds looking for concealed weapons on a regular basis. Donnelly employs Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise -- ostensibly as a custodian -- to perform the duties of a truant officer. By forcing truants to attend one day in September and another in October, the school secures more funding. Cutty eventually returns to her to resign the post because he expected to be doing something more rewarding. She works with Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin in setting up an initiative to separate students into two groups to improve discipline. She urges Colvin to protect Principal Withers from the consequences of dividing the students, because he has gone out on a limb to support the initiative. She selects the students for the program with input from her colleague Grace Sampson. Donnelly meets with Bubbles and allows his young assistant Sherrod to enroll in the school. She insists that Sherrod is socially promoted to the eighth grade because of his age. She tells Bubbles that he cannot be allowed to return to the last grade he attended because of the difficulties it would present regarding classroom discipline and funding. She is supportive of impoverished student Duquan \\"Dukie\\" Weems and sends clothes home for him via his classmate Crystal Judkins. Donnelly convinces eighth grade student Randy Wagstaff to become an informant against other students by threatening to call his foster mother when he is caught with a fake hall pass. When Randy is later involved as a lookout in a possible rape on school grounds Donnelly is forced to suspend him. He tells her that he knows about a murder to try and convince her not to call his foster mother and Donnelly is forced to hand him over to the police department. Donnelly has a relationship based on mutual respect with the Principal, Claudell Withers. He allows her to handle the operational aspects of running the school while he deals more with external interests like the education board and the parents. Donnelly tries to protect the school from being taken over by the state by focusing on improving performance in state assessments. She insists on her teachers sticking to core subjects and is against deviations from the curriculum. She tries to guide trainee teacher Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski into following this strategy. =Miss Duquette= *Played by: Stacie Davis *Appears in :Season 4: \\"Unto Others\\"; \\"Corner Boys\\"; \\"Know Your Place\\"; \\"Misgivings; \\"A New Day\\"; \\"That's Got His Own\\"; \\"Final Grades\\" Miss Duquette is a Doctoral student who assists Dr. Parenti and Bunny Colvin in teaching the \\"corner kids\\" special class. A social sciences and psychology student, she uses several psychological techniques to get the children to describe themselves and how they feel about their roles in life. As a rookie teacher from an educated and non-Baltimore City raised background, she is initially disrespected by many of the students especially the classes' two female students Chandra and Zenobia but she eventually manages to manipulate the children into articulating their problems and talk about how or why they should improve themselves. When school officials decide to pull the plug on the program, she assists Colvin and Parenti in protesting the program's end claiming that the students have actually made progress in the class as human beings. The program is nonetheless shut down. =David Parenti= David Parenti played by Dan DeLuca *Played by: Dan DeLuca *Appears in season 4: \\"Home Rooms\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Alliances\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\" (uncredited); \\"Unto Others\\"; \\"Misgivings\\" and \\"Final Grades\\". Dr. David Parenti is a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland with a special interest in repeat violent offenders. He receives a grant from the university for a pilot study aimed at reducing this behavior. He plans to target 18- to 21-year-olds as this is the age group when the behavior is most commonly exhibited. He is known to the West Baltimore church deacon who puts him in touch with retired police officer Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin. Parenti is interested in meeting Colvin because he is well known around campus for his last action in the police department ‚Äì a program of drug tolerant zones that significantly reduced crime in his district. Colvin takes a salaried position to assist Parenti with his study. Colvin wants Parenti to target younger age groups by showing him that violent behavior is entrenched in 18- to 21-year- olds. A visit to Colvin's old district and introduction to an 18-year-old criminal, who tries to assault Parenti for taking notes, convinces Parenti. Colvin and Parenti decide to focus on eighth grade middle school children and approach the Edward Tilghman middle school with their program. The principal, Claudell Withers, agrees to let them separate children with behavioral difficulties into their own class where they can be targeted and studied. Parenti also gets approval from the education department on Baltimore's North Avenue on the condition that his program does not make any headlines. With the assistance of eighth grade head teacher Grace Sampson and assistant principal Marcia Donnelly he selects a class of ten students. Colvin refers to their target group as \\"corner kids\\". They hire a class teacher and assistant to deal with the students. Parenti is fasciniated by the behavior exhibited by his students. When the program is eventually terminated, Colvin's frustration is in stark contrast to Parenti's excitement about the attention the research will receive from academics. =Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski= Prez is an ex- detective who showed great aptitude for surveillance and wiretap cases but struggled to maintain his composure in the field. He has embarked on a new career as a middle school math teacher. =Grace Sampson= *Played by: Dravon James *Appears in :Season 3: \\"Dead Soldiers\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season 4: \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Home Rooms\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Alliances\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\"; \\"Unto Others\\"; Corner Boys\\"; \\"Know Your Place\\"; \\"Misgivings and \\"Final Grades\\". Sampson is a senior middle school English teacher and is the head teacher for the eighth grade at the Edward Tilghman Middle School. She plays a matriarchal role in the school as many of the students view her as a disciplinary motherly type (all the students act correctly when she approaches them). Grace has a son named Allen, after the boy's father. She had a relationship with Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise before he was sentenced to a long prison term. When he was released from prison he tracked Grace down and learned where she was working. She avoids reconnecting with Cutty but offers him help in the form of putting him in touch with her church deacon to help him find work. Cutty visits Grace again when he has established a boxing gym for local kids. She rebuffs his advances again and tells him that she is proud of him. Grace's sister Queenie is a drug addict and is envious of the way her sister has taken control of her life. Grace is feared and respected by her students who know her as Mrs. Sampson. She is able to subdue a classroom quickly and commands the attention of children easily. As head of the eighth grade she encourages her teachers to use simple consistent rules in the classroom to make it easy for the students to comply. She is supportive of new teacher Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski and helps him with discipline problems in his classes when she can. When a student named Chiquan is attacked by a classmate wielding a boxcutter in Pryzbylewski's class it is Grace who steps in and slaps the violent student to disarm her. She comforts the injured girl and asks a responsible student, Crystal Judkins, to phone for an ambulance. Grace works with Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin to establish separate classes for two groups of eighth graders that he terms \\"corner kids\\" and \\"stoop kids\\". By separating the problem \\"corner kids\\" from classes he hopes that he can address their specific needs and give the other students more time to learn. Grace helps him to identify children who might be considered \\"corner kids\\". She suggests Namond Brice. She works alongside Assistant Principal Marcia Donnelly to select another nine students for the class. Grace sees Cutty once more when he is working as a custodian bringing truanting children into the school. This time both of them are content to leave their relationship in the past. Actress Dravon James portrays both Grace and her sister Queenie. =Claudell Withers= Claudell Withers played by Richard Hidlebird *Played by: Richard Hidlebird *Appears in season 4: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Alliances\\"; \\"Know Your Place\\"; \\"Misgivings\\". Withers is the principal of Edward Tilghman Middle School and has held the post for eleven years. He is regarded as something of a renegade. He entrusts much of the operation of the school to Assistant Principal Marcia Donnelly. Withers goes out on a limb to allow Dr. David Parenti and Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin to launch a controversial pilot study at his school. Withers holds the education department's administrators in low regard and refers to their headquarters on North Avenue as the \\"Puzzle Palace\\". Students =Namond Brice= Namond Brice is a tough-talking eighth-grade student who struggles to follow in the footsteps of his father, Wee-Bey. =Aaron \\"Bug\\" Manigault= *Played by: Keenon Brice *Appears in :Season four: \\"Refugees\\", \\"Corner Boys\\", \\"Know Your Place\\", \\"Final Grades\\" :Season five: \\"More with Less\\" (uncredited), \\"Not for Attribution\\", \\"React Quotes\\", \\"Clarifications\\" Bug is Michael Lee's younger half-brother. Michael shows concern in taking care of Bug; he helps Bug with schoolwork and has Dukie look after Bug. When Michael gets in trouble with the Stanfield Organization, he leaves Bug with his Aunt in Howard County. =Zenobia Dawson= *Played by: Taylor King *Appears in season four: \\"Alliances\\", \\"Margin of Error\\" (uncredited), \\"Unto Others\\", \\"Misgivings\\", \\"A New Day\\" (uncredited), \\"That's Got His Own\\" and \\"Final Grades\\". Zenobia is a student at Edward Tilghman middle school who often disrupts classes, in particular she is disruptive in Mr. Prezbo's math class. She is one of the children selected for the special class by Assistant Principal Marcia Donnelly. By the end of the season Zenobia is one of the three students that makes the most progress through the \\"corner boys\\" class. When she returns to her regular class she is attentive and doesn't cause any disturbances. =Donut= Donut played by Nathan Corbett *Played by: Nathan Corbett *Appears in season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\", \\"Soft Eyes\\", \\"Alliances\\", \\"Margin of Error\\", \\"Unto Others\\", \\"Misgivings\\", \\"A New Day\\", \\"That's Got His Own\\", and \\"Final Grades\\". Donut (given name \\"Tyrell\\", as evidenced in the season four finale, \\"Final Grades\\") is a student at Edward Tilghman Middle School, and was in 6th grade during season 4. He is interested in cars and is an accomplished, compulsive auto thief. He is friends with Namond Brice, Michael Lee and Randy Wagstaff. He brings Sergeant Ellis Carver's attention to the group when he is spotted in a stolen Cadillac Escalade. Carver warns the boys that if he ties them to any further auto thefts he will organize alleyway beatings for each of them. Donut remains defiant, quietly remarking that Carver has a nice car as he walks away. He carries a homemade slim jim that he keeps in his sock. On request, Donut breaks into math teacher Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski's car when he locks his keys in it, leaving Prez grateful but rather worried about having a kid at school who is evidently able to break into cars. When Randy is unexpectedly tasked with distributing Carcetti campaign literature on the day of the primary election, Donut steals an SUV to make the job go faster. Once Donut learns that Randy has already been paid upfront, he asks for his share of the \\"walk-around\\" money and leaves. Donut works with Namond and their even younger friend Kenard selling drugs around their school hours. Donut's carjacking abilities however get him into trouble with corrupt patrolman Walker who breaks his fingers. Donut is a reckless driver, often speeding, ignoring traffic signs, and occasionally wrecking the cars he steals. In the final scene of the season four finale, as Namond is on the Colvins' porch getting ready for school, Donut drives by in a stolen SUV with the stereo blasting. Donut and Namond share a nod and then Donut speeds away, through a stop sign at the end of the corner, nearly running into another honking driver while Namond is left smiling at the spectacle. =Crystal Judkins= *Played by: Destiny Jackson-Evans *Appears in season four: \\"Soft Eyes\\", \\"Home Rooms\\" (uncredited), \\"Refugees\\" (uncredited), \\"Alliances\\" (uncredited), \\"Misgivings\\" (uncredited).

He was the first who tried to reintroduce tigers and leopards from captivity into the wild.Thapar, V. (2010) Obituary: Billy Arjan Singh HT Media Limited, 2 January 2010 online Billy Arjan Singh died at his original farmhouse Jasbir Nagar on 1 January 2010.  Early life  Kunwar \\"Billy\\" Arjan Singh was born in Gorakhpur on 15 August 1917 as the second son of Kunwar Jasbir Singh, CIE (1887‚Äì1942), a member of the royal Ahluwalia dynasty of Kapurthala. His grandfather was Raja Harnam Singh and his uncle was Raja Maharaj Singh. Rajkumari Amrit Kaur was his aunt and his elder brother was Air Vice-Marshal Kunwar Jaswant Singh, PVSM (1915‚Äì1963). In 1940, Singh was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the British Indian Army and was posted to the south of Iraq. Upon his return to India he purchased a farm in the remote district of Lakhimpur Kheri and built himself a home ‚Äì named in honour of his father ‚Äì Jasbir Nagar. He settled down to a life of farming and hunting. Nearly ten years later, he also acquired an estate on the borders of the forestry reserve at Dudhwa. This came to be known as Tiger Haven and it is there that he lived for most of the rest of his life.  Hunter turned conservationist  Singh described how in his youth he had been an insatiable hunter. However, one day having shot a young leopard in the lights of his vehicle, he dramatically changed his view of hunting, feeling nothing but revulsion for killing and vowing that from then on he would pursue the cause of conservation. His first major project was to save a herd of barasingha in the neighbouring Sathiana range of the forestry reserve at Dudhwa. In 1976, he was awarded the World Wildlife Fund's gold medal, the WWF's premier award, for his conservation work.WWF The Duke of Edinburgh Conservation Medal online He was also largely responsible for persuading the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, to transform Dudhwa into a national park.  Re-introduction of big cats  Singh's conservation efforts for wildlife are best known for his reintroduction of leopards and a tiger into the wild of Dudhwa National Park. He started by bringing up an orphaned male leopard cub named Prince, which he successfully reintroduced to the wild in 1973. To provide Prince with a mate he subsequently raised two orphaned female leopards cubs, Harriet and Juliette. In July 1976, he acquired a hand-reared female tiger cub named Tara from Twycross Zoo in the United Kingdom, and reintroduced her to the wild in the Dudhwa National Park with the permission of India's then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In the 1990s, some tigers were observed in the protected area, which had a Siberian tiger phenotype of a large head, pale pelage, white complexion, and wide stripes, and were therefore suspected to be Bengal-Siberian tiger hybrids. Billy Arjan Singh sent hair samples of tigers from the area to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad where the samples were analysed using mitochondrial sequence analysis. Results revealed that the tigers in question had a Bengal tiger mitochondrial haplotype indicating that their mother was a Bengal tiger. Skin, hair and blood samples from 71 tigers collected in various Indian zoos, in the National Museum in Kolkata and including the two hair samples from Dudhwa National Park were prepared for microsatellite analysis that revealed that two tigers had alleles in two loci that were contributed by Bengal and Siberian tiger subspecies. However, samples of two hybrid specimens constituted a too small base to conclusively presume that Tara was the source of the Siberian tiger genes.Menon, S. (1997). Tainted Royalty . India Today.  Awards  For his contributions to conservation, Arjan Singh was widely honoured. In 1996, he was awarded the World Wildlife Gold Medal, and obtained the Order of the Golden Ark in 1997. In 2004, Arjan Singh received the Getty Award, administered by the World Wildlife Fund, for his innovative contribution to conservation and for creating public awareness. In 2006, he received the Yash Bharati award and the Padma Bhushan two months later. He also received the Lifetime Award for Tiger Conservation.  Legacy  To ensure that his work in conservation continued, Singh established the Tiger Haven Society in 1992. The Society's aims include preserving Tiger Haven and sponsoring research into wildlife.

Sobotka family The Sobotka family is a Polish American Baltimore family. The head of the family is Frank, a treasurer for the local union. The Sobotkas are hated by Southeastern District commander Stanislaus Valchek who has a long-standing feud with Frank. =Frank Sobotka= Frank Sobotka was a respected longshoremen's local union leader who became involved with an organized crime smuggling operation in order to finance a political campaign to sustain the docks. =Joan Sobotka= *Played by: Elisabeth Noone *Appears in season 2: \\"Ebb Tide\\" and \\"Hard Cases\\". Joan is Louis' wife and the two live with their grown son, Nick. Joan bemoans her family's drinking habits and tries to encourage Nick to get as much work as possible at the port. She refuses to make breakfast for him if he is not up in time for work. Nick often has his girlfriend Aimee to stay but hides her visits from his parents. Joan is aghast when the police serve warrants and search her home looking for Nick and find drugs and cash. =Louis Sobotka= *Played by: Robert Hogan *Appears in season 2: \\"Hard Cases\\"; \\"Duck and Cover\\"; \\"Bad Dreams\\" and \\"Port in a Storm\\". Louis is Frank Sobotka's elder brother and Nick's father. Louis was forced to retire early from his trade as a shipwright. He spends his days hypothetically gambling on horses (he never places any money on his bets) and drinking at Delores' bar. He refuses to get involved in the family's smuggling operation. When a warrant is put on Nick for his drug involvement Louis convinces him to turn himself in. =Nick Sobotka= Played by: Pablo Schreiber Louis and Joan's son and Frank's nephew, Nick is a well-liked young stevedore with extensive family connections to the Baltimore port and links to the criminal underworld. =Ziggy Sobotka= Ziggy is Frank's son, an impulsive and often reckless young checker, loosely based on Pinkie Bannion, a real life docker in the Baltimore area, at the docks with a desire to prove himself and a respected father to live up to.

Nat is a firm believer that the unions should focus on repairing the disused grain pier before it is bought by property developers. He opposes Frank's efforts to have the canal dredged as he believes that this is a goal beyond their reach. Nat is concerned about Frank's surge in income and spending on campaign contributions and hiring a lobbyist. He questions Frank about the source of the funds and when Frank refuses to answer Nat cautions him about the risks of showing so much money. Nat is an advocate for Ott in the forthcoming union election. He expects Frank to stand down to let Ott take his place as the unions have an arrangement that Polish and African American leaders will alternate. Frank asks Nat to allow him to continue for a second term to try to achieve his political goals and Nat is dubious. When Frank is murdered, Nat is horrified along with the other Stevedores. Nat's worst fears are ultimately realized when the grain pier is converted into condominiums. =Vernon \\"Ott\\" Motley= * Played by: Bus Howard * Appears in season 2: \\"Ebb Tide\\"; \\"Collateral Damage\\"; \\"Duck and Cover\\"; \\"Stray Rounds\\" and \\"Port in a Storm\\". Moustached older African-American stevedore often seen drinking in Delores' bar. Ott was arrested on a DWI charge as part of Major Valchek's vendetta against the union. He was released on bail later the same day. Frank's response was to have Horseface steal a surveillance van from Valchek's district parking lot; Ott helped to load the van into a container to be shipped around the country. Ott was set to take over from Frank as treasurer when the next election came around, per the Stevedores' arrangement that the position swap between a Polish and African-American after each term. Ott was supported by his friend Nat Coxson, president of another local union. Ott realized that Frank planned to run again and was angry that he was not honoring the agreement. When Frank was murdered, Ott withdrew his candidacy as a show of unity against the federal government's attempt to break up the union. =Little Big Roy= * Played by: Richard Pelzman * Appears in: :Season 2: \\"Ebb Tide\\"; \\"Backwash\\" (uncredited); \\"Duck and Cover\\"; \\"Bad Dreams\\" and \\"Port in a Storm\\" (uncredited). :Season 5: \\"The Dickensian Aspect\\" Little Big Roy is a large, balding, Polish crew chief from Nat Coxson's IBS longshoremen's union. He is often seen drinking in Delores' bar with other union members. Frank Sobotka borrowed Little Big Roy's union card in order to work a ship to clear his head after he was arrested. When Frank's body was pulled out of the docks Little Big Roy was there to watch with the other devastated Stevedores. As well as that, he is well known for being very protective of his Union Card and is extremely cautious about who he gives it to. =Thomas \\"Horseface\\" Pakusa= * Played by: Charley Scalies * Appears in season two: \\"Ebb Tide\\"; \\"Collateral Damage\\"; \\"Hot Shots\\"; \\"Hard Cases\\"; \\"Undertow\\"; \\"All Prologue\\"; \\"Backwash\\"; \\"Duck and Cover\\"; \\"Stray Rounds\\"; \\"Storm Warnings\\"; \\"Bad Dreams\\" and \\"Port in a Storm\\".

It comprises a series of graphic scores Frith composed in 1992 \\"for any number of players\\". It was performed live by Frith, Ikue Mori, Zeena Parkins and the International Occasional Ensemble at five concerts in Canada (October 1992), Italy (May 1992), Belgium (May 1994), Netherlands (October 1994) and Germany (October 1995). Frith also conducted and directed the performances. Background The graphic scores used for the performances were a set of photographs taken by Frith of a variety of inanimate objects, including stone pavings, brick walls, windows, stacks of logs and high-tension wires. Each photograph had instructions explaining to the musicians how to interpret the patterns in the image. For example, \\"Skylight IV\\" was a photograph of skylights in a large building and was annotated as follows: Frith chose the pictures for the patterns and repetitions they contained. Breaks in the patterns (for example, paint smudges, leaves on sand) guided soloists and defined instrumental groupings. Generally time was read from left to right and pitch vertically. Under the direction of Frith, with wide latitude given to each individual musician's interpretation of the proceedings, the resulting music was a form of structured improvisation. Dave Lynch at AllMusic wrote: \\"At its best, structured improvisation can provide a guiding context that enhances, rather than limits, the impact of the improvisations themselves.

They are a shallow flood plain 240 km long and about 50 km wide,Google Earth accessed 1 September 2014. flooded to a depth of less than a meter in the rainy season (deeper in some lagoons and permanently swampy areas), and drying out to a clayey black soil in the dry season. Geography The Kafue Flats stretch for approximately 240 km east to west along the Kafue River from below the Itezhi-Tezhi gap, site of the Itezhi-Tezhi Dam, to Kafue town and the start of the Kafue Gorge. At their widest point they are 50 km wide and their total area is around 6,500 sq km. The elevation of the Kafue river falls 40 m along the flats from 1030 m at Itezhi-Tezhi to 990 m at Kafue town. The town of Mazabuka and the Nakambala sugar estate lie on the south east edge and the small town of Namwala is situated at the south west edge of the flats. MODIS image of the Kafue Flats in flood and the Itezhi-Tezhi dam - 14 February 2008. The Kafue Flats fall within parts of the Itezhi-Tezhi and Mumbwa Districts in Central Province, Kafue District in Lusaka Province and Monze, Namwala and Mazabuka districts in Southern Province. People The Batwa (or Twa) are thought to have been the first inhabitants of the Kafue Flats area but are now a small minority population settled on higher ground around the Kafue river channel where they support themselves through fishing. The Batwa are generally considered to be the surviving remnants of nomadic Bushmen who inhabited Zambia long before the Bantu peoples began to arrive from the Congo basin to the north. The area is now dominated by Ila and Balundwe (or Lundwe, or Plateau Tonga) farmers and cattle herders, in at least 21 chieftaincies, who came to the area between 200 and 300 years ago. They depended on farming, fishing, cattle rearing and wildlife, often moving between a fixed settlement in the woodlands and cattle camps in the flats after the floods have receded. In addition to the settled community there is also a seasonal influx of fishing communities from other parts of the country. These immigrants are mostly Bemba from the north of the country and the Copperbelt area, and Lozi from the Western Province. The population has increased significantly since the 1970s and by 2004 there were at least 11 major permanent fishing camps on the flats each of which was occupied by at least 500 fishermen. In addition there were a large number of temporary fishing camps established during the dry season. In some cases the Batwa are marginalised from other ethnic groups, particularly the Bemba and the Lozi fishermen who consider them inferior. By contrast the Ila are held in high regard by other groups due to their history of being one of the richest cattle-owning groups in the region, although fishing and hunting plays an equally significant role in their culture. Hydrology and dams The hydrology of the Kafue River and Kafue Flats have been significantly altered by the construction in the 1970s of two dams, firstly at Kafue Gorge downstream of the flats and then at Itezhi-Tezhi upstream of the flats as parts of a scheme to generate hydroelectric power. The Kafue Gorge Dam, with 600MW of hydroelectric power generation, was completed in 1972 creating a reservoir downstream of the Kafue Flats with a storage capacity of 785 million m3. To enable more power generation (up to 900 MW) another 65m high dam at Itezhi-Tezhi, upstream of the Kafue Flats, was completed in 1976. The reservoir stores 5,700 million m3 of water and covers a 370 sq km area of the Kafue River and its tributary the Musa River. The Itezhi-Tezhi Dam stores water during the wet season which is then released for the turbines at the Kafue Gorge Dam and power station during the dry season. Water takes approximately eight weeks to travel between Itezhi-tezhi and Kafue Gorge. Prior to construction of the dam at Itezhi-Tezhi, flooding of the Kafue Flats was the result of high flows within the Kafue River beginning to rise following the onset of the rains in November to December and with the peak flood occurring sometime between April and May. The flats would subsequently slowly drain with very little surface water remaining by October to November the following year. Releases from Itezhi-Tezhi dam are very different to the historical flows experienced within the Kafue River with the smooth annual rise and fall in discharge being replaced by sudden increases as large volumes of water are released from the dam. A substantial discharge is now maintained throughout the dry season whereas naturally this period is associated with lower river flows. Although maximum floods may have been reduced as a result of the dam, the almost year-round releases means that parts of the flats, for instance Chunga Lagoon, now remain permanently flooded. In addition, the Kafue Gorge Dam has created a large reservoir which back up into the eastern end of the flats leading to areas of permanent inundation. Protected areas The Kafue Flats include two national parks (IUCN Category II protected areas), the Lochinvar and Blue Lagoon National Parks. Both parks were established in the 1970s on land formerly used for cattle ranching. The 428 sq km Lochinvar National Park, famous for large numbers of Kafue lechwe, sits south of the Kafue river and is accessible from the Lusaka-Livingstone road at Monze. Lochinvar National Park has one of the highest numbers of vulnerable wattled crane in Africa. Blue Lagoon National park, north of the Kafue, can be accessed from the Lusaka-Mongu road west of Lusaka. The 500 sq km park is home to a large abundance and variety of waterbirds as well as lechwe, sitatunga, zebra and African buffalo. 6,000 sq km of the Kafue Flats outside of the two national parks are covered by the Kafue Flats Game Management Area (GMA)(IUCN Category VI protected area). The GMA affords protection to the environment and wildlife whilst still allowing for the sustainable use of natural resources. The Kafue Flats were entered onto the Ramsar list of Wetlands of International Importance in 1991 covering an area of 6,000 sq km coincident with the Kafue Flats GMA. The Kafue Flats, Blue Lagoon National Park, Lochinvar National Park and Kafue Flats Game Management Area (GMA). Agriculture The land around the Kafue Flats are an important agricultural area in Zambia. As well as supporting a large number of subsistence and small-scale farmers, the flats are also a source of irrigation water for three large commercial farming operations concentrated around the eastern end of the flats. The oldest commercial farming operation on the Kafue Flats is the Nakambala Sugar Estate located on the southern edge of the flats at Mazabuka. The Nakambala estate, owned by Zambia Sugar Plc a subsidiary of South African company Illovo Sugar, along with outgrowers and smallholder farmers is the largest sugar producer in Zambia and operated on approximately 20,000 hectares of irrigated farmland. North of the Kafue Flats, Consolidated Farming Ltd., a Zambian company, produces sugar under the Kafue Sugar brand from a 9,000 hectare estate pumping water from the Kafue Flats. To the east of Consolidated Farming, the Chiansi irrigation scheme grows wheat and other irrigated crops on 200 hectares with plans to expand to 2,500 hectares. Ecology The Kafue Flats consists of a complex pattern of floodplain, lagoons, ox-bow lakes, abandoning river channels, marshes and levees surrounded by grasslands and woodlands. The flats comprise two ecoregions. The central seasonally- and permanently-flooded areas are part of the Zambezian flooded grasslands ecoregion, and the surrounding grasslands and woodlands are in the Zambezian and mopane woodlands ecoregion. The soils of the flats are heavy in texture and tend to crack widely when dry, becoming very sticky and plastic when wet. These soils are mainly black or dark gray and produce an irregular surface relief known as gilgai consisting of a series of small ridges standing 20‚Äì60 cm above circular depressions about 2‚Äì7 meters in diameter. =Vegetation= The main vegetation types of the Kafue Flats are woodland (miombo, mopane, Acacia, and Combretum), termitaria grassland, flooded grasslands, permanent swamps and levees and lagoons. =Wildlife= Wattled crane. The Kafue lechwe (Kobus leche kafuensis), an antelope specialised for living in the marshy conditions of the flats, is endemic to the area. There were estimated to be 250,000 lechwe living on the Kafue Flats in 1931, one of the highest animal carrying capacities in the world at 11,000 kg per km2. By 2005 the number of lechwe was estimated to have fallen to 38,000, a number which remained mostly stable until the next census completed in 2009. The declining numbers of Kafue lechwe has been attributed to the building of the Itezhi-Tezhi Dam and subsequent change in intensity and timing of flooding as well as illegal poaching and the pressures of rising numbers of people and cattle. Along with lechwe, zebras are the dominant species of large mammal that are found in the flats. Wildebeest, buffalo, roan, kudu, hippo are present in limited numbers particularly in and around the Lochinvar and Blue Lagoon National Parks. =Birds= The Kafue Flats area supports more than 450 species of threatened, endangered and migratory bird species and the area has been designated an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) by Birdlife International. The flats are home to large concentrations of resident and migratory waterbirds including significant breeding colonies deep within the swamps. The flats also host a high diversity and density of breeding raptors particularly vultures. The flats are an extremely important habitat for the wattled crane (Bugeranus carunculatus) which is listed in the IUCN Red List as vulnerable. Numbers of wattled crane in the flats dropped from between 2000 and 3000 in the 1970s to less than 1000 by 2002. Other important species found on the Kafue Flats include the crowned crane, slaty egret, lappet faced vulture, lesser kestrel and corn crake. Threats to the bird life of the Kafue Flats include changes to the intensity and timing of floods caused by the dam upstream at Itezhi-Tezhi, the spread of invasive weed species and the impact of increasing human populations.

This hawk breeds in southern Africa and is a resident species of dry, open semi-desert with 75 cm or less annual rainfall. It is commonly seen perched on roadside telephone poles.  Description  This species is approximately 55 cm in length with a wingspan of 110 cm.Hockey, P.A.R.; Dean, W. R. J.; Ryan, P. G. Roberts Birds of Southern Africa (7th ed.). Cape Town: Trustees of the John Voelcker Bird Book Fund. . The adult has grey upperparts with a white rump. The central tail feathers are black tipped with white and the outer tail feathers are barred grey and white. The head and upper breast are pale grey while the rest of the underparts are finely barred in dark grey and white. The eyes are dark brown in the adult and pale yellow in the immature. The bill is red at the base and dark grey at the tip. The cere, facial skin and long legs are also red. In flight, the adult has black primary flight feathers, very pale grey (white from a distance) secondaries, and grey forewings. Immatures have brown upperparts, with a white rump and black bars on the tail. From below, the flight feathers and tail are white with black barring, the throat is dark-streaked white, and the rest of the underparts are rufous. It is larger and paler than the barred-rumped dark chanting goshawk, Melierax metabates. Both sexes are vocal during the breeding season. The call is a tuneful whistling ' usually given from a tree-top perch.  Ecology  = Food and Foraging = The pale chanting goshawk hunts predominantly from elevated perches such as trees and telephone poles but also walks on the ground in pursuit of prey. It is an opportunistic raptor and eats a wide variety of prey including small mammals, lizards, birds, large insects and carrion. It has also been recorded predating upon Tent tortoise and Leopard tortoise hatchlings which are swallowed whole while the shell is still soft. There is some evidence of social hunting in breeding groups but solitary hunting is the norm. Pale chanting goshawks commonly associate with foraging Honey badgers and feed on organisms that are flushed by the Honey badger's feeding activity. This association increases the hunting opportunities and prey capture success of the pale chanting goshawk while the honey badger does not suffer any loss of foraging efficiency. = Breeding = The relatively small stick nest is built in a tree (often a Vachellia) at a height of 2 to 12 m or on a pole or pylon. Nests have been recorded being lined with soft materials including animal fur, dry dung, Cape penduline tit nests, man-made cloth and the silk nests of a social spider (Stegodyphus dumicola). The female lays and incubates two (occasionally one or three) chalky white, unmarked eggs. Usually only one chick is raised but nests raising two chicks are not uncommon. The breeding cycle begins in midwinter and takes over 115 days. After leaving the nest the young may be found near it for some months and in the following year may even display in the same area. Some pairs and especially trios raise a second brood, starting about 24 days after the first brood fledges. Normally a female mates with a single male (monogamy), but in \\"broken veld\\" vegetation (a prey-rich habitat in the Little Karoo), a female and two males may form a polyandrous trio. (Abstract only for non- subscribers.) In these cases an alpha male and female will be assisted in raising the young by a beta male. The alpha male copulates with the female 31-5 days before laying while the beta male copulates 5-3 days before laying. Subordinate co-breeding males may have reproductive fitness benefits by assisting the alpha female with nest defense and prey provision. Non-breedeing individuals from previous broods may remain in their natal territory and form part of the breeding group.  Habitat and abundance  Pale chanting goshawks have a large range throughout most of the drier regions of Southern Africa. They inhabit dry semi-desert areas with open ground and appropriate perches from which to hunt. There is no evidence of migration though both short and long-distance movements are common. In the Karoo one pair or family group occupies between 4.4 and 8.6 km2 while around Windhoek one pair occupies between 5.4 and 6.7 km2.

He subsequently captained the destroyers , , , , river gunboats , , destroyer , Destroyer Group 16, Destroyer Group 21, Destroyer Group 8, auxiliary seaplane tender Kagu Maru, auxiliary oiler Shiretoko, and cruisers and . He was promoted to commander in 1932 and to captain in 1937. Kimura was captain of Suzuya during the attack on Pearl Harbor. He later assisted in the rescue of the crew of the after that cruiser had been hit and sunk by American bombers during the Battle of Midway. On 1 November 1942, Kimura was promoted to Rear Admiral. He subsequently served in a number of staff positions, and was also commander of Desron3, with , , , , Yukikaze, , , and . He was assigned to escort eight transports with 6000 soldiers of the IJA 51st Division and 400 marines from Rabaul to Lae, New Guinea. In the Battle of the Bismarck Sea on 3‚Äì4 March 1943, US Navy and RAAF bombers inflicted severe damage on the Japanese convoy, sinking all of the transports and four destroyers. Admiral Kimura was wounded by machine gun fire in the shoulder and stomach, and his flagship, Shirayuki, was among the four destroyers sunk during the engagement. He, and most of his crew, were rescued by Shikinami. After recovering from his injuries, Kimura, with an augmented DesRon 1, was assigned to cover the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Kiska Island in the Aleutians. When poor weather threatened the withdrawal operations, Kimura disobeyed orders and remained on station until the last man was recovered. Still in command of DesRon 1, Kimura sortied from Pescadores, Formosa on 22 October 1944 to join Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima's Second Striking Force in the battle of Surigao strait, transferring his flag from when she was disabled by a torpedo fired by Lieutenant (jg) Mike Kovar's PT-137.

Taxonomy This species is intermediate between the smaller dark chanting goshawk (widespread to the west and south) and the pale chanting goshawk (southern Africa) in colour, size, and leg length, but not in range. It has often been considered a subspecies of the latter, but because of this disparity between geography and characters, it is now considered a separate species, as agreed by many authorities. Description left This species averages 49 to 55 cm long, with a wingspan of 96 to 110 cm and a tail length of 20 to 25 cm. Males average 85% of the size of females. Like the other chanting goshawks, it resembles an accipiter but the tail is shorter and graduated (the feathers increase in length from the edges to the center), and the wings are broader. Adults have grey head, neck, breast, and upperparts, except for the white or lightly barred uppertail coverts. The belly has narrow grey and white bars and the undertail coverts are white. The belly and wing linings are white, the secondaries are light grey, and the primaries are dark, giving an impression from below of a white bird with grey head and dark wingtips. The tail is blackish above and white below with grey bars. The cere is yellow, and the legs are orange-red. Juveniles are dull brown above with a pale stripe over the eye. They have white underparts with brown streaks on the throat and breast, brown bars on the belly coverts, and faint or no barring on the undertail coverts. The tail is brown with widely spaced darker brown bars. The rump is white, partially barred or unmarked. They are indistinguishable from some juvenile dark chanting goshawks except for the less barred undertail coverts and rump. Also, the legs are slightly longer at all ages than the dark chanting goshawk's. Distribution and habitat It occurs in semidesert, dry bush, and wooded grassland up to 2000 m in southern Ethiopia, Djibouti, western Somalia, eastern Kenya, northeastern Tanzania, and adjacent Uganda. Behaviour The eastern chanting goshawk is usually seen alone. It often perches on the tops of trees and utility poles. Its wingbeats are shallow and \\"straight-arm\\". It holds its wings flat, or sometimes in a V, when it glides. Its calls are \\"a melodious piping whee-pee-pee-pee, and a long high-pitched kleee-yeu\\", slightly lower-pitched than those of the dark chanting goshawk, or \\"peeu-peeu- peeu-pee-pee-pee-pee...\\" in the nesting season, the source of its name.

In response, various mechanisms have been tried to defuse the perceived problem. Positions from the community Community leaders such as Richard Stallman, Alan Cox, Bruce Perens,/home/bruce/Patents.html and Linus Torvalds and companies such as Red Hat,redhat.com  Red Hat Patent Policy and MySQL,MySQL AB :: MySQL Public Patent Policy and community groups such as FSFE,FSFE - Software Patents in Europe IFSO,Software Patentability & EU Directive COD/2002/0047 all believe that patents cause problems for free software. Patent licensing Leading open-source figures and companies have complained that software patents are overly broad and the USPTO should reject most of them. Bill Gates has said \\"If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today‚Äôs ideas were invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today\\". Problems for free software Free software projects cannot agree to patent licences that include any kind of per-copy fee. No matter how low the fee is, there is no way for a free software distributor to know how many copies are being made. Also, adding any requirements to pay or to notify someone each time a copy is made would make the software no longer free software. A patent licence that is royalty-free, or provides a one-time worldwide payment is acceptable. Version 2 of the GNU General Public License does not allow software to be distributed if that software requires a patent licence that does not \\"permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you\\". The 2004 OSRM study In 2004, Open Source Risk Management commissioned a patent study, carried out by Dan Ravicher. For this study, Ravicher performed patent searches to estimate the patent-risk of the Linux kernel: > In conclusion, he found that no court-validated software patent is infringed > by the Linux kernel. However, Ravicher also found 283 issued but not yet > court-validated software patents that, if upheld as valid by the courts, > could potentially be used to support patent claims against Linux. Techniques for opposing patents =Patent retaliation= \\"Patent retaliation\\" clauses are included in several free software licenses. The goal of these clauses is to create a penalty so as to discourage the licensee (the user/recipient of the software) from suing the licensor (the provider/author of the software) for patent infringement by terminating the license upon the initiation of such a lawsuit. The Free Software Foundation included a narrow patent retaliation clause in drafts 1 and 2 of version 3 of the GPL, however, this clause was removed in draft 3 as its enforceability and effectiveness was decided to be too dubious to be worth the added complexity. Examples of broader clauses are those of the Apache License and the Mozilla Public License. =Patent pools= In 2005, IBM, Novell, Philips, Red Hat, and Sony founded the Open Invention Network (OIN). OIN is a company that acquires patents and offers them royalty free \\"to any company, institution or individual that agrees not to assert its patents against the Linux operating system or certain Linux-related applications\\". Novell donated the valuable Commerce One web services patents to OIN. These potentially threaten anyone who uses web services. OIN's founders intend for these patents to encourage others to join, and to discourage legal threats against Linux and Linux- related applications. Along with several other projects, Mono is listed as a covered project. =Lobbying for legislative change= Movements have formed to lobby against the existence and enforceability of software patents. The earliest was the League for Programming Freedom in the USA. Probably the most successful was the anti-software-patent campaign in Europe that resulted in the rejection by the European Parliament of the Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions which, the free software community argues, would have made software patents enforceable in the European Union. A fledgling movement also exists in South Africa. Promises from patent holders Some software companies who hold significant patent portfolios have made non-aggression pledges to the free software community. These have varied in scope and have received a variety of responses. IBM, Sun, and Nokia are three examples. These have been described by Richard Stallman as \\"significant\\", \\"not really anything\\", and \\"next to nothing\\", respectively. Microsoft has irrevocably pledged not to assert any claims against open source developers which CEO Steve Ballmer called \\"an important step and significant change in how we share information about our products and technologies.\\" This pledge has been accepted with some skepticism. Infringement claims Microsoft has claimed that free software such as OpenOffice.org and the Linux kernel violate 235 Microsoft patents and said that it will seek licence fees, but has so far failed to disclose which patents they may violate. However, the 2009 lawsuit against TomTom involved the use of Microsoft's patents for long filenames on FAT filesystems, the code for which was in the Linux kernel, not in any TomTom-developed software. The Linux kernel developers subsequently worked around it.See the kernel option VFAT_FS_DUALNAMES In 2011 a company called Bedrock Technologies LLC won a judgment of $5 million against Google for use of the Linux kernel, which the court found to violate US patent 5,893,120 (which was filed in 1997 and issued in 1999, and covers techniques for software caches likely used in every modern operating system). Bedrock went on to sue Yahoo and lost; Yahoo's defense amounted to the use of a different version of Linux which did not execute the particular code that Bedrock had pointed out as infringing,http://www.itworld.com/article/2742293/open-source-tools/yahoo-- wins-verdict-in-bedrock-patent-trial.html but the Yahoo case did not invalidate Bedrock's patent.http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Yahoo-wins- Linux-patent-trial-that-Google-lost-1243687.html Details of exactly which code Bedrock said infringed the patent and how Yahoo managed to avoid executing that code are not publicly available. In January 2008, Trend Micro accused Barracuda Networks of patent infringement for distribution of the ClamAV anti- virus software. Microsoft's patent deals In November 2006, a highly controversial agreement was made between Novell and Microsoft that included patent licensing. This led to much criticism of Novell by the free software community. In June 2007, Xandros announced a similar deal. On June 13, 2007, a deal was reached between Microsoft and Linspire.Linspire, Microsoft in Linux- related deal In return, Linspire would change its default search engine from Google to Live search.Slashdot  Linspire Signs Patent Pact With MS Ubuntu founder and director Mark Shuttleworth has said that Ubuntu will not be making any such deal, as have Red Hat. These have been joined by a weaker statement from Mandriva that \\"we don‚Äôt believe it is necessary for us to get protection from Microsoft\\". On October 2007, IP Innovation LLC, a company specialized in patent-protection, filed a suit for patent infringement against Red Hat and Novell.The U.S. patent 5,072,412 concerns the desktop User Interface, see here However, IP Innovation LLC is a subsidiary of a company classified by some as a patent troll, and commentators suspect a strong connection between this company and Microsoft. In 2010, IP Innovation lost the suit. In December 2007, Microsoft granted the Samba project access to certain proprietary documents and must maintain a list of related patents for a one-time fee of 10,000 Euros. Microsoft was required to make this information available to competitors as part of the European Commission March 24, 2004 Decision pertaining to antitrust violations.

Laflaque (later Ici Laflaque) was a satirical show on Quebec television that commented on current events by the favour of the show's main character, G√©rard D. Laflaque, a stereotypical, family father and an announcer. Created by the cartoonist Serge Chapleau, it was broadcast on a weekly basis between 2004 and 2019 by T√©l√©vision de Radio-Canada. Its title translates to \\"and God created...Laflaque\\" (and later \\"This is Laflaque\\", a play on the classic announcement \\"Ici Radio-Canada\\") in English.  Concept  G√©rard D. Laflaque made his television debut in the early 1980s as a latex puppet. Nowadays, like the show‚Äôs other characters, he was created using CGI animation. His name was inspired by former minister and acting leader of the Quebec Liberal Party G√©rard D. Levesque. The program follows two storylines. The first involves Laflaque‚Äôs family life with his wife Georgette, his son Marcel and his Asian girlfriend Laurence, his insufferable father P√©p√®re, his dog Tarzan, and his next-door neighbour, a gay inventor named Edmond. A caricature of reporter Louise Cousineau recently joined the cast as a recurring character who owns a corner store. As part of the second storyline, Laflaque picked apart the news of the day with no holds barred on a current affairs show accompanied by his cameramen Roger and Henri (later replaced by a man who is part of numerous religions), his producer Paulo, the lovely Sarah- Laurie Joly, and the puppet Ti-Bas. A later arrival was a caricature of intellectual Denise Bombardier. Laflaque regularly welcomed all kinds of guests, mostly caricatures of politicians including Paul Martin, Jean Charest, Stephen Harper, Gilles Duceppe, Jacques Parizeau, Andr√© Boisclair, George W. Bush, Guy Bertrand, Mario Dumont, Pauline Marois, St√©phane Dion, Michael Ignatieff, Jack Layton, Nicolas Sarkozy, R√©gis Labeaume and Denis Coderre. Journalist Christopher Hall made regular appearances to deliver reports and ask ridiculous questions to people in the streets until the end of Season 3. Sometimes Segments unrelated to the news appeared in the \\"current affairs\\" part of the show, such as a cooking segment, the 'Petit Laflaque Illustre' which explains an everyday object in a ridiculous way, and 'Stade Trek' a Star Trek parody featuring the former political leaders cruising around the galaxy in Montreal's Olympic Stadium.

From 1571 to 1574 he served as Superintendent of Hamburg (per pro already since 1562), presiding as spiritual leader over the Lutheran state church of the city-state. He was educated in the school of the parish of St. Nicolai in his native city, then in L√ºneburg, and entered the University of Wittenberg, where he became the pupil of Melanchthon and Luther. In 1532, on the recommendation of Melanchthon, he was appointed teacher at the Johanneum in his native city. In 1534 he returned to the University of Wittenberg, and in the following year removed with the university to Jena. After his return to Wittenberg in 1537 he lectured on philology. In 1541 he became preacher of the church of St. Catharine in Hamburg; then acting superintendent in 1562, and was elected Superintendent of Hamburg in 1571. He is best known for his participation in the theological controversies of his time. He took part in that on the descent into hell, also in the discussion concerning the Leipzig Interim and in that over the Adiaphora. More important was that over the Lord's Supper. In 1552 he published Farrago confusanearum et inter se dissidentium opinionum de coena Domini, ex Sacramentariorum libris congesta, a warning against those who deny the presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper. He points out to the adherents of Luther the alarming progress which the sacramentarians had made and tries to prove the falsity of their doctrine by its diversity. In 1553 he issued Recta fides de coena Domini, an exegetical discussion of 1 Cor. 11 and the Words of Institution; in 1555 Collectanea sententiarum D. Aurelii Augustini de coena Domini and Fides Cyrilli episcopi Alexandriae de praesentia corporis et sanguinis Christi. Calvin answered in January 1555, with his Defensio sanae et orthodoxae doctrinae de sacramentis. Thus there was opened a controversy which involved on the side of the Reformed Lasco, Bullinger, Ochino, Valerandus Polanus, Beza, and Bibliander; on the side of the Lutherans Timann, Paul von Eitzen, Schnepff, E. Alberus, Gallus, Flacius, Judex, Brenz, and Andre√§. Westphal replied to Calvin in Adversus cuiusdam sacramentarii falsam criminationem iusta defensio, in qua et eucharistiae causa agitur (1555), to which Calvin answered in Secunda defensio piae et orthodoxae de sacramentis fidei (1556), which was an attempt to draw to his side the Philippists of Saxony and Lower Germany. Other works of Westphal occasioned by this controversy are: Epistola Joachimi Westphali, qua breviter respondet ad convicia J. Calvini (1556); Confessio fidei de eucharistiae sacramento, in qua ministri ecclesiarum Saxoniae...astruunt corporis et sanguinis D. n. J. Christi praesentiam in coena sancta, et de libro Calvini ipsis dedicato respondent (Magdeburg, 1557); Justa defensio adversus insignia mendacia J. a Lasco, quae in epistola ad Poloniae regem contra Saxonicas ecclesias sparsit (1557); Apologetica scripta Johannis Westphali, quibus et sanam doctrinam de eucharistia defendit et foedissimas calumnias sacramentariorum diluit (1558); Confutatio aliquot enormium mendaciorum Johannis Calvini (1558); Apologia confessionis de Coena Domini (1558).

Palot√°s was an early pioneer of the deep lying centre-forward role and in 1955 he scored the first ever hat- trick in a European Cup game. In 1959 he retired as a player due to a heart condition. The same condition led to his death on 17 May 1967. Club career Palot√°s spent all his playing career at MTK Budapest FC. However, during this time, the club changed their name several times. In 1949, when Hungary became a communist state, MTK were taken over by the secret police, the √ÅVH and subsequently the club became known as Textiles SE. They then became B√°stya SE, then V√∂r√∂s Lobog√≥ SE and then finally back to MTK. Despite this turmoil, the 1950s proved a successful era for club and it was while at MTK that Palot√°s, together with N√°ndor Hidegkuti and coach M√°rton Bukovi, pioneered the deep lying centre-forward position. With a team that also included Mih√°ly Lantos and J√≥zsef Zakari√°s, MTK and Palot√°s won three Hungarian League titles, a Hungarian Cup and a Mitropa Cup. In 1955, as V√∂r√∂s Lobog√≥ SE, they also played in the first ever European Cup. On 7 September 1955 at the N√©pstadion, Palot√°s scored a hat-trick as they beat RSC Anderlecht 6‚Äì3 in the first leg of the first round. This was the first ever hat-trick scored in a European Cup game. He scored again in the second-leg as V√∂r√∂s Lobog√≥ SE won 4‚Äì1. During the quarter-finals against Stade Reims he scored a further two goals as they lost 8‚Äì6 on aggregate and he finished the competition with a total of six goals scored. International career Between 1950 and 1956, Palot√°s won 24 caps and scored 18 goals for Hungary. He scored twice on his debut on 24 September 1950 in a 12‚Äì0 win against Albania. In 1952 Palot√°s scored four goals as he helped Hungary become Olympic Champions. This included two in a 3‚Äì0 win against Italy on 21 July. He also played in the final against Yugoslavia on 2 August 1952. On 17 May 1953, he helped Hungary clinch the Central European International Cup when he played in a 3‚Äì0 win against Italy at the Stadio Olimpico. Although teammates at MTK, Palot√°s and N√°ndor Hidegkuti were rivals for a place in the national side. By 1953 Hidegkuti had established himself as the first choice deep lying centre-forward for Hungary and as a result Palot√°s missed out on the two prestige friendlies against England. He travelled to England for the first game but remained on the bench. Despite this setback he continued to play regularly for Hungary until 1956. During the 1954 FIFA World Cup he scored twice in the group stage 9‚Äì0 win against South Korea and also played in the semi-final against Uruguay. On 19 May 1955 he scored a hat-trick against Finland before playing his last game for Hungary on 9 June 1956 against Portugal.

The Brigada de Reac√ß√£o R√°pida (Rapid Reaction Brigade) is a unit of the Portuguese Army which was known as BAI - Brigada Aerotransportada Independente (Independent Airborne Brigade) until 2006. Its different units are highly trained Paratroopers, Commandos and Special Operations Troops capable of responding to threats in any part of continental Portugal or any other Portuguese overseas territory with quick deployment by air, sea or land (with the support of the Air Force and/or the Navy when required). This brigade is the most requested by the Portuguese Government to fulfill international assignments due to its experience and multi-role capability. The economic crisis forced the Portuguese Government to make budget cuts in the Armed Forces, and in June 2012 it was announced that the Portuguese Army was no longer going to receive the 10 NH-90 transport helicopters that would incorporate the Unidade de Avia√ß√£o Ligeira do Ex√©rcito (Army Light Aviation Unit). Thus, the Rapid Reaction Brigade still maintains its dependency on the Air Force for aerial transportation.  History  In 1993, the Corpo de Tropas Aerotransportadas (Airborne Troops Corps), which was part of the Portuguese Air Force was disbanded and the Portuguese airborne forces were transferred to the Army. A new brigade was then created, the Independent Airborne Brigade (BAI) which included all airborne-capable forces in it. The Army also transferred to this brigade some heavier weapons like howitzers, thus giving the unit increased firepower, as well as creating an operational command named Comando de Tropas Aerotransportadas (Airborne Troops Command). The Comandos Regiment was disbanded and the Comandos that had the Parachute Course were transferred to the new brigade. For more than 10 years the BAI kept serving the country in international missions, sending Paratroopers to several locations in Europe and East-Timor. In 2002 the Comandos were reactivated as an independent unit and were separated from the Paratroopers. In 2006, a reorganization in the Portuguese Army occurred, renaming the brigade as Brigada de Reac√ß√£o R√°pida (Rapid Reaction Brigade) and adding special forces to it. These units were the Comandos and the Rangers, increasing the brigade-size with two Comando companies and the Special Operations Forces but losing the 3rd Paratrooper Infantry Battalion (disbanded). Also, this reformation had its costs since the 105mm howitzers were transferred to the Portuguese Intervention Brigade (thus losing its airborne capability) and the Airborne Troops Command was disbanded, putting the unit under the orders of the Comando Operacional de For√ßas Terrestres (Land Forces Operational Command) losing its autonomy from the rest of the Army.  Organization  The brigade's operational units are listed below. Under the Portuguese system regiments and centres are responsible for the training, maintenance, and sustainment of the operational units, but are not operational units themselves. I.e. the Army Light Aviation Unit trains, maintains and sustains the brigade's Staff Company, Signals Company, and Helicopter Group, but itself is not an operational unit and not part of the brigade during wartime. * Rapid Reaction Brigade (Brigada de Rea√ß√£o R√°pida), in Tancoshttp://www.exercito.pt/sites/BrigRR/Paginas/Organizacao.aspx Official site of the Rapid Reaction Brigade ** Command and Service Company, Army Light Aviation Unit, in Tancos ** Reconnaissance Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment (Regimento de Cavalaria N¬∫ 3) in Estremoz ** 1st Parachute Infantry Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment (Regimento de Infantaria N¬∫ 15), in Tomar ** 2nd Parachute Infantry Battalion, 10th Infantry Regiment (Regimento de Infantaria N¬∫ 10), in S√£o Jacinto ** Commando Battalion, Commando Regiment (Regimento de Comandos) in Belashttp://www.exercito.pt/sites/CTC/Paginas/Organizacao.aspx Official site of the Commando Regiment ** Special Operations Force, Special Operations Troops Centre (Centro de Tropas de Opera√ß√µes Especiais), in Lamegohttp://www.exercito.pt/sites/CTOE/Paginas/Organizacao.aspx Official site of the Special Operations Troops Centre ** Field Artillery Group, 4th Artillery Regiment (Regimento de Artilharia N¬∫ 4), in Leiria with L118 105mm howitzers ** Army Helicopter Group, Army Light Aviation Unit (Unidade de Avia√ß√£o Ligeira do Ex√©rcito),http://www.exercito.pt/sites/UALE/Paginas/Organizacao.aspx Official site of the Army Light Aviation Unit in Tancos currently without helicopters ** Anti-aircraft Artillery Battery, 1st Anti-Air Artillery Regiment (Regimento de Artilharia Anti-A√©rea N¬∫ 1) in Queluz with Stinger surface-to-air missiles ** Engineer Company, 1st Engineer Regiment (Regimento de Engenharia N¬∫ 1), in Tancos ** Signal Company, Army Light Aviation Unit, in Tancos ** Aeroterrestrial Support Battalion, Paratroopers Regiment (Regimento de Paraquedistas), in Tancoshttp://www.exercito.pt/sites/ETP/Paginas/Organizacao.aspx Official site of the Paratroopers Regiment = Paratroopers = The Paratroopers and elite infantry force and are the heaviest troops on the brigade acting as airborne light infantry, used for conventional conflicts, with emphasis on airborne assaults. Paratrooper battalions contain units with heavy weapons and light vehicles for quick assaults and raids. Paratroopers are instructed at the Parachute Troops School, in Tancos, central Portugal. * Paratrooper units: (the units are battalion sized, but retain the name regiment for historic reasons) ** 10th Infantry Regiment (Regimento de Infantaria N¬∫10) ** 15th Infantry Regiment (Regimento de Infantaria N¬∫15) = Special Operations Forces = The Special Operations Forces are generally the first to arrive and the last to leave the operational area. They are the most autonomous unit of the brigade, able to infiltrate deep behind enemy lines. Not as heavily armed as the Commandos nor the Paratroopers, its units rely on stealth to complete their objectives. Since it is airborne-qualified it can be deployed by air, sea or land. Special Operators are instructed at the Special Operations Troops Centre in Lamego, northern Portugal. * Special Operations / CTOE - Special Operations Troops Center (Centro Tropas Opera√ß√µes Especiais) = Comandos = The Comandos are an elite light infantry unit capable of conducting several special operations missions, although they are mainly a rapid reaction force. They can be deployed by air, sea or land. Commandos are instructed at the Commando Regiment, in Belas. * Commando Regiment International assignments =Independent Airborne Brigade missions= As the ancestor of the Rapid Reaction Brigade, the Independent Airborne Brigade made several missions to several different countries mainly in peacekeeping operations. Paratrooper Battalions were sent to Bosnia, East-Timor and Kosovo. = Afghanistan = After the creation of the brigade, the unit was sent to Afghanistan. An entire Commando company was sent to the area (western provinces), suffering the first KIA of the Portuguese Armed Forces since the end of the Portuguese Colonial War, during a daytime patrol. The KIA Comando was 1st Sergeant Roma Pereira, mortally hit when an IED detonated his Humvee. The Comandos were replaced by a company of Paratroopers who suffered no casualties while performing the mission. This company was yet again replaced by a second company of Comandos. = Bosnia = In the beginning of 2007, the Portuguese Defense Minister decided to end the mission in Bosnia due to the lack of need of a military presence in the area. All units from the Rapid Reaction Brigade and from the Portuguese Mechanized Brigade present in the region withdrew.

Kimball while he was a member of Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He later became the church's president.  Content  Originally published in 1969, the book discusses the issues of repentance and forgiveness through Jesus Christ in LDS theology. It is primarily written for an LDS audience. It is notable for its unusual bluntness about a range of activities that it brands as sinful, including: > Murder, adultery, theft, cursing, unholiness in masters, disobedience in > servants, unfaithfulness, improvidence, hatred of God, disobedience to > husbands, lack of natural affection, high-mindedness, flattery, lustfulness, > infidelity, indiscretion, backbiting, whispering, lack of truth, striking, > brawling, quarrelsomeness, unthankfulness, inhospitality, deceitfulness, > irreverence, boasting, arrogance, pride, double-tongued talk, profanity, > slander, corruptness, thievery, embezzlement, despoiling, covenant-breaking, > incontinence, filthiness, ignobleness, filthy communications, impurity, > foolishness, slothfulness, impatience, lack of understanding, > unmercifulness, idolatry, blasphemy, denial of the Holy Ghost, Sabbath > breaking, envy, jealousy, malice, maligning, vengefulness, implacability, > bitterness, clamor, spite, defiling, reviling, evil speaking, provoking, > greediness for filthy lucre, disobedience to parents, anger, hate, > covetousness, bearing false witness, inventing evil things, fleshliness, > heresy, presumptuousness, abomination, insatiable appetite, instability, > ignorance, self-will, speaking evil of dignitaries, becoming a stumbling > block; and in our modern language, masturbation, petting, fornication, > adultery, homosexuality; and every sex perversion, every hidden and secret > sin and all unholy and impure practices.. Kimball defines repentance as the perfect, successful abandonment of sin, through the following actions: #conviction, in which \\"the sinner consciously recognizes his sin.\\"Kimball, The Miracle of Forgiveness, p. 150. #abandonment of sin #confession to church authorities and/or other parties wronged by the sin #restitution #keeping God's commandments #forgiving others \\"Trying is not sufficient. Nor is repentance complete when one merely tries to abandon sin,\\" Kimball writes. The objective of repentance, he writes, is to obtain \\"perfection\\" as a prerequisite for achieving \\"immortality and eternal life. ... This progress toward eternal life is a matter of achieving perfection. Living all the commandments guarantees total forgiveness of sins and assures one of exaltation through that perfection which comes by complying with the formula the Lord gave us. ... Being perfect means to triumph over sin.\\"Kimball, The Miracle of Forgiveness, p. 208-209. Reputation in Mormonism The title page of soon-to-be church president Kimball's controversial 1969 book. According to Kimball's son, Edward, \\"[T]he book filled a need, as evidenced by the printing of half a million copies in English and sixteen other languages between its publication in 1969 and his death in 1985 .... By 1998 the total in all languages was roughly estimated at 1.6 million copies.\\" This book has received numerous accolades from LDS Church authorities. Ezra Taft Benson, who succeeded Kimball as president of the church, urged all church members \\"to read and reread President Spencer W. Kimball's book.\\" More recently, in General Conferences, LDS Church apostle Richard G. Scott called it a \\"masterly work\\" and, prior to that, \\"a superb guide to forgiveness through repentance.\\" Scott recommended reading the last two chapters first, to better appreciate the book's message. Although Mormon missionaries used to be encouraged to read the book, it is no longer part of the \\"approved missionary library.\\" The book went out of print in 2015. The book is controversial, even among Mormons, for its treatment of masturbation, homosexuality, premarital sex, and rape. Rape survivors have been published criticizing parts of the book including the phrase \\"It is better to die in defending one's [virginity] than to live having lost it without a struggle\\" as victim blaming and shaming rhetoric that contributes to rape culture. Allen Bergin, a retired psychologist from Brigham Young University and past president of the Association of Mormon Counselors and Psychotherapists (AMCAP), felt the useful parts were \\"overshadowed by a host of negatives and also outdated policies that the church itself doesn't even endorse any more.\\" Years after publication, Kimball reportedly remarked that its tone may have been too strong.

The name was changed officially to ACS Jakarta in 2015. School Overview ACS Jakarta is an International Baccalaureate World School and an authorized Cambridge Centre offering a world standard education to children from 3 - 18. Set in a safe, semi-rural environment located off the Jorr Tol at Kelurahan Setu, approximately 15 kilometers south-east of central Jakarta, it is within easy reach of Jakarta 's main residential areas in South and North Jakarta. We believe in bringing our students to their full potential and by preparing them for their next stage in education by offering a well-rounded and challenging curriculum. Our children also learn the importance of having good character and values via our devotions and our pupil development and religion lessons. Our Kindergarten students focus on personal, social and emotional development, giving them more self-confidence and independence preparing them for Primary School. They also get the basics of language (English, Indonesian and Mandarin), and mathematics. Our Primary School students continue on this development and they are also guided along towards the Cambridge Checkpoint at the end of Grade 6. By doing so, this gives them as sound foundation for Secondary School. Our Secondary Students begin as generalists, getting a good grounding in a wide range of subjects before specialising slightly as they embark on the Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) programme in Grades 9 and 10. Students opt for subjects based on their interest, aptitude and advice from their teachers. The culmination of their years here are in Grades 11 and 12 as our students prepare for university by taking up the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Students further specialise here and are also mentored as they gain not just content but also skills which are vital for university education. Students throughout the grade levels may take part in Co-Curricular Activities after school. This, together with camps, excursions, sports and cultural activities the school organises, will give our students a 21st century education which is not restricted to the confines of the classroom. Programmes The school admits boys and girls from nursery to grade 12 (3 ‚Äì 18 years old). Students sit for the Cambridge Primary Checkpoint Test at the end of Grade 6, the Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education at the end of grade 10, and the International Baccalaureate at the end of grade 12.

He was most recently assistant manager of Partick Thistle. He played for numerous clubs in Scotland and England, including Liverpool, Carlisle United, Bristol City, Partick Thistle and Dundee United. Career A product of the Scottish Highland Football League, Paterson began his professional career with his local Senior Club, Cove Rangers F.C. of the Scottish Highland Football League before winning a ¬£15,000 move to Graeme Souness's Liverpool in March 1992. After two full seasons at Anfield but no first team appearances, Paterson spent four years with Bristol City, where he was loaned to Cardiff City in 1997. He then embarked on a series of moves around Britain which saw him spend no more than a season at any one club, and which included a short stint (between Carlisle United and Plymouth Argyle) back in the Highland Football League with Huntly FC, where his older brother was centre half at the time. He also had a spell at Cambridge United during this period. In the summer of 2000 he made the move to professional Scottish football when he signed for Third Division side Peterhead. At Peterhead he scored once in the league against East Fife. However it wasn't long before he moved up to the First Division where he initially joined Ross County, but didn't make any appearances, and then Morton in March 2001. He was unable to prevent Morton's relegation to the Second Division. However he remained in the First Division when he signed for newly promoted side Partick Thistle. Paterson helped Thistle get a second successive promotion in 2002 and would therefore play in the Scottish Premier League. Paterson managed 68 league games for Partick Thistle. He scored two goals during his time at the club; both of which came during their run in the 2001‚Äì02 Scottish Cup. Thistle drew Inverness in the quarter final and Paterson scored in the original tie as it ended in a draw, before scoring the winner in the replay. However Thistle were defeated in the semi final by Rangers. His performances at Thistle won a move to Dundee United. Although his length of time at Tannadice was similar, Paterson was injured in his second match for the club against Celtic and spent almost his entire time injured, appearing briefly in the final match of the 2003‚Äì04 season also against Celtic. Further short spells in Scotland followed, including a brief loan spell back at Partick Thistle, before Paterson returned to his first, and home town club, Cove Rangers F. C. who play just outside the City of Aberdeen, and back in the Highland Football League at the start of 2006‚Äì07. Paterson went on to be a youth coach at Aberdeen before linking up with former Dundee United colleague Gary Bollan at Livingston in September 2009. On 30 January 2013 he was appointed interim assistant manager, alongside Alan Archibald, at Partick Thistle.

History BDP was founded in 1961 by George Grenfell-Baines with architects Bill White and John Wilkinson, quantity surveyor Arnold Towler and eight associate partners. The associates were made full equity partners in 1964. Grenfell-Baines was the first chairman. BDP was the end result of a series of experiments in profit sharing and multidisciplinary working begun by Grenfell-Baines in 1941 with the Grenfell Baines Group. A 1962 policy statement committed BDP to ‚Äúthe principle of equal status for all professions‚Äù.White, Bill (1987), The Spirit Of BDP, Preston: BDP, p 22. The firm expanded rapidly over the following decades and had 30 partners and 700 staff by the time of Grenfell-Baines's retirement in 1974. The firm has been associated with a variety of large public and private projects, such as the controversial Preston bus station that was designed by BDP's Keith Ingham and Charles Wilson, and retail projects such as the Liverpool One complex. BDP's principal offices, inherited from Grenfell Baines & Hargreaves, were in London, Manchester and Preston. By 1970, there were branch offices in Belfast, Glasgow and Guildford plus international offices in Memphis, Rome and Johannesburg. As of 2016 BDP was reported to be the UK's second largest architecture firm, with 950 employees.

The plot takes place in Z√ºrich, at the notorious Langstrasse.  Plot  Lonesome and medicament addict narcotics detective Herbert Str√§hl (Roeland Wiesnekker), who hardly can handle his own life, wants to clean up the Langstrasse area. Str√§hl often watches Berisha (Adem Kicai), the head of a drug trafficking ring, leaving his limousine and entering a dubious building, but he isn‚Äôt able to arrest him, due to the lacking of an evidence (Berisha never touches the drugs by himself). Str√§hl, who hides his depression and craving for love behind rage, clamor and stimulant drugs, has arguments with his chief Brunner (Max R√ºdlinger) and with his co-workers, e.g. with Ruedi Lautenschlager (Mike M√ºller), who is rather dull and often visits brothels. When Beat (Raphael Clamer), a former member of the Seepolizei (Police unit on lake), joins the team, Str√§hl thinks, the new blood was too calm and not tough enough. During a house search, a junkie named Ren√© Wehrli (Manuel L√∂wensberg) falls out of the window. Str√§hl gets suspended from police service. Moreover, Ren√© and his girlfriend Carol ‚ÄúCaro‚Äù Hertig (Johanna Bantzer) blackmail Str√§hl for smart money. The drug addict couple buys a lot of articles in a kiosk, and Str√§hl has to pay for them (Ren√© also fills out a ‚ÄúToto‚Äù-ticket (sports betting) there, and Str√§hl positively influences him doing it). Despite that, Ren√© doesn‚Äôt want to take back his inculpatory statement ‚Äì Ren√© demands a huge amount of heroin from Str√§hl. Str√§hl catches the dealer Beko (Nderim Hajrullahu), who is related to Berisha‚Äôs drug mafia, and presses him to cooperate. Beko shows a lot of hidden drugs to Str√§hl. Str√§hl uses a part of the drug depot's heroine to satisfy Ren√©. Ren√©, Caro and Str√§hl drive to the police station, where Ren√© wants to deny his statements to Str√§hl, while the others wait in the car. Ren√© stays in for a long time, and Str√§hl gets curious about what happened in the building. He goes in, too ‚Äì and finds Ren√© dead in the restrooms. Str√§hl and Caro smoke drugs on a foil at Str√§hl‚Äôs. Suddenly, the police enter the flat and find the heroin. The delinquents are escorted away in a car, but Str√§hl manages to open Caro‚Äôs door to let her escape (Her plastic-handcuffs can be cut off later). Before Ren√© entered the police station he had given a roll of Smarties to Caro. It contained a 120'000 CHF winning ‚ÄúToto‚Äù-ticket. Caro, on the run, now wants to encash the ticket as fast as possible. But the kiosk-woman isn‚Äôt allowed to pay out such a high amount of cash (the ticket has to be sent in). So Caro asks Beko, if he knew someone, who could exchange the ticket against cash within an hour. The mafia agrees (They offer 80‚Äô000 CHF) and the parties meet at a small park. The situation escalates and Caro throws a handgrenade (that Ren√© once took from a dead junkie). The grenade doesn‚Äôt go off.

Originally written in 1747 for the j≈çruri puppet theater by Takeda Izumo II, Miyoshi Sh≈çraku and Namiki Senry≈´ I, it was adapted to kabuki the following year. Adapted to Kabuki, the play was premi√®red in that mode in January 1748, in the city of Ise, in Mie Prefecture. Kataoka Nizaemon IV and Yamamoto Koheiji were two of the actors in this performance, playing Ginpei and Tadanobu/Genkur≈ç respectively. The premiere in Edo was held at the Nakamura-za in May the same year, and in Osaka at the Naka no Shibai just a few months later in August. The play is derived from the world of the Heike Monogatari, a classical epic which details the rise and fall of the Taira clan of samurai. The latter portions describe the eventual defeat of the Taira in the Genpei War (1180‚Äì85), at the hands of the Minamoto clan, led by Minamoto no Yoshitsune, the title character of this play. Yoshitsune takes place a few years after the end of the Genpei War. Minamoto no Yoshitsune, the famous general, is being pursued by agents of his brother, Minamoto no Yoritomo, who has recently established himself as sh≈çgun. Yoshitsune travels with his mistress Shizuka and loyal retainer Benkei in search of three Taira generals who escaped justice at the end of the war, and who he believes may pose a threat to the shogunate. This aspect of the plot is the primary departure from both history and from the epic. In reality, the three generals Taira no Koremori, Taira no Tomomori, and Taira no Noritsune, along with the young Emperor Antoku and his nursemaid who feature in the play, all perished in the war, most of them sacrificing themselves in the battle of Dan-no-ura.

Though this was originally intended to be performed across the better part of a day, modes of performance have changed, and the full version would today take twice that long, due to the style and speed of current forms of acting. For this reason and others, Kabuki plays are almost never performed in their entirety today, and Yoshitsune is no exception. The fullest standard version of any play is called t≈çshi ky≈çgen, which in the case of Yoshitsune consists of nine of the full fifteen scenes. However, again as is the case with most plays, individual scenes or elements of Yoshitsune may be performed alone as part of a day's program of other such bits and pieces. The first, second, and fourth scenes of Act One are the most rarely performed today. The fundamental structure of the play is very much in keeping with that of Japanese traditional drama forms as a whole. The philosophy of jo-ha-ky≈´ is employed throughout, as actions, scenes, acts, and the play as a whole begin slow (jo), then get faster (ha), and end quickly (kyu). Also, Yoshitsune follows the traditional five-act structure and the themes traditionally associated with particular acts. Act One begins calmly and auspiciously, including scenes at the Imperial Palace. Act Two features combat. Act Three is something of a sewamono insertion into the jidaimono tale, turning away from the affairs of warriors and politics to focus on the lives of commoners. Act Four is a michiyuki journey, metaphorically associated with a journey through hell. Act Five wraps up the plot quickly and returns to themes of auspiciousness. The following plot summary is based on the full fifteen-scene version. =Act One= The play opens at the Imperial Palace, where Yoshitsune and his faithful retainer, the warrior monk Benkei meet with , a court minister. They discuss the consequences of the battle of Yashima, and the fact that the bodies of several members of the Taira clan, who were supposed to have died in the battle, have not been found. Tomokata also presents Yoshitsune with a drum, called \\"Hatsune\\", supposedly used several hundred years earlier by the Emperor Kanmu, and thus a precious, rare, and powerful object. The minister describes the symbolism of this imperial gift, explaining that the two drumheads represent Yoshitsune and his brother Yoritomo. The Emperor orders that Yoshitsune strike at his brother, as he would strike the head of the drum. The following scene introduces Wakaba no Naishi, wife of Taira no Koremori, and her young son Rokudai. The pair are explained to be in hiding in a monastic hermitage near the town of Saga, and enter along with a nun who has been sheltering them in her home. A man comes to the house and is soon revealed to be Kokingo Takesato, a Taira retainer. He explains, to their surprise, that Koremori still lives, and that he has come to escort the pair to be reunited with him. Another man then arrives, this one an agent of the Court, seeking the wanted Naishi and Rokudai. Kokingo, in his disguise as a wandering hat seller, along with the nun, attempts to discourage him and turn him away; though the Imperial agent sees through the ruse, Kokingo strikes the man with a wooden pole and makes his escape, along with his two wards. Scene three takes place at Yoshitsune's mansion in the capital, where his mistress, Shizuka dances for Yoshitsune's wife Ky≈ç no Kimi and his closest retainers. She expresses her apologies on behalf of Benkei, who made some uncouth and inappropriate remarks to the Imperial agents at the presentation of the drum. Though Benkei is portrayed as cool, collected, eloquent, and quite clever in other plays, in this one he is loud, obnoxious, and violent, leaping to action without thinking. A guard enters and informs the group of an impending attack upon the mansion by forces belonging to Yoritomo, and Benkei immediately leaps to face them, but is held back by Shizuka. Yoshitsune discusses with Kawagoe Tar≈ç Shigeyori, advisor to his brother Yoritomo, the circumstances surrounding the falling-out which has occurred between him and the sh≈çgun. He explains that he reported to his brother that several Taira generals, actually still at large, had been killed, to help ensure peace and stability for the new shogunate; he also explains that though he has received the Emperor's drum, he has not struck it, and has thus symbolically not acknowledged any intention to attack his brother. This situation resolved, Kawagoe announces that he will call off the attack on Yoshitsune's mansion, but before he is able to do so, the impetuous Benkei has already leapt into action and killed one of the shogunal commanders. The act ends with Benkei's realization that Yoshitsune and Shizuka have fled. He presumes they have gone to Yoshino, and chases after them. =Act Two= \\"Genji Unukiyo-e\\" Utagawa Kuniyoshi painting. Tomomori attacks Yoshitsune and his party, but he is injured when he fights back. Act two opens at the Fushimi Inari Shrine, where Benkei catches up to Yoshitsune, Shizuka, and the four retainers. The group has fled the capital, seeking to escape retribution for Benkei's careless attack. The monk apologizes, and is forgiven by his lord, at the suggestion of Shizuka. However, Benkei then offers that since their journey will be long and dangerous, a lady such as her should not be subjected to such things and should be escorted back to the capital. She refuses, and in order to prevent her following them, or killing herself in grief, they tie her to a tree, along with the drum Hatsune, and leave her. She is found by agents of the sh≈çgun, who cuts her free and tries to drag her away. Yoshitsune's retainer Tadanobu suddenly shows up and rescues her, in a flamboyant and vigorous swordfight. He is then commended by his lord, who bestows upon him his own (Yoshitsune's) suit of armor, and his name, Genkur≈ç. The group then continue on their journey, leaving Tadanobu to escort Shizuka back to the capital. The second scene takes place at the Tokaiya, a home near Daimotsu Bay where the commoner merchant Ginpei runs a shipping business, living with his wife Ory≈´ and daughter Oyasu. Yoshitsune's party has made their lodgings here while they wait for good weather to continue their journey by boat. While talking to Ory≈´, Benkei steps over the sleeping Oyasu as he makes his way from the room; just at that moment, accompanied by dramatic drumming, he feels a pain in his leg. Shortly after Benkei leaves, Sagami Gor≈ç, a retainer of the shogunate, sent here to seek out and attack Yoshitsune, arrives. Not knowing that Yoshitsune is in that very home, Sagami demands of Ory≈´ that he be provided a boat in order to pursue his quarry. She replies that their only boat is already promised to their other guests, and a small scuffle occurs between the two as the warrior accuses the woman of harboring Taira fugitives and seeks to enter the room where Yoshitsune and his retainers remain. Just then, the merchant Ginpei makes his first entrance, carrying an anchor over his shoulder, a strong symbolic reference to his true identity as the fugitive general Taira no Tomomori. He argues briefly with Sagami, and throws the warrior out of his house. Ginpei is then introduced to his guests, who were taken in by Ory≈´ while he was out, and immediately recognizes Yoshitsune. Introducing himself briefly, and expounding on his identity as a boatman and merchant, he then suggests that they set sail, despite the weather. As Yoshitsune and his retainers dress and prepare for the journey, Ginpei has an aside in which he dramatically reveals himself to the audience as the Taira general Tomomori. Tomomori declares to the audience the story of faking his own death at Dan-no-ura and escaping with the young Emperor Antoku and his wet nurse Tsubone, living for the last several years as Ginpei, his daughter Oyasu and wife Ory≈´. He explains to Tsubone that he intends to kill Yoshitsune while out at sea, the rain and dark of night obscuring the battle. He heads out to the boat, as Tsubone and the Emperor change clothes, removing their disguises. The battle is not seen on stage, but reflected through narration, the reactions of Tsubone, as she watches from the shore, and the report of Sagami Gor≈ç, the shogunal officer who is revealed to have actually been in Tomomori's service. After some time, the clash is perceived to have ended with Tomomori's death. Tsubone takes the Emperor to the seashore, and prepares to have them both drown, sacrificing themselves. But they are pulled back by Yoshitsune as he returns to the shore, and assured of their safety; he has no intentions of capturing or killing the Emperor of Japan. Tomomori, not killed, returns just a few moments after Yoshitsune, and is appalled that his schemes have fallen apart so quickly and easily. Tsubone kills herself, seeing that she cannot serve Tomomori any longer, and the general, recognizing the futility of his schemes, his failure to slay his enemies, and the doom wrought upon his entire clan by the evil actions of his father Taira no Kiyomori, throws himself into the sea, tied to an anchor. =Act Three= Act Three opens as Wakaba no Naishi, her retainer Kokingo and son Rokudai pause at a tea shop along their journey to find her husband, Taira no Koremori. They sit down to rest, and a young man in traveling clothes, by the name of Gonta, joins them soon afterwards. He talks to them briefly, helps them get nuts from the tree, and then leaves, taking Kokingo's travelling pack instead of his own. Kokingo notices a few moments later, and Gonta returns, apologizing for his mistake. The two go through the contents of the baskets, to make sure the other hasn't stolen anything, but Gonta then claims that there's twenty ry≈ç missing from his basket. Gonta, attempting to swindle the samurai, accuses him of being a thief, and a battle very nearly breaks out. Though aggressive with words, he is no match for the samurai in a fight, and hides behind a bench while Kokingo only grows more angry and brandishes his sword. Naishi attempts to calm him down, but Gonta only eggs him on until, finally, the samurai pays him twenty ry≈ç and leaves, along with Naishi and Rokudai. Gonta is thus left alone with Kosen, the proprietess of the teahouse, who it turns out is his wife. She scolds him for being a swindler and a gambler; in his response, he explains his life story. The son of Yazaemon of the Tsurube sushi shop, he became a swindler, thief and gambler in order to support himself and his love for Kosen. Disowned and kicked out of his house, he struggled to earn money to buy Kosen out of indenture. Though he describes his intent to rob his mother that night, he is talked out of it by Kosen, and they return home. The next scene focuses on Kokingo, Rokudai and Naishi, pursued by Imperial officers. Already wounded, Kokingo fights off one of the officers, Inokuma Dainoshin, and then sinks to the ground, exhausted. As Naishi weeps over him, he claims he cannot go on, and implores Naishi and her son to forget about him, and to continue on to see Koremori. He promises to follow them after he regains his strength. The pair leave him then, and exit, continuing on their journey. The warrior then dies, just as a group of townsmen, including the sushi shop owner Yazaemon, come upon him. After saying a prayer for the dead, Yazaemon cuts off Kokingo's head and takes it with him, returning home. Yazaemon's sushi shop is the setting for the third scene, which opens with his daughter Osato and his wife preparing and selling sushi to visitors while they talk. A young man named Yasuke has been living with them for some time, and is due to be married to Osato as soon as Yazaemon returns. Yasuke enters with some sushi tubs, and talks briefly with the two women as they work, before they are interrupted by the arrival of Gonta, Osato's brother. Gonta explains to his mother that he is leaving for good, to turn himself around and make something of his life, but asks for some money, claiming that he was robbed on the road on his way there. She places several silver kanme coins in a sushi tub for him and sends him off. Just then, Yazaemon returns; fearing that he should learn that his wife stole from the shop to give to Gonta, they hide the sushi tub among the others. Yazaemon then comes in, calls out for his family, and hides the head of Kokingo, wrapped in his cloak, in one of the other tubs. Meeting up with Yasuke, Yazaemon then reveals to the audience Yasuke's identity as the general Taira no Koremori, father of Rokudai and husband of Naishi, who he came across in Kumano and took into his home. He explains to Koremori that he just came across Kajiwara Kagetoki, an agent of the shogunate, who suspected him of harboring the general, and that for his safety he might flee the area. As Osato and Yasuke (Koremori) lie on their wedding bed, preparing to consummate their relationship, he confesses to her not his true identity, but that he has a wife and child in another province, and asks that she release him from his pledge to marry her. By coincidence, the wandering Wakaba no Naishi then arrives at that same house, seeking lodging for the night. Koremori glances outside, realizes who they are, and welcomes them in. He attempts to explain his infidelity to his wife, his romance with Osato coming from a desire to repay Yazaemon for taking him in; Osato overhears, and bursts into sobs. She welcomes Rokudai and Naishi into her home, offering them the seats of honor, and explains her side of the story, asking for forgiveness from Naishi. She fell in love with this gentle man, she explains, whom her father brought home, not knowing that he was secretly a noble. Upset at Koremori's duplicity and at his leaving her, she weeps and is comforted by Naishi. Word comes of the arrival of shogunal officers, and Koremori, his wife and child exit. Gonta arrives, then, declaring to Osato that he intends to turn over the three to the authorities in exchange for a reward. His sister begs him not to, and he grabs the sushi tub with the silver coins and flees after the three. Soldiers then appear, along with Kajiwara, and surround Yazaemon. They accuse him of lying to them, and harboring Koremori; but thinking quickly, he tells them that he's already had a change of heart and killed Koremori himself. He brings the men inside, and reaches for the sushi tub with Kokingo's head in it, but is stopped by his wife, who is thinking of the money she stole from him to give to Gonta. A shout is heard from outside, as Gonta returns with a woman and child, tied up and being dragged behind him. He explains to the soldiers that he has captured Rokudai and Naishi, and shows them the tub containing Kokingo's head, claiming it to be Koremori's. Kajiwara offers to spare Yazaemon's life in exchange for this deed, but Gonta, hoping to gain from this himself, declares that he wants monetary compensation; Kajiwara therefore gives him his cloak, which previously belonged to Yoritomo, and which would be symbolic of the reward owed him by the government. As Kajiwara leads the prisoners away, Yazaemon finds the opportunity to viciously stab his son, bitter at Gonta's betrayal. Yazaemon curses his son as he aggravates the wound, but as he dies, Gonta explains to his father that his deceptions were for good intentions all along. He claims that he intended to give the silver to Koremori for traveling expenses. Knowing that his father intended to play off Kokingo's head as Koremori's, and knowing that the head was no longer in the house, he returned in order to rescue his father's plan, and his family therefore. He then reveals that the woman and child turned over were not Naishi and Rokudai but his own wife and child, Kosen and Zenta, who willingly and voluntarily sacrificed themselves to save the nobles. Koremori, Naishi, and Rokudai then return, alive and safe, disguised as tea merchants. Koremori finds a poem on Yoritomo's cloak which indicates that something is inside it; cutting it open, he finds a Buddhist monk's robe. Seemingly, Kajiwara intended all along to spare Koremori, and granted him in this indirect way a disguise with which to safely escape. Koremori cuts off his topknot, becomes a lay monk, and separates himself from both his families for the final time. Yazaemon offers to accompany Rokudai and Naishi, and Osato stays with her mother, loyally maintaining the home and the shop in her father's absence. The act ends with Gonta's death, one of the most famous examples in Japanese traditional drama of the interference of the affairs of nobles and samurai into the lives of common people, and the death and destruction it brings. =Act Four= A scene (act 4) from the kabuki play 'Yoshitsune senbon zakura' performed at the Kawarasaki theatre in the autumn of 1847. The fourth act begins with a michiyuki dance scene, which follows Shizuka as she seeks to catch up with Yoshitsune and his party. The journey is narrated by an offstage narrator, in the bunraku style, and there is very little dialogue. As she travels through the countryside, Shizuka decides to play the Hatsune Drum, in order to entice birds to follow her, not knowing the magical or metaphorical significance of the drum. As soon as she does so, a white fox emerges, romps across the stage and then disappears behind a low hill, from which emerges Tadanobu. Placing the drum atop Yoshitsune's armor, granted Tadanobu in the second act, the two dance, their gestures and motions mimicking the actions of the narration. The narration indicates their desire to follow Yoshitsune to Yoshino, and then drifts into a retelling of the events of the battle of Dan- no-ura, ending with the pair's arrival at a Buddhist temple, the Za≈ç Hall in Yoshino. After a very brief scene showing the pair's arrival, attention is shifted to Kawatsura H≈çgen, head of the temple, who discusses with his fellow monks what stance they should take towards Yoshitsune. Several of the monks here are known to be enemies of Yoshitsune, and a letter has just arrived from the capital asking them to hunt him down. The monks discuss, and even those normally hostile to Yoshitsune decide that as monks it is their duty to aid people in need. H≈çgen, however, even after admitting that he thinks Yoshitsune blameless, fires an arrow at a distant peak, smaller than its neighboring peak, and thus representing the younger brother (Yoshitsune). Thus he declares his stance alongside the shogunate, for the safety of the temple. H≈çgen encourages his monks to do what they think is right: to welcome Yoshitsune in and grant him asylum if he should arrive and request it. But he also assures them that he intends to kill the warrior should they do so. The monks interpret their master's words to mean that he is already harboring Yoshitsune, and that he intended to throw them off and prevent their interference; they decide to find and attack the warrior that night. H≈çgen returns to his mansion, where he is indeed harboring Yoshitsune, and declares to his wife that he has turned against his guest, and intends to stand with the shogunate. Yoshitsune speaks briefly with H≈çgen, thanking him for his hospitality and aid, and is then informed that his retainer, Sat≈ç Tadanobu has arrived and wishes to speak with him. Tadanobu is asked by his lord about his stewardship of Shizuka and replies, confused, that he has been in his home province with his ailing mother since the end of the war, and has not seen Shizuka. Two of Yoshitsune's other retainers appear, pointing swords at Tadanobu and demanding an explanation when the temple's gatekeeper announces that Sat≈ç Tadanobu has arrived with Lady Shizuka. Shizuka is reunited with her lord, but the Tadanobu who had been escorting her seems to vanish. The first Tadanobu explains to Shizuka that he has not been escorting her and has not seen her in some time; the other retainers confirm that this second Tadanobu is nowhere to be found in the building. She then notices that this Tadanobu is wearing somewhat different clothing, and comes upon the idea of beating the Hatsune Drum to summon her escort. She explains that the drum always attracted her escort, and made him behave strangely. The scene ends as she bangs the drum, and Tadanobu is taken away by Yoshitsune's retainers. The final scene thus begins with Shizuka beating the drum, and a fox rushes into the room, becoming Tadanobu, who bows before her. Shizuka then suddenly pulls a sword and slashes at Tadanobu, who dodges the attack. Mesmerized by the drum, Tadanobu still manages to avoid continued attacks as Shizuka demands that he reveal his identity. He then tells his story, revealing in the process that he is a kitsune, a fox spirit. The drum was made hundreds of years earlier from the skins of his parents, powerful kitsune whose magic was employed to bring rain. A costume quick-change transforms Tadanobu into his kitsune form, who explains that though he has lived a very long time and gained magical powers, he has been unable to ever care for his parents. Failing to fulfill acts of filial piety prevents him from gaining respect or status among the kitsune, and so for centuries he has sought out this drum. He was unable to get at the drum when it was kept in the imperial palace, he explains, since the palace is guarded against spirits by many gods (kami), but once it was removed from the palace and given to Yoshitsune, he saw his chance. Shizuka and Yoshitsune speak to the fox for a time, and decide to grant him the drum. Thus released, he exits in grand style. Originally this would have been done through a particular style of dance called kitsune roppo (fox six-steps) along the hanamichi (the pathway that cuts through the audience from stage to the rear of the theatre). However, more recently it has become the practice, encouraged by Ichikawa Ennosuke III who often plays the fox Genkur≈ç to exit by flying out over the audience, in a technique known as ch≈´nori (riding the sky). The real Tadanobu then offers to take his lord's place in facing the doom that awaits him at the hands of the monks. The kitsune's magic hampers the monk's schemes, and Kakuhan, the one monk who most strongly opposed the samurai lord, is revealed to be Taira no Noritsune, the third surviving Taira general, in disguise. Noritsune and Yoshitsune clash swords several times before Emperor Antoku appears from the next room. Noritsune, of course, bows low to his Emperor, and both explain how they survived their supposed deaths at the battle of Yashima, and came to be at this monastery. Noritsune then begins weeping, announcing his failure to his clan and to his Emperor. H≈çgen and two of Yoshitsune's retainers come in with bloody blades and holding the severed heads of the other monks who followed Noritsune. They seek to fight, but their hearts are calmed by the fox's magic, and Noritsune announces that he shall once again become Yokawa no Kakuhan, a loyal servant to the Emperor. =Act Five= As is quite standard for Japanese traditional dramas, the final act is short, swift, and serves to wrap up any major loose plot threads. Here, it opens on a mountaintop, with Tadanobu, dressed as Yoshitsune, calling out a challenge to those who side with Yoritomo and the shogunate. A number of warriors come at him, and he cuts them down. Noritsune then appears, as the monk Kakuhan, who claims to have foregone all his old grudges, and his warrior ways. Tadanobu declares his true identity to his foe, and the two clash in a complex choreographed fight scene. Finally, Noritsune pins his opponent to the ground, but a second Tadanobu rushes in and stabs the Taira general, the body below him disappearing and leaving only a suit of armor. Yoshitsune explains that they saw through Noritsune's promises of peace, and the fox Genkur≈ç aided them in subduing him. Kawagoe, an agent of the shogunate, then appears, along with Fujiwara no Tomokata, who he has tied up. He reveals that the Imperial order which came with the drum, ordering Yoshitsune to oppose his brother, along with that to exterminate the Taira clan, came not from the Emperor, but from the machinations of Tomokata. Hearing this, Noritsune kills the defenseless Tomokata, and then turns to Yoshitsune, challenging his foe to kill him. Yoshitsune states that Noritsune died long ago, that he has since become Kakuhan, and that it is to Tadanobu to kill him. The play thus ends with the last of Yoshitsune's foes slain, and a return to the peace and auspiciousness with which the play began.

They are normally motivated by considering an even number of reflections, which generate rotations (see also the Cartan‚ÄìDieudonn√© theorem). The term originated with William Kingdon Clifford, in showing that the quaternion algebra is just a special case of Hermann Grassmann's \\"theory of extension\\" (Ausdehnungslehre). Hestenes Hestenes uses the notation R^\\\\dagger for the reverse. defined a rotor to be any element R of a geometric algebra that can be written as the product of an even number of unit vectors and satisfies \\\\tilde{R} R = 1, where \\\\tilde{R} is the \\"reverse\\" of R‚Äîthat is, the product of the same vectors, but in reverse order. Generation using reflections =General formulation= Reflections along a vector in geometric algebra may be represented as (minus) sandwiching a multivector M between a non-null vector v perpendicular to the hyperplane of reflection and that vector's inverse v‚àí1: :-vMv^{-1} and are of even grade. Under a rotation generated by the rotor R, a general multivector M will transform double-sidedly as :RMR^{-1}. =Restricted alternative formulation= For a Euclidean space, it may be convenient to consider an alternative formulation, and some authors define the operation of reflection as (minus) the sandwiching of a unit (i.e. normalized) multivector: :-vMv, \\\\quad v^2=1 , forming rotors that are automatically normalised: :R\\\\tilde{R}=\\\\tilde{R}R=1 . The derived rotor action is then expressed as a sandwich product with the reverse: :RM\\\\tilde{R} For a reflection for which the associated vector squares to a negative scalar, as may be the case with a pseudo-Euclidean space, such a vector can only be normalized up to the sign of its square, and additional bookkeeping of the sign of the application the rotor becomes necessary. The formulation in terms of the sandwich product with the inverse as above suffers no such shortcoming. =Rotations of multivectors and spinors= However, though as multivectors rotors also transform double-sidedly, rotors can be combined and form a group, and so multiple rotors compose single-sidedly. The alternative formulation above is not self-normalizing and motivates the definition of spinor in geometric algebra as an object that transforms single-sidedly ‚Äì i.e. spinors may be regarded as non-normalised rotors in which the reverse rather than the inverse is used in the sandwich product.

Two forms are recognised, acute and chronic (cirrhosis). Recently, a third form of liver failure known as acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is increasingly being recognized.  Acute  Acute liver failure is defined as \\"the rapid development of hepatocellular dysfunction, specifically coagulopathy and mental status changes (encephalopathy) in a patient without known prior liver disease\\".:1557 The disease process is associated with the development of a coagulopathy of liver aetiology, and clinically apparent altered level of consciousness due to hepatic encephalopathy. Several important measures are immediately necessary when the patient presents for medical attention. The diagnosis of acute liver failure is based on physical exam, laboratory findings, patient history, and past medical history to establish mental status changes, coagulopathy, rapidity of onset, and absence of known prior liver disease respectively.:1557 The exact definition of \\"rapid\\" is somewhat questionable, and different sub-divisions exist which are based on the time from onset of first hepatic symptoms to onset of encephalopathy. One scheme defines \\"acute hepatic failure\\" as the development of encephalopathy within 26 weeks of the onset of any hepatic symptoms. This is sub-divided into \\"fulminant hepatic failure\\", which requires onset of encephalopathy within 8 weeks, and \\"subfulminant\\", which describes onset of encephalopathy after 8 weeks but before 26 weeks. Another scheme defines \\"hyperacute\\" as onset within 7 days, \\"acute\\" as onset between 7 and 28 days, and \\"subacute\\" as onset between 28 days and 24 weeks.:1557  Chronic  Chronic liver failure usually occurs in the context of cirrhosis, itself potentially the result of many possible causes, such as excessive alcohol intake, hepatitis B or C, autoimmune, hereditary and metabolic causes (such as iron or copper overload, steatohepatitis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). Acute on chronic \\"Acute on chronic liver failure\\" is said to exist when someone with chronic liver disease develops features of liver failure.

In the 2001 government census the parish as a whole had 1,909 inhabitants.UK National Statistics, 2001 It is home to a Welcome Break service station of the same name.  History  A once tiny settlement consisting of but a few farms and barn buildings, over the 20th and 21st centuries the hamlet grew substantially and consequently is now a quiet residential area popular with commuters to the nearby town of Rotherham and the city of Sheffield. The growth was in part due to the opening of Kiveton Park coal pit in 1864, the slag heap of which can still clearly be seen to the North-East of the hamlet. The hamlet consists of two lanes, Dowcarr to the South and Walseker to the North, straddling the link road from High Moor, Killamarsh, to Harthill called Woodall Lane (occasionally Killamarsh Lane).  Amenities  The hamlet has no amenities such as shops or pubs, instead inhabitants rely on the village of Harthill approximately one mile away, which has two pubs, a church, a junior school and a shopping precinct. Woodall does have several popular walks nearby including several through the local wood, Norwood, towards the village of Killamarsh and around the several ponds within the wood itself. With the village situated on a slight ridge the inhabitants also enjoy fantastic views over Sheffield (c.10‚Äì15 miles away) and to the hills of the Peak District beyond.  Woodall services  Woodall is perhaps most famous for its motorway service area on the M1 motorway (Woodall services) and the hamlet itself is less than one mile from the carriageway.  Trivia  Justin Wilson (racing driver), the late Formula 1, ChampCar and IndyCar driver, came from Woodall. It was allegedly hit by a V-2 rocket (most likely heading towards the steel factories of Sheffield) in the Second World War. A crater can be seen on a nearby hill, however reports are sketchy at best and must be viewed with some degree of scepticism.

Biography  A rock & roll Spaniard was called, Adolfo \\"Fito\\" Cabrales. He was born on 6 October 1966 in the Zabala neighbourhood in Bilbao, and spent part of his childhood and adolescence in Laredo, Cantabria, and M√°laga. In his youth he worked as a barman in the brothel his father owned. In these early periods of his musical career he admits to having consumed drugs, although now he declares himself \\"clean\\". A Spanish guitarist plays in the original and concert songs in Bilbao. In 1989 Fito joined I√±aki \\"Uoho\\" Ant√≥n, Juantxu \\"Mongol\\" Olano and Jes√∫s \\"Maguila\\" Garc√≠a, raised also in Fito's neighborhood, and formed the group Platero y T√∫. They recorded their first album in 1991, Voy a acabar borracho (\\"I will end up drunk\\"). During the 90s, Platero made a name in the Spanish rock scene, and formed links to other important artists such as La Polla Records (Evaristo has a collaboration in the song Juliette), Rosendo Mercado (Sin soluci√≥n) and, most prominently, the group Extremoduro, with whom they made a joint tour in 1996. In 1998, and in parallel to Platero y T√∫, the group Fito & Fitipaldis is formed, with the aim of publishing the songs that do not fit in the Platero repertoire. At first both groups coexisted without problems, but after Platero y T√∫ dissolved in 2001, Fito worked exclusively in his new group, obtaining an even greater success. Fito is remarkable both in style and personality. He is thin and short (about 1.64 m and 50 kg), usually wears long sideboards and a shaven scalp. He is nearly always seen wearing a flat cap, which he used to give away after concerts (when he was with Platero y T√∫.) He currently lives in the town of Guernica, Biscay. Fito received a Latin Grammy nomination in 2015 for Best Rock Song for \\"Entre la Espada y Pared\\".  Influences  Despite the differences between the Platero y T√∫ rock & roll, and the blues, soul and jazz mix of Fito & Fitipaldis, Fito has always sung of personal stories, often revolving around night-life, bars, drugs and women. He refers to his time working in a brothel and other run-down areas of Bilbao in some of his songs: in the Platero y T√∫ album Muy deficiente, there is a song devoted to the Cantalojas bridge, and a \\"girl of the Cortes\\" (a prostitute in the neighborhood by that name.)

Cap., was later the only active American diocesan bishop of Native American descent.Biography and Curriculum Vitae of Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap., D.D. He is also the only known Roman Catholic bishop to have ordained his own twin brother. Bishop Pelotte ordained Father Dana F. Pelotte, SSS, to the priesthood, on September 4, 1999 in their childhood parish of Waterville, Maine. Education Pelotte was born on April 13, 1945, in Waterville, Maine, to Norris Albert Pelotte and Margaret Yvonne LaBrie Pelotte. His father was a member of the Abenaki First Nations tribe and his mother was of French-Canadian (Qu√©b√©cois) descent. Donald and his twin brother Dana were the youngest of five brothers. He studied at Eymard Seminary in Hyde Park, New York during his high school years. He did his college studies John Carroll University in Cleveland, Ohio and later completed doctoral studies at Fordham University. His doctoral dissertation was entitled: John Courtney Murray, Theologian in Conflict: Roman Catholicism and the American Experience. This was later published in book form by Paulist Press. At age 33, he became the Provincial Superior of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament and was the youngest major superior of a religious community of men in the United States at the time. On February 24, 1986, he was named Coadjutor Bishop of Gallup and was consecrated on May 6, 1986. Upon the retirement of Jerome J. Hastrich, then Bishop of Gallup on March 31, 1990, Pelotte became the Third Bishop of Gallup. From 1986 to 2008, Pelotte also served as the Episcopal moderator of the Tekakwitha Conference, an association of Native American and First Nation Catholics.Tekakwitha Conference History . Retrieved 2008-07-01. Later life Bishop Pelotte was seriously injured in his Gallup home on July 23, 2007. His injuries included a traumatic brain injury. According to chancery officials and a police report, Pelotte insisted his injuries resulted from a fall down his home staircase; however, his aide speculated that he \\"looked like he'd been beat up\\" and that his injuries were more consistent with a brutal assault rather than with a fall down a carpeted stairwell. On January 3, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Thomas J. Olmsted, Bishop of Phoenix, as apostolic administrator sede plena of the diocese of Gallup, and granted Pelotte a one-year leave of absence to continue his recovery. On April 30, 2008 Pope Benedict XVI accepted the resignation from the pastoral government of the Diocese of Gallup, presented by Pelotte in accordance with canon 401 ¬ß 2 of the Code of Canon Law.Cf. Holy See Press Office, Daily Bulletin of 30.04.2008, Rinunce e nomine, Rinuncia del Vescovo di Gallup (U.S.A.) Bishop Olmsted continued to govern the diocese as Apostolic Administrator until James S. Wall was appointed bishop of Gallup and took canonical possession of the Diocese on 23 April 2009. On Monday, July 8, 2008, KRQE News 13 in Albuquerque and the Gallup Independent newspaper released the results of their investigation of the Pelotte case. Pictures that had not been previously released to the public suggested that the bishop suffered severe blows to the head and back.

In a series of papers published between 1918 and 1928, he developed and expanded a generalized theory of integration and differentiation, which is today known as the Daniell integral. In the setting of integration, he also worked on results that lead to the Daniell-Kolmogorov extension theorem in the theory of stochastic processes, independently of Andrey Kolmogorov.J. Aldrich, But you have to remember PJ Daniell of Sheffield, Electronic Journal for History of Probability and Statistics, Vol. 3, number 2, 2007 He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1920 at Strasbourg. Daniell was born in Valparaiso, Chile. His family returned to England in 1895. Daniell attended King Edward's School, Birmingham and proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge (where he was the last Senior Wrangler in 1909). At this time Daniell was an applied mathematician/theoretical physicist. For a year he lectured at the University of Liverpool and then he was appointed to the new Rice Institute in Houston, Texas. The Rice Institute had him spend a year at the University of G√∂ttingen studying with Max Born and David Hilbert. Daniell was at Rice from 1914 to 1923 when he returned to England to a chair at the University of Sheffield. During World War II Daniell advised the British Ministry of Supply. The strain of work during the war took a heavy toll on his health. He died on 25 May 1946, after having collapsed at his home a few weeks earlier.  External links  Aldrich, J.

The Bretons are the descendants of insular Britons who settled in Brittany from at least the third century. While the Britons were already Christianised in this era, the migrant population maintained an ancient Celtic mythos, similar to those of Wales and Cornwall. Breton mythology has many gods and mythical creatures specifically associated with nature cults. In this tradition of gods and creatures rooted in nature, there exist traces of certain Breton Catholic saints. This mythological background was accepted by Romans who were soon Christianized, resulting in the irrevocable loss of grand epics and the destruction or conversion of pagan landmarks and places. * Ankou * Bugul Noz * Korrigan * Annard Noz * Morgens * Morvan, legendary chief of the Viscounty of L√©on * Ys See also * Cornish mythology * French mythology * Matter of Britain * Welsh mythology References External links *Timeless Myths: Armorican Connections *Legends and Romances of Brittany by Lewis Spence 1917 Category:Celtic mythology ","title":"Breton mythology"},{"id":"9807944","text":"The History of England from the Accession of James the Second (1848) is the full title of the five-volume work by Lord Macaulay (1800‚Äì1859) more generally known as The History of England. It covers the 17-year period from 1685 to 1702, encompassing the reign of James II, the Glorious Revolution, the coregency of William III and Mary II, and up to William III's death. Macaulay's approach to writing the History was innovative for his period. He consciously fused the picturesque, dramatic style of classical historians such as Thucydides and Tacitus with the learned and factual approach of his 18th century precursors such as Hume, following the plan laid out in his own 1828 \\"Essay on History\\".\\"History\\", Edinburgh Review, May 1828, pp. 331-349. Reputation The History is famous for its brilliant ringing prose and for its confident, sometimes dogmatic, emphasis on a progressive model of British history. According to this view, England threw off superstition, autocracy and confusion to create a balanced constitution and a forward-looking culture combined with freedom of belief and expression. This model of human progress has been called the Whig interpretation of history. Macaulay's approach has been criticised by later historians for its one-sidedness and its complacency. Karl Marx referred to him as a \\"systematic falsifier of history\\".Karl Marx, Das Kapital, ch. 27, p. 877: \\"I quote Macaulay, because as a systematic falsifier of history he minimizes facts of this kind as much as possible\\" His tendency to see history as a drama led him to treat figures whose views he opposed as if they were villains, while his approved characters were presented as heroes. Macaulay goes to considerable length, for example, to absolve his hero King William III of any responsibility for the Glencoe massacre (1692).

Founded in 1883 by the state of Texas, built by inmates, to haul freight. Regular service on the line was ended in 1921. The state leased the line to private companies until 1969 then turned it over to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in 1972. In 2007, the railroad was transferred to the Texas State Railroad Authority and is now privately operating as a scenic tourist line. It is currently operated on a limited, year-round schedule. History The start of the railroad dates back to 1883, with the completion of the Rusk Penitentiary in Rusk, Tx. Built with inmate labor, the original purpose of the railroad was to transport raw materials for the iron smelter located at the Rusk Penitentiary. In 1906, the line reached Maydelle, and by 1909, the line was completed when it reached Palestine. The railroad grew and eventually expanded to freight and passenger service, but it was not profitable. Regular train service by the state ceased in 1921, and the line was leased to various railroad companies until 1969. In 1972, the Texas Legislature turned the railroad over to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to be used as a state park. However, by 2006, the train cost the state of Texas $1 million per year more to maintain and to operate than the revenue from the park generated. Because of budget concerns, the Eightieth Texas Legislature (2007) passed Senate Bill 1659 which allowed for the creation of an operating authority for the train with the power to lease the train to a private operator. On September 1, 2007, the operation was transferred to the Texas State Railroad Authority and leased for operation by American Heritage Railway, which also operates the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad in Colorado and the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad in North Carolina. In August 2012 American Heritage Railways sold the Texas State Railroad to Iowa Pacific Holdings. In addition to continuing passenger operations, Iowa Pacific Holdings opened the track to the main line in Palestine on November 1, 2012 to begin offering freight services.https://www.texasstaterr.com/about.php#history A leading supporter of keeping the railroad operational is Texas State Representative Byron Cook of Corsicana. The Western Group replaced Iowa Pacific Holdings as operator in May 2017. The varied schedule of the railroad allows visitors to ride trains pulled by diesel and steam locomotives between the park's Victorian-style depots and through the forests of East Texas. The railroad also has a long history of film and television productions, such as episodes of NBC's Revolution.

Background Born on 11 November 1916, he studied law and political science at the University of Rostock and the University of G√∂ttingen, from where he received a doctorate in law (Dr. jur.) in 1951. For years he served as a Finance Court judge in Hamburg. He was the author of numerous articles on legal and historical subjects. During the Second World War he served from mid- July to mid-September 1944 as an Ordonnanzoffizier (orderly officer) on the staff of an anti-aircraft detachment stationed near the Auschwitz camp. As part of his duties, he maintained contact with the SS camp command, and had unlimited access to the Auschwitz main camp, where the command was headquartered. Holocaust denial charges In 1974 a disciplinary hearing was conducted against St√§glich, then a financial judge, owing to his membership in the far-right NPD party and his incessant publications in far-right magazines; the result was a forced early retirement . with a reduced pension for five years. In 1979 the T√ºbingen-based Grabert Verlag published St√§glich's book Der Auschwitz-Mythos - Legende oder Wirklichkeit (The Auschwitz Myth ‚Äì Legend or Reality), in which he denied the existence of gas chambers in the Nazi concentration camps and death camps, and claimed that all documents relating to the Holocaust were forgeries. As early as 1980 this book was seized nationwide on the order of the state court of Stuttgart,Mit Eifer und Freude im KZ Der Spiegel, 26 January 1981. Retrieved 11 September 2010. and in 1982 it was placed on a list of materials that may not be distributed to young readers, following a decision by Germany's Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons. The decision to confiscate the book was upheld by the Federal Court of Justice in 1983. Following this, the University of G√∂ttingen instituted proceedings against St√§glich in order to formally discredit the doctoral degree he had received there in 1951, , ironically on the basis of a law promulgated during the Hitler era. Eckhard Jesse, a German political scientist and authority on radical politics, has defended the publication of the book The Auschwitz Myth. St√§glich, he says, was stripped of his doctoral title because it was deemed to be undeserved, under a law dating from 1939. Jesse: \\"Even those who see his work as anti-Semitic ‚Äì and here comes the warning ‚Äì must question these decisions for two reasons. Firstly it is patronising to the public, who are assumed to lack judgement, hardly evidence of liberality; second, the far-right sees the decision as an affirmation, and outsiders might also believe, that there 'must be something' to St√§glich's arguments. You get the impression an example is being made [of St√§glich].\\" . Original quotation: \\"Dem Autor ist 1983 von der Universit√§t G√∂ttingen aufgrund eines Gesetzes von 1939 wegen Unw√ºrdigkeit der Doktortitel aberkannt worden. Auch wer dessen Arbeit als antisemitisch ansieht ‚Äì hier ist das Monitum angebracht ‚Äì, muss aus zwei Gr√ºnden diese Entscheidungen Bedenken anmelden. Erstens ist Bevormundung des B√ºrgers, dem fehlendes Urteilsverm√∂gen unterstellt wird, kein Beleg f√ºr Liberalit√§t; zweitens sieht sich der Rechtsextremismus best√§tigt, und Au√üenstehende k√∂nnten glauben, an des Thesen St√§glichs sei ‚Äûdoch etwas dran‚Äú. Man hat den Eindruck, ein Exempel solle statuiert werden.\\" For years St√§glich was a member of the Editorial Advisory Committee of the Institute for Historical Review's Journal of Historical Review. His address in 1983 at the Fifth Conference of the Institute for Historical Review was published in the Spring 1984 issue of the IHR's journal. In 1986 an English-language edition of his book was published by the IHR under the title Auschwitz: A Judge Looks at the Evidence. St√§glich appeared together with J√ºrgen Rieger as a speaker at a far-right event commemorating the Holocaust denier Thies Christophersen, who died in 1997. In February 2015, Germar Rudolf's Castle Hill Publishers reissued St√§glich's book Auschwitz: A Judge Looks at the Evidence, and it is a \\"corrected and slightly revised\\" edition.

The river, which is shallow and wide until just before the rock formations, is forced to flow through some narrow crevices in the large rocks and to flow over shallower rocks, which increases its momentum and creates a great deal of turbulence. Nevertheless, this turbulence will not be visible on the surface. Although not a popular waterfall destination in the exact sense of the word, water and rocks together make for a picturesque scene at Panieli Poru, a little-known spot on the eastern tracts of Ernakulam district. Situated along the Malayattoor forest tracts, 20 km from Perumbavoor, the place casts an enchanting spell that mesmerises the visitor. The Periyar gushes along the rocky terrain here. The rivulets of the Periyar, having separated upstream, join hands at the spot and continue the onward journey. The flowing water makes a symphony along with the chirping of the birds in the nearby forest. It is indeed an alluring locale for those who have a love for natures splendour. The locale attracts a steady stream of visitors from around the world. However extreme precaution should be taken while visiting the place since there are numerous accidents and deaths have occurred in the area majorly due to undercurrents . Nearly 89 deaths have occurred at the tourist spot in the last 2 decades. Currently the tourism department has installed warning sign boards and local guards from \\" Vana samrakshana samathi\\" to ensure safety of the tourists.https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a-tourist-destination- vulnerable-to-accidents/article6096884.ece References Category:Waterfalls of Kerala Category:Geography of Ernakulam district ","title":"Panieli Poru waterfalls"},{"id":"9808182","text":"Terry and Julian is a British sitcom that aired on Channel 4 in 1992.

It is situated in the Steinerud neighborhood of the Oslo, Norway, borough of Vestre Aker. Located from Stortinget, the station is served by Line 1 of the metro every fifteen minutes. Travel time to Stortinget is seven minutes. Diakonhjemmet Hospital falls within the station's catchment area. The station opened in 1900. Originally named Diakonhjemmet, it received a station building in Swiss chalet style. It took the current name in 1936. With an average 196 weekday boarding passengers, Steinerud is among the least-used station of the metro. Ruter has proposed closing the station and replacing it and Fr√∏en with a new one closer to the hospital. History The Holmenkollen Line opened in 1898, but originally did not have a stop at Steinerud. Diakonhjemmet Hospital was opened in 1900, and there was a need for a station to serve it. A site at found at the intersection of Stasjonsveien, Lille Borgenveien and Sverrestien. Slemdalsveien cross the Holmenkollen Line at the station. Initially there was easy access to the hospital. The station opened in 1900, originally named Diakonhjemmet. In addition to platforms, Holmenkolbanen built a station building at the station. It was mostly used as a residence, although it originally had a waiting room on the ground floor. It is not known how long the building served as a waiting room. The Telje-Torp-Aasen shed and the Swiss chalet style station building After a while the intersection at the station proved to be hazardous, and the level crossing was closed. This caused many visitors to not find their way to the hospital. Visitors were therefore encouraged to instead use Fr√∏en which, although further away, was easier to find. This led to the need for a new name for the station. The hospital was built on the grounds of a farm named Steinerud. The name was met with some opposition, as many locals preferred the more conservative form Stenerud. The station was upgraded in the 1970s with a standard concrete shed. Service The station is served by Line 1 of the Oslo Metro. During regular hours, it operates at a 15-minute headway. Travel time to Stortinget is seven minutes. Operations are carried out by Sporveien T-banen on contract with Ruter, the public transport authority in Oslo and Akershus. The infrastructure itself is owned by Sporveien, a municipal company. Service is provided using MX3000 three-car trains. The station had an average 196 boarding passengers in 2008. This is fourth-lowest for the Holmenkollen Line and amongst the lowest for the metro overall. Steinerud is located in fare zone 1. Facilities The inbound platform during the 2010 renovations of the station Steinerud is a rapid transit station situated on the Holmenkollen Line, from Stortinget in the city center. It is situated at an elevation of above mean sea level. The platforms are much shorter than the norm for the metro and only have space for two cars. They are parallel and were both originally built in granite. They have since been raised and lengthened with concrete, wood and asphalt. On the platform serving trains towards the city center there is a prefabricated shed designed by Telje-Torp-Aasen. It is built on a foundation which indicates that a wooden shed designed by Erik Glosimodt was to be placed there, but it is uncertain if this structure was ever built. Just north of the platforms is a level crossing for pedestrians. The station building was a multi-apartment house built in Swiss chalet style, common for the period and area. The building is two full stories and has a half-story with a gabled roof. It has wooden paneling. It was a prefabricated by Str√∏mmen Tr√¶varefabrik, and an identical station building was built at Gaustad Station. Future Ruter has announced that it intends to close Steinerud Station. Both Fr√∏en and Steinerud serve Diakonhjemmet Hospital. Neither is located particularly close, with the hospital being located about midway between the two stops. Both stations also have limitations and are difficult to modernize and expand as they are located on curves. Ruter has therefore proposed spending 150 million Norwegian kroner on a new station which would be about midway between the two and be situated next to the hospital. Sporveien plans to remove the level crossing at the station when the line is fully upgraded.

His name is mostly spelled as Johannes Baptista Zangrius, but is also known as de Sanger, de Zangre, Zangre, and Zangr√©.  Biographical data  He was active in Leuven between 1595 and 1606 and by all probability he was a relative of the publishers and typographists Petrus (1559‚Äì1623) and Philippus Zangrius (1585‚Äì1610). In 1601, Zangrius engraved the portraits of Infante Isabella, her husband archduke Albrecht Habsburg, governor of the Low Countries, and Justus Lipsius. These engravings were also part of his 1602 (or 1605) work titled Album Amicorum containing 67 engravings, namely 46 womanly costumes and armorial cartouches, 9 small and 11 bigger armorial engravings. It is one of the earliest examples of heraldic pavilions (by all probability after Jean-Jacques Boissard). The small armorial shields are empty. The womanly costumes were engraved after the tables of Julius Goltzius, to be found in the following title: Jean Jacques Boissard, Habitvs Variarvm Orbis gentium. Habitz de Nations estra:[n]ges. Trachten mancherley Voelcker des Erdskreysz, Cum Priuilegio Caesaro, Cum Priuilegio Regio, 1581 [Mechelen, Caspar Rutz]  Zangrius in heraldry  According to some authors, Zangrius developed the earliest hatching system in heraldry, identical with the present day hatching method, seen on his armorial chart of Brabant. (Jean Baptiste Zangre, Representation de l'Ancienne et Souveraine Duche de Brabant, ses Villes, Dignitez et Dependences, Comme Lothier, Limborghe et Pays de Outre Meuse, Louvain, 1600. Measures: 49 x 56.3 cm). Though manufactured by Arnold van Rincvelt, it is better known as the armorial chart of Zangrius. The original chart is held by the Helmond Castle-Townhall. The armorial chart of Zangrius was first published in the 81st volume (1964) of the De Nederlandsche Leeuw by F. J. van Ettro. He maintains that the present-day hatching system was invented by Zangrius. The historical background for the coming into existence of the armorial chart was the 6 March 1598 edict of the Spanish king Philip II who detached the Low Countries in his testament from Spain and gave independence to the Netherlands on the occasion of the marriage of his daughter Infante Isabella to archduke Albrecht Habsburg who served as the governor of the province since 1596. The princely consorts marched across Brussels ceremoniously on 5 September 1599. As Albrecht Habsburg died in 1621 without heirs, the country returned to the Spanish crown, as was stated in the treaty. (For another engraving from 1623, portraying Albrecht's funeral procession, see the picture taken from Jacob Franquart.) Albrecht's proclamation of the sovereignty was illustrated by numerous armorial charts published by several cities and noblemen of the Low Countries, and the armorial chart of Zangrius held in the Helmond Castle- Townhall is one of them. F. J. van Ettro maintained: \\"Particularly noteworthy about this chart is, that the metals gold and silver, and the colours red, blue, green and black, are rendered according to the same system of hatching by means of dots and stripes, as is being used to this day in modern heraldry\\". (op. cit. p. 211) However, the hatching systems of Silvester Petra Sancta (1638) and Marcus Vulson de la Colombi√®re (1639), respectively differ from the method developed by Zangrius in the way of hatching of the colour Sable. Thus, it almost seems evident that Petra Sancta or de la Colombi√®re modeled their systems after Zangrius' hatching table. Zangrius inscribed into the oval escutcheon of his hatching table both the heraldic and standard French language appellations of the given tinctures as follows ‚Äì Or, Argent, Geulle [gueules] and Rouge (gules), Azur and Bleu (azure), Sinople and Verd [Vert] (vert). The hatching used by him for these tinctures is identical with contemporary hatching methods. The only difference in Zangrius' system was the hatching of the colour sable (Sable and Noir by Zangrius), i.e. crossing of vertical and diagonal lines from the heraldic left to right instead of the present day's crossing of vertical and horizontal lines.

They have developed their own distinctive style based on Occitan folk music and the rhythms of northeastern Brazil. Claude Sicre writes the lyrics and raps, while Ange B (real name Jean-Marc Enjalbert) raps and acts as a human beatbox, producing a wide range of sounds (beats, scratches, trumpet, guitar etc.) solely with his mouth. Their first album, √àra pas de faire (In English, We shouldn't have done it), was released on Massilia Sound System's Roker Promocion label. Originally the lyrics to their songs were in the Occitan language, but they have since reached a wider audience with French-language lyrics. They are noted for their political engagement, denouncing politicians such as Toulouse mayor Dominique Baudis, and particularly for their humour, wordplay, and constant puns. A major feature of their concerts is improvisation in the form of rap battles, verbal duels between the two rappers with each trying to outdo the other. These joutes verbales or duels de tchaches, as the band calls them, are inspired by the \\"tenson\\" of Occitan troubadours. The auditorium also forms part of the show, with numerous folk dances taking place. The Fabulous Trobadors engage in their songs with the defence of cultural (notably Occitan) identity, decentralisation, and the fight against economic neoliberalism.

Hpk, ) is a junction station in the village of Haapam√§ki, in Keuruu, Finland. Construction on the railway line from Tampere to Sein√§joki via Haapam√§ki was finished in 1882. When the railway line to Jyv√§skyl√§ was built, Haapam√§ki became a junction station. The fourth line to branch off from Haapam√§ki was the Pori line, which was built in the 1930s. This line saw heavy traffic until the 1970s, since all trains heading for Ostrobothnia and Jyv√§skyl√§ went through Haapam√§ki. The number of trains heading for Ostrobothnia via Haapam√§ki dropped off in 1971 as a result of the line from Tampere to Sein√§joki via Parkano being built. The number dropped even further once the Pori line was closed. Construction Haapam√§ki railway station was built over a two-year period, from 1880 to 1882. At the same time, construction was being started on a rail line between Tampere and Vaasa. Originally, the area around the station was sparsely populated wilderness, but a village quickly sprung up around the station. Beautiful log buildings were built for the stationmaster, the railway guard and other railway personnel. At the same time, some of the people building the station settled down permanently in the village and built themselves houses. The railway enticed merchants to the town as it offered them a substantial shipping advantage. By the time trains started rolling through the village in 1882, a village with several dozen houses had sprung up around the station. Haapam√§ki never saw any major industry roll into town, as there were no rapids nearby that could be used to generate energy; nor were there any major waterways nearby that could be used for transporting timber to the station. Early stages Until the end of the 1800s, Haapam√§ki railway station's development was quite modest; this was, above all, due to the inability of the merchants to use the railway to their advantage and the municipality's reluctance to develop the station village, which was located far from downtown Keuruu. No wholesale trade ever developed as all the merchants focussed their efforts on retail sales, which proved not to be very profitable in such a small village. In that sense, Haapam√§ki was geographically in a favorable place for wholesaling as it would have been easy to competitively ship goods to Virrat and Ruovesi in the west and Jyv√§skyl√§ in the east. The development of the station fell mainly on the shoulders of the Finland's State Railways, as the municipality refused to do anything. A fear of the village center fading away and the station village developing into the new business center was behind the municipality's decision. Furthermore, the majority of Haapam√§ki's inhabitants were not originally from Keuruu, which perhaps also caused the original residents to be jealous and resentful. Becoming a junction station In spite of everything, the area around the station grew faster than downtown Keuruu did. State Railways continually built new housing for its growing staff. As Haapam√§ki became a junction station, the yard was expanded and a locomotive depot and water tower were built. The track connecting the Ostrobothnian line with the Savo line had already been planned for a long time, but quarrelling about the line pushed back construction. Russia's Ministry of War felt that this line was strategically important and demanded action to be quickly taken to get it built. Haapam√§ki became a junction station in 1897 when the line to Jyv√§skyl√§ was established. Downtown Keuruu was along the new line and a station was built there because of it. The new station was christened Keuruu railway station and so the station in Haapam√§ki, which had been called Keuruu railway station until that point in time, was renamed Haapam√§ki railway station. Haapam√§ki railway station's transformation into a junction station was a major turning point in the development of the station. The number of the State Railways staff at Haapam√§ki rose to 200. An enormous staff was required to deal with traffic, rolling stock, and the tracks themselves around the clock. Traffic was run from the station, which had several clerks and other workers working there. In addition to the engineer and conductor, trains had a lot of other staff on them, as well. The central storehouse for wood used as fuel for the steam locomotives was located in Haapam√§ki; this provided work for many locals. The wood was hauled to the station's wood yard by sledge from the surrounding forests and some were even shipped from nearby stations by train. Chopping the wood and loading it into the tender required a large workforce. One load of wood was enough for a train to reach the next loading point after Haapam√§ki, which were Sein√§joki, Jyv√§skyl√§, or Tampere in this case. The water tower supplied water for the engines to use to create steam and the depot was used for more demanding maintenance. Workers were required year-round to keep the track in shape. In winter, snow was removed from the tracks and in the summertime, the sleepers were changed and workers ensured that the track was sound enough for trains to run on it. The livelihood of the State Railways staff was stable, which encouraged an ever increasing number of professionals in other sectors to move to Haapam√§ki. The village continued to grow despite the fact that it had no industry to speak of and business was not very profitable. One of the major barriers to developing business was the free tickets that railway workers received and that they used to go to town to do business and shop. A significant step in the development of Haapam√§ki railway station was the construction of the Haapam√§ki‚ÄìPori line in the beginning of the 1930s. Due to increased traffic, additional tracks were built on the west side of the railway yard. At the same time, the level crossing north of the station was removed and a flyover was built for the road. Thanks to the Pori line, it was possible for trains to head in four different directions from Haapam√§ki, which was rare in Finland at that point in time. Thus the number of staff grew and more construction was needed. The depot was enlarged and the wood yard expanded. The Finnish State Railway had a four-story brick building built near the station with 24 apartments for railroad workers. At the same time, a large number of single-family houses were built around the station and 40 single-family houses were built in the Kumpulampi section of the village. Thanks to the new line, the station rose in the ranks, which also affected the increases in the wages that staff received. Soon after the Pori line was built, plans were laid to build a line between Haapam√§ki and Saarij√§rvi. The Finnish Defence Forces and Members of Parliament from Central Finland stood behind the project because they felt that it was important and it would shorten the trip south of the Haapam√§ki-Jyv√§skyl√§ line by 100 km, which would also make it possible to reach Tampere via Haapam√§ki without having to go through Jyv√§skyl√§ first. The project was pushed by MP Taavi Vilhula and the proposal was quickly passed in Parliament. The line was marked out in the terrain at the end of the 1930s with one of the most important stations along the way being Multia, which was where MP Vilhula was from. The eruption of World War II, however, caused construction on the line to stop and the severe war reparations that Finland had to pay put a damper on further construction for a long time even once the war was over. The decision to build the line was finally shelved when plans to build a direct line between Jyv√§skyl√§ and J√§ms√§ were launched. Buildings The first station building was built at the beginning of the 1880s and it started to be used for that purpose in 1882 when trains started running between Tampere and Vaasa. The building was located on the west end of the railway yard. When Haapam√§ki became a junction station after the christening of the line to Jyv√§skyl√§, a new station building was built on the east end of the yard. The old station was turned into a house for the stationmaster. An expansive park was next to it; this park was called Gr√∂ndahl's Park after the stationmaster at the time. When the railway yard was expanded to accommodate the line to Pori in 1937, the park was razed and the old station building dismantled. It is said that Gr√∂ndahl sent 2,000 plant species and varieties to the Botanic Garden of the University of Helsinki. Haapam√§ki's new station building was completed in 1897. It was designed by Bruno Granholm and represents the Romantic Nationalist style. Separate waiting rooms were built for second and third class passengers. A restaurant occupied one end of the building and both passengers and locals dine there. Up until the beginning of the 1900s, passenger trains stopped in Haapam√§ki for approximately 30 minutes so passengers could refresh themselves in the restaurant. Due to growing demand, the Finland's State Railways had a separate station restaurant built north of the station building proper in the 1940s. The new two-storey restaurant building had a dining area and a kitchen downstairs and staff rooms upstairs. The 1940s were good for the restaurant, as there were still relatively few cars and as the Karelian evacuees traveled a lot. The restaurant's popularity fell off sharply, however, mainly due to an ever increasing number of people traveling in private cars, which in turn meant that fewer people took the train. Also, schedules were tightened in order to remain competitive with car travel, allowing less time for a relaxed meal. The restaurant saw its business drop even farther once beer could freely be sold in coffee shops. In addition, the restaurant being open at night due to train traffic meant that the great majority of customers were drinking alcohol, which, in turn, made the experience less enjoyable and finally ended up being the reason for the restaurant closing down.

The tradition can be traced to the 11th-century Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn (LGE). A Scottish variant is due to John of Fordun (d. 1384). Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn The narrative in the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn is a mythological account of the origin of the Gaels as the descendants of the Scythian prince F√©nius Farsaid, one of seventy-two chieftains who built the Tower of Babel. Go√≠del Glas was the son of Nel (son of F√©nius) and Scota (daughter of a Pharaoh of Egypt). ¬∂140 Go√≠del Glas is credited with the creation of Gaelic (proto-Irish language) from the original seventy-two languages that arose at the time of the confusion of tongues., Vol. 2, p. 13 (¬∂107) \\"It is Gaedel Glas who fashioned the Gaelic language out of the seventy-two...\\"; Macalister (p. 5) adds \\"Kg [Keating] ascribes it to a different Gaedel, s. [son of] Ethor, unknown to LG\\" His descendants, the Gaels, undergo a series of trials and tribulations that are clearly modelled on those of the Israelites in the Old Testament. They flourish in Egypt at the time of Moses and leave during the Exodus; they wander the world for 440 years before eventually settling in the Iberian Peninsula. There, Go√≠del's descendant Breog√°n founds a city called Brigantia, and builds a tower from the top of which his son √çth glimpses Ireland. Brigantia possibly refers to Bragan√ßa, in Portugal, or perhaps Corunna, in Galicia, (then known as Brigantium),Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"A Coru√±a\\". whilst Breog√°n's tower might have been based on the Tower of Hercules, which was built at Corunna by the Romans.Harry Mountain, The Celtic Encyclopaedia, p. 380 An anecdote in the LGE tells how Gaidel Glas, son of Nel (Keating: Niul), was cured of a serpent's sting when Moses made fervent prayer and touched his rod upon the lad's wound., Volume II, pp. 59‚Äì61 (¬∂143‚Äì145) An inserted verse in an earlier passage says of Gaidel: \\"green were his arms and his vesture\\"., p. 93, Poem No. XIII O'Clery's redaction of the Lebor Gab√°la adds that the snake bite left a green ring on the boy, from which he earned his nickname of Gaidel Glas (meaning \\"Green\\")., LG, Vol. 1, p. 197 (¬ß128) \\"Aaron went to Moses after that, and tells him the hearty welcome that Nel, son of Fenius, gave them, ... [Nel had a son, and] a venomous serpent wound itself around him so that death was near him... Moses made vehement and diligent prayer to God, when the boy reached him, and he struck the famous rod on the serpent till he cleft it in two. The boy was sound at once. There was a green ring on him in the place where the serpent had coiled about him, from that out to his death, so that thus Glas [\\"Green\\"] stuck to him as an extra name.\\" Keating also repeats this quoting a glossarial verse, although he prefaces it with an alternate derivation of the nickname from the word for lock (): \\"Some seanchas state that Moses fastened [his bracelet] with a lock...\\" etc.; the passage also seems to suggest the nickname also has to do with the word fleascach, glossed here as 'bracelet-bearer' denoting an authority figure, even though 'fleasc' normally means a staff or rod.Macalister's 5-volume edition of LGE, 1938‚Äì, see: Vol. 1, p. xxvii; Vol. 2, pp. 4‚Äì5 (commentary), p. 35 (¬∂119), pp. 59, 61 (¬∂143‚Äì145), p. 123 (verse XVIII to ¬∂144), p. 134 (notes to ¬∂119), p. 157; Vol. 3, p. 198 John of Fordun Scota (left) with Go√≠del Glas (right) voyaging from Egypt, as depicted in a 15th-century manuscript of the Scotichronicon of Walter Bower; in this version Scota and Go√≠del Glas (Latinized as Gaythelos) are wife and husband. A Scottish version of the tale of Go√≠del Glas and Scota was recorded by John of Fordun. This is apparently not based on the main Irish Lebor Gab√°la account. Fordun refers to multiple sources, and his version is taken to be an attempt to synthesise these multiple accounts into a single history. In Fordun's version, Gaythelos, as he calls Go√≠del Glas, is the son of \\"a certain king of the countries of Greece, Neolus, or Heolaus, by name\\", who was exiled to Egypt and took service with the Pharaoh, marrying Pharaoh's daughter Scota. Various accounts of how Gaythelos came to be expelled from Egypt‚Äîby a revolt following the death of Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea, pursuing Moses, or in terror from the Plagues of Egypt, or after an invasion by Ethiopians‚Äîare given, but the upshot is that Gaythelos and Scota are exiled together with Greek and Egyptian nobles, and they settle in Hispania after wandering for many years. In the Iberian Peninsula they settle in the land's northwest corner, at a place called Brigancia (the city of A Coru√±a, that the Romans knew as Brigantium). Gaythelos was considered the founder of the Portuguese city of Porto by some old authors. According to them, he landed in the Iberian Peninsula in a harbor that he named \\"Portus Gaythelos\\" (later named by the Romans Portus Cale after the Callaici people), the town later giving its name to Portugal.Joseph Fr.

Starting as a monthly club night in London, it has grown to include an annual three-day weekender at Southport, a boat party on the River Thames, as well as guest shows at festivals such as Glastonbury. In 2013 Bang Face celebrated its 10th birthday with DJ Mag stating Bang Face [maintains] \\"the perfect blend of old skool rave and the finest contemporary leftfield sounds\\". In March 2015 Bang Face reached the milestone of 100 events by hosting the Weekender at Southport Holiday Park. Resident Advisor asked the question \\"Is Bangface the most unique rave out there?\\" and described it as a \\"Neo-rave utopia\\".  Description  Bang Face is known for its fun and creative party atmosphere featuring inflatables being bounced above the crowd, banners bearing comedic slogans and fancy dress themes. A photo feature illustrating this appeared in the Observer Magazine. It is this atmosphere that has become Bang Face‚Äôs unique signature with Time Out London claiming that the 2009 Weekender would ‚Äúmake Bestival look like f***ing ‚ÄòQuestion Time‚Äô\\". Bang Face hosts a wide range of electronic dance music. Bang Face normally themes its events using historical references to significant events falling on the same day, for example a James Bond-themed fancy dress code for an event coinciding with Roger Moore's birthday party.  London events  Bang Face began as a monthly club night in London and quickly became increasing popular with a resurgence in electronic dance music. It gained attention early on with a video endorsement from Ozzy Osbourne who described it as \\"the Punk Rave Place\\". Whilst supporting mainly new and upcoming artists, Bang Face began to gain attention in the media. It appeared top of the recommended club features in publications such as NME‚Äôs ‚ÄòTop clubs to get your rocks off‚Äô and The Guardian Guide: ‚ÄúBang Face celebrates with luminaries Venetian Snares, A Guy Called Gerald and Hellfish to unleash all manner of mayhem‚Äù. Bang Face also holds an annual boat party on the River Thames.  Weekenders  After five years of monthly club nights Bang Face launched the first Weekender in 2008, held over three days at Pontins in Camber Sands. Following the success of this event it has now become an annual event. A fly poster for the first Weekender appeared in Channel 4's Shameless as a stage prop. In 2012 the Bang Face Weekender was held at Trevelgue Holiday Park, Newquay, Cornwall and headlined by Aphex Twin. The Bang Face Weekender returned in 2015 to Pontins Holiday Park Southport for the 100th event. The Bang Face Weekender was also held again in April 2016 at Southport.  Festivals & European Events  Bang Face began to host showcase events at UK festivals, starting with The Glade in 2006. In 2010 it hosted a night at the Glastonbury Festival for the first time, which was ranked ninth in a Daily Telegraph columnist's Top 10 highlights of the festival. BangFace returned to Glastonbury in June 2011. In 2013 - 2014 Bang Face organised events in Belgium and Holland where they have a strong fanbase. This included a takeover at Dour Festival in 2014.

Throughout the history of railways many locomotives have been named (just as many have been numbered, and many have borne both a name and a number), but Britain's Great Western Railway, the prime exponent of the broad gauge, was noted for being an enthusiastic namer throughout its long existence, and perhaps less interested in numbering - although all locomotives carried numbers. The name of the first locomotive of a batch was often the name by which the whole class was known, such as Fire Fly or Victoria. As with other named locomotives, broad-gauge ones drew their names from a wide variety of sources. As well as the many names from Greek, Roman and other mythologies, locomotives were named after famous people, literature, flora, fauna, towns, and geographical features, as well as imagery suggestive of speed and power: *Mythology ‚Äì Banshee, Osiris, Peri, Python, Venus *Famous people ‚Äì Brunel, Dido, Euripides, Iron Duke, Victoria *Literature ‚Äì Ivanhoe, Mazeppa, Robin Hood, Ulysses *Flora and fauna ‚Äì Bee, Hawk, Lily, Shamrock, Zebra *Towns ‚Äì Bristol, Reading, Swindon, Wickwar, Windsor *Geography ‚Äì Exe, Hecla, Severn, Stromboli, Yeo There are several rivers called Yeo, and three of them are in the area where the North Devon Railway (7-foot gauge) operated. *Speed- and power-imagery ‚Äì Comet, Fire Ball, Hurricane, Lightning, Rocket Key This list covers the broad gauge locomotives of the following railways: * BGR -

He was a veteran of the attack on the Moncada barracks in July 1953 and served time in Batista's New Model Prison on the Isle of Pines with fellow revolutionary Fidel Castro. After Castro's rise to power, he was labeled an enemy of the regime and imprisoned for almost 30 years. Background Chanes de Armas was one of a number of revolutionaries closely aligned to Castro during the battle against the Fulgencio Batista regime in Cuba, that felt that the influence of the Communist party of Cuba was threatening to betray Castro's initial promises of constitutional reform. As Castro continued to reject calls for elections in the months after the revolution, opining that they would usher in a return to \\"the old discredited system of corrupt parties and fraudulent balloting which marked the Batista era\\",The Political End of President Urrutia. Fidel Castro, by Robert E. Quirk 1993. Accessed 8 October 2006. Chanes de Armas became increasingly active in the opposition movement against the new government. For these activities he was sentenced and imprisoned on charges of \\"counter-revolution\\". According to The Economist's obituary of de Armas: > In 1961 he returned to the Isle of Pines. His crime was \\"counter- > revolution\\". He was said to have tried to assassinate Mr Castro, but he > denied that he had ever been enlisted. The falling-out was personal and > ideological. His face had now been airbrushed out of the photographs in > which he smiled as Fidel's friend. > Prison was much less comfortable than before. That spring the Isle of Pines > had been sown with dynamite, linked up to the wiring system in the prison, > so that any American attempt to rescue the prisoners would blow them to > smithereens. It was, Mr Chanes de Armas remembered, \\"like sleeping on a > powder keg\\". Prisoners‚Äîin 1961, around 6,000 of them‚Äîwere meant to submit to > communist \\"re-education\\"; he became the leader of those who resisted. He > refused to wear the blue uniform of a common criminal, instead going naked > or in underpants. He took part in forced labour as slowly as he could, > digging ditches or chopping up blocks of marble in the fierce, dripping > Cuban heat. For weeks at a time he was put in tapiadas, steel isolation > cells, and gavetas, \\"drawers\\", so narrow that he could only stand. He and > his followers were called plantados, planted squarely‚Äîthough sparsely‚Äîas > trees across Mr Castro's path. > He was in prison for one day short of 30 years. It's been argued that Chanes de Armas was imprisoned longer than any political prisoner anywhere. In 1993 he was permitted to leave for Miami. He died on February 24, 2007, aged 80. In a number of respects his life story resembles that of Gustavo Arcos - another veteran of the attack on Moncada Barracks.Gustavo Arcos Bergnes - Florida International Universityde La Cova, Antonio Rafael 2007 The Moncada Attack: Birth of the Cuban Revolution.

It was then converted into the Next ladieswear chain.NEXT plc: Information and Much More from Answers.com A Kendalls publicity photo from the early 20th century History Kendall & Sons was founded by William Wheeler Kendall in 1870. Born 1849, he came from a farming family near Market Harborough in Leicestershire who decided to travel to Leicester to find his fortune. He started selling umbrellas from a barber's shop in Northampton Street, and then manufactured them using Fox frames. The company expanded to over 100 stores by the 1960s and its umbrellas were sold the world over. On many occasions it supplied umbrellas to particular specifications to protect members of the Royal Family, and even supplied 5 umbrellas to the 1952 expedition which successfully conquered Everest.The House of Kendall, Published by Newman Neame Ltd. Page 7. In 1932 the company moved into purpose built factory on 128 Charles Street, Leicester specifically designed with an eye to greater efficiency and staff comfort. Indeed special care was always given to the welfare of the staff. The company was one of the first to institute the tea- break with the tea provided free (15 minutes or 20 minutes during overtime) and a staff canteen. Between the wars one and a half hours was allowed for lunch after a poll of the staff to see whether they preferred working later and enjoying a longer dinner 'hour'.Leicester Mail, unknown date, page 12 Regular staff trips took place with Kendall's taking the entire factory staff to destinations such as Cleethorpes, Skegness and Kenilworth. During the 20th century Kendall's continued to manufacture umbrellas, but also developed rainwear and ladies clothing retail lines. During the World War 2, it manufactured macintoshes for the army as well as using the skills in handling silk built up over 70 years of the umbrella manufacturing to produce parachutes. The main emphasis of the Kendall's sales and marketing throughout its history was quality and high standards, and as such advertised in quality publications like Vogue, and it used the model Twiggy for photo shoots of its clothing ranges in the 1960s.The House of Kendall, Published by Newman Neame Ltd. Page 21. It also regularly bought the entire front page of The Daily Mail. This was usually around St Swithin's day when it was said that if it rained then it would rain for the next 40 days. One such page was on 14 July 1927 where readers were urged to buy a Kendall's umbrella in exchange for a 'free' Kendella Weather House.The Daily Mail, Thursday July 14, 1927 The company remained in family ownership until 1977 when it was bought by Combined English Stores. In 1981 it was sold to Hepworth and Sons a tailors company from Leeds, who embarked on converting all the Kendall stores to the Next brand. This was completed by 1984.

Thus the wife, a non-royal, took the title of Ammachi Panapillai Amma. The Ammachis were mostly from families of the Thampi caste of the Nair nobility. The Maharajahs married these ladies through the Sambandham form of wedlock known as Pattum Parivattavum. Origin The Maharajahs of Travancore (current south Kerala) adopted the Matrilineal custom and inheritance prevalent in the land around the 14th Century AD. Accordingly, when a king died, his nephew (sister's son) would become the next ruler. Ammaveedus Families from where Maharajas got married were known as Ammaveedus. It is believed that when the then Travancore King, Maharajah Sree Karthika Thirunal Dharamaraja shifted capital from Padmanabhapuram to Thiruvananthapuram, he brought along his four wives who belonged to the places namely Vadasseri, Nagercoil, Arumana, and Thiruvattar. The new houses, referred to as Ammaveedus (ancestral homes of Ammachis) were constructed in the new capital and were named Arumana Ammaveedu, Vadasseri Ammaveedu, Nagercoil Ammaveedu, Thiruvattar Ammaveedu. The Maharajah also passed a rule that all the Royal male members should only marry from one of the above-mentioned four Ammaveedus. This gave social prominence to the Ammachis as well as their homes. The Kings of Travancore traditionally took wives from Ammaveedus and the Consorts, known as Ammachis would get the additional title of Panapillai Amma. If at all another lady from outside the Ammaveedu's was to be married to the King, she would be adopted to one of the Ammaveedus first and then wed to the King. This was the case in the marriage of Maharajah Swathi Thirunal, Maharajah Ayilyam Thirunal and Maharajah Moolam Thirunal. Social Status Even though Ammachis and her children were held in high social esteem, they had neither any royal titles nor any political power. They remained outsiders and were considered inferior to her husband and his family, and neither they had any communications with other royal members. The Ammachis were not supposed to be seen publicly with their royal spouses; they couldn't travel in the same carriages. If at all they travelled with the Maharajah they were to be seated opposite to their spouses and never beside them. The Maharajahs neither partook any food cooked by their consorts nor the consorts were allowed to take food alongside royal members. As times changed, the restrictions also got reduced. Rev. Samuel Mateer in 19th Century observed the following about the position of Ammachis of Travancore: Despite all these limitations, historians point out that the Ammachis were compensated with material benefits like tax exemption to land and other properties, comfortable living provisions as well as other honours.

A variety of horses can be seen The term rouncey (also spelt rouncy or rounsey) was used during the Middle Ages to refer to an ordinary, all-purpose horse. They were used for riding, but could also be trained for war. It was not unknown for them to be used as pack horses. The horse, which was also referred to as runcinus, is believed to be a harrowing animal on account of its proportions found in the demesne stock listing before it became an exclusively riding animal. Use in warfare While the destrier is the most well-known warhorse of the Medieval era, it was the least common, and coursers were often preferred for battle. Both were expensive, highly trained horses prized by knights and nobles, while a poorer knight, squire or man-at-arms would use a rouncey for fighting. A wealthy knight would provide rounceys for his retinue.Oakeshott, Ewart. A Knight and his Horse, Rev. 2nd Ed. USA:Dufour Editions, 1998Gravett, Christopher.

History  =1973‚Äì1996: Oxford= Warnborough College was founded in Oxford, England, in 1973 by Dr Brenden Tempest-Mogg, an Australian who had attended Hertford College University of Oxford in 1970. Warnborough College was not affiliated with the University of Oxford. It offered study abroad programmes and catered largely to American undergraduate and graduate students spending a semester or year abroad as part of their academic programme.Queensland Courier-Mail, 10 November 1993, Residential Property section, p. 35 Other offerings included Warnborough College International Summer Schools and a venue for summer conferences. It was founded on Warnborough Road in North Oxford and in 1976 moved to Yatscombe Hall at Boars Hill, about four miles south from the city of Oxford. The Boars Hill facilities included a Presidnet's Lodge and two Victorian Gothic mansions, used for teaching, administration and accommostion In 1985, Warnborough College began the successful Warnborough Australian Studies Programmes for studies in Sydney and Brisbane, Australia. =1997‚Äì2005: London and Canterbury= In 1997 Warnborough University was registered as a limited company in Ireland, directed by Brenden Tempest-Mogg and Kee Guan Ng, a Malaysian national with a registered branch office in the United Kingdom. It initially operated an office in London and later moved to Canterbury in 2001. It offered graduate and undergraduate residential and non-residential degrees in liberal arts, scientific and professional studies.Bear, John, Bear's Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning, 15th Ed (2003) p.223 In November 2005 Ireland's Department of Education and Science said that Warnborough University in Ireland was in breach of the Universities Act 1997 by calling itself a university and requested that they not use the word \\"university\\". Earlier in 2005, the inclusion of Warnborough and other unauthorized degree providers on a UK Department for Education and Skills (DFES) list of \\"genuine\\" education providers was described as an \\"embarrassment\\" to DFES. =Affiliates= Saint Theresa's Medical University was an unaccredited institution in St. Kitts that the Oregon Office of Degree Authorization identified as being jointly operated with Warnborough. In the early 2000s Warnborough University generated controversy in Australia because neither Warnborough nor any of its consortium partners through which it was offering graduate and undergraduate degrees were accredited to do so.Questions on Notice (3 April 2001) The Australian state of New South Wales included Warnborough on a list of five \\"unrecognized universities\\".Brown, George, \\"Protecting Australia‚Äôs Higher Education System: A Proactive versus Reactive Approach in Review (1999‚Äì2004), Proceedings of the Australian Universities Quality Forum 2004 Up to October 2012 the Oregon Office of Degree Authorization named Warnborough in its listing of unaccredited universities, with its then administrator, Alan Contreras, characterising Warnborough College as \\"a diploma mill that has managed to move back and forth between Britain and Ireland for decades without either government's being able to put an end to it.\\"  United Kingdom college  Warnborough College UK is located in Canterbury, Kent. =Accreditation= Warnborough College UK is accredited by the Accreditation Service for International Colleges and is designated as an \\"ASIC Premier College\\".Accreditation Service for International Colleges Directory Warnborough UK is an accredited training provider for distance-education and onsite bookkeeping courses leading to Level 1 and Level 2 certification from the Institute of Certified Bookkeepers.Recommended Bookkeeping Courses Warnborough College UK is an accredited training provider for the Association of Business Executives (ABE) and offers certificate and diploma tuition services by distance-learning or onsite covering business management and tourism and hospitality.Association of Business Executives (UK) Short courses Warnborough UK was inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) for Private Further Education reporting to the UK Department of Education in 2012 however there are no records of any more recent inspections by ISI, which would routinely inspect colleges every three to six years. Irish college Warnborough College Ireland is located in Dublin. From 2006 to 2008, it rented offices from All Hallows College in Drumcondra but All Hallows said it would not renew Warnborough's lease after August 2008. In February 2008, the Irish Independent reported that All Hallows officials were concerned about the college's presence on All Hallows' grounds. At All Hallows' request, Warnborough removed photographs of All Hallows from its website.

In February 2008, Sean O'Foghlu, chief executive of NQAI told the Irish Independent that because Warnborough College is not a recognised higher education institution or awarding body the qualifications are \\"effectively worthless\\".

Controversy In 1995 it was alleged by several American students that Warnborough misled them into believing it was affiliated with Oxford University. When students discovered that Warnborough had no connection with Oxford University about fifteen or twenty of them immediately withdrew from the college with some intending to sue for refunds. The college denied that it had claimed any association with Oxford University. Although the college continued to deny any misrepresentation, Oxford University threatened Warnborough College with a lawsuit over these alleged misrepresentations and the Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board sued Warnborough. The lawsuit resulted in a judgement against Warnborough College by the Superior Court of King County, Washington of nearly $300,000. On 4 October 1995 the United States Department of Education took emergency action against and then, in 1996, terminated the eligibility of Warnborough College to participate in the federal student financial assistance programmes under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 on the basis that it was not a degree-granting foreign institution; its credits were not freely transferable to eligible US universities; and it had no eligible one-year vocational programmes. It also fined the college $40,000 for failing to make refunds to students in accord with Title IV and for misrepresentations to students.

Stiles The History of Middlesex County 1635-1885, J. H. Beers & Co., 36 Vesey Street, New York, 1884 pp320 ‚Äì 330. (June 18, 1834, Feeding Hills, Agawam, Massachusetts - 1907, Middletown, Connecticut) was an American inventor. Youth His father was an industrious farmer, a raiser of tobacco, and also engaged in the manufacture and sale of whip lashes, an important article of manufacture at that period. When Stiles was but five years of age, his father lost his property, and the son was thus deprived of the educational facilities and other opportunities enjoyed by most boys his age. The inventive genius and mechanical taste were early developed in the lad, and when but ten years of age he had thoroughly investigates the \\"true inwardness\\" of a clock, by taking it apart and putting it together again, leaving it in good running order. When he was but 12 years of age he built an ell to his father's house, doing all the work alone, including the painting. He constructed various other devices about this time, displaying remarkable mechanical ability as well as inventiveness. He made a miniature steam engine and fire engine, and constructed a violin. At the age of 16, he removed to Meriden, CT, and engaged with his brother in the manufacture of tinware; but this gave him no opportunity to develop his mechanical tastes, and he soon after became connected with the American Machine Works, at Springfield, Massachusetts, where he remained until he was of age. He subsequently engaged himself to a Mr. Osgood, who was a contractor for the Holyoke Machine Company. He soon after returned to Meriden, Connecticut, and entered the employ of Snow, Brooks & Company, which had become known as Parker Brothers & Company by the late 1800s. He was employed in making dies, and other small work requiring great skill and ingenuity. This experience proved of great value to him. He subsequently entered the employ of Edward Miller & Company, Meriden, where he remained until 1857, when he concluded to \\"paddle his own canoe.\\" He at first hired bench room of B. S. Stedman, and soon after bought out the stock and tools of his landlord. In 1860, he invented a toe and instep stretcher, which proved quite a success. Inventions and businesses In 1862, his factory was destroyed by a fire, causing a heavy loss. He soon started again, taking in, as special partner, Alden Clark, who soon after retired in favor of his nephew, George Clark. In 1867, the partnership was dissolved. When the business expanded enough that it required additional facilities, Stiles moved to Middletown, CT. Prior to this, he had made several improvements in his stamping press, making it far superior to what was known as the Fowler press. This device he patented in 1864. Parler Brothers, of Meriden, who were engaged in manufacturing the Fowler press, adopted Stiles' eccentric adjustment, which involved a long and expensive litigation, resulting finally in a compromise and the organization of the Stiles & Parker Press Company, in which Stiles held a controlling interest. His pluck and perseverance were finally rewarded with success, and he built up a large and extensive business, involving the necessity of opening a branch factory and office in New York City. In 1873, he attended the Vienna World Exposition, obtaining a foreign market for his goods. The presses were used in the armories and navy yards of the United States, as well as those of Germany, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, Turkey, Egypt, and Mexico. Some of these manufacturers are the manufacturers of fire arms, agricultural implements, builders' hardware, locks, brass goods, clocks, sewing machines, and their attachments, tin ware, silver-plated and Britannia ware, and pocket cutlery. Public service During his residence abroad, Stiles became prominently connected with the manager of the Vienna Exposition, and was nominated as one of the Advisory Committee, but his position as exhibitor precluded his acceptance. He was a member of the Advisory Committee at the Centennial Exposition held at Philadelphia in 1876. He is one of seven directors of The United States Patent Association, which includes examiners of the Patent Office, solicitors of patents, and inventors. He interested himself to some extent in the public affairs of Middletown, and served two years as a member of the Board of Aldermen. He was a member of Cyrene Commandery, Knight Templars, and was also a member of the Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity. Family On March 23, 1864, he married Sarah M., daughter of Henry Smith, of Middletown, by whom he has had three children, Henry R., Edmund E., and Millie B.

An arrow indicates how any member of the audience may enter the middle section. A fishbowl conversation is a form of dialog that can be used when discussing topics within large groups. Fishbowl conversations are sometimes also used in participatory events such as unconferences. The advantage of fishbowl is that it allows the entire group to participate in a conversation. Several people can join the discussion.  Method  Four to five chairs are arranged in an inner circle. This is the fishbowl. The remaining chairs are arranged in concentric circles outside the fishbowl. A few participants are selected to fill the fishbowl, while the rest of the group sit on the chairs outside the fishbowl. In an open fishbowl, one chair is left empty. In a closed fishbowl, all chairs are filled. The moderator introduces the topic and the participants start discussing the topic. The audience outside the fishbowl listen in on the discussion. In an open fishbowl, any member of the audience can, at any time, occupy the empty chair and join the fishbowl. When this happens, an existing member of the fishbowl must voluntarily leave the fishbowl and free a chair. The discussion continues with participants frequently entering and leaving the fishbowl. Depending on how large your audience is you can have many audience members spend some time in the fishbowl and take part in the discussion. When time runs out, the fishbowl is closed and the moderator summarizes the discussion. An immediate variation of this is to have only two chairs in the central group. When someone in the audience wants to join the two-way conversation, they come forward and tap the shoulder of the person they want to replace, at some point when they are not talking. The tapped speaker must then return to the outer circles, being replaced by the new speaker, who carries on the conversation in their place. In a closed fishbowl, the initial participants speak for some time. When time runs out, they leave the fishbowl and a new group from the audience enters the fishbowl. This continues until many audience members have spent some time in the fishbowl. Once the final group has concluded, the moderator closes the fishbowl and summarizes the discussion.  Advantages  An advantage of a fishbowl conversation is that it is suitable for large groups. It also lessens distinctions between the speakers and the audience. This has made fishbowls popular in participatory group meetings and conferences.  Issues  This is not a forum where introverted or shy people will be inclined to contribute. To include them, it is possible to break the dialog down into much smaller groups to make them feel comfortable to discuss a topic. Their opinions can be garnered upfront through a post-it gathering exercise or with live-voting on whose opinion they value/want replaced (via non-technical show of arms/clapping or a digital live-voting app). Variations The group can be split into two smaller and distinct sub-groups (such as men and women, or older and younger participants), who convene separately and come up with three to four questions for the other group, which are written on cards. The participants reconvene, exchange cards, and form two circles with one subgroup inside the other and both of them facing inwards. The inside group read a question and discuss it, while those in the outside circle listen but do not speak. Each question is discussed in this way, making sure everyone in the inner circle has a chance to speak. The circles are then reversed. The questions that the groups generate can be on the same subject or not, at the discretion of the organizer. This version is a good party game for groups of thirty to sixty people. Another derivative is to have the fishbowl run for a certain period of time - e.g., half an hour. The moderator stops the discussion in the fishbowl circle and invites those not in the inner circle to offer their thoughts and comments on what they are hearing in the inner circle. Another variation is to use technology, such as CoverItLive, to increase participation. This allows all the participants in the Outer Circle the opportunity to share their thinking in the public online forum without needing to wait turns. The online forum is also projected in the room for the Inner Circle to use as additional talking points or building ideas from. This variation allows for an environment that supports extroverts and introverts. ( Extroverts - speaking in front of the group, Introverts - sharing their thinking in the online public forum ). In this variation, a hot seat ( or open seat ) is also available for Outer Circle participants so they can at any time join the Fishbowl (Inner Circle) and share their thinking verbally if needed.

The village is situated on the banks of the Gwendraeth Fawr river. It sits adjacent to the B4309 that runs between the towns of Carmarthen and Llanelli which are both about 10 miles from the village. The village is primarily Welsh-speaking. Pontyates is set in a rural area which hosts impressive views of the surrounding valleys from the top of the hill. It is known to have two sides to the village, the Carmarthen side and the Llanelli side, known locally as \\"pentre hyn\\" (this village) and \\"pentre draw\\" (that village), depending on which side the speaker stands. The population was around 4000 in 1929 according to the parish entry of that year (Sourced from 'The Welsh Church Year Book, 1929'). Statistics (According to National Statistics Online) *Average Age - 42 *Average Commute - 12.8 (miles) *Gender Ratio - 1.06 (female/male) *Population in Good Health - 58.3% *Students - 3% History From 1909 to 1953 Pontyates had its own railway station run by the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway company. Pontyates was one of the stations that lay between Llanelli and the coal mine at Cwmmawr. The fact that the line was built down the old canal route meant that it was prone to flooding. The station at Pontyates was closed in 1953. Despite it being no longer in use, the railway line still runs across the road today and can be walked across as part of the mining heritage trail. Origin of name According to the BBC Wales programme 'What's in a name'. 'Pontyates' is said to have been named after an English family, Yates. 'Pont' translates as 'bridge' in English and the Welsh word 'Y' means 'of'. This would mean the literal translation of Pontyates is Bridge-of-Yates. However, due to the name's similarity to the local word 'iet' meaning 'gate' the village is more commonly referred to as 'Pontiets'. A testament to this is the fact that both names appear on the welcome sign when entering the village. Sport Pontyates is home to the rugby club Pontyates R.F.C. which plays in the Welsh Rugby Union, Division Five West League. Notable people *Mandy Rice-Davies - Famous for her role in the Profumo affair. *Harvey Thomas - Author and artist. *Neville Goodwin Duggan - Swansea rugby union player. *June Brown - Famous for her role as 'Dot Cotton' in EastEnders.

The new station has a longer platform, capable of serving trains with up to six cars, an increase from three. The previous level crossing has been removed, and a third rail power supply is used throughout. Up to the upgrade of Kols√•sbanen that started in 2006, trains switched from third rail to overhead wire systems at Montebello.

Serving the neighborhood of Montebello in Oslo, Norway, it opened in 1942, when the connection line between S√∏rbyhaugen and Jar was opened. It was closed on 19 June 1961, but reopened from 31 July 2006 to 31 May 2008, when the rest of the Kols√•s Line was being renovated. While in use, it served as the terminal station of the Kols√•s Line, and for Line 6 of the metro. The station was demolished in 2008. History In 1942, the S√∏rbyhaugen‚ÄìJar Line was opened, which connected the Kols√•s Line with the R√∏a Line. On 5 July 1957, the southbound station M√¶rradalen was closed and Ullern√•sen was moved midway between its old location and that of M√¶rradalen. On 19 June 1961, Husebybakken was closed. In 1995, the R√∏a Line, which the Kols√•s Line branches off from, was upgraded to metro standard to allow trains to operate through the Common Tunnel in the city tunnel. The first section of the Kols√•s Line, from the branching point to Montebello was also upgraded. Trains switched from overhead wire to third rail at Montebello. By early 2006, the Akershus County Council passed an upgrade plan for the Kols√•s Line. It would be upgraded to metro standard all the way to Kols√•s, and while under construction, the sections of the line not yet upgraded will remain closed. The first section be upgraded, was from Montebello to √Ösjordet. Because the upgrade included an extension of the stations to allow six-car trains, Montebello would need to be closed. Since the track until Montebello had full metro standard, building a temporary station in the area would allow the area to be served by the T-bane, and at the same time give the trains on line 6 a turning station. Husebybakken was closed on 31 May 2008. The line did not reopen until 18 August, when the three first stations were finished upgraded to metro standard: Montebello, Ullern√•sen and √Ösjordet. During the intermezzo, trains turned at Holmen on the R√∏a Line. Following its closing, Husebybakken was demolished. Service Husebybakken was the temporary terminus of the Kols√•s Line while it existed. It was served by line 6 of the T-bane each fifteen minutes. Line 6 continued along the R√∏a Line, before entering the Common Tunnel to the city center. On the other end of the city center, the line followed the Ring Line. The station was served every 15 minutes during regular service hours.

The Temple Theatre was built in 1925 by Robert Ingram, Sr. (owner of the Sanford Coca-Cola Bottling Company), at a time when Sanford had a population of only 3,500. The name \\"Temple\\" comes from being located next door to what was once Sanford's Masonic Lodge. The following quote ran in a 1925 issue of the Sanford Express, \\"In erecting this modern theater, he has spared no expense to make it an up-to-date playhouse.\\" It is a 50 feet wide- by-92 feet deep, two-story, brick building decorated with cut stone details in a blend of Colonial Revival and Art Deco styles. For several decades, the Temple served as Lee County, North Carolina's principal seat of entertainment. Located half a block from the railroad station, the Temple was a frequent for the shows and stars of Vaudeville. Years later, the Temple became a touring house for the road shows of the 1930s (including burlesque), and then a movie theater. During the 1960s, the Sanford Little Theatre and the Footlight Players used the Temple for their community productions. In 1965, the Temple Theatre closed. The rebirth of the Temple Theatre began in 1981 when Mr. Robert Ingram, Jr., the son of the theatre's original owner, donated the building to the citizens of Lee County. Through the efforts of Sam Bass, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and received a large challenge grant from the North Carolina Legislature. It is located in the Downtown Sanford Historic District. Lee County citizens and businesses matched the grant, along with a significant grant from the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation. The building was gutted and the vandalized shell of Temple Theatre was refurbished with the comfort of both the patron and performer in mind. In 1984, Temple reopened as a community theater under the director Kathy DeNobriga. The first show at the newly renovated Temple was Chicago. Ticket prices for an individual show were $3 and $4. A season ticket of 4 shows was $12. All shows were produced by the Footlight Players, and The Temple paid the bills and sold the tickets. The staff of the Temple at that time was Kathy DeNobriga, Director; Trip May, Tech Director; Sheila Brewer, Office Manager, Frank Nunally, Bookkeeper and Corrina Wicker, Box Office. In April 1986 Trip May took another position and Tim Morrissey was hired as Technical Director. One of the first things he did was to enlist the help of Sam Bass and the two of them built the cover over the orchestra pit, which is removable. In 1986 the first \\"Temple Theatre Day\\" was instituted. and held around April 1. It was a community and patron focused fund raiser. Patterned after The United Way's fund raising organization, the first one was chaired by local businessman Lamar Beach. Funds raised by this scheme were designated for the theater's staff salaries, insurance and utilities throughout the year. It continued to be an annual event although the date was changed to the Fall to accommodate the change in the theater's fiscal year change to July 1. The theater changed its FY to July 1 to be in line with the State's Art Council grant cycle. In the summer of 1987 the Temple embarked on its first professional theater ventures, producing three shows in the summer of 1987 using casts and crews that were all paid. There were no union contracts at that time. In February 1988 DeNobriga moved to Atlanta where she took a position with Alternate Roots, and Morrissey was named Executive/Artistic Producing Director. In the summer of 1988 another professional show was done.In the Spring of 1990 Wally Eastland was hired as the technical director and Frank Nunally retired. Brewer took over the duties of the bookkeeper and office manager. Eastland left in 1993 and was replaced by Bill Freeman. Freeman left in 1996 and was replaced by Ron Smith. Smith left in 2000 and was replaced by Brad Sizemore. In the summer of 1989 another professional show was produced, this one did use contracts with Actors' Equity. In the Spring of 1990 the Temple Board of Directors voted to accept a budget that included salaries for actors during the regular season. This was essentially the end of 'community' theater at the Temple and while various shows continued to use unpaid, local, volunteer actors and tech crew, many in those positions were paid, some union wages. In 1990, David Almond, who had been the musical director for the community theater was replaced by Bert Fox. Fox stayed as MD until the summer of 1994, after which Musical Directors were contracted show by show. In the Fall of 1994 Serena Ebhardt became the General Manager. She remained in that position until 2000 when she left to pursue other theater activities. Kathy Stallings replaced Ebhardt and she left in 2001. Wicker retired in 1996 and the box office was filled with various part-time paid help. In the fall of 1995 the Temple sponsored a community theater named \\"The Community Playhouse'. They produced 1 show a year 1995-1998, always in September. The roof on the theater was completely replaced in the summer of 1998. In the Spring of 1996 the balcony was reconfigured, removing two rows of seats and converting the 'tech office' into a reception room. The capacity of the theater was reduced and with the addition of computerized box office ticketing the theater seating could be adjusted to allow only 299 seats to be sold, fulfilling an agreement with Actors' Equity for a special contract. The sound equipment was moved to the balcony in the rear. It was found later that that was unsatisfactory so a special 'booth' was built out over the audience from the balcony. In the Fall of 1997 a temporary light truss was added to the down stage for the show 'The Invisible Man'. It was still there in the fall of 2001. The marquee sign, the copper letters 'TEMPLE', were constructed by the metal workers at King Roofing in Sanford, in 2000. They used an old sign that had been there made of galvanized steel. Morrissey found the old sign while rummaging around in the underground part of the theater. The new copper sign was paid for as a donation by Dave and Kelly Kurz. Morrissey left the Temple in Oct 2001, becoming the Executive/Artistic Director at The Highlands Playhouse in Highlands, NC and was replaced by Jerry Sipp. Staff at that time was Sipp, Sizemore, Brewer and part-time help in the box office. The lobby's richly painted walls and wooden trim flank the original multi-colored floor of hexagonal tiles. Above hangs a crystal chandelier accented in gold, while twin staircases sweep up on either side of the lobby leading to the balcony where the restored tin ceiling can be best appreciated. Backstage, the actors enjoy comfortable dressing rooms, a kitchen, and a lounge area. That's not bad, considering the original structure had one bathroom for the performers and it was located in the basement. There is a full counterweight fly system backstage, an advanced communication network, and a computer-controlled lighting (last updated in 2010) and sound system (lasted updated in 2014), making the theatre practical and workable. Originally, the Temple seated 500. During the 80's renovation process, seating was reduced to 334, making it quite an intimate venue. The Temple also has an orchestra pit, which is utilized by musicians, but can be covered to create a larger stage. Because it was designed for vaudeville, the acoustics are superb - highlighted by an ornate painted tin ceiling, and audience members have a good view of the stage from every seat. In the spring of 2012, the Temple unveiled a brand new concession and restroom area. The Temple is a cultural center and the top year-round attraction in Lee County. The North Carolina Shakespeare Festival, the Red Clay Ramblers, The Kingston Trio, the Glenn Miller Band, Count Basie, Mark Wills, The Embers, and Nantucket (band) are among the artists who have performed at the Temple Theatre. Today, The Temple Theatre Company produces seven Main Stage shows per season ranging from musicals to dramas, with each show running for three weeks. All the actors are paid professionals brought in from across the country. The Temple Theatre is also a Comedy Zone venue, and has hosted a number of high-profile stand up comics in recent years, including Jimmie Walker, Carlos Mencia, Jon Reep, James Gregory (comedian), and Pauly Shore. Special events at the Temple range from pop concerts to dance recitals. The Temple attracts patrons from the Research Triangle, the Piedmont Triad, and the Sandhills areas on a regular basis. In all, around 40,000 people visit the Temple each year. All funds raised during the annual fund drive go to the maintenance and operation of the facility (utilities, insurance, equipment, security, etc.). Production expenses come from ticket sales, sponsorships, grants, and advertising. The Temple Theatre is a non-profit organization.

Early life Before joining the SABC, Zikalala spent 25 years in journalism and earned numerous awards, including the SA Medical Association's best medical reporter and government's communicator of the year. Education Zikalala holds a BA Hons (industrial sociology ) from Wits University and an MA and PhD, both in journalism, from Sofia University, Bulgaria. Criticism During his role at the SABC, Zikalala attracted criticism for his pro-ANC stance. He was accused of using the publicly funded national broadcaster as a propaganda tool, sparking fears of a return to the days when the apartheid government used it as such. Zikalala blacklisted various independent commentators from appearing on national television, and was harshly criticized by an independent commission for doing so. Zikalala stated in an address given at Stellenbosch University that \\"The SABC is not the mouthpiece of the government of the day, nor should it broadcast its opinion of government policies, unless they relate directly to broadcasting matters\\". In the same address he accused Rupert Murdoch's media company of having \\"an unashamedly neo-liberal agenda\\". In an attempt to hit back at the print media, Zikalala oversaw the launching of a program called In the Public Interest. Zikalala stated that \\"just as the print criticises us, we will be able to criticise them\\". In a response, the Freedom of Expression Institute criticized this move, stating that \\"The SABC is merely the custodian of this public resource. It is inappropriate for the SABC to use a public resource as a platform for individuals in the SABC to settle scores with individuals in other media.\\" Zikalala also continually denied the ongoing crisis in Zimbabwe. During an interview with Jeremy Maggs on SAFM he stated that \\"There is food, it's just very expensive\\". In the same interview he also said that during his stay at the Sheraton in Harare he had been able to order Johnnie Walker Black Label and mineral water and accordingly didn't understand what everyone was on about. On 6 May 2008, Snuki Zikalala was suspended with immediate effect by Dali Mpofu, Group CEO of the SABC. Soon afterwards, Dali Mpofu himself was suspended by the SABC board.

The Council meeting was held on 29 November. =Main topics= While the tensions between NATO members from the build-up to the invasion of Iraq had dissipated, the NATO summit, and the months preceding the summit, were marked by divisions between the United States and the United Kingdom on the one side and France, Germany, Italy and Spain on the other. Two rifts existed, one about the military contributions to the war in Afghanistan, and the other concerning whether or not NATO should assume a more global role. War in Afghanistan Canadian forces in Helmand province, Afghanistan. The need for more troops in the south of the country was a major discussion point of the summit Before and during the summit US president George W. Bush, British prime minister Tony Blair, Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende made a plea to European NATO members to make more troops available for deployment in Afghanistan, remove the national caveats (i.e. national restrictions on how, when and where forces can be used) and start sending its troops into the conflict-ridden south of the country.X, \\"NATO and Nuclear Weapons\\" in Disarmament Policy, 29 November 2006, Can NATO transform for the 21st century?  Acronym Institute D. DOMBEY & S. FIDLER, \\"Nato makes limited progress on troops\\" in The Financial Times, 29 November 2006, Nato makes limited progress on troops ‚Äì FT.com According to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General James L. Jones it was not the lack of combat troops and the caveats were the problem, but the lack of adequate helicopters and military intelligence to support airlift and on-the-ground operations. While the NATO countries in question refused to participate in the fighting in the south, they agreed to remove some of these national caveats, and in an emergency situation all national caveats should cease to exist, meaning that every ally should come to the aid of the forces that require assistance.NATO, NATO boosts efforts in Afghanistan, 30 November 2006 A number of NATO member states also pledged to provide additional assets, including fighters, helicopters, infantry companies as well as training teams that will mentor the Afghan National Army. NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said that the removal of some of the caveats meant that some 20,000 of the 32,000 NATO troops in ISAF are made \\"more usable\\" for combat duties and that 90% of the formal mission requirements were now filled. Military sources however told reporters at the summit that these caveats never existed in emergency situations, adding that it would be a strange alliance where one country's soldiers refused to support their allies in an emergency. NATO leaders also backed a French proposal to set up a \\"contact group\\" to coordinate action concerning Afghanistan, but the United States had reservations about France's proposal to include Iran, which has considerable influence over the west of Afghanistan, in the proposed contact group due to the dispute over Iran's nuclear programme.Agence France-Presse, \\"Afghanistan being won: NATO\\" in The Daily Telegraph, 30 November 2006, The group was modelled on the one set up for the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. Political scientist Joseph Nye commented that \\"while the Riga summit relaxed some of these caveats to allow assistance to allies in dire circumstances, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and the US are doing most of the fighting in southern Afghanistan, while French, German, and Italian troops are deployed in the quieter north. It is difficult to see how NATO can succeed in stabilizing Afghanistan unless it is willing to commit more troops and give commanders more flexibility.\\"Nye, J. (14 December 2006). \\"NATO after Riga\\" The controversy surrounding the differences in contributions to Afghanistan indeed remained after the summit. For instance, during March 2007 British commanders accused the NATO members that refused to fight in the conflict-ridden south (in non-emergency situations) as causing \\"huge resentment\\" and a sense of betrayal, and undermined the credibility of the alliance. They added that despite the earlier pleas for reinforcements or to have \\"operational caveats\\" removed, some countries, notably France and Germany, were still not heeding their requests.T. HARDING, \\"Do your fair share in Afghanistan, Nato told\\" in The Daily Telegraph, 10 March 2007, News ‚Äì Latest breaking UK news ‚Äì Telegraph Besides the above discussion about contributions and caveats, the summit was noticed to paint an optimistic picture of the war in Afghanistan and Afghanistan's future. For instance, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said that \\"real progress\\" had been made in Afghanistan and that this was the main highlight of the summit. He strongly disagreed with visions of \\"doom and gloom,\\" and added that five years after the defeat of the Taliban regime, Afghanistan had become a democratic society that is \\"no longer a threat to the world.\\" He also believed that the defeat of the insurgency was only a matter of time, stating that the war in Afghanistan \\"is winnable, it is being won, but it is not yet won because, of course, we have many challenges in Afghanistan.\\" In his opinion, these challenges included besides military engagement mainly reconstruction and development work.Closing press conference by NATO Secretary General, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer Role of NATO NATO heads of state and government stand for the official portrait at the 2006 NATO Summit. The second, more fundamental rift, concerned a discussion about whether NATO should form close relationships with countries far beyond NATO's borders, in particular Australia, Japan and South Korea.BBC News, Nato looks for global role, 27 November 2006, BBC NEWS  Europe  Nato looks for global role The United States and some other NATO members pressed for a closer relationship with these countries. R. Nicholas Burns, Under Secretary for Political Affairs explained the US proposal: \\"We seek a partnership with them so that we can train more intensively (...) and grow closer to them because we are deployed with them. Australia, South Korea and Japan are in Afghanistan. They have all been in Iraq (...) [and] in the Balkans.\\"Briefing on NATO Issues Prior to Riga Summit It was however not clear how far this plan would have gone in practice, but the US insisted they were not seeking to turn NATO into a global alliance: membership would not be offered to the prospective new partners. The idea of a \\"global\\" NATO however was strongly opposed by France, which considers NATO a regional defence alliance that should not spread its wings too far over the globe. The French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie summarized the position of France as follows: \\"The development of a global partnership could... dilute the natural solidarity between Europeans and North Americans in a fuzzy entity [and it would] send a bad political message, that of a campaign launched by the West against those who don't share their ideas. What a pretext we would offer to those who promote the idea of a clash of civilisations.\\" The summit did not reach a satisfying consensus on the future role of NATO and it was considered an exercise in \\"papering over cracks\\", much more than it was ever a serious effort to decide on the future borders and core purposes. As a consequence the debate continued after the summit. =Other topics= Kosovo At the Riga summit, NATO members confirmed the role of NATO-led KFOR in the ensuring of a stable security environment there.X, NATO ‚Äì The Way to Riga and onward, 2006 This is perceived to be a reference to the possible United Nations decision in favour of independence. Because Serbia strongly opposes the break-away of Kosovo, the resulting tensions between Serbia and Kosovo could create instability in the region. Enhanced cooperation with non-members Enhanced cooperation with non- member states closer at home was less controversial and two offers were made: an extension of Partnership for Peace membership, and a training initiative. * Partnership for Peace (PfP) membership was offered to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia. NATO hoped that this would bring these countries more into the Euro-Atlantic community as the PfP is a programme of practical bilateral cooperation between individual Partner countries and NATO, thereby allowing Partner countries to choose their own priorities for cooperation.NATO, Alliance offers partnership to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia, 30 November 2006, It is expected that PfP membership is for these three countries the first step towards NATO membership. As a result, the PfP offer sparked the anger of the UN tribunal trying suspected war criminals from the Balkans. * NATO launched a Training Cooperation Initiative offering to share NATO training expertise with its Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) countries (Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel and Jordan) and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI) countries.NATO, NATO launches training initiative for Mediterranean and Middle East, 30 November 2006, The initial phase included expanding those countries' participation in relevant existing NATO training and education programmes, and the establishment of a Middle East faculty at the NATO Defense College in Rome. As a second phase, NATO would consider supporting the establishment of a Security Cooperation Centre in the region, to be owned by the MD and ICI countries, with regional funding and NATO assistance. Senior NATO staff have tended to highlight this project as evidence of NATO's forward thinking and its desire to avoid becoming party to a \\"clash of civilizations\\". Comprehensive Political Guidance Comprehensive Political Guidance (CPG), a policy document that had been agreed by Defence Ministers in June 2006 and an addition to the 1999 Strategic Concept document, was formally endorsed during the summit.NATO, Comprehensive Political Guidance, 29 November 2006 The CPG intends to provide a framework and political direction for NATO's continuing transformation in the coming 10 to 15 years.P. RANE, \\"NATO's Riga Summit: Big thinking but fundamental problems\\" in Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, 28 December 2006, More specifically, the document expresses the belief that the principal threats to the Alliance in the coming decades are terrorism, proliferation, failing states, regional crises, misuse of new technologies, and disruption of the flow of vital resources. According to this document, the Alliance should adapt to these new threats and sets out the Alliance vis-a-vis capability issues, planning disciplines and intelligence for the next 10 to 15 years, including among others the need for joint expeditionary forces and the capability to deploy and sustain them over long periods of time.NATO,, 30 November 2006, \\"NATO sets priorities for new capabilities for next 15 years\\" The document further underlined that NATO's forces should be able to conduct a variety of missions, from high to low intensity, and emphasized the likelihood that NATO will need to carry out a greater number and range of smaller operations. The CPG also confirmed the principle that 40% of the member states' military forces must be redeployable, and 8% must constantly be on operations abroad. This principle makes it, among other things, possible to effectively compare the contributions made by various states, irrespective of the size of their populations. The CPG policy document is regarded as self-contradictory for at least two reasons. Firstly, it identified the two greatest threats to NATO as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), whilst simultaneously reaffirming the 1999 Strategic Concept as \\"remaining valid\\" despite the fact that it barely mentioned these threats. Secondly, the document states that collective defence remains the core purpose of NATO, but at the same time emphasizes potential NATO contributions to conflict prevention and crisis management, and the potential planning and management of missions like that in Afghanistan. The Riga Declaration even described the capability for such missions as NATO's \\"top priority\\". Additionally, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer wanted and expected a new Strategic Concept to be debated and agreed upon by 2008, reinforcing already existing views that the CPG will most likely last much less than the 10 to 15 years as the guiding policy document.J. DE HOOP SCHEFFER, Lesson Learned: NATO Must Shape Up For The 21st century, 43rd Munich Security Conference, 10 February 2007. Energy security There was debate over the reasons for Vladimir Putin's absence from the conference The Riga summit was the first NATO summit which underscored the need for energy security, following the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute.Radio Free Europe, Afghanistan: NATO Summit Stresses \\"Progress\\", 29 November 2006, Afghanistan: NATO Summit Stresses 'Progress' The \\"Riga Summit Declaration\\" (par. 45) stated that \\"Alliance security interests can also be affected by the disruption of the flow of vital resources\\" and that it supported \\"a coordinated, international effort to assess risks to energy infrastructures and to promote energy infrastructure security.\\"NATO, Riga Summit Declaration, 29 November 2006 It further states that NATO leaders \\"direct the Council in Permanent Session to consult on the most immediate risks in the field of energy security, to define those areas where NATO may add value to safeguard the security interests of the Allies and, upon request, assist national and international efforts.\\" Radio Free Europe reports that an unnamed diplomatic source told that several NATO leaders, including Latvian president Vaira Vike- Freiberga, had tried to make arrangements for bilateral talks concerning this topic with Russian president Vladimir Putin during the summit, but Putin instead attended the CIS energy summit in Minsk, Belarus on 28 November 2006. In contrast, The Independent reported that the summit was marred by a diplomat fracas over an invitation to President Vladimir Putin and that he was eventually not invited, and that Putin as a result threatened that he would visit Latvia for the first time since independence during the summit to upstage the summit.S. CASTLE, \\"Call for unity among Nato in Afghanistan\\" in The Independent, 29 November 2006, It was even proposed that Putin could honour French president Jacques Chirac, who was at the summit and whose 74th birthday coincided with the summit, by visiting Latvia. He later made clear that this would not go ahead. 2008 membership invitations The NATO Heads of State and Government congratulated the efforts of the three Balkan states currently in NATO's Membership Action Plan: Albania, Croatia and Macedonia, and declared that the Alliance intends to extend further invitations to these countries during the 2008 Bucharest Summit, on condition that these countries meet NATO standards.NATO, New countries could be invited to join NATO in 2008, 30 November 2006, The Alliance also affirmed that NATO remained open to new European members under Article X of the North Atlantic Treaty, but remained largely silent on the prospects of Georgia and Ukraine, two countries that had declared membership as a goal, as the summit limited itself to noting the efforts of both countries to conduct an \\"intensified dialogue\\" with NATO. Nevertheless, Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip said after the summit that he had discussed Georgia's membership with US president Bush on 28 November. He further added that in his view Georgia had \\"very good chances\\" to join NATO if the planned reforms would continue and that a Membership Action Plan, the next necessary step on Georgia's way towards membership, was only \\"a small step away\\". Preceding the summit, it was expected that Ukraine was on a fast track to membership: it was believed that Ukraine would have received an invitation to a Membership Action Plan during the summit, followed by an invitation to join in 2008 and membership in 2010. According to political scientist Taras Kuzio the summit showed that Georgia rapidly moved ahead of Ukraine in its drive to join NATO, even though it joined the Intensified Dialogue program a year later than Ukraine, because president of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko failed to support a pro-Western Orange revolution coalition following the Ukraine's parliamentary elections of March 2006.T. KUZIO, \\"Georgia outshines Ukraine at recent NATO summit in Riga\\" in German Marshall Fund, 20 December 2006, In other words, Ukraine showed more ambivalence in its desire to join NATO, whereas in Georgia the pro-Western Rose Revolution coalition remained united. NATO Response Force NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer announced that the NATO Response Force was finally fully operational since all capabilities necessary were in place.NATO, NATO Response Force declared fully operational, 30 November 2006, The force is believed to be capable of performing missions worldwide across the whole spectrum of operations (such as evacuations, disaster management, counterterrorism, and acting as \\"an initial entry force\\") and can number up to 25,000 troops and should be able to start to deploy after five days' notice and sustain itself for operations lasting 30 days or longer if resupplied.The NATO Response Force At the centre of NATO transformation The heads of state and government also agreed to share the costs of airlift for the short notice deployments of the Response Force. 2010 Theatre Missile Defence In September 2006, NATO selected an international consortium led by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) to build an Integration Test Bed for the Alliance's future Active Layered Theatre Missile Defence (ALTBMD) capability. After two months of negotiations, ALTBMD Programme Manager, General (Ret) Billard, and SAIC contracting Officer, Mr. Robert Larrick, signed the contract on the first day of NATO's Riga Summit.NATO, NATO on track for 2010 theatre missile defence, 30 November 2006, This decision was based on an unpublished report agreed upon earlier by NATO ministers following a study into the feasibility of theatre missile defences. This programme is one of three programmes that NATO is pursuing in the area of missile defence. The contract puts the Alliance on track for having, by 2010, a system to protect troops on missions against ballistic missiles. The contract is worth approximately 75 million EUR for work that would be conducted over a period of six years. The theatre missile defence would be a multi-layered system of systems, comprising early warning system sensors, radar and various interceptors. While NATO member countries would provide the sensors and weapon systems, NATO itself would develop a commonly funded NATO architecture to integrate all of these elements. The development of the ALTBMD system was agreed by NATO members in large part because it is limited. NATO members are deeply divided about the multi-tiered BMD architecture promoted by the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA). Views on the summit For the three former USSR republics Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania such a high-level event was held for the first time in the region. As a consequence it held a symbolic meaning. It is perceived to have increased the visibility of these three Baltic states as NATO members.

One of its prominent responsibilities is maintenance of the California Energy Code. History The interior of the California Energy Commission's facility, the Warren‚ÄìAlquist Energy Building in Sacramento Charles Warren and Al Alquist, California politicians, co-authored the 1974 Warren‚ÄìAlquist State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Act that created the Commission.Full text of the Warren‚ÄìAlquist Act The Act required that, prior to constructing or modifying an electric generating plant, the Commission was to certify the need for the plant and the suitability of the site of the plant. In 1976, the California legislature amended the Warren‚ÄìAlquist Act to require the Commission, prior to any new nuclear generating plants being built, to certify that there is sufficient capacity to store spent fuel rods, and to establish a moratorium on the certification of any new nuclear generating plants until the federal government has approved and established a means for the disposal of high level nuclear waste. A legal challenge to this amendment by two electric utilities resulted in the United States Supreme Court case Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, which upheld the amended Act.Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190 (1983). Dr. Arthur H Rosenfeld, was a member of the U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Steven Chu's Energy Advisory Board and a Commissioner of the Energy Commission from 2000 to 2010. On 17 January 2001 a state of emergency declared during the California electricity crisis allowed the state to buy electricity for the financially strapped utility companies. The emergency authority allowed Davis to order the California Energy Commission to streamline the application process for new power plants. On 21 August 2006, the Governor signed Senate Bill SB 1, which directs the California Public Utilities Commission and the CEC to implement the California Solar Initiative program consistent with specific requirements and budget limits set forth in the legislation. In 2013 these efforts were tested in a near worst-case scenario of high temperatures, and reduced hydroelectric and nuclear power. Thanks to a combination of clean energy and conservation the state suffered no shortages.\\"California Keeps Its Energy Cool in Summer Scorcher.\\" Current activities The front entrance of the California Energy Commission's Warren‚ÄìAlquist Energy Building in Sacramento In 2007 the Commission set up relatively strict laws that forbid the signing of new energy supply contracts between utilities and coal-fired power plants.

In 2013 the Commission embarked on a program to expand Ethanol E85 retail distribution throughout the state of California. This project will install E85 dispensing equipment at 19 existing gasoline stations to take advantage of the existing fueling infrastructure. The $1.35 Million contract was awarded to Pearson Fuels of San Diego. The Commission expects the E85 vehicle fuel market in California eventually to be the largest in the United States, with approximately 55,000 new flex-fuel vehicles purchased in the state each year.Pearson to Expand California E85 . Jan 13, 2013. Retrieved on 16 Mar 2013. In 2015, California legislation passed a bill (SB 350) that sets a goal of having 33% of electricity produced from renewable resources by 2020, and 50% by 2030. The California Energy Commission was given the task of monitoring and enforcing regulation on utility companies, to help them meet this goal. Since the passing of the bill, The Energy Commission has been tracking the changes made by the state overall, and providing updates on the progress. As of June 2017, California has increased its consumption of renewable electricity generation to 29%, and the commission states that California is on track to meet the goal of 50% by 2030, if not exceed it. In a Fortune news article, Tony Early, the CEO of PG&E;, predicts that the usage of renewable energy will be closer to 70% at 2030, and so the challenge these experts predict we will face is the storage of this immense amount of renewable energy. The co-founder of Opower Alex Laskey describes the need to design a new grid system, and the need for policies to determine the rules and regulation of the market for innovated grid, as well as the \\"need to make energy efficiency and power grid plans simple enough for consumers to understand them.‚Äù Since the nature of energy generated from renewable resources such as wind and solar power do not produce the amount needed to meet peak demand times, the NREL suggests several energy storage and regulation options that could increase the flexibility of renewable energy sources to met our needs efficiently.

Running between Hayes By-Pass (Ossie Garvin Roundabout) and White City bus station, it is operated by Abellio London. History Daimler Fleetline (right) at Uxbridge bus station in June 1976 First London Mercedes- Benz O530G in Shepherd's Bush in June 2009 Route 207 originates from London United Tramways route 7 which ran between Uxbridge and Shepherd's Bush Green. In 1936, this route was replaced by a trolleybus route 607 which ran until 1960. Route 207 was introduced on 9 November 1960 as part of the trolleybus replacement program stage 8, replacing trolleybus route 607 between Uxbridge and Shepherd's Bush Green, using AEC Routemasters. The route was converted to crew operated Daimler Fleetlines in 1976, reverted to Routemasters in 1980 due to unreliability. One man operation followed in 1987 using MCW Metrobuses. In 1990 limited stops route 607 began, paralleling route 207 . The route, which runs along the entire length of the Uxbridge Road, was operated as two overlapping sections in the late 1990s, with a peak vehicle requirement of 35 double-deckers.European Transport Conference: Uxbridge Road bus priority demonstration project The proposed West London Tram paralleled much of the 207. Low floor buses replaced the MCW Metrobuses in 2001, along with six articulated buses which were on trial on the route for six months, running between Hayes-by-Pass and Shepherd's Bush Green, from First London's Greenford garage. The trial was a success and on 9 April 2005 the route was split into two sections; the Hayes-by-Pass to Shepherd's Bush Green section retained the number 207 and was converted to single deck articulated bus operation with Mercedes-Benz O530Gs. The section between Uxbridge and Acton was renumbered 427 using Dennis Trident 2s. A new base opened at Hayes for the 207; the Uxbridge and Acton allocations were withdrawn. In October and November 2004 the route was found to have the highest level of police callouts of any service in London. Fare evasion following the conversion to bendy bus operation is also perceived to be a problem by local transport user group EPTUG. Route 207 was extended from Shepherd's Bush Green to White City bus station when Westfield London opened in November 2008.Westfield London - Bus Routes and DirectionsNew White City bus station will cater for 10,000 passengers a day Transport for London 25 November 2008 A month earlier, passengers' organisation London TravelWatch had claimed that the route carried more passengers than any other route in Europe, although this was disputed by some commentators. In 2009 it was announced by new Mayor of London Boris Johnson that articulated buses would be replaced by the end of 2011; it was initially expected that the 207 would be converted to rigid single-deck operation. In February 2011, Transport for London confirmed that the route would be converted to double-deck vehicles in December 2011, and that the frequency of the route would be increased. Similar changes were planned for night bus variant N207. The proposals were criticised by local Liberal Democrat politicians for failing to increase the seating capacity of the route while increasing the number of vehicles on the Uxbridge Road. On 10 December 2011, route 207 was converted back to double deck using Scania OmniCity double deckers. It was the last bus route in London to be operated by articulated buses.Bendy bus makes final journey for Transport for London BBC News 10 November 2011 On 22 June 2013, route 207 was included in the sale of First London's Hayes garage to Metroline.FirstGroup Announces Sale of Eight London Bus Depots FirstGroup 9 April 2013Aberdeen firm FirstGroup sells off depots for ¬£80m BBC News 9 April 2013First quits London bus business Bus & Coach Professional 9 April 2013 Route 207 was London's fifth busiest bus route with 12.9 million passengers in 2015/16.https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/bus-service-usage.xlsx The route passed to Abellio London on 6 April 2019.\\"Metrobus and Abellio gain TfL contracts\\" Coach & Bus Week issue 1351 17 July 2018 page 7 Current route Route 207 operates via these primary locations:Route 207 Map Transport for London *Hayes By-Pass *Southall *Ealing Hospital *The Broadway for Ealing Broadway station *Ealing Common station *Acton Town Hall *Shepherd's Bush Market station *Shepherd's Bush stations *White City bus station for Wood Lane station References External links * Category:Bus routes in London Category:Transport in the London Borough of Ealing Category:Transport in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham Category:Transport in the London Borough of Hillingdon ","title":"London Buses route 207"},{"id":"9808557","title":"Nepovirus"},{"id":"9808564","title":"Markis Kido"},{"id":"9808578","text":"On April 25, 2006, Executive Order S-06-06, the Bioenergy Action Plan was issued by the then governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, outlining a set of target goals which would establish the increasing use and production of biofuels and biopower for both electricity generation and substitution of natural gas and petroleum within the state of California. The plan asked multiple state agencies (the Bioenergy Interagency Working Group) to work towards the advancement of biomass programs in California. The order would also help provide statewide environmental protection, mitigation and economic advancement. The plan was passed on July 7, 2006 with progress reports issued in 2007 and 2009. An updated plan was released in 2011. The 2011 plan supports the goals of current California Governor Jerry Brown‚Äôs Clean Energy Jobs Plan. The 2011 plan evaluates strategies for overcoming the litigation challenges which deterred progress in the 2006 plan. The 2011 plan also recommends new actions for environmental progress in the state of California  Types of biofuels and biomass energies  * Cellulosic feed stocks derived from forestry, agricultural, and urban wastes * Gasification * Pyrolysis * Biomass- to-liquids conversions * Landfill gas use in energy systems  Goals and benefits of incorporating plan(s)  * Capturing methane from landfills and converting manure for overall climate benefits * Forest and agricultural waste biomass as a source of fuel * Combining heat (from waste biomass) for energy (electricity) * Improving forest health and animal welfare via converting urban forestry and agricultural residues * Enhancing rural economic development via the exportation of green fuels * Creates local jobs (at new refinery and green plants) * Protects watersheds and helps to avoid wildfires * Reducing statewide petroleum dependence  Bioenergy Interagency Working Group responsibilities  * Use the state and federal budgets to ease the passing of institutional, legislative and regulatory changes which are necessary for plan to be implemented. * Carry out the state‚Äôs target objectives. * Prove the commercial readiness of production and conversion technologies for the expansion of biomass and biofuel energies. * Develop and demonstrate projects for the biomass-fueled electricity plants and refineries. * Help place a value and market potential on renewable sources of energy, fuel and chemicals. * Produce and demonstrate new cropping, handling, storage, and distribution systems for renewable energy plants. * Demonstrate efficient biomass harvesting systems at (at least) three sites. * Communicate the benefits of bioenergy to the general public and policy makers. * Research new sources of financing for future project development.  2006 Bioenergy Action Plan  The original plan was written based on reviews and recommendations from public workshops and more than 40 public documents, as well as multiple prior research programmes and policy developments around the world. Stakeholder considerations for California‚Äôs potential as a leader in renewable energies was taken into account. The plan established a biofuel production target of California producing a minimum of 20% its own biofuels by 2010, 40% by 2020, and 75% by 2050. The production target for the use of biomass electricity was a 20% increase from the prior in-state goals for renewable generation by both 2010 and 2020. The 2006 plan also sought the building of at least four afforestation and carbon sequestration projects, across the state, which would supply three to five megawatts of biomass-fueled electricity to an electricity gasification plant or bio-refinery. Potential sources of energy, fuel, and chemicals from forest fuel, harvest residues, and other small wood forest products were also identified, as well as the efficiency of harvesting small forest biomass. Each individual agency also had its own specific set of responsibilities towards meeting the goals of the Bioenergy Action Plan. The 2006 Bioenergy Action Plan outlined five statewide policy objectives: # Maximize the contributions of bioenergy toward achieving the state‚Äôs petroleum reduction, climate change, renewable energy, and environmental goals. # Establish California as a market leader in technology innovation, sustainable biomass development, and market development for bio-based products. # Coordinate research, development, demonstration, and commercialization efforts across federal and state agencies. # Align existing regulatory requirements to encourage production and use of California‚Äôs biomass resources. # Facilitate market entry for new applications of bioenergy including electricity, biogas, and biofuels‚Äù.  2007 and 2009 progress reports  = 2007 = * 19% of all power currently (now, i.e. 2007) comes from biomass * Biomass power facilities are producing nearly 1,000 megawatts of electrical generating capacity * 950 million gallons of 5.7% ethanol gasoline and over 43 million gallons of biodiesel were consumed in 2006 compared to the 14.5 billion gallons of gasoline and 4 billion gallons of convention diesel consumed * Existing ethanol facilities only produce nearly 68 million gallons, the proposed plants could produce up to 364 million gallons per year. * The production of biodiesel provides another 14 million gallons * Gasoline amendments passed which favor the use of 10% ethanol blends * 96 electricity biomass facilities have been certified and 21 facilities have gone through pre-certification * Between 285-391 megawatts of new renewable electricity was added in 2006 to the electricity grid * 33 biomass power facilities are expanded which created 640 megawatts of new renewable energy capacity * Emission rates and standards in preference for low-carbon sources of electricity have been adopted by Senate Bill 1368 * 10 dairy digesters have been installed across California, which generate 2.5 megawatts of electrical power from dairy manure or a mixture of manure, food-wastes and wastewater * Specialty crops (figs and barley) are being converted to energy * New waste discharge regulations for dairies and dairy lagoons have been adopted = 2009 = * 11% of electricity consumed comes from renewable resources * Nearly 20% of renewable electricity generated came from biomass fuels * 943 megawatts of biopower generated * Three idled biomass plants have resumed operations * One idled coal facility and two working coal facilities have been converted to biomass plants * 309 megawatts of landfill gas has been generated to electricity biopower * 66 megawatts digester gas biopower generated * One billion gallons of 6% ethanol consumed yet only 5.7% produced within California * 50 million gallons of biodiesel consumed yet only 12% produced within California * 2010 biopower and biofuel production via biomass targets are evaluated as ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù * Adopted low-carbon fuel standard for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 10% by 2020  2011 Bioenergy Action Plan  Less than 40 actions out of the 63 initial actions from the 2006 plan were completed by the time the 2011 plan was developed/adjusted. The 2006 plan was reviewed at two public workshops on June 3, 2010 and December 14, 2010. The new version of the plan was changed accordingly to assure complete coordination with the goals targeted in California Governor Jerry Brown‚Äôs Clean Energy Job Plan and the Clean Energy Future Plan. The 2011 plan extends the 20% renewable electricity production with California to 2013 instead of the 2010 goal, with a 33% renewable electricity goal by 2020. Fuel-related refineries, blenders, producers and importers are expected to reduce their carbon emissions by 10% by 2020. The production of 21 billion gallons of biofuels is projected for 2022. As with the 2006 plan, each state agency has its own individual set of goals and responsibilities. The 2011 Bioenergy Plan objectives are outlined as followed: # Increase bioenergy production at existing facilities including restarting idling plants and repowering existing facilities. # Construct new bioenergy facilities. # Integrate bioenergy facilities with the use of multiple fuels in collection, processing, and treatment operations. # Commercialize conversion technologies by funding research and development. # Remove regulatory hurdles and streamline processes.

A safety collar is normally wrapped around the outside of the mine, preventing the upper half of the mine tilting when in transit. Once deployed the safety collar is removed. Sufficient pressure on the top surface of the mine causes it to tilt. The tilting drives a pin through a friction sensitive pyrotechnic compound, which fires the detonator and then the main explosive charge. Straight downward pressure does not have the shearing component needed to trigger the mine, this gives the mine blast resistance, since blast overpressure bears down evenly on the top surface of the mine. The mine has a relatively low explosive content, so will maim rather than kill. Its blast resistance combined with the lack of metal in the mine make it extremely difficult to clear.

The Genetic Opera is a 2008 American science fiction, gothic rock musical horror film directed by Darren Lynn Bousman with a soundtrack produced by Japanese rock star Yoshiki. Based on the 2002 musical of the same name, which was written and composed by Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich, the film stars Alexa Vega, Paul Sorvino, Anthony Stewart Head, Sarah Brightman, Paris Hilton, Bill Moseley, Nivek Ogre, and Terrance Zdunich. Repo! premiered at the Fantasia Film Festival in July 2008,https://fantasiafestival.com/en/archives/2008?id=310 followed by a very limited release on November 7, 2008, on seven screens in Pasadena, Chicago, Mobile, Charlotte, Kansas City, Toronto and Ottawa. The film initially received mixed to negative reviews, but gained a cult following similar to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, managing even to fill theaters worldwide with costumed fans performing Shadowcast versions of the movie, which Smith and Zdunich often visit to meet fans. Plot By the year 2056, an epidemic of organ failures has devastated the planet. The megacorporation GeneCo provides organ transplants on a payment plan. Clients who default on payments are hunted down by Repo Men: skilled assassins contracted by GeneCo to repossess organs, usually killing the clients in the process. The CEO of GeneCo, Rottissimo \\"Rotti\\" Largo (as listed in a newspaper article about his kids), discovers he is terminally ill. Rotti's three children, Luigi Largo, Pavi Largo, and Amber Sweet (Carmela Largo), who changed her name to help her become a popular singer, bicker over who will inherit GeneCo. Rotti believes none of his children are worthy heirs, as they consistently embarrass him with their robust attitudes, and instead plans to pass on his fortune to 17-year- old Shilo Wallace, the daughter of his ex-fianc√© Marni. Meanwhile, Shilo longs to explore the outside world. She is constantly reminded by her overprotective father Nathan that she has inherited a rare blood disease from her deceased mother Marni which requires her to stay indoors. She secretly visits her mother's tomb and runs into GraveRobber, who is digging up bodies to drain Zydrate, a euphoric and extremely addictive pain-killer made by GeneCo that is secreted from dead bodies. He sells it on the street to keep up with his GeneCo payments. After losing consciousness, Shilo wakes up to find herself at home with Nathan. Nathan prepares for work, not as the doctor he has led Shilo to believe he is, but as the head Repo Man for GeneCo. Nathan believes he killed Marni with a treatment he created for her illness. In truth, Rotti poisoned Marni's medicine behind Nathan's back as revenge for Marni leaving him. Rotti blackmails Nathan, agreeing to keep him out of jail and with his then-newborn daughter Shilo if he performs surgical repossessions for the company. Rotti lures Shilo to the GeneCo 1st Annual post-plague Italian Renaissance Fair with the promise of a cure for her blood disease. There she finds the Largo brothers arguing about their father's will, while their sister harasses Blind Mag, GeneCo's opera singer and celebrity spokesperson. Mag uses surgically enhanced eyes but works for Rotti indefinitely as a result, having been tricked into signing her contract in blood pre-surgery. After introducing her to Mag, Rotti stations his henchwomen to guard Shilo. He then announces that Mag will soon give the last GeneCo-sponsored performance of her career. GraveRobber helps Shilo escape the fairgrounds. As they hurry through the city, GraveRobber encounters several of his customers including the surgery addict Amber, who has skipped the fair she was supposed to speak at, once again publicly embarrassing her father. Under the stupor of the drug, she explains that she will be replacing Blind Mag after her eyes are repossessed following the opera. After GeneCops arrive, GraveRobber and Shilo part ways and she quickly returns to her room before Nathan notices she was gone. Rotti hires Nathan to repossess Mag's eyes but Nathan refuses, citing Mag's close relationship to Marni. He quits his repo job mid-surgery, telling Rotti, \\"I cannot do this job. Find someone else.\\" This angers Rotti and he vows to have Nathan taken out. Mag arrives at Shilo's house and reveals she is Shilo's godmother. Mag states she was unaware Shilo was even alive, Nathan having told her she died with her mother. She cautions Shilo to not make the same mistakes she did. Nathan arrives home and forces Mag out after she scolds him for lying to her about Shilo's death. Meanwhile, back at GeneCo, Rotti writes down his will, ready to make Shilo his sole beneficiary with his signature. Rotti phones Shilo and invites her to the Opera, delivering her mother's burial dress for her to wear. Nathan finds the GeneCops searching his basement. They try to arrest Nathan, but he quickly dispatches them and heads to the opera looking for Shilo. At the opera, Amber takes the stage for her premiere, but her performance is ruined when her transplanted face falls off. Mag takes to the stage and sings her final song. She deviates from the song's grand finale, denouncing the Largo family and gouging out her eyes in a final act of defiance. Rotti cuts the cords suspending Mag, dropping and impaling her on a fence. Rotti assures everyone that Mag's death is part of the performance and convinces the audience to stay seated. Shilo sees a Repo Man arrive and attacks him with a shovel before realizing the Repo Man is her father. Onstage, Rotti reveals that Shilo does not have a blood disease but that Nathan has been making her ill with the \\"medicine\\" he insists that she take. Nathan explains that he was trying to keep Shilo safe from the world after being unable to cope with the loss of Marni. Approaching death's door, Rotti tells Shilo that she will inherit GeneCo if she kills her father. When she refuses, Rotti uses the last of his strength to shoot Nathan. Rotti then dies from his terminal illness and Nathan dies with one last farewell to Shilo. Shilo then leaves, deciding that her father's murderous tendencies do not dictate her future and that she is \\"free at last\\" to live her own life. In the epilogue, GraveRobber explains that Shilo fled, leaving GeneCo with no legal heir. A mid-credits scene reveals that Amber became GeneCo's new CEO and auctioned her fallen face to charity, symbolising GeneCo's commitment to change. Cast * Alexa Vega as Shilo Wallace, a 17-year-old girl confined to her room due to the alleged blood disorder she inherited from her mother. She is the film's primary protagonist, who dreams of exploring the world outside of her bedroom, which she considers her prison. While she initially strives to obey her father's rules, later in the story, she becomes more and more assertive, attempting to earn her independence. Prior to the story she has often snuck out of her room at night to collect bugs, and shots of her room shows she has an impressive collection. * Paul Sorvino as Rotti Largo, the primary antagonist; the ailing GeneCo founder and president, looking for a worthy heir. He is a powerful and driven man, having built his GeneCo empire from the ground up, and believes that material wealth is the only real driving force in the world. Aloof and controlling, Rotti regards people as tools and harbors resentment that while he was able to cure the globe, he can't prevent his own death. He sees his own children, Luigi, Pavi, and Amber, as \\"vultures\\" and \\"ingrates\\", and is bitter towards Nathan for \\"stealing\\" Marni from him. He is the one who arranged for Marni to be poisoned, in rage. * Anthony Stewart Head as Nathan Wallace, Shilo's father and a widower, having lost his wife Marni, a death which he (wrongly) blames himself for. He doubles as the head Repo Man to repay Rotti for \\"fixing\\" the circumstances of Marni's death with the police. He often laments his late night duties, but a sadistic second personality tends to seize him, leaving him a vicious killing machine as opposed to the kind-hearted, torn father. He is a very skilled assassin, being able to dispatch teams of GeneCops, using only his scalpel, on multiple occasions to save Shilo, and performing brutal organ repossessions with such ease that he can carry out a phone conversation with Shilo at the same time. * Sarah Brightman as Blind Mag, Shilo's godmother and Marni's best friend. She was born blind, but was given the ability to see by GeneCo at the price of having to sing for and publicize GeneCo permanently. After seeing Shilo at a GeneCo event (having been previously unaware she was alive) Mag reaches out to her, anxious for Shilo to not make the same mistakes Mag has made herself. She is marked for repossession and is set to deliver her final performance for the company. * Paris Hilton as Amber Sweet, Rotti's only daughter and the youngest of the Largo children. She is addicted to both surgery and Zydrate, which she obtains illegally from GraveRobber, occasionally in exchange for sex. She changed her name from \\"Carmela Largo\\" to \\"Amber Sweet\\", as she \\"needed a stage name\\". * Bill Moseley as Luigi Largo, Rotti's eldest son and Pavi and Amber's aggressive, homicidal older brother. He usually wears an ascot, wields a knife at all times, and is willing to stab others at the slightest provocation. * Nivek Ogre as Pavi Largo, Rotti's middle child. Womanizing, narcissistic, vacuous, and effeminate, he wears the skinned face of a woman as a mask over his own, which is heavily scarred. Due to the way his face is attached, he is able to change faces on a whim. He has an Italian accent (to conceal his speech impediment, according to Zdunich) and is almost always surrounded by women, usually Genterns, the employees of GeneCo, who usually give Pavi his face surgeries. * Terrance Zdunich as GraveRobber, a Zydrate peddler who obtains the insoluble chemical from corpses and has connections to Amber, both sexually and as a dealer. He also seems to be Shilo's first and only friend and explains Zydrate and Mag's debt with GeneCo to her. Mysterious and charismatic, he acts as the narrator of the post-apocalyptic world. * Sarah Power as Marni Wallace, Nathan's deceased wife and Shilo's mother; she was Rotti's girlfriend until she left him for Nathan. A jealous Rotti poisoned her and framed Nathan for the crime. ** Nancy Long provided Marni's singing voice for \\"Chase the Morning\\". Joan Jett makes a cameo appearance during the song \\"Seventeen\\" playing the guitar. Dean Armstrong, later seen in Saw 3D, appears as the victim during \\"Thankless Job\\". Co-writer Darren Smith appears during \\"We Started This Op'ra Shit\\" as the GeneCo band leader. Frequent Bousman collaborator J. LaRose appears during \\"Zydrate Support Network\\" as a GeneCo spokesman. Musical numbers A 7-track demo CD dubbed the \\"Pre-Surgery Sampler\\", was released on July 24, 2008. A 22-track soundtrack was released on September 30. Songs do not appear in the same sequence on the CD as they do in the film.

Inspired by this, Smith came up with the idea of a future where not only one's property, but also one's body parts, could be repossessed. Smith and Terrance Zdunich collaborated ideas and plot lines to create the first version of Repo!, titled The Necromerchant's Debt, which told the story of a Graverobber in debt to a Repo Organ Man. It was first performed at the John Raitt theater in 2002. After being such a success, creators Smith and Zdunich expanded on the universe to create all of the storylines that became Repo! The Genetic Opera later in 2002. Many changes were made, gradually, to the characters and music throughout the show's various incarnations through 2005. For example, Rotti, in the earliest performances, was not the father to Luigi, Pavi, and Amber. Instead, he was a younger brother to Luigi and Pavi, while Amber was Luigi's daughter. Lyrics were adjusted to new arcs and some songs were dropped altogether, such as \\"But This Is Opera!\\", which was cut out in an effort to change the direction of Blind Mag's character. After years of being performed as a stage play, Repo! was adapted into a 10-minute short film directed and financed by Darren Lynn Bousman to pitch the idea to film studios. The film starred Shawnee Smith as Amber Sweet (then named \\"Heather Sweet\\"), Michael Rooker as the Repo Man, Kristen Fairlie as Shilo, Terrance Zdunich as GraveRobber, and J. Larose as Pavi. =Filming= Once Repo! was picked up by Lionsgate, principal photography began on September 2007 in Canada. The film was scheduled to be released on April 25, 2008, but was pushed back to November 7. X Japan leader Yoshiki produced the soundtrack, along with composing one extra track for the film. He also served as the music director and one of the film's executive producers. „ÅÇ„ÅÆYOSHIKI„Åå„ÄÅ„Éë„É™„Çπ„Éª„Éí„É´„Éà„É≥Ê¨°Âõû‰Ωú„ÅÆ„Éó„É≠„Éá„É•„Éº„Çµ„Éº„Å´ÔºÅ - „Ç∑„Éç„Éû„Éà„Ç•„Éá„Ç§  Êò†Áîª„ÅÆÊÉÖÂ†±„ÇíÊØéÊó•Êõ¥Êñ∞ Paul Masse was the cast's vocal coach for the film's soundtrack. Release =Promotion= Due to Lionsgate's lack of promotion, director Bousman and creator Zdunich did much of their own promotion. To coincide with the film's release, Bousman, Smith, and Zdunich, as well as various cast members, did a Repo! Road Tour version of the film. The tour was set up for one-night screenings of the film in seven different cities across the United States. Principal cast and crew also did extensive Q&A; sessions following each screening. Because of strong ticket sales, a second and third touring session were added, in addition to a British tour across four locations. A Repo! Road Show was announced on January 28 in 10 cities. This show was similar to the Repo! Road Tour, except it was almost completely fan-run.Repo! Opera Road Tour =Theatrical release= The film received a limited release in the United States and Canada on November 7, 2008.Repo! The Genetic Opera (2008) Coming Soon It had a further limited Canadian release, playing in Toronto from November 21‚Äì27, 2008. It was released in the Czech Republic on November 20, this was followed by a theatrical release in Spain on January 2, 2009.

After initial theatrical release and DVD sales, fan support has caused Repo! The Genetic Opera to be played in select theaters for the duration of 2009 and well into 2014, some with \\"shadow casts\\" in which a group of actors and performers re-enact the film in front of the big screen while the film is playing on stage, much like the followers of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It was re-released in a special screening at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International.San Diego Comic-Con 2010: Repo! Screening and a New Lesson from The Tutor =Critical response= The film received generally mixed to negative reviews from critics. Critics polled on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 40% approval rating. The site's consensus reads, \\"Bombastic and intentionally gross, Repo! The Genetic Opera has a unique style but lacks the wit and substance to be involving\\". The film has a 32 out of 100 rating on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Kyle Smith of The New York Post concluded, \\"There probably aren't enough futuristic Goth rock musicals, but Repo! The Genetic Opera is weak on a couple of things a musical needs: music and lyrics.\\" Nathan Lee for The New York Times declared the film \\"feels destined to please a campy coterie of fans and no one else\\" and criticized the music, saying, \\"A few catchy melodies, some clever lyrics or even a sense that the score wasn‚Äôt just one long, unmodulated track might have energized this singularly inert tale...\\" Tasha Robinson for The A.V. Club said, \\"One of the main issues with Repo! The Genetic Opera is that nearly every aspect of it goes on too long. The songs are generally overextended, which is a particular problem given that most of them are also atonal and dull, either chanted or seemingly assembled from a series of clunky, ill-fitting, barely rhyming lines.\\" And ultimately \\"...I spent the vast majority of the film either bored or squirming with discomfort over the cheap gore, the arrhythmic songs, and the phenomenally bombastic performances...\\" =Box office= Repo! grossed $53,684 in its opening weekend, a $6,711 average per theater. The film's full eleven-theater release earned $146,750 in the United States, and an additional $41,376 internationally, for a total of $188,126 worldwide. =Accolades= Hilton's performance won her the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress at the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards. At the same ceremony, Hilton was also awarded Worst Actress for her role in The Hottie and the Nottie. The songs \\"Chase the Morning\\", \\"Chromaggia\\", and \\"Zydrate Anatomy\\" were shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, although none were nominated.http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2008/08.12.16.html Home media The film was released January 20, 2009 on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States.

All the tracks from the previous release remain on the deluxe edition in the same order, with the new tracks placed in between some tracks, including score tracks. The only track that appears on both albums that differs is Zydrate Anatomy, where it is slightly longer on the deluxe edition. Possible sequel In regards to the possibility of a sequel, Vega has been quoted as saying: \\"From the very, very beginning, we always talked about a prequel or a sequel to this film. And it's hard, because as of right now, we all want to do it, but, you know, it didn't really do as we hoped. We didn't really have a lot of support. But we're hoping that the fans will come back, and it will be an underground cult classic that will grow, and that will eventually spark us to do another.\\"Alex Vega on Repo! FilmMonthly.com 2 January 2009 Bousman also indicated interest, stating; \\"I would love to follow up Repo and finish the story, because it was conceived as a three-part movie. But this movie is all about support from the internet, and support from fans. This is not a movie where you'll see billboards or bus stop ads or trailers on TV.\\" It was additionally expected that Hilton would return in her role as Amber Sweet.Paris Hilton to reprise Repo role STV.TV 5 February 2009 However, in a video posted on YouTube, it was revealed that they \\"no longer control the answer to the question [of a future sequel]\\" since they no longer have ownership of the franchise, thus driving Bousman and Zdunich to make The Devil's Carnival.

The fish eludes him and the monk gets rather agitated as he tries increasingly extreme ways of catching the fish. He gets into the pond himself, and enlists the help of other monks; he tries candles, and a bow and arrow to no avail. The more the fish manages to evade him, the more obsessed the monk gets. He follows the fish out of the pond into a canal, through different landscapes and out of the confines of the monastery. Eventually the chase gets less frantic and the monk and the fish move in harmony. They float through a door into the open space and drift off into the sky together.Internet Archive Production The film was made using a cel animation technique; nowadays cel animation is often assisted by computers, but this has been made in the traditional way using brush, Indian ink, and watercolour.

Wright is currently the Head of Academy for Dundee. Playing career =Club= Raised in Hamilton, Wright started his career with Aberdeen ‚Äì progressing through the ranks alongside Eoin Jess and Scott Booth ‚Äì and made 181 first team appearances for the Dons; he was part of the squad that came close to winning the League title on the last day of the Scottish Premier League in the 1990‚Äì91 season, and achieved further league runners-up finishes in 1992‚Äì93 and 1993‚Äì94, as well as reaching the 1992 Scottish League Cup Final and 1993 Scottish Cup Final, losing out to Rangers on every occasion. In 1994‚Äì95 the club's results were unexpectedly poor and they escaped relegation only via a play-off; these turned out to be Wright's last matches for the club, and the situation also meant his wedding took place in the short time between the regular season and the matches against Dunfermline Athletic rather than in a more relaxed atmosphere after its conclusion, as he had planned. In the summer of 1995, he joined his boyhood heroes (and Aberdeen's main rivals) Rangers for ¬£1.5m. Much of his time at Ibrox was spent injured, following a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee during a UEFA Champions League match against Juventus in his first season. After just seven league appearances in three years (his spell with the Gers coincided almost exactly with that of Paul Gascoigne who in contrast played over 100 times), Wright had a loan spell with Wolverhampton Wanderers before joining Bradford City in 1998, where he reunited with former Rangers teammate Stuart McCall and helped the club gain promotion to the Premier League in his first season, although he did not make a league appearance in his second. Those two years with the Bantams preceded another two back in Scotland with Dundee United, where he took an interest in the coaching aspect of the game, before he finished his playing career in 2002 with a short spell at Scunthorpe United. =International= Wright won two international caps while playing for Aberdeen, in March and May 1993. Coaching career Wright joined Dunfermline Athletic as first-team coach in January 2008, moving from a youth coaching role at Rangers. He coached with Fife Elite Football Academy (developing players for the Fife region's four professional clubs: Cowdenbeath, Dunfermline Athletic, East Fife and Raith Rovers) for nearly a decade before returning to Rangers in May 2017. Wright became the Head of Academy at Dundee F.C. in February 2019.

Early career  He began experimenting as a singer as a Fine Arts high school student in Johannesburg, South Africa. In 1995, following an overwhelming urge for songwriting and singing he went upstage at Johannesburg's Flava nightclub to snatch a 3rd place at a ragamuffin singing contest. A year later, spurred on by a relative of his, he is introduced to a Luanda-based radio talkshow host Miguel Neto who was dumbfounded as he listened to Murras‚Äô singing thus encouraging him to try a more serious approach. Later on, while in South Africa, singer and songwriter Eduardo Pa√≠m is dazzled by the raw talent of Dog Murras, which prompts him to promise help the young teenager at his return home. Eduardo Pa√≠m at that time was at the initial stage of his plans to set up a recording studio at his Kassenda home in Luanda. In November 1995, following praise from the aforementioned individuals, he returns to Luanda with a strong mindset to officially start a career, register his murraspower brand and conquer the Angolan music market. In his early moves, he would be joined by Eduardo Pa√≠m‚Äôs boys such as Flay, Gabriel Tchiema, Mister Kim, among others.  Musical career  After sometime growing as a musician, Dog Murras recorded the single \\"Don't Know\\" which was later released as part of the Pomba Branca (White Dove) charity project. The CD project, that included such songs as Irm√£os Almeida‚Äôs \\"Epyto\\", N‚ÄôSex Love‚Äôs \\"Caso S√©rio\\", Gabriel Tchiema‚Äôs \\"Tchingoloshy\\" and Vers√°teis‚Äô \\"Menino da Lua\\", among others, saw Murras‚Äô Don't Know as a clear winner. In 1998 and 1999, Dog Murras‚Äô was much sought after by other musicians. He provided his expertise in songs such as Luck Seimol's \\"Sofro por Ti no Roque\\", Mister Kim's \\"Girl\\", Flay's \\"Com Do√ßura\\" as well as in a re-release of Eduardo Pa√≠m's \\"A Minha Vizinha\\". In 1999, Dog Murras recorded his debut album Sui Generis, having Nelo Pa√≠m as instrumentalist and co-producer and Eduardo Pa√≠m, the owner of EP Est√∫dios, as the album's executive producer.

Modlyn worked extensively on radio and TV, often as a roving reporter. His personalised car number plate was MM 405, which were his initials and the number of lines on early TV sets. Modlyn was born in Lambeth, the son of a Jewish tailor, and left school at 14. He worked as a proofreader's assistant for the Daily Mail and then wrote for the South London Press and the Evening Standard. His first broadcast was Down Lambeth Way, a talks programme for Forces radio. He was an outside broadcaster for the Jack de Manio early morning radio programme Today. In the 1960s he did pilot shows for Tyne Tees TV, including a Christmas Special. He cultivated an East End working-class image, together with an apparent lack of respect for the rich and famous. His classic interview in this vein was with Ugandan dictator Idi Amin Dada, whom he asked how many people he had murdered. Amin responded \\"You very cheeky man!\\" Modlyn was delighted by that, and adopted a theme song: ::Pardon my cheek, and the way that I speak, but no matter where I go ::To common or gentry, I talk element'ry ::In the only way I know. Former BBC Producer Roger Ordish has claimed as part of an audiobook 'extra' to the documentary maker Louis Theroux's autobiography, that Modlyn was his first choice to present what later became titled Jim'll Fix It but that he was overruled. On LBC radio he presented Monty Modlyn at Large. He also presented a series on LBC called Monty's Pub where he visited a different public house every week. As well as pubs, Modlyn had a fondness for smoked salmon and cream cheese bagels, which he would consume on air each week during his Sunday evening phone-in show on LBC. In the summer of 1979, Jeremy Beadle approached LBC and told them to sack Modlyn, let him take over the show, and he would give them a young audience.

This process, termed saltatory conduction, is featured in a majority of physiology textbooks. Dr. Ichiji Tasaki with his late wife and collaborator, Nobuko. After World War II, Tasaki's research took him to England and to Switzerland, where he further studied the properties of nerve fibers. In 1951, he came to the United States to work at Washington University in St. Louis. While there, Tasaki and his colleagues demonstrated how vibrations that occur in the cochlea in response to sound are translated into electrical signals that the brain can interpret. This effort led to the development of the field of audiology, indirectly providing the basis for diagnosing and treating many hearing disorders. Research interests Tasaki began his career at the National Institutes of Health in 1953, at NINDS, then called the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Blindness. In 1957, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. Later, he moved to the NIMH, where he was a lab chief for 22 years. At the time of his death, he was on detail to the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Since coming to NIH, Tasaki studied the physical and chemical processes that occur in nerve membranes.

Mutual relations were initially established after the European Economic Community recognised Belarusian independence in 1991. After Alexander Lukashenko became Belarusian leader in 1994, the relationship between Minsk and the EU deteriorated and has remained cold and distanced, as the EU has condemned the government of Belarus several times for authoritarian and anti-democratic practices, and even imposed sanctions on the country. Following a slight improvement in relations in 2008, the 2010 Belarusian presidential election (which officially saw a landslide victory of almost 80% for Lukashenko), led to mass demonstrations and arrests in Minsk. The EU declared that the imprisonment of opposition figures and protesters contravened human rights laws, and imposed new targeted sanctions on major Belarusian officials and businesspeople. Belarus is participating in the EU's Eastern Partnership. In October 2015, EU announced it would suspend most of its sanctions against Belarus. History European Economic Commission recognised Belarusian independence in 1991, and Belarus is part of several bilateral and multilateral treaties with the European Union. In 1995, Belarus and the European Union signed a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, but this agreement wasn‚Äôt ratified by the EU. Belarus is being a member of trade relations agreements based on the EU Generalized System of Preferences and the Most favoured nation. Belarus is also a part of the EU‚Äôs Eastern Partnership. Belarus-EU relationships began to worsen after the election of Aleksander Lukashenko in 1994; with Belarus excluded from the EU‚Äôs European Neighbourhood Policy as the EU‚Äôs reaction towards the establishment of authoritarian regime under president Lukashenko. The further deterioration of Belarus-EU relationships continued in the 21st century, with the European Union imposing sanctions against Belarusian officials, businessmen and several government- owned companies. The sanctions were the results of political repressions following the mass protests during the 2010 presidential elections, when several members of political opposition and protesters were imprisoned and condemned to prison terms. There are notes of Belarus-EU relations' improvement. Belarus has not supported Russia in its agression towards Ukraine and released several political prisoners. In 2015, the EU suspended most of the sanctions against Belarusian officials. In 2016 the travelling ban imposed on Lukashenko in 2000 was lifted. This decision was praised by Belarusian officials. Yet, as noted by both EU officials and international organisations, the further improvement is being decelerated due to ongoing human rights violation and political opposition suppression that are still present in Belarus. In 2019, Lukashenko made his first official visit to the European Union since sanctions ended. EU's Eastern Partnership program and further economic initiatives were discussed in Lukashenko's meeting with Austria's Sebastian Kurz. In 2016, two opposition candidates were elected to the country's parliament. This was marked as a step to democratisation by several EU officials. The visa system is functioning between the EU and Belarus, with Belarusian requiring Schengen visas to entry the European Union. Belarus introduced a visa-free entry for citizens of 70 countries including the EU in 2017. In 2019, it was announced that the EU would simplify requirements for obtaining Schengen visas for Belarusians, reducing its costs and time needed for application approval. Belarus-EU relations are complicated by Belarusian strong ties with Russia, who emerged as active EU critic and opponent after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Belarus is a part of Belarus-Russia Union State, as well as European-Asian Union, a customs union which includes both countries and several other CIS-members also. As for today, the Belarus-Russia integration is mostly economical, with free trade and free movement zones established between the two countries, but Russia is being seen as demanding deeper political and administrative integration.  Legal framework  Although the European Union and Belarus signed a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) in 1995, which was intended to govern the mutual political and economic relations, this agreement was not ratified by the EU. Furthermore, the European Union has excluded Belarus from its European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), which was originally designed to establish a \\"ring of friends\\" in the Union's geographical proximity. Brussels has claimed this exclusion to be a direct response to the establishment of an authoritarian regime under President Lukashenko. However, EU‚ÄìBelarus trade relations are still covered by the Union's Generalised System of Preferences and the most favoured nation (MFN) provisions of the 1989 Agreement between the EU and the Soviet Union.Agreement signed between European Community and Soviet Union 1989-12-18 Belarus is amongst the few states in Europe that have not asked for membership in the European Union. Similarly, the European Union has not offered membership to Minsk.Korosteleva, E.A., ‚ÄúThe Limits of the EU Governance: Belarus ' Response to the European Neighbourhood Policy‚Äù, Contemporary Politics, Vol. 15(2), June 2009, pp. 229‚Äì45 Belarus has continuously sought to further its economic and political ties with Russia, being one of the founding members of the Union State (formerly the 'Union State of Russia and Belarus'). In October 2009, a poll conducted by the independent NISEPI institute in Belarus found that 44.1 percent of the Belarusian people would vote Yes in a referendum to join the EU, compared to 26.7 percent one year earlier. Local experts are linking the swing to more pro-EU messages in Belarusian state media, Polish daily Rzeczpospolita says. On October 30, 2015, it was announced that the EU would suspend most of its sanctions against Belarus, following the freeing of the country's political prisoners in August. Following a series of mass protests that took place after a disputed presidential election in August 2020, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell announced that the EU would bring in sanctions against Belarusian officials responsible for \\"violence and falsification\\". Charles Michel, President of the European Council went further on 19 August saying the EU would soon impose sanctions on a ‚Äúsubstantial number‚Äù of individuals responsible for violence, repression, and election fraud.

Levy, a psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist, to describe his anthropological fieldwork in Tahiti and Nepal in the 1960s-1980s and used by many of his students and interlocutors. In practice the two approaches overlap but seem to differ in emphasis: clinical ethnography seems to be used more by anthropologists writing about sexuality or medical anthropology (particularly psychiatric anthropology, e.g. Luhrmann 2000, or anthropology of mental illness* L√©z√©, Samuel (2014) \\"Anthropology of mental illness\\", in : Andrew Scull (ed.), Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness : an A-to-Z Guide , Sage, pp. 31-32), while person-centered ethnography, though sometimes addressing these topics, more often focuses on the study of self and emotion cross-culturally. Person-centered anthropology also implies a style of ethnographic writing that emphasizes psychological case studies.Levy, Robert I. and Douglas Hollan (1998) \\"Person-Centered Interviewing and Observation in Anthropology.\\" Pp. 333-364 in Handbook of Methods in Cultural Anthropology, edited by H. R. Bernard. Walnut Creek, CA: Altamira Press. Both represent a continuation of an older tradition within psychological anthropology and Culture and Personality studies particularly. Scholars in this tradition have had their primary training in anthropology or psychiatry (or rarely both) and have conducted ethnographic fieldwork strongly informed by psychodynamic theories (though not necessarily orthodox Freudian theory), some degree of training in psychiatric or clinical psychological interviewing techniques, and attention to a set of issues including the role of culture in or the cross- cultural study of emotions, sexuality, identity, the experience of self, and mental health. Figures in this larger tradition include but are not limited to: Jean Briggs, George Devereux, Cora DuBois, A. Irving Hallowell, Abram Kardiner, Ralph Linton, Melford Spiro, and at least tangentially Gregory Bateson, Margaret Mead, and Marvin Opler. Active research and training programs in clinical ethnography today include the Clinical Ethnography and Mental Health track in the Department of Comparative Human Development at the University of Chicago, and some of the qualitative researchers at the National Sexuality Resource Center, directed by Gilbert Herd at San Francisco State University.

Vegetable oils are the basis of biodiesel, which can be used like conventional diesel. Some vegetable oil blends are used in unmodified vehicles, but straight vegetable oil needs specially prepared vehicles which have a method of heating the oil to reduce its viscosity and surface tension. Another alternative is vegetable oil refining. The availability of biodiesel around the world is increasing, although still tiny compared to conventional fossil fuel sources. There is significant research in algaculture methods to make biofuel from algae. Concerns have been expressed about growing crops for fuel use rather than food and the environmental impacts of large-scale agriculture and land clearing required to expand the production of vegetable oil for fuel use. These effects/impacts would need to be specifically researched and evaluated, economically and ecologically, and weighed in balance with the proposed benefits of vegetable oil fuel in relation to the use of other fuel sources. Attribution: Soybean Board of Nebraska  Future of energy for world economy  There is a limited amount of fossil fuel inside the Earth. Since the current world energy resources and consumption is mainly fossil fuels, we are very dependent on them for both transportation and electric power generation. The Hubbert peak theory predicts that oil depletion will result in oil production dropping off in the not too distant future. As time goes on our economy will have to transition to some alternative fuels. Fossil fuels have solved two problems which could be separately solved in the future: the problem of a source of primary energy and of energy storage. Along with straight vegetable oil and biodiesel, some energy technologies that could play an important part in the future include:  width=\\"30%\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"border:0\\" * hydrogen economy * methanol fuel * ethanol fuel * lithium economy * zinc-air battery * liquid nitrogen economy * synthetic fuel  width=\\"30%\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"border:0\\" * solar energy / photovoltaics * nuclear power (fission power) * fusion power * wind power * compressed air energy storage * flywheel energy storage * biofuel  width=\\"30%\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"border:0\\"  Net CO2 or greenhouse gas production  Plants use sunlight and photosynthesis to take carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the Earth's atmosphere to make vegetable oil. The same CO2 is then put back after it is burned in an engine. Thus vegetable oil does not increase the CO2 in the atmosphere, and does not directly contribute to the problem of greenhouse gas. It is really a way of catching and storing solar energy; it is a renewable energy. However, as with other \\"renewable\\" energy sources, there may be a (relatively small) carbon footprint associated with production or distribution of vegetable oil.  Safety  Plantains frying in vegetable oil Vegetable oil is far less toxic than other fuels such as gasoline, petroleum-based diesel, ethanol, or methanol, and has a much higher flash point (approximately 275-290 ¬∞C). The higher flash point reduces the risk of accidental ignition. Some types of vegetable oil are edible.  Generation and storage  Technologies of hydrogen economy, batteries, compressed air energy storage, and flywheel energy storage address the energy storage problem but not the source of primary energy. Other technologies like fission power, fusion power, and solar power address the problem of a source of primary energy but not energy storage. Vegetable oil addresses both the source of primary energy and of energy storage. The cost and weight to store a given amount of energy as vegetable oil is low compared to many of the potential replacements for fossil fuels.  Type of vegetable oil  The list of vegetable oils article discusses which types of vegetable oil are used for fuel and where different types are grown.  Transportation  Vegetable oil is used for transportation in four different ways: * Vegetable oil blends - Mixing vegetable oil with diesel lets users get some of the advantages of burning vegetable oil and is often done with no modification to the vehicle. * Biodiesel - If vegetable oil is transesterified it becomes biodiesel. Biodiesel burns like normal diesel and works fine in any diesel engine. The name just indicates that the fuel came from vegetable oil. * Straight vegetable oil - Straight vegetable oil works in diesel engines if it is heated first. Some diesel engines already heat their fuel, others need a small electric heater on the fuel line. How well it works depends on the heating system, the engine, the type of vegetable oil (thinner is easier), and the climate (warmer is easier). Some data is available on results users are seeing. As vegetable oil has become more popular as a fuel, engines are being designed to handle it better. The Elsbett engine is designed to run on straight vegetable oil. However, as of the start of 2007, it seems that there are not any production vehicles warrantied for burning straight vegetable oil, although Deutz offer a tractor and John Deere are known to be in late stages of engine development. There is a German rapeseed oil fuel standard DIN 51605. At this point straight vegetable oil is only a niche market although the market segment in Germany is rapidly growing with large haulage vehicle fleets adopting the fuel, largely for economic reasons. A growing number of decentralised oil mills provide a large part of this fuel. * Vegetable oil refining - Vegetable oil can be used as feedstock for an oil refinery. There it can be transformed into fuel by hydrocracking (which breaks big molecules into smaller ones using hydrogen) or hydrogenation (which adds hydrogen to molecules). These methods can produce gasoline, diesel, or propane. Some commercial examples of vegetable oil refining are NExBTL, H-Bio, and the ConocoPhilips Process. The transition can start with biodiesel, vegetable oil refining, and vegetable oil blends, since these technologies do not require the capital outlay of converting an engine to run on vegetable oils. Because it costs to convert vegetable oil into biodiesel it is expected that vegetable oil will always be cheaper than biodiesel. After there are production cars that can use straight vegetable oil and a standard type available at gas stations, consumers will probably choose straight vegetable oil to save money. So the transition to vegetable oil can happen gradually.  Electricity generation  Other methods, like nuclear power, fusion power, wind power and solar power, may provide cheaper electricity, so vegetable oil may only be used in peaking power plants and small power plants, as diesel is limited to today. There is at least one 5 MW power plant that runs on biodiesel. MAN B&W; Diesel, W√§rtsil√§ and other companies produce engines suitable for power generation that can be fueled with pure plant oils.  Market, cost, price, and taxes  In some countries, filling stations sell bio-diesel more cheaply than conventional diesel. In Europe, straight vegetable oil (SVO) costs 150 pence/litre at most supermarkets and somewhat less when bought in bulk direct from the manufacturers whereas diesel costs at least 130 pence per litre (in the UK ) to well over that (depends on the year, 1.4 euro is the current market price in central Europe). In the USA, diesel costs about 0,6 $ per liter and the cheapest SVO costs about the same, with more expensive oils costing more than that (up to $7 per gallon). The availability of biodiesel around the World is increasing. It is estimated that by 2010 the market for biodiesel will be 7.5 billion litres (2 billion USgallons) in the U.S and 9.5 billion litres (2.5 billion USgallons) in Europe. Biodiesel currently has 3% of the diesel market in Germany and is the number 1 alternative fuel. The German government has a Biofuels Roadmap in which they expect to reach 10% biofuels by 2010 with the diesel 10% coming from fuel made from vegetable oil. From 2005 to 2007 a number of types of vegetable oil have doubled in price. The rise in vegetable oil prices is largely attributed to biofuel demand. Much of the fuel price at the pump is due to fuel tax. If you buy vegetable oil at the grocery store it does not have such high taxes. So at times people have bought vegetable oil at the store for their cars because it was cheaper. They did this in spite of the fact that packaging by the gallon adds to the cost and it was illegal to use in a car since no fuel tax had been paid on it. Since vegetable oil (even as biodiesel) does not contribute to greenhouse gas, governments may tax it much less than gasoline as they have done with ethanol. This would help them reach Kyoto protocol targets.  Production in sufficient quantity  African Oil Palm (Elaeis guineensis The World production of vegetable oil seed is forecast to be 418 million tonnes in 2008/09. After pressing this will make 131 million tonnes of vegetable oil. Much of this is from Oil Palm, and palm oil production is growing at 5% per year. At about 7.5 lb/USgal (900 g/L) this is about 38 billion USgallons (144 billion L). Currently vegetable oil is mostly used in food and some industrial uses with a small percentage used as fuel. The major fuel usage is by conversion to biodiesel with about in 2009. In 2004 the US consumed 530 billion litres (140 billion USgal) of gasoline and 150 billion litres (40 billion USgal) of diesel. In biodiesel it says oil palm produces 5940 litres per hectare (635 USgal/acre) of palm oil each year. To make of vegetable oil each year would require or a square of land on a side. \\"The gradual move from oil has begun. Over the next 15 to 20 years we may see biofuels providing a full 25 percent of the world's energy needs. While the move is good for reducing greenhouse emissions, soaring oil prices have encouraged most countries to 'go green' by switching to greater use of biofuels.\\" - Alexander M√ºller, Assistant Director- General of Sustainable Development at the FAO. Algaculture could potentially produce far more oil per unit area. Results from pilot algaculture projects using sterile CO2 from power plant smokestacks look promising. Genetic modifications to soybeans are already being used. Genetic modifications and breeding can increase vegetable oil yields. From 1979 to 2005 the soybean yield in bushels per acre more than doubled. A company has developed a variety of camelina sativa that yields 20% more oil than the standard variety. Environmental effects Jungle burned for agriculture in southern Mexico. There is concern that the current growing demand for vegetable oil is causing deforestation, with old forests being replaced with oil palms. When land is cleared it is often burned, which releases large amounts of the greenhouse gas CO2. Vegetable oil production would have to increase substantially to replace gasoline and diesel. With current technology such an increase in production would have a substantial environmental impact.  Food vs fuel debate  In some poor countries the rising price of vegetable oil is causing problems. There are those that say using a food crop for fuel sets up competition between food in poor countries and fuel in rich countries. Some propose that fuel only be made from non-edible vegetable oils like jatropha oil. Others argue that the problem is more fundamental. The law of supply and demand predicts that if fewer farmers are producing food the price of food will rise. It may take some time, as farmers can take some time to change which things they are growing, but increasing demand for biofuels is likely to result in price increases for many kinds of food. Some have pointed out that there are poor farmers and poor countries making more money because of the higher price of vegetable oil. With the use of non-edible vegetable oils produced by trees such as Millettia Pinnata (formerly Pongamia Pinnata) or the Moringa oleifera tree, both which grow on borderline or non-arable land, the food versus fuel debate becomes less of an either/or question. Apart from their facility of growing in non-arable and/or marginal land, these trees offer major advantages over peanut, soy-bean, sunflower, etc., in that they have long lives (up to 100 years), very low maintenance (since the intensive husbandry is limited to the first few years of their producing lives) and can provide cash-crops to rural areas, such as rural India. In the case of Millettia Pinnata and a few others, the fact that they are nitrogen-fixing legumes is another very important factor, in that they do not deplete the soil. Among other benefits of these trees is that they have root-systems that penetrate much deeper and do not compete with shallow-rooted plants, like grass (once the trees have attained a certain maturity). This means that the land can be used for multiple purposes, such as grazing for animals. Yet another benefit of using Millettia Pinnata to produce bio-diesel is that it can tolerate low rainfall (as little as 250 ml per year), far below what most food-crops require, thus reducing yet more their potential to compete.  Algae for vegetable oil production  Some species of algae contain as much as 50% vegetable oil. Algae have very high growth rates compared to plants normally used to produce vegetable oil. Potentially algae could produce much more oil per area of land than current farming methods. So producing vegetable oil this way should result in less deforestation and less competition for food production land. One expert wrote: \\"As demonstrated here, microalgal biodiesel is technically feasible. It is the only renewable biodiesel that can potentially completely displace liquid fuels derived from petroleum. Economics of producing microalgal biodiesel need to improve substantially to make it competitive with petrodiesel, but the level of improvement necessary appears to be attainable. \\" Where there is existing electricity generation using fossil fuels, there is a source of sterile CO2. This makes algaculture much easier. To grow algae you need lots of CO2, but if you get it from air you will also get all kinds of other organisms, some of which eat algae. Getting CO2 from a smokestack works out really well. Governments trying to address the external costs of coal power plants may have a carbon tax or carbon credit that provides additional motivation to use CO2 from smokestacks. Several commercial pilot plants are under construction. There is substantial research and development work in this area but as of 2007 there is no commercial vegetable oil produced from algae and used as biofuel. ExxonMobil is investing $600 million and estimates they are 5 to 10 years from significant production, but could invest billions in final development and commercialization. If and when the commercialization challenges are overcome, vegetable oil production could expand very rapidly. In 2012 President Obama supported the idea of getting oil from algae.

He was later also known as the count of Champagne and as Eudes II of Troyes. Biography Odo was the son of Stephen II of Troyes and Meaux, and Adele. He was still a minor at the death of his father, and his uncle Theobald III of Blois acted as regent of Troyes. In 1060, Odo married Adelaide of Normandy, daughter of Robert I, Duke of Normandy and widow of Enguerrand II, Count of Ponthieu, Lord of Aumale and Lambert II, Count of Lens. After the death of Enguerrand's only daughter Adelaide, her mother Adelaide of Normandy became her heir and hence through his marriage Odo acquired the title Count (or Earl) of Aumale in Normandy Jure uxoris (by right of his wife). Adelaide (sometime called Adeliza) was also sister of William the Conqueror, and Odo accompanied his brother-in-law in the Norman conquest of England (1066). Theobald III of Blois then seized Odo's counties in the Champagne region, One version states William I, for his services in the conquest gave Odo Holderness in Yorkshire. Another proposes that the Lordship of Holderness was granted to William's sister Adelaide, in 1087, and Odo became Earl of Holderness by right of his wife. Odo was, with Alan Rufus and Roger of Poitou, one of the commanders of the army sent by King William II to besiege William de St-Calais at Durham Castle after the Rebellion of 1088, and who signed St-Calais's guarantee of personal safety. Odo was implicated in a plot to place his son Stephen of Aumale on the English throne.C. Warren Hollister, 'Magnates and Curiales in Early Norman England', Viator, Vol. 8, No. 1 (1977), p. 68 Stephen was the first cousin of brothers William Rufus, King of England and Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy.David Crouch, The Normans; The History of a Dynasty (London; New York: Hambledon Continuum, 2007), p. 147 Stephen was apparently not put on trial himself as he may have been out of the king's reach in Normandy.Frank Barlow, William Rufus (London: Methuen, 1983), p. 358 Odo was imprisoned in 1095.

Family Odo had one son with Adelaide: Stephen, Count of Aumale (died 1127). In 1902 Richard Langrishe published a paper in which he put forward the theory that Odo was the primogenitor of the Irish family of Le Gras (Grace). This amended an older theory that Raymond FitzGerald (died 1185/1198) was the primogenitor. However Richard Roach (1970) upheld the older proposition, but more recently M. T. Flanagan (2004) disagreed with Roach because FitzGerald had no known legitimate heirs. Notes References   *.

Biography Tamura was born in what is now Sugamo, Tokyo. After graduation from the Third Metropolitan Commercial High School, he was hired by Tokyo Gas, but quit work after only one day. He then continued his studies, and was a graduate of the Literature Department of Meiji University, where he met a group of young poets interested in modernism. He was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1943, and although he did not see combat, the fact that many of his friends died in the war left him psychologically scarred. In 1947, after World War II, he revived the literary magazine Arechi (\\"The Waste Land\\"), with his surviving school friends, and became an important figure in post-war modern Japanese poetry. He also began translation work of English language novels, starting with the works of Agatha Christie. His first poetry anthology, Yosen no hi no yoru (\\"Four Thousand Days and Nights\\", 1956), introduced a hard tone to modern Japanese poetry, using paradoxes, metaphors, and sharp imagery to describe the sense of dislocation and crisis experienced by people who had suffered through the rapid modernization of Japan and the destruction of World War II. With the publication of Kotoba no nai sekai (\\"World Without Words\\", 1962), he was established as a major poet. He spent five months at the University of Iowa's International Writing Program in 1967-68 as Guest Poet. Later, he traveled to England, Scotland and India. These travel experiences filled another twenty eight volumes of poetry. He was awarded the prestigious Yomiuri Prize In 1984. Tamura was awarded the 54th Japan Academy of Arts Award for Poetry in 1998. He died of esophageal cancer later that same year. His grave is at the temple of My≈çhon-ji in Kamakura.

Written by B. J. Novak, who also acts in the show as sales representative Ryan Howard, and directed by Caddyshack and National Lampoon's Vacation director Harold Ramis, the episode aired in the United States on April 12, 2007 on NBC. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) attempts to prove life in an office is dangerous after Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) berates him about the dangers of the warehouse. The attempts lead him to the roof of the building, where he tries to show that depression caused by an office can lead to desperate circumstances. Meanwhile, gambling between the other employees of the office leads Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) to discover that she is still an outsider. Plot When Michael Scott (Steve Carell) repeatedly disrupts Darryl Philbin's (Craig Robinson) warehouse safety training session, Lonny Collins (Patrice O'Neal) and Darryl mock the office workers' safety session in retaliation, claiming that office work does not entail physical danger. Offended by Darryl's disdain for office safety training, Michael decides to demonstrate the risk of depression and suicide by jumping off the roof, landing on a hidden trampoline. When Michael tests out the trampoline by dropping a watermelon from the roof, it bounces off and hits an office worker's car, prompting it to be replaced by a bouncy castle hidden from the general view of the parking lot. From the roof of the building, Michael talks dramatically about the dangers of depression. When the bouncy castle is discovered, Jim and Pam realize that Michael is \\"going to kill himself pretending to kill himself.\\" The employees collectively talk Michael down from the roof, with Darryl doing most of the talking, to assure Michael that he is brave simply by living as himself. At the end, the car that was hit by the watermelon is revealed to be Stanley's (Leslie David Baker), who is shocked to see the mess. Meanwhile, the office staff begins betting on various things, from counting the jelly beans in Pam Beesly's (Jenna Fischer) candy dish to whether Creed Bratton (portrayed by the actor of the same name) will notice that his apple has been replaced with a potato. Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) loses every bet and realizes that she is still an outsider. Also, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is back after several weeks in anger management training, determined to make a fresh start with his co-workers. His attempts to go by the name Drew are unsuccessful, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) decides to shun Andy for three years, although he often \\"unshuns\\" him to inform him of Michael's plans. Production \\"Safety Training\\" was the second episode of the series directed by Harold Ramis. Ramis had previously directed the episode \\"A Benihana Christmas\\" earlier in the third season. The episode was the sixth of the series written by B. J. Novak. Novak also acts in the show as Ryan Howard. Brian Baumgartner, who portrays accountant Kevin Malone, stated that while director Harold Ramis didn't make any major changes in the script of \\"Safety Training\\", his input changed other points of the script. Baumgartner said that \\"...our structure and how the show is written is all there and pretty much doesn't change.

Early life Irina was born in Paris because her parents had been exiled for marrying without the permission of Tsar Nicholas II. Her parents' marriage was considered morganatic, meaning that her father had not married a woman of equal rank, and their children took their mother's rank rather than their father's. Irina's mother was later granted the title of Princess Paley by Tsar Nicholas II. The family was allowed to return to Russia during World War I. Princesses Irina (right) and Natalia Paley Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Grand Duke Paul, who was too ill to register with the rest of the Romanov family, was under close observation by the new government. Irina later recalled how her father walked with her and her younger sister in the garden and talked about what his marriage had meant to him: > He spoke to us at length about all that he owed to our mother, all that she > had brought to him which he had never known in his life before, and about > all that she had been to him.

They later had a son, Prince Michael Feodorovich of Russia, on 4 May 1924. She began an affair with Count Hubert de Monbrison (15 August 1892 ‚Äì 14 April 1981) during her marriage to Feodor and bore Hubert a daughter, Irene Romanov, on 7 May 1934, while still married to Feodor.

In eukaryotes and archaea, this is the sole class 1 release factor (eRF) which recognizes all three stop codons. The overall process of termination is similar in bacteria, but in the latter 2 separate codon-recognizing release factors exist, RF1 and RF2.  Function  Termination of protein biosynthesis and release of the nascent polypeptide chain are signaled by the presence of an in-frame stop codon at the aminoacyl site of the ribosome. The process of translation termination is universal and is mediated by protein release factors (RFs) and GTP. A class 1 RF recognizes the stop codon and promotes the hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the polypeptide chain with the peptidyl site tRNA, a reaction catalyzed at the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome. Class 2 RFs, which are not codon specific and do not recognize codons, stimulate class 1 RF activity and confer GTP dependency upon the process. In bacteria, both class 1 RFs, RF1 and RF2, recognize UAA; however, UAG and UGA are decoded specifically by RF1 and RF2, respectively. In eukaryotes, eRF1, or ETF1, the functional counterpart of RF1 and RF2, functions as an omnipotent RF, decoding all 3 stop codons.

Formed in Greater Manchester in the mid-1980s, the band specialised in a kind of electric violin and guitar-driven rock music, and released their debut single in 1986. Whilst the band earned some critical acclaim from the UK music press, commercial success eluded them and the group disbanded in the early 1990s following the release of their second studio album, Blowzy Weirdos (1991). An album of new material plus some older songs appeared in 2009 credited to both King of the Slums and Slum Cathedral User, which was the original name of the group. Two more albums followed, Manco Diablo (2017) and Artgod Dogs (2018). History King of the Slums formed in Manchester, England, by writer Charley Keigher aka Charlie Keighera (vocals, guitar) and Sarah Curtis (electric violin), initially as Slum Cathedral User.Middles, Mick (1988) \\"Slum Chums! King of the Slums on the Fiddle\\", Underground, April 1988 ‚Äì Issue 13, p. 11 Joined by bassist John Eccles in early 1985, they recorded a demo tape at Crimson Studios in Urmston, Manchester with the help of a drummer who left the band soon after. The band took up its image of Kings of the slums incorporating a plastic dustbin and a tambourine replacing the drums which added to their 'Slums' authenticity when playing live. They won Muze magazine's Band of the Year competition winning a recording session at a studio in Gorton. Manchester, producing a second demo tape. Their third demo tape came soon after at a recording studio in Uppermill high up in the Saddleworth Moor. During the second and third demo tape recordings the group made its vinyl recording debut with the \\"Spider Psychiatry\\" single in 1986 on a small independent label SLR Records.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, During this time they gigged at various Manchester venues as a three piece with their now trademark dustbin drum and homemade stage. The single, reviewed by Melody Maker, never made any significant sales. In mid 1987 Eccles left the band. Sarah Curtis had studied violin at the Royal Northern College of Music, but dropped out before finishing her studies. Further releases followed in 1988 and 1989 on the Play Hard label, now with bassist Jon Chandler and drummer Ged O'Brien (who replaced a succession of drummers), most of which were collected on the album Barbarous English Fayre (1989). The band also recorded a session for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show in 1988.King of the Slums Peel session, at the BBC's Keeping it Peel site An incendiary live performance of \\"Fanciable Headcase\\", shown on the influential Snub TV television programme, earned the band national exposure, and helped to push their EPs up the independent chart, \\"Bombs Away on Harpurhey\\" reaching No. 8.Lazell, Barry (1997) Indie Hits 1980‚Äì1989, Cherry Red Books, Larkin, Colin (1992) The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Guinness Publishing, After switching to Midnight Music, the band issued its debut album proper, Dandelions (1989), to favourable reviews in the British music press. Keigher and Curtis were now joined by a new rhythm section. The following year, King of the Slums signed to Cherry Red Records and issued the Blowzy Weirdos album in 1991, with Keigher's gritty take on British life again finding favour amongst the critics. Later in the year, however, the band broke up without ever achieving a commercial breakthrough to match their critical acclaim. They performed nearly 200 concerts during their career resulting in numerous bootlegs being circulated, all of which the band disowned. A cult following has remained and grown over the years since the band broke up. In 2009 the reformed King of the Slums released their fourth album called The Orphaned Files, a collection of predominately brand new songs together with some rare and remixed older songs, through their own label, SLR Records. It was followed by Manco Diablo on 8 June 2017, also on SLR. Three months after the release, the band decided to record Artgod Dogs. The album, featuring a new member, Clarissa Trees on violin & viola, came out on 19 May 2018. They performed a one off live event at Manchester's Night and Day caf√© on 23 June 2018.

Intuitively, this kind of singularity can be formed by cutting a slit in the disk and passing another part of the disk through the slit. More precisely, this type of singularity is a closed arc consisting of intersection points of the disk with itself, such that the preimage of this arc consists of two arcs in the disc, one completely in the interior of the disk and the other having its two endpoints on the disk boundary. Morse-theoretic formulation A slice disc M is a smoothly embedded D^2 in D^4 with M \\\\cap \\\\partial D^4 = \\\\partial M \\\\subset S^3. Consider the function f\\\\colon D^4 \\\\to \\\\mathbb R given by f(x,y,z,w) = x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2. By a small isotopy of M one can ensure that f restricts to a Morse function on M. One says \\\\partial M \\\\subset \\\\partial D^4 = S^3 is a ribbon knot if f_{M}\\\\colon M \\\\to \\\\mathbb R has no interior local maxima. Slice-ribbon conjecture Every ribbon knot is known to be a slice knot. A famous open problem, posed by Ralph Fox and known as the slice-ribbon conjecture, asks if the converse is true: is every (smoothly) slice knot ribbon? showed that the conjecture is true for knots of bridge number two. showed it to be true for three-strand pretzel knots. However, suggested that the conjecture might not be true, and provided a family of knots that could be counterexamples to it. References *. Reprinted by Dover Books, 2010. *. *. *. *.

Mannathara is part of the Vathikudy Gramapanchayath and Idukki Talku. The word mannathra evolves from the name of a tribal group called Mannan. Mannans were the early inhabitants of in the region. It is believed that Mannans migrated from the dry plains of Tamil Nadu in search of livelihood in the hills. They were engaged in mainly hill cultivation of ragi, millet and rice as well as gathering cardamom, hill pepper, honey and other medicinal plants for exchange from the early period. The word Mannathra refers to a burial ground of the Mannan. The village had evidence of megalithic settlement sites. However, the majority of the material pieces of evidence to learn more about the prehistoric and early historic periods are not surviving. However, the ecological settings of this micro-region call attention from paleo- archaeologists. The continuous human intervention started in the mid-twentieth century destroyed most of the historically rich sites. Upto the late nineteenth century, this area was part of the Western Ghats forest controlled by the Travancore State. With the expansion of the Travancore state power to the hills, state sub-contractors engaged in the collection of forest resources such as honey, cardamom and waxes for the commercial agents of Travancore Government and traders from Tamil plains and Kerala. The tribal groups were incorporated into this process of extraction of forest resources. Later, Cardamom cultivation as a commercial enterprise flourished in the early decades of the twentieth century with the expansion of the market for spices. The place called near Mannathara Kanam refers back to the Elakananm (cardamom plantation) existed in the pre-1980s period. Migration of the peasants in the 1950s and 1960s was the major turning point in the history of this forest hilly region into an agrarian village. The economic depression of the 1930s, the Second World War, and a remarkable increase in the population in the agrarian mid-land forced low holding peasants to clear forest land to cultivate food crops and cash crops. The migrant peasants practised both dryland cultivation of rice, cassava (tapioca), Lemon Grass oil, cardamom, ginger, pepper, and other spices. Landless and smallholding farmers from the erstwhile princely state regions; mainly from Palai, Ettumanoor, Kothamangalam, Thodupuzha, and Melukavu migrated to western Ghats. This was largely connected with the larger project to accelerate the production of 'cash crops'. In the later decades, the entire high range, as Father Vadakkan mentioned in his biography Ente Kuthippum Kitaappum became the backbone of the Kerala Economy. This village is famous for its high quality black pepper. Black pepper and cardamon from this area had been considered as special quality in the Mattancherry spice market in Cochin. But the leaf disease of black pepper (Kurumulku valli) in the late 1980s onwards was a major backlash to the agrarian change of Mannathara. Moreover, the import of black pepper from other parts of the world to Cochin port and mixing of the imported goods with high-quality pepper from idukki affected the demand of high range pepper in the international market. In the 1990s as elsewhere in India, Neo-liberal policies of the government affected Mannathara's agro-economy as well. The rollback of the Government of Indian and the State government from the welfare policies for peasants and elimination of subsidy for fertilizers increased the risk of investment. The risk of investment was high in the case of ginger, plantain, and areca nut cultivation. The heavy fluctuations in the climate and various crop diseases increased the burden of the peasants. Cultivation of cassava (tapioca) and rice and milk products were the ways to meet their ends. Milma (APCOS) corporation of the Kerala State Government was a helping hand to the peasants. Nursing as a profession with employment chances attracted the lower-middle-class peasant families. The agrarian crisis of compelled young women to prefer nursing as a profession to support the family. Trained nurses, mostly from Syrian Christian and ezhava families migrated to middle eastern countries, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai. Now there are a few families has its members in America and England. Daughters of Chennamkulam Pappachan and the son of Paulose Eenthumkal are in the USA. Although most of the lower-middle- class family remain unchanged in their economic condition, some of the families enjoy economic mobility,  Geography  Until the beginning of the 21st Century, a long strip of rice field was the landmark and the main attraction of Mannathara. The Swampy land between two hills formed wetland paddy field with a two-meter wide and one and a half meter deep stream called the Mannathara thodu. The Mannathra thodu flowing in the middle of the rice field is the lifeline of Mannathara, which eventually joined the Periyar river. Now the decline in rice production due to various reasons affected the Mannathara rice filed as well. Overflowing of this stream in the heavy monsoon months helps to balance the fertility of this rice field. But the first thing we would have noticed in the last century would have been the poor transport infrastructure of this region. The Government had been largely ignoring the transport development of the region for decades. It is only after 1995, a positive reaction is visible from the side of authorities. Now, Rajamudi- Thoprumkudy main state high way and Mannathara-Perumthotty road are the lifelines of the village. These two tarred roads connect Mannathra with other villages and market places including Kattappana, Murickassery, Cheruthony, and Nedumkandam and connects the region with a larger market place such as Thodupuzha, and Kothamangalam. Education 'Holy Family Upper Primary School:' The school had its early beginning in the 1950s as an informal learning centre alongside the Holy Family Church. Later, a lower primary government school was established at Kiliyar and the upper primary section continued in the church. The school is popularly known as the Mannathara school. This school has produced a list of distinguished alumni from the neighbourhood of the school. This list of former students includes Siby Mathew Vattappilil (Engineer Canada), Justin Mathew Olickal (Professor, Delhi University), Fr. Jimmy Kuzhikandathil (Idukki), Fr. Binoy Chathanattu (Idukki), Dr. Sr. Swapna Mathew Olickal (Thiruvanathapuram), Fr. Shinto Mangalathu and many more. Major Roads Roads suitable for motor vehicle transport was developed from the 1980s onward. Most of the tarred roads are PWD or Panchayath maintained. All these roads were initially one-foot tracks developed by the community cooperation of the local people, mostly farmers.

Band history Gutworm recorded their debut EP at Backstage Studios, Nottingham, with hardcore producer Dave Chang. This release, titled Torn From Me, was released early in 2000. Metal Hammer awarded it 9/10, writing \\"I can‚Äôt believe this band are British and unsigned!\\" After several tours across the country Gutworm ventured to the USA and became the first unsigned British band to perform at the November To Dismember Metalfest in California. The band played alongside acts such as Morbid Angel and Testament and returned soon after to play at the New Jersey Metal Meltdown, which featured bands such as Nile and The Haunted. The band soon signed to European label SPV GmbH and recorded twelve songs at Karo Studios in Germany during March 2001. Following lengthy delays, which saw the album release date being pushed further and further back, Gutworm parted company with the label. After a break, Gutworm resumed touring the country, attracting the attention of new British label Anticulture Records, which signed the band in 2003. They went on to record an album featuring new material with Greg Chandler (of Esoteric) at Priory Studios in Birmingham. Gutworm‚Äôs full-length album Ruin The Memory was released nationwide in June 2004. Since the album‚Äôs release Gutworm have been busier than ever. After a performance at the Bloodstock Indoor 2004 festival, which received 4Ks in Kerrang! magazine, Gutworm produced their first major video for album opener What You Are which was broadcast on digital music channels Scuzz and MTV2.

The spool knitting devices are called knitting spools, knitting nancys, or French knitters. The technique is to wrap the yarn around the spool's pegs. The yarn is then lifted over, thereby creating stitches. This process is repeated continually until the project is complete. Spool knitting is a traditional way to teach children the basic principles of knitting. According to Mary McCormack, author of Spool Knitting (published in 1909), \\"Few elementary exercises have aroused more interest in the child than the toy knitting; due, perhaps, to its simplicity and his power to do it easily and well.\\" Spool knitters typically have four or five pegs (or brass nails), although the number can range from sixteen to more than one hundred. Many things can be made from the resulting tube. For example, it can be wound in a spiral to produce a mat or rug or, if a larger spool with more nails is used, a sock or a hat could be made. Historically, spool knitting has been used to make horse reins. Spools sold as \\"knitting nancys\\" sometime had a picture of a girl painted or printed on them, thus resembling a wooden doll. Homemade knitting spools are sometimes made by placing a peg-like object, such as a nail, into a hard solid object, such as a block of wood. Modern plastic knitting spool with crank I-cord is a similar, but not identical, knitting technique. Knitting spools are the oldest members of the loom family, with a history dating back over 400 years. It has been speculated, however, that the so-called Roman dodecahedra may have been used as glove knitting devices, dating to c. 1st‚Äì5th century CE. Beginning in the latter half of the 20th century, various small looms (usually plastic) using the same peg-knitting technique as knitting spools have been made. Some are larger than knitting spools, and can knit larger items. Some are straight, enabling flat items such as blankets or scarfs to be made, and some are round for making socks, hats, or other similar items. Simple versions contain just peg-like structures sticking up from a solid object. More complex ones operate complex mechanisms and automatically produce a knitted item with just a simple motion, such as a turn of a crank.

David Alcock was a descendant of Bishop John Alcock, the founder of Jesus College, Cambridge. Thomas was educated at Boteler Grammar School Warrington, then matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford in 1728, proceeded B.A. in 1731 and M.A. in 1741.Woodland, Patrick, ‚ÄòAlcock, Thomas (1709‚Äì1798)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 , accessed 1 March 2007 Ministry He was licensed as curate of Stonehouse, Plymouth in 1731. In November 1732 he began acting as the minister of the nearby parish of St Budeaux to which he was officially licensed the following year. He was also instituted as vicar of Runcorn in 1756 and ran this parish as a pluralist with the aid of curates. He was a Cheshire J.P. but continued to spend most of his time in Devon and only returned to Runcorn towards the end of his life. He became popular locally, particularly when he omitted to collect tithes. He was also noted for his eccentric habits, his spartan lifestyle, and his kindness to the poor to whom he also acted as doctor and lawyer. In 1769 the living of St Andrew, Plymouth became vacant and Alcock expected to be elected to it. He was unsuccessful and refused to preach his regular sermon at the church or indeed to enter the church again. In 1771 he helped to purchase land at Weston Peverel to provide a master for the St Budeaux charity school and to clothe the poor. In 1769 he was granted the freedom of the borough of Plymouth. Farmer and cidermaker The Endemial Colic of Devon not Caused by a Solution of Lead in the Cyder Thomas Alcock farmed at Ernesettle and described himself as ‚ÄòA Cydermaker‚Äô. He attacked the excise duty on cider and this was repealed in 1766. It had been suggested that a severe colic peculiar to Devon was the result of lead poisoning from the presses, pipework, and storage vessels of cider. This was refuted by Alcock who argued that the colic resulted only from the small shot used in bottle cleansing. Personal and family life  He married Mary Harwood of Ernesettle, Plymouth and through his marriage he obtained considerable property locally. The marriage was childless and Mary died in 1777. Alcock married again at the age of 78 and returned to Runcorn where he died in 1798. His estate included ¬£20,000 in 3% consols as well as land and property in Runcorn.

The tour undertaken by the Philadelphian cricketers was very ambitious. Though the results may have been less satisfactory than hoped for by promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a low level of competition. In 1897 a schedule was made including all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worth while to put their best elevens onto the field. Starting on June 7 at Oxford, the tour lasted for two months and ended in late July at The Oval. While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Patterson and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on June 17. The team fared very well and soundly beat the English side. Patterson, though, had a relatively poor performance scoring only eight runs and not taking any wickets. The star of the match was undoubtedly John Barton King. Despite the excitement surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall on the tour. Fifteen matches were played, but only two were won while the team lost nine and earned a draw on four. The other win of the tour came against Warwickshire, though Patterson also performed poorly in this match. Patterson was second in his team's averages with 33, his best innings was 162 at Trent Bridge against Nottinghamshire. There were some claims, though, in the Philadelphia Public Ledger that the Philadelphians had been treated unfairly by the English umpires, but captain Patterson put those rumors to rest with a letter to the editor of an American newspaper: > My attention has been directed to a letter signed W.S. in the Field of July > 24th, enclosing a clipping from the Philadelphia Public Ledger, severely > criticising the umpiring in the Philadelphian matches during our tour > through England. I wish to state on behalf of the Philadelphia team that the > sentiments expressed in the clipping are not those of the team, and that we > emphatically repudiate any insinuation of unfair treatment. On the contrary, > we have been received with the most unvarying courtesy and fairness both on > and off the field. I wish to take this opportunity of making a public > acknowledgement of our indebtedness to Mr. Perkins, of the M.C.C., for the > umpires assigned to us, and to testify, unnecessary though it be, to their > ability and integrity. The match that the Philadelphians played against the MCC was to be Patterson's last first-class cricket match. =Other matches= At the club and first- class level in the United States, Patterson continued to show his batting skill. His highest score in a first-class match was 271. This is still the record first-class score for a player from a non-Test nation. Four times he exceeded a thousand runs in a season, and in 1891, besides making 1,402 (average 50), he took 112 wickets at 7.97 each. With F. H. Bohlen, who died in December 1942, Patterson made 200 for the first wicket against Frank Mitchell's University team that visited Philadelphia in 1895. Patterson died in Philadelphia in 1943 at the age of 74.

Truchard is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences. Biography Truchard was born June 25, 1943, in Austin County, Texas, the fourth of seven children born to Joe Truchard and Lillie Schneider. Truchard earned a B.S. and an M.S. in physics, and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. Following his graduation, Truchard worked as managing director of the acoustical measurements division at the U.T. Applied Research Laboratories. Founding a company After two years of working for U.T., Truchard realized that there was little room for promotion unless one of his coworkers retired. As he often remarks, he \\"didn't see a job I wanted [in Austin] - so I created one!\\" Working with colleagues Jeff Kodosky and Bill Nowlin, Truchard was part of a project conducting research for the U.S. Navy that allowed them to use early computer technology to collect and analyze data. Frustrated with the inefficient data collection methods they were using, the three decided to create a product that would enable their task to be done more easily. In 1976, working in the garage at Truchard's home, the three founded National Instruments and began designing an interface board. The group hired their first employee, Kim Harrison-Hoson in 1977 to process orders and deal with customers. Truchard's job at UT had provided him with some experience in developing products but not with managing employees or a business, so he read many books on the business and management principles in order to learn how to run a company. In 1979, as they reached $300,000 in sales, Truchard was able to leave his job at UT to concentrate on his new company full-time. In 1986, in conjunction with Kodosky, Truchard played a pivotal role in the development of the LabVIEW graphical development software, which allows scientists to quickly build solutions for their measurement and automation needs. The graphical programming interface that LabVIEW provided revolutionized the way engineers and scientists worked. National Instruments After the release of LabVIEW, the company's future seemed secured. Under Truchard's leadership, NI has seen growth and record revenue in 35 of its 37 years (except 2001 and 2009). With the goal of balancing the success of customers, employees, shareholders, and suppliers, Truchard has led with a conservative, deliberate approach. The company focuses on innovation, growth, and expansion and prizes innovation and entrepreneurship, and has been named as one of the Fortune \\"100 Best Companies to Work For\\" for fourteen consecutive years (2000‚Äì2013). Affectionately known to his employees as \\"Dr. T\\", Truchard insists that he and others in the management structure at NI remain accessible to their employees. Despite his stature as the sole CEO in the company's history, Truchard is still an approachable and down-to-earth individual. He still drives an old pick up truck to work, where he does not have an assigned parking space. Unless he is scheduled to attend an external business meeting, Truchard wears denim jeans to work every day, and sits in a cubicle in the middle of the 8th floor, where employees are free to walk up and discuss any issues they might have. On January 1, 2017, Truchard retired as president, CEO, and cofounder. He continues to hold his position as chairman of the board. =Professional activities and recognition= Shortly after the development of LabVIEW, in 1987 Truchard received one of the first Texas High Technology Entrepreneur awards. Twelve years later he was awarded a Texas High Technology Master Entrepreneur of the Year honor. He was named one of the nation's 50 Best CEOs in three consecutive years by Worth Magazine. In 2002, Truchard was inducted into the Electronic Design Engineering Hall of Fame, and the following year he was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences. He has also been named a University of Texas Distinguished Engineering Graduate, and in 2007 Truchard was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. Truchard is a member and former chairman of the Engineering Foundation Advisory Council, and is a member of the University of Texas Chancellor's Council. He previously served on the UT Electrical and Computer Engineering Visiting Committee, and was a founding member of the Austin Software Council. Texas governor Rick Perry appointed Truchard to the state's Advisory Council on the Digital Economy and invited Truchard to chair the Texas Science, Technology, and Math Industry Advisory Council, which seeks to reverse the declining interest of young people in technical careers. Personal life Truchard lives in Austin, Texas in a house overlooking Lake Austin. He had four children with his wife Lee, who died in 2012 after prolonged illness. In August 2015 he married Marci Truchard. As of March 2018, he is worth an estimated $1.1 billion. Truchard is heavily invested in the advancement and curing of Alzheimer's disease and funds projects, such as the Oskar Fischer Project, to do so.

The ranking is published by the Cybermetrics Lab, a research group of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) located in Madrid. The aim of the Ranking is to improve the presence of the academic and research institutions on the Web and to promote the open access publication of scientific results. The ranking started in 2004 and is updated every January and July. As of 2020 it provides Web indicators for more than 30,000 universities worldwide. The Webometrics Ranking of Business Schools is a similar ranking of the world's Business Schools. Objectives The Webometrics University Ranking is a ranking system based on university web presence, visibility and web access. This ranking system measures how strongly a university is present in the web by its own web domain, sub-pages, rich files, scholarly articles etc. The central hypothesis of this approach is that web presence is a reliable indicator of the global performance and prestige of the universities and as such, is an indirect way to measure all the university missions (teaching, research, transfer). Although the Web is universally recognized as one of the most relevant tools for scholarly communication, it is still very rare these indicators are used for the evaluation of the scientific research and the academic performance of universities. Webometric indicators are provided to show the commitment of the institutions to Web publication. A research paper in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Scientometrics found \\"reasonable similarities\\" between the Webometrics rankings and other prominent university rankings despite using a very different set of features to determine each university's rank. These similarities were increased when the comparison was limited solely to European universities. Top universities are publishing millions of pages produced by dozens of departments and services, hundreds of research teams and thousands of scholars. Strong web presence informs of a wide variety of factors that are clearly correlated with the global quality of the institution: widespread availability of computer resources available, global internet literacy, policies promoting democracy and freedom of speech, competition for international visibility or support of open access initiatives, among others. Impact In Namibia, the Webometrics list is frequently used in public interaction, particularly with respect to the country's two main state-funded institutions of tertiary education, the University of Namibia and the Polytechnic of Namibia. The 2009-2011 rankings have received significant press coverage and individual rankings have been published on the websites of universities in countries in the Middle East, East Asia, Europe, Canada and Africa. The Webmometrics data were referred to as a reference point to achieve better online visibility and performance of higher education institutions.

History In the early days of radiotherapy planning was performed on 2D x-ray images, often by hand and with manual calculations. Computerised treatment planning systems began to be used in the 1970s to improve the accuracy and speed of dose calculations. By the 1990s CT scans, more powerful computers, improved dose calculation algorithms and Multileaf collimators (MLCs) lead to 3D conformal planning (3DCRT), categorised as a Level 2 technique by the European Dynarad consortium. 3DCRT uses MLCs to shape the radiotherapy beam to closely match the shape of a target tumour, reducing the dose to healthy surrounding tissue. Level 3 techniques such as IMRT and VMAT utilise inverse planning to provide further improved dose distributions (i.e. better coverage of target tumours and sparing of healthy tissue). These methods are growing in use, particularly for cancers in certain locations which have been shown to derive the greatest benefits. Image guided planning Typically, medical imaging is used to form a virtual patient for a computer-aided design procedure. A CT scan is often the primary image set for treatment planning while magnetic resonance imaging provides excellent secondary image set for soft tissue contouring. Positron emission tomography is less commonly used and reserved for cases where specific uptake studies can enhance planning target volume delineation. Modern treatment planning systems provide tools for multimodality image matching, also known as image coregistration or fusion. Treatment simulations are used to plan the geometric, radiological, and dosimetric aspects of the therapy using radiation transport simulations and optimization. For intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), this process involves selecting the appropriate beam type (which may include photons, electrons and protons), energy (e.g. 6, 18 megaelectronvolt (MeV) photons) and physical arrangements. In brachytherapy planning involves selecting the appropriate catheter positions and source dwell times (in HDR brachytherapy) or seed positions (in LDR brachytherapy). The more formal optimization process is typically referred to as forward planning and inverse planning. Hendee W., Ibbott G. and Hendee E. (2005). Radiation Therapy Physics. Wiley-Liss Publ. . Plans are often assessed with the aid of dose-volume histograms, allowing the clinician to evaluate the uniformity of the dose to the diseased tissue (tumor) and sparing of healthy structures. =Forward planning= Treatment plan for an Optic nerve sheath meningioma In forward planning, the planner places beams into a radiotherapy treatment planning system that can deliver sufficient radiation to a tumour while both sparing critical organs and minimising the dose to healthy tissue. The required decisions include how many radiation beams to use, which angles each will be delivered from, whether attenuating wedges be used, and which MLC configuration will be used to shape the radiation from each beam. Once the treatment planner has made an initial plan, the treatment planning system calculates the required monitor units to deliver a prescribed dose to a specific area, and the distribution of dose in the body this will create. The dose distribution in the patient is dependent on the anatomy and beam modifiers such as wedges, specialized collimation, field sizes, tumor depth, etc. The information from a prior CT scan of the patient allows more accurate modelling of the behaviour of the radiation as it travels through the patient's tissues. Different dose calculation models are available, including pencil beam, convolution-superposition and monte carlo simulation, with precision versus computation time being the relevant trade- off. This type of planning is only sufficiently adept to handle relatively simple cases in which the tumour has a simple shape and is not near any critical organs. =Inverse planning= In inverse planning a radiation oncologist defines a patient's critical organs and tumour, after which a planner gives target doses and importance factors for each. Then, an optimisation program is run to find the treatment plan which best matches all the input criteria. In contrast to the manual trial-and-error process of forward planning, inverse planning uses the optimiser to solve the Inverse Problem as set up by the planner.

Loyal to the Bakufu, they were supposed to act as the protectors of the Tokugawa sh≈çgun, but were disbanded upon their arrival in Kyoto, Japan in 1863. History =Formation= Kiyokawa Hachir≈ç formed the R≈çshigumi with funding from the Tokugawa bakufu in October 19, 1862. Originally, he claimed it was formed for protecting the Tokugawa sh≈çgun in Kyoto and preparing for military action against Western countries. However, he lied to the regime; his goal was to gather people to work with the imperialists and not the shogunate government. The R≈çshigumi met on March 26 (lunar calendar February 8), 1863 in Edo and they all left for Kyoto. Kond≈ç Isami, Hijikata Toshiz≈ç, Okita S≈çji, Inoue Genzabur≈ç, T≈çd≈ç Heisuke, Harada Sanosuke, Nagakura Shinpachi. Serizawa Kamo, Niimi Nishiki, Nakazawa Koto Hirayama Gorou, Hirama Juusuke, and Noguchi Kengi were all among the members of the R≈çshigumi. Two days later, while the R≈çshigumi left for Kyoto, Kondo was responsible for assigning lodges for the members. However, he accidentally forgot about Serizawa's group, leading to a famous incident where Serizawa lost his temper and, with the help of his group, created a huge bonfire outside the lodges as an insult to Kondo. =Disbandment= On April 10 (lunar calendar February 23), 1863, the R≈çshigumi arrived at Kyoto and the group stayed in Yagitei, a Mibu village outside Kyoto. Surprisingly, when they had just arrived in Kyoto, Kiyokawa suddenly commanded the group to return to Edo. By then, he had secretly submitted a letter to the imperialists stating that his R≈çshigumi were to work only for the Emperor K≈çmei. Aftermath The disbanded R≈çshigumi members returned to Edo upon Kiyokawa's command. However, nineteen members, mainly from the Mito clan dissented and stayed behind, including Kond≈ç and Serizawa, and formed the '''''. Initially, the Mibu R≈çshigumi were called , meaning \\"r≈çnin of Mibu\\". At the time, Mibu was a village south west of Kyoto, and was the place where they were stationed. In August 18, 1863, the Mibu R≈çshigumi was renamed the '''''. In response, a Tokugawa bakufu official made spies out of former R≈çshigumi members Tomouchi Yoshio and Iesato Jiro, and forced them to stay in Kyoto and join Serizawa and Kondo's group in order to keep an eye on them. The other dissident members of the R≈çshigumi who returned to Edo became the founding members of the ''''' (the Shinsengumi's brother league in Edo) with Okita Rintar≈ç, the brother-in-law of Okita S≈çji, as a commander.

He was the son of Dario Varotari the Elder and the brother of painter Chiara Varotari, who accompanied him on his travels and assisted with his work.Alessandro Varotari in the RKD Biography Born in Padua, from which his nickname derives, he was the son of the local painter and architect Dario Varotari the Elder, who most probably provided his earliest training. Early paintings such as The incredulity of St. Thomas,In the church of Santa Lucia in Padua. Virgin and Child,In the Duomo of Padua. and the PentecostIn the Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice. show the influence of Titian. Padovanino married Caterina Mesa 1612 in Padua. He moved to Venice in 1614. He is known to have traveled to Rome twice (in the mid-1610s and in 1625), where he was much employed in producing copies of major paintings by major Renaissance artists of the prior generation. In 1619 he worked on the mosaics of the Basilica of San Marco. In the following years he worked on decorating the interior of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore. In 1625 he made another trip to Rome. He painted a major battle canvas entitled The victory of the Carnuti (Celts) over the Normans.In the Brera Gallery, Milan His pupils included Pietro Liberi, Bartolomeo Scaliger, Pietro della Vecchia, Giulio Carpioni and his own son, Dario Varotari the Younger. His sister Chiara Varotari was a well known portraitist. Among his students was Caterina Tarabotti. Style Padovanino was a highly respected artist in his time. Although he had earned much of his fame due to his talents as a copyist, he still deserves a place in the history of painting. He had learned painting in the style of Titian, to whose spirit and style he was faithful throughout his career. His career lasted well into the seventeenth century. His paintings are characterized for their narrative ability and their sensuality.

It is one block long with a sharp bend in the middle. The street runs south and then southeast from Pell Street to the intersection of Bowery, Chatham Square, and Division Street. Doyers Street contains several restaurants, barber shops, and hair stylists, as well as the Chinatown branch of the United States Postal Service. The Nom Wah Tea Parlor opened at 13 Doyers Street in 1920, and is still in operation; other longstanding business include Ting's Gift Shop at 18 Doyers. Etymology The street is named for Hendrik Doyer, an 18th-century Dutch immigrant who bought the property facing the Bowery in 1791Jerry E. Patterson, (Museum of the City of New York), The City of New York: a history illustrated from the collections 1978:212. and operated a distillery where the post office is now sited and the Plough and Harrow tavern near the corner with Bowery.Ostrow, Daniel and Sham, Mary (2008) Manhattan's Chinatown 105ff Notable sites From 1893 to 1911, 5‚Äì7 Doyers Street was the site of the first Chinese language theater in New York City. The theater was converted into a rescue mission for the homeless. In 1903, the theater was the site of a fundraiser by the Chinese community for Jewish victims of a massacre in Kishinev. Nom Wah Tea Parlor, opened in 1920, is the oldest continuously running restaurant in Chinatown. The restaurant first opened at 15 Doyers Street and moved to 13 Doyers in 1968. Doyers Street, along with Pell Street, contains numerous barber shops and beauty salons. The barber shops attract customers, many of whom are Chinese, from as far away as Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. =Crimes and shootings= Early in the century, the bend in the street became known as \\"the Bloody Angle\\" because of numerous killings among the Tong Gangs of Chinatown that lasted into the 1930s. Hatchets were frequently used, leading to the creation of the expression, \\"hatchet man\\". In 1994, law enforcement officials said that more people died violently at the \\"Bloody Angle\\" than at any other street intersection in the United States. One shooting at the Chinese Theater in 1905 claimed the lives of three people, when members of the Hip Sing Tong fired on members of the On Leong Tong. The shooting took place at a time when the theater was packed with 400 people. In one 1909 incident, two members of the On Leong Tong were shot, one fatally, by members of the rival Four Brothers‚Äô Society, or See Sing Tong. The shooting came after three members of the Hip Sing Tong were executed in Boston for the murder of a member of the On Leong tong. A number of old tenement houses are on Doyers Street, and these were sometimes subjected to fires. In 1910, four tenants died and five were injured when fire swept through the building at 15‚Äì17 Doyers. In 1939, a fire at the same building, described by The New York Times as \\"an old rabbit warren,\\" killed seven persons and injured sixteen. Fighting the fire was made difficult because of the narrowness of the street, and Mayor Fiorello La Guardia said at the scene of the fire that someday Chinatown would have to be torn down and replaced. Chuck Connors, a Tammany Hall operative and the political boss of Chinatown in the early part of the century, had his headquarters at the Chatham Club at 6 Doyers, where Irving Berlin reportedly entertained. That site is now occupied by Chinatown's post office. Usage Writing in H. L. Mencken's American Mercury in 1926, Herbert Asbury pointed out that the street serves no logical purpose, because it is a link between Chatham Square, the Bowery, and Pell Street, which also connects to the Bowery a few feet from Doyers. He called it \\"a crazy street, and there has never been any excuse for it.\\" He described Doyers Street as the \\"nerve center\\" of Chinatown because of the Chinese theater and Bloody Angle. As Doyers and Pell Streets are only accessible from southbound Bowery and traffic from both Bowery and Doyers Street can only continue to southbound Chatham Square, Doyers Street is very lightly used. By 2011, the street was lined with barbershops, restaurants, a United States Post Office at 6 Doyers Street, and an employment agency at 15-17 Doyers Street that serves recent immigrants of all ethnic backgrounds. As part of a September 2017 pilot program, the Chinatown Partnership converted Doyers Street to a pedestrian-only street during the daytime for one month. If the test is successful, the program would be expanded. The of the street between Bowery and the Post Office would be available for commercial access.

The intended orbital altitude is about 50 km. Planned experiments included measurements of lunar gravitational and magnetic fields. The main satellite would have also carried a microwave radar to probe beneath the lunar surface up to a depth of a few hundred meters. At maximum depth the radar would be able to resolve structures up to two meters. Science objectives The duration of the mission around the Moon will be four years, during which the charting of the entire lunar surface would take place. The survey is to be three-dimensional and in colour with one aim being to provide indications of significant geological formations that could later be of interest for drilling. The probe will also investigate the Moon's magnetic and gravity fields, look for water and analyse the minerals on its surface. It will use the best camera currently available, the best radar sensors and unique spectrum sensors for measuring the mineral composition.

The term was first used by Robert I. Levy, a psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist, to describe his psychodynamically informed approach to interviewing during his anthropological fieldwork in Tahiti and Nepal. A key distinction in person-centered interviewing is that between interviewees as informants and as respondents. As Levy and Hollan describe it, > There is a significant difference between asking a Tahitian interviewee > something like \\"Please describe for me exactly how and why supercision (a > penis-mutilating rite of passage) is done by Tahitians,\\" and asking him \\"Can > you tell me about your supercision?\\"...\\"Did it change your life in any way?\\" > \\"How?\\" \\"What did you think and feel about it then?\\" \\"What do you think and > feel about it now?\\"Levy, Robert I. and Douglas Hollan (1998) \\"Person- > Centered Interviewing and Observation in Anthropology.\\" Pp. 333-364 in > Handbook of Methods in Cultural Anthropology, edited by H. R. Bernard. > Walnut Creek, CA: Altamira Press. The first question engages interviewees as typical ethnographic informants, asking them to describe features of their culture or social system; the latter questions ask much more directly about their own experiences, feelings, hopes, and desires, as well as changes in these over time. Not surprisingly, asking about these more intimate topics generally requires much longer acquaintance with an interviewee than do questions about more publicly available knowledge. Levy and Hollan note that person-centered interviewing makes use of both modes and tacks back and forth between them; its difference from most methods of ethnographic interviewing lies in its emphasis on the latter and its concern with understanding how individuals relate to, experience, and understand their larger sociocultural context. Within these, major topics of interest typically include: the experience of the self, morality, the body, illness and healing, emotions, and family relationships. Methodologically, person-centered interviewing also depends on a fair degree of experience in self-monitoring for transference and countertransference phenomena, as well as attention to elisions, avoidances, and gaps in an interviewees' answers and attention to interviewees' emotional reactions during and outside the formal interview setting. Person-centered interviewing comes out of a psychodynamically informed tradition within Culture and Personality studies and American psychological anthropology and shares a number of methodological and thematic concerns with clinical ethnography.

Like Gerd Schultze-Rhonhof, he disputes Germany's guilt for the Second World War. Life Walendy was born in Berlin. . Towards the end of the war Walendy was drafted first into the Reichsarbeitsdienst (auxiliary force), then the Luftwaffenhelfer (child soldier in the air force) and finally into the regular Wehrmacht (the German military). He completed his Abitur (secondary education) in 1946 and then went to journalism school in Aachen. From 1950 to 1956 he studied political science at the Hochschule f√ºr Politik in West Berlin, where he received his diploma. Afterwards he worked as the director of a folk high school in Herford and as the business leader of an employers' association in Bielefeld. In 1965 he went independent and founded the Verlag f√ºr Volkstum und Zeitgeschichtsforschung (\\"Publishing House for Folklore and Contemporary Historical Research\\") in Vlotho. In 1999 ownership of the publishing house was transferred to his wife, since Walendy was barred from directing it due to his conviction and imprisonment for 15 months for publicly questioning the Holocaust. He maintains close contact with the Belgian revisionist organisation Vrij Historisch Onderzoek (VHO). Activity as author and publisher Besides other works Walendy oversaw the publication of numerous materials in which the Holocaust was denied and the Third Reich was generally presented in a positive light. Among others these include: * As early as 1964 he published his own book, Wahrheit f√ºr Deutschland ‚Äì Die Schuldfrage des Zweiten Weltkriegs (Truth for Germany ‚Äì The Question of Guilt for the Second World War), which in 1979 was listed by Germany's Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons as material that could not be publicly advertised or given to young readers, due to the version it presented of the events that led to World War II. This restriction was lifted in 1994, after a long legal battle, on the grounds that Walendy's constitutional rights had been violated, since the federal constitutional court ruled that even a supposedly biased representation could be defended as an academic work. A renewed attempt to have the work listed was abandoned in 2001 due to a negative assessment of the chances of success in the event of another court case. * Numerous copies of the historical revisionist magazine series Historische Tatsachen,Die Literatur der Auschwitzleugner: Udo Walendy, Historische Tatsachen Nr. 26 Holocaust- Referenz: Argumente gegen Auschwitzleugner. which continues to be published by the Vrij Historisch Onderzoek (VHO) in Flanders. Its very first edition from 1974 contains a German translation of Richard Harwood's Holocaust-denying booklet \\"Did Six Million Really Die?\\". * The German translation of Arthur Butz's book The Hoax of the Twentieth Century, in which the author attempts to discredit the evidence for the Holocaust. Walendy has been charged with criminal activity several times, including under Germany's Volksverhetzung law (incitement to hatred).

He was raised in Edmonton, Alberta. In 1968, he became involved in politics, being elected to Edmonton City Council. He had won the Vanier Award as one of Canada's \\"Five Most Outstanding Young Men,\\" for his work as a public relations officer and recreational director for the city. He served two terms on the council as an alderman, and ran for mayor in the 1970s with an unsuccessful outcome. As a personable politician, he successfully lobbied for the Commonwealth Games to be held in Edmonton. He ran his own open-line radio show at CJCA and CJOI-FM, with interview subjects such as Muhammad Ali. After attending law school, Kiviaq was the first Inuk to become a lawyer, and was responsible for several important advances in establishing the legal rights of the Inuit people. He was called to the bar in 1983, a moment recognized in a letter from then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau as a \\"solid and progressive achievement in the history of your people.\\" In September 2000, Mr. Ward made the initial application to change his name back to Kiviaq, the single-word Inuktituk name that his mother and Caucasian step-father gave him at birth. In 2001, he won that right.Names and Nunavut: Culture and Identity in the Inuit Homeland, by Valerie Alia; published by Berghahn Books, 2008; via Google Books In 2003, Edmonton City Council and mayor Bill Smith declared March 14 \\"Kiviaq Day\\". Athletic career Growing up in Edmonton, Kiviaq took to boxing to defend himself against racially motivated abuse from other children. He won his first Golden Gloves championship at age 13. He later became a prizefighter, winning 108 of 112 fights, capturing a string of provincial and Golden Glove championships. In 1955, aged 19, he became the first Inuk (or \\"Eskimo\\") to play on the Edmonton Eskimos football team. However, Kiviaq never played a regular-season game: before the season started, he had an accidental slip on the wet field which was followed by concurrent hits from three opposing players. However, despite his severe injuries, he subsequently made a full recovery. He later won a scholarship to play football at Northwestern State College in Louisiana. He was still eligible to play college ball because he had never earned a salary playing for the Eskimos. Health Kiviaq had M√©ni√®re's disease, and for much of his life was unable to travel on an airplane or be a passenger in a vehicle without becoming ill.

He also served as the principal of Services Hospital and Services Institute of Medical Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan. He suffered cardiac arrest on 16 August 2019 and was shifted to Iqra Medical Complex, where he was pronounced dead.Prof Dr Faisal Masood dies of cardiac arrest Education and career He obtained his MBBS degree in 1976, from Nishtar Medical College, Multan, securing overall top position and was selected as the 'best graduate'. He became a Member of Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh, Glasgow and London in 1982 and a Fellow of Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh in 1998. His area of interest is endocrinology. He started his teaching career from Allama Iqbal Medical College in 1982 and then moved on to teach at FJMC, King Edward Medical College, Lahore, Post Graduate Medical Institute, Lahore and Services Institute of Medical Sciences, Lahore. He was passionate in his belief that the medical colleges and universities should adopt liberalism. He encouraged basic research and sometimes referred clinical research as mere \\"stamp collecting effort\\". Although he himself started as a clinical researcher with numerous research publications to his credit, over time his emphasis shifted more towards the basic research. He wanted to create a multi-disciplinary research group as he often said,\\"The best research proposals come from cross insemination of ideas from unrelated fields\\". He managed to create an endowment fund for SIMS to provide annual research grants to the promising young researchers. In this process, he established a system of grant assessment and research audit. In 2003, in the face of stiff administrative opposition, he started a comprehensive diabetes management center at services hospital Lahore where he was serving as a professor at that time. His daughter helped him write a software for this center to create a huge database of more than 84,000 patients with diabetes. This center was upgraded with philanthropic support in 2004 to the full-fledged department of endocrinology and metabolism to impart post-graduate endocrine training. In recognition of this effort College of physicians and surgeons of Pakistan (CPSP) elected him as its first fellow in the field of endocrinology. Role in Dengue epidemic 2011 In 2011 when the province of Punjab faced an epidemic of Dengue fever,2011 dengue outbreak in Pakistan he was appointed by the government to head a group of experts to draw up treatment protocols and algorithms for its management. This group of experts DEAG (Dengue Expert Advisory Group) was instrumental in training of family physicians,q=Advice_to_General_Practitioners_and_Family_Doctors_by_Professor_Faisal_Masood doctors and paramedics and publication of GCP (Good Clinical Practice) guidelines for the management of dengue fever. For his efforts during this epidemic he was decorated with Tamgha-e-Imtiaz in August 2012. Soon afterwards he got promoted in recognition of the meritorious services rendered by him during the epidemic. PIC related drug reaction In early December 2011, soon after the end of dengue epidemic, Lahore hospitals started receiving patients with bone marrow suppression. Most of them tested positive for dengue IgM raising a possibility of some aberrant form of dengue disease. He was the first one to raise alarm about the possibility of a drug reaction, pointing to the common denominator of the consumption of PIC (Punjab Institute of Cardiology) dispensed medications. He strongly disagreed with the possibility of it being a variant of Dengue. He was a member appointed to inquire into this matter. He was proven right when the problem was traced to a heart medicine that was heavily contaminated with antimalarial (pyrimethamine) which is known for its hematological side effects.Pyrimethamine Hospital automation and EMR His enthusiasm to embrace IT as a tool for effective management and for gleaning authentic data for resource allocation was greeted with muted scepticism, considering the previous attempts at other institutions were the absolute failure. Within three years he not only prepared the EMR and hospital management software but also got it implemented.Services Hospital When asked he once said,\\"Changing the hardened attitudes in a public sector establishment is the biggest challenge\\". Although his administrative abilities were doubted, he proved his critics wrong when he established Services Institute of Medical Sciences, in the face of stiff opposition. Services Institute of Medical Sciences is now a premier destination for the students seeking quality medical education. He achieved phenomenal success in creating acceptability of the institution which was recognised by Pakistan Medical and Dental Council, University of Health Sciences and College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan. Results declared by the independent examining body, UHS, show extraordinary achievements of SIMS. He believed in the need for meticulous planning for the future while drawing up development plans. His development plans often faced bureaucratic obstacles for being too ambitious. He was relegated to political backwaters because he was often bracketed with the outgoing government of PML-Q of 2008; but in spite of the fiscal constraints he managed to upgrade the infra-structure including OPD tower, radiology block in addition to the three-story air-conditioned waiting hall, Accidents and Emergency Department with 16 slice CT Scanner thereby almost doubling the covered area of the hospital. His interest in the endocrine disorders was, perhaps, the reason behind the establishment of assisted conception Unit at SHL. Although a physician by training, his faculty members often call him a surgeon by temperament. Not surprisingly he invested disproportionately in surgical sector upgrading ENT, Urology, General surgery, Ophthalmology Department and operation theatres.  Early and personal life  Born in a conservative family of Kashmiri origin, with ancestral base at Shopian. He was educated at different schools as his father, who was a civil servant, got posted to different places all over Punjab. In spite of achieving top merit in his FSc, he opted to study at Nishtar Medical College to a great displeasure of his father. During his university time, he was not one of the most regular students but still managed to achieve top academic scores. Once asked latter in his life about his ambivalent attitude, He remarked, \\"They didn't cater for my needs\\". His education in the UK was marked by his training by his mentor.

History The race was inaugurated in 1951, but was limited to local competition. It was rebranded after the Spanish cyclist in 1998. In 2005, the race was upgraded to a 1.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour. For 2007 and 2008 the race was further upgraded to a 1.HC event. The race will become part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020. These higher grades have attracted an increasingly competitive and international field of racers. The race often loops through the city of Estella-Lizarra, in the Spanish region of Navarre. The modern race always includes several challenging climbs and thus tends to favor a fast all-rounder, rather than a climber or a pure sprinter.

The first ROBO-ONE contest was held in Japan in 2002 and consisted of an initial judged autonomous \\"Demonstration\\" stage, followed by one-on-one matches. In Japan, ROBO-ONE has spawned a whole series of related competitions including ROBO-ONE J, ROBO-ONE Special, ROBO-ONE Grand Prix, and the ROBO-ONE Technical Conference events. ROBO-ONE type contests have been held in several other countries including South Korea (official) and the United States (unofficial held by Robogames). The robots are usually built with RC Servos as actuators and mounted together with sheet metal shapes. The most common frame material is aluminum. However, there have been entries constructed with steel, plastic, and even wood. Different sensors are used by the robot for balance and to perceive its surroundings. A small onboard micro controller or equivalent is used to control the robots movements and if the robot is autonomous it is also programmed to adjust the robots behavior in response to sensor inputs. There have been fifteen competitions in Japan. ROBO-ONE 13 was held on March 22 and 23, at Korakuen Hall\\" in Takamatsu.http://www.robo- one.com/news/news.php?newsDate=200802#20080210 ROBO-ONE 14 occurred on October 11‚Äì12, 2008.

The 36th ROBO-ONE took place on Sunday, February 9, 2020, at Miraikan Hall, Tokyo.https://www.robo-one.com/en/roboones/index/46 ROBO-ONE Events * ROBO-ONE: The primary ROBO-ONE competitions take place twice a year, with the odd numbered competitions scheduled in the Tokyo area and the even numbered competitions staged in more remote locations to increase visibility and encourage participation in the sport. The first day begins with pre-screening tests that insure the entries are capable of taking a number of steps (10 steps within 10 seconds), and rising from both a supine and prone positions. This is followed by a 2-minute autonomous demonstration judged by a panel of experts - typically the key members of the ROBO-ONE organizing committee. The specific details of the scoring system used have never been publicly disclosed. Only the top scoring entries win the right to return for the second days matches. The matches held on the second day are roughly based on K-1 boxing events with each robot trying to knock its opponent down, or out of the ring. * ROBO-ONE J: A 'junior' level ROBO-ONE competition that usually featured smaller robots, and gave special emphasis to family participation. As of ROBO-ONE 11 (March 2007) the ROBO-ONE J themes were combined into the primary ROBO-ONE competitions and ROBO-ONE J events were no longer staged. * ROBO-ONE Special: Annual one-day competitions featuring a set of 'special' challenges including a timed Dash, a ball toss, climbing a set of stairs, opening a door, and an obstacle course. As of August 2006 the stair climbing and door opening challenges were combined into the obstacle course portion of the competition. * ROBO-ONE Grand Prix: Each Winter eight to twelve of the top ROBO-ONE competitors participate in a series of matches held in different locations around Japan over a period of six to eight weeks. Points are awarded according to the win/loss records of each entry during the series. * ROBO-ONE Technical Conference: An annual one-day conference, typically held in Kawasaki, Japan, focused on sharing information and promoting the sport. Presentations include design lectures by the top builders as well as product and technology sessions from key manufacturers. * ROBO-ONE In The Space: A special project officially announced by the ROBO-ONE committee at ROBO-ONE 9 (March 2006) to stage ROBO- ONE competitions in low earth orbit by October 2010. * ROBO-ONE Soccer: A ROBO-ONE Soccer match was staged as a preliminary demonstration at the August 2006 ROBO-ONE Special competition, and also during the September 2006 ROBO-ONE 10 event in Nagai in Japan. The ROBO-ONE committee has scheduled the first official ROBO-ONE Soccer competition for August 2007 at the Panasonic Center facility in Tokyo. * ROBO-ONE auto: Autonomous Biped Robot Fight Tournament (Feb 25, 2017) . Specifications Early ROBO-ONE specifications were deliberately minimal to encourage as much participation as possible. As the robots' performance has improved, the specifications have been tightened to keep the focus on 'humanoid robotics'. For example, the foot/sole size in relation to the robots overall size has been incrementally decreased for recent competitions. With ROBO-ONE 11 (March 2007), the concept of weight classifications was introduced. Rules Competition rules vary based on the specific event, and have evolved over time as the robots ability has improved. The ROBO-ONE committee publishes the official rules in Japanese for each competition roughly two months in advance. ROBO-ONE type competitions in other countries typically follow the same general format and rules, but with modifications appropriate for the participants skill and ability levels. Robo-One Kits Competition level ROBO-ONE entries are typically custom designs, but have often been based in part on commercially available kits. * Robotis Bioloid * KHR-1, KHR-2 and KHR-3HV by Kondo Kagaku * Robonova-1 by Hitec * Manoi AT01 and Manoi PF01 by Kyosho See also References External links * Biggest collection of Robot Fight Videos * Official ROBO- ONE Japanese page (In Japanese) (Translated into english with google) * Official ROBO-ONE Korea page (In english) * Unofficial ROBO-ONE rules (Translated by Duncan Lowne) - covers the ROBO-ONE rules as of September 2006 * RoboSavvy ROBO-ONE Community (English) * Robots Dreams robotics blog from Japan that features ROBO-ONE reports and videos (English) * RoboGames US competition held annually in San Francisco with some ROBO-ONE type events Category:Robotics competitions Category:2002 in robotics Category:Recurring events established in 2002 Category:Robot combat competitions Category:Robot soccer competitions Category:2002 establishments in Japan Category:Robotics in Japan ","title":"Robo One"},{"id":"9809755","text":"Domkat Yah Bali (born 27 February 1940) is the Ponzhi Tarok since December, 2010.

He was notably the author of works on the Sturm und Drang phenomenon and the influence of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. During his early years, he was influenced by Expressionism and contributed to the literary magazine G√¢ndirea; he progressively moved towards support for the Iron Guard (the Legionary Movement), edited the far right journal Chemarea Vremii, and spent his last years as a member of Horia Sima's government in exile. Biography Born in Boto≈üani, S√¢n-Giorgiu was educated in Germany.Grigorescu, p.377 He debuted as a traditionalist poet, affiliated with the group originally formed around SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul magazine.Lovinescu, p.66-67, 307 According to literary historian Eugen Lovinescu, he was, with Anastasie M√¢ndru and George V√¢lsan, one of the best-known SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul poets in the Regat regions.Lovinescu, p.66-67 With time, S√¢n-Giorgiu moved towards modernist literature. In 1921, he contributed a serialized column on \\"Dramatic Expressionism\\" to AdevƒÉrul Literar ≈üi Artistic, later published as a single volume.Grigorescu, p.377-378 S√¢n- Giorgiu's views on Expressionism and modernism, like those of G√¢ndirea itself, oscillated: in early 1923, he commented negatively in regard to the tendencies of younger poets to \\"discard metaphors\\", but later authored reviews and essays welcoming the trend. At the time, S√¢n-Giorgiu notably contributed essays on the literature of Georg Kaiser and Walter Hasenclever to G√¢ndirea.Grigorescu, p.387 His 1922 play Masca (\\"The Mask\\"), which followed Expressionist guidelines,Grigorescu, p.377, 388, 424-425; Lovinescu, p.307 was among the series of avant-garde productions staged by Victor Ion Popa during the interwar period.Grigorescu, p.424-425 During the early 1930s, he seconded Victor Eftimiu inside the Romanian PEN Club (of which he was General Secretary).

Davidescu which eventually turned violent. Krikor Zambaccian, Destina≈£ii culturale. Cap≈üa, published and hosted by LiterNet; retrieved September 23, 2008 By that time, he was again discarding modernist approaches to literature, and returning to traditionalist techniques and subjects.Lovinescu, p.307 Initially, he was opposed to antisemitism, defining it as \\"an act of poverty of a failed intellectual or a cheap opportunity of self-assertion\\" and \\"a stupid ferment of anarchic agitation\\".\\"Romanian Intellectuals about the Jews\\", at the Romanian Jewish Community site; retrieved September 23, 2008 Nevertheless, he changed his position, by rallying with the leading antisemitic and fascist camp. By 1938, S√¢n-Giorgiu expressed his support for Nazism and reportedly made a habit of wearing a Nazi-inspired swastika on his clothes, while maintaining close contacts with the authoritarian King Carol II.Sebastian, p.56, 152 According to the marginalized Romanian Jewish author Mihail Sebastian, rumor had it that, in 1936, S√¢n-Giorgiu sought endorsement from Nazi Germany and competed for its attention with Nae Ionescu, a far right philosopher who had broken with Carol and supported the Iron Guard. The same account has it that S√¢n-Giorgiu and his journalist ally Pamfil ≈ûeicaru managed to undermine Ionescu's standing, by presenting Nazi officials with proof that the philosopher had dealings with the prominent Jewish banker Aristide Blank.Sebastian, p.56 S√¢n-Giorgiu was a member of the fascist and antisemitic National Christian Party (PNC), which took power when Carol appointed its leader Octavian Goga as Premier. In 1938, after the PNC fell in disfavor with the monarch, Ion S√¢n-Giorgiu rallied with the latter's National Renaissance Front, becoming its official journalist.Ornea, p.419 Goga's dismissal caught Ion S√¢n-Giorgiu on a theatrical tour of Germany.Sebastian, p.152 Sebastian, who conversed with him right after, mentions him being \\"unrecognizable\\", and records his claims that the PNC was responsible for a series of mistakes, and notes that S√¢n-Giorgiu took no apparent displeasure in talking to a Jew, being \\"friendly and communicative\\". Also according to Sebastian, S√¢n-Giorgiu claimed to have registered major successes in Germany, having stated: \\"Not even Ibsen had such a triumph; not one unfavorable review.\\" In November 1940, after the Iron Guard established its National Legionary State government, S√¢n-Giorgiu threw his support behind the latter, while expressing his new thoughts on the Romanian Jewish community and racial policies in a column for Chemarea Vremii: > \\"Legionary Romania has solved the Jewish Question. That which the Oct. Goga- > presided government has only attempted, the Legion has managed to achieve in > less than three months. The Jews have been removed not just from the state > apparatus, but also from the industry [and] commerce, where cooperative and > neat Legionary organizations are striving and succeeding in taking their > place. [...] We have a duty to pose overtly and without delay the problem of > liquidating this miserable ghetto that is currently forming itself. It is > time to ask: What do we do with them? Because to leave them free to multiply > like rabbits, to consume our goods, to hate us and produce nothing in > return, that cannot be. In Legionary Romania there is no room for drones. > [...] It would serve Jews to know that we are not the passive bearers of a > social rot, but the national surgeons of a national cancer. Hence I ask our > own: what do we do with them? And I ask the Jews to reply honestly: what do > you do?\\"S√¢n-Giorgiu, in Ornea, p.419 During the same year, S√¢n-Giorgiu's newspaper published influential essays by Mihail Manoilescu, who advocated corporatism and called for its implementation in the National Legionary State.Ornea, p.282-283 Having survived the violent clash between the Iron Guard and their nominal partner, ConducƒÉtor Ion Antonescu (events known as the Legionary Rebellion), he left Romania after Antonescu's regime and Romania's alliance to the Axis Powers crumbled in autumn 1944 (see Soviet occupation of Romania). William Totok, \\"Cultura romaneascƒÉ √Æn Germania. Jurnalul lui Mihail Sebastian tradus √Æn limba germanƒÉ\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 796, June 2005 He joined Sima's Vienna-based Legionary cabinet, holding a nominal office as Minister of Education. The justice system in Communist Romania tried him in absentia, and sentenced him to death. Iulia Popovici, \\"VintilƒÉ Corbul √Ænapoi acasƒÉ\\", in Ziua, February 4, 2008 The writer died in exile. S√¢n-Giorgiu's daughter, Ioana, stayed behind in Romania. She later married VintilƒÉ Corbul, a genre fiction author, screenwriter and former lawyer, who had faced political persecution in the 1950s. Ioana S√¢n-Giorgiu died of cancer in 1969; ten years later, Corbul defected and restarted his writing career in France (where he died in 2008). Work S√¢n-Giorgiu's early SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist works, influenced by Panait Cerna and Mihai Eminescu, were thought by Lovinescu to be \\"lacking in originality\\".Lovinescu, p.67 As he gradually moved towards modernism, Lovinescu notes, the poet displayed \\"abuse of imagery\\", \\"the perkiness of free forms\\", \\"egocentrism\\" and \\"tumultuous sensualism.\\" The earliest of his plays were characterized by Lovinescu as \\"Expressionist travesties, which do away with observation and even with talent, being content with ideas and theories\\". Masca showed the interactions between three amorous couples, all of whom are masked. One of the pairs, a female billionaire and her male artist lover, find themselves on the verge of an existential crisis as their masks are removed, and is on the verge of splitting up. According to Lovinescu: \\"It's fortunate that the author-theorist would intervene to put [their masks] up again, thus enabling them to go on lying to one another.\\" In the 1925 drama Femeia cu douƒÉ suflete (\\"The Woman with Two Souls\\"), Expressionism is toned down, but still present, particularly in the author's refusal to specify the setting and the characters' background‚Äîin reference to this aspect, Lovinescu writes: \\"Nothing [in it] is [...] seen, individualized, localized; everything is reduced to a possible subject.\\" The plot deals with a forceful m√©nage √† trois situation: the female singer Mona, obsessively loved by the sculptor Dionis, accepts the advances of Fink, a theater manager, and, overwhelmed by shame, decides to kill herself. By 1926, having discarded Expressionism and returned to a traditional style, S√¢n-Giorgiu wrote a series of satirical plays, among which was Banchetul (\\"The Banquet\\"). Lovinescu notes that they owed inspiration to 19th century author Ion Luca Caragiale.

It was first published in 1839 in Burton's Gentleman's Magazine. The story follows an unnamed narrator who seeks out the famous war hero John A. B. C. Smith. He becomes suspicious that Smith has some deep secret when others refuse to describe him, instead remarking only on the latest advancements in technology. When he finally meets Smith, the man must first be assembled piece by piece. It is likely that in this satire Poe is actually referring to General Winfield Scott, veteran of the War of 1812, the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and the American Civil War. Additionally, some scholars suggest that Poe is questioning the strong male identity as well as how humanity falls as machines become more advanced. Plot summary An unnamed narrator meets the famous Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith, \\"one of the most remarkable men of the age\\" and a hero of \\"the late tremendous swamp-fight, away down South, with the Bugaboo and Kickapoo Indians.\\" Smith is an impressive physical specimen at six feet tall with flowing black hair, \\"large and lustrous\\" eyes, powerful-looking shoulders, and other essentially perfect attributes. He is also known for his great speaking ability, often boasting of his triumphs and about the advancements of the age. The narrator wants to learn more about this heroic man. He finds that people do not seem to want to speak about the General when asked, only commenting on achievements of the \\"wonderfully inventive age\\" and how \\"horrid\\" the Native Americans whom the General had fought against had been. The narrator begins to believe there is some concealed secret he must uncover. When he visits the General's home, he sees nothing but a strange bundle of items on the floor. The bundle, however, begins to speak. It is the General himself, and his servant begins to \\"assemble\\" him, piece by piece. Limbs are screwed on, a wig, glass eye and false teeth, and a tongue, until the man himself stands \\"whole\\". The General has lost more than battles, it seems: he was captured and severely mutilated by Native American warriors and now much of his body is composed of prostheses, which must be put in or on every morning and without which he cannot appear in public. The narrator now understands the General's secret ‚Äî he \\"was the man that was used up.\\" Publication history The Prose Romances of Edgar A. Poe, No. I, William H. Graham, Philadelphia, 1843.

Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 148. Scott was actually a close relative of the second wife of Poe's foster father John Allan. Scott had been injured in the Seminole and Creek Indian removal campaigns and would later run for President of the United States as a Whig candidate.Meyers, Jeffrey. Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992: 111. Scott also served in the Black Hawk War, in which a number of Kickapoo Indians participated. At the time Poe wrote the tale in 1839, Scott was already considered a possible Whig candidate for the presidency, though he would lose the election in 1852.Hoffman, Daniel. Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1972: 193. Alternatively, it has been suggested that Poe may have been referring to Richard Mentor Johnson, Vice President of the United States under Martin Van Buren.Mooney, Stephen L. \\"The Comic in Poe's Fiction\\" in On Poe: The Best from \\"American Literature\\". Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1993: 137. According to scholar Leland S. Person, Poe is using the story as a critique of male military identity, which he knew well from his own military career and his studies at the United States Military Academy at West Point. It is a literal deconstruction of the identity of a military model of manhood that was given status after Indian removal campaigns of the 1830s. The story seems to suggest that the war hero has nothing left but the injuries he has received in battle to make up his identity.Person, Leland S. \\"Poe and Nineteenth Century Gender Constructions\\" as collected in A Historical Guide to Edgar Allan Poe, J. Gerald Kennedy, ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001: 157. According to Shawn James Rosenheim, Poe also is questioning technology, suggesting that it will soon be difficult to distinguish man from machine.Rosenheim, Shawn James. The Cryptographic Imagination: Secret Writing from Edgar Poe to the Internet. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997: 101. The story also has minor critiques of racism; the war hero was taken apart by Indians but is put together by his \\"old negro valet\\" named Pompey (a name Poe also uses in \\"A Predicament\\"), arguably undermining the power of white male dominance. Poe may also have been reacting to the popular \\"subversive\\" humor of the day, exaggerating the technique to the point of being inane.Reynolds, David S. Beneath the American Renaissance: The Subversive Imagination in the Age of Emerson and Melville. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1988: 527. The opening epigraph to the story is from Le Cid by Pierre Corneille and translates to: :\\"Weep, weep, my eyes and float yourself in tears! :The better half of my life has laid the other to rest.\\" The story bears a resemblance to \\"A Beautiful Young Nymph Going to Bed\\", a satiric poem by Jonathan Swift from 1731. Both works depict grotesquely artificial bodies: Swift's poem features a young woman preparing for bed by deconstructing, while Poe's story features an old man reconstructing himself to begin his day.

History Like most college radio stations, WTMD has its origins in a network of closed-circuit carrier current transmitters inaugurated in spring 1972. Although carrier current stations are not licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the operation adopted the unofficial call sign WVTS (\\"Voice of Towson State\\") as a familiar form of identification. Efforts immediately began to build out an FM station, although it was hampered by a lack of available frequencies as other educational broadcasters built their stations first. A plan to partner with Morgan State University to launch a shared station (later to become WEAA) fell through. A 1973 letter to The Towerlight was reflective of the overall mood surrounding the station, bemoaning the fact that the largest mass communications program in the state had only a carrier current station ‚Äì which the author described as a \\"sophisticated intercom\\" ‚Äì for training. Concerns also abounded about poor news and events coverage, and a lack of professionalism on the part of airstaff. In 1974, the FCC granted Towson State permission to build on 89.7 MHz. This station was assigned the callsign WCVT (\\"Communications Voice of Towson\\"), and signed on February 12, 1976 with a typical college radio format of primarily progressive rock and a variety of specialty shows. The carrier current station was also renamed WCVT and became a training ground for the FM station, greatly improving its on-air quality. WCVT's eclectic music found a small but loyal audience. The station was recognized by the Baltimore City Paper in 1988 as the city's best. WCVT upgraded to 10,000 watts in 1981. Towson State began directly funding the station in 1988 with the intention of hiring professional management, which it did in the same year. In 1991, faced with an audience that was unsustainably small for its funding needs, WCVT flipped to smooth jazz and light adult contemporary \\"89.7 The Breeze\\", changing callsigns to WTMD. Despite the apparent meaning of \\"Towson, Maryland\\", the call letters are an initialism for \\"Where Towson Makes a Difference\\". Students protested the loss of their musical outlet, arguing that since they were still a major funding source it should play what they wanted. General manager Jim English put it bluntly to the Baltimore Sun: \\"Nobody's listening.\\" Management contended that the station's primary goal was to teach broadcasting, not entertain students, and it needed to switch to a more accessible format to resolve persistent revenue shortfalls. Full-service NPR member station WJHU (88.1 FM) had four times the audience with a comparable signal. After eleven years of what Sun media reporter David Folkenflik derisively referred to as \\"low-calorie\\" elevator music, WTMD flipped to adult album alternative (AAA) ‚Äì a mix of indie rock, rock, folk and alternative country ‚Äì on December 3, 2002. Station management indicated they were impressed by the success of stations such as WXPN and KCRW, and sought a musical format not otherwise accessible in Baltimore; at the time, WEAA, WJHU, and Washington's WPFW also devoted at least part of their broadcast days to jazz. The AAA format has achieved a similar level of success, and WTMD has developed a reputation as a strong supporter of the local music scene. WTMD concurrently moved from faculty oversight in the Department of Electronic Media and Film to direct management by the university's communications department. The station currently has an all- professional office and air staff, although Towson students are hired as interns and have worked their way into on-air positions. The carrier current network became known as WTSR (\\"Towson State Radio\\") in 1981, and gradually became more eclectic after the FM station dropped progressive rock. It was shut down in 2004; WTSR moved online and still exists today as XTSR. =First Thursday Concerts in the Park= WTMD produces First Thursday Concerts in the Park, a series of six free after work shows at West Mount Vernon Park in downtown Baltimore, and starting in 2014, Canton Waterfront Park.Case, Wesley (2014, April 03) Higher-profile acts on tap as WTMD's First Thursdays moves.

This brought back independent music radio to Washington for the first time since WHFS dropped its alternative rock format in 2005. In fact, this partnership was recognized and praised by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner McDowell in his remarks when the Commission voted to make HD multicasting permanent. WTMD was simulcast full-time on WAMU- HD2 until September 2007, when WAMU removed all music programming from its primary signal and flipped the HD2 subchannel to Americana and bluegrass- formatted \\"Bluegrass Country\\". The simulcast moved to overnights and weekends on WAMU-HD3; in 2010, the WTMD-programmed blocks were flipped to content from XPoNential Radio. WTMD also broadcast on FM translator W288BS, located in the Washington suburb of Great Falls, Virginia on 105.5 FM. This translator was fed by WAMU's HD signal and began relaying Bluegrass Country in October 2008.

A majority of the Oglala live on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, the eighth- largest Native American reservation in the United States. The Oglala are a federally recognized tribe whose official title is the Oglala Sioux Tribe (previously called the Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota). However, many Oglala reject the term \\"Sioux\\" due to the hypothesis (among other possible theories) that its origin may be a derogatory word meaning \\"snake\\" in the language of the Ojibwe, who were among the historical enemies of the Lakota. They are also known as Oglala Lakota. History Oglala elders relate stories about the origin of the name \\"Oglala\\" and their emergence as a distinct group, probably sometime in the 18th century. =Conflict with the European settlers= In the early 1800s, Europeans passed through Lakota territory in greater and greater numbers. They sought furs, especially beaver fur at first, and later buffalo fur. The trade in fur changed the Oglala economy and way of life. 1868 brought the Fort Laramie Treaty, and in its wake the Oglala became increasingly polarized over this question: How should they react to continued American encroachment on their territory? This treaty forfeited large amounts of Oglala to the United States in exchange for food and other necessities. Some bands turned to the Indian agencies‚Äîforerunners to the Indian reservations‚Äîwhere they received beef and other rations from the US government. Other bands held fast to traditional ways of life. Many bands moved between these two extremes, coming in to the agencies during the winter and joining their relatives in the north each spring. These challenges further split the various Oglala bands. =Early reservation= The Great Sioux Reservation was broken up into five portions. This caused the Red Cloud Agency to be moved multiple times throughout the 1870s until it was relocated and renamed the Pine Ridge Reservation in 1878. By 1890, the reservation included 5,537 people, divided into a number of districts that included some 30 distinct communities. Social organization Kevin Pourier, an Oglala Lakota jeweler and sculptor whose medium is buffalo horn The Wake Singers, band of Oglala Lakota musicians The respected Oglala elder Left Heron once explained that before the coming of the White Buffalo Calf Woman, \\"the people ran around the prairie like so many wild animals,\\" not understanding the central importance of community. Left Heron emphasized that not only did this revered spirit woman bring the Sacred Pipe to the tribe but she also taught the Lakota people many valuable lessons, including the importance of family (tiwahe) and community (tiyospaye). The goal of promoting these two values then became a priority, and in the words of Dakota anthropologist Ella Cara Deloria, \\"every other consideration was secondary ‚Äî property, personal ambition, glory, good times, life itself. Without that aim and the constant struggle to attain it, the people would no longer be Dakotas in truth. They would no longer even be human.\\" This strong and enduring connection between related families profoundly influenced Oglala history. =Community (Tiyospaye)= Dr. John J. Saville, the U.S. Indian agent at the Red Cloud Agency, observed in 1875 that the Oglala tribe was divided into three main groups: the Kiyuksa, the Oyuƒ•pe and the True Oglala. \\"Each of these bands are subdivided into smaller parties, variously named, usually designated by the name of their chief or leader.\\" Dr. Saville also listed a fourth band, the Wajaje, in his report, but while they were closely associated with the Oglala at that time, they were in fact Brul√©. As the Oglala were settled on the Pine Ridge Reservation in the late 1870s, their communities probably looked something like this: Oyu»üpe Tiyo≈°paye *True Oyu»üpe (Big Road's band). Other members include: Black Elk *Waka≈ã *Makaicu (Red Dog's band) Oglala Tiyo≈õpaye *True Oglala *Ca≈ãkahu»üa≈ã (He Dog's band). Other members include: Short Bull; Amos Bad Heart Bull. *Hokayuta (Black Twin's band) *Hu≈ãkpatila (Little Hawk and Crazy Horse's band) *It√© ≈°√≠ƒçA (Red Cloud's band) *Payabya (Young Man Afraid of His Horses's band) *Waglu»üe (Chief Blue Horse, American Horse and Three Bear's band) Kiyaksa Tiyo≈°paye *True Kiyaksa *Kuinyan (Little Wound's band) *Tapi≈°leca (Yellow Bear's band) =Population= By 1830, the Oglala had around 3,000 members. In the 1820s and 1830s, the Oglala, along with the Brul√©, another Lakota band, and three other Sioux bands, formed the Sioux Alliance. This Alliance attacked surrounding tribes for territorial and hunting reasons. Culture =Gender roles= Historically, women have been critical to the family's life: making almost everything used by the family and tribe. They have cultivated and processed a variety of crops; prepared the food; prepared game and fish; worked skins to make clothing and footwear, as well as storage bags, the covering of tipis, and other items. Women have historically controlled the food, resources and movable property, as well as owned the family's home. Typically, in the Oglala Lakota society, the men are in charge of the politics of the tribe. The men are usually the chiefs for political affairs, war leaders and warriors, and hunters. Traditionally, when a man marries, he goes to live with his wife with her people. Oglala flag Oglala flag in use since 1961 First used in 1961, this flag was approved by the Oglala Sioux Tribal OST Council on March 9, 1962, as the flag of the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST). The circle of nine tipi on the flag represent the nine districts of the reservation: Porcupine, Wakpamni, Medicine Root, Pass Creek, Eagle Nest, White Clay, LaCreek, Wounded Knee, and Pine Ridge. The red field represents the blood shed by the tribe in defense of their lands and an allegorical reference to the term \\"red man,\\" by which they were referred to by European Americans. The blue represents the sky, as seen in all four cardinal directions during the worship of the Great Spirit, and the elements. It also represents the Lakota spiritual concept of heaven or \\"the Spirit World\\" to which departed tribal members go.Oglala Sioux Tribe, Official Website The flag pictured is the original not the current OST Flag.

In the 1940s and 1950s he played and arranged music for the Joe Andy Orchestra, which toured the Netherlands, West Germany and Switzerland with considerable success. From 1957 onwards he worked in various capacities for Dutch television. In 1962, he was asked by TV host and singer Rudi Carrell to accompany his shows with a big orchestra. In the years after, de Kok wrote the arrangements for Carrell's shows and many more TV programmes. Moreover, he worked with a couple of famous Dutch artists in the recording studio, amongst others Boudewijn de Groot. In 1969 he stepped in for Dolf van der Linden who refused to travel to Francoist Spain (saying it would remind him too much of his experiences during World War II) to conduct the orchestra for the Dutch entry in the Eurovision Song Contest.

L√©on was ranked as one of the top aviators in the world. On 30 December 1909 he had broken all speed records at Juvisy-sur-Orge in France in an attempt to win the Michelin Cup.The New York Press, 5 January 1910, front page - Delagrange‚Äôs skull crushed by fall of monoplane flying in a gutsy wind He did not succeed in beating Henry Farman‚Äôs record for distance, but did establish a new distance record for monoplanes and a new world speed record. He covered 124 miles in 2 hours and 32 minutes, maintaining an average speed of approximately 45 miles an hour. Biography L√©on Delagrange was born in Orl√©ans in central France, the son of a textile factory owner. As a teenager he studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts under Louis Barrias and Charles Vital-Cornu and was represented at several exhibitions in Paris. He was a member of the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais and received a commendation in 1901.Benezit Dictionary of Artists Delagrange was one of the first men in Europe to take up aviation. In 1907 he became interested in flying and became a pioneer of powered flight. That same year he was one of the first people to order an aircraft from Gabriel Voisin of the Voisin brothers, enabling them to get established as manufacturers of airplanes. The aircraft was the first example of what was to become one of the most successful early French aircraft, the Voisin 1907 biplane. His first public flight was made on 16 March 1907 at Bagatelle in France where he flew a biplane. His feats soon attracted worldwide attention and he is said to have refused a guarantee of $10,000 if he would visit the United States to perform demonstrations. In 1907, Delagrange was elected president of the Aviation Club of France. During 1908 Delagrange toured Italy where he made flight demonstrations. It was during one of these demonstrations on 8 July that he made the world's first flight with a lady passenger, his partner and fellow sculptor Th√©r√®se Peltier. In September the same year Delagrange set distance and endurance records, establishing a record of 15.2 miles in 29 minutes, 53 seconds.\\"Progress of Mechanical Flight\\": Flight Issue 1 , 2 January 1909 p.12: https://archive.org/stream/Flight_International_Magazine_1909-01-02-pdf#page/n9. Retrieved 20 July 2018. On 7 January 1909, he was awarded one of the first eight aviators certificates awarded by the A√©ro-Club de France. In 1909 he also received the Lagatiner prize at Juvisy (3.6 miles in 10 minutes, 18 seconds). He participated in the world's first air race at Port-Aviation on 23 May 1909, and a further couple of race meetings during that same year. In addition to his original Voisins airplane he also bought three Bl√©riot XIs, and formed a team by recruiting Hubert Le Blon, L√©on Molon and Georges Pr√©voteau. He also flew in several non-competitive meetings. He was the first to equip a Bl√©riot XI with a 50 hp Gn√¥me engine in place of the 25 hp Anzani, thereby doubling its power.

He set a world record by flying a Bleriot Monoplane six miles in 7 minutes 36 seconds, which is more than 50 miles an hour. The fact that he flew in a storm created a sensation for the fans and the press. Tuesday, 26 October 1909, Yorkshire Post: \\"Delagrange then tried for the Tradesmen's Cup for the fastest circuit, and on his Gnome-engine Bleriot completed one lap, during a flight of 5 miles 1,695 yards, in 1 min. 47.2 seconds and as this worked out at a speed of 49.9 miles an hour, this was announced as a world's record.\\"Yorkshire Post, news - 1909 Doncaster Aviation meeting: http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/community/nostalgia/magnificent- men-and-flying-machines-1-6842997#axzz3qXHCrf8q Pilots flying during the Doncaster Aviation Meeting were: Hubert Le Blon, Samuel Cody, Leon Delagrange, Maurice Gifford, Ballin Hinde, Frank Lovelace?, Edward M.

Death The French aviator was killed when his aircraft crashed on 4 January 1910 in Bordeaux. His death made front-page news worldwide: Quote from The New York Press, 5 January 1910, front page:Delagrange‚Äôs skull crushed by fall of monoplane flying in a gusty wind. \\"L√©on Delagrange, the noted French aeronaut, was killed while making a flight here today (Bordeaux, France). Delagrange fell with his machine from a height of about 65 feet and was crushed under the wreckage. He had been flying in a wind that had been gusty which frequently blew at the rate of 20 miles an hour. In spite of this disadvantage, Delagrange continued and had circled the aerodrome three times when suddenly as he was turning at high speed against the wind the left wing of the monoplane broke and the other wing collapsed. The machine toppled and plunged to the ground. Delagrange was caught under the weight of the motor, which crushed his skull. Delagrange‚Äôs flight was merely preliminary to the attempt, which he was to make in the afternoon to break Henry Farman‚Äôs record. The aviator did not have time to disengage himself from his seat.\\" The New York Press, 5 January 1910, front page - Delagrange‚Äôs skull crushed by fall of monoplane flying in a gutsy wind.Early Aviators ‚Äì Delagrange Biography Awards and commemorations He was made president of the A√©ro-Club de France in 1908 and in 1909 was decorated with the order of the Legion of Honor.

She is the founder of the Ensemble Espa√±ol Spanish Dance Theater in residence at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago, Illinois. Early life Born in Chicago to Dorothy, a concert pianist and educator, and Robert, a music educator who served as the fine arts coordinator at Kaplan Jewish Community Center, Libby Komaiko's passion for dance began at the age of nine after seeing a performance of The Nutcracker. She began her dance training with Elisa Stigler at the Chicago Musical College of Roosevelt University. At 18, after an invitation to audition for a scholarship, Komaiko earned the opportunity to train and perform with the legendary Jose Greco's Spanish Dance Company. Career Komaiko put aside her dream of being on Broadway and continued to commit herself to Spanish dance. She studied in Spain and the U.S. with Maria Alba, Nana Lorca, Lola Montes, Jos√© Greco, and Edo, as well as her partner for several years, Roberto Lorca. Teaching ballet, modern dance, and creative movement across Chicago, Komaiko became part of the Artists in Residence program at Northeastern Illinois University in 1974.

It presents over one hundred Spanish dance educational programs a year, reaching nearly 20,000 students in arts education programming, and has performed hundreds of concerts worldwide. Komaiko contributed flamenco, ballet, folkloric and classical choreography to over 60 of the company‚Äôs 125 original works and collaborated with founding members of the National Ballet of Spain, Juan Mata and Ana Gonzales, as well as other Spanish dancers Paco Alonso, Manolete, and Juanjo Linares.
