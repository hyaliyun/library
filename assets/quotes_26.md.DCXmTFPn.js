It is present in most psychedelic mushrooms together with its phosphorylated counterpart psilocybin. Psilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The mind-altering effects of psilocin are highly variable, subjective and resemble those of LSD and DMT.  Chemistry  Psilocin and its phosphorylated cousin, psilocybin, were first isolated and named in 1958 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann. Hofmann obtained the chemicals from laboratory-grown specimens of the entheogenic mushroom Psilocybe mexicana. Hofmann also succeeded in finding the synthetic routes to these chemicals. Psilocin can be obtained by dephosphorylation of natural psilocybin under strongly acidic or under alkaline conditions (hydrolysis). Another synthetic route uses the Speeter-Anthony tryptamine synthesis starting from 4-hydroxyindole. Psilocin is relatively unstable in solution due to its phenolic hydroxy (-OH) group. In the presence of oxygen it readily forms bluish and dark black degradation products. Similar products are also formed under acidic conditions in the presence of oxygen and Fe3+ ions (Keller's reagent). = Structural analogs = Sulfur analogs are known with a benzothienyl replacement as well as 4-SH-DMT.A Hofmann, F Troxler, Swiss 421,960 (1967); CA 68:95680n 1-Methylpsilocin is a functionally 5-HT2C receptor preferring agonist. 4-Fluoro-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is known. O-Acetylpsilocin (4-AcO-DMT) is an acetylated analog of psilocin. Additionally, replacement of a methyl group at the dimethylated nitrogen with an isopropyl or ethyl group yields 4-HO-MIPT (4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N- isopropyltryptamine) and 4-HO-MET (4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine), respectively.  Pharmacology  Psilocin is the pharmacologically active agent in the body after ingestion of psilocybin or some species of psychedelic mushrooms. Psilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated in the body to psilocin which acts as a 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A agonist or partial agonist. Psilocin exhibits functional selectivity in that it activates phospholipase A2 instead of activating phospholipase C as the endogenous ligand serotonin does. Psilocin is structurally similar to serotonin (5-HT), differing only by the hydroxyl group being on the 4-position rather than the 5 and the dimethyl groups on the nitrogen. Its effects are thought to come from its agonist activity at 5-HT2A serotonin receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Psilocin has no significant effect on dopamine receptors (unlike LSD) and only affects the noradrenergic system at very high dosages. Psilocin's half-life ranges from 1 to 3 hours. : See psilocybin for more details  Behavioral and non-behavioral effects  Dried psilocybin mushrooms. (Notice the characteristic blue bruising by the stems of the mushrooms.) Its physiological effects are similar to a sympathetic arousal state. Specific effects observed after ingestion can include but are not limited to tachycardia, dilated pupils, restlessness or arousal, euphoria, open and closed eye visuals (common at medium to high doses), synesthesia (e.g. hearing colours and seeing sounds), increased body temperature, headache, sweating and chills, and nausea. Psilocin acts as a 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A agonist or partial agonist. Receptors are claimed to significantly regulate visuals, decision making, mood, decreased blood pressure and heart rate. There is virtually no direct lethality associated with psilocin. There is virtually no withdrawal syndrome when chronic use of this drug is ceased. There is cross tolerance among psilocin, mescaline, LSD, and other 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT1A agonists due to down-regulation of these receptors. Legal status The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) requires its members to prohibit psilocybin, and parties to the treaty are required to restrict use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions. =Australia= Psilocin is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015).Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534 A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. =Russia= Psilocin and psilocybin are banned in Russia as narcotic drugs with a criminal penalty for possession of at least 50 mg.

Military career  Son of Samuel Graves, he was thought to have been born in Northern Ireland where his grandfather, Captain James Graves (1654‚Äì1689), who married a daughter of Sir John Herdman of Stannington, lived, before he was robbed of his regiment's wages and murdered in his bed. Graves joined the Royal Navy in 1732.Samuel Graves at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Made lieutenant in 1739, he participated in the 1741 expedition against Cartagena, serving on the frigate Norfolk, under his uncle and future admiral, Captain Thomas Graves. Samuel Graves's cousin Thomas, Captain Graves's son and also future admiral, served alongside him on the third-rate ship-of-the-line Norfolk. Promoted to command of the sloop Bonetta in 1743, Graves served in the West Indies until 1747, commanding Ripon's Prize, and, later, Enterprise. = Seven Years' War = In 1756 Graves rose to command Duke. Two years later, Graves returned to the command of Duke, serving again under Hawke in the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. He continued in command of Duke until his promotion to rear admiral in October 1762. = American Revolutionary War = In October 1770 Graves rose to vice admiral, and in July 1774 assumed command of the North American Station. Graves's orders were vague, his resources overstretched, and his task, in the words of the Dictionary of National Biography, \\"perhaps the most ungracious duty that has ever fallen to the lot of a naval officer.\\" According to his instructions, Graves was charged with supporting customs officials enforcing the various revenue and trade acts governing North American colonial trade within the empire, especially the Boston Port Act. With only 26 ships and over one-thousand miles of coastline from Nova Scotia to Florida to patrol, Graves's task was Sisyphean. Manning problems made the Royal Navy's problems even more acute, thus forcing it to resort to press gangs in order to supplement the ships' slender crews. Compounding the problem was the attitude and behavior of navy officers who did not recognize local authority and were more often contemptuous of local officials and sensitivities. Headquartered in Boston, Graves was at the center of the Revolutionary turmoil in New England. His sailors manned the boats that ferried British soldiers across the Charles River en route to Concord on the night of 18 April 1775. Two months later, on 17 June 1775, his sailors again helped ferry troops, this time to the Charlestown Peninsula, while several of his ships provided fire support for the pyrrhic victory at Bunker Hill. During the Siege of Boston, Admiral Graves, on 6 October 1775, ordered Lieutenant Henry Mowatt, commanding the armed vessel , to destroy seaports that were supporting the rebellion. Mowatt burned Falmouth (today‚Äôs Portland, Maine) on 18 October.Miller, p. 48 On 27 January 1776, Vice Admiral Richard Howe succeeded Graves as commander-in-chief of the North American station. Graves returned to England without a command. In September 1777 he declined command of Plymouth, but indicated a desire to return to active duty. Graves advanced to admiral of the blue on 29 January 1778, admiral of the white on 8 April 1782, and died at his estate at Hembury Fort, Honiton, Devon on 8 March 1787. A monument sculpted by John Bacon but designed by a \\"Miss Burgess\\"Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660‚Äì1851 by Rupert Gunnis was erected in Buckerell in Devon in the same year.  Family  He married Elizabeth Sedgwick, daughter of John Sedgwick of Staindrop (County Durham). After Elizabeth's death in 1767 he married again in 1769, his second wife being Margaret Spinkes, daughter of Elmes Spinkes of Aldwincle in Northamptonshire, and aunt and adopted mother of Elizabeth Simcoe. He had no children, just his ward, Elizabeth Simcoe, who married his godson John Graves Simcoe, who later became first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. He was the uncle of Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Graves, KB, who was a first cousin of Admiral Lord Thomas Graves.

Grant on December 17, 1862, during the Vicksburg Campaign, that took place during the American Civil War. The order expelled all Jews from Grant's military district, comprising areas of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky. Grant issued the order in an effort to reduce Union military corruption, and stop an illicit trade of Southern cotton, which Grant thought was being run \\"mostly by Jews and other unprincipled traders.\\" In the war zone, authorized by the Lincoln administration, the United States licensed traders through the Army, which created a market for unlicensed ones. Union military commanders in the South were responsible for administering the trade licenses and trying to control the black market in Southern cotton, as well as for conducting the war. At Holly Springs, Mississippi, Grant's Union Army supply depot, Jews were rounded up and forced to leave the city by foot. On December 20, 1862, three days after Grant's order, Confederate Major General Earl Van Dorn's Confederate Army raided Holly Springs, preventing the potential expulsion of many Jews. Although delayed by Van Dorn's raid, Grant's order was fully implemented at Paducah, Kentucky. Thirty Jewish families were roughly treated and expelled from the city. Jewish community leaders protested, and there was an outcry by members of Congress and the press; President Abraham Lincoln countermanded the General Order on January 4, 1863. Grant claimed during his 1868 Presidential campaign that he had issued the order without prejudice against Jews as a way to address a problem that \\"certain Jews had caused\\". Historians and Grant biographers have generally been critical of the order. Background =Military operations= General Ulysses S. Grant On November 2, 1862, Union Major General Ulysses S. Grant, launched an aggressive Civil War campaign to take the Confederate citadel of Vicksburg, Mississippi. On November 13, Grant's cavalry had advanced on and captured Holly Springs, Mississippi, and set up an advanced supply station. On December 1, Grant's cavalry continued to move South, crossed the Tallahatchie River, and captured Oxford, Mississippi. On December 8, Grant informed Henry Halleck, his commanding general, of his military convergence plan to advance on Vicksburg overland, while Union Major General William T. Sherman would advance on Vicksburg from the Mississippi River. The Confederate commander of Vicksburg was General John C. Pemberton, who was stationed at Jackson, Mississippi, that was a distance of 45 miles from Vicksburg. Grant's own Union military advance was made vulnerable to Confederate attack by a 190 mile railroad supply line. Grant's plan to capture Vicksburg by a joint-venture with Sherman's Army was thwarted by two Confederate raids. On December 10, 1862, breaking from Confederate General Braxton Bragg's Army, Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, began a series of raids that disrupted Union positions. Forrest destroyed Grant's rail and telegraphic communications, and inflicted 1,500 casualties on the Union Army. Grant's northern communications were cut off from Jackson, Tennessee to Columbus, Kentucky. On December 20, Confederate General Earl Van Dorn raided Union supply station at Holly Springs destroying \\"shops, depots, and warehouses.\\" Grant was defeated, extended into enemy territory, and forced to withdraw to Tennessee, his army foraging the land. On December 29, Sherman's assault on Vicksburg at Chickasaw Bayou, was repulsed by Pemberton. =Refugee cotton labor= While Grant prepared to attack Pemberton's Confederate army, his army was flooded by fugitive slaves considered contrabands by the federal government. In early November, Grant initiated a labor camp system where former refugee slaves would pick cotton, shipped north, to aid the Union War effort. Grant ordered Chaplain John Eaton to take charge of the contrabands. In return the black refugees would be protected by the army and the profits from the sale of cotton would be given to the black workers to \\"compensate for food, clothing, and shelter.\\" Grant believed the labor camp system would \\"make the Negro a consciously self- supporting unit...and start him on the way to self-respecting citizenship.\\" In November 1862, the first labor camp was established at Grand Junction. The Lincoln administration authorized Grant's program five days later. In December, Eaton was appointed by Grant to be superintendent of contrabands. African American common-law marriages were legalized. On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, that expanded the war, to end slavery. =Cotton, illegal trade, smuggling = While Grant's Army marched deeper into the Confederate South, enemy territory, as far as Oxford, Mississippi northern traders followed, to profiteer in the cotton trade, driven by the North's \\"consuming need\\" for the highly sought after textile, used to make Union tents. The Union naval blockade forced Southern cotton planters to find alternatives to selling their product. Extensive cotton trade continued between the North and South. Northern textile mills in New York and New England were dependent on Southern cotton, while Southern plantation owners depended on the trade with the North for their economic survival. The U.S. Government permitted limited trade, licensed by the Treasury and the U.S. Army. Corruption flourished as unlicensed traders bribed Army officers to allow them to buy Southern cotton without a permit.David S. Surdam, \\"Traders or traitors: Northern cotton trading during the Civil War,\\" Business & Economic History, Winter 1999, Vol. 28 Issue 2, pp 299‚Äì310 online Jewish traders were among those involved in the cotton trade; some merchants had been active in the cotton business for generations in the South; others were more recent immigrants to the North.Jonathon D. Sarna, When General Grant Expelled the Jews (2012), pp 5‚Äì8. Grant received contradictory information from Washington. The Treasury Department wanted to restore trade with the South, while the War Department believed profiteering from the sale of cotton aided the Confederacy and prolonged the war. Traders were allowed permits as long as the traders did not cross into Confederate held territory. Grant found this difficult to enforce, while he tried to stop cotton traders, including Jewish traders, from moving south with his army. The practice of cotton smuggling infuriated Grant. Criticism of Jewish traders spread throughout the Union Army, although non-Jewish traders involvement of illicit trade was rampant. Jewish traders were singled out and called \\"sharks\\" who fed upon soldiers. As part of his command, Grant was responsible for issuing trade licenses in the Department of Tennessee, an administrative district of the Union Army that comprised the portions of Kentucky and Tennessee west of the Tennessee River, and Union-controlled areas of northern Mississippi. Grant resented having to deal with the distraction of the cotton trade. He perceived it as having endemic corruption: the highly lucrative trade resulted in a system where \\"every colonel, captain or quartermaster ... [was] in a secret partnership with some operator in cotton.\\"See also Feldberg, M. (ed.), \\"General Grant's Infamy,\\" Blessings of Freedom: Chapters in American Jewish History (American Jewish Historical Society 2002), at p. 119. He issued a number of directives aimed at black marketeers. Issued orders against Jewish traders On November 9, 1862, Grant sent an order to Major-General Stephen A. Hurlbut: \\"Refuse all permits to come south of Jackson for the present. The Israelites especially should be kept out.\\"Bertram Korn, American Jewry and the Civil War (1951), p. 143. The following day he instructed Colonel Joseph Dana Webster: \\"Give orders to all the conductors on the [rail]road that no Jews are to be permitted to travel on the railroad southward from any point. They may go north and be encouraged in it; but they are such an intolerable nuisance that the department must be purged of them.\\" In a letter to General William Tecumseh Sherman, Grant wrote that his policy was occasioned \\"in consequence of the total disregard and evasion of orders by Jews.\\"Frederic Cople Jaher, A Scapegoat in the New Wilderness, p. 199. Harvard University Press, 1994. Explanation to War Department Grant explained his anti-Jewish policy to the War Department. Grant said that Treasury Department regulations were violated: \\"mostly by Jews and other unprincipled traders\\". In reference to Jewish traders Grant said: \\"they come in with their carpet sacks in spite of all that can be done to prevent it. The Jews seem to be a privileged class that can travel anywhere. They will land at any wood yard or landing on the river and make their way through the country. If not permitted to buy cotton themselves they will act as agents for someone else who will be at a military post with a Treasury permit to receive cotton and pay for it in Treasury notes, which the Jew will buy up at an agreed rate, paying gold.\\" Grant proposed that the federal government \\"to buy all the cotton at a fixed rate and send it to Cairo, St. Louis or some other point to be sold. Then all traders---they are a curse to the Army---might be explelled.\\" Visited by father and Mack brothers Grant and the cotton trade took on a more personal tone when his father Jesse Grant, and the Mack brothers, Jewish clothing contractors, visited Grant at his Southern base of Oxford. Jesse and Grant got along well with each other for a couple of days. Grant also treated his Jewish guests respectfully. The Mack brothers needed cotton to make Union army uniforms. Jesse Grant had been promised by Mack brothers to receive a quarter of the profits, after Jesse had gotten his son Grant to bestow permits to buy cotton, and then be shipped to New York. When Grant found out about the business agreement between Jesse and the Mack brothers, Grant was livid. Grant abruptly sent Jesse and the Mack brothers packing north on the next train. Grant may have felt betrayed to find out his own father was involved in the cotton trade that he despised. Issued General Order No. 2 At the start of December 1862, Grant focused on Jewish traders as the primary cause of smuggling. On December 5, Grant told Sherman that \\"in consequence of the total disregard and evasion of orders by the Jews my policy is to exluded them so far as practicable from the Dept.\\" Grant tightened restrictions to try to reduce the illegal trade. On December 8, 1862, he issued General Order No. 2, mandating that \\"cotton-speculators, Jews and other Vagrants having not honest means of support, except trading upon the miseries of their Country ... will leave in twenty-four hours or they will be sent to duty in the trenches.\\" As the days went by, Grant's anger mounted. Grant was not satisfied only with punishing Jewish traders, he desired to expel all Jewish people from his district. Issued General Order No. 11 (1862) John Rawlins strongly objected to issuing General Orders No. 11. On December 17, 1862, Grant was angered when he had received complaints by mail concerning Jewish traders in his department. The same hour, Grant issued General Order No. 11, expelling \\"Jews, as a class\\" to strengthen his earlier prohibition. Jewish persons who did not obey the order were to be arrested and forcibly removed as prisoners. John Rawlins, Grant's lawyer and Asst. Adjt. Gen., strongly warned Grant not to issue the order. Grant refused to take Rawlin's advice concerning the order and told him: \\"Well, they can countermand this from Washington if they like, but we will issue it anyhow.\\" =General Order No. 11 text= =Letter to Wolcott= In a letter of the same date sent to Christopher Wolcott, the United States Assistant Secretary of War, Grant explained his reasoning: Implementation  Confederate Major General Earl Van Dorn Van Dorn's December 20, 1862 raid on Holly Springs, Grant's Union supply depot, spared many Jewish people, from potentially being expelled from Grant's military district. Immediately after the order was issued, Jews at Holly Springs, Grant's supply depot, were rounded up and forcibly removed. Some Jewish traders were forced to evacuate the area forty miles on foot. Seventy- two hours after Grant's order was issued, Holly Springs was raided by Confederate Major General Earl Van Dorn and his army of 3,500 Confederate troops. Union communication lines were broken for weeks, that resulted in many Jews being spared from potential removal, and delayed full enforcement of Grant's order. On December 28, Grant's order went into full force. Thirty Jewish families, shell-shocked and roughly treated, were ordered to leave Paducah, Kentucky within twenty-four hours. Jewish families in Paducah were forced to collect their personal belongings, shutter their homes and shops, and board a steamer on the Ohio River. One Jewish resident of Paducah, Cesar Kaskel, a Union loyalist and president of the Paducah Union League Club, was summoned to Paducah's Provost Marshall, L.J. Waddell, and ordered by Waddell to leave the city. =Jewish resistance to the order= A group of Jewish merchants who were expelled from Paducah, Kentucky, led by Cesar J. Kaskel, sent a telegram to President Abraham Lincoln in which they condemned Grant's General Order No. 11 as \\"the grossest violation of the Constitution and our rights as good citizens under it\\". The telegram noted it would \\"place us ... as outlaws before the world. We respectfully ask your immediate attention to this enormous outrage on all law and humanity ...\\" Throughout the Union, Jewish groups protested and sent telegrams to the government in Washington, D.C. Kaskel led a delegation to Washington, D.C., arriving on January 3, 1863. In Washington, he conferred with Jewish Republican Adolphus Solomons and a Cincinnati congressman, John A. Gurley. After meeting with Gurley, he went directly to the White House. Lincoln received the delegation and studied Kaskel's copies of General Order No. 11 and the specific order expelling Kaskel from Paducah. The President told General-in-Chief Henry Wager Halleck to have Grant revoke General Order No. 11, which Halleck did in the following message: One Jewish officer, Captain Philip Trounstine, of the Ohio cavalry, stationed in Moscow, Tennessee resigned in protest and Captain John C. Kelton, the assistant Adjutant-General of the Department of Missouri, wrote to Grant to note his order included all Jews, rather than focusing on \\"certain obnoxious individuals,\\" and noted that many Jews served in the Union Army.Brooks D. Simpson, Ulysses S. Grant: Triumph Over Adversity, 1822‚Äì1865, p. 165. Houghton Mifflin Books, 2000. Grant formally rescinded the order, January 17, 1863, within three weeks after Lincoln revoked the order. =Congressional censure votes= The issue attracted significant attention in Congress and from the press. The Democrats condemned the order as part of what they saw as the US Government's systematic violation of civil liberties. The Democrats moved to censure Grant in the Republican-dominated Senate; the motion failed by a vote of 30 - 7. Illinois congressman, and Grant supporter, Elihu Washburne, narrowly defeated a motion to censure Grant in the House by 56 votes to 53 votes. Some newspapers supported Grant's action; the Washington Chronicle criticized Jews as \\"scavengers ... of commerce\\". Most, however, were strongly opposed, with the New York Times denouncing the order as \\"humiliating\\" and a \\"revival of the spirit of the medieval ages.\\" Its editorial column called for the \\"utter reprobation\\" of Grant's order.Robert Michael, A Concise History Of American Antisemitism, p. 91. Rowman & Littlefield, 2005. =Explanation to Grant= One of Halleck's staff officers privately explained to Grant that the problem lay with the excessive scope of the order: \\"Had the word 'pedlar' been inserted after Jew I do not suppose any exception would have been taken to the order.\\" According to Halleck, Lincoln had \\"no objection to [his] expelling traitors and Jew peddlers, which I suppose, was the object of your order; but as in terms proscribing an entire religious class, some of whom are fighting in our ranks, the President deemed it necessary to revoke it.\\" The Republican politician Elihu B. Washburne defended Grant in similar terms. Grant's subordinates expressed concern about the order. =Rabbi Wise delegation to Lincoln= On January 6, Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise of Cincinnati, leader of the Reform movement, led a delegation that met with Lincoln to express gratitude for his support. Lincoln said he was surprised that Grant had issued such a command and said, \\"to condemn a class is, to say the least, to wrong the good with the bad.\\" Lincoln said he drew no distinction between Jew and Gentile and would allow no American to be wronged because of his religious affiliation. Post-war repercussions A cartoon by Bernhard Gillam depicting Grant courting Jewish voters in 1882 by crying \\"crocodile tears\\" over the persecution of Jews in Russia. The cartoon contrasts Grant's expressions of outrage with his own earlier actions. =Repudiation of order= After the Civil War, General Order No. 11 became an issue in the presidential election of 1868 in which Grant stood as the Republican candidate. The Democrats raised the order as an issue, with the prominent Democrat and rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise urging fellow Jews to vote against Grant because of his alleged anti-semitism. Grant sought to distance himself from the order, saying \\"I have no prejudice against sect or race, but want each individual to be judged by his own merit.\\" He repudiated the controversial order, asserting it had been drafted by a subordinate and that he had signed it without reading, in the press of warfare. In September 1868, Grant wrote in reply to Isaac N. Morris, a correspondent: The episode did not cause much long-term damage to Grant's relationship with the American Jewish community. He won the presidential election, taking the majority of the Jewish vote. =Makes amends with Jewish people= In his book When General Grant Expelled the Jews (2012) historian Jonathan Sarna maintains that as president Grant became one of the greatest friends of Jews in American history. When he was president, he appointed more Jews to office than any previous president. He condemned atrocities against Jews in Europe, putting human rights on the American diplomatic agenda.Jonathon D. Sarna, When General Grant Expelled the Jews (2012)p xi, 89, 101 In 1874, President Grant attended a dedication of the Adas Israel Congregation in Washington with all the members of his Cabinet. This was the first time an American President attended a synagogue service. Many historians have taken his action as part of his continuing effort to reconcile with the Jewish community. Grant has been estimated to have appointed more than fifty Jewish people to federal office including consuls, district attorneys, and deputy postmasters. Grant appointed Jewish citizen Simon Wolf Washington D.C. recorder of deeds. Grant appointed Jewish citizen Edward S. Salomon territorial governor of Washington, the first time an American Jew occupied a governor's seat. Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise said \\"Grant has revoked Grant's notorious order No. 11.\\" Historical views and assessments Historians have generally been critical of Grant and his General Orders No. 11. Scholars have offered unique perspectives of Grant's controversial order, at a time when the Civil War, had taken on a different nature. In 1951, historian Bertram Korn said Grant's General Order No. 11 order was part of a pattern by Grant. \\"This was not the first discriminatory order [Grant] had signed ... he was firmly convinced of the Jews' guilt and was eager to use any means of ridding himself of them.\\" In 1981, historian William S. McFeely said: \\"Grant was fed up with the cotton speculators and the greedy suppliers of goods to his armies, but rather than attack the entire voracious horde, which included an astonishing number of entrepreneurs---Among them Charles A. Dana and Roscoe Conkling, for example---Grant singled out the Jews. The ancient stereotype of the grasping trader was invoked; once again a frustrated man chose the age-old scapegoat.\\" McFeely mentioned General James H. Wilson who served under Grant. Wilson said Grant's General Order No. 11 was related to Grant's difficulties with his own father, Jesse Root Grant. Wilson recounted, \\"He [Jesse Grant] was close and greedy. He came down into Tennessee with a Jew trader that he wanted his son to help, and with whom he was going to share the profits. Grant refused to issue a permit and sent the Jew flying, prohibiting Jews from entering the line.\\" Wilson felt that Grant could not deal with the \\"lot of relatives who were always trying to use him\\" and perhaps attacked those he saw as their counterpart: opportunistic traders who were Jewish. In 2001, historian Jean Edward Smith said: \\"December 1862 was the low point of Grant's Civil War career. In addition to his own and Sherman's aborted attempts to take Vicksburg, on December 17, Grant issued an order that would stain his reputation forever. In one of the most blatant examples of state-sponsored anti-Semitism in American history, Grant expelled all members of the Jewish faith from the Department of the Tennessee.\\" In 2012, historian H.W. Brands said: \\"Grant shared the penchant for stereotyping Jews common to the age in America, and he may well have concluded that whatever loss they suffered by being treated as a group was a burden they would have to bear. If the inconvenience of this comparatively small class was the price of winning the war, he was willing to make them pay it. He demanded far more of his soldiers every day.\\" In 2016, historian Ronald C. White said: \\"Although non- Jews participated widely in illegal trading, the miitary newspaper in Corinth called Jews \\"sharks\\" feeding upon soldiers.\\" ¬∂ \\"In the midst of this growing anti-Jewish feeling, Grant issued General Orders No. 11 on December 17, 1862.\\" In 2017, historian Ron Chernow said: \\"Whatever the exact sequence of events, Grant must have felt wounded by the situtation, for he had railed at traders only to discover his father in cahoots with them. Grant's infamous order was a self-inflicted wound, issued at a moment of pique and over the objections of Rawlins. Besides pointing to the order's offensive nature, Rawlins predicted it would be countermanded by Washington.\\" In 2017, historian Charles W. Calhoun said: \\"The question dated from late 1862, when Grant had issued an order expelling \\"Jews, as a class,\\" from the area of his command in Mississippi for violating trade restrictions. The ill-advised order reflected his frustrations in trying to control illicit commerce behind the lines, and Lincoln countermanded it as soon as it came to his attention.\\" In 2018, historian Paul Kahan said: \\"Offended by the swarm of speculators and traders who profited from the war, Grant issued his infamous General Order No. 11, which included three points, the first of which commanded: \\"The Jews, as a class violating every regulation of trade established by the Treasury Department and also department orders, are hereby expelled from the Department [of the Tennessee] within twenty-four hours from the receipt of this order.\\" References Sources * * scholarly review and response by Calhoun at    External links * \\"General Grant's Infamy\\", Jewish Virtual Library * Order No. 11, Judaic Treasures of the Library of Congress: * \\"Grant, Lincoln, and General Order Number 11\\", American Presidents, December 2007 * \\"Gen.

According to the fiscal imbalance theory, the federal government achieved an important surplus by cutting its contributions towards provinces, leaving provinces with responsibilities much too expensive for their resources. The theory was further developed in the \\"Seguin Report\\", commissioned by former Parti Qu√©b√©cois (PQ) Premier of Quebec Bernard Landry, and completed under former Liberal Quebec Minister of Finance Yves S√©guin. The federal government, run by the Liberal Party of Canada until January 2006, denied that this imbalance exists, arguing, in part, that both the federal and provincial governments have access to the same major sources of revenue and that both orders of government face significant spending pressures and limited resources. However, the Conservative Party of Canada recognizes the imbalance. Following their victory in the 2006 federal election in January, they intended a solution be found during their mandate. A similar situation arose during the Great Depression in the 1920s when the new welfare state severely burdened the provinces, but the federal government continued to run surpluses. This resulted in the 1937-1941 Rowell-Sirois Commission, whose most important result was the removal of restrictions on how provinces could raise money, and the transfer of the expensive Unemployment Insurance program from the provinces to the federal government. In the past few years, the major issue of fiscal imbalance has been identified by all parties of the National Assembly of Quebec. The Parti lib√©ral du Qu√©bec (PLQ) proposes to work with the federal government to solve the problem by increasing federal transfers to Quebec. Yves S√©guin, of the PLQ, proposes transferring control of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a value-added tax, from the federal government to the Quebec government. The PQ holds that independence for Quebec will solve the imbalance, with all powers to impose taxes being once again the jurisdiction of the Quebec government. The PQ proposes to uphold efforts to convince the federal government to give money back to Quebec until then. All major federal parties but the Liberals recognize a monetary imbalance between the federal government and the provinces, and speak of plans to reduce such. The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois, a sovereigntist party at the federal level, is the strongest denouncer of the situation. Prime Minister Paul Martin and his federal Liberals prefer to speak of a fiscal \\"pressure\\" on provinces, not admitting directly to the responsibility of the Canadian government. In accepting an amendment to the Throne Speech after the 2004 federal election, the federal Liberals officially acknowledged the reality of the situation. Federal Liberals assert that it is impossible for a true fiscal imbalance to exist, as the provincial governments have access to all the same sources of revenue as the federal government. The problem is not structural, as it was in earlier years, but political. The provincial governments are unwilling to risk their popularity by raising taxes, insisting instead the extra money come from the federal government. The federal Liberals partially blame the situation on the tax cuts introduced by many of the provincial governments. The potential solution advocated by most of the provincial premiers is that the transfer payments from the federal government to the provinces be substantially increased. This has been occurring gradually as the federal government has regularly been increasing its transfer for health care spending. The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois supports Yves S√©guin's suggestion that the GST be given to the provinces. Gordon Campbell, the former premier of British Columbia, has proposed that the federal government take over from the provinces the responsibility for programs that provide pharmaceutical products to low-income people, the elderly and people with disabilities.

Initially a trio, Joplin hired Geoff Melkonian (bass/viola/vocals) and Jason Buecker (drums/percussion/vocals) to accompany him to play shows together. They simply called themselves Josh Joplin Band. In late 1995 they began pre-production on their first album together. Recorded at Furies Studios with producer Ed Burdell (Magnapop), Projector Head was released, January 6, 1996. Based on local critical success and some airplay on local radio Joplin, Buecker, and Melkonian, began touring vigorously. Starting in the south, continuing through the northeast, and beyond. Boxing Nostalgic was their self produced sophomore effort. It was released April 6, 1997 to a sold-out show at the Cotton Club The album introduced piano to their sound and Allen Broyles who played on the record would join the band that same year. The band continued touring and opening shows for Jump, Little Children, Five- eight, The Innocence Mission, Ben Harper, Nathan Sheppard, Kitty Snyder, among others. In 1998, having played the Roxy Theatre (Atlanta) opening for Shawn Mullins the Grammy-nominated songwriter of Lullaby, the band discussed making their third album with their friend and Mullins signed on as the producer hiring Anthony J. Resta to create the beats and programming for it. He would later release the album entitled, Useful Music, on his own SMG label. Shortly after its release, Jason Buecker was replaced on drums by Ani Cordero, then Eric Taylor who drummed for legendary dream pop founders, Seely (on Too Pure Records). Deeds Davis was added to play lead guitar and sing. The band was managed briefly by Nettwerk Music Group before making a slight name change to Josh Joplin Group when Artemis Records headed by legendary industry moguls Danny Goldberg and Daniel Glass. signed them to their label. They were picked up by Indigo Girls and Matthew Sweet manager, Russell Carter. The Artemis re- release would feature an alternative version of Joplin's ballad, I've Changed. It was lavishly produced by Peter Collins at Nashville's Ocean Way Recording studio, with Kenny Aronoff playing drums. A slightly more successful collaboration came when ex-Modern Lover / Talking Head, Jerry Harrison was brought on produce the opening track, Matter and Joplin's new song, Camera One, which hadn't been previously released. The album came out on January 30, 2001 to strong reviews and sold over 100,000 records in its first week. Its single, \\"Camera One,\\" was the first independent release to go number-one at Triple A radio and went to number 22 on the Billboard Top 40 chart in 2001. It won the \\"Single Of The Year\\" award by the American Association of Independent Music. Useful Music songs were featured in many of the top rated shows of the time, including Party of Five, Dawson's Creek, Northern Exposure, and Camera One was a feature of an episode of the comedy series Scrubs. Josh Joplin Group toured America, Mexico, Canada, Australia, and all of Europe. They played shows with countless bands, and artists including Travis, Old 97's, Matthew Sweet, Uncle Green, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Lifehouse, Pink, Smoke, and had finished performing a German festival in Cologne, when Green Day burned their drums on stage. The band has also appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Late Show with David Letterman, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, The Panel (Australian TV series), The Mike Bullard Show, Viva TV (Germany), MTV, VH1. In June 2002, Josh Joplin began working on demos for songwriter turned producer, Fountains of Wayne's Adam Schlesinger. Schlesinger was tapped to produce the group's sophomore Artemis release. He recorded 12 songs acoustically at Stratosphere Sound, (owned by Schlesinger and James Iha). And although the timing didn't work out for the two to work together, Josh and the group, sans Davis, did end up recording The Future That Was. with Atlanta producer, Rob Gal and engineers, John Holbrook and Rudyard Lee Cullers at Stratosphere. On this record, the musical styles were similarly varied, ranging from slow piano- and acoustic guitar-driven pop to upbeat keyboard- and electric guitar- based rock. The Future That Was received critical acclaim but it sold poorly and Artemis released dropped the band from their contract. Artemis released two singles from the album, \\"I Am Not the Only Cowboy\\" and \\"Wonder Wheel,\\" but neither one took off. In the fall of 2003, the band announced that it was breaking up and would play its final two shows in Atlanta in December of that year.

He originated many novel ideas in semantics. Among these was categorial grammar, a highly flexible framework for the analysis of natural language syntax and (indirectly) semantics that remains a major influence on work in formal linguistics. Ajdukiewicz's fields of research were model theory and the philosophy of science. Biography Ajdukiewicz was born in 1890 in Tarnopol in Galicia, which at that time, due to Partitions of Poland, was annexed by Austria-Hungary (The Austrian Partition). His father was a senior civil servant. Ajdukiewicz studied at the University of Lw√≥w, and lectured there, as well as in Warsaw and in Pozna≈Ñ. He received his PhD degree with the thesis on Kant's philosophy of space. He was Rector of the University of Pozna≈Ñ from 1948 to 1952. He was one of the founders of the journal Studia Logica in its current incarnation, editing it from 1953 to his death. Work In his early epistemological system, which he called Radical Conventionalism, Ajdukiewicz analyzed any language as a set of expressions or sentences, with inferential rules of meaning that specify the relation of one expression to another, or to external data. There are three kinds of rules: Axiomatic, Deductive, and Empirical. Following the rules, one can map all knowable sentences of a language. However, some languages' vocabularies can produce disconnected sentences, which are only partly mapped by the meaning rules. Therefore, when one uses a language, even scientific one, a conceptual apparatus, an untranslatable set of meanings, is needed too, and with it a choice of the problems to be settled. For this reason the theory is a form of conventionalism, and it is radical because even simple experiential reports are exposed to these language-wide considerations. Ajdukiewicz discarded this theory as the 1930s progressed.

This area can be envisioned as a sphere with a person and a sharp instrument at its center. Presumably, anyone within this radius is at risk of injury. To prevent injury to others, it is considered desirable to keep other people outside of the circle at all times. The practice of delimitating a blood circle is used for a number of activities involving sharp instruments, including whittling. Delimitation The circle is found by holding the blade of the cutting instrument (never the handle) in the hand used for cutting, and slowly swinging the arm in a 360¬∞ arc. The far end of the handle marks the limits of the circle. Any person or thing within this circle is considered to be at risk of being wounded by a slip of the blade.

In cases 1 and 2, the team are said to be all out, because they do not have two players available to bat. # All but one of the batsmen are out. # The batting side only has one not-out batsman who is still able to bat (the others are incapacitated through injury, illness or absence; see retirement (cricket)). # The team batting last scores the required number of runs to win. # The game runs out of time and so finishes as a draw. # The set number of overs (sets of deliveries) have been bowled (in limited overs cricket). # The team's captain declares the innings closed. # The Match Referee decides that one team has forfeited the game. Law 13 covers the end of the innings. Taking wickets When the bowling team has dismissed all but one of the batsmen the innings is said to be over. The batting team is said to be 'all out' or 'bowled out'. For example, in most games, each side has 11 players, so 10 wickets need to be taken to bowl a side out. There is an exception to this rule if one or more batsmen are injured and/or ill and are unable to bat. In such cases, when only one batsman remains not out and capable of batting, the innings is over. Overs bowled In some games, each team is allocated a set number of overs and its innings is closed once they have been bowled (subject to the innings not ending by another method beforehand). A restriction can be imposed in a one-innings game, or in the first innings of a two innings game. Where such a restriction is imposed in a one-innings game, it is said to be a limited overs match. An example of this is an ODI match, where each team can bat for only 50 consecutive overs. Once the 50 overs are up, and the team has not been bowled out, the innings is closed. If rain intervenes so that all the allocated overs cannot be bowled in the time available for the game, the overs restriction may be modified so that the game may be completed in the time that remains. Declaration If the captain of the batting team feels that his team has amassed a sufficiently large score, he, or the batsmen at the crease deputising for him, may end his team's innings voluntarily by declaring. This option does not apply to limited overs matches. Declarations allow the declaring side to use all the remaining time to attempt to gain the wickets necessary for victory. The strategic consideration is to gamble a certain draw for a possible victory, while risking defeat if the target is achieved by the incoming batting side. {SeeDeclaration and forfeiture} Achieving the target If the initial batting team has set a target -and the team which bats last manages to achieve the target, the innings is ended with a win for the team chasing. In rain-affected matches in which the Duckworth-Lewis method applies, the target to be reached may be less than the actual target set by the first batting side. Forfeiture In the event of the match being disrupted by unruly fans of the host team, the Match Referee may cede the match to the visiting team, if they are in a vantage position.

The town sits on the left bank of the Marne at the extremity of the Cubry valley which crosses it. √âpernay is a sub-prefecture of the department and seat of an arrondissement. History √âpernay () belonged to the archbishops of Reims from the 5th until the 10th century, when it came into the possession of the counts of Champagne. It was badly damaged during the Hundred Years' War, and was burned by Francis I in 1544. It resisted Henry of Navarre in 1592, and Marshal Biron fell in the attack which preceded its eventual capture. In 1642 it was, along with Ch√¢teau-Thierry, named as a duchy and assigned to the duc de Bouillon. Main sights In the central and oldest quarter of the town, the streets are narrow and irregular; the surrounding suburbs, however, are modern and more spacious, with La Folie to the East, for example, containing many villas belonging to rich wine merchants. The town has also spread to the right bank of the Marne. One of its churches retains a portal and stained-glass windows from the sixteenth century, but the other public buildings are of modern construction. The most famous street in √âpernay is the Avenue de Champagne which features the leading Champagne manufacturers. Other sights outside the town include: *Ch√¢teau de Pierry *Ch√¢teau de Montmort *Ch√¢teau de Cond√© Economy √âpernay is best known as the principal \\"entrep√¥t\\" for champagne wines, which are bottled and kept in large cellars built into the chalk rock on which the town is built. The production of the equipment and raw materials used in the champagne industry is a major source of local employment. Champagne Pannier, among others, was established in √âpernay before moving to Ch√¢teau-Thierry in 1937. Brewing and sugar refinery and the production of hats and caps, are also major industries.

Dousman Hercules Louis Dousman (August 4, 1800 ‚Äì September 12, 1868) was a fur trader and real-estate speculator who played a large role in the economic development of frontier Wisconsin. He is often called Wisconsin's first millionaire. Early life and trading activities Dousman was born in 1800 on Mackinac Island, Michigan, the son of Michael Dousman, a prominent local fur trader, and his wife. His father was highly successful and sent the son back East to be educated in Elizabethtown, New Jersey. For a period he worked as a clerk in a New York City store. After Dousman returned to Mackinac Island, he was employed by the American Fur Company, which his father had served as an agent following the War of 1812. In 1826, the company sent Dousman to the frontier settlement of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, where he worked as an assistant to Joseph Rolette, the company's local agent. In Prairie du Chien, Dousman proved his abilities as a trader, quickly rising in the company's ranks. By 1834 he had acquired an interest in the company's Western Outfit, and in 1840 he became an equal partner in the business together with Joseph Rolette and Henry Hastings Sibley. In 1842 the American Fur Company declared bankruptcy, as the European market had declined, and furs were harder to find in the West. To continue in the trade, Dousman entered into a joint venture with Rolette, Sibley, and Pierre Chouteau (of St. Louis, Missouri) to organize a new company to replace it on upper Mississippi. A few months later, Rolette died in debt to the new company, and most of his estate was seized by the remaining partners, including Dousman. With this and other revenue, Dousman acquired more wealth. He began to invest in lumber mills in northern Wisconsin and real estate in some of the state's growing population centers. Timber was in high demand in the developing settlements of the upper Midwest. As Dousman began building his investments during the 1830s, he began a long affair with Margaret Campbell, a local Prairie du Chien woman, who may have been of mixed-race. Together they had three children: Emily, George, and a third unnamed child who died at birth in 1838. Campbell also died of complications at this birth. In 1844, two years after Joseph Rolette's death, Dousman married his widow, Jane. (She and Rolette had legally separated in 1836, and he built a house for her.) Together the couple moved into the large two-story brick house that Dousman had constructed a year earlier. Hercules and Jane Dousman had one son, Hercules Louis Dousman II, who was born on April 3, 1848, the year that Wisconsin became a state. The Villa Louis In the 1870s the Dousman house at this site was replaced with what is known as Villa Louis. This was also called the \\"House on the Mound\\", because of its location on what is believed to be a prehistoric Indian earthwork mound. Community leader As Wisconsin and the region attracted more European Americans, the fur trade declined. The European demand had declined with changes of fashion and the Native Americans, who provided the pelts and were important customers for manufactured goods, were being pushed west by new settlers. Dousman withdrew from the fur trade in the late 1840s and focused on his investments. In addition to having numerous holdings in real estate, grain, and lumber, Dousman became involved in transportation companies. He invested in packet companies and steamboats that ran on the Mississippi River. In 1852, Dousman became a principal investor in the Madison & Prairie du Chien Railroad, a company formed to ensure that the larger Milwaukee & Mississippi Railroad would meet its goal of connecting Lake Michigan with the Mississippi River. The two companies combined a few years later, and eventually developed as the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. Dousman was very influential in bringing the railroad to Prairie du Chien by 1857, and the Milwaukee & Mississippi was the first railroad to lay track all the way across Wisconsin. Prairie du Chien's new rail connection caused a small boom in the city's population and business. Since Dousman owned much of the land in the city, he made a large profit from this . His net worth was estimated at one million dollars, when fewer than a thousand Americans could claim to possess such a figure. Death and legacy Dousman died of heart failure on September 12, 1868. By this time he was regarded as one of Wisconsin's wealthiest and most influential men. His wife Jane and son Louis inherited his estate. Dousman is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Prairie du Chien. *Although he died before Villa Louis was constructed, the mansion is preserved as a recognized historic site in part because of Dousman's significance in the region. *Dousman is featured as the central character in two novels by August Derleth, Bright Journey and The House on the Mound.Dousman, Hercules Louis 1800 - 1868, Wisconsin Historical Society Notes External links * * Dousman, Hercules Louis 1800-1868  Wisconsin Historical Society Category:1800 births Category:1868 deaths Category:19th-century American businesspeople Category:American fur traders Category:People from Mackinac Island, Michigan Category:People from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin ","title":"Hercules L.

An estimated 33,000 attended the session (there are 17,000 permanent grandstand seats), easily breaking the track's attendance record. Pinks is the primary television series in a franchise series of television programs on SPEED TV based on street racing, held at legal closed drag strips with a theme around drag racing. The original aired from 2005 to 2008, with the spinoff Pinks: All Out following in 2006 until 2010. The name of the show, and the tagline \\"Lose the race ‚Äì lose your ride\\", refer to common slang of pink slips representing a vehicle's title document recording ownership, and the derivative street-racing phrase, \\"racing for pinks,\\" meaning a race in which the winner earns the loser's car. (In California, until recently, the vehicle title was on a pink slip of paper.) The original was aired by Speed Channel in the United States and Canada, and also airs on Fox Sports 3 in Australia. The series is produced by Pullin Television. The 2016 version will air on Outdoor Channel and Fox Sports Racing starting in March 2016 Produced by Brian Bossone's production company Boss One Media llc. Competitors compete in a drag race (although in the original Pinks, there was a stepladder shifter kart race in Series 1, and the original franchise was based more on illegal street racing) in the franchise. The formats differ between the franchise's formats. In the original series, the illegal street racing style drag race has provisions of the winner claiming ownership of the losing vehicle. The race format changed slightly through each season: * Early Series 1 (2005): 2 out of 3 races * Later Series 1-Series 4 (2005‚Äì2007): 3 out of 5 races * Series 5 (2008): 4 out of 7 races As the show starts, the host, staff, and contestants sign a binding contract that will transfer the legal title of the two cars in question to Pullin Television, the production company of the show. Since the production company owns the vehicles it guarantees that the show will award the titles to both cars to the winner of the race and eliminates the chance that the loser will refuse to forfeit his/her car after the race. Negotiations Each team is allowed to inspect the opposing team's car to attempt to assess its performance before negotiations for the first race, or in cases where the negotiations are not held for the first race, before the second. Each team chooses a negotiator to act as its spokesperson to discuss the terms of each round. In recent seasons, the first round of each match is often held without negotiation except for terms over the use of nitrous oxide, and features a heads-up start (each car side by side with no time or length handicap) Negotiations generally deal with starting position, similar to bracket racing (except it is negotiated in car lengths, not seconds), nitrous use, and other such issues, the purpose being to handicap the perceived stronger car and create an even race. In Series 5, negotiating car setup for bracket racing times were permitted. After the negotiations (which can last considerably longer than what is shown), the cars are sent to the start line for the burnout. Race As is the case for a regular drag race, the cars are allowed to perform a burnout, after which they are staged according to the negotiated starting positions (if any). If a track official finds suspicious fluids leaking on the track, he may order the car shut down and the round automatically forfeited to the opponent. If there are mechanical or weather questions, the race may be delayed. In some cases, a show taping may be called off if the weather prevents a full race from being filmed. Pinks uses a street-race-style arm-drop start rather than the \\"Christmas Tree\\" electronic starting system used in modern drag racing. The show's signature start signal was devised by show creator and host Rich Christensen. Christensen points at the driver of the car on his right (left lane), waits for the driver to respond with a thumbs up, then drops that arm. Christensen then repeats this with the driver on his left (right lane). Next, Christensen raises both arms, waits for 2 ‚Äì 5 seconds and then lowers his arms to start the race, which eliminates a popular tactic in drag racing, the delay box, from being used by the car. Officials, both from the show (since Series 2) and track, observe conditions and tape them for replay in case of false starts (leaving before the hands drop), race infractions (standard drag racing rules apply), and photo finishes. In the case of a photo finish, the video tape of the finish is brought to the start line to allow the teams to agree on the result. Fouls As in drag racing, the following are declared fouls on Pinks and the offender loses the round: * Leaving before Christensen drops his hands. It is a clean start if the car moves once the hands begin dropping. Officials may use replay to verify the legality of a start. If a driver leaves as soon as the hand begins to drop from its highest point, a driver is said to have tree'd their opponent. ** If both cars jump, the first to jump loses (red light). ** Rich will often point at the offending lane if he spots the infraction. * Crossing either boundary line * Leaking fluid during staging ** At that point, Christensen will point to the opponent and point him down the track for a bye run and an automatic win. * Breaking down and not finishing the run ** Although it has never happened, it is unknown what would happen if one car commits a foul start and the opponent crosses the boundary line. In normal drag racing, the foul start driver wins. * In Series 5, if negotiations call for bracket race rules, and one car clearly breaks out while the opponent does not break out, that can be grounds for disqualification for sandbagging. ** Technical advisors will determine time through the timing traps as the scoreboard is turned off, officials still have the ability to observe track timing through the electronic timing system. ** Times will be taken from standard points at the track and compared to the times from the vehicle's earlier races in order to see where the car \\"breaks out\\", with the timing of the racer's start taken into account. ** The standard timing points in drag racing, excluding the 60-feet time (which Pinks does not use because of the nature of head starts), used by officials are at: *** 330 feet *** 660 feet *** 1,000 feet *** 1,320 feet ** It is important that times be compared all along the track as opposed to merely the finish line as a driver, once he has reason to believe he's going to win the race, can easily \\"pedal\\" or \\"fender\\" his opponent giving him smaller margin of victory, and a higher lap time. Winning The match ends when one driver has won the said number of rounds above (2, 3, or 4). After Christensen debriefs the two teams on the previous race, he announces the winner. He then hands the title of both cars to the race winner, and often the winner drives the loser's car down the strip after claiming the car by winning the match. A team may also concede because of a catastrophic breakdown. In the spirit of sportsmanship, such a win will often not include the loser's car and often calls for a rematch on a later episode, believing that they will not take the car unless it was a clear win on the track, and not by default. Notes A common occurrence is \\"set matches\\", such as import vs. domestic, new vs. old models of a certain make, or races of popular former cars, such as current technical advisor Charles Hendrickson's \\"Woolly Mammoth\\", an altered 1976 Chevrolet Vega wagon that beat several more sporty cars. Other matches have featured motorcycles, trucks, and even snowmobiles. Recent shows have been sponsored (with prizes going to the winner such as free Bridgestone tires or several cases of Shell Q Motor Oil), with Series Four featuring NAPA Auto Parts as the series presenting sponsor for both the regular and All Out series, owing to the show's growing popularity. Current sponsors are NAPA and Valvoline. The arm-drop start prevents bracket racers from using the delay box, a popular device that is typically used in this genre of drag racing. Typically, with the Christmas tree, the delay box is designed to allow a driver to press the throttle pedal on the second amber, allowing the box to launch the car one second, or in the case on the third amber, a half-second later. The arm drop's unpredictability prevents this popular technique from being used, which forces drivers to watch the official to launch the car. In 2008, the American Drag Racing League was forced to a Pinks-style arm drop start for the final two rounds of their 1/8 mile races when lightning damaged the Christmas tree at US 131 Motorsports Park in Martin, Michigan. On the May 28, 2006 episode of WindTunnel with Dave Despain, the show's producer and host Rich Christensen claimed that some losing racers tried to buy back the vehicle after the race, which Rich tried to eliminate in later seasons. However, one race resulted in a win by default when the engine block overheated, leading to a win by \\"catastrophic failure\\". In the spirit of sportsmanship, the winner gave the car back to the loser, noting that a win by default caused by such severe mechanical failure is improper, and promised a future rematch. On multiple episodes Rich has allowed a car that has lost due to mechanical failure to be granted back or purchased back by its original owner so it may be raced again. In each of these cases the original episode was unusable due to the nature of the catastrophic failure, so had another race not been held, the episodes likely would have never aired. In 2008, a special episode, \\"Quitters, No Shows, and Breakdowns\\" featured many aborted races. Because of the nature of the show's premise of racing for titles, taping the show is illegal in 40 states. This problem led to the development of a spinoff that does not involve titles and is legal to be taped in all 50 states.http://www.wellandtribune.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1138172 Pinks: All Out The popularity of the original show led to a full drag meet devised by the staff, with this title in 2006. The goal is to take over 400 cars, run them in trial runs to see which 16 cars will provide the most competitive racing, then race those 16 cars against each other, all in the course of one day. The format later changed to 32 cars. =Qualifying= As the show opens, a scene shows Rich Christensen discussing how many cars have filed for entry, usually between 250‚Äì450, but some Season 3 races feature over 500 cars. The popularity of entries have resulted in the possibility of filing a Pinks entry to be nearly impossible (only 400 cars) that Christensen and the tracks have added \\"runoffs\\" weeks before the Pinks meet. Once entries have filled, most tracks will run a special qualifying race to fill out extra entries. As cars prepare to compete, they are inspected by track officials and technical advisors, including former Pinks contestant turned technical advisor Brian Bossone, and cars are eliminated for problems that may lead to mechanical failure the most notable of which being fluids spilled onto the track, as that can take an hour or more to clean up so racing may resume. Starting in Season 3, automatic disqualification is called for any car that causes a leak of fluids that requires a long delay, especially in violation of track rules. Unless situations require altering the schedule (inclement weather), the cars take part in one pass per car, using the Christmas tree. This pass uses the Pro Tree (all three ambers light at the same time, then the green four-tenths later) instead of the Standard Tree used by the sportsman drivers that participate in the show (each amber five-tenths after the other), and with the track clocks running and scoreboards displaying time. At the end of the session, the show officials then determine the most competitive field (not necessarily the fastest) by finding a grouping of cars whose race time are very close together. Those cars are asked to return to the strip for an additional timed run to ensure there is no sandbagging. In the first few seasons, the clock displays were turned off so that only Pinks officials know the elapsed time of the cars. The Christmas tree is turned off, and either Rich or Kail Christensen start the run with the show's signature arm-drop start. Sixteen cars (but more often 32 in recent years although there was a 64-car field once), known as the \\"All Out 16\\", are then chosen by the producers to compete in the main portion of the competition. The cars are not formally bracketed, so the producers and technical officials may determine the race by car types (often by the classic GM-Ford, Ford-FCA, or GM-FCA rivalries, or brand nationality), driver types (sometimes past Pinks grudges, family members, or region), or any manner which they may choose (closest in elapsed time). However the competition is generally limited to what the technical advisors (most of them racers) decide is the \\"most competitive\\" field. In many cases they will attempt to come up with something interesting to further qualify the field, for example a slower class being allowed to earn a spot in the final 16, but in every case the idea is to find a full class of at least 16 cars in which each car is running within a tenth to 2 tenths of a second of each other. Starting in Season 3, the rules of the arm-drop qualifying pass were changed following evaluations. Cars are now paired by their elapsed time, with officials determining a \\"floating minimum\\" time that will be posted as the cars are staging. The cars must run faster than the posted time on the display near the starter to continue being considered. This again assists in weeding out sandbagging. In all cases, the idea is to once again weed out teams that use the delay box, since the Pro Tree would throw off Sportsman racers whose reaction times are based on using a delay box (.500 or 1.000 seconds delay from throttle to launch), and the arm drop is based on a driver's reflexes, and not anything artificial. The faster official time that is registered in the track computers will form the basis of the \\"dial-in\\" time which will be referenced during the race. Some sessions (Milan (MI) Dragway and Summit Motorsports Park) require the sixteen cars initially selected to \\"hold\\" their positions in 16 drag races where they would race against other formidable opponents. This led to a change to 32 cars for most of Season 3. For the 2015 series, the rules will call for two different classes with each bracket (8‚Äì10, 10‚Äì11, 11‚Äì13 cars, and motorcycles TBD). Two groups of 16 will be selected in each bracket. =Race= Pinks All Out 32 (Some Season 2 and Most Season 3 races) Starting with some Season 2 races, and in most Season 3 races unless inclement weather or curfew force a condensed schedule (the 2009 Texas Motorplex race was condensed because of curfew; two 90-minute delays were caused by cleanup as a result of ethylene glycol coolant spilling on the track, a violation of drag strip rules prohibiting such coolants on the track), a group of 16 cars, dubbed in Season 3 as \\"Underdogs\\", will race another group of 16 cars, the \\"Defenders\\". Each pair of cars will race a single set of eliminations, using the signature Pinks arm-drop start. The winners advance to the Pinks All Out 16. Standard bracket racing rules apply, with drivers being eliminated for infractions, and a breakout rule applies. If officials discover the winner of the race was running considerably faster than the fastest official time of the 16 cars, that car will be disqualified and the loser advances. Pinks technical advisors will review elapsed times in the timing tower to ensure no violation of breakout rules apply. For the 2009 race at zMax Dragway, the field was started with 64 cars instead of 32. The 32 races took place with half on the left pair and half on the right pair of lanes. In the final season (2010) of the original series, winning this round was worth a gift certificate worth around $500 from a sponsor. Pinks All Out 16 Season 1 and some races in Season 2 afterwards (starting in Season 3, only if weather becomes an issue) start with just the All Out 16, while some Season 2 and most Season 3 races begin with the first round, leading to the All Out 16. As in the first round, each pair of cars (there is no formal pairing) will race in single-elimination rounds using the arm drop start. In this round, the winner receives $1,000 that may be used as betting money in further rounds, and advances to the Pinks All Out 8. At Charlotte Motor Speedway's zMax Dragway, the 32 winners of the first round (expanded to 64 cars) raced in eight four-car drag races administered like the Pinks All Out 16 round format. The winners of the four- car drag races advanced to the Pinks All Out 8 with the $1,000. In later seasons, betting on winnings were prohibited, and drivers won straight prize money‚Äîtypically $500. In the 2015 revival series, the cars must be driven back to the starting line on their own power between rounds. No use of any pit equipment is permitted or the competitor is disqualified. Pinks All Out 8 and 4 (all) and Championship round (revival series) For each round leading up to the final, the driver's total cash winnings to that point ($1,000 to start Pinks All Out 8) may be used as betting money. Drivers may bet as much of their winnings in each round, but starting in Season 3, the limit is $500. Titles and money that was not awarded for a victory may not be bet. In addition to advancing to the next round, the winner gets whatever money their opponent bet, if any. During the 2007 round taped at The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, all 16 All Out drivers agreed to bet all winnings for an \\"all in\\" tournament. No other taping has featured the all-in format. The winners in the All Out 8 advance to the All Out 4, with the same format as the All Out 8 in regards to betting, and the winners of the All Out 4 advance to the All Out Final. Again, in later seasons, the prize money format was changed to $750 in the All Out 8, and $1,000 in the All Out 4. No betting permitted. In the 2015 revival series, the Championship round in each of the two brackets is determined the same way. The winner wins $2,500 for the bracket championship. Championship round ‚Äì Original Series After the third round, the two remaining teams determine lane choice, and in earlier seasons, betting. In many circumstances at this point Rich Christensen will suggest the finalists duel for the prize money only. Then, the cars race in a best two-out-of-three match. Unless requested by a competitor because of a mechanical problem or in case of inclement weather, the cars must be driven back to the starting line on their own power between rounds and be staged for another race immediately. Once the cars are back at the staging area, the process for the next race begins immediately. This is referred to as \\"hot lapping\\". The winner of the finals, in addition to any money bet by their opponent, also wins a $10,000 cash prize. In the original series, a tool chest with tools valued at over $7,000 from NAPA Auto Parts was also provided. The only exception to this format came during the February 17, 2007 taping at Palm Beach International Raceway. An excessive number of track incidents (oil downs, crashes, debris) slowed the process, where the main elimination rounds started after midnight. With excessively low temperatures when the semifinal rounds were to start after 2:15 AM, the race was called after the second round by mutual consent of the four drivers remaining because of lane conditions. All four drivers split the $10,000 evenly, and one driver, as chosen by the others, won the tool chest. Classic Pinks Final (2015) The winners of the two brackets (12‚Äì13 seconds, for example) return to a Classic Final format similar to the original Pinks, except instead of car titles, the two teams can bet some of their winnings in the final, with the producers adding cash bonuses to the pot. Based on performance results from the bracket finals that will be given to both teams and the staff, the two teams can negotiate lengths, format (one round only or two out of three), and lane choice. The overall Pinks All Out champion under the 2015 format is the competitor who wins the match.Pinks All Out 2015 =Sandbagging= The All Out format was created because of Rich Christensen‚Äôs displeasure with 'sandbagging‚Äô ‚Äì feathering or decelerating to create a false elapsed time and hide actual performance ‚Äì on the original Pinks. This format, where brothers and technical directors Adam and Nate Pritchett rigorously select a group of closely matched cars, was made to provide the drama associated with closer racing. To prevent sandbagging, if a car runs considerably faster than what they ran in practice during any elimination round, they are automatically disqualified (\\"Breakout\\"). Officials will be standing at the 1,000 and 1,320 foot markers to observe if a driver is sandbagging. The show was originally to be titled \\"Ultimate Racer\\" but was later changed to the current \\"All Out\\" subtitle, a reference that the car is running at its maximum during the race. =Quick Eight= During taping sessions in 2007 and 2008, officials grew suspicious excessive sandbagging was taking place among racers. Some racers, the officials thought, were running slower times than their cars could run in an attempt to run \\"in the pack\\" where they predicted the crew would choose for the All Out 16. In response to that, some 2008 rounds added a Quick Eight format, where the eight fastest cars would make one championship pass down the strip. The driver with the fastest elapsed time wins $10,000 and a second NAPA toolchest. In other rounds, the Quick Eight became a knockout round, with the eight fastest cars racing against each other in eliminations before the Pinks All Out 16. A pilot was taped during one 2008 taping for this concept to be split into a separate series. The format has continued for live events in 2009, with the Quick Eight race (now usually run as a straight-up eight-car knockout format) before the Pinks All Out 32. The Quick Eight has their own prizes. Motorcycles in the Future On October 4, 2008, Rich Christensen taped two pilots for future consideration, including a fourth concept of the Pinks franchise, at Maryland International Raceway in Budds Creek, MD. This version, involving motorcycles, featured two classes (Street Bikes and Pro Elapsed Time) of motorcycles. A Pinks All Out 16 was formed from each class. Each class races, Pinks-style, in eliminations to determine their own winner. The winners of each class will participate in a classic Pinks best 4 out of 7 race, complete with classic rules (negotiations, et al.) where the winner wins a new custom motorcycle. While the format was not picked up, the 2015 revival of Pinks : All Out will feature at least one motorcycle class that was be taped as part of Pinks : All Out Week. An all-terrain vehicle 1/8 mile format was also taped and included into an episode. Staff The show is hosted by Rich Christensen, who also employs his cousin Kail as an official. Former contestants Charles Hendrickson and Nathan Pritchett (the only person to have run matches with both a car and a motorcycle) are assigned to each team as technical advisors. Gavin Jerome is the roving public address announcer. Former contestant Brian Bossone has also been utilized as a technical adviser. Steve Meade, known as radio personality \\"Willie B\\" in Denver, and Clay Millican, NHRA Mello Yello Top Fuel driver, join the Pinks staff in 2009 as technical advisers. Rich Christensen and Brian Bossone (Boss One Media) Reacquires the Franchise and Future At the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season, Fox Cable Networks did not renew Pinks : All Out due to the change from Speed to Fox Sports 1. By 2012, as Fox wound down the Speed operations, the franchise was owned by 21st Century Fox. Meanwhile, another street-racing game show format from Lucas Oil owned MAVTV that Christensen developed, Won & Done, was airing. On March 24, 2014, Christensen confirmed on Dragzine.com that Rich Christensen Entertainment had leased the Pinks franchise rights from Fox and was working on a plan with Boss One Media's Brian Bossone for the future of the franchise.Rich Christen discusses the return of Pinks: All Out On February 13, 2015, Christensen, Boss One Media and Rockingham Dragway owner Steve Earwood announced Pinks: All Out Week, an entire Independence Day weekend of taping of episodes. The show originally planned three classes (9.00‚Äì9.99, 10.00‚Äì10.99, 11.00‚Äì11.99), motorcycle classes (something that had not been part of the original Pinks: All Out), and a Quick Eight of under 8.99 seconds. Taping is scheduled between July 2‚Äì4, 2015 for multiple episodes, at least one each night. However, the immense popularity of registration has forced the show to change the car classes to 8.00‚Äì9.99 (8‚Äì10 seconds), 10.00‚Äì10.99 (10‚Äì11 seconds), and 11.00‚Äì12.99 (11‚Äì13 seconds). Two eighth-mile classes‚Äîan all-terrain vehicle class and Jr Dragsters‚Äîwill also be added. The new format began airing on Outdoor Channel on March 7, 2016. Attendance Normally attendance at live tapings is high, with amateur races and concerts (usually featuring The Nadas, who perform the original show's ending theme \\"Walk Away\\") bookending the televised races. In the June 29‚Äì30, 2007 taping of Pinks: All Out at Milan (MI) Dragway, 33,000 spectators attended the taping with 350 cars attempting to compete for the 16 slots.Pinks ‚Äî All Out! 07/15/07 On December 3, 2007, the 400 entries for a June 7, 2008 taping of Pinks: All Out at Summit Racing Equipment Motorsports Park in Norwalk, Ohio, were filled in 12 minutes. PINKS: ALL OUT FILLS 400 ENTRIES IN 12 MINUTES ‚Äî Summit Motorsports Park On January 6, 2008, the 400 entries for a July 25, 2008 taping of Pinks: All Out at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park in Englishtown, New Jersey, were filled in less than 1 minute. Rockingham Dragway, which was the host for the taping of the \\"NEW\\" 2016 episodes aired on Outdoor Channel, reported a high number of registrations(500) forcing the producers to adjust the classes planned for each of three days of Pinks : All Out competition, effectively turning the fast class to 8‚Äì9:99 ET second class to 10‚Äì10:99 second ET class and the slowest 11‚Äì12:99 second class along with an added Motorcycle,ATV and Jr Dragster class as well.

Established in 1920, ITB is the oldest and first technology-oriented university in Indonesia. ITB was considered the top choice among Indonesia's high school students in 2006 and has been credited as one of the most prestigious universities in Indonesia, together with Gadjah Mada University and University of Indonesia. Sukarno, the first president of the Republic of Indonesia, earned his engineering degree in civil engineering from ITB. Furthermore, B. J. Habibie, the third president of Indonesia, also spent a year in the mechanical engineering department of ITB and is officially recognized as a graduate. The university cultivates professional and social activities by supporting its students' unions, the student government councils that exist in every department. Each students' union has its own distinctly designed jacket that, among other traditions, serves as part of its member identity. There are also a number of student activity units/clubs supporting ITB student interests in rounding out their educational experience. It is not uncommon that the students and alumni are identified by the clubs to which they belong (or used to belong) at ITB, in addition to their class year and major. As of 2020, ITB had thirteen undergraduate study programs been internationally accredited from an independent U.S.-based accrediting institution, Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. The thirteen study programs are Electrical Engineering, Informatics, Chemical Engineering, Engineering Physics, Industrial Engineering, Engineering Management, Ocean Engineering, Petroleum Engineering, Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Mining Engineering, Electrical Power Engineering, and Telecommunication Engineering. ITB's march \\"Mars ITB\\" and hymn \\"Hymne ITB\\" were arranged by a former professor, Prof. Dr. Sudjoko Danoesoebrata. Historical Background De Technische Hoogeschool te Bandoeng, circa 1924-1932 The East Hall of Tecnische Hogeschool in Bandung in 1929 ITB traces its origin to de Technische Hoogeschool te Bandoeng (THB) which was founded by the patronage of Karel Albert Rudolf Bosscha, a Bandung plantation owner, industrialist and philanthropist, and the support from the Dutch colonial administration, to meet the needs of technical resources in Dutch East Indies. The school building was designed in 1918 by a Dutch architect named Henri Maclaine Pont, who was inspired by Indonesian vernacular architecture and blending it with modern elements.The quest for the ultimate architecture Indonesia in the late colonial period , pac-nl.org When the school opened its door for the first time on 3 July 1920, it only had one department namely 'de Faculteit van Technische Wetenschap' (Faculty of Technical Science) and one academic major of 'de afdeeling der Weg en Waterbouw' (the department of Road and Water resources engineering). During the Japanese occupation in 1942-1945, the institute was renamed K≈çgy≈ç Daigaku (Â∑•Ê•≠Â§ßÂ≠¶, 'Industrial University'). When Indonesia declared its independence the campus was renamed \\"Sekolah Tinggi Teknik\\" (STT) (Technical High School) in 1945. However a year later the Netherlands returned to Indonesia and took directorship of the campus, it was used as \\"Nood-Universiteit van Nederlandsch Indi√´\\" (emergency university of Dutch East Indies). Later in 1947 the campus housed the Faculteit van Technische Wetenschap (faculty of engineering) and Faculteit van Exacte Wetenschap (faculty of science) which is under Universiteit van Indonesi√´ (later University of Indonesia). In 1950 after the Netherlands left Indonesia, the university became faculty of engineering and faculty of natural sciences, under University of Indonesia. On 2 March 1959, the 2 faculty of University of Indonesia in Bandung was declared a separate academic entity. On Government Regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah) No. 155/2000, ITB was declared a Legal Enterprise (Badan Hukum). Bandung Institute of Technology was founded for higher learning in natural sciences, technologies, and fine arts. Campus alt= ITB Library in 2007 The ITB main campus, to the north of the downtown Bandung, and its other campuses, cover a total area of about 770,000 square metres. Students and faculty housing, and administrative headquarters are not on the main campus, but are located within proximity. Facilities on the campus include book shops, a post office, student cafeteria and medical clinic. In addition to lecture rooms, laboratories, workshops and studios, ITB has an art gallery, sports facilities and a student activities' centre. For implementation of academic and research activities there are seven academic support facilities, namely, the Central Library (with approximately 150,000 books and 1000 journal titles) on campus, Sports Centre, Language Centre and the Bosscha Observatory (a facility of the Department of Astronomy) in Lembang, 11 kilometres to the north of Bandung. Academics =Quality and Reputation= ITB is ranked 313th at 2021 QS World University Rankings, and ranked 66th in QS Asian University Rankings.https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/bandung-institute- technology-itb#wurs ITB is considered to have the highest selectivity in the field of science and engineering in the SNMPTN (nationwide state university entrance test) in 2009 from 422,159 examinees competing for its limited 2,000 seats.http://sosialbudaya.tvone.co.id/berita/view/19209/2009/07/31/sebanyak_92511_calon_mahasiswa_lolos_snmptn_2009/ The passing grades required to enter its top four favorite faculties i.e., Faculty of Industrial Technology (FTI), Faculty of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (FTMD), School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics (STEI) and Faculty of Mining and Petroleum Engineering (FTTM) are the highest in the nationwide state university entrance test (SNMPTN & SBMPTN). Its business school, School of Business and Management (SBM) is considered as the most prestigious and elite business school in Indonesia and regarded as the best business school in Indonesia by eduniversal ranking, global brand magazine and SWA Magazine, the most popular business magazine in Indonesia.Peringkat Ranking Sekolah Bisnis Terbaik di Indonesia  blog strategi + manajemen =Research= According to the rector of ITB, ITB had built an eight-storey mining research centre for both national and international research such as research on oil reservoirs, production optimisation, geological exploitation and coal exploitation development worth Rp110 billion ($12.1 million). =Faculties and Programs= Consisting of 12 faculties and schools, ITB is not only focused on the fields of STEM but also arts and business management which have been recognized at national and international levels.

Biography His family, one of the numerous branches of the House of Gontaut, took its title from the territory of Biron in P√©rigord, where on a hill between the Dropt and the Lide still stands the magnificent Ch√¢teau de Biron begun by the lords of Biron in the 11th century. As a page of Queen Marguerite de Navarre, Biron attracted the notice of the marshal de Brissac, with whom he saw active service in Italy. A wound he received in his early years made him lame for life, and gave him the nickname Armand Le Boiteux (the limper). But he did not withdraw from the military career, and he held a command in Guise's regiment of light horse in 1557. A little later he became chief of a cavalry regiment, and in the French Wars of Religion he repeatedly distinguished himself. His service to the royal cause at the Battle of Dreux, Battle of Saint-Denis, Battle of Jarnac and Battle of Moncontour was rewarded in 1569 by his appointment as a privy councillor of the king and Grand Master of Artillery. He commanded the royal forces at the siege of La Rochelle in 1572, and four years later was made a marshal of France. From 1576 to 1588 he was almost continuously employed in high command. After the assassination of Henry III in 1589, he was among the first to support the cause of Henry of Navarre, but he was suspected of prolonging the civil wars in his own interest. He brought a part of Normandy under subjection, and dissuaded Henry from going into England. He distinguished himself in the battles of Arques and Ivry against the Catholic League. Gontaud was killed by a cannonball at the siege of √âpernay on 26 July 1592. In 1585 he was chosen a godfather for Armand-Jean du Plessis, future cardinal Richelieu. He was a man of considerable literary attainments, and used to carry a pocketbook, in which he noted everything that appeared remarkable. Some of his letters are preserved in the Biblioth√®que nationale and in the British Museum; these include a treatise on the art of war. His son, Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron (1562‚Äì1602), also became Marshal of France in 1594. A grandson of his second son, Henry, was Charles- Armand de Gontaut, another Marshal of France.

The term originates from Everett M. Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations (1962). History Typically this will be a customer who, in addition to using the vendor's product or technology, will also provide considerable and candid feedback to help the vendor refine its future product releases, as well as the associated means of distribution, service, and support. Early adoption could also be referred to as a form of testing in the early stages of a project. Rogers' bell curve384x237px The relationship is synergistic, with the customer having early (and sometimes unique, or at least uniquely early) access to an advantageous new product or technology, but he or she also serves as a kind of guinea pig. In exchange for being an early adopter, and thus being exposed to the problems, risks, and annoyances common to early-stage product testing and deployment, the lighthouse customer is sometimes given especially attentive vendor assistance and support, even to the point of having personnel at the customer's work site to assist with implementation. The customer is sometimes given preferential pricing, terms, and conditions, although new technology is often very expensive, so the early adopter still often pays quite a lot. The vendor, on the other hand, benefits from receiving early revenues, and also from a lighthouse customer's endorsement and assistance in further developing the product and its go-to- market mechanisms. Acquiring lighthouse customers is a common step in new product development and implementation. The real-world focus that this type of relationship can bring to a vendor can be extremely valuable. Early adoption does come with pitfalls: early versions of products may be buggy and/or prone to malfunction. Furthermore, more efficient, and sometimes less expensive, versions of the product usually appear a few months after the initial release (Apple iPhone).\\"Top 5ive Gadgets You Shouldn't Buy\\", AOL Money & Finance (page saved by the Internet Archive, April 12, 2008)Making sense of the million- dollar iPhone lawsuit, CNet, October 3, 2007 (page saved by the Internet Archive on October 26, 2012) The trend of new technology costing more at release is often referred to as the \\"early adopter tax\\".

As a noted intellectual, he influenced popular perceptions of politics, media, the arts, and Mexican society in general. He was a member of Los Contempor√°neos, a group of Mexican writers, as well as of the Mexican Academy of the Language. Life & career Novo defied the machismo and conservative Catholicism prevalent in 20th century Mexican culture by making almost no efforts to conceal his sexuality. He was, however, accepted by the Mexican government. He held official posts related to culture, was elected to the Mexican Language Academy, and had a television program on Mexico City's history. Towards the end of his life, he dyed his hair a bright carrot color and wore many ostentatious rings and colored suits. He has been compared to Oscar Wilde, but unlike Wilde, Novo never suffered the setback of scandal or persecution and remained an accepted and respected member of society and governmental circles until his death. In fact, some sectors resented the fact that a gay writer would align himself so closely with the government and media after the repression of social movements in the 1960s and 1970s. He was well known for his wit. When a party, where young soldiers had been invited by gay scholar friends of his, had degenerated into a fight and a scandal, Salvador Novo brushed off the whole matter with a factual: \\"This is what happens when members of the intellectual elite try to enter military circles\\". In accordance with tradition, the street on which he lived was renamed after him when he assumed the role of Mexico City's official chronicler, a post held for life.

The first named storm, the first hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Alex developed from the interaction between an upper-level low and a weak surface trough on July 31 to the east of Jacksonville, Florida. It moved northeastward, and strengthened to attain winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) before passing within 10 miles (16 km) of the Outer Banks coast. Alex strengthened further and reached a peak of 120 mph (190 km/h) winds while off the coast of New England, one of only six hurricanes to reach Category 3 status north of 38¬∞ N. Alex caused a scare of a hurricane-force direct hit in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, which had been devastated by Hurricane Isabel less than a year earlier. The hurricane produced light damage in the Outer Banks, primarily from flooding and high winds. Over 100 houses were damaged, while numerous cars were disabled from the flooding. Damage totaled about $7.5 million (2004 USD). Alex produced strong waves and rip tides along the East Coast of the United States, causing one death and several injuries. Meteorological history A weak surface trough, located to the west of an upper-level low, developed convection to the east of the Bahamas on July 26. A tropical wave entered the area two days later, resulting in an increase of convective organization and area. Although conditions were not favorable for tropical cyclone formation, it sped to the northwest and steadily organized, developing a surface area of low pressure on the 30th. On July 31, the system continued to organize, and developed into Tropical Depression One while located 200 miles (320 km) to the east of Jacksonville, Florida. As the depression drifted erratically, the system remained weak due to its large circulation and lack of deep convection near the center. The center relocated to the south, closer to the center. An approaching upper-level trough lessened the shear over the system, allowing the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Alex on August 1\\\\. The trough also caused Alex to increase its forward motion to the northeast. Deep convection continued to build over the center due to low shear and warm waters from the Gulf Stream, and Alex intensified into a hurricane on August 3 while located 75 miles (120 km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The cyclone continued to strengthen, and attained Category 2 status just hours after becoming a hurricane. The hurricane approached the Outer Banks of North Carolina, coming within 11 miles (16 km) of Cape Hatteras later on the 3rd. The western portion of the eyewall passed over the Outer Banks, though the center remained offshore. Alex turned to the east-northeast after passing the Outer Banks in response to becoming embedded within the west-southwesterly flow. The hurricane briefly weakened to a Category 1, but restrengthened due to warm waters of the Gulf Stream. Water temperatures remained 3.6¬∞F (2&¬∞C) above normal, resulting in Alex intensifying into a 120 mph (195 km/h) major hurricane on August 5 while located 450 miles (710 km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Due to low vertical shear and favorable conditions, Alex remained a Category 3 hurricane until passing over cooler waters late on the 5th while 290 miles (465 km) south of Newfoundland. Alex rapidly weakened, degrading into tropical storm status on August 6\\\\. Later on the 6th, Alex became extratropical while 950 miles (1530 km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and lost its identity shortly thereafter. Preparations Radar image of Hurricane Alex. Initially, forecasters believed Alex would remain weak, and on the first advisory the storm was predicted to make landfall as a minimal tropical storm. However, when strengthening became evident, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning from Cape Lookout to Oregon Inlet about 20 hours before hurricane conditions were experienced. In addition, a tropical storm warning existed for much of the North Carolina coastline as Alex paralleled the state. Despite Tropical Storm Warnings, 3,500 tourists remained on the Outer Banks, though many planned to leave if Alex were to track closer or become stronger. No evacuations were ordered. Officials recommended residents to take precautions for the approaching hurricane. The National Weather Service in Morehead City issued a flash flood watch a day before the hurricane moved past the Outer Banks. The service also issued flash flooding warnings for Craven and Carteret Counties on the day of the hurricane's closest approach. In preparation for the hurricane, the Cape Lookout National Seashore was closed and evacuated. The National Park Service also closed Cape Point Campground. Impact Hurricane Alex near Outer Banks on August 3 While drifting off the coast of Florida, Alex produced rip currents and strong waves along the North Carolina coast resulting in nine lifeguard rescues from the surf. Upon moving by the Outer Banks, a storm surge of up to 6 feet (1.8 m) occurred on the Pamlico Sound side of Buxton and Ocracoke Village. The flooding on Ocracoke Island was the worst since Hurricane Gloria nineteen years earlier. Elsewhere on the Outer Banks, waters rose 2-4 feet (0.6-1.2 m) above normal. Rainfall directly along the coast amounted to over 5 inches (127 mm), while Ocracoke experienced 7.55 inches (192 mm). Maximum sustained winds peaked at 88 mph (124 km/h), and gusts peaked at 115 mph (169 km/h) in Morehead City. Beach erosion was minor along much of North Carolina's coastline, with the exception of Ocracoke Island where erosion was significant. Cape Fear experienced minor beach erosion. The erosion, combined with high waves, washed out a portion of a roadway. The heavy rainfall in the Outer Banks disabled over 200 cars and flooded nearly 500. Strong wind gusts left around 10,000 buildings without power. Many places were not restored for two to three days after the storm. Wind and storm surge damaged over 100 houses and buildings. Damage amounted to about $7.5 million (2004 USD). Two days after the storm passed, a man drowned off of Nags Head from strong rip currents and waves. This was the only direct casualty from the storm. Alex's outer rainbands produced heavy rainfall across Virginia, peaking at over 7 inches (178 mm) in the center of the state. The rainfall caused localized flooding, but there was no reported damage in the state. In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, rip currents produced by the storm injured three people. A few young children had to be rescued when they were trapped by a jetty. In New Jersey, the strong surf and rip currents hospitalized at least five swimmers. Alex's extratropical remnants sank the Pink Lady, a rowboat carrying four British rowers attempting to break the record for fastest crossing from St. John's, Newfoundland to Falmouth, Cornwall. They were rescued by a Danish cargo ship, and injuries were limited to a mild concussion and a case of hypothermia. The rowers were roughly two weeks and 370 miles (595 km) from their destination. The group had been on track to break the 1896 record of 54 days by 10 days. Aftermath and records Category 3 Hurricane Alex north of 40¬∞ North on August 5 On Ocracoke Island, officials ordered for the evacuation of the thousands of tourists who stayed, believing that keeping tourists on the island would hinder cleanup efforts. The tourists were evacuated in school buses to Hatteras Island, where they could rent a car if needed. Tourists were also evacuated by ferry to Swan Quarter, in Hyde County, where they boarded school buses and were taken to nearby Washington NC to rent available cars or find accommodations. The island was re-opened to visitors on August 6, three days after the storm passed through. Evacuation was ordered again on Friday of the following week when another storm threatened to hit the Outer Banks, but did not do so. Dare County officials requested aid from the National Guard for the cleanup process. The North Carolina Department of Transportation was ready to clear the roads once the storm exited the area. Alex marked the fifth- latest start to a hurricane season since 1954. The latest start to a hurricane season since 1954 was Hurricane Anita of the 1977 season, forming on August 29\\\\. Alex is only the second hurricane on record to have reached Category 3 strength north of 38¬∞N latitude. The other storm was Hurricane Ellen in the 1973 Atlantic hurricane season; Alex was the stronger of the two. It is also one of only five hurricanes to be at major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) status within Canadian waters since 1950.

The character was briefly a member of the X-Men and often works to assist them. Raised in the Bronx, she is Latin American (originating from Puerto Rico) medical doctor specializing in trauma surgery. She has the mutant ability to project a force field around her body. Unlike most X-Men, she has no interest in superheroics, and desires only to live an ordinary life, having been forced into the team by circumstance. Alice Braga portrayed Dr. Cecilia Reyes in the 2020 film The New Mutants. Publication history Created by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Carlos Pacheco, she first appeared in X-Men #65 (June 1997). Fictional character biography =Operation Zero Tolerance= Cecilia Reyes decided to become a doctor when her father was gunned down in front of her as a child, and she was unable to do anything to help him. The X-Men tried recruiting her when it was discovered that she was a mutant, but Reyes had no interest in being a superhero. When she was targeted by Operation: Zero Tolerance, a government-backed anti-mutant task force, she was forced to join forces with the X-Man Iceman and other mutants to escape New York City and track down Bastion, leader of Operation Zero Tolerance.X-Men vol 2 #69 =Becoming an X-Man= She refused to join the X-Men at first, making an attempt to return to her normal life. After meeting with problems with racism and both encouragement from Daredevil and an encounter with the villain Pyro, Reyes reluctantly joined the X-Men. Her first adventure involved saving Cyclops from a nanotech deep inside his body, which threatened to kill him, Reyes, other X-Men and obliterate anything in a three- mile radius. Despite having absolutely no medical supplies, she improvised in her successful attempt. For example, she had Storm use lightning to boil buckets of water. Afterwards, a dazed Cyclops offers her honorary X-Men status.X-Men #70 v2 (December 1997) She has several adventures with the team, combating the Ru'tai and the Shadow King. She usually did not bother with a costume, wearing either the yellow and blue training uniform or, on one occasion as a joke by Beast, an old costume of Wasp's. It was while wearing Wasp's old uniform that Reyes became involved in a battle with the X-Men's frequent enemy, the N'Garai, interdimensional demons. Reyes mostly ran away, but was saved (and mocked) by the X-Man rookie Marrow. She was eventually sucked into the N'Garai dimension, to be experimented upon, but her force field saved her from the cutting instruments. She escaped with the rest of the X-Men and the civilians they had saved.X-Men #75 (vol. 2, June 1998) Reyes was tempted by the Shadow King by offers of a new life, but managed to resist the villain's offer.X-Men #78 (vol. 2, August 1998) Reyes did not find costumed adventuring suitable for her, and left to set up her own medical practice. Later, she was caught up in the X-Men's battle with the Neo, a villainous group of mutants who claimed to have evolved beyond the level of other mutants. Reyes was trapped in the Neo's fortress below New York City and used a street drug called Rave to make her mutant powers more destructive, ensuring her survival. The X-Men rescued her, and the telepathic Professor X helped her kick her addiction to Rave during a detox period back at the X-Mansion. Reyes last appearance with the X-Men was at the time when Beast discovered the cure to the Legacy Virus. She was the one to discover Colossus dead after injecting himself with the cure. Reyes attempted to revive him, but was unsuccessful. =Neverland= Later, she was seen as a prisoner at a mutant concentration camp run by the Weapon X program, called Neverland. There she attempted to use her medical expertise to help out the other prisoners.Weapon X: Days of Future Now #3 She was apparently killed off panel when a brainwashed Agent Zero destroyed the camp, and her death was later confirmed in the letter column of New Excalibur #1. Mike Marts contradicted this in an interview on uncannyxmen.net, stating that if Cecilia would be dead they would show it on panel, and therefore Cecilia was not yet considered deceased at that time. In X-Men: The 198 Files, it has been revealed that Cecilia's older non-mutant brother, Colonel Miguel Reyes, had been assigned to head O*N*E security on the Xavier School grounds, with the purpose of finding out the fate of his sister. =Return= After M-Day and her escape from Neverland, Cecilia volunteers at local homeless shelters as well as working out of her apartment. According to Bobby Soul, she works off the record and under the table. The NYX teenagers bring an injured Tatiana to her for help. During their visit to her apartment she does not reveal to the teens that she used to be an X-Man. After treating Tatiana, she offers them a place to rest while she goes out for a few hours. Unaware Kiden Nixon is following her, she calls up Beast to ask a favor.NYX: No Way Home #4 Later when Cecilia returns with groceries, she finds the teens have left.NYX: No Way Home #5 Sometime after these events, Cecilia moves to the X-Men's new base of operations; Utopia. When Magneto decides to bring back Shadowcat as a good will gesture, Cyclops asks specifically for her to help treat him of any injuries he might have suffered.Uncanny X-Men #522 =The Five Lights= After the events of Second Coming, Cecilia is partnered with Psylocke and sent to Mexico to locate the second of the Five Lights; the first mutants to manifest powers since M-Day. After sedating Gabriel, she informs his parents of what is transpiring and offers him help from the X-Men. Psylocke comes to the room and explains that something has happened, Gabriel's manifesting speed powers caused him to move so fast he is invisible to the naked eye. Psylocke taps into Cecilia's powers to create a force field around his room so they would not lose him before Hope Summers could arrive to help.Uncanny X-Men #527 =X-23= Gambit and X-23 arrive in New York City following a lead from London. Gambit is injured, with his wounds reopening later on. They visit Cecilia at her apartment, and she agrees to give Gambit stitches, but is perturbed at being disturbed and admits she left Utopia to avoid such \\"stupidity\\". X-23 picks up the scents of her friends from NYX in the apartment, and asks where they are. Cecilia states that she gave them permission to stay there before she went to Utopia, but they were gone by the time she returned. X-23 leaves to pursue a lead, and the city is soon rocked by a mysterious earthquake. Cecilia and Gambit help rescue and treat quake victims. Cecilia then accompanies Gambit as he searches for X-23, eventually finding her recovering in the care of the Future Foundation.X-23 #13-14, 16 =Fear Itself= During the \\"Fear Itself\\" storyline, Cecilia is added to a team of X-Men opposing the \\"worthy\\" empowered Juggernaut in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone. She is instructed by Cyclops to protect a mob of anti-mutant protesters following Kuurth's attack.Uncanny X-Men #541 =Astonishing X-Men= Although she is still more comfortable healing humans than fighting superhumans, Cecilia Reyes is part of the new team composed by Wolverine. Alongside Northstar, Iceman, Beast, Gambit and Warbird, she assists to Northstar's wedding and tries to help Karma, whose mind has been taken over Ms. Hatchi for yet unknown reasons. She is also carrying on a romantic relationship with Gambit.Astonishing X-Men 48-53 Powers and abilities Cecilia can generate a force field, described in her first appearance as a \\"psioplasmic bio-field\\" around her body which provides resistance to energy and physical attacks, and can shape or expand it to protect those nearby. Impacts on the force field cause Cecilia pain. She also has shown the ability to wield her forcefield as a blunt force, pushing others out of her way. In X-Men (vol. 2) #100, she created spikes which could punch through a human body. Under the effects of the mutant-enhancing drug Rave, Cecilia is able to use her force field offensively, as a blade to attack enemies. The field can be raised consciously and in her initial appearances, shown triggered by any external force used against it. While effective against most external force, her field leaves her vulnerable to attacks of insufficient force as seen when Colossus rendered her unconscious with a gas weapon. Cecilia is a capable medical doctor and surgeon. Other versions In the Age of X-Man reality, Dr. Cecilia Reyes is the Medical Instructor of the 10th Year class within the Summers Institute Of Higher Learning, located in Winchester, NY.Age of X-Man - NextGen #1 (February 2019) In Days of Future Now, Cecilia survived the death camp Neverland and tried to help Wolverine to change the past to prevent \\"Days of Future Now\\" from ever happening. While watching over him, she was shot in the back by a Fantomex who was under the control of Sublime. In X-Men: The End, she also had survived Neverland and has married Beast and they have three children (two boys and one girl), Ciaran, Francesca & Miguel McCoy. In other media =Film= Alice Braga was cast to portray Cecilia Reyes in The New Mutants, written and directed by Josh Boone. Contrary to the comics, Reyes is depicted as the antagonist and works for Essex Corp., where she is tasked with monitoring the New Mutants in the hopes of recruiting them into their organization.

Actual unit strengths only achieved a portion of their listed organizations. Some of the Norwegian forces were ad hoc battalions. The commander of the Norwegian Army at the time of the invasion was General Kristian Laake. He was replaced by Colonel Otto Ruge on 11 April. Unlike the armies of most other nations, the Norwegian 'division' was more of an administrative and mobilization unit, rather than a fighting unit. The most important tactical unit of the Norwegian army was the regiment. When mobilized, each regiment was supposed to muster two battalions of infantry of the line, and one battalion of landvern. =Norwegian Army= *The Royal Guards battalion ‚Äì based in Oslo and Elverum, the only unit in Southern Norway that received proper training during the inter-war years. *1st Division ‚Äì This division had its headquarters in Halden, and was commanded by Major- General Carl Johan Erichsen. **1st Infantry Regiment (based in Fredrikstad) **2nd Infantry Regiment (based in Oslo) **3rd Infantry Regiment (based in Kongsberg) *2nd Division ‚Äì This division had its headquarters in Oslo, and was commanded by Major-General Jacob Hvinden Haug. **4th Infantry Regiment (based in Trandum) **5th Infantry Regiment (based in Elverum) **6th Infantry Regiment (based in H√∏nefoss) *3rd Division ‚Äì This division had its headquarters in Kristiansand, and was commanded by Major-General Einar Liljedahl. **7th Infantry Regiment (based in Kristiansand) **8th Infantry Regiment (based in Stavanger) *4th Division ‚Äì This division had its headquarters in Bergen, and was commanded by Major-General William Steffens. **9th Infantry Regiment (based in Bergen) **10th Infantry Regiment (based in Voss) *5th Division ‚Äì This division had its headquarters in Trondheim, and was commanded by Major- General Jacob Ager Laurantzon. **11th Infantry Regiment (based in √Öndalsnes) **12th Infantry Regiment (based in Trondheim) **13th Infantry Regiment (based in Steinkjer) *6th Division ‚Äì This division had its headquarters in Harstad, and was commanded by Major-General Carl Gustav Fleischer.

Biography Born in Norfolk, Virginia, Travis was a well-known drummer in the local music scene of a region known as Hampton Roads during the early 1980s. Playing with bands in clubs throughout Norfolk, Virginia Beach, and Newport News. Travis moved to California in the early to mid-1980s and performed in various local bands, such as Hawk, later moving on to perform for the critically acclaimed band Racer X, and very briefly performed in Saints Or Sinners, which later changed their name to The Scream, and also featured Travis's Racer X bandmates Bruce Bouillet and Juan Alderete. His big career move came about late in the decade after Judas Priest's longtime drummer Dave Holland left the band in 1989, citing personal reasons. Travis had always wanted to be the drummer of Judas Priest. As a teenager, he had often thought about setting up his drum kit in the parking lot at the Hampton Coliseum in hopes that the band would notice him as they went past with their tour bus. He finally decided to wait at the back of the arena to hand the band a tape of his playing. Holland was still the band's drummer at the time, so nothing ever came out of the encounter. When Holland did leave Judas Priest in 1989, vocalist Jeff Martin heard about it through his friendship with Rob Halford. Martin called up Travis one day and said, \\"Guess who needs a drummer.\\" Travis auditioned for the vacant position and became their new member, thus becoming the first non- Briton to perform for the band. He has been with the band ever since and also handles drum duties for Racer X as well. Travis also performed drums in Halford's band Fight from 1992 to 1995, but to date, he is best known for his work with Judas Priest, for which he has been widely acclaimed ever since his debut on the 1990 album Painkiller. Travis was largely responsible for hiring Tim 'Ripper' Owens as Halford's replacement in Judas Priest in 1996. Owens would remain in the band until the 2003 reunion with Halford. Travis takes credit as the co-writer for the song \\"Cyberface\\", which appears on Judas Priest's 2001 album Demolition, making it his first and only contribution in the band. In April 2016, Travis joined the reformed line-up of Thin Lizzy for reunion shows and has remained in the band as their official member. He is commonly mistaken to be left-handed. In reality, he is ambidextrous, and plays with an open style. He stands at 6'6\\". Equipment Travis always used Tama Drums until 2008. On the first leg of the Judas Priest \\"Nostradamus Tour\\" he played a Pearl kit and then switched to a DW kit for the second leg. He was also seen using a DW kit at the NAMM show with his band Racer X. His DW setup is: two 23\\"x24\\" bass drums, 14\\"x6.5\\" snare,8\\"x8\\" 10\\"x9\\" 12\\"x9\\" and 14\\"x10\\" rack toms and 16\\"x14\\" and 18\\"x16\\" floor toms. Travis has played Paiste cymbals since May 1987. He also plays Evans drum heads and uses Vater drumsticks.

Poppo was an extremely successful teacher and organizer, and in a few years doubled the number of pupils at the gymnasium.

It was written as a stand-alone novel, but could also be seen as a prequel to the Civil War trilogy written by Shaara and his father, Michael Shaara, introducing some of the key protagonists in the campaigns that first won them fame. The action begins with the Battle of Vera Cruz and follows Winfield Scott and his army as they march toward Mexico City, including the Battle of Cerro Gordo and culminating in the Battle of Chapultepec and the fall of Mexico City. Style Most of the story is told from the perspective of two men, Winfield Scott, commander of the American forces, and Robert E. Lee, who rose to prominence in the war, though some chapters also introduce the perspectives of other characters as well, notably Mexican leader Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, James Longstreet, Thomas Jackson, and Ulysses S. Grant. It is critical of certain American commanders, including William J. Worth, Gideon Pillow, and David E. Twiggs, portraying them as mostly incompetent soldiers, who were little more than political appointees, while the true heroes were the lower-ranking graduates of the United States Military Academy. This idealistic portrayal of the younger officers as they rose to prominence gives little indication that with just a few years they would meet again on the battlefield in the Civil War. Allusions The book glosses over the story of the Saint Patrick's Battalion, portraying the actions of Scott in a positive light. Notably, the book changes the hanging of the men during the storming of Chapultepec to one where the about to be hanged deserters cheer on the US Army and the presiding officer delays the hanging so the condemned men can see the outcome of the battle. In reality, Scott ordered the men to wait in the gallows until the United States flag was raised over the fort. The presiding officer also ordered a man with two amputated legs dragged to the gallows, commenting \\"Bring the damned son of a bitch out!

He stayed up at Cambridge and became a most successful coach. He had a great reputation as a Greek scholar, and was a somewhat acrimonious critic of rival scholars, especially Bishop Blomfield. Subsequently, he fell into embarrassed circumstances through injudicious speculation, and in 1841 a civil list pension of ¬£100 per annum was bestowed upon him. He died at Ramsgate, on 11 January 1864. Burges was a man of great learning and industry, but too fond of introducing arbitrary emendations into the text of classical authors.

While nominally part of the Famagusta District of the Republic of Cyprus, it has been under the de facto control of Northern Cyprus since the partition of the island in 1974. Rizokarpaso is one of the largest towns on the peninsula. Soil near the town consists of terra fusca which is very fertile. Local crops include carob, cotton, tobacco, and grain. The town's surroundings are famous as the wildest and one of the most unspoilt parts of the island. The municipality's territory features the Karpaz National Park, home to the Karpass donkey and some of the finest beaches of the island. The economy is primarily based on agriculture, husbandry and fisheries. Since 2000, the town has embraced the concept of eco-tourism and converted old traditional village houses into guesthouses in traditional styles. The area lacks any industrial plants. Geography =Climate= History Orthodox church and mosque in Dipkarpaz (Rizokarpaso) The Rizokarpaso area contains some of the earliest inhabited places in the island. These include the ancient cities of Karpasia and Aphendrika. It was the seat of one of the largest Lusignan baronies. The town has two churches: St. Synesios and the church of the Holy Trinity. They are examples of the typical Cypriot mixed style, combining features of the late Gothic introduced by the Lusignans with the late Byzantine style of the Orthodox tradition. When the island's Orthodox bishops were banished by the Lusignans in 1222, the Bishop of Famagusta was sent to Rizokarpaso and continued his work in St. Synesios, the main Orthodox church in the region. These are two of the few Christian churches to operate in the northern part of Cyprus, and has allegedly had services stopped by the Turkish Cypriot police.Turkish Cypriot ‚ÄòGrinches‚Äô Steal Christmas, Stop Holiday Liturgy Rizokarpaso is partly located in the ancient city of Karpasia on the West coast, according to legend founded by king Pygmalion.  Demographics  Before 1974, the town was predominantly inhabited by Greek- Cypriots. During the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus in 20 July 1974, the peninsula was cut off by Turkish troops, and this prevented the town's Greek-Cypriot inhabitants from fleeing to the south. As a result, with 250 Greek Cypriot inhabitants, Rizokarpaso is the home of the biggest Greek population in the North. Between 1974 and 1985, however, around 2500 Greek Cypriots left the village. Although the Greek-Cypriot population is now mainly elderly and shrinking in size, they are still supplied by the UN, and Greek-Cypriot products are consequently available in some places. In 1977, Turkish settlers were brought from different areas of Turkey, including Kars, Mu≈ü, Diyarbakƒ±r and Aƒürƒ± in the Eastern Anatolia Region, Mersin and Adana in the Mediterranean Region and Akku≈ü, √áar≈üamba, Ak√ßaabat, S√ºrmene, Araklƒ± and Trabzon in the Black Sea Region. In the 21st century, some Turkish Cypriots and Europeans also bought properties in the village and are now its residents.  Politics  The town has a Turkish Cypriot municipality, whose current mayor is Suphi Co≈ükun from the Republican Turkish Party. Co≈ükun won the post in 2014, by winning over 50% of the votes and beating his predecessor, Mehmet Demirci of the National Unity Party.

Life Blomfield was born at Bury St Edmunds, the second son of the six children of Charles Blomfield (1763‚Äì1831), a schoolmaster (as was E. V. Blomfield's grandfather, James Blomfield), JP and chief alderman of Bury St Edmunds, and his wife, Hester (1765‚Äì1844), daughter of Edward Pawsey, a Bury grocer. Edward acquired a high reputation for learning and general accomplishments, being a good modern linguist and draughtsman, as well as a brilliant scholar He was educated under Dr. Becher at the grammar school at Bury St Edmunds, and thence proceeded to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1807. In 1811, he took his B.A. degree, being placed thirteenth wrangler. He had, however, obtained such classical distinctions as were then open to competition ; he was Browne medallist in 1809 and 1810 (in the former year being beaten by one candidate, but receiving a prize of books from the vice-chancellor, Dr. Barnes), members' prizeman in 1812, and finally first chancellor's classical medallist The fellowships in his own college being full, he was elected to a classical lectureship and fellowship at Emmanuel College, which he retained till his death in 1816. He died from a fever contracted in a long vacation tour in Switzerland in that year. He managed, after being taken ill at Dover, to reach Cambridge, where he died on 3 Oct., and was buried in Emmanuel College Chapel ; in the cloisters of which is a tablet to his memory, with an inscription by his brother, Charles James. In 1813, he travelled to Germany and made the acquaintance of some of the great scholars of that country. On his return, he published in the Museum Criticum (No. ii), an interesting paper on \\"The Present State of Classical Literature in Germany.\\" He died in 1816, his early death depriving Cambridge of one who seemed destined to take a high place amongst her most brilliant classical scholars. Work His chief work was a translation of Matthiae's Greek Grammar, a book still unrivalled in its way. He had completed it in the spring of 1816, intending to furnish it with indexes, &c.;, in the autumn. It was left for his brother Charles James to edit, who prefixed to it a short essay on the virtues and learning of the translator. Edward had met with this book in the course of a tour in Germany, undertaken in 1813, as soon as the events of that year had opened the continent to English travellers. Another fruit of this tour was a paper in the Museum Criticum on \\"The State of Classical Literature in Germany,\\" a subject which had then become almost unknown in England. Besides a few other papers contributed to the ' Museum ' Blomfield had projected a Greek-English lexicon to take the place of the old Greek-Latin Lexicons of Scapula and Hedericus, which gave needless difficulty to students and were neither full nor accurate. He published a specimen of his Lexicon, which was well received, and his plans seem to have been rational and promising.

The second storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed from a tropical wave on August 3 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. After moving through the islands, its fast forward motion caused it to dissipate. However, it later regenerated into a tropical storm near Yucat√°n Peninsula. Bonnie attained peak winds of over the Gulf of Mexico, turned to the northeast, and hit Florida as a tropical storm. The storm accelerated to the northeast and became an extratropical cyclone to the east of New Jersey. Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems to make landfall on Florida in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, and the second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August. Bonnie's impact was minimal. Throughout the Caribbean Sea, the storm's effects consisted primarily of light rainfall, and in Florida, the precipitation caused flooding and minor damage. The tropical storm caused a tornado outbreak across the Southeastern United States which killed three people and inflicted over $1 million (2004 USD) in damage. Bonnie made landfall in Florida the day before Hurricane Charley struck.  Meteorological history  The origins of Bonnie were in a tropical wave that emerged from the coast of Africa on July 29 and entered the Atlantic Ocean. It moved westward, attaining convection and a mid-level circulation. Convection steadily increased, and, upon the development of a low-level circulation center, the system organized into Tropical Depression Two on August 3 while 415 miles (670 km) east of Barbados. It moved rapidly westward at speeds of up to 23 mph (37 km/h); after crossing through the Lesser Antilles on August 4, it degenerated back into a tropical wave. The tropical wave continued to move rapidly to the west-northwest, until it reached the western Caribbean Sea. While south of Cuba and through the Cayman Islands, the system slowed down to regenerate convection, and it re- developed into a tropical depression on August 8. Operationally, the system was classified a tropical wave until a day later. The depression moved through the Yucat√°n Channel, and intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie on August 9 while 70 miles (115 km) north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Bonnie to the north of Charley on August 12 Bonnie continued to the west-northwest; late on August 9, the storm presented a 9-mile (15-km) wide eyewall, a very unusual occurrence in a small and weak tropical storm. Bonnie quickly strengthened while turning to the north, a directional shift caused by a break in the mid-level ridge. The storm briefly weakened late on August 10; it re-strengthened again the following day to attain a peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h). Soon after, strong southwesterly wind shear disrupted the storm, causing Bonnie to weaken again. On August 12, Bonnie made landfall just south of Apalachicola as a 45 mph (75 km/h) tropical storm. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, and accelerated northeastward through the southeastern United States. After paralleling the Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina coastlines, Bonnie lost its tropical characteristics on August 14 to the east of New Jersey. Its remnant low continued northeastward, making landfall in Massachusetts and Maine and continuing into Atlantic Canada.  Preparations  About 16 hours before the storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, the government of Saint Lucia declared a tropical storm warning. Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands issued tropical storm watches. Combined with the threat of Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154 oil platforms and 32 oil rigs. The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2 million barrels of loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas reserves were also limited. The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico. Early forecasts suggested that Bonnie would attain 80 mph (130 km/h) winds or Category 1 status. In response to the threat, 15 shelters in 7 northwestern Florida counties were put on standby. In the hours prior to landfall,2 shelters were opened, 4 were put on standby, and health and cleanup teams were deployed to the area. Parts of Gadsden, Wakulla, and Levy Counties issued voluntary evacuations, and numerous schools were closed. In anticipation of the storm, Florida Governor Jeb Bush issued a state of emergency.  Impact  Bonnie was a weak storm through most of its path, dropping only light rainfall and causing minimal damage. South Carolina and North Carolina experienced the worst of the storm, where a tornado outbreak killed three people and caused moderate damage. = Caribbean Sea = As a tropical depression, the storm moved rapidly through the Lesser Antilles; consequently, most islands only experienced minor effects. For example, Saint Lucia received light and sporadic rain showers, accompanied by sustained winds of 20‚Äì25 mph (32‚Äì40 km/h) and gusts to 35 mph (55 km/h). In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, however, the depression dropped up to 9.2 inches (235 mm) of rain in 24 hours. The rainfall blocked storm drains, including those near the airport, which was forced to shut down. The rainfall caused debris to collect on roads throughout the island. Although the storm passed just 70 miles (110 km) north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, the storm dropped only 0.6 inches (15 mm) of rain due to its small size. = North America = Total rainfall map of Bonnie in the Eastern United States In Florida, Bonnie produced up to 4.1 inches (104 mm) of rainfall in Pace, with peak wind gusts of 42 mph (68 km/h). Bonnie was accompanied by a storm surge; moderate wave action caused slight beach erosion. Rainfall and storm surge flooded roads, forcing the evacuation of 2,000 residents in Taylor County. The winds downed trees and caused scattered power outages. A tornado in Jacksonville damaged several businesses and houses. Bonnie triggered a tornado outbreak throughout portions of the Mid- Atlantic states. One tornado in Pender County, North Carolina destroyed 17 homes and damaged 59 houses, causing three deaths and $1.27 million in damage (2004 USD). In Stella, Bonnie generated a waterspout that struck a campground, damaged nine trailers, and wrecked small boats. A tornado in Richlands damaged several houses as well. A suspected tornado in Danville, Virginia destroyed the roofs of several businesses. In South Carolina, tornadoes across the state damaged nine homes. Also, rainfall peaking at 6.07 inches (154 mm) in Loris caused flooding across the state. The flooding, including a one-foot depth along U.S. Route 501, washed away a road and a bridge in Greenville County. In addition, 600 people across the state were left without electricity. In Pennsylvania, the remnants of the storm dropped up to 8 inches (200 mm) of rain in Tannersville. The rainfall caused the Schuylkill River to reach a crest peak of 12.89 ft (4 m) at Berne. The flooding blocked several roads across eastern Pennsylvania. In addition, Bonnie produced gusty winds, leaving thousands without power. In Delaware, the storm dropped up to 4 inches (100 mm) of rain, forcing 100 to evacuate from the floodwaters. The flooding closed part of U.S. Route 13, and an overflown creek in New Castle County caused moderate flooding damage to stores. In Maine, moisture from the remnants of Bonnie produced heavy rainfall, with localized totals of up to 10 inches (250 mm). The rainfall flooded or washed out roads across the eastern portion of the state. In Aroostook County, near the town of St. Francis, the rainfall caused a mudslide which narrowed a county road to one lane. As an extratropical low combined with a frontal system, Bonnie continued to produce moderate rainfall in Canada, peaking at 3.5 inches (90 mm) in Edmundston, New Brunswick. The rainfall caused basement flooding and road washouts; slick roads caused a traffic fatality in Edmundston.  Aftermath and records  Twenty-two hours after Bonnie struck Florida, Hurricane Charley passed over the Dry Tortugas. This was the first time in recorded history that two tropical storms struck Florida within 1 day. Previously, Hurricane Gordon and Tropical Storm Helene struck the state within five days of each other in September 2000. Originally, it was thought that two storms in the 1906 season hit the state within 12 hours; however, the suspected tropical storm was determined to be a tropical depression in a more recent analysis. Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems to make landfall in Florida during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, and the second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August. Because Bonnie hit Florida immediately before Charley, damage between the two storms was often difficult to differentiate. President George W. Bush responded to the storm by declaring much of Florida a Federal Disaster Area on August 13, 2004.

D. Nixon, was an African-American civil rights leader and union organizer in Alabama who played a crucial role in organizing the landmark Montgomery bus boycott there in 1955. The boycott highlighted the issues of segregation in the South, was upheld for more than a year by black residents, and nearly brought the city- owned bus system to bankruptcy. It ended in December 1956, after the United States Supreme Court ruled in the related case, Browder v. Gayle (1956), that the local and state laws were unconstitutional, and ordered the state to end bus segregation. A longtime organizer and activist, Nixon was president of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Montgomery Welfare League, and the Montgomery Voters League. At the time, Nixon already led the Montgomery branch of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters union, known as the Pullman Porters Union, which he had helped organize. Martin Luther King Jr. described Nixon as \\"one of the chief voices of the Negro community in the area of civil rights,\\" and \\"a symbol of the hopes and aspirations of the long oppressed people of the State of Alabama.\\" Early life and education Edgar D. Nixon was born on July 12, 1899, in rural, majority-black Lowndes County, Alabama to Wesley M. Nixon and Sue Ann Chappell Nixon. As a child, Nixon received 16 months of formal education, as black students were ill-served in the segregated public school system. His mother died when he was young, and he and his seven siblings were reared among extended family in Montgomery. His father was a Baptist minister.Nixon, Edgar Daniel (1899‚Äì1987), King Encyclopedia Online, accessed 3 December 2019. After working in a train station baggage room, Nixon rose to become a Pullman car porter, which was a well-respected position with good pay. He was able to travel around the country and worked steadily. He worked with them until 1964. In 1928, he joined the new union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, helping organize its branch in Montgomery. He also served as its president for many years. Marriage and family Nixon married Alease (who died in 1934), and they had a son, E. D. Nixon, Jr. (1928‚Äì2011). He became an actor known by the stage name of Nick La Tour. Nixon later married Arlette Nixon, who was with him during many of the civil rights events. Civil rights activism Years before the bus boycott, Nixon had worked for voting rights and civil rights for African Americans in Montgomery. Like other blacks in the state, they had been essentially disenfranchised since the start of the 20th century by changes in the Alabama state constitution and electoral laws. He also served as an unelected advocate for the African-American community, helping individuals negotiate with white office holders, policemen, and civil servants. Nixon joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), becoming president of the Montgomery chapter and, within two years, president of the state organization.\\"E.D. Nixon\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama, accessed 28 August 2016. In 1940, Nixon organized 750 African Americans to march to the Montgomery County courthouse and attempt to register to vote. They were unsuccessful, as the white Democrats used subjective rules to exclude them. In 1954, he was the first black to run for a seat on the county Democratic Executive Committee. The next year, he questioned the Democratic candidates for the Montgomery City Commission on their positions on civil rights issues. Challenging bus segregation In the early 1950s, Nixon and Jo Ann Robinson, president of the Women's Political Council, decided to mount a court challenge to the discriminatory seating practices on Montgomery's municipal buses, along with a boycott of the bus company. A Montgomery ordinance reserved the front seats on these buses for white passengers only, forcing African-American riders to sit in the back. The middle section was available to blacks unless the bus became so crowded that white passengers were standing; in that case, blacks were supposed to give up their seats and stand if necessary. Blacks constituted the majority of riders on the city-owned bus system. Before the activists could mount the court challenge, they needed someone to voluntarily violate the bus seating law and be arrested for it. Nixon carefully searched for a suitable plaintiff. At the same time, some women mounted their own individual challenges. For instance, 15-year-old student Claudette Colvin was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger in March 1955, nine months before Parks' action. Nixon rejected Colvin because she became an unwed mother, another woman who was arrested because he did not believe she had the fortitude to see the case through, and a third woman, Mary Louise Smith, because her father was allegedly an alcoholic. (In 1956, Colvin and Smith were among five originally included in the successful case, Browder v. Gayle, filed on behalf of them specifically and representing black riders who had been treated unjustly on the city buses.) See below.) The final choice was Rosa Parks, the elected secretary of the Montgomery NAACP. Nixon had been her boss, although he said, \\"Women don't need to be nowhere but in the kitchen.\\" When she asked, \\"Well, what about me?\\", he replied, \\"I need a secretary and you are a good one.\\" On December 1, 1955, Parks entered a Montgomery bus, refused to give up her seat for a white passenger, and was arrested. After being called about Parks' arrest, Nixon went to bail her out of jail. He arranged for Parks' friend, Clifford Durr, a sympathetic white lawyer, to represent her. After years of working with Parks, Nixon was certain that she was the ideal candidate to challenge the discriminatory seating policy. Even so, Nixon had to persuade Parks to lead the fight. After consulting with her mother and husband, Parks accepted the challenge. Organizing the boycott After Parks' arrest, Nixon called a number of local ministers to organize support for the boycott; the third man he called was Martin Luther King Jr., a young minister who was newly arrived from Atlanta, Georgia. King said he would think about it and call back. When King responded, he said that he would participate in the boycott and had already arranged a meeting of his church congregation on the issue. Nixon could not attend because of an out-of-town business trip; he took precautions to see that no one was elected to lead the boycott campaign until he returned. When Nixon returned to Montgomery, he met with Rev. Ralph David Abernathy and Rev. E.N. French to plan the program for the next boycott meeting. They came up with a list of demands for the bus company, named the new organization the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), and discussed candidates for president of the association. Nixon recommended King to Abernathy and French because Nixon believed that King had not been compromised by dealing with the local white power structure. After a successful one-day bus boycott on December 5, 1955, Nixon met with a group of ministers to plan the larger boycott. But, the meeting did not proceed as he had envisioned. The ministers wanted to organize a low-key boycott that would not upset the white power structure in Montgomery. This was completely opposite of what Nixon and the other activists hoped to achieve. An exasperated Nixon threatened to publicly denounce the ministers as cowards. King stood and said that he was no coward. By the end of the meeting, he had accepted the MIA presidency and Nixon had become the treasurer. That evening, King delivered a keynote address to the full meeting at Holt Street Baptist Church.Montgomery Bus Boycott speech, at Holt Street Baptist Church (5 December 1955) Nixon shared his labor and civil rights contacts with the MIA, organizing financial and other resources to help manage and support the boycott. These were critical to its success. Successful boycott What was expected to be a short boycott lasted 381 days, more than one year. Despite fierce political opposition, police coercion, personal threats, and their own sacrifices, the blacks of Montgomery held the boycott. They walked to work; the people with cars gave others rides. They gave up some trips. Bus ridership plummeted, as blacks were the majority riders in the system, and the bus company was on the verge of financial ruin. In late January a bomb was set off near the home of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and on February 1, 1956, a bomb exploded in front of Nixon's home. Attorneys Fred Gray and Charles Langford filed the petition in federal district court for it to review the state and city laws on bus segregation in the case that became known as Browder v. Gayle (1956). They filed on behalf of the five Montgomery women who originally refused to give up their seats on city buses: Claudette Colvin, Aurelia S. Browder, Susie McDonald, Mary Louise Smith, and Jeanatte Reese. (Reese withdrew from the case in February.) On June 5, 1956, a three-judge panel of the US District Court ruled on Browder v. Gayle and determined that Montgomery's segregation law was unconstitutional, violating the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution.\\"Browder v. Gayle, 352 U.S. 903 (1956)\\", Martin Luther King, Jr. Encyclopedia, accessed 3 December 2019. On November 13, 1956, the US Supreme Court upheld the lower court's ruling. On December 17, 1956, the Supreme Court rejected appeals by the city and state to reconsider its decision. Three days later, the Supreme Court issued its order for Montgomery to desegregate its buses. With that legal victory, the MIA organizers ended the boycott. At a later rally at New York City's Madison Square Garden, Nixon talked about the symbolism of the boycott to an audience of supporters: > I'm from Montgomery, Alabama, a city that's known as the Cradle of the > Confederacy, that had stood still for more than ninety-three years until > Rosa L. Parks was arrested and thrown in jail like a common criminal.... > Fifty thousand people rose up and caught hold to the Cradle of the > Confederacy and began to rock it till the Jim Crow rockers began to reel and > the segregated slats began to fall out. After the boycott Nixon's relationship with the MIA was contentious. He frequently had sharp disagreements with others in the group and competed for leadership. He expressed resentment that King and Abernathy had received most of the credit for the boycott, as opposed to the local activists who had already spent years organizing against racism. However, King admired Nixon, describing him as \\"one of the chief voices of the Negro community in the area of civil rights,\\" and \\"a symbol of the hopes and aspirations of the long oppressed people of the State of Alabama.\\" Nixon resigned his post as MIA treasurer in 1957, writing a bitter letter to King complaining that he had been treated as a child and a \\"newcomer.\\" Nixon continued to feud with Montgomery's Black middle class community for the next decade. By the late 1960s, through a series of political defeats, his leadership role in the MIA was eliminated. After retiring from the railroad, Nixon worked as the recreation director of a public housing project. He continued to work for civil rights, especially to improve housing and education for blacks in Montgomery. Nixon died at the age of 87 in Montgomery on February 25, 1987.

The Vatican tasks Father Lucci with investigating these events, though Lucci advises that they are all either hoaxes or have scientific explanations. Concurrently to this, Abby Quinn, a pregnant woman living in California, prepares for the birth of her child. Her husband, Russell, is a defense lawyer representing Jimmy Szaragosa, a man with Down syndrome, who is on trial for murdering his incestuous parents and claiming that he did so because of God's teaching. Jimmy is convicted of the crime. For additional income, Abby and Russell rent a room to the mysterious traveler, who identifies himself as David Bannon. Soon after, Abby begins to have terrible nightmares of a man resembling David being struck down by a soldier, who then asks \\"would you die for him?\\" of her. Abby also learns of the apocalyptic signs that have occurred, and combined with her nightmares and David's suspicious behavior, she begins to worry that something terrible is taking place. She snoops through David's papers and discovers an ancient note that leads her to believe that he intends to harm her child. When Abby confronts David about this, he tells her that God's grace is empty and soon, no souls will remain to be given to newborn people. Abby panics and stabs David, only for him to shrug off the injury and claim that he \\"cannot die again.\\" It becomes apparent that he is actually the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Abby's nightmares are visions of his original crucifixion, and she is the reincarnation of Seraphia, the woman who offered Jesus water only to be turned away by Cartaphilus, who was Pilate's porter who struck Jesus. The signs of the apocalypse continue to unfold and eventually cause a giant storm. Abby connects with Avi, a rabbinical student who helps her understand the events. Father Lucci, who has come to California as part of his investigation, finds her and hears her concerns. However, while meeting with Lucci, Abby spots a ring on his finger identical to the one that Cartaphilus wore and learns that Lucci is Cartaphilus himself who was cursed to wander the Earth until Christ's return to judge humanity. He intends to allow the apocalypse to take place so that his curse will finally be broken. Abby flees from Lucci with Avi's aid, and together the two of them find a Bible to learn what will happen next. They discover that the sixth sign will be a solar eclipse that will take place the next day, meaning that the fifth sign ‚Äî the tortured death of a martyr for God's cause ‚Äî must take place very soon. Abby realizes that clemency has been denied to Jimmy and his execution will be the fifth sign. In a panic, she drives to the prison to stop the execution; however, Lucci has already infiltrated the prison. As Abby approaches, Lucci kills Jimmy and wounds Abby and is taken away by the guards. The eclipse begins along with a catastrophic earthquake. Despondent over her failure to save Jimmy and the rest of humanity, Abby goes into labor and is rushed through the disaster to a nearby hospital. Despite the best efforts of Russell and the doctors to help her, the child's heart stops beating as Abby gives birth, thus fulfilling the seventh and final sign, the birth of the soulless child. However, Abby has another vision of her past as Seraphia and remembers Cartaphilus' question. Finally finding true hope, Abby answers the question in the affirmative‚Äî\\"I will die for him\\"‚Äîand reaches out to her child, who revives and holds her finger. Her soul is thus transferred to the child, saving him at the cost of her own life. This act of faith ends the apocalypse. Jesus appears in the hospital and tells Russell that Abby's sacrifice has refilled the Hall of Souls, ensuring that humanity will continue to survive.

Life His father George Christian Anthon was a German-American medical doctor who served in the British Army during the American Revolution until the surrender of Detroit in 1796. George attained the rank of surgeon general, resigned, married the daughter of a French officer, and settled in New York City. Charles was born there on November 19, 1797, graduated with honors from Columbia College in 1815, and, after studying law, was called to the bar in 1819. He never practiced. Instead, the next year, he was appointed assistant professor of Greek and Latin at his old college. In 1830, he was made a full professor and become the headmaster of the Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School. In 1835, he succeeded to the chair of Professor Morse. He retired from the grammar school in 1864 and died in New York on July 29, 1867. Works He produced a large number of classical works for use in colleges and schools, which enjoyed great popularity, although schoolmasters themselves sometimes disliked their use by students, owing to the large amount of assistance and translations contained in the notes. He also wrote A Manual of Greek Literature from the Earliest Authentic Periods to the Close of Byzantine Era providing a list of all Greek writers in that period, with a summary of their life and works and a bibliography of editions then in use. The overview is still useful today, but outdated. His intention to provide a similar volume for Latin literature was never fulfilled. Dr. Anthon's work was carried on by his successor, Henry Drisler. Anthon Transcript Charles Anthon is famous in connection with the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints because of his interactions with Martin Harris concerning a fragment of Joseph Smith's translation of the Book of Mormon. The fragment was later known as the Anthon Transcript. According to Harris, Anthon wrote Harris a letter of authenticity declaring the fragment to contain true Egyptian characters. Anthon was also reported to have confirmed the translation of these characters as correct. When informed that an angel of God had revealed the characters to Joseph Smith, Anthon reportedly tore up the authentication stating that there was no such thing as angels and asked Harris to bring the plates to him for translation. Martin Harris went to Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill afterwards and received a letter of authenticity from him.‚ÄúRead This I Pray Thee‚Äù: Martin Harris and the Three Wise Men of the East Richard E.

McBride. 3 January 2013. https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/revelations-in-context/the- contributions-of-martin-harris?lang=eng Anthon, however, disagreed with Harris' version of their encounter and stated in a letter to a Mr. E.D. Howe on February 17, 1834, that the story of Anthon's authentication was false, that Anthon had identified the writings as a hoax, and that Anthon had told Harris that the writings were part of \\"a scheme to cheat the farmer [Martin Harris] of his money....\\"So What's the Difference?, p. 154-156, Fritz Ridenour, ed., Regal Books (1973). Acquaintance with Poe Dr. Anthon was a friend and correspondent of Edgar Allan Poe, who attempted to use their acquaintance to gain a national reputation in literature and journalism as well as publication in 1845 of his collected stories through Harper and Brothers. This was, at the time, unsuccessful due to a doubtful accusation of plagiarism against Poe; however Poe went on to establish himself in the first rank of American letters.

When the BSP and LSSP fused in 1950, Gunawardena split to form VLSSP. In 1952 VLSSP entered into an electoral alliance with the Communist Party. In the parliamentary elections that year, VLSSP won one seat (represented by Gunawardena's wife, Kusumasiri Gunawardena). Philip Gunawardena lead the Viplavakari Lanka Sama Samaja Party (VLSSP) since 1951 and as constituent party formed the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP, Peoples‚Äô United Front) in 1956 under the leadership of Mr.SWRD Bandaranaike to form the first people‚Äôs government in 1956 General Election. At that election, VLSSP won five seats in the parliament as part of MEP. Philip Gunawardena became the Minister of Agriculture, Food, & Co-operatives and his party colleague P. J. William de Silva became the Minister of Fisheries & Industries. They served as a key members of the Cabinet of SWRD Bandaranaike. But the presence of the leftist VLSSP in the government irritated the rightist sections of SLFP, who maneuvered VLSSP out through a series of intrigues. MEP fell apart and the government was defeated. In 1959 VLSSP was disbanded and Gunawardena reorganized his party with the name Mahajana Eksath Peramuna. His new party was however not a Trotskyist formation. VLSSP should not be confused with Lanka Sama Samaja Party (Revolutionary), which was a later splinter group of LSSP.

Anstey\\", first published in 1882. The title originates from the Latin phrase, \\"vice versa\\", meaning \\"the other way around\\". Plot summary Set in contemporary Victorian times, the novel concerns businessman Paul Bultitude and his son Dick. Dick is about to leave home to return to a boarding school run by the cane-wielding headmaster, Dr. Grimstone. Bultitude, seeing his son's fear of returning to school, asserts that schooldays are the best years of a boy's life, and how he wishes he were the one going. At this point, thanks to a magic stone brought by an uncle from India which grants the possessor one wish, the father becomes a boy identical to the son. They are now on even terms. Dick, holding the stone, is ordered by his father to return him to his own body, but Dick refuses, and decides instead to become a man identical to how his father looked before the change. Mr Bultitude has to begin the new term at his son's boarding school, while Dick gets a chance to run his father's business in the City. In the end, both are restored to their own bodies, with a better understanding of each other. Adaptations =Play= In 1883, playwright Edward Rose adapted the story as a stage play, also titled Vice Versa. =Radio= The BBC made a six-part radio series in 1947, adapted and produced by Felix Felton. Paul Bultitude was played by Ronald Simpson, and his mischievous son Dick by John Clark. Dr. Grimstone was played by veteran radio actor Ralph Truman. An early example of creative sound effects before the days of tape meant that when the father succeeds in his wish to be just like his son going off to school, juvenile actor John Clark had to talk to himself. So he had to pre-record the father's dialogue on the 15 inch disks used at that time, and leave gaps for the son's character to speak. After much careful rehearsal, the broadcast went out live, with naturalistic speech overlaps. =Film and television= The story has also been adapted for television at least once, and for film at least four times. The 1948 British film was written and directed by Peter Ustinov, and starred Roger Livesey as Paul Bultitude and Anthony Newley (fresh from the Italia Conti Academy) as Dick. John Clark, who had played Dick in the radio adaptation, was initially auditioned and cast by Ustinov, with a seven-year Rank contract. However, his agent had overlooked a clause in his Just William theatre contract, which gave an option for the tour to be repeated across England for another year. Newley was therefore cast in his place. The 1981 ITV adaptation featured Peter Bowles as Paul Bultitude. The 1988 film version, adapted into a modern setting, starring Judge Reinhold and Fred Savage as the father and son. It did not credit F. Anstey's novel as its source in its initial release, but retained the title. Allusions/references from other works The novels Freaky Friday and Summer Switch by Mary Rodgers are modern re-tellings of the same story. Mr. Bultitude (but not the name of the novel) is mentioned in The Gold Bat by P.G. Wodehouse, in the first paragraph of Chapter XII. Mr. Bultitude is also the name of the tame bear (the last of the Seven Bears of Logres) in the third book of C. S. Lewis' science fiction trilogy, That Hideous Strength.

Background Lev Gleason Publications, founded by Leverett Gleason in 1939,Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas [4 volumes] by M. Keith Booker, p. 163 was based in Manhattan, New York City, and was among the first to produce comic books aimed at an adult audience. He labeled some of his books \\"illustories\\" to suggest that they were a new, different form. Gleason began his career in 1931 as an artist and advertising director for Open Road for Boys magazine. from 1932 to circa 1934, he served as advertising manager under Harry Wildenberg at Eastern Color Printing, a printer that became a comics-publishing pioneer in 1933 with the first American comic books. Becoming an editor at the newspaper syndicate United Feature, Gleason in 1936 launched the early comic book Tip Top Comics, which ran through 1938. He later became business manager at publisher Dan Gilmor's company Your Guide Publications, Inc., which was affiliated with Gilmor's Friday, Inc. and New Friday, Inc.Lev Gleason: Your Guide Publications, Inc.

Under the imprint Comic House Inc., Gleason continued the numbering of Silver Streak Comics with a crime comic, Crime Does Not Pay, which premiered with issue #22 (cover-dated July 1942).Crime Does Not Pay (Lev Gleason, 1942 Series) at the Grand Comics Database Also that year, Gleason briefly published the left-wing political magazine Reader's Choice. The first and most successful crime comic, Crime Does Not Pay spawned dozens of imitators. Gleason's crime titles (along with horror titles produced by EC Comics) became targets of increasing criticism of the influence of comic books. This pressure led to the formation in 1948 of the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers (ACMP) in an effort to avoid external regulation. Gleason was a founding member. The ACMP was the first step toward the establishment of the Comics Code Authority in 1954.

Literary critics Adelina Angusheva and Galin Tihanov called him \\"arguably the most significant voice of Bulgarian literature in the last third of the 20th century\\". Some literary critics have referred to him as the Bulgarian Kafka or Gogol. Radichkov is widely known for his numerous short stories, novels and plays. He is also known for the screenplays of the Bulgarian film classics Torrid Noon (1966) directed by Zako Heskiya, The Tied Up Balloon (1967) and The Last Summer (1974). In 2000, Radichkov was decorated with the high government prize the Order of the Balkan Mountains.Yordan Radichkov biography In 2007, a monument dedicated to him was officially opened at the garden of the former Royal Palace, nowadays National Art Gallery in Sofia city centre.The monument dedicated to Radichkov Early life He was born as Yordan Dimitrov Radichkov on 24 October 1929 in a poor family in the village of Kalimanitza, Montana Province, Bulgaria. In 1947, he graduated from the high school in the town of Berkovitsa.Yordan Radichkov web page Radichkov began his career in 1951 as Vratsa regional correspondent for the Narodna mladezh (National Youth) newspaper and editor (1952‚Äì1954) for the same paper. Between 1954 and 1960, he worked as editor for Vecherni Novini (Evening News) paper. Writing career Radichkov's literary career began as he started writing short stories for the Vecherni novini (Evening News) newspaper and his early collections caught the attention of readers and critics. In 1959, he published his first full-length book, Sarczeto bie za horata (The Heart Beats for the People), followed by Prosti rutse (Simple Hands, 1961) and Oburnato nebe (A Sky Turned Upside Down, 1962), all written in the socialist-realist official style. This romantic style was gradually replaced by a style of parody and the grotesque, with an increase in folkloristic elements, including folk fantasy and humor. Radichkov began parodying styles and reality: his works deprived objects of their natural dimensions and took them out of context; he combined disparate genres and transformed reality into a comic theater, defusing absurd aspects of life by means of laughter. A mixture of the fantastic and the real, Radichkov's works combined images of industrial civilisation with those of a remote mythical past, and were sometimes defined as a Balkan magic realism. His parodic style was initially met with animosity from the ruling Communist party (he was often accused of primitivism, escapism and dark agnosticism). Much of his writing (prose and plays) draws on characters and the ethnography of his native North- West Bulgaria. The fact that his own village Kalimaniza was destroyed and it site is currently under the waters of the \\"Ogosta\\" dam (1983) became a recurring theme in his writing and another metaphor for the detachedness of the \\"modern\\" world from the one to which Radichkov brings his readers in his reminiscings. Another major theme of his writing is nature and wildlife. In his prose he makes a masterful use of the often chaotic and irrational manner villagers and hunters narrate stories. Over the years Radichkov has gained popularity and recognition in Bulgaria and the international community, including a Nobel Prize nomination. Radichkov's 1966 script for the film Goreshto pladne (Hot Noon) was a story about humanity's efforts to save a trapped boy from drowning in a surging river and was a huge success for the writer. Baruten bukvar (Gunpowder Primer), his 1969 novel, was the first in his homeland to talk about socialism through a powerful blend of profanity, fantasy and folkloric wisdom rather than simple idealization. The award- winning Posledno liato (The Last Summer, 1974) is a parable of a man trying desperately to stay faithful to his own identity in a dynamically changing world. He also wrote a number of domestically and internationally acclaimed children's books. Of these Nie Vrabchetata (We, the Sparrows) has gained particular popularity in Bulgaria. Radichkov often illustrated his works with his own abstract drawings that have become another hallmark of his artistic presence. Radichkov is particularly famous for his language and his use of dialectisms. Critics have stated that \\"the real main character in the work of Radichkov is the word\\". Probably the greatest manifestation of Radichkov's impact on Bulgarian culture is the fact that his work introduced a number of neologisms and expressions in the every-day Bulgarian language. Awards and public recognition Radichkov has been awarded a wide number of awards for literature, theatre, and film, both in his homeland and abroad, among them the Order of Stara Planina (the highest order of Bulgaria, 2003), the Italian Grinzane Cavour Prize (1984) and the prize of the International Academy of the Arts in Paris (1993). A founding member, and first president (1984‚Äì1991) of the Bulgarian-Swedish Association for Friendship, he received the Swedish national Order of the Polar Star (1988). He was a prominent figure in Bulgaria's public life ‚Äì a member of the Union of Bulgarian Writers since 1962, he was elected MP for the Bulgarian Socialist Party in 2001, but quickly resigned in disagreement and spent the last years of his life increasingly withdrawn from politics.

The organization is given state-level recognition by the Democratic National Committee. Democrats Abroad currently has members in more than 190 countries, with more than 41 organized country committees. There are committees in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Oceania. These committees are formally represented by the Democratic Party Committee Abroad (DPCA). Some countries with particularly large concentrations of Democratic expatriates even have local chapters. Young Democrats Abroad represents Democrats Abroad in the functions of the Young Democrats of America. Voting from abroad One of the prime functions of Democrats Abroad is to assist U.S. citizens abroad in voter registration. To this end, it has created the website VoteFromAbroad.org which overseas Americans (Democrats and non-members alike) can use to register to vote. Since Presidents and members of Congress are elected by state, Americans abroad vote in the state in which they have most recently lived, each of which has its own registration and voting procedures. The votefromabroad.org website asks voters which state they last lived in and then starts a wizard specific to their state that asks for the information necessary to comply with the election laws of that state. After all the information has been supplied, a PDF is created, which the voter can then print, sign, and mail to the address provided (or sometimes fax, or scan and attach to email). Online voter registration is offered in Arizona (2002),EZ Voter Registration: Arizona's online voter registration system Washington (2008) and 29 other states as of June 2016 Several weeks before the election, the Board of Elections or County Registrar (states use various names) sends the voter an absentee ballot which the voter then fills out and sends back in order to cast his or her vote. Activities In addition to helping Americans living overseas to register to vote, Democrats Abroad engages in many other activities, mostly on a per country or per locality basis. Among other things, Democrats Abroad: *Provides help where there are problems with absentee ballots *Organizes lectures, debates, and other events on political topics, often with guest speakers *Strengthens contact between American ambassadors and consuls and overseas Americans *Lobbies Congress on expatriate issues (e.g. citizenship for children born abroad etc.) *Represents Americans abroad in the Democratic National Committee *Raises funds for the Democratic Party *Runs a website containing news for Americans abroad Leadership Democrats Abroad has eight officers. All of them are elected. Officers include: *International Chair ‚Äì Julia Bryan *International Vice Chair ‚Äì Alexander Montgomery *International Treasurer ‚Äì Lissette Wright *International Secretary ‚Äì Jeffrey Cheng *International Counsel ‚Äì Joe Smallhoover *Regional Vice Chair for the Americas ‚Äì Kathy Rothschild *Regional Vice Chair for Asia/Pacific ‚Äì Kat Allikian *Regional Vice Chair for Europe, Middle East and Africa ‚Äì Will Bakker Democrats Abroad is represented on the Democratic National Committee by eight members. The International Chair and Vice Chair are ex-officio members of the DNC. Various country committees of Democrats Abroad have local caucuses representing groups such as Young Democrats, minorities, women, and the LGBT community. History Democrats Abroad was started with two small committees in London and Paris after Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater in the 1964 U.S. presidential election. Its original leaders, Toby Hyde and Al Davidson, raised funds and formed committees, and pushed for state-level recognition of Democrats Abroad. DNC Chairman John Bailey allowed Democrats Abroad to send nine non-voting representatives to the Democratic National Convention in 1972; in 1976, the group was granted the status of a state committee, with voting delegates in the Convention. Over the years, Democrats Abroad has worked for securing the full citizenship rights for Americans living abroad. In particular, the group worked for overseas voting rights issues, supporting the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act in 1986, and the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot. Democrats Abroad switched the method of determining convention delegates from a primary to an open caucus in 1992. In 2008, Democrats Abroad switched back to a primary process. Former President Jimmy Carter is the current and first ever honorary chair of Democrats Abroad.http://www.democratsabroad.org/videos/carter Primaries Democrats Abroad sends a delegation to the Democratic National Convention every four years and has done so since 1976.

FDS) is a cigarette producer with headquarters in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. History The Sarajevo Tobacco Factory was founded in 1880, only two years after the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1878. FDS was one of the first four industries in Bosnia and Herzegovina. For eighty years, FDS was located in Marijin Dvor, nowadays a center of the city. At its founding, FDS consisted of only two buildings, production and administration. As production grew, the FDS complex became larger. It was finally formed in 1891, when the last of ten buildings was constructed. This situation remained until the middle of the last century. As the complex of FDS became larger, the number of employees also increased. In that early stage, it was mostly unskilled female labor. The first products of FDS were the cut tobacco packets produced manually in the device called ‚Äúavan‚Äù. Tobacco used for these packets was of a different grade, and the packets were also different. During the Austro- Hungarian period, this product was exported. The production of cigarettes started in 1882. They were produced manually until 1905 when the first automatic cigarette maker was obtained. By the beginning of World War I, FDS marketed 23 brands. They were packed in boxes made of wood, tin and cardboard. The smallest packet contained five and the largest one hundred cigarettes. FDS stagnated between the two world wars, specially in respect to its equipment. Still, during that period 55 different machines were provided, some of them intended for fabrication of the cut tobacco packets and cigarettes and the rest were machine tools for the workshop. The production and packing of the cut tobacco and several brands of oval and round cigarettes continued also in this period. Cigarettes were packed in packets of 100 and even 500. At the very beginning of the World War II the cut tobacco production decreased due to lower market demand. In this period, cigarette production also varied from year to year. During the war, FDS did not stop production, but it was dictated by the occupier. Ever since its foundation, for more than one century now, FDS has experienced many turbulent periods caused by the change of government and different social and political systems, but it has never stopped operating and producing. FDS achieved success, not only in the market of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also abroad including Egypt, Russia, Turkey and Japan. The need to extend and modernize the existing facilities resulted in a decision to construct a new factory complex in 1960. The new factory was built in the Pofaliƒái area, occupying approximately 40 000 m¬≤. The complex consisted of several buildings and reached its final appearance in 1971, when the construction was completed. Construction was completely financed by the employees of FDS, setting a precedent at that time and in such an environment. The policy of FDS was to rely on its own labor. In 1946, the first machine (an automatic carton cutting machine) was constructed. Those machines, invented and constructed by the employees of FDS, were used in FDS and also sold to other companies in the former Yugoslavia. The machines designed in FDS, among others, are Glibo I, Glibo II, Glibo III, Glibo IV and Glibo V. Today, the machines are primarily important as museum pieces, as they indicate the technological process in the factory. The period from 1971 is characterized by the modernization activities. New, modern equipment was provided intended to meet new technologies in the production of cigarettes. In that way the factory became one of the most modern tobacco plants in Europe and a leader in the area of former Yugoslavia. All the activities intended for the upgrade of the production process and education of the employees resulted in the signing of a contract with the world known company Philip Morris to make Marlboro cigarettes in 1970. Implementation of this contract started in 1971 and was successful until 1992, when it was broken up due to the war. In the history of FDS, several periods may be identified. The first was the Austro-Hungarian period, when the Factory operated to meet the requirements of the ruling Austro-Hungarian authorities. The second is the period of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, when the Factory considerably stagnated due to the monopolistic treatment by authorities from Belgrade. The third important period is after the Second World War, when FDS recorded very good business results regardless of frequent unfavorable working conditions. During this period, which lasted for almost fifty years, FDS became materially a very strong factory and employed highly skilled workers who managed to keep up with European and world trends in the tobacco industry. The most difficult period for FDS was the war time, from 1992 to 1995. Although severely damaged, FDS did not stop production. Brands The brands produced by FDS until now are: Damen, Hercegovina, Bosna, Guslar, Drina, Sarajevo, Mostar, Neretva, ≈†tefanija, Foƒça, Flor, Vrbas, Morava, Sarajka, Start, Sutjestka, Zeta, Internacional, Ibar, Drava, Morava-crvena, Drina-denifine, Lara, Skend, Marlboro, Bond, Alfa, Sedef, Specijal, Wind, Bosnae, Drina jedina bijela, Drina jedina bijela, Drina jedina zlatna, Drina lights, Drina super lights, AurA extra, AurA lights, AurA super lights, Tigra medium, Multi Nova, Code and 8 (Eight).

These machines are usually found sited in pubs, bars and other places of entertainment. The term quiz machine is often used interchangeably with the trade term SWP (skill with prize) although not all SWP games are quiz based.  History  The quiz machine first appeared on the scene in the UK in 1985. The first such machine was called Quizmaster which was made by the Cardiff based now defunct Coinmaster Ltd. This was rapidly followed by quiz machines from other manufacturers. Over the following years quiz machines/SWP's became a regular feature of the British pub. Leading SWP manufacturers of the 1980s and 1990s were: Coinmaster, JPM, Barcrest, Bell- Fruit, Maygay and Ace-Coin. The themes of many SWP games were (and still are) based on popular TV quiz shows, board games or other aspects of popular culture. Initially quiz machines were 20p play offering a ¬£10 maximum prize per play. This was increased to ¬£12 in 1988 and ¬£20 around 1991. Appearing in 1994 JPM's Monopoly SWP was the first 50p play machine. It was also the first machine to use touch screen technology instead of buttons. In the late 1990s a few quiz machines/SWPs offered ¬£40 jackpots. Although many new quiz machines during this period actually offered lower jackpot prizes such as ¬£5, and had gameplays and payout structures that seemed designed to frustrate professional players. In 2000 the quiz machine market reached new highs in player participation with the arrival of the highly popular Who Wants To Be A Millionaire quiz machine.  Professional quiz machine players  The arrival on the scene in 1985 of SWP/quiz machines quickly led to the existence of a cohort of professional and semi-professional players. These were people who became highly skilled on particular games being able to learn and memorise nearly entire question sets for a particular machine. They could then make substantial incomes from touring many different quiz machine locations and extracting money from the particular types of machine in which they were skilled. Over the years the size of quiz machine question sets has steadily increased, with the extensive use of \\"spoiler\\" questions to make large multiple wins difficult or impossible. Since the mid-1990s gameplay formats have also become a lot less \\"Pro\\" friendly. Today it is still possible for very skilled players to make worthwhile money playing SWPs, but it is much harder than in the past.  The quiz machine/SWP today  A fundamental change occurred in the nature of SWPs in the early 2000s. Single games in stand-alone cabinets were discontinued and replaced by multi-game terminals. Some of these can run a choice of up to 25-30 different games on the same machine. Some are also able to provide services other than gaming. These units can be managed and updated remotely through an ISDN or ADSL network connection. Leading multigame terminals and their manufacturers at present are: * itbox made by Maygay Ltd and originally used exclusively by Leisure Link, all machines are now owned by GamesTec. * FatBox Slim made by Fat Spanner * Ind:e and Indego made by GamesMedia/Channel1 * Gamesnet made by GamesTec Today most SWP/quiz machine games offer a nominal ¬£20 jackpot for 50p play and a few offer ¬£40 for ¬£1 play. But on present day games the payout is carefully controlled and manipulated by the software. Payout levels are set at lower levels than previously.  Legal grey areas  An SWP machine must offer the chance to win the jackpot on every game; however, the level of skill involved to do that is set so high as to be virtually impossible. Manufacturers have, at times, set the skill level so high that it is physically impossible to achieve this. Because there is no governing body for skill games, the only time this is brought into question is when the gaming authorities are alerted and take court action to prove or disprove that this is the case. In practice, this is very rare, as the gaming authorities have no jurisdiction over skill machines, and the only way for a prosecution to succeed is to prove that the game in question breaks the law in some way. This can be done by proving that the machine differs to the legal definition of a skill machine which says that a player must be allowed to win prizes by skill alone. If there is an element of luck in the game it is automatically classed as a game of chance and is legally bound by the gambling commission legislation. Many manufacturers push this boundary to the limit and sometimes into the grey area of legal definitions beyond. The stake/prize level of a skill machine is also a grey area, as there is no legal limit on either, although most manufacturers abide by a gentleman's agreement with BACTA (a trade organisation) to limit both amounts to levels that are unlikely to attract the attention of legislators. Skill machines can legally be sited anywhere and played by anyone of any age, although there seems to be a lot of confusion about this, with some people assuming age limits and site restrictions must exist because of the similarity between these machines and AWP (\\"amusement with prize\\") machines, such as one- armed bandits.

The Chinese term can be compared to the similar (but not identical) English concept of a \\"job for life\\". Traditionally, people considered to have such positions include military personnel, members of the civil service, as well as employees of various state-owned enterprises (through the mechanism of the work unit).  Origin  The origin of the term \\"iron rice bowl\\" came from J«ê Y√∫n's journal, Notes of the Thatched Abode of Close Observations (): A beautiful maid works in a squire's home. One day, the maid breaks a bowl, but the squire does not punish her because of her beauty. After that, the maid breaks more and more bowls. In response, the squire decides to change all of the bowls to iron bowls. The maid does not need to work, but she still gets paid.Yun Ji, 1798, Yuewei Hermitage, No.1. Therefore, the \\"iron rice bowl\\" is described as a stable or even a lifelong occupation that provides steady income and welfare, and the two key terms of the \\"iron rice bowl\\" are job entry guarantee and exit control.  History  After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, private-owned enterprises were replaced by state-owned enterprises. Based on its needs, the government also established public institutions. According to Article 2 of the Interim Regulation on the Registration of Public Institutions, > The term \\"public institutions\\" as mentioned in the present Regulation refers > to the public service organizations that are established by the state organs > or other organizations by using the state-owned assets for the purpose of > engaging in activities of education, science and technology, culture and > hygiene. As a result, the state became the main recruiter and employer. The state not only paid employees' salaries, but also provided social benefits, which ranged from gifts in Chinese festivals and holidays to welfare and retirement plans. Because these state-run enterprise and institutions guaranteed lifelong employment, employees were paid the same salary. There was a phrase to describe the situation: \\"No matter whether one works or not, one gets paid thirty-six a month\\". Because there was no merit pay, workers were less motivated. Therefore, most sectors experienced the issue of employment redundancy. The effect of employment redundancy includes employees' low efficiency and employers' high-cost. Initiated from the establishment of the PRC, the iron rice bowl was one of the main slogans for communism: the Communist Party of China was supposed to provide job opportunities for everyone. The CPC's promise to the Chinese people was crucial because almost half of the urban labor force was experiencing unemployment when the party took control. Due to the Japanese invasion and the Civil War directly afterwards, the Republic of China (ROC) suffered from hyperinflation from 1948 to 1949. Money became worthless and the basic life of the urban population became unsustainable. The adoption of the iron rice bowl provided security for people. In order to maintain, the government encouraged the public sectors to recruit more employees, which caused unnecessary waste of cost and human labor. Even though employment was high during the Great Leap Forward period (1958‚Äì62), after its failure, many projects that were proposed during that period were shut down. As a result, the government needed to remove around 20 percent of the labor force. The size of the iron rice bowl was shrinking. When Deng Xiaoping began his labor reforms in the People's Republic of China in the 1980s to boost economic productivity, the government iron rice bowl jobs were some of the first to go. He transformed China from a centrally-planned economy to a more free-market economy, his supporters insisted that the iron rice bowl had to be smashed if China was to modernize. During the 1978 Rural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping implicitly set an end to the iron rice bowl with the implementation of a number of economic reforms that were meant to embrace free markets. These reforms included the replacement of the collective farming system with a \\"household responsibility system,\\" under which households could contract land, machinery, and facilities from collective organizations in order to make independent operating decisions without losing the value of unified, collective management. This meant that farmers were able to personally benefit financially from their own crops, as households were able to get rid of surpluses in production as long as they were able to fulfill the collective quotas. The adoption of the contract system in rural China increased productivity and food supplies in those areas. Deng Xiaoping also introduced reforms that made prices more flexible and allowed them to rise above the government-mandated price floors. In 1980, the government sought to end the system of lifelong employment for workers in state-owned enterprises by using fixed-term contracts to hire new labor, which they hoped would allow companies to refrain from renewing workers' contracts if they were not qualified, efficient, or capable enough. Under this new system, workers were examined and worked for six months on probationary terms, before a long-term contract for 3‚Äì5 years was negotiated. Children were also no longer able to fill their parent's position automatically if their parents no longer worked for that company. Further changes included an expansion of reasons for which an employee could be fired, as well as the ability of an employer to refuse a routine job transfer. Workers were additionally to refrain from arguing with an unsatisfied customer to the point of losing a sale, which was particularly relevant in customer-based industries, such as restaurant businesses and retail. The Chinese Constitution was amended in 1992, when Deng Xiaoping garnered the political backing and Party Secretary General Jiang Zemin provided the initiative. The revised constitution scrapped the planned economy under public ownership in favor of a \\"socialist market economy\\" with \\"Chinese characteristics\\" that welcomed diversified forms of ownership, especially \\"privately-owned, individually-owned, and foreign-invested\\" enterprises. Still, public ownership at all levels of government remained dominant. At the 15th Party Congress in September 1997, Jiang announced that reforms of medium- sized and large state enterprises would be accelerated. He proposed two new initiatives: major lay-offs (laid-off workers in China still receive minimal salaries) and divestiture of smaller state enterprises through mergers, leasing, selloffs, and, in some cases, bankruptcy. Since then, the government has indicated it is willing to go much further, announcing plans to sell more than 10,000 of China's 13,000 medium-sized and large state enterprises. As a condition for joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China had to \\"break the Iron Rice bowl\\", a step that was disputed by some economists. Efforts to break the iron rice bowl continued in Guangdong province in 2011 with a new plan of grassroots recruitment, employment by contract, and pay based on performance. The new arrangement will be included in the 12th five- year plan of the People's Republic of China (2011‚Äì2015).  Current situation  Since the reform started in 1997, a large number of workers in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were laid off while government workers retained job security. The reform thus created substantial unemployment risks to SOE workers relative to government workers. Up to this day, government officials, often known as , still have the job security promised under the iron rice bowl, resulting in inefficiency and corruption. According to Statistical Bulletin on the Development of Human Resources and Social Security in 2015 published by Ministry of Human Resources and Social of the People's Republic of China on 30 May 2016, as of the end of 2015, there were 7.167 million government officials in China. Under Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping's administration, there have been major efforts to eliminate corruption within the government. Xi made his intention to purge the system clear on various occasions, and China has witnessed the arrests of high-ranking government officials such as Ling Jihua, Xu Caihou, and Zhou Yongkang.  Problems  Some scholars claim that lifetime employment and seniority promotion systems are not the root of the problem. The key issue pertains to the contradiction between individual, collective, and state interests. The state-owned enterprises had to surrender all profits to the state, and income was paid in accordance with a nationwide wage scale, with little relationship to the financial situation of the enterprise. Employees and workers were not able to develop a strong economic identity with their enterprises since the economic performance of the enterprise had little effect on the individual's economic gains or losses. This was one of the reasons for the general lack of work incentive in Chinese enterprises under Mao and to a large extent remains the case today. Scholars argue that \\"The crux of the issue of workers' incentives lay with the state-oriented ethos rather than the practice of lifetime employment\\". Given the fact that the positions of government officials were not threatened by China's previous efforts to shatter the iron rice bowl, and that workers at SOE's experienced disproportionate unemployment, scholars predict that there is possibility that the unbalance could lead to public dissatisfaction with the government. If the government fails to settle or compensate the newly unemployed, the CPC potentially faces the destruction of the social stability that has sustained its reform program, laying the groundwork for possible grassroots uprisings.  Economic impact  Scholars claim that the iron rice bowl kept China from reaching its economic potential and reaching maximum productivity, as lifelong employment guarantee left managers and company owners with little to no incentive to respond to market signals. Similarly, workers who received a paycheck regardless of how much they produced, had no incentive to be more efficient and produce more output. However, this is not the only reason China fell behind economically. State enterprises lacked new technologies that were already being used in other countries, due to the high costs of providing required public services and upholding the wages promised by the state. This ultimately lead to low levels of productivity, and little economic growth. Yet, the government, which relied on the iron rice bowl for social stability in order to maintain authoritarian control, was hesitant to smash the iron rice bowl in order to achieve economic growth. During the time of China's economic reform in 1978, with soft budget constraints and the requirement to implement the government's goal of full-employment, the SOE sector had substantial redundant labor and many state owned firms were operating at a loss. In 1995 and 1996, around 50% of the SOEs (mostly small or medium-sized) reported losses (Meng, 2003). The Asian financial crisis in 1997 exacerbated the situation. The Chinese government was forced to take actions to improve efficiency of the SOEs and to stem losses.  Women and the iron rice bowl  While the New Marriage Law was the first legal document under the Communist Party which was supposed to guarantee women's rights, women were still largely unprotected under the New Marriage Law. The establishment of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation (ACWF) did not help to improve women's status significantly. In order to achieve gender equality, women needed to join the labor force as men did. However, neither the CPC nor the ACWF tried to create jobs for most women because China's economy had not yet grown enough to be capable of including so many women in the labor force. As a result, even after 1949, most Chinese women in rural areas still did not join the workforce: most women's lives stayed the same. They remained at home as caretakers. Only educated women were given part-time jobs opportunities. Although the Great Leap Forward was a failure, women's employment opportunities were improving during that period. Unrealistic quotas were set, both in industry and in agriculture. In order to achieve mass production, a larger labor force was necessary. Therefore, men were mobilized to work on mining, irrigation or the other industrial projects while agricultural work, which was traditionally taken care of by men, was left behind. In order to maintain agricultural work, women were mobilized to do the agricultural work. Because both men and women were working outside, the CPC founded dining halls to supply food for all workers and collective childcare. Women were liberated to a certain extent from their domestic work because the CPC needed their labor to accelerate production. Although women were finally able to go out to work, they sacrificed their health during that time period: they suffered from lack of nutrition and overwork.  Taiwan and Hong Kong  The iron rice bowl's position as a main feature of the government within the PRC is relatively unique for the region. The iron rice bowl was not as prevalent in Taiwan as it was in mainland China. Taiwan has fewer state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and more foreign-owned companies, and therefore lacks the infrastructure for a state welfare system like the one China had maintained. In this respect, Taiwan has also not experienced the unrest from workers who have lost their job security and benefits, largely escaping the destabilizing effects of rapid modernization. Hong Kong has historically been a center for foreign investment and home to fewer SOEs. The area's market reforms and status as a special economic zone meant that the presence of the iron rice bowl was mitigated, as Hong Kong has been more exposed to market pressures, especially those of the international market. Recently, government employment in Hong Kong has been seen as less desirable because of poor job environment and lowered job requirements. There has also been increased hostility towards the management of the welfare state in Hong Kong. The popular conception of the security of government jobs contrasts with the perception in other parts of China, where young students still see the bureaucracy as a promising chance for employment and upward mobility.  Other uses  In the Western world, the term has a similar usage. It has been popularized by Richard Lindzen in reference to government-funded scientists and labs that use their research results to justify continued government funding. Lindzen's thesis is that the intrinsic link between reporting and funding provides incentives to report research results in such a way as to ensure continued funding. The related term \\"rice bowl\\" often refers to a military project which is being protected in the interests of a particular department rather than wider needs. The term is also used to some extent in Singapore, a former British colony where the majority of citizens are ethnically Chinese. It is also used in Korea () as a name for officials, not only because of their job stability, but also because of stable income.

The party was formed in 1942 as a unification of two Indian groups (the Bolshevik Leninist Party of the United Provinces and Bihar and the Bolshevik Mazdoor Party of India), with the Lanka Sama Samaja Party of Ceylon (Sri Lanka). It was recognised as the Indian section of the Fourth International. Discussions for the preliminary Committee for the Formation of the Bolshevik - Leninist Party of India took place through underground meetings in Kandy in December 1940 and March 1941 and set the stage for a sole Trotskyist party for India. During the remainder of World War II, the BLPI influenced the trade union and student movements in several cities. Significant membership was recorded among tramway workers, as well as workers of the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills. The BLPI notably played a major role in the Quit India movement. It produced leaflets and posters giving unconditional support to the movement. It went even further, calling for the troops to revolt. The objective was ultimately for the British expulsion from India. Their efforts to direct the Quit India disruption into a revolutionary one brought significant reprisals, with members forced into hiding. The BLPI was the only political party to give unconditional support to the Royal Indian Navy mutiny. Early history = Before and during WWII =  LSSP (Ceylon) war activism  At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP)'s key members were forced to go underground due to its opposition to the British war effort. The two State Council members of the party and others on its Central committee were arrested and jailed. The leader of the nationalist Ceylon National Congress party and future Prime Minister of Ceylon, D.S. Senanayake tabled a resolution in the State Council, which was the unicameral legislature for Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), established in 1931 by the Donoughmore Constitution, suggesting an approach of ‚Äúwhole- hearted support‚Äù to the British government. Leaders of the LSSP ‚Äì notably Philip Gunawardena who was seen as 'father of Ceylonese Socialism' ‚Äì denounced the war between the Allies and Axies, who he regarded as imperialist powers, declaring that: ‚ÄúWe refuse to be a part of any imperialist war. We are against all imperialist wars and exploitation. The class struggle has refused to stop because a country is at war.‚Äù During the early war period, the LSSP served in a key position in a series of worker action and strikes among tea plantation workers, stemming from the Mool Oya Estate incident (December 1939), in which an Indian tea factory worker was fatally shot by police. Ceylonese activism implications for India Through the rampantly increasing striking from the Mool Oya Estate incident, a workers' council was formed suggesting that repercussions of the deepest seriousness in India may come from any response. Following the incident, Colonial police forces used a heavy hand on the tea estates, leading to strong feelings of sentiment and discontent within the workers. Imprisonment of key leaders Sensing the growing anger against them, the LSSP was banned on 18 June, and key party activists ‚ÄîPhilip Gunawardena, N.M. Perera, Edmund Samarakkody and Colvin R. de Silva ‚Äî were detained and imprisoned. Due to its provocative nature towards the British, the LSSP was able to go underground and continue its activism. Bolshevik‚ÄìLeninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma =LSSP's move to India and establishment of the Bolshevik Leninist Party of India= Through discussion, the Indian and Ceylonese trotskyists established a preliminary Committee for the Formation of the Bolshevik - Leninist Party of India. The discussions for this took place through underground meetings in Kandy in December 1940 and March 1941 and set the stage for a sole Trotskyist party for India. This was later amended to include Burma and Ceylon. The meeting in 1940 and 41 were attended by the jailed LSSP leaders aided by some guards of the Bogambara Prison. Though many were detained in Ceylon, several party leaders were able to escape to India, evading arrest. These included Party General Secretary Leslie Goonewardene and his wife, Vivienne Goonewardene. They settled in Calcutta, and established networks with the local Trotskyist networks. Other Ceylonese Trotskysists established contact with the Uttar Pradesh Trotskyist group, as well as groups in Bombay and Madras. On the 7th April 1942, Philip Gunawardena, N. M. Perera, Edmund Samarakkody and Colvin R. de Silva escaped from prison aided by the prison guards and party activists Doric de Souza and Vernon Gunasekera. The BLPI was formed in May 1942 and was approved by the Fourth International. = War period for the newly formed BLPI = During World War II, the BLPI remained relatively small ‚Äì a large contrast to the high expectations of a Subcontinent-wide political revolutionary party. While the BLPI's name suggests that it also represented Burma, there was arguably no party representation there. The Bolshevik Leninist Party found initial success, launching Spark, its party publication issued in Calcutta. Due to political suppression, the publication was moved to Bombay, and name changed to 'New Spark'. They published Trotsky's Open Letter to the Indian Workers, and other pieces. During the remainder of World War II, the BLPI influenced the trade union and student movements in several cities. Significant membership was recorded among tramway workers, as well as workers of the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills.  Post-war and the Quit India movement  =Quit India= Quit India procession in Bangalore The BLPI took part extensively in the Quit India movement. It produced leaflets and posters giving unconditional support to the movement. It went even further, calling for the troops to revolt. In Bombay the party recruited student activists and organised strikes, as well as influencing Congress propaganda.Ervin, W E, Tomorrow is Ours: The Trotskyist Movement in India and Ceylon, 1935-48, Colombo, Social Scientists Association, 2006. The objective was ultimately for the British expulsion from India. Their efforts to direct the Quit India disruption into a revolutionary one brought significant reprisals, with members forced into hiding. In Calcutta the BLPI joined a United Front with the Congress Socialist Party, the Revolutionary Socialist Party and the Forward Bloc. The front distributed leaflets. In South India, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar the BLPI distributed leaflets and led demonstrations. = Relationship with the Indian National Congress = The BLPI released details of issues within the Indian National Congress; these notably included its close connection to the landlords and its ignorance of promises made during the mass civil disobedience movements in the earlier part of the century. The BLPI also maintained a strained relationship with the Communist Party of India, who they argued had become corrupted by Stalinism. The BLPI also used the Communist Party's war stances to gain political leverage. Whereas the Communist Party of India (CPI) supported anti-fascism before the war, this changed with the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of August 1939, leading the CPI to change their stance to that of opposition of war. This position again changed with the betrayal and subsequent invasion of the USSR by the Nazis, after which the CPI advocated for a British success. = Party Split = Following the Quit India movement, hope was rife among South-Asian Socialist leaders. K. Tilak (Leslie Goonewardene) wrote that 'The young Bolshevik-Leninist Party ... now faces its first real chance for expansion ... The situation is changing and without doubt, of all of the parties and political groups in India, the BLPI is the one which is going to gain the most in this change'. Following the end of the Second World War, it was determined that the Ceylonese Lanka Sama Samaja Party should be separated from the BLPI. =Bombay mutiny= The Royal Indian Navy revolt (also called the Royal Indian Navy mutiny or Bombay mutiny) encompassed a total strike and subsequent revolt by Indian sailors of the Royal Indian Navy on board ship and shore establishments at Bombay harbour on 18 February 1946. From the initial flashpoint in Bombay, the revolt spread and found support throughout British India, from Karachi to Calcutta, and ultimately came to involve over 20,000 sailors in 78 ships and shore establishments. The mutiny was repressed with force by British troops and Royal Navy warships. Total casualties were 8 dead and 33 wounded. The only political party to give unconditional support to the revolt was the BLPI. As soon as it got news of the revolt it came out with a call for a Hartal in support of the mutineers. BLPI members Prabhakar More and Lakshman Jadhav led the textile workers out on strike. Barricades were set up and held for three days. However, attempts to contact the mutineers were foiled by British troops. =Post-war Sri Lanka= After the war, when the formerly exiled Ceylonese politicians returned home, they came back to a divided movement. Two of the main leaders of LSSP, N.M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena, had been released from jail. They now reconstructed LSSP as an independent party, the core being the 'Workers' Opposition' faction, which held the trade unions. Effectively there were two parallel LSSPs, one led by Perera and Gunawardena and the BLPI-section led by Colvin R de Silva, Leslie Goonawardene and Edmund Samarakkoddy, which had been formed around the Bolshevik-Leninist Faction of Doric de Souza. The English language organ of the BLPI-section was Fight. There was a brief reconciliation between the two factions in 1946. The BLPI section contested the 1947 election, in which it gained 5 seats in Parliament, compared to the LSSP's 10. In the 1947 election, the BLPI was the party with the third highest overall votes, with the LSSP becoming the main opposition party. The Ceylon section of BLPI was converted into the Bolshevik Samasamaja Party, the Ceylon section of the Fourth International. =Post-war India= The remainder of the BLPI in India was concentrated in Calcutta, Madras and Madurai, where the party was active in trade union work. In 1946 S. C. C. Anthonypillai, one of the Ceylonese (Sri Lankan) political leaders, was elected President of the Madras Labour Union (India's oldest union) and the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway Workers' Union. In 1948, the Fourth International asked the party to enter the Socialist Party of India and practice entryism there.

Sloane advertisement from September 1902 W. & J. Sloane was a prominent furniture and rug store in New York City that catered to the prominent, including the White House and the Breakers, and wealthy, including the Rockefeller, Whitney, and Vanderbilt families. After a long period of prosperity and prominence, the firm went through a shorter period of decline and was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1985. History On March 2, 1843, the company was founded as a rug importer and seller by William Sloane, who had just emigrated from Kilmarnock, Scotland, a town famous for expensive furniture, fine carpets and rugs. All teak and jute resources coming from East Bengal (present day Bangladesh). In 1852, his younger brother John W. Sloane joined the firm, when it was renamed W. & J. Sloane, followed by William's son William Douglas Sloane. It was the first company to import oriental carpets into the United States. It soon expanded to include furniture and other home furnishings, and quickly became the choice of the elite in New York. In the late 19th century, the company added an antiques department, started producing furniture, and became the first home furnishings store in the country, billing itself as \\"W. & J. Sloane Interior Decorators and Home Furnishers.\\" Its flagship store was originally located at Broadway and 19th Street, in \\"Ladies' Mile\\", relocating later to 414 Fifth Avenue at 38th Street, the former flagship of Franklin Simon & Co. =Taste-setter for America= In 1891, W. & J. Sloane incorporated and set the national decorating taste of the United States, and over the next sixty years decorated the homes of the most prominent people in the country, including the Breakers and the White House, created Hollywood movie sets, and even designed and decorated interiors of automobiles. It opened a branch in San Francisco, California originally to furnish pavilions at the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition (it also furnished the model homes at the 1939 New York World's Fair). It later acquired other upscale firms such as the California Furniture Company, and in 1925 a subsidiary, the Company of Master Craftsmen was founded by William Sloane Coffin, Sr. (the father of Rev. William Sloane Coffin) to create colonial revival furniture. During World War II the company worked with the Newport News Company and the North Carolina Shipbuilding Company on shipbuilding contracts for the United States Navy fitting out the interiors of liberty ships under the direction of John Sloane Griswold. =Decline and failure= In 1955, after a three-year internal struggle, control of the firm left the hands of a direct descendant of the Sloanes when Benjamin Coates, 37, was elected president. This meant the ouster of president W.E.S. Griswold, Jr. and chairman of the board John D. Sloane, both grandsons of the founders. Coates was a financier who married John D. Sloane's daughter in 1944 and served on the board. Along with the City Stores Company syndicate, he bought up 70% of the stock to win control and become head of the firm. After the store left family hands, it over-expanded and lowered the price and quality of its goods. City Stores was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1979 so that it could \\"continue operating while it works out a plan to pay its creditors.\\" It was then acquired by Hollywood-based RB Furniture in 1981. The chain closed its 38th Street store in 1984, and filed for bankruptcy on September 11, 1985. Its remaining stores were sold in 1986. Legacy The company generated considerable wealth for the direct descendants of William and John Sloane, who include in addition to Rev. Coffin, diplomat Cyrus Vance, attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr., musical producer John H. Hammond, his son, musician John P. Hammond, and philanthropist Emily Thorn Vanderbilt Sloane. It also brought the Sloane family into prominence in New York City, where they intermarried with the Whitneys, the Vanderbilts, and the Pynes. Employees who worked for the firm include the American cooking icon Julia Child (then Julia McWilliams), whose first job out of Smith College in October 1935 was Assistant to the New York Advertising Manager, A. W. Forester. Other notables include the Bevelacqua brothers: Salvatore and Aurelio, who designed under the Sloane banner before their respective success in furniture design.

Etymology There have been a number of proposals as to the origin and etymological origin of the name Jesus (cf. ). The name is related to the Hebrew form [Yehoshua\`] Joshua, which is a theophoric name first mentioned within the Biblical tradition in referring to one of Moses' companions (and his successor as leader of the Israelites). This name is usually considered to be a compound of two parts: Yeho, a theophoric reference to YHWH, the distinctive personal name of the God of Israel, plus a form derived from the Hebrew triconsonantal root y-≈°- ï or ◊ô-◊©-◊¢ \\"to liberate, save\\". There have been various proposals as to how the literal etymological meaning of the name should be translated, including:\\"◊©◊Å◊ï◊¢\\", Ernest Klein, A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew Language (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company 1987)Talshir, M.

Blue Letter Bible, H3442 :*YHWH saves :*YHWH (is) salvation :*YHWH (is) a saving- cry :*YHWH (is) a cry-for-saving :*YHWH (is) a cry-for-help :*YHWH (is) my help This early Biblical Hebrew name [Yehoshua\`] underwent a shortening into later Biblical [Yeshua\`], as found in the Hebrew text of verses Ezra 2:2, 2:6, 2:36, 2:40, 3:2, 3:8, 3:9, 3:10, 3:18, 4:3, 8:33; Nehemiah 3:19, 7:7, 7:11, 7:39, 7:43, 8:7, 8:17, 9:4, 9:5, 11:26, 12:1, 12:7, 12:8, 12:10, 12:24, 12:26; 1 Chronicles 24:11; and 2 Chronicles 31:15‚Äîas well as in Biblical Aramaic at verse Ezra 5:2. These Bible verses refer to ten individuals (in Nehemiah 8:17, the name refers to Joshua son of Nun). This historical change may have been due to a phonological shift whereby guttural phonemes weakened, including [h].Elisha Qimron, The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls (Harvard Semitic Studies: Scholars Press 1986), p.25 Usually, the traditional theophoric element [Yahu] was shortened at the beginning of a name to [Yo-], and at the end to [-yah]. In the contraction of [Yehoshua\`] to [Yeshua\`], the vowel is instead fronted (perhaps due to the influence of the y in triliteral root y-≈°- ï). During the post-Biblical period, the name was also adopted by Aramaic and Greek-speaking Jews. By the time the New Testament was written, the Septuagint had already transliterated ◊ô◊©◊ï◊¢ [Yeshua\`] into Koine Greek as closely as possible in the 3rd-century BCE, the result being [Iƒìsous]. Since Greek had no equivalent to the Semitic letter shin [sh], it was replaced with a œÉ sigma [s], and a masculine singular ending [-s] was added in the nominative case, in order to allow the name to be inflected for case (nominative, accusative, etc.) in the grammar of the Greek language. The diphthongal [a] vowel of Masoretic [Yehoshua\`] or [Yeshua\`] would not have been present in Hebrew/Aramaic pronunciation during this period, and some scholars believe some dialects dropped the pharyngeal sound of the final letter \`ayin [\`], which in any case had no counterpart in ancient Greek. The Greek writings of Philo of AlexandriaPhilo Judaeus, De ebrietate in Philonis Alexandrini opera quae supersunt, ed. P. Wendland, Berlin: Reimer, 1897 (repr. De Gruyter, 1962)vol. 2:170-214, Section 96, Line 2. and Josephus frequently mention this name. It also occurs in the Greek New Testament at Acts 7:45 and Hebrews 4:8, referring to Joshua son of Nun. From Greek, [Iƒìsous] moved into Latin at least by the time of the Vetus Latina. The morphological jump this time was not as large as previous changes between language families. [Iƒìsous] was transliterated to Latin IESVS, where it stood for many centuries. The Latin name has an irregular declension, with a genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative of Jesu, accusative of Jesum, and nominative of Jesus. Minuscule (lower case) letters were developed around 800 and some time later the U was invented to distinguish the vowel sound from the consonantal sound and the J to distinguish the consonant from I. Similarly, Greek minuscules were invented about the same time, prior to that the name was written in capital letters: or abbreviated as: with a line over the top, see also Christogram. Modern English \\"Jesus\\" derives from Early Middle English Iesu (attested from the 12th century). The name participated in the Great Vowel Shift in late Middle English (15th century). The letter J was first distinguished from 'I' by the Frenchman Pierre Ramus in the 16th century, but did not become common in Modern English until the 17th century, so that early 17th century works such as the first edition of the King James Version of the Bible (1611) continued to print the name with an I.Image of the first edition of the King James Version of the Bible, Gospel of Luke.

The form Jesu is often a vocative, \\"Jesu!\\", but may also stand for other cases, such as genitive, as in Latin. The form \\"Jesu\\" was preserved in hymns and poetry long after it had fallen out of general use in speech, for example in poet laureate Robert Bridges' translation of Johann Schop's wording for the English translation of Johann Sebastian Bach's cantata, Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring and in T.

Reverence for the name of Jesus is emphasized by Saint Paul in Philippians 2:10 where he states: \\"That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth\\".Catholic encyclopedia: Holy Name of Jesus The use of the name of Jesus in petitions is stressed in John 16:23 when Jesus states: \\"If you ask the Father anything in my name he will give it you.\\" Many Christian prayers thus conclude with the words: \\"Through Our Lord Jesus Christ\\". There is widespread belief among Christians that the name Jesus is not merely a sequence of identifying symbols but includes intrinsic divine power, and that where the name of Jesus is spoken or displayed the power of Jesus can be called upon. =Emmanuel= Matthew 1:23 (\\"they shall call his name Emmanuel\\") provides the name 'Emmanuel' (meaning God is with us).Who do you say that I am?: essays on Christology by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 page 17 'Emmanuel', which is taken from Isaiah 7:14, does not appear elsewhere in the New Testament. The name 'Emmanuel' (also Immanuel or Imanu'el) of the Hebrew ◊¢÷¥◊û÷∏÷º◊†◊ï÷º◊ê÷µ◊ú \\"God [is] with us\\" consists of two Hebrew words: ◊ê÷µ◊ú (‚ÄôEl, meaning 'God') and ◊¢÷¥◊û÷∏÷º◊†◊ï÷º ( ªImmƒÅn≈´, meaning 'with us'); Standard Hebrew  ªImmanu ºel, Tiberian Hebrew  ªImmƒÅn√ª ºƒìl. It is a theophoric name used in the Bible in Isaiah 7:14 and . Some interpreters see Matthew 1:23 providing a key to an Emmanuel Christology in the New Testament, with Matthew showing an interest in identifying Jesus as \\"God with us\\" and later developing the Emmanuel theme at key points throughout his Gospel.Matthew 1-13 by Manlio Simonetti 2001 page 17Matthew 1-2/ Luke 1-2 by Louise Perrotta 2004 page 19Matthew's Emmanuel by David D. Kupp 1997 pages 220-224 The name Emmanuel does not directly appear elsewhere in the New Testament, but Matthew builds on the motif in Matthew 28:20 to indicate that Jesus will be with the faithful to the end times. According to Ulrich Luz, the Emmanuel motif brackets the entire Gospel of Matthew between 1:23 and 28:20, appearing explicitly and implicitly in several other passages, setting the tone for the salvific theme of Matthew.The theology of the Gospel of Matthew by Ulrich Luz 1995 page 31 Some Christians see the same meaning in Matthew 28:20 (\\"I am with you always, even unto the end of the world\\") indicates that Jesus will be with the faithful to the end of the age.

In Matthew 16:16 Apostle Peter, in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the first century, said, \\"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\\"Christianity by Donald W. Ekstrand 2008 pages 147-150 In John 11:27 Martha tells Jesus \\"you are the Christ\\", just before the raising of Lazarus.Christianity by Donald W. Ekstrand 2008 page 81 In the Pauline Epistles the word Christ is so closely associated with Jesus that it is apparent that for the early Christians there is no need to claim that Jesus is Christ, for that is considered widely accepted among them. Hence Paul can use the term Christos with no confusion as to whom it refers to, and as in First Corinthians 4:15 and Romans 12:5 he can use expressions such as \\"in Christ\\" to refer to the followers of Jesus.Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity by Larry W. Hurtado 2005 page 99 Symbols for representing Christ (i.e. Christograms) were developed by early Christians, e.g. the Chi Rho symbol formed by superimposing the first two Greek letters in Christ ( Greek : \\"ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ\\" ), chi = ch and rho = r, to produce ‚òß.Symbols of the Christian faith by Alva William Steffler 2002 page 66 =Lord= The Chi Rho circled with the Prayer: \\"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me\\". Early Christians viewed Jesus as \\"the Lord\\" and the Greek word Kyrios (Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ) which may mean God, lord or master appears over 700 times in the New Testament, referring to him.Mercer dictionary of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 pages 520-525The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 pages 234-237 In everyday Aramaic, Mari was a very respectful form of polite address, well above \\"Teacher\\" and similar to Rabbi. In Greek this has at times been translated as Kyrios. While the term Mari expressed the relationship between Jesus and his disciples during his life, the Greek Kyrios came to represent his lordship over the world.The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 page 202 Pauline writings further established the various theological consequences of the Lord/Kyrios concept among early Christians, and emphasized the attributes of Jesus as not only referring to his eschatological victory, but to him as the \\"divine image\\" (Greek eik≈çn) in whose face the glory of God shines forth. In Romans 10:9‚Äì13 Paul emphasized the salvific value of the title, and stated that confessing by mouth (homologeo) the belief that Jesus is Lord (Kyrion Iesoun) signifies one's salvation.Lord Jesus Christ by Larry W. Hurtado 2005 page 142 The high frequency of the use of the term Kyrios in the Acts of the Apostles indicates how natural it was for early Christians to refer to Jesus in this way. This title persisted among Christians as the predominant perception of Jesus for a number of centuries.Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity by Larry W. Hurtado 2005 pages 113 and 179 The use of the Kyrios title for Jesus is central to the development of New Testament Christology, for the early Christians placed it at the center of their understanding and from that center attempted to understand the other issues related to the Christian mysteries.Christology: Biblical And Historical by Mini S. Johnson, 2005 pages 229-235 The question of the deity of Christ in the New Testament is inherently related to the Kyrios title of Jesus used in the early Christian writings and its implications for the absolute lordship of Jesus. In early Christian belief, the concept of Kyrios included the Pre-existence of Christ for they believed that if Christ is one with God, he must have been united with God from the very beginning. The title, even in the Greek form, continues to be widely used in Christian liturgy, e.g. in the Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison combination (i.e. Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy), where Jesus is referred to as Lord in one case, and as Christ immediately thereafter.The Science of the Sacraments by Charles Webster Leadbeater 2007 pages 101-102 =Master= The Greek word Epistates (Epistata in the vocative case) is used only in Luke's gospel, where it occurs six times. Robert O'Toole argues that the word relates to Jesus' power over the material world rather than his teaching. Some commentators suggest that in Luke 5, Peter progresses from seeing Jesus as \\"Master\\" (v. 5) to seeing him as \\"Lord\\" (v. 8). =Logos (the Word)= Latin for At the beginning there was the Word. John 1:1-18 from the Clementine Vulgate. John 1:1-18 calls Jesus the Logos (Greek ), often used as \\"the Word\\" in English translations.Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon: logos, 1889. The identification of Jesus as the Logos which became Incarnate appears only at the beginning of the Gospel of John and the term Logos/Word is used only in two other Johannine passages: 1 John 1:1 and Revelation 19:13. It appears nowhere else in the New Testament.The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 page 258The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1988 page 106Mercer dictionary of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 page 520 The series of statements regarding the Logos at the very beginning of the Gospel of John build on each other. The statement that the Logos existed \\"at the beginning\\" asserts that as Logos Jesus was an eternal being like God. The statement that the Logos was \\"with God\\" asserts the distinction of Jesus from God. The statement that the Logos \\"was God\\" states the unity of Jesus with God, thus stating his divinity.A Complete Introduction to the Bible by Christopher Gilbert 2009 page 216 In 1 John 1:1 the arrival of the Logos as \\"the Word of life\\" from the beginning is emphasized and 1 John 5:6 builds on it to emphasize the water and blood of incarnation. With the use of the title Logos, Johannine Christology consciously affirms the belief in the divinity of Jesus: that he was God who came to be among men as the Word Incarnate.Introduction to theology by Owen C. Thomas, Ellen K. Wondra 2002 page 173 Although as of the 2nd century the use of the title Logos gave rise to debate between the Alexandrian and Antiochian schools of thought regarding the interaction of the human and divine elements in the Person of Christ, after the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and Council of Chalcedon in 451 the Logos and the second person of the Trinity were often used interchangeably.A concise dictionary of theology by Gerald O'Collins 2004 pages 144-145Mercer dictionary of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 page 146 =Son of God= Mark: \\"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God\\", by Sargis Pitsak 14th century. The title \\"Son of God\\" is applied to Jesus in many cases in the New Testament.Catholic Encyclopedia: Son of God It is often used to refer to his divinity, from the beginning in the Annunciation up to the Crucifixion. The declaration that Jesus is the Son of God is made by many individuals in the New Testament, on two separate occasions by God the Father as a voice from Heaven, and is also asserted by Jesus himself. The Son of God title, according to most Christian denominations, Trinitarian in belief, refers to the relationship between Jesus and God, specifically as \\"God the Son\\". For thousands of years, emperors and rulers ranging from the Western Zhou dynasty (c. 1000 B.C.) in China to Alexander the Great in Greece have assumed titles that reflect a filial relationship with deities.Introduction to the Science of Religion by Friedrich Muller 2004 page 136China : a cultural and historical dictionary by Michael Dillon 1998 page 293 At the time of Jesus, Roman Emperor Augustus exploited the similarity between the titles Divi filius (son of the Divine One) and \\"Dei filius\\" (Son of God) and used the ambiguous inscription \\"DF\\" to refer to himself to emphasize the divine component of his image.Early Christian literature by Helen Rhee 2005 pages 159-161Augustus by Pat Southern 1998 page 60The world that shaped the New Testament by Calvin J.

Crossan argues that early Christians adopted this title.Crossan, John Dominic, God and Empire, 2007, p. 28 The Gospel of Mark begins by calling Jesus the Son of God and reaffirms the title twice when a voice from Heaven calls Jesus: \\"my Son\\" in and .Who do you say that I am?: essays on Christology by Jack Dean Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 pages 246-251 In Matthew 14:33, after Jesus walks on water, the disciples tell Jesus: \\"You really are the Son of God!\\"Dwight Pentecost The words and works of Jesus Christ 2000 page 234 In Matthew 27:43, while Jesus hangs on the cross, the Jewish leaders mock him to ask God help, \\"for he said, I am the Son of God\\", referring to the claim of Jesus to be the Son of God.The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1988 page 571‚Äì572 Matthew 27:54 and include the exclamation by the Roman commander, \\"He was surely the Son of God!\\", after the earthquake following the Crucifixion of Jesus. When, in , Apostle Peter states, \\"You are Christ, the Son of the living God\\", Jesus not only accepts the titles, but calls Peter \\"blessed\\" and declares the profession a divine revelation, unequivocally declaring himself to be both Christ and the Son of God in Matthew 16:15-16.One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 pages 240‚Äì241 In the new Testament, Jesus uses the term \\"my Father\\" as a direct and unequivocal assertion of his sonship, and a unique relationship with the Father beyond any attribution of titles by others, e.g., in Matthew 11:27, John 5:23 and John 5:26.The Person of Christ by Gerrit Cornelis Berkouwer 1954 page 163The Wiersbe Bible Commentary by Warren W. Wiersbe 2007 page 245 In a number of other episodes, Jesus claims sonship by referring to the Father, e.g., in Luke 2:49, when he is found in the temple, a young Jesus calls the temple \\"my Father's house\\", just as he does later in in the Cleansing of the Temple episode. In Matthew 1:11 and , Jesus allows himself to be called the Son of God by the voice from above, not objecting to the title. Of all the Christological titles used in the New Testament, Son of God has had one of the most lasting impacts in Christian history and has become part of the profession of faith by many Christians. In the mainstream Trinitarian context, the title implies the full divinity of Jesus as part of the Holy Trinity of Father, Son and the Spirit.Christology and the New Testament Christopher Mark Tuckett 2001 page 22 However, the concept of God as the father of Jesus and Jesus as the one and only Son of God is distinct from the concept of God as the Creator and father of all people, as indicated in the Apostle's Creed.Symbols of Jesus: A Christology of Symbolic Engagement by Robert C. Neville 2002 page 26 The profession begins with expressing belief in the \\"Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth\\" and then immediately, but separately, in \\"Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord\\", thus expressing both senses of fatherhood within the Creed. =Son of man= Luke, a copy c. 800 shown here. The term son of man appears many times in all four gospel accounts, e.g. 30 times in Matthew. However, unlike the title son of God, its proclamation has never been an article of faith in Christianity.Jesus and the Son of Man by A J B Higgins 2002 pages 13‚Äì15 While the profession of Jesus as the son of God has been an essential element of Christian creeds since the Apostolic Age, such professions do not apply to son of man. Yet, the Christological analysis of the relationship between the two terms has been the subject of much research. In modern biblical research the occurrences of son of man in the Synoptic gospels are generally categorized into three groups: those that refer to his \\"coming\\" (as an exaltation), those that refer to \\"suffering\\" and those that refer to \\"now at work\\", i.e. referring to the earthly life.The Son of Man by Chrys C. Caragounis 1986 page 145‚Äì147 The presentation in the Gospel of John is somewhat different from the Synoptics and in John 1:51 he is presented as contact with God through \\"angelic instrumentality\\", in John 6:26 and 6:53 he provides life through his death and in John 5:27 he holds the power to judge men. The first chapter of the Book of Revelation refers to \\"one like unto a son of man\\" in Revelation 1:12‚Äì13 which radiantly stands in glory and speaks to the author.The Book of Revelation by Robert H. Mounce 1997 page 57 In the Gospel of John Jesus is not just a messianic figure, nor a prophet like Moses, but the key emphasis is on his dual role as son of God and son of man.Christology and the New Testament by Christopher Mark Tuckett 2001 page 159 Although the son of man is distinct from the son of God, some gospel passages equate them in some cases, e.g. in Mark 14:61, during the Sanhedrin trial of Jesus when the high priest asked Jesus: \\"Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?\\" Jesus responded \\"I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.\\"The 'Son of Man' as the Son of God by Seyoon Kim 1983 pages 2‚Äì3Who Is Jesus?: An Introduction to Christology by Thomas P. Rausch 2003 pages 132‚Äì133 This builds on the statement in Mark 9:31 that \\"The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again.\\" In the parable of the Sheep and the Goats, the returning son of man has the power to judge, by separating men from \\"all the nations\\" into distinct groups, in Matthew 25:31‚Äì46. For centuries, the Christological perspective on son of man has been a natural counterpart to that of son of God and in many cases affirms the humanity of Jesus just as son of God affirms his divinity.Christian Theology: An Introduction by Alister E. McGrath 2010 page 270 In the 5th century, Saint Augustine viewed the duality of son of God and son of man in terms of the dual nature of Christ in hypostatic union, in that the son of God became the son of man through the act of incarnation and wrote: \\"Since he is the only Son of God by nature, he became also the Son of Man that he might be full of grace as well.\\"The Augustine Catechism by Saint Augustine of Hippo 2008 page 68Augustine by Mary T. Clark 2005 page 61 Geza Vermes has argued that \\"the son of man\\" in the Gospels is unrelated to these Hebrew Bible usages. He begins with the observation that there is no example of \\"the\\" son of man in Hebrew sources. He suggests that the term originates in Aramaic‚Äîbar nash/bar nasha. Based on his study of Aramaic sources, he concludes that in these sources: (1) \\"Son of man\\" is a regular expression for man in general. (2) It often serves as an indefinite pronoun (\\"one\\" or \\"someone\\"). (3) In certain circumstances it may be employed as a circumlocution. In monologues or dialogues the speaker can refer to himself, not as 'I', but as \\"the son of man\\" in the third person, in contexts implying awe, reserve, or modesty. (4) In none of the extant texts does \\"son of man\\" figure as a title.Vermes, Geza, Jesus in his Jewish context. Minneapolis: Fortress Press. p. 82. . James E. Talmage, a prominent writer and leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints argued that the definitive article used in the New Testament makes the title \\"the Son of Man\\" a distinguishing appellation exclusive to Jesus. Talmage supports the view of Vermes, but adds to it the additional meaning that Jesus is the son of an exalted man, subscribing to the Church's doctrine of Exaltation. In this sense, too, the title is unique to Jesus, as he is the only literal physical offspring of God the Father. No discussion of the title \\"Son of Man\\" (◊ë◊® ◊ê◊†◊©) is complete without reference to the appearance of the term in the seventh chapter of the biblical book of Daniel. Daniel 7:13-14 in the English Standard Version reads, > I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came > one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented > before him. And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all > peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an > everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that > shall not be destroyed. In the context of this vision, Daniel is troubled and approaches someone standing there with him observing this bequeathal of kingship at the Throne of the Ancient of Days. The heavenly by-stander explains the import of the vision in the following words: > And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the > whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; > his kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve > and obey him (Daniel 7:27, ESV). Here the term son of man is explained in three distinct ways: 1) as \\"the people of the saints of the Most High,\\" 2) as a single entity in the words \\"his kingdom\\" and \\"serve and obey him,\\" and 3) as \\"the Most High\\" Himself where it says \\"the Most High; his kingdom.\\" Furthermore, the passage presents a contextual time frame for the events envisioned--the time of the \\"fourth kingdom on earth\\" (Daniel 7:23). The most traditional and widespread view is that the fourth kingdom represents the Roman governmental system. With the establishment of Christianity under this Roman governmental system, the Christian Churches came to identify the son of man in Daniel 7 as Jesus the Christ. The Apostle Paul describes the corporate nature of the Son of Man envisioned in Daniel 7 when he writes to the Church at Corinth, saying, > For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the > body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ (First Corinthians > 12:12, ESV). The Pauline epistles depict Christ as the Head of His people the Church (Ephesians 1:15-23; Colossians 1:13-18). The New Testament identifies Jesus the Christ as the Most High, Whose Name is above all names (Philippians 2:9-10). The Gospel of Mark, often claimed by modern scholarship to be the first and earliest of the Four Gospels, identifies Jesus Christ as the LORD God of Israel by reference to the Tetragrammaton at the beginning of his Gospel: > The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. As it is > written in Isaiah the prophet, ‚ÄúBehold, I send my messenger before your > face, who will prepare your way, the voice of one crying in the wilderness: > ‚ÄòPrepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight‚Äô‚Äù (Mark 1:1-3, ESV). From the context, it is evident that Mark is identifying \\"my messenger\\" as John the Baptist, sent to prepare the way of Jesus Christ. The Sender of the messenger is God. When it says \\"before your face, who will prepare your way,\\" the context confirms Mark as speaking of the face of Jesus Christ and of preparing Jesus Christ's way. The most striking element of this passage, however, is the equivalency Mark draws between the way of Jesus Christ and \\"the way of the Lord\\" (œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ΩÅŒ¥·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒöœÖœÅŒØŒøœÖ). The implication is that Jesus Christ is the Lord (ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ). This reference to the way of the Lord is taken from the prophet Isaiah 40:3: > A voice cries: ‚ÄúIn the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make straight > in the desert a highway for our God (ESV). In the Hebrew texts, \\"the way of the LORD\\" is \\"the way of Y-WH,\\" using the Holy Tetragrammaton, the Divine Name of the God of Israel revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 3:13-15). In this way the Gospel according to Mark identifies Jesus as both Messiah and the LORD God of Israel. Likewise, the most Jewish Gospel of Matthew, held to be the first Gospel according to the tradition of the Christian Church, identifies Jesus Christ as \\"the Son of Man\\" and \\"the Son of the Living God\\" (Matthew 16:13), the Son of the Virgin and as God with us (Matthew 1:23). So in Orthodox Christian theology, Jesus Christ is both Most High and Son of Man, whose mystical Body is the Church, and \\"of His Kingdom there shall be no end\\" (Luke 1:33; Nicene Creed). According to Christian theology, the faithful of Christ will reign with Him over sin, death, and corruption both in this life and in the next (Romans 5:17; 2 Timothy 2:12). This unfolding kingdom is held by Christians to be the fulfillment of the Son-of-Man vision recorded in Daniel 7. =Son of David= The title \\"Son of David\\" indicates Jesus' physical descent from David, as well as his membership of the Davidic line of kings, establishing the claim of Jesus Christ to the Davidic Throne based on the promises God made to King David through Nathan the prophet when David was hoping to build God a house, or temple: > Moreover, the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house. When > your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up > your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will > establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will > establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be to him a father, and > he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him > with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, but my steadfast > love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from > before you. And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever > before me. Your throne shall be established forever (2 Samuel 7:11-16). This promise assures King David of an ongoing royal lineage forever that cannot be thwarted or annulled through human sin. The Promised Offspring par excellence will build a House for God, will reign on an Eternal Throne, will be called the \\"son\\" of God, and will be chastened with beating should he commit iniquity. One might well ask what would be the result for humankind if a Son of David who is sinless were to be beaten with \\"the stripes of the sons of men.\\" Would it result in Divine judgment or Divine mercy? The Apostle Paul seems to answer this question in his Epistle to the Romans: > Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the > gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy > Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to > the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the > Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, > through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the > obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations, including > you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ, To all those in Rome who are > loved by God and called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our > Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 1:1-7, ESV). According to the Apostle Paul, the unjust death of the Son of God and His resurrection from the dead result in grace, peace, and an increasing faithful obedience among all nations through the proclamation of the Gospel. The Kingdom of the Son of David, Jesus Christ, is portrayed in the New Testament as being current as He reigns at the right hand of the Father (Hebrews 8:1; Revelation 2:26-27; 20:4-6). It should be no surprise to anyone familiar with the Scriptures that the Throne of the LORD is the same as the Throne of David because these are equated in First Chronicles 29:23. The Messianic vision of Isaiah in Isaiah chapter 11 is envisioned in the New Testament as spreading gradually toward a final culmination (Matthew 13:33; Luke 17:20-21). The phrase \\"Son of David\\" is used a number of times in the gospel of Matthew. It appears in Matthew 1:1 to introduce both the genealogy and the gospel. It is found on the lips of the blind men healed in Galilee (\\"Have mercy on us, Son of David\\", ), the crowd who are amazed at Jesus' healing of a blind, mute and demon-possessed man ), the Canaanite woman whose daughter is exorcised (\\"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me,\\" ), and the blind men healed near Jericho (\\"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us\\", ). It also forms part of the shout of the crowds when Jesus enters Jerusalem: \\"Hosanna to the Son of David\\" (Matthew 21:9). Other references with the same use include and . A variant of this title is found in , where Jesus refers to himself as \\"the Root and the Offspring of David\\". According to Anglican Bishop Charles Ellicott, \\"Son of David\\" was \\"the most popular of all the names of the expected Christ\\".Ellicott, C., Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers on Matthew 1, accessed 10 January 2016 =Lamb of God= A typical depiction of Agnus Dei, bleeding into a Holy Chalice and carrying a Christian victory banner. The title Lamb of God (Agnus Dei) only appears in the Gospel of John, with the exclamation of John the Baptist: \\"Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world\\" in John 1:29, the title reaffirmed the next day in John 1:36.The Lamb of God by Sergei Bulgakov 2008 page 263 The second use of the title Lamb of God takes place in the presence of the first two apostles of Jesus, who immediately follow him, address him as Rabbi with respect and later in the narrative bring others to meet him.The Life and Ministry of Jesus by Douglas Redford 2007 pages 100-101 These two proclamations of Jesus as the Lamb of God closely bracket the Baptist's other proclamation in John 1:34: \\"I have borne witness that this is the Son of God\\". From a Christological perspective, these proclamations and the descent of the Holy Spirit as a dove in John 1:32 reinforce each other to establish the divine element of the Person of Christ. In Johannine Christology the proclamation \\"who takes away the sins of the world\\" begins the unfolding of the salvific theme of the redemptive and sacrificial death of Jesus followed by his resurrection which is built upon in other proclamations such as \\"this is indeed the Saviour of the world\\" uttered by the Samaritans in John 4:42.Johannine Christology and the Early Church by T. E. Pollard 2005 page 21Studies in Early Christology by Martin Hengel 2004 page 371 However, nothing in the context of 1 Corinthians 5:7 directly implies that in that specific passage Saint Paul refers the death of Jesus using the same theme.1 Corinthians by David J. Lull, William A. Beardslee 2007 page 41 The Book of Revelation includes over twenty references to a lion-like lamb (\\"slain but standing\\") which delivers victory in a manner reminiscent of the resurrected Christ.Reclaiming the book of Revelation: by Wilfried E. Glabach 2007 pages In the first appearance of the lamb in Revelation (5:1-7) only the lamb (which is of the tribe of Judah, and the root of David) is found worthy to take the judgment scroll from God and break the seals. In Revelation 21:14 the lamb is said to have twelve apostles. The theme of a sacrificial lamb which rises in victory as the Resurrected Christ was employed in early Christology, e.g. in 375 Saint Augustine wrote: \\"Why a lamb in his passion? For he underwent death without being guilty of any inequity. Why a lion in his resurrection? For in being slain, he slew death.\\"Revelation by William C. Weinrich 2005 page 73 The Lamb of God title has found widespread use in Christian prayers and the Agnus Dei (\\"Lamb of God who take away the sins of the world have mercy on us; Lamb of God who take away the sins of the world grant us peace\\") is used both in liturgy and as a form of contemplative prayer. It references the concept of a scapegoat, where people put their blame on others, however with the interpretation of Jesus taking on Christian's sins. Holy Conversation: Spirituality for Worship by Jonathan Linman 2010 page 148Prayer Book Parallels: The Public Services of the Church by Paul Victor Marshall 1990 page 369 =New Adam / Second Adam / Last Adam= The Resurrected Jesus pulls Adam and Eve out of their graves, with Satan bound in Hell, Chora Church, Istanbul, c. 1315. Just as the Gospel of John proclaims the universal relevance of the Incarnation of Jesus as Logos, the Pauline view emphasizes the cosmic view that his birth, Crucifixion and Resurrection brought forth a new man and a new world. Paul's eschatological view of Jesus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to Adam. Unlike Adam, the new man born in Jesus obeys God and ushers in a world of morality and salvation.Systematic Theology, Volume 2 by Wolfhart Pannenberg 2004 0567084663 ISBN pages 297-303 In the Pauline view, Adam is positioned as the first man and Jesus as the second and last Adam (1 Corinthians 15:45), the first having corrupted himself by his disobedience, also infected humanity and left it with a curse as inheritance. The birth of Jesus, on the other hand, counterbalanced the fall of Adam, bringing forth redemption and repairing the damage done by Adam.An exposition of the epistle of Saint Paul to the Philippians by Jean Daille 1995 pages 194-195 The theme is reiterated by Paul, in Romans 5:18-21, when he states: > Therefore just as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all, so one > man's act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all. For just > as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one > man's obedience the many will be made righteous. But law came in, with the > result that the trespass multiplied; but where sin increased, grace abounded > all the more, so that, just as sin exercised dominion in death, so grace > might also exercise dominion through justification* leading to eternal life > through Jesus Christ our Lord. In the 2nd century Church Father Irenaeus continued this tradition and stated: \\"so that what we had lost in Adam - namely to be according to the image and likeness of God- that we might recover in Christ Jesus.\\"An introduction to the early history of Christian doctrine by James Franklin Bethune-Baker 2005 page 334A History of the Christian Church by Williston Walker 2010 pages 65-66 Irenaeus also used the analogy of \\"second Adam and second Eve\\" and suggested the Virgin Mary as the \\"second Eve\\" who had set a path of obedience for the second Adam (i.e. Jesus) from the Annunciation to Calvary.Burke, Raymond L.; et al. (2008). Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons pages 613-614 The tradition continued in the 4th century by Ephrem the Syrian and later by Saint Augustine in his Felix culpa, i.e. the happy fall from grace of Adam and Eve.The Early Christian World, Volumes 1-2 by Philip Francis Esler 2004 page 452Handbook to life in the medieval world, Volume 1 by Madeleine Pelner Cosman, Linda Gale Jones 2008 page 329 Later, in the 16th century, John Calvin viewed the birth of Jesus as the second Adam one of the six modes of atonement.The theology of John Calvin by Charles Partee 2008 page 159 = Light of the World = St. Brendan, Bantry, Ireland. Jesus is called a light in seven instances in the New Testament and Light of the World only in the Gospel of John. The terms \\"Bread of Life\\" and \\"Life of the World\\" are also applied by Jesus to himself in John's Gospel in the same Christological sense. In John 8:12 Jesus applies the title to himself while debating with the Jews, and states:Names and Titles of the Lord Jesus Christ by Charles Spear 2003 page 226 :I am the light of the world: he who follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. Jesus again claims to be Light of the World in John 9:5, during the miracle of healing the blind at birth, saying: New Testament christology by Frank J. Matera 1999 page 235 :When I am in the world, I am the Light of the World. This episode leads into John 9:39 where Jesus metaphorically explains that he came to this world, so that the blind may see. In the Christological context, the use of the title \\"Light of the World\\" is similar to the use of the title \\"Bread of Life\\" in John 6:35, where Jesus states: \\"I am the bread of life: he who comes to me shall not hunger.Christology in Context by Marinus de Jonge 1988 page 147 These assertions build on the Christological theme of John 5:26 where Jesus claims to possess life Just as the Father does and provide it to those who follow him. The term \\"Life of the World\\" is applied in the same sense by Jesus to himself in John 6:51. This application of \\"light compared with darkness\\" also appears in 1 John 1:5 which applies it to God and states: \\"God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.\\"John by H. A. Ironside 2006 pages 199-202 Jesus also used the term Light of the World to refer to his disciples, in Matthew 5:14: The term \\"Light of the World\\" is related to the parables of Salt and Light and Lamp under a bushel. =King of the Jews= The acronym INRI (Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews) written in three languages, as in John 19:20,Metamorphosis: the Transfiguration in Byzantine theology and iconography by Andreas Andreopoulos 2005 page 26 Ellwangen Abbey, Germany. In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the King of the Jews on three occasions, coming at the beginning of his life and at the end. Both uses of the title lead to dramatic results in the New Testament accounts. In the account of the Nativity of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, wise men (called the Magi) who come from the east call Jesus the \\"King of the Jews\\", causing King Herod to order the Massacre of the Innocents. In the accounts of the Passion of Jesus in all four Canonical Gospels, the use of the \\"King of the Jews\\" title leads to charges against Jesus that result in his Crucifixion.The Gospel of Matthew by R. T. France 2007 page 1048Studies in Early Christology by Martin Hengel 2004 page 46 The title \\"King of the Jews\\" is used only by the gentiles, namely by the Magi, Pontius Pilate and the Roman soldiers. In contrast the Jewish leaders in the Passion accounts prefer the designation \\"King of Israel\\", as in Matthew 27:42, Mark 15:32. The use of the term \\"King\\" in the charges brought against Jesus is central in the decision to crucify him. In John 19:12 Pilate seeks to release Jesus, but the Jews object, saying: \\"If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar\\" bringing the power of Caesar to the forefront of the discussion for the assumption of the title King implies rebellion against the Roman Empire. The final use of the title only appears in Luke 23:36-37. Here, after Jesus has carried the cross to Calvary and has been nailed to the cross, the soldiers look up on him on the cross, mock him, offer him vinegar and say: \\"If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.\\" In the parallel account in Matthew 27:42 the Jewish priests mock Jesus as \\"King of Israel\\", saying: \\"He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.\\"The Passion of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew by Donald Senior 1985 page 124 =Rabboni and Rabbi= Mary Magdalene calling Jesus Rabboni and receiving the response: Noli me Tangere, depicted by Antonio da Correggio, circa 1534. In John 20:16, when Mary Magdalene encounters Jesus shortly after the Resurrection, she calls him Rabbouni (·ø•Œ±Œ≤Œ≤ŒøœÖŒΩŒØ) literally my great [one] or (more extensively) my Teacher.Strong's Greek Concordance, no. G4461 and G4462 For those who do not speak Aramaic the Gospel of John translates this as \\"teacher\\", a Rabbi being a Jewish teacher, or master.The Gospel according to John by Colin G. Kruse 2004 page 378 In the New Testament, the term Rhabbouni is only used by the Magdalene here in John 20:16 and in Mark 10:51 by the blind man Bartimaeus in the account of the miracle of healing the blind near Jericho.The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary by Craig A. Evans 2003 page 376 The Rabbi title is used in several New Testament episodes to refer to Jesus, but more often in the Gospel of John than elsewhere and does not appear in the Gospel of Luke at all.Great Themes of the Bible, Volume 2 by Sarah S. Henrich 2007 page 18 In Matthew's account of the Last Supper (Matthew 26:22-25) when Jesus says that he will be betrayed by one of his Apostles, one after another the Apostles say \\"Surely it is not I, Lord\\" but Judas Iscariot says \\"Surely it is not I, Rabbi\\", using the term Rabbi instead of Lord.The place of Judas Iscariot in Christology by Anthony Cane 2005 page 35 The Iscariot again calls Jesus Rabbi in Matthew 26:49 when he betrays him in the Kiss of Judas episode, heavily implying he may never have acknowledged, believed, or understood the divinity of Jesus. In , Jesus affirms the term Rabbi and Father are not to be used for any man, but only for God and for Christ. Jesus is called Rabbi in conversation by Apostle Peter in Mark 9:5 and Mark 11:21, and by Judas Iscariot in Mark 14:45 by Nathanael in John 1:49, where he is also called the Son of God in the same sentence. On several occasions, the disciples also refer to Jesus as Rabbi in the Gospel of John, e.g. 4:31, 6:25, 9:2 and 11:8.Prophet and teacher: an introduction to the historical Jesus by William R. Herzog 2005 page 15 Intimating that the title Rabbi was used by status-seeking Pharisees (who \\"sit on the seat of Moses\\") and use the title as a sign of authority, in Matthew 23:1-8 Jesus rejected the title of Rabbi for his disciples, saying: \\"But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your teacher, and all ye are brethren\\".God with us by Mark Allan Powell 1995 pages 80-82 The role of teacher is also referred to the Paraclete, mentioned by Jesus for the first time on the night before the Crucifixion. =Other names and titles= The New Testament uses several titles to refer to Jesus. However, some terms that are commonly used in the Christian tradition rarely appear in the New Testament, e.g. the exact term \\"Savior\\" appears only once, and is uttered by the Samaritans in John 4:42.The theology of the Gospel of John by Dwight Moody Smith 1995 page 90 The title \\"Nazarene\\" applied to Jesus has been also used to designate Christians in Syriac and Arabic traditions. The title \\"Chosen one\\" or \\"Elect one\\" is used twice in Luke's gospel: eklektos is used in 23:35 when the rulers mock Jesus, while eklelegmenos is used in 9:35 when Jesus is baptized. James R. Edwards notes that the phrase is used repeatedly in 1 Enoch, but was associated in Jewish thinking with triumph and glory, rather than with suffering.

Schoot 1993 page 90 In John 8:58 Jesus says: \\"Before Abraham was born, I am.\\" The phrase \\"I am\\" (ŒµŒ≥œâ ŒµŒπŒºŒπ in Greek) was considered a name for Jesus by Aquinas who considered it the most proper of all divine names, for Aquinas believed it to refer to the \\"being of all things\\".Christ the 'name' of God: Thomas Aquinas on naming Christ by Henk J. M. Schoot 1993 page 157 One of the titles preceded by an \\"I am\\" assertion of Jesus is the \\"Bread of Life\\" title in John 6:35: \\"I am the bread of life: he who comes to me shall not hunger.\\" The Bread of Life Discourse takes place in the Gospel of John shortly after Jesus feeds the crowds with five loaves of bread and two fish.Who do you say that I am?: essays on Christology by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 page 83 In the Epistle to the Hebrews, Jesus is called an \\"Apostle\\" and a \\"High Priest\\" in 3:1, the preparation for the two titles being the preceding text of Hebrews 2:5-18 which present the two functions of Jesus: as an Apostle he represents God to humanity and as a High Priest he represents humanity to God.Hebrews David L. Allen 2010 page 240 While John's Gospel emphasizes Jesus as the Son of God, the Gospel of Luke depicts him as a prophet above all else, attributing that title to Jesus more often than even Mark.Themes of St. Luke by John Navone 1970 page 132 A prophet is not someone who merely preaches, but claims divine revelation through God. In Luke 4:24, following his hometown rejection, Jesus remarks that as a prophet he is not welcome in his own hometown. Elsewhere, in Luke 7:39 the Jews again doubt that Jesus is a prophet. The view of Jesus as a prophet is used in the concept of threefold office which sees his three roles as \\"Prophet, Priest and King\\".Evangelical Dictionary of Theology. Ed. Walter A. Elwell. (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2001). 858 While during early Christianity there were people claiming to be prophets, there are no records of anyone else claiming to be a prophet during the life of Jesus.The Gospel according to Matthew by Leon Morris 1992 page 270 In John 14:16 Jesus said he will ask the Father to send \\"another\\" paraclete, i.e. comforter.The Bible knowledge background commentary by Craig A. Evans 2005 page 128 The term paraclete only appears in Johannine literature and apart from the four uses in the Gospel of John it appears only in 1 John 2:1. Given that 1 John 2:1 views Jesus as a paraclete, the reference in John 14:16 states that Jesus sends a second paraclete to continue the life of the Church after his departure. The statement regarding the paraclete is made within the \\"farewell discourse\\" during the Last Supper of Jesus and the Apostles.John by Gail R. O'Day, Susan Hylen 2006 page 148 The paraclete is thus a link between the ministry of Jesus and the future life of the Church. Some titles of Jesus are unique to the Book of Revelation. He is referred to as \\"Faithful and True\\" in Revelation 19:11, the \\"Alpha and Omega\\" in Revelation 22:13 and elsewhere, and the \\"Morning Star\\" in Revelation 22:16.

The house has also been known as the Hermann Oelrichs House or the J. Edgar Monroe House. It was built by Theresa Fair Oelrichs, a silver heiress from Nevada, whose father James Graham Fair was one of the four partners in the Comstock Lode. She was the wife of Hermann Oelrichs, American agent for Norddeutscher Lloyd steamship line. She and her husband, together with her sister, Virginia Fair, bought the land in 1891 from the estate of George Bancroft and commissioned the architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White to design a summer home suitable for entertaining on a grand scale. With little opportunity to channel her considerable energy elsewhere, she \\"threw herself into the social scene with tremendous gusto, becoming, with Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish and Mrs. O.H.P. Belmont (of nearby Belcourt), one of the three great hostesses of Newport.\\" Ferguson 1977, p. 7) The principal architect, Stanford White, modeled the mansion after the Grand Trianon of Versailles, but smaller and reduced to a basic \\"H\\" shape, while keeping Mansart's scheme of a glazed arcade of arched windows and paired Ionic pilasters, which increase to columns across the central loggia. White's Rosecliff adds to the Grand Trianon a second storey with a balustraded roofline that conceals the set-back third storey, containing twenty small servants' rooms and the pressing room for the laundry. Construction and interiors The commission was given to McKim, Mead, and White in 1898, and the New York branch of Jules Allard and Sons were engaged as interior decorators. Construction started in 1899, but the sharp winter slowed construction; Mrs. Oelrichs' sister had married William K. Vanderbilt II that winter season, and the house was required for parties in the following Newport season; the eager Mrs. Oelrichs moved in July 1900, sending the workmen out in order to give a first party in August, a dinner for one hundred and twelve to outdo Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish's Harvest Festival Ball at Crossways. Ferns and floral arrangements concealed the unfinished areas. The house was not completed until 1902.

In the northernmost of the wings that project from both sides of the central block, is a dining room and a billiard room separated by a marble anteroom backed, on the service side, by a butler's pantry with two dumbwaiters. These communicate with the all-but-subterranean kitchens below which were lit, invisibly, from the sunken service yard on the north side of the house. The main entrance, on the opposite south wing, is through a vestibule where the exterior Ionic order is carried inside, now suitably enriched, under an emphatic cornice that divides the height 2:3. The vestibule is separated, by a tripartite screen with an arched central opening flanked above the cornice by bull's-eye openings in which baroque vases stand, from a grand Stair Hall. The Stair Hall projects from the south block to accommodate a grand staircase that sweeps forward through a heart-shaped opening into the floor space. This divides at a landing to return in matched recurving flights to the upper floor.\\"Its overall shape and splendid flow of mass and space probably owes something to the example of Richard Morris Hunt's staircase in The Breakers and, ultimately, to the great staircase that the German architect Balthasar Neumann designed for the prince-archbishop's palace at Br√ºhl in 1741\\".

The most famous of Mrs. Oelrich's parties was the \\"Bal blanc\\" of 19 August 1904 to celebrate the Astor Cup Races, in which everything was white and silver. Mrs. Oelrich died at Newport on November 22, 1926. The funeral took place in the \\"beautiful blue and gold tapestry room\\" at Rosecliff. =Monroe family= Hermann Oelrichs, Jr. kept Rosecliff in the family until 1941, then the estate went through several changes of ownership before being bought by Mr & Mrs J. Edgar Monroe of New Orleans in 1947. Mr. Monroe, a southern gentleman who had made his fortune in the ship building industry, came to Newport with his wife Louise every summer to escape the summer heat of the Deep South. The two became well known for the large parties they threw at Rosecliff; many of which had a mardi gras theme, as the Monroes loved dressing up in fancy costumes for these parties. Unlike Mrs. Oelrichs' parties, which were stiff and formal, the Monroes' parties were relaxed and easygoing. Hermann Oelrichs Jr. sold off all the furnishings in 1941. In 1971, Mr. and Mrs. Monroe donated the entire estate with its contents and a $2 million operating endowment to the Preservation Society of Newport County, who opened it to the public for tours. Mr. Monroe often would come back to the estate for charity events up until his death in 1991. The American Beauty Rose was developed by earlier owner of the property George Bancroft and his gardener.

Historically in Lancashire, it lies between Walton and Maghull on the A59 road, about north-east of Liverpool city centre, in North West England. It is best known as the site of Aintree Racecourse, which since the 19th century has staged the Grand National horserace. During the 1950s and 1960s, there was also a three-mile-long international Grand Prix motor racing circuit on the site, which used the same grandstands as the horserace. A shorter form of the racing circuit is still used for various motorsport events. The northern end of Aintree is known as Old Roan. History The name Aintree, thought to be of Saxon origin, means \\"one tree\\" or \\"tree standing alone.\\" It is first recorded in 1226, also as Ayntre (the usual mediaeval spelling) in 1292. Eyntre occurs; Ayntree and Ayntrie, 16th century.William Farrer & J. Brownbill (editors), A History of the County of Lancaster (Volume 3). Institute of Historical Research, 1907. pp99-101. Local legend held that an oak tree on Bull Bridge Lane (removed in 2004) was \\"the Ain tree\\" though the antiquity of the name excludes the possibility. The historic core of the village was a small linear settlement near the junction of School Lane, Bull Bridge Lane and Wango Lane. Much of the nearby flat, wet and boggy land was reclaimed for agriculture following the Alt Drainage Act of 1779. Today The village itself has two primary schools, Aintree Davenhill and Holy Rosary and a Music School; five churches, St. Giles (Anglican), Holy Rosary (Roman Catholic), Old Roan Methodist Church, Old Roan Baptist Church (which met in Davenhill Primary School until recently and now meets at the former site of Holy Rosary Infants School) and Aintree Village Family Church (a Baptist church, meeting at Old Roan Methodist Church Hall, Altway); two small local shopping areas (on Altway and at the Old Roan); and three public houses, the Blue Anchor (which backs onto the Leeds and Liverpool Canal), The Valentine, named after a fence on the racecourse, and the Old Roan (now closed), which gives its name to a railway station in the village. The village also had a public library (now closed). A retail park along Ormskirk Road on former industrial land has brought a significant number of major out-of-town shops to the area. Aintree Davenhill Primary School has a large field with a metal building that was built in the 1950s (since been rebuilt). The building was going to be a hospital building, but was turned into a school. The classrooms were along corridors that were originally going to be hospital wards. Holy Rosary Primary School was a split-site school until 2008 with an approximate between the schools. The reception and infant classes were based at a site at the Old Roan end of the village between Altway and Aintree Lane, and the junior classes based at the Valentine end of the village in the Oriel Drive site. After substantial building work to extend the Oriel Drive school, the Aintree Lane/Altway site was closed as a school at the beginning of the 2008‚Äì09 academic year, was taken over by Old Roan Baptist Church and is now called the Hope Centre, providing various services for the local community. The school has a large field used for events such as their sports day and an all-weather sports pitch. The original building was built in the 1970s and 1980s. Transport The main road from Liverpool to Aintree is the A59 (known as Ormskirk Road as it passes through Aintree) - with the road passing through Aintree's retail parks. The M57, M58, A59, and A5036 meet at a complex junction called Switch Island, between Aintree and Maghull. Although Aintree railway station is convenient for the racecourse, the village itself is closer to Old Roan railway station. Both are on the Merseyrail Northern Line's Ormskirk branch, with regular service between Liverpool Central and Ormskirk. In the past, it was also served by Aintree Central railway station on the North Liverpool Extension Line, located behind Aintree railway station. The North Mersey Branch also ran through, close to the station, and had Aintree Racecourse railway station. Bus services are regular: a bus every 20 minutes to Liverpool runs through the village, while various other routes to Liverpool and destinations to the north--including Maghull, Ormskirk, and Southport-- stop near the Old Roan. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs through the village.

If it turns into marriage, it is a type of marriage of convenience. Etymology and usage Judge, 24 Jul 1920) The term gold-digger was a slang term that has its roots among chorus girls and sex workers in the early 20th century. In print, the term can be found in Rex Beach's 1911 book, The Ne'er-Do-Well, and in the 1915 memoir My Battles with Vice by Virginia Brooks. The Oxford Dictionary and Random House's Dictionary of Historical Slang state the term is distinct to women because they were much more likely to need to marry a wealthy man in order to achieve or maintain a level of socio-economic status. The term gold digger rose in usage following the popularity of Avery Hopwood‚Äôs play The Gold Diggers in 1919. Hopwood first heard the term gold digger in a conversation with Ziegfeld performer Kay Laurell. As an indication of the newness of the slang term, Broadway producers urged him to change the title because they worried that the audience would think that the play was about mining and the Gold Rush. Society and culture =General= Several women were perceived as exemplars of the gold digger stereotype by the public. The best known gold digger of the early 20th century was Peggy Hopkins Joyce. Joyce was a former show girl who married and divorced millionaires. She was characterized as a gold digger during her divorce battle with Stanley Joyce during the early 1920s. Some have argued that she was the real-life inspiration for Lorelei Lee, the protagonist in Anita Loos‚Äô 1925 gold digger novel Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and some have contended that the term gold digger was coined to describe her. Former Olympian Eleanor Holm was dubbed the \\"swimming gold digger\\" for her divorce contest with Broadway impresario Billy Rose during the 1950s. The press and public described model and actor Anna Nicole Smith as a gold digger for marrying multi-millionaire octogenarian J. Howard Marshall III. = Law = Sharon Thompson's research has demonstrated how the gold digger stereotype or image has been used against women in the negotiation of alimony cases. The gold digger stereotype was also deployed in public discussions about \\"heartbalm\\" legislation during the 1930s, particularly breach of promise cases. The popularity of the gold digger image was a contributing factor to the nationwide push to outlaw heart balm laws in the middle and late-1930s in the United States. Popular culture =Film= The gold digger emerged as a dominant trope in American popular culture beginning in the 1920s. Stephen Sharot stated that the gold digger supplanted the popularity of the vamp in 1920s cinema. By the 1930s, the term gold digger had reached the United Kingdom because British film industry made a remake of The Gold Diggers. While the film has been disliked by critics, several sequels with the same title have been made. In the 1930s, the gold digger trope was used in a number of popular American movies, most notably Gold Diggers of 1933, Gold Diggers of 1935, Baby Face, Red-Headed Woman, Dinner at Eight, and Havana Widows. Film historian Roger Dooley notes that the gold digger is one of the most common of the ‚Äústock company of stereotypes that continually reappear in the films of the 1930s.‚Äù Gold diggers in 1930s cinema were often portrayed in positive, sometimes heroic, ways. The character has featured in many films since the 1930s such as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) and How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), both starring Marilyn Monroe, or as a villainous foil, as in both versions of Disney's film The Parent Trap. =Music= The gold digger image or trope appears in several popular songs, including \\"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\\" (1938), \\"Diamonds Are a Girl‚Äôs Best Friend\\" (1949), \\"Santa Baby\\" (1953), \\"She Got the Goldmine (I Got The Shaft)\\" (1982), and \\"Material Girl\\" (1984). Rap music's use of the \\"gold digger script\\" is one of a few prevalent sexual scripts that is directed at young African-American women. For example Kanye West's \\"Gold Digger\\" and EPMD's \\"Gold Digger\\" both references a woman marrying for perceived wealth.

Describing her early years and modeling career, Buell said, \\"[I wanted] to be a professional singer [which was why] I came to New York‚Äîyes, I was a pretty young girl, so I fell into the modeling thing, and [then] I did Playboy, so then the rock stars came a-hunting, as I like to say.\\" =Music= In 1981 Buell recorded a four-song EP on Rhino Records, produced by Rick Derringer and Ric Ocasek, with the Cars serving as her band on two tracks. The rock band the Power Station began in 1984 when her then-boyfriend John Taylor (of Duran Duran fame) pulled some famous friends together to provide backing for another of Buell's musical efforts. She also formed the band the B-Sides in 1980; it disbanded in 1985. In 1985 Buell started another band, the Gargoyles, and released a couple of singles. A few large record companies showed interest, but the Gargoyles disbanded when Liv Tyler's paternity became public in 1991. Buell withdrew from performing for six years in the 1990s. She managed Liv's career as an international model and actress. She also represented actress Charis Michelsen. After Liv left home in 1997, Buell recorded a solo effort with producer Don Fleming, released in 2000. She also performed around New York with the Bebe Buell Band and later with Boston musicians the Rudds and the Neighborhoods' drummer Johnny Lynch, forming a new band for a few shows that also included her husband, James Wallerstein. In May 2009 Buell released her first recording in ten years, the single \\"Air Kisses for the Masses\\". She then recorded a 12-song album that can be downloaded on iTunes or Amazon MP3. Buell played a series of live shows in the New York City area to promote the single. In September 2011 Buell released Hard Love, an aggressive rock album influenced by grunge and glam rock.

On July 1, 1977, Buell gave birth to future actress/model Liv Tyler, but Buell initially named her child Liv Rundgren and claimed that Todd Rundgren was the biological father to protect the child from Tyler's drug addiction. Rundgren and Buell ended their romantic relationship shortly after Liv's birth. At age nine, Liv found out that she was Steven Tyler's biological daughter. In 1992, Buell married for the first time.

One girl who went by the nickname Penny Lane is real-life Pennie Lane Trumbull, born in Portland, Oregon, in 1954.

He holds a doctorate in international politics and serves Morocco as a diplomat. He is currently second in the line of succession to the Moroccan throne. Early life and education Prince Moulay Rachid is the second son and fifth child of King Hassan II and his wife, Lalla Latifa Hammou. Prince Moulay Rachid has one older brother, King Mohammed VI, and three sisters, Princess Lalla Meryem, Princess Lalla Asma and Princess Lalla Hasna. After primary and secondary studies at the Royal College in Rabat and obtaining the Baccalaur√©at in June 1989, he entered Mohammed V University in Rabat to start his higher studies in Law. In May 1993, Prince Moulay Rachid obtained his Bachelor of Law (LL.B.) majoring in economic and social law. The same year the Prince received his License to Practice Law ‚Äì Public Law. On 29 June 1995, the Prince completed his graduate studies and received a Master of Law (LL.M.) in Political Science. The Bosnia question was the subject of his research and the thesis that the Prince presented and supported publicly. In order to complete his training for his postgraduate education, in November 1993, the Prince started an internship with the United Nations in New York. On 18 May 2001, the Prince presented his doctorate thesis on the Organisation of the Islamic Conference at the Universit√© Montesquieu-Bordeaux IV, which merited a specific mention for the quality of his work. On 21 June 1996, the Prince successfully completed the written and oral tests for his postgraduate education and received a postgraduate Degree in International Relations. =As heir to the Moroccan throne= In 1999, after the death of his father and the enthronement of his brother King Mohammed VI, the prince became crown prince, but in 2003, this position was granted to his newborn nephew Moulay Hassan. The Prince is now second in line to the throne. In 1999, a few analysts like Nicolas Beau and Catherine Graciet argued that Moulay Rachid might be better suited for the job of the king than his brother. They expressed their concern that Mohammed VI might not have adequate expertise to deal with militant Islamists.  Fouad Mourtada controversy On 5 February 2008, Fouad Mourtada was arrested on suspicion of stealing the identity of Moulay Rachid by creating a fake profile on Facebook as a joke. Although the prince did not seek to press charges, on 23 February, Fouad Mourtada was sentenced to three years in jail and fined 10,000 dirhams (~1,350 USD). After local protests and international criticism, Fouad Mourtada was granted a royal pardon on 19 March 2008 just days before an appeal hearing.Morocco 'Facebook prince' pardon, BBC News, 19 March 2008.

His parents brought him to Texas in June 1838 and he grew up in San Antonio during the Republic. In two volumes of memoirs, he recounted his memories of the Council House Fight in 1840 (in which the family's cook saved his life), the evacuation of the city during the incursion by Gen. Rafael V√°squez in 1842, and his father's return from the prison at Perote, Veracruz, in 1843. Maverick's early education was provided by tutors, and he later attended several local private schools. In 1856, he traveled to Scotland to attend the University of Edinburgh, from which he graduated, probably in 1859. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Maverick enlisted in Company B of the First Texas Mounted Rifles under Col. Henry E. McCulloch, but the unit saw insufficient action to satisfy him. In May 1862, he joined Company G of the 8th Texas Infantry, commanded by Col. Benjamin F. Terry and known as Terry's Texas Rangers, with whom he saw action throughout the South. At Fort Donelson, Tennessee, he swam the Cumberland River and set fire to a Union gunboat, for which feat he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant. After the war, Maverick returned to San Antonio, where he farmed on the land that now makes up Brackenridge Park, north of downtown. In 1867, he passed the state bar examination. He subsequently ran a series of businesses, including a lumberyard and several stores. In 1884 he built the Maverick Bank at the corner of East Houston Street and Alamo Plaza, but the bank failed in 1892. He retired from active business in 1906. He was long involved in preservation efforts at the Alamo, and in 1888, he contributed $10,000 toward the construction of the Alamo Monument. In 1889, he escorted the Belknap Rifles, a local volunteer military company, to New York to participate in the centennial of the founding of Manhattan. He also donated land to the city which was named Maverick Park in his honor. Samuel Maverick married Sallie Frost, May 14, 1871, in San Antonio and they had six children. He died in Austin February 27, 1936, at the age of ninety-eight, the last survivor of Terry's Texas Rangers, and was buried at Mission Burial Park in San Antonio.

The game is set during the French Revolution, and was released on Bastille Day in 1998. The goal is to collect the heads of Nobles, accumulating points. Despite the grim topic of the game, the artwork is comical and the tone light. Overview Game play, for two to five players, takes approximately 30 minutes. Game equipment consists of two decks of cards, \\"Nobles\\" and \\"Actions\\", and a small cardboard structure representing the guillotine itself. This is mostly symbolic, though it can serve as a convenient indicator of the direction of the \\"line\\" of face-up Noble cards played on the game table representing condemned persons waiting to be beheaded. The Nobles cards carry points values and are collected by players after execution, while Action cards allow the player to perform various acts including rearranging the order of Nobles approaching the guillotine, stealing Nobles or Action cards from other players, enhancing the point values of certain categories of Nobles (see \\"Noble Types\\" below) and so forth. Gameplay The game is divided into three rounds or \\"days\\". Each day, twelve noble cards are dealt face-up in a row to be executed. A player's turn consists of: # Playing an Action card. This is optional. # Collecting the Noble card at the front of the line. # Drawing an Action card from the deck. Noble types The Nobles come in five categories, each with its own color border: * Church (blue) * Military (red) * Royal (purple) * Negative (grey) * Civic (green) Grey nobles, typically martyrs that have public sympathy, are worth negative points so the player's goal is to avoid collecting them if possible. Palace guards, in the red category, have a special value in that each guard is worth the total number of guards collected. Thus one guard is worth one point, two guards are worth four points, three guards are worth nine points and so forth. The other Nobles have values ranging from 1 to 5 points. A typical turn example is a player using an Action card to move a Noble two places forward in the line, i.e. advance a high-point Noble from third position to first, collecting that Noble, then drawing another Action card to end the turn. Other Action cards allow the player to move a Noble one or more places backward, useful for moving a low- or negative-value card off the front of the line to collect a higher-value second-position Noble. Certain Noble cards affect the game, including a \\"Fast Noble\\" requiring the player who collects it to also take the next Noble in line. A card symbolizing Maximilien Robespierre (beheaded in 1794) causes the \\"day\\" to instantly end upon his decapitation. At the end of a \\"day\\" of gameplay (either by the collection of the Robespierre card or the exhaustion of the line), a new line of Nobles is dealt face-up and play resumes. After three \\"days\\", the player with the highest point total wins. Strategy The key to winning the game is to manage which Nobles one collects through careful use of action cards while forcing other players to collect low- or negative-scoring Nobles. Some Action cards allow a player to prolong the \\"day\\" (by adding new Nobles to the line), shorten it by allowing Nobles to \\"escape,\\" or end it, by playing the \\"Scarlet Pimpernel\\" action card. Availability After several years of Guillotine being out of print, Wizards re-released the game in 2005 alongside The Great Dalmuti, another Wizards card game. In addition to being reprinted, Guillotine was featured as one of the playable games in Gleemax Games Alpha on the Gleemax website. Reception The reviewer from the online second volume of Pyramid stated that \\"Take France in the late 1700s. Add a large helping of various and sundry mostly useless nobility. Stir in a group of disaffected common citizens with no real political power. Then toss in a pinch of Professor Guillotine and agitate vigorously. Garnish with extremely amusing art and you have Guillotine, the hilarious new card game from Wizards of the Coast about trying to get a head.\\" Guillotine won the 1998 Origins Award for Best Traditional Card Game.

The two major thromboxanes are thromboxane A2 and thromboxane B2. The distinguishing feature of thromboxanes is a 6-membered ether-containing ring. Thromboxane is named for its role in clot formation (thrombosis). Production Enzymes and substrates associated with thromoboxane and prostacyclin synthesis. Eicosanoid synthesis. Thromboxane-A synthase, an enzyme found in platelets, converts the arachidonic acid derivative prostaglandin H2 to thromboxane. Mechanism Thromboxane acts by binding to any of the thromboxane receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors coupled to the G protein Gq.Rat kidney thromboxane receptor: molecular cloning, signal ... Functions Thromboxane is a vasoconstrictor and a potent hypertensive agent, and it facilitates platelet aggregation. It is in homeostatic balance in the circulatory system with prostacyclin, a related compound. The mechanism of secretion of thromboxanes from platelets is still unclear. They act in the formation of blood clots and reduce blood flow to the site of a clot. If the cap of a vulnerable plaque erodes or ruptures, as in myocardial infarction, platelets stick to the damaged lining of the vessel and to each other within seconds and form a plug. These \\"Sticky platelets\\" secrete several chemicals, including thromboxane A2 that stimulate vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow at the site. Role of A2 in platelet aggregation Thromboxane A2 (TXA2), produced by activated platelets, has prothrombotic properties, stimulating activation of new platelets as well as increasing platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation is achieved by mediating expression of the glycoprotein complex GP IIb/IIIa in the cell membrane of platelets. Circulating fibrinogen binds these receptors on adjacent platelets, further strengthening the clot. Pathology It is believed that the vasoconstriction caused by thromboxanes plays a role in Prinzmetal's angina. Omega-3 fatty acids are metabolized to produce higher levels of TxA,3 which is relatively less potent than TxA2 and PGI3; therefore, there is a balance shift toward inhibition of vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. It is believed that this shift in balance lowers the incidence of myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke. Vasoconstriction and, perhaps, various proinflammatory effects exerted by TxA on tissue microvasculature, is probable reason why the TxA is pathogenic in various diseases, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury., hepatic inflammatory processes, acute hepatotoxicity etc. TxB2, a stable degradation product of TxA2, plays a role in acute hepatoxicity induced by acetaminophen. Inhibitors Thromboxane inhibitors are broadly classified as either those that inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane, or those that inhibit the target effect of it. Thromboxane synthesis inhibitors, in turn, can be classified regarding which step in the synthesis they inhibit: *The widely used drug aspirin acts by inhibiting the ability of the COX enzyme to synthesize the precursors of thromboxane within platelets. Low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. This anticoagulant property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks. American Heart Association: Aspirin in Heart Attack and Stroke Prevention \\"The American Heart Association recommends aspirin use for patients who've had a myocardial infarction (heart attack), unstable angina, ischemic stroke (caused by blood clot) or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs or \\"little strokes\\"), if not contraindicated. This recommendation is based on sound evidence from clinical trials showing that aspirin helps prevent the recurrence of such events as heart attack, hospitalization for recurrent angina, second strokes, etc. (secondary prevention). Studies show aspirin also helps prevent these events from occurring in people at high risk (primary prevention).\\" 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition. *Thromboxane synthase inhibitors inhibit the final enzyme (thromboxane synthase) in the synthesis of thromboxane. Ifetroban is a potent and selective thromboxane receptor antagonist. Dipyridamole antagonizes this receptor too, but has various other mechanisms of antiplatelet activity as well. *High-dose naproxen can induce near-complete suppression of platelet thromboxane throughout the dosing interval and appears not to increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, whereas other high-dose NSAID (non- steroidal-anti-inflammatory) regimens have only transient effects on platelet COX-1 and have been found to be associated \\"with a small but definite vascular hazard\\". The inhibitors of the target effects of thromboxane are the thromboxane receptor antagonist, including terutroban. Picotamide has activity both as a thromboxane synthase inhibitor and as a thromboxane receptor antagonist. Ridogrel is another example. And there are other inhibitors References External links * Category:Eicosanoids ","title":"Thromboxane"},{"id":"900733","text":"Plasma oscillations, also known as Langmuir waves (after Irving Langmuir), are rapid oscillations of the electron density in conducting media such as plasmas or metals in the ultraviolet region. The oscillations can be described as an instability in the dielectric function of a free electron gas. The frequency only depends weakly on the wavelength of the oscillation. The quasiparticle resulting from the quantization of these oscillations is the plasmon. Langmuir waves were discovered by American physicists Irving Langmuir and Lewi Tonks in the 1920s. They are parallel in form to Jeans instability waves, which are caused by gravitational instabilities in a static medium.  Mechanism  Consider an electrically neutral plasma in equilibrium, consisting of a gas of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. If one displaces by a tiny amount an electron or a group of electrons with respect to the ions, the Coulomb force pulls the electrons back, acting as a restoring force. = 'Cold' electrons = If the thermal motion of the electrons is ignored, it is possible to show that the charge density oscillates at the plasma frequency : \\\\omega_{\\\\mathrm{pe}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n_\\\\mathrm{e} e^{2}}{m^*\\\\varepsilon_0}}, \\\\left[\\\\mathrm{rad/s}\\\\right] (SI units), :\\\\omega_{\\\\mathrm{pe}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{4 \\\\pi n_\\\\mathrm{e} e^{2}}{m^*}}, \\\\left[\\\\mathrm{rad/s}\\\\right] (cgs units), where n_\\\\mathrm{e} is the number density of electrons, e is the electric charge, m^* is the effective mass of the electron, and \\\\varepsilon_0 is the permittivity of free space. Note that the above formula is derived under the approximation that the ion mass is infinite. This is generally a good approximation, as the electrons are so much lighter than ions. Proof using maxwell equations Given the continuity equation: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{j} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t},\\\\mathbf{j} = \\\\Re\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{j} e^{-i\\\\omega t}\\\\right), abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{j}(\\\\omega) = i \\\\omega \\\\rho(\\\\omega) the Gauss law : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\omega) = 4 \\\\pi \\\\rho(\\\\omega) and the conductivity : \\\\mathbf{j}(\\\\omega) = \\\\sigma(\\\\omega) \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\omega) it remains: : i \\\\omega \\\\rho(\\\\omega) = 4 \\\\pi \\\\sigma(\\\\omega) \\\\rho(\\\\omega) which is always true only if : 1+ \\\\frac {4 \\\\pi i \\\\sigma(\\\\omega)}{\\\\omega} = 0 But this is also the dielectric constant (see Drude Model) \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) = 1+ \\\\frac {4 \\\\pi i \\\\sigma(\\\\omega)}{\\\\omega} and the condition of transparency (i.e. \\\\epsilon \\\\ge 0 from a certain plasma frequency \\\\omega_p and above), the same condition here \\\\epsilon = 0 apply to make possible also the propagation of density waves in the charge density. This expression must be modified in the case of electron-positron plasmas, often encountered in astrophysics. Since the frequency is independent of the wavelength, these oscillations have an infinite phase velocity and zero group velocity. Note that, when m^*=m_\\\\mathrm{e}, the plasma frequency, \\\\omega_{\\\\mathrm{pe}}, depends only on physical constants and electron density n_\\\\mathrm{e}. The numeric expression for angular plasma frequency is :f_\\\\text{pe} = \\\\frac{\\\\omega_\\\\text{pe}}{2\\\\pi}~\\\\left[\\\\text{Hz}\\\\right] Metals are only transparent to light with a frequency higher than the metal's plasma frequency. For typical metals such as aluminium or silver, n_\\\\mathrm{e} is approximately 1023 cm‚àí3, which brings the plasma frequency into the ultraviolet region. This is why most metals reflect visible light and appear shiny. = 'Warm' electrons = When the effects of the electron thermal speed v_{\\\\mathrm{e,th}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{k_\\\\mathrm{B} T_{\\\\mathrm{e}}}{m_\\\\mathrm{e}}} are taken into account, the electron pressure acts as a restoring force as well as the electric field and the oscillations propagate with frequency and wavenumber related by the longitudinal Langmuir* wave: : \\\\omega^2 =\\\\omega_{\\\\mathrm{pe}}^2 +\\\\frac{3k_\\\\mathrm{B}T_{\\\\mathrm{e}}}{m_\\\\mathrm{e}}k^2=\\\\omega_{\\\\mathrm{pe}}^2 + 3 k^2 v_{\\\\mathrm{e,th}}^2 , called the Bohm‚ÄìGross dispersion relation. If the spatial scale is large compared to the Debye length, the oscillations are only weakly modified by the pressure term, but at small scales the pressure term dominates and the waves become dispersionless with a speed of \\\\sqrt{3} \\\\cdot v_{\\\\mathrm{e,th}}. For such waves, however, the electron thermal speed is comparable to the phase velocity, i.e., : v \\\\sim v_{\\\\mathrm{ph}} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{k}, so the plasma waves can accelerate electrons that are moving with speed nearly equal to the phase velocity of the wave. This process often leads to a form of collisionless damping, called Landau damping. Consequently, the large-k portion in the dispersion relation is difficult to observe and seldom of consequence. In a bounded plasma, fringing electric fields can result in propagation of plasma oscillations, even when the electrons are cold. In a metal or semiconductor, the effect of the ions' periodic potential must be taken into account. This is usually done by using the electrons' effective mass in place of m.

First edition: 1987; Pbk.  History  Ptolemy mentioned a place by the name 'Tabawa', at the northwestern corner of Arabia. This name may be a reference to 'Tabuka' or 'Tabuk'. If this is true, the town may be as old as Ptolemy's time. Pre- Islamic Arab poets, such as Antra and Nabiqa, mentioned its mountain 'Hasmi' in their poems. Tabouk became famous for the Expedition to Tabuk in 8 AH (630 CE), during the period of prophet Muhammad. Since then, it remained a gateway of North Arabia. It was also visited by a number of European travelers such as Doughty in 1294 AH (1877 CE) and Huber in 1303 AH (1884 CE). Tabuk became a centre of military activity during the 1991 Gulf War as the city faced threats from Iraqi scuds and air attacks. = Archaeological or historical sites in the area = The region is rich in antiquities and archaeological sites such as petroglyphs, inscriptions, forts, palaces, walls, Syrian-Egyptian pilgrimage route, and the remains of the Hejaz Railway line, the main station of which is located in Tabuk.  Rock art and inscriptions' site in Wadi Dam  Hundreds of localities with Rock art and inscriptions dating to different chronological periods and ranging from Paleolithic to the Islamic period were recorded at Wadi Dam and the region west of Tabuk. Study of the art revealed rich stylistic variability and both human and animal figures were represented in it. Tens of sites in the area with Thamudic, Greek and Nabataean inscriptions have been found.  Tabuk Castle  It is also known as the castle of A·π£-·∏•ƒÅb al-Aykah (, \\"Companions of the Wood\\"), who are mentioned in the Quran. The castle dates back to about 3500 BCE and has been restored many times; the last was in 1062 AH (1652 CE). It was one of the several forts and stations built along the Syrian pilgrimage route to welcome pilgrims. Several forts and stations were built along the road from the Jordanian border to Al- Medinah to welcome the pilgrims. The fort consists of two floors. The first floor contains an open courtyard and a number of rooms, a mosque, a well, and a stairway leading to the watch towers used by the guards. The fort is considered an archaeological landmark of the region and is open to visitors.  Ain Sukkrah  This is an ancient ‚Äòayn (, 'spring') dating to the Era of Jahiliyyah (, 'Ignorance'). It is said that during the expedition of Tabuk, Muhammad camped more than ten days near the spring and drank from its water.  The Prophet's Mosque in Tabuk  It is also known as the Repentance Mosque. It was originally built with mud and roofed with palm trunk trees. It was restored in 1062 AH (1652 CE). Eventually, its complete renewal was ordered by the late King Faisal ibn Abdul-Aziz, along the pattern of the Prophet's Mosque in Al-Medinah.

She worked for John Lennon and Yoko Ono as a personal assistant and production coordinator, and when Lennon and Ono separated in 1973, Pang and Lennon began a relationship that lasted more than 18 months. Lennon later referred to this time as his \\"Lost Weekend.\\" Pang subsequently produced two books about their relationship - a memoir called Loving John (Warner, 1983) and a book of photographs, Instamatic Karma (St. Martin's Press, 2008). Pang was married to producer Tony Visconti from 1989 to 2000 and has two children. Early years Pang was born in Manhattan, New York City, New York. She is the daughter of Chinese immigrants and grew up in New York's Spanish Harlem with an elder sister and an adopted brother, both of whom were born in China. Pang's mother had a laundry business in the area. The Pang family left when the tenements where they lived were scheduled to be razed, and moved to an apartment near 97th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan. After graduating from Saint Michael Academy, Pang attended New York City Community College. She wanted to be a model, but the modeling agencies told her that she was too \\"ethnic\\". Pang's early jobs included being a song-plugger, which meant encouraging artists to record them. In 1970, she began work in New York as a receptionist at ABKCO Records, Allen Klein's management office, which at that time represented Apple Records and three former Beatles: Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Pang was asked to help Lennon and Ono with their avant-garde film projects, Up Your Legs Forever and Fly, in December 1970. Pang was then asked to be Lennon and Ono's secretary and factotum/gofer in New York and Britain, which led to a permanent position as their personal assistant when the Lennons moved from London to New York in 1971. Pang coordinated an art exhibition in Syracuse, New York, on October 9, 1971, for Ono's This Is Not Here art show at the Everson Museum. Ono's show coincided with Lennon's 31st birthday, and a party was held at the Hotel Syracuse, which was attended by Ringo Starr, Phil Spector, and Elliot Mintz, among others. \\"Lost Weekend\\" At the time Lennon had his 18-month relationship with Pang. He was in a period of his life that he would later refer to as being his \\"Lost Weekend\\", in reference to the film and novel of the same title. In mid-1973, Pang was working on the recording of Lennon's Mind Games album. Lennon and Ono were having marital problems and decided to separate, and Ono suggested to Pang that she become Lennon's companion. Ono explained that she and Lennon were not getting along, had been arguing and were growing apart, and said that Lennon would start seeing other women. She pointed out that Lennon had said he found Pang sexually attractive. Pang replied that she could never start a relationship with Lennon as he was her employer and married. Ono ignored Pang's protests and said that she would arrange everything. Ono later confirmed this conversation in an interview. In October 1973, Lennon and Pang left New York for Los Angeles to promote Mind Games, and decided to stay for a while, living at the homes of friends. While there, Lennon was inspired to embark on two recording projects: to make an album of the old rock 'n' roll songs that inspired him to become a musician, and to produce another artist. In December 1973, Lennon collaborated with Phil Spector to record the oldies album, Rock 'n' Roll. The alcohol-fueled recording sessions became legendary. Every musician in L.A. wanted to participate, but soon Lennon's drinking and Spector's erratic behavior (which included his firing a gun in the studio control room) caused the sessions to break down. Then Spector, who claimed to have been in a car accident, took the sessions tapes and was unreachable. In March 1974, Lennon began producing Harry Nilsson's Pussy Cats album, thus named to counter the \\"bad boy\\" image the pair had earned in the media with two drinking incidents at The Troubadour: the first when Lennon placed a Kotex on his forehead and scuffled with a waitress at a concert given by Ann Peebles, who at the time had released one of Lennon's favorite records, 'I Can't Stand The Rain' and, two weeks later, when Lennon and Nilsson were ejected from the same club after heckling the Smothers Brothers. Lennon thought it would be a good idea for the musicians to live under one roof to ensure they would get to the studio on time, so Pang rented a beach house in Santa Monica, for her, Lennon, Nilsson, Ringo Starr and Keith Moon to live in. At this time, Pang encouraged Lennon to reach out to family and friends. He and Paul McCartney mended fences and played together for the first and only time after the breakup of the Beatles (see A Toot and a Snore in '74). Pang also arranged for Julian Lennon to visit his father for the first time in almost four years. Julian began to see his father more regularly. Lennon bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and a drum machine for Christmas in 1973, and encouraged Julian's interest in music by showing him some chords. \\"Dad and I got on a great deal better then,\\" recalls Julian. \\"We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general when he was with May Pang. My memories of that time with Dad and May are very clear‚Äîthey were the happiest time I can remember with them.\\" In June 1974, Lennon and Pang returned to live in Manhattan. Lennon stopped drinking and concentrated on recording. Lennon previously had cats while he lived at his Aunt Mimi's house in Liverpool; he and Pang adopted two cats that they named Major and Minor. In the early summer, Lennon was working on his Walls and Bridges album when the couple moved into a penthouse apartment at 434 East 52nd Street. On August 23, Lennon and Pang claimed to have seen a UFO from their terrace, which had a panoramic view of Queens. To gain access to the deck, Lennon and Pang had to climb out of their kitchen window. On the night in question, a naked Lennon excitedly called Pang to join him on the deck outside and they both watched a circular object silently floating less than 100 feet away. Lennon called Bob Gruen‚ÄîLennon's \\"official\\" photographer‚Äîand told him what had happened. Gruen suggested Lennon should call the police, but Lennon laughed it off, saying, \\"I‚Äôm not going to call up the newspaper and say, 'This is John Lennon and I saw a flying saucer last night.'\\" Gruen called the local police precinct which confirmed that three other people had reported a sighting, and the Daily News said that five people had reported a sighting in the same area of New York where Lennon and Pang lived. Lennon references the incident in the song, \\"Nobody Told Me\\". Walls and Bridges rose to the top spot on the album charts. Lennon achieved his only number-one solo US single in his lifetime with \\"Whatever Gets You Thru the Night\\". Pang's is the voice whispering Lennon's name on \\"#9 Dream\\". Another song, \\"Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox)\\", was written about her. Julian played drums on the album's last track, \\"Ya Ya\\". While recording Walls and Bridges, Al Coury, vice president of promotion for Capitol Records, got possession of the chaotic Spector session tapes and brought them to New York. Lennon would complete his oldies album, which would be called Rock 'n' Roll, with the same musicians he used on Walls and Bridges. Pang received an RIAA gold record award for her work on Walls and Bridges and continued her work as production coordinator of Lennon's Rock 'n' Roll album, where she was credited as \\"Mother Superior\\". Pang also worked on albums by Nilsson, Starr, Elton John and David Bowie. While visiting Mick Jagger at Andy Warhol's compound in Montauk, New York, Lennon and Pang saw a Scottish-style cottage for sale close to the Montauk Point Lighthouse. Lennon asked a real estate broker to put in an offer for it in February 1975. In the same month, Lennon and Pang were also planning on visiting Paul and Linda McCartney in New Orleans, where Wings were recording the Venus and Mars album, but Lennon reconciled with Ono the day before the planned visit, after Ono said she had a new cure for Lennon's smoking habit. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang he had reconciled with Ono and their relationship was over. Over the coming years, Pang quietly met Lennon a few times but their relationship was never rekindled. Lennon would lament this period publicly but not in private. Journalist Larry Kane, who befriended Lennon in 1964, wrote a comprehensive biography of Lennon which detailed the \\"Lost Weekend\\" period. In the interview with Kane, Lennon explained his feelings about his time with Pang: \\"You know Larry, I may have been the happiest I've ever been... I loved this woman (Pang), I made some beautiful music and I got so fucked up with booze and shit and whatever.\\" =Pang's books about Lennon= After Lennon returned to Ono, Pang started working for United Artists Records and Island Records as a PR manager, working on albums by Bob Marley and Robert Palmer. Pang published her memoir, Loving John, in 1983. It was later updated and renamed John Lennon: The Lost Weekend. The original 500-page Loving John book focused mainly on Pang's role on Lennon's albums and sessions. It was edited down to 300 pages, concentrating mostly on the sensational aspects of their relationship. It also included postcards that Lennon had written to Pang during his travels throughout the world in the late '70s. Pang claims that she and Lennon remained lovers until 1977, and stayed in contact until his death. Pang's book of photographs, Instamatic Karma, was published in 2008. Besides the candid personal portraits, the book contains some historically important photographs, such as Lennon signing the official dissolution of the Beatles' partnership, and the last known photograph of Lennon and Paul McCartney together. Cynthia Lennon also provided a back cover endorsement, acknowledging Pang's role in reuniting Lennon with his estranged first son, Julian.  Jewelry  Pang started her own jewelry-business. She designs stainless-steel feng shui jewelry. Subsequent personal life Pang married record producer Tony Visconti in 1989; the couple divorced in 2000. They had two children. Pang remains in touch with some of the people from her time with Lennon, and Paul McCartney invited her to Linda McCartney's memorial service. She was an invited guest at The Concert for George in 2002 and remained close to Cynthia Lennon and Lennon's first son, Julian Lennon. Although having no contact for 20 years, on October 9, 2006, Pang accidentally met Ono in Iceland, on what would have been Lennon's 66th birthday. Ono was in Iceland to unveil a sculpture in Reykjav√≠k and was staying in the same hotel. Pang still resides in New York City and produces a line of stainless steel feng shui jewelry. She volunteers with an animal shelter called Animal Haven in New York and owns a dog that was rescued after Hurricane Katrina. She also co-hosts an Internet talk radio show, \\"Dinner Specials with Cynthia and May Pang\\", at blogtalkradio.com, with on-air partner Cynthia Neilson.

It stars Tim Woodward as Alan Farmer, a young blacksmith turned fighter pilot in World War I. Nicholas Jones played his teacher and mentor, Captain Triggers, and Michael Cochrane played his upper- class friend, Charles Gaylion, who began a relationship with Farmer's girlfriend while Farmer was believed dead, shot down over France. The series reveals that the British pilots are struggling with aeroplanes which are both unreliable and inferior to the German machines, and with an Establishment that classes voicing an opinion to that effect as being tantamount to cowardice. The airmen must also face the resentment of British soldiers who see them having an \\"easy\\" life. The rigidity of the British class structure is highlighted when Farmer becomes an officer in the second series ‚Äì he faces resentment both from some officers because of his class and NCOs because of his new rank. The series takes great care with historical accuracy, covering the early days of the parachute, the fitting of weaponry to British biplanes (lacking the Germans' interruptor gear, they had to be fired at an angle rather than through the propellers) and the horrors of trench warfare. Wings depicts a Britain that is, in some areas, struggling to adapt in the face of change, at a period that was a turning point for many people's way of life. The series was created by Barry Thomas.Deb Fisher, \\"The War in the Air: a View from the Ground\\", GWL Magazine, 10 August 2012. Accessed 25 July 2014 Twenty- five episodes were made in all. Effects The book BBC VFX (Mat Irvine and Mike Tucker) states that few First World War aircraft were still airworthy at the time of production so the majority of flying shots were achieved with 1/6 scale radio-controlled models under the guidance of long-time model aircraft expert David Boddington alongside Derek Piggott and Tony Bianchi. Piggott served as a stunt pilot during the filming of the 1966 movie The Blue Max.

An international co-production of United States and the United Kingdom, the film stars the Mothers of Invention, Theodore Bikel and Ringo Starr. A soundtrack album was released in the same year, with a slightly different selection of music. Plot The film attempts to portray the craziness of life on the road as a rock musician, and as such consists of a series of unconnected nonsense vignettes interspersed with concert footage of the Mothers of Invention.Miles, 2004, Frank Zappa, p. 207. Ostensibly, while on tour The Mothers of Invention go crazy in the small fictional town of Centerville (\\"a real nice place to raise your kids up\\"), wander around, and get beaten up in \\"Redneck Eats\\", a cowboy bar. In an animated interlude passed off as a \\"dental hygiene movie\\", bassist \\"Jeff\\", tired of playing what he refers to as \\"Zappa's comedy music\\", is persuaded by his bad conscience to quit the group, as did his real-life counterpart Jeff Simmons. Simmons was replaced by Martin Lickert (who was Starr's chauffeur) for the film. Almost every scene is drenched with video special effects (double and triple exposures, solarisation, false color, speed changes, etc.) which were innovative in 1971.

Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting.Watson, 1996, Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play, p. 183. However, director Tony Palmer (on his 2009 reissue of 200 Motels) claims that all elements of the script derived from Zappa's trunk's worth of material were completed during production. It was the first feature film photographed on videotape and transferred to 35 mm film utilizing a Technicolor film printer utilized by the BBC. Release and reception United Artists' press kit for the film stated \\"For the audience that already knows and appreciates THE MOTHERS, [it] will provide a logical extension of our concerts and recordings.\\" The film premiere was shown at Doheny Plaza Theater in Hollywood, California to mixed reviews.Lowe, 2006, The Words and Music of Frank Zappa, p. 94. 200 Motels currently holds a 57% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on seven reviews.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frank_zappa_two_hundred_motels Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, saying that the film; \\"is a joyous, fanatic, slightly weird experiment in the uses of the color videotape process\\", and also stating; \\"It assaults the mind with everything on hand\\".https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/200-motels-1971 Soundtrack The soundtrack to 200 Motels was released by United Artists Records on October 4, 1971, and features a combination of rock and jazz songs, orchestral music and comedic spoken dialogue. The rock and comedy songs \\"Mystery Roach\\", \\"Lonesome Cowboy Burt\\", \\"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy\\", \\"What Will This Evening Bring Me This Morning\\" and \\"Magic Fingers\\", and the finale \\"Strictly Genteel\\", which mixes orchestral and rock elements, were noted as highlights of the album by reviewer Richie Unterberger. The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the Royal Albert Hall after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract.Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, The Real Frank Zappa Book, pp. 119‚Äì137. When \\"Penis Dimension\\" was played to the judge, Mr Justice Mocatta, he responded \\"Have I got to listen to this?\\". The UK premi√®re was not until 29 October 2013, almost 20 years after Zappa's death. 200 Motels charted at #59 on the Billboard 200. The album was not released on compact disc until 1997, as a result of a licensing deal between Rykodisc (at the time the licensee for all of Zappa's other albums from the Zappa Family Trust (ZFT), numbering over 60 titles) and MGM allowing them to re-release numerous rare movie-musical soundtracks on CD. With the addition of this title, Ryko was finally able to offer the complete catalog of official Zappa recordings, as numerous legal proceedings both during Zappa's lifetime and afterwards failed to cede ownership of the rights and tapes to ZFT. That 2-CD edition, now out of print, contained extensive liner notes and artwork as well as a small poster for the film, as well as bonus tracks consisting of radio promos for the film and the single edit of the song \\"Magic Fingers\\". Though many Zappa fans consider this album a key recording of the period, it was deemed by some music critics to be a peripheral album. AllMusic's Richie Unterberger critiqued what he referred to as the \\"growing tendency to deploy the smutty, cheap humor that would soon dominate much of Zappa's work\\", but said that \\"Those who like his late-'60s/early-'70s work [...] will probably like this fine\\". Legacy After 200 Motels, the band went on tour; the live album Just Another Band From L.A. included the 20-minute track \\"Billy the Mountain\\", Zappa's satire on rock opera set in Southern California. This track was representative of the band's theatrical performances in which songs were used to build up sketches based on 200 Motels scenes as well as new situations often portraying the band members' sexual encounters on the road.Miles, 2004, Frank Zappa, pp. 203‚Äì204.

A lack of fertility is infertility while a lack of fecundity would be called sterility. Human demography considers only human fecundity, at its culturally differing rates, while population biology studies all organisms. The term fecundity in population biology is often used to describe the rate of offspring production after one time step (often annual). In this sense, fecundity may include both birth rates and survival of young to that time step. While levels of fecundity vary geographically, it is generally a consistent feature of each culture. Fecundation is another term for fertilization. Superfecundity or retrofecundity refers to an organism's ability to store another organism's sperm (after copulation) and fertilize its own eggs from that store after a period of time, essentially making it appear as though fertilization occurred without sperm (i.e. parthenogenesis). Fecundity is important and well studied in the field of population ecology, though it is studied from a neutral perspective. Fecundity can increase or decrease in a population according to current conditions and certain social factors. For instance, in times of hardship for a population, such as a lack of food or high temperatures, juvenile and eventually adult fecundity has been shown to decrease (i.e. due to a lack of resources the juvenile individuals are unable to reproduce, eventually the adults will run out of resources and reproduction will cease). Additionally, social trends and societal norms may influence fecundity, though this influence tends to be temporary. Indeed, it is considered impossible to cease reproduction based on social factors, and fecundity tends to rise after a brief decline. Fecundity has also been shown to increase in ungulates with relation to warmer weather. In sexual evolutionary biology, especially in sexual selection, fecundity is contrasted to reproductivity. In obstetrics and gynecology, fecundability is the probability of being pregnant in a single menstrual cycle, and fecundity is the probability of achieving a live birth within a single cycle.Berek JS and Novak E.

Another whaleboat, on the davits of a larger ship, is reflected in the water.whaling ship Charles W. Morgan at Mystic Seaport A whaleboat or whaler is a type of open boat that is relatively narrow and pointed at both ends. It was originally developed for whaling, and later became popular for work along beaches, since it does not need to be turned around for beaching or refloating. The term \\"whaleboat\\" may be used informally of larger whalers, or of a boat used for whale watching.  Modern applications and derivative designs  Today whaleboats are used as safety vessels aboard some marine vessels. The United States Coast Guard has been using them since 1791. Their simple open structure allows for easy access and personnel loading in the event of an emergency. Currently, some USCG whaleboats are used as lifeboats, with standardized equipment such as a hatchet, compass, sea anchor, emergency signal mirror, drinking water, first aid kit, jack knife with can opener, bilge pump, and other emergency provisions. On modern warships, a relatively light and seaworthy double-ender for transport of ship's crew may be referred to as a whaleboat or whaler. Many have fuller hulls with more capacity, but far more drag. Monomoy surfboats, a lifeboat directly descended from whaleboats, are used for recreational and competitive rowing in the San Francisco Bay Area and coastal Massachusetts. The Tancook Schooner descends from whaleboats through the tancook whaler, a double-ended design optimized for sail.  Uses in war  Whaleboats were also extensively used in warfare. Colonel Benjamin Church is credited with pioneering their use for amphibious operations against Abenaki and Mi'kmaq tribes in what is today Maine and Acadia. His troops, New England colonial forces and Native allies from southern New England, used them as early as 1696 (during King William's War). Others in the Northeastern borderlands followed suit and they were used throughout the imperial conflicts of the early 18th century, and extensively used by both British and colonial troops during the French and Indian war. Units that made extensive use of whaleboats were the 7th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment at the siege of Louisburg in 1745, often referred to as \\"the whaleboat regiment\\", and Gorham's Rangers, formed in 1744, initially a company of Indians mainly from Cape Cod, many of whom were employed as whalers, and which later evolved into a British Army ranger company in the 1750s and 1760s.Brian D.

In 1772, American colonials used whaleboats to attack and destroy the Gaspee in Narragansett Bay. During the American Revolutionary War, there were many whaleboat raids, including one with 230 men led by Return J. Meigs, Sr. to sack Sag Harbor on Long Island in 1777. On December 7, 1782, two fleets of whaleboats fought a bloody battle on Long Island Sound known as the Boats Fight. During the desperate hand-to-hand conflict, every man involved was either killed or injured.  Construction and use  The whaleboat was originally a lapstrake design, clearly in the Northern European building tradition that created the longship and the yole.

Retrieved April 11, 2014 In the first half of the 20th century, many navies carried whaleboats on their warships, such as the 27ft whalers used in the Royal Navy. Whaleboats generally used a dismountable mast for distance work or for towing a carcasse, but depended on oars for close-in work. Boats used strictly for whaling often used only a long steering oar, while those used as ship‚Äôs boats often had dismountable pintle-and-gudgeon rudders as well. A main sail, and occasionally a jib were used. After 1850 most were fitted with a centreboard.

He was best known for his work as a member of Spooky Tooth, the Grease Band, and Paul McCartney and Wings. He also performed and recorded as a solo artist and session musician. Early life McCullough was born in Portstewart, and first came to prominence in the early 1960s as the teenage lead guitarist with the Skyrockets showband from Enniskillen. McCullough was ProtestantSounes, Howard (2010). Fab: An Intimate Life of Paul McCartney. London: HarperCollins. . In 1964, with three other members of the Skyrockets, he left and formed a new showband fronted by South African born vocalist Gene Chetty, which they named Gene and the Gents. In 1967 McCullough moved to Belfast where he joined Chris Stewart (bass), Ernie Graham (vocals) and Dave Lutton (drums) to form the psychedelic band the People. Later that year the band moved to London and were signed by Chas Chandler's management team, who changed the group's name to √âire Apparent. Under Chandler's guidance after a single release they toured with groups such as Pink Floyd, Soft Machine, the Move and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, as well as Eric Burdon and the Animals. Things went well until in Vancouver, Canada in mid-February 1968, while the band was touring with the Animals, McCullough returned to the United Kingdom, officially because of \\"visa problems\\" and Mick Cox flew out to take his place in the band.Ross Hannan and Corry Arnold Eric Burdon and The Animals, chickenonaunicycle.com; accessed 10 November 2016. Back in Ireland, around May 1968, McCullough joined folk group Sweeney's Men.Daragh O'Halloran, Green Beat: The Forgotten Era of Irish Rock, Brehon Press (2006) 1970s McCullough returned to London around 1969 to work with Joe Cocker as a member of his backing band, the Grease Band. With Cocker he toured the U.S. and performed at the Woodstock Festival. He later played on the Grease Band's eponymous album. During his time with the band he appeared as lead guitarist on the studio album of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar (1970) and on the progressive Spooky Tooth album The Last Puff (1970). In 1971 Paul McCartney asked McCullough to join his new band, Wings, alongside Denny Laine and Denny Seiwell. Musical differences with McCartney, however, saw McCullough leave on the eve of the Band on the Run sessions. He had spent two years in the band, playing lead guitar on \\"Hi, Hi, Hi\\", \\"Live and Let Die\\" as well as \\"My Love\\". McCullough's spoken words \\"I don't know; I was really drunk at the time\\" can be heard on the Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), at the end of the song \\"Money\\". He was recalling a fight he had the night before with his wife. In 1975 McCullough joined the Frankie Miller Band with bassist Chris Stewart, keyboard player Mick Weaver and drummer Stu Perry. They recorded the album, The Rock with Miller. Later the same year McCullough released Mind Your Own Business on George Harrison's Dark Horse label. McCullough played concerts as a session musician with Roy Harper, Frankie Miller, Eric Burdon, Marianne Faithfull, Ronnie Lane and Donovan. In 1977 he temporarily joined Dr. Feelgood, following the departure of Wilko Johnson. 1980s Recovering from an injury to his hand while visiting his family in 1980, McCullough decided to stay in Ireland. He began to sit in with old friends the Fleadh Cowboys, at their Sunday afternoon residency in The Lower Deck in Dublin. Following this he moved back to Portstewart and put a new band together. He was joined by Percy Robinson on pedal steel guitar, Roe Butcher on bass and Liam Bradley on drums. 1990s In 1998 McCullough travelled to Poland, where he rehearsed with a band of Polish musicians for a tour. After the tour, they recorded a 'live' album which was released as Blue Sunset. This was followed by a further Polish tour. On returning home, McCullough recorded and released \\"Failed Christian\\", a song that has since been covered by Nick Lowe on his album Dig My Mood. 2000s McCullough continued to record and perform and released solo material, including Belfast To Boston (2001) and Unfinished Business (2003). The latter contained his 1998 single, \\"Failed Christian\\". McCullough performed at concerts in Northern Ireland and Scotland, playing with a backing band (featuring Stephen Quinn on drums and Sean McCarron on saxophone). McCullough contributed guitar on and organised the band for the Alaskan musician, The Rev Neil Down's 2003 release, When A Wrong Turns Right. The Henry McCullough Band ‚Äì FBI Live was released in 2007 on Mundell music, from a recording at The Famous Bein Inn in 2006. In 2007, Over the Rhine covered \\"Failed Christian\\" on their album, Live from Nowhere, Vol. II. In the same year, McCullough started to work with Dave Sharp from the Alarm) and together they enlisted keyboard player Zoot Money, bassist Gary Fletcher and drummer Colin Allen, a line up which became known as the Hard Travelers. In January 2008 the Hard Travelers performed their debut gig at The Cellars in Portsmouth. In 2008 McCullough recorded Poor Man's Moon at Amberville Studios, which was released in Ireland only on 5 September 2008. and featured new McCullough compositions. The album also included a number of songs co-written with poet Eamon Carr from Horslips and included the single \\"Too Late to Worry\\". Among the musicians featured on the album were keyboard player James Delaney, bassists Roe Butcher and Nicky Scott (also double bass), keyboard player Enda Walsh, drummer Adie McIlduff and Percy Robinson on dobro and pedal steel guitar. The album also included drum sequences by Peter McKinney. At the end of 2007 he worked on the album \\"Dark Nite of the Soul\\" with Jeff Greene as well as other musical collaborations recorded at Wind-Mill Lane Studios, Dublin Metropolis Studios London and The Sound Kitchen Nashville. McCullough attended Paul McCartney's concert at the O2 in Dublin on 20 December 2009 and McCartney publicly acknowledged McCullough's contribution to Wings. On 13 March 2010, McCullough and his band were the headline act at the Fifestock Festival at the Inn at Lathones, Scotland. 2010s McCullough remained active in the European music scene and played regular live gigs with artists including Ed Deane, James Delaney, Noel Bridgeman, also John Quearney. In 2011 Henry collaborated with songwriter Paul Doherty and the Vals on the track \\"Look to the One\\". The song gained worldwide airplay, with McCullough contributing backing vocals and guitar. McCullough suffered a heart attack in November 2012, leaving him in critical condition. His death was mistakenly reported on Ronan Collins's RT√â Radio 1 show on 7 November and the BBC also apologised after prematurely reporting his death. In an interview with website Something Else, Denny Seiwell, who had played with McCullough in Wings, stated that it was doubtful McCullough would make a complete recovery. On 17 March 2015 a benefit concert for Henry McCullough was held at The Half Moon, Putney music venue, featuring Paul Carrack, Nick Lowe, Andy Fairweather Low, Suggs and Bobby Tench (who also performed with the backing band). The backing band was entitled Henry's Heroes and included Tim Hinkley, Mel Collins, Neil Hubbard and John Halsey and bass player Kuma Harada. On 14 June 2016, his wife Josie confirmed that he had died at his home at Ballywindelland, Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, earlier that morning after a long illness. He had never fully recovered from the heart attack he suffered in 2012. Some sources state he also suffered a major stroke.

Kakuro puzzles are regular features in many math-and-logic puzzle publications across the world. In 1966, Canadian Jacob E. Funk, an employee of Dell Magazines, came up with the original English name Cross Sums and other names such as Cross Addition have also been used, but the Japanese name Kakuro, abbreviation of Japanese kasan kurosu (Âä†ÁÆó„ÇØ„É≠„Çπ, \\"addition cross\\"), seems to have gained general acceptance and the puzzles appear to be titled this way now in most publications. The popularity of Kakuro in Japan is immense, second only to Sudoku among Nikoli's famed logic-puzzle offerings. The canonical Kakuro puzzle is played in a grid of filled and barred cells, \\"black\\" and \\"white\\" respectively. Puzzles are usually 16√ó16 in size, although these dimensions can vary widely. Apart from the top row and leftmost column which are entirely black, the grid is divided into \\"entries\\"‚Äîlines of white cells‚Äîby the black cells. The black cells contain a diagonal slash from upper-left to lower-right and a number in one or both halves, such that each horizontal entry has a number in the black half- cell to its immediate left and each vertical entry has a number in the black half-cell immediately above it. These numbers, borrowing crossword terminology, are commonly called \\"clues\\". The objective of the puzzle is to insert a digit from 1 to 9 inclusive into each white cell such that the sum of the numbers in each entry matches the clue associated with it and that no digit is duplicated in any entry. It is that lack of duplication that makes creating Kakuro puzzles with unique solutions possible. Like Sudoku, solving a Kakuro puzzle involves investigating combinations and permutations. There is an unwritten rule for making Kakuro puzzles that each clue must have at least two numbers that add up to it, since including only one number is mathematically trivial when solving Kakuro puzzles. At least one publisher includes the constraint that a given combination of numbers can only be used once in each grid, but still markets the puzzles as plain Kakuro. Some publishers prefer to print their Kakuro grids exactly like crossword grids, with no labeling in the black cells and instead numbering the entries, providing a separate list of the clues akin to a list of crossword clues. (This eliminates the row and column that are entirely black.) This is purely an issue of image and does not affect either the solution nor the logic required for solving. In discussing Kakuro puzzles and tactics, the typical shorthand for referring to an entry is \\"(clue, in numerals)-in-(number of cells in entry, spelled out)\\", such as \\"16-in-two\\" and \\"25-in-five\\". The exception is what would otherwise be called the \\"45-in-nine\\"‚Äîsimply \\"45\\" is used, since the \\"-in-nine\\" is mathematically implied (nine cells is the longest possible entry, and since it cannot duplicate a digit it must consist of all the digits from 1 to 9 once). Curiously, both \\"43-in-eight\\" and \\"44-in- eight\\" are still frequently called as such, despite the \\"-in-eight\\" suffix being equally implied. Solving techniques =Combinatoric techniques= Although brute-force guessing is possible, a more efficient approach is the understanding of the various combinatorial forms that entries can take for various pairings of clues and entry lengths. The solution space can be reduced by resolving allowable intersections of horizontal and vertical sums, or by considering necessary or missing values. Those entries with sufficiently large or small clues for their length will have fewer possible combinations to consider, and by comparing them with entries that cross them, the proper permutation‚Äîor part of it‚Äîcan be derived. The simplest example is where a 3-in-two crosses a 4-in-two: the 3-in-two must consist of \\"1\\" and \\"2\\" in some order; the 4-in-two (since \\"2\\" cannot be duplicated) must consist of \\"1\\" and \\"3\\" in some order. Therefore, their intersection must be \\"1\\", the only digit they have in common. When solving longer sums there are additional ways to find clues to locating the correct digits. One such method would be to note where a few squares together share possible values thereby eliminating the possibility that other squares in that sum could have those values. For instance, if two 4-in-two clues cross with a longer sum, then the 1 and 3 in the solution must be in those two squares and those digits cannot be used elsewhere in that sum. When solving sums which have a limited number of solution sets then that can lead to useful clues. For instance, a 30-in-seven sum only has two solution sets: {1,2,3,4,5,6,9} and {1,2,3,4,5,7,8}. If one of the squares in that sum can only take on the values of {8,9} (if the crossing clue is a 17-in-two sum, for example) then that not only becomes an indicator of which solution set fits this sum, it eliminates the possibility of any other digit in the sum being either of those two values, even before determining which of the two values fits in that square. Another useful approach in more complex puzzles is to identify which square a digit goes in by eliminating other locations within the sum. If all of the crossing clues of a sum have many possible values, but it can be determined that there is only one square which could have a particular value which the sum in question must have, then whatever other possible values the crossing sum would allow, that intersection must be the isolated value. For example, a 36-in-eight sum must contain all digits except 9. If only one of the squares could take on the value of 2 then that must be the answer for that square. =Box technique= A \\"box technique\\" can also be applied on occasion, when the geometry of the unfilled white cells at any given stage of solving lends itself to it: by summing the clues for a series of horizontal entries (subtracting out the values of any digits already added to those entries) and subtracting the clues for a mostly overlapping series of vertical entries, the difference can reveal the value of a partial entry, often a single cell. This technique works because addition is both associative and commutative. It is common practice to mark potential values for cells in the cell corners until all but one have been proven impossible; for particularly challenging puzzles, sometimes entire ranges of values for cells are noted by solvers in the hope of eventually finding sufficient constraints to those ranges from crossing entries to be able to narrow the ranges to single values. Because of space constraints, instead of digits some solvers use a positional notation, where a potential numerical value is represented by a mark in a particular part of the cell, which makes it easy to place several potential values into a single cell. This also makes it easier to distinguish potential values from solution values. Some solvers also use graph paper to try various digit combinations before writing them into the puzzle grids. As in the Sudoku case, only relatively easy Kakuro puzzles can be solved with the above-mentioned techniques. Harder ones require the use of various types of chain patterns, the same kinds as appear in Sudoku (see Pattern-Based Constraint Satisfaction and Logic Puzzles). Mathematics of Kakuro Mathematically, Kakuro puzzles can be represented as integer programming problems, and are NP-complete. See also Yato and Seta, 2004. There are two kinds of mathematical symmetry readily identifiable in Kakuro puzzles: minimum and maximum constraints are duals, as are missing and required values. All sum combinations can be represented using a bitmapped representation. This representation is useful for determining missing and required values using bitwise logic operations. Popularity Kakuro puzzles appear in nearly 100 Japanese magazines and newspapers. Kakuro remained the most popular logic puzzle in Japanese printed press until 1992, when Sudoku took the top spot. In the UK, they first appeared in The Guardian with The Telegraph and the Daily Mail following. Variants A relatively common variant of Kakuro is Cross Products (or Cross Multiplication), where the clues are the product of the digits in the entries rather than the sum. Dell Magazines has produced such puzzles but also allowed repeating of digits aside from 1 because of space limitations in the number of digits in each product in a puzzle. Puzzles by Games Magazines are more like crossword puzzles, allowing the implementation of the no-repeating digits rule. Another variant is having a different range of values that are inserted in the cells, such as 1 to 12, instead of the standard 1 to 9. A genuine combination of Sudoku and Kakuro is the so-called \\"Cross Sums Sudoku\\" in which clues are given as cross sums on a standard 9 x 9 Sudoku grid. A relevant variant is the so-called \\"Cryptic Kakuro\\" where the clues are given in terms of alphametics and each number represents a digit from 1 to 9. The final puzzle of the 2004 United States qualifier for the World Puzzle Championship is titled Cross Number Sums Place: it is a Cross Sums where every row and column of the grid (except the top row and leftmost column as usual) contains exactly nine white cells, none of which‚Äîeven across multiple entries‚Äîare allowed to use the same digit twice, like a Number Place (Sudoku); in addition, small circles are printed on the borders between some white cells; numerically adjacent digits must be placed astride those circles, and may not appear orthogonally adjacent when not astride a circle.

Technological measures shall be deemed 'effective' where the use of a protected work or other subject matter is controlled by the rights holders through application of an access control or protection process, such as encryption, scrambling or other transformation of the work or other subject-matter or a copy control mechanism, which achieves the protection objective. # Notwithstanding the legal protection provided for in paragraph 1, in the absence of voluntary measures taken by rights holders, including agreements between rights holders and other parties concerned, Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that rights holders make available to the beneficiary of an exception or limitation provided for in national law in accordance with Article 5(2)(a), (2)(c), (2)(d), (2)(e), (3)(a), (3)(b) or (3)(e) the means of benefiting from that exception or limitation, to the extent necessary to benefit from that exception or limitation and where that beneficiary has legal access to the protected work or subject-matter concerned. (...) =United States= In the United States, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\\"DMCA\\") has implemented the treaty provisions regarding the circumvention of some technological barriers to copying intellectual property. Circumvention of Access Controls Section 103 (17 U.S.C Sec. 1201(a)(1)) of the DMCA states: > No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls > access to a work protected under this title. The Act defines what it means in Section 1201(a)(3): > (3) As used in this subsection‚Äî (A) to \\"circumvent a technological measure\\" > means to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or > otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological > measure, without the authority of the copyright owner; and (B) a > technological measure \\"effectively controls access to a work\\" if the > measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application > of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the > copyright owner, to gain access to the work. Thus, if there is some \\"technological measure that effectively controls access to a work\\", it is illegal to circumvent that measure. However, Section 1201 creates several exceptions to this rule, and the Library of Congress is empowered to create additional exceptions. Distribution of Circumvention Tools The Act also prohibits the distribution of tools that enable a user to circumvent access controls or controls that protect a right of the copyright holder. Access Controls 17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201 (a)(2) provides: > (2) No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or > otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or > part thereof, that‚Äî (A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of > circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a > work protected under this title; (B) has only limited commercially > significant purpose or use other than to circumvent a technological measure > that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title; or > (C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that person > with that person's knowledge for use in circumventing a technological > measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this > title. Rights Controls Distribution of tools intended to circumvent controls that protect a right of the copyright holder is also prohibited. 17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201 (b) states: > (1) No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or > otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or > part thereof, that‚Äî (A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of > circumventing protection afforded by a technological measure that > effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this title in a work > or a portion thereof; (B) has only limited commercially significant purpose > or use other than to circumvent protection afforded by a technological > measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this > title in a work or a portion thereof; or (C) is marketed by that person or > another acting in concert with that person with that person's knowledge for > use in circumventing protection afforded by a technological measure that > effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this title in a work > or a portion thereof. A rights control is defined in 17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201 (b)(2) (B): > a technological measure \\"effectively protects a right of a copyright owner > under this title\\" if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, > prevents, restricts, or otherwise limits the exercise of a right of a > copyright owner under this title. Unlike access controls, the DMCA does not ban the circumvention of rights controls. It was thought that traditional copyright law was sufficient to protect the interests of copyright holders in cases of individual acts of circumvention.For example, the Senate Report on the DMCA states that \\"[i]t is anticipated that most acts of circumventing a technological copyright protection measure will occur in the course of conduct which itself implicates the copyright owners[(C)] rights under title 17. This subsection is not intended in any way to enlarge or diminish those rights. Thus, for example, where a copy control technology is employed to prevent unauthorized reproduction of a work, the circumvention of that technology would not itself be actionable under 1201, but any reproduction of the work that is thereby facilitated would remain subject to the protections embodied in title 17. Other Rights The Act states that its provisions are not intended to modify a number of already existing rights. Section 1201(c) provides: > (c) Other Rights, Etc., Not Affected.‚Äî (1) Nothing in this section shall > affect rights, remedies, limitations, or defenses to copyright infringement, > including fair use, under this title. (2) Nothing in this section shall > enlarge or diminish vicarious or contributory liability for copyright > infringement in connection with any technology, product, service, device, > component, or part thereof. (3) Nothing in this section shall require that > the design of, or design and selection of parts and components for, a > consumer electronics, telecommunications, or computing product provide for a > response to any particular technological measure, so long as such part or > component, or the product in which such part or component is integrated, > does not otherwise fall within the prohibitions of subsection (a)(2) or > (b)(1). (4) Nothing in this section shall enlarge or diminish any rights of > free speech or the press for activities using consumer electronics, > telecommunications, or computing products. Fair Use and Circumvention Critics of the DMCA have often noted the absence of an explicit exception for circumvention to enable fair use.A Riff on Fair Use in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act by David Nimmer (2000) Section 103(c)(1) of the DMCA (17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201 (c)(1)) does state that [n]othing in this section shall affect rights, remedies, limitations, or defenses to copyright infringement, including fair use, under this title. However, a violation of the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA is not itself copyright infringement and therefore it is unclear whether fair use can be raised as a defense in circumvention cases. Courts have come out both ways on the issue. Some have held that the anti-circumvention provisions can only be violated when the circumvention has a connection to copyright infringement. For example, in Storage Tech. Corp. v. Custom Hardware Eng'g & Consulting, Inc., 421 F.3d 1307, 1318-19 (Fed. Cir. 2005) the Federal Circuit held that a copyright holder must show a connection to copyright infringement in order to succeed in a claim under the DMCA. Similarly, in Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Skylink Technologies, Inc. 381 F.3d 1178 (Fed. Cir. 2004) the court held that distribution of a circumvention device (in that case a garage door opener) did not violate the anti-circumvention provisions because its use did not lead to any copyright violation. However, in a number of cases involving DVD decryption courts have held that there is no fair use defense in circumvention cases. In Universal City Studios v. Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d 294, 322 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), the court stated that \\"[i]f Congress had meant the fair use defense to apply to such actions, it would have said so.\\"Similar cases include 321 Studios v. Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios, Inc., 307 F.Supp.2d 1085, 1101-02 (N.D. Cal. 2004) and RealNetworks, Inc. v. Streambox, Inc., No. 2:99CV02070, 2000 WL 127311, at *8 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 18, 2000). Reverse Engineering and Circumvention Sec. 103(f) of the DMCA (17 U.S.C. ¬ß 1201 (f)) says that you are allowed to reverse-engineer a protected program in order to figure out how to get it to interoperate (i.e., exchange and make use of information) with other programs.. The section states: > (f) Reverse Engineering.‚Äî (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection > (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a > computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively > controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose > of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are > necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer > program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily > available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any > such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement > under this title. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) > and (b), a person may develop and employ technological means to circumvent a > technological measure, or to circumvent protection afforded by a > technological measure, in order to enable the identification and analysis > under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an > independently created computer program with other programs, if such means > are necessary to achieve such interoperability, to the extent that doing so > does not constitute infringement under this title. (3) The information > acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph (1), and the means > permitted under paragraph (2), may be made available to others if the person > referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides such > information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability of > an independently created computer program with other programs, and to the > extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title or > violate applicable law other than this section. (4) For purposes of this > subsection, the term \\"interoperability\\" means the ability of computer > programs to exchange information, and of such programs mutually to use the > information which has been exchanged. Notable cases * Universal v. Reimerdes * United States v. ElcomSoft and Sklyarov Criticism The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) criticized DMCA anti-circumvention clauses, saying it \\"chills free expression and scientific research\\", jeopardizes fair use, impedes competition and innovation, and interferes with computer intrusion laws.\\"DMCA\\". Electronic Frontier Foundation website. Accessed 30 March 2012. =Australia= Australia prohibits circumvention of \\"access control technical protection measures\\" in Section 116 of the Copyright Act. The law currently imposes penalties for circumvention of such measures as well as the manufacturing and distribution of tools to enable it. DRM may be legally circumvented under a few distinct circumstances which are named as exceptions in the law: #permission of the rightsholder #enabling interoperability with copyrighted software #encryption research #security testing #disabling access to private information (circumvention only) #national security or law enforcement #library acquisition decisions (circumvention only) #acts prescribed by regulation (circumvention only) A person circumventing the access control bears the burden of proof that one of these exceptions apply. Penalties for violation of the anti-circumvention laws include an injunction, monetary damages, and destruction of enabling devices. Notable cases * Stevens v.

Ferriss was given the nickname 'Boo' as the result of a childhood inability to pronounce the word 'brother'. After Ferriss's MLB playing career was over, he returned to the Mississippi Delta for two stints as the head baseball coach at Delta State University where he retired as the school's all-time leader in wins with 639.http://www.gostatesmen.com/documents/2012/3/23/Statesmen_History_and_Records.pdf?id=1493 In November 2002, he was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame. Playing career =College and minor league baseball= Ferriss received the first full baseball scholarship to Mississippi State University, where he pitched in 1941 and 1942 and joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He was signed by the Red Sox in 1942, and he appeared in 21 games for the Greensboro Red Sox of the Class B Piedmont League, compiling a 7‚Äì7 record. Shortly afterward, he was called by the military for World War II service, where he served for over two years at Randolph Field in Texas, during which time he was able to continue playing baseball, in a military league. After an early discharge in February 1945 due to asthma, Ferriss was assigned by the Red Sox to the Louisville Colonels, although he did not appear in a game with them. During his college years, Dave was credited with naming the \\"orange\\". =Major League Baseball= When the Red Sox started slowly in 1945, Ferriss was called up and made a spectacular major league debut with a five-hit shutout against the Athletics on April 29. He went on to set a longstanding American League (AL) record for scoreless innings pitched at the start of a career with 22, which stood until 2008, when it was broken by Brad Ziegler. Ferriss compiled a 21‚Äì10 win-loss record for the Red Sox in his rookie season. Ferriss then compiled a 25‚Äì6 record (the best in the AL) that helped the Red Sox win the AL pennant in 1946. He was selected for the All-Star Game that season for the first and only time but did not pitch (the 1945 All-Star Game had been cancelled due to World War II). He started two games in the 1946 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, and pitched a complete-game shutout in the third game before getting a no-decision in the seventh and deciding game, which was won by the Cardinals. Ferriss' record in 1947 was 12‚Äì11. His arm troubles and asthma restricted him to only nine starts and 31 appearances in 1948, and four appearances in 1949. His final major league appearance was on Opening Day of the 1950 season, when he pitched only one inning. Ferriss compiled a career record of 65‚Äì30, and shares the MLB record for consecutive home wins to start a season (13, in 1946). He was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2002. Ferriss was a very good hitting pitcher in his six-year major league career, posting a .250 batting average (93-for-372) with one home run, 52 RBIs, and 44 runs scored. He had 19 RBIs in each of the 1945 and 1947 seasons. He finished his career with a .979 fielding percentage.Baseball-Reference.com Coaching career Ferriss served as pitching coach for the Red Sox under manager Pinky Higgins from 1955 to 1959 before moving on to Delta State University as head coach in 1960. He held that role until early 1967, when he left Delta State to take the role of assistant athletic director at Mississippi State University. Ferriss returned to Delta State in mid-1968, and he again served as head coach from 1970 until retiring after the 1988 season. His 639‚Äì387‚Äì8 record as Delta State head coach ranks him among all-time national coaching leaders at the NCAA Division II level. He guided Delta State teams to the NCAA Division II playoffs in eight of his last twelve seasons, including three trips to the NCAA Division II Baseball Championship resulting in finishes of third (1977), second (1978), and third (1982). Gulf South Conference championships came in 1978, 1979, 1985, and 1988, along with a second-place finish in 1981 and third-place in 1982. Ferriss spent 46 years in baseball at the collegiate and professional levels and was inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1988. He was also inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame, the Delta State University Sports Hall of Fame (1989), the Mississippi State University Sports Hall of Fame, and the Mississippi Semi-Pro Baseball Hall of Fame (1981). In 1988, he received the United States Baseball Federation Service Award for his contributions to the game. He was named NCAA Regional Coach of the Year three times, and earned similar Gulf South Conference coaching honors three times as well. In 1978 and 1982, he was elected College Baseball Coach of the Year in Mississippi, and was runner-up in 1985. Under his direction, 20 Delta State players earned All-American honors, 20 earned Academic All-American honors, 49 earned All-Gulf South Conference honors, 23 continued their baseball careers onto the professional level, and 40 former players coached in the high school and college ranks. In addition to coaching at Delta State, Ferriss also served at various times as athletic director and director of the DSU Foundation. In February 2008, Ferriss welcomed back author John Grisham to Delta State's campus for an athletic fundraiser. Grisham, a Mississippi native, began his career path \\"thanks to coach Ferriss\\" after Ferriss had cut Grisham from his team in the fall of 1978. In Grisham's \\"The Kindest Cut,\\" the author details his time at Delta State and how coach Ferriss handled the difficult task of cutting the would-be outfielder. Also in 2008, Ferriss received an honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from Delta State. =Namings= * The baseball field at Delta State University is named Ferriss Field in his honor. *The \\"Boo\\" Ferriss Baseball Museum ‚Äì located at the Robert L.

The presently reigning King Harald V is her only son. M√§rtha was also a sister of Queen Astrid of Belgium, and a maternal aunt of Grand Duchess Jos√©phine-Charlotte of Luxembourg, King Baudouin of Belgium and King Albert II of Belgium.  Early life  M√§rtha (right) with her mother and sisters M√§rtha was born at her parents' home of Arvfurstens Palats in Stockholm on 28 March 1901, the second child of Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland, and his wife Princess Ingeborg of Denmark. Her father was the younger brother of King Gustav V of Sweden, making her a first cousin twice removed of the present King of Sweden, and her mother was the younger sister of King Christian X of Denmark and of King Haakon VII of Norway. M√§rtha had an elder sister, Princess Margaretha of Denmark, a younger sister, Queen Astrid of the Belgians, and a younger brother, Prince Carl Bernadotte. M√§rtha grew up as being much more confident and outgoing and as the daughter most admired by her mother.Sparre, Anna. Astrid mon amie, 2005. As a child, M√§rtha was taught at home by private tutors and completed in-depth courses in childcare and first aid. She and her sisters were occasionally shopping unaccompanied on the streets of Stockholm.  Crown Princess  Princess M√§rtha of Sweden became engaged to her first cousin, Olav, only son and heir apparent of her uncle the King of Norway, during the 1928 Olympic Summer Games in Amsterdam. News of the engagement was very well received. It was taken as a sign that there was no longer any tension following the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. An excellent match in terms of strengthening royal ties, it was also clearly a match based on love. M√§rtha with her husband and daughter Ragnhild Following a year-long engagement, she married Crown Prince Olav in Oslo Cathedral on 21 March 1929. M√§rtha's was the first royal wedding in Norway in 340 years. The marriage, which is widely believed to have been a success due in large part to their genuine love and affection for one another, produced three children: Ragnhild (1930-2012); Astrid (b. 1932); and the much awaited heir, Harald (b. 1937). Crown Princess M√§rtha soon became a popular and respected member of the royal family. She undertook a range of official engagements, and she also gave many speeches, which was unusual for females in the royal family at the time. Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess M√§rtha of Norway resided at the country estate of Skaugum, which was a wedding gift from Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg. When the main house at Skaugum was destroyed by fire in 1930, the Crown Princess was actively involved in the planning of the new building. Tragedy struck Crown Princess M√§rtha in 1935. Her sister, the Queen of the Belgians, was killed in a car crash. The two siblings had been very close, and Olav later said that it took his wife more than ten years to come to terms with it, but he did not think that she ever really got over her sister's death. She ‚Äì together with her elder sister Margaretha ‚Äì became a great support for her sister's children in Belgium. In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II in Europe, the Crown Prince and Princess visited the United States. The couple befriended President Franklin Roosevelt and his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt. During this visit, the couple conducted an extensive tour of the Upper Midwest, where many Norwegian immigrants had settled. During the tour, Crown Princess M√§rtha was honoured with initiation into the Delta Zeta sorority. She and her lady-in- waiting were pinned during the initiation ceremony at the University of North Dakota, by Delta Zeta national president, Myrtle Graeter Malott. Crown Princess M√§rtha became the senior lady of the court on the death of her mother-in-law, Queen Maud, in 1938. =World War II= Crown Princess M√§rtha, who contributed greatly in the mobilization work for Norway's self-protection, made a public announcement on 26 January 1940 in which she encouraged Norwegian women to take part in the mobilization work.Krigens Dagbok (The diary of the war) (in Norwegian) 1984 When Germany invaded Norway in April 1940, the Crown Princess and her children fled first to her native Sweden but she was not well received. Many Swedes felt she had put Sweden's neutrality in jeopardy. Some even suggested she should accept the Germans' suggestion and return her three-year-old son, Prince Harald, to Norway so he could be proclaimed King by the Germans. However, she never saw this as an option and following an invitation by President Roosevelt, she went to the United States on the United States Army transport , via the then Finnish port city of Petsamo. In the U.S., she and her children initially stayed in the White House. Crown Prince Olav, however, had gone with his father to the United Kingdom, where he worked with the Norwegian government-in-exile. Thus, the crown couple, like many couples during that time, were separated for much of the war. Crown Princess M√§rtha (2nd from right) in 1944, with (from left to right) her husband Crown Prince Olav, Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Thomas J. Watson In August 1941, Crown Princess M√§rtha traveled with President Roosevelt aboard the presidential yacht, , and sailed to Newfoundland and Atlantic Charter with Winston Churchill. The friendship that the Crown Prince and Crown Princess had cultivated with the Roosevelts was further developed during the war years. In 1942, the US presented the exiled Norwegian forces with the gift of the submarine chaser , which was received by Crown Princess M√§rtha, who in her reply gave a speech in support of Norwegian liberation.Krigens Dagbok (The diary of the war) (in Norwegian) 1984 Her impressive work to assist the American Red Cross and on behalf of Norwegian interests greatly impressed Roosevelt and influenced his \\"Look to Norway\\" speech in 1942. Novelist and essayist Gore Vidal later asserted that Crown Princess M√§rtha was Roosevelt's \\"last love\\". Roosevelt's son James stated that \\"There was no question that Martha was an important figure in Father's life during the war ... there is a real possibility that a true romantic relationship developed between the president and the princess.\\" Roald Dahl, later a well-known author and then a young RAF fighter pilot assigned to Washington, seems to have agreed: > \\"Dahl was inclined to think that all the smoke indicated a real fire . . . > [Dahl wrote] 'The President has it in his mind that he would like to sleep > with her.' \\"Jennet Conant. The Irregulars: Roald Dahl and the British Spy > Ring in Wartime Washington. Simon & Schuster. New York. 2008. pp. 137. Princess M√§rtha spent much of World War II in the United States, where she worked tirelessly to keep up support for Norway among the American public and government. In 1942, she visited London to take part in the birthday celebration for her father-in-law. When she returned to Norway following the war in 1945, she received a hero's welcome and was referred to as \\"Mother of the Nation\\". She wholly embraced her role as Crown Princess of Norway and made tremendous efforts towards ensuring the stability and well-being of all Norwegians. = Post-war period = As King Haakon‚Äôs health declined, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess assumed a growing number of official engagements. The Crown Princess became involved in many official tasks, and even made the annual New Year‚Äôs Eve speeches in 1946 and 1950. After the war, Crown Princess M√§rtha suffered from poor health. Death Following a lengthy period of ill-health, M√§rtha died of cancer at The National Hospital in Oslo in 5 April 1954. At the time of her death her elder daughter Ragnhild was expecting her first child. Her death came little more than three years before her husband ascended the throne as king. Her death was a tremendous loss for the future king Olav and the children as well as for Norway. Legacy Crown Princess M√§rtha, a statue outside the Norwegian embassy in Washington, D.C. A 970,000 km¬≤ area in Antarctica is named Princess Martha Coast in her honor. A statue of the princess was erected outside the Norwegian embassy in Washington, D.C. in 2005. In 2007, a replica of the statue was erected in the courtyard of the Royal Palace in Oslo. Crown Princess M√§rtha‚Äôs Memorial Fund is a charitable trust administered by the Norwegian Crown. The Crown Princess's youngest daughter, Princess Astrid, serves as chairperson. Initially established as Her Royal Highness Crown Princess M√§rtha‚Äôs Fund on 1 April 1929, the fund \\"is to provide financial support to social and humanitarian initiatives carried out by non-governmental organizations.\\" In 2005, the Fund had assets of approximately 28 million Norwegian krone (NOK), and issued grants totaling about 1.5 million NOK for roughly 300 recipients.Royal House web page on Crown Princess M√§rtha‚Äôs Memorial Fund Retrieved 6 November 2007 Her son King Harald V named his daughter Princess M√§rtha Louise after her grandmother.

Synopsis This farcical comedy focuses on Prudence and Bruce, two Manhattanites who are seeking stable romantic relationships with the help of their psychiatrists, each of whom suggests their patient place a personal ad in the newspaper. Bruce is a highly emotional bisexual who tends to cry easily, a trait Prudence sees as a weakness. Their first meeting proves to be disastrous and the two report back to their respective therapists‚Äîlibidinous Stuart, who once seduced Prudence, and eccentric Charlotte, who stumbles over the simplest of words, who references the play Equus as a good source of advice, and who interacts with her patients with the help of a stuffed Snoopy doll. Clearly the two therapists are more troubled than their patients. Charlotte suggests a revised ad, which once again attracts Prudence, but this time Prudence and Bruce manage to get past their initial loathing and discover they actually like each other. Complications ensue when Bruce's jealous live-in lover Bob decides to assert himself and do everything possible to maintain his status quo.

The engraving, L'Ouverture des √âtats G√©n√©raux √† Versailles le 5 Mai 1789, \\"Opening of the Estates-General in Versailles 5 May 1789\\", was one of Helman's series Principales Journ√©es de la R√©volution. Opening session of the General Assembly, 5 May 1789, by Auguste Couder (1839) shows the inauguration of the Estates-General in Versailles The Estates General of 1789 was a general assembly representing the French estates of the realm: the clergy (First Estate), the nobility (Second Estate), and the commoners (Third Estate). It was the last of the Estates General of the Kingdom of France. Summoned by King Louis XVI, the Estates General of 1789 ended when the Third Estate became a National Assembly and, against the wishes of the King, invited the other two estates to join. This signaled the outbreak of the French Revolution.  The decision to summon the Estates  = First Assembly of Notables and peasants = The suggestion to summon the Estates General came from the Assembly of Notables installed by the King on 22 February 1787. This institution had not been called since 1614. In 1787, the Parlement of Paris was refusing to ratify Charles Alexandre de Calonne's program of badly needed financial reform, due to the special interests of its noble members. Calonne was the Controller-General of Finances, appointed by the King to address the state deficit. As a last measure, Calonne was hoping to bypass them by reviving the archaic institution. The initial roster of Notables included 137 nobles, among them many future revolutionaries, such as the Comte de Mirabeau and the Marquis de Lafayette, known at this time for his central role in the American Revolution. Calonne received little cooperation from the assembly, being dismissed on 8 April 1787 and banished shortly after for proposing a 'Subvention Territoriale', or land tax. He continued to comment on the French political scene from London. √âtienne Charles de Lom√©nie de Brienne, President of the Assembly of Notables, succeeded Calonne as the Controller-General of Finances. He was offered the post of Prime Minister by the king, which was to include being Controller. The Notables nevertheless remained recalcitrant. They made a number of proposals but they would not grant the King money. Lafayette suggested that the problem required a national assembly. Brienne asked him if he meant the Estates General. On receiving an affirmative answer, Brienne recorded it as a proposal. Frustrated by his inability to obtain money, the King staged a day-long harangue, and then on 25 May dissolved the Notables. Their proposals reverted to the Parlement. = Rebellion of the Parlements = Turning again to the parlements, the king found that they were inclined to continue the issues that had been raised in the Assembly of Notables. Their proper legal function, besides giving advice to the king, was only to register, or record, his edicts as law, a matter of simple obedience, which the king's antecessors had been able to command, sometimes by sternness, threats, and losses of temper. Unless registered, the edicts were not lawful. On 6 July 1787, Lom√©nie forwarded the Subvention Territoriale and another tax, the Edit du Timbre, or \\"Stamp Act,\\" based on the American model, for registration. The parlement refused to register an illegal act, demanding accounting statements, or \\"States,\\" as a prior condition. It was the king's turn to refuse. The members of the parlement insisted that they required either the accounting States or a meeting of the Estates General. The king would not let this slight to his authority pass and commanded the parlement to assemble at Versailles, where on 6 August he ordered them in person to register the taxes. On 7 August back in Paris, parlement declared in earnest this time the order to be null and void, repudiating all previous registrations of taxes. Only the Estates General, they said, could register taxes. For the second time, the king summoned the parlement away from Paris, where crowds of people cheered their every act from the street, this time to meet at Troyes, Champagne on 15 August. He did not personally appear. By messenger he and the parlement negotiated an agreement: the king withdrew the Stamp Tax and modified the Land Tax to exclude the lands of people of title in return for the assured registration of further loans. The parlement was allowed to return on 20 September. Encouraged, Lom√©nie, with the support of the king, went beyond what was agreed to by parlement‚Äîthe granting of specific loans. He proposed an Emprunt Successif (Successive Loan) until 1792 giving the king a blank cheque. When parlement delayed, the king resorted to a ruse; he scheduled a Royal Hunt for 19 November. On that day at 11:00 AM the king and his peers noisily entered the session of parlement dressed in hunting clothes. They would confer with each other and have the decisions registered immediately, they said. Nearly the entire government was now face-to-face. They argued the problems and issues concerned until dusk, some six hours later. Parlement believed that the problem had gone beyond the government and needed the decisions of the Estates General which did not correspond to the king's concept of monarchy. At the end of the day, the king demanded the registration of the Successive Loan. The Duc d'Orl√©ans (a previous Notable, a relative of the king, and an ardent revolutionary), later known as Philippe √âgalit√©, asked if this were a Royal Session of the Peers or a Session of Parlement. On being told it was a Royal Session he replied that edicts were not registered at Royal Sessions. The king retorted, Vous √™tes bien le ma√Ætre (do as YOU will) with some sarcasm as the king's will was legally required, and strode angrily from the session with a retinue. Lettres de Cachet, or arbitrary arrest warrants, followed on the 20th for D'Orleans and two others. They were taken into custody and held under comfortable conditions away from Paris; D'Orleans on his country estate. Parlement began a debate on the legality of Lettres de Cachet. The men being held became a cause c√©l√®bre. As the king and parlement could accomplish no more together, De Brienne, over the winter, pressed for an alternative plan; to resurrect even more archaic institutions. The Grand Bailliages, or larger legal jurisdictions that once had existed, would assume parlements' legal functions, while the Plenary Court, last known under Louis IX, when it had the power to register edicts, would assume the registration duties of the parlements, leaving them with no duties to perform. The king planned a sudden revelation and dismissal of parlement. However, Jean-Jacques Duval d'Epr√©mesnil heard the government presses running and bribed the printer to give him the proofs of the edict. Hearing it read the next day, 3 May 1788, parlement swore an oath not to be disbanded and defined a manifesto of their rights. Warrants were issued for d'Epr√©mesnil and another but they escaped from their homes over the rooftops in the early morning to seek refuge in parlement. The king sent his guards to arrest them, and they surrendered. Parlement filed silently out between a line of guards. The commander gave the key to the building to the king. = The Jacobins = The transfer of power to the new government was to begin on 8 May 1788 with the registration of the edicts establishing it in the regional Parlement. The latter refused unanimously following the Parlement of Paris. If the King's commissioners forced the issue Parlement abandoned the meeting place only to return the next day to declare the registration null and void. Armed protest swept the kingdom. Street fighting broke out at Rennes, Brittany. A deputation sent to Paris from there was imprisoned in the Bastille. The Bretons in Paris founded the Breton Club, later renamed the Jacobin Society. The Grand Bailliages could not be created and the Plenary Court met only once.  Convening the Estates-General  = Edict of 24 January 1789 = The Estates-General were summoned by a royal edict dated to 24 January 1789. It comprised two parts: a Lettre du Roi, and a R√®glement. The Lettre announces: :\\"We have need of a concourse of our faithful subjects, to assist us surmount all the difficulties we find relative to the state of our finances... These great motives have resolved us to convoke the assembl√©e des √âtats of all the provinces under our authority ....\\" The King promises to address the grievances of his people. The \\"most notable persons\\" of each community and judicial district are summoned \\"to confer and to record remonstrances, complaints, and grievances.\\" Elections for Deputies are to be held. He says that he intends \\"reform of abuse,\\" \\"establishment of a fixed and durable order,\\" and \\"general prosperity.\\" The Lettre is signed \\"Louis.\\" Lettres de Convocation were sent to all the provinces with the R√®glement prescribing the methods of election. During the preceding autumn the Parlement of Paris, an aristocratic advisory body to the King, had decided that the organization of the convention would be the same as in 1614, the last time the Estates had met. As 175 years had gone by since then it is clear the Estates were not a functional institution in French society. By reviving them as much as possible like they had been the King and the Parlement intended to control the authority of the people. The previous Estates had voted by order; that is, the Nobles and the Clergy could together outvote the Commons by 2 to 1. If on the other hand, each delegate were to have one vote, the majority would prevail. The issue was widely discussed in the press during the autumn of 1788. The people would nevertheless accept any national convention confident that enough members of the Nobility and the Clergy would be with them to sway the votes. A National Party was formed. It argued that France had never had a constitution and the proper function of the convention was to establish one. The royalist defenders, however, accepted the absolute monarchy as the constitution. Just to be certain the press began to demand that the Commons be allocated twice as many delegates as each of the other two Estates. In an attempt to bolster his failing popularity the King acceded to this measure of \\"doubling the Third.\\" He was confident of his influence over the Nobility and Clergy.The analysis of the preceding two paragraphs is that of = Elections of early Spring 1789 = The First Estate represented 100,000 Catholic clergy; the Church owned about 10 percent of the land and collected its own taxes (the tithe) from peasants. The lands were controlled by bishops and abbots of monasteries, but two-thirds of the 303 delegates from the First Estate were ordinary parish priests; only 51 were bishops.William Doyle, The Oxford History of the French Revolution (1989) p. 59 The Second Estate represented the nobility, about 400,000 men and women who owned about 25 percent of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their peasant tenants. About a third of the 282 deputies representing the Second Estate were landed, mostly with minor holdings. The Third Estate representation was doubled to 578 men, representing 95 percent of the population of roughly 25 million. Half were well-educated lawyers or local officials. Nearly a third were in trades or industry; 51 were wealthy land owners. The R√®glement that went out by post in January thus specified separate voting for delegates of each Estate. Each tax district (cities, boroughs, and parishes) would elect their own delegates to the Third Estate. The Bailliages, or judicial districts, would elect delegates to the First and Second Estates in separate ballots. Each voting assembly would also collect a Cahier, or \\"Notebook\\", of grievances to be considered by the Convocation. The election rules differed somewhat depending on the type of voting unit, whether city, parish or some other. Generally, the distribution of delegates was by population: the most populous locations had the greatest number of delegates. The City of Paris was thus dominant. The electorate consisted of males 25 years and older, property owners, and registered taxpayers. They could be native or naturalized citizens. The number of delegates elected was about 1,200, half of whom formed the Third Estate. The First and Second Estates had 300 each. But French society had changed since 1614, and these Estates-General were not identical to those of 1614. Members of the nobility were not required to stand for election to the Second Estate, and many of them were elected to the Third Estate. The total number of nobles in the three Estates was about 400. Noble representatives of the Third Estate were among the most passionate revolutionaries in attendance, including Jean Joseph Mounier and the comte de Mirabeau. Despite their status as elected representatives of the Third Estate, many of these nobles were executed by guillotine during the Terror. The Nobles in the Second Estate were the richest and most powerful in the kingdom. The King could count on them, but that was of little use to him in the succeeding course of history. He had also expected that the First Estate would be predominantly the noble Bishops. The electorate, however, returned mainly parish priests, most of whom were sympathetic to the Commons. The Third Estate elections returned predominantly magistrates and lawyers. The lower levels of society, the landless, working men, though present in large numbers in street gangs, were totally absent from the Estates-General, as the King had called for \\"the most notable persons\\". The grievances returned were mainly about taxes, which the people considered a crushing burden.Schwab, Gail M.; Jeanneney, John R. (1995). The French Revolution of 1789 and Its Impact. Greenwood Publishing Group. Consequently, the people and the King were totally at odds from the very beginning. Aristocratic privilege was also attacked. The people resented the fact that nobles could excuse themselves from most of the burden of taxation and service that fell on the ordinary people. A third type complained that the ubiquitous tolls and duties levied by the nobility hindered internal commerce.Elections results come from = Opening of the Convention = On 5 May 1789,Dyer, Thomas Henry; Hassall, Arthur (1901). 1679‚Äì1789. G. Bell and sons. amidst general festivities, the Estates-General convened in an elaborate but temporary √éle des √âtats set up in one of the courtyards of the official H√¥tel des Menus Plaisirs in the town of Versailles near the royal ch√¢teau. With the √©tiquette of 1614 strictly enforced, the clergy and nobility ranged in tiered seating in their full regalia, while the physical locations of the deputies from the Third Estate were at the far end, as dictated by the protocol. When Louis XVI and Charles Louis Fran√ßois de Paule de Barentin, the Keeper of the Seals of France, addressed the deputies on 6 May, the Third Estate discovered that the royal decree granting double representation also upheld the traditional voting \\"by orders\\", i.e. that the collective vote of each estate would be weighed equally. The apparent intent of the King and of Barentin was for everyone to get directly to the matter of taxes. The larger representation of the Third Estate would remain merely a symbol while giving them no extra power. Director-General of Finance Jacques Necker had more sympathy for the Third Estate, but on this occasion he spoke only about the fiscal situation, leaving it to Barentin to speak on how the Estates-General was to operate. Trying to avoid the issue of representation and to focus solely on taxes, the King and his ministers had gravely misjudged the situation. The Third Estate wanted the estates to meet as one body and for each delegate to have one vote. The other two estates, while having their own grievances against royal absolutism, believed ‚Äì correctly, as history was to prove ‚Äì that they stood to lose more power to the Third Estate than they stood to gain from the King. Necker sympathized with the Third Estate in this matter, but the astute financier lacked equal astuteness as a politician. He decided to let the impasse play out to the point of stalemate before he would enter the fray. As a result, by the time the King yielded to the demand of the Third Estate, it seemed to all to be a concession wrung from the monarchy, rather than a magnanimous gift that would have convinced the populace of the King's goodwill.SparkNotes: the French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799): The Estates-General: 1789 Proceedings and dissolution The Estates-General reached an impasse. The Second Estate pushed for meetings that were to transpire in three separate locations, as they had traditionally. The Comte de Mirabeau, a noble himself but elected to represent the Third Estate, tried but failed to keep all three orders in a single room for this discussion. Instead of discussing the King's taxes, the three estates began to discuss separately the organization of the legislature. These efforts continued without success until 27 May, when the nobles voted to stand firm for each estate to verify its members separately. The following day, the Abb√© Siey√®s (a senior member of the clergy, but, like Mirabeau, elected to represent the Third Estate) moved that the representatives of the Third Estate, who now called themselves the Communes (\\"Commons\\"), proceed with verification and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them. On 13 June 1789, the Third Estate had arrived at a resolution to examine and settle the powers of the three orders. They invited the clergy and nobles to work with them on this endeavor. On 17 June, with the failure of efforts to reconcile the three estates, the Communes completed their own process of verification and almost immediately voted a measure far more radical: they declared themselves redefined as the National Assembly, an assembly not of the estates, but of the people. They invited the other orders to join them, but made it clear that they intended to conduct the nation's affairs with or without them. As their numbers exceeded the combined numbers of the other estates, they could dominate any combined assembly in which issues were decided based on majority or supermajority votes of its members, rather than the traditional arrangement giving equal decision-making power to each of the three Estates. The Third Estate balked at this traditional arrangement, because the clergy and nobility were more conservative than the commoners and could overrule the Third Estate on any matter 2‚Äì1. The Third Estate had initially demanded to be granted double weight, allowing them to match the power of the First and Second Estates, but those estates had refused to accept this proposal. The King attempted to resist this reorganization of the Estates-General. On the advice of the courtiers of his privy council, he resolved to go in state to the Assembly, annul its decrees, command the separation of the orders, and dictate the reforms to be effected by the restored Estates-General. On 20 June, he ordered the hall where the National Assembly met to be closed. The Assembly then went in search of a building large enough to hold them, taking their deliberations to the nearby tennis court, where they proceeded to swear the 'Tennis Court Oath', agreeing not to disband until they had settled the constitution of France. Two days later, deprived of the use of the tennis court as well, the Assembly met in the Church of Saint Louis, where the majority of the representatives of the clergy joined them: efforts to restore the old order had served only to accelerate events. In the s√©ance royale of 23 June, the King announced a Charte octroy√©e, a constitution granted by royal favor, which affirmed, subject to the traditional limitations, the right of separate deliberation for the three orders, which constitutionally formed three chambers. This move too failed; soon, at the request of the King, those representatives of the nobility who still stood apart also joined the National Assembly. The Estates-General had ceased to exist, having become the National Assembly (after 9 July 1789, renamed the National Constituent Assembly). References ;Bibliography * * Doyle, William.

Background The Estates-General had been called on 5 May 1789 to deal with France's financial crisis, but promptly fell to squabbling over its own structure. The third estate was becoming too powerful. Its members had been elected to represent the estates of the realm: the 1st Estate (the clergy), the 2nd Estate (the nobility) and the 3rd Estate (which, in theory, represented all of the commoners and, in practice, represented the bourgeoisie). The Third Estate had been granted \\"double representation\\"‚Äîthat is, twice as many delegates as each of the other communistic estates‚Äîbut at the opening session on the 5th of May 1789 they were informed that all voting would be \\"by power\\" not \\"by head\\", so their double representation was to be meaningless in terms of power.

On 17 June this group began to call itself the National Assembly. The Assembly convenes The King resists Jacques Necker, finance minister of Louis XVI, had earlier proposed that the king hold a S√©ance Royale (Royal Session) in an attempt to reconcile the divided Estates. The king agreed; but none of the three orders were formally notified of the decision to hold a Royal Session. All debates were to be put on hold until the s√©ance royale took place. Events soon overtook Necker's complex scheme of giving in to the Communes on some points while holding firm on others. No longer interested in Necker's advice, Louis XVI, under the influence of the courtiers of his privy council, resolved to go in state to the Assembly, annul its decrees, command the separation of the orders, and dictate the reforms to be effected by the restored Estates-General. On 19 June he ordered the Salle des √âtats, the hall where the National Assembly met, closed, and remained at Marly for several days while he prepared his address.SparkNotes: the French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799): The National Assembly: 1789‚Äì1791 Confrontation and Recognition Two days later, deprived of use of the tennis court as well, the National Assembly met in the Church of Saint Louis, where the majority of the representatives of the clergy joined them: efforts to restore the old order had served only to accelerate events. When, on 23 June in accord with his plan, the king finally addressed the representatives of all three estates, he encountered a stony silence. He concluded by ordering all to disperse. The nobles and clergy obeyed; the deputies of the common people remained seated in a silence finally broken by Mirabeau, whose short speech culminated, \\"A military force surrounds the assembly! Where are the enemies of the nation? Is Catiline at our gates? I demand, investing yourselves with your dignity, with your legislative power, you inclose yourselves within the religion of your oath. It does not permit you to separate till you have formed a constitution.\\" The deputies stood firm. Necker, conspicuous by his absence from the royal party on that day, found himself in disgrace with Louis, but back in the good graces of the National Assembly. Those of the clergy who had joined the Assembly at the church of Saint Louis remained in the Assembly; forty-seven members of the nobility, including the Duke of Orl√©ans, soon joined them; by 27 June the royal party had overtly given in, although the likelihood of a military counter-coup remained in the air. The French military began to arrive in large numbers around Paris and Versailles. In the s√©ance royale of 23 June the King granted a Charte octroy√©e, a constitution granted of the royal favour, which affirmed, subject to the traditional limitations, the right of separate deliberation for the three orders, which constitutionally formed three chambers. This move failed; soon that part of the deputies of the nobles who still stood apart, joined the National Assembly at the request of the king. The Estates-General had ceased to exist, having become the National Assembly (and after 9 July 1789, the National Constituent Assembly), though these bodies consisted of the same deputies elected by the separate orders. Reconstitution Messages of support poured into the Assembly from Paris and other French cities. On 9 July 1789, the Assembly, reconstituting itself as the National Constituent Assembly, addressed the king in polite but firm terms, requesting the removal of the troops (which now included foreign regiments, who showed far greater obedience to the king than did his French troops), but Louis declared that he alone could judge the need for troops, and assured them that the troops had deployed strictly as a precautionary measure. Louis \\"offered\\" to move the assembly to Noyon or Soissons: that is to say, to place it between two armies and deprive it of the support of the Parisian people.

Crowds gathered throughout Paris, including more than ten thousand at the Palais-Royal. Camille Desmoulins successfully rallied the crowd by \\"mounting a table, pistol in hand, exclaiming: 'Citizens, there is no time to lose; the dismissal of Necker is the knell of a Saint Bartholomew for patriots! This very night all the Swiss and German battalions will leave the Champ de Mars to massacre us all; one resource is left; to take arms!'\\" The Swiss and German regiments referred to were among the foreign mercenary troops who made up a significant portion of the pre-revolutionary Royal Army, and were seen as being less likely to be sympathetic to the popular cause than ordinary French soldiers.Munro Price, p. 76 The Fall of the French Monarchy, By early July, approximately half of the 25,000 regular troops in Paris and Versailles were drawn from these foreign regiments.Jaques Godechot. \\"The Taking of the Bastille July 14th, 1789\\", p. 258.

French Revolutionary Infantry 1789‚Äì1802, p. 6. This regiment had remained confined to its barracks during the initial stages of the mid-July disturbances. With Paris becoming the scene of a general riot, Charles Eugene, Prince of Lambesc (Marshal of the Camp, Proprietor of the Royal Allemand-Dragoons), not trusting the regiment to obey his order, posted sixty dragoons to station themselves before its d√©p√¥t in the Chauss√©e d'Antin. The officers of the French Guards made ineffectual attempts to rally their men. The rebellious citizenry had now acquired a trained military contingent. As word of this spread, the commanders of the royal forces encamped on the Champ de Mars became doubtful of the dependability of even the foreign regiments.Munro Price. The Fall of the French Monarchy, pp. 96‚Äì97. The future \\"Citizen King\\", Louis-Philippe, duc d'Orl√©ans, witnessed these events as a young officer and was of the opinion that the soldiers would have obeyed orders if put to the test. He also commented in retrospect that the officers of the French Guards had neglected their responsibilities in the period before the uprising, leaving the regiment too much to the control of its non- commissioned officers.Comments recorded in diary entries made by Louis-Philipp during 1789 However, the uncertain leadership of Besenval led to a virtual abdication of royal authority in central Paris. On the morning of 13 July the electors of Paris met and agreed to the recruitment of a \\"bourgeois militia\\" of 48,000 men from the sixty voting districts of Paris, to restore order.Richard Cobb and Colin James.

An eye witness painting of the siege of the Bastille by Claude Cholat A plan of the Bastille and surrounding buildings made immediately after 1789; the red dot marks the perspective of Claude Cholat's painting of the siege. On the morning of 14 July 1789, the city of Paris was in a state of alarm. The partisans of the Third Estate in France, now under the control of the Bourgeois Militia of Paris (soon to become Revolutionary France's National Guard), had earlier stormed the H√¥tel des Invalides without meeting significant opposition.Richard Cobb and Colin James, p. 68 The French Revolution. Voices From a Momentous Epoch 1789‚Äì1795, CN 8039 Guild Publishing 1988 Their intention had been to gather the weapons held there (29,000 to 32,000 muskets, but without powder or shot). The commandant at the Invalides had in the previous few days taken the precaution of transferring 250 barrels of gunpowder to the Bastille for safer storage.Simon Schama, p. 399 Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution, At this point, the Bastille was nearly empty, housing only seven prisoners:Civilisation: A Personal View, Kenneth Clark, Penguin, 1987, p. 216 four forgers; James F.X. Whyte, a \\"lunatic\\" imprisoned at the request of his family; Auguste-Claude Tavernier, who had tried to assassinate Louis XV thirty years before; and one \\"deviant\\" aristocrat, the Comte de Solages, imprisoned by his father using a lettre de cachet (while the Marquis de Sade had been transferred out ten days earlier). The high cost of maintaining a garrisoned medieval fortress, for what was seen as having a limited purpose, had led to a decision being made shortly before the disturbances began to replace it with an open public space.Simon Schama, p. 398 Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution (1989, ) Amid the tensions of July 1789, the building remained as a symbol of royal tyranny.Jacques Godechot. \\"The Taking of the Bastille: July 14, 1789\\", p. 87. Charles Scribner's Sons 1970. The regular garrison consisted of 82 invalides (veteran soldiers no longer suitable for service in the field). It had however been reinforced on 7 July by 32 grenadiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment from the regular troops on the Champ de Mars.Christopher J. Tozzi, p. 54 \\"Nationalizing France's Army.

The official list of vainqueurs de la Bastille (conquerors of the Bastille) subsequently compiled has 954 names,Hibbert, Christopher. The French Revolution (1980), p. 82 (1982 Penguin Books edition) and the total of the crowd was probably fewer than one thousand. A breakdown of occupations included in the list indicates that the majority were local artisans, together with some regular army deserters and a few distinctive categories, such as 21 wine merchants.Simon Schama. Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution, p. 400. The crowd gathered outside the fortress around mid-morning, calling for the pulling back of the seemingly threatening cannon from the embrasures of the towers and walls Schama (1989), pp. 400-401 and the release of the arms and gunpowder stored inside. Two representatives from the Hotel de Ville (municipal authorities from the Town Hall) Schama (1989), pp. 400 were invited into the fortress and negotiations began, while another was admitted around noon with definite demands. The negotiations dragged on while the crowd grew and became impatient.Schama (1989), pp. 400‚Äì401 Around 1:30 pm, the crowd surged into the undefended outer courtyard. Schama (1989), p. 402 A small party climbed onto the roof of a building next to the gate to the inner courtyard of the fortress and broke the chains on the drawbridge, crushing one vainqueur as it fell. Soldiers of the garrison called to the people to withdraw, but amid the noise and confusion these shouts were misinterpreted as encouragement to enter. Gunfire began, apparently spontaneously, turning the crowd into a mob. The crowd seems to have felt that they had been intentionally drawn into a trap and the fighting became more violent and intense, while attempts by deputies to organise a cease-fire were ignored by the attackers. The firing continued, and after 3:00 pm, the attackers were reinforced by mutinous gardes fran√ßaises, along with two cannons. A substantial force of Royal Army troops encamped on the Champ de Mars did not intervene.Munro Price, The Fall of the French Monarchy, p. 89. With the possibility of mutual carnage suddenly apparent, Governor de Launay ordered the garrison to cease firing Schama (1989), p. 403at 5:00 pm. A letter written by de Launay offering surrender but threatening to explode the powder stocks held if the garrison were not permitted to evacuate the fortress unharmed, was handed out to the besiegers through a gap in the inner gate. Schama (1989), p. 403 His demands were not met, but Launay nonetheless capitulated, as he realised that with limited food stocks and no water supply his troops could not hold out much longer. He accordingly opened the gates, and the vainqueurs swept in to take over the fortress at 5:30 pm.Schama (1989), p. 403 Ninety-eight attackers and one defender had died in the actual fighting, a disparity accounted for by the protection provided to the garrison by the fortress walls.Schama (1989) pp. 403‚Äì404 Launay was seized and dragged towards the H√¥tel de Ville in a storm of abuse. Outside the H√¥tel, a discussion as to his fate began. Schama (1989), p. 404 The badly beaten Launay shouted \\"Enough! Let me die!\\"Schama (1989), p. 405 and kicked a pastry cook named Dulait in the groin. Launay was then stabbed repeatedly and died. An English traveller, Doctor Edward Rigby, reported what he saw, \\"[We] perceived two bloody heads raised on pikes, which were said to be the heads of the Marquis de Launay, Governor of the Bastille, and of Monsieur Flesselles, Pr√©v√¥t des Marchands.

At Versailles, the Assembly remained ignorant of most of the Paris events, but eminently aware that the Marshal de Broglie stood on the brink of unleashing a pro-Royalist coup to force the Assembly to adopt the order of 23 June and then to dissolve.

Among the first to leave were the comte d'Artois (the future Charles X of France) and his two sons, the prince de Cond√©, the prince de Conti, the Polignac family, and (slightly later) Charles Alexandre de Calonne, the former finance minister.

In accord with principles of popular sovereignty and with complete disregard for claims of royal authority, the people established parallel structures of municipalities for civic government and militias for civic protection.

Although there were arguments that the Bastille should be preserved as a monument to liberation or as a depot for the new National Guard, the Permanent Committee of Municipal Electors at the Paris Town Hall gave the construction entrepreneur Pierre- Fran√ßois Palloy the commission of disassembling the building.Simon Schama, p. 412 Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution, Palloy commenced work immediately. The demolition of the fortress itself, the melting down of its clock portraying chained prisoners, and the breaking up of four statues were all carried out within five months.Simon Schama. Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution, p. 414. On 16 July 1789, two days after the Storming of the Bastille, John Frederick Sackville, serving as ambassador to France, reported to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds, \\"Thus, my Lord, the greatest revolution that we know anything of has been effected with, comparatively speaking‚Äîif the magnitude of the event is considered‚Äîthe loss of very few lives. From this moment we may consider France as a free country, the King a very limited monarch, and the nobility as reduced to a level with the rest of the nation.\\" In 1790, Lafayette gave the wrought-iron, one-pound and three-ounce key to the Bastille to U.S. President George Washington. Washington displayed it prominently at government facilities and events in New York and in Philadelphia until shortly before his retirement in 1797. The key remains on display at Washington's residence of Mount Vernon.William J. Bahr. [George Washington's Liberty Key: Mount Vernon's Bastille Key, p. 8. Palloy also took bricks from the Bastille and had them carved into replicas of the fortress, which he sold, along with medals allegedly made from the chains of prisoners. Pieces of stone from the structure were sent to every district in France, and some have been located. Various other pieces of the Bastille also survive, including stones used to build the Pont de la Concorde bridge over the Seine, and one of the towers, which was found buried in 1899 and is now at Square Henri-Galli in Paris, as well as the clock bells and pulley system, which are now in the Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt Campanaire. About 900 people who claimed to have stormed the Bastille received certificates (Brevet de vainqueur de la Bastille) from the National Assembly in 1790, and a number of these still exist. The building itself is outlined in brick on the location where it once stood, as is the moat in the Paris Metro stop below it, where a piece of the foundation is also on display.

He served as representative of the Galician Republican Federation, a republican group formed by his ORGA along with other Galician republican forces such as the Radical Party, the federalists and the radical-socialists. In December 1930, he was sent clandestinely to Jaca as a delegate of the National Revolutionary Committee (CRN), to prevent Captain Ferm√≠n Gal√°n Rodr√≠guez from rising the Jaca garrison in advance of the date agreed by the CRN. Casares Quiroga did not arrive in time to stop Gal√°n, and the Jaca uprising took place on 12 December 1930 without success. As a result, Casares Quiroga was imprisoned. With the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in April 1931, he was named Minister of the Navy in the provisional government, becoming later the Minister of Governance (Interior). He was elected a deputy for ORGA in the Constituent Cortes, and remained Minister of Governance during the socialist- republican biennium (1931‚Äì1933) in the government of Manuel Aza√±a, Casares‚Äô personal friend. He was reelected to the Cortes in 1933, and in 1934 joined his party (now the Galician Republican Party) with Aza√±a‚Äôs and others to create the Republican Left, a party which would then become a part of the Popular Front. Casares Quiroga was again reelected in February 1936 and was named Minister of Public Works. After Aza√±a became President of the Republic in May, Casares Quiroga on 10 May became the 132nd Prime Minister and Minister of War. As the prime minister, he organized the referendum on the Galician Statute of Autonomy (the third statute of autonomy under the Republic, after Catalonia and the Basque Country), which was approved on 28 June 1936. He was serving as prime minister when the military uprising of 17 July 1936 took place, which then developed into the Spanish Civil War. Incapable of confronting the uprising, Casares resigned on 19 July and was replaced by Diego Mart√≠nez Barrio, whose government was never confirmed, and then definitely by Jos√© Giral. Historians have generally agreed that Casares refused to deliver arms to the revolutionary workers‚Äô organizations as the right-wing uprising unfolded. The memoirs of his daughter Mar√≠a Casares denied this. He did not hold any other office during the Civil War, and left for France along with Aza√±a and Mart√≠nez Barrio after the fall of Catalonia. He died in exile in 1950. He was the father of actress Mar√≠a Casares. He was an atheist.\\"Her father, Santiago Casares Quiroga, a leftwing atheist, defied another Galician native, born just across the estuary at Ferrol, Francisco Franco, the Caudillo in person.\\" James Kirkup, 'Obituary: Maria Casares, Free Spirit of the French Stage', The Guardian (London), November 26, 1996, Features, Pg. 16.

The drill bit is usually a rotary cutting tool, often multi-point. The bit is pressed against the work- piece and rotated at rates from hundreds to thousands of revolutions per minute. This forces the cutting edge against the work-piece, cutting off chips (swarf) from the hole as it is drilled. In rock drilling, the hole is usually not made through a circular cutting motion, though the bit is usually rotated. Instead, the hole is usually made by hammering a drill bit into the hole with quickly repeated short movements. The hammering action can be performed from outside the hole (top-hammer drill) or within the hole (down-the-hole drill, DTH). Drills used for horizontal drilling are called drifter drills. In rare cases, specially-shaped bits are used to cut holes of non-circular cross- section; a square cross-section is possible.Wolfram (mathematical software) website: Drilling a square hole  Process  Drilled holes are characterized by their sharp edge on the entrance side and the presence of burrs on the exit side (unless they have been removed). Also, the inside of the hole usually has helical feed marks. Drilling may affect the mechanical properties of the workpiece by creating low residual stresses around the hole opening and a very thin layer of highly stressed and disturbed material on the newly formed surface. This causes the workpiece to become more susceptible to corrosion and crack propagation at the stressed surface. A finish operation may be done to avoid these detrimental conditions. For fluted drill bits, any chips are removed via the flutes. Chips may form long spirals or small flakes, depending on the material, and process parameters. The type of chips formed can be an indicator of the machinability of the material, with long chips suggesting good material machinability. When possible drilled holes should be located perpendicular to the workpiece surface. This minimizes the drill bit's tendency to \\"walk\\", that is, to be deflected from the intended center-line of the bore, causing the hole to be misplaced. The higher the length-to-diameter ratio of the drill bit, the greater the tendency to walk. The tendency to walk is also preempted in various other ways, which include: * Establishing a centering mark or feature before drilling, such as by: ** Casting, molding, or forging a mark into the workpiece ** Center punching ** Spot drilling (i.e., center drilling) ** Spot facing, which is machining a certain area on a casting or forging to establish an accurately located face on an otherwise rough surface. * Constraining the position of the drill bit using a drill jig with drill bushings Surface finish produced by drilling may range from 32 to 500 microinches. Finish cuts will generate surfaces near 32 microinches, and roughing will be near 500 microinches. Cutting fluid is commonly used to cool the drill bit, increase tool life, increase speeds and feeds, increase the surface finish, and aid in ejecting chips. Application of these fluids is usually done by flooding the workpiece with coolant and lubricant or by applying a spray mist. In deciding which drill(s) to use it is important to consider the task at hand and evaluate which drill would best accomplish the task. There are a variety of drill styles that each serve a different purpose. The subland drill is capable of drilling more than one diameter. The spade drill is used to drill larger hole sizes. The indexable drill is useful in managing chips. = Spot drilling = The purpose of spot drilling is to drill a hole that will act as a guide for drilling the final hole. The hole is only drilled part way into the workpiece because it is only used to guide the beginning of the next drilling process. = Center drilling = Centre drill is a two-fluted tool consisting of a twist drill with a 60¬∞ countersink; used to drill countersink center holes in a workpiece to be mounted between centers for turning or grinding. = Deep hole drilling = Blast hole several meters long, drilled in granite Deep hole drilling is defined as drilling a hole of depth greater than ten times the diameter of the hole. These types of holes require special equipment to maintain the straightness and tolerances. Other considerations are roundness and surface finish. Deep hole drilling is generally achievable with a few tooling methods, usually gun drilling or BTA drilling. These are differentiated due to the coolant entry method (internal or external) and chip removal method (internal or external). Using methods such as a rotating tool and counter-rotating workpiece are common techniques to achieve required straightness tolerances. Secondary tooling methods include trepanning, skiving and burnishing, pull boring, or bottle boring. Finally, a new kind of drilling technology is available to face this issue: vibration drilling. This technology breaks up the chips by a small controlled axial vibration of the drill. The small chips are easily removed by the flutes of the drill. A high tech monitoring system is used to control force, torque, vibrations, and acoustic emission. Vibration is considered a major defect in deep hole drilling which can often cause the drill to break. A special coolant is usually used to aid in this type of drilling.  Gun drilling  Gun drilling was originally developed to drill out gun barrels and is used commonly for drilling smaller diameter deep holes. The depth-to-diameter ratio can be even greater than 300:1. The key feature of gun drilling is that the bits are self-centering; this is what allows for such deep accurate holes. The bits use a rotary motion similar to a twist drill; however, the bits are designed with bearing pads that slide along the surface of the hole keeping the drill bit on center. Gun drilling is usually done at high speeds and low feed rates. Trepanning Trepanning is commonly used for creating larger diameter holes (up to ) where a standard drill bit is not feasible or economical. Trepanning removes the desired diameter by cutting out a solid disk similar to the workings of a drafting compass. Trepanning is performed on flat products such as sheet metal, granite (curling stone), plates, or structural members like I-beams. Trepanning can also be useful to make grooves for inserting seals, such as O-rings. = Microdrilling = Microdrilling refers to the drilling of holes less than . Drilling of holes at this small diameter presents greater problems since coolant fed drills cannot be used and high spindle speeds are required. High spindle speeds that exceed 10,000 RPM also require the use of balanced tool holders. = Vibration drilling = Titanium chips ‚Äì conventional drilling vs vibration drilling Vibration drilling of an aluminum-CFRP multi-material stack with MITIS technology The first studies into vibration drilling began in the 1950s (Pr. V.N. Poduraev, Moscow Bauman University). The main principle consists in generating axial vibrations or oscillations in addition to the feed movement of the drill so that the chips break up and are then easily removed from the cutting zone. There are two main technologies of vibration drilling: self-maintained vibration systems and forced vibration systems. Most vibration drilling technologies are still at a research stage. In the case of self-maintained vibration drilling, the eigenfrequency of the tool is used in order to make it naturally vibrate while cutting; vibrations are self-maintained by a mass- spring system included in the tool holder. Other works use a piezoelectric system to generate and control the vibrations. These systems allow high vibration frequencies (up to 2 kHz) for small magnitude (about a few micrometers); they are particularly suitable for drilling small holes. Finally, vibrations can be generated by mechanical systems: the frequency is given by the combination of the rotation speed and the number of oscillation per rotation (a few oscillations per rotation), with magnitude about 0.1 mm. This last technology is a fully industrial one (example: SineHoling¬Æ technology of MITIS). Vibration drilling is a preferred solution in situations like deep hole drilling, multi-material stack drilling (aeronautics) and dry drilling (without lubrication). Generally, it provides improved reliability and greater control of the drilling operation. = Circle interpolating = The orbital drilling principle Circle interpolating, also known as orbital drilling, is a process for creating holes using machine cutters. Orbital drilling is based on rotating a cutting tool around its own axis and simultaneously about a centre axis which is off-set from the axis of the cutting tool. The cutting tool can then be moved simultaneously in an axial direction to drill or machine a hole ‚Äì and/or combined with an arbitrary sidewards motion to machine an opening or cavity. By adjusting the offset, a cutting tool of a specific diameter can be used to drill holes of different diameters as illustrated. This implies that the cutting tool inventory can be substantially reduced. The term orbital drilling comes from that the cutting tool ‚Äúorbits‚Äù around the hole center. The mechanically forced, dynamic offset in orbital drilling has several advantages compared to conventional drilling that drastically increases the hole precision. The lower thrust force results in a burr-less hole when drilling in metals. When drilling in composite materials the problem with delamination is eliminated.Orbital Drilling Goes Mainstream for the Dreamliner, Aerospace Engineering & Manufacturing, SAE International Publications, March 2009, p. 32  Material  = Drilling in metal = High-speed steel twist bit drilling into aluminium with methylated spirits lubricant Under normal usage, swarf is carried up and away from the tip of the drill bit by the fluting of the drill bit. The cutting edges produce more chips which continue the movement of the chips outwards from the hole. This is successful until the chips pack too tightly, either because of deeper than normal holes or insufficient backing off (removing the drill slightly or totally from the hole while drilling). Cutting fluid is sometimes used to ease this problem and to prolong the tool's life by cooling and lubricating the tip and chip flow. Coolant may be introduced via holes through the drill shank, which is common when using a gun drill. When cutting aluminum in particular, cutting fluid helps ensure a smooth and accurate hole while preventing the metal from grabbing the drill bit in the process of drilling the hole. When cutting brass, and other soft metals that can grab the drill bit and causes \\"chatter\\", a face of approx. 1-2 millimeters can be ground on the cutting edge to create an obtuse angle of 91 to 93 degrees. This prevents \\"chatter\\" during which the drill tears rather than cuts the metal. However, with that shape of bit cutting edge, the drill is pushing the metal away, rather than grabbing the metal. This creates high friction and very hot swarf. Magnetic Drilling Machine (manufactured by BDS Maschinen GmbH, Germany) For heavy feeds and comparatively deep holes oil-hole drills are used in the drill bit, with a lubricant pumped to the drill head through a small hole in the bit and flowing out along the fluting. A conventional drill press arrangement can be used in oil-hole drilling, but it is more commonly seen in automatic drilling machinery in which it is the workpiece that rotates rather than the drill bit. In computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools a process called ', or interrupted cut drilling, is used to keep swarf from detrimentally building up when drilling deep holes (approximately when the depth of the hole is three times greater than the drill diameter). Peck drilling involves plunging the drill part way through the workpiece, no more than five times the diameter of the drill, and then retracting it to the surface. This is repeated until the hole is finished. A modified form of this process, called high speed peck drilling or chip breaking, only retracts the drill slightly. This process is faster, but is only used in moderately long holes, otherwise it will overheat the drill bit. It is also used when drilling stringy material to break the chips. When it is not possible to bring the material to the –°N–° machine, a Magnetic Base Drilling Machine may be used. The base allows drilling in a horizontal position and even on a ceiling. Usually, for these machines, it is better to use cutters because they can drill much faster with less speed. Cutter sizes vary from 12mm to 200mm DIA and from 30mm to 200mm DOC(depth of cut). These machines are widely used in construction, fabrication, marine, and oil & gas industries. In the oil and gas industry, pneumatic magnetic drilling machines are used to avoid sparks, as well as special tube magnetic drilling machines that can be fixed on pipes of different sizes, even inside. = Drilling in wood = Wood being softer than most metals, drilling in wood is considerably easier and faster than drilling in metal. Cutting fluids are not used or needed. The main issue in drilling wood is ensuring clean entry and exit holes and preventing burning. Avoiding burning is a question of using sharp bits and the appropriate cutting speed. Drill bits can tear out chips of wood around the top and bottom of the hole and this is undesirable in fine woodworking applications. The ubiquitous twist drill bits used in metalworking also work well in wood, but they tend to chip wood out at the entry and exit of the hole. In some cases, as in holes for rough carpentry, the quality of the hole does not matter, and a number of bits for fast cutting in wood exist, including spade bits and self-feeding auger bits. Many types of specialised drill bits for boring clean holes in wood have been developed, including brad-point bits, Forstner bits and hole saws. Chipping on exit can be minimized by using a piece of wood as backing behind the work piece, and the same technique is sometimes used to keep the hole entry neat. Holes are easier to start in wood as the drill bit can be accurately positioned by pushing it into the wood and creating a dimple. The bit will thus have little tendency to wander. = Others = Some materials like plastics as well as other non-metals and some metals have a tendency to heat up enough to expand making the hole smaller than desired.  Related processes  The following are some related processes that often accompany drilling: ;Counterboring : This process creates a stepped hole in which a larger diameter follows a smaller diameter partially into a hole. ;Countersinking : This process is similar to counterboring but the step in the hole is cone-shaped. ;Boring : Boring precisely enlarges an already existing hole using a single point cutter. ;Friction drilling : drilling holes using plastic deformation of the subject (under heat and pressure) instead of cutting it. ;Reaming : Reaming is designed to enlarge the size of a hole to leave smooth sides. ;Spot facing :This is similar to milling, it is used to provide a flat machine surface on the workpiece in a localized area  See also  *Laser drilling *Drilling rig  References   External links  Category:Machining Category:Woodworking ","title":"Drilling"},{"id":"900871","text":"Dripping Springs may refer to: * Dripping Springs, Carter County, Oklahoma * Dripping Springs, Delaware County, Oklahoma, a census-designated place; renamed as Natural Falls State Park in 1990. * Dripping Springs State Park, in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma * Dripping Springs, Texas * Dripping Springs Campground, in the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area in Utah * Dripping Springs Natural Area, in the Organ Mountains (New Mexico) * Dripping Springs Trail, Grand Canyon, Arizona See also * Dripping liquid * Spring (hydrology) ","title":"Dripping Springs"},{"id":"900873","title":"Catterick Garrison"},{"id":"900878","text":"Druid Hill or Druid Hills can refer to several places in the United States: *Druid Hills, Georgia, a neighborhood and census-designated place (CDP) in DeKalb County, partly in the city of Atlanta and partly unincorporated **Druid Hills High School, in DeKalb County **Druid Hills Road, in DeKalb County *North Druid Hills, Georgia, a census-designated place (CDP) in unincorporated DeKalb County *Druid Hills, Kentucky *Druid Hill Park in Baltimore, Maryland *Druid Hills, a historic neighborhood in Hendersonville, North Carolina ","title":"Druid Hills (disambiguation)"},{"id":"900890","text":"Dudleyville may refer to: *Dudleyville, Alabama, United States *Dudleyville, Arizona, United States *Dudleyville, Illinois, United States *Dudleyville, Michigan, United States ","title":"Dudleyville"},{"id":"900904","text":"Eagan may refer to: ;People * Daisy Eagan (born 1979), American actress * Dennis Eagan (1926‚Äì2012), British field hockey player * Eddie Eagan (1897‚Äì1967), American sportsman * John J.

Among the bands to play at The Casbah was the Beatles, for whom her son Pete Best (b. 24 November 1941) was a drummer at the time. Mona also had two other sons, John Rory (b. 29 January 1945), and Vincent \\"Roag\\" Best (b. 21 July 1962).

Mona died in October 1988, after a heart attack following a long illness.  Early life in India  Best was born on 3 January 1924, in Delhi, British India, to Thomas (an Irish major) and Mary Shaw. She was the youngest of four children: Brian, Patrick and Aileen. When she was 17, her first son, Randolph Peter Scanland (later surnamed Best), was born on 24 November 1941 in Madras.

At the time of their meeting, Best was a commissioned officer serving as a Physical Training Instructor in India, and was the British Army's middleweight boxing champion. After their marriage on 7 March 1944, at St. Thomas's Cathedral, Bombay, the Bests had one child: John Rory Best (b. 29 January 1945).

It had a substantial freight business and interchanged with other interurbans to serve Detroit and Cleveland. Its twenty high-speed \\"Red Devil\\" interurban passenger cars operated daily between Cincinnati and Cleveland via Toledo, the longest same equipment run by an interurban in the United States. The C&LE; failed because of the weak economy and the loss of essential freight interchange partners. It ceased operating in 1939.  History  = Background: The Consolidation = The Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad was legally formed as a corporate entity in January, 1930, by the consolidation of three existing 1929 electric interurban lines: the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton (CH&D;); the Indiana, Columbus and Eastern (IC&E;); and the Lima-Toledo Railroad (LT). The combination of these three companies created an interurban system that operated a south-north line from Cincinnati through Dayton and Springfield to Toledo, and an east bound line from Springfield to Columbus. The Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway was acquired and reorganized in 1926 by Dr. Thomas Conway, Jr., a professor of business at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Believing that he could turn the interurban into a very profitable operation, he made substantial investments in infrastructure and rolling stock, including passenger cars and freight locomotives. He spent $500,000 to purchase the CH&D; and then spent $1.5 million on improvements. The interurban's business and prospects improved as hoped, particularly in the movement of freight. In 1929, it handled of freight in Cincinnati. Conway then contemplated the advantages of extending his railway north to Toledo, Ohio connecting to Detroit where the C&HD; could tap the shipping business of the automotive industry. Thus Conway acquired the Indiana, Columbus and Eastern and the Lima-Toledo as the two teetered at the edge of bankruptcy. These acquisitions gave him the desired access to Toledo. In early January, 1930, the three combined lines were officially incorporated as the Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad. = Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad = Financing and rebuilding Conway had his new Cincinnati and Lake Erie enterprise issue $3.7 million in stock and $3.5 million in bonds and began an extensive 1930 round of infrastructure improvements and equipment purchases. The timing proved unfortunate as this extensive borrowing was added to the already large bond debt of the earlier CH&D;, and it came as the United States entered the Great Depression, which lasted ten years to 1939. The requirement to make the large interest payments on these bonds when added to the railway's normal operating expenses caused the line to operate at a paper loss every year except 1936. When in bankruptcy court mandated \\"Receivership,\\" the C&LE; had the cash to continue to operate due to the suspension of bond payments. } }The C&LE; totaled in length and consisted of three operating divisions. Company offices and the train dispatching center were located in Dayton, Ohio. The Toledo Division ran from Toledo south to Springfield. The Columbus Division ran west alongside U.S. Route 40 and met the Toledo Division at Springfield, Ohio, and turned south to Dayton. The Cincinnati Division ran south from Dayton through Hamilton to Cincinnati. It followed the old towpath of the Miami and Erie Canal for part of its route. The Toledo Division, formerly the Lima-Toledo, ran parallel to the route of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Connecting interurbans were essential At Toledo, the C&LE; interchanged with the Lake Shore Electric Railway (LSE) from Cleveland and the Eastern Michigan Railway from Detroit. At Dayton, it interchanged with the Dayton and Western Traction Company from Indianapolis. All of these neighboring interurban lines provided important freight business for the C&LE;, but all were hurting financially. The Eastern Michigan abandoned operations in 1932 and the C&LE; lost its connection to Detroit. The Dayton and Western was so weak that the C&LE;, in conjunction with the Indianapolis interurban Indiana Railroad, provided the financial support to keep it operating, but it ultimately failed in 1937. The absolutely essential Cleveland connection ended in 1938 when the Lake Shore Electric abandoned after an unwise freight agent strike. The loss of these connections with the related loss of the interchange freight business, particularly that of the LSE, eventually proved fatal to the C&LE.; New rolling stock Part of Conway's effort to rejuvenate the C&LE; involved improving both passenger and freight business. For passenger service, this meant providing new passenger equipment running on faster schedules. To that end, the C&LE; ordered twenty lightweight \\"Red Devil\\" cars from the Cincinnati Car Company and participated in the design. They were lighter due to the use of aluminum and sat lower due to the use of smaller wheels and traction motors. These cars featured Art deco styling and had a distinctive bright red paint scheme. Half of the cars were outfitted as parlor cars with first class seating. To demonstrate the new equipment, the C&LE; staged a race between car #126 and an airplane. The car \\"won\\" after topping out at . The Red Devils operated a daily service between Cincinnati‚ÄìToledo‚ÄìDetroit () and Cincinnati‚ÄìToledo‚ÄìCleveland (). These were the longest straight through operations using the same equipment on any interurban in the United States. New freight motors were purchased along with freight cars designed to operate on city streets with tight turns at corners. Overnight freight delivery C&LE; management turned the numerous and prior legacy regional mid 1920s interurban companies' trolley-freight feeble operations into an efficient, high-speed, freight carrier. With the cooperation of neighboring interurbans in Indiana and northern Ohio, it guaranteed next-morning freight delivery to major cities throughout Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. The C&LE;‚Äôs nightly runs between Cincinnati and Cleveland made it the longest and probably the fastest regional interurban freight carrier in America.Keenan: The Fight for Survival. To improve freight business, the C&LE; guaranteed 5pm 8am overnight 178 mile delivery between Cincinnati to Cleveland, a service that conventional steam railroads could not provide. This enabled the C&LE; to secure considerable new business, notably that of a Frigidaire plant near Dayton which had the C&LE; construct loading tracks directly into their factory. This freight service operating at night had the additional benefit of not interfering with the daytime operation of the new, fast \\"Red Devil\\" passenger interurbans. The C&LE; also established interchange freight rates with some steam railroads, a rarity for an interurban. The expanded freight business created tension with local municipalities who did not want freight motors towing multiple freight cars on city streets mixing with automobiles and pedestrians and damaging pavement. There was substantial street damage in both Springfield and Dayton. Springfield sued the C&LE; for damages to its brick streets and won, but the railroad was unable to pay or repair the damage it was so broke. The C&LE; did not employ protective block signaling on its railway due to the cost of installation. It relied on a system of train orders, and train orders have the danger of a motorman not paying attention to where he is scheduled to meet an opposing train. The C&LE; experienced several head-on wrecks due to this. One in 1932 near Hamilton, and another in 1934 near Springfield, Ohio. There were fatalities. The costs to settle bodily injury and death claims combined with the serious damage to the Red Devils exceeded the cost of installing block signals had this been done in 1930. Abandonment Competition with a growing population of automobiles riding on state paved highways plus the dire financial impact of the Depression led to a decline in C&LE; passenger business. The reasonably good freight business collapsed as the C&LE;'s interchange partners went out of business. The C&LE; ceased operations in 1939. The innovative Red Devils were sold after abandonment: six to the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railway (CRANDIC) and thirteen to the Lehigh Valley Transit Company. They operated satisfactorily for both interurbans into the early 1950s.

Biography  A native of Rochester, New York, Joe English was a member of band Jam Factory, a group based in Syracuse, that evolved into the Tall Dogs Orchestra of Macon, Georgia. Searching for an opportunity to expand his talent, he answered an ad for a drummer in early 1975. The address led him to the basement of an old building where, much to his surprise, he found himself face to face with Paul McCartney. The audition was for McCartney's Wings, and English got the job. His first album with Wings was Venus and Mars and, one album later, he would even take the lead vocals for the song, \\"Must Do Something About It\\" from Wings at the Speed of Sound. He accompanied Wings on tour and was the drummer on the Wings Over the World tour. In September 1977, during the recording sessions for Wings' London Town, English became homesick and returned to Macon, Georgia, where he began playing with Chuck Leavell's band Sea Level. This ended his time with McCartney and Wings. Following his Christian salvation experience, he formed the Joe English Band, performing as lead singer and drummer. The band toured the world, playing with other major Christian bands of the era, including Petra, DeGarmo & Key, Mylon LeFevre and Servant. The Joe English Band recorded a release without Joe's vocals called AKA Forerunner. The band included John Lawry, who left to play for Petra in 1984. In 1986, Joe English played in former Petra vocalist Greg X. Volz's band, Pieces of Eight. In the late 1980s, English joined Randy Stonehill, Phil Keaggy, Rick Cua and others as part of the Compassion All Star Band. In 1988, the band recorded live One by One, their only album together. English played the snare with his right hand and the hi-hat and ride cymbals with his left, a technique commonly termed \\"open handed\\". He has been unable to play drums professionally since the late 1990s, due to chronic ankle health issues.

It is located in the campus Artem, in the city of Nancy, Eastern France (only 1h30 from Paris by TGV), and is part of the University of Lorraine. Around 400 students are taught general science and management and 300 follow specialised Master programs. These students are taught by 60 permanent professors. There are also 400 researchers including a hundred PhD students. Despite its small size, it is well represented in the French industry. Most of its alumni hold executive positions in the industry and large corporations or scientific research positions in France or abroad. It was created in 1919 on the request of the University of Nancy in order to contribute to the reconstruction of the mining and steel industry in the east of France after World War I. At the end of the 1950s, under the impulse of its then-director Bertrand Schwartz (younger brother of Laurent Schwartz), the school reorganized its curriculum to include a balanced blend of engineering, management and social sciences. At the time, it was an innovative educational model for engineers, that was later extended to other Grandes Ecoles. The Ing√©nieur civil des Mines degree =Description= The school was initially aimed at training mining engineers. In 1957, its director Bertrand Schwartz began its transformation into a modern \\"generalist\\" school. The school focuses on training innovative managers for the industry and researchers, with a broad generalist and high scientific knowledge, able to communicate in different languages. The Ing√©nieurs civils des Mines degree (Master of Science and Executive Engineering) is ranked among the best French Grande Ecole degrees. 20% of the students are international students, mainly from Morocco, Tunisia and China. In addition to the general science (advanced mathematics and physics) and management classes, the students have to specialise (one third of their classes) from their second year to the third (and last) year: * \\"D√©partement Mat√©riaux\\" (materials and mechanics) * \\"D√©partement √ânergie\\" (energetics and environment) * \\"D√©partement G√©nie Industriel\\" (applied mathematics and industrial engineering) * \\"D√©partement Information et Syst√®mes\\" (computer science) * \\"D√©partement G√©oing√©nierie\\" (geosciences and civil engineering). The students must learn English and at least another language. =Internships= The students have to do at least three internships in order to get the degree. *Operator internship (6 weeks), whose aim is to discover the reality of work, become aware of the repetitive nature or physical difficulties of the tasks and understand human relations within a company. *Assistant-engineer internship (at least 10 weeks). *Engineer internship (at least 20 weeks, usually around 6 months), the end-of-course thesis has to be research oriented. The engineer internship is usually an opportunity for the companies to hire the students. =Admission= For students having studied in the Classe Pr√©paratoire aux Grandes Ecoles (a two-year highly selective undergraduate program in Mathematics, Physics), admission to the Ing√©nieur Civil des Mines degree is decided through a nationwide competitive examination ( Concours Commun Mines-Ponts) and their origin can vary: MP, PC, PSI..., with a number of places for each which was, in 2015: * MP: 54 * PC: 32 * PSI: 40 * PT: 4 * TSI: 3 * CCP (concours commun polytechniques): 5 * AST: 5 It is also possible for student to be accepted for specialised master's or an exchange programs, in particular through partnerships with other schools or universities around the world. The Ing√©nieur degree in Industrial Engineering and Materials =Description= Industrial Engineering and Materials Postgraduate programme [Ing√©nieur de sp√©cialit√© G√©nie Industriel et Mat√©riaux] was born in 1991 by a common initiative of Mines Nancy and the three historical partners: Renault, Saint- Gobain and ArcelorMittal. Since then, it has maintained privileged links with the industry. The curriculum of the Engineer programme specializing in Industrial Engineering and Materials is designed to provide students with high skills in two complementary fields: materials and Industrial engineering. The engineers trained have both a high technical level and great managerial skills. For this purpose, the majority of the courses in the three years are devoted to two specialties: ‚Ä¢Materials Science and Engineering ‚Ä¢Industrial Engineering In 2016, 74% of graduates found a job before graduation and 100% of graduates were hired within 4 months of graduation. 50% of graduates work in the automotive, aeronautics, naval, railway and metallurgy sectors as production manager, supply chain manager, logistic manager, quality manager... At the same time, some graduates have chosen to pursue research in materials science. At the end of this postgraduate programme, they receive the Ing√©nieur degree in Industrial Engineering and Materials [Ing√©nieur de sp√©cialit√© G√©nie Industriel et Mat√©riaux], a French Grande Ecole degree (Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur) validated by la Commission des Titres d‚ÄôIng√©nieur (CTI). =Internships= ‚Ä¢Technician internship in the first year(5 months). ‚Ä¢Assistant engineer internship in the second year(5 months). ‚Ä¢Engineer internship in the final year(6 months). =Admission= This engineering postgraduate programme recruits the students from Classe Pr√©paratoire aux Grandes EcolesÔºàPT, TSI, ATS, CCP) and outstanding students from French public universities (IUT, BTS, LP). Only about 30 students are admitted each year, including about five international students from partner universities. The Ing√©nieur degree in Mechanical Engineering This engineering programme was born in 2001. If students accomplish the 3-year engineering curriculum, they receive the Ing√©nieur degree in Mechanical Engineering, a title validated by la Commission des Titres d‚ÄôIng√©nieur (CTI).

The test was named after F. R. G. Heaf. Also known as the Sterneedle test, it was administered by a Heaf gun (trademarked \\"Sterneedle\\"), a spring-loaded instrument with six needles arranged in a circular formation which was inserted in the wrist. The Heaf test was discontinued in 2005 because the manufacturer deemed its production to be financially unsustainable after manufacturers could not be found for tuberculin or Heaf guns. Until 2005, the test was used in the United Kingdom to determine if the BCG vaccine was needed; the Mantoux test is now used instead. The Heaf test was preferred in the UK, because it was thought to be easier to interpret, with less variability between observers, and less training was required to administer and read the test. Patients who exhibited a negative reaction to the test were considered for BCG vaccination. The Heaf test was used to test for tuberculosis in adolescents aged around 13-14. __TOC__ Procedure A Heaf gun was used to inject multiple samples of testing serum under the skin at once. The needle points were dipped in tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) and pricked into the skin. A Heaf gun with disposable single-use heads was recommended. The gun injected PPD equivalent to 100,000 units per ml to the skin over the flexor surface of the left forearm in a circular pattern of six. The test was read between two and seven days later. The injection could not be into sites containing superficial veins. The reading of the Heaf test was defined by a scale: *Negative - No induration, maybe six minute puncture scars *Grade 1 - four to six papules (also considered negative) *Grade 2 - Confluent papules form indurated ring (positive) *Grade 3 - Central filling to form disc (positive) *Grade 4 - Disc >10 mm with or without blistering (strongly positive) Grades 1 and 2 could result from previous BCG or avian tuberculosis, rather than human TB infection. Children who were found to have a grade 3 or 4 reaction were referred for X-ray and follow-up. For interpretation of the test, see Tuberculosis diagnosis. Other tests The equivalent Mantoux test positive levels done with 10 TU (0.1 mL 100 TU/mL, 1:1000) are *0‚Äì4 mm induration (Heaf 0-1) *5‚Äì14 mm induration (Heaf 2) *>15 mm induration (Heaf 3-4) The Mantoux test is preferred in the United States for the diagnosis of tuberculosis; multiple puncture tests, such as the Heaf test and Tine test, are not recommended.

Canal boats from Portland harbor reached Long Lake through the Cumberland and Oxford Canal, completed in 1832. The canal's Songo Lock facilities still control Long Lake water level. Each November, Long Lake is drained by about 3 feet so that melting snow does not cause a flood in the spring. The lake is the site of many summer camps, including Camp Newfound, Camp Owatonna, Camp Takajo, and Camp Wildwood (actually located on nearby Wood's Pond). The famous author, E.B. White, owned a vacation house on Long Lake in the North Bridgton section. Long Lake is the home of fictional character David Drayton in Stephen King's 1980 novella, The Mist, which was made into a 2007 movie, The Mist. Long Lake is the story's opening setting, as well as origin of the mysterious mist. Long Lake is home to many species of wildlife, which given the growing use of the lake for recreational purposes must be respected. Most notably, loons which can be heard at night and whose song is sought by so many visitors. Loon nests can be seen on the shoreline but must never be disturbed. Visitors to the lake should be cautious around these nests and should avoid any disturbance, including noise. Boaters should also take extra caution to be watchful of loons on the lake and avoid creating large wakes close by. Boaters should also inspect their crafts before entering the lake for millfoil, a growing problem in New England lakes. While the official max depth is listed as 59 feet, there is a spring near Half Loon Bay, a small bay near Bridgton Academy, that registers as being 216 feet deep, according to depth finders on multiple boats.

The lake is deep at its deepest point, with a mean depth of , covers about in surface area, has a length of and has a shoreline length of roughly . The surface is around above sea level, so the deep bottom is below the present sea level. It is in Cumberland County, and bordered by the towns of Casco, Naples, Raymond, Sebago, Standish and Windham. The seasonally occupied town of Frye Island is on an island in the lake. Sebago Lake and the surrounding area is known for its erratic and sudden changes in weather during all seasons, likely due to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and to Mt. Washington, a very notorious extreme weather hotspot. Sebago means \\"big still water\\" in Abenaki.John C. Huden, Indian Place Names of New England (New York: Museum of the American Indian, 1962), 223. Transportation The lake is connected to Brandy Pond by the Songo River and eventually to Long Lake in Naples. The name comes from a local Native American tribe. The lake is drained primarily by the Presumpscot River. The lake and rivers were an early transportation corridor from the coast to the interior, and encouraged the first incorporated European settlement of interior Maine in 1762. Sebago Lake was linked to Portland harbor by the Cumberland and Oxford Canal in 1832. The outlet to the Presumpscot River was controlled for the canal by the Eel Weir Dam and the Head Dam, owned and operated by the Oriental Powder Company after the canal was replaced by a railroad and by the S. D. Warren Paper Mill after 1878. The lake was a comparatively safe place for training military pilots from NAS Brunswick about flying over water; but several navy planes were lost over the lake during World War II. A Grumman TBF Avenger from the Lewiston Naval Auxiliary Air Facility ditched and sank near Raymond on 16 August 1943. Two low-flying British Vought Corsairs from Brunswick were lost after a mid-air collision over the lake near Raymond on 16 May 1944; and a third Corsair flew into the lake on July 16. In December 2014 the first Sebago Lake beach landing in the history of the world was made by a yellow Supercub. Water supply Sebago Lake is the primary water supply for the Portland Water District, which serves the Greater Portland region and about 20% of Maine's population. The lake's watershed is more than long and covers parts of 24 Maine towns. The lake holds roughly of water that on average resides 5.1 to 5.4 years in the lake. The direct watershed is about of land plus the of the lake, and the indirect watershed about of land plus about of other bodies of water. As of May 1990, roughly 86% of the watershed was forests and fallow fields, 2.5% in active timber operations, 9.3% in residential, agricultural, and commercial use, and 2.2% used for other purposes. Water inflow is estimated at per day and outflow at per day, of which /day are for the water district. Recreation In 1938, Maine opened Sebago Lake State Park as one of its original five state parks. The area was a recreation center even before this. The park is now (mostly forested), open year-round, and has facilities including two public boat launches and a 250-site campground. There are also numerous private campgrounds (like Point Sebago in Casco which is ), cottages, and other recreational facilities in the area. Although the lake has many Public access sites, it is becoming increasingly difficult to access the lake by land or water for recreation due to new private developments taking over much of its shoreline. As a result, a vast majority of the lake's shoreline is private property or is otherwise off-limits to land-based recreation. Sebago Lake hosts a sailing instruction and charter service and is located in what Maine's tourism industry refers to as the Western Lakes and Mountains Region. Efforts are underway to complete the Sebago to the Sea Trail, a trail running 28 miles from Sebago Lake to Casco Bay, mostly following the path of the Presumpscot River. =Fishing= The lake is the likely point of origin of the landlocked salmon, stated in the species' scientific name (Salmo salar sebago). At one point, the entire watershed was under seawater, and the first populations of these marine animals became established as the land rose and seawaters retreated. Other game fish that can be found in the lake include lake trout, brook trout, brown trout, largemouth bass,(particularly on the lake's West Side) and northern pike. Some of these are stocked by the state, either in the lake directly or in connected bodies of water, while others were introduced illegally. The state encourages anglers to kill, hold, and notify them of all northern pike taken in the lake because they were introduced illegally, are not native to the region, and could disrupt the lake ecosystem, including that of Sebago Lake's original fish species, such as the landlocked salmon. Camp Center Day Camp, a day camp run by the Jewish Community Alliance of Southern Maine, is located on the shores of Sebago Lake. Camp O-At-Ka, founded in 1906, is located along a half mile of waterfront in the northwest corner of Sebago Lake. Camp Sebago, a camp run by The Salvation Army is located on the southwestern corner of Sebago Lake. Camp Wohelo, the original Camp Fire Girls camp (WOrk HEalth LOve) was established on Sebago Lake in 1907. Founded by Luther Halsey Gulick and Charlotte Vetter Gulick, known by their native American names of Timanous and Hiitini, the camp strove to teach independence and back woods skills to young girls aged 6‚Äì16. Wohelo is still strong today.

She invented The Landlord's Game, the precursor to Monopoly, to illustrate teachings of the progressive era economist Henry George.  Life and Occupations  Elizabeth J. Magie was born in Macomb, Illinois, in 1866 to James K. Magie, a newspaper publisher and an abolitionist who accompanied Abraham Lincoln as he traveled around Illinois in the late 1850s debating politics with Stephen Douglas. After moving to the D.C. and Maryland area in the early 1880s, she worked as a stenographer. She was also a short story and poetry writer, comedian, stage actress, feminist, and engineer. At the age of 26, Magie received a patent for her invention that made the typewriting process easier by allowing paper to go through the rollers more easily. At the time, women were credited with less than one percent of all patents. She also worked as a news reporter for a brief time in the early 1900s. In 1910, at age 44, she married Albert Wallace Phillips.  Political Activism  Elizabeth Magie was an outspoken activist for the feminist movement, and Georgism, which reflected her father's political beliefs when she was young. Georgism refers the economic perspective that instead of taxing income or other sources, the government should create a universal land tax based on the usefulness, size, and location of the land. Then, after funding the government, the left over money would be distributed to the people. Many progressive political leaders at the time supported this economic perspective as it motivated people to cultivate land, redistributed wealth to people of low socioeconomic standing, eradicated the idea that landowners or landlords held the power and monetary value of the land that citizens used, and let people own all of the value and benefits of their creations. This belief became the basis for her game known as The Landlord's Game. Furthermore, She believed that women were equally as capable as men in inventing, business, and other professional areas. In the 1800s, this belief was considered both novel and radical. When she worked as a stenographer, she was making around $10 which was not enough to support herself without the help of a husband. In order to bring the struggles of women in the United States to the public's attention, she bought an advertisement and tried to auction herself off as a \\"young woman American slave\\" looking for a husband to own her. This advertisement was meant to show the position of women and Black people in the country, emphasizing the fact that the only people that were truly free were white men. The ad Magie published became the talk of the town. It spread rapidly through the news and gossip columns around the country. Magie made a name for herself as an out-spoken and proud feminist.  The Landlord's Game  Magie first made her game, known as The Landlord's Game, popular among friends while living in Brentwood, Maryland. In 1903, Magie applied to the US Patent Office for a patent on her board game. She was granted U.S. Patent 748,626 on January 5, 1904. The Landlord's Game board, created in 1906. The Landlord's Game was designed to demonstrate the economic ill effects of land monopolism and the use of land value tax as a remedy for it. Originally, the goal of the game was to simply obtain wealth. In the following patents, the game developed to eventually have two different settings: one being the monopolist set up (known as Monopoly) where the goal was to own industries, create monopolies, and win by forcing others out of their industries and the other being the anti-monopolist setup (known as Prosperity) where the goal was to create products and interact with opponents. In 1906, she moved to Chicago. That year, she and fellow Georgists formed the Economic Game Co. to self-publish her original edition of The Landlord's Game. In 1910, the Parker Brothers published her humorous card game Mock Trial. Then, the Newbie Game Co. in Scotland patented The Landlord's Game as \\"Bre'r Fox and Bre'r Rabbit;\\" however, there was no proof that the game was actually protected by the British patent. She and her husband moved back to the east coast of the U.S. and patented a revised version of the game in 1924. As her original patent had expired in 1921, this is seen as her attempt to reassert control over her game, which was now being played at some colleges where students made their own copies. In 1932, her second edition of The Landlord's Game was published by the Adgame Company of Washington, D.C. This version included both Monopoly and Prosperity. Lizzie Magie also developed other games including Bargain Day and King's Men in 1937 and a third version of The Landlord's Game in 1939. In Bargain Day, shoppers compete with each other in a department store; King's Men is an abstract strategy game.  Death  Lizzie Magie died at the age of 81 in 1948. Her husband, Albert Wallace, was buried with her in Arlington, Virginia. At her death, she was not credited for the impact that she had on the board game community and American culture. Monopoly, the Game The Monopoly board game, which Lizzie Magie claimed was similar to her patent, The Landlord's Game. Lizzie Magie's game was becoming increasingly popular around the Northeastern United States. College students attending Harvard, Columbia, and University of Pennsylvania, left-leaning middle class families, and Quakers were all playing her board game. Three decades after The Landlord's Game was invented in 1904, Parker Brothers published a modified version, known as Monopoly. Charles Darrow claimed the idea as his own, stating that he invented the game in his basement. Magie spoke out against them and reported that she had made a mere $500 from her invention and received none of the credit for Monopoly. In January 1936, an interview with Magie appeared in a Washington, D.C. newspaper, in which she was critical of Parker Brothers. Magie spoke to reporters about the similarities between Monopoly, and The Landlord's Game. The article published spoke to the fact that Magie spent more money making her game than she received in earnings, especially with the lack of credit she received after Monopoly was created. After the interviews, Parker Brothers agreed to publish two more of her games but continued to give Charles Darrow the credit for inventing the game itself. Charles Darrow was known as the inventor of Monopoly until Ralph Anspach discovered Magie's patents and her relation to the Monopoly game while fighting a legal battle with the Parker Brothers because of his Anti-Monopoly game. Subsequently, her invention of The Landlord's Game has been given more attention and research. Despite the fact that Charles Darrow and the Parker Brothers capitalized on and were credited with her idea, she posthumously received credit for one of the most popular board games to ever hit the market.  Legacy  After her death, Lizzie Magie impacted many aspects of American culture and life. First and foremost, she helped to popularize the circular board game. Most board games at the time were linear; a circular board game that concentrated on interacting both socially and competitively with the opponents was a novel idea. Her board game not only laid the foundation and inspiration for Monopoly, the most perennially famous game in the United States, but also provided entertainment that taught about Georgist principles, the value in spreading wealth, and the harmfulness of monopolies (this tenet of her game was lost in the Charles Darrow version of Monopoly). She also left lasting affects fighting for women's rights and abolition, whether it be through educating others about these concepts, inventing board games at a time when women held less than one percent of the patents, or publishing political material in newspapers to speak out against the oppression of women and Black communities in the United States.

Since then, the Museum has grown to include a Mayflower II replica (1957), the English Village (1959), the Wampanoag Homesite (1973), the Hornblower Visitor Center (1987), the Craft Center (1992), the Maxwell and Nye Barns (1994), and the Plimoth Grist Mill (2013).http://www.plimoth.org/about-us Alongside the settlement is a re- creation of a Wampanoag home site, where modern Native Americans from a variety of tribes explain and demonstrate how the Wampanoag's ancestors lived and interacted with the settlers (not in period character, but in traditional dress). Mayflower II The museum grounds at Plimoth Plantation also include Nye Barn, where historical breeds of livestock are kept, a crafts center where many objects are created for use in the village exhibits, a cinema where educational videos are shown, a Colonial Education site for youth and adult groups, and visitors' center with indoor exhibits and educational programs. The two houses on the Colonial Education site were built by Plimoth Plantation for the PBS show Colonial House filmed in Maine.

In 2002, Kalnoky gathered a large number of musicians‚Äîincluding Ansley and Egan, several members of One Cool Guy, his brother Achilles, and several of Achilles' orchestra friends‚Äîto perform on the Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution EP, A Call to Arms. Included on the five track independently released CD is \\"Here's to Life\\", a song which Streetlight Manifesto reworked and included on Everything Goes Numb, and a new version of Catch 22's \\"Dear Sergio\\", which included a new verse. Both Streetlight and the Bandits are members of The RISC Group, a collaboration of artists to self produce and retain rights to their music. = Everything Goes Numb (2003-2004) = Streetlight Manifesto's first recording consisted of a four-track demo EP, featuring the songs \\"Everything Went Numb\\", \\"Point/Counterpoint\\", \\"The Saddest Song\\" and \\"We Are the Few\\", all of which were re-recorded for their debut album. The line-up that recorded the demo consisted almost entirely of musicians from Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution: Josh Ansley (bass guitar), Jamie Egan (trombone and trumpet), Tomas Kalnoky (guitar and vocals), Stuart Karmatz (drums), Dan Ross (alto and baritone saxophone) and Pete Sibilia (tenor saxophone). The band was signed to Victory Records, the same label as Catch 22. After the demo was recorded Karmatz left and was replaced by Paul Lowndes and Jim Conti took the place of Pete Sibilia. This line-up then recorded Everything Goes Numb, but changed again before the band could perform any live shows, Jamie Egan played both trumpet and trombone, but as he would not be able to do this live Mike Soprano joined on trombone. Paul Lowndes had no intention to tour and was replaced by Chris Thatcher. = More lineup changes and continued touring (2004-2007) = In September 2004, Ansley announced his departure to pursue an acting career. The next departure was Egan, who left on January 22, 2005, before Streetlight Manifesto began the Ska Is Dead 2 tour, headlining alongside MU330 and the Voodoo Glow Skulls. Delano Bonner came in to play trumpet starting on January 25, 2005, performing at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. Dan Ross had planned to leave after the Ska Is Dead 2 tour to pursue a business career, and was forced to leave early just before the end of the tour due to a family crisis. He has been replaced by Mike Brown, whose first concert was at the start of the European tour. Brown's first concert in the United States was on May 31, 2005 in Baltimore. In April 2005, the band headed overseas to Europe for their first tour outside North America despite personnel difficulties, including visa trouble for various members. Then in October 2005, in Jacksonville, Florida, the band's van was broken into; in total around $80,000 worth of instruments, merchandise, and personal belongings were stolen. Following the burglary and theft, the band was forced to cancel their following four shows. In November 2005, they were robbed again, in Paris, France, and the band lost \\"the one expensive piece of equipment that wasn't stolen in last month's debacle, a 24 track hard drive recorder we've been using to document our live shows.\\" Sometime between December 3, 2006 and July 3, 2007, Delano Bonner left the band. Sometime before the recording of Somewhere in the Between, Matt Stewart took over for Bonner. = Somewhere in the Between (2007-2010) = Streetlight Manifesto's second album, Somewhere in the Between, was released in November 2007 through Victory Records to generally positive reviews. = 99 Songs of Revolution (2010-2012) = 99 Songs of Revolution is a collaborative project that consists of two full- length CDs by Streetlight Manifesto, two full-length CDs by the Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution; as well as four other albums, two each by two other Streetlight-related artists. The project consists entirely of cover songs. Volume No. 1 of the project was released by Streetlight Manifesto on March 16, 2010. = The Hands That Thieve (2012-2013) = On August 22, 2012, the band announced that their new album would be called The Hands That Thieve. It was originally set to be released on November 6, 2012. On October 23, however, Tomas addressed the fans of their Facebook page, apologizing that he would need to set the release date back to sometime in January 2013. On February 1st 2013 at 6pm CST, Victory Records was slated to issue the release date, but did not follow through on the given date. On February 15, it was announced by Victory Records that the album would be released on April 30, 2013. An acoustic version of the album was released by Toh Kay on the same date with the name The Hand That Thieves. The album was leaked on April 19, 2013. The album has received positive reviews. =The End of the Beginning and Victory Records dispute (2013-2017)= 195x195px In February 2013, Victory Records allegedly withheld all copies of The Hands That Thieve from both Streetlight Manifesto and those that had pre-ordered the album through Streetlight's web store, and barred Streetlight Manifesto from releasing the Toh Kay album. The album was available via Victory Records' website, along with all the major physical retailers. The band called for a boycott of all merchandise and music purchased from Victory Records, be it through online sources such as Amazon.com or through traditional methods of buying physical CDs. They instructed their fans and customers to instead buy merchandise from their website, such as shirts and stickers. Despite the fact that Streetlight allegedly had no physical copies they had been continuously taking pre-orders for the album, which culminated in the band asking customers not to ask for a refund and rather accept an unspecified gift sent instead of the actual album. On May 16 it has been announced the mystery gift to be a blank CD-R with a digipack case and 24 page booklet. On March 1, 2013, Streetlight announced plans to dramatically cut down on touring within the next year: They continued by announcing their End of the Beginning Tour, a multiple-leg outing that will last until the end of the year. On May 16, 2014, the band announced its only tour for the year, the Once More Into the Fray Tour, a six-show tour of the North American North East, with support from Dan Potthast and Chris Murray. On October 20, 2015, after years of poor relations between Streetlight Manifesto and Victory Records, media outlets reported of a $1,000,000 lawsuit filed against Kalnoky. The lawsuit was filed in regard to the band not fulfilling their record deal of four studio albums to be released under Victory Records. The band released five albums under Victory Records however, Victory claims that \\"... the band agreed not to count this album as one of the four albums under its contract to receive a $10,000 emergency advance.\\" Victory also claims that the album 99 Songs of Revolution: Vol. 1 does not count towards the contract due to it being a covers album. The lawsuit claims the $1,000,000 is to be paid for Streetlight not fulfilling their four-album record deal, as well as damages for copyright infringement relating to the release of their last album The Hands That Thieve in which Kalnoky released an acoustic version of the album under his pseudonym Toh Kay titled \\"The Hand That Thieves\\". Kalnoky took to the band's Twitter account to comment on the removal of the Victory catalog from streaming service Spotify: > \\"Ironically, @victoryrecords hasn't paid us a cent in royalties in over 2 > yrs. More info soon. #irony #douchenuggets\\" The band have recently been publishing over various social media outlets, showing their disdain towards Tony Brummel and his label. On October 23 the band uploaded the following statement to their social media: > \\"THE REPORTS ARE SIMPLY NOT TRUE. Tony Brummel / Victory Records are NOT > suing Tomas for $1 Million‚Ä¶ ...He's actually suing Tomas for FIVE MILLION > DOLLARS.\\" During the second leg of The Last Good Fight tour, it was revealed that Dan Ross had returned to the band, now playing alto and tenor saxophone. It was also revealed that Nadav Nirenberg had parted ways with the band and been replaced by Karl Lyden. On April 19, 2017, Streetlight Manifesto and Victory Records issued a joint statement that the two parties had reached a settlement under which the band left the record label, and the record label sold the band all master recordings for an undisclosed sum.  Musical influences and style  Kalnoky writes the band's songs on an acoustic guitar and then fleshes out the song structure on the computer and hums basic hornlines, after which the rest of the band comes in and adds their parts. He has cited the soundtrack of the film Stand By Me as his biggest musical influence, and stated that he looks to the 1950s and 1960s for inspiration when writing. For Somewhere in the Between he sought to \\"branch out in different directions\\", adding \\"eastern European and gypsy sounds\\" to give the album \\"a world influence\\"..

Situated on a spur of the Vindhya Range and above sea-level. The city is around northeast of state capital, Bhopal. Sagar has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under PM Narendra Modi's flagship Smart Cities Mission and listed top safest city of India 2018. The Sagar University was founded on 18 July 1946, and was renamed to Dr. Hari Singh Gour University in February 1983. Etymology The original name 'Saugor' (Hindi: ‡§∏‡•å‡§ó‡§¢‡§º) is an amalgamation of two words: sau meaning Hundred (100) and garh meaning forts; there were countless small-forts in this region. With time the name changed from Saugor to Sagar. History The ancient Indian kingdom of Chedi had its capital at Suktimati, which is located in Sagar in contemporary times. The history of Sagar District before 1022 A.D. is generally unknown; after that, records are available. Sagar was under the rule of Ahir Rajas and their capital was at Garhpehra. In 1660, Udenshah, founded the present town of Sagar. After 1735, the city came under the rule of the Peshwas. In 1818, a large part of the Sagar district was ceded by Peshwa Baji Rao II to the British East India Company. Administratively, the position of Sagar and the neighbouring territories underwent frequent changes. The Saugor territory was first placed under the superintendent of Political Affairs of Bundelkhand. Later, in 1820, this area, called the 'Saugor and Nerbudda Territories,' was placed under the administration of an agent to the governor general. The region fell under the North-Western Provinces following its constitution in 1835. In 1842 occurred the Bundela rising, the quelling of which demanded a more direct attention by the Governor-General. But order was restored in the following year, and the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories were again placed under the political control of an Agent to the Governor-General. The arrangement however, was not found to be satisfactory and these territories were once again restored to the North-Western Provinces in 1853. Thereafter in 1861 the Saugor and Nerbudda territories, along with the Nagpur state formed a Commissioner's Province called Central Provinces. Climate Sagar has humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cwa) with hot summers, a somewhat cooler monsoon season and cool winters. Very heavy rain falls in the monsoon season from June to September. Demographics As of the 2011 India census, Sagar had a population of 2,378,458 of which male and female were 1,256,257 and 1,122,201 respectively. In the 2001 census, Sagar had a population of 2,021,987 of which males were 1,073,205 and remaining 948,782 were females. Average literacy rates of Sagar in 2011 were 76.46 compared to 67.73 of 2001. Gender-wise, male and female literacy rates were 84.85 and 67.02 respectively in 2011. For the 2001 census, the rates stood at 79.41 and 54.35 in Sagar District. The total number of literates in Sagar District were 1,545,719 of which male and female were 908,607 and 637,112 respectively. In 2001, Sagar District had 1,118,993 literates in its district.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox (1980‚Äì1990), Houston Astros (1990‚Äì1991), and St. Louis Cardinals (1991‚Äì1992). He currently serves as hitting coach with the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox of the International League. Listed at and , he batted left- handed and threw right-handed. Baseball career = Amateur and minor leagues = A native of Worcester, Massachusetts, Gedman played first base and pitched at Saint Peter-Marian High School and for the Grafton Hill (Worcester) American Legion Baseball program. He went undrafted in the 1977 Major League Baseball Draft, and was signed as a free agent by the Red Sox. He was sent to the Instructional League to learn to play catcher, and progressed steadily up through the Red Sox minor leagues system. Highlights of his minor league career included catching the first nine innings of the longest game in the history of professional baseball, a 33 inning affair between Gedman's Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings. = Major leagues = Gedman made his debut for the Sox at the age of 20 in September 1980, pinch-hitting for Carl Yastrzemski. In 1981, regular Sox catcher Carlton Fisk was granted free-agency and signed with the Chicago White Sox, leaving the catcher position open. Gedman shared catching duties with Gary Allenson, and played well enough to be named The Sporting News Rookie of the Year. Following a poor 1982, Gedman's hitting improved the next two seasons under the instruction of Red Sox hitting coach Walt Hriniak. He hit a career high 24 home runs in 1984 and followed with career highs in batting average (.295) and RBI (80) in 1985 while throwing out nearly half of potential base stealers. In that season, he became the 16th Red Sox player and only the sixth catcher since 1900 to hit for the cycle. In 1986, Gedman experienced three of the highlights of his career. Gedman was the battery-mate for Red Sox pitcher Roger Clemens on April 29 when Clemens struck out 20 batters in a game against the Seattle Mariners to set the major league single-game strikeout record in a nine-inning game. Gedman's 20 putouts during the game set the American League record for putouts by a catcher. On April 30, he had 16 putouts for a total of 36 in two days, which is the most for a catcher in two consecutive games. Gedman was also selected to the All-Star Game that year, to go with his appearance in the 1985 game. But the peak of his career coincided with one of its lows in the 1986 World Series. In the bottom of the tenth inning of Game 6, with the Sox leading by one run with two outs, Kevin Mitchell on third and Mookie Wilson at bat, reliever Bob Stanley threw a pitch that Gedman failed to handle. It was scored as a wild pitch, but many considered it a Gedman passed ball. Mitchell came in to score, tying the game. Then, Wilson hit a ball that went through first baseman Bill Buckner's legs to win the game for the Mets. The Sox went on to lose the deciding game, and the series. On January 8, 1987, ten free agents (Gedman, Tim Raines, Lance Parrish, Bob Horner, Andre Dawson, Ron Guidry, Bob Boone, Doyle Alexander, Toby Harrah and Gary Roenicke) failed to meet a midnight deadline and thus were not allowed to re-sign with their former clubs until May 1 if they were not offered contracts by new teams. The general lack of interest in the players became the focus of a Players Association anti-collusion lawsuit against the owners. On November 3, 1986, while practicing for a seven-game series between Major League and Japanese All-Stars, Gedman was struck by a warmup pitch from Detroit Tigers pitcher Willie Hern√°ndez, resulting in a fractured cheekbone. This was the beginning of a litany of injuries, holdouts, and inconsistency which contributed to the waning of Gedman's skills, both offensive and defensive. In 1989, Rick Cerone replaced him as the regular Boston catcher. In 1990, he served as back-up catcher to Tony Pe√±a, who was acquired by the Red Sox during the offseason. On June 7, Gedman was traded to Houston for a player to be named later. Gedman was not re-signed by the Astros, and in 1991 he signed with the Cardinals to back up Tom Pagnozzi. After spending spring training of 1993 with the Oakland Athletics, Gedman signed a minor-league contract with the Yankees, playing the season with their Triple-A club, the Columbus Clippers. When he failed to make a major league roster in 1994, he retired at age 34. During his career, Gedman batted .252 with 88 home runs, 382 RBI, 331 runs, 176 doubles, 12 triples, and three stolen bases in 1033 games. As a catcher, he compiled a .984 fielding percentage with 5274 putouts, 431 assists and 92 errors in 980 games. = Coaching = In 2002, Gedman became a coach with the North Shore Spirit, a team in the independent Northeast League. He was also the Spirit's bench coach. He then managed the Worcester Tornadoes, in the Can-Am League, from 2005 through 2010. The Tornadoes won the Can-Am League title in their first year of existence. In his six years in Worcester, Gedman led the team to a 283‚Äì290 record, 10‚Äì6 in the postseason. On January 10, 2011, Gedman returned to organized baseball when he was named hitting coach for the Lowell Spinners, the Red Sox' Short Season-A affiliate in the New York‚ÄìPenn League, returning to the Boston organization after a two-decade absence. In 2012, Gedman was promoted to Class A Salem, and switched to Double A Portland Sea Dogs in 2013. In 2015, he was named hitting coach of the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox, a position he still holds as of the 2019 season.MLB.com, Red Sox Set Minor League, Player Development Staff. (10 January 2019) = Highlights = * Twice named an All- Star (1985‚Äì86) * The Sporting News' AL Rookie of the Year (1981) * Selected for the All-Star team by UPI and The Sporting News (1985) * Caught Dennis Eckersley's one-hitter (September 26, 1980) * Set two AL records for putouts in a game [20] and in consecutive games [36] (April 29‚Äì30, 1986) * Hit for the cycle and drove in seven runs against the Blue Jays (September 18, 1985) * Reached base in all five at-bats of historic game 5 of the 1986 American League Championship Series. This included a two-run home run in the second inning and a hit by pitch in the ninth inning that set up Dave Henderson's dramatic two-out home run.  Personal life  Rich Gedman met his future-wife Sherry Aselton in 1977, when both attended St. Peter-Marian High School in Worcester. Sherry went on to play softball and basketball at the University of Connecticut where she threw two no-hitters and as of 2011 still holds the second-lowest career ERA in program history (0.57). The couple married in 1982. The Gedmans have two sons, Michael and Matthew, and a daughter, Marissa. Michael was a freshman pitcher for the Le Moyne College Dolphins in 2007, but when his younger brother Matthew was accepted as a freshman at UMass in both their baseball and hockey programs (as an infielder and a goalie), sophomore Michael transferred to UMass also. Mike played a mix of first baseman and pitcher, and hit .312 in three seasons for the Minutemen, including .345 as a junior in 2009. Matt played shortstop and third baseman at UMass, and finished his career with a .334 batting average over his four years, and a team-leading .402 average during his senior year in 2011. Matt was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 45th round of the 2011 MLB Draft; he played in Minor League Baseball for several Red Sox farm teams from 2011 through 2014. Marissa Gedman attended Noble and Greenough School where she participated in field hockey, ice hockey, and softball. In her 2008 season, she achieved All-League ISL, a NE Championship, and 16-U National Championship in Ice Hockey. She went on to attend Harvard University starting in 2010, and played for the women's ice hockey team, accumulating 75 points with the Harvard Crimson women's ice hockey program. For the 2015-16 season, she was a member of the Boston Pride of the NWHL and participated in the 2016 Outdoor Women's Classic, the first outdoor professional women‚Äôs hockey game. In his spare time during the baseball off-season, Gedman holds catching clinics all over central Massachusetts including The Strike Zone in Worcester, MA, Shrewsbury High School and Triple Play Batting Cages in Clinton, Massachusetts.

In ≈†andalja Cave near Pula, and in Punikve near Ivanec, flints made by pre-Neanderthal people have been found, while the remains of Neanderthal prehistoric humans have been discovered on Hu≈°njakovo near Krapina. In the middle Paleolithic period, Neandertals lived in modern Zagorje, northern Croatia. Dragutin Gorjanoviƒá-Kramberger discovered bones and other remnants of a Neandertal, subsequently named Homo krapiniensis, on a hill near the town of Krapina. Palaeolithic site on Hu≈°njakovo near Krapina, counted among the largest and richest sites in the world where Neanderthal remains have been found. During excavations from 1899 to 1905, led by the palaeontologist and geologist Dragutin Gorjanoviƒá-Kramberger, abundant remains of Palaeolithic items and the bones of extinct prehistoric animals were discovered. The Krapina finds are estimated to be 130,000 years old. Archaeological finds from the Palaeolithic Age have been discovered in other places throughout Croatia (Vindija Cave, Veternica, etc.). Vindija sediments are 12 m thick, divided in 13 layers designated from unit A (youngest) to unit M. The Vuƒçedol Dove, a ritual vessel made between 2800 and 2500 BC, is an emblem of the Vuƒçedol culture. The Neolithic period (c. 6000 BC ‚Äì c. 3000 BC) was characterised by the emergence of permanent, organised settlements, and by the production of earthenware and other items. In the Adriatic area, the most significant Neolithic cultures are the Impresso, Danilo and Hvar cultures, and, in the interior, the Sopot and Korenovo cultures, while the major sites where finds have been recovered are Smilƒçiƒá near Zadar, Danilo near ≈†ibenik, Markova and Grapƒçeva Caves on Hvar, and others. In the early Neolithic period, the Starƒçevo, Vinƒça and Sopot cultures were scattered between and around the Sava, the Drava and the Danube. Notable are the excavation sites of ≈†ƒçitarjevo near Zagreb, Sopot near Vinkovci, Vuƒçedol near Vukovar, Nakovanj on Pelje≈°ac. Smilƒçiƒá, near Zadar, one of the richest Neolithic sites on open ground. The settlement was surrounded by a defence moat and the dwellings were huts built above ground from interwoven branches. It has been established that the settlement developed in two stages: the earlier stage, with finds from the Impresso culture, and the later stage, characterised by the Danilo culture. Among the finds, some ceramic, richly decorated cultic vessels with four feet (rhytons) stand out, as well as various vessels decorated with paintings and engravings. As the Stone Age moved into the Bronze Age, known as the Eneolithic period, in which the first metal ‚Äì copper ‚Äì began to be used, the Vuƒçedol culture arose (c. 3000 BC ‚Äì c. 2200 BC), named after the locality of Vuƒçedol, on the bank of the Danube near Vukovar. Vuƒçedol, near Vukovar, an important prehistoric site (‚ÄòThe Troy of the Danube‚Äô), after which the Vuƒçedol culture was named, and which embraced a wider cultural complex from the Carpathians to the eastern Alps and the Dinaric Alps. It is presumed to have emerged after the arrival of Indo-European settlers around 3,000 BC and lasted until about 2,000 BC. Its characteristics include new metalwork procedures, extremely skilled ceramics, and, according to some researchers, the people used a calendar marked on ceramic vessels. In the Bronze Age (c. 2500 BC ‚Äì c. 800 BC), a period of great ethnic strife and migration, metalwork and techniques for producing bronze items continued to develop. Several cultural groups can be singled out (the Gradina (hillfort) culture in Istria, the Urnfield culture in northern Croatia, the Cetina culture in Dalmatia, etc.), which arose through the symbiosis of earlier cultural traditions and the various influences of strong neighbouring cultures. The Iron Age left traces of the Hallstatt culture (proto-Illyrians) and the La T√®ne culture (proto- Celts). The arrival of the systematic production and use of iron tools marked the beginning of the Iron Age (c. 800 BC ‚Äì early 1st century), during which the first ethnic communities appeared in the area which is present-day Croatia. Their names were recorded by Greek and Roman writers. They belonged to the Illyrian Histri, Iapodes, Liburnians, Delmatae, Ardiaei, etc., and came under the strong influence of Greek and Italic culture, and from the 4th century BC, under the influence of Celtic spiritual and material culture. Nesactium (Vizaƒçe), northeast of Pula, was a prominent centre for the Illyrian Histri in the first millennium BC. They continued to live there right up to late classical times, i.e. the early Christian era. In Nesactium, bronze pails decorated with figures, fragments of jewellery, weapons and ceramics have been found, along with examples of monumental stonework, representing the greatest achievements of prehistoric artistic creativity on Croatian soil. In the village of Prozor near Otoƒçac, the remains of a settlement and necropolis belonging to the Illyrians Iapodes (first millennium BC) have been discovered. The people lived there during the Roman age. They had a high level of artistic craftwork, represented by bronze ornaments with specific shapes, such as ornaments for the head (circlets), pendants, links for belts, buckles, clasps, and so on, and their jewellery was distinct for its use of amber and glass paste. Illyria In recorded history, the area was inhabited by Illyrian tribes such as the Delmetae, who spoke an Illyrian language, an ancient branch of Indo-European. Other tribes such as the Liburni and Iapodes, whose ethnicity is less clear, inhabited various parts of the Adriatic coastline and interior between modern Istria and Herzegovina. In the 4th century BC the northern parts of modern-day Croatia were also colonized by the Celts, the Scordisci tribe. Other Celtic peoples may also have been found elsewhere integrated among the Illyrians. The islands of Issa and Pharos as well as the locality of Tragurion became Greek colonies since the same period. Illyria was a sovereign state until the Romans conquered it two centuries later, in 168 BC. The Romans organized the land into the Roman province of Illyricum which encompassed most of modern Croatia (Istria was part of the province of Italia). Illyricum was subsequently split into the provinces of Pannonia and Dalmatia in year 10. Pannonia was further split in two by Trajan between 102 and 107. A fourfold split of the same province followed at the turn of the 4th century under Diocletian -- an emperor of Illyrian descent, from Dalmatia. Other notable people from these areas in this period included the Christian Jerome, Saint Marinus (builder of San Marino), emperors Valentinian I and Valens, and Pope John IV. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Roman roads and the Illyrian population speaking Romance languages (such as Istro-Romanian or Dalmatian) remained. With the increasing amount of human migration, this population entrenched in the cities along the whole Dalmatian coast. The Lombards and the Huns made an incursion from the north. After 476 the area was subject to Odoacer and then to Ostrogoth rulers beginning with Theodoric the Great. Justinian claimed the old province of Dalmatia to the Eastern Roman Empire in 535. Forebears of Croatia's current Slav population settled there in the 7th century following the Avars, reportedly under instructions from Byzantine emperor Heraclius. However, that Avaro-Slavic alliance was conquered and wiped out from Croatia.

The meeting marked a turning point in Hitler's foreign policies, which then began to radicalize. According to the memorandum, Hitler did not want war in 1939 with Britain and France. He wanted small wars of plunder to help support Germany's struggling economy. It was named for the keeper of the minutes of the meeting, Hitler's military adjutant, Colonel Friedrich Hossbach. Also attending the meeting were the Reich Foreign Minister, Baron Konstantin von Neurath; the Reich War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg; the Army Commander, General Werner von Fritsch; the Kriegsmarine Commander, Admiral Erich Raeder; and the Luftwaffe Commander, Hermann G√∂ring. Contents The conference of 5 November 1937 had been called in response to complaints from Admiral Raeder that the navy (Kriegsmarine) was receiving insufficient allocations of steel and other raw materials and that its entire building programme was thus in danger of collapse. Neither the air force (Luftwaffe) nor the army (Heer) wanted to see any reductions of their steel allocations. As the conference had been called in response to resolve the dispute, Hitler took the opportunity to provide a summary of his assessment of foreign policy. He stated that if he died, the contents of the conference were to be regarded as his \\"political testament\\".Aigner, Dietrich. \\"Hitler's Ultimate Aims\\". H. W. Koch, ed. Aspects of the Third Reich. London: Macmillan Press, 1985, p. 264 In Hitler's view, the German economy had reached such a state of crisis that the only way of stopping a drastic fall in living standards in Germany was to embark on a policy of aggression sooner, rather than later, to provide sufficient Lebensraum by seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia.Messerschmidt, Manfred, \\"Foreign Policy and Preparation for War\\", Germany and the Second World War pp. 636‚Äì637; Carr, William, Arms, Autarchy and Aggression, pp. 73‚Äì78 Moreover, Hitler announced that it was imperative to act at some time within the next five or six years before \\"two hate-inspired antagonists\\", Britain and France, closed the gap in the arms race in which, Hitler noted, Germany was already falling behind. A striking change in the Hossbach Memorandum is Hitler's new evaluation of Britain: from a prospective ally in 1928 in the Zweites Buch to a \\"hate-inspired antagonist\\" in 1937 that was unwilling and unable to accept a strong Germany. The change marked a total reversal of Hitler's view of Britain.Robertson, E. M. Hitler's Pre-War Policy and Military Plans. p. 106 German historian Klaus Hildebrand has argued that the memorandum marked the beginning of an \\"ambivalent course\\" towards Britain.Hildebrand, Klaus. The Foreign Policy of the Third Reich. p. 42. Likewise, Andreas Hillgruber contended that Hitler was embarking on expansion \\"without Britain\\": preferably \\"with Britain\\" but, if necessary, \\"against Britain\\".Hillgruber, Andreas. \\"England's Place In Hitler's Plans for World Dominion\\". Journal of Contemporary History, Volume 9, 1974. pp. 5‚Äì22. The first part of the document minuted Hitler's wish that Germany should strive for autarky, as he reasoned that reliance on others makes a state weak. That has been labelled by some historians as a way of preparing Germany for conflict by ensuring that it was not economically reliant on states with which it could soon be at war. The memorandum's suggestion that certain types of autarky were not possible can thus be considered to be reasons for regarding the war as something of a necessity. Indeed, the economic arguments appear to all but guarantee a war of fears for food supplies being reliant upon foreign trade in a world that was dominated by British-policed sea trade lanes: The second part of the document detailed three 'contingencies' that Hitler would take if certain situations prevailed in Europe, purportedly to ensure the security of the Reich. Beyond that, Hitler claimed that two \\"hate-inspired antagonists\\" (Britain and France) were blocking German foreign policy goals at every turn and that sometime in the next five years or so, Germany would have to achieve autarky by seizing Eastern Europe to prepare for a possible war with the British and the French. After the conference, three of the attendees (Blomberg, Fritsch and Neurath) all argued that the foreign policy Hitler had outlined was too risky, as Germany needed more time to rearm. Also, they stated that the 'contingencies' that Hitler described as the prerequisite for war were too unlikely to occur such as the apparent certainty expressed in the document of the Spanish Civil War leading to a Franco-Italian war in the Mediterranean or that France was on the verge of civil war. Moreover, it was argued that any German aggression in Eastern Europe was bound to trigger a war with France because of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called cordon sanitaire, and if that a Franco-German war broke out, Britain was almost certain to intervene to prevent France's defeat.Weinberg, Gerhard. The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, 1980, pp. 39‚Äì40 Thus, any German attack on the states of Eastern Europe such as Czechoslovakia was likely to lead to war with the British and the French before Germany was fully rearmed and ready for war with the other great powers. As such, Fritsch, Blomberg and Neurath advised Hitler to wait until Germany had more time to rearm before pursuing a high-risk strategy of pursuing localized wars that was likely to trigger a general war before Germany was ready for such a war. All of those present at the conference had no moral objections to Hitler's strategy, but were divided on timing only.Weinberg, Gerhard. The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, 1980, pp. 39‚Äì40. By February 1938, Neurath, Fritsch and Blomberg had been removed from their positions. Some historians, such as Sir John Wheeler-Bennett and William L. Shirer, believed that Blomberg, Fritsch and Neurath were removed because of their opposition to the plans expressed in the Hossbach memorandum. The accuracy of the memorandum has been questioned, as the minutes were drawn up five days after the event by Hossbach from notes that he took at the meeting and also from memory. Also, Hitler did not review the minutes of the meeting; instead he insisted, as he commonly did, that he was too busy to bother with such small details. The British historian A. J. P. Taylor contended that the manuscript that was used by the prosecution in the Nuremberg Trials appears to be a shortened version of the original, as it had passed through the US Army before the trial. Taylor drew attention to one thing that the memorandum can be used to prove: \\"Goering, Raeder and Neurath had sat by and approved of Hitler's aggressive plans.\\" However, that did not necessarily mean that Hitler laid down his plans for the domination of Europe, as there was no active decision to start a war made in the memorandum, only a decision about when war would be practical. However, Hitler mentioned his wish for increased armaments. Taylor attempted to discredit the document by using the fact that the future annexations described in the 'contingencies' were unlike those that occurred in 1939. However, opposing historians, such as Taylor's archrival Hugh Trevor-Roper, have pointed out that the memorandum still demonstrated an intention for adding Austria, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania and Poland to the Reich. Taylor also stipulated that the meeting was most likely a piece of internal politics, and he pointed out that Hitler could have been trying to encourage the gathering's members to put pressure on Reich Minister of Economics and President of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht, to release more funding for rearmament. In fact, Schacht soon resigned in protest at the pre- eminence of rearmament in Nazi economics. Contending historians have also pointed out that rearmament is an integral part of a preparation for conflict. In response, Taylor argued that Hitler's policy was a bluff (he wished to rearm Germany to frighten and intimidate other states) to allow him to achieve his foreign policy goals without going to war. In addition, Taylor argued that most of the 'contingencies' that Hitler listed as the prerequisite for war, such as an outbreak of civil war in France or the Spanish Civil War that led to a war between Italy and France in the Mediterranean, did not occur. Trevor- Roper countered that criticism by arguing that Hitler expressed an intention to go to war sooner rather than later and that it was Hitler's intentions in foreign policy in late 1937, as opposed to his precise plans later in history, that really mattered. Intentionalist and structuralist arguments It is often used by intentionalist historians such as Gerhard Weinberg, Andreas Hillgruber and Richard Overy to prove that Hitler planned to start a general European war, which became the Second World War, as part of a longtime master plan. However, functionalist historians such as Timothy Mason, Hans Mommsen and Ian Kershaw argue that the document shows no such plans but the memorandum was an improvised ad hoc response by Hitler to the growing crisis in the German economy in the late 1930s.

They typically describe the events of the meeting and may include a list of attendees, a statement of the issues considered by the participants, and related responses or decisions for the issues. Etymology The name \\"minutes\\" possibly derives from the Latin phrase minuta scriptura (literally \\"small writing\\") meaning \\"rough notes\\".  Creation  Minutes may be created during the meeting by a typist or court reporter, who may use shorthand notation and then prepare the minutes and issue them to the participants afterwards. Alternatively, the meeting can be audio recorded, video recorded, or a group's appointed or informally assigned secretary may take notes, with minutes prepared later. Many government agencies use minutes recording software to record and prepare all minutes in real-time.  Purpose  Minutes are the official written record of the meetings of an organization or group. They are not transcripts of those proceedings. Using Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR), the minutes should contain mainly a record of what was done at the meeting, not what was said by the members. The organization may have its own rules regarding the content of the minutes. For most organizations or groups, it is important for the minutes to be terse and only include a summary of the decisions. A verbatim report (transcript) is typically not useful. Unless the organization's rules require it, a summary of the discussions in a meeting is neither necessary nor appropriate. The minutes of certain groups, such as a corporate board of directors, must be kept on file and are important legal documents. Minutes from board meetings are kept separately from minutes of general membership meetings within the same organization. Also, minutes of executive sessions may be kept separately. Committees are not required to keep formal minutes although less formal notes may be taken. For committees, their formal records are the reports submitted to their parent body. Format The format of the minutes can vary depending on the standards established by an organization, although there are general guidelines. Robert's Rules of Order contains a sample set of minutes. Generally, minutes begin with the name of the body holding the meeting (e.g., a board) and may also include the place, date, list of people present, and the time that the chair called the meeting to order. Since the primary function of minutes is to record the decisions made, all official decisions must be included. If a formal motion is proposed and seconded, then (regardless whether it passes) this is recorded. The voting tally may also be included. The part of the minutes dealing with a routine motion might note merely that a particular motion was \\"moved by Ann and passed\\". It is not strictly necessary to include the name of the person who seconds a motion. Where a tally is included, it is sufficient to record the number of people voting for and against a motion, but requests by participants to note their votes by name may be allowed. If a decision is made by roll-call vote, then all of the individual votes are recorded by name. If it is made by general consent without a formal vote, then this fact may be recorded. The minutes may end with a note of the time that the meeting was adjourned. Minutes are sometimes submitted by the person who is responsible for them (often the secretary) at a subsequent meeting for review. The traditional closing phrase is \\"Respectfully submitted\\" (although this is no longer common), followed by the officer's signature, his or her typed (or printed) name, and his or her title. Usually, one of the first items in an order of business or an agenda for a meeting is the reading and approval of the minutes from the previous meeting. If the members of the group agree (usually by unanimous consent) that the written minutes reflect what happened at the previous meeting, then they are approved, and the fact of their approval is recorded in the minutes of the current meeting. If there are significant errors or omissions, then the minutes may be redrafted and submitted again at a later date. Minor changes may be made immediately using the normal amendment procedures, and the amended minutes may be approved \\"as amended\\". It is normally appropriate to send a draft copy of the minutes to all the members in advance of the meeting so that the meeting is not delayed by a reading of the draft.

The base game cards were released in 2003, with newer expansions introduced in the months since. A video game adaptation, titled Warhammer: Battle for Atluma, was created for the PSP in 2006. Gameplay summary In WarCry the opposing players become generals of vast armies and wage battles for control over the Old World. Each game is divided into three segments called battles. The outcome of each battle is determined after both players pass consecutively. Their Victory Points totals are compared and the player with the highest total wins the battle. The player who wins two out of the three battles is the winner. To begin playing the game each player needs two decks - the Army Deck and the Action Deck - containing a minimum of 30 cards each. The Army Deck consists cards representing units that will fight for you, the heroes that may fight alongside a given unit and magical weapons, armor or other items that can somehow help swing the tide of battle in your favour. The Action Deck has cards that represent special strategies, powerful attacks and other tricks that every leader has to know in order to win. Each battle is divided into two phases: the muster phase and the combat phase. In the muster phase players take turns placing unit or equipment cards on the table. Each such card has a cost in Gold points. In the first battle both players can muster units for up to 20 Gold, in the second - up to 25, and in the third - up to 30. When both players are done mustering units the combat phase begins. The opponents take turns issuing commands (a command can be an attack, a move or playing a special card from hand). After they both pass successively the battle ends. The player with the most Victory Points (calculated by adding the strength of the surviving units) wins. Card types WarCry includes cards for the Grand Alliance (featuring blue marble backgrounds), the Hordes of Darkness (featuring black backgrounds with bones or fire), and neutral cards (featuring green backgrounds with leaf vines). The cards are further broken down into the following types: *Units - Unit cards represent small armies or soldiers on the battlefield, including infantry, cavalry, and flying units. *Attachments - Attachment cards are attached to units, where they generally remain until the unit is destroyed. They can confer bonuses or additional abilities. *Actions - Action cards are used during combat to help friendly units or punish the enemy. They represent things such as strategies, tactics, or unexpected events. Card sets WarCry cards are released in sets each containing 120 unique cards (with exceptions noted below). They can be purchased in randomized booster packs of 9 playable cards and one redeemable \\"Gold Piece\\" card. On July 1, 2006, the Sabertooth Games redemption program officially ended, with newer boosters no longer containing any redeemable cards. On December 12, 2006, Sabertooth announced that Veterans of Battle would be the final WarCry product release. =Standard card sets= *WarCry (core set) (2003, 184 cards) *Winds of Magic (2003) *Siege of Darkness (August 2003) *Dogs of War (December 2003) *Path of Glory (March 2004) *Legions of Chaos (June 2004) *Siege of Middenheim (September 2004) *Harbingers of War (January 2005) *Bringers of Darkness (April 2005) *Bearers of Redemption (July 2005) *Swords of Retribution (October 2005) *War of Attrition (January 2006, 388 cards from earlier expansions) *Hand of Fate (March 2006) *Marks of Power (May 2006) *Veterans of Battle (January 2007) =Special pre-constructed decks of 2x60 cards (\\"battle boxes\\")= *Chivalry and Deceit (April 2004) - Bretonnia vs. Skaven *Death and Honour (January 2005) - Imperial Vampire Hunters vs. Vampire Counts *Valor and Treachery (September 2005) - Wood Elves vs. Skaven =Special sets= *Champions of the Grand Alliance binder (September 2004) - 6x3 Alliance cards *Champions of the Hordes of Darkness binder (September 2004) - 6x3 Horde cards *Legends of WarCry (June 2005) - 6x3 cards for the six main races References External links * *CHAOTIT - Czech page - WarCry + Warhammer + Warhammer 40K + LOTR TMG *CCGTOOLS - UK fan page - Details about many CCGs including WarCry Category:Card games introduced in 2003 Category:Collectible card games Category:Warhammer Fantasy ","title":"WarCry (game)"},{"id":"901062","text":"The (LHD) is a fusion research device in Toki, Gifu, Japan, belonging to the National Institute for Fusion Science.

Thiamine pyrophosphate is a cofactor that is present in all living systems, in which it catalyzes several biochemical reactions. Thiamine pyrophosphate is synthesized in the cytosol and is required in the cytosol for the activity of transketolase and in the mitochondria for the activity of pyruvate-, oxoglutarate- and branched chain keto acid dehydrogenases. To date, the yeast ThPP carrier (Tpc1p) the human Tpc and the Drosophila melanogaster have been identified as being responsible for the mitochondrial transport of ThPP and ThMP. It was first discovered as an essential nutrient (vitamin) in humans through its link with the peripheral nervous system disease beriberi, which results from a deficiency of thiamine in the diet. TPP works as a coenzyme in many enzymatic reactions, such as: * Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex * Pyruvate decarboxylase in ethanol fermentation * Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex * Branched-chain amino acid dehydrogenase complex * 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase * Transketolase Chemistry The \\"ylide form\\" of TPP. Chemically, TPP consists of a pyrimidine ring which is connected to a thiazole ring, which is in turn connected to a pyrophosphate (diphosphate) functional group. The part of TPP molecule that is most commonly involved in reactions is the thiazole ring, which contains nitrogen and sulfur. Thus, the thiazole ring is the \\"reagent portion\\" of the molecule. The C2 of this ring is capable of acting as an acid by donating its proton and forming a carbanion. Normally, reactions that form carbanions are highly unfavorable, but the positive charge on the tetravalent nitrogen just adjacent to the carbanion stabilizes the negative charge, making the reaction much more favorable. (A compound with positive and negative charges on adjacent atoms is called an ylid or ylide, so sometimes the carbanion form of TPP is referred to as the \\"ylid form\\"). Reaction mechanisms In several reactions, including that of pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase, TPP catalyses the reversible decarboxylation reaction (aka cleavage of a substrate compound at a carbon-carbon bond connecting a carbonyl group to an adjacent reactive group‚Äîusually a carboxylic acid or an alcohol). It achieves this in four basic steps: #The carbanion of the TPP ylid nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl group on the substrate. (This forms a single bond between the TPP and the substrate.) #The target bond on the substrate is broken, and its electrons are pushed towards the TPP. This creates a double bond between the substrate carbon and the TPP carbon and pushes the electrons in the N-C double bond in TPP entirely onto the nitrogen atom, reducing it from a positive to neutral form. #In what is essentially the reverse of step two, the electrons push back in the opposite direction forming a new bond between the substrate carbon and another atom. (In the case of the decarboxylases, this creates a new carbon- hydrogen bond. In the case of transketolase, this attacks a new substrate molecule to form a new carbon-carbon bond.) #In what is essentially the reverse of step one, the TPP-substrate bond is broken, reforming the TPP ylid and the substrate carbonyl.

The Alphabet of ben Sirach (Alphabetum Siracidis, Otijot ben Sira, Alpha Beta la- Ben Sira) is an anonymous text of the Middle Ages inspired by the Hellenistic work known as the Sirach. Its date of authorship is estimated to have been anywhere between 700 and 1000 CE. It is a compilation of two lists of proverbs, 22 in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic and 22 in Mishnaic Hebrew, both arranged as alphabetic acrostics. Each proverb is followed by a Haggadic commentary. The work has been characterized as satire, and it contains references to masturbation, incest and flatulence. The text has been translated into Latin, Yiddish, Judaeo-Spanish, French and German. A partial English translation appeared in Stern and Mirsky (1998). Aramaic proverbs The Aramaic proverbs are the far older part of the book. Five of them can be traced to Talmudic-Midrashic literature. The Hebrew commentary, illustrating the proverbs with fables, is much younger. in the reading of Ginzberg: #\\"Honor the physician before thou hast need of him\\", (Sirach 38:1) #\\"If a son do not conduct himself like a son, let him float on the water.\\" #\\"Gnaw the bone that falls to thy lot whether it be good or bad.\\" #\\"Gold must be hammered, and the child must be beaten.\\" #\\"Be good and refuse not thy portion of good.\\" #\\"Woe to the wicked man and woe to his companions.\\" #\\"Cast thy bread upon the waters and upon the land, for thou shalt find it after many days\\" (Eccles. 11:1) #\\"Hast thou seen a black ass? [Then] it was neither black nor white.\\" #\\"Bestow no good upon that which is evil, and no evil will befall thee.\\" #\\"Restrain not thy hand from doing good.\\" #\\"The bride enters the bridal chamber and, nevertheless, knows not what will befall her.\\" #\\"A nod to the wise is sufficient; the fool requires a blow.\\" (Proverbs 22:15) #\\"He who honors them that despise him is like an ass.\\" #\\"A fire, when it is kindled, burns many sheaves\\" (James 3:5) #\\"An old woman in the house is a good omen in the house\\" #\\"Even a good surety has to be applied to for a hundred morrows; a bad one for a hundred thousand.\\" #\\"Rise quickly from the table and thou wilt avoid disputes.\\" #\\"In thy business deal only with the upright.\\" #\\"If the goods are near at hand, the owner consumes them; but if they are at a distance, they consume him.\\" #\\"Do not disavow an old friend.\\" #\\"Thou mayest have sixty counselors, but do not give up thy own opinion\\" #\\"He that was first satisfied and then hungry will offer thee his hand; but not he that was first hungry and then satisfied.\\" The second Alphabet The 22 Hebrew proverbs are quite different in character from the Aramaic ones, and much more recent. Half of the proverbs are borrowed from the Talmud, and are only a pretext for the presentation of a number of legends surrounding Ben Sira. Ben Sira is presented as the son of Jeremiah. Ben Sira's fame reached Nebuchadnezzar II, who called him to his court. Nebuchadnezzar sets forth various ordeals for Ben Sira, who responds with 22 stories. Some of the fables of the collection are indebted to Christian legend, and to the Indian Panchatantra. =Lilith= The text is best known because of its reference to Lilith, and it is the fifth of Ben Sira's responses to King Nebuchadnezzar. It is reproduced here in its entirety: Jewish scholars have written arguments urging for Lilith's depiction in The Alphabet of Ben Sira to be reevaluated, based on the fact that this text was originally written primarily as a work of satire. Although the negativity surrounding Lilith's character as a demoness (i.e. terrorising pregnant women, fornicating with demons, murdering infants, etc.) was taken with a varying degree of superstition within Judaism, it should not go unrecognized that much of the work was probably intended satirically.Academia.edu:WOMAN HAS TWO FACES: RE-EXAMINING EVE AND LILITH IN JEWISH FEMINIST THOUGHT. Carvalho, Diana. June 2009. Retrieved April 18, 2015. Some scholars have written arguments recognizing the satire as a way to clearly understand the social anxieties that lie at the center of the Alphabet, particularly as embodied by Lilith: Some other scholars argue that the satirical tone of the composition makes it even more difficult to assess the value of Lilith. The ruthlessly parodic tone of the Alphabet suggests that the blade of criticism is actually directed against Adam, who turns out to be weak and ineffective in his relations with his wife. Apparently, the first man is not the only male figure who is mocked: Even the Holy One cannot subjugate Lilith and needs to ask his messengers, who only manage to go as far as negotiating the conditions of the agreement. Lilith is approached in her own dwelling by the divine emissaries, themselves a miserable reflection of the four majestic angels of the Enochian tradition. Thus, even if the Alphabet should not be treated as a manifesto of female empowerment, Lilith is presented therein as the strongest and most influential character from among her literary companions.

However, in ferns it is thought to offer protection from insects while studies have shown that thiamine hydrolase (thiaminase type 2) which was originally thought to be involved solely in the degradation of thiamine has actually been identified as having a role in thiamine degradation with the salvage of the pyrimidine moiety where thiamin hydrolysis product N-formyl-4-amino-5-aminomethyl-2-methylpyrimidine is transported into the cell and deformylated by the ylmB-encoded amidohydrolase and hydrolyzed to 5-aminoimidazole ribotide. It was first described as the cause of highly mortal ataxic neuropathy in fur producing foxes eating raw entrails of river fish like carp in 1941. It is also known as the cause of cerebrocortical necrosis of cattle and polioencephalomalasia of sheep eating thiaminase containing plants. It was once causing economical losses in raising fisheries, e.g. in yellowtail fed raw anchovy as a sole feed for a certain period, and also in sea bream and rainbow trout. The same problem is being studied in a natural food chain system. The larvae of a wild silk worm Anaphe venata are being consumed in a rain forest district of Nigeria as a supplemental protein nutrition, and the heat resistant thiaminase in it is causing an acute seasonal cerebellar ataxia. In 1860‚Äì61, Burke and Wills were the first Europeans to cross Australia south to north; on their return they subsisted primarily on raw nardoo-fern. It is possible that this led to their death due to the extremely high levels of thiaminase contained in nardoo. The Aborigines prepared nardoo by soaking the sporocarps in water for at least a day to avoid the effects of thiamine deficiency that would result from ingesting the leaves raw. In the explorers' journals they noted many symptoms of thiamine deficiency, so it is thought that they did not soak the nardoo long enough. Eventually thiamine deficiency could have led to their demise. It is noteworthy to mention that there are several other hypotheses regarding what may have killed Burke and Wills and it is widely disagreed upon by historians and scientists alike.

After sailing around the world as a private yacht in 1934 she served as a training ship in the United States, and is now a museum ship at Mystic Seaport in Connecticut. Service history Joseph Conrad in 2008 Late one night in 1905 in Copenhagen during a fireworks display over the harbor the ships crew were ordered to shut down the lights, and most of the crew went down to their bunks to sleep. A larger merchant ship came into the direction of the ship, now completely black due to no lights, and so, it crashed and filled the bunks where the boys were sleeping, killing 22 boys the ages of 14 to 17. The ship was raised afterward. It was on guard during WWI but was more of a merchant ship and not even moved from the harbor. Australian sailor and author Alan Villiers saved Georg Stage from the scrappers and renamed the ship in honor of famed sea author Joseph Conrad. Villiers planned a circumnavigation with a crew of mostly boys. Joseph Conrad sailed from Ipswich on 22 October 1934, crossed the Atlantic Ocean to New York City, then down to Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, and across the Indian Ocean and through the East Indies. After stops in Sydney, New Zealand, and Tahiti, Joseph Conrad rounded Cape Horn and returned to New York on 16 October 1936, having traveled a total of some . Villiers was bankrupted as a result of the expedition (although he did get three books out of the episode - Cruise of the Conrad, Stormalong, and Joey Goes to Sea), and sold the ship to Huntington Hartford, heir to the A&P; supermarket fortune, who added an engine and used her as a yacht. In 1939 Hartford donated Joseph Conrad to the United States Coast Guard for use as a training ship for the merchant marine based in Jacksonville, Florida. She participated in a training cruise through the Caribbean beginning in December, 1939 and sailed in the St. Petersburg to Havana Yacht Race in early 1941, a few months before the United States entered World War II. The Coast Guard turned the vessel over to the Maritime Administration when the merchant marine training functions of the Coast Guard were transferred to the newly created War Shipping Administration on September 1, 1942. Joseph Conrad continued to serve as a training ship until the war's end in 1945.https://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Joseph_Conrad.pdf After being laid up for two years, the ship was transferred to Mystic Seaport in Stonington, Connecticut on July 9, 1947 for \\"museum and youth training purposes\\", where she has remained ever since as a floating exhibit. In addition to her role as a museum, she is also a static training vessel and is employed by Mystic Seaport to house campers attending the Joseph Conrad Sailing Camp.

It is the sodium salt of the polyphosphate penta-anion, which is the conjugate base of triphosphoric acid. It is produced on a large scale as a component of many domestic and industrial products, especially detergents. Environmental problems associated with eutrophication are attributed to its widespread use. Preparation and properties Sodium tripolyphosphate is produced by heating a stoichiometric mixture of disodium phosphate, Na2HPO4, and monosodium phosphate, NaH2PO4, under carefully controlled conditions. :2 Na2HPO4 \\\\+ NaH2PO4 ‚Üí Na5P3O10 \\\\+ 2 H2O In this way, approximately 2 million tons are produced annually. STPP is a colourless salt, which exists both in anhydrous form and as the hexahydrate. The anion can be described as the pentanionic chain [O3POP(O)2OPO3]5‚àí. Many related di-, tri-, and polyphosphates are known including the cyclic triphosphate P3O93‚àí. It binds strongly to metal cations as both a bidentate and tridentate chelating agent. Chelation of a metal cation by triphosphate. Uses =In detergents= The majority of STPP is consumed as a component of commercial detergents. It serves as a \\"builder,\\" industrial jargon for a water softener. In hard water (water that contains high concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+), detergents are deactivated. Being a highly charged chelating agent, TPP5‚àí binds to dications tightly and prevents them from interfering with the sulfonate detergent. =Food applications= STPP is a preservative for seafood, meats, poultry, and animal feeds. It is common in food production as E number E451. In foods, STPP is used as an emulsifier and to retain moisture. Many governments regulate the quantities allowed in foods, as it can substantially increase the sale weight of seafood in particular. The United States Food and Drug Administration lists STPP as \\"generally recognized as safe.\\" =Other uses= Other uses (hundreds of thousands of tons/year) include ceramics (decrease the viscosity of glazes up to a certain limit), leather tanning (as masking agent and synthetic tanning agent - SYNTAN), anticaking agents, setting retarders, flame retardants, paper, anticorrosion pigments, textiles, rubber manufacture, fermentation, antifreeze.\\" TPP is used as a polyanion crosslinker in polysaccharide based drug delivery. Toothpaste. Health effects High serum phosphate concentration has been identified as a predictor of cardiovascular events and mortality. Whilst phosphate is present in the body and food in organic forms, inorganic forms of phosphate such as sodium triphosphate are readily adsorbed and can result in elevated phosphate levels in serum. Salts of polyphosphate anions are moderately irritating to skin and mucous membranes because they are mildly alkaline. Environmental effects Because it is very water-soluble, STPP is not significantly removed by waste water treatment. STPP hydrolyses to phosphate, which is be assimilated into the natural phosphorus cycle. Detergents containing phosphorus contribute to the eutrophication of many fresh waters. The eutrophication of the Potomac River, caused from phosphate run-off, is evident from the bright green bloom of algae. See also * Sodium trimetaphosphate a cyclic triphosphate.

It originally premiered on December 1, 1977, on Channel C-3 of QUBE's local cable system in Columbus, Ohio. Channel C-3 made the move to national television in April 1979 when Nickelodeon first launched. The Pinwheel program would continue to air on the network until 1990. In the late 1980s, Pinwheel was gradually phased out in favor of another puppet series, Eureeka's Castle. The Los Angeles Times called Eureeka's Castle a successor series to Pinwheel.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1989-09-04-ca-1156-story.html Broadcast Pinwheel was the flagship program of C-3, a children's network in Columbus, Ohio, in the earliest days of cable television broadcasting. Pinwheel was cited as \\"the world's first TV channel geared strictly to preschoolers.\\" C-3 soon changed its name to Pinwheel. In 1979, Warner Cable purchased the Sat-1 communications satellite from Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker and rebranded the Pinwheel Channel as Nickelodeon, where it reformatted Pinwheel as hour-long episodes shown in three- to five-hour blocks, a format which eventually became the model for Nick Jr. programming for younger children. There were a total of 260 Pinwheel episodes recorded from 1977 to 1984. Pinwheel continued to air in reruns until 1991. It remains the longest-running Nickelodeon show in episodes and hours on air and was the longest-running in years until You Can't Do That on Television broke the record. It is now #7, behind All That, You Can't Do That on Television, Nick News, Rugrats, SpongeBob SquarePants and The Fairly OddParents. The program was also the last original program (upon its debut in 1979) on Nickelodeon to end. A half-hour version of Pinwheel was created for international distribution; it aired in Canada on Superchannel (from 1983 to 1988) and TVOntario (from 1990 to 1993), in the UK on Channel 4 and later on The Children's Channel, and on Nick Jr. during the show's final year of reruns. Premise The show was similar to Sesame Street; action scenes took place in and around a large Victorian-style boarding house called Pinwheel House with a pinwheel on one of the peaks. Live actors interacted with puppets, discussing various concepts familiar to children's programming like sharing, being considerate, the environment, and colors. All of the characters lived and worked in the various areas in and around the house. The QUBE episodes relied heavily on songs mostly performed by Jake. Pinwheel underwent several changes when the Pinwheel channel was relaunched as Nickelodeon in 1979. Taping of Pinwheel moved to Matrix Studios in New York City, where the set was rebuilt. Arline Miyazaki, Betty Rozek and Dale Engel joined the cast as Kim, Sal and Smitty, Craig Marin and Olga Felgemacher created new puppet characters, and Nickelodeon acquired a package of children's shorts from Coe Film Associates to reduce the show's workload. Characters =Humans= Kim (Arline Miyazaki) - Aurelia‚Äôs niece (confirmed on the Pinwheel Songbook VHS video) who was also the resident artist of Pinwheel House. Sal (Betty Rozek) and Smitty (Dale Engel) - an elderly couple who ran a local newspaper called The Daily Noodle. One of Smitty's long-running obsessions was to capture a photograph of the elusive Admiral Bird for the front page of the Daily Noodle, though he was constantly missing his chance. Jake (George James) - a boarder who enjoyed music and whose hobby was collecting unusual sounds in small boxes. Franci (Franci Anderson) - an artist and storyteller; she was on the show during its earliest years, but her character was eventually phased out. Coco (C.C. Loveheart from 1977‚Äì1979, Lindanell Rivera from 1979‚Äì1984) - a Parisian mime who didn't speak. =Puppets= Aurelia - a bohemian-style character who owned Pinwheel House. She had a ginger bob, olive green eyes, fuchsia lips and wore colorful head scarfs and large hoop earrings. She was friendly and bubbly, but firm. Plus and Minus - twin boys who lived in the attic room and were Aurelia's nephews. The color schemes for the twins were the exact opposite, with Plus having black hair and orange skin and Minus with white hair and purple skin. Minus was very upbeat and enthusiastic, while Plus was more thoughtful and easily discouraged. A recurring sketch was Plus's attempt to board a spaceship to the moon, and Minus distracting him and causing him to miss the take-off. Their favorite game was \\"Gotcha Last,\\" a combination of tag and hide and seek that went on eternally. Silas the Snail - an elderly snail who was constantly on his way to an annual snail gathering (although during the series run, he never made it further than the back garden due to snails being so slow), who extolled the virtues of slowing down and enjoying life, telling people that \\"half the fun is getting there.\\" Ebenezer T. Squint - a grumpy, green-skinned boarder who lived in a dusty basement storage room where he conspired to be featured in Smitty's newspaper. He pretended to be grouchy and antisocial but secretly enjoyed being included in the house activities. Luigi O'Brien - an Italian produce vendor who ran a small vegetable stall in the backyard of the boarding house. All of his produce also talked, sang, and had individual personalities, but were only known by their respective fruit and vegetable names (Pear, Tomato, etc.). Molly McMole - an elderly mole who lived in a tree in the backyard and often introduced cartoon shorts in the form of telling stories. Herbert and Lulu the Hobo Bugs - a brother-and-sister pair of marionettes who liked to dance and play on the hedges in the backyard and often appeared at Luigi's produce stand to ask for special items, such as an impossible pair of custom sandals that Luigi somehow manages to produce. They also loved to play with Ebenezer, who would typically tell them to leave him alone in a grumpy manner, even though he really enjoyed their company. Admiral Bird - a bright red bird marionette who would drop from the sky with a strange, echoing call. Admiral Bird rarely appeared, but seemed to enjoy teasing Smitty. Buzzy - Ebenezer's fun and somewhat dimwitted cousin who enjoyed sports. Tika, Gorkle & Woofle - three bird-like alien marionettes from the planet Zintar who lived in a garden terrarium. They were removed from the show along with Sorbin in 1979. Sorbin - a green and blue alien creature who also came from the planet Zintar.

His education took place at two schools in Sydney: he first attended St Aloysius' College, and after gaining a scholarship from Patrick Moran, he boarded at St Ignatius' College, Riverview. Brennan entered the University of Sydney in 1888, taking up studies in the Classics, and won a travelling scholarship to Berlin. There he met his future wife, Anna Elisabeth Werth; there, also, he encountered the poetry of St√©phane Mallarm√©. About this time, he decided to become a poet. In 1893 Brennan's article \\"On the Manuscripts of Aeschylus\\" appeared in The Journal of Philology. Brennan began forming a theory about the descent of Aeschylus' extant manuscripts in 1888. Returning to Australia, Brennan took up a position as a cataloguer in the public library, before being given a position as assistant lecturer in French and German in the department of modern languages and literature and in 1920 the position of associate professor in German and comparative literature at the University of Sydney.Christopher Brennan, austlit.edu.au.

The North American Station was separate from the Jamaica Station until 1830 when the two combined to form the North America and West Indies Station. It was briefly abolished in 1907 before being restored in 1915. It was renamed the America and West Indies Station in 1926. It was commanded by the Commander-in-Chief, North America and West Indies Station and subsequently by the Commander-in-Chief, America and West Indies Station. History Admiralty House, Bermuda, at Mount Wyndham (the location from 1810 to 1816) The squadron was formed in 1745 to counter French forces in North America, with the headquarters at the Halifax Naval Yard in Nova Scotia (now CFB Halifax). The area of command had first been designated as the North American Station in 1767, under the command of Commodore Samuel Hood, with the headquarters in Halifax from 1758 to 1794, and thereafter in Halifax and Bermuda. Land and buildings for a permanent Naval Yard were purchased by the Royal Navy in 1758 and the Yard was officially commissioned in 1759. The Yard served as the main base for the Royal Navy in North America during the Seven Years' War, the American Revolution, and the French Revolutionary Wars. Following American independence in 1783, Bermuda was the only British territory left between Nova Scotia and the West Indies (by agreement with the Spanish government, a Royal Navy base was maintained in Florida until this was ceded to the United States), and was selected as the new headquarters for the region. The establishment of a base there was delayed for a dozen years, however, due to the need to survey the encircling barrier reef to locate channels suitable for large warships. Once this had been completed, a base was established at St. George's in 1794, with the fleet anchoring at Murray's Anchorage in the northern lagoon, named for Vice Admiral Sir George Murray, who became the Commander-in-Chief of the new River St. Lawrence and Coast of America and North America and West Indies Station. The Admiralty also began purchasing land at Bermuda's West End, including Ireland Island, Spanish Point, and smaller islands in the Great Sound with the intent of building the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda, and a permanent naval base there, with its anchorage on Grassy Bay. The construction of this base was to drag on through much of the Nineteenth Century. Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren was appointed Commander- in-Chief in 1812, and he and his staff seem to have spent most of their time at Bermuda during the War of 1812 (he was replaced by Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Inglis Cochrane in 1813), from where the blockade of much of the Atlantic Seaboard of the United States was orchestrated, and the punitive expedition which included the Raid on Alexandria, the Battle of Bladensburg, and the Burning of Washington was launched in August, 1814.Morriss 1997, p. 98 In 1813, the area of command had become the North America Station again, with the West Indies falling under the Jamaica Station, and in 1816 it was renamed the North America and Lakes of Canada Station. The headquarters was initially in Bermuda during the winter and Halifax during the summer, but Admiralty House, Bermuda, became the year-round headquarters of the Station in 1821, when the area of command became the North America and Newfoundland Station. In 1818 Halifax became the summer base for the squadron which shifted to the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda, for the remainder of the year.Marilyn Gurney, The Kings Yard, Maritime Command Museum, Halifax. Admiralty House, Halifax, summer headquarters of the Admiral in command of the station In 1819, the main base of the Station was moved from Halifax to Bermuda, which was better positioned to counter threats from the United States.Gwyn, Julian, Frigates and Foremasts: The North American Squadron in Nova Scotia Waters, 1745‚Äì1815 Vancouver, BC: UBC Press (2004) .

Ian D. Stranack. Bermuda Maritime Museum Press Halifax continued to be used as the summer base for the station until 1907. The Grassy Bay anchorage seen from HMD Bermuda in 1865 At around the same time that the main base was moved the area of command was redesignated as the North America and West Indies Station, and remained so until 1907, when the North America and West Indies Station was abolished and replaced by the 4th Cruiser Squadron. These were based in England and Bermuda was redesignated from a base to a coaling station, although the dockyard remained in operation. The Commander-in-Chief, North America and West Indies Station, remained in Bermuda. The Royal Navy withdrew from Halifax in 1905, and the Halifax Naval Yard was handed over to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1910. The North America and West Indies Station was restored in 1915, and incorporated the 8th Cruiser Squadron from 1924‚Äì25. In 1942 the title of C-in-C America and West Indies was re-styled Senior British Naval Officer, Western Atlantic. In 1945 the America and West Indies title was restored. In 1951, the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda, was closed, with the Admiralty Floating Dock No. 5 towed to Britain by HM Tugs Warden and Reward, departing on 11 July. The position of Senior Naval Officer West Indies (SNOWI) was established as a Sub-Area Commander under the Commander-in-Chief of the America and West Indies station. The occupant of this position was a commodore, and was provided with a shore office on Ireland Island (which was beside the Victualling Yard until 1962), but was required to spend much of his time at sea in the West Indies. A flagship (between 1951 and April, 1956, this was successively HMS Sheffield, HMS Superb, HMS Sheffield, HMS Kenya) and other vessels of the America and West Indies Squadron continued to be based at the South Yard of the former Royal Naval Dockyard, where the Royal Navy maintained a Berthing Area under the command of a Resident Naval Officer (RNO), but were detached from the Home Fleet, and their refits and repairs were thenceforth to be carried out in Britain. The RNO had his own office in one of the houses of Dockyard Terrace. Admiralty land not required for the continued naval operations was sold to the colonial government. There was also an RNO in Nassau. Royal Naval Dockyard in the background In 1952, the Commander-in-Chief, Vice Admiral Sir William Andrewes, became the initial Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic.Sean M. Maloney, 'To Secure Command of the Sea: NATO Command Organization and Naval Planning for the Cold War at Sea, 1945‚Äì54,' MA thesis, University of New Brunswick, 1991, p.198 and Chapter 4 generally Disestablishment and successor, SNOWI On 29 October 1956, the position of Commander-in-Chief of the America and West Indies Station was abolished, leaving the Commodore West Indies as the Senior Royal Navy officer in the region, reporting directly to the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, in England. SNOWI also served as Island Commander Bermuda (ISCOMBERMUDA) in the NATO chain of command, reporting to Commander-in-Chief, Western Atlantic Area, as part of SACLANT. The ships of the command were reduced to two Station Frigates. All remaining Admiralty land, including, Admiralty House at Clarence Hill and Ireland Island, along with and War Department lands, were sold to the colonial government between 1957 and 1965. That part of the dockyard still required for naval operations remained under Admiralty control under a ninety- nine year lease, and the South Yard Berthing Area was commissioned on 1 June 1965, as , under the command of the RNO, with the headquarters of SNOWI and the RNO in Moresby House (originally built in the 1899s as the residence of the civilian Officer in Charge, Works). In December, 1967, the position of RNO Bermuda was abolished, with its duties passing to SNOWI's secretary and SNOWI taking over command of HMS Malabar. As SNOWI was frequently in the West Indies, he was unable to effectively command HMS Malabar and a Lieutenant- Commander was consequently appointed to the roles of Commanding Officer of HMS Malabar and RNO in 1971. The former Royal Naval wireless station land at Daniels Head was leased to the Royal Canadian Navy on 1 January 1963, for the purpose of a new radio station. It became CFS Daniel's Head when the Royal Canadian Navy became part of the Canadian Forces in 1969. While Bermuda had been the ideal base of operations for the North America and West Indies Station, at a thousand miles north of the Virgin Islands, it was far too distant to serve as an effective headquarters for only the West Indies. This meant that both SNOWI and the Station Frigates spent little time in or near Bermuda. On 1 April 1976, the post of SNOWI was abolished, and the Station Frigates were withdrawn. The RNO and his staff remained, and a frigate was appointed West Indies Guardship, but seldom visited Bermuda. HMS Malabar ceased to be a base and was rated only as a supply station. By 1995, when Malabar was handed over to the Government of Bermuda,Hansard: House of Commons debate on The Dependent Territories. 9 February 1994 the Royal Naval presence in the North-Western Atlantic and Caribbean had been reduced to the West Indies Guard Ship (now called Atlantic Patrol Task (North)), a role which was rotated among the frigates of the fleet, which took turns operating extended patrols of the West Indies.

He is also the creator and host of No Opportunity Wasted, which has been produced in the United States, New Zealand, and Canada. As of 2016, he has been involved with winning ten Primetime Emmy Awards related to his work on The Amazing Race, where the show consecutively won the Outstanding Reality-Competition Program seven times. Early life Keoghan was born in Lincoln, a satellite town of Christchurch, New Zealand. Due to his father's career, Keoghan spent a considerable part of his childhood in Antigua and Canada. His family had returned to Christchurch by the time he was in high school, and following that, he attended St Andrew's College, Christchurch. Television Keoghan in 2006 While completing a TV cameraman apprenticeship, he successfully auditioned for New Zealand children's show Spot On at age 19. After a series of further presenter work on television in New Zealand television, including as a reporter on That's Fairly Interesting, he, at 23, and his wife Louise left for the United States after his show Keoghan's Heroes was picked up by a U.S. network. Keoghan originally auditioned for host of Survivor. Though on its shortlist, the CBS network ultimately chose Jeff Probst for Survivor, and offered Keoghan the hosting duties for The Amazing Race. Keoghan has been host for the show from its inception and also serves as a producer. He currently has a contract extending for \\"several years\\" following The Amazing Race 18 in 2011 that will allow him to also develop other shows for CBS. In a 2002 interview, he admitted that his pay for a single episode of The Amazing Race is more than an entire year on Spot On. Shortly after the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, Keoghan visited his hometown to ensure his family was safe but also to record segments for The Early Show to implore viewers to provide aid to the New Zealand Red Cross and to promote continued tourism, a fundamental part of New Zealand's economy, to the country. At the same time, he participated in recording Air New Zealand's new safety video for its domestic jet fleet. Keoghan has hosted over 1,000 different programme episodes. In June 2010, it was announced that Keoghan would host and produce a new reality series about the Velux 5 Oceans Race. He told TMZ in 2010 that during the 10th season of The Amazing Race he was detained in Ukraine for two days until the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine intervened to free him. Keoghan hosted National Geographic Explorer starting in the show's 11th season, to start airing in 2018. According to Keoghan, he had wanted to produce for Explorer and he and his wife-to-be had even filmed and submitted a pitch tape to the show's production at that time. No Opportunity Wasted While 19 and filming for Spot On, Keoghan and a partner dived down to the shipwreck of the MS Mikhail Lermontov underwater. During filming, he was separated from his partner in the ship's ballroom and suffered a panic attack, considering it a near-death experience. He was rescued by his dive partner, and though shaken, insisted on facing his fear and returned the next day to complete filming. From then on, Keoghan set out to live his life to the fullest by accomplishing exotic goals and taking risks, creating a \\"No Opportunity Wasted\\" (NOW) list of activities he wanted to complete in his life; In his book No Opportunity Wasted, Keoghan wrote: Since then, Keoghan has broken a world bungee jumping record, gone diving in the world's longest underwater caves, eaten a meal on top of an erupting volcano, and renewed his vows underwater while feeding sharks. He was a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show, where he shared with Oprah his list of things he wants to do before he dies. Keoghan co-developed the television show No Opportunity Wasted, initially premiering in 2004, that reflected on this \\"No Opportunity Wasted\\" mantra. He also wrote a companion book, No Opportunity Wasted: 8 Ways to Create a List for the Life You Want. Cycling Keoghan is an avid cyclist. From 28 March to 9 May 2009, Keoghan performed in \\"Ride Across America\\", in partnership with several organisations including GNC, to raise money for multiple sclerosis research. Keoghan and others biked 3,500 miles from Los Angeles to New York City, averaging 100 miles per day. Keoghan stopped in 39 cities en route, attending various events and participating in casting for season 15 of The Amazing Race; the ride culminated a day before the finale of season 14. The event raised $500,000, with over $400,000 coming from in-store donations during the ride. His documentary movie The Ride about his ride across America, premiered on 3 February 2011.Noopportunitywasted.com Keoghan later came across information about Harry Watson, a New Zealand cyclist in the early 20th century that formed a team of four to become the first English- speaking team to ride in the Tour de France in 1928. Looking to celebrate Watson's legacy, Keoghan prepared to ride the same Tour de France course from 1928 (then, 22 legs at nearly compared to the modern Tour at ), using the same type of gear-less bicycle as Watson and his team used, outside of using a modern riding seat. He and his riding partner Ben Cornell completed the ride in 2013, with their progress filmed by Keoghan's wife Louise and others. The footage was assembled for another film called Le Ride, which premiered in the Isaac Theatre Royal in Christchurch at the New Zealand Film Festival in July 2016. Personal life John Keoghan, Phil's father, is an agricultural scientist involved with conservation in New Zealand. He appeared alongside his son as a Pit Stop greeter during the 13th Season of The Amazing Race when the racers stopped in New Zealand. John Keoghan and his wife run a bed and breakfast in Rolleston, New Zealand. His brother, Andrew Keoghan, was a television reporter on Television New Zealand's One News and is a successful jazz singer.

It was composed by John Williams and recorded for the film soundtrack of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace by the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) and the London Voices. This symphonic piece is played with both a full orchestra and a choir. The lyrics are based on a fragment of an archaic Welsh poem Cad Goddeu (Battle of the Trees), and sung in Sanskrit. The piece debuts during the final lightsaber duel in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace.

Composition  \\"Duel of the Fates\\" was composed by John Williams and recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) and the London Voices for the Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace film soundtrack. The symphonic piece is played with both a full orchestra and a choir. The lyrics are based on a fragment of an archaic Welsh poem Cad Goddeu (Battle of the Trees), and sung in Sanskrit. The translation was loose and Williams arranged it by ear, while rearranging the syllables, so the pronunciation of the Sanskrit isn't accurate and the meaning of the stanza is lost in the actual singing. Although Williams conducted \\"Duel of the Fates\\" to appear as a concert suite in the end credits (rather than the film), Williams did record similar cues using the ostinato motif, and in one instance, a 'cut down' version, labelled the \\"Great Duel\\". John Williams stated the chorus was introduced to give a religious, temple-like feel to the epic lightsaber duel.Movie Music DVD Special Featurette, [2001] Williams compared the setting of the battle to a pagan altar, and that the duel itself \\"seems like a dance or a ballet, a religious ceremony of some kind, probably ending in the death of one of the combatants\\".Karlin, F. & Wright, R.

For Episode I, John Williams recorded a choirless version of \\"Duel of the Fates\\", then recorded the choir performing on its own, then layered the vocals over the choirless recordings.  Appearances in Star Wars  The music had its debut during the final lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. The beginning portion used on the soundtrack is replaced with the beginning of a separate track titled Qui-Gon's Noble End; however, the full version of the original recording is used during the film's end credits. An abridged version is played in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones when Anakin Skywalker used a swoop bike to search for his mother. The piece \\"Battle of the Heroes\\", which was played in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, during the battle sequence between Yoda and Emperor Palpatine in the senate chamber on Coruscant, and the simultaneous battle between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar, had a piece of \\"Duel of the Fates\\", but rewritten in a tragic mode. Lucas had expressed in a documentary of The Phantom Menace that he wanted to use ‚ÄúDuel of the Fates‚Äù in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith as he liked the feeling of the work. However, he decided not to use it mainly because it did not match the tragic mood of the duel between Obi-Wan and Vader. ‚ÄúDuel of the Fates‚Äù makes an appearance during the Yoda/Palpatine fight scene. For this instance, John Williams re-recorded the choir and layered it over the vocal-less recording from Episode I. \\"Duel of the Fates\\" can be heard in a number of Star Wars video games, including Star Wars Episode I: Racer, The Clone Wars, Lego Star Wars, Revenge of the Sith video game, Star Wars: Empire at War, Star Wars Battlefront II, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Angry Birds Star Wars II. The theme also plays during Soulcalibur IV, whenever The Apprentice fights within either of the game's three Star Wars-themed stages, as well as during his extended ending. \\"Duel of the Fates\\" also plays when Darth Maul appears during the Jedi Training Academy show featured at Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disneyland. A special of Lego Star Wars called \\"The Empire Strikes Out\\" features a short section of ‚ÄúDuel of the Fates‚Äù, in which Darth Maul hums along with the music while declaring how \\"awesome\\" he is. Another Lego Star Wars special, entitled The Yoda Chronicles: Menace of the Sith, also featured ‚ÄúDuel of the Fates‚Äù. Count Dooku plays the music on a radio during a demonstration of the Sith clone Jek-14's power. Darth Maul complains that ‚ÄúDuel of the Fates‚Äù is his theme song, to which Asajj Ventress replies \\"Can somebody say diva?\\". It also appears in the second season of Star Wars: Rebels in the episode \\"The Future of the Force\\" when Ahsoka Tano confronts Imperial Inquisitors Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother. \\"Duel of the Fates\\" can also be heard softly in the background when Maul appears in Solo: A Star Wars Story. \\"Duel of the Fates\\" is not heard in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. However, it is present in one TV spot titled \\"Duel\\", mixed in with \\"The Imperial March\\". Additionally, \\"Duel of the Fates\\" would be the title of the ninth movie, before The Rise of Skywalker was chosen. A reorganised version of the song can be heard in The Clone Wars episode \\"The Phantom Apprentice\\" while the characters Ahsoka Tano and Maul duel.  Reception  Despite only being slightly used in the film The Phantom Menace, the theme \\"Duel of the Fates\\" has gone on to define the music of the prequel trilogy. It was so loved by fans and viewed as a redeeming quality of the first film, that it went on to be blended into the theme \\"Battle of the Heroes\\" in Revenge of the Sith. = Use outside of Star Wars = \\"Duel of the Fates\\" has also been used to reference and satirize Star Wars. For instance, in The Simpsons episode \\"Please Homer, Don't Hammer 'Em\\", the song plays in a sequence parodying Star Wars, during an allergen-stick battle between Bart Simpson and Seymour Skinner. The song was also used as the theme for the 2003 Broadcast of the Drum Corps International World Championships on PBS. \\"Duel of the Fates\\" was used in the original BBC broadcast of Top Gear Series 9 Episode 2 in 2007, during the segment in which host James May drives a Bugatti Veyron to its top speed at the Volkswagen test track at Ehra-Lessien. The song was used in series 4, episode 4 of the British obstacle-based gameshow Total Wipeout when the three finalists were interviewed near the end.shorturl.at/cBDGN Tottenham Hotspur F.C. uses \\"Duel of the Fates\\" to announce the appearance of the players from the tunnel. J.P. Anderson's band Rabbit Junk used a sample of \\"Duel of the Fates\\" in the song \\"Demons\\", which appears on the album Reframe. The Boston Pops performed the piece as the Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins entered Gillette Stadium for the 2016 NHL Winter Classic. The YouTube channel Element Animation included a villager-sung version of the song called \\"Daladas of the Fates\\" in their Villager News animation.

She was named after El Paso, a city situated in Western Texas and along the border with New Mexico and the Mexican state of Chihuahua. El Paso was launched on 16 July 1943 at Consolidated Steel Corporation, Ltd., in Wilmington, California, under a Maritime Commission contract, sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Kaster; and commissioned on 1 December 1943, with Commander R. J. Borromey, USCG, in command. Service history Sailing from San Diego, California, on 20 February 1944, El Paso arrived at Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 4 April after training at Pearl Harbor and convoy escort duty to the Gilberts and Espiritu Santo en route. The frigate patrolled in the New Guinea area, and carried out several bombardment missions. On 25 May she shelled enemy positions at Maffin Bay, and 2 days later in company with two destroyer escorts, bombarded Wakde Island. On the night of 14 June she provided fire support at Aitape, and on the 25th blasted the edge of the airfield on Wakde Island. The next mission was a combination scouting, salvage, and rescue work at Pagan and Fanildo Islands on 25 August. In September 1944, El Paso joined the screen of the forces landing at Morotai, then operated between this newly won base and New Guinea during the buildup for the invasion of the Philippines. On 29 October, nine days after the initial landings, El Paso arrived at Leyte for patrol and screen duty. She returned to New Guinea in November to bombard Sarmi Point and Mount Makko on the 11th, then was assigned to escort duty between New Guinea and the Philippines until the year's end. El Paso departed Humboldt Bay (Hollandia) on 6 January 1945, and sailed to New York for overhaul during which she was converted to a weather ship. Her conversion was interrupted by a convoy escort voyage to Oran, Algeria, in April and May 1945. When World War II ended, the frigate was on the way back to the Pacific, and arriving at Leyte on 23 September, served as a weather station ship in the Philippines until 16 April 1946. She returned to the west coast, was decommissioned at Seattle, Washington, on 18 July 1946, and sold on 14 October 1947. El Paso received Five battle stars for World War II service.

He is the official deputy to the Lord High Admiral, an honorary (although once operational) office vested in the Sovereign from 1964 to 2011 and currently held by the Duke of Edinburgh. He is appointed by the Sovereign on the nomination of the First Sea Lord. History The office was originally created on 25 April 1513, by Tudor King Henry VIII. The office holder served as the deputy of the Lord High Admiral from April 1546 when the incumbent jointly held the title of Lieutenant of the Admiralty, though not always simultaneously. From 1557 to 1558 Vice-Admiral Sir John Clere of Ormesby, Kt. was appointed Vice-Admiral of England by patent but not appointed Lieutenant of the Admiralty. The post was in abeyance until 1661; from then on, appointments became more regular and in 1672 the two separate distinct offices were amalgamated into one unified office, though both titles remained. The responsibilities of the pre-1964 Board of Admiralty would, in theory, have devolved upon the Vice-Admiral had the entire Board been incapacitated before a new Commission of Admiralty could pass the Great Seal. However, such a contingency never occurred in practice. In former days, the Vice-Admiral of England (or Vice-Admiral of Great Britain following the 1707 union with Scotland) was the second most powerful position in the Royal Navy, and until 1801 was officially called the Lieutenant of the Admiralty. Below the office of Vice-Admiral ranks the Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom, another now honorary office.

Derwin began his career on Days of Our Lives in 1987 with a minor role as Jeremiah Brown. In 1988, Derwin appeared in the role of Adrian Hunter on The Young and the Restless. Derwin was featured in a high-profile storyline: the elaborate George Rawlins murder mystery as the scheming psychotic serial killer. Derwin is also known for numerous other soap opera roles. From 2008-2013 Derwin was a lead on the ABC Family teen drama the Secret Life of the American Teenager as George Juergens, a furniture store owner married to Molly Ringwald's character Ann, and the father of the main character Amy played by Shailene Woodley. The main plot of the show is Derwin's character's 15-year old daughter having a child after a one night stand at a summer band camp and the developments this event has on those around her. Biography Derwin attended the State University of New York at Cobleskill, but was kicked out after one semester. He briefly worked at IBM and worked a series of odd jobs before moving to Los Angeles. After recurring roles on the shows Hardball and Days of Our Lives, and a prolific career in commercials (including a notable spot as the \\"Fiesta\\" cigarette man in Mexico), Derwin was cast in his first contract role as Adrian Hunter on the daytime soap opera The Young and the Restless. Derwin was on the show from 1989 to 1990, and was featured in a high-profile storyline as a grifter and, ultimately, a murderer.Soap Opera Digest interview with Mark Derwin His next role was on the long-running soap opera Guiding Light as detective A.C. Mallet. Derwin played the character from 1990 to 1993. During his time there, the role of Mallet became a leading character. Derwin became romantically involved with costar Beth Ehlers during his stint at GL; the couple decided to leave the show together in 1993. (Derwin and Ehlers subsequently broke up.) Derwin returned to daytime television in the role of Dr. Ben Davidson on the ABC soap opera One Life to Live (1999‚Äì2002, 2004, 2008). He was again paired in a high-profile leading role, this time as the love interest of the show's star, Erika Slezak. His character was eventually discovered to be the son of show patriarch Asa Buchanan. Derwin co-starred alongside Bonnie Hunt in the non-traditional primetime sitcom, Life with Bonnie, which was partly improvised. He recently was seen in the teen comedy Accepted (2006), playing the father of protagonist Bartleby Gaines (played by Justin Long). In 2006, 2007 and 2014, he was seen on How I Met Your Mother, playing Greg. Derwin also played George Juergens on the ABC Family TV show The Secret Life of the American Teenager from 2008 to 2013. In 2008, he appeared on the show Chuck on the episode \\"Chuck Versus the Marlin\\" where he played Detective Conway. In 2009 he had a recurring role on season 7 of 24 as Secretary of State Joe Stevens, a member of President Allison Taylor's (played by Cherry Jones) Cabinet.

G. Collingwood R√≠gs√æula or R√≠gsm√°l (Old Norse: 'The Lay of R√≠g') is an Eddic poem, preserved in the manuscript (AM 242 fol, the Codex Wormianus), in which a Norse god named R√≠g or R√≠gr, described as \\"old and wise, mighty and strong,\\", fathers the classes of mankind. The prose introduction states that R√≠gr is another name for Heimdall, who is also called the father of mankind in V√∂lusp√°. However, there seems to be some confusion of Heimdall and Odinn, see below. In R√≠gs√æula, Rig wanders through the world and fathers the progenitors of the three classes of human beings as conceived by the poet. The youngest of these sons inherits the name or title \\"R√≠g\\" and so in turn does his youngest son, Kon the Young or Kon ungr (, king). This third R√≠g was the first true king and the ultimate founder of the state of royalty as appears in the R√≠gs√æula and in two other associated works. In all three sources he is connected with two primordial Danish rulers named Dan and Dan√æ√≠r. The poem R√≠gs√æula is preserved incomplete on the last surviving sheet in the 14th-century Codex Wormianus, following Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda.Karl G. Johansson, \\"R√≠gs√æula och Codex Wormianus: Textens funktion ur ett kompilationsperspektiv,\\" Alv√≠ssm√°l 8 (1998) 67‚Äì84 (pdf) (English summary, p. 84). A short prose introduction explains that the god in question was Heimdall, who wandered along the seashore until he came to a farm where he called himself R√≠g. The name R√≠gr appears to be the oblique case of Old Irish r√≠, r√≠g \\"king\\", cognate to Latin rex, Sanskrit rajan.Rudolf Simek, trans. Angela Hall, Dictionary of Northern Mythology, Cambridge: Brewer, 1993, repr. 2000, , p. 264. and Gothic reiks.Joseph Wright, Grammar of the Gothic Language, Oxford: Clarendon, 1910, OCLC 162196350, p. 340. The identification of R√≠gr with Heimdall is supported by his characterization as an ancestor, or kinsman, of humankind in the first two lines of the Eddic poem V√∂lusp√°:' :I ask for a hearing :of all the holy races :Greater and lesser :kinsmen of Heimdall However, some scholars, including Finnur J√≥nsson and Rudolf Simek, have suggested this is a role more appropriate to √ì√∞inn and that the Eddic tradition has thus transferred the name R√≠gr from him to Heimdall.Jan de Vries, Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte Volume 2, 2nd ed. Berlin: de Gruyter, 1957, repr. 1970, p. 243 Since R√≠gs√æula is only preserved in a 14th-century manuscript, it is also plausible that the prose introduction was added by the compiler to conform it to the opening of V√∂lusp√°.  Synopsis  \\"Heimdall in Rig's shape\\" by Carl Larsson R√≠gr was walking along the shore and came to a farm-hut owned by √Åi (great-grandfather) and Edda (great- grandmother). They offered him shelter and poor, rough food for a meal. That night R√≠gr slept between the pair in their bed and then departed. Nine months later, Edda gave birth to a son who was svartan (swarthy, dark). They named him √ûr√¶ll (thrall, serf, or slave). √ûr√¶ll grew up strong but ugly. He married a woman named Th√≠r (slave girl or bondswoman), and they had twelve sons and nine daughters with names mostly suggesting ugliness and squatness. They became the race of serfs. Traveling further, R√≠gr came across a pleasant house where a farmer/craftsman, Afi (grandfather), lived with his wife Amma (grandmother). This couple gave him good food and also let him sleep between them. Nine months later, a son, Karl (churl or freeman), was born, who had a ruddy complexion. Karl married a woman named Sn√∂r or Sn≈ìr (daughter-in-law; sometimes anglicized as Snor), and they had twelve sons and ten daughters with names mostly suggesting a neat appearance or being of good quality. One of the names is smi√∞r (smith). These became the ancestors of free farmers, craftsmen and herdsmen. Traveling further, R√≠gr came to a mansion inhabited by Fa√∞ir (Father) and M√≥√∞ir (Mother). They gave him excellent food served splendidly and, nine months later, M√≥√∞ir gave birth to a beautiful baby named Jarl (earl or noble), whose hair was blond and who was bleikr (bright white in color). When Jarl grew up and began to handle weapons and to use hawks, hounds, and horses, R√≠gr reappeared, claimed him as his son, gave him his own name of R√≠gr, made him his heir, taught him runes, and advised him to seek lordship. Through warfare Jarl became lord of eighteen homesteads with much wealth besides. He also gained the hand of Erna (Brisk), daughter of Hersir (lord). Erna bore twelve sons to R√≠g-Jarl but no daughters. All the sons were given high-sounding names, mostly meaning \\"son\\". They became the ancestors of the warrior nobility. The youngest son, named Konr, was the best of them. He alone learned rune-craft as well as other magic and was able to understand the speech of birds, to quench fire, and to heal minds. He also had the strength of eight normal men. His name was Konr the young (Konr ungr in Old Norse), the name and title to be understood as the origin of the Norse word konungr (king). Konr, like his father, also acquired the name or title of R√≠gr. \\"The Crow warns Konr\\" (1908) by W. G. Collingwood One day, when Konr the young was riding through the forest hunting and snaring birds, a crow spoke to him and suggested he would win more if he stopped hunting mere birds and rode to battle against foemen, that he should seek the halls of Dan and Dan√æ√≠r, who were wealthier than he. At that point the poem abruptly cuts off.  Historical significance  A key aspect of historical scholarship on this poem is that theories of date and provenance range from the tenth to the thirteenth century and from the Old Norse-Icelandic-speaking areas of the British Isles to Norway. Initially it was viewed as an ancient poem; later research postulated that it came from the thirteenth century, but some modern scholars continue to place it as early as the Viking Age.Stefan Brink and Neil S. Price, The Viking World. London: Routledge, 2008. Additionally, the dating problem is complicated by the poem's history of oral transmission, which tends to warp pieces as long as the R√≠gs√æula as they are recited numerous times.Frederic Amory, \\"The Historical Worth of R√≠gs√æula.\\" Alv√≠ssm√°l 10 (2001): 3-20. In terms of provenance, although there has been some speculation in the past as to Celtic authorship of the poem, the modern consensus is to ascribe Icelandic authorship to it. The historical significance of the poem would necessarily change based on where in history the text itself is situated. However, the general consensus is that the poem is from Viking times and can be read as descriptive of those times: \\"The political setting of the poem has already drawn it out of the realms of fancy upon historical ground; and in its details, the description of the customs and manner of life among the different classes, it is most valuable.\\"Olive Bray trans. The Elder or Poetic Edda, Commonly Known as S√¶mund's Edda. Vol. 2. London: Viking Club, 1908 There is of course a need to remember the literary nature of the poem when reading it as a historical source as certain aspects do not translate literally and must be read allegorically and stereotypically. For example, despite the explicit and detailed physical differences between the classes in the poem, slaves, freeman, and aristocrats did not necessarily look different.Thomas D. Hill, ‚ÄúR√≠gs√æula: Some Medieval Christian Analogues.‚Äù Speculum 61.1 (1986): 79-89. Thus although qualitative aspects of the social classes are difficult to determine from the text, there is broader understanding that can be gained. Firstly, the poem presents a view of √ûr√¶ll in line with certain slave tropes found throughout Old Norse literature, as dark, short, stupid, gloomy and ugly. √ûr√¶ll and his aged parents live as tenants in one farmhouse and he and his sons engage largely in menial labor such as keeping the household in firewood and cutting turf. Although his working status is indeterminate, the field work in particular is fairly typical of the kind of services that slaves would render to a master in the Old Norse world. Thus, the use of slave tropes and the focus on labor can be read as descriptive of the typical lifestyle of the lower class, whether slaves or simply lower-class laborers. The middle class of freemen, who are descended from Karl, are less easy to pin down, but the scholarly consensus seems to be that Karl ‚Ä≥represents the class of free- born peasant proprietor called ‚Ä≤bondi‚Ä≤ or ‚Ä≤bui,‚Ä≤ ... a kind of hereditary aristocracy, self-governed, and absolutely independent.‚Ä≥ Specifically, Karl is described as fairly prosperous, given that he and his family are landed proprietors or freeholders who own the farm building on the land they work. Additional details reveal the relative comfort of his life: his mother, Amma‚Äôs stylish shoulder ornaments and the free distribution of gold rings to the guests at his wedding. Karl therefore represents a class who, while they are farmers, are able to maintain a comfortable life with material pleasures and luxuries. Finally we are presented with the class of Jarl or earl, who represents ‚Ä≥the idle aristocrat ... whose sole occupations are raiding, hunting, and swimming.‚Ä≥ Born to parents who live in even more luxury than those of Karl, Jarl has bright eyes and shining hair and he lives a life of success, able to conquer and distribute his spoils to his dependents very much in the style of ancient Viking heroes. The poem also presents Konr as representative of the special class of kings and in examining what his character represents, scholar Thomas Hill's view was: > Although the poem is concerned with the origins of kingship, it seems to > reflect a specifically aristocratic rather than royalist view, in that the > king who begins to emerge in the final stanzas of the poem is not set apart > by birth from the other sons of Jarl, and is in fact the youngest son. In fact, Konr gets his power directly from R√≠g, and the idea of a king is therefore of a man who is blessed by the gods, though not necessarily descended from them in the strict patrilineal fashion typical of Western monarchies. Given the very different ways in which these three classes are represented both physically and in terms of their activities, the etiological myth of R√≠gs√æula can be seen as implying that the three classes are essentially different species. A second interpretation, however, is that ‚Ä≥the names of the three couples - great-grandfather and great-grandmother, grandfather and grandmother, and finally father and mother - might seem to imply that the various classes of mankind share a common heritage.‚Ä≥ The poem has been viewed as suggestive of social progress over time, so that one class may aspire to move up. According to Hill, however, most agree that this second view is too benevolent and that in fact the poem reveals that for the Vikings: > The different orders of mankind are indeed fixed and unchangeable, but in > the very beginning there was a certain kinship between the different orders > of mankind, a kinship suggested by the fixed and yet linked sequence of the > genealogical chain.  Theories  A marriage by Konr the young into the family of Dan and Dan√æ√≠r seems to be where the tale was headed, as seen in the two other sources that mention this R√≠gr. According to Arngr√≠mur J√≥nsson's Latin epitome of the lost Skj√∂ldungasaga: > R√≠g (Rigus) was a man not the least among the great ones of his time. He > married the daughter of a certain Dan√æ√≠r, lord of Danpsted, whose name was > Dana; and later, having won the royal title for his province, left as his > heir his son by Dana, called Dan or Danum, all of whose subjects were called > Danes. The other tradition appears in chapter 20 of the Ynglinga Saga section of Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla. The story speaks of King Dygvi of Sweden: > Dygvi's mother was Dr√≥tt, a daughter of King Dan√æ√≠r, the son of R√≠g, who was > first called konungr in the Danish tongue. His descendants always afterwards > considered the title of konungr the title of highest dignity. Dygvi was the > first of his family to be called konungr, for his predecessors had been > called dr√≥ttinn [chieftain], and their wives dr√≥ttning, and their court > dr√≥tt (war band). Each of their race was called Yngvi, or Ynguni, and the > whole race together Ynglingar. Queen Dr√≥tt was a sister of King Dan > Mikillati, from whom Denmark took its name. Despite genealogical discrepancies (to be evaded only by imagining more than one Dan√æ√≠r and more than one Dan) the accounts relate a common tradition about the origin of the title konungr (king). Konr the young, whose magical abilities are so emphasized, is as much a magician as a warrior: a magician king, perhaps a sacred king. Dum√©zil pointed out that Kon alone represents the supernatural function, represented by the Brahmin caste in India, the flamen function in Rome, the druids in some Celtic cultures, and the clergy in the three estates of medieval Europe. Instead of the three estates of clergy/priest, warrior, and commoner, with serfs outside the system, the R√≠gs√æula presents three estates or castes in which the clergy/priest class has been subsumed within the warrior class and identified with royalty.Georges Dum√©zil, \\"The R√≠gs√æula and Indo-European Social Structure (1958)\\", trans. John Lindow, in Gods of the Ancient Northmen, Ed. Einar Haugen, Publications of the UCLA Center for the Study of Comparative Folklore and Mythology 3, Berkeley: University of California, 1973, , pp. 118-25. Also, although in Rome and India the color white is assigned to the sacred and to priests and red to warriors, here the noble warrior is white in color while the red coloration is ascribed instead to the commoner in place of the green, blue, or yellow color assigned to the lower classes in other cultures associated with Proto-Indo-European society. Dum√©zil saw this as a Germanic adaptation of the Indo-European heritage.Dum√©zil, pp. 124-25\\\\.

Usually human evaluation is necessary when the form of fitness function is not known (for example, visual appeal or attractiveness; as in Dawkins, 1986) or the result of optimization should fit a particular user preference (for example, taste of coffee or color set of the user interface). IEC design issues The number of evaluations that IEC can receive from one human user is limited by user fatigue which was reported by many researchers as a major problem. In addition, human evaluations are slow and expensive as compared to fitness function computation. Hence, one-user IEC methods should be designed to converge using a small number of evaluations, which necessarily implies very small populations. Several methods were proposed by researchers to speed up convergence, like interactive constrain evolutionary search (user intervention) or fitting user preferences using a convex function. IEC human- computer interfaces should be carefully designed in order to reduce user fatigue. There is also evidence that the addition of computational agents can successfully counteract user fatigue. However IEC implementations that can concurrently accept evaluations from many users overcome the limitations described above. An example of this approach is an interactive media installation by Karl Sims that allows one to accept preferences from many visitors by using floor sensors to evolve attractive 3D animated forms. Some of these multi-user IEC implementations serve as collaboration tools, for example HBGA. IEC types IEC methods include interactive evolution strategy,Herdy, M.

History Benjamin Zander was born in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, England. His parents had emigrated from Berlin in 1937 to escape the Nazis, and raised their four children: Michael, Luke, Angelica, and Benjamin. At home, his father would regularly sing and play piano after work. Benjamin Zander started to compose music at the age of nine. Several of his compositions came to the attention of composer Benjamin Britten, who invited the Zander family to spend three summers in Aldeburgh, England, the beautiful seaside town in Suffolk where he lived. Benjamin Zander took lessons with Benjamin Britten and became a student of theory of Britten's amanuensis and assistant, Imogen Holst. =Early life= Zander's main instrument was the cello. He began studying at the age of ten and became the youngest member of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain at the age of twelve. He went as a boarder at Uppingham, as a music scholar at the age of thirteen and thence attended St. Paul's School in London so he could continue his cello studies with Herbert Withers. At the age of fifteen, Zander became a student of the Spanish cello virtuoso Gaspar Cassad√≥ and moved to Florence and Siena, Italy for the next three years. He completed his cello studies at the State Conservatoire in Cologne, Germany where he served as an assistant to Cassad√≥. After living abroad for five years, Zander returned to England, completed his A levels and studied at University College London for a degree in English Literature, winning the University-wide English Literature Essay Prize. During his period of study at University, he performed regularly as a cellist, giving recitals and chamber music concerts with the King-Zander-Arieli Trio and he taught at the Yehudi Menuhin School for gifted children. In 1965, he won a Harkness International Fellowship and travelled to the United States for graduate work at Brandeis University, Harvard University and with Leonard Shure and Ernst Oster in New York. =New England Conservatory= In 1967, Zander joined the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music and remained on the faculty until 2012. In July 2012 the New England Conservatory and Preparatory School conferred on him the title of Faculty Emeritus, acknowledging his significant contributions to the school over 45 years.\\"After discord, harmonious encore for Benjamin Zander\\" Geoff Edgers, \\"Boston Globe\\" and boston.com, 14 November 2012 This followed his being fired in January 2012 for negligence amid allegations he had hired a videographer to record concerts, who had (with Zander's knowledge) previously served a prison sentence for sexual assault of a minor.\\"'This is a nightmare for all of us,'\\" Geoff Edgers, [Boston Globe and boston.com, 5 February 2012. Zander later acknowledged that hiring the videographer, Peter Benjamin, without informing school administrators was a \\"significant oversight.\\" =Boston Philharmonic= Benjamin Zander is the Conductor and Music Director of the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, a youth orchestra in Boston comprising both high school and college age students. The BPYO rehearses at The Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology in Boston's South End. Their premiere performance took place in Symphony Hall on 25 November 2012. On the program was Strauss' Ein Heldenleben, Beethoven's Egmont Overture, and Elgar's Cello Concerto with Alisa Weilerstein as soloist. BPYO's first international tour took place the summer of 2013 as the entire orchestra visited The Netherlands to play Mahler's Second Symphony in the Concertgebouw. Personal life Benjamin and Patricia Zander were married in 1966 and their daughter Jessica was born a few years later.

The nitro group is one of the most common explosophores (functional group that makes a compound explosive) used globally. The nitro group is also strongly electron- withdrawing. Because of this property, C‚àíH bonds alpha (adjacent) to the nitro group can be acidic. For similar reasons, the presence of nitro groups in aromatic compounds retards electrophilic aromatic substitution but facilitates nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Nitro groups are rarely found in nature, being almost invariably produced by nitration reactions starting with nitric acid. Synthesis =Preparation of aromatic nitro compounds = Aromatic nitro compounds are typically synthesized by nitration. Nitration is achieved using a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid, which produce the nitronium ion (), which the electrophile: Benzene + Nitronium ion Nitrobenzene The nitration product produced on the largest scale, by far, is nitrobenzene. Many explosives are produced by nitration including trinitrophenol (picric acid), trinitrotoluene (TNT), and trinitroresorcinol (styphnic acid). Another but more specialized method for making aryl‚ÄìNO2 group starts from halogenated phenols, is the Zinke nitration. =Preparation of aliphatic nitro compounds = Aliphatic nitro compounds can be synthesized by various methods; notable examples include: *Free radical nitration of alkanes. The reaction produces fragments from the parent alkane, creating a diverse mixture of products; for instance, nitromethane, nitroethane, 1-nitropropane, and 2-nitropropane are produced by treating propane with nitric acid in the gas phase (e.g. 350‚Äì450 ¬∞C and 8‚Äì12 atm). *Nucleophilic substitution reactions between halocarbons or organosulfates with silver or alkali nitrite salts. Structural details of nitrobenzene, distances in picometers. *Nitromethane can be produced in the laboratory by treating sodium chloroacetate with sodium nitrite. *Oxidation of oximes or primary amines. *Reduction of Œ≤-nitro alcohols or nitroalkenes. * By decarboxylation of Œ±-nitro carboxylic acids formed from nitriles and ethyl nitrate. Ter Meer Reaction In nucleophilic aliphatic substitution, sodium nitrite (NaNO2) replaces an alkyl halide. In the so-called Ter Meer reaction (1876) named after Edmund ter Meer, the reactant is a 1,1-halonitroalkane: :The ter Meer reaction The reaction mechanism is proposed in which in the first slow step a proton is abstracted from nitroalkane 1 to a carbanion 2 followed by protonation to an aci-nitro 3 and finally nucleophilic displacement of chlorine based on an experimentally observed hydrogen kinetic isotope effect of 3.3. When the same reactant is reacted with potassium hydroxide the reaction product is the 1,2-dinitro dimer.3-Hexene, 3,4-dinitro- D. E. Bisgrove, J. F. Brown, Jr., and L. B.

Rohwer, Volker Bittrich \\"Flowering Plants ¬∑ Dicotyledons: Magnoliid, Hamamelid and Caryophyllid Families\\" 1993, Springer-Verlag, Berlin = In pharmaceuticals = Despite the occasional use in pharmaceuticals, the nitro group is associated with mutagenicity and genotoxicity and therefore is often regarded as a liability in the drug discovery process.  Reactions of aliphatic nitro compounds =Reduction= Nitro compounds participate in several organic reactions, the most important being their reduction to the corresponding amines: :RNO2 \\\\+ 3 H2 ‚Üí RNH2 \\\\+ 2 H2O =Acid-base reactions= The Œ±-carbon of nitroalkanes is somewhat acidic. The pKa values of nitromethane and 2-nitropropane are respectively 17.2 and 16.9 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution. These values suggest an aqueous pKa of around 11. In other words, these carbon acids can be deprotonated in aqueous solution. The conjugate base is called a nitronate, they are formed as intermediates in the nitroaldol reaction and Nef reactions. =Condensation reactions= Nitromethane undergoes base-catalyzed additions to aldehydes in 1,2-addition in the nitroaldol reaction. Similarly, it adds to alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compounds as a 1,4-addition in the Michael reaction as a Michael donor. Nitroalkenes are Michael acceptors in the Michael reaction with enolate compounds. =Biochemical reactions= Many flavin-dependent enzymes are capable of oxidizing aliphatic nitro compounds to less-toxic aldehydes and ketones. Nitroalkane oxidase and 3-nitropropionate oxidase oxidize aliphatic nitro compounds exclusively, whereas other enzymes such as glucose oxidase have other physiological substrates. Reactions of aromatic nitro compounds  Reduction of aromatic nitro compounds with hydrogen over metal catalysts gives anilines. Virtually all aromatic amines (anilines) are derived from nitroaromatics. A variation is formation of a dimethylaminoarene with palladium on carbon and formaldehyde:Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 5, p.552 (1973); Vol. 47, p.69 (1967). http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV5P0552.pdf :Nitro compound hydrogenation The Leimgruber‚ÄìBatcho, Bartoli and Baeyer‚ÄìEmmerling indole syntheses begin with aromatic nitro compounds. Indigo can be synthesized in a condensation reaction from ortho-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone in strongly basic conditions in a reaction known as the Baeyer‚ÄìDrewson indigo synthesis. =Explosions= Explosive decomposition of organo nitro compounds are redox reactions, wherein both the oxidant (nitro group) and the fuel (hydrocarbon substituent) are bound within the same molecule. The explosion process generates heat by forming highly stable products including molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide, and water. The explosive power of this redox reaction is enhanced because these stable products are gases at mild temperatures. Many contact explosives contain the nitro group.

Sinusoidal zone plate: This type has a single focal point. A zone plate is a device used to focus light or other things exhibiting wave character.G. W. Webb, I. V. Minin and O. V. Minin, ‚ÄúVariable Reference Phase in Diffractive Antennas‚Äù, IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, vol. 53, no. 2, April. 2011, pp. 77-94. Unlike lenses or curved mirrors, zone plates use diffraction instead of refraction or reflection. Based on analysis by French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel, they are sometimes called Fresnel zone plates in his honor. The zone plate's focusing ability is an extension of the Arago spot phenomenon caused by diffraction from an opaque disc. A zone plate consists of a set of concentric rings, known as Fresnel zones, which alternate between being opaque and transparent. Light hitting the zone plate will diffract around the opaque zones. The zones can be spaced so that the diffracted light constructively interferes at the desired focus, creating an image there. Design and manufacture To get constructive interference at the focus, the zones should switch from opaque to transparent at radii where :r_n = \\\\sqrt{n\\\\lambda f + \\\\frac{1}{4}n^2 \\\\lambda^2} where n is an integer, Œª is the wavelength of the light the zone plate is meant to focus and f is the distance from the center of the zone plate to the focus. When the zone plate is small compared to the focal length, this can be approximated as :r_n \\\\simeq \\\\sqrt{n\\\\lambda f}. For plates with many zones, you can calculate the distance to the focus if you only know the radius of the outermost zone, rN, and its width, ŒîrN: :f = \\\\frac{2r_N \\\\Delta r_N}{\\\\lambda} In the long focal length limit, the area of each zone is equal, because the width of the zones must decrease farther from the center. The maximum possible resolution of a zone plate depends on the smallest zone width, :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta l}{\\\\Delta r_N} \\\\approx 1.22 Because of this, the smallest size object you can image, Œîl, is limited by how small you can reliably make your zones. Zone plates are frequently manufactured using lithography. As lithography technology improves and the size of features that can be manufactured decreases, the possible resolution of zone plates manufactured with this technique can improve. = Continuous zone plates = Unlike a standard lens, a binary zone plate produces intensity maxima along the axis of the plate at odd fractions (f/3, f/5, f/7, etc.). Although these contain less energy (counts of the spot) than the principal focus (because it is wider), they have the same maximum intensity (counts/m). However, if the zone plate is constructed so that the opacity varies in a gradual, sinusoidal manner, the resulting diffraction causes only a single focal point to be formed. This type of zone plate pattern is the equivalent of a transmission hologram of a converging lens. For a smooth zone plate, the opacity (or transparency) at a point can be given by: :\\\\frac{1 \\\\pm \\\\cos\\\\left(kr^2\\\\right)}{2}\\\\, where r is the distance from the plate center, and k determines the plate's scale. Binary zone plates use almost the same formula, however they depend only on the sign: :\\\\frac{1 \\\\pm \\\\sgn\\\\left(\\\\cos\\\\left(kr^2\\\\right)\\\\right)}{2}\\\\, = Free parameter = It does not matter to the constructive interference what the absolute phase is, but only that it is the same from each ring. So an arbitrary length can be added to all the paths :r_n = \\\\sqrt{(n + \\\\alpha)\\\\lambda f + \\\\frac{1}{4}(n + \\\\alpha)^2 \\\\lambda^2} This reference phase can be chosen to optimize secondary properties such as side lobes. Applications =Physics= There are many wavelengths of light outside of the visible area of the electromagnetic spectrum where traditional lens materials like glass are not transparent, and so lenses are more difficult to manufacture. Likewise, there are many wavelengths for which there are no materials with a refractive index significantly larger than one. X-rays, for example, are only weakly refracted by glass or other materials, and so require a different technique for focusing. Zone plates eliminate the need for finding transparent, refractive, easy-to-manufacture materials for every region of the spectrum. The same zone plate will focus light of many wavelengths to different foci, which means they can also be used to filter out unwanted wavelengths while focusing the light of interest. Other waves such as sound waves and, due to quantum mechanics, matter waves can be focused in the same way. Wave plates have been used to focus beams of neutrons and helium atoms. =Photography= Example of an image taken with zone plate optics. Zone plates are also used in photography in place of a lens or pinhole for a glowing, soft-focus image. One advantage over pinholes (aside from the unique, fuzzy look achieved with zone plates) is that the transparent area is larger than that of a comparable pinhole. The result is that the effective f-number of a zone plate is lower than for the corresponding pinhole and the exposure time can be decreased. Common f-numbers for a pinhole camera range from to or higher, whereas zone plates are frequently and lower. This makes hand held shots feasible at the higher ISO settings available with newer DSLR cameras. =Gunsights= Zone plates have been proposed as a cheap alternative to more expensive optical sights or targeting lasers.New INL gunsight technology should improve accuracy for target shooters, hunters, soldiers, Mike Wall, Idaho National Laboratory, 5 May 2010. =Lenses= Zone plates may be used as imaging lenses with a single focus as long as the type of grating used is sinusoidal in nature. =Reflection= A zone plate used as a reflector will allow radio waves to be focused as if by a parabolic reflector. This allows the reflector to be flat, and so easier to make. It also allows an appropriately patterned Fresnel reflector to be mounted flush to the side of a building, avoiding the wind loading that a parabaloid would be subject to. =Software testing= A bitmap representation of a zone plate image may be used for testing various image processing algorithms, such as: * Image interpolation and image resampling;https://web.archive.org/web/20060827184031/http://www.path.unimelb.edu.au/~dersch/interpolator/interpolator.html Testing Interpolator Quality * Image filtering.http://blogs.mathworks.com/steve/2011/07/22/filtering-fun/ Filtering Fun - Matlab Central An open-source zone-plate image generator is available.https://web.archive.org/web/20200516104605/http://www.realitypixels.com/turk/opensource/#ZonePlate Zone Plate generator, C code.

He is a right arm fast medium bowler. He announced his retirement from first-class and List A cricket in November 2016. He is currently the bowling coach for Chennai Super Kings, his former side in the Indian Premier League. Personal life Lakshmipathy Balaji was born on 27 September 1981 in Pollachi, Tamil Nadu. He is currently working in star sports Tamil channel International cricket Balaji became a member of the Indian cricket team as Fast Medium bowler in 2003. Playing for his state team since 2001, he made his Test debut against New Zealand at Ahmedabad in 2003. He was recognised after his performance in the 2004 India Pakistan series. In that series, he played a significant part in Indian team's historic victories.'What we thought about Pakistan was wrong' But after an injury, his international cricket career was put on hold. He made a comeback in Pakistan's 2005 tour of India, taking 5 wickets in the first innings. Injury kept him out of cricket for the next 3 years. Balaji made his return to domestic cricket in 2007. After a strong 2008 domestic season where Balaji was instrumental in helping Tamil Nadu reach the Ranji Trophy semifinals, Balaji was called up to the international squad in January 2009 to replace an injured Munaf Patel who sustained a groin injury.'Balaji replaces injured Munaf for SL tour' Balaji was included in the playing XI for the final match of the series against Sri Lanka.'India Versus Sri Lanka 2009 5th ODI Scorecard' India went on to lose the match. Balaji was rested for the subsequent Twenty20 match. In February the BCCI announced that Balaji had been dropped from the ODI squad to tour New Zealand but had been selected for the test squad.'Dhawal Kulkarni receives maiden call-up' Thus marking Balaji's return to the test squad after a five- year hiatus having last been part of the test squad in the 2004 series against Pakistan. On 18 July 2012 he was included in 30 probables for the World T20 tournament to be played in Sri Lanka in September 2012. Subsequently he was selected in the final 15-member squad. He made his comeback into the Indian side in the second T20 International against New Zealand at his home ground- Chennai. Indian Premier League Balaji played for the Chennai Super Kings team in the 1st 3 editions of the IPL starting from the 2008 Indian Premier League. On 10 May 2008, he picked up the first hat-trick of the IPL tournament in the match against Kings XI Punjab at Chennai, and rounded off the evening with a match-winning five-wicket haul. His tournament was to end on a low as he bowled the final over to Shane Warne and Sohail Tanvir, with the latter hitting the winning runs off the final ball. Since his successful spinal operation in England by Prof. John Dowell he has returned to full form. Balaji has been notably consistent for the economy rate in all T20 matches in the IPL Chennai Super Kings as the normal matches of T20 seldom had run chases below or near 130 . He has not done much in the batting side of IPL. In the second season of the Indian Premier League, he picked four wickets against Rajasthan Royals on 30 April 2009, leading the Chennai Super Kings to victory. In the 3rd season of IPL, Balaji played 7 games and picked up 7 wickets. After won the tournament and went on to play the ACLT20, Balaji played most of the games in the tournament and his economical bowling was praised by the captain of the Indian team, MS Dhoni and was listed by him as one of the reasons to CSK's victory in the tournament.

It is the capital of Antofagasta Province and Antofagasta Region. According to the 2015 census, the city has a population of 402,669. Previously part of Bolivia, Antofagasta was captured by Chile in the War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì83), and sovereignty was transferred under the terms of the 1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the two countries. The city of Antofagasta is closely linked to mining activity, being a major mining area of the country. The last decade has seen a steady growth in the areas of construction, retail, hotel accommodations, population growth, and remarkable skyline development. Antofagasta has the highest GDP per capita of Chile, US$47,000 and the 3rd place for Human Development Index just after Metropolitana de Santiago Region and Magallanes and Ant√°rtica Chilena Region.  History  In Chile, Antofagasta is known as \\"The Pearl of the North\\". = Name = Currently there are several theories to explain the origin of the name Antofagasta. A clear consensus regarding the true origin of the word has not yet been determined. It is probably a compound word that comes from the southern Cacan anto (or hattun, which means \\"big\\"), faya (or haya, which means \\"dry lake\\") and gasta (meaning \\"pueblo\\"), being a toponymy meaning \\"Town of the great salt lake\\". According to other theories, it may be a compound word from the Quechua word anta (meaning \\"copper\\") and Pakay (meaning \\"hidden\\"), being a toponymy meaning \\"Copper Cache\\"; it could also be related to the Chango language, Antofagasti (meaning \\"Sun Gate\\"), what the changos called the current natural monument \\"La Portada\\". However, it says the name Antofagasta is due to a decision by Manuel Mariano Melgarejo, who renamed the city in honor of a stay that he had in Antofagasta de la Sierra, in 1870. In Chile, Antofagasta is known as La Perla del Norte (\\"The Pearl of the North\\"), for its historical and economic importance. = Early settlers = Bolivia created the \\"Departamento del Litoral\\", during the government of Andr√©s de Santa Cruz, in 1837, which was divided into two provinces: La Mar (with capital Cobija) and Atacama (with its capital in San Pedro de Atacama) and 1868, Antofagasta would be the capital of the province of Mejillones. On 18 September 1866, Jos√© Santos Ossa and Francisco Puelma achieved the award of the concession of nitrate lands, following a request taken to the Bolivian government. The exploring of the Chilean miners found rich deposits of saltpeter (nitratine) in the field of Salar del Carmen, to the east of the present Antofagasta. Agreed to form the \\"Sociedad Exploradora del Desierto de Atacama\\" (Explorer Society of Atacama Desert). After the formation of the company, began to fill with what was called \\"La Chimba\\". On 19 March 1868, the \\"Melbourne Clark Company\\" was established, after the integration of Chilean and British capital. After the tsunami in Iquique and the 1868 Arica earthquake, it was necessary to give legal recognition to the Chimba as a mining town. On 27 August 1868, Bolivia's President Mariano Melgarejo instructed the Prefect of the Department of Litoral, the official founding of La Chimba, in the area bounded by the commissioners and Jose Santos Hilario Ruiz Prada. On 22 October 1868, the population was officially established and the port under the name La Chimba, as stated in the foundation charter. Later the city was renamed Antofagasta. The first official map of the population and the port of Antofagasta was designed by Jose Santos Prada on 14 September 1869. This document set out the grounds of the Melbourne Clark Company, plus 17 blocks and the Main Square. On 8 May 1872, Antofagasta was designated by the Bolivian Government as Puerto Mayor, opening trade worldwide. Next year, on 25 January 1872, following a session led by the prefect of the Provincial Department of Mejillones, Manuel Buitrago founded the Municipality of Antofagasta under Bolivian Law of Municipalities, which formed the body of \\"Municipal Agents\\", composed of two Germans, one Englishman and six Chileans. On 27 November 1873, the \\"Compa√±√≠a de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta\\" (CSFA), a Chilean mining company, signed a contract with the government of Bolivia, in which taxes were removed from mineral exploitation for 15 years. This contract was not ratified by the Congress of Bolivia, which was then analyzed negotiations with Chile. = War of the Pacific = Battalion No. 3 Line of the Chilean Army, formed in columns in the Plaza Col√≥n of Antofagasta in 1879 In 1873 Bolivia signed a secret treaty of defensive alliance with Peru. This would be used as an argument 5 years later in Chile, when it unleashed the War of the Pacific. The secret alliance forbade Bolivia from signing a border treaty with Chile, without consulting with Peru. However, in 1874 Chile and Bolivia signed a border treaty, which replaced the previous treaty of 1866. One of its points was not to impose new taxes on individuals, industries and Chilean capital for 25 years. For Bolivia, the contract of 1873 between the government and CSFA was not yet in force, because, according to the Bolivian constitution, all contracts with the Bolivian government had to be approved by the congress. According to the Bolivian version of events, the contract with the saltpeter company was incomplete so the congress, to approve the contract, decided to enforce a tax of 10 cents, which did not violate the treaty of 1874, since the contract was not yet in force at that date. Bolivia suspended the tax in deference to the government of Chile, but following a note from the Chilean foreign minister, it reactivated the tax law, then cancelled and closed the \\"Compa√±√≠a de Salitres\\". Faced with a looming conflict with Chile, Bolivia decided to claim support under the agreement signed with Peru, and the treaty became effective with the Chilean occupation of Antofagasta, on 14 February 1879. According to the Chilean version of events, the tax of 10 cents violated the treaty of 1874 since according to this, new taxes should not have been imposed on Chilean companies operating in Bolivia. At the breaking of the boundary treaty by Bolivia, and the cancellation of the contract of the CSFA, Chile seized Antofagasta, then in Bolivian territory, whose sovereignty had been ratified before 1866. After the war, a pact of truce was signed between Bolivia and Chile in 1884, which stated that the territory between the Loa River and parallel 23 would be under the administration of Chile, while Bolivia would be allowed access to the ports of Arica and Antofagasta. However, both treaties left outstanding issues to be clarified in two subsequent treaties, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Chile and Bolivia in 1904 and the 1929 Treaty of Lima in Peru. = 20th century = The Plaza Col√≥n at the beginning of the 20th century. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Chile and Bolivia, signed on 20 October 1904, and promulgated on 21 March 1905, established in perpetuity border between Chile and Bolivia. The territory of Antofagasta was definitely within Chile's borders but in return Chile agreed to build a railroad that would link the cities of Arica and La Paz, Bolivia was granted free movement of commerce through Chilean territory. In 1905, the city of Antofagasta began construction of sewers, because of existing outbreaks of bubonic plague and smallpox. The same year was ordered, so unsatisfactory, the closure of public places, in order to prevent the spread of disease. On 1 February 1906, the railway workers union of the \\"Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia\\" called for a readjustment of working hours, which was rejected. For this reason, on 6 February, from more than 3,000 workers went on strike, marching in protest to the Plaza Colon (main square). The army opened fire on protesters, killing 58 people. The event is known as the \\"Massacre of Plaza Colon\\". In 1912, the British community (La Colonia Britanica) erected a clock tower, replicating Big Ben, in Plaza Col√≥n to celebrate the republic's centenary. Antofagasta in June 1941 In 1937, the Municipality of Antofagasta made a national call for the composition of Antofagasta's anthem. Antonio Rendic, famous physician and poet of the city, and Juan Bautista Quagliotto, musician, claimed the right to compose the lyrics and music, respectively. On 2 February 1948, the Mayor Juan de Dios Carmona proposed in an open session in the hall of the Municipality, the establishment of 14 February as the day of the celebration of Antofagasta, despite not being the real founding date. Later, after the popular approval, the council approved the date. In 1956 the Universidad del Norte (now the Catholic University of the North) was founded, due to support from the Catholic University of Valpara√≠so. On 9 October, of the same year began the negotiations for the creation of the \\"Centro Universitario Zona Norte\\" (University Center North Zone), part of the University of Chile. In 1968 the Antofagasta center of the University of Chile was inaugurated, after a university reform agreement which meant the autonomy of the University Center North Zone. Finally in 1981, merging the offices of the University of Chile and Technical State University, giving rise to the University of Antofagasta. On 18 June 1991, a mudslide devastated much of the city, undermining land, damaged 2,464 houses and destroyed 493 buildings. Material damage was estimated at approximately $70,000,000. The disaster left 92 dead, 16 missing and about 20,000 homeless. On 30 July 1995, the city was hit by an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter Scale, with an intensity VII to VIII on the Mercalli Scale. Although the fatal balance accounted three people dead and hundred injured, structural damage was minor for the magnitude of the event. = Decade of growth = View of the south of Antofagasta in the last decade.

The average daily low temperature in the warmest month, January, is while the average daily high temperature is . The coldest month, July, sees an average low temperature of and an average high temperature of . The highest temperature recorded is on January 1998 and the lowest recorded is on September 1978. The Atacama Desert coast is subject to a climate of extreme aridity, and therefore generates a low average annual rainfall of (1970‚Äì2000), and the Town of Antofagasta itself receives an annual average of less than of rainfall per year, earning it the record as the world's driest town. However, the sporadic occurrence of heavy rainfall, together with the geomorphologic situation of the city, make it susceptible to be affected by mud flows and landslides.

He is voiced by the series' creator, Seth MacFarlane, and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the Griffin family, in the 15-minute pilot pitch of Family Guy on December 20, 1998. Peter was created and designed by MacFarlane himself. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company based on Larry & Steve, a short made by MacFarlane which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the green light, the Griffin family appeared in the episode \\"Death Has a Shadow\\". Peter is married to Lois Griffin and is the father of Meg, Chris, and Stewie. He also has a dog named Brian, with whom he is best friends. He has worked at a toy factory and at Quahog's Brewery. Peter's voice was inspired by the security guards that MacFarlane heard at his school. His appearance was a redesign of the protagonist Larry from MacFarlane's previous animated short films The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. He has appeared in several pieces of Family Guy merchandise, including toys, T-shirts, and video games, and he has made crossover appearances in other shows, including The Simpsons, South Park, Drawn Together, American Dad!, and Family Guys spin-off series The Cleveland Show.  Role in Family Guy  Peter Griffin is a middle class Irish American, who is a bespectacled, obese blue collar worker with a prominent Rhode Island and Eastern Massachusetts accent. Peter and his wife Lois have three children; Meg, Chris, and Stewie. He is the illegitimate son of Thelma Griffin and Mickey McFinnigan, and was raised by Thelma and his stepfather Francis Griffin. Peter and his family live in the fictional town of Quahog, Rhode Island, which is modeled after Providence, Rhode Island. Peter primarily worked as a safety inspector at the Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory, until his boss Jonathan Weed choked to death on a dinner roll while dining with Peter and Lois; he then became a fisherman on his own boat, known as the \\"S.S. More Powerful than Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, and The Incredible Hulk Put Together,\\" with the help of two Portuguese immigrants, Santos and Pasqual, until his boat was destroyed. He now works in the shipping department of the Pawtucket Patriot brewery. Peter is also shown in various jobs for single episodes and cutaway gags. In one episode Peter played for the New England Patriots until his behavior resulted in him being kicked off the team. In a running gag, storylines are randomly interrupted by extremely long, unexpected fights between Peter and Ernie the Giant Chicken, an anthropomorphic chicken who serves as an archenemy to Peter. These battles parody the action film genre, with explosions, high-speed chases, and immense devastation to the town of Quahog.  Character  = Creation = MacFarlane initially conceived Family Guy in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). During college, he created his thesis film entitled The Life of Larry, which was submitted by his professor at RISD to Hanna-Barbera. MacFarlane was hired by the company. In 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to The Life of Larry entitled Larry & Steve, which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons. Executives at Fox saw the Larry shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series, entitled Family Guy, based on the characters. Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, and gave him a budget of $50,000. Several aspects of Family Guy were inspired by the Larry shorts.Callaghan, p. 16 While working on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian. MacFarlane stated that the difference between The Life of Larry and Family Guy was that \\"Life of Larry was shown primarily in my dorm room and Family Guy was shown after the Super Bowl.\\" = Voice = MacFarlane based Peter's voice on the voices of security guards he had heard talking, while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. The voice of Peter is provided by MacFarlane, who also provides the voice for Brian, Stewie and Quagmire. MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one-time only characters, most prominently those of news anchor Tom Tucker, Carter Pewterschmidt (Lois' father), and Dr. Hartman. MacFarlane has been part of the main voice cast from the beginning of the series including the pilot, and has voiced Peter from the start. MacFarlane chose to voice Peter and several other characters himself, believing it would be easier to portray the voices he already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane's speaking voice is not very close to Peter's; he uses his normal voice as the voice of Brian. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from the security guards he overheard talking while he was attending the Rhode Island School of Design; according to him, \\"I knew a thousand Peter Griffins growing up in New England. Guys who would not think before they spoke, like [switching to Peter's voice] there was no self-editing mechanism. [Pointing to himself] Everything in here, [pointing to his front] it's coming out here, with no gateway\\". MacFarlane also voices many of Peter's ancestors who share the same type of voice. He noted in an interview that he voices Peter and the rest of the characters partly because they initially had a small budget, but also that he prefers to have the freedom to do it himself. In another interview, he mentioned that Peter's voice is one of the most difficult to do. There have been several occasions where MacFarlane does not voice Peter. In the episode \\"No Meals on Wheels\\" (season 5, 2007), actor Patrick Stewart voiced Peter in a cutscene, but MacFarlane voices Peter for the rest of the episode. In the episode \\"Family Gay\\" (season 7, 2009), Seth Rogen provided a guest-voice as Peter under the effects of the \\"Seth Rogen gene\\". In \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" (season 8, 2009), he was voiced by actor Jamison Yang, who was required for a scene where everything in the world was Japanese. = Personality = Peter is a stereotypical blue-collar worker who frequently gets drunk with his neighbors and friends Cleveland Brown, Joe Swanson and Glenn Quagmire at \\"The Drunken Clam,\\" Quahog's local tavern. In the season 4 episode \\"Petarded\\", Peter discovered his low intellect falls slightly below the level for mental retardation after taking an I.Q. test, which places his I.Q. at around 70. Peter is known for his brash impulsiveness, which has led to several awkward situations, such as attempting to molest Meg in order to adopt a redneck lifestyle. He is easily influenced by anyone he finds interesting and will often try to replicate their lifestyle and behavior merely out of curiosity. He is incredibly jealous of other attractions Lois has in her life, an attitude which has led to extreme situations, such as when he assaulted a whale that kissed Lois at SeaWorld. In the third season episode \\"Stuck Together, Torn Apart\\", Peter and Lois split up because of Peter's jealousy, only to discover that Lois has the same character flaw and the two decide to live with their mutually jealous nature. Peter has a very short attention span which frequently leads him to bizarre situations, as Chris points out in \\"Long John Peter\\", after Peter's parrot dies \\"He will get over it pretty quickly and then move on to another wacky thing\\", to which Peter finds a pipe organ and forgets about his parrot (Peter then destroys the pipe organ within seconds and then finds a deed to a cattle ranch). Peter is also na√Øve with one example in \\"Airport '07\\" where he thinks his truck will fly by filling it with airplane fuel. Peter has complex relationships with all three of his children. He normally makes fun of Meg and treats her badly, such as in the episode \\"FOX-y Lady\\", where he, Meg and Chris try to create a cartoon and they exclude Meg and her ideas. Though in some episodes Peter has had a good relationship with Meg, in \\"Hell Comes to Quahog\\" (season 5, 2006), Peter almost tells Meg he loves her and in \\"Road to Rupert\\" (season 5, 2007), he told Meg that he would treat her badly in front of the family, but that he would be her friend in secret. It was presumed though that in \\"Peter's Sister\\", (season 14, 2015) that Peter would stop bullying Meg. Peter communicates and has a much better relationship with Stewie. Peter and Stewie had their adventures when he took him to Walt Disney World Resort in the episode \\"The Courtship of Stewie's Father\\" (season 4, 2005). With Chris, Peter communicates well, but at times when in need of advice or in an adventure Peter tells Chris to do the opposite of what he should do, like in \\"Long John Peter\\" (season 6, 2008), where Chris is asking for advice on dating and Peter tells him to treat women horribly. Peter is best friends with his anthropomorphic dog, Brian. In earlier seasons, Brian often served as a voice of reason for Peter, helping him out with issues. Brian is extremely grateful to Peter for picking him up as a stray, shown during a flashback in the episode, \\"Brian: Portrait of a Dog\\". His gratitude was affirmed in, \\"New Kidney in Town\\", where Brian is prepared to give up both his kidneys (and his life), so that Peter could undergo a kidney transplant (although he did not have to do it thanks to another donor being found). At Brian's funeral in \\"Life of Brian\\", Peter said that Brian was his \\"best friend in the whole world\\" and \\"like a brother to him\\". = Ancestry = Before Peter was born, his mother Thelma went to Mexico City to have an abortion. However, she gave birth during the procedure, and smuggled him home to Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent his childhood. Peter was raised by Francis and Thelma Griffin in the Roman Catholic faith. However, in \\"Peter's Two Dads\\", he discovers that his biological father is an Irishman named Mickey McFinnigan. Peter visits Mickey, who initially rejects him. Mickey later accepts him as his son after beating him in the \\"game of drink\\" (the game of drink referring to matching shots until one passes out). Mickey is based on the friends of MacFarlane's father. MacFarlane said: \\"When I was growing up, my father had lots of friends: big, vocal, opinionated New England, Irish Catholics. They were all bursting at the seams with personality, and Family Guy came out of a lot of those archetypes that I spent years observing.\\"  Reception  = Praise = Editors of Variety put Family Guy in their contenders for the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series; they stated that, depending on your sense of humor, Peter is either \\"a comedy genius\\" or \\"an obnoxious idiot\\". MacFarlane has been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Voice-Over Performance category several times for voicing Peter and other characters; he won in 2016. He was also nominated in 2008 for an Annie Award in the Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production or Short Form for voicing Peter. Peter has ranked in several of IGN's top 10s (generally these lists are related to the show). Among these lists, Peter ranked the third spot on IGN's \\"Top 25 Family Guy Characters,\\" in which it was stated that many of the show's best gags come from Peter and his shenanigans and that \\"Peter practically invented the \\"manatee joke\\". Entertainment Weekly placed Peter in its \\"18 Bad TV Dads\\" list (the list also included characters like Homer Simpson and Al Bundy). = Criticism and controversy = Peter has been criticized for being too similar to Homer Simpson. Peter has appeared in some episodes of The Simpsons, in these episodes which he has been featured he has been depicted as Homer Simpson's clone or is accused of plagiarism. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Peter is Homer Simpson \\"as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows\\". Robin Pierson from The TV Critic criticized the Griffin family for being too similar to the Simpson family; and he said that Peter \\"has Homer Simpson written all over him\\". This is eventually made fun of in the episode \\"Ratings Guy\\" when, after Peter ruins television and goes to the networks to reverse the changes, Homer Simpson shows up with the same plight, with Peter going \\"A-ha! Looks like this is one WE beat YOU to!\\" In \\"The Simpsons Guy\\", a crossover episode between Family Guy and The Simpsons, the Griffins end up in the town of Springfield after their car is stolen, where they meet and befriend the Simpsons. Peter has created controversy in various episodes of Family Guy. The episode \\"The Cleveland- Loretta Quagmire\\" (season 4, 2005) featured a sequence titled \\"You Have AIDS\\", in which Peter dances and sings in a barbershop quartet fashion around the bed of a man with end-stage AIDS about his diagnosis, which drew protests from several AIDS service organizations. In the episode \\"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\\" (season 3, 2003), Peter sings a parody song of \\"When You Wish upon a Star\\", entitled \\"I Need a Jew\\"; on October 3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing the show of infringing its copyright on the original song; Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a \\"thinly veiled\\" copy of their music with antisemitic lyrics. The complaint was not upheld.  Cultural influence  = Appearances in the media = Peter has made several television appearances outside of Family Guy, often in the form of direct parody. Peter has appeared in two episodes of The Simpsons, referencing how the two shows are frequently compared to each other. In the fourteenth season episode \\"Treehouse of Horror XIII\\", Peter is depicted as one of Homer Simpson's clones, and in the seventeenth season episode, \\"The Italian Bob\\", a photo of Peter is in a book of criminals, which says he is wanted for \\"plagiarismo\\". Peter also appeared in various episodes of the show's spin-off The Cleveland Show. In addition, Peter has appeared at the end of the American Dad! episode \\"Hurricane!\\" with guns on both Stan Smith and former neighbor Cleveland Brown. During the stand- off, Stan accidentally shoots his wife Francine, which Peter declares as \\"classic American Dad!\\". = Merchandise = Peter is also featured on the Family Guy: Live in Vegas CD, and plays a significant part in Family Guy Video Game!, the first Family Guy video game, which was released by 2K Games in 2006. Peter will be used in the game Family Guy Online as a character class for the game's character creator. MacFarlane recorded exclusive material of Peter's voice and other Family Guy characters for a 2007 pinball machine based the show, created by Stern Pinball. In 2004, the first series of Family Guy toy figurines was released by Mezco Toyz; each member of the Griffin family had their own toy, with the exception of Stewie, of whom two different figures were made. Over the course of two years, four more series of toy figures have been released, with various forms of Peter. Alongside the action figures, Peter has been included in various other Family Guy-related merchandise. As of 2009, six books have been released about the Family Guy universe, all published by HarperCollins since 2005. This include Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One (), which covers the entire events of the episode \\"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\\", and Family Guy and Philosophy: A Cure for the Petarded (), a collection of 17 essays exploring the connections between the series and historical philosophers. which include Peter as a character. Peter appears in comic-book based on the Family Guy universe; by Titan Comics. The first comic book was released July 27, 2011. In 2008, the character appeared in advertisements for Subway, promoting the restaurant's massive feast sandwich. Chief marketing officer Tony Pace commented \\"Peter's a good representation of the people who are interested in the Feast, and Family Guy is a show \\"that appeals to that target audience.\\" The Boston Globe critic Brian Steinberg praised the restaurant's use of the character for the commercials.

According to the , it has a population of people. The town lies on the banks of the Suage River, north from Iloilo City. The town has an area of 94 km¬≤, 85% of which is agricultural land. In December 1997, it was declared as the \\"Christmas Capital of Western Visayas\\" because of its famed Christmas Festival of Lights. Considered the rice granary of Panay, the town is bordered by Dingle to the north, Zarraga to the south, Barotac Nuevo to the east, New Lucena, Iloilo and Mina to the west. History =Early history= The first people of Pototan were the family of Datu Ramon, grandson of Datu Puti, a Malay from the town of Dumangas. They first settled at Barangay Naslo, which was formerly the poblacion (town center). In that place was found a luxuriant growth of trees called \\"putat\\", after which the place was subsequently called \\"Kaputatan\\" or \\"place of many Putat trees.\\" However, due to its hilly terrain and poor water supply, they decided to move nearer the bank of the Suage River, now called Pototan. In the middle of the 16th century, the Chinese traders arrived in Pototan. =Spanish era= St. Joseph's Church The arrival of the Spaniards in 1593 sparked new changes in the socio-economic and political life of the natives. It was the start of a new era, the natives were converted to Catholicism through the efforts of Augustinian Friars. The settlement was subsequently made into a Parish. Education, though at the onset only for the privileged few, was introduced. The name \\"Kaputatan\\", which the Spanish have difficulty pronouncing, was changed to \\"Pototan\\". The Spanish built roads and bridges. Don Tomas Sajen and Don Escribano supervised the construction of the Tribunal (municipal hall) with the natives contributing the labor. The Tribunal withstood World War II and in the early 50s was modified into what is now the Western Visayas Hospital. In 1874, Pototanons began to run their own political affairs with the appointment of Don Juan Marcelo as the first Capitan Municipal. This form of government continued until the arrival of the Americans. During the incumbency of Capitan Municipal Braulio Pe√±aranda in 1891, there was a cholera outbreak. During the Philippine Revolution, Pototanons such as Teresa Magbanua (known as the Joan of arc of the VisayasCook, Bernard A. (2006). Women and War: A Historical Encyclopedia from Antiquity to the Present. ABC-CLIO. p. 465. .) and her two brothers, Elias and Pascual Magbanua took up arms and joined the revolution. The Americans arrived after Spain ceded Philippines to the United States in 1898. The remaining Spanish population fled to the hills together with many Filipinos including the last Gobernadorcillio, Don Maurillo Mendoza. He was later held prisoner by the Americans but subsequently named the first Municipal President. =American era= Under the Americans, the natives were granted the freedom of speech and worship. Education was liberalized; more and better roads and bridges were constructed. Improvements were also noticed in the economic, social and cultural life of the people. During the incumbency of Mun. President Maurillo Mendoza, the Pototanons again witnessed another unforgettable event: the burning of the entire half of the poblacion in November 1914. The cause of the fire is unknown. When the Philippine Constitution was ratified in 1935, another change in the town's local governance was introduced: the title of Municipal President was changed to Municipal Mayor. Santiago Puig was the first Municipal Mayor. He was succeeded by Mariano Pe√±aflorida in 1940. Pe√±aflorida served until September 16, 1942. =World War II= The coming of the Japanese during World War II spread chaos and fear among Pototanons. Mayor Pe√±aflorida continued to act as Mayor under the Free Revolutionary Government of Tomas Confesor while the Japanese Imperial Forces designated Tomas Ferrariz as Puppet Mayor.

She was born in Brussels, Belgium and raised in Greenfield Park, a suburb of Montreal. Heymans has won four Olympic medals, two bronze and two silver. She was the first female diver to win medals in four consecutive Olympic games and the first Canadian to win medals in four consecutive Olympics. Heymans also is a one time world champion and has won four Pan American championships as well as one Commonwealth Games championship. In addition she has won multiple medals in all three of these competitions. Career Before becoming a diver, Heymans was a gymnast.Television SRC, Pekin 2008, 'Plus Vite, Plus Haut, Plus Fort' segment (autobiographical monologue), √âmilie Heymans, Aug 21, 2008 She began diving in 1993, at age 11, after her coaches told her she did not have the physique to be a gymnast. Emilie made her international debut with Anne Montminy at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, where they won a silver medal in the 10m synchronized diving event. Heymans then set her sights on the 10m platform and became the 2003 World Champion in Barcelona. At the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, she proved herself again in the 10m synchronized diving event when she, along with teammate Blythe Hartley, took home the bronze medal. Going into the 2008 Summer Olympics she failed to qualify with partner Marie- Eve Marleau in the platform synchro event, which was considered a huge upset. In order to qualify for the 2008 games, Heymans had to re-focus on the solo platform, an event where she had failed to medal in two Olympics in a row. Heymans won the silver medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympics in the 10m individual event, and only a solid final dive by the Chinese competitor kept her off of the top of the podium. This medal secured her recognition as an outstanding diver in both individual and synchronized diving events. She had won medals in three consecutive Olympics, achieved by only five other Canadian Olympians. The years of abuse her body suffered as a result of platform diving caused pernicious neck and shoulder injuries, which compelled a switch to the springboard. In 2009, Heymans won the silver medal at the World Championships in Rome in the 3M springboard. In 2011, at the World Championships in Shanghai, Heymans, with partner Jennifer Abel, won the silver medal in the 3m synchro event. At the 2012 Olympics, √âmilie became the first Canadian Summer Olympian to win a medal in four straight Olympics, winning a bronze medal in 3m synchronized diving, along with partner Abel. Sylvie Bernier, a CBC Sports analyst and former gold medal diver, said of Heymans that \\"Emilie has won a medal at four straight Games and with three different partners. She has a quiet confidence and always believes she can do it. She doesn't need to tell the whole world.\\" Heymans herself said of her record-setting medal, \\"It's awesome. I'm really happy that I was able to win my fourth medal with Jennifer. We worked really hard over the last two years.\\" In January 2013, Heymans retired from the sport. Personal life Born in Brussels, Heymans moved with her family to Quebec after her mother competed at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal as a fencer. Her mother, Marie-Paule Van Eyck, was an Olympic fencer for Belgium.

As it is a fairly expensive additive, it is not used independently of glutamic acid; if disodium guanylate is present in a list of ingredients but MSG does not appear to be, it is likely that glutamic acid is provided as part of another ingredient such as a processed soy protein complex.

According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology The Maragtas Legend tells that in the 12th century, ten Bornean datus or chieftains left their homeland in the island of Borneo. In order to escape the cruel tyranny of their king, Sultan Makatunaw, they sailed towards the north in their long boats called balang- hais or balangays. They landed on the island of Panay, in order to live a life of unrestricted freedom. The ten Bornean datus or chieftains were led by Datu Puti. They bought the island of Panay from Datu Marikudo, the native chieftain of the Aetas or Negritos. For Panay Island, they paid Datu Marikudo with one golden salakot (head gear), and one gold necklace for his wife Maniwantiwan. (The Aetas or Negritos then went on to live in the mountains.) After the purchase of Panay, it was divided among three Bornean chieftains, namely Datu Sumakwel for Hamtik (Antique), Datu Bankaya for Aklan-Capiz, and Datu Paiburong for Irong-irong (Iloilo). Datu Puti and the rest of the Bornean Chieftains left for Luzon. The population increased mostly in the Siruwagan area (presently located in San Joaquin, Iloilo), where most of the Borneans settled down. And so, families from the tribes of Labing-isog and Mangwalis decided to settle elsewhere in Panay. They sailed in their long boats, and followed the course of the rising sun. They landed on a place which they immediately called ‚ÄúKatigbawan‚Äù because of the thick growth of a species of giant grass or tall reeds on this place, known to them in their native dialect as ‚Äútigbaw‚Äù. The famous Spanish Jesuit Historian Fray Pedro Chirino, SJ, called this place ‚ÄúCampo de Suaraga‚Äù (a field of reeds). The Maragtas Legend identified ‚ÄúKatigbawan‚Äù, (a field of reeds) as between a big creek, now known as Buyu-an Creek, in the south-west, and two big rivers in the north-east, now known as the Tacuyong and Sibalom Rivers. (This area being identified and referred to, is occupied by Barangay Parara Sur and Barangay Parara Norte in Tigbauan, Iloilo.) A form of local government was functioning well in ‚ÄúKatigbawan‚Äù, when the Spaniards discovered it sometime in 1575. That year (1575), the Spaniards came from their Administrative Center in La Villa Rica de Arevalo, and established the ‚ÄúPueblo de Tigbauan‚Äù, having shortened ‚ÄúKatigbawan‚Äù to its present name‚Äîthe town of Tigbauan, in the Province of Iloilo. The Spaniards later transferred the administrative seat or poblacion of the ‚ÄúPueblo de Tigbauan‚Äù, from Parara to its present location. And so, the town of Tigbauan, in the Province of Iloilo, was named after the giant grass or tall reeds known as ‚Äútigbaw‚Äù the local dialect, which is a legacy from the freedom-loving Borneans who settled Panay Island. (Note: The ‚Äútigbaw‚Äù or tall reeds are still growing luxuriantly along riverbanks in the town.) History Tigbauan historical marker inside the church courtyard = Spanish Colonial Era = \\"They call the reed-grass tigbao, and, by derivation, the lands which bear this grass are called Tigbauan; and because the site of this village is close to a great expanse of reedy land on the bank of a beautiful stream, it bears the above name. The village itself was on the same shore, at the mouth of the river‚Äîwhich, as well as the sea, yields various kinds of fish, excellent and plentiful, which I myself have enjoyed in abundance. As they were continually fishing on the beach, usually with three or four nets, they never made a haul without devoutly regaling us with a part of it. Tigbauan has a very beautiful district, with many villages extending more than six leguas along the coast of the sea; the entire district is well supplied with game, fruits, and vegetables, and fish from the sea. The people are very industrious; consequently I always saw them occupied‚Äîthe men, with their fisheries and farming; the women, with their spinning and weaving. What we accomplished in the two years spent among a people so good and well-disposed towards the Gospel could be told in less time than what we left undone; for, since we of the Society of Jesus were then so few, and had little hope of increasing our number, we did not dare to undertake more than we thought could probably be maintained; and in this we were not mistaken, for at the present day, when at least a dozen ministers are needed, there is actually but one secular priest. For that reason we did not dare to baptize adults or children, except in cases of extreme danger, outside of the chief village (which is Tigbauan) and two or three other outlying hamlets, distant two miles or less.\\" : -- Fr. Pedro Chirino, Relacion de las Islas Filipinas, (1604) =World War II= Tigbauan was the site where American forces code-named Victorino I, landed on March 18, 1945 together with the Philippine Commonwealth troops under the Philippine Commonwealth Army's 61st, 62nd and 63rd Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary's 6th Infantry Regiment to begin the liberation of Panay. The troops set out from Lingayen Gulf, Luzon on March 14. The 185th Infantry, 40th Division, splashed ashore at Tigbauan, several miles west of Iloilo. There they were greeted by Army Col. Macario L. Peralta's Filipino guerrillas and continued with the Philippine Commonwealth troops drawn up in parade formation. General Eichelberger recalled in his memoirs how the guerrillas stood \\"stiff in starched khaki and resplendent with ornaments.\\" The strong guerrilla force of 23,000 had secured most of the island' except the area immediately around Iloilo where 2,750 Japanese were ensconced. The 40th Division quickly swept through the Japanese outposts and then drove the Japanese from the city in two days. Again the Japanese withdrew after the initial fighting into the inaccessible mountain jungles. In the fighting, the Americans lost 20 men, the Filipinos lost 42 men, and the Japanese 80. Responsibility for mopping up was turned over to the Filipino guerrillas and the 2d Battalion, 160th Infantry. Some 1,500 Japanese later surrendered at the end of the war. Because General MacArthur planned to stage two divisions from Iloilo for the invasion of Japan, engineers began repairing the local airfield and starting base construction at once. Geography The municipality has flat terrain. The plain constitutes approximately 57% of the total area, covering about 6,667 has. along the north-west site of the Sibalom River. Along the boundaries of Guimbal, Leon and Tubungan are rolling hills covering an area of about 1,518 has. The municipality has no forest coverage. The highest point is above sea level and the lowest is one meter above sea level. The town has two main rivers, Sibalom and Tacuyong River. The first originates from the mountain portion of Panay passing through the town of Leon and snaking through the barangays of Cordova Norte and Cordova Sur, Bitas and Bagumbayan, the western portion of the poblacion and empties into the Panay Gulf. The second emanates from the junction of Barangay San Rafael, Binaliuan Menor, Nagba, Dorong-an and joins the Sibalom River in the Southern portion of the Poblacion. Aside from the rivers, there are creeks and natural springs, which could be a good source of water supply and could also be used as natural drainage. It is from Iloilo City. Of the total 8,889 has., 93.78% is devoted to agriculture and allied activities. Of this area, 1,077 has. are planted with coconuts, 4,554 has. are planted with rice and 19 has. are devoted to fishponds. Around 60 has. located in urban areas serve residential, commercial, and institutional purposes. =Climate= =Barangays= Tigbauan is politically subdivided into 52 barangays (\\"Pob.\\" is an abbreviation for poblacion). Demographics In the , the population of Tigbauan was people, with a density of . Economy Tigbauan ranks as one of the leading municipalities of Iloilo in fish production in the ten coastal barangays of Barroc, Atabayan, Baguingin, Namocon, Tan Pael, Barangay No. 8, Barangay 9, Parara Norte, Parara Sur and Buyu-an. The latest survey showed that barangays Barroc, Atabayan and Baguingin produced less than 2,000 tons of fish mill and bagoong and were sold to fish millers and poultry raisers in the province. Saludan Festival Saludan came from the word salud. Tigbauan is a coastal town, its sea water abound in different kinds of fish. An excerpt from a book, ‚ÄúThe Philippine Islands,‚Äù by Blair and Robertson; 1493. 1898; Vol. XII, pp. 217, 219-220 of which Fr. Pedro Chirino related his experience and observations about the town states that, ‚ÄúThe village itself was on the same shore, at the mouth of the river, of which I myself have enjoyed in abundance. As they were continually fishing on the beach, usually with three or four nets, they never made a haul without devoutly is regaling us with a part of it.‚Äù Since the beginning of recorded history, fishermen have used nets or woven bamboos to catch fish from the sea or rivers, and in the local dialect they call this salud. On the other hand, aside from winter resources, our forests, farmers and hills are also abound in rich natural resources. The book further states that ‚ÄúTigbauan has a very beautiful district with many villages extending more than six leagues along the coast of the sea; the entire district is well supplied with game, fruits, and vegetables and fish from the sea. The people are very industrious and always pre-occupied the men with their fisheries and farming, the women with their spinning and weaving‚Ä¶‚Äù Primarily, their farm product is rice. Whether crude farming ways and tools or modern agricultural machineries are used we use the term salud. In threshing rice using the old method or the modern equipment ‚Äì kita nagasalud man gihapon. Their tuba is famous for its sweetness and as practiced and tuba ginasalud kang salud, and salud also means the method of catching \\"hipon\\" or shrimp (\\"Salud ta sa Palupadan\\"). The term was coined by then, Sangguniang Bayan Member Rexfel G. Trivilegio of Barangay Atabayan, Tigbauan, Iloilo. Thus, the Saludan Festival was born. Adlaw sang Tigbauan San Juan Sahagun Parish, Tigbauan During the first term of Mayor of Tigbauan Myrna M. Torres in 1998, she signed an Executive Order declaring the third Friday of October every as the ‚ÄúAdlaw sang Tigbauan‚Äù. History tells us that because of the increase in population in Sirawagan area (the place where the Bornean datus settled), the families from the tribes of Labing-Isog and Mangwalis sought for greener pasture. Following the course of the rising sun they landed in the place which they called ‚ÄúKatigbawan‚Äù because of the plentiful growth of giant grasses known to them as ‚Äútigbaw‚Äù. This place was said to be Parara by word of mouth handed down from generation to generation, it is believed that the families of Labing-Isog and Mangwalis reached the place when the native feasted for bountiful rice. To the present time, the season for gathering rice crop is mostly in October. During this time of the year the fishermen also rejoice for a bountiful sea catch. Thus, ‚ÄúAdlaw Sang Tigbauan‚Äù is celebrated in October. To make this day more significant, the ‚ÄúSaludan Festival‚Äù was launched. Tigbauan is one of Iloilo's treasure troves, packed with \\"gems\\" from more than a millennium of historical significance. With one foot in the past, and the other in the present, Tigbauan allows every visitor a glimpse of its heady blend of architectural masterpieces and natural wonder. The town's 134 years of history are on display when you look. The town delights in its St. John of Sahagun Parish. Constructed using forced labor under Fray Florencio Martin in 1867, its beautiful baroque facade in rococo finish, gives visitors a glimpse of the community's intense spirituality. The church's remarkable architecture with its fa√ßade and tower, survived the ravages of the Second World War and the great earthquake in 1948. Presently, the mystical beauty of its altar depicts heaven and Dante's Inferno; the church walls with the Way of the Cross, all done in intricate mosaics of colored stones is a sight not to be missed. On its churchyard remained a marker of what used to be the site of the first Jesuit boarding school for boys in the Philippines established in 1592 and renowned that time for their liturgical music during church services. The beach in Barangay Parara was the landing site of America's 40th Infantry Division to liberate Panay and Romblon during the Second World War on March 18, 1945. The same area became the landing site in the 13th century of the descendants of the Bornean datus. Education Tigbauan Central Elementary School Tigbauan has 21 public elementary schools, seven private schools, five primary schools, 45 day care centers, 10 national high (Secondary) schools, four private preparatory schools, and one Catholic kindergarten school. Schools are encouraged to establish and maintain biological/ vegetable garden and participate in the coastal and environmental cleanup and tree planting.

He was the world champion at the 1 and 3 m springboards from 2005 to 2007 and is the first, and so far only, diver to have been world champion in all three individual categories (1, 3 and 10 m platform). He is also a 37-time Canadian senior diving champion, and nine-time junior champion. He was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Diving career  Despatie began diving at the age of 5 in his own backyard pool. He first came to public attention at the 1998 Commonwealth Games with an extremely impressive gold medal on the 10 metre platform (which included an unprecedented score of perfect 10s). He was only 13 years old at the time, and the achievement was recorded in the Guinness Book Of World Records 2000. At the Olympic games in Sydney in 2000, with a 4th-place finish at the 10-metre platform, he was offered the chance to compete in the springboard event in those Games as well, when one of the Canadian divers had to withdraw from the meet due to complications with his citizenship, but declined because he had not been training for that event. He won the silver medal at the world championships in 2001 in Fukuoka, Japan in the same event, and in 2003 won a gold medal at the World Diving Championships in Barcelona, Spain in the 10 metre platform. He recorded 107.1 for his last dive, which set a new record. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Despatie won the gold medal in the three- metre springboard event, followed by three gold medals at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, he won the silver medal in the men's 3 metre springboard competition, but finished out of the medal standings in fourth place in the 10 metre platform. This result was contrary to expectations going into the games, where he was expected to win silver or gold in the 10 metre platform event and not place in the 3 metre springboard. In front of his home crowd at the 2005 World Aquatic Championships in Montreal, he became World Champion on the 3 metre springboard. He won with a world record score of 813.60 points, his \\"worst\\" dive being rated an average 8.5. Despatie followed up on that performance by winning the 1 m springboard, with a world record score of 489.69. His victory meant that he had won FINA World Titles on both springboard and platform. Despatie successfully defended his three-meter springboard title at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, and also won gold medals on 1 m springboard and 3 m synchronized with Arturo Miranda. He finished 3rd in the 10m platform. Returning to Melbourne, this time for the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Despatie went head to head with the best divers in the world, including the top-ranked Chinese diving team. Finishing 8th in the 10 m tower event and winning silver medals in the 3 m event and the 3 m synchro with partner Arturo Miranda, Despatie proved that he was one of the world's best divers. At the Beijing Olympics in 2008, he claimed a silver medal in the 3m springboard event and finished in 5th place in the 3m synchro event. At the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Alexander got 3 gold medals for Canada, in the 1 metre and 3 metre springboard, and 3 metre synchronized springboard dive. Television career Despatie announced his retirement during a news conference in Montreal on June 4, 2013.Alexandre Despatie retires from diving, CBC Sports, Toronto, Canada, 4 June, 2013.Retrieved: 15 February 2019. On June 6, he was announced as the cohost of Breakfast Television's Montreal edition, set to premiere on City Montreal on August 26, 2013.\\"Alexandre Despatie named co-host of City Montreal‚Äôs morning show\\". The Gazette, June 8, 2013. Honors In 2018, Despatie was inducted into the Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. Personal life Despatie attended Coll√®ge Andr√©-Grasset and lives with his parents in Laval-sur-le-Lac. In an interview with the CBC in the lead-up to the 2004 Olympics, he said he was interested in acting and television/movie production, and may pursue that as a career once he is no longer diving, although he is also known to support groups and aspiring divers and to help them fulfill their dreams through private contributions to youth diving leagues. He has held diving clinics which aim to give young divers lessons and valuable experience. In August 2006, Despatie started shooting his first feature film in Montreal. The movie, a teenage romantic comedy called Taking the Plunge (√Ä vos marques... party!) was released in Quebec in March 2007. Despatie played a small but important part of a diver who is the friend and confidant of a young female swimmer. Quebec actress Louise Lapar√© coached Despatie for his role and told a Montreal newspaper that the popular athlete was a \\"born actor\\". He has since moved towards a career in broadcasting, joining the broadcast team for Canada's French-language television coverage of the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver during a brief break from training for the 2012 Games. He co-anchored the coverage of the opening and closing ceremonies alongside legendary Quebec hockey commentators Richard Garneau and Pierre Houde, narrated numerous athlete profiles, and took viewers on a tour of Granville Island, where many francophone musicians performed during the Olympics.

Purpose Making global measurements of ocean temperature and salinity (T-S) quickly and easily accessible to users is the primary goal of the GTSPP. Both real time data transmitted over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS), and delayed-mode data received by the NODC are acquired and incorporated into a continuously managed database. International contributors Several countries contribute to the GTSPP. They are: * Australia * Canada * France * Germany * Japan * Russia * United States Canada's Marine Environmental Data Service (MEDS) leads the project, and has the operational responsibility to gather and process the real-time data. MEDS accumulates real-time data from several sources via the GTS. They check the data for several types of errors, and remove duplicate copies of the same observation before passing the data on to NODC. The quality control procedures used in GTSPP were developed by MEDS, who also coordinated the publication of those procedures through the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). The U.S. National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) performs four functions for the GTSPP: # Maintains the global database of temperature and salinity data and provides online access to the data. # Adds realtime data supplied by MEDS to the database. # Processes delayed mode copies of data by performing the same data quality tests as MEDS, then adds data to the database. # Prepares monthly data sets and transfers them by network to participants in the U.S., Australia and France, as well as to requestors. In addition to MEDS and NODC, three science centers participate in the project by independently evaluating the delayed- mode data sets for the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), and NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) perform this function as Data Assembly Centers for the World Ocean Circulation Program, which the GTSPP supports. Infrastructure Data flow of the GTSPP The GTSPP consists of four major components: * Global Telecommunication System (GTS): Carries real-time data from ships and buoys in support of the IOC/WMO Integered Global Ocean Services System (IGOSS). * IODE Data Centers: Contribute data, monitor the project, and distribute products. These are national oceanographic data centers which participate in the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) System of the International Oceanographic Commission. * Continuously Managed Database (CMD): Maintains the up-to-date global temperature-salinity data, replaces near real-time records with higher quality delayed-mode records as they are received, and creates and distributes copies of the data on CD-ROM and other media. * WOCE Data Assembly Centers: Perform scientific quality control through data analysis, and issues products and predictions based on the global temperature-salinity data set.

Prior to founding the AWB, Terre'Blanche served as a South African Police officer, was a farmer, and was an unsuccessful Herstigte Nasionale Party (Reconstituted National Party) candidate for local office in the Transvaal. He was a major figure in the right-wing backlash against the collapse of apartheid. His beliefs and philosophy have continued to be influential among white supremacists in South Africa and around the world. Under Terre'Blanche, the AWB swore to use violence to preserve minority rule, opposing any concessions offered to the African National Congress ‚Äì an organisation AWB supporters repeatedly branded as Marxist terrorists ‚Äì and gaining notoriety for storming the Kempton Park Trade Centre during bilateral negotiations in 1993. AWB loyalists also clashed with South African security forces at the Battle of Ventersdorp, a bloody 1991 skirmish in which police opened fire on a white crowd for the first time since the Rand Rebellion, leaving three Afrikaners dead. Immediately prior to South Africa's first multiracial elections, Terre'Blanche's followers were linked to a number of bombings and assassinations targeting the South African Communist Party; armed AWB commandos participated in the crisis in Bophuthatswana in 1994. Terre'Blanche spent three years in a Rooigrond prison for assaulting a petrol station attendant and for the attempted murder of a black security guard around 1996. He was released in June 2004. On 3 April 2010, he was hacked and beaten to death on his Ventersdorp farm, allegedly by two of his employees. Conservative Afrikaners have suggested that the killing was part of a larger pattern of farm invasions in South Africa.\\"Farm Murder, Anti-Apartheid Song Stoke Racial Tensions in South Africa\\", Voice of America Background Terre'Blanche's grandfather fought as a Cape Rebel for the Boer cause in the Second Boer War, while his father was a lieutenant colonel in the South African Defence Force and a leader of the local Commando. The progenitor of the Terre'Blanche name (translatable as either 'white land' or 'white earth' in French) in the region was a French Huguenot refugee, Estienne Terreblanche from Toulon (Provence), who arrived at the Cape in 1704, fleeing anti- Protestant persecution in France. The Terreblanche name has generally retained its original spelling though other spellings include Terre'Blanche, Terre Blanche, Terblanche and Terblans. Born on a farm in the Transvaal town of Ventersdorp on 31 January 1941, Terre'Blanche attended Laerskool Ventersdorp and Ho√´r Volkskool in Potchefstroom, matriculating in 1962. While in school, he gave early expression to his political leanings by founding the cultural organisation Jong Afrikanerharte (Young Afrikaner Hearts).Russell, Alec: Big men, little people: the leaders who defined Africa. McMillan, 1999 He joined the South African Police, and was initially deployed in South West Africa (now Namibia), which had been given to South Africa under a League of Nations Trust mandate after World War I. Upon returning to South Africa, he became a Warrant Officer in the Special Guard Unit, which was assigned to members of the Cabinet. Political career =Herstigte Nasionale Party= During the late 1960s, Terre'Blanche increasingly opposed what he called the \\"liberal policies\\" of B. J. Vorster, then Prime Minister of South Africa. After four years of service in the South African Police, he resigned to pursue a career in politics, running unsuccessfully for local office in Heidelberg as a member of the far-right Herstigte Nasionale Party. Eugene Terre'Blanche (1941‚Äì2010) . Retrieved 4 April 2010 =Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging= Disillusioned with the established avenues for political participation, Terre'Blanche founded the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) in Heidelberg with six other individuals in 1973. Initially a secret society, the AWB first appeared on the public scene after its members were charged and fined in connection with the tarring and feathering of Floors van Jaarsveld, a professor of history who had publicly voiced the opinion that the Day of the Vow, a religious public holiday in remembrance of the Battle of Blood River, was nothing more than a secular event with hardly any real reference point in history. Although Terre'Blanche would later express his regrets regarding the incident when testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he suggested that his convictions relating to the sanctity of the Day of the Vow might make his actions more understandable. In the years that followed, Terre'Blanche's speeches at public gatherings often evoked the Battle of Blood River, and his oratorical skills earned him much support among the white right wing in South Africa; the AWB claimed 70,000 members at its height. In September 1977, Johannesburg newspaper The World reported that Terre'Blanche had been investigated on charges of bestiality involving a number of African bushpigs. Throughout the 1980s, Terre'Blanche continued to present himself and the AWB as an alternative to both the National Party-led government and the Conservative Party, and he remained staunchly opposed to the reform policies of P. W. Botha to establish additional, albeit still separate, parliamentary chambers for non-whites, and to grant suffrage to Coloureds and South Africans of Indian origin.Obituary: Eugene Terreblanche BBC News. Retrieved 4 April 2010 The organisation's strongest support was found in the rural communities of South Africa's North, with comparably few supporters in urban areas where his following was largely limited to middle and lower income Afrikaners. End of apartheid Terre'Blanche viewed the end of apartheid as a surrender to communism, and threatened full-scale civil war if President F. W. de Klerk handed power to Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress.Eugene Terre'Blanche (Obituary) Daily Telegraph. Retrieved 4 April 2010 When De Klerk addressed a meeting in Terre'Blanche's hometown of Ventersdorp in 1991, Terre'Blanche led a protest, and the Battle of Ventersdorp ensued between the AWB and the police, with a number of people killed. Terre'Blanche claimed that it was only when he stood between the police and the AWB and demanded a ceasefire that the shooting ended. Terre'Blanche accused President de Klerk of instigating the riot for political gain. In an attempt to disrupt the negotiation process in 1993, Terre'Blanche led an armed invasion of the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park while negotiations to end apartheid were in progress. After a memorandum of grievances was presented to National Party minister Roelf Meyer and Dawie de Villiers and after an agreement that no arrests would be made, the AWB withdrew from the premises. That evening several identified AWB leaders were arrested and their wives were incarcerated in Soweto, separately from their husbands. Vlakplaas General Krappies Engelbrecht was appointed to launch an investigation. Terre'Blanche claimed he and President Lucas Mangope of the predominantly ethnic Tswana Homeland of Bophuthatswana came to a \\"mutual agreement\\" on 17 February 1992 to aid each other in the \\"event of a communist threat\\". On 4 March 1994 Mangope announced that Bophutatswana would not participate in the South African general election in an effort to maintain Bophutatswana's independence from the Republic of South Africa. Bophuthatswana's minister of justice, Godfrey Mothibe tried in vain to convince Mangope to participate in the election, but then accused the ANC of orchestrating the revolt, which was helped by the stance taken by South Africa's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Pik Botha. Thousands of ANC supporters were bussed in from outside Bophuthatswana to support the popular uprising. Terre'Blanche claimed a conspiracy by citing a \\"three-step plan\\" by the ANC in an effort to destabilise Bophuthatswana, which included ANC infiltration of the Bophuthatswana police and military. However, ANC candidate for the North West Province, Popo Molefe claimed the ANC was merely supporting the people of Bophuthatswana after it became clear that their political freedoms were limited. The AWB were subsequently defeated while invading Bophuthatswana to prop up the autocratic leader of the Bantustan in 1994 and Terre'Blanche did not follow up on his earlier threats of war. Terre'Blanche claimed he had personally communicated with Mangope on 10 March 1994, prior to mobilising his men to protect the capital Mmabatho against looting and unrest. Officers of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force initially received the AWB militia with \\"great joy and surprise\\".(Vuur en Verraad, Arthur Kemp) The AWB militia assembled in an airport hangar in Mmabatho, where they were to be provided with rations and firearms. Terre'Blanche ordered his men to remove their AWB badges upon the request of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force. While contained at the hangar, an unidentified and independent faction carrying the AWB emblems started shooting indiscriminately at the public. Terre'Blanche concluded that the South African intelligence services may have set up the shooting in order to discredit the AWB, since the media broadcast footage of the individuals' emblems, but did not publicise their identity. The Bophuthatswana police systematically began to remove the media from strategic locations, and the initial hospitality shown to the AWB militia was replaced by contempt. When Bophuthatswana fell into complete anarchy, the AWB withdrew. =1991 documentary and libel case= Terre'Blanche was the subject of the television documentary The Leader, His Driver and the Driver's Wife (1991), directed by British filmmaker Nick Broomfield. In 1988, the AWB was beset by scandal when claims of an affair with journalist Jani Allan surfaced. In July 1989, Cornelius Lottering, a member of the breakaway Orde van die Dood group, orchestrated a failed assassination attempt on Allan's life by placing a bomb outside her Sandton apartment. Broomfield's documentary claimed Terre'Blanche had an affair with the journalist who had interviewed him for South Africa's Sunday Times; an assertion she denied as well as her portrayal in the documentary. This led to Allan taking libel proceedings against the documentary broadcaster Channel 4 in 1992 in the London's High Court. During the court hearings, several transcripts of their alleged sexual relationship appeared in the South African and British press. Terre'Blanche submitted a sworn statementA HAM THAT CAN'T BE CURED The Spectator. 21 August 1992 to the London court denying he had had an affair with Allan. In a rare interview with the Afrikaans Sunday newspaper Die Rapport, his wife Martie Terre'Blanche denounced the rumours. Although the judge found that Channel 4's allegations had not defamed Allan, he did not rule on whether or not there had been an affair. The South African business newspaper Financial Mail published a lead story on 6 August detailing the theory that F.W. de Klerk had orchestrated the libel case to discredit Terre'Blanche and the far right movement in South Africa. Allan has continued to dismiss the claims.The return of Jani Allan Mail & Guardian. 4 October 2013 =Amnesty= Following the end of apartheid, Terre'Blanche and his supporters sought amnesty for the storming of the World Trade Centre, the 'Battle of Ventersdorp', and other acts. Amnesty was granted by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. =Later years= In 2004, he was voted No. 25 in SABC3's Great South Africans, a list of 100 South African personalities. \\"SA se gewildste is Nelson Mandela\\" , Die Burger (archive). Retrieved 4 April 2010 Controversy over the list led the SABC to cancel the television series. Terre'Blanche was much ridiculed after he was filmed falling off his horse during a parade in Pretoria. After his murder, the state-owned SABC said on the evening news that he would be remembered \\"as a failed horseman\\". Terre'Blanche claimed the media only showed part of the fall and explained that unedited footage of the incident would show that the horse had slipped. He accused the media of double standards in reporting when praising Mbhazima Shilowa when he fell from, but immediately remounted his horse. Broomsfield;'s sequel to his 1991 documentary, His Big White Self, was first broadcast in February 2006. Terre'Blanche was also interviewed by Louis Theroux in episode 3.3 \\"Boer Separatists\\" of the BBC series Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends, and was characterized during the episode by Theroux speaking to a former follower of Terre'Blanche as \\"very hostile, deeply racist\\". In March 2008, the AWB announced the re-activation of the political party for 'populist' reasons, citing the encouragement of the public. Reasons for the return have been attributed principally to attacks on commercial farmers and ethnic Boers, the electricity crisis, corruption across government departments and rampant crime. Throughout April 2008, Terre'Blanche was to be the speaker at several AWB rallies, encompassing Vryburg, Middelburg, Mpumalanga and Pretoria. He had been calling for a \\"free Afrikaner republic\\", and vowed to take his campaign to the United Nations' International Court of Justice in The Hague in a bid to secure this. He favoured large tracts of land that had been purchased from the ethnic Swazis in the eastern portion of the South African Republic, from the Zulus in northern Natal, and others, as well as largely uninhabited portions of the interior that had been settled by the Voortrekkers. In June 2008, it was announced that the AWB Youth Wing would be launched and Terre'Blanche was to be its founding member. In a video interview in 2008, he voiced his objection to a proposal to change the Springbok emblem of the South Africa national rugby union team (Springboks). He stated that the Springbok emblem could be replaced with an impala or kudu for sports teams representing the new Afrikaner republic.Zoopy video: Eugene Terre'Blanche talks about the Springbok emblem at AWB headquarters on 21 November 2008 In September 2009, he addressed a 3-day convention attended by 300 Afrikaners which was intended to develop a strategy for \\"Boer liberation\\". Terre'Blanche reinforced earlier claims for land in Northern Natal and the Eastern Transvaal.\\"For volk sake\\", Sunday Times 26 September 2009 In October 2009 several right-wing groups led by Terre'Blanche outlined their future plans at a Ventersdorp meeting. In an interview with the Mail and Guardian he said he wanted to unite 23 organisations under one umbrella, in order to take, as he had vowed, the fight of \\"the free Afrikaner\\" to the International Court of Justice. In an interview with the Mail and Guardian, he stated that he would publish his biography, Blouberge van Nimmer (The Blue Mountains of Long Ago), in December 2009.\\"The AWB rides again\\", Mail and Guardian 2 October 2009 The biography was ready for press at the time of his death and published under the name \\"My Storie\\", as told to author Amos van der Merwe.

Terre'Blanche said that he merely argued with Ndzima after the burglary, questioning Ndzima's claims to have seen the burglars. According to Terre'Blanche, during the argument his dog broke loose and chased Ndzima. Terre'Blanche asked the state prosecution to explain why there was no blood on his overall after the alleged assault. He claimed that a bogus case had been built against him in order to \\"bury the conservative element of Afrikaner-nationalism in the shallow grave of injustice\\". The court rejected his claims, concluding that Terre'Blanche had assaulted Ndzime as retribution for testifying against whites. Terre'Blanche later pointed out that his defence attorney suddenly resigned as a member of the ultra-conservative white Conservative Party's Volksraad and joined the ANC shortly after the conclusion of the court case. =Attempted murder of Motshabi= Security Guard Paul Motshabi was permanently disabled when he was beaten in 1996. He was crippled and intellectually impaired by brain damage sustained in the attack, and his wife left him. He was one of 16 victims of violence in the South Africa's North West who received new houses as part of the national government's campaign to mark sixteen days of activism against violence against women and children.\\"Terre'Blanche victim gets house\\" , News24.com Terre'Blanche also maintained his innocence in the Motshabi case, stating that he had discovered Motshabi already beaten in a park while patrolling Ventersdorp, after which he took him to hospital. Although he was not present when the alleged attack happened, Gabriel Kgosimang, an ex- employee of Terre'Blanche, testified that his former employer had repeatedly beaten Motshabi over the head, upper body, neck and shoulders after he crashed into him with his vehicle. The official medical report only cites a single hit to the head. =Subsequent disputes= Terre'Blanche was released on 11 June 2004. The AWB website continued to claim that these accusations, along with other scandals involving him, were fabricated by the \\"Black Government and the left wing media\\". Terre'Blanche subsequently stated that a policeman had identified the real attackers of Motshabi. The names were supposedly contained in a sealed envelope and kept in safekeeping with instructions given that this information would be released in case something \\"unnatural\\" should happen to him. These names have not yet been released, despite the murder of Terre'Blanche. Poetry Prior to the 1994 multi-racial elections, Terre'Blanche's Afrikaans-language works were on the state syllabus of Natal schools. Upon his release from jail, he quoted Wordsworth's poem I Wandered Lonely As a Cloud. He had previously released a CD of his poetry collection and most recently a DVD. The DVD was named \\"Inktrane\\", which is directly translated to English as \\"ink tears\\". This DVD was released through 11.3% Motion Pictures (Pty) Ltd. Murder Terre'Blanche, who had lived in relative obscurity since the decline of his organisation, was murdered on his farm Villana, just outside Ventersdorp, on 3 April 2010. He was beaten to death with pipes and pangas (machetes), while napping. His body was found on the bed with facial and head injuries.\\"Terre'Blanche killed over 'wage dispute'\\" , News24.com South African President Jacob Zuma, who followed up an overnight statement with a televised address called for calm and for \\"responsible leadership\\" following the murder, describing it as a \\"terrible deed;\\" and described the murderer as \\"cowardly.\\"\\"Zuma slams 'cowards' and appeals for calm\\", The Star Zuma's words were echoed by the AWB and organisations including AfriForum and Solidarity.

They were both charged with murder, and one was released on bail.\\"Terre'Blanche murder is 'declaration of war' by blacks\\", Daily Telegraph Terre'Blanche's daughter Bea told the media that the two workers had not been paid for March because her father could not get his banking in order before the Easter weekend, and that an arrangement had been made to pay them after the weekend. She stated that he had enjoyed a good relationship with his employees, which had been strengthened by their work with animals on the farm. =Aftermath= Chris Mahlangu's announcement to other farm workers that he was \\"now their boss\\" fuelled suspicions that the murder was politically motivated. The murder took place amid a racial controversy in South Africa involving the singing of a song by African National Congress Youth League leader Julius Malema, which includes the lyrics \\"Shoot the Boer\\" (\\"Dubul' ibhunu\\"). The ANC, which had previously defended its right to sing the song, announced that it would consider a moratorium on the singing of the song, following the murder, in the interests of national cohesion. Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille said that the murder would \\"inflame tensions\\" in South Africa.\\"Terre'Blanche death will 'polarise'\\" News24.com Malema denied the song had anything to do with the murder, and defended his singing of it, saying he was \\"ready to die,\\" and that he was not scared of Boers, in reference to threats, later retracted, that Terre'Blanche would be avenged.\\"I'm ready to die, says emotional Malema\\", IOL ANC leaders later announced a temporary ban on the singing of the song.\\"Malema silent as ANC stops race songs\\", www.timeslive.co.za Thousands attended Terre'Blanche's funeral, held at noon on 9 April 2010 at Ventersdorp's Protestant Church. Later the same day, he was buried on his farm. Terre'Blanche's murder has been linked to attacks on farmers in South Africa. =Court case= The two suspects appeared in court in Ventersdorp on 6 April 2010 amid racially charged scenes, and were charged with murder, robbery and crimen injuria, for injuring the dignity of Terre'Blanche by leaving his pants pulled down after killing him. The AWB retracted earlier calls to avenge the murder as Zuma appealed for peace. Nevertheless, members of the ANC supported the accused by turning up at the court in huge numbers, and singing revolutionary songs. Terre'Blanche's supporters also turned up at the court, singing the former South African national anthem, \\"Die Stem van Suid Afrika\\". On 22 May 2012, 29-year-old Chris Mahlangu was found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life in prison. 18-year-old Patrick Ndlovu, the other man accused in the case, was acquitted of murder due to a lack of forensic evidence, though he was found guilty of breaking-in. They had both pleaded not guilty, and declined to testify. Protesters from both sides were gathered outside the courthouse when the verdict was read. Judge John Horn ruled that there was no evidence that Mahlangu had been acting in self-defence, and that the murder had been committed for financial reasons. Although Mahlangu claimed that he had been raped, Horn declared that if that was the case he should have raised it immediately, which he failed to do. He also claimed that he had been acting in retaliation because he had been living in an \\"appalling condition... not fit for human habitation,\\" as well as having experienced child exploitation on the farm. In popular culture In Harry Turtledove's 1992 science fiction novel The Guns of the South, Eugene Terre'Blanche is fictionalised as the minor character Eugen Blankaard, whose name is a literal Afrikaans translation. This character, a historian of AWB, does not appear directly, but his writings are read by other characters. A poster of Terre'Blanche appears in the 1992 Australian drama, Romper Stomper about a neo-Nazi group in suburban Melbourne. Terre'Blanche is the subject of two Nick Broomfield documentaries; The Leader, His Driver, and the Driver's Wife and His Big White Self. Louis Theroux interviewed Terre'Blanche in 2000 as part of his Weird Weekends documentary on the Boer.

Gozzo (1922‚Äì1964) was an American trumpet player born in New Britain, Connecticut on February 6, 1922. Gozzo was a member of the NBC Hollywood staff orchestra at the time of his death on October 8, 1964. He died at the age of 42 of a heart attack. He played with Isham Jones (1938) and Red Norvo (1940), then performed and recorded with Bob Chester (1941) and Claude Thornhill (1941-2). After working with Benny Goodman (1942) he joined the navy and played in a band led by Artie Shaw (1942-4). He rejoined Goodman in 1945, then toured and recorded with Woody Herman (he was featured as a soloist on \\"Stars fell on Alabama\\", 1946 Col.37197and performed with Boyd Raeburn and Tex Beneke (1947). In Los Angeles he played on Bob Crosby's radio broadcasts (1947‚Äì51). Gozzo was highly acclaimed as a lead trumpeter and was much in demand as a studio musician; he also took part in sessions with Les Brown (1949), Jerry Gray (1949‚Äì53), Ray Anthony (1951-8), Billy May (1951‚Äì64). Gozzo, lead trumpeter on the Glen Gray, Stan Kenton, and Harry James \\"remakes\\", and in Dan Terry's 1954 Columbia sessions, recorded extensively with arrangers Van Alexander, Nelson Riddle, Billy May, Ray Conniff, Jerry Fielding and Shorty Rogers, and also with performers Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. Gozzo played first trumpet on all of the recordings of composer Henry Mancini. He routinely performed on many major live television shows which were broadcast on the NBC network, including the Dinah Shore Show (1955 through 1964). Gozzo also performed on motion picture soundtracks including The Glenn Miller Story, The Benny Goodman Story, Bye Bye Birdie, Call Me Madam, Ben-Hur and Cleopatra. He also performed on the Ella Fitzgerald two-record set on Verve (Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Harold Arlen Songbook). Gozzo's nicknames were \\"Goz\\" and \\"Gopher\\", due to his resemblance to a gopher when viewed from the front while he was playing. He was considered by his colleagues as being an exceptionally strong trumpeter with a well-developed range and tonal quality. For most of his recording career, he played a Besson Meha trumpet with a custom Bert Herrick mouthpiece. Occasionally, he played a Chicago Benge or a LeBlanc Gozzo model trumpet. \\"Trumpeter's Prayer,\\" was composed by Tutti Camarata for Gozzo, and \\"Portrait of Trumpet\\" by Sammy Nestico was written as a posthumous tribute.

It is produced from vegetable starch by partial hydrolysis and is usually found as a white hygroscopic spray-dried powder. Maltodextrin is easily digestible, being absorbed as rapidly as glucose and may be either moderately sweet or almost flavorless (depending on the degree of polymerisation). It is commonly used for the production of soft drinks and candy. It can also be found as an ingredient in a variety of other processed foods. Structure Maltodextrin consists of D-glucose units connected in chains of variable length. The glucose units are primarily linked with Œ±(1‚Üí4) glycosidic bonds. Maltodextrin is typically composed of a mixture of chains that vary from three to 17 glucose units long. Maltodextrins are classified by DE (dextrose equivalent) and have a DE between 3 and 20. The higher the DE value, the shorter the glucose chains, the higher the sweetness, the higher the solubility, and the lower heat resistance. Above DE 20, the European Union's CN code calls it glucose syrup; at DE 10 or lower the customs CN code nomenclature classifies maltodextrins as dextrins. Production Maltodextrin can be enzymatically derived from any starch. In the US, this starch is usually corn; in Europe, it is common to use wheat. In the European Union, wheat-derived maltodextrin is exempt from labeling, as set out in Annex II of EC Directive No 1169/2011. In the United States, however, it is not exempt from allergen declaration per the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, and its effect on a voluntary gluten-free claim must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis per the applicable Food and Drug Administration policy. Food uses Maltodextrin is used to improve the mouthfeel of food and beverage products. It is also used in some snacks such as potato chips and jerky. It is used in \\"light\\" peanut butter to reduce the fat content but maintain the texture. Maltodextrin is also sometimes taken as a dietary supplement by athletes in powder form, gel packets, or energy drinks. Maltodextrin is used as an inexpensive additive to thicken food products such as infant formula. It is also used as a filler in sugar substitutes and other products. Maltodextrin has a glycemic index ranging from 85 to 105. In animal studies, there is evidence to suggest that maltodextrin may exacerbate intestinal inflammation. Other uses Maltodextrin is used as a horticultural insecticide both in the field and in greenhouses. It has no physiological or biochemical action. Its efficacy is based upon spraying a dilute solution upon the pest insects, whereupon the solution dries, blocks the insects' spiracles and causes death by asphyxiation.

It was developed by the French general Henri-Joseph Paixhans in 1822‚Äì1823. The design furthered the evolution of naval artillery into the modern age. Its use presaged the end of wood as the preferred material in naval warships, and the rise of the ironclad. Background Explosive shells had long been in use in ground warfare (in howitzers and mortars) and on bomb vessels against stationary targets, but they were fired only at high angles and with relatively low velocities. The shells of that time were inherently dangerous to handle, and no method had been found to safely fire the explosive shells with the high power and flatter trajectory of a high-velocity gun. However, before the advent of radar and modern optical controlled firing, high trajectories were not practical for ship-to-ship combat. Such combat essentially required flat-trajectory guns in order to have a reasonable chance of hitting the target. Therefore, ship-to-ship combat had consisted for centuries of encounters between flat-trajectory cannons using inert cannonballs, which could inflict only local damage, even on wooden hulls. Mechanism Paixhans advocated using flat-trajectory shell guns against warships in 1822 in his Nouvelle force maritime et artillerie. Paixhans developed a delaying mechanism that, for the first time, allowed shells to be fired safely in high-powered flat-trajectory guns. The effect of explosive shells lodging into wooden hulls and then detonating was potentially devastating. Henri-Joseph Paixhans first demonstrated this in trials against the two-decker Pacificateur in 1824, in which he successfully broke up the ship. Two prototype Paixhans guns had been cast in 1823 and 1824 for this test. Paixhans reported the results in Experiences faites sur une arme nouvelle. The shells had a fuze that ignited automatically when the gun was fired; they lodged in the wooden hull of the target, and exploded a moment later: The first Paixhans guns for the French Navy were made in 1841. The barrel of the guns weighed about 10,000 lbs. (4.5 metric tons), and proved accurate to about two miles. In the 1840s, France, Britain, Russia, and the United States adopted the new naval guns. The effect of the guns in an operational context was first demonstrated during the actions at Veracruz in 1838, at Campeche in 1843, Eckernf√∂rde in 1849 during the Danish‚ÄìPrussian War, and especially at the Battle of Sinop in 1853 during the Crimean War. The Naval Battle of Campeche made history because it was the first time both sides used explosive shells and the only time sailing ships defeated steamers. According to the Penny Cyclopaedia (1858): shell with sabot Development While the idea was notable in the advance of artillery, metallurgy had not advanced to the level needed for safe operation. The naval guns of this type were known for catastrophic failures: the chambers would burst in use. The long shells and large blackpowder charges needed to propel the shells put a stress on cast iron cannon that often could not be contained. Further work by John A. Dahlgren, and Thomas Jackson Rodman improved the weapon to use both solid shot and shell safely. Adoption =France= In 1827 the French navy ordered fifty large guns on the Paixhans model from the arsenals at Ruelle and at Indret near Nantes. The gun chosen, the canon-obusier de 80, was so called because it was of the 22 cm bore diameter which would have fired an 80-pound solid shot. The gun barrel weighed 3600 kg and the bore was of 223 mm diameter and 2.8 m long, firing a shell weighing 23.12 kg. The guns were produced slowly and were tested afloat through the 1830s. They formed a small part of the armament on larger ships, with only two or four guns being carried, although on smaller, experimental steam vessels they, and the much larger canon-obusier de 150 of 27 cm bore, were proportionately more important. The paddle steamer M√©t√©ore, for example, carried three canon-obusier de 80 pieces and six small carronades in 1833. Alongside the large guns which Paixhans had called for, the French navy also used a smaller shell gun, of the same 164 mm bore as its standard solid shot-firing 30 pounder guns and carronades, in larger numbers with first rate ships carrying over 30 of these guns. =United States= The United States Navy adopted the design, and equipped several ships with 8-inch guns of 63 and 55 cwt. in 1845, and later a 10-inch shell gun of 86 cwt. Paixhans guns were used on USS Constitution (four Paixhans guns) in 1842, under the command of Foxhall A. Parker, Sr., USS Constellation in 1854, and were also installed on the USS Mississippi (10 Paixhans guns), and USS Susquehanna (six Paixhans guns) during Commodore Perry's mission to open Japan in 1853.Arms and men: a study in American military history Walter Millis p.88 Black Ships Off Japan - The Story of Commodore Perry's Expedition Arthur Walworth p.21 The Dahlgren gun was developed by John A. Dahlgren in 1849, with advantages over Paixhans guns: The Dahlgren gun was developed as an improvement of the Paixhans gun. View on deck of showing aft 11-inch Dahlgren shell gun. =Russia= The Russian Navy was the first to use the guns extensively in combat. At the Battle of Sinop in 1853, Russian ships attacked and annihilated a Turkish fleet with their Paixhans explosive shell guns. The shell penetrated deep inside the wooden planking of Turkish ships, exploding and igniting the hulls. The defeat was instrumental in convincing the naval powers of the shell's efficacy, and hastened the development of the ironclad to counter it.

Th√©ophile Malo Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne (23 November 1743 ‚Äì 28 June 1800) was a French officer named by Napoleon \\"first grenadier of France\\". He was also a celtomaniac antiquarian who introduced the words \\"dolmen\\" and \\"menhir\\" into general archaeological usage.  Career  He was the son of a lawyer named Corret, and was certainly baptised and perhaps born at Carhaix-Plouguer in Brittany, though nearby Saint-Hernin where his father had a position is one of a number of other places in the area put forward as his place of birth. His desire for a military career being strongly marked, he was enabled by the not uncommon device of producing a certificate of nobility signed by his friends, first to be nominally enlisted in the Maison du Roi, and soon afterwards to receive a commission in the line, under the name of Corret de Kerbaufret. Four years after joining, in 1771, he assumed with the help of a letter from the Duke of Bouillon the surname of La Tour d'Auvergne, claiming descent from an illegitimate half-brother of the great Marshall Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne, one of Louis XIV's leading commanders. Many years of routine service with his regiment were broken only by his participation as a volunteer in the Duke de Crillon's Franco-Spanish expedition to Menorca in 1781. This led to an offer of promotion into the Spanish army, but he refused to change his allegiance. Statue of de la Tour d'Auvergne in CarhaixIn 1784 he was promoted captain, and in 1791 he received the Cross of St. Louis. In the early part of the French Revolution his patriotism was still more conspicuously displayed in his resolute opposition to the proposals of many of his brother officers in the Angoumois regiment to emigrate rather than to swear to the constitution, and he fought in the revolutionary army in the French Revolutionary Wars, refusing promotion beyond the grade of captain. In 1792 his lifelong interest in numismatics and questions of language was shown by a work which he published on the Bretons. At this time he was serving under Montesquiou in the Alps, and although there was only outpost fighting he distinguished himself by his courage and audacity, qualities which were displayed in more serious fighting in the Pyrenees the next year. He declined well-earned promotion to colonel, and, being broken in health and compelled, owing to the loss of his teeth, to live on milk, he left the army in 1795. On his return by sea to Brittany he was captured by the English and held prisoner for two years. When released, he settled at Passy and published Origines gauloises (1796). In 1797, on the appeal of an old friend whose son had been taken as a conscript, he volunteered as the youth's substitute, and served on the Rhine (1797) and in Switzerland (1798‚Äì1799) as a captain. In recognition of his singular bravery and modesty Corret obtained a decree from Napoleon naming him the \\"first grenadier of France\\" (27 April 1800). This led him to volunteer again, and he was killed in action at the Battle of Neuburg on 27 June 1800.J. Macgowan, The Field of Mars, 1801, un-numbered pages. Battlefields listed alphabetically.  Memory  La Tour d'Auvergne's almost legendary courage had captivated the imagination of the French soldier, and his memory was not allowed to die. It was customary for the French troops and their allies of the Rhine Confederation under Napoleon to march at attention when passing his burial place on the battlefield. His heart was long carried by the grenadier company of his regiment, the 46th. After being in the possession of Giuseppe Garibaldi for many years, it was finally deposited in the keeping of the city of Paris in 1883. In 1800 Napoleon ordered, \\"His name is to be kept on the pay list and roll of his company. It will be called at all parades and a non-commissioned officer will reply, 'Mort au champ d'honneur.' \\" This custom, with little variation, is still observed in the 46th regiment on all occasions when the color is taken on parade. However, in early 1809, Napoleon himself put this tradition to an end. \\"What regiment has not had a general, a colonel, or finally, a brave man killed at its head? I have tolerated this singularity long enough\\" (Nap. Corr., vol 18, No. 14727). The urn was collected by the War Minister, showing that Napoleon preferred to celebrate the men who died to affirm his dynasty and build his Empire, rather than an individual whose association with the French Revolution was unmistakable  References  ;Attribution * Sources * Alain Schnapp, The discovery of the past, London: 1996.

Its distance from the state capital S√£o Paulo is by highway, by railway and in a straight line. It is located at an altitude of 675 meters. The population is 232,006 (2015 est.) in an area of 1170 km2.Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica History Panorama of the city from a rooftop.

In 1923, Ant√¥nio Pereira da Silva and his son Jos√© Pereira da Silva were the pioneers of the region, cleared land next to Feio and Peixe rivers. This land was named Alto Cafezal, or \\"High Coffee Plantation\\". A cidade que foi construida deputy at the time, Bento de Abreu Sampaio Vidal held in 1926 a parcel of their assets. In 1927, Colonel Jos√© Br√°s or Jose' da Silva Nogueira whose family origin in Itapetininga, arrived in Marilia. His family held 40% of the farm land named Bonfim, and the process of urbanization began with the allotment of this farm. Companhia Paulista Railway had been advancing its tracks from S√£o Paulo to get to the town of L√°cio, and in accordance with its plan, the roads that were being opened at the branch were named in alphabetical order. The next branch should have its name beginning with the letter \\"M.\\" \\"Maratona\\", \\"Mog√∫ncio\\" and \\"Macau\\" were suggested, but Vidal was not satisfied with them. So, in one of his trips to Europe by ship, as he read Tom√°s Ant√¥nio Gonzaga's Mar√≠lia de Dirceu, he chose the name Mar√≠lia from the poetry book. The city of Mar√≠lia was created with this name by State Law No. 2161 on December 22, 1926, but remained as a borough of Cafel√¢ndia. In 1928, Mar√≠lia was raised to the status of municipality by State Law No. 2320 of December 24. Its anniversary is celebrated on April 4, 1929. At first, the economy of Mar√≠lia was based on the cultivation of coffee, being replaced by cotton. The financial success originated from this latter crop led to the installation of the first two industries in the city (two cottonseed oil) in the mid-1930s. With the expansion of the industrialization in S√£o Paulo state, rail and highways were also built, thereby linking Marilia to various regions of the state of S√£o Paulo and northern Paran√°. In the 1940s the city established itself as a development of the West Paulista, when there was a large and growing urban population. In the 1970s, there was a new industrial cycle in the city with the installation of new industries, specially food processing and welding. With the subsequent installation of several university courses, Mar√≠lia attracted more people to the region, which accelerated the development of the city as a commercial & industrial hub. Mar√≠lia today has approximately 50 food industries in the area and it is known as the \\"National Capital of Food Processing.\\" Geography =Climate= The city's climate is subtropical with the following characteristics: Average annual temperature: 18,5 ¬∞C Hottest month in January: 23.0 ¬∞C Coldest month in June: 13.2 ¬∞C Absolute Maximum: 39.4 ¬∞C Absolute minimum: -4.6 ¬∞C =Demography= The Cathedral of Mar√≠lia, which has a largely catholic population.

Many people representing over one hundred nationalities gather to worship together every week. Volunteers from the congregation participate in over forty ministries, ranging from feeding the homeless in New York City to staffing an orphanage in South Africa. A major emphasis at Times Square Church is giving aid to the disadvantaged. Church history The Times Square Church was founded by David Wilkerson in 1987. At the time, Times Square was known as a center of X-rated films, strip clubs, prostitution, and drug addiction. Wilkerson opened the church in response to what he described as \\"the physically destitute and spiritually dead people\\" he saw among the pimps, runaways and crack dealers who populated the area. The Times Square Church briefly held its services in The Town Hall on 43rd Street in Manhattan and then in the Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street. In 1989 the church was leased the former Mark Hellinger Theatre. In 1991 it bought the Theatre for $17 million USDSimonson,Robert. Playbill November 26, 2010 . Wilkerson described the church as an evangelical pentecostal church headed by three pastors: David Wilkerson, his brother, Donald Wilkerson, and Robert Phillips.Collins, Glenn.

In 2001, founding pastor David Wilkerson entrusted the senior pastorate to Carter Conlon, formerly an evangelical pastor from eastern Canada and associate pastor at Times Square Church from 1994-2001. There are also visiting ministers and missionaries who come to preach from all over the world. The church places an emphasis on prayer and even has a \\"prayer during preaching ministry\\". There are also high school and young adults programs to teach the truth and love in the Word of God. From 2007 to 2009 the church organized an event called Prayer in the Square, a prayer rally which took place in Times Square. On May 5th 2020, Tim Dilena became Senior Pastor, the third since the church‚Äôs founding. He had a lifelong association with founding pastor David Wilkerson and has regularly preached at the church for many years. Building history The church is headquartered in a theater building originally built by Warner Bros. in 1930 as a movie palace, the Warner Hollywood Theatre, which was later converted to a Broadway venue as the Mark Hellinger Theatre. Notable Broadway musicals that have played at the theater include My Fair Lady, Jesus Christ Superstar, and the Katharine Hepburn musical Coco.\\"Times Square Church\\" at Internet Broadway Database Times Square Church purchased the building from the Nederlander Organization for an undisclosed amount in 1991.

It is a widely used food pickling agent, with an E number of E211. It is the sodium salt of benzoic acid and exists in this form when dissolved in water. It can be produced by reacting sodium hydroxide with benzoic acid. Production Sodium benzoate is produced by the neutralization of benzoic acid, which is itself produced commercially by partial oxidation of toluene with oxygen. Natural occurrence While sodium benzoate does not occur naturally, benzoic acid and its esters are found in many foods. Fruits and vegetables can be rich sources, particularly berries such as cranberry and bilberry. Other sources include seafood, such as prawns, and dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt. Uses =Preservative= Sodium benzoate is a preservative, with the E number E211. It is most widely used in acidic foods such as salad dressings (i.e. acetic acid in vinegar), carbonated drinks (carbonic acid), jams and fruit juices (citric acid), pickles (acetic acid), condiments, and frogurt toppings. It is also used as a preservative in medicines and cosmetics. Under these conditions it is converted into benzoic acid (E210), which is bacteriostatic and fungistatic. Benzoic acid is generally not used directly due to its poor water solubility. Concentration as a food preservative is limited by the FDA in the U.S. to 0.1% by weight. Sodium benzoate is also allowed as an animal food additive at up to 0.1%, per the Association of American Feed Control Officials. Sodium benzoate has been replaced by potassium sorbate in the majority of soft drinks in the United Kingdom. =Pharmaceutical applications= Sodium benzoate is used as a treatment for urea cycle disorders due to its ability to bind amino acids. This leads to excretion of these amino acids and a decrease in ammonia levels. Recent research shows that sodium benzoate may be beneficial as an add-on therapy (1 gram/day) in schizophrenia.Add-on Treatment of Benzoate for Schizophrenia A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of d-Amino Acid Oxidase Inhibitor December 2013Mental Health Research Institute Staff Publications, University of Michigan. Mental Health Research Institute Total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores dropped by 21% compared to placebo. Sodium benzoate, along with phenylbutyrate, is used to treat hyperammonemia. Sodium benzoate, along with caffeine, is used to treat postdural puncture headache, respiratory depression associated with overdosage of narcotics.mayoclinic.org, Caffeine And Sodium Benzoate (Injection Route) and with ergotamine to treat vascular headache.ebi.ac.uk, CHEBI:32140 - sodium caffeine benzoate =Other uses= Sodium benzoate is also used in fireworks as a fuel in whistle mix, a powder that emits a whistling noise when compressed into a tube and ignited. Mechanism of food preservation The mechanism starts with the absorption of benzoic acid into the cell. If the intracellular pH falls to 5 or lower, the anaerobic fermentation of glucose through phosphofructokinase decreases sharply, which inhibits the growth and survival of microorganisms that cause food spoilage. Health and safety  In the United States, sodium benzoate is designated as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration. The International Programme on Chemical Safety found no adverse effects in humans at doses of 647‚Äì825 mg/kg of body weight per day. Cats have a significantly lower tolerance against benzoic acid and its salts than rats and mice. The human body rapidly clears sodium benzoate by combining it with glycine to form hippuric acid which is then excreted. The metabolic pathway for this begins with the conversion of benzoate by butyrate-CoA ligase into an intermediate product, benzoyl-CoA, Substrate/Product which is then metabolized by glycine N-acyltransferase into hippuric acid. Substrate/Product =Association with benzene in soft drinks= In combination with ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300), sodium benzoate and potassium benzoate may form benzene. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration tested 100 beverages available in the United States that contained both ascorbic acid and benzoate. Four had benzene levels that were above the 5 ppb Maximum Contaminant Level set by the Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water. Most of the beverages that tested above the limit have been reformulated and subsequently tested below the safety limit. Heat, light and shelf life can increase the rate at which benzene is formed. =Hyperactivity= Research published in 2007 for the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) suggests that certain artificial colors, when paired with sodium benzoate, may be linked to hyperactive behavior. The results were inconsistent regarding sodium benzoate, so the FSA recommended further study.Food Standards Agency issues revised advice on certain artificial colours 6 September 2007Food Colorings and Hyperactivity \\"Myomancy\\" 7 September 2007Agency revises advice on certain artificial colours, Food Standards Agency, 11 September 2007 The Food Standards Agency concluded that the observed increases in hyperactive behavior, if real, were more likely to be linked to the artificial colors than to sodium benzoate. The report's author, Jim Stevenson from Southampton University, said: \\"The results suggest that consumption of certain mixtures of artificial food colours and sodium benzoate preservative are associated with increases in hyperactive behaviour in children. . . . Many other influences are at work but this at least is one a child can avoid.\\" Compendial status * British Pharmacopoeia * European Pharmacopoeia * Food Chemicals Codex * Japanese Pharmacopoeia * United States Pharmacopeia See also * Acceptable daily intake * List of investigational antipsychotics * Potassium benzoate References External links * International Programme on Chemical Safety - Benzoic Acid and Sodium Benzoate report * * Safety data for sodium benzoate * The Ketchup Conundrum Category:Antiseptics Category:Benzoates Category:Preservatives Category:Organic sodium salts Category:E-number additives ja:ÂÆâÊÅØÈ¶ôÈÖ∏„Éä„Éà„É™„Ç¶„É† ","title":"Sodium benzoate"},{"id":"901292","text":"Organization Chart of the Ft. McPherson Garrison Command. Fort McPherson was a U.S. Army military base located in Atlanta, Georgia, bordering the northern edge of the city of East Point, Georgia. It was the headquarters for the U.S. Army Installation Management Command, Southeast Region; the U.S. Army Forces Command; the U.S. Army Reserve Command; the U.S. Army Central. 200px Situated on and located four miles (6 km) southwest of the center of Atlanta, Fort McPherson is rich in military tradition as an army post dating back to 1867. It was during that year that a post was established in west Atlanta on the grounds where Spelman College is now located. Between the years 1867 and 1881, the post was garrisoned in turn by elements of the 2nd, 16th and 18th U.S. Infantry Regiments and the 5th Artillery. Their mission was to enforce Union regulations during the reconstruction period following the Civil War. Named after Major General James Birdseye McPherson, this fort was founded by the U.S. Army in September 1867. During the Reconstruction Era, it was named the \\"McPherson Barracks\\", and it served as a post for the Federal troops who were occupying Atlanta. With the end of Reconstruction, the McPherson Barracks was closed and sold off in 1881, though the site continued to be occupied during the summers by U.S. troops stationed in Florida. In 1885, the land was again purchased by the Army at which to station ten army companies. During World War I, Fort McPherson was used as a camp for Imperial German Navy prisoners of war and as a training site for the Active Army and Georgia National Guard. A rifle Range was operated along the ridge where current Stanton road now exists. The Deploying officers and NCOs surveyed the local civil war entrenchments parallel to the Railroad along Utoy Creek to learn about trench warfare. During the General Textile Workers Strike in 1934, this fort was used as a detention center to hold picketers who had been arrested while striking at a cotton mill in Newnan, Georgia. Fort McPherson's nearest Army neighbor, and its sub-post, was Fort Gillem, previously established as the Atlanta Army Depot in 1941, is located in Forest Park, Georgia, approximately 11 miles to the southeast. Fort Gillem was a logistical support base, housing some Army, Department of Defense, and other government agencies. Those units include the First Army, the U.S. Army and Air Force Exchange Distribution Center, the Military Entrance Processing Station, and the U.S. Army Second Recruiting Brigade. Fort Gillem was also the host to the only crime lab of the U.S. Army. Fort McPherson and Fort Gillem shared most common services. Fort McPherson is now closed, and Fort Gillem has been reduced to the Gillem Enclave partnership with Fort Gordon, both due to the 2005 BRAC commission. In 2007, there were 2,453 active duty soldiers and 3,784 civilian employees at both forts, with a total active duty and civilian employee payroll of $529,874,972. With only 102 family quarters and 272 single soldier billets at Fort McPherson, and 10 family quarters at Fort Gillem, the active duty military and Department of the Army civilian employees lived in civilian housing in the surrounding Fulton, DeKalb, Clayton, Fayette, and Henry Counties. Other important users of the fort facilities were the 98,700 or more Atlanta area military and naval retirees and their family members. These residents live mostly in Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb, Clayton, Fayette, Gwinnett, and Henry counties. For urban mass transit, Ft. McPherson was mostly served by the Lakewood/Fort McPherson MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority) station. On June 26, 2015, Fort Mac LRA became the owner of 145 acres of property on the former Fort McPherson in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. Fort Mac LRA is responsible for ensuring quality reuse and redevelopment of 145 acres on the former Army post. The Fort Mac LRA board of directors are nominated by the Mayor of Atlanta, the Fulton County Commission or the Governor. In June 2015, 330 acres of Fort McPherson was purchased by actor/producer Tyler Perry to be the new home of Tyler Perry Studios. Tyler Perry Studios grand opening occurred on Saturday, Oct. 5, 2019.  2005 Base realignment and closure (BRAC)  As a result of the BRAC 2005 recommendation, Fort McPherson was closed down September 15, 2011, and Fort Gillem reduced to a military enclave. = Units relocated = The following units were relocated from Fort McPherson: the Headquarters of the U.S. Army Forces Command and the Headquarters of the U.S. Army Reserve Command, was moved to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The Headquarters, U.S. Army Central, was moved to Shaw Air Force Base Sumter South Carolina. The Installation Management Command, Southeast Region and the U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command, Southeastern Region was moved to Fort Eustis, Virginia. The Army Contracting Agency, Southern Region Office, was moved to Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The following Fort Gillem units were relocated: Headquarters, First Army, to Rock Island Arsenal, Ill.; 2nd Recruiting Brigade to Redstone Arsenal, Ala.; the 52nd Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group to Fort Campbell, Ky.; the 81st Regional Readiness Command Equipment Concentration Site to Fort Benning, Ga.; and the U.S. Army Central Headquarters support office to Shaw Air Force Base, S.C. The Army and Air Force Exchange Service Atlanta Distribution Center will cease operations and the Federal Emergency Management Agency will move off the installation. Fort Gillem became a contiguous enclave for the Georgia Army National Guard, the remainder of the 81st RRC units, the Criminal Investigation Division Forensics Laboratory and the Navy's Reserve Intelligence Area 14, which relocated from Naval Air Station Atlanta.

The redevelopment plan adopted was primarily light industrial and logistical, with a smattering of commercial, residential, and retail space. = McPherson Redevelopment = The McPherson Planning Local Redevelopment Authority (MPLRA) is the entity authorized by the Department of Defense to develop a plan for what will become of Fort McPherson. It is a multijurisdictional body representing surrounding communities impacted by the base closure. It bought the land for about $30 million. The MPLRA executive board approved a reuse plan in September 2007 with a science and technology park and a mix of shops, residences and office space: * An employment district of approximately , envisioned as a biomedical research park. The research park would be anchored by state investment and contain Georgia University system components. It is ultimately planned to include approximately of office and lab space and more than 1,900 units of high-density residential space. The research park will be developed by a task force that includes the University System Board of Regents, local governmental entities and private partners. * A mixed-use, high-density retail area about in size. This high-density area is seen as a \\"Main Street\\" development with a mid-rise residential area, a hotel, public plazas and street-level retail, restaurants, offices, and grocery stores. * A historic district covering approximately . Most of the buildings in this area are already on the National Register of Historic Places. This district centers on the existing parade ground and is expected to be developed for mixed use, but with a historical cultural theme. Within the historic district, Staff Row would be preserved and used for single-family residential or other complementary uses. * Other areas will be home for up to 4,600 units of residential housing, a balanced mix of market rate, high-end housing, affordable housing, and housing for the formerly homeless or families at risk of homelessness. * Approximately would be set aside for green space. This would connect to the historic area to create a public-oriented Linear Park centerpiece that wraps around the entire property from the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) station on the north to the MARTA station on the south. Together with the residential districts, this green space would replace an area dominated by a golf course and include a space of approximately to be used for special events and festivals. * The Department of Defense transferred 10 acres of land and six buildings of Fort McPherson to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. The Atlanta VA Fort McPherson campus provides services to the Atlanta veterans community such as the Fort McPherson VA Clinic, VA Domiciliary Residential Rehab Treatment Program, Healthcare for Homeless Veterans HCHV, Community Resource and Referral Center CRRC. In August 2014, a plan to sell a large portion of McPherson to filmmaker Tyler Perry became public. State Senator Vincent Fort and residents called for more transparency.  Units  = Installation Management Command, Southeast Region = The Installation Management Command, Southeast Region (IMCOM-SE), is located in Building 171 at Fort McPherson and has the function of managing Army installations in the southeastern United States and Puerto Rico. IMCOM-SE provides all base operations, public works and family support programs, ensuring the readiness of Soldiers, Families and military units. It has more than 15,000 employees across the southeast and manages a $2.2 billion annual operating budget. The region is responsible for, delivering to standard, all facets of installation support, including care of Soldiers and Families; morale, welfare and recreation; education services, food and laundry; religious support; force protection; fire and emergency services; public works; environmental; residential housing; and execution of DoD base realignment. The IMCOM-SE team includes Anniston Army Depot, Ala.; Blue Grass Army Depot, Ky.; Fort Benning, Ga.; Fort Bragg, N.C.; Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico; Fort Campbell, Ky.; Fort Gordon, Ga.; Fort Jackson, S.C.; Fort Knox, Ky.; Fort McPherson, Ga.; Fort Rucker, Ala.; Fort Stewart, Ga.; Holston Army Ammunition Plant, Tenn.; Milan Army Ammunition Plant, Tenn.; Mississippi Army Ammunition Plant, Miss.; Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point, N.C.; Redstone Arsenal, Ala.; and the U.S. Army Garrison, Miami, Fla. The region supports the senior mission commander on each installation by relieving him or her of the requirement to oversee day-to-day garrison operations. The region exercises installation management, provides for public safety, provides for sound stewardship of resources, executes community and Family support services and programs and maintains and improves installation infrastructure. IMCOM-SE is one of six regions under the Installation Management Command, which is headquartered at Arlington, Va. IMCOM was first organized as the Installation Management Agency in 2002. In 2006, IMCOM was activated as a three-star command that includes the former Installation Management Agency, the former Community and Family Support Center and the former Army Environmental Center under a single command as a direct reporting unit. = U.S. Army Forces Command = U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) is the largest command in the U.S. Army and the Army's Force Provider to combatant commanders worldwide. FORSCOM combines the contributions of more than 750,000 Army National Guard, Army Reserve and active component Soldiers with those of more than 2,400 Army civilians to form a seamless, winning force that operates as a team across services, components and units. FORSCOM provides relevant and ready land power worldwide, in defense of the nation, at home and abroad. Headquartered at Fort McPherson, FORSCOM trains, mobilizes, deploys, sustains, transforms and reconstitutes combat-ready Army forces capable of responding rapidly to crises worldwide. Using the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process, FORSCOM tailors the resources and training of its units to meet the specific and ever-changing requirements of combatant commanders and, when directed, those of U.S. civil authorities. These requirements can range from fighting the war on terrorism to providing relief to natural disaster victims. FORSCOM reports through two chains of command; as an army command responsible directly to the chief of staff of the Army for the readiness, manning, equipping, training, mobilization and deployment of assigned forces, and as an Army Service Component Command, reporting to Joint Forces Command in Norfolk, Va. In this role, FORSCOM provides Army forces to the joint war fight. FORSCOM units also participate in multinational exercises to build confidence among U.S. allies and friends. The active component of FORSCOM has nearly 200,000 Soldiers stationed nationwide. This number includes three Army corps‚ÄîI Corps at Fort Lewis, Wash.; III Corps at Fort Hood, Texas; and XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, N.C. FORSCOM also has eight divisions, multiple brigade combat teams and a full range of other combat, combat support and combat service support units. First Army at Fort Gillem reports to FORSCOM. It is responsible for the training, readiness, mobilization and deployment support for Army National Guard and Army Reserve units in FORSCOM. It also executes FORSCOM missions within the continental United States and Puerto Rico. Army Reserve units are part of the federal force and make their primary contribution to FORSCOM's combat power by providing support specialties such as medical, civil affairs, public affairs, transportation, maintenance and supply. As such, the Reserve accounts for about 45 percent of the Army's total combat service support strength and about 30 percent of the total combat support units. Many Reserve units are designated to deploy early for contingency operations worldwide. The Army National Guard provides FORSCOM a balanced force of eight National Guard combat divisions, 32 separate brigades and extensive supporting units. The current FORSCOM Army National Guard strength is about 350,000 Soldiers. Mobilizing the Army National Guard into active federal service would bring the total strength of FORSCOM to nearly two-thirds of the Army's combat ground forces. = U.S. Army Reserve Command = The U.S. Army Reserve Command (USARC) has approximately 191,000 U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers and 10,000 DA civilian employees. It commands all U.S. Army Reserve conventional forces in the continental U.S. and Puerto Rico. Units in the Army Reserve have a warfight focus on combat support and combat service support missions for the Total Army and include medical, legal, civil affairs, chemical warfare, transportation, engineering and military police. The USARC was established in October 1990 as a major subordinate command of the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM). In September 1998, the USARC moved from leased facilities into their headquarters building on Fort McPherson. In 2007, the USARC transferred from reporting to FORSCOM to reporting directly to DA. Approximately 900 civilians, contractors and Soldiers work at the headquarters. The USARC provides command, control and support for all Army Reserve troop units in the continental United States. The USARC also ensures the readiness of its force and prepares more than 2,000 Troop Program Units under its command to mobilize in support of joint war-fighting contingencies and operations other than war. Since Sept. 11, 2001, the Army Reserve has mobilized approximately 185,000 Soldiers in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Missions throughout the world where Army Reserve Soldiers are currently providing support include Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, the Balkans and Africa. The Chief, Army Reserve, Washington, D.C., also serves as the commanding general of the U.S. Army Reserve Command. Since 2003, the Army Reserve has taken an aggressive approach to transitioning the force from a strategic environment to an operational force. With BRAC initiatives and transformation, proposed changes will make the Army Reserve more deployable and functional in order to serve America's military needs in the 21st century. Units will be functionally aligned forces that will not only benefit the Army Reserve, but the total military in terms of readiness and responsiveness to operational requirements. Within the United States, Army Reserve Soldiers are actively involved in the homeland defense antiterrorism effort while continuing to provide support to military and federal agencies following natural and man-made disasters. USARC's focus is on training, readiness, mobilization support and providing federal military assistance to other federal agencies. = U.S. Army Central = U.S. Army Central (USARCENT) is committed to supporting the objectives of US Central Command (CENTCOM) in some of the most volatile regions of the globe-the Middle East and South and Central Asia. In 1998, CENTCOM assumed responsibility for Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, in turn broadening USARCENT's mission in this very important region of the world. Assigned as the Army component to CENTCOM, USARCENT is the only Army-level headquarters in the force structure today manned and ready to provide the CENTCOM with a fully deployable, warfighting command and control headquarters anywhere in the world. USARCENT is capable of commanding ground combat forces operating as a joint task force, a coalition joint task force or as an army echelon-above-corps headquarters. During wartime, USARCENT becomes the Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC), responsible for commanding all forces involved in ground operations in its area of responsibility. Since USARCENT beginning as the Third Army in 1918, it has played major roles in America's military history, serving in World Wars I and II, the Persian Gulf War and now the war on terrorism in Afghanistan, Iraq and other parts of the region. Over and over, USARCENT has demonstrated its determination, capabilities and flexibility to deter aggression in different parts of the world. USARCENT does not have a fixed force structure of assigned units. Instead, it has a central reservoir composed of both active and reserve units based throughout the United States from which it may draw forces tailored to specific situations. In short, USARCENT continually customizes packages geared to sustain operation in the region 365 days a year in support of our national security objectives and obligations, filling a vital defense need and complementing USARCENT's rich heritage and proud traditions. Under the leadership of Gen. George S. Patton Jr., the 3rd Army participated in eight major operations in World War II, fighting through France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Austria. After performing Army-of- occupation duty following Germany's surrender, Third Army returned to Atlanta in March 1947. Later that year, it moved to Fort McPherson, where it remained until it inactivated Oct. 1, 1973. In December 1982, Third Army was reactivated in Atlanta and assumed its current mission. Third Army deployed to Saudi Arabia in August 1990 to assume its role as the senior Army headquarters under CENTCOM. At the peak of the build-up, the Third Army command oversaw more than 338,000 coalition forces, including 303,000 U.S. Army soldiers plus British and French ground forces. It was responsible for deploying, receiving and sustaining all Army forces deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1990 and 1991. The headquarters developed the initial defensive plan for Saudi Arabia, and later the offensive ground plan. Following the war, Third Army supervised the relief effort to restore life support facilities in Kuwait and provided protection for Iraqi refugees in southern Iraq. USARCENT plans and executes an intensive schedule of joint and combined exercises in countries throughout the region, including the \\"Intrinsic Action\\" series in Kuwait and the \\"Bright Star\\" series in Egypt. Also, the headquarters manages the pre-positioned equipment program in this region to sustain a rapid response to future crisis. Immediately following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in September 2001, USARCENT began preparing for future operations - the United States invasion of Afghanistan. The command was also heavily involved in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the following Iraq War. = Army Ground Forces Band = The 214th Army Band (The Army Ground Forces Band) was organized in 1845 in Texas as the 4th Infantry Regiment Band. Its heritage, which includes 26 campaign streamers and two awards of the French Croix de Guerre, spans the Mexican War, the American Civil War, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and both World Wars. During the Battle of Monterrey, Mexico, the band captured and turned an artillery battery against the enemy. To commemorate this distinguished service, President Zachary Taylor authorized the band to wear red piping on the uniform, making it the only Army band to receive a combat distinction from a president of the United States. The band fought with the victorious Third Division, which spearheaded the Battle of the Marne in July 1918. Having served in Alaska during World War II, the band participated in the Aleutian Islands operation in May 1943. Following World War II, the 4th Infantry Regiment Band was re-designated the 214th Army Band. Since 1945, this organization has been stationed in Fort Lewis, Washington; Fort Hood, Texas; Fort Meade, Maryland; Fort Richardson, Arkansas; Fort McPherson, Georgia; and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The unit was reassigned as the band for Headquarters, U.S. Army Forces Command, Fort McPherson, in 1973. Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh Jr. conferred the special designation \\"The Army Ground Forces Band\\" in 1985. It was disactivated in 2016. U.S. Army Forces Command is charged with the combat readiness of active and reserve component Army units and the Army Ground Forces Band has been designated as the \\"Musical Ambassador of the American Combat Soldier.\\" The mission of the Army Ground Forces Band is to fulfill the requirements of U.S. Army Forces Command at local, national, and international events by providing musical support for military, state, recruiting and civil functions, formal concerts, and recreational activities. The Army Ground Forces Band consists of a variety of musical ensembles, including the marching band, the concert band, the Jazz Guardians, the Old Flint River Dixieland Band, the rock band \\"The Loose Cannons,\\" and various ceremonial and chamber ensembles. = First Army = First Army is the senior military activity at Fort Gillem. First Army is one of two Continental U.S. Armies in U.S. Army Forces Command. Headquarters, First Army, is staffed by a specialized team of active Army, active Guard and Reserve Soldiers and DA civilian employees. It has an integrated command structure that includes more than 10,000 Active and Reserve Component (RC) Soldiers. First Army's area of operations includes 27 states east of the Mississippi River (including Minnesota), two territories (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and the District of Columbia. Its customer base involves support to more than 350,000 RC Soldiers. First Army's mission centers around the three core functions of training and readiness: support, mobilization of RC forces and homeland defense. First Army enhances the combat readiness of RC Soldiers and units by providing training and readiness support. It facilitates the RC units' ability to execute missions throughout the full spectrum of military operations. This is done by providing observer/controller trainers and maintaining direct contact with RC units. First Army plans, prepares and executes the mobilization and deployment of RC units to provide combat-ready forces to war fighting combatant commanders. It supports presidential reserve call-ups (such as Bosnia, Kosovo and Kuwait) as well as full and partial mobilizations (such as support of homeland defense (HLD)). In fulfilling this responsibility, First Army has mobilized more than 110,000 Army National Guard and Army Reserve troops for Operations Enduring Freedom, Noble Eagle and Iraqi Freedom since the September 11 attacks in 2001. First Army conducts HLD in support of national objectives, as directed. This means First Army is the regional DoD planning agent for military support to civil authorities during a response to natural or manmade disasters. This mission directly supports the Federal Response Plan during disaster relief operations. Normally led by the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate and the Federal Emergency Management Agency and joined by 27 federal agencies, including the American Red Cross, First Army Soldiers and civilian employees are proud of their mission to assist American families during times of crisis. The size of the First Army (and military) response depends upon the magnitude of the event requiring military support. First U.S Army also performs two missions that, while not core functions, are significant in their importance to the Army: management of the Civilian Aides to the Secretary of the Army program and support to the National Boy Scout Jamboree. First Army serves as the higher headquarters for three reserve divisions (training support (TS)): the 85th Division (TS), headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois; the 78th Division (TS), headquartered in Edison, New Jersey; and the 87th Division (TS), headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. The two important missions of training and readiness support and mobilization of RC Soldiers are accomplished through these three divisions. First Army was formed in France on Aug. 10, 1918, with Gen. John J. Pershing commanding. As America's first numbered Army, First Army engaged in two major operations: the reduction of the St. Mihiel Salient, east of Verdun, and the Meuse-Argonne offensive, west of Verdun. After World War I and a short period of occupation in Europe, First Army was deactivated in 1919. It was reactivated at Fort Jay, N.Y., in 1933. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, with Gen. Omar N. Bradley commanding, First Army troops landed on Omaha and Utah beaches in Normandy. First Army established an impressive record of \\"firsts\\" in World War II: First on the beaches of Normandy, first to break out of the Normandy beachhead, first to enter Paris, first to break through the Siegfried Line, first to cross the Rhine River and first to meet the Russians. After World War II, First Army headquarters was located on Governors Island, New York. On January 1, 1966, First and Second Armies merged and First Army headquarters moved to Fort Meade, Maryland. In 1973, First Army transitioned from an active Army-oriented organization to one dedicated to improving the readiness of reserve components. In 1983, another reorganization took place. Second Army was reactivated at Fort Gillem and assumed responsibility for reserve component matters in seven states and two territories formerly assigned to First Army. In 1991, Fourth U.S. Army was deactivated and its seven Midwestern states became part of First Army. In 1995, First and Second Armies were once again consolidated and First Army moved to Fort Gillem. = 52nd Explosives Ordnance Group = The wartime mission of the 52nd Explosives Ordnance Group (EOD) is to conduct force protection operations to defeat or lessen effects of conventional, unconventional (nuclear, biological, chemical or improvised explosive device) and terrorist munitions within its area of operations. Further, the group deploys, redeploys and assumes command and control of up to six ordnance battalions in a theater of operations, supporting the theater commander. At Fort Gillem, the group headquarters commands and controls four battalion headquarters and 39 companies geographically separated throughout the United States. The group also runs the U.S. Army Very Important Persons Protective Service Agency, responsible for joint service coordination and tasking of EOD support to the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. State Department. = Military Entrance Processing Station = The Atlanta Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) is one of a network of 65 MEPS located nationwide and in Puerto Rico. The United States Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) is a joint DoD agency staffed with personnel from all military services that reports directly to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy. Although it is a separate DoD agency, USMEPCOM comprises two geographical sectors and staffed with personnel from all military services. The mission of USMEPCOM and the Atlanta MEPS is to process individuals for enlistment or induction into the armed services based on DoD-approved peacetime and mobilization standards. The Atlanta MEPS performs state-of-the-art testing, medical evaluation and processing for individuals wishing to enter military service. The three primary areas to be considered in determining an applicant's qualifications for enlistment are aptitude for military service, physical qualifications and background evaluation screening. For reasons ranging from adventurism to educational benefits, almost 7,000 young men and women from the Atlanta area were qualified for entry into the five military services through the Atlanta MEPS in fiscal year 2007. In most cases, the term of enlistment in the military service includes specialized job training. When these young men and women complete their service obligation, they return to their local community with valuable skills, disciplined work ethics and on-the-job experience. The current location for the Atlanta MEPS was designed and built specifically for use by the MEPS. With an approximate construction cost of $3.7 million, groundbreaking for the new facility was held August 14, 1997. Personnel from the MEPS began processing applicants from this facility August 30, 1999. The normal tour of duty for military personnel assigned to the station is three years. All personnel assigned to the MEPS have the primary mission of assisting each branch of the military in processing personnel for duty in the U.S. Armed Forces. The Atlanta MEPS has enlistment responsibility for 95 counties in Georgia, including 316 high schools and five strategically located Military Examination Test (MET) sites. Aside from the MEPS located at Fort Gillem, the five MET sites in the state of Georgia area offer aptitude testing to applicants near their homes, which eliminates unnecessary applicant travel. Those sites are located in Athens, Columbus, Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Macon and Robins Air Force Base. As with any business, the Atlanta MEPS has considerable operating overhead which directly benefits the local business community. The Atlanta MEPS' paid contracts and services during the fiscal year 2007 were more than $4 million. = Headquarters, 3d Military Police Group (CID) = The 3d Military Police Group (Criminal Investigation Division)(3d MP Group (CID)) is a tactical headquarters located at Fort Gillem. The mission of the 3d MP Group (CID) and its four organic battalions is to provide a full range of criminal investigative support and services for commanders, installations and other areas of Army interest in the 28 states east of the Mississippi, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Central and South America and the Caribbean. It also is responsible for providing criminal investigative support to all Army interests within the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) area of responsibility (AOR). USCENTCOM's AOR comprises the 25 countries in Southwest Asia (Northern Red Sea Region, South and Central Asia, Arabian Peninsula, Iraq and the Horn of Africa). Investigative support to this operational theater includes: criminal investigations of felony crimes, logistical security, criminal intelligence assessments, personal security protection for DoD officials and visiting foreign dignitaries, force protection and safeguarding of critical resources in peacetime, combat and contingency operations. The group also works with other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies and uses the latest equipment, systems and investigative techniques. The 3d MP Group (CID) is organized into a command group and seven staff divisions, including personnel and administration, operations, logistics, resource management, staff judge advocate, information management and Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment. The group exercises command and control of 35 subordinate units. These units support key Army field elements, including: XVIII Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, N.C.; the 101st Air Assault Division101st Air Assault Division (Light), Fort Campbell, Ky.; the Third Infantry Division, Fort Stewart; the 10th Mountain Division (Light), Fort Drum, N.Y.; and Third Army (ARCENT). The 3d MP Group (CID) is also responsible for providing support for various major commands in their area, including: DA, U.S. Army Forces Command, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Southern Command, U.S. Joint Forces Command and U.S. Special Operations Command. = U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory = The US Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIL) provides forensic laboratory services to DoD investigative agencies and other federal law enforcement agencies. USACIL also operates an army school to train forensic laboratory examiners and manages the U.S. Criminal Investigation Command criminalistics program. USACIL is the DoD forensic laboratory with the most extensive range of capabilities to support all defense criminal investigation organizations worldwide. The laboratory is equipped for analysis in multiple forensic disciplines. USACIL performs forensic analysis in support of criminal investigations in the laboratory, at crime scenes or deployed into combat theaters. USACIL examiners routinely present expert testimony in criminal trials around the globe. From 2007‚Äì2011, the lab underwent scrutiny for a series of instances of personnel misconduct and allegations of poor investigative work.Taylor, Marisa, \\"Beyond Missteps, Military Crime Lab Roils With Discontent\\", McClatchy News Wire, 26 June 2011. = Southeastern Army Reserve Intelligence Support Center = The Southeastern Army Reserve Intelligence Support Center (Language Lab) at Fort Gillem provides battle-focused intelligence training support to improve reserve component technical intelligence skills, proficiency and readiness. The center augments the total force's intelligence and linguistic capabilities and supports multi-service reserve component intelligence personnel and units in satisfying requirements of warfighters and national intelligence agencies. = United States Army 2nd Recruiting Brigade = The U.S. Army 2nd Recruiting Brigade, headquartered at Fort Gillem, directs the efforts of nine recruiting battalions located throughout the southeastern United States. The battalions under the U.S. Army 2nd Recruiting Brigade are located in Smyrna, Ga.; Columbia, S.C.; Jackson, Miss.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Miami, Fla.; Tampa, Fla.; Montgomery, Ala.; Nashville, Tenn.; and Raleigh, N.C. Headquarters functions include command management, administration, operations, liaison, program budget and accounting logistics, advertising and public affairs for operation of the brigade headquarters and its recruiting battalions. = Atlanta Distribution Center ‚Äì Army and Air Force Exchange Service = The Army and Air Force Exchange Service Atlanta Distribution Center (ADC) mission is twofold: to receive, store and distribute retail, cost, food and expense merchandise to primary customers in the Southeastern United States and to receive, store and distribute specialized merchandise‚Äîmusic, video, jewelry, military clothing, catalog, books and magazines‚Äîto customers worldwide. The ADC completed construction of a facility next to four existing buildings at Fort Gillem in the spring of 1999, making it one of the most modern facilities of its kind. = U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine = The U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM) mission is to provide worldwide health promotion and preventive medicine leadership and services to identify, assess and counter environmental, occupational and disease threats to the health, fitness and readiness of America's Army, the Army community and the Army civilian workforce. The unit's lineage can be traced back over 50 years to the Army Industrial Hygiene Laboratory, established at the beginning of World War II and, under the direct jurisdiction of The Army Surgeon General, conducted occupational health surveys of Army-operated industrial plants, arsenals and depots. These surveys were aimed at identifying and eliminating occupational health hazards within the DoD's industrial production base and proved to be of great benefit to the nation's war effort. The more than 1,000-person USACHPPM team is a linchpin of medical support to combat forces and of the military managed-care system. It provides worldwide scientific expertise and services in clinical and field preventive medicine, environmental and occupational health, health promotion and wellness, epidemiology and disease surveillance, toxicology and related laboratory sciences. Professional disciplines represented include chemists, physicists, engineers, physicians, optometrists, epidemiologists, audiologists, nurses, industrial hygienists, toxicologists and entomologists, as well as sub-specialties within these professions. The USACHPPM headquarters is located at the South Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md. Five regional subordinate commands are located at Fort George G. Meade, Md.; Fort Lewis, Wash.; Landstuhl, Germany; Camp Zama, Japan; and Fort McPherson, Ga. Located in Building 180 on Fort McPherson, USACHPPM-South is responsible for providing preventive medicine services and training to the southeast region of the continental U.S. The unit consists of five divisions: entomological sciences, field preventive medicine, industrial hygiene, quality management support and environmental health engineering. USACHPPM-South can request additional support in other, more specialized areas from its headquarters to support its regional customers. USACHPPM-South is in the process of relocating to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, and expects to complete this move by September 30, 2009. At Fort Sam Houston, USACHPPM-South will continue to provide \\"cutting edge\\" public health services to all DoD entities (both active and reserve components) in the southeast region of the continental United States.  History of Fort McPherson  = Origins = 200px Situated on and located four miles (6 km) southwest of the center of Atlanta, Fort McPherson is rich in military tradition as an army post dating back to 1867. It was during that year that a post was established in west Atlanta on the grounds where Spelman College is now located. Between the years 1867 and 1881, the post was garrisoned in turn by elements of the 2nd, 16th and 18th U.S. Infantry Regiments and the 5th Artillery. Their mission was to enforce Union regulations during the reconstruction period following the Civil War. In October 1881, Secretary of War Robert T. Lincoln directed that the lease of the site be surrendered and the buildings sold at public auction. In compliance with this directive, McPherson Barracks was abandoned by U.S. troops Dec. 8, 1881. Part of the site was purchased by the American Baptist Missionary Society for use by the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary, which later became Spelman College. The U.S. Treasury realized $17,264.40 from the sale of the buildings. March 3, 1885, Congress passed the Sundry Civil Bill, which contained an initial sum of $15,000 for the purchase of land and the erection of a 10-company post. The task of site selection went to Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock, commanding general of the Division of the Atlantic. Five tracts of land amounting to were purchased in September 1885. Capt. Joshua W. Jacobs, assistant quartermaster, was responsible for developing and implementing the first master plan for the post. That same year, Maj. Gen. John A. Schofield, chief of staff, suggested the new post be formally named in honor of Maj. Gen. James Birdseye McPherson. During the Civil War, McPherson participated in the Battles of Jackson and Vicksburg earning promotion to brigadier general. In 1864 he was in command of one of the Three Armies under the Major General William T. Sherman's Military Division of the Mississippi. He was killed while on a reconnaissance patrol during the Battle of Atlanta July 22, 1864. He is the highest-ranking officer to have been killed by position in the history of the United States, He commanded the Union Army of the Tennessee. US Army Engineers built a monument to him on the site he was killed in 1888, in East Atlanta and maintained to this day by the Sons of Union Veterans of the American Civil War, SUVCW. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Fort McPherson served as a general hospital and as a recruit training center for nearly 20,000 men. Barracks were filled to overflowing and emergency tents were set up. It later became a prisoner of war (POW) facility, and by the end of July 1898, 16 Spanish Army prisoners were incarcerated in what is now the Post Chapel. = World War I = Interned German sailors in Fort McPherson, 1918 During World War I, Fort McPherson was selected to be an internment camp for German POWs; a base hospital, General Hospital No. 6; and the site of an officers' training camp. Immediately to the west of the post, across Campbellton Road, a war prison barracks was established to confine German POWs. The prison camp reached a peak population of 1,411 in July 1918. The secretary of war directed that the permanent barracks of Fort McPherson be made available for general or base hospital use June 23, 1917. The command of the post was turned over to the ranking medical officer and Fort McPherson transformed itself into a general hospital with a capacity of nearly 2,400 beds. It is estimated that more than 10,000 patients were admitted from August 1917 until December 1918. Fort McPherson served as the headquarters for the IV Corps Area from 1920 until 1923 and 1927 until 1934. In the 1930s, the post hospital was greatly expanded to serve as a rehabilitation center and the post served as the headquarters for District B of the Civilian Conservation Corps. = World War II = With the passage of the 1940 Selective Service Act and the outbreak of World War II, Fort McPherson activities were greatly expanded. In addition to serving as a general depot, a reception center was established to process thousands of men for entry into the service and the post again served as a major hospital center. In August 1945, as World War II ended, the United States War Department reversed the flow of work at the induction center. Fort McPherson became a separation center for almost 200,000 Soldiers and processed countless others for reassignment. = Historic buildings = The historic district of the post sits on of land. The 40 buildings that comprise the historic district are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Some of those buildings and their histories are:  Hodges Hall  Hodges Hall, (Building 65) the post headquarters, was built in 1904 as a double barracks at a cost of $55,000. It has a distinctive horseshoe shape and is a departure from the interval between the other barracks. This building is named in honor of Gen. Courtney Hodges, commander of Third United States Army and First United States Army during World War II. Today, this facility houses the offices of the garrison commander and staff.  Troop Row  Construction of Troop Row began in 1889 at the east end with Building 56. All of the buildings are double barracks except Building 60, in the center, which is a triple barracks. The average cost of these buildings was $26,000. The Audie Murphy Barracks Complex opened in 1998, replacing the use of the barracks. The Troop Row barracks have been converted to office space.  Post Chapel  The chapel(Building 42) was built between 1886 and 1889 as the post guardhouse. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, this building served as a place of confinement for 16 POWs. In 1921, pews, 11 stained-glass windows and four stained-glass transoms were added to the structure when it was converted into a chapel.  Hospital  The original post hospital, General Hospital No. 6 (Buildings 170 and 171 ), was built between 1886 and 1889 at a cost of $11,414. During World War I, the hospital was so important that the senior ranking medical officer commanded the post. Between August 1917 and December 1918, more than 10,000 Soldiers were admitted. During both world wars, many of the surrounding buildings, including Troop Row, were used as hospital wards. In 1977, the hospital became a clinic and the majority of the building was converted to administrative space. In January 1998, the Lawrence Joel United States Army Health and Dental Clinic was dedicated and opened in Building 125. Building 170 and 171 house Installation Management Command, Southeast Region, headquarters.  Public safety  Construction was completed on Buildings 100,101 and 102 in 1898, 1893 and 1889, respectively. The first two were storehouses for the commissary and the quartermaster, while Building 102 was the post bakery. The bakery contained three rooms and two ovens to bake bread. At one time, tokens were used, evidently as a means of ration control. These small tokens were redeemable for one loaf of bread. Today, these buildings are used by the Office of Public Safety, which houses the Chief, Directorate of Emergency Services and his staff.  Chapel Center  Construction was completed on this facility (Building 51) in 1893 at a reported cost of $13,000. The main floor provided rooms for the officer and sergeant of the guard, the noncommissioned officers of the guard force and the members of the guard itself. Space was also provided for a prison room, with two cages for prisoners, six single cells for garrison prisoners and water closets for both the prisoners and the guards. This one-story brick building was the guardhouse and the post prison. In 1949, it was converted to the Central Telephone Exchange for the post. Today, it houses the post chaplain and staff.  Print Plant  This building (Building 50) was built in 1918 as the post firehouse. It had a capacity of one truck and seven beds. The brickwork covering the old vehicle entrance in the front can still be seen under the small portico. In 1941, it was converted into the post office and used in that capacity until December 2002.  Recreation Center  Built in 1918 by the Red Cross as a convalescent center for hospital patients, this building (Building 46) was built in the shape of a Maltese cross. In 1919, the building was taken over by the Army and converted into a service club. Today, it is used as office space, a meeting area and more.  Pershing Hall  The original and present-day bachelor officers' quarters (Building 16) was completed in 1904. This facility was originally given the number 16 to incorporate the structure with the numbering system for the 19 sets of quarters on Staff Row, numbered 1 through 20, which is the reason why there is no number 16 on Staff Row. This building was named in honor of General of the Armies of the United States John \\"Blackjack\\" Pershing. During his career, Pershing served as the commander-in-chief of the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I and later as the Army chief of staff.  Van Horn Hall  Completed in 1889 as the original post headquarters, this two-story structure (Building 41) contained office space for the commander, adjutant, sergeant major, clerks, library, mail and court martial room. In 1891, the first rental of a telephone line to Atlanta for $12.50 a month was authorized. In 1893, $17 was approved for material and labor to install electric bells and connections in the building to facilitate communication and the transaction of business in the headquarters. Thus, the first known \\"intercom\\" system was installed on post. This building was named in honor of Brig. Gen. Robert O. Van Horn, who served as post commander from January 1934 until August 1940. This six-and-a-half-year period is the longest post commander's tour in the installation's history. In 1957, the building became office space for the staff judge advocate.  Staff Row  File:Staff Row at Fort McPherson.jpgHistoric photo of Staff Row, Fort McPherson, Ga. File:Staff Row.jpgDior Butler, Fort McPherson, Ga. Staff Row consists of 19 officer quarters ‚Äî four single-family residences and 15 duplexes. These quarters were built from 1891 until 1910 at an average cost of $15,000. The original concept for Staff Row was to build homes for the officers of an artillery regiment with 10 batteries. At full strength, such a unit would be authorized a colonel, a lieutenant colonel, three majors, 10 captains, 20 first lieutenants and 10 second lieutenants. The final home built on Staff Row in 1910 is currently the residence of the post commander. The small lot required that Quarters 18 also be a single-family unit.  Hedekin Field  Staff Row faces the post parade ground, Hedekin Field. Originally a polo field, it is named in honor of Capt. David Drew Hedekin, an avid polo player who commanded Headquarters Company here from 1936 through 1938. Hedekin was fatally injured while playing in a polo tournament at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, July 17, 1938. He died there July 20, 1938. A monument to Capt. Hedekin is located on the edge of the parade field across from Quarters 10. Today, Hedekin Field is the site of colorful parades, retirement ceremonies and other special celebrations.  Quarters 10  File:Quarters10, Fort McPherson.jpgQuarters 10, Fort McPherson, Ga. Quarters 10 is the centerpiece of Staff Row. Completed in 1892, the three- story home has -high ceilings on the first floor, -high ceilings on the second, and semicircular front windows in the turret. In 1925, Gen. Douglas MacArthur was assigned to Fort McPherson as post commander. Since his wife refused to live in the quarters, they rented an apartment downtown near the Fox Theatre. The MacArthurs left after having spent 89 days at Fort McPherson, when he was reassigned to Baltimore. A sleeping porch was added to the back of the quarters in 1935 for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's visits while he was en route to Warm Springs, Georgia.  Other structures  For a short time, German POWs were held on Troop Row. In June 1917, they constructed the war prison barracks located just west of the post between Campbellton Road and Venetian Drive. By June 1919, 1,346 prisoners were interned at Fort McPherson. Many homes located west of the post were later built on the cement slab foundations left behind after the prison barracks were torn down in late 1919. The oldest structure still in use at Fort McPherson is located on Miller Drive. Quarters 532 was built in 1887 at a cost of $2,470. The single-family dwelling has of space. It was originally the residence of the civilian post engineer, a plumber, who was in charge of operating the water pump station. Chief Warrant Officer Ulie H. Jeffers, chief field clerk, lived in these quarters from 1923 through 1950. This period of 27 years probably established a record for the continuous occupancy of a set of Army quarters by one individual. The home was later inhabited by the commander, Intelligence Support Element Ft. McPherson (513th MI Bde), Army Captain Steven S. Walsky and family; and appropriately, finally by Chief Warrant Officer Clyde Green, the last Vietnam War draftee to remain on active duty (retired in 2010).

It is a salt composed of the sodium cation and the azanide anion. This solid, which is dangerously reactive toward water, is white, but commercial samples are typically gray due to the presence of small quantities of metallic iron from the manufacturing process. Such impurities do not usually affect the utility of the reagent. NaNH2 conducts electricity in the fused state, its conductance being similar to that of NaOH in a similar state. NaNH2 has been widely employed as a strong base in organic synthesis. Preparation and structure Sodium amide can be prepared by the reaction of sodium with ammonia gas, but it is usually prepared by the reaction in liquid ammonia using iron(III) nitrate as a catalyst. The reaction is fastest at the boiling point of the ammonia, c. ‚àí33 ¬∞C. An electride, [Na(NH3)6]+e‚àí, is formed as a reaction intermediate. :2 Na + 2 NH3 ‚Üí 2 NaNH2 \\\\+ H2 NaNH2 is a salt-like material and as such, crystallizes as an infinite polymer. The geometry about sodium is tetrahedral. In ammonia, NaNH2 forms conductive solutions, consistent with the presence of Na(NH3)6+ and NH2‚àí ions. Uses Sodium amide is mainly used as a strong base in organic chemistry, often in liquid ammonia solution. It is the reagent of choice for the drying of ammonia (liquid or gaseous). One of the main advantages to the use of sodium amide is that it mainly functions as a nucleophile. In the industrial production of indigo, sodium amide is a component of the highly basic mixture that induces cyclisation of N-phenylglycine. The reaction produces ammonia, which is recycled typically.L. Lange, W. Treibel \\"Sodium Amide\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Pfleger's synthesis of indigo dye. =Dehydrohalogenation= Sodium amide induces the loss of two equivalents of hydrogen bromide from a vicinal dibromoalkane to give a carbon-carbon triple bond, as in a preparation of phenylacetylene. Usually two equivalents of sodium amide yields the desired alkyne. Three equivalents are necessary in the preparation of a terminal alkynes because the terminal CH of the resulting alkyne protonates an equivalent amount of base. 300px Hydrogen chloride and ethanol can also be eliminated in this way, as in the preparation of 1-ethoxy-1-butyne. 500px =Cyclization reactions= Where there is no Œ≤-hydrogen to be eliminated, cyclic compounds may be formed, as in the preparation of methylenecyclopropane below. 400px Cyclopropenes, aziridines and cyclobutanes may be formed in a similar manner. =Deprotonation of carbon and nitrogen acids= Carbon acids which can be deprotonated by sodium amide in liquid ammonia include terminal alkynes, methyl ketones, cyclohexanone, phenylacetic acid and its derivatives and diphenylmethane. Acetylacetone loses two protons to form a dianion. Sodium amide will also deprotonate indole and piperidine. =Related non- nucleophilic bases= It is however poorly soluble in solvents other than ammonia. Its use has been superseded by the related reagents sodium hydride, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (NaHMDS), and lithium diisopropylamide (LDA). =Other reactions= *Rearrangement with orthodeprotonation *Oxirane synthesis *Indole synthesis *Chichibabin reaction Safety Sodium amide reacts violently with water to produce ammonia and sodium hydroxide and will burn in air to give oxides of sodium and nitrogen dioxide. :NaNH2 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí NH3 \\\\+ NaOH :4 NaNH2 \\\\+ 7 O2 ‚Üí 2 Na2O + 4 NO2 \\\\+ 4 H2O In the presence of limited quantities of air and moisture, such as in a poorly closed container, explosive mixtures of peroxides may form. This is accompanied by a yellowing or browning of the solid. As such, sodium amide is to be stored in a tightly closed container, under an atmosphere of an inert gas. Sodium amide samples which are yellow or brown in color represent explosion risks.

Each year the Winnipeg Folk Festival showcases local Manitoba talent including Begonia, Boniface, The Bros. Landreth, John K. Samson, Leonard Sumner, Living Hour, Richard Inman, Roger Roger, Royal Canoe, William Prince and more. Workshops are a big part of the folk festival culture providing the audience with a unique opportunity to see artists play together on the same stage that they could never see anywhere else. These workshops allow anywhere from two to five artists or bands on a stage to jam together for an hour. The festival offers award-winning family programming for children and families including incredible children's performers, an arts and crafts area, a field full of activities and a reading tent to wind down. Children aged 12 and under are admitted to the festival for free. Each year on the Friday of the festival young performers aged 14 to 24 take over the Shady Grove stage to perform as a part of the organizations Young Performers Program. The Young Performers Program was created to give young artist from across Canada the opportunity to learn about music and the industry from artists in the festival's main lineup. After the young performers spend Wednesday and Thursday learning from seasoned artists they have the opportunity to play for a festival audience on Friday at Shady Grove stage. = Hear All Year Concert Series = The Winnipeg Folk Festival expanded to include music throughout the year taking place at various theatres in Winnipeg. Through this concert series the organization brings new artists to the city and brings back festival artists from years past.  Experience  In addition to music, the Winnipeg Folk Festival offers two campgrounds, a wide variety of food vendors, a Hand-Made Village, art installations on the festival site and in the Festival Campground. = Camping = There are two campgrounds available to festival attendees. The Festival Campground is home to 6,000 people over the festival weekend, hosts a select group of food vendors, is the backdrop to several art installations and includes an unserviced RV area. The Quiet Campground is more spacious with about 2,000 people and farther away from the festival creating a quieter more serene environment with a quiet time is in effect between 11:00 pm and 7:00 am. = Food Vendors = The Winnipeg Folk Festival offers a lineup of around 30 food vendors that offer LOFT (local, organic and fair trade) foods for attendees as well as vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options. Vendors are available to attendees in the food village located near the centre of the festival site as well as in both taverns and Festival Campground attendees have access to a select few vendors in the Festival Campground. The organization ensures that all vendors use compostable cutlery, packaging and dishware to reduce waste entering the landfill. = Hand-Made Village = Located near the centre of the festival site is the Hand-Made Village where 40+ artisans from across Canada come together to sell hand-made instruments, clothing, art, crafts, toys, homeware and jewelry. = Prairie Outdoor Exhibition = Art can be found throughout the festival site thanks to the Prairie Outdoor Exhibition which is an outdoor art gallery dedicated to showcasing visual works of art created through different mediums, such as stage murals, sculptures and print-making. = Art and Animation Program = The Festival Campground offers even more art through the Art & Animation Program. This program involves projects made by the community for the community. Artists apply with an idea for a structure, performance piece or group activity and with the support of the organization they bring these ideas to life in the Festival Campground.  Volunteering  The Winnipeg Folk Festival has nearly 50 crews that are run by over 2,800 volunteers each year. Volunteers work 16‚Äì20 hours for festival crews (and a minimum of 40 hours for year-round crews). Volunteers receive a four-day festival pass with backstage access which includes complimentary meals throughout the weekend, a crew t-shirt, free bus transportation and a private volunteer party on Sunday night.  Environmental Sustainability  Birds Hill Provincial Park is home to the annual Winnipeg Folk Festival and the organization manages the environmental impact to the site in several ways. The organization uses industrial composting which allows meat, bones and dairy to be composted as well as other food scraps. Food vendors are required to use compostable plates, cutlery, napkins and packaging and the taverns serve beverages in compostable cups. In 2012, Winnipeg Folk Festival was certified as a fair trade event by Fair Trade Manitoba. Food vendors are encouraged to offer LOFT (Local, Organic, Fair Trade), vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free food options. On the Friday of the festival the backstage kitchen goes vegetarian for the day offering only vegetarian options to volunteers, staff artists and guests. The recycling initiative for the festival began in 1989 and recycling bins can be found throughout the festival site and Festival Campground. The volunteer Enviro Crews work hard to ensure waste is going into the correct bins as well as sorting waste in the Festival Campground throughout the weekend. Free bus services both from downtown Winnipeg and around Birds Hill Provincial Park are available to attendees. Since 2014 the Winnipeg Folk Festival has been a bottled water free festival. Attendees are encouraged to bring reusable water bottles and fill them up at one of the many taps throughout the festival site and Festival Campground. The festival was the first event in Canada to be certified by The Eco-Logo Program as an environmentally-friendly event. In 2018 the organization was presented with The Clearwater Award by Folk Alliance International which is given to a festival that prioritizes environmental stewardship and demonstrates public leadership in sustainable event production.  Accessibility  The Winnipeg Folk Festival works with an Accessibility Advisory Group to provide accessibility services for attendees who require assistance and are equipped with an accessibility plan and accessible customer service policy. Accessibility services include accessibility passes that provide free admission to support persons helping someone with a disability to attend the Festival, accessible seating areas, accessible port-a-potties, wheelchair charging stations, sign language interpretation offered at select stages, service animals are welcome and accessible camping areas.  Indigenous Initiatives  The Winnipeg Folk Festival takes place on Treaty 1 Territory and the homeland of the M√©tis people. The Winnipeg Folk Festival works with an Indigenous Advisory Committee to ensure that Indigenous voices and culture are shared with Manitobans through engagement, education and celebration of Indigenous art, song, ceremony and storytelling. The festival begins with an opening blessing from a Knowledge Keeper from the Indigenous community. Indigenous artists from our lineup, Prairie Outdoor Exhibition and Hand-Made Village take part in a welcoming ceremony which includes prayer, song and a tribute to the land we are on.

NSIDC archives and distributes digital and analog snow and ice data and also maintains information about snow cover, avalanches, glaciers, ice sheets, freshwater ice, sea ice, ground ice, permafrost, atmospheric ice, paleoglaciology, and ice cores. NSIDC is part of the University of Colorado Boulder Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), and is affiliated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Geophysical Data Center through a cooperative agreement. NSIDC serves as one of twelve Distributed Active Archive Centers funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to archive and distribute data from NASA's past and current satellites and field measurement programs. NSIDC also supports the National Science Foundation through the Exchange For Local Observations and Knowledge of the Arctic (ELOKA) and other scientific research grants. NSIDC is also a member of the ICSU World Data System. Mark Serreze is the director of NSIDC. History The World Data Center (WDC) for Glaciology, Boulder, a data center responsible for archiving all available glaciological information, was established at the American Geographical Society under Dr. William O. Field, Director, in 1957. Between 1971 and 1976 it was operated by the U.S. Geological Survey, Glaciology Project Office, under the direction of Dr. Mark F. Meier. In 1976, responsibility for the WDC for Glaciology was transferred to NOAA, Environmental Data and Information Service (EDIS), and the center moved to the University of Colorado at Boulder under the direction of Professor Roger G. Barry. In 1982, NOAA created the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) as a means to expand the WDC holdings and as a place to archive data from some NOAA programs. In the 1980s and 1990s, support to NSIDC widened with NASA funding for the Snow and Ice Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) and NSF funding to manage selected Arctic and Antarctic data and metadata. =Milestones= * 1957-58: First International Geophysical Year * 1957: U.S. National Committee for the IGY awards the operation of WDC-A for Glaciology to the American Geographical Society * 1970: WDC for Glaciology transfers from the American Geographical Society to the U.S. Geological Survey in Tacoma, Washington * 1976: WDC for Glaciology transfers from the U.S. Geological Survey in Tacoma, Washington to the University of Colorado at Boulder, Colorado under the direction of Roger Barry * 1982: NOAA designates the National Snow and Ice Data Center * 1983: NSIDC receives grant from NASA for archiving Nimbus 7 passive microwave data * 1990: NSIDC receives funding from NSF for Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Data Coordination Center (ADCC) * 1993: NSIDC receives first DAAC contract * 1996: Antarctic Data Coordination Center (ADCC) established with NSF support * 1999: Antarctic Glaciological Data Center (AGDC) established with NSF support * 2001: NSIDC celebrates its 25th Anniversary * 2002: Frozen Ground Data Center established with International Arctic Research Center (IARC) support * 2003: Full suite of Earth Observing System (EOS) cryospheric sensors (AMSR, GLAS, MODIS) in orbit * 2009: Mark Serreze named NSIDC director International interactions International science and data management programs facilitate the free exchange of data and accelerate research aimed at understanding the role of the cryosphere in the Earth system. NSIDC contributes to a number of international programs. Most of these programs, only a few of which are mentioned here, fall under the aegis of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). NSIDC scientists participate in International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), International Association of Cryospheric Sciences (IACS), and in activities of the International Permafrost Association (IPA), the Global Digital Sea Ice Data Bank (GDSIDB), and the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), including Climate and Cryosphere (CliC), Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX), the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). Former NSIDC Director, Roger G. Barry, was co-Vice Chair of the WCRP CliC Scientific Steering Group until 2005, and was a member of the GCOS/Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) Terrestrial Observation Panel for Climate through 2007. Research Researchers at NSIDC investigate the dynamics of Antarctic ice shelves, new techniques for the remote sensing of snow and freeze/thaw cycle of soils, the role of snow in hydrologic modeling, linkages between changes in sea ice extent and weather patterns, large-scale shifts in polar climate, river and lake ice, and the distribution and characteristics of seasonally and permanently frozen ground. In-house scientists pursue their work as part of the CIRES Cryospheric and Polar Process Division, University of Colorado Boulder. NSIDC also monitors Arctic and Antarctic sea ice in near real time, and regularly posts sea ice extent data and analysis on its Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis page. Local and traditional knowledge A research project of the NSIDC is the Exchange For Local Observations and Knowledge of the Arctic or ELOKA. It is a collaborative international effort that was launched during the 2007-2009 International Polar Year. ELOKA facilitates the collection, preservation, exchange, and use of local observations and knowledge of the Arctic. Data management and user support is provided by ELOKA while it fosters collaboration between resident Arctic experts and visiting researchers. By working together, Arctic residents and researchers have made significant contributions in our understanding of the Arctic and recent changes to it. A key challenge of local and traditional knowledge (LTK) research and community-based monitoring is having an effective and appropriate means of recording, storing, and managing data and information. There is also the issue of finding an effective means of making such data available to Arctic residents and researchers, as well as other interested groups such as teachers, students, and decision makers. Without a network and data management system to support LTK and community-based research, a number of problems have arisen. ELOKA aims to fill this gap.

It was composed in 1910 and performed for the first time on 10 September that year at Gloucester Cathedral for the Three Choirs Festival. Vaughan Williams himself conducted and the composition proved to be a major success.Alain Frogley: Liner Notes, UPC 094638215721. 2007. He revised the work twice, in 1913 and 1919. Performances generally run between 14 and 16 minutes. The work takes its name from the original composer of the melody, Thomas Tallis (c. 1505 ‚Äì 1585). Many of Vaughan Williams' works are associated with or inspired by the music of the English Renaissance. In 1906 Vaughan Williams included Tallis's Third Mode Melody in the English Hymnal, which he was then editing, as the melody for Joseph Addison's hymn When Rising from the Bed of Death. The tune is in Double Common Meter (D.C.M. or C.M.D.). Horatius Bonar's hymn I heard the Voice of Jesus Say and many other D.C.M. hymns may also be sung to this tune. Composition The work is scored for an expanded string orchestra divided into three parts: orchestra I, a full-sized string orchestra; orchestra II, a single desk from each section (ideally placed apart from Orchestra I); and a string quartet. Vaughan Williams made this configuration resemble an organ in sound, with the quartet representing the swell division, orchestra II the choir division, and orchestra I the great division. The score specifies that the second orchestra should be placed apart from the first. This spacing emphasizes, on several occasions, the way that the second orchestra echoes the first orchestra. In structure this piece resembles the Elizabethan-age \\"fantasy.\\" The theme is heard in its entirety three times during the course of the work, but the music grows from the theme's constituent motives or fragments, with variations upon them. A secondary melody, based on the original, is first heard on the solo viola about a third of the way into the Fantasia, and this theme forms the climax of the work about five minutes before the end. Vaughan Williams quoted the theme of this work in his 1951 opera The Pilgrim's Progress. The original 1567 theme Tallis's original tuneThe original tune, performed by the Tallis Scholars on the album Tallis: The Complete English Anthems (1986, Gimell Records) is in the Phrygian mode and was one of the nine he contributed to the Psalter of 1567 for the Archbishop of Canterbury, Matthew Parker. When Vaughan Williams edited the English Hymnal of 1906, he also included this melody (number 92). Parker's original words were: :Why fumeth in sight: The Gentils spite, : In fury raging stout? :Why taketh in hond: The people fond, : Vayne thinges to bring about? :The kinges arise: The lordes devise, : In counsayles mett thereto: :Agaynst the Lord: With false accord, : Against his Christ they go. : ‚Äî ‚Äî Archbishop Parker's Psalter (1567) In popular culture Listeners of the UK classical music radio station Classic FM have regularly voted the piece into the top five of the station's \\"Hall of Fame\\", an annual poll of the most popular classical music works.

It was named by Robert Brown in 1811, after Charles Alston (1685‚Äì1760), professor of botany at Edinburgh from 1716-1760. The type species Alstonia scholaris (L.) R.Br. was originally named Echites scholaris by Linnaeus in 1767. Description Alstonia consists of about 40-60 species (according to different authors), native to tropical and subtropical Africa, Central America, southeast Asia, Polynesia and Australia, with most species in the Malesian region. These trees can grow very large, such as Alstonia pneumatophora, recorded with a height of 60 m and a diameter of more than 2 m. Alstonia longifolia is the only species growing in Central America (mainly shrubs, but also trees 20 m high). The leathery, sessile, simple leaves are elliptical, ovate, linear or lanceolate and wedge-shaped at the base. The leaf blade is dorsiventral, medium-sized to large and disposed oppositely or in a whorl and with entire margin. The leaf venation is pinnate, with numerous veins ending in a marginal vein. Phyllotaxy is whorled i.e. two or more leaves arises at a node and form a whorl . The inflorescence is terminal or axillary, consisting of thyrsiform cymes or compound umbels. The small, more or less fragrant flowers are white, yellow, pink or green and funnel-shaped, growing on a pedicel and subtended by bracts. They consist of 5 petals and 5 sepals, arranged in four whorls. The fertile flowers are hermaphrodite. The gamosepalous green sepals consist of ovate lobes, and are distributed in one whorl. The annular disk is hypogynous. The five gamesepalous petals have oblong or ovate lobes and are disposed in one whorl. The corolla lobes overlapping to the left (such as A. rostrata) or to the right (such as A. macrophylla) in the bud. The ovary has 2 separate follicles with glabrous or ciliate, oblong seeds that develop into deep blue podlike, schizocarp fruit, between 7‚Äì40 cm long. The plants contain a milky latex, rich in poisonous alkaloids. The Alstonia macrophylla is commonly known in Sri Lanka as 'Havari nuga' or the 'wig banyan' because of its distinct flower that looks like a woman's long wig. Alstonia trees are used in traditional medicine. The bark of the Alstonia constricta and the Alstonia scholaris is a source of a remedy against malaria, toothache, rheumatism and snake bites. The latex is used in treating coughs, throat sores and fever. Many Alstonia species are commercial timbers, called pule or pulai in Indonesia and Malaysia. Trees from the section Alstonia produce light timber, while those from the sections Monuraspermum and Dissuraspermum produce heavy timber. Alstonia trees are widespread and mostly not endangered. However a few species are very rare, such as A. annamensis, A. beatricis, A. breviloba, A. stenophylla and A. guangxiensis. Species Alstonia has five distinct sections, each a monophyletic group; Alstonia, Blaberopus, Tonduzia, Monuraspermum, Dissuraspermum. ;Accepted species # Alstonia actinophylla (A.Cunn.)

The phrase analogizes that feeling of annoyance as a pet animal that one does not wish to give up, despite its objective lack of importance. Origin of the concept The noun peeve, meaning an annoyance, is believed to have originated in the United States early in the twentieth century, derived by back-formation from the adjective peevish, meaning \\"ornery or ill-tempered\\", which dates from the late 14th-century. The term pet peeve was introduced to a wide readership in the single-panel comic strip The Little Pet Peeve in the Chicago Tribune during the period 1916‚Äì1920. The strip was created by cartoonist Frank King, who also created the long-running Gasoline Alley strip. King's \\"little pet peeves\\" were humorous critiques of generally thoughtless behaviors and nuisance frustrations. Examples included people reading the inter-titles in silent films aloud, cracking an egg only to smell that it's gone rotten, back-seat drivers, and rugs that keep catching the bottom of the door and bunching up. King's readers submitted topics, including theater goers who unwrap candy in crinkly paper during a live performance, and (from a 12 year old boy) having his mother come in to sweep when he has the pieces of a building toy spread out on the floor. Current usage and examples Pet peeves often involve specific behaviors of someone close, such as a spouse or significant other. These behaviors may involve disrespect, manners, personal hygiene, relationships, and family issues. A key aspect of a pet peeve is that it may well seem acceptable or insignificant to others, while the person is likewise not bothered by things that might upset others. For example, a supervisor may have a pet peeve about people leaving the lid up on the copier, when others interrupt when speaking, or their subordinates having messy desks. Pet Peeve is the twenty-ninth book of the Xanth series by fantasy author Piers Anthony.

The Thompson River has two main branches, the South Thompson River and the North Thompson River. The river is home to several varieties of Pacific salmon and trout. The area's geological history was heavily influenced by glaciation, and the several large glacial lakes have filled the river valley over the last 12,000 years. Archaeological evidence shows human habitation in the watershed dating back at least 8,300 years. The Thompson was named by Fraser River explorer, Simon Fraser, in honour of his friend, Columbia Basin explorer David Thompson. Recreational use of the river includes whitewater rafting and angling. Geography =South Thompson River= The South Thompson originates at the outlet of Little Shuswap Lake at the town of Chase and flows approximately southwest through a wide valley to Kamloops where it joins the North Thompson. Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway and the mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway parallel the river. Little Shuswap Lake is fed by the Little River, which drains Shuswap Lake, which is fed by several rivers and creeks. =North Thompson River= The North Thompson originates at the toe of the Thompson Glacier in the Cariboo Mountains west of the community of Valemount and flows generally south towards Kamloops and the confluence with the South Thompson. For most of its length, the river is paralleled by Highway 5, and the Canadian National Railway (both of which cross the river a couple times). The North Thompson passes by several small communities, the most notable being Blue River, Clearwater & Barriere. The North Thompson picks up the Clearwater River at the town of Clearwater. The Clearwater, the North Thompson's largest tributary, drains much of Wells Gray Provincial Park. A notable feature along the North Thompson is Little Hells Gate, a mini-replica of the much larger rapid on the Fraser downstream from the mouth of the Thompson. About upstream from the small town of Avola, the river is forced through a narrow chute only about wide creating a rapid that resembles the Fraser's famous rapid. =Mainstream= The darker waters of the Thompson meet the Fraser at Lytton. At Kamloops, the combined Thompson River flows from the confluence of the North and South Thompson Rivers before reaching Kamloops Lake, which is roughly in length, ending at the town of Savona. From there it flows in a meandering course westwards through a broad valley area. At Ashcroft, the Thompson Canyon begins and the river turns southwestward to its confluence with the Fraser. The river is paralleled by the Trans-Canada Highway, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian National Railway. From Ashcroft to Lytton, the river is completely confined within Thompson Canyon, making for spectacular scenery. The Thompson River joins the Fraser River in Lytton. There is a striking stretch of dark black cliffside just downstream from Ashcroft and visible from the Logan Lake-Ashcroft highway is officially named the Black Canyon. Just below the town of Spences Bridge was the site of a major rail disaster in the early 20th century. Communities along this section are Bighorn, Shaw Springs, and Goldpan.  Geology  The Thompson River valley has existed in some form for at least 50 million years; however, for much of its history, it did not drain to the southwest into the Pacific Ocean as it does today. Geologists believe water from the river flowed northward, through the Cariboo region, eventually entering what is the modern-day Peace River drainage basin and ending up in the Arctic Ocean. This flow direction is estimated to have ended approximately 2 million years ago, as the Pleistocene era of heavy glaciation began. = Glacial lakes = During the era of massive glaciers in the Thompson River valley, water from the area likely drained eastward, through the Shuswap Lake area into what is now the Columbia River drainage. This flow direction was influenced by large ice buildups in the Thompson valley, which created extensive glacial lakes. Two large glacial lakes, Glacial Lake Thompson and Glacial Lake Deadman, occupied much of the modern river's course from 13,000 BCE to 10,000 BCE. These deep, narrow, ribbon-shaped lakes held large volumes of water; Glacial Lake Thompson held nearly at its highest point. The lake stretched from Spences Bridge in the west to the eastern reaches of Shuswap Lake, as well as far up the northern reaches of the North Thompson river valley. The last large glacial lake, Lake Deadman, was drained by a catastrophic ice dam failure, called a j√∂kulhlaup, in about 10,000 BCE. This event released as much as of water southwest into the Fraser River system, possibly depositing sediments as far away as the Salish Sea, more than away. From this point, the Thompson waters stopped flowing eastward into the Columbia River system, and the river became a tributary of the Fraser. = Landslides = Remnants of a landslide near the railway in the lower Thompson River valley Because of large deposits of glacial silt, sand, and gravel in the lower Thompson River valley, large landslides are common. The area downstream from the town of Ashcroft is prone to landslide events; eight major events between 1880 and 1982 have been recorded. Several of them have obstructed the river, and caused large, temporary lakes. An 1880 slide caused the formation of a short-lived lake over 14 kilometers long with a maximum depth of 18 meters. These slides have caused major damage to the rail lines and farming operations in the river valley. Heavy irrigation has been blamed for some of the events.  History  = Aboriginal peoples = The Interior region of British Columbia was first populated after the retreat of the continental ice sheets of the last ice age. The ice moved out of the Thompson River region approximately 11,000 BCE, and migration by the ancestors of the Nlaka'pamux and Secwepemc people is thought to have occurred soon after. Some of the older archaeological sites on the lower Thompson include the Drynoch Slide site, near Spences Bridge, with artifacts dating to about 7350 BCE, and the Landels site, near Ashcroft, which dates to older than 8000 BCE. Archaeologists theorize early settlers lived in small groups, beginning with nomadic bands hunting ungulates on the plateaus around the river, who then established more permanent dwellings along the river benches as their fishing techniques developed. The South Thompson has the watershed's oldest dated evidence of human habitation, at the Gore site near Pritchard. The human remains date to 8250 BCE, and bone analysis suggests the person was a hunter with small amounts of his protein coming from salmon. Archaeological investigation in the North Thompson has been sparse, but artifacts near Bridge Lake to the west of the river have been dated to 3000 BCE, while pieces found near the tributary Clearwater River are possibly as old as 6000 to 7000 BCE. = European exploration and settlement = Explorer of the Fraser River and North West Company employee Simon Fraser named the river, after passing its mouth on the Fraser in 1808. He named the river after his colleague, David Thompson, who had mapped much of western Canada and was at the time exploring the Columbia River basin to the east. Thompson never visited the river that bears his name. The first documented traverse of the Thompson from Kamloops to Lytton was by Hudson's Bay Company governor George Simpson in 1828. More Europeans entered the Thompson River valley in the early to mid 1800s, drawn by the fur trade and small gold rushes. Others started farming on the fertile benches of the river, and a North West Company trading fort at the confluence of the North and South rivers became the city of Kamloops, now the largest human population center in the watershed.  Ecology  Sockeye salmon during the salmon run, Ts√∫tswecw Provincial Park The Thompson River supports 24 fish species, including two considered endangered. It also hosts carp, which are not native to the watershed. The river is home to large populations of Pacific salmon, including coho, sockeye, pink and chinook. Through its tributary, the Adams River, the Thompson has one of the largest sockeye salmon runs in the world. Pink salmon spawn mostly below Kamloops Lake, while coho spawning beds are found in 40 of the Thompson watershed's streams and rivers. Coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus), including an anadromous variety called steelhead, are found in the river along with a local strain the Kamloops rainbow trout which occurs in Kamloops Lake at the Thompson River headwaters and other nearby lakes. Other fish species include round whitefish, largescale sucker, bridgelip sucker, northern pikeminnow, longnose dace, and slimy sculpin. Several bird species are found in Thompson River environments, including osprey, merganser, wood ducks, and dippers. Golden eagles are found near the confluence with the Fraser, and Bald eagles congregate on the river during the salmon run. Trumpeter swans use the South Thompson on their migratory route. Rattlesnakes are found in the dry sagebrush regions of the lower river. Aquatic insects found in the river system are dominated by three groups: mayflies, midges, and caddisflies. Many of these species emerge with the spring snowmelt, which greatly increases the volume of flow on the river.  Conservation and recreation  The Thompson River and its two branches are mostly unprotected through parks or reserves. Small sections of the river are within provincial parks, including Steelhead, Juniper, Goldpan, and North Thompson Provincial Parks. Some of its tributaries, such as the Clearwater, are more protected through large parks like Wells Gray. However, unlike major river systems to the north and east like the Columbia and Nechako, the Thompson has no hydroelectric dams or major man-made water diversions. Under the British Columbia Fish Protection Act of 1997, the Thompson cannot be considered for future dam construction. Conservation of the Thompson's fisheries, especially its salmon population, has been a focus of provincial, federal, and international bodies, such as the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and the Pacific Salmon Commission. Hwy 5 bridge, first crossing of N. Thompson River after emerging from the Cariboo Mountains =Angling= From the 1950s through the early 1990s the Thompson River was considered one of the premier steelhead angling destinations in North America. The river hosted large runs of both summer and winter run anadromous coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus). In the late 1980s the runs were estimated at over 10,000 fish. The river attracted anglers from around the world seeking powerful Thompson River steelhead. In 1982, the average male winter run Thompson River steelhead was . By the late 1990s, steelhead populations began to decline due to a wide variety of adverse environmental conditions and overfishing by commercial and First Nations gill netters. In 2016, annual steelhead numbers entering the Thompson were estimated to be less than 400 fish. Low numbers have prompted conservation organizations and sportsman's associations to petition Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), for Canada's Species At Risk Act (SARA) protections. The river is subject to catch and release angling only for steelhead and has severely restricted seasons to protect the wild stocks of remaining steelhead. = Whitewater rafting = The rapids of the lower Thompson are used for recreational whitewater rafting. The first commercial rafting operation on the river began in the 1970s, based out of Spences Bridge. Notable whitewater features on the lower river include the Frog, named for a frog-shaped rock formation, and the Jaws of Death, named by CPR engineers. Rapids on the river reach up to Class 5 on the International Scale of River Difficulty.

Whereas in the other two pictures either the state vector or the operators carry time dependence, in the interaction picture both carry part of the time dependence of observables.Albert Messiah (1966). Quantum Mechanics, North Holland, John Wiley & Sons. ; J. J. Sakurai (1994). Modern Quantum Mechanics (Addison-Wesley) . The interaction picture is useful in dealing with changes to the wave functions and observables due to interactions. Most field-theoretical calculationsJ. W. Negele, H. Orland (1988), Quantum Many-particle Systems, . use the interaction representation because they construct the solution to the many-body Schr√∂dinger equation as the solution to the free-particle problem plus some unknown interaction parts. Equations that include operators acting at different times, which hold in the interaction picture, don't necessarily hold in the Schr√∂dinger or the Heisenberg picture. This is because time-dependent unitary transformations relate operators in one picture to the analogous operators in the others. The interaction picture is a special case of unitary transformation applied to the Hamiltonian and state vectors. Definition Operators and state vectors in the interaction picture are related by a change of basis (unitary transformation) to those same operators and state vectors in the Schr√∂dinger picture. To switch into the interaction picture, we divide the Schr√∂dinger picture Hamiltonian into two parts: \\\\+ H_{1,\\\\text{S}}. cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF bgcolor=#F9FFF7}} Any possible choice of parts will yield a valid interaction picture; but in order for the interaction picture to be useful in simplifying the analysis of a problem, the parts will typically be chosen so that H0,S is well understood and exactly solvable, while H1,S contains some harder-to-analyze perturbation to this system. If the Hamiltonian has explicit time-dependence (for example, if the quantum system interacts with an applied external electric field that varies in time), it will usually be advantageous to include the explicitly time-dependent terms with H1,S, leaving H0,S time-independent. We proceed assuming that this is the case. If there is a context in which it makes sense to have H0,S be time- dependent, then one can proceed by replacing e^{\\\\pm i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t/\\\\hbar} by the corresponding time-evolution operator in the definitions below. =State vectors= Let \\\\psi_\\\\text{S}(t)\\\\rangle = \\\\text{e}^{-iH_\\\\text{S}t/\\\\hbar}\\\\psi(0)\\\\rangle be the time-dependent state vector in the Schr√∂dinger picture. A state vector in the interaction picture, \\\\psi_\\\\text{I}(t)\\\\rangle, is defined with an additional time-dependent unitary transformation.The Interaction Picture, lecture notes from New York University. t / \\\\hbar}  \\\\psi_\\\\text{S}(t) \\\\rangle. cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF bgcolor=#F9FFF7}} =Operators= An operator in the interaction picture is defined as t / \\\\hbar} A_\\\\text{S}(t) e^{-i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t / \\\\hbar}. cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF bgcolor=#F9FFF7}} Note that AS(t) will typically not depend on and can be rewritten as just AS. It only depends on if the operator has \\"explicit time dependence\\", for example, due to its dependence on an applied external time- varying electric field. Hamiltonian operator For the operator H_0 itself, the interaction picture and Schr√∂dinger picture coincide: :H_{0,\\\\text{I}}(t) = e^{i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t / \\\\hbar} H_{0,\\\\text{S}} e^{-i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t / \\\\hbar} = H_{0,\\\\text{S}}. This is easily seen through the fact that operators commute with differentiable functions of themselves. This particular operator then can be called H_0 without ambiguity. For the perturbation Hamiltonian H_{1,\\\\text{I}}, however, :H_{1,\\\\text{I}}(t) = e^{i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t / \\\\hbar} H_{1,\\\\text{S}} e^{-i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t / \\\\hbar}, where the interaction-picture perturbation Hamiltonian becomes a time- dependent Hamiltonian, unless [H1,S, H0,S] = 0. It is possible to obtain the interaction picture for a time-dependent Hamiltonian H0,S(t) as well, but the exponentials need to be replaced by the unitary propagator for the evolution generated by H0,S(t), or more explicitly with a time-ordered exponential integral. Density matrix The density matrix can be shown to transform to the interaction picture in the same way as any other operator. In particular, let and be the density matrices in the interaction picture and the Schr√∂dinger picture respectively. If there is probability to be in the physical state œàn„Äâ, then :\\\\rho_\\\\text{I}(t) = \\\\sum_n p_n(t) \\\\psi_{n,\\\\text{I}}(t)\\\\rang \\\\lang \\\\psi_{n,\\\\text{I}}(t) = \\\\sum_n p_n(t) e^{i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t / \\\\hbar}\\\\psi_{n,\\\\text{S}}(t)\\\\rang \\\\lang \\\\psi_{n,\\\\text{S}}(t)e^{-i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t / \\\\hbar} = e^{i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t / \\\\hbar} \\\\rho_\\\\text{S}(t) e^{-i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t / \\\\hbar}. =Time-evolution= Time-evolution of states Transforming the Schr√∂dinger equation into the interaction picture gives : i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\psi_\\\\text{I}(t)\\\\rang = H_{1,\\\\text{I}}(t) \\\\psi_\\\\text{I}(t)\\\\rang, which states that in the interaction picture, a quantum state is evolved by the interaction part of the Hamiltonian as expressed in the interaction picture.Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur, Chapter 18 - for those who saw this being called the Schwinger-Tomonaga equation, this is not the Schwinger-Tomonaga equation. That is a generalization of the Schr√∂dinger equation to arbitrary space-like foliations of spacetime. Time-evolution of operators If the operator AS is time-independent (i.e., does not have \\"explicit time dependence\\"; see above), then the corresponding time evolution for AI(t) is given by : i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{d}{dt}A_\\\\text{I}(t) = [A_\\\\text{I}(t),H_{0,\\\\text{S}}]. In the interaction picture the operators evolve in time like the operators in the Heisenberg picture with the Hamiltonian . Time-evolution of the density matrix The evolution of the density matrix in the interaction picture is : i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\rho_\\\\text{I}(t) = [H_{1,\\\\text{I}}(t), \\\\rho_\\\\text{I}(t)], in consistency with the Schr√∂dinger equation in the interaction picture. Expectation values For a general operator A, the expectation value in the interaction picture is given by : \\\\langle A_\\\\text{I}(t) \\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\psi_\\\\text{I}(t)  A_\\\\text{I}(t)  \\\\psi_\\\\text{I}(t) \\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\psi_\\\\text{S}(t)  e^{-i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t} e^{i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t} \\\\, A_\\\\text{S} \\\\, e^{-i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t} e^{i H_{0,\\\\text{S}} t }  \\\\psi_\\\\text{S}(t) \\\\rangle = \\\\langle A_\\\\text{S}(t) \\\\rangle. Using the density- matrix expression for expectation value, we will get :\\\\langle A_\\\\text{I}(t) \\\\rangle = \\\\operatorname{Tr}\\\\big(\\\\rho_\\\\text{I}(t) \\\\, A_\\\\text{I}(t)\\\\big).  Use  The purpose of the interaction picture is to shunt all the time dependence due to H0 onto the operators, thus allowing them to evolve freely, and leaving only H1,I to control the time-evolution of the state vectors. The interaction picture is convenient when considering the effect of a small interaction term, H1,S, being added to the Hamiltonian of a solved system, H0,S. By utilizing the interaction picture, one can use time-dependent perturbation theory to find the effect of H1,I, e.g., in the derivation of Fermi's golden rule, or the Dyson series in quantum field theory: in 1947, Shin'ichir≈ç Tomonaga and Julian Schwinger appreciated that covariant perturbation theory could be formulated elegantly in the interaction picture, since field operators can evolve in time as free fields, even in the presence of interactions, now treated perturbatively in such a Dyson series.

Banyen Rakkaen is one of the \\"Queen of mor lam\\" and after 45 years in the business she named a National Artist in 2014 for her contribution to folk music.  Biography  Born to a contractor father and housewife mother in Ubon Ratchathani, Banyen has always had a vocal gift, one which caused her aunt, mor lam master Noowiang Kaewprasert, to become interested in training Banyen even before Noowiang had heard her sing. When she was 14, she studied singing and dancing with her aunt. Later Rungsimun, a powerful, massively popular, legendary mor lam troupe came calling. Master Thongkum Pengdee was looking for a new leading lady, and Banyen was recruited. Banyen was famous when she performed with Rungsimun since she was 17 years old. She is also a student of National Artist, Master Chaweewan Dumnern. Banyen was the first national mor lam star, whose appearances on television in the 1980s brought the form to an audience beyond its northeastern heartland. She bridges the gap between traditional and modern mor lam, normally appearing in traditional clothing but using electrified instruments and singing luk thung and dance-influenced songs.http://www.afana.org/morlamnotes.htm She has three children Annie Rakkaen, Candy Rakkaen and Toni Rakkaen. Banyen later separated from her husband, and he took her three kids to Australia where they grew up, while she went to the US to perform regularly for the Thai community there. Her children and grandchildren now live in Bangkok, allowing her to be a doting mother and grandmother. She has also teamed up with her daughter, Candy, for an Isan pop-rock troupe that mixes modern music with applied and traditional mor lam. Banyen handles the traditional part.

At the Lower School, every class is strictly 16 students.School Data for Pingry School, National Center for Education Statistics. Accessed November 12, 2019.  History  Pingry was founded by Reverend John Francis Pingry, a Presbyterian minister, in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1861 to provide both scholastic training and moral education for boys. The outbreak of the American Civil War that year caused enrollment to dry up at the Pingry Select School for Boys, an academy John Pingry had founded in 1854 in Roseville. After learning that Elizabeth's only professional educator had decided to enlist in the Union Army, John Pingry moved to Elizabeth where he founded the Pingry School. Although Pingry gave talks on Proverbs and used the Bible for instructional purposes, the school has never been affiliated with any church or denomination. The School moved from the Elizabeth schoolhouse to the famous Parker Road Campus in 1893. After Pingry retired in 1893, several headmasters with relatively short tenures held his position. In 1917, C. Mitchell Froelicher became headmaster, but he was pushed out in 1920 because of his German-sounding name and the anti-German sentiment surrounding World War I. Charles Bertram Newton became the headmaster of the school, and his tenure lasted until 1936. Newton became famous for championing the Country Day School philosophy, and Pingry became a much more modern school under his tenure. In 1925, the Honor Code was written. It was revised in 1988. From 1936 to 1961, E. Laurence Springer was headmaster, and his tenure was the longest in Pingry's history. He oversaw the move to Pingry's Hillside Campus. The School moved to the edge of Hillside, New Jersey in 1953. Early in the 1970s, two important changes occurred: Pingry began the transition to a coeducational school. The first female students, who graduated in 1976, were succeeded by other young women who today represent half the student body. Secondly, Pingry grew again by merging with the Short Hills Country Day School to become a school with grades from Kindergarten through grade 12. Today over 250 children attend the Pingry Short Hills Campus. In this period of about twenty years, David C. Wilson and H. Wescott Cunningham each served as headmaster. In 1983, the school moved to Martinsville, a rural area in the Watchung and Somerset Hills. The campuses are approximately 25 minutes apart, and both are located near the New York metropolitan area, which continues to provide many outside resources to supplement the classroom.History of The Pingry School. Accessed October 12, 2006. The old campus in Hillside is now used as a campus of Kean University. In 2013, the Martinsville location was renamed to \\"Basking Ridge\\" in an effort to make it easier to locate the campus using automated mapping tools.History, Pingry School.

He served until 2000, and was well-liked and remembered by members of the community. Today, the Hanly Lecture on Ethics and Morality holds his name. John Neiswender became Headmaster after Hanly, and served until 2005. Nathaniel Conard was Headmaster from July 2005 to mid-2019. In late 2018, The School announced that Matt Levinson, of University Prep in Seattle, would be Head of School after Conard retired in mid-2019. Since Pingry's day, there have been 16 headmasters. Currently, Matt Levinson holds the post, his appointment effective mid-2019. Pingry's motto is Maxima reverentia pueris debetur, a Latin phrase literally meaning \\"the greatest respect is owed to the boys.\\" Since becoming co-educational, the school has modified the motto's translation to \\"the greatest respect is due to the students.\\" Dr. John Pingry's personal motto, \\"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\\" (Prov. 1:7), hangs as a sign in the C.B. Newton Library located at the Basking Ridge Campus. In April 2020, the school received an unspecified amount in federally backed small business loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The school received scrutiny over this loan, which meant to protect small and private businesses. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted that the schools should return the money, but the Matt Levinson stated they were keeping it, despite having an $80+ million endowment. = The Honor Code = Pingry's Honor Code is as follows: Violations are judged by the student-run Honor Board.

In early 2007, Forms I and II (grades 7 and 8) moved into the new building. Grade 6 was moved from the Short Hills campus to this new facility at the beginning of the 2007‚Äì2008 school year. The building's most notable feature is its specially designed large common area, which is used by the community as an assembly area and by the students as a place to gather informally. This new building shares the cafeteria, the library, the arts wing, the Student Technology and Publishing Center, and the athletic facilities with the upper school. The Pingry School's Basking Ridge campus used to have a modern-looking turquoise and pink architecture. The turquoise bricks that used to compose the school's central clock tower were originally supposed to be navy blue, but by the time the incorrectly colored paint arrived it was too late to make a change. The main building was designed by the architecture firm Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates. The building has now completed construction, which involved removing the tiles from the clock tower and replacing them with the type of stones used in the making of the new middle school building mentioned previously. This construction project also involved the repair of the roof. There are places for refreshments and snacks in the main building. The cafeteria is open almost the entire day. The bookstore, re-located to the second level, also sells snack food. In addition, students can purchase items such as binders, pens, or even shirts, sweatshirts and other Pingry emblazoned apparel, if needed during the day. The Bookstore is open from 8:00 A.M. until 4:00 pm. There is a vending machine, which is always open, located next to the Student Technology and Publishing Center on the lower floor. Sports facilities include the Bristol Gymnasium (competition space), the Hyde & Watson Gymnasium (general purpose), the Beinecke Pool (swimming), a fitness facility (weight room and cardio studio), a multi-sport turf field, tennis courts, an eight-lane track, a football field, a cross country running trail, two baseball diamonds, and numerous fields used for soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse.

Pingry is known for its high number of alumni in high-level positions in the financial services and legal industries.  Sexual abuse scandal  = Initial allegations = On March 29, 2016, The Pingry School sent a letter to \\"parents of current students, the entire alumni and school trustees\\" informing them that the School had \\"recently learned from a few of our alumni that students were sexually abused by Thad Alton, an employee of Short Hills Country Day School from 1972 to 1974 and, following the merger of the two institutions, an employee of The Pingry School from 1974 to 1978.\\" The letter stated that Pingry had hired a security firm to conduct an investigation on behalf of the school. The letter was signed by Headmaster Nathaniel E. Conard and Jeffrey N. Edwards, chair of the board of trustees. At that time, Crew Janci LLP, \\"a law firm that specializes in suing schools and youth organizations for their negligent handling of sexual abuse[,] announced it has been investigating Alton's tenure at Pingry for over a year.\\" Crew Janci LLP's investigation on behalf of the victims was \\"credited with persuading the 166-year-old [Pingry] school to launch its own investigation[.]\\" Crew Janci's website made clear that its investigation on behalf of the victims would continue, despite the announcement of the Pingry School's commissioning of an investigation. On April 1, 2016, The Star-Ledger revealed court documents indicating that Alton had previously been convicted for his sexual abuse of Pingry students. The spokesperson for the Pingry School was quoted as responding to this information by saying: \\"I'm afraid such a conviction is news to us\\" and that \\"[i]t wasn't until recently that the [Pingry] school's current administration knew anything about this situation in the '70s, which prompted us to act[.]\\" A news article published on April 8, 2016, detailed how Alton moved from Pingry School in 1978 to The Peck School, \\"10 miles away in Morristown.\\" The Peck School sent a letter to its alumni explaining \\"that Alton had nothing but 'positive job references' when he was hired, fresh from six years at the Short Hills Country Day School, which merged with Pingry.\\" After leaving the Peck School in 1979, Alton continued on as an educator at Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York until he was arrested in December 1989 in relation to his sexual abuse of more than 50 children. On April 27, 2016, The Star- Ledger ran a report of interviews with several of the victims. Then, on April 28, \\"Pingry Survivors\\" ‚Äì a group of individuals who were sexually abused as children while at Pingry‚Äî posted an open letter to the \\"Pingry Community.\\" In their open letter, the Pingry Survivors stated their goals as follows: \\"(1) For the Pingry Community to learn the whole truth about the extent of the problem of child sexual abuse at the Pingry School ‚Äì including a complete and accurate disclosure about the School's response at the time of the abuse (and since); (2) For The Pingry School to hear, understand, and acknowledge the suffering of each victim and to make meaningful amends; and, (3) For The Pingry School to dedicate itself to ensuring that this history can never be repeated (including an independent review of policies, practices, and culture, as well as implementation of meaningful changes).\\" The Pingry Survivors went on to say that they \\"hope that we and the current Pingry School leadership ‚Äì with the support of the greater Pingry Community ‚Äì can find a path forward that is collaborative and allows for true healing and reconciliation.\\" = Outcome = During the year following Pingry's announcement of its investigation in March 2016, the school's child sexual abuse scandal was mentioned in multiple national media reports on private schools with pervasive sexual abuse in their pasts, including Vanity Fair and The New York Times. On March 28, 2017, The Pingry School released a letter announcing that it had concluded its \\"independent investigation into the sexual abuse allegations and circumstances surrounding Thad Alton's tenure.\\" The school posted a \\"Report to the Pingry Community\\" on a website other than its official page called \\"www.pingryresponse.org.\\" It is unclear whether the school received a more comprehensive investigative report. The \\"Report to the Pingry Community\\" substantiated 27 victims of child sexual abuse by Alton, as well as abuse by other former Pingry faculty and staff. The school announced that their investigator's report \\"affirms the abuse by former Pingry teacher and assistant Lower School principal Thad Alton. Pingry's investigative report revealed that at least one \\"school board member learned of Alton's activities in 1979,\\" but that the Pingry School \\"never shared the information with its faculty, alumni or the family of its students.\\" The school acknowledged in its letter that \\"the culture, structure, and policies of the school... allowed such atrocities to occur in the past.\\" The school asserted: \\"[W]e are deeply sorry for the pain the survivors have suffered, and are grateful to them for coming forward. In our commitment to ongoing efforts to fully understand and address these troubling events in Pingry's past, we will be engaging with survivors to learn how we can best support them. Our hope is to heal as a community and continue to foster the culture of safety and well-being that our students deserve. This healing requires our continued partnership, collaboration, and candor.\\" In the days after the release of the Pingry School's report, victims of abuse at Pingry went to the media with their stories about the abuse and the impact it had on their lives. In some of those media reports, the \\"Pingry Survivors\\" group asserted \\"their school knew what was going on\\" with the abuse at the time it was occurring. Alton has never been criminally prosecuted for his sexual abuse of most of the Pingry victims. He lives in Manhattan and is a registered sex offender in the State of New York. On December 4, 2017, an article appeared on the front page of The New York Times detailing Pingry's attempts to invoke to statute of limitations to avoid compensating former students who were victims of sexual abuse at the school.

The novel, told in first person perspective, tells the story of a fictional geisha working in Kyoto, Japan, before, during, and after World War II and ends with her being relocated to New York City. In 2005, a film version was released. Plot summary In 1929, nine-year old Chiyo Sakamoto and her 15-year-old sister, Satsu, are sold by their father to work within the entertainment districts of Kyoto. They are taken from their home, the coastal fishing village of Yoroido along the Sea of Japan, and travel to Kyoto by train; upon arrival, Chiyo is taken to the Nitta Okiya (geisha boarding house) in Gion, whereas Satsu - deemed less attractive and therefore a poor investment - is instead taken to a brothel within Kyoto's pleasure district. Chiyo is taken inside, and is introduced to Auntie, Mother (Auntie's adoptive older sister and the matriarch of the house) and Granny, their elderly and poor-natured adoptive mother and the okiya's former \\"mother\\". Both Auntie and Mother are strict, though Auntie is kinder to Chiyo, whereas Mother is driven by money and business. Chiyo is also introduced to Hatsumomo - the premier geisha of the okiya, its primary earner, and one of the most famous, beautiful and ill-mannered geisha of Gion. Hatsumomo takes an instant disliking to Chiyo, and goes out of her way to torment her. Auntie warns Chiyo against both angering and trusting Hatsumomo, knowing the ill- mannered geisha's true nature very well. Chiyo begins her \\"training\\" at the okiya, which consists of household drudgery, before she is deemed worthy enough and starts her geisha training. Having learnt the location of Satsu from Hatsumomo, upon an errand one day, Chiyo runs off to find her, and discovers her working in the pleasure district. The two conspire to run away and escape. Returning to the okiya, Chiyo discovers Hatsumomo with her boyfriend, Koichi; both Hatsumomo and Chiyo are punished after Chiyo is falsely accused of stealing by the furious Hatsumomo. Miserable and desperate, Chiyo plans to finally run away from the okiya; however, she is caught when she falls off the roof and breaks her arm. Enraged at her for being a poor investment, Mother stops investing in Chiyo's geisha apprenticeship and returns her to the life of a maid. In a letter, Chiyo learns of her parents' deaths, and that Satsu managed to escape and return to Yoroido, only to run away with the son of a fisherman. A few years later, a downtrodden Chiyo is given money and a handkerchief in the street by a kind stranger known to Chiyo as the Chairman. She donates the money to a shrine in Gion, praying to become a geisha of sufficient status to entertain the Chairman, and keeps the handkerchief as a memento. Soon afterwards, Pumpkin prepares to make her debut as a maiko, and the \\"younger sister\\" of Hatsumomo, whilst Chiyo remains a maid; this is, however, until Mameha, another famous geisha in Gion, persuades a reluctant Mother to reinvest in Chiyo's training, with Mameha acting as Chiyo's mentor and \\"older sister\\". Under Mameha's care, Chiyo becomes a maiko with the given name of Sayuri, and is reacquainted with Chairman Iwamura (who appears not to recognise her), his closest friend and business partner Nobu, and a number of other prominent men. As Sayuri gains popularity, Hatsumomo - who has been refused succession of the okiya through adoption by Mother - tries to hurt Sayuri's reputation and career in the hopes of Mother adopting Pumpkin instead, through whom Hatsumomo can run the okiya by proxy. Mameha devises a plan to orchestrate a bidding war for Sayuri's mizuage (portrayed as a deflowering \\"ceremony\\" for maiko as a step to becoming a full-fledged geisha). The plan is almost ruined when Hatsumomo attempts to spread the rumour of Sayuri no longer being a virgin; however, her attempt fails, and Mameha uses the record-breaking payment for Sayuri's mizuage to cover all of her debts. Mother adopts Sayuri over Pumpkin, ultimately destroying their friendship forever, and Hatsumomo begins a downward spiral into alcoholism before being thrown out of the okiya permanently following the assault of a kabuki actor during a party. Upon Sayuri's promotion to fully-fledged geishahood, Nobu expresses an interest in becoming Sayuri's danna (patron), but loses to General Tottori; with Japan on the eve of war, Mother decides that a connection to the military is more important to the okiya. In 1944, geisha districts are ordered to close, and with many geisha conscripted to work in the factories, Sayuri desperately asks Nobu for help to avoid being conscripted into factory work. He sends Sayuri far north to live with his old friend, Arashino, a kimono maker, where she stays for much of the war. At the end of the war, Nobu visits Sayuri, asking that she return to Gion to entertain the new Deputy Minister, Sato, whose aid Nobu desperately needs to rebuild his and the Chairman's business, Iwamura Electric. Sayuri returns to Gion to find Pumpkin working in a new okiya; despite hoping to rekindle their friendship, Pumpkin later sabotages Sayuri's plan to scare Nobu off from proposing to be her danna, as revenge for taking her place in the adoption so many years ago. A few days after her plan fails, Sayuri is summoned to meet a client at a teahouse. Believing Nobu has called her to discuss the arrangements for becoming her danna, Sayuri is surprised to see the Chairman instead, and confesses that she has worked for years to become close to the Chairman. The Chairman admits that he has always known she was the girl he met on the street, and confesses his feelings for her as well, but felt he owed Nobu - his oldest and closest friend - the chance to be with Sayuri out of kindness. He also admits to having asked Mameha to train Sayuri. Sayuri peacefully retires from geisha work when the Chairman becomes her danna. It is heavily implied that they have an illegitimate son together. Foreseeing the consequences this could have regarding the inheritance of Iwamura Electric, she relocates to New York City and opens her own small tea house for entertaining Japanese men on business in the United States. Sayuri severs her links to the Nitta okiya and in effect, Japan. The Chairman remains her danna until his death and the story concludes with a reflection on Sayuri and her life. References to actual locations Much of the novel is set in the popular Hanamachi geisha district of Gion in Kyoto and contains references to actual places frequented by geisha and their patrons, such as the Ichiriki Ochaya. Part of the story is also set in the Amami Islands, and Sayuri narrates the story from her suite in the Waldorf towers in New York City. Lawsuit After the Japanese edition of the novel was published, Arthur Golden was sued for breach of contract and defamation of character by Mineko Iwasaki, a retired geisha he had interviewed for background information while writing the novel. The plaintiff asserted that Golden had agreed to protect her anonymity if she told him about her life as a geisha, due to the traditional code of silence about their clients. However, Golden listed Iwasaki as a source in his acknowledgments for the novel, causing her to face a serious backlash, to the point of death threats. In his defense, Arthur Golden countered that he had tapes of his conversations with Iwasaki.A Geisha Scorned The Rough Guide to Japan: The Rough Guide, by Jan Dodd, Simon Richmond. Published by Rough Guides, 2001. . Page 889. Eventually, in 2003, Golden's publisher settled with Iwasaki out of court for an undisclosed sum of money. Iwasaki later went on to write an autobiography, which shows a very different picture of twentieth-century geisha life than the one shown in Golden's novel.

History Potocki palace Basilian Monastery in Chervonohrad The city was part of the Polish Kingdom in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth since its foundation in 1692 until 1772, when it was incorporated into the Habsburg Empire. During the interwar period, it belonged to the Second Polish Republic, and between 1945 and 1951 was part of the Polish People's Republic. It passed from Poland to the Ukrainian SSR after the territorial exchange in 1951 and had its name changed to Chervonohrad. In May 1685, the Crown hetman and Krak√≥w Voivode Feliks Kazimierz Potocki purchased land along the Bug River. In 1692, he founded a city on the lands of the village \\"Novyi Dvir\\" (literally \\"New Garden\\", Polish: Nowy Dw√≥r) and named it \\"Krystynopol\\" after his wife Krystyna Lubomirska (the suffix \\"-pol\\" derives from Greek \\"polis\\"). Potocki made the city his family center. He died here on September 22, 1702. His grandson Franciszek Salezy Potocki built a palace and in 1763 founded a monastery of Basilians (barocco church of Saint George; prior to 1946 ‚Äì a place of miracles with wondrous icon of the Mother of God). The Church of the Holy Spirit (built in the 1750s). In the 19th century, the \\"Apostolus Christinopolitanus\\" and famous chronicle from 1763‚Äì1779 were kept in the city. The Catholic order of Myrrh-Bearing Sisters was founded by Fr. Yulian Datsii in 1910, with the purpose of gathering funds to build a home for orphans and the poor. The first members of the congregation vowed to build two buildings: one for the people and one for the congregation. In 1913 the first convent arose, where 15 sisters lived. Among the landmarks of the city is Count Potocki's palace, constructed by the order of Feliks Kazimierz Potocki after 1692.

It includes Althaea officinalis, also known as the marshmallow plant, whence the fluffy confection got its name. They are found on the banks of rivers and in salt marshes, preferring moist, sandy soils. The stems grow to 1‚Äì2 m tall, and flower in mid summer. The leaves are palmately lobed with 3‚Äì7 lobes. Althaea species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bucculatrix quadrigemina. Species The genus formerly included a number of additional species now treated in the genus Alcea (hollyhocks). , Plants of the World Online accepts the following species: *Althaea armeniaca Ten. *Althaea bertramii Post & Beauverd *Althaea cannabina L. *Althaea damascena Mouterde *Althaea hiri Parsa *Althaea octaviae Evenari *Althaea officinalis L. *Althaea oppenheimii Ulbr. *Althaea villosa Blatt. Chemical constituents The root contains starch (37%), mucilage (11%), pectin (11%), flavonoids, phenolic acids, sucrose, and asparagine. Uses The traditional medicinal uses of the plant are reflected in the name of the genus, which comes from the Greek althainein, meaning \\"to heal\\". The flowers and young leaves can be eaten, and are often added to salads or are boiled and fried. The roots and stem also secrete mucilage, which is used to soften the skin, and is used in cosmetic treatments. The Roman poet Horace refers to his own diet in his Odes, which he describes as very simple: \\"As for me, olives, endives, and smooth mallows provide sustenance.\\" The root has been used since Egyptian antiquity in a honey-sweetened confection useful in the treatment of sore throat. The later French version of the recipe, called p√¢te de guimauve (or \\"guimauve\\" for short), included an eggwhite meringue and was often flavored with rose water. P√¢te de guimauve more closely resembles contemporary commercially available marshmallows, which no longer contain any actual marshmallow. The root's emulsifying property is used for cleaning Persian carpets in the Middle East. It is regarded as the best method to preserve the vibrancy of vegetable dyes used in coloring the carpet's wool.

He concludes that length, \\"unity of effect\\" and a logical method are important considerations for good writing. He also makes the assertion that \\"the death... of a beautiful woman\\" is \\"unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world\\". Poe uses the composition of his own poem \\"The Raven\\" as an example. The essay first appeared in the April 1846 issue of Graham's Magazine. It is uncertain if it is an authentic portrayal of Poe's own method. Poe's philosophy of composition Generally, the essay introduces three of Poe's theories regarding literature. The author recounts this idealized process by which he says he wrote his most famous poem, \\"The Raven\\", to illustrate the theory, which is in deliberate contrast to the \\"spontaneous creation\\" explanation put forth, for example, by Coleridge as an explanation for his poem Kubla Khan. Poe's explanation of the process of writing is so rigidly logical, however, that some have suggested the essay was meant as a satire or hoax.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 296 The three central elements of Poe's philosophy of composition are: =Length= Poe believed that all literary works should be short. He writes, \\"[...] there is a distinct limit, as regards length, to all works of literary art ‚Äî the limit of a single sitting [...]\\" He especially emphasized this \\"rule\\" with regards to poetry, but also noted that the short story is superior to the novel for this reason. =Method= Poe dismissed the notion of artistic intuition and argued that writing is methodical and analytical, not spontaneous. He writes that no other author has yet admitted this because most writers would \\"positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes... at the fully matured fancies discarded in despair... at the cautious selections and rejections\\". =\\"Unity of effect\\"= The essay states Poe's conviction that a work of fiction should be written only after the author has decided how it is to end and which emotional response, or \\"effect\\", he wishes to create, commonly known as the \\"unity of effect\\". Once this effect has been determined, the writer should decide all other matters pertaining to the composition of the work, including tone, theme, setting, characters, conflict, and plot. In this case, Poe logically decides on \\"the death... of a beautiful woman\\" as it \\"is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover.\\" Some commentators have taken this to imply that pure poetry can only be attained by the eradication of female beauty.Kennedy, J. Gerald. \\"Poe, 'Ligeia,' and the Problem of Dying Women\\" collected in New Essays on Poe's Major Tales, edited by Kenneth Silverman. Cambridge University Press, 1993. p. 113. Biographers and critics have often suggested that Poe's obsession with this theme stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his mother Eliza Poe, his foster mother Frances Allan and, later, his wife Virginia.Weekes, Karen. \\"Poe's feminine ideal,\\" collected in The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe, edited by Kevin J. Hayes. Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 149. \\"The Raven\\" In the essay, Poe traces the logical progression of his creation of \\"The Raven\\" as an attempt to compose \\"a poem that should suit at once the popular and the critical taste.\\" He claims that he considered every aspect of the poem. For example, he purposely set the poem on a tempestuous evening, causing the raven to seek shelter. He purposefully chose a pallid bust to contrast with the dark plume of the bird. The bust was of Pallas in order to evoke the notion of scholar, to match with the presumed student narrator poring over his \\"volume[s] of forgotten lore.\\" No aspect of the poem was an accident, he claims, but is based on total control by the author.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 295-6 Even the term \\"Nevermore,\\" he says, is based on logic following the \\"unity of effect.\\" The sounds in the vowels in particular, he writes, have more meaning than the definition of the word itself. He had previously used words like \\"Lenore\\" for the same effect. The raven itself, Poe says, is meant to symbolize Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 240 This may imply an autobiographical significance to the poem, alluding to the many people in Poe's life who had died.Kopley, Richard and Kevin J. Hayes. \\"Two verse masterworks: 'The Raven' and 'Ulalume',\\" collected in The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe, edited by Kevin J. Hayes. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002. pp. 194‚Äì5. Reception It is uncertain if Poe really followed the method he describes in \\"The Philosophy of Composition.\\" T. S. Eliot said: \\"It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method.\\"Hoffman, Daniel. Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe. Louisiana State University Press, 1972. p. 76 Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as, \\"a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization than literary criticism.\\"Krutch, Joseph Wood. Edgar Allan Poe: A Study in Genius. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1926. p. 98 It is apparent, however, that many French literary figures and composers believed that Poe composed \\"The Raven\\" in the manner depicted in \\"The Philosophy of Composition.\\" Maurice Ravel, in a July 1931 interview, stated that \\"the finest treatise on composition, in my opinion, and the one which in any case had the greatest influence upon me was [Poe's] \\"Philosophy of Composition... I am convinced that Poe indeed wrote his poem \\"The Raven\\" in the way that he indicated.\\" Charles Baudelaire believed that the \\"unity of impression, the totality of effect\\" described by Poe endowed a composition with \\"a very special superiority.\\"Lanford, Michael. \\"Ravel and 'The Raven': The Realisation of an Inherited Aesthetic in Bol√©ro.\\" Cambridge Quarterly 40(3), 243‚Äì265. Publication history George Rex Graham, a friend and former employer of Poe, declined Poe's offer to be the first to print \\"The Raven\\".

S. Anderson, and starring Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Lance Henriksen and Ewen Bremner. It is the first film installment of the Alien vs. Predator franchise, adapting a crossover bringing together the eponymous creatures of the Alien and Predator series, a concept which originated in a 1989 comic book. Anderson wrote the story together with the creators of the Alien franchise, Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, and Anderson and Shane Salerno adapted the story into a screenplay. Their writing was influenced by Aztec mythology, the comic book series, and the writings of Erich von D√§niken. In the film, scientists are caught in the crossfire of an ancient battle between Aliens and Predators as they attempt to escape a bygone pyramid. Alien vs. Predator was theatrically released on 12 August 2004 to negative reviews, and grossed $177.4 million worldwide against a production budget of $60 million. A sequel, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, was released in 2007. Plot In 2004, a satellite detects a mysterious heat bloom beneath Bouvet√∏ya, an island about off the coast of Antarctica. Wealthy industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) discovers through thermal imaging that there is a pyramid buried beneath the ice. He attempts to claim it for his multinational communications company, Weyland Industries, a subsidiary of the Weyland Corporation, and assembles a team of experts to investigate. The team includes archaeologists, linguistic experts, drillers, mercenaries, and a guide named Alexa \\"Lex\\" Woods (Sanaa Lathan). As a Predator ship reaches Earth's orbit, it fires an energy beam aimed at the pyramid site. When the team arrives at the abandoned whaling station above the heat source, they find a perfectly circular, unnatural tunnel running directly beneath the ice towards the pyramid. Weyland shows the team satellite images showing that the passage was not there 24 hours ago. The exploration team descend the tunnel and locate the mysterious pyramid and begin to explore it, soon finding evidence of a prehistoric civilization and what appears to be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons. Inexplicably, all the skeletons appear to have ruptured rib cages. Meanwhile, three Predators ‚Äì Scar, Celtic and Chopper ‚Äì arrive and kill the remaining team members on the surface. They make their way down to the pyramid and arrive just as the team unwittingly activates the structure and are trapped within it. The Alien Queen awakes from cryogenic stasis and begins to produce eggs. When the eggs hatch, several facehuggers attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Xenomorphs. Conflict erupts between the Predators, Xenomorphs, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Celtic and Chopper are killed by a Xenomorph, and Weyland buys Lex and Italian archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa (Raoul Bova) enough time to escape from Scar, giving his life in the process. The two witness Scar kill a facehugger and a Xenomorph with a shuriken before unmasking and marking himself with the blood of the facehugger. After Lex and Sebastian leave, another facehugger attaches itself to Scar due to him not wearing his mask. Through translation of the pyramid's hieroglyphs, Lex and Sebastian learn that the Predators have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. It was they who taught early human civilizations how to build pyramids, and were worshipped as gods. Every 100 years they visit Earth to take part in a rite of passage by which several humans sacrifice themselves as hosts for the Xenomorphs, creating the \\"ultimate prey\\" for the Predators to hunt. As a fail-safe, if overwhelmed, the Predators would activate a self-destruct device to eliminate the Xenomorphs and themselves. The two deduce that this is why the current Predators are at the pyramid, and that the heat bloom was a ruse to attract humans to the site for the sole purpose of making new Xenomorphs to hunt. Lex and Sebastian decide that the Predators must be allowed to succeed in their hunt so that the Xenomorphs do not escape to the surface. Sebastian is captured by a Xenomorph, leaving only Lex and Scar to fight the Xenomorph. Scar uses parts of a dead Xenomorph to fashion weapons for Lex and the two form an alliance. The Xenomorph Queen, using her own acidic blood, is freed from her restraints and, along with the other Xenomorphs, begins pursuing Lex and Scar. Just as they are about to escape, Scar detaches and uses a bomb in his wrist module to destroy the pyramid and the remaining Xenomorphs and eggs. Lex and Scar reach the surface, however the Xenomorph Queen has survived and continues chasing them. They defeat the Queen by hooking her chains to the whaling post's water tank and pushing it over a cliff, dragging her to the ocean floor. Scar, however, had been impaled by the Xenomorph Queen's tail and succumbs to his wounds, dying. A Predator ship uncloaks and several Predators appear. They retrieve their fallen comrade and an elite Predator presents Lex with one of their spear weapons as a gift. The other Predators recognize her skill as a warrior by the symbol that Scar burned on her cheek before he died, using alien blood. The Predators' spaceship flies off, leaving Lex behind. Lex walks over to a snowcat and leaves the area. The Predators leave Scar's body on a plinth in front of a window on the ship. Moments later, a Predalien with Alien and Predator traits erupts from Scar's chest, leading into the events of Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem. Cast * Tom Woodruff Jr. as The Alien / \\"Grid\\". The Alien played by Woodruff is listed in the film's credits as Grid, referencing crosshatch scars from Predator net constriction in the battle with the Predator called \\"Celtic\\". * Ian Whyte as The Predator / \\"Scar\\", one of the three main Predators who come to Earth to create and hunt Aliens within the pyramid as a rite of passage. Whyte played the lead Predator, called Scar in the film's credits due to the Predator marking himself with the Alien's acidic blood. Whyte also played the other three Predators: \\"Chopper\\", \\"Celtic\\" and \\"Elder\\" (leader of the Predators at the end of the film). Production =Fifth Alien film and sequel= Before 20th Century Fox gave Alien vs. Predator the greenlight, Aliens writer/director James Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film. Alien director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating \\"I think it would be a lot of fun, but the most important thing is to get the story right.\\" In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was \\"to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created\\"; this project eventually became Scott's film Prometheus (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator, Cameron believed the film would \\"kill the validity of the franchise\\" and ceased work on his story, \\"To me, that was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf. It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it.\\" After viewing Alien vs. Predator, Cameron remarked that \\"it was actually pretty good. I think of the five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot.\\" Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, \\"No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step.\\" Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to Aliens. However, Scott stated in 2017 that the project has been cancelled. =Development= The concept of Alien vs. Predator originated from the Aliens versus Predator comic book in 1989. It was also hinted at when an Alien skull appeared in a trophy case aboard the Predator ship in Predator 2. Shortly after the release of Predator 2, Predator co-writer Jim Thomas discussed the possibilities of a Predator franchise and commented on the prospect of a crossover film, stating, \\"I think Predator vs. Alien is a good idea that will probably never happen\\". Screenwriter Peter Briggs created the original spec screenplay in 1990‚Äì1991, which was based on the first comic series. In 1991, he successfully pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, who owned the film franchises, although the company did not move forward with the project until 2002. The project was delayed chiefly because the studio was working on Alien: Resurrection. A draft penned by James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox was rejected by producer John Davis, who hoped to give the film an original approach by setting it on Earth. As there were six producers between the film franchises, Predator producer John Davis had difficulty securing the rights as the producers were worried about a film featuring the two creatures. Paul W. S. Anderson pitched Davis a story he worked on for eight years, and showed him concept art created by Randy Bowen. Impressed with Anderson's idea, Davis thought the story was like Jaws in that it \\"just drew you in, it drew you in\\". Anderson started to work on the film after completing the script for Resident Evil: Apocalypse, with Shane Salerno co-writing. Salerno spent six months writing the shooting script, finished its development, and stayed on for revisions throughout the film's production. Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett received story credit on the film based on elements from their work on the original Alien. =Story and setting= alt= Early reports claimed the story was about humans who tried to lure Predators with Alien eggs, although the idea was scrapped. Influenced by the work of Erich von D√§niken, Anderson researched von D√§niken's theories on how he believed early civilizations were able to construct massive pyramids with the help of aliens, an idea long debunked and based on misinterpretations of Aztec mythology. Anderson wove these ideas into Alien vs. Predator, describing a scenario in which Predators taught ancient humans to build pyramids and used Earth for rite of passage rituals every 100 years in which they would hunt Aliens. To explain how these ancient civilisations \\"disappeared without a trace\\", Anderson came up with the idea that the Predators, if overwhelmed by the Aliens, would use their self- destruct weapons to kill everything in the area. H. P. Lovecraft's novella At the Mountains of Madness (1931) served as an inspiration for the film, and several elements of the Aliens vs. Predator comic series were included. Anderson's initial script called for five Predators to appear in the film, although the number was later reduced to three. As Alien vs. Predator was intended to be a sequel to the Predator films and prequel to the Alien series, Anderson was cautious of contradicting continuity in the franchises. He chose to set the film on the remote Norwegian Antarctic island of Bouvet commenting, \\"It's definitely the most hostile environment on Earth and probably the closest to an Alien surface you can get.\\" Anderson thought that setting the film in an urban environment like New York City would break continuity with the Alien series as the protagonist, Ellen Ripley, had no knowledge the creatures existed. \\"You can't have an Alien running around the city now, because it would've been written up and everyone will know about it. So there's nothing in this movie that contradicts anything that already exists.\\" =Casting= alt= The first actor to be cast for Alien vs. Predator was Lance Henriksen, who played the character Bishop in Aliens and Alien 3. Although the Alien films are set hundreds of years in the future, Anderson wanted to keep continuity with the series by including a familiar actor. Henriksen plays billionaire and self-taught-engineer Charles Bishop Weyland, a character that ties in with the Weyland-Yutani Corporation as the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries. According to Anderson, Weyland becomes known for the discovery of the pyramid, and as a result the Weyland-Yutani Corporation models the Bishop android in the Alien films after him; \\"when the Bishop android is created in 150 years time, it's created with the face of the creator. It's kind of like Microsoft building an android in 100 years time that has the face of Bill Gates.\\" Anderson opted for a European cast including Italian actor Raoul Bova, Ewen Bremner from Scotland, and English actor Colin Salmon. Producer Davis said, \\"There's a truly international flavor to the cast, and gives the film a lot of character.\\" Several hundred actresses attended the auditions to be cast as the film's heroine Alexa Woods. Sanaa Lathan was selected, and one week later she flew to Prague to begin filming. The filmmakers knew there would be comparisons to Alien heroine Ellen Ripley and did not want a clone of the character, but wanted to make her similar while adding something different. Anderson reported in an interview that California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was willing to reprise his role as Major Alan \\"Dutch\\" Schaeffer from Predator in a short cameo appearance if he lost the recall election on condition that the filming should take place at his residence. Schwarzenegger, however, won the election with 48.58% of the votes and was unavailable to participate in Alien vs. Predator. Actress Sigourney Weaver, who starred as Ellen Ripley in the Alien series, said she was happy not to be in the film, as a possible crossover was \\"the reason I wanted my character to die in the first place\\", and thought the concept \\"sounded awful\\". =Filming and set designs= Production began in late 2003 at Barrandov Studios in Prague, Czech Republic, where most of the filming took place. Production designer Richard Bridgland was in charge of sets, props and vehicles, based on early concept art Anderson had created to give a broad direction of how things would look. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed at Barrandov Studios, many of which were interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid's carvings, sculptures, and hieroglyphs were influenced by Egyptian, Cambodian, and Aztec civilisations, while the regular shifting of the pyramid's rooms was meant to evoke a sense of claustrophobia similar to the original Alien film. According to Anderson, if he was to build the sets in Los Angeles they would have cost $20 million. However, in Prague they cost $2 million, an important factor when the film's budget was less than $50 million. Third scale miniatures several meters in height were created to give the film the effect of realism, rather than relying on computer generated imagery (CGI). For the whaling station miniatures and life-sized sets, over 700 bags of artificial snow were used (roughly 15‚Äì20 tons). A 4.5-meter miniature of an icebreaker with working lights and a mechanical moving radar was created, costing almost $37,000 and taking 10 weeks to create. Visual effects producer Arthur Windus, claimed miniatures were beneficial in the filming process: \\"With computer graphics, you need to spend a lot of time making it real. With a miniature, you shoot it and its there.\\" A scale 25-meter miniature of the whaling station was created in several months. It was designed so the model could be collapsed and then reconstructed, which proved beneficial for a six- second shot which required a re-shoot. =Effects and creatures= alt= Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated (ADI) was hired for the movie, having previously worked on Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. Visual special effects producers Arthur Windus and John Bruno were in charge of the project, which contained 400 effects shots. ADI founders Alec Gillis, Tom Woodruff Jr. and members of their company, began designing costumes, miniatures and effects in June 2003. For five months the creatures were redesigned, the Predators wrist blades being extended roughly four times longer than those in the Predator films, and a larger mechanical plasma caster was created for the Scar Predator. The basic shape of the Predator mask was kept, although technical details were added and each Predator was given a unique mask to distinguish them from each other. These masks were created using clay, which was used to form moulds to create fiberglass copies. These copies were painted to give a weathered look, which Woodruff claims \\"is what the Predator is all about\\". A hydraulic Alien puppet was created so ADI would be able to make movements faster and give the Alien a \\"slimline and skeletal\\" appearance, rather than using an actor in a suit. The puppet required six people to run it; one for the head and body, two for the arms, and a sixth to make sure the signals were reaching the computer. Movements were recorded in the computer so that puppeteers would be able to repeat moves that Anderson liked. The puppet was used in six shots, including the fight scene with the Predator which took one month to film. The crew tried to keep CGI use to a minimum, as Anderson said people in suits and puppets are scarier than CGI monsters as they are \\"there in the frame\\". Roughly 70% of scenes were created using suits, puppets, and miniatures. The Alien queen was filmed using three variations: a 4.8-meter practical version, a 1.2-meter puppet, and a computer- generated version. The practical version required 12 puppeteers to operate, and CGI tails were added to the Aliens and the queen as they were difficult to animate using puppetry. The queen alien's inner-mouth was automated though, and was powered by a system of hydraulics. Anderson praised Alien director Ridley Scott's and Predator director John McTiernan's abilities at building suspense by not showing the creatures until late in the film, something Anderson wanted to accomplish with Alien vs. Predator. \\"Yes, we make you wait 45 minutes, but once it goes off, from there until the end of the movie, it's fucking relentless\\". Music Austrian composer Harald Kloser was hired to create the film's score. After completing the score for The Day After Tomorrow, Kloser was chosen by Anderson as he is a fan of the franchises. It was recorded in London, and was primarily orchestral as Anderson commented, \\"this is a terrifying movie and it needs a terrifying, classic movie score to go with it; at the same time it's got huge action so it needs that kind of proper orchestral support.\\" The score album was released on iTunes on 9 August 2004, and on CD on 31 August 2004 and received mixed reviews. James Christopher Monger of Allmusic thought Kloser introduced electronic elements well, and called \\"Alien vs. Predator Main Theme a particularly striking and serves as a continuous creative source for the composer to dip his baton in.\\" Mike Brennan of Soundtrack, however, said it \\"lacks the ingenuity of the previous trilogy (Alien) and the Predator scores, which all shared a strong sense of rhythm in place of thematic content. Kloser throws in some interesting percussion cues (\\"Antarctica\\" and \\"Down the Tunnel\\"), but more as a sound effect than a consistent motif.\\" John Fallon of JoBlo.com compared it to character development in the film, \\"too generic to completely engage or leave a permanent impression.\\" Release =Home media= Alien vs. Predator was released on VHS, DVD, and PSP UMD Movies in North America on 25 January 2005. The DVD contained two audio commentaries. The first featured Paul W. S. Anderson, Lance Henriksen, and Sanaa Lathan, while the second included special effects supervisor John Bruno and ADI founders Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff. A 25-minute \\"Making of\\" featurette and a Dark Horse AVP comic cover gallery were included in the special features along with three deleted scenes from the film. On release, Alien vs. Predator debuted at number 1 on the Top DVD Sales and Top Video Rental charts in North America. A two-disc \\"Extreme Edition\\" was released on 7 March 2005, featuring behind the scenes footage of the conception, pre-production, production, post-production, and licensing of the film. An \\"Unrated Edition\\" was released on 22 November 2005, containing the same special features as the Extreme Edition as well as an extra eight minutes of footage in the film. John J. Puccio of DVD Town remarked that the extra footage contained \\"a few more shots of blood, gore, guts, and slime to spice things up...and tiny bits of connecting matter to help us follow the story line better, but none of it amounts to much.\\" Reception =Box office= Alien vs. Predator was released in North America on 13 August 2004 in 3,395 theatres. The film grossed $38.2 million over its opening weekend for an average of $11,278 per theatre, and was number one at the box office. The film spent 16 weeks in cinemas and made $80,282,231 in North America. It grossed $9 million in the United Kingdom, $16 million in Japan, and $8 million in Germany and totalled $97,144,859 at the international box office. This brought the film's worldwide gross to $177,427,090, making it the highest-grossing film in either the Predator or Alien franchises (excluding Prometheus, which grossed over $403 million worldwide). It ranks second behind Aliens at the domestic box office, and fifth behind the first three Alien films and the original Predator film, when adjusted for inflation. =Critical response= The film was not screened in advance for critics and received generally negative reviews. It was praised for its special effects and set design, but received criticism for its dialogue, the \\"fast-paced editing\\" during fight sequences, lighting, and its PG-13 rating. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 21%, based on 148 reviews, with an average rating of 4.09/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Gore without scares and cardboard cut-out characters make this clash of the monsters a dull sit.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 29 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Rick Kisonak of Film Threat praised the film stating, \\"For a big dumb production about a movie monster smackdown, Alien vs. Predator is a surprisingly good time\\". Ian Grey of the Orlando Weekly felt, \\"Anderson clearly relished making this wonderful, utterly silly film; his heart shows in every drip of slime.\\" Staci Layne Wilson of Horror.com called it \\"a pretty movie to look at with its grandiose sets and top notch creature FX, but it's a lot like Anderson's previous works in that it's all facade and no foundation.\\" Gary Dowell of The Dallas Morning News called the film, \\"a transparent attempt to jumpstart two run-down franchises\\". Ed Halter of The Village Voice described the film's lighting for fight sequences as, \\"black-on-black-in-blackness\\", while Ty Burr of The Boston Globe felt the lighting \\"left the audience in the dark\\". Other media =Sequel= A sequel titled Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem was released in December 2007. =Pinball= Zen Studios developed a virtual pinball table based on the premise and setting (though not the plot) of the film, releasing it on 26 April 2016 as an add-on pack for Zen Pinball 2, Pinball FX 2 and Pinball FX 3. Instead of providing a condensed version of the events of the film, the Alien vs. Predator pinball table features an original storyline that focuses on a Predator's journey to become a seasoned warrior and Alien hunter. The table's score display plays clips from the film itself, while Woods and De Rosa are its announcers, observing and commenting on the Predator's actions with mostly newly recorded voice lines.

More explicitly, a topological space T is second-countable if there exists some countable collection \\\\mathcal{U} = \\\\\\\\{U_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} of open subsets of T such that any open subset of T can be written as a union of elements of some subfamily of \\\\mathcal{U}. A second-countable space is said to satisfy the second axiom of countability. Like other countability axioms, the property of being second-countable restricts the number of open sets that a space can have. Many \\"well-behaved\\" spaces in mathematics are second-countable. For example, Euclidean space (Rn) with its usual topology is second-countable. Although the usual base of open balls is uncountable, one can restrict to the collection of all open balls with rational radii and whose centers have rational coordinates. This restricted set is countable and still forms a basis. Properties Second-countability is a stronger notion than first- countability. A space is first-countable if each point has a countable local base. Given a base for a topology and a point x, the set of all basis sets containing x forms a local base at x. Thus, if one has a countable base for a topology then one has a countable local base at every point, and hence every second-countable space is also a first-countable space. However any uncountable discrete space is first-countable but not second-countable. Second-countability implies certain other topological properties. Specifically, every second-countable space is separable (has a countable dense subset) and Lindel√∂f (every open cover has a countable subcover). The reverse implications do not hold. For example, the lower limit topology on the real line is first-countable, separable, and Lindel√∂f, but not second-countable. For metric spaces, however, the properties of being second-countable, separable, and Lindel√∂f are all equivalent.Willard, theorem 16.11, p. 112 Therefore, the lower limit topology on the real line is not metrizable. In second-countable spaces--as in metric spaces--compactness, sequential compactness, and countable compactness are all equivalent properties. Urysohn's metrization theorem states that every second-countable, Hausdorff regular space is metrizable. It follows that every such space is completely normal as well as paracompact. Second-countability is therefore a rather restrictive property on a topological space, requiring only a separation axiom to imply metrizability. =Other properties= *A continuous, open image of a second-countable space is second-countable. *Every subspace of a second- countable space is second-countable. *Quotients of second-countable spaces need not be second-countable; however, open quotients always are. *Any countable product of a second-countable space is second-countable, although uncountable products need not be. *The topology of a second-countable T_1 space has cardinality less than or equal to c (the cardinality of the continuum). *Any base for a second-countable space has a countable subfamily which is still a base. *Every collection of disjoint open sets in a second- countable space is countable.  Examples and counterexamples  * Consider the disjoint countable union X = [0,1] \\\\cup [2,3] \\\\cup [4,5] \\\\cup \\\\dots \\\\cup [2k, 2k+1] \\\\cup \\\\dotsb. Define an equivalence relation and a quotient topology by identifying the left ends of the intervals - that is, identify 0 ~ 2 ~ 4 ~ ‚Ä¶ ~ 2k and so on. X is second-countable, as a countable union of second- countable spaces. However, X/~ is not first-countable at the coset of the identified points and hence also not second-countable. * The above space is not homeomorphic to the same set of equivalence classes endowed with the obvious metric: i.e. regular Euclidean distance for two points in the same interval, and the sum of the distances to the left hand point for points not in the same interval -- yielding a strictly weaker topology than the above space. It is a separable metric space (consider the set of rational points), and hence is second-countable. * The long line is not second-countable, but it is first-countable.

Early years Holly Near was born in Ukiah, California, in 1949 and was raised on a ranch in Potter Valley, California. She was eight years old when she first performed publicly, and she auditioned for Columbia Records when she was ten. She sang in all the high school musicals, talent shows and often was invited to sing at gatherings of local service groups, such as the Soroptimist Club, Lions Club, and Garden Club. Her senior year she played Eliza Doolittle in the Ukiah High School production of My Fair Lady. In the summer Near attended performing arts camps such as Perry-Mansfield in Colorado and Ramblerny Performing Arts where she studied with jazz musicians Phil Woods and his wife, Chan Parker (Parker was married to Woods but retained the name Parker from her earlier marriage to Charlie Parker), and modern dancer/choreographer Joyce Trisler. After starting high school in 1963, Near began singing with three boys who called themselves the Freedom Singers, a folk group modeled after The Kingston Trio. When Near joined, they began to sound more like The Weavers, with three male voices and one female. Near learned later of the original Freedom Singers who sang as part of the Civil Rights Movement. Unbeknownst to her, Near would soon meet one of the founding members of that group, Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon, an artist who would be a great influence for the next 40-plus years. She would also meet and work with the female singer in The Weavers, Ronnie Gilbert. After high school, Near enrolled in the Theatre Arts program at UCLA; her freshman year she got the lead in the UCLA production of Guys and Dolls playing soprano Sarah Brown. Because Near was trained in a lower range she got nodules on her vocal chords and had to leave the show. She entered in to a long period of silence until her voice healed. After one year, she left UCLA and began to work in film and television as well as with anti-war groups such as Another Mother for Peace. Career Near Performs at March For Women's Lives 2004 ‚Äì Photograph by Patty Mooney Near's professional career began in 1969 with a part on the television show The Mod Squad, which was followed by appearances in other shows, such as Room 222, All in the Family, and The Partridge Family. She also appeared in films such as Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, and Minnie and Moskowitz, and had a prominent role in the 1991 film Dogfight. She was briefly a member of the musical comedy troupe First National Nothing and appeared on the troupe's only album If You Sit Real Still and Hold My Hand, You Will Hear Absolutely Nothing, released in 1970 on Columbia Records. In 1970, Near was a cast member of the Broadway musical Hair. Following the Kent State shootings in May of that year, the entire cast staged a silent vigil in protest. The song \\"It Could Have Been Me\\" (released on A Live Album, 1974) was her response to the shootings. In 1971, she joined the FTA (Free The Army) Tour, an anti-Vietnam War road show of music, comedy, and plays that performed for soldiers, many of whom were resisting war and racism from within the military. The tour was organized by antiwar activist Fred Gardner and actors Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland. Near was only 21 and the youngest member of the troupe. In 1972, Near founded an independent record label called Redwood Records to produce and promote music by \\"politically conscious artists from around the world\\". She was one of the first women to found an independent record company. Near's record company went out of business in the mid-1990s due to financial difficulties. During her long career in folk and protest music, Near has worked with a wide array of musicians, including Ronnie Gilbert, Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Mercedes Sosa, Bernice Johnson Reagon, Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, Meg (Shambhavi) Christian, Cris Williamson, Linda Tillery, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs, Harry Belafonte, and many others, as well as the Chilean exile group Inti-Illimani. Near wrote an autobiography in the early 1990s titled Fire in the Rain, Singer in the Storm. Later, with her sister Timothy, Near co-wrote a one-woman show based on the stories in the book. The show was presented at The San Jose Rep and in Los Angeles at The Mark Taper Forum, as well as productions in San Francisco and off Broadway in NYC. In April 2004, Near performed at the March for Women's Lives in Washington, DC where she sang \\"We Are Gentle Angry People\\" and \\"Fired Up\\" a capella. As of 2019, she has a discography of 29 albums. She is still active as a performer and composer, and she has begun issuing CDs available through her website that include tracks from her out-of- print albums. Her song \\"Singing For Our Lives\\" appears in Singing the Living Tradition, the official hymnal of the Unitarian Universalist Association, under the title \\"We Are A Gentle, Angry People\\" (Hymn #170). The hymn was performed by Quaker Friends in an episode of the TV series Six Feet Under. In 2015, the same song, credited as \\"Singing for Our Lives\\" appeared in the Australian independent film The Lives We Lead, alongside its theme song \\"I Am Willing\\", another protest song written by Near. Near hosted many of the tributes to both Pete Seeger and Ronnie Gilbert, two members of the seminal folk group The Weavers. Near has been an honored guest at several of the GALA Choruses Festivals, a conference of GLBTQ choirs and choruses. She also appears as a soloist with several of the choruses and many of her songs have been arranged for choral singing. In 2018, Near released a new recording titled 2018, reflecting on issues including the environment, aging, domestic violence and the unresolved storm damage in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria. In October 2018, a documentary film titled Holly Near: Singing for Our Lives made by director Jim Brown premiered at the Mill Valley Film Festival, detailing Near's life and work. Personal life As a result of her travels in the Pacific with the FTA show, Near became a feminist, linking international feminism and anti-war activism. In 1976, Near came out as a lesbian and began a three-year relationship with musician Meg Christian. She added LGBT issues to her international peace work as she continued to present social change music around the world and at home. Although Near was one of the most visible artists in the lesbian community, she was also becoming aware that \\"monogamous\\" defined her sexuality more than any other title. Near has been in a relationship with a man since 1994. However, she does not identify as bisexual. When asked why in a 2010 interview by JD Doyle for Queer Music Heritage, she replied, That said, Near is dedicated to the rights of LGBTQ+ communities and continues to work to create a cultural forum for diversity. Near writes, \\"For many, sexual identity and/or gender identity is the primary door through which they walk. It is what politicized them. It is what feeds their emotional and spiritual perspectives. I totally honor this. Even though sexual preference is maybe 5th or 10th on my personal list of priorities now, I will always work for all of us to have self determination over our bodies, our identities, our relationship choices.\\" In 2014, Near was diagnosed with breast cancer. With early detection, she had successful surgery and radiation but did not need to do chemotherapy. Near spent one year traveling across the US camping out of her car and staying with friends. She then went to Argentina and Chile to study and write. She currently rents a one bedroom apartment in Sonoma County, California and she spends a lot of time in New York City. She drives a 2003 Volkswagen. Near is \\"auntie\\" and \\"grandma\\" to several young people even though she never had children. Awards and honors Near has been recognized many times for her work for social change, including honors from the ACLU, the National Lawyers Guild, the National Organization for Women, NARAS, Ms. Magazine (Woman of the Year), and the Legends of Women's Music Award. In 1989, Near received a Doctorate of Humane Letters from World College West in California. Near was named among the \\"1000 Women for the Nobel Peace Prize\\". Near was named as an Honoree for National Women's History Month for 2015.

His bourgeois family did not approve of a musical career for him, and he studied law in Paris and then worked as a civil servant until the age of thirty-nine while immersing himself in the modernist artistic life of the French capital and composing in his spare time. From 1880 until his final illness he was a full-time composer. Although known primarily for two of his orchestral works, Espa√±a and Joyeuse marche, Chabrier left a corpus of operas (including L'√©toile), songs, and piano music, but no symphonies, concertos, quartets, sonatas, or religious or liturgical music. His lack of academic training left him free to create his own musical language, unaffected by established rules, and he was regarded by many later composers as an important innovator and a catalyst who paved the way for French modernism. He was admired by, and influenced, composers as diverse as Debussy, Ravel, Richard Strauss, Satie, Stravinsky, and the group of composers known as Les six. Writing at a time when French musicians were generally proponents or opponents of the music of Wagner, Chabrier steered a middle course, sometimes incorporating Wagnerian traits into his music and at other times avoiding them. Chabrier was associated with some of the leading writers and painters of his time. Among his closest friends was the painter √âdouard Manet, and Chabrier collected Impressionist paintings long before they became fashionable. A number of such paintings from his personal collection by artists known to him are now housed in some of the world's leading art museums. He penned a large number of letters to friends and colleagues which offer an insight into his musical opinions and character. Chabrier died in Paris at the age of fifty-three from a neurological disease, probably caused by syphilis. Life =Early years= Chabrier's birthplace in Ambert Chabrier was born in Ambert, (Puy-de-D√¥me), a town in the Auvergne region of central France.Huebner, Steven. \\"Chabrier, (Alexis-)Emmanuel\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 2001. Retrieved 15 September 2018 He was the only son of a lawyer, Jean Chabrier, and his wife, Marie-Anne-Evelina, n√©e Durosay or Durozay.Servi√®res, p. 4Poulenc, p. 23 The Chabriers were of old Auvergne stock, originally of peasant origin (the surname comes from \\"chevrier\\" ‚Äì goat-herd), but in recent generations merchants and lawyers had predominated in the family.Prod'homme, p. 463 A key member of the household was the boy's nanny Anne Delayre (whom he called \\"Nanine\\" and \\"Nanon\\"), who remained close to him throughout her life. Chabrier began taking music lessons at the age of six; his early teachers were from cosmopolitan backgrounds: at Ambert he studied with a Carlist Spanish refugee called Saporta, and after the family moved to Clermont-Ferrand in 1852 he studied at the Lyc√©e imperial with a Polish musician, Alexander Tarnovsky. The earliest of Chabrier's compositions to survive in manuscript are piano works from 1849. A piano piece, Le Scalp!!! (1856) was later modified into the Marche des Cipayes (1863). The first piece to which the composer gave an opus number was a waltz for piano, Julia, op. 1, 1857. Tarnovky advised Chabrier's parents that their son was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but Jean Chabrier was determined that his son should follow him into the legal profession.Poulenc, p. 24 He moved the family to Paris in 1856, so that Chabrier could enrol at the Lyc√©e Saint-Louis. From there Chabrier went on to law school, but did not neglect music, continuing his studies in composition, violin and piano.Soumagnac, Myriam. \\"Chabrier, (Alexis-)Emmanuel ‚Äì Opera\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 1992. Retrieved 15 September 2018 After graduating from the law school in 1861 he joined the French civil service at the Ministry of the Interior, where he worked for nineteen years. =Paris: dual harness = Chabrier was well regarded at the ministry, but his passion was music, to which he devoted his free time. He continued his studies, with teachers including Edouard Wolff (de) (piano), Richard Hammer (violin), Th√©ophile Semet (fr) and Aristide Hignard (both composition).Prod'homme, p. 451 In a study of the composer published in 1935 Jacques-Gabriel Prod'homme commented that it would be wrong to class Chabrier as merely an amateur in this period: \\"For, while in quest of the technique of his art, he displayed a curiosity in the painting and literature of the 'modernists' of his day that, among musicians, had few parallels.\\"Prod'homme, p. 452 From 1862 Chabrier was among the circle of the Parnassians in Paris. Among his friends were Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam and Paul Verlaine; with the latter he planned a comic opera in the fashionable style of Offenbach, Vaucochard et fils Ier. He did not complete it, but four fragments (dating from about 1864 or 1865) have survived. His full-time official post severely restricted Chabrier's ability to compose large-scale works. He began an opera on a Hungarian historical theme entitled Jean Hunyade, to a libretto by Henri Fouquier, but abandoned it, after completing four numbers, in 1867. In December 1872 he scored a success at a private theatre club, the Cercle de l'union artistique with a three-act op√©rette bouffe Le Service obligatoire written in collaboration with two other composers, and which according to Victorin de Jonci√®res was acclaimed by the audience as undoubted proof of Chabrier's talent.Delage 1999, p. 109 (libretto and score have not survived) Another attempt at operatic comedy, Fisch-Ton-Kan, with Verlaine and Lucien Viotti, was performed in March 1875 at the same club with Chabrier at the piano; five fragments survive. He did not set any poems by Villiers de L'Isle Adam or Verlaine, although the latter wrote a sonnet √Ä Emmanuel Chabrier (published in Amour, 1888) as a remembrance of their friendship.Correspondance: 88‚Äì112. Chabrier by √âdouard Detaille (1873) There are several descriptions of Chabrier's piano-playing at around this time; many years later the composer Vincent d'Indy wrote, \\"Though his arms were too short, his fingers too thick and his whole manner somewhat clumsy, he managed to achieve a degree of finesse and a command of expression that very few pianists ‚Äì with the exception of Liszt and Rubinstein ‚Äì have surpassed.\\"Myers, p. 50 The composer and critic Alfred Bruneau said of Chabrier, \\"he played the piano as no one has ever played it before, or ever will‚Ä¶\\"Myers, p. 6 The wife of the painter Renoir, a friend of the composer, wrote: Both Chabrier's parents died within the space of eight days in 1869.Servi√®res, p. 10 During the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871) and Commune, he continued in his official post as the ministry moved from Tours to Bordeaux then to Versailles. In 1873 he married Marie Alice Dejean, the granddaughter of Louis Dejean, who had gained his fortune as founder and manager of the Cirque d'√©t√© and the Cirque Napol√©on.Delage, 1999, p.166-168. Alice and Chabrier had three sons, one of whom died at birth.Delage (1982), p. 24Correspondance: 83-13n ‚Äì the youngest, Andr√©, was born in the ladies only room at the Gare de Lyon, Bercy, on 28 April 1879. Chabrier's friends in Paris included the composers Gabriel Faur√©, Ernest Chausson, and d'Indy;Poulenc, p. 26 painters including Henri Fantin-Latour, Edgar Degas and √âdouard Manet, whose Thursday soir√©es Chabrier attended; and writers such as √âmile Zola, Alphonse Daudet, Jean Mor√©as, Jean Richepin and St√©phane Mallarm√©.Myers, p. 7 During the 1870s Chabrier began several stage works. The first to be completed was a three-act op√©ra-bouffe L'√©toile (The Star), commissioned by the Bouffes- Parisiens, the spiritual home of Offenbach. He secured the commission through his many contacts in the world of arts and letters: he had met the librettists, Albert Vanloo and Eug√®ne Leterrier through the painter Alphonse Hirsch, whom he had got to know as a member of Manet's set.Poulenc, p. 30 The opera was modestly successful, running for 48 performances in 1877, but was not revived in his lifetime. Nonetheless it brought him to the attention of the press and attracted the publishing firm Enoch & Costallat, who published his works during the rest of his life. Above all, as a result of L'√©toile he ceased to be regarded as a talented amateur.Poulenc, p. 31 The same year Saint-Saens gave the first public performance of his 1865 Impromptu,Delage p.688 (dedicated to Madame Manet) his first piano piece of real importance with his personal stamp of originality.Myers, p.109. =Full-time composer= Manet, Ordrupgaard Museum, Denmark Like many progressively-minded French composers of the time, Chabrier was greatly interested in the music of Wagner. As a young man he had copied out the full score of Tannh√§user to gain an insight into the composer's creative process. On a trip to Munich with Henri Duparc and others in March 1880, Chabrier first saw Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde; he wrote to the personnel director at the ministry saying he had to go to Bordeaux on private matters, but in confidence confessed that for ten years he had wanted to see and hear Wagner's opera, and promised that he would back at his desk the following Wednesday.Delage p.243 D'Indy, who was among the group, recorded that Chabrier was moved to tears at hearing the music, saying of the prelude, \\"I have waited ten years of my life to hear that A in the cellos\\".Prod'homme, p, 453 This event led Chabrier to conclude that he must single-mindedly pursue his vocation as a composer, and after several periods of absence he left the Ministry of the Interior in late 1880. In a 2001 study, Steven Huebner writes that there may have been additional factors in Chabrier's decision: \\"the growing momentum of his musical career ‚Ä¶ his high hopes for the Gwendoline project, and the first signs of a nervous disorder, probably the result of a syphilitic condition, that would claim his life 14 years later.\\" The project to which Huebner refers was the operatic tragedy Gwendoline, on which Chabrier had begun working in 1879.Poulenc, p. 46 The librettist was Catulle Mend√®s, described by the pianist and scholar Graham Johnson as \\"a relentlessly ambitious member of the literary establishment\\".Johnson, p. 279 Mend√®s wrote texts that were set by at least seven French composers, including Faur√©, Massenet, Debussy and Messager; none of his operatic works were successful, and Johnson rates the libretto for Gwendoline as \\"catastrophic\\". Chabrier worked on the piece until 1885. The conductor Charles Lamoureux appointed Chabrier as his chorus master and r√©p√©titeur, and included his music in the Lamoureux Orchestra's concerts. In 1881 Chabrier's piano cycle Pi√®ces pittoresques was premiered. C√©sar Franck commented, \\"We have just heard something extraordinary: this music links our time with that of Couperin and Rameau\\".Quoted in Howat, p. x Chabrier travelled to London (1882) and Brussels (1883) to hear Wagner's Ring cycle,Delage (1982), p. 25 and in 1882 Chabrier and his wife visited Spain, which resulted in his most famous work, Espa√±a (1883), a mixture of popular airs he had heard and his own original themes. It was premiered under its dedicatee, Lamoureux, in November 1883. It met with what Poulenc calls \\"immediate and rapturous success\\", made Chabrier's reputation, and by public demand received multiple performances over the next months.Poulenc, p. 43 Admirers included de Falla, who stated that he did not think any Spanish composer had succeeded in achieving so genuine a version of the jota as in the piece,De Falla, Manuel. Manuel de Falla ‚Äì On Music and Musicians, with introduction and notes by Federico Sope√±a, translated by David Urman and J M Thomson. Marion Boyars, London & Boston, 1950, 1979, p95 (in Notes on Maurice Ravel, dated 1939). The Paris Op√©ra declined to present Gwendoline, which was premiered at La Monnaie in Brussels under Henry Verdhurdt in 1886. It was well received, but closed after two performances because the impresario went bankrupt. William Mann wrote of the music that \\"in full, rapturous cognizance of mature Wagner\\", Chabrier composed \\"great music ...such as the long solo and choral ensemble, 'Soyez unis', and all the love duet music, and there is more Frenchman than Wagner in them, above all in the final Liebestod\\".Mann, William. University and Student performances ‚Äì Gwendoline. Opera ‚Äì May 1983, Vol 34 No 5, p568, 570. While striving for a staging of his opera Chabrier was also working on some of his mature songs ‚Äì Sommation irrespectueuse, Tes yeux bleus, Chanson pour Jeanne, Lied, as well as a lyric scene for mezzo, women's chorus and orchestra La Sulamite and the piano version of the Joyeuse Marche. He then found a new lyric project to tackle ‚Äì Le roi malgr√© lui (The King in Spite of Himself) ‚Äì and completed the score in six months. It was premiered at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris, and a favourable reception seemed to promise a successful run, but the theatre burned down after the third performance.Poulenc, p. 56 Through Chabrier's friendship with the Belgian tenor Ernest van Dyck and subsequently the conductor Felix Mottl, directors of opera houses in Leipzig and Munich expressed interest in both works and Chabrier made several happy trips to Germany as a result; his works were given in seven German cities.Delage (1963), pp. 80 and 82‚Äì83 In July 1888 he was appointed as a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur. Chabrier left a rich and exuberant body of correspondence; Myers sees the \\"letter-writer's gift of spontaneous self-expression, with no undertones of insincerity or of writing for effect\\".Myers, p. 137 He expressed himself in \\"Rabelaisian language\\" and \\"laced with a profusion of racy slang\\".Myers, p. 129 In 1994 the musical scholar Roger Delage, with Frans Durif and Thierry Bodin, produced a 1,300 page edition of the composer's correspondence, containing 1,149 letters, ranging from those to his family and Nanine, exchanges with contemporary friends in the musical world (sometimes with musical quotations),Correspondance, 89‚Äì14 is a message set to music to d'Indy. negotiations with publishers, and one a commiseration with his son Andr√© on the death of his pet bird (with gentle reproach for having over-fed the creature).Correspondence 92‚Äì24 =Decline and final years= Chabrier's tomb, Montparnasse cemetery (division 9), Paris. In his final years, Chabrier was troubled by financial problems caused by the collapse of his bankers, failing health brought on by the terminal stage of syphilis, and depression about the neglect of his stage works in France. The death of his beloved \\"Nanine\\" in January 1891 greatly affected him. In 1892, he wrote to his friend Charles Lecocq, \\"Never has an artist more loved, more tried to honour music than me, none has suffered more from it; and I will go on suffering from it for ever\\". He became obsessed with the composition of his final opera Bris√©√Øs, which was inspired by a tragedy of Goethe and has melodic echoes of Wagner; he completed only one act. The Paris premi√®re of Gwendoline, finally took place in December 1893. The composer, ailing physically and mentally, sitting in a stage box with his family, enjoyed the music but did not realise he had written it, nor did he understand that the applause was for him.Prod'homme, p. 455 Chabrier succumbed to general paresis in the last year of his life, dying in Paris at the age of 53. Although he had asked to be buried near the tomb of Manet in the Cimeti√®re de Passy, a plot was not available and he was interred in the Cimeti√®re du Montparnasse.Poulenc, p. 67 His widow and children also suffered from probable infection: she had severe eye problems, becoming almost blind, and, after Chabrier's death, became paraplegic, dying aged 51; the eldest son, Marcel, died at 35 having also displayed related symptoms, and the second son, Charles, died after only five weeks, the youngest, Andr√©, also became paraplegic and died also aged 35.Girard, Jacques.

Champeti√®res : √âd. de la Montmarie ; [S.l.] : Parc Livradois-Forez, DL 2009, p248; in this chapter XXVIII Girard, a consultant in neuro- psychiatry, examines in detail Chabrier's illness. Works Vincent d'Indy called Chabrier \\"that great primitive ... a very great artist\\".Poulenc, p. 75 In The Oxford Companion to Music (2011), Denis Arnold and Roger Nichols write that Chabrier's lack of a formal musical education at one of the major conservatoires allowed him the freedom to \\"bypass the normal paths of French music of the 1860s, and to explore a new harmonic idiom and especially a novel way of writing for the piano\\".Arnold, Denis and Roger Nichols \\"Chabrier, Emmanuel\\", The Oxford Companion to Music, Oxford University Press, 2011 Chabrier's musical language introduced several striking features. Among them, Huebner singles out a liking for melodies of wide range with large leaps from one note to the next; frequent doubling of melodies by the bass or in octaves; a mixture of orthodox and unorthodox chromatic decoration; and frequent use of cross-rhythms and syncopation. Chabrier is reported to have said, \\"My music rings with the stamp of my Auvergnat clogs\\", and the pianist and scholar Roy Howat points to examples of this in fast stamping rhythms in the Bourr√©e fantasque, the Joyeuse marche and several of the Pi√®ces pittoresques.Howat, p. ix =Orchestral= 1890 edition of Joyeuse marche Duparc and Ravel both had reservations about Chabrier's skills as an orchestrator in his early works; Poulenc disagreed, feeling that Chabrier was a master of orchestration from an early stage.Poulenc, pp. 65‚Äì66; and Nichols, p. 117 Poulenc wrote, \\"The fact that Chabrier always composed at the piano ‚Äì as did Debussy and Stravinsky ‚Äì did not prevent him from finding a rare orchestral colour: a unique achievement at a time when Franck, d'Indy and Saint-Sa√´ns hardly ever emerged from well-worn paths\\". The work for which Chabrier is best known is his rhapsody Espa√±a, which became popular internationally (except in Spain, where it was not a success). The rhythmic verve of Espa√±a is found also in the Joyeuse marche, which goes further in orchestral invention.Poulenc, p. 58 Not all of Chabrier's orchestral pieces are in this exuberant vein: his Lamento (1874), unpublished in his lifetime, is an unusually poignant work.Battioni, Isabelle (1999). Notes to Naxos CD 8.554248 A few of Chabrier's piano works were later orchestrated. The composer arranged the four movements of the Suite pastorale from the ten Pi√®ces pittoresques. Chabrier began an orchestration of Bourr√©e fantasque in 1891 (completed in 1994 by Robin Holloway) but his friend and champion Felix Mottl orchestrated it in 1898, proving popular; he did the same for Trois valses romantiques in 1900, and in 1917‚Äì18 Ravel arranged the \\"Menuet pompeux\\" from the Pi√®ces pittoresques. =Stage works= Chabrier's ebullient orchestral works have always been popular with the public and critics, but there is less agreement about his serious stage works, and in particular the influence of the music of Wagner. For some critics, the Wagnerian ethos and French sensibilities are simply incompatible, and consequently much of the music of Gwendoline and Bris√©√Øs has been denigrated; others have argued that Chabrier so transformed his influences that the music does not sound especially Wagnerian. Huebner puts the truth somewhere between the two, noting Wagner's influence in the similarities between Gwendoline and The Flying Dutchman and Tristan and Isolde, but noting Chabrier's \\"un- Wagnerian concision\\", the retention of conventional self-contained numbers, and Chabrier's recognisable melodic and instrumental characteristics. He suggests that preoccupation with supposed derivativeness has deprived the repertory of works such as Gwendoline \\"with substantial musical and dramatic interest\\".Huebner, p. viii Scene from first Paris production of Gwendoline, 1893 L'etoile, an op√©ra bouffe in three acts (1877) was Chabrier's first modestly successful opera, and is the most often revived.\\"Chabrier, (Alexis-)Emmanuel (1841‚Äì1894)\\", OperaBase.

Mend√®s's libretto was a liability: Henri B√ºsser commented that it lacked the verve and movement the composer needed;Busser, Henri. \\"Emmanuel Chabrier\\", Revue Des Deux Mondes, May 1971, pp. 314‚Äì318. In French. Poulenc was dismissive of \\"Mend√®s' ineptitudes ‚Ä¶ balderdash\\";Poulenc, pp. 27 and 50 and another critic wrote in 1996, \\"Mendes's dramaturgy is not only painfully thin but takes a long time to get under way\\".Salter, Lionel. \\"Chabrier: Gwendoline\\", Gramophone, October 1996 Arnold and Nichols comment that the work is considerably less Wagnerian than has often been supposed: \\"certainly the modal, asymmetrical, loosely articulated theme of the overture is individual to a degree\\". The music satisfied neither the pro- nor anti-Wagner lobby: Chabrier commented, \\"The wagn√©rien calls me a reactionary and the bourgeois considers me a wagn√©rien\\".Huebner, p. 279 The opera has been revived from time to time, but has not gained a regular place in the international repertory. Arnold and Nichols write that some of Chabrier's best music went into his comic opera Le Roi malgr√© lui (Op√©ra-Comique, 1887), \\"but unfortunately the work is saddled with one of the most complex and incomprehensible librettos of all time\\". Ravel so loved the piece that he said he would rather have written it than Wagner's Ring cycle; reviewing a rare revival in 2003 the critic Edward Greenfield commented that despite the plot, the music made one see Ravel's point.Greenfield, Edward. \\"Le Roi Malgre Lui: Grange Park\\", The Guardian, 1 July 2003 After the same production, the critic Rupert Christiansen wrote, \\"Le Roi malgre lui doesn't know whether it's a Carry On farce by Offenbach or a nationalist epic by Wagner. Perhaps \\"grand operetta\\" is the best way of describing this problem piece\\".Christiansen Rupert. \\"Enjoyable despite itself\\", The Daily Telegraph, 1 July 2003 Chabrier's last opera was Bris√©√Øs, to another libretto by Mend√®s. Mortally ill, Chabrier could only complete the first of the projected three acts, and the remaining sketches were too inconclusive for any of his colleagues to attempt a completion.Larner, Gerald (1995). Notes to Hyperion CD CDH55428 It was to have been a romantic tragedy, set in Corinth during time of the Roman Empire. The existing act is rarely staged, but a recording of a concert performance in 1994 has been issued on CD. Poulenc was unimpressed by the libretto, but Messager thought the music of Bris√©√Øs showed what heights Chabrier might have reached had he lived.Poulenc, pp. 63 and 77 =Piano= Although the piano works are not the best known part of Chabrier's oeuvre, Poulenc put the cycle Pi√®ces pittoresques on a par with Debussy's Preludes in its importance for French music.Howat, p.ix In his introduction to a 1995 edition of the piano works, Howat writes that it was Chabrier, more than any other composer, who restored to French music \\"the essential French traits of clarity, emotional vitality, wit and tenderness\\" when other French composers were under the influence of Wagner or of dry academicism. Chabrier's early works were for piano solo, and in addition to a small corpus of about twenty completed mature works, some juvenilia have survived. Most of the piano pieces were published in the composer's lifetime, but five completed works and the unfinished Capriccio (1883) were issued posthumously.Cushman, Robert (1994) Notes to Vox CD set CDX 5108 Some of the mature works are better known in their later orchestral versions, including the Joyeuse marche and the four numbers from the Pi√®ces pittoresques that make up the Suite pastorale. The trip to Spain that inspired Espa√±a also gave Chabrier the material for a Habanera (1885) which became one of his most popular piano works. Among Chabrier's works for four hands is Souvenirs de Munich. Although Wagner's Tristan und Isolde had made a deep impression on him, his irreverent nature led him to arrange five themes from the opera into a comic quadrille. Poulenc called it \\"irresistibly funny ‚Ä¶ Tristan's principal themes with false noses and added beards.\\"Poulenc, p. 57 Vincent d'Indy wrote, after studying the Trois valses romantiques and playing them with the composer: \\"I thus worked on these three waltzes con amore, doing my best to perform all the indications marked with the greatest precision... and there are many of them! In rehearsal, which was at Pleyel's, Chabrier stopped me dead in the midst of the first waltz, and, addressing me a look that was both amazed and arch, said: \\"But my dear boy it's not that at all!...\\" And, as not quite knowing how to react, I asked for explanations, he retorted: \\"You play that as if it were music by a Member of the Institute!...\\" And than I had a marvellous lesson in playing alla Chabrier; contrary accents, pianissimi to the point of extinction, sudden fire-crackers bursting out in the middle of the most exquisite softness, and also indispensable gesturing, giving over the body, too, to the intention of the music\\".Roger Delage (translated by John Underwood).

Chabrier was an important influence on Debussy, as he was later on Ravel and Poulenc;Orenstein, p. 219; and Poulenc, p. 54 Howat has written that Chabrier's piano music such as \\"Sous-bois\\" and \\"Mauresque\\" in the Pi√®ces pittoresques explored new sound- worlds of which Debussy made effective use 30 years later.DeVoto, Mark. \\"The Art of French Piano Music: Debussy, Ravel, Faur√©, Chabrier\\", Notes, June 2010, p. 790 =Songs= There are forty-three published songs by Chabrier. He began writing songs ‚Äì m√©lodies ‚Äì when he was about twenty-one; the first nine were written between 1862 and 1866. Johnson comments that it is strange that in all his songs Chabrier never set anything by his friend Verlaine, but among the well-known poets whose verse Chabrier set in the early songs were Th√©odore de Banville (\\"Lied\\") and Alfred de Musset (\\"Adieux √† Suzon\\"). In 1888 Chabrier made sixteen arrangements of French folk songs for an anthology called Le plus jolies chansons du pays de France. He was among the first important composers to work with folk songs, a pioneer for Ravel, Bart√≥k, Britten and others. Johnson writes that Chabrier's touch in these pieces is \\"deceptively light and restrained\\", but that the piano writing continually adds enormously to the charm of the music. A later group of songs (1889) with a linking theme is what Chabrier called his \\"poultry farm\\", to lyrics by Edmond Rostand and Rosemonde G√©rard, with subjects including fat turkeys, little ducklings, pink pigs and chirping cicadas. Most of the songs are for solo voice and piano, but there is one duet (the comic \\"Duo de l'ouvresse de l'Op√©ra-Comique\\", 1888) and in Chabrier's setting of Baudelaire's \\"L'invitation au voyage\\" (1870), the voice and piano are joined by a solo bassoon. Chabrier's last song, \\"Ode √† la Musique\\", to words by Rostand, is for solo soprano, piano and female choir.Johnson, Graham (2002). Notes to Hyperion CD set CDA67133/4 Influence The musicologist David Charlton evaluated his influence by saying \\"While the musical language of Reyer, Massenet and Saint-Saens presented syntheses of current practice, that of Emmanuel Chabrier (1841‚Äì1894) was a catalyst: his work became the cradle of French modernism\\".The New Oxford History of Music. Romanticism 1830‚Äì1890. Vol IX, VI Opera 1850‚Äì90 (b) France ‚Äì David Charlton. P405-409. Debussy, Ravel and Poulenc all acknowledged Chabrier's influence on their music. Debussy wrote in 1893 \\"Chabrier, Moussorgsky, Palestrina, voil√† ce que j'aime\\" ‚Äì they are what I love,Howat (2011), p. 34 and said that he could not have written La Damoiselle √©lue without Chabrier's La sulamite as a model. Huebner remarks on echoes of Chabrier in Debussy's \\"La soir√©e dans Grenade\\" in Estampes, and the piano prelude \\"G√©n√©ral Lavine ‚Äì excentric\\". The influence on Ravel is still more marked. In a 1975 study of the two composers, Delage wrote, \\"In truth there are few works by Ravel which do not to some extent echo one or another work of Chabrier and of which the harmonic procedures are not derived from him\\".Delage (1975), p. 550 Ravel paid explicit homage to Chabrier in his A la mani√®re de Chabrier, based on Chabrier's piano piece M√©lancolie. Poulenc said that he had L'√©toile in mind while he wrote Les mamelles de Tir√©sias. Huebner comments that the influence of Chabrier on Poulenc and the other members of Les Six was particularly strong, although the later composers were more often drawn to the humorous, parodic side of Chabrier's oeuvre than to the romantic and serious. Other French composers whose music shows the influence of Chabrier include Charles Lecocq, Messager and Satie.Delage (1975), p. 547 Composers from other countries who works show the influence of Chabrier include Stravinsky, whose Petrushka has thematic and melodic echoes of Chabrier, and Mahler, who called Espa√±a \\"the beginnings of modern music\\"Quoted in Delage (1999), p. 290 and alluded to the \\"Dance Villageoise\\" in the Rondo Burleske movement of his Ninth Symphony.Woods, Kenneth. \\"Expert's Perspective: Mahler 9, A Bitter Burlesque\\", Kenneth Woods ‚Äì conductor, 21 May 2010 Richard Strauss, who was an admirer of Chabrier, conducted the first stage performance of the one act of Bris√©√Øs, and the critic Gerald Larner comments that Strauss was evidently influenced by the work when he came to compose his Salome eight years later. Chabrier and art Autour du piano, 1885, by Henri Fantin-Latour; Chabrier at the piano, and Vincent d'Indy standing, furthest right Chabrier was known for his continual contacts with contemporary artists, particularly painters of the Impressionist school. He left a rich collection of paintings by contemporary French painters; Edward Lockspeiser felt that \\"if ever it could be reassembled [the collection] would be rivalled, among collections of other composers, only by that of Chausson, which consisted largely of Delacroix\\".Lockspeiser, Edward.

Chabrier was also a collector of avant-garde writing; as well as Verlaine, among others he sought out the works of R√©gnier, Willette and Gill.Myers p.161 Notes, references and sources =Notes= =References= =Sources= Books * (Format = Year - Letter number - Note number)    * * Journals   External links   *Free scores at the Mutopia Project Category:1841 births Category:1894 deaths Category:19th- century classical composers Category:19th-century French composers Category:19th-century French people Category:19th-century male musicians Category:Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery Category:Chevaliers of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:French opera composers Category:French operetta composers Category:French Romantic composers Category:Lyc√©e Saint-Louis alumni Category:Male opera composers ","title":"Emmanuel Chabrier"},{"id":"901467","text":"Blue Magic can refer to: * Blue Magic (band), a R&B; and soul music vocal quintet ** Blue Magic (album) *\\"Blue Magic\\" (song), a song from rapper Jay-Z's album American Gangster *Blue Magic, a novel by A.

It can be produced in both manual and automatic versions. Engine and drive at the same end Transaxles are nearly universal in all automobile configurations that have the engine placed at the same end of the car as the driven wheels: the front-engine/front-wheel drive; rear- engine/rear-wheel drive; and mid-engine/rear-wheel drive arrangements. Many mid- and rear-engined vehicles use a transverse engine and transaxle, similar to a front-wheel drive unit. Others use a longitudinal engine and transaxle like Ferrari's 1989 Mondial t which used a \\"T\\" arrangement with a longitudinal engine connected to a transverse transaxle. Front-wheel drive versions of modern Audis, from the A4 upwards, along with their related marques from the Volkswagen Group (which share the same automobile layout) also use a similar layout, but with the transaxle also mounted longitudinally. The front-wheel drive Renault 16 had a longitudinal engine and transaxle, with the engine behind the transaxle. The transaxle case was designed to allow the final-drive ring gear to be on either side of the pinion; this allowed the engine- transaxle assembly to be used in the rear-wheel drive Lotus Europa, which had the engine in front of the transaxle (i.e., mid-engined). Front-engine, rear-wheel drive transaxles Front-engine, rear-wheel drive vehicles tend to have the transmission up front just after the engine, but sometimes a front engine drives a rear-mounted transaxle. This is generally done for reasons of weight distribution, and is therefore common on sports cars. Another advantage is that as the driveshaft spins at engine speed it only has to endure the torque of the engine, instead of that torque multiplied by the 1st gear ratio. This design was pioneered in the 1934 ≈†koda Popular, and then in the 1950 Lancia Aurelia, designed by Vittorio Jano. Since this placement of the gearbox is unsuitable for a live axle (due to excessive unsprung mass), the rear suspension is either independent, or uses a de Dion tube (notably in Alfa Romeos). Rare exceptions to this rule were the Bugatti T46 and T50 which had a three speed gearbox on a live axle. The Nissan GT-R and Ferrari FF (and its successors) are unusual in being all-wheel-drive cars with front-engined layouts and rear-mounted transaxles. In the Nissan, one driveshaft sends power to the transaxle (which also contains the 'center' differential) and another driveshaft sends power back along the car to the front wheels. In the Ferrari, the rear transaxle works in the conventional manner, whilst the drive to the front wheels comes from a separate gearbox at the front of the engine. Notable Front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout vehicles with a transaxle design include: Rear-engine, rear-wheel drive transaxles Volkswagen and later Porsche made extensive use of transaxles in their rear (and mid) engined vehicles. Over the years, models adopting this configuration have included: *1921‚Äì1925 Rumpler Tropfenwagen *1938‚Äì2003 Volkswagen Beetle *1940‚Äì1945 Volkswagen K√ºbelwagen (Type 82) *1941‚Äì1944 Volkswagen Schwimmwagen (Type 166) *1948‚Äì1965 Porsche 356 *1950‚Äì1990 Volkswagen Type 2 T1-T3 *1955‚Äì1974 Volkswagen Karmann Ghia *1960‚Äì1969 Chevrolet Corvair *1961‚Äì1973 Volkswagen Type 3 *1963‚Äì1976 Hillman Imp *1963‚Äìpresent Porsche 911 *1964‚Äì1969 ≈†koda 1000 MB *1965‚Äì1969, 1976 Porsche 912 *1967-1973 Lamborghini Miura *1968‚Äì1974 Volkswagen Type 4 *1969‚Äì1976 Porsche 914 (mid-engined) *1969‚Äì1980 ≈†koda 100, ≈†koda 110 R *1971-1978 Maserati Bora *1971-1992 De Tomaso Pantera *1975‚Äì1989 Porsche 930 *1976‚Äì1990 ≈†koda 105, ≈†koda 120, ≈†koda 130, ≈†koda Garde, ≈†koda Rapid (1984) *1981‚Äì1983 DeLorean *1984-1988 Pontiac Fiero (mid-engined) * *2013‚Äìpresent Praga R1 (mid-engined) Four-wheel drive All Audi cars with longitudinal engines and their 'trademark' quattro four-wheel drive (4WD) system, along with their related marques from the Volkswagen Group which share the same layout, utilise a transaxle. This is mounted immediately behind the front-mounted engine (again, longitudinally) and contains the 'gearbox' (manual, automatic, DSG, or CVT), along with both the centre differential, and the front differential and final drive unit. Other 4WD applications include: *1979-2002 Volkswagen Vanagon/Caravelle Syncro Edition - rear-engined, transaxle in the front; *1984‚Äì1986 Ford RS200 ‚Äì mid-engined, with the gearbox in the front; *1989-2001 Mitsubishi 3000GT - front-engined, gearbox (transmission, front and centre differential) in the front; *2007‚Äìon Nissan GT-R ‚Äì front-engined, gearbox in the rear.

(the enforcement arm of the National Crime Syndicate) during the 1930s. Maione was called \\"Happy\\" because his face displayed an eternal scowl. Early years As a young man, Maione led the Ocean Hill Hooligans, an Italian street gang in the Ocean Hill, Brooklyn section of New York. His prot√©g√© in this gang was Frank \\"The Dasher\\" Abbandando. Maione had a son, Albert Maione, who eventually became an associate with the Gambino crime family. Maione's older brother was Louis \\"The Duke\\" Maione. In 1931, Maione and Abbandando helped Abe \\"Kid Twist\\" Reles and Martin \\"Bugsy\\" Goldstein eliminate their gangster rivals, the Shapiro Brothers (Meyer, Irving, and William). Previously that year, the Shapiros had unsuccessfully tried to murder Reles and Goldstein. Meyer Shapiro then abducted Reles' girlfriend and raped her. Reles and Goldstein wanted revenge and the two wanted to take over the Shapiro operations. On July 11, 1931, Irving Shapiro was gunned down near his apartment. On September 17, 1931, Meyer was found shot to death in the basement of a tenement building on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Murder, Inc. Maione, Abbandando, Reles, and Goldstein then banded together. They were soon joined by Harry \\"Pittsburgh Phil\\" Strauss, Albert \\"Tick Tock\\" Tannenbaum, Seymour \\"Blue Jaw\\" Magoon, Louis Capone, Charles \\"The Bug\\" Workman and Vito \\"Chicken Head\\" Gurino. The gang started picking up murder contracts from the National Crime Syndicate with the help of Syndicate Board Member Joe Adonis. The gang soon became the official murder-for-hire squad of the Syndicate, and was dubbed \\"Murder, Inc.\\" by the press. Maione acted as the Italian liaison to the Jewish members of Murder, Inc.; Reles was his counterpart on the Jewish side. Murder, Inc. was directed by the brutal Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter (another member of the Syndicate board) and the nefarious Albert \\"The Executioner\\" Anastasia. Maione reportedly killed at least 12 men himself while working for Murder, Inc. Eliminating potential witnesses In the mid-1930s, New York District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey targeted Buchalter for prosecution. In response, Buchalter started eliminating all potential witnesses. Murder, Inc., rubbed out anyone that Buchalter even suspected of being an informant. Loan shark George \\"Whitey\\" Rudnick was one such victim; he was killed by Maione, Abbandando, and Strauss on May 11, 1937. In 1940, Reles became an informant for the State of New York. He then implicated Maione and Abbandando in the horrific slaying of Rudnick. According to Reles, the men supposedly killed Rudnick and started stuffing him back in their car. Suddenly, the \\"corpse\\" started coughing. To finish him off, Strauss stabbed Rudnick 63 times with an ice pick and Maione buried a meat cleaver in his skull. In May 1940, Maione was convicted of first degree murder, but the verdict was overturned on appeal. After a second trial, Maione was convicted again. This time, the conviction was not overturned by an appeals court. On February 19, 1942, Maione, along with Frank Abbandando, was executed in the electric chair at Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York.

Sam Elliott co- stars as a bouncer, the mentor, friend, and foil of Swayze's character. The cast also includes Kelly Lynch as Swayze's love interest and Ben Gazzara as the main antagonist. Plot James Dalton is a professional \\"cooler\\", a specialized bouncer, with a mysterious past who is enticed from his job at a club in New York City by Frank Tilghman to take over security at his club/bar, the Double Deuce, in Jasper, Missouri. Tilghman plans to invest substantial money into the club to enhance its image, and he needs a first-rate cooler to maintain stability. Arriving in Jasper, Dalton takes lodging at a local farm owned by Emmett. Handed control of all bar operations and hiring by Tilghman, Dalton attracts attention by having a quiet demeanor‚Äîcontrasting with the tough locals. Dalton's \\"real\\" car is a 1986 Mercedes 560SEC with New York license plates which he keeps hidden, instead wisely going about in a used 1965 Buick Riviera that is repeatedly vandalized by disgruntled bar patrons. Dalton is soon introduced to local business magnate Brad Wesley, who lives in a mansion across a river from Emmett. Wesley appears to have a stranglehold on the town; little happens without his knowledge and approval. In the course of cleaning up the violent nightclub, Dalton dismisses several unruly and corrupt employees, some of whom are connected with Wesley. After one particularly violent night where Dalton is forced to physically remove Wesley's henchmen, he suffers a knife wound. Going to the hospital for staples, he strikes up a friendship with Dr. Elizabeth \\"Doc\\" Clay, which develops into a romantic relationship. Wesley summons Dalton to his home in a seemingly innocent attempt to make peace, but has an ulterior motive: Wesley would like Dalton to work for him once he extorts Tilghman's club. He reveals knowledge of Dalton's past by mentioning an incident where Dalton killed a man in Memphis, Tennessee, then claimed self-defense at the trial. When Dalton declines, Wesley begins an assault on Dalton's friends, including interfering with liquor deliveries to the Double Deuce. Dalton's mentor, legendary but aging cooler Wade Garrett, arrives in town after a disconcerting phone call from Dalton and helps him defend a liquor shipment from Wesley's thugs. That evening, the auto parts store of local business owner Red Webster is destroyed by a fire after he refuses to give ground to Wesley's persistent extortion demands. Dalton, not wanting to exacerbate matters, allows Wesley and his men entrance to the club that night. However, Wesley deploys Jimmy, a violent ex- con and skilled martial artist, to start a brawl with the Double Deuce bouncers. After a brief skirmish with Dalton and Garrett, Wesley calls an end to the fight and leaves the club. The next day, car dealership owner Pete Stroudenmire becomes Wesley's next victim when he also refuses to pay. As a result, Wesley has one of his goons, Gary Ketchum, demolish the dealership and crush four station wagons in the showroom with his monster truck as Dalton and his friends look on with contempt. Wesley warns everyone not to forget that Jasper is his town. That night, Doc visits Dalton and attempts to persuade him to leave. However, their conversation is interrupted by a powerful explosion at Emmett's house next door. Dalton rescues Emmett from the blaze before his house is destroyed. He then witnesses Jimmy fleeing the scene and manages to intercept him. After a vicious fight, Jimmy points a revolver at Dalton, but Dalton kills him by ripping out his throat with his bare hand. The next morning, Dalton receives an ominous phone call from Wesley, who vows to have either Wade or Doc killed by the flip of a coin. After Wesley hangs up leaving the outcome unknown, a badly beaten Wade staggers into the Double Deuce. Believing Doc to be in danger, Dalton races to the hospital alone, but she refuses to leave with him, repulsed by his increasingly violent nature. Upon returning to the Double Deuce, Dalton finds Wade sprawled out on the bar with a knife lodged in his chest and a note reading, \\"It was tails.\\" In tears of rage, Dalton pulls the knife free and jumps into his car, determined to settle the score with Wesley. Driving his Mercedes, Dalton speeds recklessly toward Wesley's estate. The car draws gunfire from Wesley's henchmen, but when it crashes, they discover the car empty, and the knife that was used to kill Wade stuck in the accelerator. Using the distraction, Dalton sneaks onto the estate and dispatches each of Wesley's henchmen, eventually coming face-to-face with Wesley himself. Dalton gains the upper hand in their fight and prepares to finish Wesley in the same brutal manner as Jimmy, but decides against it. As Dalton releases him and walks away, Wesley seizes the opportunity to reach for a gun, but is promptly shot to death in succession by Red, Emmett, Pete, and finally Tilghman, who declares to Wesley, \\"This is our town, and don't you forget it.\\" The men stash the weapons away prior to the arrival of the sheriff, and proceed, along with a surviving henchman, to corroborate each other's innocence, with the implication that what happened in Wesley's mansion will remain a secret. The final scene shows Cody, an old friend of Dalton‚Äôs, and his band at the bar performing \\"When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky\\", while cutting to Dalton and Doc enjoying each other's company in a swimming hole, suggesting that they do get together and Dalton remains in town for good. Cast * John William Young as Tinker Production Filming started in April 1988 and took place in locations throughout California, primarily Newhall, Valencia, and Canyon Country. The filming of much of the \\"New Double Deuce\\" was done at the Cowboy/The Bandstand (which went by other names as well until it closed) located in Anaheim. The opening and monster truck scenes were filmed in Sanger, California. The Kings River runs between the two residences. The monster truck used was Bigfoot #7, which was originally built for the film. The scene cost $500,000 to film. Release The film premiered in New York and Los Angeles on May 19, 1989. =Home media= The film was originally released on VHS and then on DVD. In the United States Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer first released the film on DVD on February 4, 2003 with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and theatrical trailer as the sole extra feature. In 2006 a Deluxe Edition DVD was released with two audio commentaries including one with the director, two featurettes titled \\"On the Roadhouse\\" and \\"What Would Dalton Do?\\". Road House was first issued by MGM on Blu-ray disc on June 2, 2009. A second disc combines the same six special features ported from the Deluxe DVD. After being reissued numerous times in the U.S., in 2016 Shout! Factory released a 2-disc Blu-ray collectors edition with fourteen extra features with material ported over from the previous editions. New supplements include a ‚Äòmaking of‚Äô documentary with new interviews by Herrington, actors Kelly Lynch, John Doe, Kevin Tighe, Julie Michaels and Red West, a separate conversation with the director and featurette for the films music. Reception =Box office= Although the film had lackluster box office returns,https://www.yardbarker.com/entertainment/articles/road_house_30_years_later_zen_and_the_art_of_bouncing/s1_13132_29115518 it did quite well on home video. The film also found life on cable television. Over time, the movie garnered a significant cult following. =Critical response= Road House received negative reviews upon release. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 39% based on 44 reviews and has an average rating of 5.12/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Whether Road House is simply bad or so bad it's good depends largely on the audience's fondness for Swayze ‚Äì and tolerance for violently cheesy action.\\" Variety was critical of \\"a flat romantic attachment\\" between Dalton and Clay and wrote that its \\"vigilante justice, lawlessness and wanton violence feel ludicrous in a modern setting.\\" Other reviews are critical of Swayze's role as Dalton. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2¬Ω out of 4 stars and commented, \\"Road House exists right on the edge between the 'good-bad movie' and the merely bad. I hesitate to recommend it, because so much depends on the ironic vision of the viewer. This is not a good movie. But viewed in the right frame of mind, it is not a boring one, either.\\" When interviewed by Anthony Bourdain, Bill Murray lauded the film as unappreciated, with a complex plot and respect among actors in the film industry since its release. Kelly Lynch told The A.V. Club, \\"Every time Road House is on and he [Murray] or one of his idiot brothers are watching TV ‚Äì and they‚Äôre always watching TV ‚Äì one of them calls my husband and says (in a reasonable approximation of Carl Spackler from Caddyshack), 'Kelly's having sex with Patrick Swayze right now. They‚Äôre doing it. He's throwing her against the rocks.'\\" =Accolades= Road House was nominated for (but did not win) five Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Patrick Swayze), Worst Supporting Actor (Ben Gazzara), Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made. Soundtrack The soundtrack for Road House featured Canadian guitarist Jeff Healey, whose band was featured in the film as the house band for the Double Deuce. Cruzados were the band in the opening credits, contributing three songs to the film that never made the soundtrack. Patrick Swayze also wrote one song and sang two for the soundtrack. The film's score was composed by Michael Kamen.http://jeffhealey.com/album/road-house-soundtrack/ A limited edition 14-track score album part of the Special Collection was issued by Intrada Records in 2012. An expanded limited 31-track score was reissued for the films 30th anniversary by La-La Land Records in 2019. Legacy =Sequel= A sequel, Road House 2, was released directly to DVD in July 2006. Set many years later and telling the story of Dalton's adult son, it featured no one from the original cast and only a few references to Dalton (who was reportedly shot dead before the film took place). The sequel confirmed that Dalton's first name was James, which could be seen momentarily on the medical chart in the original film's hospital scene, but which had been otherwise unstated. At the same time Road House 2 was released, the original film was reissued in a deluxe edition featuring, among other features, separate audio commentary tracks by director Herrington, Kevin Smith, and Scott Mosier, which the duo had expressed an interest in during the introduction of the tenth anniversary Clerks DVD. =Musical= In 2003, an off-Broadway musical production of Road House was staged as a campy comedy by Timothy Haskell, as seen by its full title of Road House: The Stage Version Of The Cinema Classic That Starred Patrick Swayze, Except This One Stars Taimak From The 80's Cult Classic \\"The Last Dragon\\" Wearing A Blonde Mullet Wig. =Police training video= Following the death of Eric Garner, the New York City Police Department began using a scene from Road House as part of a mandatory, three-day retraining course for 22,000 officers expected to \\"be nice\\" under pressure. =Canceled remake= On September 9, 2015, it was announced that Ronda Rousey would star in a remake of Road House. On October 12, 2015, Nick Cassavetes was announced to write and direct the film. However, plans for the movie fell through and the movie was quietly canceled in 2016. =Comic book= Julia Gfr√∂rer, Sean T. Collins and Gretchen Felker-Martin made All Fucked-Up: Tales From the Roadhouse (2020), a mini comic with six erotic fan fiction comics based on the film.

The division was raised from volunteers for Lord Kitchener's New Armies, that was originally made up of infantry battalions raised by public subscription or private patronage. The division was taken over by the War Office in September 1915. It served in France and Belgium in the trenches of the Western Front for the duration of the war. Unit history The Division was one of the six created for the Fourth New Army on 10 December 1914. The division was originally made up of Pals battalions, and two brigades of the Northumberland Fusiliers; the Tyneside Scottish and Tyneside Irish. Major-General Edward Ingouville-Williams took command of the division in June 1915. It landed in France in January 1916. The division's first major action was the attack at La Boisselle on the first day of the Battle of the Somme during which the division suffered heavy casualties and many of the original Pals were killed. It went on to suffer further losses at the Battle of the Lys in April 1918.

Specifically, it is the land of the Buthera Balug clan who occupied the area when Europeans first settled the region in the early 1800s. In 1824, Hume and Hovell on their return from Port Phillip, camped by the Goulburn River not far upstream of Seymour. In 1836 Major Thomas Mitchell crossed the Goulburn at Mitchellstown and soon afterwards overlanders and other early settlers began to use this crossing place on the Melbourne‚ÄìSydney route (now known as the Hume Highway). The mail service between Melbourne and Sydney had been operating for just a year when it was found that a better route was available using the \\"New Crossing Place\\". The Robert Burns Inn was operating there by the end of 1839. In 1841 the Government decided that the new crossing place was the likely spot for a town. Plans were laid before the Executive Council of NSW and Mitchell proposed the name Seymour which was approved on 21 December 1843. The town was named after Lord Seymour, the son of the 11th Duke of Somerset. The Post Office opened on 1 July 1844. The railway arrived in 1872 along with substantial infrastructure to support it, establishing the town as an important rail hub for the Goulburn Valley, the Melbourne‚ÄìSydney railway and North Eastern Victoria. It was one of the first Victorian examples of the railway town phenomenon, in the heyday of the railway it employed 400 men and along with their families comprised one- third of the town, or 1500 people. Puckapunyal Army base The Australian Army first established a large training camp east of the township during the First World War. During the Second World War, the eastern camp diminished in importance and a substantially larger and more permanent military township was established to the west at Puckapunyal.Dennis et al. (eds.), The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, p. 435 Puckapunyal is the centre for the Australian Army's Land Warfare Development Centre (LWDC) and Headquarters Combined Arms Training Centre (HQ CATC), with three of the Army's five Schools located on site. Additionally, there are smaller training centres and facilities as well as the Road Transport Wing of the Army Logistic Training Centre's Army School of Transport based in Puckapunyal. The base is also home to the Royal Australian Armoured Corps Memorial and Army Tank Museum. Events and attractions Seymour position on the banks of the Goulburn River and base of the Tallarook Ranges offers breath-taking hiking/riding and bushwalking for all fitness levels and many open public parks including the Australian Lighthorse Memorial Park located on Yea Road and the National Trust listed Old Goulburn Bridge access via Emily Street. The Vietnam Veterans Commemorative Walk was opened in 2013, the only one of its kind in Australia dedicated to Vietnam Veterans. The Walk has been created using symbolic elements of Vietnam and over 60,000 names of every serviceman & servicewoman who served in the conflict are listed. The township is also home to The Seymour Railway Heritage Centre the heritage centre has a large collection of vintage and heritage locomotives, diesels and rolling stock (in various stages of restoration). The Seymour and District Historical Society Museum, is located in Tallarook Street in the Pioneer Library. Seymour Alternative Farming Expo February each year. Established in 1991, the Expo has grown into one of the most successful alternative farming expos in the Southern Hemisphere which draws many thousands of visitors from around Australia. The Seymour Agricultural Show, held on the first Saturday in October every year, first established in 1858 it is the display of rural industry, including livestock and produce with its associated competitions and awards, drawing large crowds from the state to compete each year. Tastes of the Goulburn food and wine festival is hosted in October each year, showcasing the best local produce from the Goulburn Valley and Central Victoria. This unique festival offers the option to travel by Steam rail from Melbourne Seymour Cup in October each year.

The Hume International Raceway is located West of the township and holds regular go- cart racing meetings on most weekends. On a lighter note Seymour is the second town mentioned in the original (Australian) version of the song \\"I've Been Everywhere\\". Wine Seymour is located at the southern end of the Goulburn Valley wine region. The main influencing factors in the Goulburn Valley wine region are the hills of the Great Dividing Range and the Goulburn River which mitigates lengthy and warm summers. Top varieties: Shiraz, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling and Marsanne Soil types: sandy clay loams, clay loams and gritty, gravelly quartzose sands There are several wineries in and near the township which include Wine x Sam, Tahbilk, Mitchelton Winery, Fowles Wines, Kensington Wines and several other boutique vineyards Box Grove vineyard, Brave Goose vineyard, Somerset Crossing vineyard, Vitto Oles Wines and Traawool Valley wines. Each year Tastes of the Goulburn food and wine festival is hosted in Seymour, showcasing the best local produce from the Goulburn Valley. Seymour also hosts the Victorian Wine Show.  Education  Seymour College is the government school, providing classes from Prep to Year 12. The college was created in 2010 through a merger of Seymour Technical High School (STHS), Seymour Primary School (SPS) Seymour East Primary School (SEPS) and Seymour Special School (SSS) located in Loco Street. St Mary's College is a Prep to Year 10 Catholic school located in High Street. The Seymour campus of the Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE, opened in 1998, provides a variety of short courses and vocational education and training. Transport Seymour Station viewed from the main street. Seymour is located adjacent to the junction of the Hume and Goulburn Valley Highway. The Hume Highway crossed the Goulburn River and diverted all Melbourne-Sydney bound traffic though the township for over 100 years until a freeway bypass was opened routing all non- local and interstate traffic around the township in 1982. Seymour station is served by regular V/Line hourly services to and from Melbourne Southern Cross station as well as services on the Albury and Shepparton lines. The station was once a major freight marshalling location and the home of a significant locomotive depot. Victoria's electronic ticketing system, Myki, was implemented on rail services between Seymour and Melbourne on 24 June 2013. Community Seymour is host to many community and service groups including Freemasonry (established in Seymour in 1883), Rotary, the Lions Club, Scouting, Apex Clubs of Australia and Probus.

Example of recent expressions of Bolivian irredentism over territorial losses in the War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì1884). In the mural it is written; \\"What once was ours, will be ours once again\\", and \\"Hold on rotos (Chileans), because here come the Colorados of Bolivia\\" Roto, f. rota, (literally \\"torn\\" or \\"broken\\") is a term used to refer to Chilean people and in particular to the common Chilean. In Chile from the start of the 20th century it was applied with a negative classist connotation to poor city-dwellers. It is also used contemptuously in other Spanish-speaking countries, especially Bolivia and Peru, to refer to Chileans in a derogatory manner. Otherwise, despite its defects, the roto is also considered a figure of national identity and pride in Chile. Historical usage The term roto has been used in Peru since the times of the Spanish conquest, when Diego de Almagro's disappointed troops returned to Cuzco (after a failed gold-seeking expedition in Chile) with their torn clothes, due to the extensive and laborious passage on foot through the Atacama desert. In the early days of Santiago its inhabitants were notoriously poorly dressed as result of a lack of food and supplies. Some Spanish came to dress with hides from dogs, cats, sea lions and foxes. This term became more used after the Chilean campaigns against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation in 1839 ‚ÄîChilean troops defeated the confederation at the Battle of Yungay on 20 January 1839. In Chile tributes were paid to the victors of Yungay and, in a gesture of recognition, 20 January was declared the D√≠a del Roto Chileno (in Spanish; Day of the Chilean Roto)‚Äî and the War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì84). The figure of the Chilean Roto is commemorated by very diverse organisations and actors such as the Chilean Army, ultra-nationalist activists, the Communist Party and local organisations of ordinary citizens. The Army has a particular appreciation to the figure which was regarded as the main hero ‚Äìa collective and anonymous hero- of some of the most crucial battles in the war against Bolivia and Peru.

In 1651 he fled to Kinmen (Quemoy), in 1663 Kinmen was taken by the invaders. The mainland Chinese city of Xiamen is within shelling distance of the small islands of Kinmen. As one of the front line islands between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China, ROC-governed Kinmen has seen many battles and tensions between the two throughout the Cold War. It was generally understood by both the ROC and the PRC that if Kinmen fell to the PRC, Taiwan itself would follow. The phrase \\"Quemoy and Matsu\\" became part of U.S. politics in the 1960 Presidential election. During the debates, both candidates, Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy pledged to use U.S. force if necessary to protect the Republic of China from invasion from the mainland, the People's Republic of China, which the U.S. did not recognize as a legitimate government at the time. Vice- President Nixon charged that Senator Kennedy would not use U.S. force to protect Taiwan's forward positions, Kinmen and Matsu. List of battles over Kinmen: *Battle of Guningtou (1949) *On July 26, 1950, ROC forces on Dadan Island (Tatan), in total 298 soldiers, repulsed an attack (Â§ßÊìîÂ≥∂Êà∞ÂΩπ) from a People's Liberation Army force of 700 soldiers that landed on the island. *First Taiwan Strait Crisis (1954-1955) *Second Taiwan Strait Crisis (1958) After the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis ended in stalemate, both sides settled upon a routine of bombarding each other every other day with shells containing propaganda leaflets. ROC troops on the island continued constructing tunnels, bunkers, and other underground facilities. Commandos (often known as Ê∞¥È¨º, or \\"water ghosts\\" by ROC troops) were sent by both sides to conduct sabotage or attack lone sentries. The bombardment finally ended in 1979 with the establishment of formal diplomatic ties between the United States and the PRC.

Thirty-eight of the fifty states later adopted provisions of Blaine in their state constitutions. The measures were designed to deny government aid to parochial schools, especially those operated by the Catholic Church in locations with large immigrant populations. The Blaine Amendment emerged from a growing consensus among 19th-century U.S. Protestants that public education must be free from ‚Äúsectarian‚Äù or ‚Äúdenominational‚Äù control, while it also reflected nativist tendencies hostile to immigrants. The amendments are generally seen as explicitly anti-Catholic because when they were enacted public schools typically included Protestant prayer, and taught from Protestant bibles, although debates about public funding of sectarian schools predate any significant Catholic immigration to the U.S.Steven K. Green, \\"Blaming Blaine: Understanding the Blaine Amendment and the No-Funding Principle, 2 First Amend. L. Rev. 107, (2003) Thus, at the time of the Blaine amendments, public schools were not non-sectarian or non- denominational in the modern sense; nor were they completely secular. Proposed federal amendment President Ulysses S. Grant (1869‚Äì77) in a speech in 1875 to a veteran's meeting, called for a Constitutional amendment that would mandate free public schools and prohibit the use of public money for sectarian schools. He was echoing nativist sentiments that were strong in his Republican Party.Tyler Anbinder says, \\"Grant was not an obsessive nativist. He expressed his resentment of immigrants and animus toward Catholicism only rarely. But these sentiments reveal themselves frequently enough in his writings and major actions as general ... In the 1850s he joined a Know Nothing lodge and irrationally blamed immigrants for setbacks in his career.\\" Anbinder, ‚ÄúUlysses S. Grant, Nativist,‚Äù Civil War History 43 (June 1997): 119‚Äì41. online Grant laid out his agenda for \\"good common school education.\\" He attacked government support for \\"sectarian schools\\" run by religious organizations, and called for the defense of public education \\"unmixed with sectarian, pagan or atheistical dogmas.\\" Grant declared that \\"Church and State\\" should be \\"forever separate.\\" Religion, he said, should be left to families, churches, and private schools devoid of public funds.Deforrest (2003) After Grant's speech Republican Congressman James G. Blaine proposed the amendment to the federal Constitution. Blaine, who actively sought Catholic votes when he ran for president in 1884, believed that possibility of hurtful agitation on the school question should be ended. In 1875, the proposed amendment passed by a vote of 180 to 7 in the House of Representatives, but failed by four votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote in the United States Senate. It never became federal law. The proposed text was: Amendments to state constitutions Supporters of the proposal then turned their attention to state legislatures, where their efforts met with far greater success. Eventually, all but 10 states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and West Virginia) passed laws that meet the general criteria for designation as \\"Blaine amendments,\\" in that they ban the use of public funds to support sectarian private schools. Jonathan A. Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, explained in 2017 the purpose of the state constituinal Blaine amendments: ‚ÄúThese constitutional provisions serve significant government interests ‚Äî leaving the support of churches to church members, while also protecting houses of worship against discrimination and interference from the government.‚Äù In some states the provisions in question were included in newly drafted constitutions, rather than adopted as amendments to an existing constitution. The state Blaine amendments remained in effect in thirty seven states until June 2020. In 2012, 56% of voters rejected a measure repealing Florida's Blaine amendment. A 60% favorable margin was required for adoption. Voters have also rejected proposals to repeal their state-level Blaine amendments in New York (1967), Michigan (1970), Oregon (1972), Washington state (1975), Alaska (1976), Massachusetts (1986), and Oklahoma (2016). On April 1, 1974, voters in Louisiana approved a new constitution by a margin of 58 to 42 percent, which repealed the Blaine amendment that was part of that state's 1921 constitution.Art.4, Sec. 8, Constitution of Louisiana, 1921: \\"No money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect or denomination of religion, or in aid of any priest, preacher, minister or teacher thereof, as such, and no preference shall ever be given, nor any discrimination made against, any church, sect or creed of religion, or any form of religious faith or worship.\\" Louisiana's current 1974 constitution replaced it with a copy of the federal First Amendment's no-establishment and free exercise clauses, in Article 1, Sec. 8 of its Declaration of Rights; in Article 8, Sec. 13(a), it also guarantees the provision of free textbooks and \\"materials of instruction\\" to all children attending elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana.https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Louisiana_State__Constitution_(1974). Two other states, South Carolina and Utah, have also watered down their \\"no- aid to religion\\" constitutional clauses by removing from them the word \\"indirect,\\" leaving only a prohibition of direct aid or assistance to religious schools in these states.Article 11, Sec. 4 of the South Carolina Constitution states, \\"No money shall be paid from public funds nor shall the credit of the State or any of its political subdivisions be used for the direct benefit of any religious or other private educational institution.\\" And Utah's constitution says, according to Article 10, Sec. 8, \\"Neither the state of Utah nor its political subdivisions may make any appropriation for the direct support of any school or educational institution controlled by any religious organization.\\" Regina Reaves Hayden, annotated by Steven K. Green, Esq. Stars in the Constitutional Constellation: Federal and State Constitutional Provisions on Church and State. Silver Spring, MD: Americans United Research Foundation, 1993, p. 109, 122. On June 30, 2020 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue that Montana's no-aid provision in its constitution, a Blaine amendment, had been inappropriately used to block tax-credit scholarship funds for private schooling for being used at a religious school in violation of the Free Exercise Clause. The ruling effective stated that if the state offered public scholarship funds for a private school, they could not discriminate against religious schools. As a result, it is expected that states that have similar programs with no-aid provisions in their constitutions will be forced to re- evaluate any program restrictions.

Career Trained by her coach Shannon Rollason at the Chandler Sports Complex along with her good friend Jodie Henry, Tait was selected to make her international debut at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, at the age of 16, where she collected a gold in the 4 √ó 100 m freestyle relay, as well as competing in the finals of the 50 m freestyle and 200 m individual medley. She repeated this at the 2002 Pan Pacific Championships in Yokohama, Japan. 2003 saw a big improvement in Tait's performance on the international swimming stage, when she received two silver medals at the 2003 World Swimming Championships in Barcelona, Spain in the 200 m individual medley and 50 m freestyle, breaking the Commonwealth record in the former and the Australian record in the latter. She also collected a silver and bronze in the 4 √ó 200 m and 4 √ó 100 m freestyle relays respectively. 2004 was a somewhat mixed year for Tait. She was beaten into 3rd place at the Australian trials in both the 50 m and 100 m freestyle, meaning that she was forced to watch these events from the stands. However, along with teammates Libby Lenton, Petria Thomas, and Jodie Henry, she won gold with a world record time in the women's 4 √ó 100 meter relay; 3min 35.94s. Later, she performed much slower than her previous best in the 200 m individual medley, being eliminated in the final. She admitted that she had been distracted by the earlier relay triumph. She also picked up a gold by swimming in the heats for the victorious 4 √ó 100 m medley relay team. Tait started 2005 by relocating to the Australian Institute of Sport along with Rollason and Henry. She started the year strongly, winning the 50 m and 100 m freestyle at the Australian championships, both in new personal best times, the former in Commonwealth record time. She also qualified in the 50 m butterfly in second place, and came third in the 100 m butterfly( but was not selected as each country is restricted to two entries, despite being ranked third in the world), all in new personal best times. However, she had a form slump at the 2005 World Swimming Championships in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, swimming much slower than at the selection trials, and missing the medals. She collected a gold medal as part of the 4 √ó 100 m freestyle relay team. In 2006, Tait qualified and competed at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. She won bronze in the 50 m and 100 m freestyle behind Libby Lenton and Jodie Henry and in the 50 m butterfly behind Danni Miatke and Jessicah Schipper. She combined with Henry, Lenton and Shayne Reese to claim gold in the 4 √ó 100 m freestyle relay. In late 2006, Tait missed selection for the 2007 World Aquatics Championships. She was part of the bronze medal-winning Australian team in the 4 √ó 100 m freestyle relay at the 2008 Summer Olympics. On 26 January 2005, Tait was awarded the Medal of Order of Australia for \\"service to sport as a Gold Medallist at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games\\".

She was born in Lismore, New South Wales, and grew up in the nearby town of Mullumbimby. Career In 1993, at the age of 17, Thomas won a bronze medal in the 200-metre butterfly at the World Short Course Championships. She followed this with two gold medals, in the 100-metre butterfly and 4√ó100-metre freestyle in the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada. However, she then struggled for two years, until making a comeback at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta in 1996. She won a silver medal, finishing second to fellow Australian Susie O'Neill. Despite being plagued by a shoulder injury, Thomas repeated her 1994 Commonwealth Games effort at the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur. She also won a bronze in the 100-metre butterfly and a silver in the 200-metre at the World Championships in Perth, the same year. She had similar success at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney in 2000, winning three medals - bronze in the 200-metre butterfly, silver in the 4√ó100-metre medley, and silver in the 4√ó200-metre freestyle. Thomas had always struggled to surpass O'Neill, despite being talented in her own right. However, after the 2000 games, O'Neill retired, and Thomas, despite battling recurring injuries, decided to continue. The decision paid off when she won three gold medals at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. She won both the 100-metre and 200-metre butterfly, and then was part of the winning 4√ó100-metre medley relay team. She was also part of the 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay team, which completed the race first, but they were disqualified when Thomas jumped in the pool to celebrate before the other competitors had completed the race. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games, Thomas won five gold, one silver and one bronze medals. While being one of the pinnacles of her career, her victory also made her the first female swimmer ever to win the same event at three consecutive Commonwealth Games - the 100-metre butterfly. She followed this with three gold and two silver medals at the 2002 Pan Pacific Championships in Yokohama, Japan. At the short-course championships in Moscow, Russia, Thomas won another gold medal in her pet event, the 200-metre butterfly. However, injuries forced her out of competition soon afterwards, and she had to spend much of 2003 recovering from yet another shoulder reconstruction. In 2004, Thomas made another comeback at the Olympic selection trials in Sydney while training with the Ginninderra Swimming Club. She broke the Commonwealth records in the 50-metre and 100-metre butterfly, set new personal best times in the 100-metre freestyle, 200-metre freestyle and narrowly missed the world record in the 200-metre butterfly. After having missed out on first place in 1996 and 2000, Thomas finally achieved gold at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. She won the individual 100-metre butterfly, and was a part of two world record-setting teams in the 4√ó100-metre freestyle and 4√ó100-metre medley relays. She was subsequently chosen to carry the Australian flag at the closing ceremony. Thomas announced her retirement from competitive swimming at the conclusion of the games. In mid-2005, Thomas released an autobiography, Swimming Against The Tide, in which she describes her career, including her experiences with depression and injuries. Thomas was inducted into the Australian Institute of Sport Swimming Hall of Fame in 1996, and was crowned the AIS Athlete of the Year in 2001 (with gymnast Philippe Rizzo) and 2002 and in 2006 inducted in the AIS 'Best of the Best'. She was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2007. She currently resides in Amaroo, Canberra, with her husband, Julian Jones, the head strength and conditioning coach at the AIS. They have two children.

Early life and career Henry was born in Brisbane, Queensland. She began swimming competitively at the relatively late age of 14. She swam in the Commonwealth Youth Games in Edinburgh, Scotland, later that year, winning five gold medals. Swimming career At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Henry won the women's 100 metre freestyle as well as being a member of the Australian teams that won both the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay and the 4√ó100-metre medley relay. Later that year, she won silver at the Pan Pacific Championships in the 50- and 100-metre freestyle, and helped Australian teams to victory over the Americans in the freestyle and medley relays. In 2003, Henry won the 100-metre silver medal, and picked up bronze medals in both the 4√ó100-metre freestyle and 4√ó100-metre medley relays at the FINA World Championships in Barcelona. She was also named the Speedo female sprinter of the year for 2003. =2004 Summer Olympics= At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Henry anchored the Australian women's 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay team that won the gold in world record time. She then competed in the individual 100-metre freestyle, breaking the previous world record time of 53.66 seconds (set by team member Libby Lenton) with a time of 53.52 seconds in the semifinals. She then went on to win the gold medal for the event, the first Australian to do so since Dawn Fraser 40 years earlier. In her final race at Athens she swam the last leg (freestyle) of the 4√ó100-metre medley relay, again helping the Australian team win gold in world record time, leaving her with three gold medals and three world records. * women's 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay ** 1st- Australia (Alice Mills, Libby Lenton, Petria Thomas, Jodie Henry) 3:35.94 - world record * women's 100-metre freestyle ** Semi-final 2: 1st - 53.52 - world record ** Final: 1st - 53.84 * women's 4√ó100-metre medley relay ** 1st - Australia (Giaan Rooney, Leisel Jones, Petria Thomas, Jodie Henry) 3:57.32 - world record Henry was awarded the Order of Australia Medal that year. On 29 November 2004, Henry was named the Australian Swimmer of the Year, becoming just the third woman in 15 years to take the honour, joining Susie O'Neill and Hayley Lewis. Henry also snapped Ian Thorpe's five-year streak of receiving the award. She narrowly defeated teammate Petria Thomas to take the honour. Henry was also named Female Sprint Freestyler and her win with Thomas, Giaan Rooney, and Leisel Jones in the 4√ó100-metre medley relay in Athens was named the Golden Moment of the Year.http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,11540343%5E3102,00.html After the 2004 Olympics she followed her coach Shannon Rollason to the Australian Institute of Sport. =2005 onwards= Henry won the 100-metre freestyle gold medal at the 2005 World Championships in Montreal, clocking 54.18 seconds. That win came on top of her leadoff role in Australia's victorious 4√ó100-metre freestyle team and second relay gold as a heat swimmer in the 4√ó100-metre medley. She is a friend and was a training partner of Alice Mills under Shannon Rollason, until after nine years, she announced that she would be switching to the tutelage of John Fowlie. Lenton broke Henry's world record at the Commonwealth Games selection trials, setting a new mark of 53.42 seconds. Henry finished with the silver medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, finishing behind compatriot Lenton (24.61) in the 50-metre and (53.54) 100-metre freestyle, clocking 53.78 seconds and a personal best in the 50-metre with 24.72 seconds for another silver behind Lenton. Henry swam in the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay, helping Australia to the gold medal. On 25 March, at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne, Henry claimed gold again. Combining with Shayne Reese, rookie Melanie Schlanger and Libby Lenton, Henry anchored the Australian 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay team in a world championship record time of 3:35.48 seconds, ahead of the United States in 3:35.68 and the Netherlands in 3:36.81. She also won another gold medal in the 4√ó100-metre medley relay. In November 2007, Henry returned to her hometown of Brisbane to regain form under new coach Drew McGregor and training at Chandler Swim Club. She was unable to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics because of a pelvic complaint. On 30 September 2009, she announced her retirement from swimming. Personal life She married Tim Notting, and they have three children.

It is a spoof of movies concerning idealistic teachers being confronted with a class of cynical teenagers, disengaged by conventional schooling, and loosely parodies High School Confidential, The Principal, Dangerous Minds, Lean on Me, The Substitute, Stand and Deliver, and Grease. The film is dedicated to the memories of casting director Elisabeth Leustig and actor Lexie Bigham, both of whom were killed in automobile accidents shortly after filming was completed. Plot Richard Clark (Jon Lovitz) is an unsatisfied prep school teacher at the fictional Wellington Academy, who accepts a job at inner city Marion Barry High School, much to the chagrin of his boss and father, Wellington headmaster Thaddeus Clark (John Neville). Richard arrives to find the school in a state of disarray and disorder, while meeting several students and faculty members, including jaded, sour principal Evelyn Doyle (Louise Fletcher), her cheerful assistant Victoria Chappell (Tia Carrere) and student Griff McReynolds (Mekhi Phifer). Despite initial opposition to his teaching style and harassment from the school gang leader Paco (Guillermo D√≠az), Richard begins connecting with his students and teaches them effectively, while developing a romantic relationship with Victoria. Barry High eventually is transformed into a fine educational establishment. Frustrated, Paco and his gang tamper with the school's final exam scores, causing everyone to fail. Griff, who grew to see Richard as a mentor, loses faith in him, as does the rest of the school and Richard is fired. Griff subsequently joins Paco's gang to make extra money. Victoria learns through word of mouth that Paco was behind the failing test scores and rushes to inform Richard, who decides to confront Paco and rescue Griff with the help of several of his students, including Anferny Jefferson (Brian Hooks), Natalie Thompson (Malinda Williams) and Julie Rubels (Natasha Gregson Wagner). By deceiving Mr. DeMarco (Marco Rodr√≠guez), a local gangster, Richard and Victoria reach Paco and the local crime boss, \\"Mr. A\\", whom they find has been Principal Doyle the entire time. Griff is told the truth about the test scores and after a brief fight, Paco, Doyle and DeMarco are arrested. Richard (now principal of Barry High) presides over the graduation ceremony and proudly names Griff as the class valedictorian. The six main students of the film graduate (but only those six). Richard makes good on his promise to send Griff to college and is in a relationship with Victoria.

He was heavily involved in the social movement of the 1850s that produced the land grant universities that pioneered public higher education in the United States. Turner was especially involved in establishing the University of Illinois. Biography Turner was a student of classical literature at Yale University and an aspiring missionary who, upon graduating in 1833, set out to the wilds of Illinois. In 1833, Turner became a professor at the newly organized Illinois College at Jacksonville, Illinois, where Turner encountered Pottawatomie Indians, and witnessed terrible outbreaks of cholera. At Jacksonville, Turner soon found himself involved in the question of slavery, becoming the editor of a Jacksonville abolitionist paper, an assistant with the Underground Railroad, and, in the classroom, a vocal opponent of slavery. =Agricultural Research= While a professor at Illinois College, Turner began to search for a plant that might serve as a hedge to help divide and cultivate expanses of open prairie. In the later 1830s Turner selected the Maclura pomifera (the Osage orange) as an ideal plant for this purpose, and patented a machine for preparing the soil and planting these seeds. Turner advertised and sold Osage Orange seeds, which were widely used as hedges before the development of barbed wire between 1867 and 1874. =Educational Activism= His religious views were the subject of an investigation by the Illinois Presbyterian Synod, and his abolitionism a subject of growing controversy, Turner in 1848 resigned from his teaching post as chair of belles lettres and literature at Illinois College. After his departure, Turner expanded his agricultural research and created the Illinois Industrial League to advocate for a publicly funded system to provide \\"industrial\\" education, suited for the needs of the working (\\"industrial\\") classes. Jonathan Turner in the Prairie Farmer newspaper Turner faced stiff opposition from traditional colleges, as well as from those opposed to non-sectarian education. In 1853, his farm was burned to the ground. But Turner (who was deeply religious, although not orthodox) pressed hard, and generated considerable enthusiasm for his model of education. In 1862, the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act was passed, which, after the American Civil War, brought Turner's ideas to fruition in the public Land Grant Universities of the United States. The precise importance of Turner's contribution to the establishment of the land grant university has been the subject of some dispute. Vermont Senator Justin Morrill was reluctant to credit Turner as the primary author of the movement, and some have argued that Morrill's contribution, as sponsoring senator, was more important. Turner was displeased with the political process that saw the University of Illinois (or \\"Illinois Industrial University,\\" as it was originally named) located in Urbana, Illinois, far from the industrial workers of Chicago. Turner spoke at the laying of the University's cornerstone, and his words: \\"Industrial education prepares the way for a millennium of labor.\\" remain in stone above the University's main quadrangle. =Later Years= In his later years, Turner devoted his energy to other causes. He became a strident opponent of corporations, and an advocate of the rights of mentally ill people, who suffered under terrible conditions in the asylums of the nineteenth-century. He also wrote religious tracts championing the liberal teachings of Christ, and criticizing Catholicism, Mormonism, and traditional religious institutions generally. Death and Honors Turner died at the age of 93, and is buried in Diamond Grove Cemetery in Jacksonville, Illinois. Jonathan Baldwin Turner Hall at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, Turner Hall at Illinois College, and Jonathan Turner Junior High School in Jacksonville are named in Turner's honor. Turner's papers are held by the Illinois History and Lincoln Collections of the University of Illinois Library at Urbana-Champaign.

Its wingspan is approximately 12 cm, and its dorsal forewings and hindwings are a bright, iridescent blue edged with black, while the ventral surfaces are brown. Its iridescent wings are an area of interest in research because of its unique microstructure. Due to its characteristic blue color, Morpho menelaus is considered valuable among collectors and was widely hunted in the 20th century. However, deforestation remains the main threat to the survival of this species. Range This neotropical butterfly is found in Central and South America, including the Cerrado which is a vast tropical savanna in Brazil. Other locations include Mexico and Venezuela. Ancestors of the Morpho menelaus butterfly may have been distributed in the Andean region.  Phylogeny  There is great variation among the various species of Morpho. Two groups of Morpho butterflies, achilles and hecuba, are distinct in flight behavior and vertical forest distribution. This habitat stratification between the two forest levels may have led to the diversification of the Morpho butterflies. Flight pattern behavior may also have led to changes in the wing shape to make it more suitable for gliding or flapping. Phylogenetic studies suggest these are indicative of ancestral qualities. Morpho menelaus is part of the achilles subclade of Morpho. Within this species, there are no differences between males and females regarding forewing length, aspect ratio and wing centroid measurement which may be indicative of morphological homogeneity. Despite the popularity of the genus Morpho, there is not a general consensus on the number of species or on how these species are defined. For instance, some consider M. amanthonte a subspecies of Morpho melanus, but this is not supported by morphology. Some older studies have identified 75 Morpho species, and newer studies recognize about 30 species. Despite the many species of the Morpho butterfly displayed in collections, they usually have mismatched or missing abdomens which make it difficult for research. Using combined studies of parsimony and Bayesian analyses, Morpho melanus is associated with the M. helenor, M. sulkowskyi and M. amonthonte clades. The split of Morpho melanus from M. amonthonte is estimated to fall under the Pliocene era. = Related Species = * M. achilles * M. achillaena * M. peleides * M. granadensis * M. deidamia * M. laertes * M. polyphemus * M. catenarius * M. amothonte * M. didius * M. godartii.  Behavior  Two views (dorsal and ventral) of the same specimenFemales inhabit the forest understory and perch on tree stumps, but are found near the tree tops when it is time to lay eggs. Both sexes have a slow and floppy flight pattern and feed on rotting fruit that has dropped to the ground. Males tend to fly in open clearings or high in the canopy. These butterflies collectively emerge in the beginning and the end of the wet season in Cerrado. They do not appear in the middle of the wet season because the heavy rain can cause physical harm to their wings. Their emergence depends on the availability of food which is dependent on climate. For protection from the rain, Morpho menelaus prefers small and enclosed spaces.  Life Cycle  Caterpillar = Egg = These butterflies lay their eggs one by one on the underside of host plants. The eggs are very small, are pale green in color and shaped like dew drops. The eggs are laid so that the caterpillars may feed as soon as they hatch. = Caterpillars = These social caterpillars feed on Erythroxylum, Dalbergia, and Fabaceae, and may prefer to feed on new leaves of host plants since these new leaves are easier and more nutritious to eat. The caterpillars are red brown in color with bright green spots. They are covered with bristles that release an irritant upon contact. Conversely, the peak of the caterpillar is in the dry season, a climate that is unsuitable for most animal communities. These caterpillars will enter diapause or suspend development and can delay pupation in order to survive this harsh period and the lack of water. As the dry season continues, the caterpillar population declines due to predation. = Adult = One of the best predictors of adult butterfly occurrence is the observation of species in captivity interact with ripe fruit. Adult emergence occurs primarily in the beginning of the wet season, when the climate and air humidity makes food resources plentiful and oviposition advantageous. The butterfly spends 3 to 4 weeks as an adult, and the entire life cycle is about 115 days. Adults fly along rivers, or anywhere that open land has been revealed.  Adaptations  Eyespots on wings are visual anti-predatory adaptations that have evolved in many species within Lepidoptera. The eyespots are usually dark circles surrounded by a brighter outer layer. The ‚Äòpupil‚Äô of the eye has a sparkle that mimics the natural reflection of the cornea. These eyes are thought to deflect a predator‚Äôs attack away from more vital organs and toward that spot on the wings. Bigger eyespots have also been shown to deter predators from attacking completely. M. menelaus specifically has an eyespot that is 6.8 mm in diameter on its ventral wings that it uses to help avoid predation.  Wing Structure  The wings of Morpho menelaus are a prime example of iridescent blue coloration in the insect world. The bright and iridescent colors of other butterflies are typically caused by optical interference, but the iridescent blue color of butterflies in the family Morphidae results from the microstructures of the wings. Scientists use SEM, scanning electronic microscope, and spectroscopy, to understand the wings in greater detail. = Structural components = Each wing is covered in multi-layered scales, which are responsible for the coloration of the wings. The wing colors vary with viewing angle, a phenomenon referred to as structural color. In the female, the dorsal side is more camouflaged while the male presents with a vibrant blue. In the male, the outer layer of the cover scales are long and narrow (250 um x 50 um), 2 um apart, and parallel to the wing plane. The dimensions of the cover scales in other species of the subfamily Morphinae vary greatly, but all are pigment- less and lowly iridescent. The inner layer, called ground scales, are pigmented, iridescent, do not overlap, and are responsible for the blue coloration. They consist of alternating layers of chitin and air, each having its own refractive indexes. The wings of the genus Morpho are noteworthy for their diversity of function, including being hydrophobic, lightweight, sturdy, thermally regulated, and bright blue iridescent. These unique characteristics originate from the photonic nanostructures in the ridges of the scales. There has been increasing interest in the bioengineering community into understanding the structural components of the wing which can have potential applications in creating structural-color devices and selective gas-sensors. Upperside (female) = Iridescence = Iridescence is the phenomenon when light interacts with a particular surface, and at differing angles of illumination and observation the color begins to gradually change. The Morpho Menelaus' characteristic iridescent wings has a unique wing structure. The ground scales are covered by a set of longitudinal ridges, and within the ridges are layers of lamella. Because the size of the microstructure is the same as the wavelength of light, the layers in the wings react strongly with visible light. The ground and cover scales have an observable ‚ÄúChristmas-tree‚Äù structure which is responsible for the diffraction or bending of light pattern of the wings which results in the characteristic iridescence blue color. Within the ground scales are layers of lamella. The upper lamina is closely marked with longitudinal ridges. The ridges themselves consist of individual lamellae (6-12) which overlap like shingles on a roof. The inter-spacings of the lamella layers is around 80 nm, but there are variations in the thickness of each lamella. A network of netted trabeculae separates neighboring lamellae. = Hydrophobic surface = A superhydrophobic surface is when water is dropped, a spherical ball forms and rolls off the surface. Any dirt or dust that is on the surface will be removed along with the water drop forming. The wings of Morpho menelaus have attracted potential research interest because of its self-cleaning property. The microstructure of the wing plays an important role in this unique feature. It is one of the few butterflies that will fly in the rain.  Collections  Morpho menelaus is unique because of its iridescent blue color and large wingspan. They are one of the most familiar and recognizable neotropical insects. Over the past century, there has been an accumulation of these butterflies in both private and museum collections, and are considered highly valuable among collectors, artists, and designers for their beautiful coloration and are widely hunted or bred for decorative purposes. Because of the popularity of collecting and rearing Morpho species for sale, there is a wide discrepancy in its taxonomic understanding among collectors.

This approach has been used successfully for (interactive) automated theorem proving. The first logical framework was Automath; however, the name of the idea comes from the more widely known Edinburgh Logical Framework, LF. Several more recent proof tools like Isabelle are based on this idea. Unlike a direct embedding, the logical framework approach allows many logics to be embedded in the same type system. Overview A logical framework is based on a general treatment of syntax, rules and proofs by means of a dependently typed lambda calculus. Syntax is treated in a style similar to, but more general than Per Martin-L√∂f's system of arities. To describe a logical framework, one must provide the following: # A characterization of the class of object-logics to be represented; # An appropriate meta-language; # A characterization of the mechanism by which object-logics are represented. This is summarized by: :\\"Framework = Language + Representation.\\" LF In the case of the LF logical framework, the meta- language is the ŒªŒ†-calculus. This is a system of first-order dependent function types which are related by the propositions as types principle to first-order minimal logic. The key features of the ŒªŒ†-calculus are that it consists of entities of three levels: objects, types and kinds (or type classes, or families of types). It is predicative, all well-typed terms are strongly normalizing and Church-Rosser and the property of being well-typed is decidable. However, type inference is undecidable. A logic is represented in the LF logical framework by the judgements-as-types representation mechanism. This is inspired by Per Martin-L√∂f's development of Kant's notion of judgement, in the 1983 Siena Lectures. The two higher-order judgements, the hypothetical J\\\\vdash K and the general, \\\\Lambda x\\\\in J. K(x), correspond to the ordinary and dependent function space, respectively. The methodology of judgements-as-types is that judgements are represented as the types of their proofs. A logical system {\\\\mathcal L} is represented by its signature which assigns kinds and types to a finite set of constants that represents its syntax, its judgements and its rule schemes. An object-logic's rules and proofs are seen as primitive proofs of hypothetico-general judgements \\\\Lambda x\\\\in C. J(x)\\\\vdash K.

Niel Gow (1727‚Äì1807) was the most famous Scottish fiddler of the eighteenth century. Biography Gow was born in Strathbraan, Perthshire, in 1727, as the son of John Gow and Catherine McEwan. The family moved to Inver in Perthshire when Niel was an infant. He started playing the fiddle when very young and at age 13 received his first formal lessons from one John Cameron. In spite of being something of a musical prodigy, he originally trained as a weaver, but eventually gave up that trade to become a full-time musician. He was widely considered the best fiddle player in Perthshire, an area which was renowned for its musicians‚Äîthe story goes that at age 18 he entered a competition that was being judged by John McCraw, a blind musician, who awarded him the first prize and then went on to claim that he \\"would ken his bow hand among a hunder[d] players\\" (detect Niel's style among a hundred players). This attracted the attention of the Duke of Atholl, who became Niel's patron, and also ensured Niel's employment for balls and dance parties put on by the local nobility. In time he became renowned as a fiddler. Niel Gow was married twice. His first wife was Margaret Wiseman, and they had five sons and three daughters. His sons William, Andrew (1760), Nathaniel (1763), and John (1764) all followed their father as fiddlers and composers of fiddle music; two of the daughters were Margaret (1759) and Grizel (1761). The youngest son, Daniel (1765), died in infancy; William died in 1791 at age 40, and Andrew died in 1794 at 34. Of Niel's sons, Nathaniel is by far the most well-known and another fine composer of Scottish music, with nearly two hundred tunes to his credit. As a widower, Niel married Margaret Urquhart from Perth in 1768, and they went on to share a happy marriage until she died in 1805, which prompted his composition of one of his most famous tunes: \\"Niel Gow's Lament for the Death of his Second Wife\\". Niel died at Inver on 1 March 1807, aged 80. According to John Glen (1895), Niel Gow composed, or is credited with composing eighty-seven dance tunes, \\"some of which are excellent.\\" These tunes form the backstay of Scottish country dance music even today. However, it must be said that he was not above claiming good material from other composers as his own; Glen claims that at least a quarter of the eighty-seven tunes are either derived from older tunes or are copies of tunes published earlier elsewhere, often under a different title. The Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen indicates that Gow's air of Locherroch Side was the basis for Robert Burns' ballad, \\"Oh! stay, sweet warbling Woodlark, stay.\\"\\"Gow, Niel\\". Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen Volume 2. Glasgow: Blackie & Sons, 1875. p153. Accessed on 2013/08/20. This \\"borrowing\\" was a common practice at the time and it did not seem to hurt his reputation; Henry Raeburn was commissioned to paint him several times. Many of Niel Gow's compositions are still played today at ceilidhs and country dances. He himself spelled his name Niel, although others sometimes spell it Neil or even Neal. The National Records of Scotland attest that Gow himself used the name 'Neil'. To add to the confusion he had a musical grandson (by Nathaniel) who did spell his name \\"Neil\\". The annual Niel Gow Fiddle Festival takes place in Dunkeld and Birnam, Perthshire, Scotland. It was established in 2004 to celebrate the life and music of Gow. It is envisaged that through time the festival and other activities will gather enough funds to erect a fitting memorial to him in Dunkeld and Birnam. The 2020 festival was planned to take place from the 20 to 22 March. It is hoped that the memorial to Niel Gow, sculpted by David Annand will be erected during 2020.

A second part, Assorted Opinions and Maxims (), was published in 1879, and a third part, The Wanderer and his Shadow (), followed in 1880.Nietzsche, Friedrich. [1878] 1908. Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, translated by A. Harvey. Chicago: Charles H. Kerr & Co. . . HathiTrust: 001386232. Retrieved 20 August 2020. The book is Nietzsche's first in the aphoristic style that would come to dominate his writings, discussing a variety of concepts in short paragraphs or sayings. Reflecting an admiration of Voltaire as a free thinker, but also a break in his friendship with composer Richard Wagner two years earlier, Nietzsche dedicated the original 1878 edition of Human, All Too Human ‚Äúto the memory of Voltaire on the celebration of the anniversary of his death, May 30, 1778.‚Äù Instead of a preface, the first part originally included a quotation from Descartes's Discourse on the Method. Nietzsche later republished all three parts as a two-volume edition in 1886, adding a preface to each volume, and removing the Descartes quotation as well as the dedication to Voltaire. Background In 1876, Nietzsche broke with Wagner, and in the same year his increasingly bad health (possibly the early effects of a brain tumor)Matthews, Robert. 4 May 2003. \\"Madness' of Nietzsche was cancer not syphilis .\\" The Telegraph.Sax, Leonard. 2003. \\"What Was the Cause of Nietzsche's Dementia?.\\" Journal of Medical Biography 11:47‚Äì54. compelled him to request a leave of absence from his academic duties at the University of Basel. In the autumn of 1876, he joined his friend Paul R√©e in Sorrento, at the home of a wealthy patron of the arts, Malwida von Meysenbug, and began work on Human, All Too Human. = Inspiration = The genre of the aphorism was already well established at the time of writing this book: in the German tradition, Nietzsche's most important predecessor was a figure of the Enlightenment, Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, whose writing Nietzsche greatly admired. Nietzsche's work is indebted also to Schopenhauer's, particularly his Aphorisms for Practical Wisdom (1851). Above all else is the \\"debt to the French tradition of the aphorism ‚Äì for Nietzsche's work is a deliberate turn westward.\\" Nietzsche cites the French aphorists Jean de La Bruy√®re and Prosper M√©rim√©e, and in Aphorism 221 celebrates Voltaire. At the beginning of the second section, Nietzsche mentions La Rochefoucauld‚Äînamed here as a model, the epitome of the aphorist‚Äîand it is known that Nietzsche had a copy of La Rochefoucauld's Sentences et maximes (1665) in his library. He had been reading it shortly before beginning to write Human, All Too Human, on the train ride to Sorrento, in fact. More than that of the other French aphorists mentioned, it is La Rochefoucauld's work that lies behind that of Nietzsche. Style Unlike his first book, The Birth of Tragedy, which was written in essay style, Human, All Too Human is a collection of aphorisms, a style which Nietzsche would use in many of his subsequent works. The aphorisms of Human, All Too Human range from a few words to a few pages, but most are short paragraphs. The 638 aphorisms of the first installment are divided by subject into nine sections, with a short poem as an epilogue. The eponymous phrase itself appears in Aphorism 35 (originally conceived as the first aphorism) \\"when Nietzsche observes that maxims about human nature can help in overcoming life's hard moments.\\" Implicit also, is a drive to overcome what is human, all too human through understanding it, through philosophy. The second and third installments are an additional 408 and 350 aphorisms respectively. Nietzsche's work, while inspired by the work of aphorists like La Rochefoucauld who came before him, \\"is unique;\\" > [H]e covers a range of issues far greater than the social and psychological > area of interest to La Rochefoucauld. To the cynicism typical of the genre, > Nietzsche brings a new dimension by his combination of nihilistic energy > with historical consciousness. Finally, he expands the genre to include not > merely insights, but argument as well.\\" The aphorism \\"allows for a loosely organised, shifting whole containing specific ideas but no iron-clad explanation for everything, ‚Äì [it] constitutes the style that best represents his philosophy.\\" This book represents the beginning of Nietzsche's \\"middle period,\\" with a break from German Romanticism and from Wagner and with a definite positivist slant. Reluctant to construct a systematic philosophy, this book comprises more a collection of debunkings of unwarranted assumptions than an interpretation; it \\"contains the seeds of concepts crucial to Nietzsche's later philosophy, such as the need to transcend conventional Christian morality.\\" He uses his perspectivism and the idea of the will to power as explanatory devices, though the latter remains less developed than in his later thought. Structure and content = \\"Of First and Last Things\\" = In this first section, Nietzsche deals with metaphysics, specifically its origins as relating to dreams, the dissatisfaction with oneself, and language as well. = \\"On the History of Moral Feelings\\" = This section, named in honor of his friend Paul R√©e's On the Origin of Moral Sensations, Nietzsche challenges the Christian idea of good and evil, as it was philosophized by Arthur Schopenhauer. > At the waterfall. When we see a waterfall, we think we see freedom of will > and choice in the innumerable turnings, windings, breakings of the waves; > but everything is necessary; each movement can be calculated mathematically. > Thus it is with human actions; if one were omniscient, one would be able to > calculate each individual action in advance, each step in the progress of > knowledge, each error, each act of malice. To be sure the acting man is > caught in his illusion of volition; if the wheel of the world were to stand > still for a moment and an omniscient, calculating mind were there to take > advantage of this interruption, he would be able to tell into the farthest > future of each being and describe every rut that wheel will roll upon. The > acting man's delusion about himself, his assumption that free will exists, > is also part of the calculable mechanism. = \\"From the Soul of Artists and Writers\\" = Nietzsche uses this section to denounce the idea of divine inspiration in art, claiming that great art is the result of hard work, not a higher power or \\"genius.\\" This can be interpreted as a veiled attack on his former friend Wagner (a strong believer in genius), though Nietzsche never mentions him by name, instead simply using the term \\"the artist.\\" = \\"Signs of Higher and Lower Culture\\" = Here, Nietzsche criticizes Charles Darwin, as he frequently does, for being naive and derivative of Thomas Hobbes and early English economists, as well as for being without an account of life from the \\"inside.\\" Consider, in this light, Darwin's own introduction to the first edition of Origin; also Nietzsche's critique to the effect that Darwinism, as typically understood, is trading in a new version of the Providential: > Wherever progress is to ensue, deviating natures are of greatest importance. > Every progress of the whole must be preceded by a partial weakening. The > strongest natures retain the type, the weaker ones help to advance it. > Something similar also happens in the individual. There is rarely a > degeneration, a truncation, or even a vice or any physical or \\"moral\\" loss > without an advantage somewhere else. In a warlike and restless clan, for > example, the sicklier man may have occasion to be alone, and may therefore > become quieter and wiser; the one-eyed man will have one eye the stronger; > the blind man may see deeper inwardly, and certainly hear better. To this > extent, the famous theory of the survival of the fittest does not seem to be > the only viewpoint from which to explain the progress of strengthening of a > man or of a race. Nietzsche writes of the \\"free spirit\\" or \\"free thinker\\" (German: freigeist), and his role in society; a sort of proto-√úbermensch, forming the basis of a concept he extensively explores in his later work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra. A free spirit is one who goes against the herd, and ‚Äúonwards along the path of wisdom‚Äù in order to better society. \\"Better,\\" for Nietzsche, appears to mean ordered toward the production of rare genius and is hardly to be confused with what \\"a newspaper reader,\\" as Nietzsche might put it, would expect. The essential thing to keep in mind in considering Zarathustra, in particular, is that Nietzsche presents Zarathustra as failing. = \\"Man in Society\\" and \\"Women and Child\\" = These two sections are made up of very short aphorisms on men's, women's and the child's nature or their \\"evolution,\\" in Nietzsche's subtle, anti-Darwinian sense. = \\"Man Alone with Himself\\" = Like sections six and seven, Nietzsche's aphorisms here are mostly short, but also poetic and at times could be interpreted as semi-autobiographical, in anticipation of the next volumes: ‚ÄúHe who has come only in part to a freedom of reason cannot feel on earth otherwise than as a wanderer.\\" Nietzsche also distinguishes the obscurantism of the metaphysicians and theologians from the more subtle obscurantism of Kant's critical philosophy and modern philosophical skepticism, claiming that obscurantism is that which obscures existence rather than obscures ideas alone: \\"The essential element in the black art of obscurantism is not that it wants to darken individual understanding but that it wants to blacken our picture of the world, and darken our idea of existence.\\" Reception Within his lifetime, prior to his mental breakdown in 1889, few of Nietzsche's books sold particularly well, and Human, All Too Human was no exception. The first installment was originally printed in 1,000 copies in 1878, selling only 120 at the time, and selling less than half by 1886, when it was resold as the complete two-volume set. Though his friendship with Richard Wagner was nearly over, Wagner actually received a signed copy, though he never read it, saying Nietzsche would thank him for this one day.Tanner, Michael, et al. 1997. German Philosophers: Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 370 = Oehler and Nazism = Most notoriously, Human, All Too Human was used by archivist Max Oehler, a strong supporter of Hitler, as supposed evidence of Nietzsche's support for nationalism and anti-Semitism, both of which he writes against. Oehler wrote an entire book, Friedrich Nietzsche und die Deutsche Zukunft ('Friedrich Nietzsche and the German Future'), dealing with Nietzsche and his connection to nationalism (specifically National Socialism) and anti-Semitism, using quotes from Human, All Too Human, though out of context. Nietzsche would speak against anti-Semitism in other works including Thus Spoke Zarathustra and, most strongly, in The Antichrist: \\"An anti-Semite is certainly not any more decent because he lies as a matter of principle.\\"Nietzsche, Friedrich W. The Portable Nietzsche. Trans. Walter A. Kaufmann. New York: Viking Press, 1954. P. 641, ¬ß55 In Zarathustra, Nietzsche set Wagner up as a straw man, lampooning his anti-Semitism in the process. Oehler also had control of Nietzsche's archive during the Nazis' rule, which he shared with Nietzsche's sister, Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche, a Hitler supporter herself, until her death, when he took it over. It was not until much of Walter Kaufmann's work in the 1950s through the 1970s that Nietzsche was able to shed this connection with nationalism and anti-Semitism.  Translations  The work was first translated into English in 1908 by Alexander Harvey, a Belgian-born American journalist, and was published in Chicago by Charles. H. Kerr, a small but notable publishing house of socially progressive literature. Following this, a 1909 translation by writer Helen Zimmern was published as part of a complete edition of Nietzsche's books in English, but was never translated by Walter Kaufmann when he translated most of Nietzsche's works into English in the 1950s and '60s. Finally, in the 1980s, the first part was translated by Marion Faber and completely translated by R.J. Hollingdale the same decade. Faber was critical of Zimmern's \\"antiquated Victorian style\\" which made Nietzsche \\"sound in her translation like a fusty contemporary of Matthew Arnold.\\" Faber further noted bowdlerizations and errors in Zimmern's work. For example, in Aphorism 61 where Schaf ('sheep') is translated by Zimmern as fool, where the reference is to Sophocles' play Ajax in which the hero charges a herd of sheep.

The region lies south of the Vindhya Range, and consists of two portions of the Narmada and Tapti river valleys, separated by a section of the Satpura Range, about 15 miles (24 km) in breadth. On the highest peak, about 800 ft (244 m) above the plain and 1800 ft (549 m) above sea-level, stands the fortress of Asirgarh, commanding a pass which has for centuries been the chief highway between Upper India and the Deccan. The Nimar region is home to the Nimadi language, which is related to the Malvi language of Malwa as well as the other Rajasthani languages. Nimar formed a district of British India, in the Nerbudda Division of the Central Provinces. The administrative headquarters were at Khandwa; but the capital in Muslim times was Burhanpur. Area, 4273 mi¬≤ (11,067 km¬≤), population (1901) 329,615. The staple crops were cotton and millet; ganja or Indian hemp was also allowed to be grown under government supervision. The Great Indian Peninsula railway ran through the district, and a branch of the Rajputana line from Indore joined it at Khandwa. There were factories for ginning and pressing cotton at Khandwa, and manufacture of gold- embroidered cloth at Burhanpur. The district contained extensive forests, and the government preserved a section known is the Punasa forest, which extended for about 120 miles (190 km) along the south bank of the Narmada, home to forests of teak (Tectona grandis), sain (Terminalia tomentosa) and anjan (Hardwickia binata) trees. Nimar was also a district in the princely state of Indore lying west of the British district on both banks of the Narmada. Area, 3871 mile¬≤ (10,026 km¬≤); pop. (1901) 257,110. From 1823 onwards this tract, then belonging to Sindhia rulers of Gwalior, was under British management; in 1861 it was ceded in full sovereignty to the British, but in 1867 it passed to Holkar rulers of Indore as the result of an exchange of territory. After Indian independence in 1947, The former British district became the Nimar District of the new state of Madhya Pradesh, with its administrative seat at Khandwa; the Nimar District of Indore state became the Nimar district of the new state of Madhya Bharat, with its administrative seat at Khargone. When Madhya Bharat was merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956, The former Madhya Bharat district became West Nimar District, while the eastern district became East Nimar District. West Nimar district was split into the districts of Barwani and Khargone on 24 May 1998 and similarly East Nimar district was split into the districts of Khandwa and Burhanpur on 15 August 2003.

Although it was written in 1888, its controversial content made Franz Overbeck and Heinrich K√∂selitz delay its publication, along with Ecce Homo.Nietzsche Chronicle: 1889 The German title can be translated into English as either The Anti-Christ or The Anti-Christian, depending on how the German word Christ is translated.Nietzsche, Friedrich. 1990. The Anti‚ÄìChrist, translated by R. J. Hollingdale, with introduction by M. Tanner. Penguin Books. . The English word \\"Christian\\" is considered a weak noun in German and, in the singular nominative case, it is translated as \\"der Christ.\\" In German, der antichrist can mean either 'the anti‚ÄìChrist' or 'the anti‚ÄìChristian'  Content  =Preface= Nietzsche claims in the preface to have written the book for a very limited readership. In order to understand the book, he asserts that the reader \\"must be honest in intellectual matters to the point of hardness to so much as endure my seriousness, my passion.\\" The reader should be above politics and nationalism. Also, the usefulness or harmfulness of truth should not be a concern. Characteristics such as \\"[s]trength which prefers questions for which no one today is sufficiently daring; courage for the forbidden\\" are also needed. He disregards all other readers:Nietzsche, Friedrich. [1895] 1924. \\"Preface.\\" Pp. 37‚Äì40 in The Antichrist (2nd ed.), translated by H. L. Mencken (1918). New York: Alfred A.

[1895] 1924. The Antichrist (2nd ed.), translated by H. L. Mencken (1918). New York: Alfred A. Knopf. ¬ß 1. This relates to Arthur Schopenhauer's claim that knowledge of the inner nature of the world and life results in \\"perfect resignation, which is the innermost spirit of Christianity.\\"Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation I, ¬ß 48 Nietzsche introduces his concept of will to power in ¬ß 2, using its relation to define notions of good, bad, and happiness:Nietzsche, Friedrich. [1895] 1924. The Antichrist (2nd ed.), translated by H. L. Mencken (1918). New York: Alfred A. Knopf. ¬ß 2. > What is good?‚ÄîWhatever augments the feeling of power, the will to power, > power itself, in man. What is evil?‚ÄîWhatever springs from weakness. What is > happiness?‚ÄîThe feeling that power increases‚Äîthat resistance is overcome. Nietzsche follows this passage with provocative and shocking language: > The weak and the botched shall perish: first principle of our charity. And > one should help them to it. What is more harmful than any vice?‚ÄîPractical > sympathy for the botched and the weak‚ÄîChristianity.... This is an example of Nietzsche's reaction against Schopenhauer, who had based all morality on compassion.\\"It is this Compassion alone which is the real basis of all voluntary justice and all genuine loving‚Äìkindness. Only insofar as an action springs therefrom, has it moral value; and all conduct that proceeds from any other motive whatever has none.\\" Schopenhauer, The Basis of Morality III.v. Nietzsche, on the contrary, praises \\"virtue free of moralic acid.\\" Nietzsche goes on to say that mankind, out of fear, has bred a weak, sick type of human. He blames Christianity for demonizing strong, higher humans. Pascal, he claims, was an intellectually strong man who was depraved by Christianity's teaching of original sin.Nietzsche, Friedrich. [1895] 1924. The Antichrist (2nd ed.), translated by H. L. Mencken (1918). New York: Alfred A. Knopf. ¬ß¬ß 3‚Äì5.Nietzsche's opinion of Pascal is again the opposite of Schopenhauer's. In Volume I of his main work, Schopenhauer considers Pascal's asceticism and quietism as examples of justice and goodness (¬ß 66). With regard to original sin, Schopenhauer wrote: \\"The doctrine of original sin (affirmation of the will) and of salvation (denial of the will) is really the great truth which constitutes the kernel of Christianity, while the rest is in the main only clothing and covering, or something accessory\\"(¬ß 70). Mankind, according to Nietzsche, is corrupt and its highest values are depraved. He asserts that \\"all the values in which mankind at present summarizes its highest desiderata are decadence values.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 6 Mankind is depraved because it has lost its instincts and prefers what is harmful to it: > I consider life itself instinct for growth, for durability, for accumulation > of forces, for power: where the will to power is lacking there is decline. Depravity results because \\"nihilistic values dominate under the holiest names.\\" =Christian pity= Christianity, as a religion of peace, is despised by Nietzsche. According to Nietzsche's account, pity has a depressive effect, loss of vitality and strength, and is harmful to life. It also preserves that which should naturally be destroyed. For a noble morality, pity is a weakness, but for Christianity, it is a virtue. In Schopenhauer's philosophy, which Nietzsche sees as the most nihilistic and opposed to life, pity is the highest virtue of all. But, for Nietzsche:Nietzsche, Friedrich. [1895] 1924. The Antichrist (2nd ed.), translated by H. L. Mencken (1918). New York: Alfred A. Knopf. ¬ß7. > [I]n the role of protector of the miserable, it is a prime agent in the > promotion of d√©cadence‚Äîpity persuades to extinction.... Of course, one > doesn't say \\"extinction\\": one says \\"the other world,\\" or \\"God,\\" or \\"the true > life,\\" or Nirvana, salvation, blessedness.... This innocent rhetoric, from > the realm of religious-ethical balderdash, appears a good deal less innocent > when one reflects upon the tendency that it conceals beneath sublime words: > the tendency to destroy life. Schopenhauer was hostile to life: that is why > pity appeared to him as a virtue. He goes on further, mentioning that the moderns Leo Tolstoy and Richard Wagner adopted Schopenhauer's viewpoint. Aristotle, who lived in 384-322 BC, on the other hand, recognized the unhealthiness of pity and prescribed tragedy as a purgative. =Theologians, priests, and philosophers= Theology and philosophy, practiced by priests and idealists, are antithetical to reality and actuality. They are supposed to represent a high, pure and superior spirit that is above and has \\"benevolent contempt for the 'understanding', the 'senses', 'honors', 'good living' and 'science'.\\"Nietzsche, Friedrich. [1895] 1924. The Antichrist (2nd ed.), translated by H. L. Mencken (1918). New York: Alfred A. Knopf. ¬ß8. To Nietzsche, however, \\"[t]he pure soul is a pure lie,\\" as he calls the priest a \\"professional denier, calumniator and poisoner of life,... [an] obvious attorney of mere emptiness\\" who stands truth upside down on its head. Theologians are placed by Nietzsche in the same class as priests, defining the faith that they foster as \\"closing one's eyes upon one's self once for all, to avoid suffering the sight of incurable falsehood.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß9. Seeing falsely is then valued as the highest morality. This reversal of values is considered, by Nietzsche, to be harmful to life. When the theologians seek political power, \\"the will to make an end, the nihilistic will exerts that power.\\" In his native Germany, philosophy is corrupt because it is theological. Nietzsche points to Immanuel Kant, who supported theological ideals by his discussions of the concepts of \\"true world\\" and \\"morality as the essence of the world.\\" Kant's sceptical procedure was to show that these concepts could not be refuted, even though they could not be proven.Nietzsche, Friedrich. [1895] 1924. The Antichrist (2nd ed.), translated by H. L. Mencken (1918). New York: Alfred A. Knopf. ¬ß10. Nietzsche is especially critical of Kant's 'categorical imperative' as it was not the result of a personal necessity and choice. Its origin from concepts and logic was decadent because it was not a product of life, growth, self-preservation, and pleasure.The Antichrist, ¬ß11 Kant's practical reason was an attempt to give scientific legitimacy to his lack of intellectual conscience:The Antichrist, ¬ß12 > He deliberately invented a variety of reasons for use on occasions when it > was desirable not to trouble with reason‚Äîthat is, when morality, when the > sublime command 'thou shalt,' was heard. Kant's self-deceptive fraudulence is a result of the influence of priestly theology on his philosophy. =Scientific method= Nietzsche considers a free spirit to be the embodiment of a transvaluation of all values. Nietzsche claims that, prior to his time, the scientific method of searching for truth and knowledge was met with scorn and derision. A quiet, cautious, modest manner was seen with contempt.The Antichrist., ¬ß13 Our present modesty compels us to recognize man's derivation from animals, not divinities. Also, we know that man is not superior to other animals. By reducing man to a mere machine, devoid of free will, we have learned much about his physiology. Will is now known to be a necessary reaction to a stimulus. Consciousness and spirit derive from instinct.The Antichrist, ¬ß14 =Christian God= Nietzsche claims that the Christian religion and its morality are based on imaginary fictions. However, \\"the whole of that fictitious world has its sources in hatred of the natural (‚Äîthe real!‚Äî).\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß15 Such hatred results from the decadence of Christianity, which is reflected by the Christian conception of God. If Christians were naturally strong and confident, they would have a God who is destructive as well as good. A God who counsels love of enemy, as well as of friend, is a God of a people who feel themselves as perishing and without hope.The Antichrist, ¬ß16 Weak, decadent, and sick people, whose will to power has declined, will give themselves a God who is purely good, according to Nietzsche. They will then attribute evil and deviltry to their masters' God. Metaphysicians have eliminated the attributes of virile (m√§nnliche) virtues, such as strength, bravery, and pride, from the concept of God. As a result, it deteriorated into an insubstantial ideal, pure spirit, Absolute, or thing in itself.The Antichrist, ¬ß17 Nietzsche opposes the Christian concept of God because:The Antichrist, ¬ß18 > God degenerated into the contradiction of life. Instead of being its > transfiguration and eternal Yea! In him war is declared on life, on nature, > on the will to live! God becomes the formula for every slander upon the > \\"here and now,\\" and for every lie about the \\"beyond\\"! Recalling Schopenhauer's description of the denial of the will to live and the subsequent empty nothingness,Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation I, ¬ß 71 Nietzsche proclaims of the Christian God that \\"[i]n him nothingness is deified, and the will to nothingness is made holy!...\\" Nietzsche criticizes the \\"strong races of northern Europe\\" for accepting the Christian God and not creating a new god of their own: \\"Two thousand years have come and gone‚Äîand not a single new god!\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß19 He maintains that the traditional \\"pitiful god of Christian monotono-theism\\" supports \\"all the instincts of d√©cadence, all the cowardices and wearinesses of the soul find their sanction!\\" =Buddhism vs Christianity= Although he considers both Christianity and Buddhism to be nihilistic, decadent religions, Nietzsche considers the latter to be more realistic as it poses objective problems and does not use the concept of God. Nietzsche believes that, in all of religious history, Buddhism is the only positivistic religion as it struggles against actual suffering, which is experienced as fact or illusion (i.e., the concept of maya) in various Buddhist traditions. Christianity, by contrast, struggles against sin, while suggesting that suffering can have a redemptive quality. Nietzsche claims that Buddhism is \\"beyond good and evil\\" because it has developed past the \\"self-deception that lies in moral concepts.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß20 Buddha created the religion in order to assist individuals in ridding themselves of the suffering of life: \\"Cheerfulness, quiet and the absence of desire are the chief desiderata, and they are attained.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß21 Buddhism has its roots in higher and also learned classes of people, whereas Christianity was the religion of the lowest classes, Nietzsche writes. He also believes that Christianity had conquered barbarians by making them sick.The Antichrist, ¬ß 22 Buddhism objectively claims \\"I suffer,\\" while Christianity interprets suffering in relation to sin.The Antichrist, ¬ß23 Buddhism is too positivistic and truthful to have advocated the Christian virtues of faith, hope, and charity. Nietzsche refers to such virtues as the three Christian shrewdnesses: faith and belief are opposed to reason, knowledge, and inquiry. To Nietzsche, hope in the Beyond sustains the unhappy multitudes. =Origin of Christianity= Jewish priesthood Jewish, and subsequently--to a greater degree--Christian, priests survived and attained power by siding with decadents, Nietzsche claims. They turned against the natural world. Their \\"instincts of ressentiment\\" against those who were well- constituted led them to \\"invent an other world in which the acceptance of life appeared as the most evil and abominable thing imaginable.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß24 In order to survive, the Jewish priests made use of the decadents and their large population. The Jews were not decadents, themselves--they are the \\"very opposite.\\" Rather, according to Nietzsche, they have \\"the most powerful national will to live, that has ever appeared on earth.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß27 However, \\"they have simply been forced into appearing\\" as decadents, in order to \\"put themselves at the head of all d√©cadent movements (‚Äîfor example, the Christianity of Paul‚Äî), and so make of them something stronger than any party frankly saying Yes to life.\\" =Five stages of denaturalizing values= #Israel's Yahweh/Jahveh \\"was an expression of its consciousness of power, its joy in itself, its hopes for itself.\\" Because he is their God, they considered him to be the God of justice. The Jews affirmed themselves, realized their own power, and had a good conscience. Even after internal anarchy and Assyrian invasions weakened Israel, it retained its worship of God as a king who is both soldier and judge.The Antichrist, ¬ß25 #Concept of God is falsified: Yahweh became a demanding god. \\"Jahveh, the god of \\"justice\\"‚Äîhe is in accord with Israel no more, he no longer vizualizes the national egoism.\\" #Concept of morality is falsified: morality is no longer an expression of life and growth. Rather, it opposes life by presenting wellbeing as a dangerous temptation. The public notion of this God becomes weaponized by clerical agitators, who \\"interpret all happiness as a reward and all unhappiness as a punishment for obedience or disobedience to him, for 'sin'\\" #History of Israel is falsified: The great epoch becomes an epoch of decay. \\"the Exile, with its long series of misfortunes, was transformed into a punishment for that great age‚Äîduring which priests had not yet come into existence.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß26 The past is translated into religious terms; it was a record of guilt, punishment, piety, and reward in relation to Yahweh. A moral world order is established which assigns value to actions that obey the will of God (and which claims that this general will, i.e. the right way of life for everyone, is eternal and unchanging). Priests teach that \\"the ruling power of the will of God, expressed as punishment and reward according to the degree of obedience, is demonstrated in the destiny of a nation, of an individual.\\" #'God's will is revealed in the holy scripture: the sacred book formulates the will of God and specifies what is to be given to the priests. The priest sanctifies and bestows all value: disobedience of God (the priest) is 'sin;' subjection to God (the priest) is redemption. Priests use 'sin' to gain and hold power. > From this time forward things were so arranged that the priest became > indispensable everywhere; at all the great natural events of life, at birth, > at marriage, in sickness, at death, not to say at the sacrifice' (that is, > at meal-times), the holy parasite put in his appearance, and proceeded to > denaturize it. Revolt against Jewish priesthood The Jewish church opposed and negated nature, reality, and the world as being sinful and unholy. Christianity then negated the Jewish church and its holy, chosen people, according to Nietzsche. > The phenomenon is of the first order of importance: the small > insurrectionary movement which took the name of Jesus of Nazareth is simply > the Jewish instinct redivivus‚Äîin other words, it is the priestly instinct > come to such a pass that it can no longer endure the priest as a fact; it is > the discovery of a state of existence even more fantastic than any before > it, of a vision of life even more unreal than that necessary to an > ecclesiastical organization. The Jewish church and the Jewish nation received this rebellion as a threat to its existence. > This saintly anarchist, who aroused the people of the abyss, the outcasts > and \\"sinners,\\" the Chandala of Judaism, to rise in revolt against the > established order of things...this man was certainly a political > criminal.... This is what brought him to the cross.... He died for his own > sins... The Redeemer type Nietzsche criticizes Ernest Renan's attribution of the concepts genius and hero to Jesus. Nietzsche thinks that the word idiot best describes Jesus. According to Walter Kaufmann,The Portable Nietzsche, note, p. 601 Nietzsche might have been referring to the na√Øve protagonist of Dostoevsky's The Idiot. With an antipathy toward the material world, Jesus has \\"a feeling of being at home in a world in which no sort of reality survives, a merely 'inner' world, a 'true' world, an 'eternal' world.... 'The Kingdom of God is within you'.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß29 Nietzsche believes that the redeemer type is determined by a morbid intolerance of pain. Extreme sensitivity results in avoidance of the world, and any feeling of resistance to the world is experienced as pain. Even evil is therefore not resisted: \\"The fear of pain, even of infinitely slight pain‚Äîthe end of this can be nothing save a religion of love....\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß30 Jesus was a distorted version of the redeemer type. The first disciples, in their Gospels, described him as having Old-Testament characteristics such as prophet, messiah, miracle worker, moral preacher, and so on. Dostoevsky could have revealed his sickliness and childishness.The Antichrist, ¬ß31 According to Jesus, \\"the kingdom of heaven belongs to children.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß32 Everyone has an equal right to become a child of God. His spirituality is infantile, a result of delayed puberty. Jesus does not resist or contend with the world because he doesn't recognize the importance of the world. His life is its own kingdom of God at every moment. Early Christians used Semitic concepts to express his teaching, but his anti-realism could just as easily have been a characteristic of Taoism or Hinduism. Nietzsche asserts that the psychological reality of redemption was a \\"new way of life, not a new faith.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß33 It is \\"[t]he deep instinct which prompts the Christian how to live so that he will feel that he is 'in heaven'.\\" The Christian is known by his acts. He offers no resistance to evil, He has no anger and wants no revenge. Blessedness is not promised on conditions, as in Judaism. The Gospel's glad tidings are that there is no distinction between God and man. There is no Judaic concern for sin, prayers, rituals, forgiveness, repentance, guilt, punishment, or faith: > [H]e knew that it was only by a way of life that one could feel one's self > 'divine,' 'blessed,' 'evangelical,' a 'child of God.' Not by 'repentance,' > not by 'prayer and forgiveness' is the way to God: only the Gospel way leads > to God‚Äîit is itself 'God!' There were two worlds for the teacher of the Gospel's glad tidings: the real, true world is an inner experience of the heart in which all things are blessedly transfigured (verkl√§rung), eternalized, and perfected. The apparent world, however, is only a collection of psychological symbols, signs, and metaphors. These symbols are expressed in terms of space, time, history, and nature. Examples of these mere symbols are the concepts of \\"God as a person,\\" \\"the son of man,\\" \\"the hour of death,\\" and \\"the kingdom of heaven.\\" Jesus did not want to redeem anyone. He wanted to show how to live. His legacy was his bearing and behavior. He did not resist evildoers. He loved evildoers. Nietzsche has Jesus tell the thief on the cross that he is in Paradise now if he recognizes the divinity of Jesus' comportment.The Antichrist, ¬ß35 =History of Christianity= Opposite development Nietzsche sees a world-historical irony in the way that the Christian Church developed in antithetical opposition to the Evangel and the Gospel of early Christianity.The Antichrist, ¬ß36 The fable of Christ as miracle worker and redeemer is not the origin of Christianity. The beginnings of Christianity is not in the \\"crude fable of the wonder-worker and Saviour.\\" Rather, such is a \\"progressively clumsier misunderstanding of an original symbolism:\\" the death on the cross.The Antichrist, ¬ß37 Christianity became more diseased, base, morbid, vulgar, low, barbaric and crude: > A sickly barbarism finally lifts itself to power as the church‚Äîthe church, > that incarnation of deadly hostility to all honesty, to all loftiness of > soul, to all discipline of the spirit, to all spontaneous and kindly > humanity.‚ÄîChristian values‚Äînoble values. Nietzsche expresses contempt for his contemporaries because they mendaciously call themselves Christians but do not act like true Christians. Modern people act with worldly egoism, pride, and will to power in opposition to Christianity's denial of the world. Nietzsche considers this falseness to be indecent. Unlike past ages, his contemporaries know that sham and unnatural concepts such as \\"God,\\" \\"moral world-order,\\" \\"sinner,\\" \\"Redeemer,\\" \\"free will,\\" \\"beyond,\\" \\"Last Judgment,\\" and \\"immortal soul\\" are consciously employed in order to provide power to the church and its priests.The Antichrist, ¬ß38 \\"The very word 'Christianity' is a misunderstanding,\\" Nietzsche explains:The Antichrist, ¬ß39 > [A]t bottom there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross.... It is > an error amounting to nonsensicality to see in \\"faith\\", and particularly in > faith in salvation through Christ, the distinguishing mark of the Christian: > only the Christian way of life, the life lived by him who died on the cross, > is Christian Thereafter, the opposite kind of life was called Christian. Belief in redemption through Christ is not originally Christian. Genuine, original, primitive Christianity is \\"[n]ot faith, but acts; above all, an avoidance of acts, a different state of being.\\" Jesus wanted his death on the cross to be an example of how a person can be free from resentment, revenge, and rebellion. The disciples, however, wanted revenge against the Jewish ruling class and high priests who had delivered him to Pilate. They elevated Jesus into being the Messiah and Son of God and promised future judgment and punishment in the kingdom of God.The Antichrist, ¬ß40 This was in opposition to Jesus' doctrine that everyone could be a child of God and experience Heaven in their present lives by acting in a gentle, loving manner. Paul and the promise of eternal life The apostles claimed that Jesus' death was a sacrifice of an innocent man for the sins of the guilty. But \\"Jesus him self had done away with the very concept of 'guilt,' he denied that there was any gulf fixed between God and man; he lived this unity between God and man, and that was precisely his 'glad tidings'\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 41 In order to claim that there is life after death, the apostles ignored Jesus' example of blessed living. Paul emphasizes the concept of immortality in First Corinthians 15:17, as Nietzsche explains: > St. Paul...gave a logical quality to that conception, that indecent > conception, in this way: 'If Christ did not rise from the dead, then all our > faith is in vain!'‚ÄîAnd at once there sprang from the Gospels the most > contemptible of all unfulfillable promises, the shameless doctrine of > personal immortality.... Paul even preached it as a reward.... Paul used the promise of life after death as a way to seize tyrannical power over the masses of lower-class people.The Antichrist, ¬ß 42 This changed Christianity from a peace movement that achieves actual happiness into a religion whose final judgment offers possible resurrection and eternal life. Paul falsified the history of Christianity, the history of Israel, and the history of mankind by making them all seem to be a preparation for the crucifixion. \\"The vast lie of personal immortality destroys all reason, all natural instinct‚Äîhenceforth, everything in the instincts that is beneficial, that fosters life and that safeguards the future is a cause of suspicion.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 43 The 'meaning' of life is that there is no meaning to present life. One lives for life in the beyond. By offering immortal life after death to everyone, Christianity appealed to everyone's egoism. The laws of nature would be broken for the salvation of everyone. \\"And yet Christianity has to thank precisely this miserable flattery of personal vanity for its triumph‚Äîit was thus that it lured all the botched, the dissatisfied, the fallen upon evil days, the whole refuse and off-scouring of humanity to its side.\\" This influenced politics and led to revolutions against aristocracies. Nietzsche claims that Paul's pretense of holiness and his use of priestly concepts were typically Jewish. Christianity separated itself from Judaism as though it was the chosen religion, \\"just as if the Christian were the meaning, the salt, the standard and even the last judgment of all the rest.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 44 Christianity then divided itself from the world by appropriation: \\"[L]ittle abortions of bigots and liars began to claim exclusive rights in the concepts of 'God,' 'the truth,' 'the light,' 'the spirit,' 'love,' 'wisdom' and 'life,' as if these things were synonyms of themselves.\\" According to Nietzsche: > The whole of Judaism appears in Christianity as the art of concocting holy > lies, and there...the business comes to the stage of mastery. The Christian, > that ultima ratio of lying, is the Jew all over again‚Äîhe is threefold the > Jew.... The Christian is simply a Jew of the \\"reformed\\" confession. Gospel of resentment Nietzsche asserts:The Antichrist, ¬ß 46 > The 'early Christian'‚Äîand also, I fear, the 'last Christian'...‚Äîis a rebel > against all privilege by profound instinct‚Äîhe lives and makes war for ever > for 'equal rights.'... When a man proposes to represent, in his own person, > the 'chosen of God'...then every other criterion, whether based upon > honesty, upon intellect, upon manliness and pride, or upon beauty and > freedom of the heart, becomes simply \\"worldly\\"‚Äîevil in itself. Against science The Christian God is harmful and a crime against life. \\"The God that Paul invented for himself\\" is a negation of God.The Antichrist, ¬ß 47 Christianity, in its opposition to reality, \\"'reduced to absurdity' 'the wisdom of this world' (especially the two great enemies of superstition, philology and medicine).\\" Nietzsche claims that Paul willed to ruin the 'wisdom of this world' and, in Jewish fashion, Paul gave the name of \\"God\\" and Torah to his own will. According to Nietzsche, the Old Testament, Genesis 3:5, chronicles the hellish anxiety of God, and thus the priests, in regards to science. Man tasted knowledge and created his own enemy; \\"science makes men godlike‚Äîit is all up with priests and gods when man becomes scientific!\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 48 Priests used the concepts of \\"sin,\\" \\"guilt,\\" and \\"punishment\\" to oppose knowledge, science, and the concepts of cause and effect. Sinful, suffering humans believe in supernatural agents. Such sinners are dependent on their priests for salvation, redemption, and forgiveness. \\"[T]he priest rules through the invention of sin.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 49 =Psychology of belief= Belief is \\"a sign of d√©cadence, of a broken will to live.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 50 The Christian \\"proof by power\\" is that \\"[f]aith makes blessed: therefore it is true.\\" However, blessedness is something that the priest merely promises, not demonstrated; \\"it hangs upon \\"faith\\" as a condition‚Äîone shall be blessed because one believes.\\" Blessedness‚Äîor, more technically, pleasure‚Äîcan never be a proof of truth: \\"proof by 'pleasure' is a proof of 'pleasure'‚Äînothing more; why in the world should it be assumed that true judgments give more pleasure than false ones...?\\" Nietzsche summarizes, \\"[f]aith makes blessed: therefore, it lies....\\" Illness Nietzsche alleges that \\"one is not \\"converted\\" to Christianity‚Äîone must first be sick enough for it.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 51 The decadent and sick types of people came to power through Christianity. From everywhere, the aggregate of the sick accumulated in Christianity and outnumbered the healthy. \\"The majority became master; democracy, with its Christian instincts, triumphed.\\" The meaning of the God on the Cross is that \\"[e]verything that suffers, everything that hangs on the cross, is divine.\\" Nietzsche continues:The Antichrist, ¬ß 52 > Since sickness is inherent in Christianity, it follows that the typically > Christian state of \\"faith\\" must be a form of sickness too, and that all > straight, straightforward and scientific paths to knowledge must be banned > by the church as forbidden ways. Doubt is thus a sin from the start. Knowledge requires caution, intellectual moderation, discipline, and self- overcoming. Christianity, however, uses sick reasoning, like martyrdom, to try to prove its truth. Christians think \\"that there must be something in a cause for which any one goes to his death.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 53 Nietzsche responds to this notion by quoting a passage from his own Zarathustra:Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Part II, \\"Of the Priests\\" To Nietzsche, \\"the need of faith, of something unconditioned by yea or nay...is a need of weakness.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 54 The Holy Lie and belief Lying, or not wanting to see as one sees, is a trait of those who are devoted to a party or faction. Lying is utilized by all priests, be they pagan, Jewish, or Christian:The Antichrist, ¬ß 55 > [T]he right to lie and the shrewd dodge of 'revelation' belong to the > general priestly type.... The 'law,' the 'will of God,' the 'holy book,' and > 'inspiration'‚Äîall these things are merely words for the conditions under > which the priest comes to power and with which he maintains his power... Christianity's lies are not holy. They serve \\"[o]nly bad ends...: the poisoning, the calumniation, the denial of life, the despising of the body, the degradation and self-contamination of man by the concept of sin.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 56 Contrarily, unlike any Bible, the Hindu 'Code of Manu'‚Äîor, manusmriti‚Äîlies for a good purpose: \\"by means of it the nobles, the philosophers and the warriors keep the whip-hand over the majority.\\" It affirms life, well-being, and happiness. The purpose of the Christian 'Holy Lie', however, is bad; all of it \\"proceeds from weakness, from envy, from revenge.\\" Thus, Nietzsche contends, \\"[t]he anarchist and the Christian have the same ancestry.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 57 Christianity lied about guilt, punishment, and immortality in order to destroy imperium Romanum, an organization that was designed to promote life. Paul realized that a \\"world conflagration\\" might be lit; \\"how, with the symbol of 'God on the cross,' all secret seditions, all the fruits of anarchistic intrigues in the empire, might be amalgamated into one immense power.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 58 Paul's revelation on the road to Damascus was that \\"he needed the belief in immortality in order to rob 'the world' of its value, that the concept of 'hell' would master Rome‚Äîthat the notion of a 'beyond' is the death of life.... Nihilist and Christian: they rhyme in German, and they do more than rhyme.\\" =Lost labor= Greece and Rome Christianity deprived us of the benefits of Greco-Roman culture from which, over two thousand years ago, the scientific method was discovered. The Greeks and Romans \\"[overnight]...became merely a memory:\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 59 > Instinctive nobility, taste, methodical inquiry, genius for organization and > administration, faith in and the will to secure the future of man, a great > yes to everything entering into the imperium Romanum and palpable to all the > senses....

Islam Nietzsche poses the question of why Christianity had trampled down the culture of Islam; of Mohammedan civilization. \\"Because,\\" Nietzsche explains, \\"it had to thank noble and manly instincts for its origin‚Äîbecause it said yes to life, even to the rare and refined luxuriousness of Moorish life!\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 60 The Crusades were \\"a higher form of piracy:\\"See also: Muslim settlement of Lucera. > Intrinsically there should be no more choice between Islam and Christianity > than there is between an Arab and a Jew.

And Luther restored the church: he attacked it. =Condemnation= Nietzsche concludes his work with the insistence that Christianity \\"turned every value into worthlessness, and every truth into a lie, and every integrity into baseness of soul.... [I]t lives by distress; it creates distress to make itself immortal.\\"The Antichrist, ¬ß 62 \\"To breed out of humanitas a self-contradiction, an art of self-pollution, a will to lie at any price, an aversion and contempt for all good and honest instincts,\\" in Nietzsche's view, is the spirit of Christianity. With its parasitism; with \\"the beyond as the will to deny all reality,\\" Nietzsche believes the \\"'humanitarianism' of Christianity\\" to be a conspiracy \\"against health, beauty, well-being, intellect, kindness of soul‚Äîagainst life itself.\\" He considers it to be a curse and a corruption. While humanity \\"reckons time from the \\" when this \\"fatality\\" emerged‚Äî\\"from the first day of Christianity\\"‚ÄîNietzsche asks \\"[w]hy not rather from its last?\\" Nietzsche suggests that time be calculated from \\"today,\\" the date of this book, whereby 'Year One' would begin on 30 September 1888‚Äî\\"The transvaluation of all values!\\" Thoughts on Jesus Nietzsche does not demur of Jesus, conceding that he was the only one true Christian. He presents a Christ whose own inner life consisted of \\"wit, the blessedness of peace, of gentleness, the inability to be an enemy.\\" Nietzsche heavily criticizes the organized institution of Christianity and its class of priests. Christ's evangelism consisted of the good news that the 'kingdom of God' is within you:The Antichrist, ¬ß34 \\"What is the meaning of 'glad tidings'?‚ÄîThe true life, the life eternal has been found‚Äîit is not merely promised, it is here, it is in you; it is the life that lies in love free from all retreats and exclusions,\\" whereby sin is abolished and away from \\"all keeping of distances\\" between man and God. \\"What the 'glad tidings' tell us is simply that there are no more contradictions; the kingdom of heaven belongs to children\\" Nietzsche does, however explicitly, consider Jesus as a mortal, and, moreover, as ultimately misguided: the antithesis of a 'true hero,' whom he posits with his concept of a 'Dionysian hero.'  Publication  =Title= The title is not a direct reference to the biblical 'Antichrist,' but is rather an attack on the \\"master‚Äìslave morality\\" and apathy of Western Christianity. Nietzsche's basic claim is that Christianity (as he saw it in the West) is a poisoner of western culture and perversion of the words of and practice of Jesus, the one, true 'Christian.' In this light, the provocative title mainly expresses Nietzsche's animus toward Christianity as such. In this book, Nietzsche is very critical of institutionalized religion and its priest class, from which he himself was descended. The majority of the book is a systematic attack upon the interpretations of Christ's words by Saint Paul and those who followed him. The German title, Der Antichrist, is ambiguous and open to two interpretations: the Antichrist, or the Anti-Christian.Kaufmann, Walter. 1974. Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist (4th ed.). Princeton: Princeton University Press. pg. 7. However, its use within the work generally admits only an \\"Anti-Christian\\" meaning. H. L. Mencken's 1918 translation and R. J. Hollingdale's 1968 translation both title their editions as \\"The Anti-Christ;\\" and Walter Kaufmann uses \\"The Antichrist,\\" while no major translation uses \\"The Anti- Christian.\\" Kaufmann considers The Antichrist the more appropriate way to render the German: \\"[a] translation of the title as 'The Antichristian'...overlooks that Nietzsche plainly means to be as provocative as possible.\\" Nietzsche makes polemics against Ernest Renan within The Anti- Christ, and Renan's 1873 L'ant√©christ saw an \\"authorized German-language edition\\" published the same year under the title, Der Antichrist. It is possible that Nietzsche named his book the same as a way of \\"calling out\\" Renan. =Sanity= This book was written shortly before Nietzsche's infamous nervous breakdown. However, as one scholar notes, \\"the Antichrist is unrelievedly vituperative, and would indeed sound insane were it not informed in its polemic by a structure of analysis and a theory of morality and religion worked out elsewhere.\\"Danto, Arthur.

US: Dartmouth College. Retrieved 27 May 2020. H. L. Mencken's English translation does not contain these words. However, in 1931, the words were reinstated by Josef Hofmiller. Likewise, English translations by Walter Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale also contain them. According to Kaufmann, Nietzsche was referring to Dostoevsky's book The Idiot and its na√Øve protagonist. The passage reads: =Christ's words to the thief on the cross= In ¬ß 35, Nietzsche wanted to convey the idea that, to Christ, Heaven is a subjective state of mind.Cf. Nietzsche, The Antichrist: * \\"True life, eternal life is found ‚Äî it is not promised, it is here, it is within you...\\" (¬ß 29). * \\"'The kingdom of God is within you'...\\" (¬ß 29). This is a reference to . * \\"The 'kingdom of Heaven' is a condition of the heart...\\" (¬ß 34). * \\"The 'kingdom of God' is not something one waits for; it has no yesterday or tomorrow, it does not come 'in a thousand years' ‚Äî it is an experience within a heart...\\" (¬ß 34). * \\"His words to the thief on the cross contain the whole Evangel. 'That was verily a divine man, a child of God' ‚Äî says the thief. 'If thou feelest this' ‚Äî answers the redeemer ‚Äî ' thou art in Paradise...'\\" (¬ß 35). In order to accomplish this goal, Nietzsche parodied a passage from the New Testament, which the Nietzsche Archive, headed by Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche, decided to suppress so that there would be no doubt as to the strict correctness of Nietzsche's use of the Bible.From the English translation of The Antichrist as shown on The Nietzsche Channel: \\"Nietzsche refers to the conversion of one of the two thieves crucified with Jesus, which is only reported in the tale of suffering\\" by Luke (23: 39-43; cf. Matthew 27:44; Mark 15:31-32). \\"However, the words which Nietzsche puts into the mouth of the thief are those of the captain after Christ's death\\" (cf. Luke 23:47; Matthew. 27:54; Mark 15:39). \\"Perhaps the Nietzsche-Archive didn't want to see the 'cohesiveness of the Bible' disputed by Nietzsche, hence the suppression of this part\\" (cf. Hofmiller, Josef. November 1931. Nietzsche, 'S√ºddeutsche Monatshefte'. p. 94ff). According to Nietzsche, one of the thieves, who was also being crucified, said, \\"This was truly a divine man, a child of God!\\"Rempel, Morgan. 2006. \\"Nietzsche on the Deaths of Socrates and Jesus.\\" Minerva 10:245‚Äì66. . Archived from the original on 2008-02-27. Retrieved 27 May 2020. Nietzsche had Christ reply, \\"If you feel this, you are in Paradise, you are a child of God.\\"Nietzsche, Friedrich. [1901] 1968. Will to Power, edited by Walter Kaufmann. Vintage Books. ¬ß162: > \\"When even the criminal undergoing a painful death declares: 'the way this > Jesus suffers and dies, without rebelling, without enmity, graciously, > resignedly, is the only right way,' he has affirmed the gospel: and with > that he is in Paradise‚Äî\\" In the Bible, only Luke related a dialogue between Christ and the thief in which the thief said, \\"This man has done nothing wrong\\" to which, Christ replies, \\"Today I tell you, you will be with me in Paradise.\\" Nietzsche had the thief speaking the words that the centurion later spoke in Luke 23:47, Matthew 27:54, and Mark 15:39. In these passages, Christ was called the 'Son of God' by the soldier. The Nietzsche Archives' suppression was lifted in later editions and now appears exactly as Nietzsche wrote.Kaufmann, Walter. 1974. Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist (4th ed.). Princeton: Princeton University Press. pg. 7: \\"... in 1888, Nietzsche had abandoned the entire project of The Will to Power. Some previous drafts had called for the subtitle, \\"Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values\\"; and Nietzsche, who now proposed to write a different magnum opus, decided on the title Revaluation of All Values‚Äîand actually finished the first quarter: the Antichrist... Moreover, the Antichrist, however provocative, represents a more single-minded and sustained inquiry than any of Nietzsche's other books and thus suggests that the major work of which it constitutes Part I was not meant to consist of that maze of incoherent, if extremely interesting, observations which have since been represented as his crowning achievement [i.e., The Will to Power.]\\"The Antichrist, \\"Translator's Note.\\" Penguin Books. 1990. \\"...omissions from the [1895] text were subsequently published and are restored in Karl Schlechta's edition (Werke in drei B√§nden, vol. II, 1955).\\" The full passage reads: =A young prince= In ¬ß 38, there is a reference to a young prince who professes to be a Christian but acts in a very worldly manner. The passage about this was suppressed in order to avoid comparison to Wilhelm II. According to Mazzino Montinari, this passage was never printed in any edition prepared by the Nietzsche Archive. However, it did appear in the pocketbook edition of 1906. The full passage reads: =Anno Domini= Nietzsche, in ¬ß 62, criticizes the reckoning of time from Christ's birth (anno Domini). This passage was judged by Franz Overbeck and Heinrich K√∂selitz to be unworthy of publication. According to Mazzino Montinari, this passage was restored in the 1899 edition, appearing in all subsequent editions. The full passage reads: =Decree against Christianity= Also suppressed was Nietzsche's \\"Decree against Christianity,\\" which consists of seven propositions: # Every type of anti-nature is depraved (e.g. original Sin). # Participation in religion is an assassination attempt on public morality (e.g. Just war theory). # Sacred (earthly) things which Christianity has deified should be eradicated (e.g. sacred sites and rituals). # The Christian teaching on chastity is a public instigation to anti-nature (e.g. Christian modesty). # The Christian priest is a chandala - he should be ostracized, starved for preferring discourse and declining food at a banquet (e.g. the sacrifice of fasting). # This is the transvaluation of values in which the divine becomes criminal, etc. # Christian religion (rather than Christian philosophy) is the ultimate evil (as explained above in this article).

She wrote two memoirs about their lives together and the repressive Stalinist regime: Hope Against Hope (1970) and Hope Abandoned (1974), both first published in the West in English, translated by Max Hayward. Of these books the critic Clive James wrote, \\"Hope Against Hope puts her at the centre of the liberal resistance under the Soviet Union. A masterpiece of prose as well as a model of biographical narrative and social analysis it is mainly the story of the terrible last years of persecution and torment before the poet [her husband Osip] was murdered. The sequel, Hope Abandoned, is about the author's personal fate, and is in some ways even more terrible, because, as the title implies, it is more about horror as a way of life than as an interruption to normal expectancy. [The two books] were key chapters in the new bible that the twentieth century had written for us.\\" Clive James, Cultural Amnesia, pp. 414-415 Early life and education Nadezhda Yakovlevna Khazina was born in Saratov, southern Russia, the youngest of four children (she had an older sister and two older brothers) of a middle- class Jewish family. Her parents were Yakov Arkadyevich Khazin and Vera Yakovlevna Khazina, and the family was wealthy enough to travel. Her mother was among the first group of women in the Soviet Union to complete training as a medical doctor, and her father was an attorney. The family did not practice Judaism, and kept Russian Orthodox holidays. Later they converted to Christianity.Holmgren, 1993, pp. 99-101 The family moved to Kiev, Ukraine, for her father's work, and the greater cultural and educational opportunities of the larger city. There she attended school. After gymnasium (secondary school), Nadezhda studied art. Career Nadezhda met the poet Osip Mandelstam at a nightclub in Kiev in 1919,Holmgren, pp. 104-105 and they started a relationship which led to marriage in 1921‚Äì1922. They lived in Ukraine at first, but moved to Petrograd in 1922. Later they lived in Moscow, and Georgia. Osip was arrested in 1934 for his poem entitled \\"Stalin Epigram\\" and exiled to Cherdyn, in Perm Oblast; Nadezhda went with him. Later the sentence was lightened and they were allowed to move to Voronezh in southwestern Russia, but were still banished from the largest cities, which were the artistic and cultural centers. After Osip Mandelstam's second arrest in May 1938 and his subsequent death at the transit camp \\"Vtoraya Rechka\\" near Vladivostok that year, Nadezhda Mandelstam led an almost nomadic life. Given the repression of the times, she tried to dodge an expected arrest, and frequently changed places of residence and took only temporary jobs. On at least one occasion, in Kalinin, the NKVD came for her the day after she had fled. As her mission in life, she worked to preserve her husband's poetic heritage, with the goal of publication one day. She managed to keep most of it memorized because she did not trust paper. Many years later, she was able to work with other writers to have it published. Through the terrible years, Nadezhda Mandelstam gained her college degree and taught English in various provincial towns. After the death of Joseph Stalin on 5 March 1953, when government's repression eased, she returned to her studies and completed her dissertation in linguistics (1956).Beth Holmgren, Women's Works in Stalin's Time: On Lidiia Chukovskaia and Nadezhda Mandelstam, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1993, p. 115, accessed 8 Nov 2010 She was not allowed to return to Moscow until 1964, following the first phase of Osip Mandelstam's rehabilitation (under Nikita Khrushchev). She had spent 20 years in a kind of internal exile until the \\"thaws\\" of the late 1950s. Nadezhda began writing her memoir, which was published in English as Hope Against Hope in 1970, in part as a way of restoring her husband's memory and integrating her own struggles. It first circulated in a samizdat version in the Soviet Union in the 1960s.Holmgren, p. 114 In her memoirs, Hope Against Hope (1970, 1977) and Hope Abandoned (1974, 1981), first published in the West, she made an epic analysis of her husband's life and times. She elevated her husband as the figure of an artistic martyr under Stalin's repressive regime.Holmgren, p. 124 She criticized the moral and cultural degradation of the Soviet Union of the 1920s and later. The titles of her memoirs are puns, as nadezhda in Russian means \\"hope\\". In 1976, Mandelstam gave her archives to Princeton University in the United States.

Starkad (Old Norse: Starka√∞r or St√∂rku√∞r;The article Starkad in Nordisk familjebok (1909). Latin: Starcaterus; in the Late Middle Ages also Starkodder; modern Danish: St√¶rkodder)The article Starkad in Nationalencyklopedin. was either an eight- armed giant or the human grandson of the aforementioned giant in Norse mythology. Starkad appears in numerous accounts, and the stories of his adventures relate to different Scandinavian traditions. He is most fully treated in Gesta Danorum but he also appears in Icelandic sources. He is portrayed as a great warrior who performed many heroic deeds but also many crimes. A cognate of the Starkad legends can be found in the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf.Andersson, Ingvar. (1947). Sk√•nes historia: till Saxo och Sk√•nelagen. Norstedts, Stockholm. p. 210. Beowulf In Beowulf, the feud between the Danes and the Hea√∞obards was to be ended with the marriage of Ingeld, the son of the fallen Hea√∞obard king Froda, and Freawaru, the daughter of the Danish king Hro√∞gar. During the wedding an unnamed old warrior reminded the Hea√∞obards of their defeat and encouraged them to revenge.Lines 2042-2067. That is the origin of Starkad's admonishing speech to the Danish king Ingellus, son of Frotho (see the account given in Gesta Danorum below). Sophus Bugge derived the name Starka√∞r from originally meaning \\"the strong Hea√∞obard\\". Modern research is more reluctant, however, as the Gothic root stark- ('strong') might be connected with several possible suffixes.Nicoletta Francovic Onesti, 'Interaction of Germanic Personal Names with Latin Onomastics in the Late-Roman West', in: Michael Borgolte et al. (eds.), Europa im Geflecht der Welt: Mittelalterliche Migrationen in globalen Bez√ºgen, p. 55-73, 63. Hervarar saga A version of the legend of Starkad can be found in the prologue of the U-version of Hervarar saga, and in a shortened form in the H-version of the Hauksb√≥k.See Tunstall's comments on his translation of the Hervarar saga at Northvegr.. In this version a Starkad Ala-Warrior lived in northern Norway at the waterfalls of Alufoss. He descended from the giants known as the √æursar (jotuns), and his father's name was Storkvid. Starkad was very much a jotun himself and had eight arms, but he was betrothed to a girl named Ogn Elf-burst. One day, when Starkad had gone north across the √âliv√°gar, another giant named Hergrim kidnapped Ogn. Starkad challenged Hergrim to a holmgang, a duel. Starkad used four swords at the same time and slew Hergrim. Ogn did not wish to be Starkad's wife and committed suicide by stabbing herself with a sword. Starkad contented himself by taking everything Hergrim owned, including his son Grimr. √Ålfhildr was the daughter of king √Ålfr of √Ålfheim (modern Bohusl√§n) and like the people of √Ålfheim, she was very beautiful.The beauty of her people is explained in √ûorsteins saga V√≠kingssonar as due to the fact that her people were related to the elves. One autumn, king √Ålfr performed the D√≠sabl√≥t, a sacrifice to the goddesses, and √Ålfhildr took part in it. As she was reddening the horgr (altar) with blood, Starkad kidnapped her. King √Ålfr called on the god Thor to help him rescue his daughter. Thor granted his wish by killing Starkad and rescuing the girl.  Gautreks saga  The hero Starkad, from Olaus Magnus' Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (1555). Gautreks saga continues the account found in Hervarar saga. It is tells among other things the adventures of Starkad, the son of St√≥rvirkr who was the son of Starkad Ala-warrior, whom Thor had killed. It tells that young Starkad was raised at the court of Harald, the king of Agder, together with Harald's son Vikar. One day, Her√æj√≥fr,Her√æj√≥fr was the son of Hun√æj√≥fr, the son of Fri√∞√æj√≥fr the Bold, the protagonist of Fridthj√≥fs saga ins fr√¶kna. the king of Hordaland, made a raid and killed king Harald. He also took Vikar hostage to ensure the loyalty of the people of Agder. When Vikar had grown up, he assembled a warband, including Starkad and avenged his father by killing Her√æj√≥fr with thirty of his warriors. Vikar was then king of Agder, Hordaland, and Hardanger. Starkad took part in V√≠kar's many battles for the hegemony of the petty kingdoms of southern Norway, one of the battles where Battle at Lake V√¶nir and he was V√≠kar's greatest warrior. After all these victories, when sailing north from Agdir to H√∂rdaland with a large army, V√≠kar was becalmed. Divination showed Odin required a sacrifice of one person chosen by lot and V√≠kar's lot came up each time. The decision was put off till the next day. Then Grani Horsehair, Starkad's foster father, took Starkad to a secret council of the gods and revealed himself to be Odin. Odin bestowed on Starkad the blessings of living three lifetimes, of possessing the most excellent of weapons, an abundance of riches, victory in battle, the gift of poetry and always to be held in the highest esteem among the rich and powerful. Thor, however, who hated Starkad because of his jotun origin, denied Starkad the blessing of having children and cursed him to commit a crime every lifetime he lived and never to possess real estate. Thor further cursed Starkad never to feel that he had enough property, always to receive dangerous wounds in battle, never to remember his skaldic poems and ever to be hated by commoners. After blessings and curses laid on Starkad alternately by Odin and Thor, Odin asked Starkad to send him King V√≠kar in payment for Odin's blessings. Starkad agreed and Odin gave Starkad a spear which Odin promised would appear to be only a reed-stalk. So Vikar met his death. After Vikar's death, Starkad fled to Sweden and the kings Alrek and Eir√≠k at Uppsala. Starkad served them first as a companion on their viking expeditions and then, after Alrek and Eir√≠k had settled down, he went on further Viking expeditions alone. Skaldic poetry Starkad is said to have composed poems himself which appear in Gautrek's saga. Thor's hate of Starkad because of his jotun origins is mentioned in Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, where there is a lausav√≠sa by Vetrli√∞i Sumarli√∞ason praising Thor for having killed giants and giantesses, and for having defeated Starkad: {  :Leggi brauzt √æ√∫ Leiknar, :lam√∞ir √ûr√≠valda, :steyp√∞ir Starke√∞i, :st√©ttu of Gjalp dau√∞a.Sk√°ldskaparm√°l in Old Norse at ¬´Norr√∏ne Tekster og Kvad¬ª, Norway.  :Thou didst break the leg of Leikn, :Didst bruise Thr√≠valdi, :Didst cause to stoop Starkadr, :Didst stand on lifeless Gj√°lp.Brodeur's translation  :You broke Leikn's bones, :you pounded Thrivaldi :you cast down Starkad, :you stood over the dead Gialp.Faulke's translation  } However, it could also be a reference to Starkad's grandfather, Starkad Ala-Warrior, whom Thor killed for having kidnapped √Ålfhildr, the princess of Alfheim. Ynglinga saga In the Ynglinga saga, Snorri Sturluson tells what happened a few generations after the deaths of Alrek and Eir√≠k. The Swedish king Aun was not a warlike king and had been chased away from his kingdom by Halfdan. When Halfdan had died, Aun returned to Uppsala to rule his old kingdom. After having sacrificed one of his sons to Odin, the god let him live for another sixty years. However, when twenty-five years had passed, a Danish prince named √Åli the Bold appeared and chased Aun to exile in G√∂taland. √Åli ruled for twenty-five years until Starkad appeared and killed him. Then Aun could return to his kingdom and ruled it for another period of twenty-five years. S√∂gubrot Starkad leads Geats (the banner with a lion) and Swedes (the banner with three crowns) in battle against the Danes, from Olaus Magnus' Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (1555). The S√∂gubrot deals with events taking place in the 8th century, a long time after Starkad killed √Åli the Bold. When the Swedish king Sigurd Hring prepared for the Battle of the Br√°vellir against the Danish Harald Wartooth, a much later king √Åli the Bold appeared with seven other kings to help him in the battle. These kings were accompanied by a great many champions, and among them Starkad the Old, the son of St√≥rverkr. Starkad would later compose a poem about this battle that would serve as a source for the sagas. When the battle had begun, a formidable champion named Ubbi of Friesland charged against Ragnvald the Good Councilor the foremost champion in the wedge formation of king Sigurd. After a fierce fight, Ragnvald died and Ubbi pushed on killing champion after champion. When king Sigurd Hring saw this he encouraged his warriors and said that it was not possible that no one could defeat Ubbi. He then asked \\"where is Starkad?\\". The old warrior answered \\"it is difficult to win sire. However, I will do my best and do what I can, but Ubbi is a tough fighter\\". Starkad engaged with Ubbi and a fight began that was long and the most fierce of the entire battle. Eventually, Starkad gave Ubbi a single wound, but Starkad had received six big ones, and thought that no one had been closer to kill him before. The two champions were separated by the pushing throng of warriors, and Ubbi finally fell riddled with arrows from the archers of Telemark. The shieldmaiden Vebiorg took on the Swedish army. First she killed the champion S√∂ti, but then Starkad attacked her. After giving Vebiorg a number of slashes, she cut his mouth so that his chin fell. Starkad had to bite his beard to keep his chin in place. She was killed by Thorkil the Bold. Biting his beard and ignoring his wounds, Starkad charged the Danish army, killing man after man, until he met the shieldmaiden Ursina who carried the banner of king Harald Wartooth. She told him that he had met his last opponent, but he cut off the hand that held the banner and killed her. Starkad continued killing warrior after warrior, until he finally was so severely wounded that he had a large gash on his neck and a large gash on his chest that made his two lungs hang out. On his right hand, he had lost a finger. The battle ended with Swedish victory. Norna-Gests √æ√°ttr In Norna-Gests √æ√°ttr, the account of Starkad takes place not long after the victory at the Battle of the Br√°vellir. The account deals with a meeting between Starkad and the hero Sigurd Dragonslayer. The old Norna-Gest told that during the time when he was with Sigurd Dragonslayer, the Swedish king Sigurd Hring demanded tribute from Sigurd and his people. When Sigurd refused, the king of Sweden sent an army to subdue him, led by the sons of Gandalf. In the Swedish army, there was a man who was even bigger and stronger than the sons of Gandalf. The giant man killed both men and horses and nothing could defeat him. Sigurd and Gest approached the huge warrior and asked who he was. He answered that he was Starkad the son of St√≥rvirkr. When Starkad learnt that Sigurd was the same Sigurd who had killed the dragon Fafnir, he tried to escape. However, Sigurd went after him and dealt a blow with his sword Gramr that ripped two teeth off Starkad's mouth. Sigurd then asked Starkad to go home. When Starkad had left the battle, the sons of Gandalf retired as well, and so Sigurd had won the battle against the Swedes. Gesta Danorum Starkad in battle, from Olaus Magnus' Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (1555). It is in Gesta Danorum that the most comprehensive treatment of Starkad is found. The Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus wrote that Starkad was the son of St√≥rvirkr (Storwerk/Storuerkus) and saved himself from a shipwreck. He entered the service of the Danish king Frotho and was given a ship so that he could patrol the shores. No man was Starkad's equal as he was endowed with a superhuman size and a noble disposition. Saxo Grammaticus gives two accounts of Starkad's origin. According to one, he was born in the land of Estonians east of the Baltic sea. According to the second, which the chronicler considers fantastic and unlikely, Starkad was born of jotuns, and he had formerly many arms until Thor cut off all arms but two. Odin had bestowed on Starkad the curse and the blessing that he would live the lives of three men, and commit three evil deeds. His first evil deed was the murder of the Norwegian petty king Vikar (Wicarus). Starkad had joined a Viking expedition with Vikar, but they found themselves stopped by a strong wind. They then had the idea that they could appease the gods by performing a bl√≥t with human blood, and decided to cast lots as to whom was to be sacrificed. Starkad made a noose of willow and put it around the king's neck in the pretense that it was only for show and not for killing. However, the knot was so strong that the king was dying, and Starkad gave him the coup de grace with his sword. Others say that the noose of willow suddenly became so strong that the king was strangled. Starkad joined the Danish Viking Bemon (Bemonus) and they had a tough discipline on their crew, forbidding them alcoholic beverages. During an attack in Russia, they discovered that the Russians had riddled the terrain with caltrops to stop the Vikings. However, Starkad and his men donned clogs and so won the battle. When Bemon was dead, Starkad entered the service of the Bjarmians and did many heroic deeds among them. Later, Starkad stayed for seven years in Sweden at Uppsala, with the sons of Frey. However the effeminate jingle of bells, the dancing and the mimes at the sacrifices (see the Temple at Uppsala) nauseated Starkad. He then enlisted with the Danish king Haki (Haco), and fought for him during the attack on king Hugleik (Hugletus) of Ireland. Hugleik wasted his riches on actors and jugglers, but was defended by Svipdag (Suibdagus) and Geigad (Gegathus), who gave Starkad the most vicious wound he had ever received. After winning the battle, Starkad had all the mimes and jugglers flogged, and all the riches looted. Starkad was then sent with the Slavic prince Win (Winus) to quell a rebellion in the East. He fought against Curonians, Sambians, Semigallians, until all the Easterlings had been defeated. By covering his sword with a hide, he also defeated a warlord named Wisin (Wisinnus), who lived at Anafial in Russia, and who could make a weapon blunt only by looking at it. He continued his victories by killing the jotun Tanna in Byzantium and the Polish champion Wasce/Wilzce. When the Saxons rebelled against Frotho, and challenged him to a duel against Hama, Starkad unexpectedly returned and took Frotho's place in the duel. Hama contemptuously brought Starkad to his knees with a blow by his fist, but Starkad rose up and cut Hama to death. Starkad meets Ingellus with a mistress, from Olaus Magnus' Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (1555). After a while Frotho was killed through treachery by a Saxon named Swerting (Swertingus). Frotho's son Ingild (Ingellus) lived a wanton life and married one of Swerting's daughters. This angered Starkad so much that he enlisted at the Swedish king Halfdan's (Haldanus) court instead. However, when he learnt that Helga, Ingild's sister, was about to marry a lowly goldsmith, Starkad appeared in disguise and castrated the goldsmith. He gave Helga a slap on her face and lambasted her. Then he returned to Sweden and king Halfdan. Ingild gave Helga to a Norwegian named Helgi (Helgo), on the condition that he fight nine brothers from Zealand who courted her, and among whom the eldest was named Angantyr (Angaterus). Helgi went to Sweden's most famous city Uppsala and asked Starkad to help him in the fight. Starkad agreed, but left Helgi with his bride in order to fight with the nine brothers himself at the moor of Roliung. Starkad leads those oppressed by the nine brothers, from Olaus Magnus' Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (1555). Starkad killed the nine brothers but had received seventeen wounds himself, and was so seriously wounded that his guts hung out. He refused the care of three lowly passers-by, but accepted the treatment of a peasant's son, and could return to Sweden. As Ingild continued his sinful life and did not do his duty to avenge his father, Starkad appeared during a banquet that Ingild had with the sons of Swerting, his father's slayer. Starkad strongly admonished Ingild and humiliated his queen who tried to calm Starkad with kindness and her costly ribbon. Starkad succeeded in exciting Ingild to kill Swerting's sons and to divorce his Saxon bride. During the Battle of the Br√°vellir between the Swedish king Sigurd Hring and Harald Wartooth (Haraldus Hyldetan), Starkad fought on the Swedish side. He received such a severe wound that his lung hung out, his skull was cleft and a finger was cut off. He had to leave the battle to tend to his wounds. Starkad was accepted with honour in the warband of the Norwegian hero Olo. However, when Olo had succeeded in conquering Zealand, Starkad was convinced to join Lennius/Lenus/Lennus scheme to attack and kill Olo. However, Olo was hard to kill as his gaze scared everyone. It was not until Starkad managed to cover Olo's face that he could kill him. Starkad was rewarded with 120 pounds in gold, but regretted his crime, and avenged Olo's death by killing Lennius. Starkad arranges his own demise, from Olaus Magnus' Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (1555). When Starkad was so old that he wished to die and his eyesight was bad, he hung his gold around his neck and went out to wander. He killed a man who wanted one of his swords and some riders who were contracted to kill Starkad by Hather (Hatherus), Lennius' son. In front of Hather, Starkad sung about his accomplishments, and as Hather's response showed Starkad that Hather was of noble birth, Starkad asked him to be his slayer. Starkad promised Hather all his gold and imperviousness, should Hather cut off his head and run between the head and the body as he fell. Hather cut off Starkad's head but avoided running, as he feared being crushed by Starkad's huge body. When the head had hit the ground, it bit a tussock of grass which showed how ferocious Starkad was. Hather did not want the old warrior to lie unburied, but showed him respect by making a barrow for him on the heath of Roljung, at the same spot where Starkad's heavy body long ago had made an imprint on a stone. Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus Olaus Magnus' cites the story of Starkad from Gesta Danorum. He disputes Saxo about origin of the hero and informs that Starkad was from the nation of Tavastians, 'Starchaterum Thauestum'.Magni Gothus, Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus. Epitome libri V. gap. 3 Later traditions Later medieval traditions locate Starkad's death and the heath of Roljung to Sk√•ne. According to the Annales Ryenses (late 13th century), it was still possible to see Starkad's sword in the water beneath the bridge of Boilyngh when the water was low.Andersson, Ingvar. (1947). Sk√•nes historia: till Saxo och Sk√•nelagen. Norstedts, Stockholm. p. 213. It is likely that Boilyngh is a misspelling of Roljung. Later this spot was located to R√∂nne river, and in the 16th century, people talked of the Stones of Starkkarl at Vegeholm. The Danish folklorist Axel Olrik and Arthur Stille recorded many recent traditions about Starkad in north-western Sk√•ne. Modern references The plot of the Science Fiction novel \\"Ensign Flandry\\" by the Danish American writer Poul Anderson takes place on a planet named \\"Starkad\\". The modern Danish name, St√¶rkodder has been used for a war ship in the Royal Danish Navy. Starkad (or \\"Starkadder\\") is the central figure in a trilogy of fantasy novels by the author Bernard King, which draw heavily from traditional Starkad stories and from other aspects of Norse myth and legend. The trilogy comprises the novels \\"Starkadder\\" (1985), \\"Vargr-Moon\\" (1986), and \\"Death-Blinder\\" (1988). Starkad, as Starka√∞r the Mighty, is mentioned in the 2018 videogame God of War, as a late Jotunn enshrined by the Jotnar people. Mimir relates how Thor killed him by ripping off six of his arms.

The purpose was to test the Beaupre multi-stage parachute system intended to be used by pilots ejecting from high altitude. In one of these jumps Kittinger set world records for the longest parachute drogue fall, the highest parachute jump, and the fastest speed by a human through the atmosphere. He held the latter two of these records for 52 years, until they were broken by Felix Baumgartner of the Red Bull Stratos project in 2012, though he still holds the world record for longest time in free fall. Background As jet planes flew higher and faster in the 1950s, the Air Force became increasingly worried about the safety of flight crews who had to eject at high altitude. Tests in Operation High Dive with dummies had shown that a body in free-fall at high altitude would often go into a flat spin at a rate of up to 200 revolutions per minute (about 3.3 revolutions per second). This would be potentially fatal. Project Excelsior was initiated in 1958 to design a parachute system that would allow a safe, controlled descent after a high-altitude ejection. Francis Beaupre, a technician at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, devised a multi-stage parachute system to facilitate manned tests. This consisted of a small stabilizer or \\"drogue\\" parachute, designed to prevent uncontrolled spinning at high altitudes, and a main parachute that deployed at a lower altitude. The system included timers and altitude sensors that would automatically deploy both parachutes at the correct points in the descent, even if the parachutist were unconscious or disabled. To test the parachute system, staff at Wright Field built a high helium balloon with a capacity of nearly that could lift an open gondola and test pilot into the stratosphere. Captain Joseph Kittinger, who was test director for the project, made three ascents and test jumps. As the gondola was unpressurized, Kittinger wore a modified David Clark MC-3A partial pressure suit during these tests, plus additional layers of clothing to protect him from the extreme cold at high altitude. Together with the parachute system, this almost doubled his weight. Test jumps The first test, Excelsior I, was made on November 16, 1959. Kittinger ascended in the gondola and jumped from an altitude of . In this first test, the stabilizer parachute was deployed too soon, catching Kittinger around the neck and causing him to spin at 120 revolutions per minute. This caused Kittinger to lose consciousness, but his life was saved by his main parachute which opened automatically at a height of . Despite this near- disaster on the first test, Kittinger went ahead with another test only three weeks later. The second test, Excelsior II, was made on December 11, 1959. This time, Kittinger jumped from an altitude of and descended in free-fall for before opening his main parachute. The third and final test, Excelsior III, was made on August 16, 1960. During the ascent, the pressure seal in Kittinger's right glove failed, and he began to experience severe pain in his right hand from the exposure of his hand to the extreme low pressure. (See Space exposure.) He decided not to inform the ground crew about this, in case they should decide to abort the test. Despite temporarily losing the use of his right hand, he continued with the ascent, climbing to an altitude of . The ascent took one hour and 31 minutes and broke the previous manned balloon altitude record of , which was set by Major David Simons as part of Project Manhigh in 1957. Kittinger stayed at peak altitude for 12 minutes, waiting for the balloon to drift over the landing target area. He then stepped out of the gondola to begin his descent. The small stabilizer parachute deployed successfully and Kittinger fell for 4 minutes and 36 seconds, setting a long- standing world record for the longest free-fall. During the descent, Kittinger experienced temperatures as low as . In the free-fall stage, he reached a top speed of . At an altitude of , Kittinger opened his main parachute and landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The whole descent took 13 minutes and 45 seconds and set a world record for the highest parachute jump. A plaque attached below the open door of the Excelsior III gondola read, \\"This is the highest step in the world\\". Kittinger held the world records for highest parachute jump and highest speed of a human in atmosphere until October 14, 2012 when Felix Baumgartner jumped from and reaching a speed of 377.12 m/s as part of the Red Bull Stratos project, with Kittinger serving as a technical advisor to Baumgartner. Kittinger does, however, still hold the records for longest drogue fall and longest freefall. File:Joseph Kittinger and the Excelsior gondola.jpgJoseph Kittinger next to the Excelsior gondola.

Kittinger's efforts during Project Excelsior proved that it was possible for an air crew to descend safely after ejecting at high altitudes. President Dwight D. Eisenhower awarded Kittinger the C. B. Harmon Trophy for his work on Excelsior. Kittinger also received an oak leaf cluster to the Distinguished Flying Cross, the J.J. Jeffries Award, the A.

It is one of Saramago's most famous novels, along with The Gospel According to Jesus Christ and Baltasar and Blimunda. In 1998, Saramago received the Nobel Prize for Literature, and Blindness was one of his works noted by the committee when announcing the award. Plot summary Blindness is the story of an unexplained mass epidemic of blindness afflicting nearly everyone in an unnamed city, and the social breakdown that swiftly follows. The novel follows the misfortune of a handful of unnamed characters who are among the first to be stricken with blindness, including \\"the doctor's wife\\", her husband, several of his patients, and assorted others, who are thrown together by chance. After a lengthy and traumatic quarantine in an asylum, the group bands together in a family-like unit to survive by their wits and by the unexplained good fortune that the doctor's wife has escaped the blindness. The sudden onset and unexplained origin and nature of the blindness cause widespread panic, and the social order rapidly unravels as the government attempts to contain the apparent contagion and keep order via increasingly repressive and inept measures. The first part of the novel follows the experiences of the central characters in the filthy, overcrowded asylum where they and other blind people have been quarantined. Hygiene, living conditions, and morale degrade horrifically in a very short period, mirroring the society outside. Anxiety over the availability of food, caused by delivery irregularities, acts to undermine solidarity; and lack of organization prevents the internees from fairly distributing food or chores. Soldiers assigned to guard the asylum and look after the well-being of the internees become increasingly antipathetic as one soldier after another becomes infected. The military refuses to allow basic medicine to be delivered, which ensures that a simple infection becomes deadly. Fearing an imminent escape, soldiers shoot down a crowd of internees waiting for a food delivery. Conditions degenerate further as an armed clique gains control over food deliveries, subjugating their fellow internees and exposing them to violent assault, rape, and deprivation. Faced with starvation, internees battle each other and burn down the asylum, only to discover that the army has abandoned the asylum, after which the protagonists join the throngs of nearly helpless blind people outside who wander the devastated city and fight one another to survive. The story then follows the doctor's wife, her husband, and their impromptu ‚Äúfamily‚Äù as they attempt to survive outside, cared for largely by the doctor‚Äôs wife, who can still see (though she must hide this fact at first). At this point, the breakdown of society is near total. Law and order, social services, government, schools, etc., no longer function. Families have been separated and cannot find one another. People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food. Violence, disease, and despair threaten to overwhelm human coping. The doctor and his wife and their new ‚Äúfamily‚Äù eventually make a permanent home in the doctor's house and are establishing a new order to their lives when the blindness lifts from the city en masse just as suddenly and inexplicably as it struck.  Characters  = The doctor's wife= The doctor's wife is the only character in the novel who does not lose her sight. This phenomenon remains unexplained through the novel. Unwilling to leave her husband to be interned, she lies to the government doctors and claims to be blind. As such, she is interned with the rest of the afflicted. Once inside, she attempts to help the compound organize, but she is increasingly unable to hold back the animality of the compound. When one ward begins withholding food and demanding that the women of other wards submit to being raped in return for food, she kills the leader of their ward. Once they escape the compound, she helps her group survive in the city. The doctor's wife is the de facto leader of their small group, although in the end, she often serves their disabled needs and acts as a nurse to them. = The doctor= The doctor is an ophthalmologist stricken blind after treating a patient with what will come to be called \\"the white sickness\\". The doctor is among the first to be quarantined along with his wife. Due to his medical expertise he has a certain authority among those quarantined. Though, much of the doctor's authority stems from his wife not having gone blind; she is able to see what is going on around the ward and relays what she sees to her husband. When the group from his ward finally escapes they end up travelling to and staying in the doctor and his wife's apartment. Several of the other main characters had been visiting the doctor's office when the epidemic begins to spread. = The girl with the dark glasses = The girl with the dark glasses is a former part-time prostitute who is struck blind while she is with a customer. She seemingly contracted the ‚Äúwhite-blindness‚Äù while visiting the doctor due to conjunctivitis (hence the dark glasses). She is unceremoniously removed from the hotel and taken to be quarantined in the asylum. Once inside, she joins the small group of people who were contaminated at the doctor's office. When the car thief gropes her on the way to the lavatory, she kicks him with a heeled shoe ‚Äì giving him a wound from which he will eventually die. While inside, she also takes care of the boy with the squint, whose mother is nowhere to be found. At the end of the story, she and the old man with the black eye patch become lovers. = The old man with the black eye patch = The old man with the black eye patch is the last person to join the first ward. He brings with him a portable transistor radio that allows the internees to listen to the news. He is also the main architect of the failed attack on the ward of hoodlums hoarding the food rations. Once the group escapes the quarantine, the old man becomes the lover of the girl with the dark glasses. = The dog of tears = The dog of tears is a dog that joins the small group of blind people when they leave the quarantine. While he is mostly loyal to the doctor's wife, he helps the whole group by protecting them all from packs of dogs who are becoming increasingly feral. He is called the dog of tears because he bonded to the group when he licked the tears off the face of the doctor's wife. = The boy with the squint = The boy with the squint was a patient of the doctor's, which is most likely how he became infected. He is brought to the quarantine without his mother and soon falls in with the group in the first ward. The girl with the dark glasses assumes a motherly role for him, as she takes care of him and ensures his safety. = The car thief = After the first blind man was struck blind in traffic, a car thief brought him home and, subsequently stole his car. Soon after he went blind, the car thief and the first blind man re-encounter one another in the quarantine, where they soon come to blows. They have no time to resolve their conflict, though, since the car thief is the first internee killed by the guards. He is gunned down while trying to ask the guards for medication for his infected leg. = The first blind man = The first man to go blind is struck blind in the middle of traffic, waiting at a stoplight. He is immediately taken home and then to the doctor's office, where he infects all of the other patients and the doctor. He is one of the principal members of the first ward - the ward with all of the original internees. When the epidemic is finally over, he is the first person to regain his sight. = The first blind man's wife = The wife of the first blind man goes blind soon after helping her husband to the quarantine. They are reunited by chance in the quarantine. Once inside, she also joins the first ward with the doctor and the doctor's wife. When the ward of hoodlums begins to demand that the women sleep with them in order to be fed, the first blind man's wife volunteers to go, in solidarity with the others. = The man with the gun = The man with the gun is the leader of the ward of hoodlums that seizes control of the food supply in the quarantine. He and his ward take the rations by force and threaten to shoot anyone who doesn't comply with their orders. This ward extorts valuables from the other internees in exchange for food and, when the \\"goods\\" (such as bracelets and watches run out) they begin to rape the women. He is later stabbed to death by the doctor's wife. = The blind accountant = This man is not one of those afflicted by the \\"white sickness\\"‚Äîrather he has been blind since birth. He is the only one in the ward who can read and write braille and who knows how to use a walking stick. Additionally, he is the second in command to the man with the gun in the ward of hoodlums. When the doctor's wife kills the man with the gun, the blind accountant takes the gun and tries to seize control but he is unable to rally support. He dies when one of the rape victims sets fire to the ward. Style Like most works by Saramago, Blindness contains many long, breathless passages in which commas take the place of periods, quotation marks, semicolons, and colons. The lack of quotation marks around dialogue means that the speakers' identities (or the fact that dialogue is occurring) may not be immediately apparent to the reader. The lack of proper character names in Blindness is typical of many of Saramago's novels (e.g. All the Names). The characters are instead referred to by descriptive appellations such as \\"the doctor's wife\\", \\"the car thief\\", or \\"the first blind man\\". Given the characters' blindness, some of their names seem ironic (\\"the boy with the squint\\" or \\"the girl with the dark glasses\\"). The city afflicted by the blindness is never named, nor the country specified. Few definite identifiers of culture are given, which contributes an element of timelessness and universality to the novel. Though, there are some signs that hint that the country is Saramago's homeland of Portugal: the main character is shown eating chouri√ßo, a spicy sausage, and some dialogue in the original Portuguese employs the familiar \\"tu\\" second-person singular verb form (a distinction absent in most of Brazil). The church, with all its saintly images, is likely of the Catholic variety. Sequel and adaptation Saramago wrote a sequel to Blindness in 2004, titled Seeing (Ensaio sobre a lucidez, literal English translation Essay on lucidity), which has also been translated into English. The sequel novel takes place in the same country featured in Blindness and features several of the same nameless characters. An English-language film adaptation of Blindness was directed by Fernando Meirelles. Filming began in July 2007 and stars Mark Ruffalo as the doctor and Julianne Moore as the doctor's wife. The film opened the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. In 2007 the Drama Desk Award Winning Godlight Theatre Company staged the New York City theatrical premiere of Blindness http://m.theepochtimes.com/news/7-4-6/53764.html at 59E59 Theaters. This stage version was adapted and directed by Joe Tantalo. The First Blind Man was played by Mike Roche. An outdoor performance adaptation by the Polish group Teatr KTO, was first presented in June 2010. It has since been performed at a number of venues, including the Old College Quad of the University of Edinburgh during the 2012 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Shortly before his death, Saramago gave German composer Anno Schreier the rights to compose an opera based on the novel. The libretto is written in German by Kerstin Maria P√∂hler. Like the German translation of the novel, the opera's title is \\"Die Stadt der Blinden\\". It saw its first performance on November 12, 2011 at the Zurich Opera House. In August 2020, the Donmar Warehouse produced a socially- distanced sound installation based on the novel. BLINDNESS was adapted by Simon Stephens and directed by Walter Meierjohann. Juliet Stevenson voiced the Doctor's Wife.

LVTP-7)‚Äîis a fully tracked amphibious landing vehicle manufactured by U.S. Combat Systems (previously by United Defense, a former division of FMC Corporation). The AAV-P7/A1 is the current amphibious troop transport of the United States Marine Corps. It is used by U.S. Marine Corps Assault Amphibian Battalions to land the surface assault elements of the landing force and their equipment in a single lift from assault shipping during amphibious operations to inland objectives and to conduct mechanized operations and related combat support in subsequent mechanized operations ashore. It is also operated by other forces. Marines call them \\"amtracs\\", a shortening of their original designation, \\"amphibious tractor\\". In June 2018, the Marine Corps announced they had selected the BAE Systems/Iveco wheeled SuperAV for the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) program to supplement and ultimately replace the AAV. History =Development= A pair of U.S. Marine Corps Assault Amphibious Vehicles emerge from the surf onto the sand of Freshwater Beach, Australia. The one on the left has an applique armor kit installed, the one on the right does not. Marines exit from a U.S. Assault Amphibious Vehicle during a live- fire exercise in Djibouti, Africa, in 2010 The LVTP-7 was first introduced in 1972 as a replacement for the LVTP-5. In 1982, FMC was contracted to conduct the LVTP-7 Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), which converted the LVT-7 vehicles to the improved AAV-7A1 vehicle by adding an improved engine, transmission, and weapons system and improving the overall maintainability of the vehicle. The Cummins VT400 diesel engine replaced the GM 8V53T, and this was driven through FMC's HS-400-3A1 transmission. The hydraulic traverse and elevation of the weapon station was replaced by electric motors, which eliminated the danger from hydraulic fluid fires. The suspension and shock absorbers were strengthened as well. The fuel tank was made safer, and a fuel- burning smoke generator system was added. Eight smoke grenade launchers were also placed around the armament station. The headlight clusters were housed in a square recess instead of the earlier round type. The driver was provided with an improved instrument panel and a night vision device, and a new ventilation system was installed. These upgraded vehicles were originally called LVT-7A1, but the Marine Corps renamed the LVTP-7A1 to AAV-7A1 in 1984. Another improvement was added starting in 1987 in the form of a Cadillac Gage weapon station or Up-Gunned Weapon Station (UGWS) which was armed with both a .50 cal (12.7 mm) M2HB machine gun and a Mk-19 40 mm grenade launcher. Enhanced Applique Armor Kits (EAAK) were developed for the AAV-7A1 in 1989 and fitted by 1993, and the added weight of the new armor necessitated the addition of a bow plane kit when operating afloat. The Assault Amphibian Vehicle Reliability, Availability, Maintainability/Rebuild to Standard (AAV RAM/RS) Program was approved in 1997. It encompassed all AAV systems and components to return the AAV to the original vehicle's performance specifications and ensure acceptable readiness until the EFV should become operational. The program replaced both the AAV engine and suspension with US Army M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV) components modified for the AAV. Ground clearance returned to and the horsepower to ton ratio increased from 13 to 1 to its original 17 to 1. The introduction of the BFV components and the rebuild to standard effort was expected to reduce maintenance costs for the expected remaining life of the AAV through the year 2013. In March 2015, SAIC was awarded a contract to perform an AAV Survivability Upgrade (SU).SAIC Continues into Next Phase of Assault Amphibious Vehicle Survivability Upgrade - PRNewswire.com, 5 March 2015 Marine Corps and SAIC officials unveiled the AAV SU prototype in January 2016, with survivability enhancements including replacing the angled EAAK with 49 advanced buoyant ceramic armor panels, a bonded spall liner, armor-protected external fuel tanks, an aluminum armor underbelly providing Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP)-equivalent blast protection, and blast mitigating seats as well as a more powerful engine, new suspension system, and increased reserve buoyancy.Marines' aging amphibious vehicle fleet to get better armor, more power - MarineCorpstimes.com, 29 January 2016US Marine Corps Shows Off Upgraded Amphib Vehicle - Marine Corps Times (16 March 2016)Marines‚Äô Upgraded AAVs Begin Delivering, Will Comprise One-Third of Lift Need In 2020s - News.USNI.org, 23 March 2016 The AAV SU program was intended to upgrade 392 out of the some 1,000-vehicle fleet to keep them operational through 2035 as the ACV gradually entered service.

From 1982 to 1984, LVTP-7s were deployed with U.S. Marines as part of the multi-national peacekeeping force in Beirut, Lebanon. As Marines became increasingly involved in hostilities, several vehicles sustained minor damage from shrapnel and small arms fire. On October 25, 1983 U.S. Marine LVTP-7s conducted a highly successful amphibious landing on the island of Grenada as part of Operation Urgent Fury. It was heavily used in the 1991 Gulf War and Operation Restore Hope. After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, AAV-7A1s were criticized for providing poor protection for the crew and passengers compared with other vehicles, such as the M2 Bradley. Eight were disabled or destroyed during the Battle of Nasiriyah, where they faced RPG, mortar, tank and artillery fire.

Originally armed with a M85 12.7 mm (.50cal) machine gun. * LVTP-7A1: 1982 upgraded. Renamed to AAVP-7A1 from 1984. ** AAVP-7A1 (Personnel): This is the most common AAV, as it carries a turret equipped with an M2HB .50 caliber heavy machine gun, and a Mk19 40mm automatic grenade launcher. It carries four crew radios as well as the AN/VIC-2 intercom system. It is capable of carrying 25 combat equipped Marines in addition to the crew of 4: driver, crew chief/vehicle commander, gunner, and rear crewman. ** AAVC-7A1 (Command): This vehicle does not have a turret, and much of the cargo space of the vehicle is occupied by communications equipment. This version only has two crew radios, and in addition to the VIC-2, it also carries two VRC-92s, a VRC-89, a PRC-103 UHF radio, a MRC-83 HF radio and the MSQ internetworking system used to control the various radios. This AAV has a crew of 3, and additionally carries 5 radio operators, 3 staff members, and 2 commanding officers. Recently, the C7 has been upgraded to use Harris Falcon II class radios, specifically the PRC-117 for VHF/UHF/SATCOM, and the PRC-150 for HF. ** AAVR-7A1 (Recovery): This vehicle also does not have a turret. The R7 is considered the \\"wrecker\\", as it has a crane as well as most tools and equipment needed for field repairs. It is by far the heaviest of the three, and sits considerably lower in the water. Crew of three, plus the repairmen. Many P7s have been modified to carry the Mk 154 MCLC, or Mine Clearance Line Charge. The MCLC kit can fire three linear demolition charges to breach a lane through a minefield. MCLCs were used in the 1991 Persian Gulf War and again in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. In the 1970s, the US Army used an LVTP-7 as the basis for their Mobile Test Unit (MTU), a ground-based high-energy anti- aircraft laser. After several successful test firings at Redstone Army Arsenal, the laser was reportedly transferred to NASA. * KAAV7A1: KAAV7A1 amphibious vehicle series based on AAV-7A1 by Samsung Techwin (now Hanwha Defense) and BAE systems developed and manufactured in South Korea by Samsung Techwin.

Early in his coaching career he developed the Romanian centralised training system for gymnastics. One of his earliest prot√©g√©s was Nadia ComƒÉneci, the first Olympic Games gymnast to be awarded a perfect score. Living under the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu, K√°rolyi frequently clashed with Romanian officials. He and his wife defected to the United States in 1981. Since their arrival in the United States, B√©la and his wife M√°rta K√°rolyi have been credited with transforming the coaching of gymnastics in the US and bringing major international success. They have both been head coach of the United States women's national gymnastics team, as well as national team coordinator for United States gymnastics at the Olympic Games. K√°rolyi has coached many notable national, European, World and Olympic gymnasts, including Nadia ComƒÉneci, Ecaterina Szabo, Mary Lou Retton, Betty Okino, Teodora Ungureanu, Kim Zmeskal, Kristie Phillips, Dominique Moceanu, Phoebe Mills, and Kerri Strug. In total, K√°rolyi has coached nine Olympic champions, fifteen world champions, sixteen European medalists, and six U.S. national champions. B√©la K√°rolyi was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1997. B√©la and M√°rta K√°rolyi as a coaching team were inducted into the US Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2000. Early coaching career Left-right: Ungureanu, K√°rolyi, ComƒÉneci K√°rolyi was born in Kolozsv√°r, Hungary (now Cluj- Napoca, Romania).Cf. Northern Transylvania and Cluj-Napoca articles for precise history and further citations Skilled as an athlete, he became a national junior boxing champion and a member of the Romanian hammer throwing team.Rendell, Matt, \\"The Perfect Ten\\", The Observer (UK), Saturday July 3, 2004 He enrolled at the Romania College of Physical Education, studying and practicing gymnastics after having had trouble with a mandatory skills test in the sport.Latimer, Clay, \\"Karolyis' Olympics rise is gym dandy: Husband-and- wife team have shaped gymnastics in U.S.\\", Rocky Mountain News, August 3, 2008 In his senior year at the college, K√°rolyi coached the women's gymnastics team, whose star was M√°rta Er≈ëss. They later started a relationship and married in 1963. They moved to a small town in the coal-mining region where B√©la had grown up, where they started a gymnastics class in the elementary school. Later they were invited by the government to create a national school for gymnastics. Romania's famed centralized training program has its roots in the 1950s; K√°rolyi helped develop the program further in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He worked as a coach at the boarding school in Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej (now named One≈üti), training young girls specially chosen for their athletic potential. One of the first students at the school was six- year-old Nadia ComƒÉneci, who lived near the town and commuted from home.Comaneci, Nadia. Letters to a Young Gymnast. 2004, Basic Books. K√°rolyi debuted as an international coach in 1974. He had to persuade the Romanian gymnastics federation to have ComƒÉneci and his other athletes named to the 1975 European Championships and the 1976 Olympic team, because the federation favored athletes from the competing Dinamo club in Bucharest. At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, he was head coach of the Romanian squad, and most of the members of the team were Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej athletes. The team took the silver medal, and ComƒÉneci was one of the outstanding performers of the Games, scoring the first-ever perfect 10 in Olympic competition. Altogether, the Romanians won seven medals in Montreal: three gold, two silver, and two bronze. After ComƒÉneci's astounding success in Montreal, K√°rolyi's importance as a coach was recognized. He was named head coach of the Romanian team at the 1980 Olympics. However, he came under fire from Romanian officials because of his score protests at several international meets, including the 1980 Olympics.  Defecting to America  After the Olympics, K√°rolyi again clashed with Romanian Federation officials, and tension escalated. During a 1981 gymnastics tour, Romanian team choreographer G√©za Pozs√°r and the K√°rolyis defected and sought political asylum in the United States, temporarily leaving their seven-year-old daughter Andrea with relatives in Romania. They settled in Oklahoma.B√©la Karolyi. USA GymnasticsThomas, Robert McG. Jr and Michael Janofsky (March 10, 1987). \\"Citizen Karolyi\\" The New York Times. 1980s In 1981, a group of businessmen invited K√°rolyi to join a gymnastics business venture. He decided to invest in the business, and the K√°rolyis relocated to Houston. The gym ran into financial problems, and K√°rolyi ended up buying it. K√°rolyi's status as \\"Nadia's coach\\" quickly attracted gymnasts to his club. Three years after his defection, he attended the 1984 Olympics as the individual coach of Mary Lou Retton, who won all-around champion, and Julianne McNamara, who won the gold medal for uneven bars. Olympic rules at that time did not permit a gymnast‚Äôs personal coach to be present on the competition floor. Only the national coach Don Peters and his assistant were allowed on the floor. K√°rolyi obtained a maintenance man's pass so he could be near Retton and McNamara during the competition. ABC television network commented on this controversy during its broadcasts and often showed Mary Lou Retton and Julianne McNamara running over to the stands to speak to K√°rolyi. During the 1984 Olympics, K√°rolyi did not have an official position with the delegation. He slept in his car, and ignored Peters' instructions by holding supplementary workouts for his gymnasts. K√°rolyi's clout in the United States increased after the victories of his students in 1984, but so did resentment against him. After Retton's success in 1984, K√°rolyi purchased the Karolyi Ranch. He was paid by McDonald's to have their golden arch logo as part of his sleeve design. His new gym, run from the ranch, attracted many of the country's top gymnasts. Following the 1984 Olympics, USGF decided to replace Peters with Greg Marsden as Olympic coach. Marsden was a college coach with no private students and no financial interest in promoting one gymnast at the expense of another. Marsden said that he \\"thought some of the concerns the other coaches had about K√°rolyi were legitimate,\\" and selected Donna Cozzo as assistant national coach. K√°rolyi was furious and had to be dissuaded from boycotting the 1987 Pan American Games. K√°rolyi did not attend the meet, complaining that he was not allowed to coach although he was \\"providing fifty percent of the team\\". K√°rolyi's star gymnast Kristie Phillips competed in the meet, finishing second behind Sabrina Mar, who trained with former Olympic coach Don Peters at SCATS gym. The United States did not do well in the 1987 World Championships, finishing 6th. Marsden resigned from his position as national team coach in November 1987. After Marsden resigned, K√°rolyi lobbied to be appointed as national coach, but he was opposed by the other coaches. Don Peters was restored to the position in January 1988. Peters chose B√©la's wife M√°rta K√°rolyi to serve as assistant national coach. K√°rolyi told USGF that he would not attend the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, unless he was the team coach. At the 1988 Olympic Trials in August, K√°rolyi's gymnasts earned 5 of the top 8 spots. These five gymnasts were Phoebe Mills, Brandy Johnson, Chelle Stack, and the two team alternates Rhonda Faehn and Kristie Phillips. Phillips, who had left K√°rolyi's gym and trained with Peters for a short time following her disappointing performance at the 1987 World Championships, said that Peters workouts were \\"not half as intense (as K√°rolyi's)\\". Phillips told reporters it would hurt the national team if they had to leave K√°rolyi's gym and train with Peters at SCATS. USGF executive director Mike Jacki said, \\"The women's coaches are all private businessmen[...]The more kids you put on the team, the better it is for your business.\\" Peters resigned as national coach after the trials. Following Peters' resignation, the USGF decided against having a national team coach. They decided to allow personal coaches to accompany the gymnasts to the competition. The U.S. Olympic team finished fourth in Seoul. East German gymnastic official Ellen Berger raised an objection; an obscure rule allowed the judges to sanction the U.S. team with a .5 deduction because its alternate Rhonda Faehn had remained on the podium after pulling the springboard away during another gymnast‚Äôs uneven bars routine. Had Faehn stepped off the podium, the US team would have won the bronze medal. This small deduction allowed the East German team to overtake the American team and win the bronze medal. An incensed Karolyi said the rule was invoked in order to \\"keep the scores down\\" because the East German team was \\"fighting desperately to keep their place\\". He said application of the scoring penalty was \\"dirty cheating\\". A photograph of Karolyi embracing and consoling the disappointed American girls appeared in most U.S. newspapers the following day. After the 1988 Olympics, K√°rolyi's sphere of influence continued to grow, as did the number of elite gymnasts training in his gym. At one meet in 1990, a journalist dubbed six top K√°rolyi gymnasts the \\"Karolyi six-pack.\\"\\"Whatever happened to Amy Scherr?\\" Gymnastics Greats, July 11, 2000 Although the members of the six- pack would change, the name stuck and increased K√°rolyi's prominence in the sport. 1990s At the 1991 World Championships, four of the six athletes on the U.S. women's team ‚Äî Kim Zmeskal, Betty Okino, Hilary Grivich, and Kerri Strug ‚Äî were trained by K√°rolyi; the other two, Shannon Miller and Michelle Campi, were trained by ex-K√°rolyi club coaches. The situation was almost repeated at the 1992 Olympics, where K√°rolyi was head coach and five members of the seven-gymnast squad (six competitors and one alternate) were either trained by him or one of his prot√©g√©s. K√°rolyi primarily served as a personal coach for Dominique Moceanu and Kerri Strug at the 1996 Olympics, but he still managed to draw the spotlight. His motivational speech to Strug after she injured her ankle on her first vault (\\"Shake it off! You can do it!\\") was broadcast on television and was widely viewed. After Strug's successful final vault, K√°rolyi carried her to the podium to accept her gold medal. The moment was photographed and widely publicized.Weinberg, Rick. \\"Kerri Strug fights off pain, helps U.S. win gold\\" ESPN. K√°rolyi retired from coaching after the 1996 Olympics. He and M√°rta still have a ranch and gymnastics camp in New Waverly, Texas. In 1997, K√°rolyi was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.  1999‚Äì2000  Following the success of the U.S. team, dubbed the \\"Magnificent Seven,\\" at the 1996 Olympics, USA Gymnastics experienced a lull. A new requirement that competitors be at least 16 years old in the calendar year of the competition (up from the previous 15) kept some top gymnasts out of the World Championships in 1997. While American gymnasts did win medals in international competitions such as the Goodwill Games and the Pacific Alliance Championships, they were largely unsuccessful in most major meets. In both 1997 and 1999, the American team left the World Championships without a single medal. After the 1999 World Championships, USA Gymnastics tried to revamp its program by hiring K√°rolyi as national team coordinator. K√°rolyi required that all national team members attend frequent, grueling camps at his ranch north of Houston. Some observers believed that selection procedures for international meets became more arbitrary. Coaches resented what they felt was K√°rolyi's intrusion onto their domain, and athletes were under a considerable amount of stress. The tension had escalated to the point where gymnasts were openly speaking out against K√°rolyi. At the 2000 Olympics, the U.S. originally placed fourth, but the Chinese team had an underage athlete, so the U.S team were awarded the bronze.\\"Bela-aching tough to stomach\\" Chicago Sun-Times, September 20, 2000Shelton, Gary. \\"Time to bid Bela goodbye\\" St. Petersburg Times, September 20, 2000.Roberts, Selena.\\"U.S. Gymnasts Try to Catch Karolyi's Eye\\" The New York Times, August 19, 2000. In 2001, Marta K√°rolyi was selected for the national team coordinator position. While she retained some aspects of her husband's program, such as the training camp system, she reduced the frequency of the camps. Her different approach met with more acceptance by both coaches and gymnasts. Between 2001 and 2007, American women won a combined total of 34 medals in World Championship and Olympic competition. Between 2001 and 2016, they won five World Championships team titles (2003, 2007, 2011, 2014, and 2015) and two Olympic team titles (2012, 2016). Additionally, the team won four consecutive Olympic all-arounds (2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016), Eight World Championships all-arounds (2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017), and eighteen individual event World Championships titles. Later career M√°rta K√°rolyi remained the national team coordinator for USA Gymnastics until 2016. During the 2008 Summer Olympics, B√©la K√°rolyi appeared as a guest commentator for NBC News. He claimed that the Chinese women's gymnastics team was cheating by using athletes who did not meet the minimum age requirement.Bela Karolyi incensed about underage rules. Sports.yahoo.com. Retrieved on October 3, 2016. He and his wife said, \\"They are using half-people. One of the biggest frustrations is, what arrogance. These people think we are stupid.\\"Sandomir, Richard (August 20, 2008) \\"Karolyi Puts the Color in Color Commentary\\". New York Times K√°rolyi said that he disagreed with the age limit, and called for the International Olympic Committee to abolish it. He said that if a gymnast was good enough to earn a spot at the Olympics or World Championships, he or she deserves to go. He praised the Chinese for their competitiveness and skills during the competitions, and said that he objected to the possibility that they were being used by their government. \\"They do good gymnastics and are a good service for the sport,\\" he said. \\"They have the ultimate effective training program. That‚Äôs why I am more upset that they are cheating. They don‚Äôt need cheating. They would be just as good with a lineup of eligible athletes.\\" Controversy Several of K√°rolyi's athletes from the \\"six-pack\\" era have criticized his training methods. Some of his former athletes, including Kristie Phillips, Dominique Moceanu, and Erica Stokes, have stated publicly that K√°rolyi was verbally and psychologically abusive during workouts. K√°rolyi's constant critical remarks about weight and body type were said to drive some gymnasts to develop eating disorders and low self-esteem. Some gymnasts, such as Phillips, Moceanu, and 1988 Olympian Chelle Stack, have also said they were compelled to continue training and competing even when coping with serious injuries such as broken bones. In one interview, Moceanu, who was one of K√°rolyi's final prot√©g√©s, said: \\"I'm sure Bela saw injuries, but if you were injured, B√©la didn't want to see it. ... You had to deal with it. I was intimidated. He looked down on me. He was six-feet something, and I was four-foot nothing.\\"Reid, Scott M. \\"Gymnasts in pain: Out of balance\\" O.C. Register December 19, 2004 K√°rolyi was also said to strictly monitor his gymnasts' food intake: Moceanu, for instance, stated that at meets away from home, gymnasts were limited to consuming as few as 900 Calories a day.Reid, Scott M. \\"Emphasis on thin is a heavy burden\\" O.C. Register, December 20, 2004 Even K√°rolyi's supporters have admitted that at certain competitions, his gymnasts ate so sparingly that members of the men's gymnastics team smuggled food to them in their hotel rooms. However, many of K√°rolyi's most prominent gymnasts have vehemently defended him against these allegations. Nadia ComƒÉneci, in her memoir Letters to a Young Gymnast, remarked that she literally trusted K√°rolyi with her life. She also stated that in Romania, the gymnasts at K√°rolyi's school consumed well-balanced diets and, in fact, ate better than most other civilians in the country at the time. Olympic medalists and K√°rolyi gymnasts Mary Lou Retton,B√©la Karolyi 2007 Interview with Mary Lou Retton on Sidewalks Entertainment Phoebe Mills, and Kim Zmeskal, among others, have also praised K√°rolyi and his training regimen.Okino, Betty. \\"Betty Okino's Olympic Report: Bela Karolyi\\" Sports Hollywood, 2000 A number of former K√°rolyi gymnasts, both supporters and detractors, have acknowledged that some of the allegations about K√°rolyi were true, but have also claimed that the ends ‚Äî medals ‚Äî justified the means. In Joan Ryan's Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, 1992 Olympian Betty Okino said: \\"What B√©la did worked. He motivated me by getting me mad.\\" Some have claimed that K√°rolyi stopped treating gymnasts harshly when parents directly requested that he do so. In a column she wrote rebutting many of the claims of Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, Okino wrote: \\"K√°rolyi structured his training in a way that built your physical and mental strength to such a remarkable level that even he couldn't tear you down. B√©la wanted to know that when push came to shove, his athletes could handle any situation thrown at them.\\"Okino, Betty. \\"The Balanced View: Betty Okino\\", SportsHollywood.com, 2000. In an interview in the edition of December 8, 2007 of the Romanian newspaper Evenimentul Zilei, Adrian Goreac,\\"Bela Karoly a fost un dictator\\". evz.ro (December 8, 2007) the coach of the Romanian national gymnastics team from 1981 to 1990, after K√°rolyi left, spoke of K√°rolyi's \\"dictatorial regime\\" during his time coaching the Romanian gymnastics team. In November 2008, Emilia Eberle, a Romanian national team member during the K√°rolyi coaching era, gave an interview to KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California, claiming that while she was on the national team, both B√©la and M√°rta K√°rolyi regularly beat her and her teammates for mistakes they made in practice or competition. \\"In one word, I can say it was brutal,\\" she told KCRA. Other Romanian team members, including Ecaterina Szabo and Rodica Dunca, as well as G√©za Pozs√°r, the team choreographer who defected with the K√°rolyis, have made similar charges of physical abuse. When asked in 2008 to comment on the allegations, B√©la said: \\"I ignore it. I'm not even commenting. These people are really trash.\\" =Role in sexual abuse scandal= While K√°rolyi has not been personally implicated in the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal that was reported beginning in 2016, gymnasts said that many instances of sexual abuse perpetrated by former team doctor Larry Nassar occurred at the Karolyi Ranch. Nassar reportedly groomed athletes for abuse and gained their trust in part by covertly providing them with food in defiance of K√°rolyi's strict dietary guidelines. Some gymnasts also said that the strict discipline and conditions at the ranch made them feel inhibited from reporting Nassar's abuses. As a result of the scandal, in July 2017 USA Gymnastics cancelled its plans to buy Karolyi Ranch.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2017/05/16/usa- gymnastics-wont-buy-famed-karolyi-ranch-after-all/101767644/ In January 2018 USA Gymnastics announced they were cutting ties with Karolyi Ranch altogether. Books  Television B√©la K√°rolyi was in the episode \\"At the Edge of the Worlds\\", in the ABC Family show Make It or Break It. He portrayed Coach Sasha Belov's father. Music B√©la K√°rolyi was mentioned in Sir Mix-A-Lot's song, \\"Beepers\\". The line in the song is: \\"That's Attitude Adjustor, my homie... huggin' more girls than B√©la K√°rolyi\\".

The palace was built in the mid-15th century by King Sejong for his father, Taejong. It was originally named \\"Suganggung,\\" but it was renovated and enlarged in 1483 by King Seongjong, at which time it received its current name. Many structures were destroyed during Japan's multiple late 16th century attempts to conquer Korea and invade China. It was rebuilt by successive Joseon Kings but was once again largely destroyed by the Japanese in the early 20th century, but this time torn down methodically to make room for a modern park, a showplace for the empire, akin to Tokyo's Ueno Park. During the Japanese colonial period, the Japanese built a zoo, botanical garden, and museum on the site. After independence in 1945 and the turmoil and destruction of the 1950-53 Korean War, the zoo was restocked through donations of wealthy Koreans as well as gifts from foreign zoos. In 1983, the zoo and botanical garden were relocated to present-day Seoul Grand Park. Composition and buildings Today its main points of interest are as follows: * Honghwamun (main gate) The palace's main gate faces eastward like the central part of the palace. First built in 1484, it burned down during the Japanese invasion of 1592 and was rebuilt in 1616. A ball pavilion (sipjagak) was built on either side of this two-tiered wooden gate. As you pass through the gate, Okcheongjo Bridge comes into view. Between the arches under the bridge's parapet are carved goblins (dokkaebi) that are intended to ward off evil spirits. Okcheongjo Bridge was built approximately 500 years ago and serves as a symbolic entry to the courtyard. Honghwamun is designated as National Treasure 384. * Okcheongyo (bridge) The bridge was built in 1483. It is 9.9 meters long by 6.6 meters wide and supported by twin arches. Between the arches under the bridge's parapet are carved goblins (dokkaebi) that are intended to ward off evil spirits. Okcheongjo Bridge serves as a symbolic entry to the courtyard. Okcheongyo Bridge is designated as National Treasure 386. * Myeongjeongjeon (main hall) Myeongjeongjeon is the main hall of the palace, where state affairs such as meetings with officials and royal banquets were held. First built in 1484, it was burned down during the Japanese invasion of 1592. Rebuilt in 1616, it is the oldest main hall of all the palaces in Seoul. It is smaller than the two- story main halls of Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung because it was originally built as living quarters, especially for dowager queens, rather than as a throne hall. Although it is a simple, one-story structure, Myeongjeongjeon was built on an elevated stone yard that imbued it with the dignity of a main hall. Running through the courtyard in front is a three-level walkway whose center path was for the king's use only. Surrounding the entire area is a wall-like structure of single-room units which were used by the royal guards or for royal funerals. Myeongjeongjeon is designated as National Treasure 226. * Munjeongjeon (council hall) Munjeongjeon is a council hall where the king dealt with routine state affairs. Unlike the throne hall, which faces east, this building faces south. Such a palace layout with a secondary structure facing a different direction than a throne hall is highly unusual in Korea. Munjeongjeon was also used to enshrine royal tablets after funerals. It was dismantled during the Japanese occupation. Munjeongjeon as it stands today was restored in 1986 along with Munjeongjeon Gate and the eastern part of the roofed corridor. According to the nineteenth-century \\"Painting of the Eastern Palace\\", Munjeongjeon was partitioned from Sungmundang and Myeongjeongjeon by a wall, and had a small annex; the courtyard was surrounded by a wall-like corridor. This part has not yet been restored. On May 13, 1762, that courtyard in front of Munjeongjeon witnessed the most tragic incident of the century. It had been reported to King Yeongjo that Crown Prince Sado was mentally ill and behaving erratically. Furious with the Prince, his father ordered him to be sealed alive in a large rice chest, where he died eight days later at the age of 28. King Yeongjo later became remorseful and gave his son the posthumous title 'Sado' (\\"thinking in sorrow\\"). It is often believed that Crown Prince Sado was a victim of a conspiracy by his political adversaries, but this is refuted in the Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong, which was written by Prince Sado's wife Lady Hyegyeong. * Sungmundang (hall) At Sungmundang Hall, the king threw banquets to discuss state affairs and classical literature. It is believed to have been built under King Gwanghaegun when Changgyeonggung was first rebuilt. Burned down in 1830, it was rebuilt in autumn of the same year. Its foundation was designed to make the hall appear elevated on sloped ground; the base stones for the front columns were made high, while those in the rear were made low. The name of the building \\"Sungmundang\\" written by King Yeongjo still hangs at the entrance. * Haminjeong (pavilion) First built in 1633 on the former site of Inyangjeon Hall, Haminjeong was destroyed by fire in 1830 and rebuilt in 1833. The king used this pavilion to receive officials and hold banquets. Haminjeong today is open on all four sides, but as depicted in \\"Painting of the Eastern Palace\\", it had walls on three sides. * Gyeongchunjeon (hall) built in 1483, destroyed in 1592, rebuilt in 1616, burnt down in 1830 and again rebuilt in 1834. King Jeongjo and King Heonjong were born here. * Hwangyeongjeon (hall) first built in 1484 during the reign of King Seongjong, destroyed in 1592, rebuilt in 1616, burnt down in 1830 and again rebuilt in 1834. * Tongmyeongjeon (hall) first built in 1484, rebuilt most recently in 1834; main building in the Yeonjo area where kings and their families lived. * Chundangji (two ponds) constructed in 1909, with 366-square-meter island and bridge added in 1984. The smaller pond is 1,107 square meters and the larger one is 6,483 square meters.

Gyeonghui Palace (in Korean: Gyeonghuigung, literally Palace of Serene Harmony) was a palace located in Seoul, South Korea. It was one of the \\"Five Grand Palaces\\" built by the Joseon Dynasty. History Construction began in the 1600s during the reign of King Gwanghaegun. In the latter Joseon period, Gyeonghuigung served as the secondary palace for the king, and as it was situated on the west side of Seoul, it was also called Seogwol (a palace of the west). The Secondary palace is usually the palace where the King moves to in times of emergency. From King Injo to King Cheoljong, about ten kings of Joseon dynasty stayed here at Gyeonghuigung. This palace was built using the slanted geography of the surrounding mountain, has traditional beauty in its architecture and a lot of historical significance. For a time, it was of a considerable size, even to the point of having an arched bridge connecting it to Deoksugung palace. For the king's royal audience, there were the Sungjeongjeon and Jajeongjeon buildings, and for sleeping, Yungbokjeon and Hoesangjeon buildings. Most of Gyeonghuigung was lost to two fires that broke out in the 19th century, during the reigns of King Sunjo and King Gojong. The Japanese dismantled what remained of the palace during their occupation of the Korean peninsula, and a school for Japanese citizens was built on the site. Two major structures of the former palace - the Sungjeongjeon throne hall and the Heunghwamun gate - were disassembled and moved to other parts of Seoul. Reconstruction started in the 1990s as part of the South Korean government's initiative to rebuild the \\"Five Grand Palaces\\" that were heavily destroyed by the Japanese. However, due to urban growth and decades of neglect, the government was only able to reconstruct around 33% of the former Palace.http://parks.seoul.go.kr/park/common/park_info/park_info_detail.jsp?p_idx=45&p;_cate=4 Present use It is Historic Site No. 271.

From 1970 to 1978, the Capri was a sport compact marketed without any Ford divisional branding, sourced as a captive import from Ford of Europe. From 1979 to 1986, the Capri became part of the Mercury model line as a pony car. From 1991 to 1994, the Mercury Capri was a roadster, sourced as a captive import by Ford of Australia. In North America, the Capri was marketed without a direct Ford-brand counterpart for its first and third generations, although sold elsewhere under the Ford brand. Origin of name The Capri nameplate is derived from the namesake Italian island, in automotive use, it has been used by all three Ford divisions. In 1952, the Lincoln Capri marked the first use of the nameplate, serving as its premium trim level during the early 1950s. From 1962 to 1964, Ford of Britain introduced a Ford Consul Capri two-door hardtop coupe. For 1966 and 1967, the Capri name was first used by Mercury, denoting the standard trim of the Mercury Comet. For 1968, Ford of Europe developed the Ford Capri two-door coup√© as its counterpart to the Mustang. In line with the Mustang, the Capri was styled with a long hood and a short deck (trunklid; later hatchback) with a fastback-style roofline. First generation (1970‚Äì1978) See also Ford Capri = Capri (1970‚Äì1975) = The first generation of the Capri was a captive import produced by Ford of Europe in Cologne, Germany. Introduced in Europe for 1968 (and designed by Ford of Britain using local sourced components from the Cortina MkII and Escort with plans dating back to 1964 when development of a European variant of the Mustang commenced), the Ford Capri was marketed by the Lincoln-Mercury Division starting in April 1970. While marketed as part of the Mercury model line, the Capri did not carry any divisional identification.1970-'74 Ford Capri, www.hemmings.com Retrieved 10 April 2016 Priced at $2,300 at the time of its launch, the Capri was marketed as an economical sporty coupe (with no upscale trim levels unlike its European market variants e.g. the GT, RS, L, XL, and XLR which were trim levels), far smaller than the Mercury Cougar and Montego. In its adaptation to the American market, the Capri saw several minor revisions, with the two rectangular headlights of the Ford Capri replaced by four circular headlamps (shared with some upscale Capri models sold for the European market eg the RS or GT - the rectangular lighting did not meet FMVSS 108), grille-mounted turn signals, and side marker lights; Rostyle wheels were fitted as standard equipment. While produced in Germany as a variant of the Ford Cortina, the Capri adopted powertrain commonality with the newly introduced Ford Pinto. Originally powered by a 1.6L Kent \\"crossflow\\" inline- four, the Capri received a 2.0L \\"OHC\\" inline-4 for 1971. As an option, for 1972, Mercury introduced a 2.6L Cologne V6, becoming the first American-market vehicle marketed by Ford Motor Company with a V6 engine. For 1974, the V6 was enlarged to 2.8L, as Ford revised castings for both the engine block and cylinder heads. For 1973, the front bumper underwent a revision to comply with 5-mph bumper standards. The previous chrome bumper was reinforced with a steel tube and attached to the frame with shock absorbers (extending the length of the body several inches). As part of the change, the Capri saw revisions to the grille, taillamps, and its rear quarter trim grilles. As part of an interior revision, the Capri was given a new steering wheel, dashboard, and seat trim along with a redesigned wiring harness. For 1974, 5 mph bumpers were fitted to both front and rear, replacing the previous chrome tube bumpers with reinforced body-colored plastic bumpers.

Skipping the 1975 model year entirely, Lincoln-Mercury renamed the Capri the Capri II, again omitting any formal divisional identification from the vehicle. While sharing similar styling to its predecessor, the Capri II adopted a hatchback roofline. As with the 1970‚Äì1974 Capri, to adapt to the American market, the Capri II was fitted with quad sealed-beam headlamps, grille-mounted turn signals, 5-mph bumpers, and body-color side-view mirror(s). Again maintaining powertrain commonality with the Ford Pinto, Ford Mustang II and Mercury Bobcat, the Capri II was fitted with the 2.3L OHC engine, offering a 2.8L V6 as an option. After the 1977 model year, Lincoln- Mercury ended imports of the Capri II from Ford of Europe, with unsold examples sold during the 1978 model year. In total, 513,500 Capri/Capri IIs were sold from 1970 to 1978 by Lincoln-Mercury. At its peak, yearly Capri sales in North America were the highest for any import vehicle (with the exception of the Volkswagen Beetle). Ford of Europe continued production of the Capri for another generation, through the end of 1986.

A quality, European car at a realistic price-what more could one want.\\"Road & Track-1977 Road Test annual =Special editions= 1976‚Äì1977 JPS Capri II, Capri II S - Black or white car body with gold striping, \\"black chrome\\" trim, gold and black styled steel wheels and gold badging and grille surround. In Europe, the JPS Capri II celebrated the success of the John Player Special-sponsored Team Lotus Formula 1 team, and emulated its black and gold livery. In the US, anti-tobacco advertising laws required a name change to Capri II S. The interior received special seats and door panels: black with gold cloth inserts. Second generation (1979‚Äì1986) For the 1979 model year, a second generation of the Capri was introduced. As part of several changes over its predecessor, the Capri was officially part of the Mercury model line as Lincoln-Mercury ended captive imports of the Ford Capri in favor of creating a Mercury counterpart of the 1979 Ford Mustang. Sharing the Fox platform with the Mustang, the 1979 Mercury Capri marked the first Mercury \\"pony car\\" since the 1970 Mercury Cougar. 1984 Mercury Capri RS While visually similar to the Mustang, the second-generation Capri was offered solely in the three-door hatchback configuration. The Capri was styled with its own front fascia, a vertically- mounted grille, and dark-tinted taillamps with horizontally-ribbed lenses. In place of the widely flared wheel openings of the Mustang, the Capri was styled with slightly-flared wheel openings and widened front and rear fenders. For 1983, the Capri received a redesign of the rear hatchback, distinguished with a large compound-curve \\"bubble-back\\" rear window. For 1984, the front fascia of the Capri RS was fitted with a front air dam, with the same exterior continuing through 1986. Along with the base-trim Capri, Mercury offered the Capri Ghia (shared with the Mustang), Capri GS, Capri RS, and Capri Turbo RS. The Capri RS/Turbo RS was the Capri equivalent of a Mustang GT. During its production, the second-generation Capri maintained powertrain commonality with the Ford Mustang, with inline-four, inline-6, V6, and V8 engines offered during its production; the only Mustang model with no Capri equivalent was the Mustang SVO. The second-generation Capri was produced through the 1986 model year. For 1987, while the Mustang underwent a mid-cycle update (lasting to 1993), Mercury withdrew the Capri, focusing on the Cougar XR7 as its two-door performance vehicle; the next Mercury hatchback sports coupe was the 1999 Cougar. =Special editions= 1981‚Äì1983 Black Magic - Black cars with gold striping, gold metric TRX wheels and a gold cat's head on each side of the front valance. The interior received special black seats with sand-colored inserts (code YA), with Recaro seating optional in 1982 (code TA) and Sport Performance seating optional in 1983 (code HA). In the 1981 and 1982 models years the Black Magic option could be ordered with polar white (code 9D) paint but otherwise had the same exterior appointments as the black cars (gold striping, gold TRX wheels, and gold cat's heads). Magazine ads for the 9D Black Magic used the term \\"white lightning\\" but the name of the package was still Black Magic. The 1983 model is extremely rare and the only Black Magic to receive the compound rear window. 1983 Crimson Cat - Bright red (code 27) paint with gold striping and Cougar XR-7 TRX wheels set this car apart. Crimson Cat received black sport performance seating with red inserts (code KA). 1984 Charcoal Turbo RS - A Capri RS Turbo that was only available in charcoal upper-silver lower exterior paint with light grey striped rub mouldings, Garrett 60 trim turbocharger, enhanced multiport EFI four-cylinder engine, Michelin TRX package, 5.0 HO Sway bars, 3.45:1 limited slip rear axle, hood scoop, and orange and red lettering and striping. Sun- and T-top roofs were optional. 1985 Mercury Motorsport Capri - Built as pace cars replicas to commemorate the 1985 Detroit Grand Prix & Motorcity 100. These were also cosmetically modified by ASC McLaren for Mercury and are highly sought after for their low production of >55 total units (44 replicas, 4 track cars, 6 festival cars and 1 prototype) and availability in only Michigan & Ohio. =Gallery= File:'79-'82 Mercury Capri.jpg1979‚Äì1982 Mercury Capri RS File:1980 Mercury Capri (6523073155).jpg1980 Mercury Capri RS Turbo File:1980 Mercury Capri.jpg1980 Mercury Capri (Mustang SVO wheels) File:Rebadged mustang.jpg1983 Mercury Capri (base trim) File:MercuryCapriRS- rear.jpg1979‚Äì1982 Mercury Capri RS =Motorsport= This particular generation was successful in the Trans Am Series, winning the championship from 1984-1985 with an aftermarket V8 engine. The Mercury Capri 5.0L was the car used by the Jack Roush team with Wally Dallenbach Jr. driving to win the 1985 Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans AM championship. = Variants =  ASC McLaren (1984‚Äì1986)  1986 Mercury Capri ASC McLaren 5.0 SC Convertible ASC (American Sunroof Corporation, now known as American Specialty Cars) produced several conversions of Mercury Capris from 1984 to 1986. Along with convertible conversions, hatchbacks were restyled (renamed as coupes by the company). The coupes were tuned and enhanced with a number of suspension and visual upgrades including striping, a built-in radar detector, ground effects, Hella fog lights, headlight and taillight covers and Italian Campagnolo honeycomb-style wheels. For 1984, coupes (25 produced) were all painted midnight blue. The 1985-1986 coupes (150 produced in 1985) were either painted blue or white. In 1986 (115 made), the last year for the coupes, customers had an even larger choice of colors, including smoke charcoal grey and raven black, joining the Oxford white and midnight blue, as well as silver metallic. http://www.ascmclaren.com/capripics.htm ASC McLaren Convertible rear view In comparison to the coupes, convertibles were a far more involved project, as the conversion required the redesign of the unibody chassis. As part of the conversion, the convertible top replaced the rear seats. The manual top design is specific to the vehicle, requiring design-specific equipment (such as seals, weatherstripping, and windshield moldings). Fabrication required a replacement rear deck lid, floor reinforcements, quarter panel caps, tonneau cover and a windshield that was raked back an extra 10 degrees In total, 557 convertibles were built during its 1984-1986 production run. = Powertrain upgrades = ASC McLaren coupes were equipped with the Ford Motorsport B303 camshaft,ascMcLaren Coupe Modifications http://www.ascmclaren.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=24 creating significantly more power than the rated / of the standard 5.0L motors. Additionally, all coupes were shod with BFGoodrich Comp T/A radials. The 225/50/15 low profile size of these tires (as opposed to the standard 5.0L Capri's 225/60/15) raised the ASC/McLaren Coupe's effective gear ratio from 3.08:1 to approximately 3.35:1. These were the quickest cars produced by Ford in 1985 and 1986 with zero to sixty times well under six seconds and quarter mile times in the mid-13 second range. Ford Mustang (Mexico, 1981‚Äì1984) 1982 Ford Mustang coup√©, Mexican market version The third-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured in the Ford Cuautitl√°n Itzcalli plant (located in Mexico City) from 1979 to 1984. Produced for sale in Mexico, the vehicles were produced in both hatchback and notchback coupe body configurations. From 1981 to 1984, Cuautitl√°n Assembly produced the Mustang using components from both the Mustang and Mercury Capri. Along with the taillights of the Capri, the Mustangs were produced using the front fascia of the Capri (with Ford badging) from 1982 to 1983. From 1983 to 1984, the facility produced the Mustang hatchback with front and rear fenders of the Capri, along with its \\"bubble-back\\" rear hatch.  Third generation (1991‚Äì1994) Mercury Capri convertible For the 1991 model year, the Mercury Capri made its return to the Mercury division after a five-year hiatus. To give Lincoln-Mercury a competitor for the Mazda MX-5 Miata and Toyota MR2, the Capri was released as two-door roadster. In a fashion similar to the first- generation Mercury Capri, the third-generation version is a captive import; produced by Ford of Australia alongside its Ford Capri counterpart and the Ford Falcon, the Mercury Capri was intended for American exports. For the first time since 1978, the Mercury Capri was the first Mercury without any Ford counterpart in North America. Derived from the Australian Ford Laser (sold in the United States as the first-generation Mercury Tracer), the Ford Capri also shares drivetrain commonality with the Mazda 323. To adapt the Capri for North American sale, Lincoln-Mercury made several changes over the Australian-market Capri. Along with the addition of a driver-side airbag (required to meet passive restraint requirements), the dashboard was changed to non-metric gauges; Mercury Capris are fitted with body-color bumpers. While both two-door convertibles similar in size and price, the Mercury Capri and Mazda MX-5 featured major departures in powertrain and interior configurations, with the Capri adopting a front-wheel drive powertrain. While the MX-5 was strictly a two-seat vehicle, the Capri was a 2+2, with (small) rear seats. Along with folding back seats (allowing access to the trunk), the Capri also offered the option of a removable hard top (similar to the MX-5). From 1991 to 1993, the Mercury Capri was sold with minimal revisions; for 1994, the Mercury Capri received the new taillamps and front and rear bumpers received by the Ford Capri in 1993. During its entire production, the Mercury Capri was sold under two trim levels: base-trim and XR2, distinguished largely by powertrain. The base trim was equipped with a 100hp Mazda 1.6L DOHC inline-4; the XR2 was equipped with a turbocharged version of the 1.6L engine, rated at 132hp. A five-speed manual transmission was standard for both trims, with a four-speed automatic available on base-trim Capris. The XR2 came standard with a new suspension tune, better tires, and revised appearance.

It contrasted the transcendental idealism of Kant and the absolute idealism of Hegel Actual idealism was a form of idealism, developed by Giovanni Gentile, that grew into a 'grounded' idealism, contrasting the transcendental idealism of Immanuel Kant, and the absolute idealism of G. W. F. Hegel. To Gentile, who considered himself the \\"philosopher of fascism,\\" actualism was the sole remedy to philosophically preserving free agency, by making the act of thinking self- creative and, therefore, without any contingency and not in the potency of any other fact. Central tenets Actual idealism holds that it is the act of thinking as perception, not creative thought as imagination, which defines reality. Therefore, one idea, or another, can only be a formulation of particulars within the bounds of a known totality, in which one idea is not on any side of those particulars. Totality constituting the whole cohesive reality, is negated in such idea by itself. Integration of totality against idea, in appealing to oneself, is the sole fruitful means of idea, which poses no favoritism to the developed ideas giving a knowing precedence to the world it has created itself into. Anything less is a presupposition and therefore innately unreal. This totality is the act of thinking, not thoughts so regarded by thinking. While realists agree that the world known to them is the only one they possibly know 'as a static concept,' they continue to regard something real about the concept having nothing to do with their thinking. Actual idealists disregard the static concept, as totally false, in regard to the world for them where the only real is in 'the act of thinking' within being. The stance of realism claims that repeatability of experience gives proof of a basis, which transcends and outruns our percepts, refuting Idealism. Yet it does not consider that the process of thinking, as creation, and the thought about thinking, as abstraction, interchange depending on the quality of one's act. It is the process of thinking that creates thought, which may not recur, but what occurs as thinking of it is what cannot be outrun as a conceptualization, for it is the very immanent process of it, which is what definitely is. Not as thoughts perceived, but as perceptive thinking prior to being construed outside its own totality as a thought, not made an abstraction, which cannot exist or be supposed to exist in any form outside one's thinking. Only one's thought reached from -and thus put outside of- thinking can be surpassed; but only by thinking, not by an abstract external. Actual idealism, therefore, rejects the Hegelian 'Absolute' as being a presupposition unprovable to the mind, unless considered to be synonymous with what's known or the totality of the act of thinking. Which therein would put the dialectical processes making 'self' & 'not self' a consideration proving external existence real, insofar as it is in reality part of the self's own thinking, since the self, regarded alone, is always a concept and cannot be given reality as such. Neither does Actual idealism admit archetypal concepts in that possible conception of them in relation to all else gives them no reality. Gentile made a pivotal distinction to factors concerning Idealism's own criteria for reality, which have stood since Berkeley's adage \\"Esse est percipi\\" by distinguishing between \\"pensiero pensante\\" the 'act of thinking', and the 'static thought' \\"pensiero pensato\\". Gentile posited then, that knowledge as thought fixed against a fuller range of thinking limits thinking's every proposition. If truth is what surpasses the conditions of every proposition, taking a known postulate as truth removes its criteria from having that capability in thinking. Objectifying actuality. Truth then cannot be known by thought, since knowledge held as thought is privative toward thinking as decided by what's thought. Only thinking as it penetrates, not given in to what categories of thought orient it, can be truth, so long as it does not resort to thought in doing so which would objectify it. Such thinking is truth because it therefore defines reality as by that thinking, rather than excluding truth from the possibility of thinking because of its relation to yielding thoughts. Only because thinking's results, namely thoughts, do not pertain to what is arising from its act, the truth, does thinking itself become questioned as a proper conductor of truth. That however does not detract from the nature of truths being defined within the act as the concrete. Thinking, being the condition in which truths are measured, in fact affirms thinking's own condition as truth, and when coupled with the idea that it generates thoughts which negate it, must the concrete be identified with thinking rather than simply being denied to thought, seen as abstract, and having that together assumed with thinking as denied also. For thinking cannot therefore be solely a producer of thoughts alone to Gentile, as is the position taken by materialists, because thoughts are to him what negate it, but must also be what produces the stable environment wherein being happens. Which then is the direct result of oneself as the further quality in which reality is not negated, as it is by thoughts to themselves. Therefore, this postulate maintains that thinking is an active process and the static conception of a thought is its dialectical opposite. Where thinking is the vitality of psychological being, a thought is opposed to that vitality and therefore would be opposed to that immanent quality where alone existence takes on its reality to the actual idealist. No sense or imagining of something beyond or external to the act of thinking in itself for the thinker can be real, and therefore cannot be said to exist, even if, to continue the act of thinking it must be said that it does exist as a creation of the act of thinking if even then it remains unreal. Which in considering it the measure of its existence is realized for then it is exposed to the act of thinking and is subject to reality; from an a priori beginning to a non-empirical conclusion without presupposition. Reception Actual idealism was successful in that it promoted a theory of regarding thought, that garnered enough attention, to prove a competition to the new waves of positivism, and therefore materialist conceptions of social life that were vying for reformist tendencies in the politics of the time. Its ideas, therefore, were key to helping the National Fascist Party consolidate power in Italy with its own reform, and integral to giving fascism the content of its philosophical sentiment. Despite this, Gentile claimed actual idealism to be the true variety of positivism, and the proper interpretation of the concept of positivism.The Philosophy of Giovanni Gentile: An Inquiry into Gentile's Conception of Experience. Criticism Benedetto Croce objected that Gentile's \\"pure act\\" is nothing other than Schopenhauer's will.Treasury of Philosophy, edited by Dagobert D. Runes, Philosophical Library, New York, 1955: \\"Gentile, Giovanni\\" However Schopenhauer \\"‚Ä¶came to rest in an Absolute which transcends concrete experience ‚Ä¶ and for (Schopenhauer) the Critical Philosophy was only a prolegomena or propaedeutic to a speculative or 'transcendent' philosophy of the kind which Gentile and Kant are united in opposing\\",The Social Philosophy of Giovanni Gentile, p. 9. according to H. S. Harris's book on the basic metaphysics of Giovanni Gentile in contrast to that of Schopenhauer.

The airport is a small regional airport and has no scheduled routes. Introduction and history Sligo Airport is the home of the Sligo Aero Club (a Registered Training Facility) and the northwest base for the Irish Coastguard. Private flight training, skydiving and charity jumps are all operated from the airport. Like airports such as Gibraltar and Funchal, Sligo has a lack of safety margin for undershoots and overshoots because the peninsula upon which the airport is situated is less than long. In 2002 a Euroceltic Airways Fokker F27 aircraft carrying the band Aslan overshot the runway and the nose dipped into the sea. The accident caused no casualties. Euroceltic was operating the Government of Ireland public service obligation subsidy scheme for the route to Dublin at the time. The airline collapsed shortly afterwards and Aer Arann operated the route for the remainder of the contract. The 2005 contract tender was offered to Loganair who declined it. Aer Arann subsequently negotiated the operation of the contract with the Government. On 21 February 2007 the Irish Government announced that it would be giving ‚Ç¨8.5 million to the airport in capital grant money, to upgrade the runway and add approach lighting and safety enhancements. However, the proposed runway extension would have required infill and the erection of gantries across part of the adjacent protected beach. The plan drew much local criticism and almost 400 objections from residents of the local area, fisheries groups, the Department of Environment, An Taisce and Birdwatch Ireland. The planning permission was quashed on the third attempt by a high court judge on justification grounds.http://www.dorrins.com/latest-news/2010/06/high-court-quashes-airport- planning-decision/ Until the end of 2008 there was a connection with Manchester Airport which was operated by Aer Arann. In 2011 the airport lost its only scheduled route, operated by Aer Arann, to Dublin Airport twice daily. The final flight was on 21 July 2011. The Irish Government-commissioned Value for Money Review of Exchequer Funding on the Regional Airports Programme recommended the ending of operational subvention to the airport and the ending of the PSO designation, citing poor performance, growing operational costs and development of alternative transport connections to the region. Since the ending of passenger flights in 2011 the airport has continued to be a base for the Irish Coast Guard Rescue Helicopter (Rescue 118). The airport also operates general aviation aircraft including Cessnas, Pipers, and Beechcraft. Sligo Aero Club continues to operate from the airport. The airport receives occasional visits from jets which are suited to land on the shorter runway. CHC Ireland Search and Rescue Base Sligo Airport is the home of Rescue 118, the Irish Coast Guard Helicopter which has served the north-west of Ireland since 2004. The base operates a Sikorsky S-92A helicopter 24 hours, 365 days a year (which replaced the previously used S-61N on 1 July 2013). It deals with many types of incidents, such as cliff rescues, hospital transfers, and dealing with sick patients off coastal islands. Accidents and incidents *On 2 November 2002, a Euroceltic Fokker F-27 (registered G-ECAT) was coming in to land on Runway 11, after a routine flight from Dublin, when it overran the runway. After landing nosewheel first almost halfway down the runway, the aircraft eventually came to rest with the nose of the aircraft in the sea, and the main landing gear on an embankment. Passengers were evacuated and there were no reported casualties. However the plane was declared a write- off by the company two weeks later, due to the saltwater damage to the cockpit. The cause of the accident was a \\"fast, low approach, leading to the aircraft landing late, beyond the normal touch down point, thereby making it impossible to stop the aircraft on the remaining runway available\\". The pilot at the time had been placed under restrictions following a CAA audit of Euroceltic, as noted in paragraph 1.18.2 of the AAIU report. The chief pilot of Euroceltic \\"was using an instructor tone and coaching\\" the pilot during landing, as noted in paragraph 2.1 of the report. The AAIU report also notes in paragraph 2.1 that \\"Whilst the meteorological conditions were difficult they were well within the limits for the type of approach and there was very little crosswind component\\" and in paragraph 2.2 that \\"there was no significant standing water on the runway during the landing\\".http://www.aaiu.ie/sites/default/files/report- attachments/REPORT%202005_015.pdf References External links * Official website Category:Transport in County Sligo Category:Airports in the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Sligo Airport"},{"id":"901729","text":"The A52 at the Zumikon starting point The A52 expressway The village of Forch and Forchautobahn, Maur and Glatt Valley to the right The A52 is a main road () (American English: Expressway) connecting Zumikon in the canton of Z√ºrich with Hinwil and Rapperswil-Jona in the canton of St. Gallen.

The only problem is that she's his boss's wife and that his boss has hired him to kill her. =Other projects= In 2014 it was announced that Nesb√∏ would contribute a re-telling of the story of Macbeth as part of the Hogarth Shakespeare project, described as a 'crime noir' version of the tragedy. His Macbeth is set in 1970 in an unspecified location that combines aspects of Scandinavia and Scotland, and involves an Inspector Macbeth of a paramilitary SWAT team targeting bikers, drug dealers, and his police colleagues. It was published in April 2018. In 2016, it was announced that there are also plans to adapt his stand-alone novel, S√∏nnen (The Son), as a film, to be directed by Denis Villeneuve, with Jake Gyllenhaal as producer and Channing Tatum in the lead role. On 5 April 2017, it was announced that Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur is working on a new adaptation of I Am Victor, a short story by Nesb√∏ previously planned as an NBC television series but not completed. Personal life Nesb√∏ played top-flight football for Molde FK until he tore the cruciate ligaments in his knee, and had to concentrate on other aspects of his life. Nesb√∏ is a dedicated rock climber and has climbed sport routes up to French grade 7c. In addition to his career as author, Nesb√∏ is also the main vocalist and songwriter for the Norwegian rock band Di Derre. He lives close to his former wife and their daughter in Oslo.

It opened in 1761, and was insolvent by 1884. Its demise was accelerated by an attempt to reclaim saltings at Blythburgh, which resulted in the estuary silting up. It was used sporadically until 1911, and was not formally abandoned until 1934. History Between Southwold and Walberswick, the mouth of the River Blyth forms a tidal creek, which opens out into a large area of saltings below the first bridge over the river at Blythburgh. The river was navigable to the port of Blythburgh until the 16th century, but navigation was increasingly affected by silting up of the channel. The volume of water which drained from the saltings on every tide kept the mouth of the river scoured, and enabled Southwold to develop as an important, though minor, port. The idea of making the river navigable beyond Blythburgh was proposed by Thomas Knights in the 1740s. Knights was a brewer from Halesworth, and suggested that Southwold harbour needed to be improved first. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1746 to authorise the improvements, which were sufficiently successful that harbour dues more than doubled over the next five years. Knights tried to gain more support for a navigation to Halesworth, and a plan for the navigation, including a branch from Halesworth to Ubbeston was prepared by Benjamin Reeve in 1753. The project which included three locks was costed at ¬£4,614 by John Reynolds in May 1753, but there was a delay before the bill was submitted to Parliament. Following the granting of an Act of Parliament on 1 April 1757, which included additional powers for the Southwold Harbour trustees, a new survey was carried out by Langley Edwards, who estimated the cost at ¬£3,000, which included the purchase of Wenhaston watermill. By 1759, subscriptions had been received from 38 people, mainly from the immediate locality, for a total of ¬£3,600. Having made the estimate, Edwards was responsible for completing the work to that price, but failed to attend most of the meetings which the commissioners called. Despite his elusiveness, the work was completed at a cost of ¬£3,822, and the official opening took place on 23 July 1761. =Operation= As built, the navigation had four locks and a tidal staunch located just above Blythburgh bridge. From the sea, it followed the River Blyth until it reached the Town River, which it followed to Halesworth Lock. From there, the New Cut took the canal to a wharf at Halesworth, which formed the terminus of the canal. The New Cut joined back up with the Town River a little further to the west, in order to provide the water supply for the locks. The locks were built to allow wherries to use the navigation, and so were . However, they were unusual, in that the side walls curved outwards in the centre, to provide an extra of width. So that wherries could reach his maltings, a local maltster named Patrick Stead increased the water levels above the point where the New Cut and the Town River joined, by building an additional lock near the junction. The day-to-day running of the navigation for the first four years was the responsibility of Samuel Jones, who appears to have overseen the construction of the navigation while Langley Edwards was elsewhere, and who was appointed as lock-keeper, toll-collector, warehouse-keeper and surveyor of works by the Commissioners. Each time his contract was to be renewed, they attempted to reduce his salary, and so he left and was replaced by his assistant William Bickers. Tolls over the next thirty years averaged ¬£134 per year =Demise= In the early 19th century, the saltings below Blythburgh bridge were reclaimed by the construction of embankments, to prevent them flooding. The plan was poorly thought out, and soon afterwards the condition of Southwold harbour was deteriorating, largely due to the deposition of silt, which made access difficult. The canal engineer John Rennie was asked to advise on a course of action, but although his report of 6 January 1820 pointed to the embanking of the saltings as the cause of the problem, he could offer no acceptable solution. The entrance to the harbour became blocked in 1839, and a further report was prepared by John Wright and James Walker in 1840. They calculated that the embankments surrounding the saltings excluded 5.5 million cubic yards (4.2 million m3) of tidal water on each tide, and thus the scouring effect of the river was considerably reduced. 1879 saw the opening of the Southwold Railway, a narrow gauge line between Southwold and Halesworth, which crossed the navigation near Southwold on a swing bridge. Although lack of capital prevented the construction of a branch from the main line to the navigation at Halesworth and another along the north bank of the river towards Southwold harbour, the railway still had an effect on the navigation, use of which declined until the Commissioners advertised that they were no longer deriving any income from it in 1884, and would therefore cease to maintain it. In 1894 the Commissioners voted to ask the Board of Trade for a warrant to allow the navigation to be abandoned. Despite this, a trader from Halesworth called Fred Lambert brought a wherry called Star to the river, and carried coal from the harbour at Southwold to Halesworth until 1911. He estimated that the cost of repairing the navigation was ¬£1,000, but he could not raise the money to carry out the work. The Southwold Railway finally built a branch to the harbour in 1914, as part of a plan to relieve congestion of the harbours at Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft during the herring fishing season. The outbreak of war prevented its use for this purpose, although it was useful when coastal defences were being built in the area. The harbour declined until it was sold back to the Southwold Corporation in 1932, while the navigation finally ceased on 19 February 1934, when an act of abandonment was obtained under section 41 of the Land Drainage Act 1930. Remains The swing bridge which carried the railway over the river was widened in 1907, and was removed at the outbreak of World War II. It has since been replaced by a fixed Bailey Bridge to provide access on foot to Walberswick. With the demise of the locks, the river levels have fallen, so that it is difficult to imagine that wherries once reached Halesworth. The embankments enclosing the saltings below Blythburgh have been breached, and once more a large inland lake forms when the tide is high. Southwold harbour is used for moorings, and can accommodate 110 boats, while navigation is still possible to Blythburgh, although the Bailey bridge restricts access to smaller boats. There have been sporadic efforts to restore the canal for navigation, but the resultant flooding of bordering land has made this unpopular. On 27 May 2016, Gerald Burns canoed from Halesworth to Southwold, carrying a sack of malt in his boat, which he delivered to Adnams Brewery in Southwold. The purpose of the journey was to raise funds for the restoration of New Reach at Halesworth, which played an important part in the industrial history of the town.

Zhou () were historical political divisions of China. Formally established during the Han dynasty, zhou exist continuously in 1912‚Äîa period of over 2000 years. Zhou were also previously used in Korea (, ju), Vietnam (), and . Overview Zhou is typically rendered by several terms in the English language: * The large zhou before the Tang dynasty and in countries other than China are called \\"provinces\\" * The smaller zhou during and after the Tang dynasty are called \\"prefectures\\" * The zhou of the Qing dynasty are also called either \\"independent\\" or \\"dependent departments\\", depending on their level. A mid-Qing map of Zhejiang Provinces, with all prefecture capitals indicated ( Hangzhou-fu, Wenzhou-fu, Jinhua-fu, etc.). South is on top. The Tang dynasty also established f«î (, \\"prefectures\\"), zhou of special importance such as capitals and other major cities. By the Ming and Qing, became predominant divisions within Chinese provinces. In Ming and Qing, the word f«î () was typically attached to the name of each prefecture's capital city, thus both Chinese and Western maps and geographical works would often call the respective cities Hangzhou-fu, Wenzhou-fu, Wuchang-fu, etc. Following the Meiji Restoration, fu was also used in Japanese for the urban prefectures of the most important cities; today, it is still used in the Japanese names for the Osaka and Kyoto Prefectures. In the People's Republic of China, zhou today exists only in the designation \\"autonomous prefecture\\" (), administrative areas for China's designated minorities. However, zhou have left a huge mark on Chinese place names, including the province of Guizhou and the major cities of Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Lanzhou, and Suzhou, among many others. Likewise, although modern Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese provinces are no longer designated by zhou cognates, the older terms survive in various place names, notably the Japanese islands of Honshu and Kyushu, the Korean province Jeju-do, and Lai Ch√¢u in Vietnam. History Zhou were first mentioned in ancient Chinese texts, notably the Yu Gong or Tribute of Yu, section of the Book of Documents. All agreed on the division of China into nine zhou, though they differed on their names and position. These zhou were geographical concepts, not administrative entities. The Han dynasty was the first to formalize the zhou into actual administrative divisions by establishing 13 zhou all across China. Because these zhou were the largest divisions of the China at the time, they are usually translated as \\"provinces\\". After the Han Dynasty, however, the number of zhou began to increase. By the time of the Sui dynasty, there were over a hundred zhou all across China. The Sui and Tang dynasties merged zhou with the next level down, the commanderies or (). The Tang also added another level on top: the circuit or (). Henceforth, zhou were lowered to second-level status, and the word becomes translated into English as \\"prefecture\\". Thereafter, zhou continued to survive as second- or third-level political divisions until the Qing dynasty. The People's Republic of China recycled the name, using it to refer to the autonomous prefectures granted to various ethnicities.

It is part of the Sydney Harbour National Park, which contains examples of ecosystems at risk such as coastal heath. Tania Park is located to the immediate north-east, and contains the 2MWM 90.3 transmitter. There is a lookout sited on the headland named after Arabanoo, the first Aboriginal man to live among European settlers who was captured in Manly Cove in 1788. History Aboriginal grinding grooves. In January 1788 Captain Arthur Phillip noted Aboriginal people living in caves at what is now Wellings Reserve, Balgowlah Heights, and there are a number of Aboriginal sites recorded in the area, including a midden at Reef Beach, which was partly eroded by a storm in May 1974, when human remains were exposed. What is now Dobroyd Head was originally named \\"Dobroyd Point\\" (which is now the name of a locality in Haberfield in the Inner West) by Simeon Lord (1771‚Äì1840), a landowner in the district in the early 19th century. Dobroyd Castle, its namesake, was the home of his mother, Ann Fielden, prior to her marriage in 1764. On his death in 1840, he gifted the land to the Crown, with a stipulation that the name must be kept. In 1871, the Secretary for Lands, John Bowie Wilson, set aside the area of 100 hectares comprising the Dobroyd headland as a defence reserve, but excluded all privately-owned lands, such as Reef Beach, Forty Baskets Beach, Grotto Point, Castle Rock and Clontarf. On 14 August 1874, prominent surveyor and hydrographer, Commander John Thomas Ewing Gowlland was drowned in an accident off the headland.Eleanor E. Barron, 'Gowlland, John Thomas Ewing (1838‚Äì1874)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, , published first in hardcopy 1972, accessed online 3 July 2016. In August 1963 the Manly, Warringah and Pittwater Historical Society unveiled a plaque at Dobroyd Head commemorating him. In 1914, the government steamer, SS Kate, was struck and sunk by the Manly ferry Bellubera off the headland. The Dobroyd Scenic Drive, funded by the council, was opened in 1938 by Manly mayor Percy Nolan. Fisherman's hut, Dobroyd Head. Between 1923 and 1963, various small cabins and shacks were built around Crater Cove on the headland, they were for use as weekenders and retreats and remained occupied until the 1980s. Various subdivisions for the development of Balgowlah Heights occurred throughout the next 80 years until in 1959-1960, when Manly Council learned that land near Cutler Road and Tabalum Road was to be subdivided and objected to any development and sale of land below Cutler Road. This movement to preserve the lands of Dobroyd Head for public recreation was led by alderman Frank Preacher, and on 17 October 1960, Lands Minister Jack Renshaw met representatives of Manly Council on the site. Renshaw later approved the removal of these lands from the sale of land and transferred responsibility for its preservation to Manly council. In 1975, responsibilities changed again when the area was proclaimed as part of the Sydney Harbour National Park. A 2015 article in the Manly Daily later revealed that Manly Council had voted in June 1997 to erect a plaque to honour Renshaw, alderman Preacher and Manly Council's role in the preservation of the headland, but no action has since been taken to carry it out.

Plot Norwegian police officer Harry Hole is sent to Sydney, Australia to serve as an attach√© for the Australian police's investigation into the murder of a young female Norwegian girl residing in Australia, Inger Holter. Her boyfriend, Evans White, is initially approached as a suspect. Hole is assisted by Aboriginal colleague Andrew Kensington; together they find out that they are dealing with a serial killer who strangles blonde women. Hole befriends a red haired Swede named Birgitta. As the story becomes more complex, Hole struggles to find the killer and falls deeper into alcoholism. There are more back stories about Harry's past and culture in Australia. Translation status This is the first of the Harry Hole novels, introducing the character, but it was very late in being translated to English. The British and American publishers chose to start by translating the later books, set in Oslo, and only after these became very popular came around to publishing the first book, set in Australia. This order of publication caused an unintended spoiler, as Harry's reminiscences in a later book‚Äîpublished earlier in English‚Äîincluded the name and specific characteristics of the murderer in The Bat. The second book, The Cockroaches, set in Thailand, has been translated to English, fifteen years after being originally published in Norwegian, and was published in the UK in November 2013. Critical notes Kirkus Reviews states that \\"It‚Äôs an unusual debut since the very first page finds Harry clearing passport control in Sydney, half a world away from his native Oslo... Harry is already every bit as volcanic as in his later cases. The big difference is Australia, which Nesb√∏, seeing it through the eyes of both a tourist and a cultural pathologist, makes you wonder how much different it is from Norway after all.\\" Andy Hoban of Sunday Express noted \\"Nesbo‚Äôs principal characters are both credible and well- drawn and it is fantastic to see a younger Harry, a more loquacious Harry. The Bat explains some of what burdens and drives him in the later books. So for anyone new to Nesbo, you are in for a treat if you follow Harry‚Äôs career beginning with this book. For me, the biggest insult to Nesbo was to see him advertised as ‚Äúthe next Stieg Larsson‚Äù when in fact The Bat was written eight years before The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Still, now I can dig out the rest of the series and read them again, in order.
